Purpose: Accurate and timely diagnosis of breast cancer is extremely important because of its high incidence and high
morbidity. Early diagnosis of breast cancer through screening can improve overall prognosis. Currently, biopsy re-
mains as the gold standard for tumor pathological conﬁrmation. Development of diagnostic imaging techniques for
rapid and accurate characterization of breast lesions is required. We aim to evaluate the usefulness of texture-
derivate features of QUS spectral parametric images for non-invasive characterization of breast lesions.
Methods: QUS Spectroscopy was used to determine parametric images of mid-band ﬁt (MBF), spectral slope (SS), spec-
tral intercept (SI), average scatterer diameter (ASD), and average acoustic concentration (AAC) in 204 patients with
suspicious breast lesions. Subsequently, texture analysis techniques were used to generate texture maps from paramet-
ric images to quantify heterogeneities of QUS parametric images. Further, a second-pass texture analysis was applied to
obtain texture-derivate features. QUS parameters, texture-parameters and texture-derivate parameters were deter-
mined from both tumor core and a 5-mm tumor margin and were used in comparison to histopathological analysis
in order to develop a diagnostic model for classifying breast lesions as either benign or malignant. Both leave-one-
out and hold-out cross-validations were used to evaluate the performance of the diagnostic model. Three standard clas-
siﬁcation algorithms including a linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector
machines-radial basis function (SVM-RBF) were evaluated.
Results: Core and margin information using the SVM-RBF attained the best classiﬁcation performance of 90% sensitiv-
ity, 92% speciﬁcity, 91% accuracy, and 0.93 AUC utilizing QUS parameters and their texture derivatives, evaluated
using leave-one-out cross-validation. Implementation of hold-out cross-validation using combination of both core
and margin information and SVM-RBF achieved average accuracy and AUC of 88% and 0.92, respectively.
Conclusions: QUS-based framework and derivative texture methods enable accurate classiﬁcation of breast lesions.
Evaluation of the proposed technique on a large cohort using hold-out cross-validation demonstrates its robustness
and its generalization.
Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common type of cancers diagnosed in women
and is also the second leading cause of cancer morbidity among women [1].
In 2015, there were 242,476 new cases of female breast cancer in the
United States [3]. Furthermore, in that same year 41,523 women died of
breast cancer in the United States [3]. Early detection of breast cancer re-
sults in an improved overall prognosis as better treatments can be provided
to patients with disease detected at an earlier stage. In order to achieve this
goal, accurate and precise diagnostic techniques are required.
Breast cancer screening typically initiates with mammography,
followed by standard ultrasound imaging (B-mode imaging), dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) as needed,
followed by core-needle biopsy as necessitated [6]. Lesion detection using
x-ray mammography is prone to false negative lesion detection for dense
breasts [3]. Biopsy remains as the gold standard for conﬁrming tumor path-
ological status and for characterizing tumor grade [4]. Nevertheless, biopsy
is an invasive procedure that is associated with pain and a hypothetical in-
creased risk of tumor cell migration. Furthermore, there is a trend of in-
creasingly performing unnecessary biopsies due to the low speciﬁcity of

ultrasound B-mode images [5] and MRI [6]. DCE-MRI may increase the
speciﬁcity of breast cancer detection [7]. Still, DCE-MRI is not always avail-
able for rapid diagnosis because of the longer wait time associated with MR
imaging as compared to ultrasound and mammography. The development
of imaging techniques that can perform rapid and accurate characterization
of breast lesions is very valuable for early detection of breast cancer and
triaging patients in a screening workﬂow [6].
Previous studies have utilized sonographic features of ultrasound
B-mode images to characterize breast lesions [34,35,41]. However, ultra-
sound B-mode images are qualitative in nature and do not provide quanti-
tative microstructural information of tissues [6]. Additionally, they are
instrument- and operator-dependent. To address these limitations, Quanti-
tative Ultrasound (QUS) spectroscopy has been introduced. QUS Spectros-
copy techniques analyze raw radiofrequency signal prior to envelope
detection, logarithmic compression, and post-processing to form ultra-
sound B-mode images. These methods extract quantitative intrinsic acous-
tic properties of tissue microstructures and compensate for operator and
instrument-dependent effects such as beamforming through normalization
procedure [2]. The effect of intervening tissue layers is also considered
through an attenuation correction of the normalized power spectrum
(NPS). QUS Spectral parameters that include mid-band ﬁt (MBF), spectral
slope (SS), and 0-MHz spectral intercept (SI) are derived from linear param-
etrization of the attenuation-corrected normalized power spectrum. These
parameters measure tissue microstructure features that include scattering
power, size and shape of acoustic scatterers, and concentration of scatterers
[6,9]. Fitting of theoretical backscattering models to the measured back-
scatter coefﬁcient (BSC) obtained from the normalized power spectrum al-
lows estimation of two other parameters: average scattering diameter
(ASD) and average acoustic concentration (AAC). The AAC is deﬁned as
the product of number density of scatterers and the square of the acoustic
impedance difference between the scatterers and the background medium
[6].
QUS Techniques have demonstrated capabilities in multiple do-
mains including the evaluation of tumor responses to cancer therapies
in pre-clinical and clinical settings [7,8,9,10,13], the differentiation of
various
types
of
tissue
such
as
prostate,
liver,
and
retina
[14,16,17,18,19,20], the determination of blood-clot and various intra-
vascular plaque components [21,22,23], the detection of tumor deposits
in ex-vivo lymph nodes [24], and the differentiation of normal versus
cancerous thyroid tissues on preclinical animal tumor models [25]. In
relation to breast cancer, earlier pre-clinical studies have demonstrated
QUS capabilities for differentiating spontaneously occurring mammary
ﬁbroadenomas (benign lesions) and mammary carcinomas (malignant
lesions), and for differentiating different types of mammary cancers:
carcinoma and sarcoma [26,27]. QUS techniques have also been used
to differentiate breast tumors from the surrounding normal tissues in lo-
cally advanced breast cancer (LABC) [4]. Therefore, QUS parametric
imaging reﬂecting the size of acoustic scatterers can potentially be
used for the characterization of breast lesions.
Tumor micro-environment, physiology and metabolism exhibit hetero-
geneities that offer diagnostic and prognostic values in cancer characteriza-
tion [42,43,44,46,48]. Different imaging modalities have elucidated the
spatially heterogeneous tumor characteristics. These include MRI [51], pos-
itron emission tomography (PET) [53,52], computerized tomography (CT)
[15,47], and diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) [45]. Texture analysis tech-
niques can quantify objectively such heterogeneities [49]. In the benign
versus malignant characterization, texture analysis methods have been ap-
plied to ultrasound B-mode images [28,37,39,50]. The rationale for this is
that benign and malignant lesions often exhibit homogeneous and hetero-
geneous textures, respectively [6]. Texture analysis methods measure spa-
tial alterations of gray level transitions in B-mode images, providing
distinctive characteristics for this application [6]. However, as ultrasound
B-mode images are operator- and instrument-dependent, the quantitative
texture measures do not represent independent intrinsic properties of the
tumor. Texture analysis of QUS parametric images mitigates this limitation.
Normalization of QUS parameters removes instrument-dependent effects
such that the resultant textural measures represent independent intrinsic
properties of the tumor.
This study builds from an earlier study [6] by signiﬁcant expansion of
the cohort. In addition, the feature space utilized here is expanded through
the inclusion of texture and texture-derivate features. Texture-derivate fea-
tures were obtained through a second-pass texture analysis to determine
textural features from texture-encoded QUS parametric maps, determined
originally from QUS parametric images. Subsequently, in this study we
also applied, for the ﬁrst time, texture and texture-derivate analyses utiliz-
ing peri-tumoral tissue in the characterization of breast lesions. Such QUS-
based texture analysis of tumor margins has demonstrated capabilities in
the a priori prediction of response and survival in locally advanced breast
cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy [33]. Margin infor-
mation is potentially useful for characterizing breast lesions. Benign tumors
have well-deﬁned margins. On the other hand, malignant tumors are typi-
cally characterized by margins that are not clearly-deﬁned and associated
with irregular patterns of growth.
In this study, core and margin analyses were combined in order to de-
velop a diagnostic model for non-invasive characterization of breast lesions
as either benign or malignant. In order to develop a highly accurate and
precise diagnostic model, three standard classiﬁcation algorithms in the
ﬁeld of machine learning that include linear discriminant analysis (LDA),
nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines-radial basis func-
tion (SVM-RBF) were evaluated. We compared the performance of the de-
veloped diagnostic model using both leave-one-out (LOO) and hold-out
cross-validation techniques. The latter is important to demonstrate the gen-
eralizability of the diagnostic model to independent test set that was not
used for model development. We evaluated the classiﬁer performance
using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to obtain met-
rics of sensitivity, speciﬁcity, accuracy, area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative
predictive value (NPV).
Our results indicate that QUS spectral parametric imaging, along with
texture and texture-derivate analyses, have high potentials for rapid, accu-
rate, and non-invasive characterization of breast lesions. Evaluation of the
proposed approach on a larger cohort utilizing proper cross-validation tech-
nique demonstrates the generalizability of the framework.
Methods
Study protocol & data acquisition
The study was conducted based on institutional-research-ethics board ap-
proval (Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center). Radiofrequency data were col-
lected from 204 patients (99 benign and 105 malignant) with suspicious
breast lesions at the Rapid Diagnostic Unit (RDU) of Louise Temerty Breast
Cancer Center at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, Toronto, Ontario,
Canada after obtaining informed consent. The inclusion criterion of the pa-
tients is sonographically identiﬁed breast lesions after the mass has been iden-
tiﬁed previously on clinical and or mammographical examinations. The
ground truth for identiﬁcation of benign versus malignant breast lesions
was obtained from clinical reports that include results from MR images and
biopsy specimens. An experienced sonographer acquired data using a Sonix
Touch system (Ultrasonix, Vancouver, Canada) that was equipped with a lin-
ear array transducer (L14-5/60W). The transducer operates at a central fre-
quency of 6.5 MHz and bandwidth of 3–8 MHz. The radiologist who
performed the scan was not blinded to the presence of a tumor. The objective
of the study is to demonstrate that QUS can objectively discriminate benign vs
malignant breast tumors through extraction of acoustic properties of tissue
microstructure (“acoustic signatures”) that are distinct between benign and
malignant lesions as has been shown by histopathological analysis [11].
Therefore, the knowledge of the precise location of the lesion is required.
QUS analysis include multiple imaging slices across the three-
dimensional tumor acquired using panoramic (PAN) scan. These images
were acquired at about 5-mm intervals across the tumor volume. These
are essentially B-mode scan (two-dimensional imaging) with an additional

feature of saving the beam-formed ultrasound RF data. RF data were digi-
tized using 40 MHz sampling frequency. Data acquisition was performed
along 512 scan lines, corresponding to 6 cm lateral ﬁeld-of-view (FOV)
and 4 cm imaging depth. The focal depth was set at the mid-line of the
tumor. The ﬁeld of views were ﬁxed to include the tumor, whether it is be-
nign or malignant, prior to off-line QUS spectral analysis.
Contouring of the tumor regions of interest (ROI) was performed man-
ually on US B-mode images based on the readings of a radiologist with fa-
miliarity to breast ultrasound interpretation. QUS spectral, texture and
texture-derivate analyses were performed on selected ROIs covering the
tumor core and the 5-mm tumor margin. Tumor margin is an extension of
the tumor from the core up to a 5-mm maximum distance to the surround-
ing area (peri-tumoral region). 5-mm margin was chosen as it gives best
prediction results for response and survival in LABC patients undergoing
neoadjuvant chemotherapy [33].
Feature extraction: linear regression & acoustic form-factor parameters
QUS Spectral analysis was performed over ROIs that include the core and
the 5-mm margin. We used sliding window technique with a 2-mm by 2-mm
kernel to create parametric images of QUS parameters. The size of the win-
dow was chosen to include enough number of acoustic wavelengths for reli-
able spectral estimation, while preserving image texture. A 94% window
overlap was used between adjacent windows both axially and laterally.
We used a Hanning gating function along the range direction on individ-
ual RF scan lines within the window for spectral analysis. RF Spectra were es-
timated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Several independent
adjacent RF signals within the window were used to obtain an averaged
power spectrum that better represent the true power spectrum of the sample.
We acquired the normalized power spectrum using a reference phantom tech-
nique [2,9]. The reference phantom was composed of 5–30 μm glass beads
embedded in a homogeneous medium of oil droplets that were sunk in gela-
tin. The measured attenuation coefﬁcient and speed of sound of the phantom
were 0.786 dB/cm/MHz and 1540 m/s, respectively (University of Wiscon-
sin, Department of Medical Physics, Madison, WI, USA). Attenuation compen-
sation was performed to correct for ultrasound attenuation from propagation
through intervening tissues. We performed a two-layer (intervening tissue
and tumor) attenuation correction using the total attenuation estimation
[30]. The attenuation coefﬁcient estimate (ACE) of the tumor was estimated
using a spectral difference method by calculating the rate of change in the
spectral power magnitude with depth (over the tumor region) and frequency
relative to the reference phantom [31]. We used the assumed attenuation co-
efﬁcient of 1 dB/cm/MHz for the overlying breast tissues [32,40]. Linear re-
gression analysis on the attenuation-corrected normalized power spectrum
resulted in mid-band ﬁt (MBF), spectral slope (SS), and 0-MHz spectral inter-
cept (SI) spectral parameters. Subsequently, the measured backscatter coefﬁ-
cient can be estimated via [9]

where Sm(f) and Sr(f) are the RF spectra from the sample and the reference
phantom, respectively. Parameters αm and αr are the attenuation functions
from the sample and the reference phantom, respectively. Parameter R is
the distance from the transducer face to the proximal side of the ROI window,
and Δz is the window length. Theoretical backscatter coefﬁcient using spher-
ical Gaussian form factor model σtheor(f) was ﬁtted to the measured backscat-
ter coefﬁcient, from which average scattering diameter aeff and average
acoustic concentration nz parameters can be estimated [9,12]. The theoretical

and cl is the speed of sound. F(f,aeff) is the form fac-
tor that describes the frequency-dependent backscatter coefﬁcient. These
analyses resulted in parametric images of mid-band ﬁt, spectral slope, spec-
tral intercept, average scatterers diameter, and average acoustic concentra-
tion. Mean-values from these parametric images were obtained and
subsequently used as features for classiﬁcation.
Feature extraction: texture, texture-derivate, & image quality analysis
We performed texture analysis using the Gray-level Co-Occurrence Ma-
trix (GLCM) method to quantify intra-and peri-tumor heterogeneities. The
GLCM realizes second-order statistical analysis by studying the spatial rela-
tionship between neighboring pixels in an image [49]. The full range of
gray levels in each parametric image was linearly scaled into 16 discrete
gray levels. Symmetric GLCM matrices were created from each parametric
image at inter-pixel distances: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 pixels and at four angular direc-
tions: 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°. From these GLCM matrices, we extracted GLCM
features that include contrast, correlation, energy, and homogeneity:

In Eqs. (3), (4), (5), and (6), the p(i,j) is the probability of having neigh-
boring pixels of intensities i and j in the image, and Ng denotes the number
of gray levels. The μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation for row i or
column j of the GLCM matrix. Textural features are subsequently averaged
over distances and angular directions. Textural measures were assumed to
be reﬂected in these averaged values [49]. Contrast quantiﬁes local gray
level variations in an image. Smoother image produces a lower contrast,
while coarser image results in a higher contrast. Correlation represents lin-
ear correlation between neighboring pixels. Energy measures textural uni-
formity in an image. Homogeneity quantiﬁes the incidence of pixel pairs
of different intensities [6].
Texture-derivate analysis was subsequently applied to the parametric
images. In contrast with the previous texture analysis approach that pro-
duces averaged texture measures, texture-derivate analysis works through
creation of intermediary texture-encoded maps using sliding window anal-
ysis with a 15-pixel by 15-pixel window. Each pixel in these maps repre-
sents quantiﬁcation of local textures across the window. A second pass
texture analysis was subsequently performed on these maps, resulting in
texture-derivate features.
As our analyses include the core and the 5-mm margin, we also deﬁned
image quality metrics: core-to-margin ratio (CMR) and core-to-margin con-
trast ratio (CMCR) that compare pixel intensities between these two regions

Feature selection & classiﬁcation
Mean-value, texture, and texture-derivate features were estimated from
each scan plane and averaged over all scan planes. These weighted aver-
aged measures were subsequently used for classiﬁcation. We performed sta-
tistical analysis to demonstrate the presence of discriminating features for
building a diagnostic model. In order to determine which statistical tests
to use, a Shapiro-Wilk normality test was performed on each feature to
decide if it followed a normal distribution [54]. For a normally distributed
feature, an unpaired t-test was used. Otherwise, a non-parametric Mann-
Whitney U Test (two-sided, 95% conﬁdence) was utilized. Feature selection
was performed using forward sequential-feature-selection (SFS) to look for
best combination of features that contribute to the diagnostic model. We
used leave-one-out and hold-out cross-validations for assessing the perfor-
mance of the diagnostic model. In leave-one-out cross-validation, the classi-
ﬁcation model is trained using all observations except one. The left-out
observation is used for testing the developed model [54]. The process is re-
peated until all observations are left out for testing at least once [54]. The
trained classiﬁer performance was assessed based on F1-Score (the har-
monic average of precision and sensitivity). A hybrid biomarker that con-
sists of 11 features was used to classify breast lesions as either benign or
malignant. This was chosen to limit classiﬁcation bias [39]. Our previous
studies used leave-one-out cross-validation for assessing the diagnostic/re-
sponse predictive model performance [6,33]. Leave-one-out cross-
validation is more appropriate when the data size is relatively small. The
reason is that the number of observations is too small for random
partitioning of the data into training and test sets. As the number of obser-
vations increases, hold-out cross-validation is more relevant for assessing
the performance of the diagnostic model to an independent test set that
was not used in model development [36]. This is a necessary step towards
generalizing our diagnostic model Therefore, we have also implemented
hold out cross-validation that randomly separates the data into a 70%
train set (n = 143) and a 30% test set (n = 61). Model development was
performed on the train set, while performance evaluation was performed
on the unseen test set. As the partitioning is a random process, we repeat
the step ten times and average the classiﬁcation metrics of sensitivity, spec-
iﬁcity, accuracy, AUC, PPV, and NPV.
In order to develop a highly accurate and precise diagnostic model,
three standard computational algorithms: LDA, KNN, and SVM-RBF were
evaluated. LDA projects multi-dimensional feature space into a feature
space that maximizes the ratio of between-class to within-class variance
[33]. Linear classiﬁer works best for linearly separable data [33]. KNN clas-
siﬁcation algorithm used k = 1, 3, 5 nearest neighbors. The KNN is an
instance-based learning algorithm that predicts class association of a test
point in the feature space based on most of the points neighboring the
test point and the distance between those points to the test point [33].
SVM-RBF performs nonlinear mapping of the input data into higher-
dimensional space where the data are supposed to have better distribution,
before selecting an optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between
the two classes [33,54]. Class association of the test data is predicted based
on which side of the gap they fall on [33]. We used Gaussian radial basis
function as the kernel function. The model parameters for SVM-RBF are
the soft margin parameter C and the free parameter γ. We used a grid search
method to optimize these parameters.
Classiﬁcation using either the core or the margin information utilized a
total of 105 features. These include 5 mean-value, 20 texture, and 80
texture-derivate features from ﬁve parametric images. On the other hand,
classiﬁcation using both the core and the margin information used a total
of 220 features comprising of 105 features from the core, 105 features
from the margin, and 10 image quality features.

diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), invasive mammary carcinoma, and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), respectively. From these parametric images, mean-value
and texture features were extracted as imaging bio-markers for the characterization of breast lesions.

Results
Ultrasound B-mode images and RF data were obtained from 204 pa-
tients in this study. Patients were aged 20 to 89 and 99 had benign masses
and 105 had malignant masses in the research group. The sizes of the tu-
mors are 1.6 ± 0.9cm and 3.2 ± 1.9 cm (mean value and standard devia-
tion) for benign and malignant lesions, respectively. Fig. 1 shows
representative ultrasound B-mode and parametric images of average scat-
tering diameter, average acoustic concentration, mid-band ﬁt, spectral
slope, and spectral intercept from both benign and malignant groups with
three different lesions in each group. The representative benign lesions in
Fig. 1 were diagnosed as predominantly ﬁbroadenomas (n = 50) and
cysts/complicated cysts (n = 22). The malignant lesions were diagnosed
as invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) (n = 84), invasive mammary carcinoma
(n = 7), and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) (n = 5), respectively. Mean-
value, texture, and texture-derivate features determined from these para-
metric images were evaluated as imaging biomarkers associated with
benign and malignant lesions. In the B-mode images, benign lesions ap-
peared with better deﬁned borders and less spiculated. In QUS parametric
images, benign lesions demonstrated less heterogeneity than in the malig-
nant lesions.
Texture analyses were used to analyze heterogeneities in breast lesions
and surrounding tissues. Representative parametric overlays of textures
(parametric texture images) are presented in Fig. 2. These images were
used for further textural assessment. Speciﬁcally, from each of these texture
images, four texture-derivate features were further determined and used for
the classiﬁcation of breast lesions.
Fig. 3 presents representative box plots of mean-value, texture, texture-
derivate, and image quality features that demonstrate statistical signiﬁcant
differences between benign and malignant breast lesions. The bottom and
top edges of the box represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively.
The central mark in each box indicates the median. The whiskers represent
1.5 times the interquartile range. Five mean-value, 25 texture, 165 texture-
derivate, and 4 image quality features demonstrated statistical signiﬁcant
differences (p < 0.05) between the two lesions types (benign versus malig-
nant). Features were further subclassiﬁed based on their degree of statisti-
cal signiﬁcance. Statistical signiﬁcant (p < 0.05), highly signiﬁcant (p <
0.01), and extremely signiﬁcant (p < 0.001) features are indicated with
(*), (**), and (***) respectively. Among the mean-value parameters from
the core, mid-band ﬁt, spectral intercept, and average acoustic concentra-
tion showed statistical signiﬁcant difference (p < 0.05). The mid-band
ﬁt, spectral intercept, and average acoustic concentration from the core
are 4.4 ± 0.6 dB versus 2.4 ± 0.5 dB, 12.1 ± 0.7 dB versus 10.5 ±
0.6 dB, and 47.0 ± 1.2 dB/cm3 versus 44.0 ± 0.8 dB/cm3 for benign
and malignant lesions, respectively. Among the mean-value parameters
from the margin, mid-band ﬁt and spectral intercept showed statistical sig-
niﬁcant difference (p < 0.05). The mid-band ﬁt and spectral intercept from
the margin are 11.3 ± 0.4 dB versus 9.3 ± 0.3 dB and 20.2 ± 0.5 dB versus
17.6 ± 0.5 dB for benign and malignant lesions, respectively.
Mean-values, texture and texture-derivate (texture of texture) features
were examined and feature selection for the purposes of classiﬁcation was de-
termined. The number of features was limited to 1/20 to prevent overﬁtting
of data. Table 1 tabulates optimum features that contributed to a hybrid bio-
marker that best separated benign from malignant lesions. Although a maxi-
mum combination of 11 features was selected, the hybrid biomarkers that
provided the best classiﬁcation accuracy can result from a fewer combination
of features. For instance, the peak core classiﬁcation performance was ob-
tained from a combination of 8 features: MBF-COR-ENE, SS-HOM-CON,
ASD-HOM-COR, SI-HOM, ASD-CON-HOM, MBF-ENE-HOM, SI-HOM-ENE,
and SS-HOM-ENE. Texture-derivate features dominated as discriminative fea-
tures that resulted in the best hybrid biomarkers which separated patients
into whether they had benign or malignant features.
Different classiﬁers were compared in order to select the one with the best
performance. Fig. 4 shows bar plots of the classiﬁcation performance of three

combination of core and margin information. Tumor core information
alone resulted in a high classiﬁcation performance of more than 90% accu-
racy with LDA and SVM-RBF classiﬁers. Tables 2A and 2B present
classiﬁcation performance using tumor core information from different clas-
siﬁcation algorithms with leave-one-out and hold-out cross-validations, re-

demonstrate statistical signiﬁcant difference between the two lesions. Statistical signiﬁcant, highly signiﬁcant (p < 0.01), and extremely signiﬁcant (p < 0.001) are

best classiﬁcation performance was obtained using SVM-RBF, with 83% accu-
racy and 0.87 AUC. Tables 3A and 3B present classiﬁcation performance
using margin information from different classiﬁcation algorithms with
leave-one-out and hold-out cross-validations, respectively. The combination
of both core and margin information resulted in a best classiﬁcation perfor-
mance of 91% accuracy and 0.93 AUC with SVM-RBF, compared to using
core and margin information individually. Tables 4A and 4B present classiﬁ-
cation performance using core and margin information from different classi-
ﬁcation algorithms with leave-one-out and hold-out cross-validations,
respectively. We observed that using hold out cross-validation, the classiﬁca-
tion performance decreases compared to leave-one-out cross-validation. This
result is not unexpected as random partitioning of the data into training and
test sets can result in variations in classiﬁcation performance as the data used
to develop the model are not the same each time. Nevertheless, combination
of both core and margin analyses still obtained the best result of 88% accu-
racy and 0.92 AUC. This was achieved using SVM-RBF classiﬁcation algo-
rithm. As seen from Tables 2B, 3B, and 4B, SVM-RBF proves to be more
robust to random partitioning of the data compared to linear discriminant
analysis and nearest neighbors classiﬁcation algorithms.
Discussion & conclusion
In this study, the utility of mean-value, texture, and texture-derivate fea-
tures of QUS parametric images for non-invasive characterization of breast
lesions is demonstrated. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study that ex-
plores on using texture-derivate features for such a characterization. In

Optimum features set for classiﬁcation using tumor core, 5-mm tumor margin, and
combination of both core and 5-mm margin information with SVM-RBF using leave-
one-out cross-validation. A maximum of 11 features was selected for classiﬁcation.
Features were selected using forward SFS with leave-one-out cross-validation and
F1-score metric. Texture-derivate features, for example Core – MBF-COR-ENE: en-
ergy of correlation image of mid-band ﬁt parametric image of core ROI, were the
dominant features that contributed to hybrid biomarkers that best separate the
two lesion types.

addition to analyzing texture and texture-derivate features from tumor
core, the analysis here was expanded to include peri-tumoural tissue (5-
mm margin extending from the core). This study builds upon an earlier
[6] through a signiﬁcant expansion of the number of patients. In the previ-
ous study, there were 78 patients with suspicious breast lesions (46 benign
and 32 malignant cases). In the current study, newer techniques are applied
on a larger cohort of patients consisting of 204 patients with suspicious
breast lesions (99 benign and 105 malignant cases). In addition, appropri-
ate cross-validation technique was implemented to demonstrate the gener-
alizability of the developed diagnostic model to independent test sets that
were not used in model development. Here, a hybrid vector of biomarkers
developed through forward sequential feature selection achieved a sensitiv-
ity of 90%, a speciﬁcity of 92%, an accuracy of 91%, and an AUC of 0.93.
In the previous study, mean-values of MBF, SI, and AAC did not indicate
any statistical signiﬁcant difference between the two lesions [6]. In this
study, however, mean-values of MBF, SI, and AAC from the core and the
5-mm margin demonstrated statistical signiﬁcant difference (p < 0.05) be-
tween the two lesion types. This is likely due to the size of the increased co-
hort. In particular, it was observed that the MBF, SI, and AAC of malignant
lesions are lower than those of benign lesions. This observation is consistent
with the observation from an earlier study [4] where the QUS parameters of
cancerous breast tissues were lower than those of normal breast tissues.
Furthermore, this observation was also consistent with sonographic fea-
tures of ultrasound B-mode images of breast lesions where malignant le-
sions often exhibited markedly hypoechoic appearance in comparison
with benign lesions [34]. The MBF and SI parameters represent tissue fea-
tures that includes scatterer size, shape, number, organization, and their
elastic properties [8]. These properties are distinct between benign and ma-
lignant lesions as have been shown from histopathological analysis [11].
Benign lesions are characterized by more regular arrangement of cells
[11]. On the other hand, malignant lesions are characterized by
cellularity-rich cells with tendency to form cell clusters [11].
Since average-based parameters only characterize lesions using mean-
values, the information regarding tumor heterogeneity is lost. Texture
and texture-derivate features of QUS parametric images quantify lesion het-
erogeneities that includes variations in size, density, and distribution of
acoustic scatterers. These biomarkers can potentially characterize tissue
micro-structures and provide better separation between different histologi-
cal tissue types compared to averaged mean-values parameters. Among tex-
tural features, 25 biomarkers showed statistical signiﬁcant differences (p <
0.05) and 21 biomarkers showed statistically extremely signiﬁcant differ-
ences (p < 0.001) between the two lesion types. In addition, a second
pass texture analysis was applied to the parametric images, for the ﬁrst
time, resulting in analysis of texture images that represent local textural
variations of QUS parametric images. From these texture images, texture-
derivate features (texture of texture) were subsequently determined.
Texture-derivate features can potentially provide even better separation be-
tween benign and malignant lesions. Among the texture-derivate features,
167 biomarkers demonstrated statistical signiﬁcant differences (p <
0.05), 141 biomarkers demonstrated statistically highly signiﬁcant differ-
ences (p < 0.01), and 110 biomarkers demonstrated statistically extremely
signiﬁcant differences (p < 0.001) between the two lesion groups. Analysis
of QUS parameters and textures from the core and the 5-mm margin allows
us to obtain image quality features including CMR and CMCR that were also
used in the classiﬁcation. We considered these features, for the ﬁrst time, as
potential biomarkers for characterizing breast lesions. CMR and CMCR
have been used for the a priori prediction of response and survival in pa-
tients with locally advanced breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemo-
therapy [33]. The CMR of MBF and SI parametric images, along with the
CMCR of ASD and SS parametric images, demonstrated statistical signiﬁ-
cant differences (p < 0.05) between benign and malignant breast lesions.
In this study, we also observed that benign lesions are smaller than ma-
lignant lesions with mean values and standard deviations of 1.6 ± 0.9cm
and 3.2 ± 1.9cm, respectively. The difference is statistically signiﬁcant (p
< 0.05). This observation is consistent with the ﬁndings of Stavros et al.
[34]. In that study, they found that benign lesions are most associated
with a maximum diameter of 1.5 cm or less, while malignant lesions are
most associated with a maximum diameter of 1.5 cm or more [34]. Al-
though this difference is present, Stavros et al. concluded that maximum di-
ameter of the lesion is an indeterminate sonographic characteristic or
feature [34]. Size alone is not enough for deﬁnitive discrimination of
benign versus malignant breast lesions. QUS spectroscopy that extracts in-
dependent intrinsic distribution of acoustic properties can provide discrim-
inating features that better separate the two groups. In addition, texture and
derivative texture method allow quantiﬁcation of intra- and peri-tumoral
heterogeneities, resulting in more contrasting features.
Nearly all the selected features for hybrid biomarkers were texture-
derivate features. This is not unexpected because statistical signiﬁcant anal-
ysis using Mann-Whitney U Test showed that 110 texture-derivate features
demonstrated statistically extremely signiﬁcant differences (p < 0.001).
Combinations of these strongly discriminating features resulted in hybrid
biomarkers that best separated benign from malignant breast lesions.
Core information alone was able to accurately classify breast lesions with
91% sensitivity, 91% speciﬁcity, 91% accuracy, and a 0.92 AUC. This was
obtained using a SVM-RBF classiﬁcation algorithm. On the other hand,
margin-only information resulted in a best classiﬁcation performance of
83% accuracy and a AUC of 0.87. This was also obtained using a SVM-
RBF classiﬁer. Among the classiﬁcation algorithms assessed, KNN analysis
yielded the lowest performance for margin-based classiﬁcation. For core-
based classiﬁcation, the three classiﬁcation algorithms performed compara-
bly. Using LDA and SVM-RBF, core information alone was able to separate
benign and malignant lesions with more than a 90% accuracy. The combi-
nation of core and margin information demonstrated a best classiﬁcation
performance of 90% sensitivity, 92% speciﬁcity, 91% accuracy, and 0.93
AUC using SVM-RBF algorithm.
As a necessary step towards generalizing the proposed QUS-based
framework and novel derivative texture method for non-invasive character-
ization of breast lesions, we also implemented hold-out cross-validation in
order to assess the performance of the diagnostic model. The classiﬁcation
performance using hold-out cross-validation showed a slight decrease com-
pared to that obtained using leave-one-out cross-validation. This result is
not unexpected as random partitioning of the data into training and test
sets can result in variations of the trained decision boundary, ultimately af-
fecting the diagnostic model's performance. Nevertheless, combination of
both core and margin information for classiﬁcation using SVM-RBF still
achieved average accuracy and AUC of 88% and 0.92, respectively. Core in-
formation alone achieved the best average accuracy and AUC of 88% and
0.91, respectively using SVM-RBF. On the other hand, margin information
alone attained the best accuracy and AUC of 82% and 0.87, respectively

using SVM-RBF. Non-linear classiﬁcation algorithm in SVM-RBF proves to
be more robust to random data partitioning compared to linear and
instance-based classiﬁcation algorithms.
Previously, ultrasound B-mode images and the texture analysis of these
images have been explored to perform noninvasive characterization of
breast lesions [38]. The use of sonography for the characterization of breast
lesions achieved 98% sensitivity, 68% speciﬁcity, and 73% accuracy from
750 patients with breast lesions (625 benign and 125 malignant) [34]. Fur-
ther, analysis of envelope statistics of ultrasound B-mode images using
Nakagami imaging achieved 92% sensitivity, 72% speciﬁcity, and 82% ac-
curacy in characterizing 100 patients with breast lesions (50 benign and 50
malignant) [29]. Texture analysis of ultrasound B-mode images has been
utilized for breast lesion characterization [28]. In that study, application
of GLCM-based texture analysis on envelope-based images resulted in a
classiﬁcation performance of 70% sensitivity, 77% speciﬁcity, and 74%
accuracy. Further work involving the application of advanced machine
learning techniques in artiﬁcial neural network on ultrasound B-mode im-
ages of breast lesions resulted in a better classiﬁcation performance of
92% sensitivity, 91% speciﬁcity, and 91% accuracy [35]. In this work,
the combination of several single biomarkers was able to classify breast le-
sions with a peak classiﬁcation performance of 90% sensitivity, 92% spec-
iﬁcity, and 91% accuracy, and a AUC of 0.93. This was achieved with
imaging biomarkers from the combination of the core and the 5-mm margin
using a SVM-RBF classiﬁcation algorithm. QUS-Based techniques, along
with texture and texture-derivate analyses, provided an improved classiﬁ-
cation performance for the characterization of breast lesions compared to
past work utilizing ultrasound B-mode images. This result can be attributed
to the fact that QUS techniques measure independent intrinsic acoustic and
mechanical properties of tissue microstructure that are distinct between be-
nign and more structurally disorganized malignant lesions. Furthermore,
QUS spectral analysis offers system-and operator-independent measure-
ments of tissue properties through a normalization procedure. In the
work here, the classiﬁcation of breast lesions using these imaging bio-
markers resulted in a more robust classiﬁcation algorithm. Additionally,
QUS does not use ionizing radiation and does not need the administration
of exogenous contrast agents. These advantages of QUS spectroscopy over
other imaging modalities including mammography, standard ultrasound
B-mode, and contrast-enhanced MRI make it an ideal tool for rapid breast
cancer diagnosis in clinical settings.
QUS offers rapid breast cancer diagnosis because the acquisition time of
raw radiofrequency data for spectral analysis is the same with that of B-
mode imaging. From the ultrasound imaging system perspective, QUS ac-
quisition uses B-mode imaging sequence. Although data evaluation takes
way much longer (depending on the size of the tumor and the size of the
tumor margin), this is due to the way our spectral analysis routines are writ-
ten and not a limitation of the QUS framework. Our codes implemented se-
quential processing as opposed to parallel processing. In the former, for a
given ROI, the computation process goes through each point in the ROI,
taking 2 mm by 2 mm window, once at a time. After the process for a win-
dow ﬁnishes, the process resumes to the next point in the 2D ROI. On the
other hand, parallel processing allows for computation of many kernels
(functions) simultaneously. In this way, each time, many kernels are de-
ployed to process 2 mm by 2 mm regions within the ROI. This potentially
results in speed-up in data processing and allows real-time QUS analysis.
This can be achieved through implementation of QUS using graphical pro-
cessing unit (GPU) computing.
A possible concern is the accuracy of the attenuation correction method
used here. QUS spectroscopy extracts acoustic properties through estima-
tion of average power spectra from the sample, after normalization proce-
dure and attenuation compensation. The spectral difference method was
used to estimate the local attenuation coefﬁcient of the tumor. Labyed
et al. [30] concluded that the optimal kernel/window sizes and ROI lengths
for attenuation correction using clinical array transducer with the spectral
difference method are kernels than contain 5 wavelengths or more and
ROIs that contain 35 wavelengths or more. Window/kernel that contain 5
wavelengths or more can capture all spectral contents of the RF signal
[30]. In addition, ROIs that contain 35 wavelengths or more axially resulted
in mean and standard deviation of the ACE that are less than 15% and 10%,
respectively [30]. In this study, a 2 mm by 2 mm window/kernel was used
with typical ROI sizes of 16 mm (taking the mean size of the benign lesions)
plus an additional of 10 mm for a 5-mm tumor rim analysis, resulting in ef-
fective ROIs of at least 26 mm. For a 6.5 MHz center frequency, the wave-
length is 0.24 mm, such that the window/kernel here contains 8
wavelengths (greater than 5 wavelengths for optimal ACE estimation)
and the ROIs contain 108 wavelengths or more (greater than 35 wave-
lengths as prescribed by Labyed et al. for optimal ACE estimation [30]).
In summary, the rapid and accurate characterization of breast lesions is
an essential component of breast cancer diagnosis that can affect prognosis
by providing better therapeutic options for patients with disease detected at
an earlier stage. QUS parametric imaging, along with texture and texture-
derivate analysis, can be a working non-invasive technique for breast le-
sions characterization. Our work demonstrated the robustness of QUS-
based framework and texture analysis for larger patient populations with
suspicious breast lesions. Implementation of hold-out cross-validation dem-
onstrates the generalizability of the developed diagnostic model to unseen
test sets. This work provides a foundation for the use of quantitative ultra-
sound in the characterization and differentiation of breast lesions.
