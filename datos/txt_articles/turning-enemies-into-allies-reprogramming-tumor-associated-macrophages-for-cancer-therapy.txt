Turning enemies into allies—reprogramming
tumor-associated macrophages for cancer therapy
Martina Molgora1 and Marco Colonna1,*
SUMMARY
Checkpoint blockade therapies that target inhibitory receptors on
T cells have revolutionized clinical oncology. Antibodies targeting
CTLA-4 or the PD-1/PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) axis are now successfully
used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for numerous tu-
mor types. Despite the clinical success of checkpoint blockade ther-
apies, tumors exploit multiple mechanisms to escape or subvert the
anti-tumor T cell response. Within the tumor microenvironment, tu-
mor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can suppress T cell responses
and facilitate tumor growth in various ways, ultimately debilitating
clinical responses to T cell checkpoint inhibitors. There is therefore
signiﬁcant interest in identifying biologicals and drugs that target
immunosuppressive TAM within the tumor microenvironment and
can be combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Here, we re-
view approaches that are currently being evaluated to convert
immunosuppressive TAM into immunostimulatory macrophages
that promote T cell responses and tumor elimination.
INTRODUCTION
Macrophages provide a ﬁrst line of defense during infections and other tissue insults
through multiple mechanisms: (1) phagocytosis of pathogens and damaged cells; (2)
production of bactericidal nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS); (3)
secretion of chemokines that recruit other immune cells; and (4) secretion of cyto-
kines, such as interleukin-12 (IL-12), that activate CD8 T cells, T helper 1 (TH1) cells,
and natural killer (NK) cells. Moreover, macrophages express Fc receptors for immu-
noglobulin G (IgG) that enable phagocytosis and killing of targets opsonized by IgG
through
antibody-dependent
phagocytosis
(ADCP)
and
antibody-dependent
cellular
cytotoxicity
(ADCC),
respectively.1,2
Conversely,
macrophages
also
contribute to resolution of immune responses, tissue repair, and restoration in
several ways: (1) secreting soluble factors that attenuate immune responses, such
as IL-10, transforming growth factor b (TGF-b), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and trypto-
phan catabolites generated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO); (2) releasing
chemokines that attract Treg cells; (3) promoting angiogenesis through VEGF secre-
tion; and (4) producing metabolites generated by arginase I that promote wound
healing.1,3 Although immune defense and tissue repair functions of macrophages
were originally framed within the dual M1-M2 paradigm, it is now recognized that
macrophage programs are complex and heterogeneous, depending on context.1,4
Beyond their contribution to host defense and tissue repair, macrophages are also
one of the most abundant immune cell populations in human tumors and mouse
tumor models.1,5,6 The origins, phenotypes, and functions of tumor-associated mac-
rophages (TAMs) are heterogeneous, depending on the type of tumor and the
microenvironment in which tumors develop.1 TAMs can derive from tissue-resident

macrophages that seed tissues during fetal hematopoiesis and persist through self-
renewal, as well as peripheral blood monocytes that inﬁltrate the tumor.7–14 Tumor-
imprinted monocytes, known as monocyte-related myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSCs), which differentiate into suppressive macrophages, have also been identi-
ﬁed in patients and in tumor bearing mice.15 In general, the phenotypic and func-
tional proﬁle of TAMs parallel those observed during tissue repair, which promote
suppression of anti-tumor immune responses, tumor growth, vascularization, and
metastatization (Figure 1).1 In agreement with a predominant pro-tumorigenic
impact, TAM inﬁltration is often associated with a poor prognosis and abbreviated
survival for many different types of human cancer (e.g., breast, bladder, ovarian,
and gastric cancer and hematological malignancies).16–20 Thus, therapeutic strate-
gies have been devised to either limit macrophage recruitment into the tumor or
deplete macrophages already present in it. Blockade of CCR2 can limit recruitment
of monocytes into the tumor,6,21,22 whereas inhibitors of the receptor for CSF1
Figure 1. Pro-tumor and anti-tumor functions of TAMs
Upper left: immunosuppressive functions. TAMs can inhibit T cell, dendritic cells (DCs), and natural killer (NK) cell activation through the
immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGF-b; TAMs also suppress anti-tumor T cell functions through inhibitory receptor-ligand interactions,
production of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), release of arginase I catabolites, and PGE2. Moreover, TAMs contribute to differentiation and
recruitment of regulatory T cells (Treg cells) via IL-10, TGFb, CCL17, and CCL22. Upper right: immunostimulatory functions. TAMs can activate the anti-
tumor immune response by recruiting and activating T cells, NK cells, and DCs through the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 and the pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18. TAMs can eliminate Treg cells via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or antibody-dependent cellular
phagocytosis (ADCP) during immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies targeting Treg cells. Lower left: direct pro-tumor functions. TAMs can
promote resistance to therapy, angiogenesis, tumor cell survival, and metastatization. Lower right: direct anti-tumor activities. TAMs can directly kill
tumor cells via phagocytosis, ADCP, ADCC, release of nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS).

(CSF1R) and activation of the death receptor TRAIL-R impair maintenance and
survival of TAMs within the tumor (Figure 2).23–25 Clinical trials based on these stra-
tegies are ongoing, although their efﬁcacy so far seems limited (see for review
Mantovani et al.,1 Cassetta and Pollard,5 and Majety et al.26). Despite a predominant
pro-tumorigenic impact, in certain contexts, TAMs are capable of phagocytosing tu-
mor cells, killing tumor cells through release of NO and ROS, secreting IL-12 and
promoting anti-tumor CD8 T cell and Th1 responses, and ultimately restricting tu-
mor growth.26 Immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive TAMs can coexist within
the same tumor. Thus, alternative therapeutic approaches have been designed that
aim at reshaping the TAM landscape by converting the TAM proﬁle from immuno-
suppressive into immunostimulatory. This goal can be achieved through various ap-
proaches: (1) blockade of cell surface receptors on immunosuppressive TAMs; (2)
blockade of ligand-receptor pairs that inhibit phagocytosis; (3) blockade of signaling
and epigenetic mechanisms of TAM immunosuppression; and (4) engagement of ex-
isting or artiﬁcially transduced activating receptors (Figure 2). In the following para-
graphs, we discuss prototypic target molecules for each of these strategies.
Cell surface receptors of immunosuppressive TAMs
Cell surface phenotypes, transcriptional proﬁles, and functions of immunosuppres-
sive TAMs are quite heterogeneous and change considerably, depending on the tu-
mor and the microenvironment. Notwithstanding, several cell surface molecules
have been frequently associated with TAM immunosuppressive functions, including
CD206 (MRC1), CD204 (MSR1), CX3CR1, MARCO, SIGLEC1, TREM2, CD9, CD63,
PD-1 ligand (PD-L1), CD73, and MERTK (Figure 3). While some of these molecules

are simply markers so far, others directly contribute to immunosuppression and have
been targeted to reprogram TAMs into immune-stimulating cells (Figure 4). These
latter include TREM2, MARCO, SIGLEC1, PD-L1, and CD73.
TREM2
TREM2 is a cell surface receptor of the Ig superfamily expressed on many tissue mac-
rophages that binds phospholipids, apoptotic cells, and lipoproteins. TREM2 trans-
mits intracellular signals through the adaptor molecule DAP12, which recruits the
protein tyrosine kinase SYK. This signaling pathway activates multiple downstream
mediators, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), PLCg2, and mitogen-acti-
vated protein kinase (MAPK), and cooperates with the CSF1R pathway.27–29 Metal-
loproteases regulate TREM2 surface expression by cleaving the ectodomain, which
is released as soluble TREM2.30 TREM2 has been widely studied in Alzheimer’s dis-
ease because of its important role in sustaining the microglia response to brain accu-
mulation of b-amyloid plaques.30 However, TREM2 is expressed in macrophages of
various tissues in physiological and pathological conditions.30 In the adipose tissue,
TREM2 is required to sustain a population of lipid-associated macrophages that pre-
vent dysmetabolism caused by high-fat diet.31 In cirrhotic patients and a mouse
model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, TREM2 is highly expressed in liver
CD9+ macrophages, which resemble lipid-associated macrophages and protect he-
patocytes from lipid accumulation.32–34 In atherosclerosis, TREM2 contributes to
lipid catabolism in macrophages of atherosclerotic plaques.35 The expression of
TREM2 has been recently reported in TAMs of cancer patients and mouse tumor
models,36,37 and two studies showed that TREM2 sustains immunosuppressive
TAMs.38,39 Using a novel technology that couples single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) and intracellular protein measurements, one study identiﬁed a subset
of TAMs in a model of methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced sarcoma that coex-
presses the immunosuppressive marker arginase 1 (Arg1) and TREM2.38 This Arg1+-
Trem2+ subset was associated with tumor progression, whereas TREM2 deletion
restricted tumor growth. In another study, TREM2 deletion and TREM2 blockade

with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) reshaped the TAM landscape, facilitating T cell
activation. The proportion of Mrc1+Cx3cr1+ TAMs declined, whereas the represen-
tation of Cd83+Cxcl9+ and Nos2+ TAMs increased. These changes in TAMs were
associated with blunted tumor growth and an increased response to anti-PD-1 in
models of sarcoma, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry
analysis of specimens from cancer patients revealed that TREM2 is speciﬁcally ex-
pressed by TAMs of many human tumor types (skin, liver, lung, breast, colon, stom-
ach, bladder, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, lymphoma, and glioma).39 More-
over, high TREM2 expression in cohorts of patients with triple-negative breast
carcinoma and colorectal cancer was associated with a negative prognosis.
Together, these studies suggest that TREM2 blockade and, perhaps, TREM2 cleav-
age can be promising approaches for TAM reprogramming. Whether TREM2
signaling promotes macrophage immunosuppression directly, by cooperating
with CSF1R signaling, or through other mechanisms is currently unknown.
MARCO
A member of the scavenger receptor family that is expressed by subsets of tissue
macrophages, MARCO is upregulated upon bacterial infection and is expressed
on TAMs in breast, colon cancer, endometrial cancer, melanoma, and non-small

cell lung cancer.40,41 TAMs expressing MARCO evinced a typical immunosuppres-
sive signature in models of breast cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma. Treatment
with an anti-MARCO mAb was associated with improved tumor control and limited
metastases in mouse models of melanoma and breast cancer.42 Combined blockade
of MARCO and CTLA-4 was more efﬁcient than single blockade of CTLA-4 in models
of colon cancer and melanoma and was dependent on skewing of macrophage phe-
notypes.42 The mechanism by which anti-MARCO mAb impacts TAM function re-
mains to be determined. However, MARCO+ TAMs were found close to tumor cell
nests in non-small cell lung cancer patients; co-expressed other TAM immunosup-
pressive markers, such as PD-L1 and CD163; and were associated with the expres-
sion of T cell inhibitory receptors and T cell inhibitory ligands, such as PD-1,
PD-L1, CTLA-4, and VISTA.40 Thus, combination of MARCO blockade with immuno-
checkpoint therapies might be a promising approach in clinical settings.
SIGLEC1
SIGLEC1 (also known as CD169) is a phagocytic receptor of Ig-like lectin family that
binds sialic acids and is expressed by normal macrophages and TAMs.43 In humans,
SIGLEC1 expression correlated with poor disease prognosis in several cohorts and
was one of the top genes with expression enriched in TAMs within breast cancer
compared to macrophages from healthy breast tissue.44 To address the impact of
SIGLEC1+ macrophages, a recombinant mouse line has been developed in which
the diphtheria toxin receptor is expressed under the control of the Siglec1 promoter,
such that SIGLEC1+ macrophages can be eliminated in vivo by injection of diph-
theria toxin. In a preclinical model of triple-negative breast cancer, selective deple-
tion of SIGLEC1+ macrophages was associated with improved tumor control and
limited metastases, likely due to more robust CD8 T cell expansion.45 In vitro, co-cul-
ture of breast cancer cell lines with macrophages heightened SIGLEC1 expression
and induced PD-L1 expression through the JAK2 signaling pathway, bolstering their
immunosuppressive function. While these studies demonstrate the immunosup-
pressive impact of SIGLEC1+ TAMs, it not yet clear that SIGLEC1 has a direct role
in the induction of immunosuppression.
Adenosine receptors
Adenosine is mostly generated through the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) released to the extracellular space by dying or stressed cells and immune
cells.46 The cell membrane enzyme CD39 sequentially hydrolyzes ATP to adenosine
diphosphate (ADP) and monophosphate (AMP); the ectonucleotidase CD73 then hy-
drolyzes AMP to adenosine, which signals through G-protein-coupled receptors
(A1R, A2AR, A2BR, and A3R). CD39, CD73, as well as adenosine receptors are widely
expressed in both tumor cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,
including macrophages. Extracellular ATP promotes the inﬂammatory response in
several conditions, whereas adenosine signaling has a broad anti-inﬂammatory ef-
fect.46 It was reported that adenosine could induce an ‘‘M2-like’’ differentiation of
macrophages in the absence of other type 2 cytokines, such as IL-4.47 Moreover,
A2B receptor signaling inhibited interferon-g (IFNg) production in T cells, indirectly
affecting macrophage polarization.48 Adenosine was also reported to suppress
phagocytic activity, NO production, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression of
differentiated macrophages in vitro and in murine models of bacterial infec-
tions.49,50 In vitro inhibition of CD39 in macrophages promoted IL-1b production,
possibly by preserving ATP and hindering adenosine accumulation.51 Along these
lines, inhibition of CD73 with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) emulsion given intrana-
sally was associated with reduced glioblastoma growth and proportionally fewer
CD206+ macrophages in a preclinical model.52 Although the adenosine pathway

has a broad immunosuppressive effect in the tumor microenvironment,53 speciﬁc
and possibly inducible ablation of CD73, CD39, and adenosine receptor expression
in macrophages will be essential to delineate the impact of adenosine on TAM
function.
Ligand-receptor pairs that inhibit phagocytosis
Phagocytosis is triggered by ‘‘eat me’’ signals displayed on micro-organisms and
target cells that engage phagocytic receptors on macrophages. Conversely, healthy
cells display ‘‘do not eat me’’ signals that engage inhibitory receptors to prevent au-
toreactivity.54 Tumor cells often exploit ‘‘do not eat me’’ signals to escape phagocy-
tosis by macrophages. Thus, mAbs and other immunotherapeutic approaches have
been developed to block ‘‘do not eat me’’ signaling pathways and facilitate phago-
cytosis of tumor cells (Figure 4).
CD47-SIRP1a pathway
CD47 is a cell surface Ig-like molecule that is expressed in all cells. CD47 associates
in cis with integrins, broadly contributing to migration, cell-cell fusion, activation,
cytokine production, and phagocytosis. Moreover, CD47 acts as a ‘‘do not eat
me’’ signal by engaging in trans SIRP1a, a cell surface receptor that is constitutively
expressed by macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and some dendritic cells.55
The cytoplasmic domain of SIRP1a contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhib-
itory motifs (ITIMs). Upon binding CD47, SIRP1a ITIMs recruit the protein-tyrosine
phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2, which transmit intracellular inhibitory signals.56
Among various targets, SIRP1a inhibits nonmuscle myosins that control cytoskeleton
architecture, thereby blocking the formation of a phagocytic synapse between mac-
rophages and tumor cells.56 In steady-state, CD47-SIRP1a interaction prevents
phagocytosis of red blood cells by splenic macrophages.55 However, CD47 overex-
pression is a mechanism of immune evasion for human solid tumors (e.g., bladder
and breast cancer) and hematological malignancies (e.g., myeloid leukemia and
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma).57–60 Blockade of CD47 by mAbs in vitro restored
macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells.59,61,62 In vivo treatment of tumors with
anti-CD47 mAbs in several humanized and syngeneic mouse models promoted
phagocytosis of tumor cells along with immune activation and hence curbed tumor
growth.61,63,64 mAbs and other molecules targeting the CD47-SIRP1a axis tested in
clinical trials include mAbs blocking CD47 (Hu5F9-G4, SRF231, IBI188, and AO-176),
mAbs blocking SIRP1a (BI-765063), fusion proteins targeting CD47 (TTI-621, TTI-
622, and ALX148; NCT03530683; NCT02663518), and bispeciﬁc mAbs targeting
both CD47 and PD-1. Most of these treatments were well tolerated, and some (alone
or in combination) showed a certain degree of efﬁcacy in patients with ovarian can-
cer, fallopian tube cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, B
cell lymphomas, cutaneous T cell lymphoma, late-stage non-small cell lung cancer,
and gastric cancer (NCT02367196).65–68 In addition to facilitating tumor cell phago-
cytosis, anti-CD47 mAb treatment promoted ADCP in a model of glioblastoma, as
well as ADCC in models of ovarian and breast cancer.69–71 Accordingly, anti-CD47
mAbs with a functional Fc domain can be more efﬁcacious than those with a mutated
Fc lacking effector functions.68 Although current literature and clinical trials support
the beneﬁcial effects of targeting the CD47-SIRP1a pathway, there are also some
limitations. First, the broad expression of CD47 by different cell types, including
red and white blood cells, can cause off-target sequestration of anti-CD47 mAbs
and adverse effects like anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.66 In this re-
gard, targeting SIRP1a instead of CD47 might be safer because of the restricted
expression of SIRP1a on myeloid cells.72 Second, CD47-SIRP1a blockade is not al-
ways sufﬁcient to impact phagocytosis of tumor cells because of other ‘‘do not eat

Review
me’’ signals coexpressed on tumor cells.54 Lastly, because it is ubiquitously ex-
pressed throughout the body, CD47 expression cannot be used to stratify patients
and predict the response to anti-CD47 therapy.26 Recently, effective induction of
phagocytosis of hematological tumors by CD47 blockade was shown to require
concomitant adhesion of macrophages to hematopoietic tumor cells through
SLAMF7 and integrin aMb2.73 Thus, a better understanding of the complex mech-
anisms contributing to CD47-SIRP1a blockade might help identify patients who
would beneﬁt from this therapy.
MHC class I-LILRB1/2 pathway
Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (MHC-I) molecules can act as ‘‘do not
eat me’’ signals in cancer by interacting with two members of the human leukocyte
Ig-like receptor (LILR) family, LILRB1 (also known as ILT2) and LILRB2 (also known as
ILT4). LILRB1 and LILRB2 broadly recognize MHC-I molecules through two binding
sites: one site interacts with the a3 domain of MHC-I heavy chain and another inter-
acts with b2M.74,75 Because the MHC-I a3 domain and b2M are highly conserved
across species, LILRB1 and LILB2 recognize both human classical (histocompatibility
leukocyte antigen [HLA]-A, -B, and -C) and non-classical (e.g., HLA-E and -G) MHC-
I.76,77 LILRB1 and LILB2 contain cytoplasmic ITIMs that recruit SHP1 and SHP2, which
mediate inhibition. LILRB1 is expressed by myeloid cells, B cells, subsets of CD8
T cells, and NK cells; LILRB2 is only expressed on myeloid cells.78 In vitro studies
demonstrated that deletion of MHC-I heavy chain or b2M in tumor cells or LILRB1
deletion in macrophages promotes tumor cell phagocytosis.79 In immunodeﬁcient
non-obese diabetic (NOD)-scid IL2Rgammanull mice, human MHC-I-deﬁcient tumors
were controlled more efﬁciently than MHC-I-expressing tumors. In C57BL/6 mice,
macrophages more effectively controlled tumors deﬁcient for both MHC-I and
CD47 than did their CD47- and/or MHC-I-expressing counterparts.79 Thus, concom-
itant blockade of CD47 and MHC-I can be a promising approach to promote macro-
phage phagocytosis of tumor cells. In contrast to LILRB1 blockade, LILRB2 blockade
did not enhance phagocytosis of tumor cells induced by anti-CD47 treatment
in vitro.79 Perhaps LILRB2 blockade does not facilitate macrophage phagocytosis
of tumor cells. However, anti-LILRB2 mAbs did enhance macrophage responses to
LPS in vitro, inducing TNF upregulation and IL-10 downregulation.80 In a mouse
model of lung cancer, anti-LILRB2 mAb treatment enhanced the response to
immune checkpoint therapy and skewed TAMs toward an immunostimulatory
phenotype.80 Thus, LILRB2 blockade may promote TAM reprogramming. The
mouse counterparts of LILRs are known as paired Ig-like receptors (PIRs).81,82 How-
ever, PIRs include only one inhibitory receptor that recognizes MHC-I, PIRB, which is
broadly expressed on hematopoietic cells. PIRB deﬁciency was associated with
reduced tumor growth in a lung cancer model. Myeloid cells isolated from tumor
bearing mice had an ‘‘M1-like’’ signature in the absence of PIRB, characterized by
increased expression of Nos2, Tnf, Il12, and Il1b and reduced expression of Arg1
and Il10. The discrepancy between the numbers of human and mouse genes encod-
ing inhibitory LILRs and PIRs remains a challenge for translating mouse studies to hu-
mans; analysis of humanized mice may be necessary to establish the impact of
LILRB1 and LILRB2 in vivo.83
CD24-SIGLEC10 pathway
CD24 is a highly glycosylated surface protein expressed on several solid tumors.
CD24 binds the inhibitory receptor SIGLEC10, a member of the Ig-like lectin family
speciﬁc for sialic acids.84 SIGLEC10 is expressed on B cells, macrophages, and den-
dritic cells and contains a cytoplasmic ITIM domain. The inhibitory effect of the

immunity, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.85–88 Recently, it was observed that
CD24 is more abundantly expressed in most tumor types than other ‘‘do not eat
me’’ molecules (CD47 and b2M) and is highly upregulated in ovarian cancer cells, tri-
ple-negative, estrogen-receptor-, and progesterone-receptor-positive breast can-
cer in comparison to the healthy tissue.89 Moreover, CD24 expression negatively
correlated with disease prognosis and TAMs expressed high levels of SIGLEC10.89
CD24 deletion in tumor cell lines and mAb blockade of CD24 promoted phagocy-
tosis of tumor cells in vitro; moreover, concomitant blockade of CD47 had a coop-
erative effect and enhanced phagocytosis. CD24 deﬁciency and CD24 targeting in
tumor models in vivo facilitated control of tumor growth by TAMs.89 A clinical trial
to test the safety and efﬁcacy of CD24 targeting has been developed based on
the administration of a fusion protein (CD24-Fc) in combination with anti-CTLA4
and anti-PD-1 in patients with metastatic melanoma, colon cancer, and renal cell car-
cinoma (NCT04060407).
PD-1-PD-L1 pathway
PD-1 has been extensively characterized as a T cell inhibitory receptor induced by
T cell activation that dampens effector functions.90 PD-L1 expressed in tumor cells
and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment has been shown to strongly inhibit
T cells, thereby promoting tumor immune escape.90 Accordingly, PD-1-PD-L1
blockade has proven very efﬁcacious in activating T cell responses in different co-
horts of cancer patients.91,92 Interestingly, it was recently reported that PD-1 is not
only expressed by T cells but also by other immune cells, including human and mu-
rine TAMs, and hence may have T-cell-independent functions.93 PD-1 expression in
TAMs increased during tumor progression in murine models and cancer patients and
was negatively associated with macrophage phagocytic activity.93 Moreover, PD-L1
was also expressed by TAMs. PD-1-PD-L1 blockade in vivo led to improved macro-
phage-dependent tumor control and increased phagocytosis of tumor cells in the
CT26 model of colorectal carcinoma and a model of osteosarcoma lung metasta-
ses.93,94 In murine models and patients with colorectal cancer, PD-1 expression in
TAMs correlated with expression of markers of immune suppression (e.g., CD206)
and weakened phagocytic potential.93 In vitro, anti-PD-L1 treatment promoted sur-
vival, proliferation, and activation of both human and murine macrophages, corrob-
orating that PD-1-PD-L1 blockade can have a direct effect on macrophages.95
Further supporting this conclusion, anti-PD-1 treatment has been widely reported
to affect macrophage function and polarization, mitigating their immunosuppres-
sive phenotype.96 However, it should be noted that the concomitant restoration
of T cell function and IFNg production by PD-1-PD-L1 blockade may have a consider-
able indirect effect on TAM phenotype, such that it is difﬁcult to dissect macro-
phage-intrinsic from macrophage-extrinsic effects of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in
many experimental settings.
Signaling and epigenetic mechanisms that promote immunosuppressive TAMs
PI3K gamma
PI3K is a lipid kinase consisting of a regulatory and a catalytic subunit that phosphor-
ylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate phosphatidylinositol
3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 recruits PH-domain-containing proteins, such as
AKT, to the membrane, which activates signaling cascades involved in cell growth,
survival, proliferation, motility, and morphology. PI3K impacts macrophage differen-
tiation and function.97 The gamma isoform of PI3K catalytic subunit (PI3Kg), which is
highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment, is a leukocyte-speciﬁc lipid kinase
and promotes a macrophage immunosuppressive phenotype.98 Genetic deletion or
pharmacological inhibition of PI3Kg in mouse tumor models broadly affected TAM

number and phenotype: expression of MHCII and production of pro-inﬂammatory
IL-12 increased, whereas expression of immunosuppressive markers (i.e., arginase,
CD206, and PD-L1) and secretion of anti-inﬂammatory IL-10 declined,99,100 as did
VEGF production and consequent neoangiogenesis.100 TAM reprogramming was
associated with enhanced T cell activation, T cell recruitment into the tumor, tumor
control, and response to anti-PD-1 in several models, including breast and lung can-
cer, as well as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.99 Given the efﬁcacy of PI3Kg
inhibitors in preclinical models, several strategies have been developed to inhibit
PI3Kg in the clinic. To date, ongoing clinical trials to target PI3Kg have tested the
PI3Kg inhibitor IPI-549 alone or in combination with adenosine receptor antagonists,
chemotherapy drugs (e.g., paclitaxel and doxorubicin), or anti-VEGF in triple-nega-
tive breast cancer, ovarian, and renal cancer patients. IPI-549 in combination with
anti-PD-1 has been tested in non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma, triple-negative breast cancer, bladder cancer, and urothelial carci-
noma (NCT03719326; NCT03961698; NCT02637531; NCT03980041). In a model
of pancreatic cancer, it was observed that protein-tyrosine kinase BTK induced
PI3Kg activation and immunosuppression in TAMs. Blockade of either BTK or
PI3Kg was protective in the model, and BTK blockade is currently under evaluation
in a clinical trial in pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients (NCT02052492).101
Histone deacetylases (HDACs)
HDACs are enzymes that mediate epigenetic regulation of gene expression by removal
of acetyl groups from an ε-N-acetyl lysine on histones.102 Abnormal HDAC expression
patterns occur in several types of cancer and correlate with survival disadvantage in pa-
tients. HDAC blockade has been shown to be a promising strategy to help control aber-
rant gene expression in tumors, and HDAC inhibitors have been tested in several clinical
trials.103 Some studies have speciﬁcally addressed the impact of HDAC inhibitors on
TAMs. TMP195 is an HDAC inhibitor that was shown to target TAMs and inhibit primary
tumor growth and lung metastatization in a breast cancer model. The administration of
TMP195 promoted monocyte recruitment and skewed macrophages toward a highly
phagocytic phenotype.103 MP195 treatment tempered TAM production of CCL2, a che-
moattractant for monocytes, whereas CCL1 production was elevated.104 TMP195 was
also tested in preclinical models in combination with chemotherapy or anti-PD-1 and
shown to enhance response to treatments.103 Treatment with HDAC inhibitors was
also associated with poor recruitment of immunosuppressive macrophage subsets to
the metastatic niche in preclinical models,105 suggesting that HDACs may have a bene-
ﬁcial effect in metastatic disease.
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
PGE2 is a product of arachidonic acid metabolism synthetized by the cyclo-oxygen-
ase (COX) enzymes. PGE2 is sensed by a family of G-coupled receptors (EP1–4) and
was reported to promote tumor growth by directly impacting tumor cell prolifera-
tion, survival, and migration. Moreover, PGE2 was shown to promote the establish-
ment of an immunosuppressive microenvironment by inhibiting T and NK cell
activation.106–108 TAMs express EP receptors,109 and there is growing evidence
that PGE2 signaling in TAMs can contribute to skewing toward a pro-tumoral pheno-
type.106 In a model of mammary carcinoma, EP-2-deﬁcient mice controlled tumors
better than wild-type (WT) controls, and this was associated with a reduction of
immunosuppressive myeloid cells. In vitro, it was observed that PGE2 can directly
impact bone marrow myeloid progenitors, driving the differentiation of suppressor
cells.109 Given the protective effect of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inﬂamma-
tory drugs that target PGE2 in cancer, macrophages may contribute to this effect.
Indeed, the treatment of tumor-bearing mice with a COX-2 inhibitor resulted in a

Review
lower tumor burden, and this was associated with proportionally fewer suppressive
myeloid cells.109 Recently, it was shown that PGE2 led to the enrichment of p50-nu-
clear factor kB (NF-kB) in monocyte-related MDSCs within tumors in a sarcoma
model; in turn, this engendered defective IFNg responsiveness and an immunosup-
pressive signature in the monocyte-related MDSCs.110 Furthermore, it was reported
that PGE2 might also contribute to macrophage recruitment into the tumor in a
mouse model of glioma; COX-2 inhibition was associated with lower CCL2 levels
in the tumor and consequent ineffectual accumulation of myeloid cells.111 Because
PGE2 acts on multiple cell types, it can have a broad effect in the tumor microenvi-
ronment; therefore, delineating the direct contribution of PGE2 sensing in TAMs
in vivo requires further investigation.
Reprogramming immunosuppressive TAMs through activating receptors
Certain cell surface receptors expressed on immunosuppressive TAMs can deliver
intracellular signals that override immunosuppression and skew TAMs toward immu-
nostimulation (Figure 4). Most of these receptors are not unique to macrophages
but are also expressed in other immune and non-immune cells. One prototypic
example is the TNF receptor family member CD40. Engagement of CD40 with
mAbs has been extensively tested and shown to induce activation and cytokine pro-
duction in dendritic cells (DCs), as well as enhancing their ability to sustain T cell acti-
vation. In a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model, a CD40 agonistic mAb stimu-
lated TAMs to secrete high amounts of MMP13, which degraded ﬁbrotic tissue and
facilitated control of tumor growth.112,113 Among several mAbs targeting CD40 tested
in clinical trials with promising outcomes, some were shown to have a direct effect on
TAMs. Activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) can also overcome TAM immunosuppres-
sion. Numerous TLR synthetic ligands have been tested in tumor models and clinical
studies, and some were shown to skew TAMs toward an anti-tumoral phenotype.114–
120 In a melanoma model, local treatment with a TLR7/TLR8 agonist was associated
with a modulation of macrophage phenotype that promoted tumor regression.121,122
Finally, the prototypic cytokine that drives M1-like macrophage polarization, IFNg, was
directly used to reprogram macrophages. In vivo administration IFNg was tested in tu-
mor models, and IFNg was injected intraperitoneally in patients with ovarian cancer,
leading to favorable responses associated with increased immune activation.123 One
important limitation of all described agonists of activating pathways is that they act
on multiple cells in addition to TAMs, causing non-speciﬁc side effects. Thus, it is likely
that these therapeutic agents may be used as adjuvants in combination with other ap-
proaches rather than stand-alone therapies.
One recently developed avenue to induce speciﬁc activation of TAMs is the transduc-
tion of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). CARs consist of a single-chain variable frag-
ment antibody speciﬁc for a tumor antigen, which is fused to a transmembrane domain
that anchors the antibody to the cell membrane, followed by intracellular domains that
transmit activation and costimulatory signals.124 Autologous T cells transduced with
CARs (CAR-Ts) acquire tumor speciﬁcity as well as signals that drive full T cell activation.
CAR-T cell therapy has been very effective in hematological malignancies, whereas suc-
cess in solid tumors has been limited.125 Macrophages may be a valid alternative to
T cells as recipient of CARs, becauseof their capacity to inﬁltrate tumors.Recent preclin-
ical studies have addressed the potential anti-tumor impact of macrophages
engineered to express a CAR targeting a tumor cell antigen (CAR-Ms).126 The human
macrophage cell line THP-1 was transduced with a ﬁrst-generation CAR targeting
CD19 and was shown to acquire high phagocytic potential against CD19+ K562 tumor
cells. Primary monocyte-derivedmacrophageswere alsoengineeredto express an anti-
HER2 CAR, which promoted phagocytosis of an HER2-expressing tumor cell line.126
ll

Review
In vivo, treatment with CAR-Ms was protective in a HER2+ ovarian cancer model.126,127
Interestingly, it was observed that, regardless of CAR expression, transduced macro-
phages displayed a pro-inﬂammatory phenotype that facilitated anti-tumor response,
perhaps reﬂecting an adjuvant effect.126 Given the promising results using CAR-Ms, it
will be important to test different tumor antigens.
Conclusions
As macrophage-targeting therapies are emerging as potential strategies to repro-
gram immunosuppressive TAMs, some important questions must be addressed.
Which molecules should be chosen as targets? Which patients might beneﬁt from
TAM reprogramming? Should TAM-based therapies be used alone or in combina-
tion with either checkpoint blockade therapies or chemotherapies? Answering these
questions requires a detailed knowledge of the TAM landscape in the tumor of inter-
est. Single-cell technologies developed in the last decade are providing a granular
view of the macrophage phenotypic proﬁles in many human tumors and mouse
models. One important result of these studies is the demonstration of the great het-
erogeneity of TAMs. Multiple factors can imprint TAMs, including the tumor type,
the tissue in which the tumor develops, and the presence of immune and stromal
cells within the tumor. A detailed knowledge of TAM phenotype and function will
help to stratify patients and choose the most appropriate TAM-oriented therapies.
Single-cell technologies can further boost the discovery of novel targets for immu-
notherapy and the identiﬁcation of TAM markers predictive of treatment outcome
and prognosis. Various studies have suggested that TAMs may have different ori-
gins: some may originate from resident macrophages that seed the tissue during
fetal hematopoiesis, whereas others may originate from bone-marrow-derived
blood monocytes.128 The recent development of fate map mice that can trace mac-
rophages of bone marrow origin based on the expression of membrane-spanning 4-
domains subfamily A member 3 (Ms4A3) will help delineate how the developmental
origin of TAMs inﬂuences their response to tumor growth.129 Given the burgeoning
availability of multi-omics data on the heterogeneous origins, phenotypes, and func-
tions of TAMs in human tumors, together with the data from clinical trials of TAM
therapies in combination with checkpoint blockade therapies, artiﬁcial intelli-
gence/machine learning analyses will be required to identify TAM pathways that
can be successfully targeted in human cancer.
It is predictable that future studies will also delve into investigation of the complex
and different mechanisms by which TAMs control immune responses, which remain
only partially understood. A recent study identiﬁed the tetraspanin MS4A4A as an
M2-like pro-tumoral marker that is induced in macrophages by IL-4 or glucocorticoid
hormones.130 In mouse metastasis models, MS4A4A deﬁciency in macrophages
impaired signaling of the surface receptor DECTIN1, which promotes the ability of
macrophages to activate NK cells. Thus, MS4A4A deﬁciency ultimately undermined
NK-cell-mediated resistance to metastases.130 In another study, APOE emerged as a
biomarker of prognosis and response to therapy in melanoma patients.131 Of the
three allelic APOE variants (APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4), APOE4 was associated
with attenuated disease progression and an improved response to anti-PD1. The
beneﬁcial effect of APOE4 on tumor control was recapitulated in a mouse model ex-
pressing the same human variant and was associated with fewer MDSCs in the tu-
mor. Remarkably, APOE is a TREM2 ligand, and both APOE and TREM2 variants
are genetically linked to Alzheimer’s disease.30 Thus, the role of APOE4 in tumors
may be linked to that of TREM2 in TAMs.131 We envision that the complexity of
mechanisms through which TAMs control anti-tumor immune responses will reﬂect
the diversity of TAMs inﬁltrating the tumors.
