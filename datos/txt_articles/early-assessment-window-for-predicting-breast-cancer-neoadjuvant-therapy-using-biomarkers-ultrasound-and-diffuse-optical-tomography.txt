Abstract
Purpose  The purpose of the study was to assess the utility of tumor biomarkers, ultrasound (US) and US-guided diffuse 
optical tomography (DOT) in early prediction of breast cancer response to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT).
Methods  This prospective HIPAA compliant study was approved by the institutional review board. Forty one patients were 
imaged with US and US-guided DOT prior to NAT, at completion of the first three treatment cycles, and prior to defini-
tive surgery from February 2017 to January 2020. Miller-Payne grading was used to assess pathologic response. Receiver 
operating characteristic curves (ROCs) were derived from logistic regression using independent variables, including: tumor 
biomarkers, US maximum diameter, percentage reduction of the diameter (%US), pretreatment maximum total hemoglobin 
concentration (HbT) and percentage reduction in HbT (%HbT) at different treatment time points. Resulting ROCs were 
compared using area under the curve (AUC). Statistical significance was tested using two-sided two-sample student t-test 
with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Logistic regression was used for ROC analysis.
Results  Thirty-eight patients (mean age = 47, range 24–71 years) successfully completed the study, including 15 HER2 + of 
which 11 were ER + ; 12 ER + or PR + /HER2−, and 11 triple negative. The combination of HER2 and ER biomarkers, 
%HbT at the end of cycle 1 (EOC1) and %US (EOC1) provided the best early prediction, AUC = 0.941 (95% CI 0.869–1.0). 
Similarly an AUC of 0.910 (95% CI 0.810–1.0) with %US (EOC1) and %HbT (EOC1) can be achieved independent of HER2 
and ER status. The most accurate prediction, AUC = 0.974 (95% CI 0.933–1.0), was achieved with %US at EOC1 and %HbT 
(EOC3) independent of biomarker status.
Conclusion  The combined use of tumor HER2 and ER status, US, and US-guided DOT may provide accurate prediction of 
NAT response as early as the completion of the first treatment cycle.

Introduction
Preoperative neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) for patients with 
locally advanced breast cancer downstages the tumor to 
facilitate breast conserving surgery, and allows in vivo 
assessment of therapeutic efficacy for tailored treatment 
approaches. Pathological response to NAT predicts clini-
cal outcome. An absence of residual invasive breast cancer 
cells, in the primary tumor bed and lymph nodes follow-
ing NAT is strongly correlated with improved disease-free 
survival and overall survival [1]. However, breast cancer is 
a heterogeneous disease; approximately 20–25% of breast 
cancers have amplification of the human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu), while 10–20% of breast 
cancers lack expression of estrogen receptor and progester-
one receptor and HER2 gene amplification, known as tri-
ple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Dual HER2 blockade 
in the neoadjuvant setting has been shown to increase the 
pathological complete response (pCR) rate in HER2 positive 
disease [2–4]. Despite this, there is a significant percentage 
of HER2 + patients who do not achieve a pCR or near pCR 
[5]. Those patients who have residual invasive breast cancer 
after HER2-targeted therapies have a worse prognosis [6]. 
Moreover, to date, no FDA-approved targeted therapies are 
available for early-stage TNBC patients and refining TNBC 
breast cancers into molecular subtypes still is a significant 
challenge in predicting NAT [7]. Thus, there is an unmet 
need for individual assessment before and during early NAC 
to guide treatment options by switching patients to other 
therapies to achieve optimal outcomes with reduced toxicity.
Many ongoing investigations are exploring imaging tech-
niques to monitor response. The use of imaging is appealing 
because it is non-invasive and may provide a window of 
opportunity wherein ineffective treatment regimens could be 
altered. Conventional imaging methods include mammogra-
phy, ultrasound (US), MRI and PET-CT. Mammography has 
low sensitivity in the evaluation of NAT response [8]. US is 
moderately accurate [9–12] and has the additional benefits 
of easy access and low cost. MRI and PET-CT have both 
demonstrated good accuracy in predicting pCR [13–15], 
however, both are cost prohibitive given the need for serial 
imaging evaluation.
Optical tomography and spectroscopy using near infra-
red (NIR) diffused light has been explored as a novel tool 
to predict and monitor tumor vasculature response to NAT 
[16–26]. The NIR technique utilizes intrinsic hemoglobin 
contrast, which is related to tumor angiogenesis. Recently 
studies have shown that pre-treatment total hemoglobin con-
centration (HbT) and changes in HbT measured at the early 
treatment cycles can predict treatment outcome [16–26]. 
Furthermore, the Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) can 
be easily integrated with ultrasound systems for dual-modal-
ity imaging assessment of breast cancer response to NAT. 
This manuscript reports a three-year prospective study of a 
considerable patient population evaluated with US and US-
guided DOT before, during, and after treatment completion 
in an attempt to identify the best and earliest predictors of 
pCR for HER2 + , ER + /HER2− and triple negative breast 
cancer subtypes.
Materials and methods
Patient
This prospective study was approved by the local institu-
tional review board and was HIPAA compliant. Sixty female 
patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer presenting to 
medical oncology at Washington University School of Medi-
cine from February 2017 to August 2019 for preoperative 
systemic therapy signed informed consent. Exclusion cri-
teria were given in Fig. 1 and fifteen patients were subse-
quently deemed ineligible and four patients withdrew. Of the 
remaining 41 patients, two developed metastases and did not 
complete the study and one had a contralateral abnormality 
preventing reference imaging. Data from these three patients 
were not included in the analysis. Thus 38 female patients 
(mean age = 47, range 24–71 years) constituted the study 
group and underwent US and US-guided DOT imaging of 
the index breast cancer prior to the initiation of NAT, at the 
end of the first three treatment cycles and before definitive 
surgery. Patients were treated with NAT regimens accord-
ing to current clinical practice or based on therapeutic trial 
protocols.
Baseline imaging was performed an average of 28 days 
after diagnostic core needle biopsy (median = 26, range 
7–56 days) and before the first treatment (median = 1 day, 
range 0–15 days). During treatment, imaging occurred 
before patient scheduled treatment (median = 0, range 
Breast Cancer Research and Treatment	
1 3
0–5 days). The average interval between post-treatment 
imaging and definitive surgery was 25 days (median 20, 
range 1–163 days).
US and US‑guided DOT imaging
Ultrasound and US-guided DOT examinations were com-
pleted in a breast imaging clinic with 4 commercial US units 
and associated US probes of SL15-4 (Aixplorer™, Super-
Sonic Imagine Inc., Aix-en-Provence, FR) and a 4th genera-
tion DOT system. Standard US was performed by one of 
four dedicated breast imaging radiologists with an average 
of 12 years of breast US experience (range 2–24 years) at 
study initiation. The index tumor was imaged in orthogonal 
planes and the maximum diameter was recorded. Prior US 
examinations were referenced during the exam to ensure 
consistency of measurements. The percentage ratio %US, 
largest dimension of each post-treatment time point over 
the largest dimension pretreatment, was used to evaluate the 
fraction reduction from NAT. After completion of the breast 
US examination, the commercial US probe was inserted into 
the DOT probe. The breast radiologist then directed the 
engineer to the index tumor site and assisted in US-guided 
DOT acquisition as needed.
Details of the 4th generation DOT system used for this 
trial have been previously reported [27]. Briefly, the US-
guided DOT hand-held probe consists of the commercial 
US transducer located centrally, with source and detector 
optical fibers distributed around the periphery (see Fig. 2). 
The entire data acquisition from 9 source positions and 14 
detectors was less than 4 s. For each patient, US images 
and optical measurements were acquired simultaneously of 
both the index tumor site and subsequently a normal region 
within the corresponding quadrant of the contralateral 
breast. Multiple datasets were acquired of the index tumor 
and contralateral reference site. The perturbation caused 
by tumor between the measurements of the tumor site and 
the reference site was used for image reconstruction. The 
measurements from the normal contralateral breast were 
used for calculating the background optical absorption and 
reduced scattering coefficients which were used for comput-
ing weight matrix for image reconstruction.
The US-guided DOT reconstruction algorithm has been 
reported [22, 28]. In brief, the DOT reconstruction uses 
ultrasound lesion identification to segment the imaging 
volume into a region of interest (ROI) and background to 
improve the inversion. The ROI is two to three times larger 
in spatial dimensions than the tumor size (as measured by 
co-registered US) due to the low spatial resolution of dif-
fused light. A tighter ROI in the depth dimension is set by 
using co-registered US. The pretreatment ROI is used for 
data processing of all time points, thereby minimizing the 
effect of treatment related changes in tumor size on the opti-
cal image reconstruction.
The optical absorption distribution at each wavelength 
was reconstructed, and the total hemoglobin concentration 
(HbT), oxygenated-hemoglobin (oxyHb) and deoxygenated-
hemoglobin concentration (deoxyHb) maps were computed. 
An average maximum value of HbT, oxyHb, and deoxyHb 
was obtained from 5 to 10 optical images reconstructed from 
each of the separate repetition of measurements acquired 
from the index tumor. Data with patient motion were rec-
ognized by using two co-registered US images before and 
after each optical data set and were excluded from averaging.

To assess each patient’s response, the HbT obtained before 
treatment was taken as the baseline and the percentage 
(%HbT) normalized to the baseline was used to quantita-
tively evaluate the remaining tumor vascular fraction during 
NAT.
Pathology assessment
Pathology data were extracted from pathology reports and 
from re-examination of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 
slides to complete missing data. One breast pathologist 
(SS, 10 years experience) evaluated cases from patients 
recruited between February 2017 to May 2019 and the 
second breast pathologist (ISH, 7 years experience) evalu-
ated the rest. Response to NAT in each surgical resection 
specimen was graded using Miller-Payne (MP) criteria 
[29], with comparison to initial core biopsy when nec-
essary. There are five MP grades based on reduction in 
tumor cellularity: Grade 1—no change or minor alteration 
in individual malignant cells but no reduction in overall 
cellularity. Grade 2—minor (up to 30%) loss of tumor cells 
but overall cellularity remains high. Grade 3—estimated 
30% to 90% reduction in tumor cells. Grade 4—marked 
(> 90%) disappearance of tumor cells or near pCR. Grade 
5—no malignant cells are identifiable in sections from 
the tumor bed (pCR). The MD Anderson residual cancer 
burden (RCB) was calculated based on the primary tumor 
bed, overall cancer cellularity, in situ disease, number of 
positive lymph nodes and diameter of the largest lymph 
node metastasis [30]. Since US and US-guided DOT were 
performed on the index tumor, the MP grading system was 
used to evaluate pathological response and RCB was used 
as a reference for MP grade.
Invasive carcinoma within the pretreatment core biop-
sies was graded using the Nottingham histologic score 
(NS). Testing for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone 
receptor (PR), and HER2/neu (c-erbB-2) expression was 
performed by immunohistochemistry by an FDA-approved 
method on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pretreatment 
core biopsy tissue. The ER and PR were scored by Allred 
scoring system [31], where the total score ranges from 0 
to 8 (scores ≥ 3 are positive). HER2 was scored in accord-
ance with 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines. Cases with equiv-
ocal HER2 immunostaining were reflexed to fluorescence 
in situ hybridization (FISH).
Statistical analysis
Generalized Logistic Regression (Eq. 1) was used to relate 
treatment outcomes to individual predictor variables for 
ROC analysis [32]. Briefly, logistic regression describes 
the relationship of several predictor variables X1, X2… Xk 
to a dichotomous response variable Y (1: responder, 0: 
non-responder). The model can be written in the form of 
the conditional probability of the occurrence of one of the 
two possible outcomes of Y, as follows:
Given the data on Y, X1, … Xk, the unknown parameters 훽n , 
n = 0, 1, …k can be estimated using the maximum likelihood 
method and an ROC is obtained from the regression output.
Spearman is a rank based Pearson and is used for continu-
ous or ordinal variables [32]. Because binary predictor vari-
ables can be viewed as special ordinal variables, Spearman’s 
rho correlation coefficient is used for assessing predictors in 
our study. Each predictor was first correlated with the MP 
grade using Spearman’s rho to assess its predictive value. 
The t-test was used to evaluate the statistical significance 
and P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. For 
each pair of significant predictors, a correlation between the 
two predictors was evaluated using Spearman’s rho. The cor-
related predictors with Spearman’s rho greater than 0.6 were 
not used together for ROC analysis. Minitab 19 software 
(Minitab, State College, PA) was used for ROC and sta-
tistical calculations. The 95% confidence interval (CI) of 
each ROC was computed in R using the pROC package. To 
evaluate the significance of different ROCs with different 
sets of predictors, we used a function deltaAUC in R, which

was specially designed to compare AUCs with overlapping 
predictors [33].
When comparing %HbT and %US at different treatment 
cycles, the Bonferroni-Holm correction was applied to 
obtain the corrected P value as Pc(i) = (n − i + 1) × P(i) < α, 
where α is 0.05, n is 3 which corresponds to the first three 
treatment cycles. i starts from 1 (corresponding to the small-
est P value) to 3 (corresponding to the largest P value).
In Online Appendix, we developed treatment prediction 
models using a supervised machine learning method based 
on logistic regression (Eq. 1). Data of 38 patients reported 
in this study and 22 patients acquired in an earlier study with 
similar DOT system parameters, patient and treatment char-
acteristics [19] were used to train and then test the prediction 
models for generalizing the models [34].
Results
Table 1 summarizes patient and tumor characteristics, NAT 
regimens and MP grading. The histologic type of 35 patients 
was invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type; one patient 
had invasive mucinous carcinoma, one patient had invasive 
lobular carcinoma and one patient had invasive mammary 
carcinoma with mixed ductal and lobular features. One of 
the 38 patients had multi-focal disease consisting of three 
adjacent distinct tumor masses with identical histology. For 
this patient, the largest of the three masses was used for data 
analysis. Fifteen patients were HER2 + , 11 were triple-neg-
ative (TNBC), and 12 were ER + /HER2 − (n = 10) or PR + /
HER2 − (n = 2). Eight patients had stage 3 disease, 27–stage 
2, and 3–stage 1. For the three patients with stage 1 disease, 
two had HER2 + tumors, and one had high grade TNBC. 
Based upon MP grade, 5 patients had no response (pNR) 
(MP1), 11 patients had a partial response (pPR), including 
3 with a minor response (MP2) and 8 with an intermediate 
response (MP3), while 3 had a near pCR (MP4) and 19 had 
a pCR (MP5). Tumor characteristics, US and optical param-
eters were correlated to MP grades using the Spearman’s 
rho correlation (Table 2). We have dichotomized MP1-3 to 
non- or incomplete response, referred as non-responders, 
MP4-5 to complete response, referred as complete respond-
ers. Spearman’s rho correlation coefficients of all pairs of 
treatment prediction variables were given in Table 3.
HER2 + and ER + /HER2– status was significantly asso-
ciated with MP-grade (P = 0.039, P = 0.036), while Not-
tingham grade and TNBC were not predictive (P = 0.115, 
P = 0.138). Pretreatment maximum tumor size measured 
by US was predictive (P = 0.011). MP1–3 had a baseline 
maximum of 34.4 mm ± 12.8 mm, vs. 26.9 mm ± 10.9 mm 
for MP4–5, but the difference between the two responder 
groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.066). Reduc-
tion in tumor size %US at the end of each of the first three 
cycles was predictive of MP-grade (P = 0.005, P = 0.045, 
P = 0.013), especially at EOC1. Post-treatment %US was 
not predictive (P = 0.111), however, post-treatment tumor 
size was (P = 0.012). Pretreatment HbT correlated with 
MP–grade (P = 0.028), while oxyHb and deoxyHb were not 
(P = 0.091, P = 0.132). Reduction in HbT (%HbT) showed 
the strongest correlation with MP–grade at the end of each 
of the first three cycles (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001). 
Post-treatment %HbT also showed a strong correlation with 
MP–grade (P = 0.007).
Figure  3 demonstrates the HbT, reduction in HbT, 
%HbT, and reduction in tumor size, %US, over the first 
three treatment cycles. Bonferroni-Holm correction was 
applied to adjust for multiple comparisons of %HbT and 
%US over treatment cycles. There was a significant differ-
ence in pretreatment mean maximum HbT between MP4-5 
(85.9 µM ± 20.0) vs. MP1-3 (71.3 µM ± 19.1) (P = 0.029) 
(Fig.  3a). However, there was no difference at EOC1 
or EOC2 (P = 0.870, P = 0.194) because the mean HbT 
level decreased at a faster rate in complete responders. At 
EOC3 complete responders had a significantly lower HbT 
(P = 0.001). The faster rate of reduction is best visualized 
in Fig. 3b. MP4–5 tumors decreased rapidly to 78% (of 
baseline)± 18.9, 64.2%± 18.5, 48.2 ± 13.8 at EOC1, EOC2 
and EOC3, respectively, whereas MP1–3 tumors changed 
minimally to 97.3%± 22.6 (EOC1), 88.7%± 22.9 (EOC2), 
and 89.0%± 26.4(EOC3). The differences between the two 
groups were increasingly significant as treatment progressed 
through the first three cycles; Pc = 0.012 (EOC1), Pc = 0.008 
(EOC2) and Pc < 0.001 (EOC3), respectively.
The %US measurements showed a similar trend. The 
reduction in diameter was significant with reduction rate of 
74.8%± 17.8, 61.8%± 28.3, 52.4%± 29.4 in MP4-5 tumors 
and 96.5%± 17.8, 82.4%± 23.7 and 74.7%± 23.5 in MP1-3 
tumors, respectively (Fig. 3c). The differences between 
the two groups were significant with Pc = 0.003 (EOC1), 
Pc = 0.028 (EOC2), Pc = 0.040 (EOC3), respectively.
Examples of a treatment responder and a non-responder 
are shown in Figs. 4 and 5.
We performed ROC analyses using logistic regression 
(Eq. 1) to identify the best early predictors of response 
(MP4-5) at different treatment time points, EOC1–3. AUCs 
are tabulated (Table 4) with and without predictive bio-
marker status of ER and HER2, and subsets ROCs shown 
graphically in Fig. 6 with generalized logistic regression 
parameters, 훽n, given in Table 5. As noted above HER2 
and ER status were shown to predict treatment response 
without other imaging parameters (AUC = 0.773, 95% CI 
0.629–0.917). When added to ER and HER2 status, %US 
at EOC1 noticeably improves the AUC (AUC = 0.883, 
95% CI 0.768–0.997). Similarly, the addition of HbT and 
%HbT to biomarker status substantially increases the AUC 
(AUC = 0.903, 95% CI 0.808–0.998). While each parameter

is independently helpful, the combination of %US and 
%HbT is most effective in enhancing the prediction. The 
combination of predictive biomarkers, %US and %HbT at 
EOC1 provides the best prediction of response at the earliest 
time point, AUC = 0.941 (95% CI 0.869–1.0), which is sig-
nificant when compared with biomarkers and %US at EOC1 
(P < 0.001). The greatest AUC of any time during early treat-
ment (AUC = 0.974, 95% CI 0.932–1.0) is achieved through 
the combination of predictive biomarkers, %US (EOC1) and 
%HbT (EOC3), which is also significant when compared 
with biomarkers and %US at EOC1 (P < 0.001). Even in 
the absence of ER and HER2 status, the identical maxi-
mum AUC is achieved (AUC = 0.974, 95% CI 0.933–1.0) 
using %US (EOC1) and %HbT (EOC3), with only slight 
diminution at the earliest time point, i.e. %US (EOC1) and 
%HbT (EOC1), AUC = 0.910 (95% CI 0.810–1.0). The AUC 
improvements of adding %HbT (EOC1) and %HbT (EOC3) 
to %US (EOC1) is statistically significant (P < 0.001). Note 
that MP–grade and RCB are highly correlated, Spearman’s 
rho = 0.941 (P < 0.001). To develop a generalizable predic-
tion model we have combined data from the 38 patients in

Discussion
In current clinical practice, clinical breast examination, 
mammography, US, MRI, and PET-CT have been used to 
evaluate response in patients receiving NAT. Because of low 
cost and accessibility, US has been evaluated in several stud-
ies [9–12]. In a related study, Marinovich et al. evaluated 
832 patients who underwent US at EOC2 and demonstrated 
an average increase in AUCs of 2% and 3% to 0.79 and 0.80 
respectively, with the addition of US to patient characteris-
tics including biomarkers [9]. In this study, we found that 
the fractional change of US maximum diameter (%US), 
measured at EOC1 (AUC = 0.83), was more predictive than 
EOC2 (AUC = 0.68). We further showed a substantial 11% 
increase, AUC = 0.77 to 0.88 at EOC1, in patients with 
known ER + or HER2 + disease. Our data show that early 
US measurements at EOC1 can substantially avoid meas-
urement uncertainty as seen by smaller standard deviations 
of %US at EOC1 as compared to those at EOC2 and EOC3 
for both responder and non-responder groups. In a recent 
paper, Dobruch-Sobczak et al. reported a series study of 
assessing US echogenicity, size, and other parameters of 
19 tumors under NCT before treatment and after 7 days of 
each treatment course for up to 4 cycles [35]. They found 
that tumor echogenicity gradually increased from initially 
hypoechoic (all tumors) to mixed (hypo/isoechoic) and iso-
echoic tumors at a rate of 16% (3/19), 63% (12/19), 68% 
(13/19) and 72% (13/18) after each course of NCT. This 
texture change was caused by NCT-induced apoptosis of 
tumor cells, fibrosis, collagenization, and microcalcification. 
Tumor size was statistically significant between responders 
and non-responders after the first course (P = 0.018) but not 
at the second (P = 0.102) and the third course (P = 0.149). In 
another study, Matsuda et al. reported similar echogenicity 
changes during NCT but data were available only at the end 
of treatment cycle 4 [36]. We have observed a similar tread 
in echogenicity change as reported in [35] which increased 
uncertainty in US size measurements. Thus an optimal pre-
diction window of NCT by %US could be as early as com-
pletion of one treatment cycle.
Diffuse optical tomography exploits changes in tumor 
vascularity and metabolism and have demonstrated the 
potential for early prediction of breast cancer pathological 
response [18–26]. Studies have shown accurate predictions 
in the neoadjuvant setting by utilizing pretreatment hemo-
globin levels and changes in hemoglobin early in the course 
of treatment [19, 21–26], or by monitoring changes of blood 
oxygen saturation sO2 at day 1 of dose dense treatment [18] 
or day 10 during early treatment [20]. In the recent ACRIN 
6691 trial evaluating 36 patients, the authors derived a tis-
sue optical index (TOI), a product of deoxygenated Hb and 
water concentration over lipid, and reported that the mid-
treatment TOI can predict pCR with AUC 0.6 to 0.83 [16]. 
Gunther et al. developed a dynamic diffuse optical tomog-
raphy system that could identify patients with a pCR two 
weeks into the treatment with AUC = 0.85 [17]. In an ear-
lier investigation of 22 patients [19], Zhu et al. identified 
HER2 status and HbT as the best pretreatment predictors of 
pCR (AUC = 0.88). With known HER2 positivity, the best 
window to accurately predict response was at the comple-
tion of the first and second cycles of NAT (AUC = 0.96, 
AUC = 0.97). For ER + /HER2- or TNBC subtype, the best 
window was at the completion of the first cycle of NAT and 
the best predictors were HbT and %HbT (AUC = 0.95).
In this new cohort of 38 patients, “HER2, ER and pre-
treatment HbT” has shown good prediction, AUC = 0.80 and 
“HbT alone” has shown moderate prediction AUC = 0.71. 
However, fractional reduction of HbT (%HbT) is a much 
more powerful predictor of response, as is fractional reduc-
tion of maximum diameter measured with US (%US) in 
the first three cycles. For chemo-sensitive tumors, NCT-
induced neovasculature damage causes a significant and 
progressive decrease in tumor hemoglobin, as measured by 
the DOT system, and NCT-induced tumor tissue damage 
causes a significant size reduction, as measured by US. In 
particular, combining tumor HER2 and ER status, %US and 
%HbT at EOC1 provided the best early indicator of treat-
ment response, AUC = 0.941, and remained powerful even 
without biomarker data, AUC = 0.910. With the assessment 
window extended to EOC3, the combination of %US EOC 
3 and %HbT EOC3 provided accurate prediction, with AUC 
values of 0.969 with biomarker data and 0.944 without it. 
Overall, the highest accuracy, AUC = 0.974, was achieved 
with the combination of %US EOC1 and %HbT at EOC3, 
irrespective of biomarker status. To our knowledge, these 
AUC values are among the highest reported results using 
NAT regimens in current clinical practice.
The US-guided DOT has low intrinsic cost and is easily 
adaptable to clinical US systems. Disadvantages include: 
US-guided DOT imaging is not real-time and reconstruction 
currently takes 20 to 30 min. US-guided DOT is not suit-
able for imaging tumors in the dark nipple-areolar complex, 
and requires a sonographically visible tumor and normal 
contralateral reference tissue. Our study has a number of 
limitations. The treatment regimens were based on cur-
rent practice at a research institution and were not limited 
to a single regimen. The choice of systemic therapies for 
breast cancer patients are based on multiple factors, includ-
ing tumor biology, stage, patient characteristics and wishes, 
clinical trial availability. The study population was not large 
(n = 38) and to develop supervised machine learning predic-
tion models detailed in Online Appendix, we included data

from 22 patients from an earlier study with similar study 
criteria and patient characteristics [19]. Similar results were 
obtained. Only one patient was treated with an antiestrogen 
regimen, i.e. anastazole, in our study cohort. Due to the lim-
ited sample size, we have grouped this patient with the rest 
of the patients and used pCR as surrogate endpoint.
In our previous work, we dichotomized our comparison 
groups as pCR and near pCR (MP4-5) versus non-respond-
ers (MP1-3) [19, 21, 22]. In this report, we have used the 
same comparison groups with the rationale given as follows: 
In the original study by Ogston [29] the MP 5 and 4 groups 
tended to track together with regard to 5 year disease free 
survive (DFS) after NCT and surgery (85% and 72%) ver-
sus 66%, 60% and 55% (for MP1-3). Later Zhao et al. [37], 
evaluating the MP system using a different dataset found 
very similar 5 year distant DFS and local recurrence-free 
survival rates for MP4-5 versus MP1-3. In a recent study, 
Sejben et al. [38] using the RCB system and another sepa-
rate dataset also found the similar 5-year DFS for pCR and 
near-pCR (RCB-1) (85.2% and 84.4%) versus 58.2 and 
33.0 for RCB-2 and RCB-3 and 5-year overall survival for 
pCR and near-pCR (94.4 and 87.7) versus 61.8 and 69.0 for 
RCB-2 and RCB-3 (RCB-2, partial response and RCB-3, 
chemoresistant).
Our study has substantial implications for the combined 
use of tumor subtypes, US and near-infrared-measured 
tumor hemoglobin content in accurately predicting pCR as 
soon as one treatment cycle is completed. A recently phase 
3, open-label trial involving patients with HER2-positive 
early breast cancer who were found to have residual invasive 
disease has shown that adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine for 
14 cycles reduced the risk of recurrence of invasive breast 
cancer or death by 50% as compared with trastuzumab alone 
[6]. Another trial of 910 HER2-negtive residual invasive 
breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
showed that adjuvant capecitabine was safe and effective in 
prolonging disease-free survival and overall survival [39]. If 
the residual disease could be accurately estimated earlier in 
the NCT, patients with an unsatisfactory response could be 
switched to investigational therapies or even definitive sur-
gery as soon as cycle 1 is completed, allowing for personal-
ized treatment. This ability will gain value as our armamen-
tarium of interventions increases and responses can more 
effectively tailor the therapeutic agents selected.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our results suggest that the combination of 
HER2 and ER status, %HbT at the end of cycle 1 (EOC1) 
and %US (EOC1) accurately predict NAT (AUC = 0.941), 
and %HbT (EOC1) and %US (EOC1) predict NAT 
(AUC = 0.910) regardless of HER2 and ER status. A greater 
prediction accuracy can be achieved with AUC of 0.974 
regardless of biomarkers when the treatment window is 
extended to EOC3. The synergistic use of US and US-guided 
DOT may provide a safe and low-cost strategy to accurately 
predict NAT outcomes early in the course of therapy.
