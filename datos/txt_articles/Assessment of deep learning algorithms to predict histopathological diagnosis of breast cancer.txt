Abstract 
Objective:  Breast cancer is a critical public health issue and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women 
worldwide. Its early diagnosis and detection can effectively help in increasing the chances of survival rate. For this rea-
son, the diagnosis and classification of breast cancer using Deep learning algorithms have attracted a lot of attention. 
Therefore, our study aimed to design a computational approach based on deep convolutional neural networks for 
an efficient classification of breast cancer histopathological images by using our own created dataset. We collected 
overall 328 digital slides, from 116 of surgical breast specimens diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma of non-
specific type, and referred to the histopathology department of the National Institute of Oncology in Rabat, Morocco. 
We used two models of deep neural network architectures in order to accurately classify the images into one of three 
categories: normal tissue-benign lesions, in situ carcinoma or invasive carcinoma.
Results:  Both Resnet50 and Xception models achieved comparable results, with a small advantage to Xception 
extracted features. We reported high degrees of overall correct classification accuracy (88%), and sensitivity (95%) for 
detection of carcinoma cases, which is important for diagnostic pathology workflow in order to assist pathologists 
for diagnosing breast cancer with precision. The results of the present study showed that the designed classification 
model has a good generalization performance in predicting diagnosis of breast cancer, in spite of the limited size of 
the data. To our knowledge, this approach can be highly compared with other common methods in the automated 
analysis of breast cancer images reported in literature.

Introduction
According to the World Health Organization, Breast 
cancer (BC) constitutes the first major cause of women’s 
death [1]. In Morocco, 11,747 of women’s new cases with 
BC were diagnosed during the last year. It represented 
about 19.8% of all new cancer cases and 38.9% of all can-
cers in women [2].
Around the world, we are faced with an exponential 
increase in cancer cases, growing numbers of patients 
from an aging population, and a shortage of trained 
pathologists [3]. Moreover, there is a need for accuracy 
in histopathologic diagnosis of BC as patient demand 
for accurate diagnostics and personalized therapy is

increasing [4, 5]. Therefore, the trend towards digiti-
zation of pathology data has opened the door to faster, 
more precise and more reproducible diagnosis through 
computerized image analysis [6].
In addition, this will revolutionize the laborious work 
of the pathologist, which is often repetitive and time con-
suming, causing significant intra and inter-observer vari-
ability [7, 8]. Facing these issues, it is urgent to develop an 
automatic and an accurate histopathological image analy-
sis methods, especially classification tasks.
Recently, we have witnessed groundbreaking improve-
ments in digital pathology (DP) and artificial intelligence 
(AI), promising to change the way we detect and treat BC 
in the near future [9]. The most promising advance in AI 
is Machine learning (ML), and particularly Deep learning 
(DL) [10]. In breast pathology, convolutional Neural Net-
works (CNNs) are favoring deep learning approaches for 
BC classification and detection [11, 12].
In this paper, we present a classification approach for 
predicting diagnosis of breast cancer on slide digitized 
pathology images, using jointly deep CNNs for feature 
extraction and gradient boosted trees for classification. 
Then, we discuss the results and compare our frame-
work to several state-of-the-art approaches using similar 
methods.

Methods
Study description
The study was prospectively performed in the histopa-
thology department of the National Institute of Oncology 
in Rabat, over a period of 6 months from January 2020 to 
June 2020, involving 116 breast surgical specimens. Only 
diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma (IBC) of non spe-
cific type was included on all breast surgical specimens. 
All diagnoses of IBC of a specific type, as well as tumors 
lysed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded.
In this study, the tumor tissue samples were stained 
with hematoxylin–eosin (HE), photographed at 200× 
equivalent magnification, and exported to jpeg format 
using olympus cellsens entry software. This process was 
performed by one pathologist, at light microscopy, using 
Olympus BX43, coupled with camera DX73. Further-
more, two qualified consultant breast pathologists; com-
pleted a brief training in use of the digital microscopy 
system, were recruited to participate in the validation 
study.
Dataset collection
We collected overall 328 HE stained images. Each 
image is labeled with one of three classes (Fig. 1): inva-
sive carcinoma (IC) (group 2); in-situ carcinoma (IS-
C) (group 1) and benign: benign lesions and or normal 
tissue (group 0). The labeling was performed by two 
pathologists, who only provided diagnostic information 
from the image contents, without specifying the area of 
interest for the classification.
Proposed methodology
When a pathological image with high resolution 
(2048 × 1536 pixels) is input, our goal is to accurately 
classify the image into one of three categories: nor-
mal or benign, IS-C and IC. To achieve this, we have 
proposed and tested a method for BC classification 
inspired from the experimental protocol proposed by 
Alexander Rakhlin et al. [13]. In our work, each phase is 
described in the following subsection:
Data pre‑processing and augmentation
Input Dataset is composed of 328 original images, 
which sized 1024 × 768 at 200× equivalent magnifica-
tion. Before preforming images augmentation, origi-
nal images are resized by dividing the initial size in 
two in order to accelerate the later operations. After 
a color normalization step, we performed 40 random 
color augmentations for each image. The augmenta-
tion consists of an affine transformation of the input 
images pixel intensities that allowed us to multiply the 
size of the dataset by 40. Consequently, each image 
was used to generate 20 randomly extracted patches of 
a fixed size (750 × 750), lately processed by the CNNs 
(Fig. 2A).

Features extraction
For our use case, we opted for two Deep CNNs architec-
tures: ResNet50 and Xception models. These two mod-
els are pre-trained on the ‘ImageNet’ Dataset, available 
for public usage, and which contains more than 1  mil-
lion images or about 150  GB of annotated images of 
several categories. Both models will be used to compute 
a descriptor vector for each crop. The feature vectors of 
the 20 crops of a single image will be combined through 
a pooling operation to generate one feature vector per 
image (Fig. 2B).
Machine learning classification
We performed a supervised classification using XGBoost 
model. It is an optimized distributed gradient boosting 
library, which can be efficiently executed on a GPU sta-
tion (Graphics Processing Unit), to allow a quick training 
and evaluation of the model. In fact, gradient boosting 
models are being extensively used in machine learn-
ing due to their speed, accuracy, and robustness against 
overfitting.
Evaluation metrics
To validate our approach, we used a cross-validation 
method. The augmented images that were extracted from 
the same original image were placed in the same fold to 
prevent information leakage. We used a sixfold cross 
validation strategy, leading to accuracy metric for each 
fold and then an average global accuracy. Due to a very 
limited number of images we had for this study, we did 
not manage to have an additional separate test set. In 
our work, we computed a prediction for each augmented 
image then combined the decision made for the 40 aug-
mentations through a voting strategy, in order to com-
pute a unique prediction for each image. In addition, we 
evaluated the performances for two scenarios, each one 
corresponding to a CNN architecture of features extrac-
tion. We also compared actual class and predicted results 
obtained using a confusion matrix.
Results
We have extracted 328 images from HE stained digital 
slides, among which 152 were non-carcinoma and 176 
were carcinoma images. The carcinoma class included 
images of IC and IS-C while the non-carcinoma class 
contained images of normal tissues as well as benign 
lesions. In our study, we performed multi-class classifi-
cation into three classes: groupe 0 (benign): 152 images, 
groupe 1 (IS-C): 70 images, and groupe 2 (IC): 106 
images. Given the results of this classification system, we 
computed the corresponding metrics for a binary classifi-
cation case and a multi-class classification case.
We obtained the following results by performing a six-
folds cross validation approach, training on 273 images 
and testing on 55 images, during 6 rounds. (Table 1).
ResNet 50 model
The Resnet50 model had correctly predicted 277 out 
of 328 instances; 142 benign instances were effectively 
benign, 85 IC were actually invasive, and 50 instances

were correctly predicted as IS-C), while 51 cases were 
misclassified. In terms of 3-class classification, majority 
voting showed good results, achieving an overall accu-
racy of 84.5% for three classes.
We also reported that overall accuracy increases 
when only two classes (non-carcinoma and carcinoma) 
are considered (84.5 vs. 90%). This indicates that the 
normal/benign and in situ/invasive classes share simi-
lar features. In addition, this proposed model achieved 
an overall sensitivity of 93% for carcinoma classifica-
tion, which means that our classifier was very good at 
detecting cancer.
Xception model
For instance, among 152 normal cases, 144 were cor-
rectly classified as normal, only 4 were wrongly classified 
as IC and 4 IS-C were missed. We also noticed that the 
Xception network achieved a maximum overall accuracy 
of 88% for three classes, slightly bigger than the Resnet50 
model.
In comparison with Resnet50, the Xception model 
showed high classification results for the binary clas-
sifications for all the evaluation metrics, as well as 
3-class classifications. Additionally, we reported a high 
sensitivity (95%) for carcinoma cases, which have a great 
significance in the diagnostic pathology workflow.
Discussion
DP and AI in breast pathology
The automation of BC diagnosis is essential and 
requires digitalization of the histological slides using 
the whole-slide imaging (WSI) system [14], which 
could assist pathologists to improve the accuracy of 
diagnostic processes [15].
DP had the potential to transform the way in which 
pathology services are delivered across the globe. 
Indeed, it made telepathology consultation between 
expert pathologists easier [16], provide tools for a more 
efficient workflow and higher reproducibility [17], 
especially in challenging situations such as COVID-
19 pandemic. The goal of DP is not to take over the 
pathologist’s work, but to improve accuracy and reduce 
human error [18].
However, laboratories with integrated DP workflows 
are still sparse nowadays. In Morocco, as a developing 
country, we are the first one to introduce AI in routine 
pathology workflow.
In breast pathology, rapid advances in AI along with 
the growing DP are a promising approach to meet the 
urgent need for more accurate detection, classification

and prediction [19]. Actually, ML and DL algorithms 
have been widely successful and showed a high perfor-
mance in terms of BC diagnosis, prognosis, and response 
to treatment [20–23].
Moreover, several studies highlights the usefulness of 
AI in the practice of breast pathology [6, 15]. In term of 
diagnosis, DL approaches had already been applied to 
detect malignant breast tumors from benign and normal 
structures, as well as diagnosis of lymph node metastasis 
[20]. Other algorithms were developed to assess breast 
cancer grade (tubular formation, nuclear pleomorphism, 
mitotic figures) and histologic subtypes. They have been 
also used for automated biomarker scoring [Ki-67, Oes-
trogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and 
human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)] [23].
In addition to diagnosis setting, DL methods were used 
to predict patient prognosis [tumour-infiltrating lympho-
cytes (TILs), risk of disease recurrence (Oncotype DX)] 
and response to specific therapy based on the morpho-
logical features [22].
Comparison with the state‑of‑the‑art
First of all, it is worth mentioning that there are 
few Moroccan studies who have proposed different 
approaches [24, 25], performed by biomedical engineers 
and data scientists, for BC diagnosis using ML on pub-
lic dataset. Yet to know, our experience is the first one, 
as pathologists, that successfully assesses AI-algorithms 
for an automated diagnosis of BC using binary and multi-
class classifications in one research work, based on our 
private single dataset.
The effectiveness of our proposed DL approach can be 
compared with various state-of-the-art studies used for 
the classification of BC histopathology images. Most of 
these studies are based on publicly available dataset [26–
30]. Meanwhile, most medical image datasets are usually 
much smaller because of patient privacy issues and the 
need for expert annotation and labelling [4]. In our study, 
we used our own created dataset, which has a limited size 
compared to public image datasets.
The experimental results showed state-of-the-art test-
ing accuracy for BC detection as compared to exist-
ing methods. For instance, for Spanhol et  al. [31], the 
achieved accuracy was approximately 84%. In our work, 
the overall accuracy is 84% when using ResNet50 and 
88% with Xception. In comparison with the previous 
work, our methods present similar performances, even 
though our training was performed considering 3 classes. 
Besides, the used dataset contains approximately 2000 
images for the referred magnification, which is a sig-
nificantly larger training set. Moreover, the previous 
study images were selected in such a way that only rel-
evant regions for diagnosis were present, while in our 
case some patches in the training and testing sets may 
not contain the most relevant information to be cor-
rectly classified, which can lower the accuracy in term of 
classification.
In the work of Araujo et  al. [32], authors reported 
a level of accuracy of 77.8% for 4-class and 83.3% for 
binary-classification. The sensitivity of their method for 
cancer cases achieved 95.6%. At the same time, our pro-
posed classification allowed us to obtain a high sensitiv-
ity for carcinoma cases, which have a great significance in 
the diagnostic pathology workflow, as the harm resulting 
from a false negative (patient remains without diagnosis) 
is much more detrimental than a false positive (patient 
undergoes additional procedures and treatments such as 
chemotherapy). In addition, we achieved a high degree 
of accuracy i.e. 90% (Resnet 50) and 91% (Xception) for 
binary-classification tasks.
Conclusions
In this paper, we proposed a simple and effective method 
for the classification of HE stained histological BC images 
in case of very small training data (328 samples). To 
increase the robustness of the classifier we opted for a 
hybrid pipeline and used strong data augmentation and 
deep convolutional features extracted with publicly avail-
able pre-trained CNNs. In term of classification task, our 
results revealed a good discriminatory power either for 
the differentiation between benign and malignant or to 
classify their three sub-categories.
Limitations
Although the presented work has clearly demonstrated 
the powerful classification capacity of AI-algorithms in 
term of BC histopathology images, we were challenged 
by the limited size of the dataset which can leads to over-
fitting. Therefore, to circumvent this issue we opted for a 
hybrid pipeline and strong data augmentation.
Currently, we are working on the extension of our data-
set with other pathology laboratories as well as detection 
of invasive BC of a specific type in order to improve the 
accuracy of classification. Moreover, our project for the 
implementation of the WSI system is boosting the BC 
diagnostic workflow. In our future work, we intend to 
use and evaluate other CNNs pretrained models for the 
features extraction stage, and extend the application usa-
bility to other types of cancer, such as colorectal, lung or 
prostate cancer.
