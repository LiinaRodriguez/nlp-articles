In the evolving landscape of cancer treatment, therapeutic peptides are assuming to play an increasingly vital 
role. Although the number of peptide drugs available for clinical cancer treatment is currently limited, extensive 
preclinical research is underway, presenting a promising trajectory for the future. The collaborative efforts of 
natural anti-cancer peptides (ACPs) and synthetic ACPs, propelled by advancements in molecular biology and 
peptide chemistry, are steering remarkable progress in this domain. We explores the intricate mechanisms un­
derlying the anti-cancer effects of these peptides. The exploration of innovative strategies, including cancer 
immunotherapy and advanced drug delivery systems, is likely to contribute to the increasing presenceuse of 
peptide drugs in clinical cancer care. Furthermore, we delve into the potential implications and challenges 
associated with this anticipated shift, emphasizing the need for continued research and development to unlock 
the full therapeutic potential of peptide drugs in cancer treatment.
1. Introduction
Cancer treatment is a significant challenge given the increased 
incidence of tumorigenesis due to aging populations and lifestyle 
changes. Based on the most recent global cancer statistics, in 2019, there 
were 23.6 million new cancer cases and 10.0 million deaths globally, 
reflecting a 26.3 % increase in cases and a 20.9 % increase in deaths 
since 2010. Cancer ranks second only to cardiovascular diseases in terms 
of global deaths. The cancer burden varies across sociodemographic 
index quintiles, with higher quintiles contributing more significantly to 
years lived with disability [1]. The clinical treatment of malignant 
cancers primarily encompasses surgery combined with radiotherapy and 
chemotherapy. Surgical treatment is susceptible to recurrence, but 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy have limitations such as poor speci­
ficity, severe side effects, and harm to the nervous system and the 
gastrointestinal tract [2]. Clinical practitioners are presently focused on 
enhancing the precision, safety, and efficacy of cancer treatments. Tar­
geted cancer therapies with high selectivity and few side effects are 
urgently needed. In recent years, researchers have investigated peptides 
with anti-cancer properties as promising alternatives for cancer therapy.

polymer composed of 40 or fewer amino acids to be a peptide. Anti-

cancer peptides (ACPs) are short peptides that are typically composed of 
5–40 amino acids and are primarily derived from natural sources [3]. It 
is worth noting that the FDA guidelines mentioned earlier are shaped by 
considerations of synthetic feasibility, a factor that has evolved over 
time and is expected to continue changing in the future. In recent years, 
peptide-based drugs have emerged as remarkable and promising tools in 
cancer therapeutics, offering a multitude of exceptional capabilities, 
including precise targeting of specific cells, control over cellular fate, 
deep penetration into tumor tissues, and the ability to generate immune 
responses that enhance the effectiveness of conventional anti-cancer 
treatments [4]. The anti-cancer peptide leuprolide, developed and pro­
duced by AbbVie, was first approved by the FDA in 1985. Within two 
years, leuprolide also received approval in Canada and European 
countries for treating different types of cancer, such as prostate [5] and 
breast cancer [6]. With further research and clinical trials, the use of 
leuprolide in cancer treatment has been continuously evolving and 
expanding. In 2019, the global sales volume reached 2022 million dol­
lars [2]. Currently, approximately 80 peptide drugs have been approved 
for clinical use by governmental agencies in several countries, and 
research on peptide therapeutics is ongoing. With over 150 peptides in 
clinical development and another 400–600 peptides undergoing pre­
clinical studies [2], we expect the market for peptide therapeutics to 
maintain growth and expand.
The mechanisms of action of anti-cancer peptides include the direct 
killing of cancer cells, destruction of extracellular conditions favorable 
for tumor growth, inhibition of tumor cell metastasis and invasion, and 
activation of cancer patient immune systems. Immunotherapy repre­
sents a highly potent approach for combating cancer. By leveraging the 
immune system, immunotherapy targets and eliminates cancer cells, 
resulting in enduring anti-cancer responses and facilitating significant 
disease regression. Immunotherapy also safeguards against metastasis 
and recurrence, enhancing its effectiveness as a therapeutic strategy. 
Based on their distinct mechanisms of action, ACPs offer potential so­
lutions to the challenges encountered in cancer immunotherapies, 
including tumor immune evasion, immune tolerance, limited presence 
of tumor-specific antigens, immune-related adverse events such as 
autoimmune diseases or immune-related inflammation, and the emer­
gence of treatment resistance [7]. For instance, anti-cancer peptide 
vaccines have emerged as novel therapies in the field of oncology. In 
comparison to conventional chemotherapy, peptide vaccines offer ad­
vantages such as enhanced stability, robust targeting ability, minimal 
toxic side effects, and facile preparation. Peptide vaccines substantially 
augment the patient's immune system, leading to prolonged overall 
survival and favorable tolerability [8].
Peptides can also play a role in enhancing the delivery of other drugs 
to specific tissues or cells as part of a drug delivery system (DDS). Pep­
tides have good biocompatibility and can be coupled with drug carriers 
to generate cancer-targeted carriers. The development of peptide DDSs 
encompasses carrier systems, targeting strategies, controlled release 
systems, codelivery systems, and personalized therapies. These ad­
vancements aim to enhance drug delivery efficiency, improve targeting 
specificity, and minimize adverse effects9. Carrier systems such as 
nanoparticles, liposomes, and polymer microspheres are employed to 
encapsulate and deliver peptide drugs. Controlled release systems 
respond to specific proteins/components within tumor microenviron­
ments, as well as signals or stimuli, for regulated drug release. Code­
livery systems enhance drug treatment efficacy by delivering multiple 
drugs together, leading to synergistic effects, optimized dosages, 
reduced drug resistance, and minimized side effects. Personalized 
therapy involves the design and optimization of DDSs based on patient 
genotype, tumor characteristics, and treatment needs.
The utilization of peptides or protein-based biomolecules in anti- 
cancer therapeutics is becoming increasingly important. Within the 
Drug Bank Database, approximately 460 compounds target cancer, 29 of 
which fall under the category of peptide or polypeptide-based anti- 
cancer drugs. These peptides are further classified into three groups: 
approved, under investigation, and in trial phases [3]. In cancer treat­
ment, ACPs are often used in combination with traditional chemo­
therapy drugs to enhance their targeting efficacy and reduce toxic side 
effects. For instance, goserelin and leuprolide are utilized in androgen 
deprivation therapy for pre- or postsurgical interventions in prostate or 
breast cancer. Octreotide, on the other hand, is primarily employed to 
alleviate symptoms and control the growth of neuroendocrine tumors 
[9]. These developments offer new directions for drug research and 
bring new hope for cancer treatment and other disease therapies. This 
paper provides a comprehensive review of the classification, mechanism 
of action, and clinical applications of ACPs. The aim of this review is to 
offer valuable insights for the discovery and development of peptide- 
based anti-cancer drugs.
2. Classification of anti-cancer peptides
Anti-cancer peptides can be classified based on their spatial structure 
(Fig. 1) and origin. These classification methods aid in understanding 
the structure and function of ACPs and provide a foundation for further 
drug development. It is important to note that peptides may possess 
multiple structural characteristics and sources, and these classifications 
are not absolute but serve as convenient tools for research and 
discussion.
2.1. Spatial configuration-based classification
Anti-cancer peptides can be classified into four categories based on 
their spatial configuration. Linear peptides are composed of amino acids 
that are sequentially linked without folding or bending. They have fewer 
binding sites on the surface antigens of cancer cells, resulting in weaker 
recognition. Therefore, modifying the structure or delivery method of 
linear peptides can increase their anti-cancer efficacy [10].
α-Helical peptides adopt a stable coiled α-helical structure and 
display diverse biological activities, including protein–protein in­
teractions, membrane fusion, antimicrobial properties, and anti-cancer 
effects. Examples of alpha-helical peptides include silk fibroin, mag­
ainin, and melittin. They exhibit random conformations in water and 
organize into α-helical structures upon interacting with cell membranes 
[11]. Hydrocarbon-stapled α-helical peptides are a new class of artifi­
cially crafted peptides. They are locked in their bioactive α-helical 
structure through the targeted use of an all-hydrocarbon staple, which 
significantly enhances their pharmacological performance. The stapled 
peptide N1S, designed based on AlphaFold predictions by Ramya Modi, 
inhibits Nrf2/MafG heterodimerization, reducing the transcription of 
Nrf2-dependent genes and enhancing cisplatin sensitivity in Nrf2- 
dependent cancer cells, suggesting that this peptide is a promising 
lead for sensitizing Nrf2-dependent cancers [12].This stapling technique 
increases the target affinity, proteolytic resistance, and serum half-life of 
peptides [12]. Additionally, it facilitates effective cell penetration by 
leveraging endocytic vesicle trafficking pathways.
β-folded peptides are peptides with a specific structure featuring 
β-folding, a common secondary structure in proteins. This structure 
consists of β-folded chains arranged in a stable three-dimensional form, 
providing these peptides with unique biological activity. They have 
potential applications in biomedical research and drug development. 
β-folded peptides included gramicidin, lactoferrin, and horseshoe crab 
peptide. These peptides are rich in proline, glycine, tryptophan, and 
arginine residues; moreover, the presence of multiple cysteine residues 
facilitates the maintenance of their folded state through disulfide bond 
formation [13]. Recently, synthesized hydrocarbon-stapled β-hairpin 
peptides have also undergone validation in the field of antimicrobial 
research [14].
Cyclic peptides are peptides with a stable circular structure formed 
by connecting the two ends of the peptide chain. This cyclic structure 
can be achieved through various connection methods, including but not 
limited to chemical bonds between nonnatural amino acid residues, 
X. Chen et al.

disulfide bonds between cysteine residues, or the introduction of special 
linking bridges such as alkyl chains. This cyclic arrangement enhances 
their stability and makes them valuable in drug development, biological 
research, and bioengineering. SFTI-G5, designed by Sitanshu S. Singh 
and employing a sunflower trypsin inhibitor (SFTI-1) template, was 
engineered to inhibit protein–protein interactions involving EGFR:HER2 
and HER2:HER3. It demonstrated significant antiproliferative activity in 
HER2-positive NSCLC cell lines and effectively inhibited tumor growth 
in vivo [15]. Disulfide-bonded peptides are subtypes of cyclic peptides 
and form a cyclic structure through the linkage of cysteine residues via 
disulfide bonds. The developed peptide targeting the RbAp48/MTA1 
interaction demonstrated a low nanomolar KD value of 8.56 nM, 
demonstrating the efficacy of a structure-based design strategy for 
protein–protein interaction inhibitors [16]. Cyclic stapled peptides, such 
as CP21, enhance the stability of cyclic peptides. CP21, a bicyclic pep­
tide ligand targeting DCP2, exhibits high affinity and selectivity, 
inhibiting DCP2 decapping activity on specific RNA substrates in human 
cells. CP21 promotes the formation of P-bodies, which are liquid con­
densates enriched in RNA decay intermediates, resembling the effects 
observed with DCP2 deletion or mutation. Bicyclic peptides, which 
exhibit enhanced rigidity and stability, exhibit antibody-like affinity for 
challenging drug targets.
In addition, there are also intrinsically disordered peptides and 
hybrid peptides. Intrinsically disordered peptides typically contain high 
levels of proline and glycine and lack typical secondary structures. They 
exhibit weaker cytotoxic effects against tumor cells than other structural 
types of anti-cancer peptides [17]. The term “hybrid peptides” can be 
broad and covers a variety of peptide structures and compositions. These 
peptides can be designed for specific purposes, such as improved sta­
bility, enhanced bioavailability, or targeting specific biological activ­
ities. Although the structure of hybrid peptides is complex, they can be 
obtained through rational design and synthesis [18]. Hybrid peptides 
can be used in cancer therapy, immunoregulation, drug delivery, and 
other fields. For example, some hybrid peptides can be used as tumor 
vaccines to induce an immune response in the body, enhancing tumor 
cell clearance [19]. In addition, some hybrid peptides can also be used as 
tools for the early detection and diagnosis of tumors [20]. Hybrid pep­
tides can also be used in drug delivery systems to achieve targeted de­
livery of drugs through specific structural domains, thereby improving 
the therapeutic effect of drugs and reducing side effects [21]. Dual- 
functionalized peptides, currently a research hotspot in the develop­
ment of peptide-based anti-cancer drugs, are peptides that couple two or 
more peptide sequences and exhibit multiple pharmacological activities. 
These peptides target multiple pathways simultaneously, demonstrating 
synergistic effects through different mechanisms and ensuring enhanced 
safety [22]. For complex diseases such as cardiovascular, metabolic, 
central nervous system, cancer, and immune-related disorders, intricate 
pathogenic mechanisms often pose challenges for achieving desired ef­
fects through the conventional model of single-target drugs. In the 
context of cancer research, dual-function peptides have emerged as a 
focal point, harnessing their potential to address diverse targets and 
enhance therapeutic outcomes. This innovative approach capitalizes on 
simultaneous action on different signaling pathways, significantly 
improving drug efficacy, presenting a more balanced pharmacokinetic 
profile, and reducing side effects [23]. Many peptide molecules with 
dual functionalities have undergone clinical validation, providing a 
foundation for creatively discovering better combinations to seek 
improved drugs [22,24]. Regarding risks and costs, dual-function pep­
tides are generally on par with other single-entity molecules in clinical 
development. Compared to cocktails or multicomponent drugs, dual- 
function peptides avoid complex drug–drug interactions, resulting in 
lower risks and better patient and physician compliance due to simpli­
fied pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic behaviors [25]. In terms of 
structure, dual-functionalized peptides can be categorized into linear 
peptides, stapled peptides, and cyclic peptides. The increasing 
complexity of peptide molecular structures is an important develop­
mental trend, manifested not only in the introduction of nonnatural 
amino acids or additional functional groups (proteins, small molecules) 
but also in diverse structural motifs such as cyclic peptides, disulfide- 
bonded 
peptides, 
stapled 
peptides, 
β-turns, 
and 
more.

hybridization of peptide sequences or structures allows researchers to 
harness the beneficial properties of different peptide components, 
creating molecules with tailored characteristics. The design and syn­
thesis of hybrid peptides are areas of ongoing scientific exploration and 
innovation.
2.2. Source-based classification
According to their sources, anti-cancer peptides can be classified into 
two categories: natural peptides and artificially synthesized peptides 
[26]. Natural peptides are derived from natural proteins within organ­
isms, including venom, serum, immune cells, and tissues. Representative 
endogenous natural peptides are summarized in Table 1. Cecropins, 
derived from houseflies, exhibit growth inhibition and membrane per­
meabilization effects in vitro against various cancers, including 
hepatocellular, esophageal, cervical, lung, breast, colon, and ovarian 
cancers, with derivatives such as Cecropin B, Cecropin A, Cecropin D, 
Moricin, Melittin-Cecropin, and hybrid peptides [27]. These natural 
peptides can be scarce and typically have high efficacy, but their 
structure and properties are often complex, thus restricting their 
research and application [28].
Typically, artificially designed and synthesized anti-cancer peptides 
are generated using two methods. The first method involves simulating 
the structure and function of natural peptide molecules by synthesizing 
peptide chains [29,30]. The second method involves the synthesis of 
new molecules by analyzing and modifying known peptide molecules, 
such as artificial toxins with enhanced anti-cancer activity [31]. Artifi­
cially designed peptides are synthesized by chemical or biological 
methods. Compared with those of natural peptides, the structure and 
properties of artificially synthesized peptides are easier to control. As

such, synthetic peptides can be designed and modified to target specific 
tumor cell targets with increased specificity and affinity. Additionally, 
the stability and efficacy of artificially synthesized peptides can also be 
improved through structural modification. Currently, artificially syn­
thesized peptides are the most clinically used peptide drugs.
3. Key features of a good ACP drug and how to obtain one
For peptides, the majority of peptide drugs are utilized in the treat­
ment of endocrine, metabolic, cardiovascular disorders, as well as can­
cer, with metabolic disorders, particularly diabetes, and cancer 
constituting the largest sources of revenue. The focus of peptide research 
in the early 20th century predominantly revolved around peptide en­
gineering. Peptide engineering refers to the modification of existing 
natural peptides or their variants to improve their properties, stability, 
or functionality. Its applications include optimizing existing peptide 
drugs to enhance pharmacokinetic properties, increase bioactivity, or 
reduce side effects. Additionally, it can be used to modify the stability or 
specificity of peptides, making them more suitable for drug develop­
ment. One of the key advantages of peptide engineering is that it allows 
the use of existing natural peptides as a foundation for enhancement, 
thus improving drug performance without starting from scratch.
As researchers have delved deeper into peptide studies, they have 
revealed the distinct advantage of peptides over small molecules due to 
their larger surface area, greater chiral complexity, and structural in­
tricacy [32]. These characteristics can be leveraged for drug targets that 
require interactions at multiple and distant sites to activate the target. 
However, ensuring the effectiveness, stability, and safety of a peptide 
drug is crucial. By examining leuprolides as a case in point, several 
critical characteristics have emerged, revealing nuanced considerations 
in designing effective peptide drugs [33,34].
Leuprolide can effectively inhibit the function of the pituitary- 
gonadal system. The ability to promote luteinizing hormone (LH) 
release is approximately 20 times greater than that of GnRH. It also has a 
stronger inhibitory effect on hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal function 
than does GnRH. The precision of target specificity exhibited by leu­
prolide, particularly in modulating LHRH receptors, underscores the 
importance of tailored interactions for therapeutic success [35]. Its high 
affinity and potency not only emphasize the necessity for strong mo­
lecular binding but also highlight the potential for robust pharmaco­
logical effects. Therefore, good anti-cancer peptides drugs should 
possess high potency and specificity. To achieve this goal, we first need 
to identify specific molecular targets associated with cancer cells for a 
focused therapeutic strategy. We can utilize bioinformatic methods and 
structural biology approaches to identify cancer-related or newly iden­
tified targets through genomic and proteomic analyses [36]. Subse­
quently, peptide sequences are designed based on structural and 
functional information to achieve effective binding to target proteins. 
We can also employ high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) to swiftly 
and efficiently screen peptide drugs with specific biological activities, 
offering robust support for the development and optimization of peptide 
drugs. Next, we need to conduct structural modifications and optimi­
zations to enhance the stability, bioavailability, and target binding [37]. 
Effective utilization of peptide drugs by the body is a key prerequisite for 
their efficacy; therefore, optimizing their administration is crucial. For 
instance, leuprolide is not effective when administered orally but is well 
absorbed through subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. The choice 
of administration route considers the challenges peptides face in the 
gastrointestinal environment, highlighting the importance of strategic 
drug delivery methods.
Stability, a cornerstone of any successful drug, is exemplified by the 
stability of leuprolide under physiological conditions, emphasizing the 
need for structural integrity to ensure prolonged efficacy [30]. 
Currently, the clinically applied formulations are often extended-release 
preparations, with a single subcutaneous injection of 3.75 mg reaching 
peak plasma drug concentrations at 4 h. The peak concentration ranged 
from 4.6 to 10.2 ng/ml. Subsequently, within 2 days, the plasma drug 
concentration stabilized at 0.30 ng/ml, and this steady-state concen­
tration was relatively stable for 4 to 5 weeks. In the body, leuprolide 
undergoes hydrolysis, resulting in four degradation products, which are 
then excreted through the kidneys. After a single subcutaneous injec­
tion, the urinary excretion rates of the parent drug and its metabolites 
are 2.9 % and 1.5 %, respectively, after 28 days [38]. Therefore, a 
successful anti-cancer peptide drug should possess stability in vivo and 
undergo thorough pharmacological research, including investigations 
into its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties, 
to understand the peptide's behavior in the body. We can use the 
methods mentioned earlier to conduct structural modifications and op­
timizations, enhancing the stability, bioavailability, and target binding.
The strategic design of leuprolides with limited immunogenicity has 
led to advancements in minimizing adverse immune reactions and 
enhancing the drug's safety profile [39]. Although leuprolide has been 
used for many hormone-dependent diseases and is considered a rela­
tively safe drug, its application may lead to certain side effects. For 
instance, diabetic patients may experience elevated blood sugar levels 
during leuprolide use, and some individuals may experience decreased 
liver function and jaundice symptoms [33]. In the initial phase of leu­
prolide treatment, testosterone secretion is transiently promoted, 
potentially causing the exacerbation of bone pain, urinary retention, and 
symptoms of spinal cord compression. Adverse reactions in the treat­
ment of prostate cancer include erectile dysfunction, hot flashes, car­
diovascular complications, and symptoms of breast feminization. 
Prolonged use in female patients may result in a range of post­
menopausal androgen-like side effects, including fever and night sweats, 
headache, mood depression, gastrointestinal disturbances, acne, 
reduced libido, weight gain, and breast changes [34]. Due to the 
inhibitory effect of leuprolide on estrogen, long-term use can lead to 
decreased bone density in female patients [40]. Therefore, while 
ensuring efficacy and stability, rigorous toxicity studies must be con­
ducted to ensure minimal adverse effects on normal tissues. In general, 
higher specificity is associated with reduced side effects and increased 
efficacy. Therefore, by enhancing specificity, we can improve efficacy 
and minimize toxic side effects. Before entering clinical trials, in vivo 
and in vitro experiments, along with pharmacological studies, are 
indispensable. Additionally, determining the appropriate dosage is 
essential to balance therapeutic efficacy and minimize potential side 
effects. The consideration of cell permeability, metabolic stability, and 
optimal size and structure in the design of leuprolides further underlines 
the multifaceted nature of peptide drugs [34].
Finally, the ease of synthesis demonstrated by leuprolide highlights 
the practicality and scalability necessary for pharmaceutical production, 
contributing to the feasibility of translating peptides into clinically 
viable therapies [29]. The discovery of solid-phase peptide synthesis 
revolutionized the process of developing synthetic peptides. The inte­
gration of microwave irradiation and automation in solution and solid- 
phase synthesis, along with advances in metal catalysis and C–H 
functionalization, has led to a reduction in the coupling cycle time to 
minutes and an increase in the substrate scope for peptide synthesis 
beyond esters/acids and amines [41]. Given the complexity of bioactive 
peptides, developing cell factories offers a promising strategy for 
bypassing intricate chemical synthesis. Hence, genetic engineering and 
synthetic biology play crucial roles in modern peptide synthesis. Fig. 2
offers a comprehensive overview of the de novo peptide design process, 
incorporating the application of several new technologies. In essence, 
leuprolide serves as a paradigm for the intricate interplay of charac­
teristics necessary for a successful peptide drug. The ongoing advance­
ments in peptide-based therapies underscore the potential of this class of 
molecules in addressing complex biological targets and advancing pre­
cision medicine. As research progresses, a deeper understanding of 
peptide characteristics will likely unveil new possibilities and refine the 
landscape of drug development.

4. Mechanisms of anti-cancer peptides
ACPs have a multifaceted impact on cancer hallmarks, including 
immune system regulation, induction of cancer cell apoptosis, cell cycle 
regulation, inhibition of migration and invasion, and modulation of the 
tumor microenvironment (Fig. 3). The diverse mechanisms exhibited by 
anti-cancer peptides underscore their potential to effectively target 
specific facets of cancer cell biology.
4.1. Immune regulation
In recent years, ACP drugs have played a crucial role in cancer 
immunotherapy because they are precisely engineered to selectively 
interact with specific cells of the innate or adaptive immune system 
(Fig. 4a) [42,43]. The primary objective of ACP therapy is to modulate 
the immune microenvironment in a targeted manner, ultimately leading 
to the suppression of tumor growth(Fig. 4b).
4.1.1. Activation of the innate immune system
The innate immune system consists of a broad spectrum of cellular 
components, including macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, natu­
ral killer cells, and various other cell types. These cells play a crucial role 
in mounting an effective immune response against tumors.
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a specialized and unique 
subset of phagocytic cells known for their remarkable capacity to effi­
ciently locate and target cancer cells that are present in tissues outside 
the circulatory system. TAMs are a diverse population that can be 
classified into two distinct activation states: the anti-cancer M1 pheno­
type and the protumor M2 phenotype. M1-TAMs display anti-cancer 
properties and can induce proinflammatory responses, facilitate

resistance to apoptosis, metabolic reprogramming, activating invasion and metastasis, tumorpromoting inflammation, insensitivity to antigrowth signals, avoiding 
immune destruction, and inducing angiogenesis. The figure was created with BioRender.com.

antigen presentation, and enhance cytotoxicity against cancer cells. 
Conversely, M2-TAMs exhibit immunosuppressive characteristics and 
contribute to tumor progression by promoting angiogenesis, remodeling 
the tumor microenvironment, and suppressing immune responses. The 
balance between the M1 and M2 activation states within the tumor 
microenvironment plays a critical role in shaping the immune response 
against cancer [44]. RP-182, a synthetic peptide, activates CD206 in M2- 
like TAMs, driving their transformation into anti-cancer M1-like mac­
rophages. This reprogramming effect of RP-182 induces endocytosis, 
phagosome-lysosome formation, and autophagy. In murine cancer 
models, RP-182 has demonstrated notable effects, including tumor 
growth inhibition, improved survival rates, and synergistic effects with 
other therapies. Moreover, RP-182 has exhibited remarkable anti-cancer 
effects in patient-derived xenotransplantation models by reducing the 
immunosuppressive TAM population and enhancing immune responses 
against cancer cells [45]. The peptide antagonist PCP has been used to 
codeliver DOX and R848 via the prodrug PCP@R848/DOX, which is 
subsequently cleaved by FAP-α in the tumor stroma [46]. Cargo- 
localized release of DOX and R848 triggers immunogenic cell death 
(ICD) and TAM reprogramming, thereby promoting anti-cancer immu­
nity. The sustained release of PD-1/PD-L1 antagonists blocks the PD-L1 
pathway, resulting in the subsequent activation of cytotoxic T cells. 
Triple-modality therapy activates ICDs, TAMs, and T cells, eliciting a 
strong systemic anti-cancer response [46]. In the context of peptide- 
mediated therapeutic modulation of the tumor immune microenviron­
ment, the reprogramming of TAMs can function as an independent 
intervention and as an integral component of comprehensive immuno­
therapeutic strategies.
Dendritic cells (DCs), which are found throughout peripheral tissues, 
can detect antigens and initiate immune responses. DCs are crucial for

activating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, leading to targeted cytotoxic effects 
on cancer cells. DC-mediated peptide delivery has consistently shown 
significant immunomodulatory effects in various studies [8]. Dual- 
modified iron oxide nanoparticles incorporating hyaluronic acid and 
mannose effectively target and repolarize tumor-associated macro­
phages (TAMs), leading to a modified tumor microenvironment. When 
combined with antigenic peptides, this nanovaccine promoted CD8+ T- 
cell infiltration and activated dendritic cells. This approach results in 
significant lymphoma growth inhibition, achieving a remarkable 40 % 
cure rate in a mouse model [47].
Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) have various effects on the 
tumor microenvironment and can exhibit either protumor (N2) or 
antitumor (N1) phenotypes [48]. Targeting TANs has demonstrated 
promise in enhancing cancer immunotherapy [49]. Given the rapid 
uptake of NE (neutrophil elastase) by NE-negative tumor cells, NE- 
derived peptides are currently utilized as immunotherapies for solid 
tumors. The uptake of NE by tumors is regulated by neuropilin-1, a 
protein that is abundantly expressed by breast cancer cells. Targeting 
neuropilin-1 presents a promising avenue for immunotherapeutic stra­
tegies focused on cross-presented antigens [50]. In a study conducted by 
Shirin Ferdowsi et al., α-defensins were isolated from neutrophils that 
were trapped in leukofilters, and their anti-cancer activity was evalu­
ated. Compared with the untreated group and commercially available 
HNPs 1–3, purified HNPs 1–3 reduced Jurkat T-cell line viability and 
increased apoptosis [51].
NK cells play a critical role in the early recognition and elimination 
of tumor cells due to their unique ability to detect stressed cells inde­
pendently of antibodies and MHC molecules. The activation of NK cells 
is finely regulated by a delicate balance between inhibitory and acti­
vating signals [52]. The tumor microenvironment can suppress the 
activation of NK cells, but ACPs offer a promising approach for restoring 
the activation of NK cells within the tumor microenvironment [53]. 
Huang et al. developed a novel peptide ligand called Natein using T7 
phage display technology that can bind specifically to CD56, a protein 
expressed in immune cells and cancer cells. Natein demonstrated func­
tional cytotoxicity against CD56+ cancer cells and exhibited potential as 
an alternative to CD56 antibodies for use in peptide-based lymphoma 
cell isolation and diagnosis [54].
4.1.2. Activation of the adaptive immune system
The adaptive immune system, which primarily consists of T cells and 
B cells, provides a sophisticated defense against foreign pathogens and 
possesses strong anti-cancer properties.
T cells include cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, helper CD4+ T cells, and 
regulatory T (Treg) cells. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells play a crucial role in 
eliminating cancer cells by recognizing and attacking cells presenting 
tumor-specific antigens. However, the function of these cells can be 
hindered by inhibitory receptor ligands such as PD-L1 or PD-L2, which 
may be expressed by cancer cells. Moreover, the activation of CD8+
cytotoxic T cells can lead to the generation of T regulatory cells, which 
suppress effector T-cell activity [55]. Checkpoint blockade immuno­
therapy is an innovative and promising treatment that aims to restore 
the ability of the immune system to detect and eliminate hidden cancer 
cells. By targeting inhibitory checkpoints, such as PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA- 
4, this therapeutic approach unleashes the full potential of the immune 
response against cancer, resulting in better patient outcomes and long- 
term survival [56]. DSPOGS, a chimeric peptide able to target PD-L1 
and VEGFR2, exhibits high-affinity binding and effectively inhibits 
tumor growth, migration, and angiogenesis. DSPOGS stimulates an anti- 
cancer immune response by increasing the infiltration of CD8+ T cells 
and IFN-γ secretion. Combining radiotherapy with DSPOGS further en­
hances treatment outcomes, offering a potential paradigm for multi­
modal cancer therapy [57]. Macrocyclization scanning can identify 
cyclic anti-PD-L1 peptides with improved activity and stability. These 
peptides exhibit enhanced PD-1/PD-L1 blocking and in vivo anti-cancer 
effects. This approach can optimize bioactive peptides for the 
modulation of protein–protein interactions in cancer immunotherapy 
and other therapeutic applications [58]. By screening peptide libraries 
and conducting a thorough investigation of the Foxp3:NFAT structure, 
researchers have discovered a series of peptides capable of binding to 
Foxp3 and effectively inhibiting the activity of T regulatory cells (Tregs). 
These peptides exhibit anti-cancer activity in vivo [59]. This significant 
discovery provides exciting prospects for the development of targeted 
therapies that can modulate Treg function, ultimately leading to 
enhanced immune responses against tumors.
B cells, a subtype of lymphocytes, play a vital role in the adaptive 
immune system by producing antibodies. In the realm of cancer vac­
cines, B-cell peptide-based approaches typically involve the formulation 
of an adjuvant and an immunogenic protein containing a B-cell epitope 
peptide. This combination aims to trigger B cells to generate targeted 
antibodies, fostering an immune response against cancer cells. However, 
improvements in cost, adverse effects, and resistance are needed. The 
anti-cancer immune response of patients can be stimulated through 
active immunization using mimotopes, which are B-cell peptides that 
mimic the binding epitopes of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The pa­
tient immune system can be activated upon administration of mim­
otopes, eliciting a robust immune response against cancer. Tobias et al. 
identified and evaluated mimotopes of the immune checkpoint PD1. The 
mimotopes effectively blocked PD1/PD-L1 interactions and reduced 
leukemia cell growth in a mouse model. Moreover, synergistic anti- 
cancer activity was observed when mimotopes were used in combina­
tion with a tumor-specific vaccine. Active immunization with mim­
otopes has shown promise as a new strategy for cancer treatment [60]. 
Guo et al. developed a novel B-cell vaccine called PD1-Vaxx [MVF-PD-1 
(92–110)] and conducted extensive preclinical pharmacology studies, 
including primary and secondary pharmacodynamics, biodistribution, 
and safety evaluations. The findings from these studies strongly support 
the advancement of PD1-Vaxx into a first-in-human clinical trial for 
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Currently, a phase I 
trial in NSCLC patients is already underway, marking an important 
milestone in the development of this vaccine [61].
4.1.3. Peptide-based anti-cancer vaccines
A peptide-based cancer vaccine aims to achieve the crucial objective 
of activating a patient's immune system and priming it to recognize and 
mount a targeted response against cancer cells. Peptide vaccines typi­
cally consist of peptides and adjuvants [62]. Peptide-based cancer vac­
cines are carefully designed to selectively activate specific effector cell 
types within the immune system. MHC I peptides, consisting of 8–10 
amino acids, are designed to interact with CD8+ T cells, facilitating their 
recognition and immune response [63]. On the other hand, MHC II 
peptides, comprising 13 to 18 amino acids, are predominantly recog­
nized by CD4+ T cells [64]. Brett J Hos et al. successfully induced the 
expression of MHC class II molecules on tumor cells that were originally 
lacking MHC class II molecules by introducing the MHC class II trans­
activator (CIITA). This enabled the identification of oncoviral and neo­
epitopes, as well as shared epitopes, on the cell surface. These epitopes 
have immunological relevance and are naturally presented by dendritic 
cells, demonstrating their immunogenicity. Moreover, synthetic peptide 
vaccination elicits functional CD4+ T-cell responses. These responses 
have been demonstrated to aid in the in vivo control of tumor growth, 
expansion, metastasis, and related phenomena. The CIITA transfection 
approach offers a valuable method for identifying T helper epitopes 
presented by various MHC class II alleles. This approach also revealed 
significant targets for cancer immunotherapy, which can be achieved 
through the utilization of peptide-based anti-cancer vaccines [65].
Yusuke Oji et al. reported the results of a clinical trial investigating 
the efficacy of a biweekly wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) tri-peptide-based vac­
cine for the treatment of recurrent or advanced rare cancers. In their 
study, they compared the biweekly WT1 Trio vaccine, which in­
corporates the WT1–332 helper T lymphocyte peptide, with the weekly 
WT1–235 CTL peptide vaccine. Their findings revealed that the 
X. Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
BBA - Reviews on Cancer 1879 (2024) 189197 
8 
biweekly administration of the WT1 Trio vaccine resulted in more 
potent immune responses, specifically targeting WT1 [66]. Jinho Kang 
et al. successfully identified MHC class II epitopes derived from HSP90 
that exhibit high binding affinities across various human HLA class II 
genotypes. These selected MHC class II HSP90 peptides have been 
demonstrated to induce robust antigen-specific T-cell responses. Spe­
cifically, in the context of breast cancer, these peptides have been shown 
to trigger cross-priming of CD8+ T cells, resulting in potent immune 
responses against cancer cells [67].
Regarding antigen-based immunotherapy, there are challenges 
related to the limited accuracy of algorithms in efficiently predicting 
immunogenic neoantigens derived from peptides. Additionally, there is 
a lack of comprehensive research and predictions for CD4+ T cells, 
which requires further investigation. However, in the case of low- 
mutation burden tumors with low-frequency neoantigen expression, a 
recent study demonstrated the potential use of radiotherapy to induce 
mutations and generate neoantigens [68]. These neoantigens contribute 
to intratumor heterogeneity, highlighting the importance of identifying 
all neoantigens present in tumors to ensure effective treatment. These 
issues require in-depth exploration and investigation in future research.
4.2. Apoptosis induction
Apoptosis-inducing peptides exert anti-cancer effects by regulating 
the apoptosis pathway in tumor cells [69]. The ApInAPDB (Apoptosis- 
Inducing Anti-cancer Peptides Database, http://bioinf.modares.ac.ir/ 
software/ApInAPDB/) is a comprehensive library of 818 anti-cancer 
peptides known for their ability to induce apoptosis. These peptides 
were manually curated from various research articles, ensuring a reli­
able and curated collection. The database serves as a valuable resource 
for scholars, providing detailed information on peptide functions, target 
binding affinities, IC50 values, and other pertinent data [70]. Philippe 
et al. developed angler peptides by conjugating KD3 with cyclic cell- 
penetrating peptides. These peptides activate p53-mediated apoptosis 
in cancer cells via endocytic pathways or direct membrane translocation 
entry mechanisms. The angler strategy has proven effective for targeted 
anti-cancer therapeutics [71]. Laminaria japonica peptides (LJPs) 
exhibit strong effects against hepatocellular carcinoma both in vitro and 
in vivo. The administration of LJP-1 induced apoptosis, inhibited cell 
cycle progression, and blocked tumor growth through multiple path­
ways. LJPs, especially LJP-1, show promise as potential therapeutic 
options for liver cancer [72].
4.3. Cell cycle regulation
Certain peptides can interfere with tumor cell cycle progression, thus 
inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation [73,74]. Protein hydro­
lysates from various sources were screened for their anti-proliferative 
effects on oral squamous carcinoma cells. The hydrolytic peptides of 
soybean protein strongly induced cell cycle arrest, thereby inhibiting 
tumor growth. As such, soybean protein can serve as a functional food to 
prevent oral squamous cell carcinoma [75]. Gramicidin, a natural 
antibiotic derived from Bacillus brevis bacteria, comprises two comple­
mentary peptide chains (gramicidin A and gramicidin B). Gramicidin 
exhibits anti-cancer effects on gastric cancer cells by inhibiting prolif­
eration and inducing cell cycle arrest [76]. Mechanistically, gramicidin 
downregulates cyclin D1 and phosphorylates FoxOXO1; however, 
further research is needed to investigate its potential as a therapeutic 
agent for gastric cancer [76]. The tumor suppressor p53 is a key medi­
ator of the cell cycle. The peptide PM2 has shown promise as a thera­
peutic agent when used in combination with external beam 
radiotherapy (EBRT) for treating cancer cells with wild-type p53. PM2 
prevents MDM2 from suppressing p53, leading to increased p53 
expression and decreased cell viability [77].
4.4. Modulation of the tumor cell microenvironment
Modulating the tumor cell microenvironment can be accomplished 
through various strategies, such as inhibiting angiogenesis, regulating 
the immune system, regulating inflammatory factors, and inducing 
metabolic reprogramming. Targeting these mechanisms can effectively 
hinder tumor growth and progression. Regulation of the immune system 
has been discussed earlier and will not be reiterated here. Inhibiting 
tumor angiogenesis through targeting proteins such as vascular endo­
thelial growth factor (VEGF) [ 113] and platelet-derived growth factor 
(PDGF) [114] reduces the dilation and permeability of blood vessels and 
thus inhibits tumor growth and metastatic potential. Anti-angiogenic 
peptides can inhibit the secretion of angiogenic factors by tumor cells, 
disrupting the binding of VEGF to VEGFR [113] and of PDGF to PDGFR 
[114]. This interference prevents the formation of blood vessels around 
cancer cells, ultimately restricting tumor growth and metastasis. Tre­
bananib, also known as AMG 386, is an antiangiogenic peptide. Treba­
nanib works by inhibiting the interaction between vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 
(VEGFRs) [78]. A phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
bevacizumab plus trebananib as a first-line treatment for metastatic 
colorectal cancer (mCRC) [78] and revealed that this combination had 
manageable toxicity and the potential to enhance the Anti-cancer im­
mune response [79].
Cellular inflammatory cytokines play a crucial role in tumor pro­
gression. Tumors themselves can stimulate immune responses in the 
body, leading to the generation of inflammatory reactions and the 
release of cellular inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines can directly 
or indirectly impact tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and 
metastasis. The key cellular inflammatory cytokines closely associated 
with tumor progression include TNF-α, interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin- 
2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Excessive 
secretion of TNF-α from immune cells promotes tumor cell proliferation, 
survival, and metastasis, while normal secretion induces apoptosis, in­
hibits proliferation, and enhances immune recognition of tumor cells 
[80]. Combining peptide vaccination with F8-TNF, a tumor-homing TNF 
fusion protein, was shown to significantly induce leukemia cell necrosis 
and expand antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, highlighting the potential of 
this combination therapy for cancer treatment [81]. IL-1α and IL-1β, 
which are produced by immune cells, tumor cells, and other tissues, play 
a role in tumor progression by promoting inflammation, enhancing 
tumor cell growth, invasion, and metastasis, and suppressing immune 
responses [82]. Gong et al. discovered that by blocking the IL-1α/VEGF 
signaling pathway, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) effec­
tively inhibits gastric cancer metastasis [83]. IL-2, produced by acti­
vated immune cells, promotes the proliferation and function of immune 
cells, leading to anti-cancer effects, but can also increase regulatory T 
cells and suppress other immune cells, hindering the anti-cancer im­
mune response [84]. Utilizing high-dose IL-2/CD25 fusion proteins, 
Hernandez et al. amplified neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell 
responses, enhancing antitumor immunity and enabling effective mel­
anoma and mammary carcinoma cell clearance [85]. IL-6, produced by 
immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells, promotes tumor cell 
growth, invasion, and metastasis through JAK/STAT signaling while 
inhibiting anti-cancer immune responses and promoting inflammation 
and angiogenesis [86]. IL-10 produced by immune cells can suppress 
inflammation and immune cell activation, potentially reducing tumor 
development; however, IL-10 may also inhibit anti-cancer immune re­
sponses, promoting tumor growth and immune evasion [87]. Chen et al. 
discovered that blocking IL-10 signaling during HPV long E7 peptide/ 
LPS immunization enhances T-cell responses, facilitates immune cell 
infiltration, and results in improved regression of HPV-16 immortalized 
TC-1 tumor cells, suggesting a potential strategy for more effective 
treatment of HPV infection-related tumors [88].
Certain tumor cells rely on specific metabolic pathways, such as 
glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, and glutamine metabolism, to produce 
X. Chen et al.

energy and promote survival. Targeting these pathways can effectively 
inhibit tumor growth. LDH5, an isoform of lactate dehydrogenase, is 
highly expressed in a wide range of cancer types, making it a compelling 
target for anti-cancer treatments. The critical role of LDH5 in aerobic 
glycolysis, a metabolic pathway utilized by cancer cells, further high­
lights its potential as a therapeutic target. Both the cGmC9 peptide and 
its analog inhibit cancer cell proliferation. While the cGmC9 peptide acts 
as a noncompetitive inhibitor, disrupting LDH5 activity, its analog, a 
closely related compound, effectively impedes glycolysis in cancer cells 
and triggers metabolic alterations. The cGmC9 peptide and its analog 
demonstrate significant potential as therapeutic agents that are specif­
ically designed to enhance cellular permeation and target LDH5, as well 
as to modulate intracellular pathway interactions within cancer cells 
[89]. Psd1 is a plant defensin with broad antifungal activity. In certain 
cancer cells, an imbalance in lipid metabolism results in the excessive 
accumulation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) in the plasma membrane. 
Psd1 targets GlcCer in cancer cells, causing nuclear fragmentation and 
cell cycle arrest. In a murine melanoma model, Psd1 was shown to 
reduce metastatic nodules and lung inflammation without any signifi­
cant side effects, thus illustrating its promise as a therapy for lung 
metastatic melanoma [90]. In summary, ACPs exert their inhibitory 
effects on tumor growth by modulating the tumor microenvironment 
through various mechanisms, including suppressing angiogenesis, 
regulating immune responses, suppressing inflammatory factors, dis­
rupting tumor cell metabolism, and interfering with signaling pathways.
5. Drug delivery systems (DDSs)
Peptides, with their favorable biocompatibility, can enhance drug 
delivery by serving as components in a drug delivery system (DDS), 
facilitating the development of cancer-targeted carriers when coupled 
with drug carriers. The peptides utilized in DDSs possess five essential 
characteristics [91]. First, they can selectively bind to receptors or 
molecules present on target cells, thereby enhancing drug specificity and 
minimizing toxicity toward normal cells. Second, peptides are rapidly 
cleared through metabolic pathways, reducing the likelihood of poten­
tial side effects. Third, they are highly customizable and can be easily 
synthesized with various modifiable functional groups. Fourth, peptides 
exhibit excellent combinability, forming peptide complexes with other 
compounds to improve their stability and solubility. Finally, peptides 
are less prone to induce drug resistance because they target cell surface 
receptors, thus mitigating resistance in tumor cells. Drug delivery pep­
tides commonly draw inspiration from natural peptides and are widely 
applied in cancer treatments. Compared to small molecules, peptides 
offer greater selectivity as targeted ligands for drug delivery and imag­
ing. Methods employed include DDSs with cell-penetrating peptides, 
DDSs with targeting peptides, stimuli-responsive peptides, and peptide 
supramolecular self-assembly (Fig. 5).
5.1. DDSs with membrane-active peptides
Peptides with cell-penetrating capabilities, alternatively referred to 
as protein transduction domains or cell-penetrating sequences, are short 
peptide sequences that can traverse cell membranes and facilitate the 
delivery of various molecules into the cellular interior (Fig. 4A) [4]. R8- 
conjugated DDSs have been reported to penetrate cancer cells (Table 2). 
Wu et al. made a significant breakthrough by developing a charge- 
reversible DDS demonstrating the remarkable ability to penetrate 
mucus and epithelial barriers when administered orally [92]. This pio­
neering system is based on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nano­
particles

octa-arginine 
peptides 
(R8) 
and 
phosphoserines (Pho) through polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkages,

resulting in the formation of P-R8-Pho nanoparticles. DHSHKKK (DP7), 
a cationic antimicrobial peptide, serves as a dual-function carrier and 
immune adjuvant for microRNA delivery. DP7 efficiently transduces and 
escapes endosomes, activates dendritic cells, and transforms the 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment into an immune-activated 
microenvironment, offering a promising approach for anti-cancer ther­
apy [93]. Cholesterol-modified DP7 (DP7-C) serves as a versatile agent 
with dual capabilities as a carrier and an immune adjuvant. The most 
notable efficacy of DP7-C lies in its ability to effectively transfect cells 
and evade endosomes. Furthermore, DP7-C exhibits a remarkable ca­
pacity to activate dendritic cells, thereby triggering an immune 
response. Additionally, DP7-C plays a pivotal role in reshaping the 
tumor microenvironment, transforming it from an immunosuppressive 
state to an immune-activated milieu [93]. These remarkable features 
make DP7-C a promising candidate for anti-cancer therapy, with the 
potential to significantly impact cancer treatment by enhancing immune 
responses against tumors.
5.2. DDSs with targeting peptides
Targeted peptide drug delivery systems pertain to a category of 
therapeutic strategies that employ peptides for the precise delivery of 
drugs or therapeutic agents to specific target sites within the human 
body (Table 2). The Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide exhibits affinity for a 
class of integrin receptors known as RGD-binding receptors. The RGD- 
integrin interaction serves as a crucial link to activate SRC and STAT 
signaling pathways, promoting various cellular responses relevant to 
cancer progression, tissue repair, and immune modulation [94]. Yi Yang 
and colleagues successfully synthesized [68]Ga-DOTA-c(NGR)2 and 
demonstrated its ability to effectively target CD13 through in vitro ex­
periments and microPET imaging using ovarian cancer xenografts. 
These findings suggest that [68]Ga-DOTA-c(NGR)2 is a promising po­
tential PET imaging probe for noninvasive assessment of CD13 receptor 
expression in tumors. When CD13 interacts with its ligands or is acti­
vated, it can stimulate downstream signaling pathways, including the 
PI3K pathway. This leads to the phosphorylation of PIP2 to PIP3, acti­
vating AKT and promoting cell survival and growth [95]. Additionally, 
EGFR, a protein overexpressed in various cancer cells, can serve as a 
reliable target for peptide-mediated delivery of different therapeutics. In 
particular, GE11 (YHWYGYTPQNVI) has been reported to exhibit high 
uptake levels in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines characterized by 
elevated expression of EGFR (Fig. 4B) [96]. Upon binding to EGFR, G11 
triggers the PI3K pathway, which enhances cell survival, growth, and 
metabolism. This pathway is initiated when PI3K is activated, resulting 
in the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3, subsequently recruiting and activating 
AKT, which promotes cell survival and growth by inhibiting apoptosis 
and stimulating mTOR. Additionally, G11 activates the MAPK pathway 
via the Ras protein. This cascade regulates gene expression and cellular 
processes such as proliferation and differentiation. It is important to 
select appropriate targeting ligands for peptide-based drug delivery, 
considering their biological stability and drug release rate.
5.3. Stimuli-responsive peptides
Stimuli responsiveness refers to the capacity of these systems to 
undergo configuration changes in response to specific triggers. Triggers 
can include external factors such as photothermal, magnetic, electric, or 
ultrasonic impacts, as well as local environmental conditions, including 
pH, temperature, redox state, and concentration of specific molecules (e. 
g., O2, urea, enzymes) [97,98]. Stimulus-responsive DDSs possess the 
ability to modulate their structure, properties, or drug release behavior 
upon activation by triggers (Table 2). This responsiveness allows for 
targeted and controlled drug delivery, where the therapeutic agents are 
released at the desired site or under specific conditions. By harnessing 
external or internal stimuli, these systems can achieve enhanced drug 
efficacy, reduced side effects, and improved patient outcomes (Fig. 4C). 
Wan et al. developed TPGS3350-GPLGVRGDG-DOX&DOX micelles by 
incorporating the MMP-responsive peptide GPLGVRGDG into a block 
copolymer, enhancing the efficacy of doxorubicin delivery. The micelles 
demonstrated improved cytotoxicity against 4 T1 cells, long circulation, 
and efficient tumor accumulation in vivo [99]. This approach holds 
promise for advancing drug delivery strategies in clinical applications, 
with enhanced anti-cancer activity and reduced toxicity. The choice of 
stimuli and the design of responsive components in DDSs are crucial 
considerations.
5.4. Peptide supramolecular self-assembly
Self-assembling peptide drug delivery systems utilize the unique 
properties of peptides, such as structural diversity, biocompatibility, and 
functionalization potential, to design delivery platforms that enable 
controlled and efficient encapsulation, protection, and release of drugs 
(Table 2). Loading drugs or therapeutic agents into self-assembled 
peptide nanostructures can enhance their stability, solubility, bioavail­
ability, and targeted delivery. The nanostructures can protect drugs 
from degradation and provide sustained release, enabling long-term 
therapy and reduced dosing frequency. Furthermore, functionalizing 
these systems with targeting ligands or responsive moieties allows site- 
specific targeting at disease sites or triggered release in response to 
physiological stimuli (Fig. 4D) [100]. Guo, Z. et al. developed an 
epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted multifunctional micellar 
nanoplatform (GE11-DOX + CEL-M) [101]. The study highlights that 
the GE11 peptide plays a crucial role in enhancing the targeted delivery 
of the drug combination within the multifunctional micellar nanoplat­
form, significantly improving tumor cell uptake and resulting in superior 
tumor growth suppression and reduced metastasis compared to non- 
targeted systems. Chen et al. demonstrated that the engineered self- 
assembled peptides, employing a “self-encapsulation” strategy, func­
tion as advanced nanocarriers with integrated in situ monitoring capa­
bilities, highlighting their potential for improved delivery in eco- 
friendly optoelectronic and biomedical applications [102]. Self- 
assembling peptide drug delivery systems possess biocompatibility, 
tunability, multifunctionality, and potential for multiple applications. 
They demonstrate promising prospects in various biomedical applica­
tions, including cancer therapy, regenerative medicine, tissue engi­
neering, and diagnostics.
6. Applications of anti-cancer peptides
The utilization of peptides or protein-based biomolecules in anti- 
cancer therapeutics is becoming increasingly important. Currently, 
regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 
the USA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have approved only 
five peptides for therapeutic use. Tebentafusp, an FDA-approved agent 
for HLA-A*02:01-positive uveal melanoma, binds bispecifically to 
gp100 and CD3 T cells to trigger an anti-cancer immune response [103]. 
Buserelin, which is approved in the EU, is utilized in hormone- 
responsive cancer treatment by desensitizing the GnRHR receptor to 
reduce testosterone and estrogen release [104]. Plitidepsin, which is 
also approved by the EU, induces apoptosis and inhibits cell growth by 
targeting eEF1A2 and VEGF. Triptorelin, an FDA-approved palliative 
treatment for advanced prostate cancer, acts as a synthetic agonist 
analog of GnRH [105]. Dactinomycin, an FDA-approved agent for a 
variety of cancers, binds to DNA, inhibiting RNA synthesis [106]. These 
peptide drugs have diverse mechanisms and applications in the clinical 
landscape， we categorized ACPs based on their diverse clinical 
purposes.
6.1. Cancer diagnosis
The function of peptides as molecular probes and diagnostic tools in 
pharmacological and neurological investigations has resulted in 
X. Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
BBA - Reviews on Cancer 1879 (2024) 189197 
12 
numerous diagnostic agents and devices successfully entering the com­
mercial market [107]. The primary field of therapeutic application for 
these peptides is oncology, where they are extensively employed for 
tumor detection and targeted radiotherapy [108,109]. There is ample 
evidence supporting the significant impact of receptor overexpression 
on breast cancer initiation and progression. Targeting these specific 
receptors using radiolabeled biomolecules has emerged as a promising 
approach for early breast cancer diagnosis. Using diverse characteriza­
tion techniques, a wide range of peptides can be prepared, facilitating 
efficient labeling with clinically relevant SPECT radionuclides such as 
99mTc, 123I, and 111In [110]. The 68Ga-DOTA-LS7 peptide showed 
rapid and selective detection of CD133-positive tumors using PET [111]. 
The favorable characteristics of 68Ga-DOTA-LS7, such as its straight­
forward synthesis and specific uptake, make it a promising candidate for 
CD133 expression imaging. However, further investigations are needed 
to explore its full potential. With the continuous development of anti- 
cancer peptide technology, its prospects in tumor treatment and diag­
nosis are rapidly expanding.
6.2. Adjuvant surgery and radiochemotherapy
Traditional approaches such as surgery and radiochemotherapy have 
limited efficacy for advanced-stage tumors [112]. Emerging methods, 
including hormone therapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and 
stem cell transplantation, are increasingly being applied in clinical set­
tings to enhance the survival outcomes of patients with advanced-stage 
tumors [113]. In these novel adjunctive approaches, the role of anti­
cancer peptides is indispensable. In one pioneering phase I/II study, a 
synthetic long peptide vaccine targeting was administered to 22 post- 
radical prostatectomy patients, resulting in a robust and enduring CD4 
T cell response in the majority of participants. The vaccination regimen, 
involving subcutaneous injections of RhoC-derived peptides, exhibited 
excellent safety and tolerability, with no grade ≥3 treatment-related 
adverse events reported. Notably, immune responses included poly­
functional and persistent CD4 T cells expressing PD-1 and OX-40, 
alongside the identification of three HLA-class II epitopes [114]. The 
study's impact extended beyond the treatment period, as serum PSA 
levels were measured up to 26 months post-vaccination, underscoring a 
sustained influence on the immune system.
Ipilimumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, is employed in the 
management of malignant melanoma. It is an anti-CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T- 
lymphocyte-associated protein 4) antibody that targets specific mole­
cules in the immune system to enhance the immune system's ability to 
attack cancer cells. It has received approval for the treatment of 
advanced malignant melanoma and, under certain circumstances, for 
other cancer types [115]. In a completed Phase III clinical trial, patients 
were divided into three groups receiving either ipilimumab 3 mg/kg +
gp100 vaccine, ipilimumab 3 mg/kg + placebo, or gp100 vaccine alone. 
Among patients with at least 2 years of potential follow-up, the survival 
rates at 2 and 3 years were 19 % and 15 %, respectively, in the ipili­
mumab + gp100 group, compared to 25 % at both time points in the 
ipilimumab alone group [116]. The results suggest that the addition of 
the gp100 vaccine to ipilimumab did not yield the anticipated im­
provements in survival outcomes in pretreated patients with metastatic 
melanoma. Subsequent research, utilizing a mouse model of melanoma, 
revealed that gp100/IFA vaccination induced gp100-specific effector T 
cells (Teffs). Dominantly, these cells redirected non-gp100-specific Teffs 
induced by anti-CTLA-4 away from the tumor, diminishing tumor con­
trol. Inflammation at the vaccination site also sequestered and destroyed 
anti-CTLA-4-induced Teffs with specificities for tumor antigens other 
than gp100, reducing the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 therapy. In 
contrast, nonpersistent vaccine formulations based on water-based 
gp100 peptide strongly synergized with CTLA-4 and PD-L1 checkpoint 
blockade therapy, inducing complete tumor regression, even in cases of 
primary resistance to dual checkpoint blockade [103]. The two study 
concludes that the formulation of cancer vaccines can dominantly 
determine their synergistic effects with CTLA-4 and PD-L1 checkpoint 
blockade therapies or the lack thereof.
The increasing number of preclinical trials involving anticancer 
peptides is propelling the advancement of clinical trials for peptide- 
based therapeutics. To improve the tumor specificity of radio­
sensitizers, Dina V et al. explored active tumor targeting using peptide- 
based drug conjugates. The research group developed matrix 
metalloproteinase-cleavable cell-penetrating peptides that accumulate 
in tumor tissues. These protease-triggered peptides enabled the targeted 
delivery of radiosensitizers [117]. This finding highlights the advan­
tages of protease-triggered cell-penetrating peptides over antibody–drug 
conjugates for delivering small molecule radiosensitizers. Jie Gao et al. 
created a peptide-based “nanobat” that targets mitochondria for com­
bined chemo-radiotherapy. This innovative system efficiently induces 
cancer cell apoptosis by inhibiting energy metabolism through multiple 
pathways [118].This finding have implications for designing effective 
mitochondrion-targeted drug delivery systems for cancer therapy.
6.3. Prevention of tumor recurrence and metastasis
Anti-cancer peptides can also be used to prevent tumor recurrence. 
After tumor treatment, residual tumor cells may enter a dormant state. 
Anti-cancer peptides can activate immune cells to eliminate dormant 
tumor cells, thus preventing tumor recurrence. L-BLP25 is a peptide 
vaccine composed of a segment of the cell surface glycoprotein MUC1. 
The L-BLP25 vaccine stimulates the patient's immune system to attack 
tumor cells expressing MUC1, thereby achieving therapeutic effects and 
preventing lung cancer recurrence [119]. G17DT is a peptide vaccine 
derived from the N-terminal region of gastrin-17 (G17-NTP). Chemical 
modification enhances the immunogenicity of G17-NTP, stimulating an 
immune response against gastric cancer cells [120]. E75 is a syntheti­
cally generated segment of MUC1 that is used to activate the patient's 
immune system to combat tumor cells. Upon treatment with E75, im­
mune cells are primed to recognize and attack breast cancer cells 
expressing the MUC1 peptide segment [121]. The use of peptide-based 
drugs for preventing tumor recurrence is still in the research stage and 
has not been widely applied in clinical practice.
ACPs can inhibit the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells by tar­
geting cancer cell surface proteins and proteins/constituents of the 
tumor microenvironment. Several ACP drugs have shown clinical effi­
cacy in preventing cancer metastasis. Cancer metastasis-related peptide 
vaccines, such as those targeting MUC1 [122], HER2 [123] and GP100 
[124,125], stimulate the immune response to prevent tumor metastasis. 
Peptides that inhibit tumor cell adhesion and invasion, such as the Arg- 
Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide, bind to integrins on the surface of tumor cells, 
preventing their adhesion and invasion [126].
7. Adverse reactions and side effects of anti-cancer peptide 
drugs
Anti-cancer peptides are known for their favorable biocompatibility 
and targeting properties, making them a promising option for cancer 
treatment with relatively few side effects. However, as clinical trials of 
peptide-based drugs continue to expand, researchers have discovered 
that adverse reactions and side effects can still occur in certain cases 
(Table 3). Reactions can manifest in different ways depending on the 
specific peptide drug being used [127]. Peptide drugs can elicit favor­
able immune responses but may also trigger adverse immune reactions. 
These reactions can range from immune suppression to infections and 
allergies. One common type of adverse reaction is an allergic reaction, 
which can include symptoms such as rash, urticaria, shortness of breath, 
and decreased blood pressure. Gastrointestinal reactions, including 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are also possible, as certain peptide 
drugs can affect the digestive system [128,129]. Additionally, peptide 
drugs may trigger neurological reactions such as headaches, dizziness, 
and insomnia [130]. It is worth emphasizing that different peptide drugs 
X. Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
BBA - Reviews on Cancer 1879 (2024) 189197 
13 
may have varying adverse reactions and side effects. Furthermore, in­
dividual responses to medications can differ, highlighting the impor­
tance of monitoring patients for any adverse reactions or side effects. 
Continuous monitoring during treatment is crucial for ensuring patient 
safety and optimizing therapeutic outcomes. This includes monitoring 
for potential adverse effects, assessing treatment response, and adjusting 
the therapeutic regimen as needed.
8. Future development of anti-cancer peptide drugs
The current development status of peptide-based drugs has shaped 
the landscape of therapeutics for cancer treatment, shedding light on 
viable approaches and prospects. It is evident that significant progress 
has been made in overcoming major obstacles within the field. However, 
there is still ample space for further advancement.
First, the biosynthesis and purification processes of peptide drugs are 
complex and pose challenges to production. While the cost of 
manufacturing synthetic peptide drugs exceeds that of their small- 
molecule counterparts, the overall research and development costs are 
likely to be lower. This is attributed to their intrinsic synthetic feasi­
bility, which offers advantages in enabling rapid and extensive 
structure-activity relationship studies for lead optimization. Moreover, 
their reduced risk of off-target effects potentially leads to higher clinical 
trial success rates. These factors position peptide drugs as a promising 
avenue for cost-effective therapeutic development. These factors make 
peptide drugs a promising avenue for cost-effective therapeutic devel­
opment. For example, gene editing techniques and plasmid transfection 
enable the introduction of peptide sequences into tumor cells, thereby 
enhancing their immunogenicity and antigen-presenting capacity [131].
Second, researchers are conducting more precise screening and 
design of peptide drugs to enhance their targeting and specificity. 
Further 
understanding 
of 
the 
molecular 
characteristics 
and 
immunological mechanisms of tumor cells is needed, along with the 
development of more precise diagnostic techniques and predictive 
models.
Third, peptide drugs are prone to recognition and clearance by the 
human immune system, necessitating chemical modifications or struc­
tural alterations to enhance drug stability and bioavailability. Re­
searchers are developing new delivery systems for peptide drugs to 
improve their bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. Examples include 
the use of carriers such as nanoparticles or liposomes to enhance the 
targeting and stability of peptide drugs.
Fourth, technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine 
learning are being utilized to rapidly screen and optimize the design of 
peptide drugs, accelerating the research and development process and 
reducing costs. With the aid of technologies such as 3D printing, 
personalized preparation and precise delivery systems for peptide drugs, 
including scaffolds and delivery systems, can be achieved [132]. Over­
all, these advancements in technology and methodology are revolu­
tionizing the field of peptide drug research and development, offering 
new opportunities for improved therapeutic outcomes and personalized 
medicine.
Finally, due to the heterogeneity of tumor cells among different 
patients, there is a need to develop individually tailored peptide drugs. 
The most suitable treatment regimen can be selected based on individual 
patient characteristics, thereby improving treatment efficacy and safety 
through genetic testing and molecular diagnostic techniques.
9. Conclusion
Peptide drugs are ideally suited for cancer treatment since an esti­
mated one out of every five peptides that undergo clinical trials exhibits 
anti-cancer activity [2]. Several factors contribute to this trend, 
including the significant unmet needs in oncology, advances in peptide

synthesis and delivery, a growing understanding of tumor biology, and 
the availability of regulatory frameworks that facilitate the development 
of new drugs. There are four compelling reasons why peptide drugs hold 
great promise in the field of cancer treatment. First, many peptide 
hormone receptors exhibit increased expression in tumor cells, making 
them excellent targets for distinguishing cancer cells from healthy cells. 
Peptides, whether equipped with imaging tags or drug cargo, can enter 
tumor cells through receptor-mediated internalization. Second, peptides 
can display remarkable selectivity for specific receptor subtypes, akin to 
monoclonal antibodies, but with superior penetration into tumor tissues 
and reduced immunogenicity. Moreover, peptides are rapidly cleared 
from the body, minimizing the risk of off-target effects and toxicity. 
Third, certain peptide hormone analogs can inhibit tumor growth and 
impede cancer progression in hormone-dependent diseases, where 
tumor cell proliferation and survival rely on specific hormone levels. 
The presence of these peptide hormone analogs can block the binding of 
hormones to tumor cells, thereby suppressing tumor proliferation and 
advancement. Finally, the administration of peptides via injection is 
widely accepted by cancer patients. Therefore, we expect this field to 
continue expanding, with a particular focus on peptide-based cancer 
immunotherapy and drug delivery, which are currently receiving sig­
nificant attention [133,134]. ACPs offer vast prospects but also require 
overcoming multiple technological and scientific challenges. With 
continuous advancements in technology and in-depth basic research, it 
is believed that anti-cancer peptide drugs will play an increasingly 
important role in future clinical regimens.
