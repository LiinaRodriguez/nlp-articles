This study describes “lobular-like invasive mammary carcinomas” (LLIMCas), a group of low- to intermediate-grade invasive
mammary carcinomas with discohesive, diffusely inﬁltrative cells showing retained circumferential membranous immunoreactivity
for both E-cadherin and p120. We analyzed the clinical-pathologic features of 166 LLIMCas compared to 104 classical invasive
lobular carcinomas (ILCs) and 100 grade 1 and 2 invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs). Tumor size and pT stage of LLIMCas were
intermediate between IDCs and ILCs, and yet often underestimated on imaging and showed frequent positive margins on the ﬁrst
resection. Despite histomorphologic similarities to classical ILC, the discohesion in LLIMCa was independent of E-cadherin/p120
immunophenotypic alteration. An exploratory, hypothesis-generating analysis of the genomic features of 14 randomly selected
LLIMCas and classical ILCs (7 from each category) was performed utilizing an FDA-authorized targeted capture sequencing assay
(MSK-IMPACT). None of the seven LLIMCas harbored CDH1 loss-of-function mutations, and none of the CDH1 alterations detected in
two of the LLIMCas was pathogenic. In contrast, all seven ILCs harbored CDH1 loss-of-function mutations coupled with the loss of
heterozygosity of the CDH1 wild-type allele. Four of the six evaluable LLIMCas were positive for CDH1 promoter methylation, which
may partially explain the single-cell inﬁltrative morphology seen in LLIMCa. Further studies are warranted to better deﬁne the
molecular basis of the discohesive cellular morphology in LLIMCa. Until more data becomes available, identifying LLIMCas and
distinguishing them from typical IDCs and ILCs would be justiﬁed. In patients with LLIMCas, preoperative MRI should be entertained
to guide surgical management.

INTRODUCTION
Invasive mammary carcinoma of no special type, commonly
referred to as invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and the special
subtype of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) represent the two
most common types of invasive breast carcinomas1. While IDCs
typically show varying degrees of duct formation, ILCs are
characterized by discohesive tumor cells with single-ﬁle inﬁltrative
growth patterns dispersed in the ﬁbrous stroma2. The differences
between IDC and ILC, from clinicopathological features to
prognostic outcomes, have been extensively reported in the
literature, sometimes with conﬂicting results3–5. More recently,
attention has turned to the molecular and evolutionary differ-
ences between the two entities and their precursor lesions, laying
the foundations for personalized management of breast can-
cers6–10. Even though the diagnosis of IDC versus ILC is usually
straightforward, cases with ambiguous histomorphology are not
uncommon. Immunohistochemical (IHC) assessment of E-cadherin
with or without p120 and beta-catenin is often used to assist in
the diagnosis of such cases.
E-cadherin is a transmembrane adhesion glycoprotein encoded
by the CDH1 gene (16q22.1). P120 catenin is a tyrosine kinase
substrate anchored to the internal domain of E-cadherin in a
juxtamembranous
fashion11–13.
Characteristically,
ILC
harbors
biallelic inactivation of the CDH1 gene, often through a combina-
tion of pathogenic loss-of-function mutations coupled with loss-
of-heterozygosity (LOH) of the CDH1 wild-type allele7,14. When
E-cadherin is absent or nonfunctional, p120 catenin undergoes
redistribution from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm. Although
practice patterns among subspecialists in breast pathology are not
uniform, conventionally, lack of E-cadherin membranous expres-
sion coupled with diffuse, intense cytoplasmic p120 catenin
expression is diagnostic of lobular lesions, whereas distinctively
crisp, intense membranous positivity for both E-cadherin and
p120 catenin is characteristic of ductal phenotype. In the past
decade, emerging evidence has revealed that a non-functional E-
cadherin might present as an aberrant (i.e., lack of strong
membranous reactivity) yet visible pattern immunohistochemi-
cally15–19. Most reported cases with aberrant E-cadherin immu-
noreactivity, however, displayed a corresponding disruption of the
cadherin-catenin complex15,17–21.
The 5th edition of the WHO classiﬁcation of tumors for breast
carcinoma does not recommend the use of immunohistochem-
istry (IHC) for the diagnosis of ILC2. However, in our experience,
the interobserver agreement is limited in classifying ILC with
ambiguous morphology without IHC. Findings from a recent study
by Christgen et al.22 also supported our observation. In their study,
35 pathologists were asked to classify specimens (using 2 sets of
cases—set A with H&E section only and set B with H&E and
E-cadherin IHC) as non‐lobular breast carcinoma versus mixed
breast carcinoma versus ILC. Pairwise interobserver agreement

was moderate in set A (median κ = 0.58) and substantial in set B
(median κ = 0.75, p < 0.001). Agreement with the reference
diagnosis was substantial in set A (median κ = 0.67) and almost
perfect in set B (median κ = 0.86, p < 0.001). The authors of this
study concluded that subtyping of breast cancer as ILC achieves
almost perfect agreement with a pre‐deﬁned reference standard if
the assessment is supported by E‐cadherin IHC. To improve the
standardization of lobular carcinoma diagnosis, it has been our
practice at Magee-Womens Hospital since 2004–2005 to conﬁrm
the ﬁrst-time diagnosis of ILC by E-cadherin (along with p120) IHC
staining. Either complete absence or “aberrant” reactivity for
E-cadherin combined with intense cytoplasmic p120 catenin
expression is required for a diagnosis of ILC. Reactivity for
E-cadherin is considered “aberrant” if it is partially membranous,
beaded, perinuclear dot-like, or cytoplasmic. In the event of an
equivocal
E-cadherin
staining,
concurrent
cytoplasmic
p120 staining supports the diagnosis of ILC, whereas circumfer-
ential
membranous
p120
reactivity
is
indicative
of
ductal
immunophenotype. When different combinations of E-cadherin/
p120 immunoproﬁle are present, a diagnosis of mixed IDC and ILC
is justiﬁed. Our approach, although different from WHO recom-
mendation, results in a more accurate classiﬁcation and is the
basis of this study.
We have observed in our daily practice a group of invasive
carcinomas predominantly characterized by dissociated tumor
cells with low-to-intermediate grade, uniform nuclei, and lobular-
like growth patterns but display distinct membranous IHC staining
for both E-cadherin and p120. We refer to such cases as “lobular-
like invasive mammary carcinoma” (LLIMCa), but it is unclear
whether this terminology is appropriate and if such cases harbor
biallelic inactivation of CDH1, akin to ILCs. To our knowledge, no
previous study has deﬁned the clinical-pathologic characteristics
or addressed the clinical behavior of LLIMCa, even though
multiple prior studies, including those analyzing “IDC with lobular
features”, in fact, examined mixed ductal and lobular carcinomas
with heterogeneous E-cadherin expression23–27.
The current study aims to (1) analyze the clinical, radiological,
and pathological characteristics and prognostic outcomes of
LLIMCa, (2) compare the characteristics of LLIMCa with those of
classical ILC and typical IDC of no special type, (3) assess
representative LLIMCa cases for biallelic alterations of CDH1, and
(4) perform an exploratory, hypothesis-generating analysis of the
repertoire of somatic genetic alterations comparing representative
LLIMCa and classical ILC cases.
RESULTS
Morphologic and immunohistologic features
Consistent with the deﬁnition of LLIMCa we put forth (refer to
Methods for details), this group of tumors was found to harbor
predominantly discohesive, uniform, small- to intermediate-size
nuclei and lobular-like dissociated growth pattern, presenting as
individual cells in single-ﬁles and cords within the ﬁbrous stroma.
Neoplastic cells were occasionally arranged in a concentric
“targetoid” pattern around benign ducts and lobules. Nested or
trabecular patterns were infrequently observed. Cytologically the
tumor cells tended to have slightly larger and more angulated
nuclei than classical-type ILC. The histomorphologic features were
reﬂected in the analyzed Nottingham scores. Signet ring cells were
not prominent in any of the LLIMCa cases. Scattered intracyto-
plasmic vacuoles were seen in some cases of LLIMCa. Overall,
LLIMCas were morphologically difﬁcult or even impossible to
classify deﬁnitively as either lobular or ductal on H&E sections
alone
(Fig.
1a,
b).
Immunohistochemically,
all
tumor
cells
demonstrated distinct and circumferential membranous expres-
sion of both E-cadherin and p120 catenin, characteristic of ductal
phenotype (Fig. 1c, d). In contrast, ILCs were characterized by
either complete loss or aberrant expression of E-cadherin, coupled
with predominantly cytoplasmic p120 catenin (Fig. 2).
In addition, β-catenin stain was performed on all 14 cases (7
LLIMCas and 7 ILCs) randomly selected for the exploratory
genomic analysis. All 7 cases of LLIMCa demonstrated membra-
nous expression. All 7 cases of ILC revealed granular cytoplasmic
uptake of β-catenin (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). A recent study
identiﬁed a group of ILCs with N-terminal-deﬁcient E-cadherin
while preserving E-cadherin C-terminus28. To conﬁrm whether
LLIMCas in the present study were, in fact, ILCs with N-terminal-
deﬁcient yet C-terminal-conserved E-cadherin protein, we sub-
jected the above 14 cases to IHC staining of antibodies against
E-cadherin N-terminus. All 7 LLIMCas showed membranous
staining, while all 7 ILCs were negative for N-terminal E-cadherin
(Supplementary Fig. 3).

Clinical characteristics
A comparison of the clinical characteristics of LLIMCa (n = 166),
IDC (n = 100), and ILC (n = 104) (Table 1) revealed that patients
with LLIMCa presented at a slightly older mean age (60.6 years)
compared to those with IDC (57 years, p = 0.035), but were similar
in age to ILC patients (61.6 years, p = 0.493). During the study
period, LLIMCa patients more often (81%) underwent breast-
conserving segmental resection as the ﬁrst surgical procedure,
compared to ILC (63%, p = 0.003) and IDC (52%, p < 0.0001)
patients. In contrast, a signiﬁcantly higher number of LLIMCa (83%,
p < 0.0001) and ILC (75%, p < 0.0001) patients received adjuvant
radiation therapy compared to IDC patients (47%), who had a
signiﬁcantly higher number of total mastectomies and avoided
subsequent radiation. There were no differences in adjuvant
systemic endocrine therapy or chemotherapy among the three
tumor types. Albeit not statistically signiﬁcant, the proportions of
patients
with
LLIMCa
developing
locoregional
recurrence
appeared to be intermediate between ILC and IDC. In contrast,
ILC was associated with a signiﬁcantly higher frequency of
locoregional recurrence compared to IDC. No difference in the
patterns of distant metastasis was observed between different
tumor types in our study.
Pathological characteristics
A comparison of the pathologic features of LLIMCa, ILC, and IDC
(Table 2) demonstrated that the mean tumor size of LLIMCas
(1.9 cm) was intermediate between IDCs (1.55 cm, p < 0.012) and
ILCs (2.7 cm, p < 0.0001). As a result, LLIMCas presented at a higher
pT stage than IDCs but a lower pT stage than ILCs.
LLIMCas was more likely to have positive or close margins (37%)
in the ﬁrst surgical procedure compared to IDCs (19%, p = 0.003)
but was similar to ILCs (35%, p = 0.261). LLIMCas were found to
have a signiﬁcantly higher rate of lymphovascular space invasion
(27%) than ILCs (11%, p = 0.002) but were similar to IDCs (22%,
p = 0.465). No differences in multifocality, number of tumor foci,
tumor-associated calciﬁcations, lymph node status, or pN stage
were observed between any of the tumor types.
Within the group of nuclear grade 1 and 2 tumors, as designed
in the current study, LLIMCas exhibited a higher Nottingham
grade and score than IDCs and ILCs. A substantial number of IDC
were Nottingham grade I (grade I: 46%, grade II: 54%) due to the
presence of tubule formation, whereas LLIMCas (grade I: 7%, grade
II: 93%, p < 0.0001) and ILCs (grade I: 18%, grade II: 82%,
p < 0.0001) were more likely to be grade II due to the lack of
tubules. Additionally, LLIMCas frequently had higher Nottingham
grades and scores compared to ILCs (p = 0.005), owing to the
larger nuclei and more frequent mitoses.
Pathological–radiological correlation of tumor size
Analysis of the pathologic and radiologic tumor sizes at the time
of diagnosis (Table 3) revealed that LLIMCas had a similar mean
tumor size (1.35 cm) as IDCs (1.5 cm, p = 0.202) on radiologic
measurement, which was smaller than that of ILCs (1.7 cm,
p = 0.01). The ﬁnal tumor size of LLIMCas (1.9 cm) upon pathologic
examination of the resection specimen was intermediate between
that of IDCs (1.55 cm, p = 0.012) and ILCs (2.7 cm, p < 0.0001). The
majority of both LLIMCas (71%) and ILCs (75%) revealed larger
pathologic tumor size compared to radiologic tumor size, whereas
IDCs showed an even distribution of pathologic tumor size rather
consistent with radiologic size. As a result, the pathologic to
radiologic tumor size ratio of LLIMCas (1.6) was similar to ILCs (1.8)
but signiﬁcantly higher than that of IDC (1.1, p < 0.0001),
indicating that the pathologic tumor size of either LLIMCas or
ILCs was much larger than the tumor size estimated by imaging.
Prognostic biomarkers
LLIMCa displayed similar proﬁles of estrogen receptor (ER),
progesterone receptor (PR), and Ki67 compared to ILC and IDC
(Table 4), even though the mean ER H-score of LLIMCas (248) was
slightly higher than that of ILCs (231, p = 0.046). LLIMCas
appeared to show a higher rate of HER2 positivity (10%) compared
to ILCs (1%, p = 0.004) and IDCs (1%, p = 0.004) in the study
population. However, only a small percentage (3 of 16, 1.8%) of
the HER2-positive LLIMCas were IHC 3+; the others were IHC 2+
and ampliﬁed by FISH with low HER2 copies but HER2/CEP17 ratio
crossing the 2 cut-offs. The low HER2 positivity rate in IDC was
attributed to the exclusion of nuclear grade 3 tumors. Both
LLIMCas and ILCs demonstrated signiﬁcantly higher Magee
Equation 2 (ME2) scores compared to IDC (Table 4). The ME2
score distribution, however, was similar between LLIMCas and ILCs
(33% of cases with a score <18 for both LLIMCas and ILCs
compared to 50% of cases with a score <18 for IDCs).

cytoplasmic reactivity for p120 (d 200×). Scale bar = 100 µm.

Long-term survival analysis
For all three groups of patients, the median follow-up time for
survival analysis was 10 years or longer (LLIMCa: 130 months,
range
12.3–186.6
months;
ILC:
128.7
months,
range
28.8–185.1 months; IDC: 119.2, range 7.3–168.1 months). In the
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, although LLIMCas appeared to
harbor an intermediate survival between IDCs and ILCs, statistical
signiﬁcance was not reached (Fig. 3) in either separate or
combined sets of comparisons (Supplementary Data sets). Lower
tumor grade (grade I), lower pT stage (pT1), lower pN stage
(pN0 + pN1), and lower ME2 score (<18) were associated with
signiﬁcantly improved recurrence-free survival (RFS), distant RFS
(DRFS), and breast cancer-speciﬁc survival (BCSS) (Table 5, Fig. 4
for BCSS, and Supplementary Data sets). Lower pT stage (pT1),
lower pN stage (pN0 + pN1), and lower ME2 score (<18) were
associated with signiﬁcantly improved overall survival (OS) (Table 5
and Supplementary Data sets). Multivariable Cox proportional

showed
statistically
signiﬁcant
improved RFS, DRFS, OS, and BCSS associated with lower pT
stage (pT1) and lower ME2 score (<18) (Supplementary Data sets).
Somatic genetic alterations and mutation signatures
As an exploratory, hypothesis-generating analysis, we compared
the repertoire of somatic genetic alterations of randomly selected
7 ILC and 7 LLIMCa cases from the current cohort (H&E and IHC
stains shown in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2) subjected to the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Memorial Sloan
Kettering (MSK) Integrated Mutation Proﬁling of Actionable Cancer
Targets (MSK-IMPACT) targeted sequencing assay (Fig. 5, Supple-
mentary Table 1). Copy number analysis revealed 16q LOH in all
cases (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table 2), consistent with their ER-
positive status and lower Nottingham grades. In addition to 16q
LOH, this analysis revealed that all bona ﬁde ILCs harbored CDH1
loss-of-function biallelic mutations (7/7), of which ﬁve were
frameshift indel and two were splice site mutations uniformly
coupled with LOH of the wild-type allele. Conversely, ﬁve of the
seven LLIMCas did not harbor CDH1 mutations or genomic
rearrangements. CDH1 alterations were identiﬁed in 2 LLIMCas:
one (case DL09, Fig. 5) only harbored a subclonal CDH1 in-frame
indel mutation coupled with LOH. This case mostly displayed
membranous E-cadherin and p120 expression with focal areas of
aberrant expression (cytoplasmic E-cadherin instead of membra-
nous reactivity, supplementary ﬁg. 4), which was identiﬁed only
after careful re-review following the genomic analyses. The other
CDH1-mutated LLIMCa (case DL11, Fig. 5) harbored a complex in-
frame indel (i.e., one intronic deletion, one splice site mutation
(p.X441_splice) and a frameshift indel (p.D443Gfs*10) in cis) with
negligible impact on protein structure coupled with subclonal
LOH. As expected, based on the genomic proﬁle, DL11 displayed
membranous expression of all four IHC markers (both N- and
C-terminal-E-cadherin,
p120,
and
β-catenin,

loss-of-function mutations characteristic of ILCs, and none of the
CDH1 alterations detected in the analyzed LLIMCas was biallelic.
They are predicted not to affect gene function and are neither
pathogenic nor clinically meaningful.

was found to be dominant in 25% (1/4) of ILCs, and 43% (3/7) of
LLIMCas displayed mutational signatures attributed to aging.
Seven LLIMCas were subjected to CDH1 promoter methylation
assessment by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). This analysis revealed
that four of the seven LLIMCas displayed CDH1 promoter
methylation (Fig. 5, supplementary table 3), and these cases
displayed slightly reduced E-cadherin expression (intensity of
E-cadherin staining classiﬁed by one author (R.B.) prior to
methylation testing), including the 2 LLIMCas that harbored
CDH1 alterations (DL09 and DL11). Two of the remaining 3
LLIMCas
were
unmethylated,
and
in
one
case,
the
CDH1
methylation status was not accessible as the results did not meet
the qualitative standards. The comparative analysis of the
repertoire of somatic genetic alterations, patterns of gene copy
number proﬁles, and mutational signatures present in LLIMCas
and classical ILCs did not reveal any signiﬁcant differences.
DISCUSSION
Here we report a series of distinct breast carcinomas that we term
as LLIMCa, characterized by low- to intermediate-grade uniform
cells and exhibiting discohesive lobular-like growth patterns while
maintaining intact adhesion molecule E-cadherin expression. In
short, LLIMCa demonstrates some features similar to ILC but
different from IDC, such as signiﬁcantly larger pathologic tumor
size than the size estimated on imaging, more frequent positive or
close margins with breast-conserving surgery, higher Nottingham
grade and score, and higher ME2 scores; some features similar to
IDC such as higher rate of lymphovascular space invasion; and
some features intermediate between ILC and IDC such as tumor
size and pT stage. The study identiﬁes several important ﬁndings
worthy of close attention.
First, LLIMCas display a discohesive lobular-like morphologic
pattern in the presence of membranous staining by E-cadherin
(with both C- and N-terminal antibodies), p120, and β-catenin. A
dysfunctional E-cadherin/catenin complex due to genetic or
epigenetic biallelic inactivation of CDH1 is the deﬁning hallmark
of ILC. The dynamic alteration of the E-cadherin/p120 complex is
thought to be responsible for the changes in cell motility and,
accordingly,
the
dispersed
inﬁltrative
morphology
of
ILC6,7,11,21,29–33. In the present study, the distinct membranous
staining for all four currently used IHC markers of E-cadherin/
catenin
complex
in
LLIMCa
suggests
that
the
phenotypic
appearance of discohesive, diffuse growth pattern observed in
this particular type of invasive carcinoma has occurred in the
presence
of
an
intact
E-cadherin/p120
junctional
complex.
Correspondingly, in the 14 randomly selected cases subjected to
the exploratory genomic analyses, CDH1 loss-of-function biallelic
mutations are identiﬁed in all 7 bona ﬁde ILC cases. In contrast,
none of the 7 LLIMCa cases harbors the pathogenic CDH1 loss-of-
function mutation. Rather, the only CDH1 alterations detected in
two of the LLIMCas consists of in-frame indels that are predicted
not to affect gene function and are neither pathogenic nor
clinically meaningful. It appears that the mechanisms driving the
typical appearance of LLIMCa are not dependent on CDH1 biallelic
loss-of-function mutations or E-cadherin/catenin complex geno-
mic alterations. However, CDH1 promoter methylation assessment
reveals that four of the seven LLIMCas are methylated. This result
raises the tantalizing hypothesis that the abnormal (slightly
reduced) E-cadherin expression pattern observed in these four
cases, which is not observed in the unmethylated LLIMCas (strong
membranous expression), might be associated with epigenetic
mechanisms. Hence, the assessment of CDH1 methylation status,
using a sensitive ddPCR method and tissue microdissection to
ensure high tumor purity, should be considered in the presence of
even slightly reduced E-cadherin expression in cancers lacking
bona ﬁde biallelic CDH1 pathogenic mutations. Our ﬁndings
warrant further whole-genome sequencing, epigenomic and RNA-
sequencing analyses to deﬁne the mechanistic basis for the
phenotypic features of LLIMCas. Another ﬁnding worth noting is
the presence of a dominant ABOBEC mutational signature in 57%
(4 of 7 tested) of LLIMCas. ABOBEC signatures are more frequent in
ILCs compared to IDCs and have been suggested as a biomarker
of resistance to endocrine therapy34. This should also be further
investigated.
Second, LLIMCas often harbor signiﬁcantly larger pathologic
tumor size than the size estimated on imaging and frequently
positive or close margins at the ﬁrst surgical procedure. This
appears to be associated with lobular-like tumor morphology
despite the preservation of the E-cadherin/catenin complex. In the
past decade, multiple studies and consensus guidelines have
recommended preoperative MRI for optimal management of
patients with ILC, given its high sensitivity and better accuracy of
measuring tumor size and multifocal disease35–39. Similar ﬁndings
have been reported in “IDC with lobular features” on core
biopsy40. Moreover, the percentage of aberrant E-cadherin and
p120 expression was found to be irrelevant to additional diseases
detected on MRI in such patients41. Given the ﬁndings in our

study, we contend that distinguishing LLIMCas from the usual
type IDCs in the biopsy report may be required and that
preoperative MRI should be considered to guide surgical manage-
ment for this type of invasive breast carcinoma.
Third, all three types of invasive carcinomas in our study cohort
show essentially no statistically signiﬁcant difference in hormone
receptor status or prognosis, including long-term survival. Most of
the previous studies included tumors of all nuclear grades23,24,
whereas ILCs consist of signiﬁcantly more low- to intermediate-
grade Luminal A-type tumors and are more often hormone
receptor-positive compared to IDCs. As a result, the differences
reported in prior studies might have been differences between
low- to intermediate-grade versus high-grade tumors rather than
between ductal and lobular cancers. In our study design, we
excluded all nuclear grade 3 tumors. Therefore, since we have a
distinctively uniform low- to intermediate-grade tumor population
with different phenotypes, the similar hormone receptor status,
and survival outcome might be a reﬂection of the inherent nature
of low-intermediate grade, ER-positive Luminal A-like tumors
regardless of histologic phenotypes. Genomic studies of the mixed
ductal and lobular carcinomas revealed that all components in
such cases were frequently clonally related, suggesting shared
origins of a common neoplastic clone42. Moreover, several lines of
studies revealed that ILC shared common genetic alterations with
low-grade IDC and direct clonal divergence from the ductal to the
lobular phenotype occurred late in tumor evolution, where the
aberrant E-cadherin expression appeared to be a key distinguish-
ing switch30,43,44. Hence, the multistep model of breast cancer
progression suggests that ILCs or tumors exhibiting lobular-like
growth patterns may arise from the low-grade, ER-positive
“ductal” pathway10,42–46. Whether LLIMCa represents an inter-
mediate form in the phenotypic switch from ductal to lobular type
is yet to be determined.
Lastly, although an accurate diagnosis of LLIMCa is required for
proper pre-surgical evaluation and local therapy, the prognosis of
these tumors remains deﬁned by the traditional prognostic factors
as well as the multivariable model ME2. Our survival analysis fails
to show statistically signiﬁcant differences when LLIMCa is
compared to ILC or IDC, either by itself or in combined groups
with IDC or ILC. In contrast, the traditional prognostic markers are
associated with signiﬁcantly improved survival. Interestingly, the
ME2 score <18 is associated with signiﬁcant improvement in all
four survival measurements (RFS, DRFS, OS, and BCSS). Since ME2
only uses readily available histopathologic and IHC data from
pathology reports at no additional cost, its use should be
encouraged in routine practice.
Our study does have some limitations. The study cohort is
retrospectively extracted from a single institution, a 6-year period
archive, during which time we started routine E-cadherin/
p120 stains on invasive tumors with lobular-like growth patterns.
The retrospective nature and relatively small sample size could be
the potential basis for the non-signiﬁcant clinicopathologic and
survival observations. In addition, only a limited number of cases
are sequenced for the pilot molecular analyses. Ideally, multicenter
prospective outcome studies along with whole-genome sequen-
cing, epigenomic and RNA-sequencing analyses to deﬁne the
mechanistic basis for the phenotypic features of LLIMCas would
be useful to corroborate the ﬁndings.

Despite these limitations, we present a series of LLIMCas with
morphologic features mimicking those of ILCs, but maintaining
immunophenotypic membranous E-cadherin expression charac-
teristic of IDCs, and typically spared of the pathogenic CDH1 loss-
of-function gene mutations. Their morphologic discohesion could
be partly explained by CDH1 promoter methylation in some but
not all cases. One could potentially argue to classify all tumors
with lobular-like growth patterns as ILCs regardless of E-cadherin
expression in the current practice setting of breast cancer
treatment. Yet, the interobserver agreement for the diagnosis of
ILC without IHC is moderate at best. The holy grail of under-
standing different types of breast carcinoma is to develop more
targeted and personalized clinical treatment; germane to this
endeavor is the correct cataloging of distinct phenotypes in a
systematic manner. We would contend that to facilitate future
investigations in elucidating ductal versus lobular phenotypes at
molecular, evolutional, functional, and therapeutic levels, accu-
rately identifying LLIMCas and separating LLIMCas from the typical
IDCs or ILCs would be justiﬁed. From a patient management
standpoint, we suggest that preoperative MRI be entertained to
guide the surgical management of patients with LLIMCa.

Case selection and IHC studies
The study protocol was approved by the University of Pittsburgh
Institutional Review Board with a waiver of the informed consent.
All invasive mammary carcinomas with ambiguous histomorphol-
ogy for ductal or lobular differentiation and, therefore, with IHC
C-terminus E-cadherin stain (Clone: 36; Catalog # 790-4497;
Vendor: Ventana, Tucson, AZ; Dilution: ready to use [RTU]; Pre-
treatment: CC1-S 64 min; Detection: Ultraview; Staining platform:
Ventana Benchmark Ultra) performed were extracted from a
6-year (2004–2009) archive at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital.
Among them, the cases from 2007 to 2009 also had concurrent
p120 stain (Clone: 98; Catalog # 610134; Vendor: BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ; Dilution: 1:200; Pre-treatment: CC1-S; Detection:
Ultraview; Staining platform: Ventana Benchmark Ultra) per-
formed. Cases were classiﬁed as LLIMCas only if they displayed
the criteria mentioned previously. In contrast, cases were classiﬁed
as ILCs if they displayed absent and/or aberrant E-cadherin
staining along with cytoplasmic p120 staining. Fourteen cases
submitted for sequencing were also stained for beta-catenin
(Clone: B-catenin-1; Catalog # M3539, Vendor: Dako, Santa Clara,
CA; Dilution: 1:250; Pre-treatment: CC1 24 minutes; Detection:

Vendor: Leica Biosystems, Deer Park, IL; Dilution: RTU; Pre-
treatment: ER2 20 min; Detection: DAB polymer reﬁne; Staining
platform: Leica Bond III).
The following cases were excluded from the extracted cohort to
allow for more homogeneous comparison among different tumor
groups and more accurate assessment of clinical outcomes: (1)
mixed ductal and lobular carcinomas with either mixed compo-
nents or indeterminate variable E-cadherin and p120 staining
patterns; (2) high grade (nuclear grade 3) carcinomas; (3)
tubulolobular carcinomas; (3) microinvasive carcinomas (≤1 mm);
(4) concurrent multifocal tumor with different morphology; (5)
patients with neoadjuvant treatment; (6) patients with previous
cancer diagnosis; (7) cases with no in-house primary surgical
resection or incomplete follow-up information.
Ultimately, 166 cases of LLIMCa and 104 cases of ILC were
identiﬁed. Additionally, 100 cases of grade 1 or 2 typical IDC
(carcinoma, no special type) were retrieved over the same period
for comparison analysis.
In addition, β-catenin stain (Clone: β-catenin-1; Vendor: Agilent
(Dako), Santa Clara, CA; Dilution: 1:250; Pre-treatment: CC1 24’;
Detection: OptiView; Staining platform: Ventana Benchmark Ultra)
and N-terminal-E-cadherin stain (Clone: 36B5; Vendor: Leica, Deer
Park, IL; Dilution: RTU; Pre-treatment: ER2, 20’; Detection: DAB
Polymer Reﬁne; Staining platform: Leica Bond III) were performed
on the 14 LLIMCa and ILC cases randomly selected for the
exploratory genomic tests.
Tissue preparation and DNA extraction
Ten 8 μm-thick sections from each representative formalin-ﬁxed
parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) tumor and matched normal tissue
blocks of 7 LLIMCas and 7 classical ILCs were stained with nuclear
fast red and subjected to microdissection using a sterile needle
under a stereomicroscope (Olympus SZ61) to enrich tumor cell

from the tumor and matched normal tissue using the QIAamp

instructions.
MSK-IMPACT sequencing
Tumor and normal DNA from each case were subjected to
massively parallel sequencing targeting all coding regions of 505
cancer-related genes using the FDA-approved MSK-IMPACT assay
as previously described47,49. The median depth of coverage of
tumor and normal samples was 758× (range: 502×–1167×) and
389× (range: 145×–540×), respectively. In brief, reads were aligned
to
the
reference
human
genome
GRCh37
using
the
Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA v0.7.15)50. The Genome Analysis
Toolkit (GATK. V3.1.1)51 was employed for local realignment,
duplicate removal, and base quality recalibration. Somatic single
nucleotide variants (SNVs) were detected by MuTect (v1.0)52,
insertions, and deletions (indels) by Strelka53, Varscan254, Scal-
pel55, and Lancet56. All mutations were manually inspected using
the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). The cancer cell fraction
(CCF) of each mutation was inferred, as well as clonal probability,
using ABSOLUTE57. Copy number alterations (CNAs) and LOH were
determined using FACETS58. Mutations targeting hotspot loci were
assigned according to Chang et al.59. Mutational signatures were
inferred using Signature Multivariate Analysis (SigMA) based on all
synonymous and nonsynonymous somatic mutations60. Exposure-
based dominant mutational signatures obtained by SigMA, an
algorithm previously validated for the analysis of formalin-ﬁxed
parafﬁn-embedded samples, were reported in cases with at least 5
SNVs (Supplementary Table 3), as previously described48. The
repertoire of non-synonymous somatic mutations, mutational
frequencies, and CNAs of classical ILCs were compared to genetic
alterations affecting LLIMCas.
CDH1 promoter methylation assessment by digital droplet
PCR
Following
PicoGreen quantiﬁcation,
0.2–9 ng bisulﬁte-treated
genomic DNA was combined with locus-speciﬁc primers targeting
the two CDH1 promoter CpG islands, FAM- and HEX-labeled
probes (Supplementary Table 3), the restriction enzyme HaeIII, and
digital PCR Supermix for probes (no dUTP). CpG Methylated DNA
(ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) and Universal Unmethylated DNA
(Millipore, Burlington, MA) were used as positive and negative
controls, respectively. All reactions were performed on a QX200
ddPCR system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and each sample was
evaluated in two technical duplicates.
Reactions were partitioned into ~41 K droplets per well using
the QX200 droplet generator. Emulsiﬁed PCRs were run on a 96-
well thermal cycler using the following cycling conditions: 95 °C
10’; 50 cycles of 94 °C 60’ and 54 °C 2’; 98 °C 10’. Plates were read
and analyzed using the QuantaSoft software (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA) to assess the number of droplets positive for CDH1 promoter
methylated, unmethylated, both, or neither. Methylation Fre-
quency (MF) was inferred as MF = 100 * Methylated/(Methy-
lated + Unmethylated). Methylation of the CDH1 promoter was
deﬁned as higher than 35 methylated droplets.
Clinical characteristics
A review of patient’s electronic medical records was conducted to
obtain the following information: (1) age at diagnosis; (2) date of
ﬁrst diagnosis; (3) type of ﬁrst surgical procedure; (4) adjuvant
therapies; (5) date of ﬁrst recurrence; (6) type of recurrence and
site of distant metastasis; (7) date and status at last follow-up (for
patients who developed non-breast new malignancies, the last
contact date was censored at the date of new malignancy
diagnosis); (8) date and cause of death.
Pathologic characteristics
Pathology reports of the ﬁrst surgical procedure were reviewed to
obtain the following tumor pathologic characteristics: (1) multi-
focality and, if present, number of foci; (2) tumor size; (3) tumor
Nottingham grade; (4) Nottingham score; (5) tumor-associated
microcalciﬁcations; (6) lymphovascular space invasion; (7) margin
status at ﬁrst surgery; (8) lymph node status; (9) pathologic stages
of tumor (pT) and lymph node (pN).
Predictive and prognostic biomarkers
Results of the IHC stains for ER, PR, HER2, and Ki67 were extracted
from the pathology reports. ER and PR were scored by the
modiﬁed histologic score (H-score) method, calculated by multi-
plying the intensity of expression (0–3) by the percentage of cells
showing that intensity (0–100%). The sum of these numbers was
referred to as the H-score. H-score ≥1 was considered positive.
HER2 was scored per the FDA-cleared interpretation guide for
Ventana anti-HER2 antibody. We started performing Ki67 stain on
invasive breast carcinomas in late 2007, and the proliferation
index was scored as a percentage of cells with staining of any
intensity.
ME2 scores were calculated for all cases. ME2 is one of the
multivariable models developed to estimate the Oncotype DX®
recurrence score61–63. ME1 and ME3 require a Ki-67 proliferation
index, while ME2 does not. Since the Ki-67 proliferation index was
unavailable for most of the cases, only ME2 scores were calculated.
Tumor size pathology-radiology correlation
The ﬁnal tumor size was obtained by pathologic evaluation of the
primary surgical resection. The size of the tumor estimated
radiologically was recorded from the mammographic or ultra-
sound imaging reports at the time of the diagnostic core biopsy.
Pathology-to-radiology tumor size ratio was calculated and used
as one of the variables for comparing different tumor types.
Outcome and survival analysis
Clinical outcome analysis included recurrence rate, recurrence
type, and sites of metastasis. Loco-regional recurrence was
deﬁned as a tumor arising in the treated breast/chest wall or
within regional lymph nodes. Taking into account the ﬁndings
published in the literature64–66, we separated the patterns of
distant metastatic sites into lobular-like (gynecologic or gastro-
intestinal organs, regardless of any other site involvement), ductal-
like (lung, pleura, liver, brain, lymph node, with or without bone
involvement), and neutral (bone only).
Long-term survival data included RFS, DRFS, OS, and BCSS. RFS
was deﬁned as the time from diagnosis to ﬁrst recurrence (local or
distant) or the date of the last contact. DRFS was deﬁned as the
time from diagnosis to ﬁrst distant recurrence or the date of the
last contact. OS was deﬁned as the time from diagnosis to death
due to any cause or the date of the last contact. BCSS was deﬁned
as the time from diagnosis to death due to breast cancer or the
date of the last contact.
Statistical analysis
For comparison of means, independent sample t-tests were
performed. Univariable analysis was performed using χ2 and
Fisher exact tests to compare the differences in percentages
between groups. A p-value < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
Long-term survival data, including RFS, DRFS, OS, and BCSS, were
analyzed via Kaplan–Meier curves for different tumor types (all
3 subtypes simultaneously, LLIMCa versus ILC, LLIMCa versus IDC,
ILC versus IDC) and after combining LLIMCa with IDC (i.e., ILC
versus IDC + LLIMCa) or ILC (i.e., IDC versus ILC + LLIMCa). A log-
rank test was used to compare Kaplan–Meier curves. Survival

analysis was also performed for known prognostic variables
(grade, nodal status, pT stage, pN stage) and ME2 score categories.
The variables showing statistically signiﬁcant differences in
survival by log-rank test were included for multivariable Cox
proportional hazard regression analysis. Statistical analysis was
performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY:
IBM Corp.
