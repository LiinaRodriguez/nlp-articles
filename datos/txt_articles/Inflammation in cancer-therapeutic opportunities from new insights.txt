Abstract 
As one part of the innate immune response to external stimuli, chronic inflammation increases the risk of various can-
cers, and tumor-promoting inflammation is considered one of the enabling characteristics of cancer development. 
Recently, there has been growing evidence on the role of anti-inflammation therapy in cancer prevention and treat-
ment. And researchers have already achieved several noteworthy outcomes. In the review, we explored the underly-
ing mechanisms by which inflammation affects the occurrence and development of cancer. The pro- or anti-tumor 
effects of these inflammatory factors such as interleukin, interferon, chemokine, inflammasome, and extracellular 
matrix are discussed. Since FDA-approved anti-inflammation drugs like aspirin show obvious anti-tumor effects, 
these drugs have unique advantages due to their relatively fewer side effects with long-term use compared 
to chemotherapy drugs. The characteristics make them promising candidates for cancer chemoprevention. Overall, 
this review discusses the role of these inflammatory molecules in carcinogenesis of cancer and new inflammation 
molecules-directed therapeutic opportunities, ranging from cytokine inhibitors/agonists, inflammasome inhibitors, 
some inhibitors that have already been or are expected to be applied in clinical practice, as well as recent discoveries 
of the anti-tumor effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The advan-
tages and disadvantages of their application in cancer chemoprevention are also discussed.

Introduction
German physician Rudolf Virchow first reported the rela-
tionship between inflammation and tumors in the nine-
teenth century [1]. Chronic inflammatory processes are 
a fundamental innate immune response to perturbed 
tissue homeostasis and affect multiple stages of tumor 
development, including initiation, promotion, malig-
nant conversion, invasion, and metastasis [2]. It is esti-
mated that 15–20% of tumor-related deaths are linked to 
inflammation.
Recently, a growing body of evidence from basic 
research and clinical data indicates that inflamma-
tory molecules and inflammation pathways can pro-
mote the occurrence and progression of various tumors. 
Pro-inflammatory cytokines, like interleukin (IL)−6, 
IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), as well as

transcription factors, like nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) 
and signal transducer and activator of transcription 
3 (STAT3), are key players in this relationship [3–7]. 
Encouraged by pro-inflammatory cytokines, NF-κB and 
STAT3 can control the expression of target genes, the 
majority of which are carcinogenic, and increase the 
ability of cancer cells to survive, proliferate, invade, and 
spread [8–10]. It is now well-acknowledged that chemi-
cals and processes associated with inflammation can be 
valuable targets for cancer prevention and treatment.
During the past decades, there has been strong epi-
demiological evidence showing that nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), especially aspirin, have 
been associated with a reduction in the incidence and 
mortality of a variety of types of cancer with long-term 
use, especially colorectal cancer (CRC) [11, 12]. In 2016, 
the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recom-
mended low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of CRC 
for adults aged 50–59 years [13]. Besides, low-dose aspi-
rin or non-aspirin NSAIDs intake is inversely related to 
gastric cancer risk based on multiple meta-analyses [14–
16]. Recent research based on electronic endoscopy [20] 
and territory-wide healthcare databases [17] also verified 
these results. Except for CRC and gastric cancer, aspirin 
use also reduces the incidence and mortality of endo-
metrial cancer [18], breast cancer [19, 20], esophageal 
cancer [21], liver cancer [22], and more. Besides, other 
NSAIDs and steroid anti-inflammatory drugs also have 
obvious anti-tumor effects. For example, the novel indo-
methacin derivative CZ-212–3 showed antitumor effects 
in castration-resistant prostate cancer [23]; indomethacin 
sensitized death receptor 5 (DR5)-deficient tumor cells to 
adoptive T-cell therapy [24]; indomethacin-loaded nano-
capsules treatment reduced glioblastoma growth in a rat 
model [25]. These suggest that FDA-approved NSAIDs 
and steroid anti-inflammatory drugs are promising can-
didate drugs for cancer prevention and treatment.
In this review, the detailed information on cytokines 
and their function in tumorigenesis are comprehen-
sively analyzed, and their potential as therapeutic targets 
for cancer treatment and chemoprevention and their 
inhibitor/agonists applied in preclinical and clinical stud-
ies are also clarified. Uncovering the exact mechanisms 
of inflammation and inflammatory factors enabled the 
development of novel, tailored, and highly effective can-
cer prevention and treatment strategies. We also dis-
cussed Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved 
non-anti-tumor drugs that may help prevent and treat 
cancer-related chronic inflammation, such as aspirin, 
indomethacin, celecoxib, and other NSAIDs and steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs. The effects of these medicines 
on proinflammatory cytokines and inflammation-related 
pathways are addressed, and typical clinical study data 
are presented. According to data from the current review, 
agents that target chronic inflammation may have a wide 
range of applications in the future for the prevention and 
treatment of cancer.
The relationship between inflammation and cancer
The process of inflammation
Infection, tissue injury, tissue stress, and malfunction 
are the main causes of inflammation, and they can cause 
different physiological reactions and pathological out-
comes [26]. The acute inflammatory response is triggered 
by infection or tissue injury, and the blood components 
including plasma and leukocytes will be recruited to the 
site of infection and injury [27]. A chronic inflammatory 
state ensues if the acute inflammatory response fails to 
eliminate the pathogen [28]. Except for consistent nox-
ious stimuli like pathogens, other causes of tissue damage 
such as autoimmune responses or undegradable foreign 
bodies, can also lead to chronic inflammation [26].
Specialized sensors elicit the mediators of inflam-
mation, which are activated by inducers of inflamma-
tion. The mediators, in turn, alter the functional states 
of tissues and organs (which are the effectors of inflam-
mation). Based on their biological characteristics, the 
inflammatory mediators can be classified into seven 
groups, including vasoactive amines, vasoactive peptides, 
fragments of complement components, lipid mediators, 
cytokines, chemokines, and proteolytic enzymes.
The cellular and molecular events during inflamma-
tion include a series of complex events, from in  situ 
to systemic inflammation throughout the body. When 
microbes infect the body, an acute inflammatory 
response occurs, which will be recognized by the innate 
immune system, and triggered by Toll-like receptors 
(TLRs) and NOD-like receptors [29]. The initial recog-
nition of infection is mediated by tissue-resident mac-
rophages and mast cells, causing the production of 
many inflammatory mediators, including chemokines, 
cytokines, vasoactive amines, and others [30]. If the acute 
inflammatory response cannot clear the antigen, the 
inflammation process persists, and chronic inflammation 
occurs. The different effector classes of the T cells can 
lead to different inflammatory states [26].
The crosslink between inflammation, the immune system, 
metabolism and autophagy in cancer
Among the various inflammatory factors that contrib-
ute to cancer susceptibility, infection has come to be 
recognized as a primary cause of inflammation-induced 
carcinogenesis [2]. During infection, inflammation is a 
fundamental innate immune response to perturbed tis-
sues homeostasis, and inflammation associated with 
tumor development is triggered by many immune cells

[31]. The regulatory influence on the immune system 
determines whether inflammation exerts anti-tumori-
genic or pro-tumorigenic effects. Tumor heterogeneity 
is shaped immunologically and through immunosurveil-
lance by immunity’s anti-tumorigenic role. Simultane-
ously, pro-tumorigenic inflammation fosters cancer by 
suppressing anti-tumor immunity, modifying the TME 
to a more permissive state for tumors, and directly influ-
encing cancer and epithelial cells to promote tumors [32]. 
The factors that determine whether inflammation pro-
motes or suppresses cancer are various. Currently, there 
are several directions for cancer prevention and treat-
ment by regulating the immune system, including cancer 
vaccines and armored anti-tumor immune cells, various 
forms of immunotherapies, anti-tumor antibodies, and 
biological therapies.
A growing body of research suggests that immune cell 
functional changes throughout immunological responses 
are mediated by metabolic reprogramming [33]. These 
suggest that immune response and metabolic reprogram-
ming are necessary events during inflammation-induced 
carcinogenesis. Reprogrammed energy production and 
biosynthesis and epigenetic metabolic reprogramming 
occur in inflammation responses [34]. The immune 
system exerts anti-tumor effects through immuno-
surveillance and immunological sculpting of tumor 
heterogeneity, while inflammation promotes tumor 
development by blocking immunity and reshaping the 
tumor microenvironment by regulating multiple signal-
ing pathways and cellular functions [32].
Eating a diet that meets energy requirements and 
provides essential nutrients helps maintain a healthy 
immune system. Both undernutrition and overnutri-
tion are associated with immune dysfunction [35]. The 
immune system works in conjunction with the digestive 
system, where immunomodulatory and inflammatory 
processes are linked to gut bacteria and micronutri-
ents [36]. On one hand, people at risk for deficiencies of 
immune-enhancing micronutrients, such as the military 
population, are more susceptible to infection due to their 
nutritional status [37]. The immune function of soldiers 
consuming compound nutritional drinks with vitamins 
and minerals decreased slightly [38]. On the other hand, 
overeating can lead to the accumulation of excess body 
fat and obesity, which creates a chronic inflammatory 
state and worsens immunological deficiencies [36, 39].
Other biological factors, such as aging, also influence 
immune competence. The immune system undergoes 
several changes throughout a person’s life, beginning 
with the developing immune responses seen in new-
borns and children. This progression continues to an 
optimal immune function typically observed in teenagers 
and young adults. However, in older adults, the immune 
response may decline [40]. Certain lifestyle factors, 
including age-specific dietary choices, can worsen age-
related changes by influencing and modifying immune 
function, and in some cases, inhibiting it. Supplements 
designed for different age groups may provide a solid 
foundation for optimal immune function. Additionally, 
age significantly affects how the body responds to vac-
cines [41, 42]. Creating effective vaccine schedules can 
enhance the advantages of vaccination and increase the 
immunogenicity of vaccines.
Several transcription factors like NF-κB are central to 
immune and inflammatory responses [43]. Metabolic 
reprogramming occurs in immune cells during inflam-
matory stages, including energy production biosynthesis 
reprogramming, and epigenetic reprogramming [33].
Recent studies support the idea that autophagy, a fun-
damental biological process in mammals, is crucial for 
regulating inflammation and plays a significant role in 
cancer related to inflammation. Autophagy is gener-
ally considered a protective mechanism that helps pre-
vent the hyperactivation of inflammatory mediators and 
the malignancy caused by chronic inflammation [44]. 
Defects in canonical autophagy or mitophagy can lead 
to necrosis and pathogenic responses, which promote 
cancer and chronic inflammation [45]. Microorgan-
isms, damaged organelles, and crystals are sources of 
inflammatory signals, making canonical autophagy an 
anti-inflammatory process [46]. Autophagy influences 
immune cells by regulating mitochondrial and endoplas-
mic reticulum composition. These metabolic changes 
lead to immunometabolic states that affect macrophage 
and T cell polarization, ultimately impacting inflamma-
tion [47, 48]. The non-canonical autophagy, including 
LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) and its variants, such 
as LC3-associated endocytosis (LANDO), also utilizes 
some autophagy machinery and influences inflammation 
[49]. Research shows that LANDO’s long-term clearance 
of beta-amyloid (Ab) aggregates influences the recycling 
of Ab receptors and reduces inflammation [50]. When 
autophagy is inactivated, there is an increased produc-
tion and secretion of TNFα, type I and type II interferon 
(IFN), and other inflammatory cytokines [51]. Autophagy 
deficiency causes uncontrolled innate immune activation, 
leading to inflammatory diseases like Crohn’s disease and 
an increased risk of colon cancer [52].
Four signaling pathways link autophagy and inflamma-
tion in cancer progression: the reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) signaling pathway, the IκB kinase (IKK)/NF-κB 
signaling axis, the inflammatory cytokine signaling path-
way, and the TLR signaling cascade [53]. Autophagy-
related molecules like UVRAG, IRGM, ATG7, Pink1, and 
Park2, as well as several receptors, connect autophagy 
to inflammation and influence inflammation-induced

tumors. For example, mice with mutated UVRAG show 
intestinal inflammation and increased risk of colitis-asso-
ciated cancer through the NLRP3 inflammasome [54]. 
As a key negative regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome 
activation [55], immunity-related GTPase M (IRGM) 
mediates autophagy and enhances cell proliferation in 
hepatocellular carcinoma with overexpression of AGBL2 
[56]. The activation of ATG7 leads to a pro-inflammatory 
response dependent on NLRP3, which worsens lipotoxic-
ity in insulinoma [57]. Mice lacking Pink1 or Park2 are 
susceptible to Kras-driven pancreatic cancer due to the 
accumulation of mitochondrial iron and the subsequent 
activation of the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflam-
masome [58]. FUNDC1 (FUN14 domain-containing 1) 
is a mitophagy receptor in the mitochondrial membrane 
that suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) initia-
tion by reducing inflammasome activation and inflam-
mation [59].
As our understanding of the relationship between 
inflammation, the immune system, metabolism and 
autophagy in cancer deepens, new therapeutic targets 
that alter inflammation, the immune system, and metab-
olism are emerging.
Potential therapeutic strategies for cancer prevention 
and treatment in inflammation‑related cancer
Potential inflammatory therapeutic strategies for cancer 
prevention and treatment
It is becoming evident that the tumor microenvironment, 
which is mostly controlled by inflammatory cells, plays 
a crucial role in cancer development by promoting cell 
division, survival, and migration. Furthermore, certain 
innate immune system signaling molecules, including 
chemokines and their receptors for invasion, migration, 
and metastasis, have been appropriated by tumor cells. 
This knowledge is fostering new anti-inflammatory ther-
apy approaches to cancer genesis. Blocking antibodies 
for inflammatory molecules such as TNF-α has shown 
obvious therapeutic efficacy in some inflammatory dis-
eases and anti-tumor potential. Matrix metalloprotein-
ases (MMPs) inhibitors have been rapidly developed and 
applied in the clinic, but the outcomes were less than 
satisfactory, with efficacy reported mainly occurs during 
early tumor progression [60].
Based on epidemiological data and experimental data, 
the FDA-approved anti-inflammatory drugs exhibit sig-
nificant anti-tumor effects, suggesting the potential of 
these drugs as anti-tumor drugs and the targets of these 
drugs may act as promising targets for cancer preven-
tion and treatment. The molecular mechanism underly-
ing the anti-tumor effect of aspirin was first discovered 
in the 1970s, and it was demonstrated that it irrevers-
ibly acetylates and inactivates the cyclooxygenase (COX) 
enzyme [61]. Since the cancer-promoting effect of COX, 
many COX inhibitors have been synthesized and have 
the potential as therapeutic drugs in patients with cancer. 
For example, flurbiprofen suppressed cell proliferation in 
colorectal cancer [62], non-small cell lung cancer [63], 
and others. While the other anti-tumor mechanisms of 
NSAIDs represented by aspirin and steroidal anti-inflam-
matory drugs were partly known. Understanding these 
processes and molecular mechanisms will provide new 
targets for the prevention and treatment of tumors. For 
instance, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase 
catalytic subunit alpha isoform (PIK3CA)/protein kinase 
B (AKT)/phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), 
wingless-type MMTV integration site family (Wnt)-β 
catenin, and NF-κB pathways are signaling pathways that 
are significantly activated in cancer, patients with muta-
tions of these pathways showed increased survival after 
using NSAIDs [64]. Besides, as the important parts of the 
inflammatory pathway, cytokines, chemokines, growth 
factors, and components of the extracellular matrix-
directed therapy have shown certain effects in anti-tumor 
treatment. These targets will be summarized in Table 2.
Potential immune therapeutic strategies for cancer 
prevention and treatment
As an innate immune response to the imbalance of tis-
sue homeostasis, inflammation affects all stages of 
the occurrence and development of tumors, including 
regulating aberrant tissue repair, genotoxicity, prolif-
erative responses, invasion, and metastasis. At the same 
time, tumors modulate the inflammatory environment 
through the secretion of soluble growth factors and 
chemo-attractants, causing inflammatory cells to inhibit 
the anti-tumor T-cell response [2]. Moreover, patients 
with similar illness stages but different racial/ethnic 
backgrounds or places of residence may exhibit signifi-
cantly different tumor mutational burdens due to the 
consequences of exposure to persistent inflammation, 
which would change the immune system and the biol-
ogy of tumors [65]. The complicated interplay of host, 
tumor, and environmental variables determines immu-
nity and controls the magnitude and timing of the anti-
cancer response. Tumors successfully suppress immune 
responses by activating negative regulatory pathways 
(also known as checkpoints) linked by acquiring char-
acteristics that allow them to evade detection actively 
[66–68]. For various malignancies, immunotherapy is 
proven to be an efficient therapeutic strategy. Although 
antibodies targeting the immune regulators CTLA4 and 
programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)/programmed 
cell death protein 1 (PD-1) have shown promising thera-
peutic results, only a small percentage of patients show 
sustained responses, indicating the need for a more

comprehensive understanding of cancer immunity [69]. 
A recent study found an interleukin-4 fusion protein 
(Fc–IL-4), improves the anti-tumor efficacy of immune 
checkpoint blockade therapies and type 1 immunity-cen-
tric adoptive T cell transfer by directly acting on CD8 + T 
cells and enriching functional terminally exhausted 
CD8 + T (CD8 + TTE) cells in the tumor, mainly via mod-
ification of metabolism mediated by STAT6/mTOR [70].
Differences in inflammation and immune response lead 
to cancer disparities, including breast cancer, prostate 
cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and more. Can-
cer risk factors such as obesity, affect individuals with 
African American (AA) and Latina breast cancer more 
than those with European American (EA) breast can-
cer. It causes an inflammatory tumor microenvironment 
in breast tumors and the growth of pro-tumorigenic 
crown-like structures (CLSs), which comprise dead adi-
pocytes and activated macrophages [71]. Increased num-
bers of tumor-infiltrating macrophages were found in 
AA patients [72, 73]. Increased density of ­CD8+ T cells 
was found in AA women and AA women with invasive 
breast cancer [74]. Higher immune content score [75] 
and difference in the abundance of T-regulatory (Tregs) 
and T-helper type 2 cells [76] in AA patients compares 
with EA patients. Exhausted CD8 T-cells also predict the 
response to anti-PD1 therapy in ER-positive breast can-
cer women [77]. The immune content in breast tumors 
also relates to the survival of ER-negative breast cancer 
patients [78, 79]. Low-grade inflammation and associated 
immune cells promote prostate cancer progression [80]. 
Several immune cell types such as ­CD4+ T cells, natural 
killer cells (NK) cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor 
cells and elevated release of IL-6 and IL-8 were associ-
ated with worse prognosis of prostate cancer patients 
[81–85]. The increased expression of PD-L2 was linked 
to poorer distant metastasis-free survival and inferior 
radiotherapy outcomes either in isolation or in conjunc-
tion with radiation therapy, suggesting that it could be 
a therapeutic target of interest for prostate cancer [81]. 
Increased expression of inflammatory factors such as 
IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Tropomyosin 
receptor kinase B (TrkB), and higher immune content 
were found in AA men with prostate cancer [86]. Moreo-
ver, pre-clinical studies showed that immune cells such as 
Tregs, neutrophils, macrophages, and platelets promote 
prostate cancer metastasis [87–90]. In lung cancer, the 
circulating plasma levels of inflammation markers such 
as IL-6, IL-8, interferon gamma (IFNγ, IL-12/IL-23P40, 
and C-reactive protein are positively associated with lung 
cancer prognosis [91]. Elevated inflammatory mediators 
were also related to the risk of lung cancer [92]. IL-15, 
IL-6, and MCP-4 were identified as potential biomarkers 
for early-stage lung cancer [65]. AA CRC has a more 
immunosuppressive environment than EA CRC patients. 
AA CRC patients had lower densities of cells labeled with 
TFNg [91]. Fewer macrophages and CD8+ T-cells, but 
more B-cells were seen in AA tumors compared to EA 
colon cancer [93]. Therefore, studying how these differ-
ences in the immune environment influence tumor biol-
ogy and exploring the underlying mechanisms may help 
guide decisions on target therapy. The increased presence 
of immune-inflammation characteristics in the tumor 
helps to develop novel treatment therapeutics due to the 
reason that not every patient can afford the prohibitive 
expense of immunotherapy.
Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have 
significant potential, a variety of inflammatory tox-
icities known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs) 
have hindered their effectiveness [94]. ICIs are linked to 
inflammation and tissue damage in various organs [95, 
96]. Inflammation also contributes to resistance against 
ICIs in cases of high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) 
colorectal cancer [97]. The reports indicate that reducing 
inflammation may enhance the effectiveness of immu-
notherapy. A detailed single-cell analysis of immune cell 
populations in colitis has identified specific cytokines, 
chemokines, and surface receptors that could be targeted 
for therapy. These targets could be beneficial not only for 
colitis but also for addressing other inflammatory side 
effects associated with checkpoint blockade, including 
CXCR6 and CXCL16 [98]. ICIs and IL-6 antagonists may 
enhance the antitumoral effect while also reducing the 
risk of serious adverse events [99].
Potential metabolic therapeutic strategies for cancer 
prevention and treatment
Evidence showed that hypercholesterolemia causes cho-
lesterol to build up in immune cells such as macrophages, 
which in turn triggers inflammatory reactions. These 
reactions include increased TLR signaling, activation of 
inflammasomes, and the spleen and bone marrow gen-
eration of neutrophils and monocytes. Activation of 
TLR signaling causes a reduction in cholesterol efflux at 
the cellular level, which exacerbates inflammatory reac-
tions and causes further cholesterol buildup [100]. As a 
key factor that regulates the expression of multiple genes 
implicated in a wide range of lipid and glucose meta-
bolic pathways, peroxisome proliferator-activated recep-
tor alpha (PPARα) exhibits marked anti-inflammatory 
capacities [101, 102]. It plays an important role in various 
immune cells such as macrophages [103, 104].
As the relationship between metabolic reprogramming 
and immune cell activation in cancer becomes clearer, 
novel therapeutic targets are being identified through 
modifications to immune cells’ intracellular metabolism.

Xie et al. Molecular Cancer           (2025) 24:51 
Activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 is a vital factor 
that induces pro-inflammatory responses and contrib-
utes to metabolic syndrome (MetS) [105]. Therefore, 
TLRs could be promising targets for the treatment of 
inflammation-associated diseases as well as cancer.
Studies have shown that PPARα and PPARγ are closely 
related to carcinogenesis. On the one hand, loss of 
PPARα promotes the development of colon cancer [106]. 
Overexpression of PPARα suppressed HCC development 
[107]. PPARγ plays an anti-tumorigenic role in CRC 
[108]. On the other hand, PPARα facilitates cell prolif-
eration in prostate cancer [109]. PPARγ acts as an onco-
genic role in the development of thyroid carcinoma [110]. 
Several PPAR-interacting miRNAs, such as miR-506 
and miR-27a, have been shown to suppress PPARα and 
PPARγ in cancer cells [111, 112]. Besides, the upregula-
tion of PPARs or PPAR agonists has been reported to be 
involved in chemotherapy resistance by metabolic repro-
gramming. For example, up-regulated PPARs or PPARs 
agonists foster chemotherapy resistance in cisplatin-
resistant ovarian cancer [113], hepatocellular carcinoma 
[114], colorectal cancer [115], and NSCLC [116]. This 
suggests the potential of PPARs to act as a promising tar-
get for cancer treatment and prevention.
Potential antupohagic therapeutic strategies for cancer 
prevention and treatment
Dysregulation of autophagy contributes to inflammation 
and tumor progression. Enhancing autophagy can boost 
CTLA-4 expression and Tregs, potentially reducing 
inflammation and cancer [117]. Inhibiting the autophagy 
pathway encourages the transformation of macrophages 
into pro-inflammatory M1 cells, which worsens liver 
inflammation [118]. Research is focused on small mol-
ecules and nanomaterials that modulate autophagy 
for anti-tumor effects. For example, 3-Methyladenine 
(3-MA) blocks autophagy, reduces ROS, inactivates pro-
inflammatory proteins STAT3 and IL-6, and inhibits the 
survival of HeLa cells [119]. Combining the induction of 
autophagy by rapamycin with the activation of TLR4 and 
TLR9 has shown to have a synergistic effect in enhancing 
anticancer effectiveness.
Rapamycin, an autophagy activator, demonstrated 
enhanced anticancer effectiveness when combined with 
TLR4/9 agonists in melanoma treatment [120]. This 
indicates the potential of combining immunotherapy 
with autophagy activators for cancer treatment. Besides, 
GL-V9, an AMPK activator, prevents colorectal cancer 
associated with colitis by limiting the NLRP3, nucleotide-
binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) and pyrin 
domain-containing receptor (NLRP3) inflammasome 
through the process of autophagy [121]. Ergosterol per-
oxide induces ROS-dependent autophagy and reduces 
NLRP3 inflammasome activity, inhibiting lung can-
cer cell migration and proliferation. However, it is still 
unclear if autophagy directly suppresses inflammasome 
activity [122].
Inflammation regulates the hallmarks of cancer
New evidence has strengthened the idea that inflamma-
tion plays a crucial role in the development of tumors. 
Sites of infection, persistent irritation, and inflamma-
tion are the origin of many malignancies. It is becom-
ing evident that the tumor microenvironment, which is 
predominantly regulated by inflammatory cells, plays 
a crucial role in cancer development by promoting cell 
division, survival, and migration. It fosters the prolifera-
tion of mutant cells and facilitates the spread of malig-
nancy. The hallmarks of inflammation-induced cancer 
include proliferative and survival signaling promotion, 
genomic destabilization, angiogenesis promotion, inva-
sion, migration and metastasis induction, and reduced 
sensitivity of tumors to chemotherapy drugs.
Promoting proliferation and survival signaling
The concept that inflammation enhances cell prolifera-
tion has been proposed since 1863, and continuous cell 
proliferation increases the risk of tumor occurrence [1]. 
Various inflammatory molecules, as the main component 
of the tumor microenvironment, contribute to the prolif-
eration of cancer [123]. Chronic inflammation results in 
the continuous release of pro-inflammatory chemokines 
and cytokines such as interleukins (ILs) 6 and TNFα, as 
well as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), which 
promote the survival of tumor cells [124, 125]. Under 
the stimulation of inflammatory factors such as IL-6 
and IL-1β, NFκB and STAT3 were activated. Then, the 
expression of various oncogenic genes was dysregulated, 
promoting cancer cells’ survival and proliferation [126].
Destabilizing genome
As an enabling characteristic of cancer, genome insta-
bility is essential for cancer cell evolution [127, 128]. 
Accurate DNA synthesis and effective DNA repair pro-
cesses are crucial for maintaining genomic stabilization. 
Chronic inflammatory processes promote the develop-
ment of normal cells, their growth, and their transition 
to malignancy by disrupting cellular homeostasis, pro-
ducing various DNA damage products, impairing DNA 
repair pathways, producing an excess of pro-inflamma-
tory cytokines, and lowering the rates at which damaged 
cells undergo apoptosis [129, 130]. Abundant evidence 
indicates that inflammation contributes to genomic insta-
bility [131–133]. Inflammation generates reactive oxygen 
and nitrogen species (RONS) [132, 134, 135] and ROS 
[136] during the inflammatory response, which results

in direct DNA damage. The inflammation-associated 
DNA damage contributes to colon carcinogenesis in mice 
[137]. The DNA damage-induced sustained p53 activa-
tion contributes to inflammation-associated hepato-car-
cinogenesis in rats [138].
Promoting angiogenesis
Angiogenesis is recognized as the process of growth and 
remodeling that transforms an initial vascular system 
into the intricate branching network that characterizes 
adult vasculature [139]. Anastomosis, migration, sur-
vival, proliferation, and ECM breakdown are all part of 
this intricate multi-step process [140]. Abnormal vessel 
growth and function are hallmarks of cancer [141, 142]. 
Abundant evidence showed that in pathological circum-
stances such as cancer, angiogenesis, and inflamma-
tion are closely related [143]. Various pro-inflammatory 
chemokines and cytokines released during inflammation 
are potent activators for endothelial cells (ECs) to attract 
blood-derived inflammatory cells [144]. Adhesion mole-
cules play a vital role in this process, and they’re regulated 
by various pro-inflammatory mediators [145]. Alterna-
tively, angiogenesis maintains inflammation by providing 
oxygen and nutrients to meet the metabolic needs of cells 
at the site of inflammation. The tumor microenvironment 
is rich in inflammatory molecules such as TNFα, IL-1, 
IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and vascular endothelial growth fac-
tor (VEGF) [146, 147]. For example, as one of the best-
characterized inflammatory mediators in carcinogenesis, 
TNF α activates NF-κ B [148], which is involved in angio-
genesis [149]. VEGF production contributes to angio-
genesis, fostering tumor development [150, 151]. Since 
angiogenesis is essential for the formation and spread of 
tumors, there were substantial expectations that inhibit-
ing this process would have therapeutic benefits. To dem-
onstrate the utility of anti-angiogenic medicines, more 
than thirty years and multiple pre-clinical investigations 
employing a variety of anti-angiogenic strategies were 
required [152, 153]. As one of the most studied targets 
in clinical trials, VEGF shows significant biological func-
tions [154]. The first antiangiogenic agent anti-VEGF 
mAb, has been approved to treat metastasis colorectal 
cancer combined with chemotherapy [155]. Anti-inflam-
matory medications have also been demonstrated to have 
antiangiogenic properties, suggesting that their use may 
be advantageous for neoplastic therapy.
Inducing invasion, migration, and metastasis
Inflammatory cells and mediators participate in the 
invasion, migration, and metastasis of malignant cells. 
Many cells begin to produce chemokines when they are 
transforming. As a result, they can use chemokines to 
help migrate to and survive at locations distant from the 
original tumor [156–158]. For example, cell migration is 
influenced by the C-X-C chemokine receptor (CXCR) 4 
and its ligand (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL) 12 in both 
healthy and pathological conditions [158]. Malignant 
cells often express CXCR4 [156]. The degree of CXCR4 
expression in primary human malignancy is correlated 
with lymph node metastasis in colorectal, breast, liver, 
and esophageal cancer [159–161]. Besides, malignant 
cells from a variety of tissues also express other func-
tional chemokine receptors, such as CX3Chemokine 
receptor 1 (CX3CR1), CC-chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1), 
CCR7, CCR9, CCR10, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR5, 
and CXCR7. These receptors are implicated in organ-
specific metastasis [162–167]. For instance, the expres-
sion of CCR7 is correlated with lymph node metastasis, 
and CCR9 is correlated with melanoma metastasis to 
the small intestine. Many of the receptors are expressed 
by malignant melanoma cells, which could account for 
melanomas’ high rate of metastasis. Several mecha-
nisms may help malignant cells acquire the ability to 
express chemokine receptors, including genetic and epi-
genetic alterations, and autocrine and paracrine extra-
cellular signals. The inflammatory cytokines such as 
TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, can enhance the invasive abil-
ity of tumor cells in ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and 
others [168–170]. Higher levels of the cytokine IL-6 are 
associated with increased risk of distant recurrence of 
HER2-negative early breast cancer [171]. TGF-β pro-
motes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [172, 
173] and metastasis [174–178] at a late stage of cancer. 
Inflammatory macrophages contribute to ovarian cancer 
cell migration in  vitro [179] and ovarian cancer model 
[180]. Macrophage-deficient mice could develop tumors 
but can’t form pulmonary metastasis in a breast cancer 
model [181]. In conclusion, malignant cells and invading 
leukocytes interact with autocrine and paracrine by coor-
dinating chemokines and cytokines. Due to these interac-
tions, malignant cells are more likely to migrate, invade, 
and survive.
Reducing the sensitivity of tumors to chemotherapeutic 
drugs, radiotherapy and immunotherapy
Chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy are 
common treatment options utilized for various cancer 
types. One of the side effects of chemotherapy is pro-
ducing inflammatory cytokines related to the side effects 
and drug resistance. Similarly, radiation-induced DNA 
damage response (DDR) also promotes the release of 
cytokines and chemokines, which will cause the invasion 
and metastasis of cancer by triggering the inflammatory 
process and suppressing the immune function [182, 183]. 
Resistance has been the significant barrier to effective 
cancer treatment [184–187]. Inflammatory mediators 
Page 8 of 96
Xie et al. Molecular Cancer           (2025) 24:51 
such as GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-5, IL-10, and tumor 
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) play crucial roles in the 
resistance associated with inflammation. For instance, 
CD4 + T helper 2 (TH2) cells, which are key regulators of 
inflammatory processes in cancer, can accelerate pulmo-
nary metastasis and promote chemotherapy resistance 
through the activation of macrophages by IL-4 in breast 
cancer [188]. Activated downstream of IL-13, the sig-
nal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) 
enhances anti-apoptotic pathways, potentially leading to 
resistance against cytotoxic CD8 + T cells and chemo-
therapy in breast cancer [189, 190]. NF-κB upregulates 
the Wnt family member Wnt16B, which attenuates the 
effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy in prostate cancer 
[191]. NF-κB can also be activated by chemotherapy 
drugs such as paclitaxel, cisplatin, doxorubicin, and 
bleomycin [192]. Therefore, inhibition of the inflamma-
tory cytokines pathway and related molecules seems to 
be an up-and-coming method to improve chemotherapy 
efficacy. Phytochemicals such as resveratrol, curcumin, 
genistein, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), lycopene, 
thymoquinone, quercetin, capsaicin, and other phyto-
chemicals, that inhibit the NF-κB pathway have a pre-
ventive effect on drug resistance [193–196]. For example, 
resveratrol enhances doxorubicin-induced cytotoxic-
ity in chemo-resistant B16 melanoma [197]. Curcumin 
can sensitize tumors to many chemotherapeutic drugs 
in various types of cancer, such as colon, breast, liver, 
lung, ovarian cancer, and others; curcumin also sensitizes 
tumors to gamma radiation in multiple types of cancer, 
such as colon cancer, cervical carcinoma, glioma, neu-
roblastoma, epidermal carcinoma, prostate cancer, and 
others [198, 199].
Radiation kills cancer cells via various mechanisms, 
while the dying cells promote the release of several 
cytokines, such as TGF-β [200]. TGF-β closely relates 
to radio-resistance by suppressing the immune system 
and regulating angiogenesis, invasion, and DNA dam-
age [201, 202]. Inhibition of TGF-βRI can reverse the 
radio-resistance of irradiated cells [203]. In some clini-
cal trials, TGF-β antagonists such as fresolimumab and 
LY2157299, have been applied to cancer patients under-
going radiotherapy and have obtained some promising 
results [201]. For example, TGF-β blocking antibody 
fresolimumab increases the overall survival of meta-
static breast cancer patients [204]. These suggest that 
anti-TGF-β medications and radiation therapy together 
may improve tumor response and minimize side effects. 
Additionally, LIF mRNA, which is expressed in immune 
cells such as T-cells, macrophages, and monocytes, as 
well as in epithelial carcinoma cells and adjacent stromal 
cells, promotes radio-resistance in nasopharyngeal carci-
noma by activating the mTORC1/p70S6K pathway [205]. 
The blockade of LIF altered macrophages, slowed tumor 
progression, and improved the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 
therapies in colon cancer [206].
EMT is an important step during resistance [207], IL-6 
cytokines can promote EMT by activating transcription 
factors such as STAT3 and Snail. This suggests that block-
ing IL-6 family cytokines may enhance the effectiveness 
of immunotherapy. Drugs that target IL-6 cytokines have 
been shown to improve the efficacy of immune check-
point blockade (ICB) and reduce irAEs. Several clinical 
trials are currently underway to evaluate the combina-
tion of anti-IL-6 therapies with immunotherapy in cancer 
treatment [208]. In animal models of cancer, the upregu-
lation of CD38 is associated with acquired resistance to 
anti-PD-L1 treatment. CD38 decreases the activity of 
CD8 T cells and reduces the effectiveness of anti-PD-L1 
immunotherapy by contributing to the accumulation of 
adenosine in tumors [209]. Blocking CD38 made tumors 
more susceptible to anti-PD-L1 therapy. Moreover, inhib-
iting CD39’s enzymatic activity leads to the depletion 
of intra-tumoral macrophages, modifies the inflamma-
tory response, boosts T cell proliferation, and overcomes 
anti-PD-1 resistance in colon cancer [210]. Inhibition of 
A2A adenosine receptor increases the efficacy of anti-
PD-1 and produces T cell-dependent anti-tumor activ-
ity in breast and colon cancers [211]. Inhibition of the 
CD39-CD73-adenosine axis appears to be a promising 
strategy for overcoming resistance to immunotherapy.
The relationship between inflammatory diseases 
and cancer
Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are two 
types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that involve 
chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. 
Patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are at 
a higher risk of being diagnosed with cancer compared 
to the general population [212], such as colorectal cancer 
[213], small-bowel cancer [214], colon cancer [215], and 
also the skin cancers, lymphomas and cervical abnor-
malities [216]. CD also increases the incidence of anal 
cancer and anorectal cancer [217]. The risk of cancer may 
depend on the severity and duration of inflammation. 
Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, generated dur-
ing gut inflammation, play a crucial role in cancer devel-
opment by activating intracellular transcription factors 
like STAT3 and NF-κB [218]. Anti-tumor necrosis factor 
therapy at an intensified dose is the most effective medi-
cal treatment for perianal Crohn’s disease, as it can lower 
the risk of anal tumors [219].Current data indicates that 
immunosuppression for IBD does not increase the risk 
of new or recurrent malignancies [220]. The blockade 
of IL-23 using neutralizing antibodies, which has been 
tested in clinical trials for Crohn’s disease therapy, is 
Page 9 of 96

anticipated to be an effective method for treating colon 
cancer and colorectal cancer. This expectation is based 
on the regulatory role of IL-23 in carcinogenesis [215].
Aside from IBD, autoimmune diseases like rheuma-
toid arthritis (RA) and celiac disease are notable. Patients 
with RA have an increased risk of developing prostate 
cancer [221], lung cancer [222], nonmelanoma skin can-
cer (NMSC) [223], and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [224]. 
Additionally, RA increases the risk of lymphoid, myeloid, 
cervical, and oropharyngeal cancers, while decreasing the 
risk of endometrial and colorectal cancers, according to a 
study of one million women [225]. Long-term immuno-
logical dysregulation, such as altered B cell activation and 
survival, along with the inflammatory reactions associ-
ated with RA development, may further increase the risk 
of developing cancer [226, 227]. Antagonists of TNF-α, 
Janus kinase (JAK), and IL-6 are commonly used thera-
peutics for RA, but their effects on tumor development 
are mixed. For instance, while TNF inhibitors have been 
found to increase the risk of NMSC in patients with RA, 
they can also reduce tumor size and metastasis in cases 
of colorectal and colon cancer [228, 229]. JAK inhibitors 
didn’t increase the risk of cancer [230, 231]. Celiac dis-
ease is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the 
small intestine and is triggered by gluten consumption 
in genetically predisposed individuals [232]. The devel-
opment of coeliac disease involves a complex immune 
response to gluten proteins. Celiac disease also increases 
the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma [233], small bowel 
carcinoma [234]. Additionally, it raises the mortality rate 
among cancer patients [235].
The gluten-free diet is the primary treatment for coe-
liac disease. It helps reduce damage to the small intesti-
nal mucosa caused by repeated gluten ingestion, thus 
lowering the risk of lymphoproliferative malignancies 
[236]. Nutritional support, pharmacological agents, 
and autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplanta-
tion are also recommended for non-responsive type 2 
cases [237]. Additionally, utilizing new techniques such 
as gene silencing (e.g., RNA interference) or gene edit-
ing (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9) to reduce immunogenic gluten 
proteins could enhance the quality of life for individuals 
on a gluten-free diet [238]. A pilot study indicated that a 
low-gluten RNA interference wheat line did not provoke 
an immune response after a short-term oral challenge in 
patients with treated coeliac disease [239]. These meth-
ods may also offer innovative approaches for the primary 
prevention of celiac disease.
The role of inflammation in certain types of cancer
Several types of tumors are directly related to inflam-
mation. For example, the development of colitis and 
colitis-associated tumors is closely related to chronic 
inflammation [240]. There are several pathogens that play 
an important role in inflammation-related tumors such 
as cervical cancer, gastric cancer, and liver cancer. For 
example, human papillomavirus (HPV) is a major risk 
factor for the development of cervical cancer, as its pro-
teins are involved, either directly or indirectly, in inflam-
mation that can lead to the onset of this disease [241]. 
Immune cell infiltration and the increased secretion of 
inflammatory cytokines are two primary factors in the 
development of cervical cancer [242].
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is classified as a Group 
I carcinogen and infects over half of the world’s popu-
lation. It has unique properties that allow it to colonize 
the gastric epithelium in acidic environments. Infec-
tions caused by H. pylori can lead to chronic gastritis, 
which may progress to severe gastrointestinal conditions, 
including gastric cancer [243]. Understanding the com-
plex bacterial virulence mechanisms and their interac-
tions with the host immune system and environmental 
factors is crucial for comprehending the pathophysiology 
of H. pylori infection.
In China, the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the primary 
cause of liver cancer [244]. While liver cancer is primar-
ily caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in South 
Korea and Japan [245]. Chronic infections of HBV or 
HCV, along with factors such as nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD) and excessive alcohol consumption, 
lead to liver injury, chronic inflammation, and ultimately 
liver cancer [246]. The transformation of inflamma-
tory tumors in the liver is a gradual and dynamic pro-
cess [247]. The chronic inflammation leads to an altered 
immune environment, increased secretion of inflam-
matory factors, and dysfunctional NK cells, ultimately 
resulting in liver cancer [248].
The role of patient‑specific factors in inflammation‑related 
cancer
Various patient-specific factors, such as the microbi-
ome and genetics, play crucial roles in cancer related to 
inflammation.
The role of microbiome in inflammation‑related cancer
The microbiome can influence key characteristics of 
cancer, including the promotion of harmful local inflam-
mation that contributes to the development of tumors. 
For instance, Helicobacter pylori colonizes the human 
gastric mucosa, leading to chronic inflammation and 
resulting in gastric ulcers, which can eventually pro-
gress to stomach cancer [243]. Research has shown that 
Fusobacterium nucleatum in colorectal cancer activates 
NF-κB, an important modulator of inflammation associ-
ated with cancer, through its binding to Toll-like recep-
tors and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like 
Page 10 of 96

receptors [249]. Moreover, the carcinogenic potential of 
gut bacteria results in increased production of IL-6 and 
TNF, activation of STAT3, and activation of the IL-17–
IL-23 pathway [250]. Innate and adaptive host immune 
responses triggered by microbiota can collaborate to 
promote the development and spread of malignancies by 
inducing inflammation that supports cancer growth and 
increases resistance to cell death.
The composition of microbiota can significantly influ-
ence the effectiveness and side effects of cancer treat-
ments, as well as the quality of life after cancer therapy 
[251]. For example, there is a significant difference in 
the microbiome composition between responder and 
non-responder patients undergoing anti-PD-1 immuno-
therapy [252, 253]. The altered gut microbiome due to 
antibiotics reduced the effectiveness of ICIs in advanced 
cancer patients [254]. Moreover, the effectiveness of 
chemotherapeutic drugs can also be influenced by bac-
teria, affecting their metabolism and absorption [255]. 
Probiotics and microbiota transplants may be effective 
strategies for modifying the microbiome, potentially 
enhancing cancer therapy responses and improving qual-
ity of life. For instance, oral supplementation with A. 
muciniphila or Bifidobacterium can boost the effective-
ness of PD-1 or PD-L1 immunotherapy in mouse mod-
els of melanoma and lung cancer [254, 256]. Importantly, 
certain probiotic strains, prebiotics like inulin and fructo-
oligosaccharides, and synbiotics can reduce gastrointes-
tinal side effects in cervical cancer patients. They do this 
by altering key metabolic pathways and inflammation, 
lowering oncogene activity, and ultimately reducing can-
cer progression [257]. Microbiome-regulating agents are 
relatively safe, making them potential adjuvants in clini-
cal cancer treatment and paving the way for personalized 
therapies. However, more high-quality clinical trials are 
urgently needed.
The role of genetics in inflammation‑related cancer
Cancer was once thought to be solely hereditary, but it 
is now understood to be influenced by a combination 
of dysregulated genetic and epigenetic pathways [258]. 
Genetic alterations are essential for cancer development 
and the creation of an inflammatory microenvironment, 
linking inflammation and cancer through an intrinsic 
pathway [259]. Genetic alterations, including oncogene 
activation through mutations, chromosomal rearrange-
ments, or amplifications, as well as inactivation of tumor-
suppressor genes, contribute significantly to cancer 
development. Among the most frequently mutated domi-
nant oncogenes in human cancer are myelocytoma-
tosis oncogene (MYC) and rats arcomaviral oncogene 
homolog (RAS), which induce tumor-promoting inflam-
matory mediators that play critical roles in tumor growth 
and angiogenesis [260, 261]. The Kirsten rats arcoma-
viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)-G12D mutation pro-
motes immunosuppression and increases resistance 
to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) [262]. MYC promotes resistance 
to immunotherapy and IFNγ by downregulating JAK2 
[263]. Targeting dysregulated MYC or RAS may enhance 
immunotherapy effects, as several studies have demon-
strated. For instance, inhibiting MYC increased tumor 
immune cell infiltration and made tumors more respon-
sive to anti-PD1 immunotherapy [264]. OmoMYC, a 
peptide and mini-protein that inhibits MYC, is cur-
rently being developed for evaluation in clinical trials for 
relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia [265]. Cur-
rently, several inhibitors targeting RAS and MYC muta-
tions are in clinical use or undergoing clinical trials. This 
offers a promising strategy to enhance anti-tumor effects 
and overcome the drug resistance of immunotherapy. 
Additionally, tumor-suppressor proteins like von Hippel-
Lindau (VHL) and PTEN can regulate the production 
of inflammatory mediators [266, 267].PTEN treatment 
improves anti-PD-1 efficacy in mice and reverses the 
immune-suppressive phenotype of primary tumor-asso-
ciated macrophages derived from patients [268]. Admin-
istering PTEN externally may serve as a promising cancer 
immunotherapy strategy.
Targeting inflammatory pathway for cancer 
chemoprevention
A growing tumor’s inflammatory component may involve 
various leukocyte types, such as neutrophils, dendritic 
cells, macrophages, eosinophils, mast cells, and lympho-
cytes. These leukocyte types can produce a wide range 
of cytokines, as well as cytotoxic mediators like reactive 
oxygen species, serine and cysteine proteases, MMPs, 
and membrane-perforating agents, as well as soluble 
mediators of cell death like TNF-α, interleukins, and 
IFNs [269]. The detailed information about the inflam-
matory cells and molecules they secret are summarized 
and shown in Fig. 1. And the pro- or anti-tumor effect of 
these inflammatory molecules are also summarized and 
shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. TNFα antibodies or inhibitors 
such as infliximab are undergoing phase 2 clinical trials 
in breast and renal cell cancer [270]. Chemokine receptor 
antagonists like bicyclam plerixafor are now in clinical 
use in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma 
[271]. Trabedtedin as the cytotoxic drug to tumor-asso-
ciated macrophages and circulating monocytes, has been 
used to treat soft-tissue sarcoma and ovarian cancer 
[272]. Fibroblast plays an important role in tumor devel-
opment, and inhibitors of the fibroblast growth factor 
receptor have been studied in various tumors [273].

Targeting interleukins for cancer chemoprevention
As the means of communication for immune cells and 
non-immune cells, interleukins play important roles 
in the occurrence and development of tumors. Their 
importance as a target and therapeutic agent is demon-
strated by the growing number of clinical trials that are 
presently ongoing. While the results of clinical trials are 
not satisfactory. Interleukin-6 monoclonal antibodies 
have been studied in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in ovar-
ian and renal cancer [274]. Anti-interleukin-6 receptor 
antibody-like tocilizumab successfully treats cachexia in 
lung cancer patients [275]. Treated with IL1R antago-
nists enhances the antitumor effect of gemcitabine and 
5-fluorouracil [276]. More details regarding the function 
of interleukins and underlying mechanisms in cancer are 
provided in Table 1.
Activating interferons for cancer chemoprevention
As the most effective and widely distributed family of 
cytokines, IFNs are induced by nucleic acids and related 
to immunity and vascular. IFNs are composed of type I, 
II, and III IFNs. Type I IFNs include IFN-α, β, ε, κ, and ω; 
type II IFNs refer to IFNγ; type III IFNs include IFNγ1, 
FNγ2, FNγ3 (first called IL-28A, IL-28B, and IL-29) 
[277]. After stimulation, they are produced and secreted 
by body cells, such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, 
macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells [278]. All 
IFNs activate the transcription of interferon-stimulated 
genes through the Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT pathway. 
Generally, JAK1 and JAK2 are activated by type II IFN 
signaling to cause STAT1 homodimerization, whereas 
TYK2 and JAK1 are activated by type I and III IFN signal-
ing to cause STAT1-2 heterodimerization and IFN-stim-
ulated gene (ISG) factor 3 (ISGF3) creation [277]. IFNα 
and IFNβ, which belong to type I interferons, directly 
control the transcription of over 100 downstream genes, 
resulting in direct (on cancer cells) and indirect (through 
immune effector cells and vasculature) effects on tumors 
[278]. Drug development and patient assessment of 
interferon-directed therapies have benefited from new 
understandings of the endogenous and external activa-
tion of type I interferons in the tumor and its microen-
vironment. Modulation of the interferon system may 
further reduce cancer morbidity and death when paired 
with other efficacious cancer treatment methods or with 
previous observations. Clinical trials were started by the 
Finnish National Red Cross and Hans Strander and Kari 
Cantell using partially purified IFNα, which was made 
from human blood donor leukocytes in Cantell’s Hel-
sinki laboratory [279]. Abundant evidence indicated the 
anti-tumor effects of leukocyte-derived INFα on various 
metastasis solid tumors and hematological malignancies 
[280]. Recombinant INFα2 was the first human immuno-
therapeutic approved by the FDA for cancer [281].
However, exogenous INFα2 and IFNβ also lead to sys-
temic adverse effects. The discovery of the molecular and 
cellular aspects of pathways of induction and action of 
interferon, such as effects of protein products of inter-
feron-stimulated genes (ISGs), cellular actions of inter-
ferons, and endogenous nucleic acid-induced pathways, 
which may provide new opportunities for enhancing 
the anti-tumor effect of these cytokines. For example, it 
has been suggested that RNA is a more powerful tran-
scription inducer of interferons regarding RIG-I (reti-
noic acid-inducible gene I) or Toll-like receptors (TLR3, 
TLR7, and TLR8). A TLR3 agonist ARNAX facilitates 
the effect of immunotherapy on patients [282]. TLR 3 
and 7 agonists induce a hot triple-negative breast can-
cer immune environment [283]. TLR7/8-agonist-loaded 
nanoparticles promote the polarization of tumor-asso-
ciated macrophages to enhance cancer immunotherapy 
[284]. Besides, cytoplasmic protein cyclic  guanosine 
monophosphate 
(GMP)-adenosine 
monophosphate 
(AMP) (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) binds to DNA and ini-
tiates the synthesis of cGAMP, activating the stimulator 
of interferon genes (STING), then activates the endog-
enous interferon system [279], which provides a fresh 
understanding of how immune effector cells’ endogenous 
interferon system is activated. And the cGAS-STING 
pathway plays a fundamental and vital function in iden-
tifying immunogenic cancer cells. When the intracellular 
STING protein is activated, various immunostimulatory 
molecules are produced, which can lead to the matura-
tion of dendritic cells, the polarization of anti-tumor 
macrophages, the priming and activation of T cells, the 
activation of natural killer cells, vascular reprogramming,

and/or the death of cancer cells. These processes can 
result in the immune system eliminating tumors and 
producing anti-tumor immune memory [285]. STING 
inhibits the reactivation of dormant metastasis in lung 
adenocarcinoma [286]. STING agonist promotes CAR 
T cell trafficking and persistence in breast cancer [287]. 
cGAS-STING-mediated type I interferon signaling 
enhances the development of stem cell-like CD8 + T 
cells by inhibiting Akt activity [288]. The combination of 
STING agonists with radiotherapy or chemotherapy can 
enhance the antitumor effect and reduce the side effects 
caused by conventional treatments [289, 290]. Moreover, 
co-administering STING agonists with CTLA4 and PD1 
antibodies demonstrated a significant survival advantage 
in a preclinical model of HPV + oral tumors [291]. The 
combination of the STING agonist DMAXX and CAR T 
cell therapy significantly increases the number of CAR T 
cells [287]. Recent studies have improved our understand-
ing of the cGAS/STING pathway in cancer treatment, 
but prolonged STING activation can promote carcino-
genesis. Analysis of the TCGA database shows that sev-
eral cGAS-encoding genes are significantly upregulated 
in malignant tissues compared to normal controls, indi-
cating that cGAS/STING signaling may be active in these 
cancers [292]. Current research indicates that STING 
can increase the expression of the immune checkpoint 
indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which may directly 
or indirectly reduce T-cell function and numbers, thereby 
promoting immunological escape [293]. The enzyme 
cGAS, found in mitochondria, suppresses ferroptosis and 
promotes the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma 
[294]. These reports suggest that cGAS may be a poten-
tial target for cancer interventions. The inhibitory effects 
of astin C, a novel STING-specific inhibitor, on Trex1/
BMDMs highlight the potential of astin C for cancer 
treatment [295]. Further research is necessary to evaluate 
the effectiveness of cGAS-STING pathway inhibition in 
cancer treatment.
The role of IFNs in cancer is complex, based on the 
time, cells present, total IFN-I signal levels, and the 
IFNα/β sub-types mediating the effects, frequently pro-
ducing different results. Additionally, it’s becoming evi-
dent that the timing of IFN-I delivery or blockade can 
have radically different outcomes, illuminating the com-
plex biology at play. More details regarding the function 
of TLRs and STING and the role of their agonists in can-
cer are provided in Table 2 and Table 3 respectively.
Targeting TNFs for cancer chemoprevention
In the late 1970s, macrophages were discovered to cre-
ate a cytokine called TNF, also known as TNFα, which 
can inhibit tumor cell growth and cause tumor regres-
sion [296]. Lymphotoxin, derived from lymphocytes, has 
a 50% homologous amino acid sequence and binds to 
the same receptor with TNFα, it came to be called TNFβ 
[297]. The TNF superfamily, composed of 19 ligands and 
29 receptors, participates in multiple biological func-
tions. Since their role in inflammation, apoptosis, pro-
liferation, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, immune, 
and others, TNF superfamily members were promising 
targets for drug development. Numerous investigations 
showed TNF superfamily members to be a kind of strong 
inflammatory cytokines that both stimulate complicated 
immune responses and have anti-tumor properties. TNF 
superfamily actions can be both advantageous and dan-
gerous. On the one hand, TNF acts as the major media-
tor of cancer-related inflammation, and many antagonists 
against the TNF family and their receptors have been 
approved by the FDA, and some of these are already 
undergoing clinical testing. For example, anti-TNF treat-
ment (infliximab) enhanced the effects of chemotherapy 
in colon cancer treatment [298]. On the other hand, 
TNF can cause cancer cell death, which makes it a pos-
sible cancer therapy. As the first cytokine to be employed 
for cancer treatment, TNFα has been used in the clinic 
for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma [35] and mela-
noma [36]. However, reducing TNF’s toxicity is a major 
task before TNF can be administered consistently. The 
advancement of TNF-α therapy in the future will depend 
on reducing systemic therapy’s toxicity and raising 
TNF-α dosages to increase the direct tumor response. On 
the other hand, through indirect tumor effects, the use of 
innovative modes of action may improve safety and effi-
cacy. More details regarding the function of interleukins 
in cancer are provided in Table 4.

radiation efficacy, suppressing migration and malignant progression of tumor, inhibiting angiogenesis, lymph angiogenesis and stemness, 
promoting synergistic apoptosis and enhancing drug sensitivity are summarized. B Inflammatory molecules which contributes to inhibiting 
inflammation, promoting immunity and tumor cell lysis, preventing immune escape, reducing epithelial-messenchymal transition and promoting 
cancer cell apoptosis. C Inflammatory molecules which participates in restraining movement, suppressing occurrence, driving cell senescence, 
inhibiting adhesion and driving non-apoptotic cellular death. D Inflammatory molecules which contribute to suppressing invasion, inhibiting 
metastasis, restraining growth and inhibiting proliferation

also known as CSF1), and granulocyte colony-stimu-
lating factor (G-CSF; also known as CSF3). As the main 
regulators of granulocyte and macrophage popula-
tions, CSF can mobilize stem cells to peripheral blood 
in sufficient quantities for transplantation, speed up the 
regeneration of protective white blood cells damaged by 
chemotherapy, boost anticancer immune responses, and 
possibly contribute to the development of myeloid leu-
kemias [299]. More details regarding the function of col-
ony-stimulating factors in cancer are provided in Table 5.
Targeting chemokines for cancer chemoprevention
Chemokines are 8–12 kDa proteins that are released 
and bind to Gai-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane-
spanning receptors (GPCRs), also known as classical 
chemokine receptors, to control directed cell movement 
(chemotaxis), adhesion, cell orientation, and cell–cell 
interactions [300]. Comprising around 50 chemokine 
ligands, 20 signaling GPCRs, and 4 ACKRs, the 
chemokine system is crucial for various pathological pro-
cesses. Cancer cells, tissue-resident cells, and recruited 
immune cells that express a wide variety of chemokine 
ligands and chemokine receptors all influence the process 
of carcinogenesis. Chemokines govern the invasiveness, 
proliferation, and stem-like characteristics of tumor cells. 
They also influence neoangiogenesis, neurogenesis, and 
fibrogenesis in stem cells [301]. Chemokines play a cru-
cial role in guiding immune cell movement when mount-
ing and subsequently delivering an efficient anti-tumor 
immune response [300]. Meanwhile, chemokine systems 
also contribute to pro-tumorigenic immune responses 
by controlling immune cells’ location and cellular inter-
actions in lymphoid organs and the tumor microen-
vironment (TME). Chemokines have been attractive 
therapeutic targets because of their role in mediating 
the recruitment of anti-tumorigenic immune cells and

supporting their activity within TME. Similarly, inhib-
iting chemokines that draw in and support immune 
cells’ suppressive roles is an intriguing avenue for future 
research to enhance treatment outcomes. Addition-
ally, another therapeutic approach being investigated to 
enhance responses to cancer therapy is the activation or 
transduction of chemokine receptors on adoptively trans-
ferred anti-tumor T cells, which facilitates their ability to 
enter deeply into the tumor and license their functioning. 
Significant advancements in our comprehension of the 
immune system’s function during carcinogenesis have 
resulted in the creation of innovative immunotherapeutic 
methods for treating diverse tumors, which have substan-
tially aided cancer patients. Immunotherapy continues to 
be one of the most promising medical advancements of 
the twenty-first century. More details regarding the func-
tion of chemokines in cancer are provided in Table 6.
Targeting inflammasomes for cancer chemoprevention
As the innate immune system receptors and sensors, 
inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes, which 
react to recognized indicators of endogenous (linked 
to cellular damage, ATP, ROS, and DNA) and external 
(related to infections) stimuli [302]. Inflammasome 
components include the NACHT, leucine-rich repeat 
(LRR), and pyrin domain (PYD) domain-containing 
protein 1 (NLRP1), nucleotide-binding domain leucine-
rich repeat (NLR) and pyrin domain-containing recep-
tor (NLRP3)( (also known as cryopyrin), NLR family 
caspase activation and recruitment domain-containing 
protein 4 (NLRC4), NOD-like receptor family pyrin 
domain containing 6 (NLRP6), and absent in melanoma 
2 (AIM2). Detailed information on the structure of 
NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP4, NLRP6, and AIM2 are shown 
in Fig. 4. Their products like interleukin 1β and inter-
leukin 18, along with the adaptor, apoptosis-associated

speck-like protein containing caspase activation and 
recruitment domain (ASC) and the effector caspase-1 
both play a major role in carcinogenesis [303]. The 
sensor protein on each type of inflammasome deter-
mines whether a form of the inflammasome is present 
by identifying pathogenic ligands and triggering the 
assembly of inflammasomes. NLRs convert the bio-
logically inactive pro-IL-1beta and pro-IL-18 into their 
active forms through caspase-1 [304]. Genetic muta-
tions in NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, and AIM2 are linked 
with the development of auto-inflammatory diseases, 
enterocolitis, and cancer [305]. It is commonly known 
that inflammatory proteins and their byproducts have 
a role in developing several cancers, such as skin cancer 
[306], lung cancer [307], and others. Inflammasomes 
play both protective and detrimental roles in cancer. 
On one hand, mice that lack NLRP3, ASC, or caspase-1 
exhibit increased susceptibility to colitis and to colitis-
associated colorectal cancer induced by the chemical 
colitogen dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) [308, 309]. Infu-
sion of recombinant IL-18 reduces tumor frequency in 
mice deficient in inflammatory components following 
azoxymethane (AOM) and DSS treatment [308]. IL-18 
plays a role in repairing the epithelial barrier and pre-
venting damage [309]. This may clarify the protective 
roles of NLRP3 and IL-18 in relation to colitis-associ-
ated colorectal cancer. Mice that lack IL-18 are more 
vulnerable to developing lung metastasis [310]. Mice 
that were injected daily with recombinant IL-18 for five 
days exhibited fewer lung metastases [311]. Other NLR 
sensors, such as NLRP6 and NLRP1b, have also shown 
protective effects against tumorigenesis. For instance, 
the NLRP1b inflammasome mediates the secretion of 
IL-1β and IL-18 in stromal colon cells, providing pro-
tection against colon tumorigenesis [312]. NLRP6 
protects against chemical-induced colon cancer by 
activating caspase-1 and promoting IL-18 production 
in the intestine [313]. The blockade of ASC promotes 
the growth of melanoma tumors [314]. On the other 
hand, In some cases, the activation of the inflamma-
some can suppress antitumor immunity. For instance, 
when B16-F10 melanoma cells or RM-1 prostate can-
cer cells are delivered intravenously (as opposed to 
subcutaneously) into mice, the activation of NLRP3 is 
associated with increased lung metastasis. The harm-
ful impact of NLRP3 in melanoma may stem from its 
inhibitory effect on the activation of NK cells, which 
are responsible for secreting IFNγ and killing tumor 
cells.In some cases, inflammasome activation can sup-
press antitumor immunity. For example, when B16-F10 
melanoma or RM-1 prostate cancer cells are delivered 
intravenously into mice, NLRP3 activation is linked to 
increased lung metastasis. This detrimental effect may 
be due to NLRP3’s inhibition of NK cell activation, 
which is crucial for secreting IFNγ and killing tumor 
cells [310]. Recombinant IL-18 increases lung metas-
tasis when injected into mice twice a week [311]. The 
knockdown of the gene encoding ASC suppresses the 
growth of melanoma xenograft tumors [314]. The types 
of cells, tissues, and organs involved in an inflammas-
ome significantly influence its characteristics related to 
tumor promotion and suppression. The biological link 
between inflammasomes and cancer offers promising 
opportunities for exploring novel anticancer therapies.
Besides, other studies also point to the tumor-suppres-
sive function of inflammasomes like NLRP3, NLRP1, 
NLRP6, and Pyrin in the initiation and spread of some 
malignancies, including colorectal cancer [315]. Recently, 
some inhibitors and agonists of these inflammasomes 
exhibit anti-tumor effects. For example, the small mol-
ecule OLT1177 suppressed tumor growth by inhibiting 
NLRP3 [316]. OLT1177 and another NLRP3 inhibitor 
MCC950 reduced tumor growth in melanoma [317, 318]. 
Nigericin controls tumor growth by activating NLRP3 in 
breast cancer and neuroblastoma [319]. Since the multi-
faceted role of inflammasomes in carcinogenesis, clari-
fying the mechanism of action in different tumors will 
provide novel therapeutic approaches for cancer treat-
ment and prevention. Here, we will summarize the pro-
moting and suppressive effects of these inflammasomes 
and their inhibitors and agonists in cancer initiation and 
development. A comprehensive list of the role of these 
inflammasomes in cancer is also shown in Table 7.
The role of NLRP1 in inflammation‑mediated carcinogenesis
The receptor NLRP1, the adaptor protein ASC, and the 
effector protein caspase-1 make up the multi-protein 
complex known as the NLRP1 inflammasome. NLRP1 is 
the first identified and currently recognized predominant 
inflammasome sensor protein in human keratinocytes, 
NLRP1 has its unique domain, which contains an effec-
tor C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD), 
PYD, a central NBD, an LRP and a function to find 
domain (FIIND). In the absence of external stimuli, the 
NBD binds to LRR, inhibiting self-oligomerization and 
bringing the protein into an inactive state. When cells 
are exposed to external stimuli, such as viruses, UVB 
rays, and ribotoxic stress reactions, they bind to the LRR 
domain, then induce a conformational change in NLRP1 
and expose PYD and CARD domains. The downstream 
proteins which containing PYD and CARD are then 
mediated, such as the homologous interaction between 
ASC and caspase-1. Dipeptidyl protease (DPP), anthrax 
lethal toxin (LT), and parasites can activate NLRP1 [320].
Database analysis indicates that NLRP1 has a distinct 
expression pattern across various tumors, and patients

with high NLRP1 expression generally have a better 
prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and pancre-
atic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) [321]. The activation of the 
NLRP1 sensor protects against colitis-associated CRC 
through mechanisms dependent on effector cytokines 
[315]. NLRP1 is also positively correlated with an 
increased risk of prostate cancer [322]. The dysfunctions 
in the NLRP1 pathway are also linked to skin cancers, 
including melanoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and squamous cell 
carcinoma [323]. Increased expression of NLRP1 was sig-
nificantly associated with immune cell infiltration in gas-
tric cancer [324]. An endogenous thioredoxin (TRX) has 
been identified as a binder to NLRP1 and inhibits NLRP1 
inflammasome activation. This opens opportunities for 
therapeutic intervention in NLRP1 inflammasome acti-
vation in the future.
The role of NLRP3 in inflammation‑mediated carcinogenesis
The NLRP3 inflammasome is widely present in immune 
cells. As the most thoroughly studied inflammasome, 
NLRP3 inflammasome includes the sensor NLRP3, the 
adaptor ASC, and the effector caspase-1. NLRP3 consists 
of three domains, a central nucleotide-binding domain 
(NBD), a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR), and an 
N-terminal PYD. ROS production, ionic flux, mitochon-
drial dysfunction, and lysosomal damage are the four 
Fig. 4  Nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat containing receptors (NLRs) upon activation form a multiprotein complex known 
as the “inflammasome”. The inflammasome complex consists of an NLR protein, the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) (an adaptor 
protein) and a caspase. The detailed information on the structure of NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP4, NLRP6, and AIM2 inflammasome are shown. A NLRP1 
consists of both pyrin domian (PYD) and caspase recruitment domain (CARD) along with the function to find domain (FIIND domain). NLRP1 
directly recuits procaspase-1 through its CARD domain. B The Nlrp3 gene encodes an N-terminal PYD domain, a central nucleotide binding 
and oligomerization domain (NBD) and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRR). NLPR3 lacks a CARD domain and therefore, interacts with ASC 
to recruit procaspase-1. C The Nlrp6 gene encodes an N-terminal PYD domain, a central NBD domain and a C-terminal LRR. NLRP6 is recruited 
to the “specks” formed by ASC oligomerization, leading to procaspase-1 activation. D The Nlrc4 gene encodes an N-terminal CARD domain, 
a central NBD domain, and C-terminal LRR. The interaction of NLRC4 with ASC is unclear. NLRC4 results in pro-IL-1b and proIL-18 processing 
or caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis via an ASC-dependent mechanism or an ASCindependent mechanism. E The AIM protein consists 
of a N-terminal PYD domain, mediating homotypic interactions with ASC and a C-terminal HIN-200 domain for DNA binding

main activation mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome. 
Under the stimulation of microbial or endogenous mol-
ecules like TLR ligands, NF-κB is activated, and pro-
IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and NLRP3 are induced. Then, various 
stimuli like extracellular ATP, glucose, bacterial and virus 
infection, mitochondrial damage/dysfunction, and more 
facilitated the maturation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, 
promoting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.
NLRP3 and NLRP3 inflammasome members like cas-
pase-1, IL-1β and IL-18 are potential therapeutic targets 
due to their role in inflammation-associated diseases and 
cancer. Recent research reported that NLRP3 inflammas-
ome-related genes were dysregulated in 15 cancers [325]. 
NLRP3 is overexpressed and activated in several cancers, 
like non-small cell lung cancer [326], melanoma [327], 
and more. Patients with cancer have a higher frequency 
of Nlrp3 polymorphism, such as pancreatic cancer [328], 
melanoma [329], and others. They were introduced as 
a double-edged sword in tumorigenesis. On one hand, 
the NLRP3 inflammasome promotes tumor formation 
and metastasis in breast cancer [330], and overexpressed 
human IL-1β in mice stomach increases the risk of gastric 
cancer [331]. NLRP3 affects the adaptive immune system 
to promote carcinogenesis in pancreatic cancer [332], and 
pharmacologic blocking of NLRP3 enhances the efficacy of 
immunotherapy [318]. NLRP3 signaling promotes T cell 
differentiation into tumor-promoting T cell populations 
and restricts antitumor T cell immunity [333]. NLRP3-
mediated IL-1β production promotes pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma by immunosuppression [334]. On the 
other hand, mice deficient in NLRP3 are hypersuscepti-
ble to carcinogen-induced colitis-associated cancer (CAC) 
[335]. While NLRP3 inhibition via mitophagy prevents 
CAC, indicating a harmful role of NLRP3 in CAC [336]. 
The differences in gut microbiota, genetic background, 
and experimental technique may explain the inconsistent 
effects of NLRP3 in CAC. Besides, NLRP3 is down-reg-
ulated in hepatic cancer tissues [337], and the up-regula-
tion of NLRP3 inhibits hepatic cancer cell growth [338]. 
The varying functions of NLRP3 in the etiology of cancer 
present novel prospects and obstacles in comprehend-
ing its dual roles of pro- and anti-tumorigenic effects. The 
tumor microenvironment may have an impact on these 
many functions by altering NLRP3 activity. Furthermore, it 
appears that NLRP3 plays distinct roles in the pathophysi-
ology of cancers that originate in particular organs due to 
its variable expression in different cells and tissues, and 
elucidating the role and mechanism of NLRP3 in different 
cancers will contribute to precision therapy.
The role of NLRC4 in inflammation‑mediated carcinogenesis
NLRC4 contains three domains: the N-terminal CARD 
domain, the C-terminal LRR domain, and the NACHT 
domain. NACHT domain is composed of the NBD, heli-
cal domain 1 (HD1), winged helix domain (WHD), and 
helical domain 2 (HD2). A functional type IV secretion 
system (T4SS) for L. pneumophila or a functional type III 
secretion system (T3SS) for S. Typhimurium, S. flexneri, 
and P. aeruginosa is necessary for NLRC4 inflammasome 
activation [339]. Regulatory mechanisms also impact 
NLRC4 activation, mostly comprising transcription 
control and post-translation changes, specifically phos-
phorylation and perhaps ubiquitination. Interferon regu-
latory factor (IRF) 8 induces NLRC4 transcription, and 
infection with S. typhimurium induces NLRC4 phospho-
rylation at serine 533 [340]. Flagellin also induces NLRC4 
phosphorylation but can’t activate NLRC4 inflammas-
ome [341]. NLRC4 has been shown to express differently 
yet variably across various tumor tissues. For example, 
NLRC4 mRNA level is increased in stomach cancer, 
glioma, and breast cancer, but it is decreased in colorec-
tal cancer compared with normal adjacent tissues [339]. 
However, NLRC4 mRNA is almost unchanged in hepa-
tocellular carcinoma [342]. And there is no agreement 
regarding its role in any form of cancer development, 
even in the same tumor type. Knocking out NLRC4 pro-
motes tumor formation in colon cancer [343] and mela-
noma [344]. Higher NLRC4 expression is closely related 
to poor prognosis in breast cancer [345] and glioma 
[346]. Activated NLRC4 inflammasome activates IL-1β, 
which promotes breast cancer progression by adipocyte-
mediated vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) 
expression and angiogenesis [345]. Besides, in colitis-
associated tumorigenesis, the role of NLRC4 depends 
on how NAIPs function. NAIPs have protective effects 
on colon cancer development, which is independent of 
NLRC4 [347]. Even though there isn’t a consensus on 
the involvement of NLRC4 or NAIP in cancer, the neces-
sity to employ littermate controls in these experiments 
will improve future research consistency and reproduc-
ibility. Furthermore, the discovery of NAIPs’ or NLRC4’s 
inflammasome-independent activities in carcinogenesis 
is intriguing because it might reveal new route targets for 
the creation of immunotherapies.
The role of NLRP6 in inflammation‑mediated carcinogenesis
As a recently identified receptor in the mammalian 
innate immune system, the NOD-like receptor fam-
ily pyrin domain containing 6 (NLRP6) was formerly 
known as PYPAF5 [348]. It comprises N-terminal PYD, 
central NBD, and C-terminal LRR domain. Following 
the recognition of PAMP and DAMP, NLRP6 forms the 
NLRP6 inflammasome by assembling with ASC and Cas-
pase-1. This process facilitates the maturation of pro-
IL-1β and pro-IL-18, as well as gasdermin-D-induced 
pyroptosis. NLRP6 functions as an inflammasome or

a non-inflammasome in a variety of ways. Various fac-
tors can regulate the activation of NLRP6. For example, 
mouse macrophages bind to lipoteichoic acid and stim-
ulate the assembly of the NLRP6 inflammasome [349]; 
microbial signals of type I IFN and PPAR-γ agonists regu-
late NLRP6 transcription [350, 351]; microbial metabo-
lites activate or inhibit the NLRP6 inflammasome [352].
NLRP6 gene-deficient mice got more colitis-asso-
ciated colorectal tumors after AOM/DSS treatment 
[313]. Elinav’s experiment suggests that the main 
source of active IL-18 generation through NLRP6 may 
be intestinal epithelial cells [353], which explains that 
NLRP6 gene-deficient animals’ serum and colon tis-
sue showed decreasing levels of IL-18 with time but 
not IL-1. NLRP6 also plays a critical regulatory role in 
the linked pathogenic changes before HCC. For exam-
ple, NLRP6 inflammasome and effector protein IL-18 
suppress the development of NAFLD/nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) and metabolic syndrome by 
regulating intestinal microbiota [354]. NLRP6 overex-
pression reduces steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis 
and lowers the production of CCL20 in alcoholic hepa-
titis (AH) animal models [355]. On the contrary, inhib-
iting the activation of NLRP6 inflammasome may 
improve liver steatosis in mice [356]. The contradic-
tory conclusions regarding the role of NLRP6 in HCC 
may be due to the different stages of the disease and 
the differences in experimental models and methods. 
Further studies are needed to define the role of NLRP6 
in the development and spread of HCC and compre-
hend the extent to which NLRP6 switches from inhib-
iting tumor growth to promoting malignancy. Besides, 
NLRP6 functions as a tumor suppressor factor in gas-
tric cancer (GC) [357] while promoting small cell lung 
cancer (SCLC) metastasis [307]. Even though there is 
low or no expression of NLRP6 in other organs except 
for the colon, liver, and stomach, it’s also related to 
other organ diseases such as brain injury [358] and 
acute renal injury [359]. These suggest the potential 
role of NLRP6 in the carcinogenesis of these organs, 
and further studies are needed to expand the cognitive 
boundaries of NLRP6 research.

The role of AIM2 in inflammation‑mediated carcinogenesis
As the best-characterized member of the AIM2-like 
receptors (ALRs), AIM2 contains the N-terminal PYD 
domain and one or two C-terminal HIN domains (hemat-
opoietic, interferon-inducible, and nuclear localization). 
The multicomponent AIM2 inflammasome is formed 
when AIM2 recognizes dsDNA and recruits the adap-
tor protein ASC, which then activates caspase-1 [360]. 
AIM2 can be directly activated by transfection of dsDNA 
into the cytoplasm [361] and DNA derived from the gut 
microbiota or host-DNA released after intestinal injury 
[362]. While AIM2 activation is negatively regulated 
by several factors such as IFI16-β [363], IFN-inducible 
protein PYD-only protein 3 (POP3) [364], and the viral 
protein pUL83 released during human cytomegalovirus 
(HCMV) [365], herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) tegu-
ment protein VP22 [366], hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) 
[367], HCMV IE86 protein [368] and others. Besides, 
ubiquitinated TRIM11 promotes p62-dependent selec-
tive autophagy-induced AIM2 inflammasome degrada-
tion following DNA stimulation [369].
AIM2 has bidirectional roles in tumorigenesis in differ-
ent types of cancer. In hepatic and colon cancer, AIM2 
suppresses tumor growth [370], whereas in cutaneous 
squamous cell carcinoma, it promotes tumor growth 
[371]. AIM2 contains a site for microsatellite instabil-
ity, which leads to gene mutations in CRC and inhibits 
its development [372, 373]. Additionally, it was demon-
strated that AIM2 has a role in the pathophysiology of 
DNA damage caused by chemotherapy, suggesting that 
medications targeting AIM2 may offer therapeutic 
advantages during radiation therapy [362]. These indi-
cate that suppressing the activity of AIM2 inflammasome 
could be investigated due to their role in carcinogenesis. 
During the past decade, several synthetic inhibitors of 
AIM2 such as suppressive oligodeoxynucleotides [364], 
pyrin-containing proteins, and antimicrobial cathelicidin 
peptides [374] have been discovered, and exploring their 
anti-tumor effect and underlying mechanisms are prom-
ising strategies for cancer prevention and treatment.
The role of inflammasome adaptor ASC 
in inflammation‑mediated carcinogenesis
In human leukemia cells treated with chemotherapeutics 
drugs, ASC was first identified as a protein that aggre-
gates (or “specks”), which was also known as PYCARD/
Target of Methylation-induced Silencing-1 (TMS1). The 
ASC/TMS1 protein has a 22 kDa structure and com-
prises two domains: the C-terminal CARD domain and 
PYD domain [375]. Several immune and normal epi-
thelial cells express ASC/TMS1, which localizes in the 
nucleus, redistributes in the cytoplasm during activation, 
and finally aggregates into specks [376].
ASC can be either increased in tumor cells and over-
expressed in the myeloid compartment (mostly TAMs) 
within the tumor microenvironment, or downregulated 
in malignancies, primarily due to aberrant methylation. 
On one hand, it is a key adapter molecule of the inflam-
masome complex, which is responsible for mediating the 
release of inflammatory cytokines of IL-1β and IL-18, 
which were known to have tumor-promoting effects 
[377–379]. Besides, ASC also exhibits pro-tumor effects 
through other indirect pathways such as chronic inflam-
mation, macrophage recruitment, IL-17 pathway activa-
tion, angiogenesis, and others [378]. On the other hand, 
ASC was downregulated in several types of cancer, and 
the tumor-suppressive effect of ASC was supported by 
the discovery that methylation silences its expression 
and prevents tumor cells from passing through apopto-
sis [380]. Besides, the regulatory effect of ASC on thymic 
stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) secretion by cancer-
associated fibroblasts (CAFs) contributes to improving 
the overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients [381]. 
ASC delays UV-induced skin tumorigenesis [382]. ASC 
inhibits lung cancer suppression via Bcl-2 and pSrc 
[383]. Restoring ASC expression makes colorectal can-
cer cells more susceptible to caspase-independent cell 
death caused by genotoxic stress [380]. In addition, ASC 
showed dual roles even in the same type of tumor. For 
example, ASC inhibits tumorigenesis in primary mela-
noma, while ASC promotes tumorigenesis in metastatic 
melanoma [314]; mice had fewer tumors when ASC 
was specifically deficient in myeloid cells, while mice 
had more tumors when ASC was specifically deficient 
in keratinocyte cells [384]. These opposing functions 
of ASC may be due to the tissue or cell-specific expres-
sion context, and dissecting the role of ASC in differ-
ent cancer types and additional research on ASC and its 
upstream and downstream mediators may improve our 
comprehensive of molecular processes behind carcino-
genesis and contribute to the ASC targeting strategies for 
cancer treatment and prevention.
Targeting components of the extracellular matrix 
for cancer chemoprevention
As a highly dynamic structure, the extracellular matrix 
(ECM) is present in all tissues and constantly undergoing 
controlled remodeling. ECM comprises large, insoluble 
proteins mainly formed of separate structural domains 
with highly conserved sequences and arrangements. 
These domains are glycosylated and often have sulfated 
glycosaminoglycan chains, resulting in negative charges 
[385]. This characteristic of ECM molecules gives them 
great potential to interact with other charged molecules, 
like growth factors and chemokines, to affect the acces-
sibility or local concentration of these factors [386]. Since 
Page 62 of 96

collagen, the most abundant ECM component, was first 
identified and characterized in the 1930s.
In chronically inflamed tissues, the ECM fragments 
or ECM molecules are upregulated, and they’re modu-
lated by proteases, especially MMPs, and inflamma-
tory cytokines such as TNF, IFNγ, and TGFβ generated 
by extravasating cells or activated tissue-resident cells. 
Recent research has found that immune cells can be 
stimulated by ECM components or fragments that are 
increased during inflammation, thus sustaining the 
inflammatory response. On the one hand, ECM can 
serve a structural role as a barrier or scaffold for cells that 
invade inflamed tissues. On the other hand, the biophysi-
cal characteristics and their biochemical makeup provide 
immune cells with specific signals that regulate prolifera-
tion, migration, apoptosis, adhesion, differentiation, and 
survival.
Aberrant ECM influences immune cell behavior, such 
as infiltration and activation, and plays a role in cancer 
metastasis. For example, activating the collagen receptor 
DDR1 can enhance macrophage infiltration in athero-
sclerotic plaques [387]. The size and density of collagen 
fibrils can influence the migration of immune cells [388]. 
Although immune cell infiltration is promoted, collagen 
type I hinders macrophages from effectively killing can-
cer cells by blocking their polarization and subsequent 
activation [389]. This highlights the complex character-
istics of how ECM deregulation modulates the immune 
response. Furthermore, breast cancer cells with high lev-
els of the hyaluronan receptor CD44 have a better sur-
vival rate compared to those with low CD44 levels [390]. 
This indicates that hyaluronan and possibly other compo-
nents of the extracellular matrix support the survival of 
metastatic cancer cells.
Tenascin-C (TNC) is a glycoprotein that plays a sig-
nificant role in the ECM and is notably expressed in 
pathological conditions, particularly in cancer and 
chronic inflammatory diseases. TNC activates TLR4, 
which in turn stimulates macrophages and fibroblasts 
to release pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, 
IL-8, and TNF-α [391], and affects the recruitment 
of immune cells [392]. Higher TNC expression was 
observed in melanoma cells from advanced tumors and 
metastases, while early melanoma tumors and normal 
melanocytes displayed weak or absent TNC expression 
[393]. Tenascin-C is located in the bone endosteum and 
contributes to the development of prostate bone metas-
tases [394]. TNC deficiency in human breast cancer 
cells significantly decreases metastasis to the lungs and 
bones in xenograft models [395].
Dysregulated ECM remodeling leads to many diseases, 
including cancer. As one of the major components of 
cancer, the ECM plays various crucial roles in signaling 
regulation, microenvironment modulation, and mechan-
ical support. The ECM shows multifaceted effects in 
regulating multiple hallmarks, including angiogenesis, 
tumor progression, immune response, and cancer cell 
migration of cancer. Under specific circumstances, the 
ECM restrains malignant tumor progression [396]. How-
ever, the ECM also promotes tumor progression [389]. 
Collagen IV over-expression boosts cell survival of lung 
cancer [397]. The ECM also facilitates the metastasis of 
cancer cells [398]. The miR-29 over-expression inhibits 
metastasis by regulating gene expression in ECM remod-
eling in breast cancer [399]. This suggests that blocking 
the ECM molecules may be therapeutically beneficial 
for cancer prevention and treatment. The ECM com-
ponents including tenascin C, endostatin, tumstatin, 
canstatin, arresten, and hexastatin also have pro- and 
anti-angiogenic functions. For example, tenascin C pro-
motes cancer cell proliferation and induces angiogenesis 
[400]. Arresten suppresses the angiogenesis of HUVECs 
by blocking PI3K/Akt signaling pathway [401]. The ECM 
plays a vital role in regulating immune responses. For 
example, the ECM niche in the spleen promotes the 
differentiation and survival of marginal zone B cells to 
support antibody production [402]. Besides, matrikines 
regulate immune cell behaviors such as the interaction 
of immune cells with cancer cells [403], the recruitment 
and activation of immune cells [404], and more. Here, we 
will summarize the role of the ECM components includ-
ing ECM proteins, ECM fragments, the proteases that 
cleave the ECM, the MMPs that degrade the ECM, and 
others, the underlying mechanisms are also illustrated. 
A deeper comprehension of the biological activities of 
the ECM will provide intriguing opportunities for thera-
peutic intervention of cancer. More details regarding the 
function of ECM proteins and fragments in cancer are 
provided in Table 8.
The chemo‑preventive effects of FDA‑approved 
anti‑inflammatory drugs in cancer 
chemoprevention
Long-term users of aspirin or other NSAIDs had a 
decreased incidence of cancer, which offers encourag-
ing opportunities for cancer chemoprevention. Aspirin 
can reduce the risk of tumor occurrence [405], prevent 
colorectal cancer [406], inhibit metastasis of melanoma 
and breast cancer [407], and more. Besides, steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs such as dexamethasone, sup-
press tumor growth of non-small cell lung cancer [408], 
enhance gynecologic cancer chemotherapy [409], and 
more. These FDA-approved anti-inflammation drugs have 
well-established safety profiles, making them potentially 
valuable tools for cancer chemoprevention. Clarifying 
the anti-tumor effects and underlying mechanisms of the

anti-inflammation drugs will provide novel options and 
targets for cancer prevention and treatment. Here, we 
will summarize the effects and underlying mechanisms of 
FDA-approved anti-inflammatory drugs, and the advan-
tages and disadvantages of these drugs’ application in can-
cer chemoprevention will be also be discussed.
The anti‑tumor effect of non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory 
drugs
The chemo-preventive effect of NSAIDs in cancer was 
proposed in 2002 [410]. Epidemiological studies have 
shown a consistent 40–50% reduction in the risk of devel-
oping CRC by taking NSAIDs [411]. The epidemiological 
evidence supporting the efficacy of aspirin for the pre-
vention of CRC is substantial [412]. As a classic NSAID, 
the role of aspirin in cancer chemoprevention has been 
well-studied. For example, aspirin reduces the risk of 
breast cancer [413] and pancreatic cancer [414], reduces 
mortality in endometrial cancer patients [18] and colon 
cancer [415], inhibits tumor progression of HCC [22], 
and pancreatic cancer [416] and others. Except for aspi-
rin, other NSAIDs like indomethacin, acetaminophen, 
ibuprofen, meloxicam, and others also exhibit anti-tumor 
effects in various cancers. For example, indomethacin 
inhibits cell proliferation and invasion in colorectal can-
cer [417] and breast cancer [418], induces apoptosis of 
colon cancer [419], and suppresses angiogenesis of colon 
cancer [420] and others. A comprehensive list of the anti-
tumor properties of NSAIDs is shown in Table 9.
The anti‑tumor effect of steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs
Unlike NSAIDs, the anti-tumor effect of steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs is controversial. As a commonly 
used class of steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, on the one 
side, glucocorticoids (GCs) such as dexamethasone as an 
adjunctive treatment strategy for lymphoma in the clinic, 
they can reduce tumor size and improve patient’s tolerance 
to chemotherapy [421]. About other solid tumors, GCs 
reduce treatment-related toxicity after surgery or radio-
therapy in brain tumors [422] and reduce the risk of lung 
cancer [423]. On the other side, GCs favor pancreatic can-
cer progression [424], promote metastasis of breast cancer 
[425], induce resistance in prostate cancer [426], and oth-
ers. A comprehensive list of the anti-tumor properties of 
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is shown in Table 10.
The outcome of clinical application 
of anti‑inflammation drugs in cancer 
chemoprevention
Although cytokines are important regulators of both 
innate and adaptive anticancer immunity, their extreme 
toxicity, pleiotropy, and poor drug-like qualities make 
them challenging to utilize as treatments [427, 428]. 
Developments in immune checkpoint blocking, protein 
engineering, and receptor biology and biochemistry drive 
rekindled interest in developing cytokine therapies [429, 
430]. Clinical prospects have emerged from engineer-
ing strategies targeted at disentangling cytokines’ pro- 
and anti-tumorigenic characteristics, which have shown 
encouraging preclinical outcomes [431]. Cytokines 
are the first effective cancer immunotherapy to pro-
vide humans with long-lasting anti-tumor immunity. 
Recombinant interferon (IFNα2b) and IL-2 are approved 
cytokine therapeutics for cancer clinical treatment [432].
Other cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, 
IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-21, IL-2R, IL-4R, IL-5R, IFNα, 
IFNβ, IFNγ, TNFα and more have also been applied 
in clinical trials. For example, in a phase I/II study 
(NCT00000769), IL-4 at the dose of 1.5 microg/kg/day is 
poorly tolerated in patients with advanced AIDS-related 
Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and didn’t show an effective role 
in KS [433]. The anti-tumor effect of IL-4 in patients is 
ambiguous, and more clinical trials are recruiting or 
undergoing in other cancers such as recurrent malig-
nant astrocytoma (NCT00003842) and ER + breast 
cancer (NCT05967884). In phase II clinical trial 
(NCT00433446), a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 
(CNTO328, also called siltuximab) was applied to pre-
treated patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, 
CNTO328 resulted in a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 
response rate of 3.8% and a response evaluation crite-
ria in solid tumors (RECIST) stable disease rate of 23% 
[434]. In a phase 2 randomized study (NCT00911859), 
CNTO328 at 8.3 and 11 mg/kg doses were well tolerated, 
while CNTO328 didn’t significantly improve the com-
plete response (CR) and long-term outcomes in patients 
of multiple myeloma [435].
Besides, several clinical trials have examined the 
combination of anti-inflammatory agents and ICIs. For 
instance, a phase 2 trial study (NCT03631407) inves-
tigated the combination of vicriviroc (a CCL5 antago-
nist) administered at doses of 150 or 250 mg alongside 
pembrolizumab at 200 mg. This combination dem-
onstrated limited antitumor activity in patients with 
advanced or metastatic microsatellite stable (MSS) or 
mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) CRC. However, the 
toxicity associated with this combination treatment 
was manageable [436]. In another phase 2 trial study 
(NCT03396952), the efficacy of high-dose aspirin in 
combination with ICIs is similar to that of ICI alone 
[437]. In a phase Ib/II trial study (NCT02807844), the 
combination of lacnotuzumab (CSF-1 inhibitor) and 
spartalizumab (PD-1 inhibitor) did not meet the gat-
ing criteria for efficacy [438]. Numerous clinical trials 
are currently recruiting participants or ongoing. For

instance, siltuximab, an IL-6 inhibitor, is being tested to 
prevent severe irAEs during the rechallenge of ICIs in 
patients with advanced cancer (NCT06470971). Addi-
tionally, drugs used in chemokine modulation therapy, 
such as celecoxib, recombinant interferon alfa-2b, and 
rintatolimod, have been combined with pembroli-
zumab in the treatment of metastatic triple-negative 
breast cancer (NCT03599453). Further investigation 
is needed to fully evaluate the clinical utility and iden-
tify the patient subgroups that are most likely to benefit 
from the combination of anti-inflammatory agents with 
ICIs. More information about the clinical trials of these 
cytokines or their antibody or their derivatives is sum-
marized in Table 11.
The application of artificial intelligence (AI) 
in inflammation‑related cancer for cancer 
chemoprevention
In recent years, AI has gained significant popularity. With 
the advancement of deep learning and the availability of 
extensive imaging databases, AI-based computer-aided 
diagnostic (CAD) systems—which incorporate machine 
learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and artificial neural 
networks (ANN)—are increasingly being used to stand-
ardize and improve the evaluation of medical imaging.
AI models have been used to identify inflammatory and 
immune cells in cancer tissues. For instance, deep learn-
ing techniques have been employed to detect tumor-
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which could serve as 
a potential prognostic marker for testicular germ cell 
tumors [439]. Deep convolutional neural networks based 
on supervised learning have been used to quantify the 
biomarkers of immune cells in the lung cancer microen-
vironment [440]. TILs densities and spatial structures can 
be analyzed using deep learning on pathology images, 
providing insights into the tumor-immune microenvi-
ronment [441]. Deep learning supervised by antibodies 
was utilized to quantify tumor-infiltrating immune cells, 
an emerging prognostic biomarker in breast cancer sam-
ples [442]. AI-based pathology served as a biomarker for 
progression-free survival in patients treated with atezoli-
zumab and bevacizumab for hepatocellular carcinoma 
[443]. Identifying PLA2G1B, a gene crucial for lipid 
metabolism and inflammation, suggests it may serve as a

preventive marker for lung cancer through bioinformat-
ics and machine learning methods [444].
Artificial intelligence has recently emerged as a power-
ful and promising tool for developing anti-tumor medi-
cations more quickly, affordably, and effectively [445]. 
Due to the crucial role of TLR4 in pro-inflammatory 
responses, and considering the costly, time-consuming, 
and labor-intensive nature of traditional drug design 
approaches, novel TLR4 modulators identified through 
artificial intelligence and computer-assisted drug design 
show great promise and have demonstrated positive 
results [446]. Due to their high selectivity and low tox-
icity, anti-inflammatory peptides (AIPs) have shown 
greater therapeutic potential against inflammatory dis-
eases compared to small compounds. Additionally, 
machine learning plays a crucial role in predicting pep-
tides [447].
Artificial intelligence solutions for endoscopy-based 
cancer evaluation hold great promise for the future. 
However, the application of these models in clinical 
practice faces several challenges, including the need for 
more robust validation studies and overcoming regula-
tory hurdles. At the same time, AI facilitates data-driven 
decision-making, helping to expedite drug discovery and 
development while reducing failure rates. Additionally, 
AI-powered precision medicine allows doctors to tailor 
early therapies to the individual needs of each patient.
Open questions/Future perspective
It is now evident that inflammatory cells and related 
inflammatory pathways significantly influence tumor 
growth. However, several issues still need to be 
addressed. 1) In the absence of an external carcinogenic 
agent, can inflammation itself lead to neoplasia? While 
various studies have suggested that inflammation can 
cause cancer without the presence of exogenous car-
cinogens, evidence shows that more DNA mutations 
were observed in a mouse model of bowel inflamma-
tion lacking IL-10 when exposed to external carcinogens 
[448], and more powerful proof is required to make such 
a disclosure. 2) Due to the dual role of inflammatory 
molecules, such as inflammasomes and interleukins, in 
cancer development and progression, it is important to 
consider the question about whether we can suppress 
tumor growth by shifting the balance between “bad” 
inflammation and “good” inflammation? The adaptive, 
humoral, and innate immune systems all play integral 
roles in the complex relationship between local and sys-
temic inflammation and tumor growth. Therefore, trig-
gering an effective anti-tumor adaptive immune response 
is crucial and requires careful attention. Recently, the use 
of bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) pro-
tein inhibitors (iBET) has been reported to induce cell 
death and reduce the aggressiveness of oral squamous 
cell carcinoma (OSCC) [449]. iBET protects mice from

pancreatic inflammation caused by LPS and the result-
ing cytokine storm, while also inhibiting cell proliferation 
in pancreatic cancer [450]. Another promising approach 
is to restore a balanced host response by normalizing 
the inflammatory network. This involves reducing high 
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other tumor-
promoting characteristics of infiltrating cells while 
increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines. 
3) Do sex steroid hormones play a role in the interplay 
between inflammation and cancer? The occurrence of 
tumors varies between genders due to differing sex hor-
mones. Analyzing the interaction between these hor-
mones and inflammation in cancer development could 
enhance the treatment of hormone-related cancers, such 
as breast, lung, ovarian, cervical, and prostate cancers. 
Recent studies have shown that Treg cells, which play a 
crucial role in managing immune responses and reducing 
tissue inflammation, are more abundant in male visceral 
adipose tissue (VAT) compared to females. These differ-
ences in Treg cell populations are influenced by the tissue 
environment and shaped by sex hormones, which help to 
decrease inflammation in adipose tissue [451]. Consid-
ering the widespread use of selective androgen receptor 
modulators and selective estrogen receptor modulators 
like tamoxifen, understanding the interaction between 
sex hormones, inflammation, and cancer will signifi-
cantly influence the clinical treatment of cancer.
Discussion
Cancer is still the second leading cause of death after car-
diovascular disease in the world, the main reason is that 
about 50% of cancers are diagnosed at a late stage. The 
limited efficacy of existing treatment methods and the 
high failure rate in drug development make the situation 
more complex, and there is an urgent need for a better 
understanding of disease mechanisms, the development 
of early detection technology, and cancer chemopreven-
tion strategies. Here, we systematically analyzed the role 
of inflammation and its related molecules in tumors. 
We expect that a substantial amount of information and 
intricacies continually uncovered in the area will even-
tually be condensed into a few key principles that regu-
late the molecular and cellular processes underpinning 
inflammation that promote tumor growth.
The role of inflammatory molecules in cancer has 
attracted the researchers’ attention during the past dec-
ades. New insights into the pro- or anti-tumor effect in 
the tumor and its microenvironment have given impetus 
to drug discovery and patient evaluation of inflamma-
tion-directed strategies. For example, as the most effec-
tive and widely distributed family of cytokines, IFN-Is, or 
type I interferons, are essential for launching a success-
ful anti-tumor response. Antigen-presenting cells require 
interferon-alpha to trigger T cell responses; additionally, 
IFN-Is directly boost CD8 + T cell activity and cytotoxic-
ity, stimulate CD4 + Th1 cell development, augment cyto-
toxicity from natural killer cells, and limit regulatory T 
cells. However, IFN-Is induce the expression of negative 
regulatory molecules, which can reduce immunological 
responses and induce fatigue, thus facilitating the growth 
of tumors. Besides, other inflammatory molecules such 
as interleukins, tumor necrosis factors, colony-stim-
ulating factors, chemokines, and inflammasomes also 
showed multifaceted effects in cancer. The two-side effect 
may depend on the cancer type, time, cells present, total 
IFN-I signal levels, and others. Therefore, further studies 
are needed to dissect the dual role of these inflammatory 
molecules in different cancer models, which will enable 
the identification of novel molecular and immunological 
targets and lead to the development of novel therapeutic 
strategies. Recently, researchers created a portable smart 
blue-light controlled (PSLC) gadget based on optogenetic 
technology. The findings demonstrate that blue light can 
efficiently control pro-inflammatory cytokine expression 
in both in vitro and in vivo settings, which offers a unique 
strategy for cytokine therapy [452].
FDA-approved non-anticancer drugs- “old medicine”, 
have obvious advantages in anti-tumor treatment—“new 
use”, because FDA-approved drug applications could bet-
ter avoid numerous obstacles and uncertainties in every 
step of converting drugs into clinical applications. This 
suggests that the application of non-anticancer drugs 
may be a promising strategy for cancer chemoprevention. 
The evident role of inflammation in cancer development 
and progression prompted the application of anti-inflam-
matory medications as a therapeutic strategy. While the 
application of anti-inflammatory drugs in clinical anti-
tumor therapy still needs to overcome several obstacles. 
1) Targeted delivery to the cancerous cell. Although the 
anti-inflammatory medications now approved by the 
FDA are undoubtedly effective, their off-target effects 
and toxicities make them less desirable options for can-
cer therapy when taken at the current dosages and fre-
quency. Rather, to improve drug targetability and reduce 
off-target adverse effects, recent developments in nano-
technology have facilitated a paradigm shift away from 
traditional anti-inflammatory medications and toward 
anti-inflammatory nano-therapeutics in cancer therapy. 
However, the field of anti-inflammatory nanomedi-
cines is still in its infancy with little commercial applica-
tion, and there is a great need to consider and identify 
the issues with nano-inflammatory therapies to aid in 
the practical clinical translation of commercially avail-
able anti-inflammatory nanotherapeutics. 2) Tumor cells 
have different or even opposite responses to these anti-
inflammatory drugs. Abundant evidence indicates that

anti-inflammation drugs are promising candidates for 
preventing carcinogenesis and cancer recurrence because 
of their availability and relatively low occurrence of side 
effects compared to other chemotherapeutic drugs. Nev-
ertheless, due to the paucity of information and the com-
plexity of carcinogenesis, these anti-inflammation drugs 
showed different or even inverse effects. Well-designed, 
long-term clinical trials are required to ascertain the 
clinical application potential of these medications, and 
additional trials are required to investigate the doses, 
kinds, and length of response of these drugs. 3) The side 
effects after long-term use. Although the FDA-approved 
anti-inflammatory drugs have far fewer side effects than 
chemotherapeutics, some anti-inflammatory drugs, such 
as aspirin, also showed obvious side effects after long-
term use. The main side effects of NSAIDs are cardio-
vascular (CV) and renal adverse effects. While the main 
side effects of seroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as 
glucocorticoids (GRs) are diabetes, glaucoma, and sup-
pression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, 
among others. NSAIDs cause cell death by directly tar-
geting mitochondria, while NSAIDs have been shown to 
enhance mitochondrial health in dose-dependent ways 
[453], which suggesting that future research should focus 
on comparing equipotent dosages of these drugs. Addi-
tionally, it’s important to assess the alleviation of symp-
toms. There are ongoing efforts to develop selective GR 
agonists (SEGRAs) with the hypothesis that they are safer 
than traditional glucocorticoids. To support this hypoth-
esis, appropriate in vitro and in vivo studies are needed 
to provide reliable experimental results. 4) Patients con-
tinue to experience other thromboembolic events despite 
aspirin therapy, which is known as aspirin resistance 
(AR). Besides, anti-inflammatory drugs may lead to a 
degree of drug resistance. For example, dexamethasone 
can increase the resistance of human tumor cells to ion-
izing radiation and chemotherapy [454].
Hence, larger-scale adoption of the chemoprevention 
strategy is likely to require improved identification of 
individuals for whom the protective benefits outweigh 
the harms. Such a precision medicine approach may 
emerge through further clarification of these anti-inflam-
matory drugs’ mechanism of action.
