INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer detection has improved over de-
cades with increasingly advanced technology,
including digital breast tomosynthesis, breast MR
imaging, and ultrasound. Breast imaging modal-
ities with high diagnostic accuracy have a signifi-
cant impact on population health, as breast
cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most
commonly diagnosed nonskin cancer globally
and accounts for 1 in 8 cancer diagnoses overall.1
Breast cancer also remains the second leading
cause of cancer-related mortality in women.2
Treatment
of
breast
cancer
has
greatly
improved over the past several decades, and
increased emphasis has been placed on the mo-
lecular and genetic features of breast cancer.
However, the size of the malignant tumor (T stage),
number of nodal metastases (N stage), and pres-
ence or absence of distant metastatic disease (M
stage) at the time of diagnosis also directly affects
patient prognosis.3 Imaging plays a key role in
determining overall clinical stage.
This article highlights traditional breast imaging
techniques, advances in imaging, as well as
emerging technologies and potential future direc-
tions. Mammography, ultrasound, and breast MR
imaging are the most common tools used not
only for screening and diagnosis but also for preop-
erative locoregional staging for newly diagnosed

KEY POINTS
 Mammography is the primary imaging modality used for breast cancer screening and is associated
with a significant decrease in breast cancer mortality. Although screening guidelines vary by pro-
fessional society, annual screening mammography starting at age 40 years for average-risk women
is associated with the greatest reduction in mortality.
 Supplemental screening can be considered as an adjunct to mammography for women at high and
intermediate risk for breast cancer, as well as in women with dense breasts. The 2 most prevalent
modalities for supplemental screening are contrast-enhanced breast MR imaging and ultrasound.
 Molecular breast imaging also can be used to detect mammographically occult breast cancer,
particularly in patients with contraindications to MR imaging, and provides functional metabolic
data.
