Background: Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) are predictive/prognostic markers in breast 
cancer. While most hormone receptor-positive breast cancers are ER+/PR+ and ER+/PR-, rare cases of ER-/PR+ 
raise the possibility of technical or artifactual issues and can trigger re-testing and confusion. Commercially 
available antibodies target different ER/PR isoforms and have been reported to generate different results. Our goal 
is to compare the incidence and clinicopathologic features of ER-/PR+ cases using different two FDA-approved 
platforms. 
Design: A retrospective review of 2089 breast cancer cases with ER and PR from 1/2019 and 7/2020, including 
1639 cases tested on Ventana (ER SP1 and PR 1E2 antibodies) and 450 cases tested on Leica (ER 6F11 and PR 
16 antibodies). Negative receptor results are defined as <1% of tumor cells with nuclear staining, low positive as 1-
10%, and positive as >10%. Clinicopathologic data, including HER2 status, Ki-67 index, tumor histologic type, and 
tumor grade, were collected for correlation. Statistics performed using Fisher’s exact test. 
Results: ER results across the Ventana and Leica platforms were similar, while PR results were significantly 
different (p <0.001) (Table 1). The ER- rate was similar between Ventana SP1 (445/1639, 27.2%) and Leica 6F11 
(119/450, 26.4%). Among the ER- cases, the overall PR+ rate was 14.0% (79/564), ten times higher in cases 
tested with Ventana PR 1E2 (77/445, 17.3%) than with Leica PR 16 (2/119, 1.7%) (Figure 1). The ER-/PR+ cases 
were predominantly invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) (60/79, 75.9%) and Nottingham histologic grade 3 (49/79, 
62.0%), HER2 negative by IHC (46/79, 58.2%), and with Ki-67 indices ranging from low (<17%) (7/79, 8.9%) to high 
(>35%) (26/79, 32.9%) (Table 1).

Conclusions: The significantly different PR results across the Ventana and Leica platforms are reflected in the 
higher rate of ER-/PR+ cases (17.3%) when using the Ventana system compared to the 1.7% of ER-/PR+ cases 
when using the Leica system. ER-/PR+ cases overall correlate with IDC histologic type, HER2-negative status, and 
high Ki-67. Caution is warranted when interpreting conflicting ER and PR results with these poor clinicopathologic 
characteristics due to the potential impact on treatment decisions.

Discordance Between Intraoperative and Final Diagnoses of Sentinel Lymph Node Frozen 
Section in Patients with Breast Cancer: Causes and Improvements 
Ethar Al-Husseinawi1, Rashna Madan2, Fang Fan1

Disclosures: Ethar Al-Husseinawi: None; Rashna Madan: None; Fang Fan: None 
Background: Intraoperative frozen section (FS) evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) is an effective practice in 
many institutions for breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy or lumpectomy/mastectomy after neoadjuvant 
systemic therapy (NAST). Cases with positive SLN FS diagnosis can proceed with axillary lymph node dissection 
(ALND) in the same operative procedure. This study aims to review our discordant cases in SLN FS evaluations, 
especially in the era of NAST. The causes of discordance, ways to improve, and clinical impact are discussed. 
Design: Retrospective review was performed of all breast cancer surgeries with intraoperative SLN FS between 
July 2019 and June 2020. Discordant cases were identified by comparing the frozen section and final diagnoses of 
 
 
 
 
1142 
SLN. Causes of discrepancy were categorized as technical and interpretive. Impact on clinical management was 
also assessed. False negative rate (FNR) was calculated as FN/True positive +False negative, and adjusted FNR 
(AFNR) was calculated as FN/total number of cases. 
Results: A total of 337 cases with SLN FS were identified. Among them, 261 cases had concordant negative SLN 
diagnosis and 51 cases had concordant positive SLN diagnosis. Twenty-five cases had negative FS but positive 
final diagnoses (false negative cases). There was no case with false positive FS diagnosis. FNR was 32.9% and 
AFNR was 7.4%. Of the 25 FN cases, 21 were due to technical (84%) and 4 (16%) were due to interpretive causes. 
Of the 4 cases with interpretive discrepancy, 2 had lobular histology and 2 were due to tumor bed changes after 
NAST. Technical causes included superficial sectioning (tumor only present on deeper permanent sections), tissue 
folding, poor sectioning of fatty nodes and suboptimal staining. Micrometastasis accounted for 19 of the 25 FN 
cases (76%). Subsequent completion ALND was performed in 9 of the 25 FN cases (36%). 
Conclusions: SLN FS remains an accurate method to guide axillary management in the same operative 
procedure. Our false negative rate is aligned with the reported range in the literature. Most cases are 
micrometastases and due to technical issues. Lobular morphology and tumor bed histology remain challenging in 
FS interpretation. Improvement of FS accuracy as the result of this quality improvement project could be achieved 
by careful gross examination, better sectioning practices and optimizing the staining protocol. Pathologists should 
be aware of the pitfalls of lobular and tumor bed morphology.

Background: Root cause analysis (RCA) is a powerful tool in any Quality Management System (QMS). The ISO 
15189 standard is an international accreditation standard for medical laboratories. The ISO 15189 standard 
requires that laboratories perform RCA for the identification and control of non-conformances, and to deploy 
suitable corrective and preventive actions in all aspects of laboratory testing, including Anatomic Pathology (AP). 
The aim of this study was to ascertain the awareness, current conditions, and potential opportunities for AP RCA 
amongst CAP 15189 accredited laboratories in the United States. 
Design: The CAP 15189 Committee drafted a survey of 16 questions pertaining to the awareness, barriers, 
encountered error-types, weaknesses, and follow-up corrective actions in a typical AP RCA. The online survey was 
distributed to 66 CAP 15189 accredited laboratories in the United States. 
Results: Of 66 laboratories, 33 responded to the survey (50% response rate). Amongst the responders, the largest 
segment was academic medical centers (37%), followed by reference laboratories (31%). While 22 (67%) routinely 
performed AP RCA, 11 (33%) responders were either not aware of RCA or did not routinely perform it. Reasons for 
not performing RCA included a lack of knowledge (50%), lack of a formal process (25%), or lack of time (25%). The 
most common trigger of RCA was a singular AP error. The most common focus of AP RCA was on 
grossing/histology, followed by accessioning. The most common approach was formal interviews (87.67%) followed 
by Five Whys (73%) and Brainstorming (73%). The majority (60%) of responders had uncovered combined 
personnel and systemic/process issues, whereas 33% of responders identified systemic/process weaknesses only, 
and 6.67% of responders identified concerns with specific personnel issues only. Pathologists were part of the AP 
RCA team for both interpretive and non-interpretive errors. 
Conclusions: The survey provides a good reflection of the current state of AP RCA amongst CAP 15189 
accredited laboratories. While the practice of AP RCA is widely prevalent, lack of knowledge and/or formal process 
 
 
 
 
1143 
may preclude its use in a subset of laboratories. There is a clear opportunity to improve educational QMS offerings 
in this area. AP RCA helps uncover systemic gaps in pre-analytics and manual steps, improving specimen safety 
and patient care.

Disclosures: Roa Alqabbani: None; Joanna Chan: None; Allison Goldberg: None 
Background: Specimen adequacy is the most important quality assurance component of a cervical Papanicolaou 
smear. We use cellularity of endocervical curettage (ECC) to evaluate specimen adequacy for accurate diagnosis 
of high-grade dysplasia (HGD). 
Design: All patients with HGD diagnosed in an excisional biopsy (LEEP) from 1/1/2019 to 12/31/19 and an ECC in 
the preceding six months at our institution were included (n=41). ECCs prior to the LEEP were evaluated for 
cellularity of squamous cells using Aperio eSlide Manager. Biopsy results concurrent to the ECC were noted. 
Cellularity between positive and negative ECCs were compared using a student’s T-test. Proportion of ECCs and 
concurrent biopsies undergoing immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for p16 were compared using chi-square test. 
P-value was <0.05. 
Results: ECCs positive for HGD have increased cellularity compared to negative ECCs (mean cellularity 2866 vs 
497, p<0.05). Further, IHC staining for p16 was more likely to be performed on an ECC positive for HGD than on a 
negative ECC (63% vs 3%, p<0.05). Biopsies performed concurrently with a negative ECC were more likely to 
undergo p16 IHC than biopsies performed concurrently with a positive ECC (52% vs 0%, p<0.05). Finally, there 
was no difference in proportion of biopsies undergoing IHC staining for p16 when comparing biopsies positive for 
HGD and negative biopsies (38% vs 56% p=0.33).

Table 1. Mean cellularity and p16 IHC staining in biopsy and ECC specimens 
Conclusions: We find a cellularity of approximately 3000 cells adequate to diagnose HGD in an ECC and a 
cellularity of approximately 500 cells to be inadequate. Further, we find p16 IHC commonly used as a “rule-in” test 
on ECCs at our institution. Biopsies accompanying a negative ECC are more likely to undergo p16 IHC than those 
accompanying an ECC positive for HGD, but there is no difference in proportion of biopsies undergoing p16 IHC 
when comparing positive and negative results in the biopsies themselves. These findings further support the need 
for adequate cellularity for diagnosis in ECC, especially when a biopsy is technically difficult. Further areas for 
exploration include increasing our sample size to more precisely define the exact minimum cellularity necessary to 
diagnose HGD in an ECC and investigating possible laboratory procedures to maximize cellularity of ECCs

1Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA, 2Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, PA 
Disclosures: Lame Balikani: None; Sharon Copley: None; Kossivi Dantey: None; Olukemi Esan: None 
Background: The pathological diagnosis of hematologic neoplasms (HN) can be aided by the use of flow 
cytometry analysis (FCA).  Acquisition methods include fine needle aspiration (FNA) and core needle biopsy (CNB). 
However, at our institution, when an HN is clinically suspected, there is no specific guideline in place regarding 
 
 
 
 
1144 
which sample acquisition method is more likely to generate a high diagnostic yield (sufficient quantity of viable cells 
for analysis). 
Design: We reviewed HN cases whose diagnoses were supported by FCA sampled by FNA or CNB, over a period 
of about ten years ranging from January 2010 to July 2020. The main inclusion criterion was all cases with a 
cytological diagnosis of a hematologic neoplasm along with FCA. Pertinent data including the cases with sufficient 
cellularity, insufficient cellularity and low cellularity/sample issues were collected.  Statistical analysis was 
performed. 
Results: Two-hundred and ten (210) FCA cases were selected.  The acquisition method for 74 cases was FNA 
while 136 were acquired by CNB.  FNA acquisition method resulted in a sufficient cellularity rate of 70 %( 52 
cases), an insufficient cellularity rate of 15 %( 11 cases) and a low cellularity rate of 15 %( 11 cases).  The 
corresponding rates when the acquisition method was CNB were respectively: 33 % (45 cases), 47 % (64 cases) 
and 20 % (27 cases). 
Conclusions: Specimens obtained by FNA showed a higher sufficient cellularity rate (70 % vs. 33 %), a lower 
insufficient cellularity rate (15 % vs 47 %) and a reduced low cellularity rate (15 % vs 20 %).  Based on these 
results, FNA appears superior to CNB as an acquiring method for FCA.

Bronx, NY, 3Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 
Disclosures: Mohammad Barouqa: None; Xiaoling Guo: None; Yanhua Wang: None 
Background: Plasma cell leukemia is an aggressive form of multiple myeloma characterized by high levels of 
malignant plasma cells circulating in the peripheral blood. Initially, it is assessed using bone marrow or peripheral 
blood specimens by flow cytometry. Certain antigens are tested as immunophenotypic markers in order to identify 
the malignant plasma cells. Plus, these markers are used as therapeutic targets.  
CD38 is a common marker used to identify the plasma cells, however it is expressed in different cell types, such as 
activated B cells and monocytes. Normal and malignant plasma cells have a high-density CD38 expression 
(CD38++) on their surfaces in addition to CD138 which is another surface marker. The combination of CD38 and 
CD138 are commonly used to diagnose plasma cell neoplasm with additional clonality markers. However, the lack 
of CD138 expression by the malignant plasma cells can be challenging.Besides, aberrant loss of CD138 is 
associated with adverse outcomes. 
Activated monocytes can express CD38, and they carry immunoglobulin Fc receptor (FcR) on their surfaces, which 
can bind to both Kappa and Lambda immunoglobulins. Hence, they add more challenge to precisely gate on the 
malignant plasma cells and detect their clonality. 
Design: We retrospectively analyzed 289 bone marrow and blood specimens tested for plasma cell myeloma from 
January 1st to October 1st, 2020 in order to propose a method to accurately identify CD138 negative (CD138-) and 
CD38 positive (CD38+) malignant plasma cells. Our panel included the following antigens: cytoplasmic 
Kappa/Lambda (cKappa, cLambda), CD19, CD138, CD117, CD56, CD38, CD20 and CD45. The activated dim 
CD38+ monocytes express immunoglobulin FcR, both Kappa and lambda immunoglobulins bound homogeneously 
to the monocytic FcR receptors and served as internal control. Besides, they show diagonal distribution when they 
were gated on the Kappa vs Lambda plot (figure.1 A-B. Monocytes in lime green). The plasma cells were analyzed 
using both CD38 and CD138 in each sample by plotting CD38 versus CD138 cells and gating on the strongly 
(CD38++) plasma cells and dim CD38+ monocytes (figure.2 A) (CD38+ monocytes gated in purple and CD138-/ 
CD38++ gated in green). 
Results: A total of 10 CD138- /CD38+ cases were found (10/289). Seven of them were bone marrow specimens, 
while the remaining three were blood specimens. The CD138-/ CD38+ population showed either kappa or lambda 
restriction (figure.2 B). The binding to Kappa and lambda immunoglobulins to the activated monocytic FcR helped 
 
 
 
 
1145 
establishing an internal control to compare the CD138-/ CD38+ malignant plasma cells and confirmed their clonality 
as shown (figure.2 C-D). 
Figure 1 - 958 
Figure 2 - 958 
Conclusions: This method enhances the accuracy of detecting CD138-/ CD38+ malignant plasma cells by flow 
cytometry, and it serves as an important quality assurance that has substantial implications in further patient 
treatment.

Background: Human papilloma virus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma accounts for up to 25% 
of all head and neck carcinomas, commonly arising from the tonsil and base of the tongue.  The clinical behavior of 
these tumors is distinct from HPV-negative squamous cell carcinoma.  The tumor often presents as metastatic 
disease from an occult primary lesion, and the initial diagnosis is frequently made on cytology specimens.  While 
p16 positivity in surgical specimens is defined as strong and diffuse nuclear staining in 70% of tumor cells, no such 
cutoff has been validated for cytology samples. Accurate interpretation of p16 immunostaining is crucial in guiding 
the management in these patients, and thus, establishing criteria for cytology specimens is important in the 
characterization of these neoplasms. 
Design: We evaluated p16 staining in cytology specimens of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma and compared 
the staining results with that of their paired surgical biopsy or resection specimens. The anatomic pathology 
database was searched for cases of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in patients with known HPV status.  Only 
cases with at least 100 viable tumor cells were included in the study. We evaluated the percentage of p16 positive 
tumor cells in the cytology specimens of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma and compared the staining results 
with the p16 status of the paired surgical biopsy or resection specimens. 
 
 
 
 
1146 
Results: We identified 17 cases whereby paired cytology samples and surgical pathology p16 immunostaining 
results were available. Of these, the majority of patients were male (88%) with an average age of 58 years. Using a 
cutoff of 10% expression in neoplastic cells obtained from cytology samples, p16 immunostaining showed the 
following results: 13 true positive cases, 3 true negative cases, and 1 false negative case. In our sample, a p16 
staining expression threshold of at least 10% on the cytology material resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 
92.9% and 100%, respectively. The positive predictive value for this cutoff was 100% and the negative predictive 
value was 75%. However, when even minimal strong, nuclear expression of p16 on cytology was considered 
positive, the negative predictive value increased to 100%.  
Conclusions: In our laboratory, p16 expression in more than 10% of neoplastic cells in cytology specimens should 
be considered a positive result.  The strong concordance of p16 expression in cytological and surgical pathology 
specimens at a cutoff of 10% cell positivity suggests that this criteria can be used to classify metastatic squamous 
carcinoma as HPV-associated on cytology specimens. Below this 10% cutoff, p16 expression should be interpreted 
with caution.

Background: In order to make high quality medical decisions, it is necessary for patients to have correct and 
comprehensible information concerning not only the treatment options but their diagnosis as well. Recent literature 
shows cancer patients and pathologists are interested in meeting to review diagnostic materials. The attitudes of 
clinicians, key-stakeholders in this interaction, have not yet been assessed.  
Design: Using a snowball recruitment strategy, 59 clinicians from specialties including surgery, internal medicine, 
and hematology oncology were recruited from a tertiary care academic medical center. Clinicians were asked, 
“How interested would you be in having your patient meet with a pathologist to discuss their pathology report and 
see their tissue under the microscope?”. Clinicians ranked their interest on a six-point Likert scale, then expanded 
on specific challenges and benefits they anticipated in a semi-structured interview. Demographic information such 
as age, gender, rank (resident/fellow, junior, mid-career, or senior attending), and specialty was also collected. 
Audio recordings of interviews were transcribed. Using the software NVivo, qualitative thematic analysis identifying 
codes and themes was completed by three members of the study team. Independent coding with group resolution 
was used to develop a codebook, apply codes to all transcripts, and develop themes that represented the 
perceived challenges and benefits.  
Results: A total of 35 clinicians were interviewed with 57% reporting they were either definitely interested or 
interested in having their patients meet with pathologists. Clinicians identified an impact of including patient-
pathologist interactions on patients and the care team, and noted that a subset of patients may gain cognitive and 
emotional benefits from meeting with a pathologist, but also expressed concerns that some patients may find the 
added information emotionally taxing and incomprehensible. Clinicians noted that pathologists may be helpful to the 
care team by adding their unique knowledge, but worried about pathologists’ communication skills and 
fragmentation in patient care.  
Conclusions: Overall, clinicians had a mixed level of interest in their patients meeting with pathologists to review 
their diagnostic material. Clinicians approve of this interaction in only certain situations where patients are highly 
motivated to interact with the pathologist and the pathologist can provide unique value. Clinicians are particularly 
concerned about pathologist communication skills, overwhelming patients, and fragmentation of care. These 
findings and direct clinician collaboration must be incorporated into program development and future research to 
ensure maximal patient benefit.

Background: Lymph node status and lymph node count (LNC) are predictors of colorectal cancer outcome. Under-
sampling of lymph nodes may lead to clinically relevant stage migration. 
Design: Colorectal cancer cases with a synoptic report, accessioned 2011-2017 at a regional laboratory, were 
extracted. LNC, number of positive lymph nodes (PLNC) and ‘y’ (staging) prefix (YS) were tabulated by pathologist 
using custom software. Statistical analyses were done with LibreCalc, R and SAS. 
Results: The cohort had 1,694 CRC resections. Twenty-two pathologists interpreted >25 cases (range: 29-253) 
each and collectively saw 1,519 cases. After cases with zero lymph nodes/unavailable data were purged, 1,497 
cases remained; these had a total of 32,908 lymph nodes of which 1,883 were positive. 281 of 1,497 cases had a 
‘y’ prefix. The group of 22 pathologists’ median LNC/case was 19.5 (range: 13.5-27.0), and the mean PLNC per 
case was 1.3 (range: 0.7-3.1). Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests showed that there were differences in LNC (p<0.001) 
and PLNC (p=0.033) among pathologists. T-tests showed that mean LNC (p<0.001) differed between YS groups; 
however, mean PLNC (p=0.084) did not show this association. 106 of 1497 cases had less than the 12 LNC target; 
logistic regression analysis revealed that there was a strong association between LNC target category and 
pathologist (p<0.005). 
Conclusions: Positive lymph node call rate has a fair consistency in the laboratory. Standardized criteria for lymph 
node counting should be developed, and synoptic report data could be used, in the context of a next generation 
quality process, to facilitate adoption.

Background: Lung and Digestive system represent the most frequent occurrence sites for neuroendocrine 
neoplasms (NENs). NEN clinical outcome can be predicted by the integrated evaluation of morphology and 
proliferation index, allowing NENs distinction into well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (WD-NET) and poorly 
differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (PD-NEC). We recently published four studies addressed to PD-NECs in 
order to identify PD-NECs subgroups with better prognosis and/or to predict their therapy outcome. 
Design: A pooled analysis of our four retrospective studies (3 on digestive [PMID: 26943788; 29592868; 
31557757] and 1 on lung NENs [PMID: 32365350]) was performed to evaluate for PD-NEC: i) Best Ki-67 cut-off in 
predicting Overall Survival (OS); ii) OS according to cancer primary site iii) best common predictive model using 
 
 
 
 
1148 
different variable selection methods in Cox proportional hazards model (Cox) and machine learning Random 
Survival Forest (RSF). 
Results: Overall, 422 PDNECs were analyzed distributed in colorectal (n = 156, 37%), lung (n = 111, 26.3%), 
gastroesophageal (n = 83, 19.7%), pancreas (n = 42, 10%), ileum-cecum-duodenum (n = 18, 4.2%) and 
gallbladder/biliary (n = 12, 2.8%). Pure neuroendocrine morphology (n = 227, 53.8%) was slightly more represented 
than combined (n = 195, 46.2%) although is more frequent in colorectal (59%), gastroesophageal (53%) and 
gallbladder/biliary (83.3%) compared to lung (31.5%) and pancreas (33.3%). Interestingly, all PDNEC in ileum-
cecum-duodenum had pure morphology. Ki-67 at 55% was confirmed as the best value in predicting OS. Colorectal 
and gastroesophageal PD-NEC showed worse OS than pancreatic and lung. The most predictive Cox model 
included Ki67 (HR 1.03 - CI95% 1.03-1.04), Morphology (Pure vs Combined - HR 1.44 - CI95% 1.16-1.78), Stage 
III-IV (HR 1.47 - CI 95% 1.06-2.04) and Age (HR 1.01 - CI 95% 1.00-1.02). In Pancreas PD-NEC HR decreased by 
0.58 (CI 95% 0.40-0.83) if compared to colorectal PD-NEC. RSF, which is dependent on the complete combination 
of all risk factors, confirmed that Ki-67 was the most relevant predictor followed by morphology, stage and site. The 
predicted response for survival at 1 or 3 years of the forest showed decreasing survival with increasing Ki-67, pure 
morphology, stage III-IV, and colorectal and gastroesophageal NEC disease. Furthermore, patients with Ki-67<55% 
and combined morphology had better survival than those with pure morphology. Morphology became irrelevant in 
NENs when Ki-67 resulted ≥ 55%. RSF had the best predictive accuracy (AUC > 80) compare to other models 
computed at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months specific time points. 
Conclusions: The present pooled analysis showed that most predictive parameters to predict OS for PD-NEC 
patients included Ki67, Morphology, Stage and Site. RSF outperformed all other models in OS prediction 
performance.

Background: The ACOSOG Z0011 (Z0011) trial demonstrated omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) 
was non-inferior to sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) in breast conserving surgery (BCS) with cT1-2 invasive 
breast carcinoma (IBC), no palpable adenopathy, and 1-2 sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) with metastasis. A decade 
after, we evaluate our institution’s intraoperative consultation (IOF) and ALND practices. 
Design: Patients (pts) treated in our hospital system in 2019 meeting Z0011 inclusion (cT1-2N0M0, undergoing 
BCS) and exclusion criteria (neoadjuvant therapy, cT3/4, cTis) were identified. 
Results: Data were recorded in Table 1: 455 pts were included in the study (median age 66 years). Subtypes 
included 90% ER/PR-positive, 0.7% HER2-positive and 8.2%-triple negative IBC. Overall, ALND was performed in 
14/376 with SNLD. 8/14 pts had SLND IOF while 4/14 had disease identified on PS; 2/14 pts underwent ALND 
without prior pathologic evaluation PS/IOF of lymph nodes (LN). Of the 14 pts with ALND, 4 had ≥3 positive LN, 3/4 
had ≥3 positive SLND IOF, 3/4 had additional positive LN within the ALND and 2/4 upstaged the pN from pN1 to 
pN2. 10 pts with ALND had <3 positive LN. In 6/10, macrometastatic disease was identified on SLND IOF. While 
additional metastatic disease was identified in 5/10, the pN assignment was not affected. 7/10 ALND were 
performed by breast surgeons, and 2 surgeons were overrepresented. Overall, only 2/14 pts had an upstaged pN 
assignment, all with ≥3 positive SNLD on IOF. All pts with ALND had ER-positive IBC, while 21% were HER2-
amplified, 79% ductal, 14% mixed ductal/lobular, and 7% lobular. 
Statistically significant associations with ALND (p<0.05) were identified with ENE, age >70, and pT1 vs pT2 but not 
with cT1 vs cT2, morphologic type, Nottingham grade, or receptor expression. 
In the 441 pts who did not undergo ALND, 3 had ≥3 positive SLND. One of these pts had only isolated tumor cells 
while the other opted for axillary radiation. No reason to omit ALND was disclosed for the third pt.

Conclusions: Our data shows the necessity for ALND is low (3.7%) in the setting of BCS with cT1-T2N0M0 
disease, and supports the need for ALND only in cT1-2N0M0 invasive mammary carcinomas with ≥3 positive 
SLND, as seen with Z0011 outcomes. Most importantly, it also shows SLND IOF does not guide management and 
can be completely abandoned in this cohort, saving time, resources, improving workflow, and ultimately providing 
better care for our patients.

964    How Reproducible Must a Test Be to Maintain Clinical Accuracy? Application to Oncology 
Biomarkers Such as PD-L1 
Kenneth Emancipator, Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ 
Disclosures: Kenneth Emancipator: Employee, Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., 
Kenilworth, NJ, USA; Stock Ownership, Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA; Stock Ownership, Bayer AG; Stock 
Ownership, Johnson & Johnson; Stock Ownership, Bristol Myers Squibb (spouse) 
Background: Oncology tests with established clinical accuracy such as those for detecting PD-L1 have receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves with areas under the curves (AUCs) of 0.62-0.74. ROC curves can reflect 
analytical error, including reproducibility, as well as biologic factors, but standards for qualitative reproducibility 
have not been justified based on the need for clinical accuracy. This creates angst among some practicing 
pathologists, who may believe that some tests, such as those for PD-L1, can be performed only by a few experts 
proficient at scoring such tests. Herein, we describe a stochastic model which relates analytical error and 
reproducibility to clinical accuracy. 
Design: The symmetric case of the well-known binormal distribution was the starting point of the model. The novel 
aspect is partitioning error into analytical and biological components based on assumptions derived from the 
Cotlove criterion that analytical error should be at most half of biological error. The model assumed the following: 
(1) a normal distribution of true biomarker values in the “disease” group had a mean of +1; (2) a normal distribution 
of true biomarker values in the “no disease” group had a mean of –1; (3) both distributions had the same standard 
deviation; (4) normal distribution of assay error; and (5) assay cutoff was correctly set at 0. Explicit mathematical 
solutions were derived, then verified by Monte Carlo analyses. Disease prevalence did not affect calculations. 
Results: ROC curves for various values of total error are shown in the Figure. Reproducibility is presented in 
the Table. The model demonstrated that tests with analytical error that conform to the classic Cotlove criterion 
achieved ROC curves with AUCs of 0.68-0.76 and Youden Indices of 0.26-0.38 yet had overall agreement for 
duplicate measurements of only 80%-82%. Analytically accurate agreement was only 75%-78% and clinically 
accurate agreement only 50%-60%. Monte Carlo analyses verify these explicit calculations. 
Figure 1 - 964 
Figure 2 - 964 
 
 
 
 
1151 
Conclusions: Tests may have reasonable clinical accuracy despite having reproducibility of <85%. Imperfect 
assays can substantially improve medical decision making. The findings must be interpreted with caution due to the 
binormal assumptions, but such assumptions are often useful as a first approximation. Practicing pathologists 
should feel comfortable performing semi-quantitative assays shown to have a strong biological association with 
clinical outcome.

Background: Tissue loss on immunohistochemically stained slides is frustrating and may lead to diagnostic 
uncertainty and/or unresolved predictive biomarker status. Special positively charged or adhesive slides are 
marketed specifically for use with IHC. We hypothesized that tissue loss would vary among these slide brands. We 
also hypothesized that total assay conditions (including antigen retrieval) would influence results. We used digital 
image analysis of whole slide images of immunohistochemically stained slides to quantify cell loss among slide 
brands and laboratories. 
Design: A cell culture microarray block was constructed from 39 well-fixed T-47D cell culture pellets. The 
microarray was sectioned onto 15 adhesive slide brands, with 9 laboratories performing their own estrogen receptor 
assay on each of these 15 slides. Slides were returned to a central laboratory for whole slide imaging with an 
Aperio AT2 scanner at 20x and QuPath quantitation. Counts were normalized to the average number of cells 
present in bracketing H&E sections. In a second round, an additional 5 breast cancer cores selected based on the 
H&E impression of delayed or incomplete fixation were arrayed, with laboratories performing Ki-67 IHC on 5 of the 
slide brands (selected from the initial 15).  
Results: In round 1, marked differences in cell culture pellet retention were observed between laboratories (range: 
59%-85% of cells), while no slide brand showed superior retention (Figure 1). In round 2, though, there were 
dramatic retention differences between slide brands for the breast cancer tissue cores (range: 13%-62%)  
(Figure 2).

Figure 2 - 965 
 
Conclusions: A wide selection of instruments and assay conditions were represented in this study. The inclusion 
of cell culture material allowed precise measurements of large numbers of individual cells. Somewhat surprisingly, 
there was no significant difference in cell culture pellet adhesion across the 15 slide brands examined. However, 
retention did vary significantly among laboratories, consistent with differences in “harshness” among assays. In 
contrast, in round 2, 5 slides brands showed marked and consistent differences in adhesive performance in breast 
cancer tissues selected based on the impression of poor fixation. These findings suggest that the choice of slide 
brand may be an important consideration for tissue adhesion in some situations. We are planning a follow up study 
to specifically address the impact of delayed, under-, and overfixed tissues on IHC slide adhesion.

Analysis of Quality Issues in the Histology Laboratory

Disclosures: Li Ge: None; Schaundra Walton: None; Jennifer Gordetsky: None; Florencia Jalikis: None 
Background: Consistent, high quality histology is critical for the evaluation of surgical pathology specimens and 
ensuring an accurate diagnosis. Our quality assurance (QA) program monitors the characteristics of histologic 
slides. Issues that arise are documented and addressed on a weekly basis according to the highest standards. We 
present our experience with commonly encountered issues in histology quality and ways to prevent them. 
Design: We reviewed the data from our histology QA program from June to December 2019 including total number 
of blocks per month, average number of blocks per work day, total number of slides prepared, and number of slides 
with quality issues. Histologic quality markers included incomplete sections, inappropriate hematoxylin and eosin 
staining, Loss of nuclear detail (nuclear meltdown), and tissue broken up during cutting (chatter). 
Results: The number of blocks processed per month by the histology lab ranged from 21,906 to 25,480 (mean: 
24,215). The number of total slides prepared per month ranged from 41,889 to 49,162 (mean: 46,521). The most 
common quality issue was incomplete sections, with a monthly average of 127 slides requiring a recut for 
diagnosis, comprising 0.3% of the total number of slides per month and 11% of the total number of blocks per 
workday (Table 1). Other histologic quality issues included chatter (monthly average: 12), nuclear meltdown 
(monthly average: 4), and overstaining (monthly average: 1). 
Incomplete sectioning can be caused by improper embedding, cutting too shallow, or rough and rapid course 
facing, which leads to chunks of tissue popping out of block. 
Common causes of chatter include poor fixation, loose or dull microtomy blades, and improper blade clearance 
angles in microtomy. We have found cold blocks and dehydrated tissue are also associated with chatter. In our 
experience, gastrointestinal biopsies were most susceptible to this artifact. 
Nuclear meltdown is an overall rare problem but can have disastrous results for histologic quality. Inappropriate 
fixation is a major cause of nuclear meltdown and can be seen in specimens with less than 6 hours of fixation prior 
to processing or in sections of tissue that are very thick. Inappropriately mixing of reagents in the processor can 
also lead to this phenomenon. 
We found that dark/over-staining was often caused by thick sections. Reducing the thickness of sections to 3 
microns for GI biopsies and ensuring complete draining of water from the slides prior to staining was helpful in 
resolving this issue (Table 2).

Conclusions: Histologic quality is a crucial part of patient care. There are common issues affecting histologic 
characteristics that can be tracked, corrected, and prevented. A team approach, including input from pathologists, 
histology technicians, and gross room managers, should be taken to ensure excellent histologic quality in anatomic 
pathology.

Background: Patients now have access to their medical records via online patient portals. However, many 
institutions have opted to delay access to pathology reports by up to two weeks due to their sensitive and highly 
technical nature. In July 2020, The Ottawa Hospital (TOH) started to provide patients with immediate access to 
 
 
 
 
1155 
their pathology report via the MyChart online portal. This decision was made after extensive consultation with focus 
groups and the hospital’s Patient and Family Advisory Council. Patients were also provided with a link to 
MyPathologyReport (www.MyPathologyReport.ca), an online patient-centered pathology education resource. The 
purpose of this study was to compare the number of patients arriving at MyPathologyReport directly from MyChart 
before and after the initiation of immediate access. 
Design: We compared the number of patients arriving at MyPathologyReport directly from MyChart for three 
months leading up to (April 20 – July 21, 2020) and three months following (July 22 – October 25, 2020) the 
initiation of immediate access. Anonymous user information was collected by Google Analytics. No personal 
identifying information was collected at any time nor did MyPathologyReport have access to the patient’s electronic 
medical record. 
Results: The number of patients arriving at MyPathologyReport directly from MyChart increased from 5,487 for the 
three months leading up to the initiation of immediate access to 8,383 after the change (an increase of 53%). The 
most commonly accessed articles were similar in both groups. Specifically, introductory articles describing the 
interpretation of COVID-19 test results, pap smears, and bone marrow biopsies were the top three most read 
articles in both groups. Articles describing invasive ductal carcinoma, prostatic adenocarcinoma, lung 
adenocarcinoma, and ductal carcinoma in situ were also in the top ten most read articles for both groups. There 
was no difference between the two groups in the overall time spent on the site. 
Conclusions: Patients given immediate access to their pathology reports were more likely to visit a patient-
centered pathology education resource to learn more about their report. Providing a direct link from online patient 
portals to such resources allows patients to obtain reliable and trusted information about their results. Whether this 
change leads to improved patient experience has yet to be determined.

Background: The primary means of pathologist-clinician crosstalk is the pathology report. However, report 
formatting varies among pathologists and often includes esoteric histologic descriptions, making it difficult for 
clinicians to extract pertinent information to help guide treatment. Therefore, there is a need to optimize pathology 
reporting to include relevant and concise microscopic descriptions and immunohistochemical (IHC) profiles while 
also maintaining readability. 
Design: To address clarity of communication of pathology reports with clinicians as part of a quality improvement 
project, a 10 question survey was provided to members of GI clinical care teams throughout the university’s health 
system. Questions assessed level of experience, time spent reading a pathology report, and the importance of 
report components including gross, microscopic, and IHC descriptions as well as verbiage. An open response 
question was also included. 
Results: 49 clinical team members responded to the survey (see table 1). The free response question yielded 44% 
comments about Cerner/EPIC interface formatting issues including unusual characters, unusual formatting of 
sentences, and text taking up many more rows than they should. Additional suggestions included keeping pertinent 
information in the diagnostic line, such as Metavir and NAFLD activity scores, and improving clarity about follow-up 
addendum reports (such as for reflex testing in cancer diagnosis).

Conclusions: Our survey results demonstrate that the clinical team values each component of the pathology report 
(gross, microscopic descriptions, and IHC data) for best patient care. Verbiage used in the final diagnostic line is of 
paramount importance. Clinicians unanimously value verbal communication about pathology reports, especially in 
complex cases. Based on these survey results, we are attempting to make several changes to our current reporting 
system as follows: 
1. To prevent CERNER/EPIC formatting errors, reduce the font size of IHC disclaimer and provide a separate 
disclaimer section instead of embedding in the main body of the report 
2. Separately uploading reports to the EPIC media tab as PDFs for better readability 
3. Avoid unnecessary addendums and notes, if possible 
 
 
 
 
1157 
4. Design expedites, which create auto-populated notes stating that an addendum is pending which should be 
mentioned in the final diagnosis 
5. Future plan to move to EPIC beaker 
We conclude that clear verbiage and communication are the bridge between the pathologist and the target 
audience and we can adjust our reporting style to enhance this symbiosis.

Background: The role of quality improvement and analysis of errors in anatomic pathology is well established, and 
there is a variation in assessing these incidents. Majority efforts are focused on categorizing these incidents; 
however, little data exists on appropriate actions and management of these events. We share our experience of 
adopting an alternate innovative Performance Improvement (PI) Filter guiding us to manage occurring adverse 
events in our anatomic pathology laboratory.  
Design: Our pathology department recently adopted a PI Filter (see figure), in congruent with a standardized 
approach followed by Risk Management of our Health System. All adverse events (2018 onwards) were submitted 
to the pathology PI Coordinator by providers (including pathologists). An in-depth analysis of these cases was 
performed by the Peer Review Screen Team (Peer Review Chair and Experts, PI Coordinator and Risk 
Management), and using the Filter, cases were characterized in 1 or more of the 5 established categories. 
Results: 122 adverse events were scrutinized, 34 events self-referred, 61 events referred by another pathologist, 
and 26 events were referred by providers. 41 were pre-sign-out events, 56 were events at sign-out and 23 were 
post-sign-out events. Notably, a subset of adverse events qualified for more than one category. There were 8 
instances of categorization as Behavioral Issue, 31 instances of Clinical Learning Opportunity, 26 instances of 
System Process Improvement Needed, 9 instances of Question of Provider Skill or Lapse in Judgement and 61 
instances of No Review Necessary (see table). In response to these findings, 9 cases were referred to formal Peer 
Review, 16 Mortality and Morbidity Conferences were organized, there were 26 alerts to improve processes, and 
opportunities to address and promote a targeted culture of safety and communication were present.

Conclusions: The PI Filter adopted has proven to be effective in dissecting and objectively assessing adverse 
events in anatomic pathology. In addition to identifying cases with potential harm for peer-review; cases with no 
potential harm provided ample opportunities for clinical learning, clinical practice standardization, systems process 
improvement, conferences, and trainee education as well as addressing behavioral issues in a safe environment. 
We highly recommend pathology practices to implement this PI Tool in their practice. 
 
970    Success Could Be Automated or Through Doing Less: Our Experience on Nucleic Acid 
Extraction For COVID-19 Tests

Disclosures: Krishna Iyer: None; Monica Talmor: None; Chen Liu: None; Pei Hui: None; Minghao Zhong: None 
Background: The molecular diagnostics are currently highly complex. One of contributors to this complexity 
include the numerous steps involved in material preparation. At the beginning of COVID19 pandemic, we were 
forced to use labor-intensive manual processing for nucleic acid (NA) extraction, because of national wide supply 
chain disruption. Additionally, we were suffering from staff shortage and fatigue. Later on, we solved these 
problems by implementation of a KingFisher automated NA extraction instrument. We also took advantage of 
SalivaDirectTM, a rapid testing method, developed in house for emergency use authorization. This method is 
intended to replace our current NA extraction methods, using simpler proteinase K preparation and heat treatment 
methods. In this study, we analyzed the failure rate of NA extraction from different these various approaches.   
Design: The NA extraction failure was determined by invalid MS2 reporter gene values, a processing control used 
by the ThermoFisher TaqPath COVID-19 test. We compared failure rates before and after implementation of 
KingFisher. SalivaDirect does not use a processing control; rather it uses a primer/probe set for RNaseP, an 
 
 
 
 
1159 
internal control to determine if enough sample was collected. The internal control failure indicates either problems 
with NA extraction and/or sampling. A test is repeated when a sample fails the internal control. If 2nd test still fail, 
this indicates a sampling error.  
Results: The failure rates (i.e invalid MS2 reporting)  due to  manual NA extraction were collected for a period of 
time before and after implementation of the KingFisher automatic method. The average NA extraction failure rate 
was ~5.9% for the manual method vs 1.0% for the Kingfisher extraction method . We also experienced significant 
between and within personnel variation in NA extraction , whereas KingFisher was more consistent. The most 
failure rates occurred at early phase implementation and most likely was due to technical and specimen handling 
errors. For SalivaDirect, the failed tests were attributed to inadequate sample and not NA extraction failure. 
Conclusions: Our data demonstrated that implementation of automation or simplification of labor-intensive 
process resulted in improvements in extraction failure and more consistent test results, which translated to 
improved turn-around time, reduced reagent cost and increased efficiency without compromising test quality.

Disclosures: Kimberly Johnson: None; Julie Jorns: None 
Background: Patients now have access to their medical record through online patient portals. However, most 
pathology reports are designed to communicate to clinical providers, not patients. We sought to understand how 
patients utilize pathology reports, while raising awareness to the availability of pathology reports and other results 
via the online patient portal. 
Design: Surveys were administered exclusively in breast clinics and any patient that had a pathology report 
generated after 03/2018 (the first month reports were made available to patients online) and scheduled for an 
appointment on days of administration was eligible. However, patients could decline to participate and were asked 
to complete the survey only once. Ideally, nursing staff filled in four (4) administrative data points (age, benign vs 
malignant diagnosis, 1st vs later visit and Distress Tool Score). Patients answered all other questions. Surveys 
contained no identifying information, and all (partially or fully) completed surveys were collected and stored in a 
secure location for later batch pick-up and analysis (Figure 1). 
Results: 149 surveys were received. All patients answered main questions 1 and 2; however, only 56 (37.6%) had 
administrative data. Patient responses were stratified by their answers to the first question (Figure 2). 
Question 2 responses showed most participants (123/149; 82.5%) selected “Yes they have or plan to review their 
pathology reports,” with 26 (17.4%) selecting “No I do not plan to review report.” Answering “Yes” to this question 
was significantly associated with younger patient age (mean 54.5 vs 61.8 years) (p=.035). Reasons for use and 
lack of use were varied (Table 1). 
Most (118/149; 79.2%) respondents indicated that they believe that their pathology report allows them to better 
understand their diagnosis.

Conclusions: Although responses varied, many patients felt that having access to their pathology reports was 
beneficial, which showed an association with younger age. For some patients, this benefit may extend to 
development of pathology consultation services where patients can discuss their pathology reports and/or view 
slides with a pathologist.

972    Use of Pathology Data to Evaluate Impact of COVID on Stage at Presentation for 
Genitourinary Malignancies

Disclosures :Steven Johnson: None; Hung-Jui Tan: None; Sara Wobker: None 
Background: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is estimated that nearly one-third of 
Americans have delayed routine medical care and 12% have delayed urgent or emergent care during the COVID 
pandemic. The COVID and Cancer Research Network (CCRN) has shown significant decreases in cancer-specific 
care during this time. Additionally, many hospital systems halted elective surgeries and procedures, further limiting 
access to screening and early interventions for cancer. AJCC pathologic T stage may provide early insight into 
COVID-related trends in surgical utilization and stage at presentation. 
Design: In this retrospective review of cancer cases, we sought to characterize trends in stage at presentation 
between similar time periods relevant to the COVID pandemic (Mar 1 - Oct 28) in 2018, 2019 and 2020. We 
performed a search of our laboratory information system for nephrectomies performed with a final diagnosis of 
renal cell carcinoma. We chose renal cell carcinoma due to the fact that surgery is the primary treatment and 
neoadjuvant treatment is not commonly used in this setting. The following data were abstracted for the cases: date 
of surgery, patient sex, age, specimen type (partial versus total/radical nephrectomy), histologic diagnosis, tumor 
size, margin status, and final pathologic stage. Ongoing data collection will extend the time period evaluated and 
include other GU malignancies. 
Results: 511 nephrectomies were performed over the search period, 328 of which had an RCC diagnosis (2018 
n=104, 2019 n=121, 2020 n=103). There was no significant difference in total case volume during these time 
periods each year. In addition, no significant differences were seen in total rates of pT1-2 for 2018, 2019, and 2020, 
respectively (67.3%, 78.5%, 72.8%) and pT3-4 cancers (32.7%, 21.5%, 27.2%). However, when analyzed by 
individual months (Figure 1), there was a significant increase in the proportion of pT3-4 cancers seen in Sep-Oct 
2020 (11/28, 39%) when compared to those months in 2018 and 2019, collectively (7/39, 18%; p = 0.026 by 
Fisher's exact test). 
Figure 1 - 972 
 
 
 
 
 
1162 
Conclusions: While surgical volumes remained stable over the 3 year period, an increase in the proportion of high 
stage cancers during Sep-Oct 2020 was seen when compared to similar periods in 2018 and 2019. This may 
indicate a lagging indicator of more advanced disease presentation that will become more pronounced over time. 
The potential negative consequences of detection and treatment delays in cancer due to COVID will become 
evident over time, with likely impacts on recurrence and mortality rates. Secondary databases may be delayed in 
their ability to detect deleterious effects of decreased cancer care during COVID, and pathology data provide real-
time indicators of these emerging trends. 
 
973    Does Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE) or Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-

Disclosures: David Kim: None; Glorimar Rivera Colon: None; Elena Lucas: None; Devin Sanders: None 
Background: An adequate specimen is imperative for an accurate diagnosis of thyroid nodules sampled by FNA. 
However, a wide range of adequacy rates (3-34%) have been reported across various institutions. Although ROSE 
had historically been employed for all ultrasound guided thyroid FNAs at our 870 bed tertiary care hospital, limited 
resources and increasing time constraints prompted a decision to forego ROSE for first time evaluation. We sought 
to determine how replacement of ROSE with a standard “three passes, no check” procedure affects specimen 
adequacy rate. We also attempted to determine if TI-RADS score affects specimen adequacy rate. 
Design: A search of ultrasound guided thyroid FNAs performed from March to December 2019 yielded 377 
nodules. 190 thyroid nodules were sampled with ROSE. 187 nodules were sampled without ROSE. Adequacy was 
defined by The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology. We compared adequacy rates of FNAs 
performed with ROSE to FNAs performed without ROSE. We also compared adequacy rates of thyroid nodules, 
grouped by TI-RADS scores. All rates were compared using the chi-square test. 
Results: Of the 190 nodules evaluated with ROSE, the FNA was inadequate in 27 cases (adequacy rate 85.8%). 
The average number of passes with ROSE was 3.7 passes. Of the 187 nodules evaluated without ROSE, the FNA 
was inadequate in 31 nodules (adequacy rate 83.4%). The average number of passes without ROSE was 3.2 
passes. The difference in adequacy with ROSE and without ROSE was not statistically significant (p-value: 0.52). 
TI-RADS scores (3: mildly suspicious, 4: moderately suspicious, and 5: highly suspicious) did not have a bearing on 
adequacy regardless of whether or not ROSE was employed (p-value: 0.55), see table 1. Higher TI-RADS scores 
correlated with higher risk of malignancy and with higher Bethesda categories. Every surgical excision (n=25) of the 
32 thyroid nodules diagnosed as Bethesda category V (suspicious for malignancy) and VI (malignant) revealed a 
thyroid malignancy.

Conclusions: In a busy setting with limited resources, it is reasonable to forego ROSE if adequacy rates are high. 
Three passes with proper technique appears to provide acceptable adequacy rates. Higher TI-RADS scores should 
not necessarily prompt the radiologist to take additional passes. Reassessment of rates should regularly take place 
to ensure proper patient care.

974    A College of American Pathologists (CAP) Immunohistochemistry Survey Identifies Lack 
of Interchangeability of Ki-67 Immunohistochemistry Assays

IL, 3University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics, Iowa City, IA 
Disclosures: Dylan Miller: None; Rhona Souers: None; Andrew Bellizzi: None 
Background: Ki-67 immunohistochemistry (IHC) is widely utilized in surgical pathology for the purpose of grading 
(e.g., neuroendocrine tumors) and as a prognostic marker (in many tumor types). Recent breast cancer clinical 
trials have used the Ki-67 proliferation index (PI) to assign patients to different treatment arms. While the MIB-1 
clone has a long track record, alternative clones are increasingly utilized. Given Ki-67's emerging role as a 
predictive marker, interassay comparisons and a proficiency testing program are sorely needed. 
Design: Ki-67 was challenged as part of the 2020 CAP PM5 (rotating markers) IHC survey--distributed to 
participants as a 10 core tissue microarray (TMA) consisting of 5 breast cancers and 5 neuroendocrine epithelial 
neoplasms selected to challenge various diagnostic and clinically relevant thresholds (i.e., 15% for breast; 3%, 
20%, and 55% for neuroendocrine). Laboratories were asked to report a Ki-67 PI for each core. In addition, data 
were collected on antibody formulation, clone, staining method, testing platform, antigen retrieval pH, primary 
antibody incubation time, detection system, and use of image analysis.  
Ki-67 PI distribution differences for these testing parameters (minimum group size=8 laboratories) were assessed 
with Kruskal-Wallis or Wilcoxon rank sum tests on a core-by-core basis. The relationship between clone and 
platform was assessed with a phi coefficient. Given the inherent repeated measures structure of the 10-core TMA, 
subsequent to univariate testing, a generalized linear mixed effects repeated measures analysis (GLM) was fit for 
clone 30-9 vs MIB-1 and the interaction between core and clone. Analyses were performed with SAS 9.4 and 
assessed at a significance level of 0.05.  
Results: Data from 85 laboratories showed significant KI-67 PI differences for clone and platform on univariate 
analyses, though these parameters were highly correlated (Φ=0.97). All other parameters were not significant 
(p>0.05), with the exception of antigen retrieval pH in 3 cores. For the GLM, 718 Ki-67 PIs from 72 laboratories, 
including 39 using clone 30-9 and 33 using MIB-1, were analyzed; the interaction term F statistic is 7.07 (p<0.01), 
indicating significant clone-specific differences within different cores (with the difference varying core-by-core). Ki-
67 PI distributions by core and clone and detailed testing practice data are presented in the Figure and Table.

Conclusions: Ki-67 assays are not interchangeable, with clone and platform (which is highly correlated with clone) 
significantly influencing the PI. In 2021 the CAP IHC Committee will launch a standalone Ki-67 survey with two 
mailings a year. The 10-core TMA will be composed of calibrated cell line mixtures representing a range of PIs. 
Apparent lack of interchangeability of Ki-67 assays is distressing given the marker's emerging use as a predictive 
marker and demands industry and regulatory body attention.

Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic shift in volumes and practice patterns for 
hospitals around the globe. Using granular data, we analyzed its effect on the cytopathology subspecialty practice 
in a tertiary academic hospital-based setting. 
Design: Overall specimen volume was analyzed for the cytology practice for 2019 and year-to-date (YTD) for 2020. 
Variables such as patient population, intake area, and financial accounts were included in the analysis when 
comparing years 2019 and 2020. The data was further subdivided into gynecological specimens, non-gynecological 
cytology, and fine-needle aspirate (FNA) specimens. Institutional and state/national guidelines as well as stimulus 
strategies to ease the effect of the pandemic were also taken into account. 
Results: The overall specimens (Figure 1) decreased by 28% in March 2020 (p < 0.00001, chi-square), with a 
continuing decline in April (66% decrease YoY, p < 0.00001, chi-square), beginning of recovery in May and return 
to baseline within the month of June 2020. The year-to-date total specimen intake (January – September 2020) is 
9.72% lower than in 2019, with a final projected volume deficit of 22.79% assuming a steady state during October – 
December 2020. 
The subdivided specimen populations showed a similar trend with a few notable differences. The gynecologic 
specimen (Figure 2A) average for 2020 despite the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic is higher than 2019 with a 
final projected volume of +4.97%. This could in part be represented by addition of a new intake account in January 
2020; also reflected in the higher volume of specimens in February 2020 compared to February 2019 (p = 
0.001321, chi-square). The non-gynecologic specimens (Figure 2B) showed a similar recovery trend, however, 
demonstrating consistently lower volumes from June through September 2020, compared to similar duration in 
2019. FNA specimens (Figure 2C) showed a marginally delayed recovery with return to baseline in July 2020 
compared to June 2020 for the remaining services.

Figure 2 - 975 
 
Conclusions: Overall, our study informs policy-making. Our data shows a sharp and significant decrease in patient 
volume, mostly due to stringent guidelines set by the state and national governments and our institution in response 
to the pandemic. The recovery curve was V-shaped; essentially the most ideal economic response to a downturn. 
The recovery efforts were also helped by stimulus measures such as the HSS provider relief CARES act, avoiding 
any potential loss of employees and a quick return to full workload and workforce.

Background: SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) infection is thought to be pro-thrombotic, but limited data exists on its effect on 
placental pathology.  There is also limited data on best practices for SC2 screening in pregnant women. This 
study sought to further elucidate placental features seen with SC2 infection and support a SC2 testing strategy. 
Design: A retrospective review of all placentas with pathology evaluation from 1/2020 to 7/2020 was performed, 
using placentas evaluated from 1/2019-7/2019 as a control group. Placentas from 2020 were divided into a positive 
cohort of patients with a positive SC2 test during pregnancy and an untested cohort consisting of placentas 
delivered to women not tested for SC2. Diagnoses of decidual vasculopathy (DV), intervillous thrombi 
 
 
 
 
1167 
(IT), chorangiosis/chorangioma (CG), massive perivillous fibrin deposition (MPVFD), avascular villi (AV) and 
infarction (IF) were noted, as well as clinical diagnoses of pre-eclampsia (PE) or hypertension (HTN). Personnel 
performing and indications for placental pathology evaluation were static. Chi-squared test was used 
to compare patient populations and p-value was set at <0.05.   
Results: There was no difference in proportion of patients with PE from 2019 (n=370) to 2020 (n=453) (17% vs 
21%, p=0.11) and more patients had HTN in 2019 than 2020 (29% vs 21%, p=0.01). Of placentas from the positive 
cohort (n=32), 28% had DV, 6% had IT, 0% had MPVFD, 0% had CG, 0% had AV, and 9% had IF. The untested 
cohort of placentas (n=217) had a higher rate of DV (26% vs 13%, p<0.05) and MPFVD (2% vs 0%, p=0.003) than 
the 2019 group and the same rate of DV (26% vs 28%, p=0.82) and MPVFD (2% vs 0%, p=0.70) as the positive 
group. The 2020 untested cohort had the same rate of IT, CG, AV and IF compared to the control group (12% vs 
11%, p=0.37), (1% vs 1%, p=0.59), (0% vs 3%, p=0.05), (14% vs 16%, p=0.39) and compared to the positive group 
(12% vs 6%, p=0.37), (0% vs 0%, p=0.70), (1% vs 0%, p=0.59), (14% vs 9%, p=0.49).   
Conclusions: Increases in DV and MPVFD seen without increases in PE or HTN support the possibility 
that SC2 infections were missed when limited testing was performed and supports universal testing of pregnant 
women. Other features evaluated are either seen rarely or are non-specific which may explain lack of statistical 
significance in our study. Further study, including optimal timing for universal SC2 testing and if clinical sequelae of 
DV seen with SC2 recur in future pregnancies as they do when DV is associated with PE, should be considered.

Background: Cytology-histology correlation (CHC) is the gold standard for quality assurance in cytology 
laboratories. CHC can prevent under or over treatment of patients and serves as an educational tool 
for the personnel in cytology laboratories. If cervical pap smears (CP) and cervical biopsies (CB) are performed at 
different institutions, these benefits may be lost.  
Design: All CB performed at our institution from 1/1/2019 to 12/31/2019 with an adequate CP performed in the six 
months prior to the CB were included in this retrospective review. We compared CHC for CP and CB performed at 
a single institution compared to CHC for CP and CB performed at different institutions, with a focus on proportion of 
overcalls on CP, as those are the most challenging discrepant CHC to manage clinically. We used the America 
Society of Cytology guidelines for our discrepancy assessment grid. Chi-squared test was used to compare 
proportions of populations. P-value was set at <0.05.  
Results: Of the 305 CB in our study population, 69 had CP performed at our institution and 236 had CP performed 
at an outside institution. CHC for CB and CP performed at a single institution had statistically significantly less 
disagreement than for those performed at different institutions (p<0.05). Further, CB and CP performed at as single 
institution had statistically significantly fewer overcalls than CB and CP performed at different 
institutions (p<0.05) (table 1).

Conclusions: This study further supports the use of CHC and encourages performance of CP and CB as the same 
institution.  If performing CP and CB at the same institution is not feasible, prospective consultation review of CP by 
institution performing CB should be strongly considered. Further study, including evaluation of reason for 
 
 
 
 
1168 
discrepancy in discordant cases may be considered to better elucidate reasons for better CHC agreement when CP 
and CB are performed at the same institution.  
 
978    Do Gross and Microscopic Pathology Findings Support the Existence of a Subconscious 
Bias in Recommending Hip Arthroplasty for Patients with Osteoarthritis? 
Farres Obeidin1, Sarah Dry1 
1University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 
Disclosures: Farres Obeidin: None; Sarah Dry: None 
Background: Recent studies show primary care doctors and orthopedic surgeons are more likely to recommend 
surgery (arthroplasty) for osteoarthritis (OA) to men. As women disproportionately are affected by OA, this 
highlights a gender disparity in the management of OA and is worrisome, given broader subconscious gender and 
racial biases in the medical management of a number of health conditions. To our knowledge, no prior studies have 
assessed the pathologic severity of OA in men and women at joint arthroplasty surgery, which could help us 
understand if differences in management are or are not appropriately associated with objective indicators of 
disease severity.  
Design: A retrospective review of EPIC/Beaker was performed for all hip arthroplasty (HA) specimens performed at 
our institution for primary osteoarthritis between January 1, 2019 and October 15, 2020. Excluded from study were 
cases of OA secondary to congenital hip dysplasia or autoimmune disease, primary avascular necrosis 
and arthroplasy for hip fracture. Gross (percentage of eburnation, presence of osteophytes, gross subchondral cyst 
formation) and microscopic (complete effacement of articular cartilage, thickened subchondral bone, subchondral 
cysts/fibrosis) criteria for osteoarthritis,and severity, were established prior to slide review (Table 1). Two 
pathologists with bone pathology expertise reviewed all slides and reports. Data was analyzed by Fisher's exact 
test.  
Results:  517 cases met initial criteria. Following histologic review, 16 were excluded due to poor slide quality 
(inability to evaluate full articular surface), leaving a study group of 501 cases. This consisted of 284 women (57%) 
and 217 (43%) men, with a mean age of 67. Statistically significant differences (Table 1) were noted in age, gross 
percentage of eburnation and microscopic presence of subchondral cysts/fibrosis. For gross eburnation, 65 (23%) 
of women showed at least 50% eburnation of the femoral head compared to 33 (15%) of men, and 160 (56%) of 
women showed subchondral cysts/fibrosis compared to 100 (46%) of men. No statistically significant differences 
were seen in presence of osteophytes, gross evidence of cyst formation, histologic presence of complete cartilage 
effacement or thickened subchondral bone.

Conclusions: Our data show women had more severe OA compared to men at the time of HA, measured by gross 
eburnation >50% and the presence of microscopic subchondral cysts/fibrosis. This supports prior data showing 
women are more symptomatic than men at the time of arthroplasty, and suggests possible subconscious gender 
bias in managing OA. We will review more cases, collaborate with Radiology to assess the radiologic severity of 
OA in our study group, and perform a medical records review to identify possible medical reasons for surgical 
delays in our study group, to understand if subtle medical factors can explain the differences identified. 
 
979    Patterns of Error in Interpretive Pathology – A Review of 23 PowerPoint Presentations of 
Discordances

Disclosures: Matthew Packer: None; Esther Ravinsky: None; Nazila Azordegan: None 
Background: Quality assurance initiatives and analyses in Anatomical Pathology have until recently focused 
largely on the technical and administrative aspects of laboratory practice. The interpretive component of quality is 
less well studied. Targeted review of cases with discrepant interpretive findings between pathologists can raise 
awareness for specific diagnostic errors through identification of common overarching patterns of error in 
Interpretive Pathology. Between 2010 and 2017, our institution regularly performed PowerPoint presentations of 
discordances for quality assurance and educational purposes. 
Design: We performed a review of 134 Surgical Pathology and Cytopathology cases of discordances from 23 
PowerPoint presentations presented between 2010 and 2017. The discordant initial interpretations were classified 
into three categories according to a system proposed by The Royal College of Pathologists: UK1 (a diagnosis 
which one is surprised to see from any pathologist), UK2 (a diagnosis which is fairly clearly incorrect, but which one 
is not surprised to see a small percentage of pathologists suggesting), and UK3 (a diagnosis where inter-observer 
variation is known to be large). Pathologists and pathology residents, blinded from the official interpretations, were 
presented each case and surveyed for their own diagnostic assessments. Survey results were compared with the 
initial and final interpretations of the official signing pathologists. 
Results: Based on The Royal College of Pathologists categorization system, 44% of the initial official diagnostic 
interpretations were classified as UK3 discrepancies, 54% as UK2, and 1% as UK1. Of the 134 reviewed cases, 
there were 87 (65%) for which most survey respondents proposed a diagnostic interpretation concordant with the 
final official diagnosis. There were 37 cases (28%) for which most survey responses were either wholly or partially 
discordant with the final diagnosis. For 10 cases (7%), there were equal numbers of concordant and discordant 
survey responses. 
Conclusions: While the majority of survey respondents correctly identified the final official diagnosis for most of the 
cases, a large minority did not. Our analyses of the cases with frequent erroneous diagnoses reveal common 
patterns of error that are widely applicable and outline specific error-prone interpretive tendencies. Greater 
awareness for these tendencies, highlighted by presentation of discordant cases, can improve the quality of 
diagnostic pathology services.

Background: Monitoring positive receptors results over time (trend analysis) is an established quality 
measurement in breast carcinoma. Reflex testing using mismatch repair (MMR) immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the 
clinical standard of care for endometrial cancers (EC) patients for Lynch Syndrome (LS) screening and treatment 
decisions, and is performed in many hospitals. In this study, we sought to define the rates of MMR IHC loss in EC 
during the first 3 years of implementation of reflex LS screening, in order to identify the trends for establishing 
benchmarks for future IHC laboratory practices. Our hypothesis was that the proportion of cases with MMR 
deficiency is constant over time. 
Design: Biomarker reports generated as part of our reflex MMR IHC testing program (with antibodies against 
MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6) were retrieved. This encompassed all patients ≤60 years old from 06/2017 
to12/2018 and patients ≤70 years old from 01/2019 to 08/2020. We assumed a 5-6% and 2-3% difference for MLH1 
and MSH2 loss will be detected between follow-up time intervals, respectively. Two-sided binominal test was used 
for sample size analysis. 
Results: For semiannual analysis over 3 years, sample size analysis identified a total case volume to establish 
benchmarks for testing proficiency to be 64 patients for MLH1 and 53 patients for MSH2/MSH6/PMS2, with a 0.048 
significance level, 80% power. Our cohort contained 534 EC cases (110 biopsies and 424 resections) thus meeting 
this requirement. There were 409 endometrioid, 25 serous, 15 carcinosarcomas, 7 mixed, 6 clear cell, 4 de-
differentiated, and 68 carcinomas with mixed epithelial histotypes. Mean rate of MLH1/PMS2 loss was 19%, 
MSH2/MSH6 3%, MSH6 4% and PMS2 2% (Figure 1). The proportion of MMR deficient cases was steady over 
time (Figure 2). 
Figure 1 - 980 
 
 
 
 
 
1171 
Figure 2 - 980 
 
Conclusions: Successful IHC trend analysis is contingent not only on volume of testing but frequency of the event 
being tested. It is required to establish benchmarks for risk mitigation. While our laboratory, which is affiliated with a 
large cancer center and accepts regional cancer patient referrals, showed that we do have the minimum volume for 
establishing the benchmarks to for internal MMR IHC quality control, this volume is not attainable for smaller 
laboratories. This study underscores the necessity for such laboratories to participate in external quality control 
programs and/or lab consortiums. Alternatively, there should be regional centralization of MMR IHC testing. 
 
981    The Utility of Postmortem Blood Cultures: A Two-Year Institutional Assessment

Disclosures: Stephanie Riviere: None; Abigail Alexander: None; Lee Cross: None; Katelyn Dannheim: Consultant, 
K.D. has received consulting fees from PathAI for work unrelated to this manuscript; April Bobenchik: None 
Background: There has been a general lack of consensus as to whether obtaining postmortem cultures at autopsy 
is of clinical utility. Much of this is due to difficulty with interpretation of results and frequent gross contamination. 
Though our institution adopts a standard procedure for how to collect postmortem blood cultures, there are no 
explicit guidelines or indications for doing so. In this retrospective study, we sought to review autopsy cases and 
determine whether obtaining postmortem cultures is of clinical benefit and if they add value to the final autopsy 
report. 
Design: From January 2017 to January 2019, 205 autopsies were identified at one institution. Clinical, autopsy, 
and postmortem blood culture data were reviewed including antemortem blood culture findings, clinical cause of 
 
 
 
 
1172 
death, time between patient expiration and autopsy (postmortem interval) and autopsy diagnosis/cause of death. 
Postmortem blood culture contamination was identified by using the criteria of having >1 species growing in the 
blood culture.  
Results: Of the 205 autopsies performed, postmortem blood cultures were obtained in 66% (135/205) of autopsies. 
The postmortem blood cultures were deemed contaminants in 65% (88/135) of cases, 23% (31/135) of cases grew 
only one species, and 12% (16/135) of cases showed no growth. The average postmortem interval was 25 hours 
for cases with no growth and 34 hours for contaminated cases and for cases where only a single organism grew. 
Additionally, in cases with postmortem cultures taken, only 53% (71/135) had the postmortem culture results 
included in the autopsy report while 47% (64/135) had no mention of the results at all. In 3% (4/135) of cases, the 
autopsy diagnosis of sepsis confirmed the antemortem findings and in 5% (6/135) of cases, an autopsy diagnosis 
of sepsis was made where clinically it was not identified. 
Conclusions: Overall, postmortem blood cultures have a limited utility and significance mainly due to the high rate 
of contamination and lack of reporting. To enhance efficiency by reducing time, effort and cost, our institution would 
benefit by adopting standard autopsy guidelines which detail how and when blood cultures should be 
taken.  The guidelines should include the following: (1) taking postmortem cultures only when clinically warranted, 
(2) the review of proper sample collection technique, (3) considering the impact that the postmortem interval has on 
culture results, and (4) ensuring the results of the cultures are clearly communicated in the autopsy reports.   
 
982    A Method for Assessing Performance of Automated Immunohistochemical Staining 
Platforms Using Digital Image Analysis

Disclosures: Rebecca Rojansky: None; Sebastian Fernandez-Pol: None; Ellen Gomulia: None; Yasodha 
Natkunam: None; Megan Troxell: None 
Background: Assessment of immunohistochemical staining platform performance is largely limited to subjective 
evaluation by trained personnel. Rigorous, routine, and/or semi-quantitative assessment of stain intensity is not 
typically performed. In this study we have developed a semi-automated method using whole slide images (WSIs) to 
assess stain intensity. This method substantiated staining variability that was suspected by visual evaluation, 
identified outlier instruments for further troubleshooting, and confirmed successful intervention. 
Design: We assessed performance for five stainers by staining three positive control sections with anti-Anaplastic 
Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) on each. After slide scanning, 5x images were exported. Cell boundaries were detected 
using watershed cell detection in QuPath and mean DAB intensity per cell was calculated. Data was analyzed in R. 
We then focused analysis on three stainers, running a total of 48 positive and 48 negative control sections with or 
without uninterruptible power managers (UPMs). We replaced one instrument and installed UPMs on all five. 1,036 
on-slide controls from clinical cases stained with either ALK (144 sections) or estrogen receptor (892 sections) over 
six months were retrospectively analyzed to confirm improved performance. 
Results: This method revealed two technical variables impacting quality. The addition of UPMs resulted in a 
statistically significant increase in average DAB intensity per cell of over two-fold. This finding was independently 
corroborated on visual inspection. Digital analysis also highlighted one outlier instrument with over two-fold lower 
stain intensity than other instruments. This quantitation facilitated instrument replacement by the manufacturer. The 
replacement showed comparable stain intensity to the other instruments in our lab. Analysis of clinical cases 
confirmed sustained improvement in staining quality after our interventions.

Figure 2 - 982 
 
Conclusions: We show that routine evaluation of WSIs can be used to rigorously test immunohistochemical 
staining performance. Our approach requires minimal active time and utilizes freely available image processing and 
data analysis tools. On-slide controls can be analyzed without additional reagent costs, while the costs for 
dedicated or batch controls include only control tissue, slides, and reagents. In the future, a seamless data pipeline 
could be developed based on this method to utilize on slide control tissue to monitor stain quality in in a real time or 
nearly real time manner.

Background: Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the United States estimated to cause about 
53,200 deaths during 2020. Thanks to surveillance colonoscopy, the death rate of colorectal cancer has been 
declining for several decades. Accurate pathology diagnosis on colonic polyp biopsies is critical for patient care as 
it determines surveillance interval. Occasionally, a histologic explanation of the polyp formation is not made while 
initial sections featuring normal histology. However, there are no guidelines on what to do in this situation. Recent 
studies have suggested the need for deeper sections since occult adenomas were noted in 1.3 %–19.7% of cases. 
Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether deeper sections can help to improve the diagnostic accuracy in 
specimens with initial normal histology. 
Design: Since July 2018, the recommendation for deeper sections on all colorectal polyps with an initial normal 
histology has been implemented in our institution. Pre and post-implementation data from July 2017 to June 
2019 were collected on all colorectal polyps with initial diagnosis of normal histology. Specimens from polyposis 
genetic syndrome, inflammatory bowel diseases, initial diagnosis of carcinomas and multiple polyps with initial 
diagnosis of adenoma in at least one polyp were excluded. The detection rate and overall rate of occult adenomas 
were analyzed and compared between pre and post-implementation. 
Results: The rate of deeper sections was increased significantly from 23.5% (103/429) to 40.0% (131/327) after 
implementation of the protocol. The pre-implementation detection rate of occult adenomas in deeper sections was 
15.5%, which was slightly increased to 17.5% post-implementation (p>0.05). The overall rate of occult adenoma 
detection was improved significantly from 3.7% (16/429) to 7.0% (23/327) in the studied cohort when comparing 
pre and post-implementation data (p<0.05) (Table 1). The occult adenomas consist of predominantly tubular 
adenoma and to a less extent of sessile serrated adenoma (Figure 1).

Conclusions: The detection rate of occult adenomas on deeper sections of initial normal colonic polyp biopsies 
was compatible with that reported in the literature (1.3%-19.7%). The significant increase in rate of adenoma 
detection in patients with otherwise normal histology suggested deeper sections can increase the diagnostic 
accuracy in colorectal biopsies and improve the patient care. 
 
984    Value Proposition Canvas: A Roadmap for Engaging Clinicians and Understanding Clinical 
Requirements

Background: In business parlance, the Value Proposition (VP) of any service refers to the perception of the 
service as promised, communicated, delivered, and acknowledged by both the producer and the consumer of the 
service. Value Proposition Canvas (VPC) is a unique business exercise that helps organizations understand their 
VP. To our knowledge, VPC has never been utilized in Pathology. Herein, we describe the outcomes of two 
Pathology VPC workshops.  
Design: Since 2019, annual VPC workshops were performed using the methodology described by Osterwalder, A. 
Value Proposition Design: How to Create Products and Services Customers Want. John Wiley & Sons (2014). 
Each VPC workshop captured the VP of a pathology laboratory in two distinct segments: Customer Profile, and 
Value Map. To create a comprehensive Customer Profile, we invited a  group of four internists (one hospitalist, two 
outpatient physicians, one chief resident), one nurse, and one surgical pathologist (representing surgeons) to 
conduct individual didactic and Q&A sessions (45-60 minutes each). Each presenter described their daily tasks, 
requirements from the pathology laboratory, and challenges. This information was collated into a comprehensive 
Customer Profile. Thereafter, the VPC workshop attendees (technologists, laboratory administrators, and 
pathologists) created a corresponding Value Map for the pathology laboratory services. 
Results: The 2019 in-person workshop included 20 attendees, and the 2020 virtual workshop included 30 
attendees. The collated Customer Profile captured unmet needs (i.e. clinician Pain-points) that included limited 
integration with mobile devices, limited knowledge of appropriate test utilization, and routing of time-sensitive 
diagnoses to one individual rather than the entire clinical team. The envisioned Pain-relievers included integration 
with mobile reporting, modules towards appropriate laboratory utilization for clinical trainees, and streamlined result 
routing to the entire clinical team. The clinician's Gain-points included consistent turnaround times, A1c point-of-
care testing, interpretive comments, and a responsive customer center. The envisioned Gain-creators included 
 
 
 
 
1176 
information on referred testing turnaround time, expanding A1c point-of-care testing, and streamlining means of 
contacting pathologists.  
Figure 1 - 984 
 
Conclusions: The VPC workshops allowed us to systematically identify our local customer needs. While the 
majority of the identified opportunities require complex interventions, we feel that a formal and documented VPC 
workshop provides a framework that allows pathologists, clinicians, and other stakeholders to understand service 
requirements and envision practical solutions. This proactive approach is a definite improvement compared to 
reactive problem-solving. Based on our experience, we recommend that pathologists should explore and adopt 
VPC in their practice.

Background: Accurate assessment of lymph node (LN) status is essential for proper staging of resected lung 
cancer specimens, with the pathologist responsible for identifying LNs within the resection specimen, including the 
lobar (level 12), segmental (level 13), and subsegmental (level 14) stations. A growing body of literature suggests 
that suboptimal sampling of these LNs leads to tumor understaging. Here, we assessed interventions taken by our 
department to optimize evaluation of peribronchial LNs in lung cancer resection specimens as part of a Plan-Do-
Study-Act quality improvement cycle. 
Design: All lung cancer anatomic resection specimens from 2017 to 2020 at our institution were evaluated, 
including specimens from two years pre-intervention and one year post-intervention. The measures to increase 
peribronchial LN yield included: educational grossing sessions for pathology assistants and residents, instructions 
to submit two cassettes of peribronchial tissue if no LNs were identified grossly, and a hard-stop prior to sign-out by 
the attending pathologist if no peribronchial LNs were identified. Statistical significance was established using the 
rank correlation. 
Results: Over the 3 year study period, there were a total of 227 resection specimens for non-small cell lung 
cancer, further subdivided into 184 (81%) adenocarcinomas and 43 (19%) squamous cell carcinomas (Table). Prior 
 
 
 
 
1177 
to the intervention, 91/151 (60.3%) specimens had peribronchial LNs identified during grossing (Figure panel A), 
with an additional 16/151 (10.6%) specimens with peribronchial LNs identified by microscopic examination only 
(Figure panel B). After the intervention, significantly more (58/76, 76.3%, p=0.016) specimens had peribronchial 
LNs identified during grossing, with a similar proportion of specimens (8/76, 10.5%) specimens with peribronchial 
LNs identified by microscopic examination only.  The mean number of peribronchial LNs significantly increased 
from 2.68±3.31 pre-intervention to 4.32±3.98 post-intervention (p<0.001). Despite identifying more peribronchial 
LNs, there was no significant difference in peribronchial LN metastases pre-intervention (19/151, 12.6%) compared 
to post-intervention (8/76, 10.5%, p=0.326). Further analysis revealed a strong correlation between peribronchial 
LN metastases with both overall tumor size and invasive component size (for adenocarcinomas), correlation 
coefficient 0.974, p<0.0001.

Conclusions: The intervention led to a significant increase in the number of peribronchial LNs identified and 
assessed during histopathologic evaluation of anatomic lung cancer resection specimens, although this did not lead 
to an increase in nodal up-staging. Larger tumors are more likely to have occult peribronchial LN metastases, which 
may warrant a more aggressive peribronchial LN search for larger resected tumors.

Background: Cytology laboratories are required to establish quality assurance (QA) programs to evaluate 
laboratory performance and the competency of staff using various metrics.  Given the high volume of data 
generated by the laboratory information system (LIS) and our large integrated health system, our laboratory 
established an analytical software solution to extract and summarize important data to look at quality metrics.  The 
aim of this study was to review our experience with this novel tool for performance review and quality improvement 
in gynecological (GYN) and non-GYN cytopathology.  
 
 
 
 
1179 
Design: Our laboratory created an analytical database software tool (QA zoom, version 4.6, created 2008) that 
extracts daily data from the pathology LIS (CoPathPlus, Cerner, version 2017.01.1.124) and a time entry tool for 
cytotechnologists.  Data is accessible to staff with a secure login.  Quality metrics are analyzed on an ongoing 
monthly basis for the laboratory and cytotechnologists, and an annual basis for cytopathologists. 
Results: An average of 51,236 cases per year have been analyzed by QA zoom over the past 3 years. Various 
metrics have been examined for the laboratory and individuals, including volume of cases, ASCUS/SIL ratio, and 
nondiagnostic/indeterminate rates.  Cytotechnologists can track daily slide workload and discrepancies, and then 
sign off when they review their discrepancies, which provides ongoing feedback.  The laboratory also uses this tool 
for quintile analysis/verification for the GYN cytology automated screener and stainer, and has detected quality 
control issues with the staining based on drift of the high-grade GYN cytology results out of the expected 
quintiles.  This has also provided important information on staff and laboratory performance that has enhanced our 
regulatory compliance documentation, in addition to initiating and tracking different quality improvement projects, 
including second review to reduce indeterminate thyroid diagnoses.  An example of the QA Zoom interface (Figure 
1) and quality measures extracted (Table 1) are shown.

Conclusions: The implementation of an analytical database tool has provided our cytopathology laboratory with 
important quality data that has allowed us to track performance of the laboratory, in addition to providing 
personalized feedback and obtaining individualized competency data on staff.  This LIS-driven tool allows us to 
readily obtain important QA data to monitor important trends in data, provide educational feedback for staff, 
determine staffing needs, verify performance of lab equipment, and overall, improve patient care by looking into 
ways to improve indeterminate rates. In the future, expanding the application to include more rapid on-site 
evaluation data and cytology-histology correlation data, in addition to linking to our new LIS, will be explored.

Background: Thyroseq next-generation sequencing assay and Afirma gene expression classifier (GEC) are used 
to risk-stratify thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology: Bethesda III (atypia of undetermined significance, 
AUS/FLUS) and IV (suspicious for follicular neoplasm, SFN). In this study, we performed a paired comparison of 
both tests on the same group of indeterminate thyroid nodules with surgical followup. 
Design: Of 645 AUS/FLUS/SFN cases with both molecular testing and surgical resection in 2014-2017, 40 cases 
had both Thyroseq (v2) and Afirma GEC performed on the same specimen. Cross-tabulations and ROC curves 
were created. McNemar tests were done to compare the performance of Thyroseq versus Afirma. The diagnostic 
performance of combined results were also examined: the combined result was called positive only if both 
Thyroseq and Afirma were positive/suspicious. Non-invasive follicular thyroid with papillary like nuclear features 
(NIFTP) on surgical resections was defined as “positive.” 
Results: 20/40 (50%) cases were “positive” on surgical pathology: 8 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 11 NIFTP, 
and 1 follicular carcinoma. Thyroseq and Afirma both showed high sensitivity and low specificity in diagnosing 
malignancy in indeterminate thyroid nodules. 
Next, the results of both tests were combined. The overall accuracy of combined testing was higher than either test 
alone (Figure 1). Compared to Afirma alone, the combined test had significantly higher specificity (30% vs 70%, 
 
 
 
 
1181 
p<0.05, Table 1), while the sensitivity declined from 90% to 75% (p=0.25, Table 1). Compared to Thyroseq alone, 
there was no significant difference in specificity (45% vs 70% p=0.06) or sensitivity (80% vs 75%,  p=1.00, Table 1). 
Positive predictive value (PPV) improved compared to either test alone. Negative predictive value (NPV) improved 
compared to Thyroseq alone, and declined only slightly compared to Afirma alone. 
Figure 1 - 987 
 
Conclusions: Molecular testing of cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules helps determine the extent of 
surgery. Low diagnostic performance metrics may limit the utility of molecular studies in distinguishing benign from 
malignant thyroid lesions. Our results show that the combined results of Thyroseq and Afirma improved the 
specificity and overall accuracy of molecular testing, and provided additional value in the surgical management of 
patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that compares the 
performance of these two molecular tests on the same thyroid nodules.

988    Rapid Diagnostics of Sepsis in Patients with Positive Blood Culture by BCID Multiple PCR 
Kemin Xu1, Guiqing Wang2 
1Westchester Medical Center, Valhalla, NY, 2Westchester Medical Center at New York Medical College, 
Valhalla, NY 
Disclosures: Kemin Xu: None; Guiqing Wang: None 
Background: The FilmArray BCID assay is an FDA-cleared multiple real-time PCR test that detects 20 common 
microorganisms causing bloodstream infections and three resistance genes. The performance of BCID PCR and 
the turnaround times from the flagged positive on the BACTEC Blood Culture System to reporting of gram stain and 
BCID multiplex PCR results remain variable and depend on many factors.  Therefore, the accuracy and turnaround 
time of reporting blood culture results by BCID Multiple PCR will be analyzed. 
Design: All BCID multiplex PCR performed from Jan 2019 to Dec 2019 at WMC Microbiology Laboratory were 
retrospectively retrieved. The time of BACTEC flag positive, gram stain result and BCID multiplex PCR results of 
BCID test were obtained by reviewing the workcard of each positive blood culture. 
Results: From January 2019 to December 2019, a total of 2,540 positive blood cultures were identified at the WMC 
Clinical Microbiology Laboratory with an average monthly positive of 212 blood cultures. 792 BCID multiplex PCR 
were performed, which account for 32.5% of positive blood cultures. The sensitivity of BCID is 90.2% with 9.8% of 
false negative rate. However, for 4.5% of those negatives, the microorganism detected by conventional method 
was not included in BCID panel list. 
The turnaround time of reporting blood culture results is critical for patient management. From the instrument 
flagged positive to gram stain results, 27.1% of cases were reported within 30 minutes, 70.8% of cases were 
reported within 60 minutes and 91% of cases were reported within 2 hours with median time of 44 minutes. From 
gram stain results to BCID multiplex PCR results, 46.1 % of cases were reported within 2 hours, while 87.3% of 
cases were reported within 8 hours with median time of 128 minutes (Table 1). 
The most common microorganisms detected by BCID multiplex PCR were Staphylococcus 
epidermidis and Escherichia coli, which account for 24.2% and 17.7% of all isolates respectively, followed 
by Staphylococcus aureus, which account for 11.1% of all isolates.  Candida sp, Streptococcus species, Klebsiella 
pneumonia and Enterococcus had similar detection rate by BCID with 8-9% of all isolates. 
Approximately 38.6% of S. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), which accounts for 17.6% 
of total isolates with resistance gene. 26 out of 59 enterococcus (44.1%) have vancomycin-resistance gene and 3 
strains of Klebsiella pneumonia (4.8%) have carbapenem-resistance gene.

Conclusions: BCID multiplex PCR is able to provide accurate and rapid results with potential clinical added value 
and can serve as a complementary tool to current routine microbiology techniques, although it remains necessary 
to obtain complete susceptibility results for definitive therapy.

Background: Adequate immunophenotyping and molecular testing are important for the diagnosis and prognosis 
in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and may guide treatment selection to achieve better 
outcomes. This study aims to assess the impact of adherence to guideline-recommended diagnostic testing on 
treatment selection and overall survival (OS) in patients with DLBCL who initiated rituximab-based first line of 
therapy (1-LOT). 
Design: This is a retrospective cohort study leveraging data from the Flatiron Health electronic health record-
derived de-identified database, including diagnostic testing information on immunohistochemistry (IHC), 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and karyotype analysis that were abstracted from pathology reports or 
clinical visit notes, where available. This study includes patients above 18 years old who were diagnosed with 
DLBCL between Jan-2011 and Dec-2019 and initiated rituximab-based 1-LOT. Patients were classified into ‘non-
adherence’, ‘partial-adherence’, and ‘complete-adherence’ groups according to the evidence/documentation of a 
confirmed known result for IHC and molecular testing (FISH and Karyotype) on a selection of the markers prior to 
the initiation of 1-LOT. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations of adherence to diagnostic testing 
with 1-LOT between R-CHOP and other rituximab-based regimens. Median OS after the start of rituximab-based 1-
LOT was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression 
was used to assess the risk of mortality after initiation of 1-LOT by the degree of adherence to diagnostic testing.  
Results: In total 3830 patients with DLBCL who initiated rituximab-based 1-LOT were included. No association was 
found between adherence to guideline-recommended diagnostic testing and treatment selection of 1-LOT. Patients 
with a higher degree of adherence to diagnostic testing survived longer (median OS at 61.1, 83.0 and 84.9 months 
for ‘non-adherence’, ‘partial-adherence’, and ‘complete-adherence’ groups, respectively [log-rank p<0.001]) and 
had a decreased mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio with 95% confidence intervals at 0.83 [0.70-0.98] for ‘partial-
adherence’ and 0.77 [0.65-0.91] for ‘complete-adherence’ groups, respectively). 
Conclusions: Patients adherence to guideline-recommended diagnostic testing were associated with better 
survival benefit, reinforcing the need for adoption of diagnostic testing guidelines in routine clinical care.
