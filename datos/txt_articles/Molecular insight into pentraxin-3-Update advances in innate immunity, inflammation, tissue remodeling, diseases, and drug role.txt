Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) is the prototype of the long pentraxin subfamily, an acute-phase protein consisting of a C- 
terminal pentraxin domain and a unique N-terminal domain. PTX3 was initially isolated from human umbilical 
vein endothelial cells and human FS-4 fibroblasts. It was subsequently found to be also produced by synovio­
cytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, smooth muscle cells, myeloid dendritic cells, epithelial cells, and tumor cells. 
Various modulatory factors, such as miRNAs, cytokines, drugs, and hypoxic conditions, could regulate the 
expression level of PTX3. PTX3 is essential in regulating innate immunity, inflammation, angiogenesis, and tissue 
remodeling. Besides, PTX3 may play dual (pro-tumor and anti-tumor) roles in oncogenesis. PTX3 is involved in 
the occurrence and development of many non-cancerous diseases, including COVID-19, and might be a potential 
biomarker indicating the prognosis, activity,and severity of diseases. In this review, we summarize and discuss 
the potential roles of PTX3 in the oncogenesis and pathogenesis of non-cancerous diseases and potential targeted 
therapies based on PTX3.   
1. Introduction 
Pentraxins are a family of evolutionarily highly conserved proteins 
characterized by a cyclic multimeric structure [1,2]. Besides, pentraxins 
belong to soluble pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are essential 
components of humoral immunity [2]. The members of the pentraxin 
family share a C-terminal pentraxin domain that contains an eight amino 
acid-long conserved pentraxin signature (His-x-Cys-x-Ser/Thr-Trp-x-Ser, 
where x is any amino acid) [1,3]. Based on their structural differences in 
subunits, the pentraxin family could be divided into two subfamilies: the 
short and long pentraxins [1]. The short pentraxins include C reactive 
protein (CRP) and serum amyloid P component (SAP) [4–6], while the 
long pentraxin subfamily consists of neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1 or 
NPTX1), neuronal pentraxin 2 (NP2 or NPTX2), neuronal pentraxin re­
ceptor (NPR), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), and pentraxin 4 (PTX4) [1]. 
PTX3 is the prototypic protein of the long pentraxin subfamily [7–9]. 
It is a 381-amino acid-long glycoprotein comprised of a C-terminal 
pentraxin domain and a unique N-terminal domain [10]. It was initially 
discovered in human umbilical vein endothelial cells(HUVECs) and 
human FS-4 fibroblasts in the 1990 s [7,8], which was subsequently 
detected in many other cells, including smooth muscle cells, myeloid 
dendritic cells, epithelial cells, and tumor cells [11–14]. MiRNAs,

cytokines, transcription factors, and drugs could modulate the expres­
sion level of PTX3 [13,15–19]. 
PTX3 plays essential roles in the regulation of innate immunity 
through exerting opsonic activity, modulating complement activation, 
forming and regulating neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [20–23]. 
Mice with PTX3 overexpression were protected from severe inflamma­
tory responses such as LPS-induced endotoxic shock and polymicrobial 
sepsis caused by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) [24]. PTX3 binds to 
fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), an angiogenic factor from the 
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, with high affinity and specificity, 
acting as a natural angiogenesis inhibitor [25]. In addition, PTX3 could 
bind to fibrinogen/fibrin and plasminogen at acidic pH and increased 
plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis, which is a premise for appropriate repair 
[26]. Interestingly, PTX3 could be synthesized by cumulus cells before 
ovulation and involved in the organization of the hyaluronan-rich pro­
visional matrix required for successful fertilization [27]. 
Notably, PTX3 is overexpressed in many types of tumors, such as 
breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, 
glioma, melanoma, and liposarcoma [28–35]. It is also reported that 
elevated PTX3 levels are associated with tumor stages/grades and 
maybe a prognostic marker in patients with specific tumor types [32,36, 
37]. Besides, PTX3 has been proved to be involved in the onset, angio­
genesis, metastatic dissemination, and immune-modulation of tumor 
[14]. Interestingly, PTX3 may play dual (pro-tumor and anti-tumor) 
roles in cancer, depending on cellular source, tumor type and tumor 
microenvironment [14]. Furthermore, plenty of studies support that 
PTX3 is associated with many non-cancerous diseases, including 
atherosclerosis, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), asthma, hepatic 
cirrhosis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE), acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), sepsis, 
systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and stroke [38–44]. 
In this review, we summarize the structure, sources, regulation, 
biological activities, and receptors/ligands of PTX3. We also discuss the 
roles of PTX3 in cancerous and non-cancerous diseases. Correspond­
ingly, we illustrate potential targeted therapies based on PTX3. 
2. Genetic variants and structure of PTX3 
2.1. Genetic variants of PTX3 
The human PTX3 gene, located on chromosome 3q25, is 1861 base 
pairs long and has three exons and two introns [7,45]. The first and 
second exons encode leader peptide and the N-terminal domain, while 
the third encodes the C-terminal-pentraxin domain [7]. Besides, it is 
reported that the enhancer or proximal promoters of PTX3 genes in 
humans and mice contain many potential binding sites which could 
interact with transcription factors, such as Pu1, AP-1, NF-κB, SP1, and 
NF-IL-6 [45,46]. 
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) in PTX3 are closely associ­
ated with susceptibility and development of some infectious and 
neoplastic diseases [47,48]. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) patients, the rs1840680 AA genotype is significantly associated 
with an increased risk of pulmonary aspergillosis [47]. Additionally, in 
non-neutropenic patients, there is a close association between the 
rs3816527 CC genotype and a higher risk for invasive pulmonary 
aspergillosis (IPA). Conversely, the rs3816527 AA genotype is possibly 
related to a lower risk of pulmonary cryptococcus [49]. Donor haplotype 
h2/h2 (G-A/G-A) in PTX3 impairs the antifungal capacity of neutrophils 
and may increase susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis in patients 
treated with hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation [50]. In 
HIV-uninfected Chinese patients, the rs2305619 polymorphism AA ge­
notype has been proved to cause a higher risk of cryptococcosis [51]. 
Moreover, in smokers with oral cancer, the rs3816527 CC genotype was 
closely associated with late-stage tumors and lymph node metastasis 
[48]. In HCV-infected patients, the polymorphisms rs1840680 and 
rs2305619 were significantly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma 
occurrence [52]. Furthermore, SNPs in PTX3 were related to female 
fertility [53]. The women carrying rs6788044 show higher lipopoly­
saccharide (LPS)-induced PTX3 production and a higher number of 
offspring [53]. 
2.2. The structure of PTX3 
Due to structural differences in subunits, pentraxins could be clas­
sified into short pentraxins and long pentraxins [1]. CRP and SAP belong 
to short pentraxins [4–6], while PTX3 was identified as a prototype of 
long pentraxins [1]. The human PTX3 protomer is a 381-amino 
acid-long glycoprotein consisting of a 203-amino acid-long C-terminal 
domain and a 178-amino acid-long N-terminal domain [10]. 
About the secondary structure of PTX3, the N-terminal region in 
PTX3 has four α-helices connected by some short loops. At the same 
time, the C-terminal domain contains two anti-parallel β-sheets and a 
single α-helix located on the protein surface [10]. It is reported that long 
pentraxins share a highly homologous C-terminal domain with short 
pentraxins [1,3]. However, The N-terminal field in long pentraxins is 
unrelated to other known proteins, including short pentraxins, making it 
a unique characteristic of the long pentraxin group [54]. Therefore, 
there may be overlapping and different biological/ligand recognition 
properties between the long pentraxin PTX3 and short pentraxins [8, 
10]. 
Recombinant human PTX3 is secreted as a mixture of oligomers, the 
most abundant of which are likely to be octamers [55]. The PTX3 
octamer is composed of eight identical protomers linked through di­
sulfide bonds [55,56]. It possesses two domains of different sizes that are 
connected by a stalk. Thus, the PTX3 octamer is asymmetric [56]. One 
domain is a tetramer linked by a disulfide bond, while the other is a 
dimer of dimers (a non-covalent tetramer) [56]. Furthermore, it is re­
ported that interchain disulfide bonds play a crucial role in the forma­
tion and stabilization of PTX3 multimeric structure [56]. On the one 
hand, in the N-terminal domain, three cysteine residues (Cys47, Cys49, 
and Cys103) form interchain disulfide bonds, which stabilize the as­
sembly of PTX3 subunits into tetramers [56]. On the other hand, Cys317 
and Cys318 in the C-terminal domain form an interchain disulfide bond 
linking PTX3 tetramer pairs into octamers [56]. 
Notably, PTX3 could bind to diverse ligands/receptors with different 
structures and sources, which possibly depends on its structural prop­
erties. The disulfide-linked tetramer and the tetramer consisting of a 
dimer of dimers in the N-terminal domain of PTX3 protein could 
respectively bind to a single FGF-2 molecule[56] (Fig. 1). FGF-2 is a 
pro-angiogenic factor, and PTX3 could act as an angiogenic inhibitor by 
antagonizing FGF-2 [56,57]. Moreover, the N-terminal domain of PTX3 
interacts with the heavy chains (HCs) of inter-α- trypsin inhibitor(IαI), 
and this interaction plays a key role in hyaluronan organization in ma­
trix formation of cumulus oophorus [58]. In addition, plasminogen (Plg) 
[26], fibrin [26], TSG-6 [59], FGF-8b [60], myeloid differentiation 
protein 2 (MD-2) [61] and conidia of A.fumigatus [62] could also bind to 
N-terminal region of PTX3. Furthermore, P-selectin and complement 
C1q bind to the C-terminal region of PTX3 [63,64], while complement 
Factor H (FH) [65] and Ficolin-1 [66] interact with both C- and N-ter­
minal domains of PTX3. 
There is also an N-glycosylation site on Asn 220 in the C-terminal 
domain of PTX3 [67]. It is found that PTX3 was primarily N-linked to 
complex-type oligosaccharides, which are mainly composed of (bian­
tennary) fucosylated and (variably) sialylated structures [67]. Interest­
ingly, it has been reported that the relative content of bi-, tri-, and 
tetrantennary oligosaccharides and the level of sialylation is highly 
variable among PTX3 from different cellular sources, indicating that the 
glycosylation status of PTX3 might change depending on cell type and 
inducing stimuli [67,68]. Glycosidic moiety in PTX3 involves in regu­
lating the interaction of PTX3 with many ligands (e.g., hemagglutinin 
glycoprotein (HAG) of influenza virus, C1q, FH, and P-selectin) and 
plays important roles in regulating antiviral activities, complement

activation, inflammation, and tumorgenesis [64,65,67,69,70], which 
will be discussed in the following ’5. Biological activities of PTX3’ 
chapter and ’6. PTX3 in oncogenesis’ chapter. 
Therefore, the complex structural characteristics of PTX3 are closely 
related to the versatile roles of PTX3 in physiological and pathological 
processes. 
3. The source and expression of PTX3 
PTX3, also termed tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 14 (TSG- 
14) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 5(TNFAIP5), was 
initially isolated from IL-1β-induced HUVECs and TNF-α-stimulated 
human FS-4 fibroblasts [7–9]. 
PTX3 could be synthesized by a variety of cells, including endothelial

FcγRIII, CD32, MD-2, TLR4, CD44, P-selectin, FGF-2, FGF-8b, Fibrin, Fibrinogen, Plg, HC of IαI, and TSG-6), which is crucial for its roles in innate immunity,

cells [7], smooth muscle cells [11], fibroblasts [8], myeloid dendritic 
cells [12], monocytes /macrophages [71], adipose cells [72], synovio­
cytes [73], chondrocytes [74], osteoblasts [75], cumulus cells [76] and 
tumor cells [14]. Moreover, PTX3 is also produced by some epithelial 
cells, such as proximal renal tubular epithelial cells, lung alveolar 
epithelial cells, and retinal pigment epithelial cells [13,17,77]. 
Interestingly, during the acute phase of stroke, reactive astrocytes in 
the peri-infarct region could produce PTX3 [78]. Furthermore, it is re­
ported that PTX3 is stored in the neutrophil-specific granules and could 
be rapidly released in microbial recognition and inflammation [79]. 
4. The regulation of PTX3 expression 
4.1. Regulatory factors at the gene level 
At the gene level, the inhibition of miR-29c-3p could upregulate the 
PTX3 level in MEN-117 and MEN-141 meningioma cell lines [80] 
(Table 1). Inhibiting miR-224 could upregulate the PTX3 expression in 
the SiHa cell line, thus preventing the progression of cervical carcinoma 
[15]. MiR-224 could also downregulate the NF-κB-induced PTX3 
expression to attenuate innate immune response in inner ear inflam­
mation [16]. Moreover, miR-224 hurts ovulation in the mouse model by 
reducing expressions of PTX3 and Smad4 [81]. In mice with the acute 
coronary syndrome, miR-150 could decrease the PTX3 expression via 
the NF-κB signaling pathway, thus facilitating endothelial cell prolifer­
ation, migration, and attenuating vascular remodeling [82]. In addition, 
miR-29b-3p inhibits PTX3 expression in H9c2 cells, thus aggravating the 
hypoxia/reoxygenation injury of H9c2 cells [83]. 
4.2. Regulatory factors at the cellular level 
LPS, IL-1β, and TNF-α could induce the PTX3 expression in human 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [71]. Besides, LPS was 
reported to up-regulate PTX3 levels in human neutrophils and 
monocyte-derived macrophages [84]. IL-1β and TNF-α, but not IFN-γ, 
could up-regulate the protein and mRNA expression of PTX3 in human 
retinal pigment epithelial ARPE-19 cells via ERK and NF-κB signaling 
pathways [17]. TNF-ɑ, but not LPS, could increase the PTX3 gene and 
protein expression in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells and human 
bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells via the JNK pathway [77]. IL-1β, 
TNF-α, IL-17, and CD40L could respectively enhance the PTX3 expres­
sion in primary human proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) and 
HK-2 cells [13]. In addition, IL-1β and CD40L could synergistically in­
crease PTX3 production in PTECs and HK-2 cells [13]. In contrast, IL-4 
and IL-6 could not increase PTX3 production in the aforementioned two 
types of cells [13]. The expression and secretion of PTX3 could be 
up-regulated by TNF and IL-1β in cultured amniotic membrane epithe­
lial and stromal cells [85]. IL-1β has been reported to increase the 
expression of PTX3 mRNA in endometrial stromal cells [86]. IFN-γ could 
inhibit the TNF-, IL-1β- and LPS-stimulated PTX3 expression and 
secretion in human monocytes; however, the inhibitory role of INF-γ has 
not been detected in human fibroblasts and endothelial cells [87]. The 
secretion of PTX3 protein from human airway smooth muscle cells 
(HASMCs) of asthma patients could be induced by TNF and IL-1β, while 
Th2 (IL-4, IL-9, and IL-13), Th1 (IFN-γ), or Th17 (IL-17) cytokines have 
no significant impact on PTX3 secretion from HASMCs [88]. 
Notably, IFN-γ and TGF-β could downregulate TNF-ɑ- and IL-1β- 
induced PTX3 production in synovial cells in RA patients [73]. Besides, 
TGF-β1 could suppress the expression of PTX3 via TβRI -SMAD2/3-S­
MAD4 
signaling 
pathway 
in 
orbital 
fibroblasts 
in 
both 
thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy patients and healthy volunteers 
[18]. Activin A, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, could inhibit the 
expression of PTX3 in SVOG cells via the ALK4-SMAD2/3-SMAD4 
signaling pathway [89]. Growth differentiation factor 8 (GDF-8), also 
known as myostatin, belongs to the TGF-β superfamily and could 
decrease the PTX3 expression in SVOG cells via ACVR2A/ 
ACVR2B-ALK5-mediated 
SMAD-dependent 
signaling 
[90]. Bone 
morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), another member of the TGF-β super­
family, could suppress the mRNA and protein expression of PTX3 in 
SVOG cells via the SMAD1/5/8-SMAD4 signaling pathway [91]. BMP4 
and BMP7 could also down-regulate the expression of PTX3 in SVOG 
cells through Smad-dependent signaling [92]. It has also been reported 
that the PTX3 expression in U87-MG cells could be up-regulated by 
transcription factor JUN [93]. 
Interestingly, pneumolysin could increase PTX3 expression in human 
alveolar epithelial A549 cells via the JNK/MAPK pathway [94]. Ator­
vastatin reduces the synthesis and secretion of PTX3 in HUVECs and 
human aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMCs) without effect on PTX3 
expression in human monocytes [95]. Dexamethasone could enhance 
the mRNA and protein expression of PTX3 in HASMCs [19]. Gemcita­
bine up-regulates the expression of PTX3 in human lung cancer A549 
and SPCA1 cell lines, which is mediated by reactive oxygen species 
(ROS), NF-κB, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1ɑ (HIF-1ɑ) [96]. The single 
or combined stimulation of inorganic arsenic (iAs) and fluoride (F) have 
been reported to up-regulate PTX3 expression in HUVECs [97]. Palmitic

acid increases PTX3 expression at the protein and mRNA levels in 
HUVECs via IKK/IκB/NF-κB signaling pathway, which could be inhibi­
ted by honokiol [98]. Interestingly, modified atherogenic lipoproteins 
increase PTX3 expression in human arterial smooth muscle cells [99]. 
High-density lipoproteins (HDL)-induced PTX3 mRNA expression and 
protein secretion in endothelial cells depend on the activation of the 
PI3K/Akt pathway [100]. Besides, the hypoxic condition contributes to 
the up-regulation of PTX3 in the microenvironment of human mammary 
invasive carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) [101,102]. In 
older adults, aerobic training could down-regulate the expression of 
PTX3 in PBMCs [103]. The mechanical cyclic stretch of 20% elongation 
has been proved to increase the mRNA and protein expression of PTX3 in 
human alveolar epithelial A549 cells [104]. 
Thus, the expression level of PTX3 could be regulated by factors at 
the gene level (miRNA) and at the cellular level (cytokines, transcription 
factors, toxins, drugs, stress, etc.), and the complex regulatory network 
needs to be fully deciphered. 
5. Biological activities of PTX3 
5.1. PTX3 in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival 
PTX3 may have a dual (pro- and anti-) role on cell proliferation, and 
the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are unknown and remain to be 
investigated. Knockdown of PTX3, without significant effect on the 
apoptosis of human glomerular mesangial cells(HMCs), could suppress 
the proliferation of HMCs via MAPK pathways [105]. The inhibition of 
PTX3 negatively affected osteoblast proliferation and their ability to 
form cell clusters and microhydroxyapatite crystals [75]. MiR-29 could 
promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis and steroidogenesis of goat 
granulosa cells by targeting PTX3 via activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
and Erk1/2 signaling pathways [106]. Heavy chain-hyaluronic acid 
(HC-HA)/PTX3 
dose-dependently 
suppressed 
proliferation 
and 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of stimulated ARPE-19 cells by 
down-regulating Wnt (β-catenin, LEF1) and TGF-β (Smad2/3, collagen 
type I, ɑ-SMA) signaling, respectively [107]. A deficiency of PTX3 could 
augment vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation after vascular injury 
[108]. IL-1β-induced PTX3 could inhibit the proliferation, cell cycle, and 
invasion of HTR-8/SV neo and JEG3 cells in preeclampsia [109]. 
A host of studies have proved that PTX3 could facilitate cell differ­
entiation in different ways. PTX3 promotes the osteoblastic differenti­
ation of MC3T3-E1 cells via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway [110]. 
Exogenous PTX3 could shape osteoclast differentiation indirectly by 
increasing the RANKL production of precursor osteoblasts(pOBs) [111]. 
PTX3 could stimulate mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) adipogenesis via 
the ERK signaling pathway [112]. Besides, PTX3 enhances adipocyte 
differentiation and lipid synthesis through neuropeptide Y(NPY)/neur­
opeptide Y receptor (NPYR) signaling [113]. PTX3 could promote 
human and murine fibrocyte differentiation by an Fcγ receptor I 
(FcγRI)-dependent mechanism [114]. PTX3 facilitates cardiac differen­
tiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) via the JNK signaling 
pathway [115]. However, contrary to the findings mentioned above, 
High concentrations of PTX3 may suppress endothelial progenitor cell 
(EPC) differentiation in vitro [116]. 
Notably, PTX3 may have a positive impact on cell survival. PTX3 
knockdown promoted fibroblast cell death characterized by apoptosis 
and necrosis [117]. The PTX3 overexpression enhances the viability and 
suppresses the apoptosis of H9c2 cardiomyocytes [83]. Representative 
micrographs and quantification of TUNEL staining showed that PTX3 
reduced A23187-induced apoptosis in HK-2 cells [118]. The 
pro-apoptotic markers tested in the brain tissues of mice with Parkin­
son’s disease following human recombinant PTX3(hrPTX3) treatment 
showed that hrPTX3 could prevent apoptosis and degeneration of the 
dopaminergic neurons [119]. 
5.2. PTX3 in the regulation of innate immunity 
PTX3 is a crucial mediator in innate immunity against selected 
pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi [120,121]. Human and 
murine PTX3 could bind to certain influenza virus strains and mediate a 
host of antiviral activities, including inhibition of hemagglutination, 
neutralization of virus infectivity, and inhibition of viral neuraminidase 
[69]. However, desialylated PTX3 is not recognized by the HAG of 
influenza virus and thus loses its antiviral activity [69]. Interestingly, 
PTX3 could act as an opsonin to promote microbial recognition and 
phagocytosis by macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils in a 
complement, complement receptor, and FcγR dependent way [20,62, 
122,123]. It was also reported that PTX3 could facilitate phagocytosis in 
Ig-depleted serum, demonstrating that the opsonization of PTX3 is in­
dependent of Ig [65]. PTX3 induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa-derived 
GroEL promoted the phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus into macro­
phages [124]. Besides, PTX3 could bind to the conidia of Aspergillus 
fumigatus, and higher fungal susceptibility of PTX3-null mice was asso­
ciated with defective conidia recognition by alveolar macrophages and 
dendritic cells [122]. Notably, FcγRIIA/CD32 is crucial for the opsonic 
role of PTX3 towards Aspergillus fumigatus [62]. Zymosan(Zy) is a par­
ticle that derives from yeast and consists mainly of β-glucan and mannan 
[125]. Zy could activate the phagocytic, cytotoxic, and antimicrobial 
activities of macrophages [20,126]. It has been proved that PTX3 could 
bind to Zy particles and yeast cells of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis [20]. 
On this basis, Diniz et al. proposed a model to explain the opsonic ac­
tivity of PTX3 in dectin-1-dependent internalization of Zy by macro­
phages[20](Fig. 2A). On the one hand, PTX3 could result in Zy 
aggregation for activation of macrophages by binding to Zy [20]. On the 
other hand, in the presence of PTX3, the cell membranes of macrophages 
express higher levels of dectin-1 to internalize Zy particles, suggesting 
that PTX3 may up-regulate the expression of dectin-1 in an indirect way 
[20]. In addition, the opsonization of PTX3 has an inhibitory effect on 
the internalization of apoptotic cells by antigen-presenting dendritic 
cells, which might prevent the onset of autoimmune reactions in 
inflamed tissues [127]. 
PTX3 exerts regulatory roles in complement activation by interacting 
with components and regulators of different complement pathways 
(Fig. 2B). Notably, PTX3 has a dual role in activating the classical 
complement pathway by binding C1q [21]. C1q with PTX3 immobilized 
on plastic wells (a situation that mimics PTX3 bound to a microbial 
surface) induces the activation of the classical complement pathway 
with the increased C3 and C4 deposition [128]. Conversely, in the fluid 
phase, the interaction between PTX3 and C1q inhibits classical com­
plement cascade by competitively blocking relevant interaction sites 
[128]. Furthermore, PTX3 interacts with components of the lectin 
pathway, including ficolin-1, ficolin-2, and mannose-binding lectin 
(MBL) [66,129,130]. The binding of ficolin-1 to PTX3 could trigger the 
lectin complement pathway activation as measured by C4b deposition 
[129]. PTX3 and ficolin-2 may recruit each other on the surface of 
Aspergillus fumigatus and synergistically enhance ficolin-2-mediated 
complement deposition [130]. MBL-PTX3 complex not only recruits 
C1q but also enhances C4, C3 deposition, and the phagocytosis of 
Candida albicans by polymorphonuclear leukocytes [66]. The interaction 
between MBL and PTX3 results in communication between the lectin 
and classical complement pathways via recruitment of C1q, which in­
duces cross-activation of the complement system [66]. 
PTX3 also interacts with C4b-binding protein (C4BP), the regulator 
of classical and lectin pathways, on biological surfaces of late apoptotic 
cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) [131]. The binding of C4BP to 
apoptotic cells could be enhanced by PTX3, leading to an increased rate 
of C4b inactivation and reduction in the deposition of the C5b-9 complex 
[131]. PTX3 also interacts with FH, the primary regulator of the alter­
native complement pathway, on late apoptotic cells [65]. Notably, PTX3 
could modulate the alternative complement pathway via facilitating FH 
deposition on PTX3-coated apoptotic cells and enhancing C3b 
H. Zhang et al.

6
inactivation [65]. Therefore, PTX3 prevents excessive complement 
activation on apoptotic cells and cell lysis by recruiting complement 
inhibitors C4BP and FH to apoptotic cells [65,131,132]. Compared to 
native PTX3, enzymatic removal of sialic acid or the entire glycosidic 
moiety of PTX3 could equally enhance the binding of PTX3 to C1q [67]. 
Considering that the glycosylation pattern of PTX3 is highly variable, 
the glycosidic moiety of PTX3 might be useful in regulating PTX3-C1q 
interaction and fine-tuning both the activating and inhibitory activ­
ities on the classical complement pathway [67,68]. However, compared 
to native PTX3, enzymatically deglycosylated PTX3 bound weaklier to 
the full-length FH, suggesting that glycosylation is crucial for the sta­
bilization of the PTX3-FH interaction [65]. Therefore, it’s noteworthy 
that glycosylation on Asn 220 of PTX3 could modulate the interaction of 
PTX3 with components and regulators of complement pathways, thus 
regulating complement activation. 
Interestingly, PTX3 could be secreted by neutrophils surrounded by 
the splenic marginal zone (MZ) [133].PTX3 binds to MZ B cells inde­
pendent of TLR4 and FcγRs, facilitating IgM and class-switched IgG 
antibody production from MZ B cells in response to microbial capsular 
polysaccharides (CPS) [133]. Therefore, PTX3, an MZ B cells helper, 
could be a link between humoral innate and adaptive immune systems 
[133]. Besides, previous studies have revealed the critical role of PTX3 
in the activity of macrophages (Fig. 2C). Increased PTX3 expression 
regulated by miR-224–5p deficiency could promote M1 macrophage 
polarization and aggravate osteoarthritis by targeting CD32 and acti­
vating the p-p65/NF-κB pathway [134]. However, in an osteoarthritis 
rat model, PTX3 secreted by SMUP-Cells could polarize macrophages 
from M1 to M2 phenotype at the injury site and reduce osteoarthritis 
pain [135]. Moreover, PTX3 alleviates renal damage in diabetic ne­
phropathy via facilitating M2 macrophage differentiation [136]. In a 
hyperoxic lung injury rat model, PTX3 secreted by human umbilical 
cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells(UCB-MSCs) under inflam­
matory conditions could promote M2 macrophage polarization via the 
Dectin-1 receptor by enhancing the phosphorylation of MSK1/2 in 
NR8383 cells [137]. However, PTX3 was also reported to decrease the 
expression of IL-4 and IL-10 by inhibiting phosphorylation of JNK1/2 in 
gastric cancer cells, thus suppressing the M2 macrophage polarization 
and leading to the inhibition of milky spots metastasis of gastric cancer 
[138]. 
Furthermore, the enlightenment of the formation of NETs as a part of 
the innate immune system sheds new insights into the pathologies of 
various diseases. NETs are large web-like structures composed of a 
decondensed chromatin scaffold with associated cytosolic and granule 
proteins [139]. It could trap different types of pathogens, facilitating 
their interaction with effector molecules and ultimately resulting in the 
clearance of pathogens [140]. NETs also participate in the progression of 
various pathophysiological conditions and diseases, such as innate im­
munity, thrombosis, atherosclerosis, autoimmune diseases, and cancer 
[140–144]. In response to microbial recognition and inflammatory 
regulators, PTX3 is rapidly released by specific granules of neutrophils 
and localizes in NETs formed by DNA extrusion from viable neutrophils 
[79] (Fig. 2D). Azurocidin (AZU1) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), two 
bactericidal proteins associated with NETs, could interact with PTX3 to 
form complexes [22]. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed a partial 
co-localization of AZU1 and PTX3 in NETs [22]. Further research sug­
gests that PTX3 is partially co-localized with neutrophil granular

ization and related pathological processes. D. PTX3 co-localizes with some components in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and may be a regulator of NETs.

7
components, including MPO, AZU1, gelatinase, and lactoferrin, on the 
surface of NETs [145]. Therefore, PTX3 could be a potential component 
of NETs [146] and may synergistically exert an anti-microbial role with 
other NET components. Extracellular histones are also significant com­
ponents of NETs [147], which are toxic to both microbes and host cells 
[23]. Polyvalent interactions and unfolding of the α-helix of PTX3 could 
result in histone-PTX3 aggregate formation, enabling PTX3 to bind to 
histones rapidly and irreversibly [148]. In sepsis, the coag­
gregation/interaction of PTX3 and histone could inhibit the cytotoxicity 
of histones towards endothelial cells by preventing the interaction be­
tween histones and endothelial cells [148]. Therefore, PTX3 may 
involve regulating NETs by weakening the adverse effects of extracel­
lular histones on NETs [23]. 
Therefore, PTX3 may involve in the regulation of innate immunity by 
exerting opsonic role, modulating complement activation and the NETs. 
Besides, it could link the humoral arms of the innate immunity and 
adaptive immunity by binding to MZ B cells. Notably, above-mentioned 
properties of PTX3 are crucial for its anti-pathogenic roles. 
5.3. PTX3 in the regulation of inflammation 
PTX3 might be an anti-inflammatory factor under specific condi­
tions. Vitro stimulation of human PBMCs with PTX3 increased the pro­
duction of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, while the production of the 
pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-ɑ was not affected 
[149]. Exogenous PTX3 reduced the LPS-induced production of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-ɑ, and monocytes chemo­
attractant protein 1 (MCP-1, also named CCL2) and induced active 
TGF-β production in THP-1 cells [150]. In a model of murine hepatitis 
virus 1(MHV-1)-induced lung injury, administration of recombinant 
PTX3 significantly increased viral clearance, dampened MHV-1-induced 
lung injury, and reduced early neutrophil influx and elevation of the 
inflammatory cytokines in the lung [151]. In an ovalbumin-induced 
asthma model, PTX3-deficient mice have augmented mucus produc­
tion, IL-17A-dominant pulmonary inflammation, and airway hyper­
responsiveness [152]. Further, PTX3 deficiency increases the infiltration 
and activity of CD11c+CD11b+ dendritic cells in the lung, aggravating 
airway inflammatory responses [39]. In an LPS-induced acute lung 
injury(ALI) model, PTX3 deficiency could also augment intrapulmonary 
LPS-induced tissue factor expression/activation and up-regulate the 
plasma levels of TNF-ɑ and MCP-1 [153]. In a postischemic acute kidney 
injury model, PTX3-deficient mice showed increased TNF and IL-6 
mRNA expression and aggravated neutrophil and macrophage infiltra­
tion into the postischemic kidney [154]. 
PTX3 could protect against sustained inflammation in adipose tissue 
by modulating NF-κB and p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) signaling pathway 
activation [155]. In the CLP-induced murine sepsis model and 
LPS-induced cell inflammation model, PTX3 reduced inflammatory re­
sponses and intestinal mucosal barrier damage through the TLR 
signaling 
pathway 
[156]. 
Notably, 
PTX3 
could 
restrain 
complement-mediated inflammation during granuloma formation 
[157]. In a chemical carcinogenesis model, PTX3 deficiency was asso­
ciated with increased cancer-related inflammation due to a defect of 
complement regulation [158]. Interestingly, PTX3 could bind to the 
adhesion molecule P-selectin, but not E-selectin and L-selectin [64]. In 
the pleurisy or ALI model, PTX3 derived from activated leukocytes or 
exogenous administration could dampen neutrophils’ recruitment at 
inflamed sites by interacting with P-selectin [64]. Notably, enzymatic 
deglycosylation of PTX3 and site-directed mutagenesis of its Asn220 
contributed to a 70 % reduction of PTX3-P-selectin interaction, sug­
gesting that the glycosidic moiety of PTX3 may meditate its regulatory 
role on inflammation [64]. Besides, PTX3 could bind to MD-2 and thus 
activates the anti-inflammatory TLR4/TRIF signaling pathway, resulting 
in the decreased inflammatory burden following fungal infection [61]. 
However, PTX3 was also reported to have a pro-inflammatory effect. 
In BV-2 cells treated with Aβ, PTX3 knockdown has an inhibitory effect 
on the production of inflammatory proteins and cytokines (TNF, IL-1b, 
IL-6, CD86, iNOS, and COX-2), and the phosphorylation of IκBα [159]. 
In a model of murine ischemic AKI, compared to wild type (WT) mice, 
PTX3 knockout mice had reduced endothelial expression of cell adhe­
sion molecules at 4 h of reperfusion, possibly leading to a decreased 
early maladaptive inflammation in kidneys [160]. In an intestinal 
ischemia and reperfusion model, PTX3 deficient mice showed decreased 
neutrophil influx, reduced production of CXCL1, TNF-ɑ, and reduced 
lethality [161]. In another intestinal ischemia and reperfusion model, 
PTX3-overexpressed mice were observed with increased neutrophil 
influx, up-regulated expression of TNF-ɑ, IL-1β, CCL2, and CXCL1, and 
reduced survival rate [162]. PTX3 silencing could suppress LPS-induced 
inflammation and MUC5AC production via the inhibition of the 
PI3K/Akt pathway [163]. Moreover, PTX3 could interact with outer 
membrane protein A from Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpOmpA) [164], a 
pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) from the outer mem­
brane protein (OMP) family [165]. OmpA, recognized by monocytes and 
DCs, could induce a TLR2-dependent pro-inflammatory response [165] 
that promotes PTX3 production, while PTX3 binds to OmpA and en­
hances the pro-inflammatory response in turn [164]. OmpA-induced 
inflammation was significantly reduced in PTX3-deficient mice, and 
administration of exogenous PTX3 restores partial inflammatory 
response [164]. Besides, complement activation is involved in 
PTX3-mediated enhancement of OmpA-induced pro-inflammatory 
response [166]. 
Therefore, PTX3 may involve in the regulation of inflammation by 
modulating the levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, influ­
encing 
inflammatory 
cell 
infiltration, 
and 
interacting 
with 
inflammation-associated ligands, which closely correlates with its reg­
ulatory roles on complement activation. 
5.4. PTX3 in angiogenesis and thrombosis 
Angiogenesis is a process of forming new blood vessels from pre- 
existing vessels, which exerts an essential role in inflammation, wound 
healing, embryogenesis, and tumorigenesis [167]. The balance between 
pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors is crucial for angiogenesis 
[168]. Several FGF family members, such as FGF 1–5, 7, 8b, 9, 10, have 
been proved to possess the angiogenic property in some pathophysio­
logical conditions [57]. PTX3 could exert an anti-angiogenic role by 
interacting with certain FGF family members. FGF-2 is a prototypic 
heparin-binding angiogenic growth factor that facilitates neo­
vascularization in wound healing and inflammatory responses [57]. As 
mentioned above, the PTX3 octamer has two independent FGF-2 binding 
sites in the N-terminal domain [56]. PTX3 and FGF-2 could bind to each 
other independent of their free or ECM-immobilized status [25], and 
PTX3 prevents FGF-2 from binding to heparan-sulfate proteoglycans 
(HSPGs) and tyrosine kinase FGF receptors (FGFRs) in the surface of 
endothelial cells, leading to the inhibition of angiogenic property of 
FGF-2 [25]. Both exogenous and endogenous PTX3 could inhibit the 
FGF-2-induced autocrine stimulation loop in endothelial cells, thus 
inhibiting cell migration, proliferation, and morphogenesis in angio­
genesis [25]. In addition, PTX3 prevents FGF-2 from binding to FGFRs 
on human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs) for inhibi­
tion of angiogenesis [169]. Specifically, exogenously administrated 
PTX3 inhibits FGF-2-induced proliferation and chemotaxis of HCASMCs, 
while endogenously overexpressed PTX3 suppresses FGF-2-induced 
proliferation and survival of HCASMCs [169]. Compared to exogenous 
PTX3, endogenously overexpressed PTX3 exhibits a more potent role in 
inhibiting FGF-2-induced angiogenesis [169]. Interestingly, TSG-6 could 
revert the inhibitory effects exerted by PTX3 on FGF-2-mediated 
angiogenesis via the competition of PTX3/FGF-2 interaction [59]. 
FGF-8b has the most potent angiogenic and tumorigenic abilities in 
all FGF-8 isoforms and is detected with high expression in breast, 
prostate, and ovarian cancers [170,171]. PTX3 binds to FGF-8b with 
high affinity and prevents it from binding to FGFR1 (IIIc), thus 
H. Zhang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy 156 (2022) 113783
8
inhibiting FGF-8b-induced ERK1/2 activation, cell proliferation, and 
chemotactic migration of endothelial cells [60]. PTX3 also significantly 
suppresses the FGF-8b-induced neovascularization in vivo [60]. So far, 
there is no evidence of the interaction between PTX3 and two FGF family 
members, FGF-1 and FGF-4 [25]. Furthermore, PTX3 does not affect 
VEGF, EGF, TPA, and DAG-induced endothelial cell proliferation 
because of its limited binding capacity to these meditators [25]. 
PTX3 may exert an anti-thrombotic effect in certain conditions. 
Though the interaction between PTX3 and P-selectin represses neutro­
phils’ recruitment at inflamed sites [64], PTX3 does not affect P-selec­
tin-mediated platelet aggregation [172,173]. However, it was observed 
that the pre-incubation of fibrinogen with PTX3 decreased platelet ag­
gregation in the presence of collagen, which primarily depended on the 
N-terminal region of PTX3 [172]. Similarly, collagen pre-incubation 
with PTX3 repressed platelet aggregation in the presence of fibrin­
ogen, which mainly relied on the C-terminal domain of PTX3 [172]. 
Thus, PTX3 was proposed to localize between the damaged vascular 
endothelium and the thrombi, which could dampen the pro-thrombotic 
effects by reducing fibrinogen and collagen induced platelet aggregation 
[172]. In FeCl3-induced injury models, hrPTX3 treatment prevented 
carotid artery occlusion in PTX3-knockout and WT mice, demonstrating 
a protective role of PTX3 in arterial thrombosis [172]. 
However, several studies showed that PTX3 might play a thrombo­
philic by enhancing TF expression, which is paradoxical to the outcome 
above. PTX3 enhances tissue factor (TF) activity and antigen from LPS- 
stimulated monocytes and LPS-, IL-1β-, and TNF-ɑ-stimulated HUVECs 
in a dose-dependent way [174,175]. The regulation of TF synthesis by 
PTX3 depends on the increased phosphorylation, degradation of IκBɑ, 
and increased migration of c-Rel/p65 into the nucleus [174]. Besides, 
PTX3 dose-dependently reduces the whole blood coagulation time and 
increases TF expression in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells 
(moDCs) under low-shear conditions [176]. 
5.5. PTX3 in tissue remodeling 
It has been reported that innate immunity coordinates a host of 
physiological and pathological processes, contributing to tissue repair 
[177,178]. After tissue injury, PTX3, a component of the humoral arm of 
innate immunity [179], was induced by TLR sensing and IL-1β ampli­
fication, in which MyD88- and TRIF-dependent signaling pathways were 
involved in the process [26]. 
Timely fibrin degradation after fibrin deposition and fibrosis is 
crucial for tissue repair [180,181]. PTX3 could bind to fibrinogen (FG), 
fibrin, and Plg at acidic PH (optimal interaction at PH5.5–6.5) but not at 
neutral PH, and the interaction among PTX3, FG/fibrin and Plg could 
facilitate fibrin degradation [26]. Specifically, the N-terminal domain of 
PTX3 was proved to interact with fibrinogen, fibrin, and Plg, while the 
C-terminal region could only bind to Plg with low affinity [26]. The 
acidic environment needed for binding PTX3 to fibrin and Plg suggests 
that the interaction is restricted to wounding sites and thrombi [26, 
182]. Therefore, the acidic pH could be regarded as a “switch-on” signal 
for the role of PTX3 in fibrolysis [182]. 
Notably, after tissue injury, the conversion of Plg to plasmin is 
crucial for tissue remodeling and removal of blood clot [183]. Mapping 
experiments suggest that PTX3 binds to Plg Kringle 5 domain to initiate 
Plg conformational changes, leading to closed-inactive Plg transition to 
an open form [26, 184–186]. Then the tissue-type Plg activators (t-PAs) 
and urokinase-type Plg activators (u-PAs) could cleave and convert the 
open form of Plg to plasmin [186]. Administering mesenchymal stromal 
cells (MSCs) to acute or chronic wound sites could promote wound 
healing by increasing granulation tissue formation, re-epithelialization, 
and angiogenesis [187]. Activated MSCs could produce, secrete and 
even 
store 
PTX3 
[188,189]. 
Compared 
to 
control 
wounds, 
PTX3-deficient MSC-treated skin wounds had more fibrin deposition, 
indicating impaired pericellular fibrinolysis in PTX3-deficient MSC 
[187]. Due to impaired fibrinolysis, PTX3-deficient MSCs were less 
recruited and invasive at the wound sites, ultimately causing reduced 
granulation tissue formation and delayed wound closure [187]. Inter­
estingly, plasminogen-conversion inhibitors (APR and PAI-1) could 
drastically prevent the fibrinolysis of MSCs, suggesting that a 
plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis mechanism occurred in this model [187]. 
Thus, PTX3 could create an environment that fosters the recruitment of 
MSCs and other remodeling cells [187], depending largely on its role in 
potentiating plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis. 
PTX3 may exert important roles in the synapse formation and repair 
of brain injury. Brain ECM, also named perineural network (PNN), is 
crucial in the stability and mobility of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) as well 
as synapse development [190,191]. PTX3 promotes the remodeling of 
PNN by the β1-containing integrin-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which 
induces the recruitment of postsynaptic AMPARs and enhances excit­
atory synaptic activity [190]. Besides, after ischemic brain injury, 
compared to WT mice, PTX3 knockout mice showed impaired glial scar 
formation and extracellular matrix deposition [192]. Furthermore, after 
ischemic/traumatic brain injury, PTX3 could promote neurogenesis 
both in vivo and in vitro [193,194]. 
Bone remodeling includes timely and concordant bone resorption 
and bone formation induced by mechanical forces and microfractures, 
regulated by a host of cytokines, prostaglandins, and growth factors 
[195,196]. PTX3 expression was positively correlated with bone density 
and the proliferation and maturation of osteoblast, suggesting that PTX3 
acts as a promoter of bone deposition and plays a crucial role in normal 
bone homeostasis [75]. In the fracture healing process, PTX3 expression 
was detected during both the early (inflammatory) phases and the late 
(regenerative) phases [195]. During the reparative phase of the fracture 
healing process, compared to PTX3-sufficient mice, PTX3-deficient mice 
had reduced callus mineralization and decreased expression of type I 
collagen (Col1) [195]. Notably, in the early stages after fracture, the 
osteoprogenitor population composed of non-hematopoietic/non- 
endothelial cells could induce the expression of both PTX3 and FGF-2 
[195]. During bone formation, the N-terminal domain of PTX3 in­
teracts with FGF-2 to reverse the anti-differentiation effect of FGF-2, 
which is significant for unlocking osteoblast maturation [195]. Be­
sides, PTX3 was reported to promote osteogenic differentiation in an in 
vitro inflammatory environment by activating the HA/CD44/FAK/AKT 
positive feedback loop, and facilitate bone regeneration after peri­
odontitis [197]. 
PTX3 could be regarded as an essential molecule in regulating 
ovarian functions and female fertility [27]. In preovulatory follicles, 
PTX3 is secreted by cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte under the 
stimulation of LH or hCG [27]. PTX3 could not directly interact with 
hyaluronic acid (HA), while it could bind to TSG-6 and HCs of IαI [58, 
76]. PTX3 was proposed to potentially stabilize the HA network by 
interacting with some HCs that covalently bond to HA molecules [27,58, 
198]. Additionally, TSG-6 and IαI critically regulate the activity of PTX3 
in the HA-rich ECM [199]. Therefore, PTX3 in the cumulus HA-rich 
matrix is crucial for cumulus matrix stability and female fertility [27]. 
Besides, after ovulation, endothelial and stromal cells of the corpus 
luteum could express PTX3, which may involve in vasculature involu­
tion during the regression of the corpus luteum by binding to FGF-2 and 
inhibiting the pro-angiogenic activity of FGF-2 [27, 200–202]. Notably, 
PTX3, trapping FGF2 from undifferentiated stromal cells, was identified 
as a critical Menin-H3K4me3 regulated downstream gene in decidual 
regionalization and pregnancy maintenance by inhibiting the cross-talk 
between FGF2-ERK1/2 and BMP2 [203]. 
Together, these studies demonstrate that PTX3 is broadly involved in 
tissue remodeling and repair, a function that depends on recognition of 
matrix molecules, highlighting the link and interaction between hemo­
stasis and immunity [182]. Besides, considering its beneficial effects on 
fertilization and pregnancy maintenance, PTX3 could be regarded as a 
promising therapeutic target for female infertility.

6. PTX3 in oncogenesis 
The over-expression of PTX3 has been observed in multiple types of 
tumors, including pancreatic carcinoma [37], head and neck squamous 
cell carcinoma (HNSCC) [204], gastric cancer [205], breast cancer [28], 
cervical cancer [36], glioma [32], liposarcoma [34], prostate cancer 
[29,206], lung cancer [30], melanoma [33], multiple myeloma (MM) 
[207], hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) [31], colorectal carcinoma 
[208], diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [209], clear cell renal cell 
carcinoma (ccRCC) [210], and ovarian epithelial cancer [211] (Table 2). 
However, some tumor types also showed a reduction in PTX3 expression 
levels, such as gastric cancer [212], esophageal squamous cell carci­
noma [213], prostate cancer [214], and bladder cancer [215]. Increased 
PTX3 expression level is significantly related to tumor stages or grades of 
cervical cancer [36], glioma [32], and lung cancer [30]. In addition, 
PTX3 is proved as the prognostic indicator in patients with pancreatic 
carcinoma [37], breast cancer [28], glioma [32], lung cancer [216], 
HCC [31], colorectal carcinoma [208], DLBCL [209], ccRCC [210], 
ovarian epithelial cancer [211]. 
6.1. Pro-tumorigenic role of PTX3 
EGF promotes the PTX3 expression in HNSCC cell lines by activating 
PI3K/Akt- and NF-κB pathways [204]. In PTX3-deficient HNSCC cells, 
EGF-induced expression of metastatic molecules, fibronectin, and matrix 
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were repressed [204]. Additionally, 
oleate could promote the PTX3 expression in the HNSCC cells via 
AKT/NF-κB pathway [217]. PTX3 derived from oleate-induced auto­
crine production could up-regulate the expression of EMT markers, 
MMP-3, and vimentin, which enhances the cell communications be­
tween 
tumor 
cells 
and 
endothelial 
cells 
to 
promote 
the 
dyslipidemia-mediated HNSCC metastatic seeding in lung [217]. Be­
sides, TNF-α-induced PTX3 could promote the migration of human 
gastric cancer HTB135 cells, enhance the chemotaxis of macrophages 
and the binding of macrophages to HTB135 cells [205]. PTX3 secreted 
by melanoma cells promotes the invasion and migration of melanoma by 
TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway [33] (Fig. 3A). PTX3 upregulation 
induced by a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) through the 
TrkB signaling pathway stimulates the interaction between bone meta­
static gastric cancer cells and OBs, enhancing the osteolysis of bone 
metastatic gastric cancer [212]. 
PI3K activation up-regulates the PTX3 expression in basal-like breast 
cancer (BLBC) cells by AKT- and NF-κB-dependent signaling pathways, 
and PTX3 could promote cancer stem cell-like traits in BLBC [28]. SH3 
domain-containing ring finger 3 (SH3RF3), a scaffold protein with E3 
ligase activity [218], facilitates the cancer stem cell-like properties in 
breast cancer by up-regulating the expression of PTX3 via the JNK-JUN 
pathway [219]. Besides, knockdown of PTX3 has been proved to sup­
press cell proliferation in glioma GBM8401 cells by inducing G0/G1 cell 
cycle arrest [32]. Inhibition of PTX3 also curbs the invasion and 
migration of GBM8401 cells by down-regulating the expression of 
MMP-1 and MMP-2 [32]. In addition, knockdown of PTX3 reduces cell 
viability and colony-forming ability of cervical cancer cells, SiHa and 
HeLa [36]. Knockdown of PTX3 in SiHa and HeLa cell lines decreases the 
expression of cyclin B1, cdc2, and cdc25c and enhances the expression of 
p-cdc2, p-cdc25c, p21, and p27, indicating that PTX3 silencing could 
induce cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase [36]. Knockdown of PTX3 also 
suppresses the migration and invasion of SiHa and HeLa cells by 
down-regulating MMP-2, MMP-9, and urokinase Plg activator (uPA) 
[36]. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the Akt/NF-κB signaling 
could up-regulate the expression of PTX3, and the increased PTX3 
expression facilitates cell proliferation and inhibits the cell apoptosis in 
A549 and H1299 cell lines [220]. Besides, PTX3 over-expression en­
hances the EMT process and promotes proliferation, invasion, and 
metastasis of Huh7 HCC cells [31]. On the contrary, knockout of PTX3 
shows the opposite results in MHCC97h HCC cells [31]. 
In human esophageal carcinoma KYSE450 cells, PTX3 knockout 
arrested cells in G0/G1 phase, suppressed cell proliferation, and pro­
moted cell apoptosis [221]. PTX3-knockout KYSE450 cells also had 
lower migration ability and higher sensitivity to chemotherapy and 
radiotherapy [221]. Interestingly, after PTX3 was knocked out, the cell 
glycolysis ability was impaired, while the oxidative phosphorylation 
capacity tended to be enhanced in KYSE450 cells [221]. Chemothera­
peutic drugs (Doxorubicin)-induced up-regulation of small extracellular 
vesicles (sEV) secretion and sEV-associated PTX3 expression was re­
ported to promote the metastasis of breast cancer [222]. Further, 
Cisplatin (CDDP) or 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) could induce the 
up-regulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (CEBPD). At 
the same time, CEBPD could increase the expression of PTX3 by binding 
to its promoter region to activate its transcription in M2 macrophages 
and myofibroblasts/cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) [70]. Recom­
binant PTX3 proteins purified from insect cells (bvPTX3) promoted 
CEBPD-mediated sphere formation, anticancer-drug resistance, and 
migration/invasion of human breast cancer MB231/mcCDRMB231 cells 
[70]. However, the recombinant bvPTX3 mutant of Asn220 (mbvPTX3) 
could attenuate bvPTX3-induced stemness, drug resistance, and migra­
tion/invasion of breast cancer cells, suggesting that the glycosylation 
status of PTX3 is crucial for its tumorigenic role [70]. Besides, Hsiao 
et al. found that TGF-β1 induced PTX3 expression via activating CEBPD 
in stromal fibroblasts [223]. PTX3 could directly interact with CD44, 
which activates the downstream ERK1/2, AKT, and NF-κB signaling 
pathways, leading to the metastasis, invasion, and stemness of 
MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells [223] (Fig. 3B). 
6.2. Anti-tumorigenic role of PTX3 
As mentioned above, the N-terminal domain of PTX3 interacts with 
certain members of the FGF family (FGF-2 and FGF-8b) to inhibit their 
pro-angiogenetic 
activity 
[56,60]. 
Dihydrotestosterone 
(DHT) 
up-regulates the expression of FGF-2 and FGF-8b, thus activating an 
FGF-induced 
autocrine 
loop 
of 
stimulation 
[60,214]. 
The 
over-expression of PTX3 suppresses the tumor proliferation triggered by 
DHT or FGFs in prostate cancer cell line TRAMP-C2 and breast cancer

cell line S115 [60,214]. In addition, the angiogenic and tumorigenic 
abilities were suppressed in PTX3 overexpressed TRAMP-C2 cells [214]. 
Besides, PTX3 inhibited the tumorigenic and metastatic activities in 
human and murine melanoma cells, which agreed with the inhibitory 
effect on FGF/FGFR-driven EMT [224]. Further, the overexpression of 
PTX3 markedly reduced the proliferative and tumorigenic activity of 
fibrosarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo [225]. Notably, PTX3 inhibits 
FGF2-dependent angiogenesis in MM and has an indirect cytotoxic role 
on MM cells by repressing the cross-talk between the plasma cells and 
endothelial cells/fibroblasts in the bone marrow of MM patients [207]. 
Increased proliferation, clonogenicity, and anchorage-independent 
growth capacity were observed in PTX3-deficient RT4 bladder cancer 
cells, with enhanced phosphorylation of FGFR, FRS2, and ERK1/2 pro­
teins [215]. Correspondingly, PTX3 over-expression could reduce pro­
liferation, clonogenicity, motility/wound repair capacity of 5637 cells, 
and clonogenicity of HT1376 cells, with reduced phosphorylation of 
FGFR and FRS2 [215]. PTX3 silencing also markedly increased the 
sphere formation capacity of RT4-shPTX3 cells and the percentage of 
ALDH+cells in RT4-shPTX3 cells [215]. Moreover, compared to 
RT4-shNT cells, PTX3 silencing in RT4-shPTX3 cells up-regulated the 
expression of stemness markers (NANOG, OCT4, and CD47) and 
stemness-associated multidrug resistance genes (ABCG2 and ABCB1) 
[215]. In PTX3-overexpressing 5637 cells, the Seahorse Mito Stress Test 
showed decreased cellular respiration and glycolysis that was accom­
panied by a reduced production of ATP [215]. Besides, recent research 
demonstrated that PTX3 was down-regulated by TNF-ɑ in gastric cancer 
cell lines, BGC-823 and SGC-7901, leading to increased invasion and 
metastasis of gastric cancer [226]. 
The cellular effectors and mediators of inflammatory responses are 
considered a part of the tumor microenvironment [227]. PTX3 could be 
produced under the stimulation of inflammatory factors and involves in 
the regulation of inflammation and innate immunity [182,228,229]. 
PTX3 deficiency increased the susceptibility to tumor development in 
the models of 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MCA)-induced sarcoma 
(mesenchymal tumor) and 7,12-dimethylbenz [α] anthracene/tereph­
thalic acid (DMBA/TPA)-induced skin cancer (epithelial tumor) [158]. 
In the murine 3-MCA induced sarcoma model, PTX3 was mainly induced 
by IL-1 [158], of which the deficiency was associated with increased 
macrophage infiltration, higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
TNF-ɑ, IL-1b, IL-6, chemokine CCL2, and angiogenesis factor VEGF 
[158]. In addition, PTX3 deficiency unleashed uncontrolled comple­
ment activation with C5a production due to the deficient FH recruit­
ment, which subsequently induced the production of chemokine [158, 
230]. CCL2 could induce M2-type macrophage polarization [231]. Be­
sides, M2-like markers (Ym1, Fizz1, Arg-1, Il10, Mcr1, and Nos2) were 
more expressed in MHC IIhigh and MHC IIlow macrophages and mono­
cytes in PTX3-deficient mice compared to WT mice [158]. Therefore, 
CCL2 may be downstream of direct complement activation with C5a 
production 
and 
recruit 
skewed 
M2-like 
cancer-promoting 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in PTX3- deficient hosts [158]. 
Altogether, PTX3 could act as an extrinsic oncosuppressor gene in mice 
and men by regulating complement-dependent, macrophage-sustained, 
tumor-promoting inflammation [158]. 
DNA methylation is crucial for developing almost all types of tumors 
[232]. In most esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines, 
the gene promoter hypermethylation led to the down-regulated PTX3 
[213]. In 20 paired samples of ESCC tumor tissues and adjacent non­
tumor tissues, 80 % of ESCC tumor tissue samples had statistically 
different PTX3 promoter region methylation, whereas only 20% of 
paired adjacent nontumor tissues exhibited [213]. Besides, PTX3 pro­
moter hypermethylation more frequently occurred in the early stages (I 
and II) of ESCC in comparison to advanced stages [213]. Similarly, in 
Fig. 3. PTX3 interacts with receptors to promote the migration and invasion of tumors. A. Autocrine/paracrine PTX3 promotes melanoma migration and invasion by 
TLR4/ NF-κB /TWIST1 axis. B. TGF-β1 induces PTX3 expression by activating CEBPD in breast cancer-associated fibroblasts (BCAFs). BCAF-derived PTX3 directly 
interacts with CD44 to activate ERK1/2, AKT, and NF-κB signaling pathways, contributing to the migration, invasion, and stemness of triple-negative breast cancer 
cells. PTX3 antibodies and shortened PTX3 peptides could disrupt the PTX3/CD44 interaction and restrict the metastasis, invasion, and stemness of TNBC. Besides, 
PTX3 could activate the JNK, S6K, and p38 MAPK pathways by CD44–independent regulation. ER: endoplasmic reticulum; EMT: epithelial-mesenchymal transition; 
CEBPD: CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta.

selected human tumors (leiomyosarcoma, colorectal cancer, and skin 
squamous cell carcinoma), the transcriptional silencing of PTX3 could 
be partially attributed to hypermethylation in promoter and a CpG is­
land located in a putative enhancer encompassing exon 2 [158]. 
Overall, PTX3 may be a crucial molecule in oncogenesis due to its 
regulatory roles in angiogenesis, cancer-related inflammation, and other 
properties of tumor cells (proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, 
stemness, metabolic fitness, and drug resistance). Importantly, PTX3 
could be seen as a double-edged sword in oncogenesis, depending on its 
cellular source, tumor types, and tumor microenvironment [14]. More in 
vitro and in vivo studies are expected to comprehensively clarify its dual 
role in cancer. 
7. PTX3 in non-cancerous diseases 
7.1. Cardiovascular diseases 
7.1.1. Atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, 
arteritis 
Immunohistochemistry results showed that PTX3 was positively 
expressed in macrophages and PMN cells which infiltrated the athero­
sclerotic lesions [11,233] (Table 3). Some studies have reported that 
PTX3 participates in the development of atherosclerotic plaque. Still, 
biases exist in part of these studies due to the small sample size and the 
lack of prospective assessment [234]. However, based on two surveys 
with a large sample size (the Bruneck Study and the PLIC Study), Bar­
agetti et al. concluded that plasma PTX3 level couldn’t be used as an 
independent marker to predict the progression of subclinical athero­
sclerosis and incident cardiovascular events [235]. Besides, PTX3 has 
atheroprotective effects in mice [236]. Therefore, the roles of PTX3 in 
atherosclerosis remain to be further investigated. 
Compared with low circulating PTX3 levels, high PTX3 levels 
correlate with a higher risk of poor outcomes in coronary artery disease 
patients [237]. Besides, compared to high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), 
PTX3 may be a better predictor of peripheral artery disease in patients 
treated with hemodialysis [238]. A meta-analysis found that compared 
to CRP, PTX3 performed better in Takayasu arteritis (TAK) activity 
assessment [239]. However, it should be cautious when PTX3 is used to 
assess TAK clinically, considering the high heterogeneity and potential 
publication bias in the present study [239]. Elevated circulating PTX3 
levels could identify giant cell arteritis patients with recent optic nerve 
ischemia [240]. 
7.1.2. AMI, cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation, heart failure 
In patients with AMI with ST-elevation, PTX3 could predict 3-month 
mortality after adjustment for significant risk factors and other acute- 
phase prognostic markers [241]. Besides, in the murine AMI model, 
PTX3 is proved with a cardioprotective effect [242]. Early detection of 
PTX3 level but not hsCRP is an independent marker predicting multiple 
organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS) and premature death in cardiac 
arrest patients [38,243]. The local production of PTX3 in the left atrium 
may reflect the local inflammation of atrial fibrillation [244]. Further­
more, PTX3 may be a novel inflammatory marker indicating the left 
ventricular diastolic dysfunction and heart failure with normal ejection 
fraction [245]. 
7.1.3. Hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, aortic aneurysm, aortic 
dissection 
The rs3816527 AA genotype of PTX3 could be an independent pre­
dictor and risk factor of hypertension in CKD patients [246]. Compared 
to individuals with the PTX3 rs2614 locus C allele, carriers with the 
PTX3 rs2614 locus T allele were more likely to have essential hyper­
tension (EHT) [247]. PTX3 is increased in neonates with pulmonary 
hypertension and could be used as a diagnostic marker of neonatal 
pulmonary hypertension [248,249]. A multiparameter model including 
galectin-3, PTX3, IL-6, and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen

(ICTP) may be helpful in the diagnosis and risk prediction of abdominal 
aortic aneurysm (AAA) [250]. PTX3 level on admission may be an in­
dependent predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients with type A 
aortic dissection (TAAD) [251]. 
7.2. Respiratory diseases 
7.2.1. Pneumonia, pleural effusion, aspergillosis 
Plasma PTX3 level was independently associated with microbial cell- 
free DNA (mcfDNA) levels in patients with pneumonia [252]. The 
admission level of PTX3 could be used to predict the severity of 
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (NCT03093220) [253]. PTX3 
could also be useful in the diagnosis and clinical assessment of the 
seriousness of CAP [254]. The serum PTX3 level, particularly the dy­
namic monitoring results, could be used as a biomarker to monitor CAP 
[255]. PTX3 has moderate accuracy in diagnosing respiratory tract in­
fections and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) [256]. The pleural 
fluid PTX3 may be a biomarker for differentiating parapneumonic 
effusion (PPE) from other types of pleural effusion [257–259]. PTX3 was 
reported to exert a protective effect against Aspergillus and has a po­
tential for diagnosis and therapy of aspergillosis (e.g., IPA) [260–262]. 
Compared to COPD patients without IPA, COPD patients with IPA had 
higher bronchoalveolar lavage fluid(BALF) and plasma PTX3 levels 
[263]. 
7.2.2. Asthma, COPD, emphysema 
PTX3 expression was increased in bronchial biopsies of allergic 
asthmatics compared to healthy individuals [88]. In addition, the blood 
concentration of PTX3 may help characterize the phenotype of severe 
asthma in children [264]. Serum level and gene expression of PTX3 were 
significantly higher in COPD patients than in healthy controls [265]. It is 
also reported that plasma PTX3 level was elevated in COPD patients and 
positively associated with dyspnea (MMRC scores) but had no associa­
tion with the severity of COPD [266]. Elevated PXT3 level is related to 
emphysema severity and mortality in smokers [267]. 
7.2.3. Lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism (PE) 
In a murine LPS-induced lung injury model, PTX3 could reflect the 
severity of lung injury [268]. Besides, PTX3 could alleviate hard 
metal-induced ALI through potentiating efferocytosis [269]. In a 
neonatal rat model, soluble PTX3 from human UCB-MSCs attenuated 
hyperoxic lung injury via activating macrophage polarization [137]. 
PTX3 may also be protective in coronaviral infection-induced ALI [151]. 
In multiple sensitive lung injury models in rats, high-volume ventilation 
enhanced PTX3 expression, and increased PTX3 expression was highly 
associated with the severity of lung injury [270]. Doni et al. proposed 
that PTX3 had a physiological and protective role during idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis [271]. In acute PE patients, plasma PTX3 level is 
correlated with PE risk stratification, PE-related cardiac deaths, and the 
prognosis of recurring PE [272]. 
7.2.4. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
In patients with COVID-19, circulating and lung myelomonocytic 
cells and endothelial cells could express high levels of PTX3 and be 
regarded as a major source of PTX3 [273]. PTX3 could interact with the 
nucleocapsid protein (NP) of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coro­
navirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) mainly through its N-terminal domain, and it 
had no anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity [274]. However, It remains to be 
investigated whether PTX3 involves in nucleocapsid-mediated comple­
ment activation and cytokine production [274]. 
Plasma PTX3 concentration could serve as an independent, strong 
prognostic indicator of 28-day mortality in COVID-19 [273]. A machine 
learning model identified binary combinations of “Age, SARS-CoV-2 
RNAemia (serum or plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA)” and “Age, PTX3” as 
the best predictors of 28-day ICU mortality [275]. Plasma PTX3 levels 
were useful in predicting 30-day respiratory failure and mortality risk in 
COVID-19 patients treated with and without remdesivir and dexa­
methasone [276]. In a retrospective study of 39 COVID-19 patients from 
Hunan, China, serum PTX3 level was positively associated with disease 
severity and coagulopathy [277]. Combinations of the serum inflam­
matory mediators IFN-β, PTX3, IFN-γ, IFN-λ2/3, and IL-6 were associ­
ated with long COVID with 78.5–81.6% accuracy [278]. A preliminary 
study suggested that reduced plasma IL-8 and PTX3 levels on day four 
following siltuximab treatment correlated with improved survival and 
ventilatory outcomes in COVID-19 patients in hospital [279]. Therefore, 
circulating PTX3 level may be a potential biomarker indicating the 
prognosis or disease severity of COVID-19. Besides, in COVID-19 pa­
tients, individuals with PTX3 rs1840680 (1449A/G) AG genotype were 
more protected from macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) compared 
to individuals with AA genotype [280]. 
7.3. Digestive diseases 
7.3.1. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), liver injury, liver fibrosis, 
liver cirrhosis 
In patients with NAFLD, increased plasma PTX3 level was strongly 
associated with endothelial dysfunction [281]. Moreover, PTX3 is a 
predictor of fibrosis and arterial stiffness in patients with NAFLD [282]. 
Elevated liver PTX3 level in the acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatic 
necrosis could be a marker of acute histological liver injury [283]. 
Serum PTX3 could be used as a novel marker for the early detection of 
fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B [284]. In patients with 
chronic hepatitis C, PTX3 could be used as a single diagnostic marker of 
significant fibrosis [285]. Plasma PTX3 level could differentiate nonal­
coholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from non-NASH and may indicate the 
severity of hepatic fibrosis in NASH patients [286]. Besides, PTX3 has 
the potential to predict the prognosis of patients with hepatic cirrhosis 
[40]. High serum PTX3/soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer 
of apoptosis (sTWEAK) levels during hospital admission could predict 
disease severity and case fatality in cirrhotic patients with acute 
decompensation [287]. It has also been reported that elevated PTX3 and 
NO levels correlated with the severity of alcoholic cirrhosis [288]. 
7.3.2. Bowel diseases 
In the mice model, the PTX3 level was significantly higher in the 
acetic acid-induced colitis group, indicating severer inflammation 
[289]. PTX3 may contribute to cell-mediated immune defense in 
inflamed colon tissue, particularly in crypt abscess lesions, of ulcerative 
colitis patients [290]. Serum PTX3 is superior to CRP in predicting the 
disease activity of Crohn’s disease [291]. Plasma PTX3 level was

dramatically higher in patients with active inflammatory bowel diseases 
(IBD) than in normal individuals and patients with inactive IBD, in 
which plasma PTX3 concentration positively correlated with clinical 
disease activity of IBD [292]. Besides, PTX3 may facilitate the diagnosis 
of acute appendicitis both in children [293–295] and in adults [296]. 
7.3.3. Pancreatic diseases 
PTX3 could be used for early severity assessment and prediction of 
acute pancreatitis (AP) [297]. Moreover, growth differentiation 
factor-15 (GDF-15) and PTX3 could help identify the development of 
severe AP on admission [298]. However, PTX3 was inferior to CRP and 
APACHE II scores in predicting the SIRS and death of AP. The combi­
nation of PTX3 with CRP couldn’t improve the predictive value of CRP 
[299]. 
7.4. Endocrine diseases 
7.4.1. Obesity 
Obesity is a state of chronic, low-grade proinflammation [300–302]. 
Based on existing research, Slusher et al. summarized that PTX3 could 
promote anti-inflammatory responses by down-regulating pro-in­
flammatory proteins from neutrophils and macrophages and 
up-regulating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines [303]. 
They also proposed reasonable speculation that therapies increasing the 
circulating PTX3 level in obese people could assist in restoring 
obesity-associated inflammatory imbalances and transforming the sys­
temic 
and 
local 
inflammatory 
microenvironments 
into 
anti-inflammatory microenvironments [303]. However, PTX3 may also 
participate in the onset of obesity via facilitating inflammation and 
restricting adipose tissue vascularization [304]. Thus, PTX3 may 
potentially exert a dual regulatory role in obesity, with more evidence 
needed to prove the hypothesis further. 
7.4.2. Metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, diabetes, diabetic 
retinopathy (DR), diabetic ketoacidosis complicated by pancreatitis 
PTX3 is associated with the severity of metabolic syndrome [305, 
306]. Additionally, PTX3 is higher in metabolic syndrome patients with 
subclinical atherosclerosis [307]. PTX3 level is negatively correlated 
with insulin resistance and changes in insulin resistance induced by 
physical activity in overweight and obese children [308]. In obese pa­
tients with NAFLD, compared with individuals with normal blood 
glucose levels, patients with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) had higher serum PTX3 level [309]. Compared with hsCRP, 
PTX3 may be a more accurate marker to predict the development of DR 
in Korean patients with T2DM [310]. Blood PTX3 level may help eval­
uate the severity of diabetic ketoacidosis complicated by pancreatitis 
[311]. 
7.5. Autoimmune diseases 
7.5.1. RA, SLE 
PTX3 was reported to mediate complement-regulated mechanisms, 
leading to inflammation and tissue injury in RA [312–314]. Besides, 
PTX3 may be a novel non-invasive marker indicating clinical arthritic 
activity in patients with RA [315]. However, many studies also revealed 
that PTX3 had no association with RA activity assessed by neu­
trophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) or disease activity score 28 (DAS28) 
[316–319], which is paradoxical to the outcome above. The synergetic 
increase 
of 
sucrose 
non-fermenting 
AMPK-related 
kinase 
(SNARK)/PTX3 via TNF-a/NF-kB signaling and DNA damage response 
may mediate SLE pathogenesis, atherogenesis, and development of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) [320]. Furthermore, PTX3 significantly 
correlated with SLE activity [321,322]. However, Skare el at. proposed 
that PTX3 was associated with cumulative lupus damage of SLE but not 
with disease activity [323]. 
7.5.2. Ankylosing spondylitis, systemic sclerosis, multiple sclerosis and 
neuromyelitis optica, psoriasis, rheumatic fever, gout 
Elevated PTX3 levels correlated with inflammation but not disease 
activity in ankylosing spondylitis patients [324]. High PTX3 levels in 
patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) may inhibit endothelial progenitor 
cell (EPC)-mediated vasculogenesis and facilitate vascular manifesta­
tions (digital ulcers and pulmonary arterial hypertension) [116]. 
Moreover, elevated serum PTX3 levels correlated with the disease 
severity of SSc [325]. Increased plasma PTX3 concentration is associated 
with inflammatory responses in patients with multiple sclerosis and 
neuromyelitis optica [326]. PTX3 may participate in the pathogenesis of 
psoriasis and could indicate disease activity of psoriasis [327,328]. 
Elevated PTX3 level during an acute episode of acute rheumatic fever 
may help predict the clinical course and the severity of accompanying 
carditis [329]. Besides, PTX3 contributes to the pathogenesis of gouty 
arthritis by promoting the phagocytosis of monosodium urate crystals 
[330]. 
7.6. Nervous diseases 
7.6.1. Stroke, vasospasm, brain injury 
Several studies support that PTX3 could be a prognostic marker of 
stroke [44,331,332], with the opposite view proposed by Ceylan el at 
[333]. Moreover, PTX3 may help assess the severity of ischemic stroke 
[334]. Acute elevated PTX3 level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) but not in 
plasma correlated with subarachnoid hemorrhage-associated vaso­
spasm, indicating the early diagnostic value of CSF PTX3 in vasospasm 
[335]. Serum PTX3 levels higher than 10 μg/ml were independently 
associated with the hospital mortality of patients with severe traumatic 
brain injury [336]. 
7.6.2. Prion disease, seizure, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease 
The mRNA level of PTX3 was elevated in the brain of the ME7 model 
of murine prion disease [337]. PTX3 could be synthesized in the brain 
after kainate-induced experimental seizure in mice and may play a 
protective role in seizure-induced neurodegeneration [338]. However, 
plasma PTX3 level was not increased in children with epilepsy [339]. 
Plasma PTX3 correlated with the severity of motor dysfunction and 
other clinical symptoms in Parkinson’s disease patients [340]. 
CEBPD-activated PTX3 could inhibit the phagocytosis of dying neuron 
cells by macrophages, which may be a mechanism of Alzheimer’s dis­
ease development [341]. 
7.6.3. Psychiatric disorders 
Some studies revealed that basal serum PTX3 level was decreased in 
specific psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression [342], bipolar disorders 
[342,343], and schizophrenia [344]), suggesting that patients with 
psychiatric disorders may have impaired immunity [345]. 
7.7. Urinary diseases 
7.7.1. Urinary tract infection (UTI), lupus nephritis, diabetic nephropathy 
(DN), renal injury 
Jaillon el at. concluded that PTX3 is a pivotal innate immune 
component against UTI [346]. PTX3 level was significantly elevated in 
patients with active lupus nephritis and may be a potential biomarker 
for disease progression, particularly tubulointerstitial injury [347]. 
PTX3 that increases as DN progresses may be a better inflammatory 
marker than hsCRP [348]. Furthermore, in a rat model, PTX3 level in 
renal tissue was closely associated with renal damage in DN. It may help 
quantify the extent of renal damage in DN, early evaluate renal tubular 
injury in early DN patients, and assess the clinical progression of DN 
[349]. 
7.7.2. CKD, dialysis 
Plasma PTX3 level increases as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
H. Zhang et al.

declines and is associated with the presence of protein-energy wasting 
and cardiovascular disease [350]. Moreover, a high PTX3 level was 
accompanied by higher all-cause mortality in patients with CKD [350]. 
PTX3 may be a new biomarker of peritoneal inflammation and pro­
gressive fibrosis in end-stage kidney disease patients treated with peri­
toneal 
dialysis 
[351]. 
Besides, 
PTX3 
could 
indicate 
hemodialysis-induced inflammation and blood-membrane biocompati­
bility in hemodialysis patients [352]. 
7.8. Hematogenous diseases 
7.8.1. Sickle cell disease, thalassemia, Henoch-Sch¨onlein purpura, graft- 
versus-host disease (GVHD) 
PTX3 could be considered a subjective predictor for the occurrence 
and severity of sickle cell disease acute complications [353]. Serum 
PTX3 levels could help evaluate the vascular endothelial damage in 
thalassemia patients [354]. High serum PTX3 levels and IgM staining in 
skin biopsies could predict subsequent renal involvement in child pa­
tients with Henoch-Sch¨onlein purpura [355]. Plasma PTX3 levels at 
GVHD onset also predict disease severity and therapeutic responses in 
children treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [356]. 
7.9. Diseases of the female reproductive system 
7.9.1. Pelvic inflammatory disease, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), 
intra-amniotic inflammation, preeclampsia 
Plasma PTX3 level has an advantage over CRP in predicting pelvic 
inflammatory disease and is associated with tube-ovarian abscess (TOA) 
and length of hospital stay [357]. Plasma PTX3 was decreased in women 
with PCOS and independently correlated with hyperandrogenism and 
other endocrine and ovarian features of PCOS [358]. Moreover, PTX3 in 
amniotic fluid may indicate intra-amniotic inflammation in women with 
preterm premature rupture of membranes [359]. Compared to women 
with normal pregnancy, women with preeclampsia have higher circu­
lating PTX3 level [360]. Moreover, raised PTX3 level could be observed 
before the clinical onset of preeclampsia [360]. 
8. Targeted therapy of PTX3 
8.1. Tumor 
The scaling down of PTX3 to PTX3-derived small molecules may be a 
meaningful attempt to use the anti-tumor properties of PTX3 [14]. A 
PTX3-derived acetylated pentapeptide Ac-ARPCA-NH2 (ARPCA), cor­
responding to the amino acid sequence 100–104 in the N-terminal 
domain of PTX3, was considered the minimal FGF-2-binding peptide 
which could antagonize the biological activity of FGF-2 [361]. ARPCA 
could inhibit the FGF-dependent angiogenic and tumorigenic potential 
of Shionogi 115 mammary carcinoma cells and TRAMP-C2 prostate 
cancer cells [362]. Besides, ARPCA could suppress downstream FGFR 
signaling and FGF-2-stimulated proliferation in murine B16-F10 mela­
noma cells [224]. Additionally, a pharmacophore model of 
ARPCA/FGF-2 interaction was used for in silico screening of the 
NCI2003 small-molecule database, which identified NSC12 as an ARPCA 
mimic [363]. NSC12 suppresses FGFR activation and FGF-dependent 
tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in a host of tumor models, 
showing its therapeutic value for tumor [363,364]. 
Besides, due to the tumor-promoting properties of PTX3, PTX3 could 
be a potential therapeutic target for certain types of tumors. Buthus 
martensii Karsch antitumor-analgesic peptide (BmK AGAP), a typical 
long-chain scorpion toxin, could inhibit breast cancer cell stemness, 
EMT, invasion, and migration via down-regulating PTX3 through NF-κB 
and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in vivo and vitro [365]. Rg3, one 
of the ginsenosides derived from heat-processed ginseng, could inhibit 
gemcitabine-induced lung cancer cell invasiveness via ROS-dependent, 
NF-κB- mediated, and HIF-1ɑ-mediated downregulation of PTX3 [96]. 
The shortened PTX3 peptide PEGylated retro-inverso peptides AD9 
(P2rdAD9) and the PTX3 antibody Ab-10 could interfere with the 
PTX3/CD44 interaction and suppress the growth and metastasis of TNBC 
[223]. RI37, a PTX3 peptide inhibitor, was reported to decrease 
CEBPD/PTX3 axis-induced cancer malignancies and suppress the 
metastasis and invasion of drug-resistant cancers in vivo [70]. The 
deglycosylation of PTX3 (dePTX3) by tunicamycin (TM) significantly 
enhances the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to cisplatin (Cis) and in­
hibits the growth and metastasis of lung cancer cell [366]. Moreover, 
dePTX3 by TM in lung cancer cells treated with Cis suppresses the 
activation of the AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway, facilitating the 
apoptosis of lung cancer cells [366]. Therefore, dePTX3 in chemo­
therapy has the potential to be a sound therapeutic strategy against lung 
cancer [366]. 
8.2. Non-cancerous diseases 
PTX3 may also be a therapeutic target for many non-cancerous dis­
eases. PTX3 could potentially treat chronic lung infection caused by 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa by inhibiting lung colonization, reducing pro- 
inflammatory cytokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL2, and IL-1b), and sup­
pressing leukocyte recruitment in the airways [367]. In a murine model 
of traumatic brain injury, exogenously administrated recombinant PTX3 
could activate A2 astrocytes, thus improving the recovery of neural 
function via increasing neuronal survival and enhancing neurogenesis 
[194]. In lupus-prone New Zealand Black/White (NZB/W) F1 mice, 
immunization with hrPTX3 could prevent murine lupus nephritis pro­
gression from the preclinical stage to the clinical stage, inciting 
anti-PTX3 antibodies and preventing PTX3 deposition in kidneys [368]. 
Besides, anti-PTX3 antibodies could delay lupus-like nephritis and pro­
long the survival of NZB/NZW F1 mice [369]. In an atherosclerotic cell 
model, Honokiol, an active component isolated from the Chinese me­
dicinal herb Magnolia Officinalis, could repair endothelial dysfunction 
by inhibiting the over-expression of PTX3 via suppressing IκB phos­
phorylation and reducing the expression of NF-κB p50 and p65 subunits 
in the IKK/IκB/NF-κB pathway [98]. Calcium dobesilate (CaD) may 
suppress PTX3 expression by altering the IKK/IκB/NF-κB pathway, thus 
ameliorating high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction in HUVECs, 
which indicates that CaD has therapeutic potential for diabetic ne­
phropathy [370]. MiR-29b over-expression could dampen the vascular 
inflammatory response by inhibiting the expression of PTX3 and 
dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), which could be applied to treat 
radiotherapy-induced vascular disease in the future [371]. 
9. Conclusion and perspective 
Since the discovery of PTX3 30 years ago, numerous studies have 
contributed to comprehensively defining its physiological and patho­
logical features, aiming to promote the clinical management of patients 
based on the known knowledge of PTX3. So far, the clinical applications 
of PTX3 have mainly been restricted to its diagnostic and prognostic 
value. The targeted therapy based on PTX3 is limited and has not 
revolutionized the treatment modality. Notably, there are still several 
puzzles remaining to be solved. 
First, the structures and functional domains of PTX3 must be fully 
identified. PTX3 is a 381-amino acid-long glycoprotein that consists of a 
C-terminal domain and an N-terminal domain, which also contains 
various binding sites of ligands (e.g.FH, P-selectin, FGF-2, inter-ɑ- 
trypsin inhibitor). The structural characteristics of PTX3 are closely 
responsible for its regulatory roles in innate immunity, inflammation, 
angiogenesis, ECM stability, and tissue remodeling. The FGF-2-binding 
peptides are already proven with anti-angiogenic and anti-tumorigenic 
potential. Therefore, identifying all structures and functional domains 
in the PTX3 molecule could help design and produce the corresponding 
chemicals and antibodies for precision-targeted therapy. 
Second, the unknown receptors and ligands of PTX3 are yet to be 
H. Zhang et al.

explored. Currently, some receptors/ligands (e.g., C1q, P-selectin, his­
tone, TSG-6, fibrin, FGF-2, CD44, CD32, etc.) have been confirmed to 
interact with PTX3. As PTX3 is a secretory protein, many membrane 
proteins, such as CD47, were proposed as potential receptors. Besides, 
the interaction of PTX3 with other NETs components and their potential 
synergic antibacterial roles are needed for further investigation. 
Third, the specific roles of PTX3 on microenvironment cells, such as 
macrophages, neutrophils, fibroblasts, and DCs, remain to be further 
investigated. For example, how PTX3 influences the polarization of 
macrophages are needed for further elucidated. 
Forth, the complex roles of PTX3 in cancer development should be 
entirely determined as PTX3 exerts both anti-tumor and pro-tumor ef­
fects. Notably, researches involving the interaction of PTX3 with 
membrane receptors on tumor cells and relevant downstream signaling 
pathways are limited and needed for further investigation. 
Fifth, selective drugs targeting PTX3 are limited, and more potential 
drugs targeting PTX3 are needed, such as the drug for deglycosylation of 
PTX3.
