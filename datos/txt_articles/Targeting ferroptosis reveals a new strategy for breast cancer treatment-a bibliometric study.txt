Abstract
Background  Studies exploring the role of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of breast cancer have proliferated over the past 
decade, especially in 2023, with a staggering 217 publications in related studies. However, there are still significant gaps 
in comprehensive scientometric analysis and mapping of scientific studies, especially in terms of temporal and study 
area tracking, principal investigators, and the emergence of new hotspots.
Objective  This study aims to summarize the role of ferroptosis in the development of breast cancer and the latest research 
results on the ferroptosis-targeted treatment of breast cancer and to use bibliometric methods to draw a visual map to 
explore future research trends.
Methods  On May 11, 2024, this study updated the research progress related to ferroptosis and breast cancer over the 
past 11 years by retrieving data from January 1, 2014, to May 1, 2024, from the Web of Science database. In this research, 
many scientific analysis software including VOSviewer, chorddiag R Language Pack, Scimago Graphica, Citespace 6.3.R1, 
Cluster Profiler, enrichplot, ggplot2 R Language Pack, Cytoscape, and STRING online platform are used to make in-depth 
scientific analysis and visualization of the measurement results.
Results  Statistical analysis of these data showed that China accounted for 74.43% of the total publications, highlighting 
China’s dominant role in research on the relationship between ferroptosis and breast cancer. Several research institu-
tions, including Sun Yat-sen University, Zhejiang University, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University, have achieved impressive 
results. Efferth, Thomas is the most prominent author in this field and has the highest number of publications in the 
subfield of oncology. This study clearly shows that ferroptosis plays a crucial role in the development of triple-negative 
breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, glioma, leukemia, mitochondrial disease, lymphoma, bladder tumors, lung 
adenocarcinoma, and esophageal tumors.
Conclusion  This study provides a comprehensive bibliometric evaluation that deepens our understanding of the role of 
ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and the current status of targeting ferroptosis for treating breast cancer. 
Thus, it helps researchers in related fields explore new research directions by comprehensively extracting important 
information and research hotspots.

Globally, breast cancer has developed into the most common tumor in women [1], which is characterized by high mor-
bidity and mortality [2], which has a significant impact on women’s health worldwide [3]. The mortality rates of breast 
and cervical cancer among women in transition countries are reported to be significantly higher than those in countries 
in transition (15.0 vs. 12.8 cases per 100,000 and 12.4 vs. 5.2 cases per 100,000, respectively) [4]. Based on immunohis-
tochemical staining results, breast cancers are classified into four types: LuminalA, LuminalB, HER2-positive, and triple-
negative breast cancers (also known as basal cell-like). Different subtypes correspond to different treatment options. 
Luminal A type includes estrogen receptor (ER) positive, progesterone receptor (PR) positive, and human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative tumors. This type of breast cancer can benefit from hormone therapy and 
chemotherapy. Luminal B type consists of two main categories: ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors with low expression 
of PR or high expression of Ki67, and ER-positive, HER2-positive tumors with any expression of PR and Ki67. This type 
of breast cancer can benefit from chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and HER2-targeted therapy.HER2-positive includes 
tumors that are ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2-positive. This type of breast cancer can benefit from chemotherapy 
and HER2-targeted therapy. Triple-negative breast cancer includes ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2-negative tumors. 
This type of breast cancer can benefit from chemotherapy. Despite the availability of surgical resection, radiotherapy, 
hormonal therapy, and targeted therapy, the treatment of breast cancer is not as effective as it should be [5], especially 
for triple-negative breast cancer, which lacks effective endocrine therapy and anti-HER2-targeted therapy, resulting in a 
high rate of recurrence and a poor prognosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore new options for more refined 
therapeutic management. Due to the heterogeneity of breast cancer, the current treatment and prognosis research for 
breast cancer is multi-directional. Some studies start from the perspective of cellular energy metabolism, exploring the 
impact of mitochondrial dysfunction on breast cancer and the development of mitochondrial inhibitors [6]. Some stud-
ies start from cellular glutamine metabolism, linking it with T cell-related genes to construct a prognostic staging index 
for breast cancer patients to provide more accurate treatment [7]. Others start by regulating cellular circadian rhythms, 
studying how circadian rhythm disorders affect breast cancer progression by changing the tumor microenvironment 
and immune response [8].
The concept of ferroptosis was first proposed by Dixon et al. [9] and has since become a hot research topic in many fields, 
especially in oncology. Ferroptosis is a highly iron-dependent cell death. Unlike necrosis, apoptosis, and cellular autophagy, 
ferroptosis is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal intracellular lipid peroxides [10]. Although the regulatory 
mechanisms of ferroptosis have not been fully elucidated, its role in a variety of human diseases has been established, such 
as neurodegenerative diseases [11, 12], ischemia–reperfusion injury [13], and various cancers, including breast cancer [14–23]. 
Inhibiting or activating intracellular ferroptosis may bring unexpected therapeutic effects to various diseases. Studies have 
shown that inducing ferroptosis in breast cancer cells can effectively inhibit tumor growth, offering hope for the develop-
ment of novel anti-breast cancer drugs [24]. Another study found that the loss of ADAR1 induced iron death in breast cancer 
cells by regulating the miR-335-5p/Sp1/GPX4 pathway [25]. Other studies have shown that PDK4 deficiency stimulates 
autophagy-dependent iron death in breast cancer by activating the ASK1/JNK signaling pathway [26]. Recent studies have 
found that Several natural or synthetic chemical drugs have shown significant anticancer effects by modulating ferroptosis 
in breast cancer cells [27–33]. From this perspective, targeting ferroptosis may be a new prospect for anticancer therapy.
Although many articles on “ferroptosis and breast cancer” have been published, including many classic reviews, due to 
the influence of the author’s ideas, their reviews only show the research progress in a specific direction, which is not com-
prehensive enough. Bibliometric analysis is an objective analysis method based on big data, which can comprehensively 
present the research status of the entire field [34]. Visualizing the results of bibliometric analysis through software such as 
VOSviewer and CiteSpace can present them more intuitively [35]. In addition, through retrieval, no bibliometric articles on 
“ferroptosis and breast cancer” have been found, so it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive scientific quantitative analysis 
and detailed summary of this field, focusing on research trends, significant institutions and researchers, hot word frequen-
cies, associated genes, etc. Therefore, this study aims to help researchers understand this field’s historical development and 
research hotspots and provide detailed and comprehensive resource references for senior experts and new researchers to 
improve research efficiency.

1  Materials and methods
1.1  Data sources
WOS Database: By the search formula TS = (“Breast Neoplasm” or “Breast Tumor” or “Breast Cancer” or “Mammary Can-
cer” or “Cancer of Breast” or “Human Mammary Carcinoma” or “Human Mammary Neoplasm” or “Breast Carcinoma”) 
and TS = (“Iron-induced cell death” OR ferroptosis) The Web of Science Core Collection database was retrieved from 
2014-01-01 to 2024-05-01. The inclusion criteria were 528 papers and 133 reviews related to the search, excluding 
letters, newsletters, book reviews, etc., and 661 articles related to the topic. The data visually analyzes countries, 
institutions, authors, journals, fields, co-citations, keywords, genes, and diseases.
citexs big data analytics platform: Genetic and disease data are derived from the citexs platform for disease 
visualization and analysis. (https://​www.​citexs.​com).
Retrieval Flowchart (Fig. 1).
1.2  Research methods
We plotted country/region/collaboration chordal maps and co-occurrence analysis maps using VOS viewer 1.6.18 
(Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, The Netherlands) and the chorddiag R language 
package. VOS viewer 1.6.18 (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, The Netherlands) and 
Scimago Graphica 1.0.35 (https://​www.​graph​ica.​app/, USA) analyze co-occurrence by co-occurrence for country/
region, institution, author, journal publication, field, gene, and disease. In the graph drawn by this software, the orb 
and text labels represent a node, and the size of the orb represents the size of the node; different colors represent 
different clusters; the connecting lines between nodes represent co-occurrence relationships; and the thickness of 
the connecting line segments represents the magnitude of co-occurrence intensity. Citespace 6.3.R1 (ChaomeiChen, 
China) software was used to visualize and analyze the institutions, literature co-citations, and keywords and to draw 
relevant visualization maps. The TOP10 citation emergence intensity of institutions and keywords are respectively 
made into emergence graphs; the TOP20 literature citation emergence intensity is made into emergence graphs. 
In the literature co-citation clustering analysis graph, the parameters of CiteSpace are set as follows: time slice 
(2016–2024), year per slice (1), and selection criteria (k = 3); in the hot word frequency clustering analysis graph, the 
parameters of CiteSpace are set as follows: time slice (2016–2024), year per slice (1), and selection criteria (k = 26). 
In the hotspot word frequency clustering timeline analysis plot, the parameters of CiteSpace were set as follows: 
time slice (2016–2024), year per slice (1), and selection criteria (k = 26). Different orbs represent different co-cited 
references, and the size of the orbs is proportional to the number of citations of the publication. The connecting 
lines between orbs indicate co-citation relationships. The size and color of the superimposed chronology in each orb 
indicate the number of cited literature and the corresponding period. The extracted genes were visualized for GO and 
KEGG enrichment analyses using Clusterprofiler, enrichplot, and ggplot2R language packages. Extracted proteins 
were analyzed and visualized by constructing PPI networks using STRING (http://​string-​db.​org) online platform 
Cytoscape 3.8.2 (Cytoscape Consortium, USA).

2.1  Analysis of annual trends in the issuance of communications
From 2014-01-01 to 2024-05-01, the number of articles on “ferroptosis and breast cancer” was 661 (Fig. 2). No articles 
were published in 2014 and 2015, so the subsequent analysis started in 2016. The average annual number of articles was 
calculated to be 73.4. From 2016 to 2024, the annual number of articles showed a continuous upward trend. The highest 
growth rate was 250% in 2017, with similar growth rates of 100% in 2020 and 2021. The annual number of publications 
showed a continuous upward trend, with the highest growth rate of 250% in 2017 and the same growth rate of 100% 
in 2020 and 2021. A power function y = 1.5274 × 2.7134 (R2 = 0.9896, x represents the first year, and y is the cumulative 
number of articles) was created for the trend in a cumulative number of articles with a good fit. This indicates that the

research interest in ‘ferroptosis and Breast Cancer’ is increasing yearly, and this power function can effectively character-
ize its increasing trend.
VOS viewer software was used to visualize and analyze the publication regions, and 661 articles on “ferroptosis and 
breast cancer” were published in 48 countries. By setting the minimum number of articles in a country to 2, we obtained 
the country/region co-occurrence analysis and the country/region relationship chord diagram (authors who meet the 
above conditions were put into the diagram) for “ferroptosis and breast cancer.” In Fig. 3A, each ball represents a country,

and the size of the ball is proportional to the number of articles published by the country; the thickness of the lines 
between the balls represents the strength of cooperation between different countries. In Fig. 3B, we visualized the region 
of articles published in the study “ferroptosis and breast cancer” using the chorddiag R language package. Each outer 
curve segment represents a country/region, and the thickness of the connecting line is proportional to the strength of 
cooperation between countries/regions.
Figure 3 shows that China has the most robust willingness to cooperate with other countries/regions, and its 
cooperation with the USA is the strongest. Moreover, Cameroon and Germany are ranked second in the value of the 
intensity of cooperation; China is the country with the most number of publications, 492, which is nearly six times as 
many as USA, the country that is ranked second in the value of publications; Germany is ranked third in the number of 
publications, 23; Belgium’s Belgium has the highest number of citations for a single document, reaching 399.5, followed 
by Germany with 198.83, indicating that the research results of these countries receive a higher degree of citation, 
which shows that these articles have a high degree of academic recognition. Table 1 shows the top 10 countries/regions 
regarding the number of published papers.
Eight hundred thirty institutions published 661 “ferroptosis and breast cancer” articles using VOSviewer software. 
The minimum number of articles published by an organization was set at 3, and a clustering diagram was obtained for 
the cooperation of the research organizations in the study of “ferroptosis and breast cancer.” Fig. 4A illustrates different 
clusters using various colors. These clusters are based on the co-citation network between institutions. Institutions with 
a high degree of co-citation are grouped, forming a cluster hierarchy. This hierarchy visually represents the relationships 
between institutions. Of all the clustered institutions, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen has the highest number of citations 
to a single piece of literature at 1108.33, followed by the University of Pittsburgh, with both institutions categorized in 
the yellow cluster. Institution Sun Yat-sen University, with purple clustering, has the highest number of publications, 
with 33, followed by Zhejiang University, with green clustering, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University, with red clustering, 
with 32 and 26 publications, respectively. We have ranked the top 15 institutions in contribution based on the number 
of publications, as shown in Table 2.
Figure 4B shows the top 10 institutional citation bursts from 2016-01-01 to 2024-05-01 analyzed by CiteSpace for 
studies related to “ferroptosis and breast cancer,” which refers to the top 10 institutions with the most vigorous bursts of 
citations in a certain period, and the red area in the figure indicates the period of citation surge for each institution. The 
red area in the graph indicates the period in which each institution’s citation surge occurred. The graph shows that in 
this period, Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz had a surge in 2017–2020, with the highest burst strength of 3.11. 
Its burst time is the longest among the top ten, indicating that the research published by this institution has a more 
significant academic impact on the field of “ferroptosis and Breast Cancer” for a more extended period. The institutions

published by this institution has a more significant academic influence on the field of “ferroptosis and breast cancer” 
over a more extended period. Among the top ten institutions with the most substantial citation explosion, most of the 
institutions appeared around 2020, indicating that the research in the field of “ferroptosis and breast cancer” is more 
concentrated in this period, with a higher degree of enthusiasm.
VOSviewer software was used to visualize and analyze authors’ publications. Four thousand four hundred fifty-
one authors published 661 articles related to the study of “ferroptosis and breast cancer.” The minimum number of 
articles published by each author was set to 3, and a collaborative relationship graph of the articles published by 
authors of the study “ferroptosis and breast cancer” was obtained. As shown in Fig. 4C, circles and text labels form a 
node, and different colors represent different clusters. The thickness of the lines between the circles represents the 
intensity of collaboration between authors. The three authors Chen, Yongxia, Yang, Jingjing, and Zhou, Yulu tied for 
the first place in terms of cooperation intensity; Efferth, Thomas, Kuete, Victor and Mbaveng, ArmelleT. Established

burst intensity of 17.02. The period of the burst is 2018–2021, which indicates that this Article has a high impact on the 
field of “ferroptosis and breast cancer”; Jiang L (2015), Gao MH (2015), and Cao JY (2016) have the highest citation burst 
intensity of 17.02, and the period of the burst is 2018–2021, which indicates that this Article has a high impact on the 
field of “ferroptosis and breast cancer”; Jiang L (2015), Gao MH (2015) and Cao JY (2016) have the highest citation strength 
of 17.02. Jiang L (2015), Gao MH (2015), and Cao JY (2016) have the longest citation emergence time, which is 4 years, 
indicating that these papers have a more extended influence on the field of “ferroptosis and breast cancer.” In the Top 20 
cited literature, most of the literature has a citation surge in 2020–2021, indicating that the research field of “ferroptosis 
and breast cancer” has a high degree of enthusiasm during this period; the literature that has a citation surge in the 
past 2 years is Doll S (2017), which indicates that this Article has a strong influence on the field of “ferroptosis and breast 
cancer” in the past 2 years. “ferroptosis and breast cancer” research has been emphasized in the last 2 years.
Figure 6A shows the hotspot word frequency co-occurrence analysis graph, which analyzed the hotspot word fre-
quency clustering of “ferroptosis and breast cancer” from 2016-01-01 to 2024-05-01 by CiteSpace (the following descrip-
tions are limited to the inclusion of the data in the graph, and the parameters of CiteSpace were set as follows: time slice 
(2016–2024), year per slice (1), and selection criteria (k = 26). (2016–2024), year per slice (1), selection criteria (k = 26). 
The size of the superimposed circles, i.e., the size of the corresponding circles on the chronological line is summed up, is 
proportional to the number of co-citations, purple represents relatively early citations, yellow represents late citations, 
and the superimposed color represents that the hot word was cited in all the corresponding years. The line between 
the circles represents the co-citation situation of the hot words, and the nodes marked in red are the critical nodes with 
centrality greater than 0.1. Citespace provides modularity (Q) and mean silhouette (S) values to assess the clarity of net-
work structure and clustering. Generally, a Q value greater than 0.3 indicates a significant clustering structure, while an 
S value above 0.5 suggests reasonable clustering. Therefore, from the upper left area of the figure, it can be known that 
the clustering module value Q value = 0.8655 and the average silhouette value S value = 0.984, i.e., Q value of 0.8655 > 0.3 
and S value of 0.984 > 0.5, so it is concluded that the sample keywords clustering structure is significant and clustering 
is convincing. Figure 6A shows that these hot words are clustered into 11 classes: #0 breast cancer, #1 immune status, #2 
tumor microenvironment, #3 triple-negative breast cancer, #4 cell death, #5 photothermal therapy, #6 lipid peroxidation, 
#7 hydrogen sulfide, #8 reactive oxygen species, #9 combination therapy, and #10 oxidative stress.

a certain period, and the red area in the figure indicates the period of the citation spikes. The red area in the graph 
indicates the period of the citation surge. The graph shows the citation explosion of these keywords by year, strength, 
beginning, and end. The graph provides a quick understanding of the research trends and focuses on “ferroptosis and 
Breast Cancer” over the past few years. From the figure, the keyword with the most vigorous citation emergence intensity 
is nonapoptotic cell death, with an emergence intensity value of 1.8, and the emergence period is 2018–2019. Among 
the top 10 keywords, ‘iron metabolism’ shows an earlier citation surge. This indicates that it received high attention in 
the early stages of ‘ferroptosis and breast cancer’ research. In the Top 10 keywords, the citation surge of iron metabolism 
is earlier, indicating that this research hotspot receives greater attention in “ferroptosis and breast cancer” at the early 
stage. Keywords showing citation surges after 2022, such as ‘hepatocellular carcinoma’ and ‘prognostic model,’ highlight 
the key research directions in this field over the past 2 years. This indicates that these hot words have been the focus of 
the field of “ferroptosis and breast cancer” in the past 2 years.
Figure 6C shows the timeline analysis of clustering keywords associated with “ferroptosis and breast cancer.” The size 
of the superimposed orbs, i.e., the size of the corresponding orbs on the chronological line, is directly proportional to 
the frequency of the keywords; the connecting lines between the keywords represent the co-occurrences; the purple 
color represents that the keywords appeared relatively early, and the yellow color represents that the keywords appeared 
late. The superimposed colors represent that the keywords appear in the corresponding years; the rosy red nodes are 
the more central nodes (in the pivot position, playing a pivotal role); the keywords of the same clusters are placed on 
the same horizontal line. The time of the first appearance of the keyword is placed at the top of the view, and the further 
to the right, the more recent the time. Through this figure, the number of keywords in each cluster can be obtained; the 
more keywords, the more critical the domain of the cluster; the period of keywords in each cluster can also be obtained. 
As shown in the figure, the keywords are clustered into 11 clusters, which are #0 breast cancer, #1 immune status, #2 
tumor microenvironment, #3 triple-negative breast cancer, #4 cell death, #5 photothermal-therapy, #6 lipid peroxidation, 
#7 hydrogen sulfide, #8 reactive oxygen species, #9 combination therapy, #10 oxidative stress clustering in the area of 
“ferroptosis and Breast Cancer”. The specific data is shown in Table 5.
These themes or keywords represent current and recent years’ focus and hotspots within related research areas, 
perhaps because of their importance in scientific research advances, therapeutic potential, or clinical applications. The 
mapping shows which research themes are growing, which are centerpieces or pivots, and how different concepts are 
interconnected over time. This is a macroscopic display of knowledge and research activity in the field and is helpful for 
researchers in the field to understand overall research trends.

nodes of different colors form different clusters, and the different colors represent the clustering of genes in different 
domains, among which, the gene with the highest research heat is classified as a blue cluster, which mainly participates 
in weakening the toxicity of lipid peroxide and maintaining membrane This gene is mainly involved in weakening the 
toxicity of lipid peroxides and maintaining the homeostasis of the membrane bilayer, and there is also the gene SLC7A11 
in this cluster, which is involved in this physiological function; the most prevalent gene in the green cluster is NFE2L2, 
which is mainly involved in intracellular antioxidant function; in the red cluster, the most prevalent gene is AKT1, which 
is related to PI3K/AKT and the downstream apoptosis signaling pathway.
In the GO enrichment analysis histogram, each bar represents a GO Term, the size of the bar reflects the number of 
genes contained in this function, and the color indicates the enrichment degree of this function. The X-axis represents 
the Gene Ratio value, which refers to the ratio of the number of genes associated with the GO Term to the total number of 
genes in the background gene set (the whole genome of the human species to which the subject belongs to the study). 
The X-axis represents the Gene Ratio value, and the Gene Ratio is the proportion of the number of genes associated 
with a GO Term in the background gene set (the whole genome of the species to which the research subject belongs) 
to the total number of genes; the more significant the Gene Ratio value on the X-axis, the more genes are associated 
with the GO Term. If the Gene Ratio of a GO Term is significantly higher than the expected value, it may have an essential 
biological function in the experiment.
GO functional enrichment results are shown in Fig. 7B. This project involves biological process (BP), molecular function 
(MF), and cell composition (CC). In BP, The gene was significantly enriched in cellular response to chemical stress, intrinsic 
apoptotic signaling pathway, and regulation of apoptotic signaling Biological processes such as pathway. In CC, genes 
were significantly enriched in the mitochondrial and organelle outer membranes. Regarding MF, The genes were 
significantly enriched in Ubiquitin-like protein ligase binding, ubiquitin protein ligase binding, and RNA polymerase 
II-specific DNA-binding transcription factor binding and other molecular functions.
Figure 7C is a histogram of the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis selects the top 
10 signaling pathways and draws a histogram. The X-axis represents the genes significantly enriched in each pathway, 
and the Y-axis represents different signaling pathways. The longer the column, the more genes under the entry; red 
represents a significant pathway after enrichment; blue represents a low-significance pathway. The figure shows that the 
“ferroptosis and breast cancer” research field is significantly related to signaling pathways such as Ferroptosis, Kaposis 
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, and Lipid and atherosclerosis.

software, and the node degree value (degree) was calculated. Note: After importing the screened genes into the STRING 
database, the PPI network was obtained, as shown in Fig. 7D, which contained 100 nodes, 771 edges, and an average node 
degree value of 15.4. The node degree value (degree) was calculated using Cytoscape software. Then, the PPI network 
graph of core proteins was constructed according to the degree of value sorted from smallest to largest. See Fig. The 
top 10 proteins are TP53, AKT1, BCL2, EGFR, CASP3, STAT3, TNF, MYC, IL6, and CTNNB1, which may be the core proteins 
of “ferroptosis and breast cancer”.
The VOS viewer software was used to analyze the co-occurrence of diseases related to the study of “ferroptosis and 
breast cancer.” Citexs big data platform extracted a total of 687 diseases from 661 articles and set the minimum number 
of occurrences of each disease to 5 (put the diseases that meet the above conditions into the graph) to obtain a cluster 
diagram of diseases related to the study of “ferroptosis and breast cancer.” The clustering diagram of diseases related 
to the study of “ferroptosis and breast cancer” is shown in Fig. 7E. Circles and labels form a node, the size of the circle is 
positively correlated with the frequency of the disease, and the thickness of the line connecting the circle is positively 
correlated with the strength of the relationship between the diseases; nodes of different colors form different clusters, 
and the different colors represent the different clustering of the diseases, of which the blue clusters with the highest 
heat are the ones with the highest heat. The blue cluster is urinary bladder neoplasms; the red cluster is triple-negative 
breast neoplasms; the green cluster is leukemia.
3  Discussion
This study conducted a comprehensive search in the Web of Science database to identify research articles published in 
the last decade (2014–2024) on ferroptosis associated with breast cancer. According to the principles of scientometrics, 
the number of published articles reflects the research heat and development of the field. To ensure the reliability and 
accuracy of the results, screening criteria were developed, and articles that did not meet the criteria were removed. 
According to the screening results, 661 articles related to the topic were retrieved since 2014, including 528 papers 
and 133 reviews. The total citation frequency of these articles was 2498 from 100 institutions in 30 countries or regions. 
This demonstrates the global solid connection in breast cancer associated with ferroptosis. The first Article in this field 
was published in 2016, which revealed a novel mechanism that induces ferroptosis in breast cancer cells by altering 
intracellular iron levels, which provides new ideas for therapeutic strategies in breast cancer [17].
As can be seen from the results, there is a continuous rise in the number of research studies on breast cancer associated 
with ferroptosis. From 2 articles in 2016 to 217 articles in 2023, it shows an increasing trend year by year (average 
annual growth rate of 95.33%). This indicates that this research area is receiving increasing attention from the global 
scientific community. From 2016 to 2020, the total number of annual articles was small despite the high annual growth 
rate, indicating that the research on ferroptosis in breast cancer is still at an early stage. There is limited interest and 
focus on the study of the role of ferroptosis in breast cancer. However, from 2021 to 2023, there is a significant change 
in the number of publications in this field. Compared with previous years, the average annual number of publications 
has increased significantly from 19 to 154, indicating that the scientific community’s interest and focus on exploring 
ferroptosis as a target for breast cancer treatment is proliferating.
China and the United States lead the way in breast cancer research related to ferroptosis, with these two countries 
accounting for nearly three-quarters of the publications in this area. China, in particular, is dominant, with 63% of the 
world’s publications, and the top 10 research organizations are all from China, followed by the U.S. and Germany in third 
place. Interestingly, the most robust collaborations are between China and the United States, followed by Cameroon and 
Germany, suggesting a synergy of efforts between these countries to promote new strategies for targeting ferroptosis in 
breast cancer treatment. Although some collaboration exists between some countries, the strength of the collaboration 
is not as muscular as it could be. China has a very low intensity of collaboration with other countries except for a strong 
connection with the United States, which is also the case with the United States. In addition, there is no cooperation 
between Germany, which ranks third in the number of articles sent, and India, which ranks fourth. Such low-intensity 
collaborations can seriously hinder the development of the field. Therefore, extensive communication and cooperation 
between organizations in multiple related research fields in different countries is strongly recommended to promote 
the development of new strategies for treatments targeting ferroptosis. In addition to the close collaboration between 
countries, the partnership between investigators is equally essential.
Regarding the intensity of collaboration, three investigators, Chen, Yongxia, Yang, Jingjing, and Zhou, Yulu, tied first, 
while Efferth, Thomas, Kuete, Victor, and Mbaveng, ArmelleT. They established the closest collaborations, indicating that

these investigators are more active in promoting ferroptosis therapeutic strategies. I believe that by working together, we 
can accelerate the dynamic development of this field, improving the treatment options for breast cancer and bringing 
benefits to more patients.
For journals, impact factors [36] and journal citation reports [37] are essential indicators to prove their influence size. 
Among the top ten journals that published several articles in this field, the percentage of JCRQ1 is 92.6%, and only 
one journal is JCRQ2, which shows the high quality of research results in this field. Among these journals, FRONTIERS 
IN PHARMACOLOGY (Impact Factor = 4.4, JCRQ1) and FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY (Impact Factor = 3.5, JCRQ2) had the 
highest number of articles published, which indicates that the journals have attracted much attention in targeting new 
strategies for ferroptosis therapy. In addition, CELL (impact factor = 45.5, JCRQ1) had the highest impact factor among the 
many published journals, indicating the journal’s great importance in the related field. Core journals are burdened with 
publishing essential research results in the relevant field. Therefore, these journals can be recommended to researchers 
in the field to help them quickly learn about the most cutting-edge research results and optimize their research ideas in 
time. Hot word frequency citation emergence refers to the frequency of a keyword appearing in the citations in a certain 
period. This mainly demonstrates the research trends and hotspots of concern in the related fields in the past few years. 
The results show that nonapoptotic cell death is the keyword with the most vigorous citation emergence intensity in 
recent years, and the emergence period is 2018–2019. Ye et al. [38] summarized that it is possible to treat a variety of 
malignant tumors, including breast tumors, by inducing nonapoptotic cell death in cells. Woo et al. [39] experimentally 
demonstrated that Corosolic Acid could induce nonapoptotic cell death in breast cancer cells. All these studies provide 
a theoretical basis for targeting ferroptosis for the treatment of breast cancer.
From the results of the study, it can be seen that three authors, Efferth, Thomas, Zhang, Jing, and Liu, Yang, are the 
most active with seven publications, followed by Zhang, Jun, Li, Wentong, Kuete, Victor, and Mbaveng, ArmelleT. with 
six publications. This indicates that their contribution to the research area of targeting ferroptosis for breast cancer 
treatment is very significant. By analyzing the strength of collaboration among researchers, we were surprised to find 
three authors, Efferth, Thomas, Kuete, Victor, and Mbaveng, ArmelleT. They collaborated closely, but unfortunately, four 
authors, Zhang, Jing, Liu, Yang, Zhang, Jun, and Li, Wentong, did not collaborate. Regrettably, the four authors, Zhang, 
Jing, Liu, Yang, Zhang, Jun, and Li, Wentong, have no cooperation. With more publications, it is hoped that the researchers 
can strengthen their communication and cooperation with valuable results. In addition, when analyzing the citations, we 
found that the top ten authors, with more than 62, contributed significantly to the field of “ferroptosis and breast cancer.” 
The most frequently cited author was Stockwell BR (106 citations), followed by Wang WM (101 citations) and Hassannia B 
(88 citations), and Stockwell BR made significant achievements in the mechanism of ferroptosis, physiological function, 
role in tumor diseases, and ferroptosis as a target for the treatment of tumors [40, 41]. His articles summarize the most 
cutting-edge and multifaceted research results in this field, from basic theory to practical applications, and have made 
significant contributions to researchers. Wang WM from the University of Michigan School of Medicine, USA, whose 
research found that immunotherapy-activated CD8T cells enhance ferroptosis in tumor cells specific lipid peroxidation, 
and in turn, increased ferroptosis contributes to the antitumor efficacy of immunotherapy [42]. This study combines 
tumor immunotherapy with cellular ferroptosis to explore a novel antitumor mechanism, which provides a new direction 
for tumor treatment options. The Article by Hassannia B points out that ferroptosis is a promising therapeutic strategy, 
especially for the treatment of cancer cells that have become resistant to anticancer drugs, and that by identifying and 
exploiting the iron-dependence of cancer cells, as well as the mechanisms by which the induction of ferroptosis occurs, 
the research, new drug targets, and technologies can be developed to kill tumor cells while protecting healthy cells 
more effectively [43]. In today’s new era of precision therapy, their research provides new options for the treatment of 
breast cancer.
Currently, research on targeted ferroptosis therapy for breast cancer spans several disciplines. These include oncology, 
biochemistry, molecular biology, pharmacology, cell biology, nanoscience, and technology. Most studies are published 
in journals related to these fields. This indicates that breast cancer treatment is not only concerned by medicine alone 
but also by the joint participation of many disciplines. This forms a complete process of fundamental theoretical research 
(upstream)-drug and material design (midstream)-clinical application (downstream), which bridges the gap between 
basic research and clinical application and realizes the translation of research results to clinical application, which is 
an exciting trend. Regarding theoretical research, Feng Ye et al. conducted a comprehensive study on breast cancer 
cell proliferation. They used various methods, including CCK8 experiments, colony formation assays, and xenograft 
mouse models. Their research was conducted both in vitro and in vivo. The study concluded that METTL16, an essential 
methyltransferase, is crucial in breast cancer progression. Specifically, METTL16 epigenetically enhances GPX4 expression 
through m6A modification, inhibiting ferroptosis and promoting cancer growth [44]. Huang et al. found that FOXQ1 was

Research
overexpressed in breast cancer and was associated with poorer survival through CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, 
transwell, and ferroptosis-related experiments. In addition, inhibition of FOXQ1 suppressed breast cancer ferroptosis and 
progression, suggesting that targeting FOXQ1 may be a promising strategy in breast cancer therapy [45]. In the same 
year, another study from immunology confirmed that iron-death-dependent breast cancer cell-derived exosomes inhibit 
breast cancer cell migration and invasion by suppressing M2 macrophage polarization, and this study provides a new 
therapeutic strategy for breast cancer patients [46].
The study by Wang Xiaoping et al. found that the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) inhibits the progression 
and chemoresistance of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by regulating GPX4 expression using cellular and animal 
model experiments [47]. In 2024, more research results are available. From a bioinformatics perspective, Liang Shuang 
et al. identified three essential ferroptosis-related genes (TXNIP, SLC2A1, and ATF3) associated with breast cancer based on 
bioinformatics and machine learning techniques, which are closely related to breast cancer occurrence, progression, and 
prognosis [48]. At the gene level, Li Jun et al. found that the gene POU2F2 transcriptionally activates PTPRG-AS1 and then 
regulates ferroptosis and proliferation through miR-376c-3p/SLC7A11 to promote the development of triple-negative 
breast cancer [49]. Meanwhile, some genes that inhibit mammary gland development by regulating ferroptosis were 
also found. Xiaofan et al. found that the long-stranded noncoding RNA (lncRNA) LncFASA increased the susceptibility 
of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to ferroptosis, suggesting a critical role of this lncRNA in ferroptosis-mediated 
cancer development and providing new insights into therapeutic strategies for breast cancer [50]. Another study found 
that low prostaglandin E receptor 3 (PTGER3) gene expression protects triple-negative breast cancer cells from a critical 
ferroptosis pathway, promoting their progression. Therefore, PTGER3 may serve as a novel and promising TNBC biomarker 
and therapeutic target [51]. A study by Song Xiang et al. demonstrated that SR-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) inhibits 
ferroptosis and reduces cisplatin chemosensitivity in triple-negative breast cancer cells through the circSEPT9/GCH1 
axis, providing a promising strategy for cisplatin-resistant treatment of TNBC [52].
In addition to genes, some proteins have also been found to play a role in breast cancer development. Chen’s study 
revealed that guanosine triphosphatase hydrolase (GTPase) activating protein 6 (ARHGAP6) inhibits breast cancer tumor 
growth by inducing ferroptosis through RhoA/ROCK1/p38MAPK signaling and that combining ARHGAP6 with ferroptosis 
inducers may be a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment [53]. Another study found that thrombin 
could induce ferroptosis in triple-negative breast cancer through the cPLA2α/ACSL4 signaling pathway, which predicts 
the potential of the thrombin-ACSL4 axis as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of TNBC [54]. Xue’s study 
showed the importance of exogenous cysteine in CYTL1 low-expressing breast cancer cells and emphasized the potential 
metabolic vulnerability to the target [55]. Another study explored tumor immunity in the treatment of breast cancer. 
They showed that short-term acidosis induced ferroptosis in breast cancer cells through the ZFAND5/SLC3A2 signaling 
axis, which promotes phagocytosis and ferroptosis in M1 macrophage-polarized breast cancer cells, which may be a 
novel mechanism for breast cancer treatment [56].
In drug research, researchers have also made many excellent results. For example, Pitavastatin induced autophagy-
dependent ferroptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells via the mevalonate pathway [57], SBFI26-induced ferroptosis in triple-
negative breast cancer cells via Lipid peroxidation [58], co-treatment of cucurbitacin B and erastin synergistically induced 
ferroptosis in breast cancer cells via alteration of iron-regulated proteins and lipid peroxidation [59], β-Eudesmol inhibits 
cell proliferation and induces ferroptosis by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway in breast cancer [60]. Peiminine 
triggers ferroptosis by triggering Nrf2 signaling to inhibit breast cancer growth [61]. In addition to the above drugs, 
nanomaterials have given breast cancer patients a glimpse of a cure. Ruixue Wei et al. systematically reviewed the 
current cancer treatment strategies based on iron-based ferroptosis inducers, summarized the advantages of these 
different ferroptosis inducers, and elucidated the prospects to provide better guidance for the development of iron-based 
nanomaterials ferroptosis inducers [62]. Wei proposed a lysosome-targeted magnetic nano-torquer (T7-MNT) that can 
dynamically induce a burst of endogenous Fe2+ pools in breast cancer cells, and this dynamic targeting strategy can 
be combined with current iron-death inducers to achieve enhanced therapeutic efficacy and to stimulate the design 
of mechanistic iron-death inducers for cancer therapeutics [63]. Chai et al. developed a multifunctional coordination 
polymer-loaded liposome for synergistic chemotherapy of TNBC with ferroptosis activation, which provides a new 
therapeutic strategy for treating TNBC with potential clinical applications [64]. In their study, Zhou et al. developed an 
albumin-based nanomedicine to induce enhanced ferroptosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by depletion of 
glutathione (GSH) and inhibition of DHODH activity, and this work provides a practical and easy-to-accomplish strategy 
for the treatment of TNBC with promising clinical applications [65].
Currently, four main pathways for inducing ferroptosis have been found [9]: inducing intracellular lipid peroxidation 
through peroxides [66], inhibiting GPX activity [67], inhibiting the Xc-system [68], and consuming reduced coenzyme Q10

| https://doi.org/10.1007/s12672-024-01569-x
[69]. Most studies on the regulatory mechanism of ferroptosis in breast cancer focus on one or two of the main pathways, 
and few studies include the above four pathways, which ignores the interaction between the entire regulatory system 
of ferroptosis. Due to the heterogeneity of breast cancer, the regulatory mechanism of ferroptosis may be different in 
different patients or different types of breast cancer, and it is difficult to have targeted ferroptosis drugs to treat multiple 
types of breast cancer. In clinical practice, there are currently no specific biomarkers for diagnosing ferroptosis [67]. 
Specific biomarkers are necessary for the clinical diagnosis of ferroptosis and crucial for the efficacy evaluation and 
prognosis monitoring of innovative drugs targeting ferroptosis. At the same time, it is also meaningful to find ferroptosis-
specific biomarkers that can reflect the severity of the disease. In addition, there is limited research on the use parameters 
of ferroptosis inducers or inhibitors, such as dosage, administration time, administration method, and drug half-life. Most 
current studies remain at the primary research stage, with cell lines and animal models as the experimental subjects, 
and few clinical experiments, so there are few evaluations of clinical safety and efficacy, which hinders the promotion 
and application of ferroptosis as a target for breast cancer treatment in the clinic. Comprehensive preclinical and clinical 
trials are essential to verify the role of ferroptosis in human physiology and lay the foundation for ferroptosis as a target 
for breast cancer treatment.
This Article uses relatively objective and comprehensive data analysis to present the current status of research 
in the field of “ferroptosis and breast cancer” visually. However, it must be admitted that this study still has some 
limitations. (1) This study only collected articles written in English in the WoSCC database. Articles in other languages or 
databases were not included in our study, which means that some valuable studies may be missed, limiting the study’s 
comprehensiveness. In retrieving data, we found that after setting the publication language to English, the number 
of retrieved articles did not change, and it was still 661, indicating that no articles in other languages appeared in this 
field. (2) We retrieved papers published in the decade from 2014 to 2024 on May 11, 2024. However, the database is 
still being updated, and some of the latest published articles may not be included. At the same time, due to the lag in 
citation influence, the influence of some recently published high-level articles may need to be considered. (3) Although 
the software objectively performs the entire data analysis process, there is an individual subjective bias in interpreting 
these results.
4  Conclusion
This paper comprehensively combed and analyzed the literature on breast cancer and ferroptosis from 2014 to 
2024, providing valuable reference value for researchers in this field. This paper used bibliometric methods to obtain 
data such as annual output trends, countries/regions, research institutions/researchers, journals, subject categories, 
references/co-citations, keywords, genes, and related diseases in this field. Inhibiting the growth of cancer cells by 
accelerating ferroptosis of breast cancer cells is currently a hot topic and frontier of research. Drug development based 
on nanomaterials has gradually become a new treatment strategy, bringing hope for practical clinical applications. 
However, more and broader cooperation is needed worldwide. Our analysis results will help researchers discover new 
perspectives, determine future research directions, and promote more profound research in this field.
