Background: HLA Class I molecules are involved in antigen presentation and cytotoxic CD8+ T cell activation and their 
downregulation in cancer cells may contribute to tumor immune evasion and dissemination. Prostate cancer (PCa) is poorly 
immunogenic and elucidating the mechanisms preventing immunologic activity against the tumor will improve our understanding of 
tumor biology and development of target therapies. We examined HLA class I protein expression in untreated PCa and its 
association with tumor infiltrating immune cell subsets and clinicopathological features. 
Design: A cohort of 339 grade-matched, self-identified White or Black men with surgically-treated PCa (Race cohort, RC) and a 
cohort of 323 surgically-treated patients with intermediate/high risk PCa (Natural History cohort, NHC) were assessed for HLA 
Class I protein expression via immunohistochemistry (IHC) on a tissue microarray. Tumors were semi-quantitatively scored for HLA 
Class I intensity (0/1+/2+/3+) and dichotomously grouped by absent/low (0/1+) and high (2+/3+) expression for analysis. Cases 
with heterogenous loss of HLA Class I expression were included in the absent/low expression group. The results were compared 
with previously published clinicopathological data, immune cell subset densities, and B7-H3 expression. 
Results: Absent/low expression of HLA Class I was observed in 8% and 11% of cases in the RC and NHC, respectively, with only 
2% of cases in both cohorts having complete loss. Absent/low HLA expression was associated with higher grade group in the NHC 
(p=0.002) and higher stage (p=0.0008) or non-organ confined disease (p=0.034) in the RC. Absent/low HLA expression was 
significantly associated with lower T-cell (p=0.002) and T-cell subsets densities (p=0.0009 for CD8 cells and p=0.007 for FOXP3 
cells) in the RC, and with lower T-(p=0.01) and B-cell (p=0.02) densities in the NHC. Interestingly, expression of the 
immunomodulatory B7-H3 (CD276) protein was inversely correlated with HLA expression in both cohorts (p=0.005 and p=0.001). 
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show the correlation between HLA Class I protein expression and immune 
cell density in primary PCa, corroborating with its role in immune cell activation. The inverse correlation of HLA Class I expression 
with B7-H3 is a novel finding and may be relevant in future clinical trials of enoblituzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting B7-H3, 
in PCa. Future work will focus on digital quantification of HLA Class I expression.

Background: Large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumors (LCCSCTs) are rare testicular tumors and approximately 40% of patients 
present in the context of an inherited tumor predisposition syndrome, such as Carney complex or Peutz-Jeghers. While the 
immunomorphologic features of these tumors has been characterized, the genetic profile of sporadic LCCSCTs is largely unknown. 
Design: The aim of our study was to evaluate clinico-morphologic features and molecular characterization of LCCSCTs 
including PRKAR1A gene mutations and other novel alterations and gene expression. LCCSCTs diagnosed at 2 institutions were 
identified. H&E slides were reviewed to evaluate morphologic features. Clinical charts and outcome data were reviewed. Targeted 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed. 
Results: Eight LCCSCTs were included (median 17, range 5-37 years). Two patients (25%) had Carney complex diagnosis on 
subsequent germline genetic testing. Grossly, 6 (75%) tumors were well-circumscribed and 2 (25%) showed extratesticular 
extension. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of nests, cords and tubules of pale to deeply eosinophilic cells within a 
myxohyaline, often calcified stroma. In 2 cases, several adverse pathological features were identified: significant cytologic atypia, 
necrosis, mitoses, LVI and extratesticular extension. Targeted NGS detected PRKAR1A mutations in all (100 %) cases with 
heterozygous PRKAR1A mutation in 6 (75%) tumors and germline Carney complex- associated PRKAR1A in 2 (25%) patients. 
Additionally, CDKN1B and TERT mutations were identified in 1 of the 2 malignant cases.  All tumors showed low tumor mutational 
burden and unremarkable copy number alterations except for frequent LOH of 17q24 including PRKAR1A locus. RNA expression 
analysis showed increased expression of several markers including novel PRUNE2, and usual markers like beta-catenin, calretinin, 
inhibin and S100. Median follow-up period was 26 months. One patient presented with metastatic disease involving lymph nodes 
 
  
 
S678 
and developed lung metastasis 20 months later. This tumor showed adverse pathological features and had an additional driver 
mutation. 
Conclusions: While LCCSCTs have been reported in the setting of cancer predisposition syndromes, the majority of these tumors 
occur sporadically. PRKAR1A mutations are present in all cases and appear to be the major driver and can serve as a genetic 
marker for diagnosis of LCCSCTs. It remains to be determined whether malignant progression may be caused by additional driver 
mutations.

Background: Tumor heterogeneity of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is well known. There is an increasing need to identify high grade 
RCC via percutaneous needle core biopsy. This study investigates whether precise radiologic-pathologic correlation can be used to 
delineate the imaging signatures of aggressive features of RCC in ex vivo radical nephrectomy specimens. 
Design: Twenty patients with large renal cell masses were prospectively enrolled. Following radical nephrectomy, the kidney was 
placed in a 3D mold created based on the presurgery imaging. Three tissue localization clips were placed in the tumor and imaged 
by noncontrast MRI and CT. The specimen was grossed following routine protocol and three additional consecutive sections were 
obtained around each localization clip. Each section was assessed for tumor subtype, tumor grade, sarcomatoid transformation or 
rhabdoid features, the amount of hyalinized stroma and blood clot on H&E slides. These features were precisely correlated with ex 
vivo CT and MRI imaging data using the clips as landmarks and radiomics features were extracted from each clip site. 
Results: The 20 RCC cases included 15 clear cell, 3 papillary, and 2 chromophobe. 147 sections obtained around the clip sites 
were eligible for analysis and contained the following features: 84 sections showed high-grade tumor, with nuclear grades 3-4; 28 
had sarcomatoid transformation and/or rhabdoid features; 17 had tumor necrosis; 31 had hyalinized stroma, 11 of which were 
without viable tumor cells. Ten different machine learning algorithms were trained using the radiomics data from MRI and CT 
imaging to distinguish high versus low grade tumor and to identify tumor necrosis.  Support vector machine algorithm of MRI 
showed a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 92% for identifying high grade tumors using T1 non-contrast images. The k-nearest 
neighbor algorithm of CT imaging showed a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 85% in identifying high grade tumors. Logistic 
regression of CT imaging identified areas of tumor necrosis with a sensitivity and specificity of 86% and 86% respectively. 
Conclusions: Preliminary data from this precise ex vivo radiological-pathologic correlation model suggests that high grade areas 
of heterogeneous RCC may be identifiable using unenhanced CT and MRI radiomics features. Features learned from this ex 
vivo model may be used to guide high yield renal mass biopsies in the future.

Background: The presence of large cribriform growth pattern 4 in Grade Group (GG) 2 and GG3 prostate cancers has been 
associated with a worse pathological outcome at radical prostatectomy (RP) and a higher risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR). 
However, it has not yet been truly proven whether this pattern has independent prognostic value, or whether it is confounded by 
other coexisting variables. We have recently demonstrated that large cribriform pattern 4 is a co-dependent variable with the 
percent of Gleason pattern 4 (GP4%) and tumor volume (TV) in GG2 and GG3 cancers and does not independently affect 
 
  
 
S679 
pathological RP outcomes when the latter two variables are accounted for. In this study, we assess whether large cribriform pattern 
4 influences BCR after RP when other established risk factors are accounted for. 
Design: 496 RP’s with GG2 and GG3 prostate cancers were reviewed in a retrospective cohort analysis. Using a multivariate COX 
regression model, the individual predictive value of large cribriform pattern 4 for BCR was analyzed and controlled for tumor stage, 
surgical margin status, GP4%, and TV. 
Results: 107 (21.6%) patients experienced BCR. Large cribriform pattern 4 was seen in larger tumors with higher GP4%, more 
frequent positive margin, and more advanced stage. In univariable analysis all of these measures correlated with BCR (all P<0.05). 
In multivariable analysis, tumor stage pT3b (32/496; OR=2.7; p=0.01), positive surgical margins (175/496; OR=2.7; p=<0.001), 
higher GP4% (OR=1.02; p=<0.001), and higher tumor volume (OR=1.37; p=0.001) were found to be individual independent 
predictors for BCR after RP, while large cribriform growth pattern (273/496; P=0.37), stage pT3a (239/496; p=0.47) and stage pT2+ 
(44/496; p=0.45) were not. 
Conclusions: Large cribriform pattern 4 is a co-dependent variable with other established risk factors for BCR. After controlling for 
tumor stage, surgical margin status, GP4%, and TV, all of which were individual independent predictors of BCR, large cribriform 
pattern 4 lost its independent influence on BCR after RP in GG2 and GG3 cancers. While other studies have previously 
hypothesized that large cribriform growth pattern 4 is an individual predictor for recurrence, it appears to us that not all variables 
were considered. The currently described finding has significant implications on management and counseling of patients with a 
diagnosis of large cribriform pattern 4 at radical prostatectomy.

Disclosures: Abbas Agaimy: None; Robert Stoehr: None; Arndt Hartmann: None; Nasir Ud Din: None 
Background: Primary renal Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) are rare, representing <% of all kidney tumors and <4% of all 
ESFTs. Diagnosis is based on characteristic morphology supplemented by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD99 and NKX2.2 and 
demonstration of EWSR1 rearrangements. Recent studies however have pointed to rare occurrence of other EWSR1-rearranged 
non-ESFTs in the kidney, thus questioning the reliability of EWSR1 FISH testing. 
Design: We retrieved and reviewed all renal ESFTs including any EWSR1-rearranged mesenchymal neoplasm to illustrate the 
spectrum and differential of these rare entities. Molecular testing was performed via targeted RNA sequencing and/ 
or EWSR1 FISH. 
Results: Overall, 30 tumors were identified (22 ESFTs and 8 others). The ESFTs affected 12 males and 10 females aged 7 to 66 y 
(median, 25). Median size was 12.5 cm (3.5 – 17). EWSR1 rearrangements was confirmed by either NGS or FISH in 16/22 cases; 
all 14 sequenced cases revealed the canonical EWSR1::FLI1 fusion. Age range for non-ESFTs was 23 – 76 (median, 46). Affected 
were 5 females and 3 males. The size rang was 3 – 22 cm (median, 7.1). The histology of the non-ESFT corresponded to 
sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma/ low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (3; two with confirmed EWSR1::CREB3L1 and all three were 
MUC4+), two unclassified sarcomas with epithelioid features and EWSR1::CREM fusions, and one case each of desmoplastic 
small round cell tumor (EWSR1::WT1+), unclassified round/ spindle cell sarcoma (EWSR1::PATZ1), and myoepithelial carcinoma 
(EWSR1::POU5F1P3). Only a single epithelial malignancy with an EWSR1 rearrangement was encountered (follicular thyroid -like 
carcinoma with an EWSR1::LOC284889 fusion). No EWSR1::TFE3-fusion MiTF carcinoma was found during study period.

Conclusions: This series expands the histogenetic, phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of EWSR1-rearranged primary 
mesenchymal renal neoplasms showing that ESFT is the most frequent entity (73% of all cases) occurring at lower age (25 y), 
mainly in males while non-ESFTs represent a heterogeneous category encompassing a verity of rare but either well defined 
(LGFMS/SEF) or emerging (CREM-rearranged sarcoma and myoepithelial carcinoma) entities occurring at relatively higher age (46 
y), mainly in females. Inclusion of these newer entities in the differential diagnosis is mandatory, given the heterogeneous tumor 
behavior and the varying responsiveness to chemotherapy. Finally, identification of the exact fusion variants and not the 
simple EWSR1 FISH has diagnostic impact as the genotypic landscape of these rare cancers is still emerging.

Background: Bladder small cell carcinoma (SmCC) can be classified into distinct subtypes based on the expression of the novel 
neuroendocrine (NE) markers ASCL1, NEUROD1 and POU2F3. Single cell RNA sequencing of lung SmCC showed a distinct 
PLCG2-high subpopulation with stem cell-like and pro-metastasis features and poor prognosis. We evaluated PLCG2 expression in 
bladder NE carcinoma and correlated the expression with that of novel NE markers and clinical outcomes. 
Design: We identified 102 SmCC and 20 large cell NE carcinomas (LCNEC), 32 of which co-existed with a non-NE component. 
Cases were assembled in tissue microarray blocks. IHC for PLCG2 and NE markers CD56, SYP, CHR, INSM1, NEUROD1, 
ASCL1, POU2F3, DLL3 was performed. Co-expression patterns were assessed between markers, and associations with 
progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and pathological response to neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy were 
analyzed. 
Results: Interpretable results were available from 116 cases (98 SmCC and 18 LCNEC), of which 40 (34%) were positive for 
PLCG2. PLCG2 was expressed more frequently in LCNEC than SmCC (54% vs 29%) and H-score was higher in LCNEC (median 
30, IQR: 0-82 vs. SmCC median 0, IQR: 0-15), although differences were not significant. PLCG2 was expressed in only 4 of non-
NE components in mixed tumors. Expression of PLCG2 was positively correlated with that of POU2F3 (spearman corr  0.76, p < 
0.001) and negatively correlated with other tested NE markers (p<0.05 for ASCL1, NEUROD1, SYP and DLL3). In a subset of 72 
patients with M0 disease who underwent RC, tumors expressing PLCG2 or POU2F3 were associated with worse PFS and OS 
(p<0.05) but their expression was not associated with metastasis status or pathologic response to neoadjuvant/adjuvant 
chemotherapy. There were no significant differences in OS or PFS between any other marker +/- groups.

Figure 2 - 695 
 
Conclusions: In neuroendocrine carcinoma of the bladder, PLCG2 and POU2F3 are expressed in approximately 34% and 24% of 
tumors, respectively, and their expression is associated with shorter progression-free and overall survival. PLCG2 positive NE 
carcinoma of bladder shows infrequent expression of both traditional and novel NE markers. There is a strong correlation between 
PLCG2 and POU2F3 expression, and the biologic significance of such an association is not yet fully elucidated. In sum, our data 
suggest that PLCG2+ and POU2F3+ NE carcinomas define a new molecular subset of potential prognostic significance.

Background: Renal cell carcinoma with fibromyomatous stroma (RCC-FMS) is a rare renal tumor that was included in the 2016 
World Health Organization classification of renal tumors as an emerging/provisional entity. Recent studies documented the 
presence of TSC1, TSC2, and MTOR mutations in subset of these tumors. Most importantly, these have no molecular alterations in 
the VHL gene. These tumors were separated from the RCC with mutation of ELOC (formerly TCEB1) which now represents a 
distinct molecularly defined entity in the current 2022 WHO classification system.  We herein studied the clinicopathologic and 
molecular characteristics of RCC-FMS 
Design: Fifteen RCC-FMS were included in this study. The H&E stained slides were reviewed, and 5 tumors underwent next-
generation sequencing. Follow-up information was obtained from patients’ electronic records 
Results: Ten were men, and 5 were women, with an age range of 32-76 years (median 62 years) and tumor size range of 1.7-11 
cm (median 2.2 cm). None had significant medical history. One patient had ipsilateral chromophobe RCC and developed 
recurrence of the chromophobe RCC. Histologically, tumors were circumscribed and composed of nodules and nests of cells with 
clear cytoplasm and were embedded in a cellular stroma formed of bundles of smooth muscle fibers. Two-thirds were of 
WHO/ISUP nucleolar grade 2. No tumor necrosis or mitotic figures in the epithelial or spindle cell components was noted. 
Immunohistochemically, tumors were consistently positive for keratin 7 (12/12), carbonic anhydrase-9 (11/11) and CD10 (11/11), 
whereas they were negative for AMACR (8/8) and translocation carcinoma markers [TFE3, cathepsin K, HMB45 or Melan A (5/5)]. 
Additionally, the smooth muscle stroma was highlighted by desmin, caldesmon and/ or smooth muscle actin (7/7). Using next-
generation sequencing, one tumor had mutation in TSC1 and one had mutation in TSC2 genes. No pathogenic mutations were 
identified in ELOC (TCEB1) gene. Follow up data were available for 10 patients, showing no evidence of recurrence or metastasis 
at a median follow up of 12 months (range, 4-130 months). 
Conclusions: RCC-FMS has a distinct morphology with characteristic immunohistochemical and molecular features, including 
alterations in the TSC genes. Further studies are necessary to determine whether these should be considered a distinct tumor type, 
or part of other tumor entities such as clear cell renal cell tumor.

697   A Contemporary Clinicopathological Analysis of Renal Cell Carcinoma with Vena Cava 
Involvement

Disclosures: Omar Al-Rusan: None; Viraj Master: None; Adeboye Osunkoya: None 
Background: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is occasionally associated with vena cava (VC) involvement. Despite recent advances in 
chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic modalities, the 5-year survival in this population continues to be poor. Therefore, further 
studies are required to better characterize this patient population, especially from the clinicopathologic standpoint. 
Design: A comprehensive review of patients with RCC and VC involvement managed at our institution from 2014-2022 was 
performed. Multiple clinicopathologic parameters including follow-up were obtained. 
Results: A total of 114 patients with RCC and VC involvement were included in the study. The mean patient age was 63 years 
(range: 30-84 years). The cohort consisted of 78/114 (68%) males and 36/114 (32%) females. The mean primary tumor size 
(excluding tumor thrombus) was 11 cm. The majority of tumors (104/114, 91.2%) were unifocal. Tumor stages were categorized as 
follows: pT3b (51/114, 44%), pT3c (52/114, 46%), and pT4 (11/114, 10%). Most of the tumors were clear cell RCC 89/114 (78.0%), 
although other more aggressive RCC subtypes were also present. Most tumors were WHO/ISUP grade 3 (44/114, 38.5%) or 4 
(67/114, 58.7%) with sarcomatoid differentiation present in 39/67 (58.2%). Necrosis was present in 94/114 (82.4%) tumors. Twenty 
three of 114 (20.1%) tumors were categorized as pM1 and the ipsilateral adrenal gland was the most common site of metastasis. 
Of the 91 patients categorized as pMX at nephrectomy, 42/91 (46.1%) subsequently developed metastasis, most frequently to the 
lung. Of all patients, only 16/114 (14%) had positive vascular margins and 7/114 (6.1%) had positive soft tissue margins despite 
having very advanced disease. 
Conclusions: This is one of the largest contemporary institutional studies on the detailed clinicopathologic findings of RCC with VC 
involvement. Our study demonstrates that a significant number of patients with VC involvement still benefit from radical 
nephrectomy/tumor debulking performed by an experienced urologic oncologist. This could conceivably play a critical role in 
counseling, management, and second opinions for patients with RCC and VC involvement detected on imaging.

Background: The Gleason grade is an important prognostic factor in prostate cancer but suffers from high discordance among 
pathologists (up to 30-50%). To this end, we developed a deep learning algorithm for the detection and grading of cancer in 
prostate needle biopsy tissues. Here, we evaluate the performance of the AI algorithm on independent, consecutively accrued real-
world cases that the algorithm had not previously seen. 
Design: A pilot study confirmed the workflow of the project. Hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E) stained diagnostic prostate core needle 
biopsies processed at an independent hospital were prospectively enrolled from November 2021 to March 2022. Four board-
certified and subspecialty-trained GU pathologists rendered standard-of-care clinical diagnoses after review of all H&E-stained 
levels using microscopes, using ancillary studies as needed. Slides were scanned using a 3DHISTECH scanner at 40x 
magnification and provided to the AI model for analysis without site-specific tuning. Analysis was performed to assess the 
diagnostic concordance of the algorithm compared to the original hospital diagnoses, with the primary endpoint of cancer detection 
and secondary endpoint of Gleason grading. The reference standard diagnosis was derived from the three pathologists not 
involved in the original diagnosis. 
Results: A total of 1701 prostate biopsy slides from 851 biopsy sites of 141 consecutive patients were included. A reference 
standard was constructed for 599 biopsy sites of 101 patients. A review of false-positive results given by the algorithm showed that 
the model tends to misclassify atrophic glands and seminal vesicles as suspicious for cancer. Compared to the reference standard, 
the AI model showed a sensitivity of 0.992 and a specificity of 0.844 for cancer detection while the sensitivity and specificity of 
original diagnoses (pathologists compared to reference standard) were 0.979 and 0.994, respectively. The results showed 
substantial diagnostic concordance between the AI model's grade group classification and the reference standard (0.820 quadratic-
weighted Cohen’s kappa coefficient).

Figure 2 - 698 
Conclusions: This study validates the AI algorithm in an independent set of cases that the algorithm had not previously seen and 
also highlights its potential benefit as a high-sensitivity tool in anatomic pathology practice. Overall, the AI model shows the 
potential to be a versatile tool with varied use-cases in real-world settings.

Background: Classification of renal tumors has expanded significantly in the past decade with identification of renal tumors with 
defining molecular alterations. The World Health Organization’s 2022 classification now includes a new class of Molecularly 
Defined Renal Carcinomas (RCCs), a first step in the molecular classification of renal tumors. Recognition of morphological 
features is the first step in evaluation of renal tumors and directing molecular workup. The objective of the study was to review and 
characterize histomorphological features of renal tumors with known molecular alterations.  
Design: Renal tumors in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were reviewed to identify tumors with known pathogenic 
molecular alterations previously reported. Single representative digital slides and pathology reports for each case available through 
the database were consensus reviewed by 5 genitourinary pathologists and morphologic features recorded. 
Results: There were 52 cases of RCCs identified with a previously known molecular abnormality within the papillary (KIRP), clear 
cell (KIRC), and chromophobe (KICH) data sets. Morphological features of these are listed in Table-1.  Salient findings included 
presence of both low- and high-grade histology in TFE3 rearranged RCCs, TFEB amplified RCCs, Succinate dehydrogenase 
(SDH) mutated RCCs and RCCs with mutations in mismatch repair genes. One of three cases of ELOC mutated RCC 
demonstrated infiltrative features. Significant morphologic overlap was noted across most molecularly defined 
tumors.  SDH mutations included SDHA (2), SDHC (1), SDHD (1) and SDHB (1) and were all present in the KIRP database with 
none identified in the KICH database. Pseudostratification of nuclei in FH mutated RCCs (2/3) and nuclear grooves in SDH mutated 
RCCs (2/5) were intriguing findings that we have not previously encountered. Mucin was noted in NF2, KRAS and SDH mutated 
and ALK rearranged tumors.

Conclusions: There exists significant morphologic heterogeneity and phenotypic overlap across RCCs with defined molecular 
alterations and morphologic features provide limited clues to subclassification of RCCs. While the number of diagnostic entities for 
kidney tumors continues to increase, we must recognize that many of these entities have overlapping/subtle features that makes

histologic classification challenging/impossible, thereby highlighting the significant role molecular typing currently plays in renal 
pathology and will continue to play in the future.

Background: Bladder diverticula are outpouchings of urothelial mucosa through weaknesses in the muscular wall. The 
clinicopathologic and molecular profiles of bladder intra-diverticular carcinomas (BIDC) are not fully established. In addition, staging 
BIDC is complicated by altered anatomy, primarily due to absence of a muscularis propria in the wall. 
Design: A retrospective review of all bladder diverticula with neoplasia was performed from 2005-2022, and identified 95 primary 
BIDC with complete resections. Tumor type, grade, stage and diverticular wall constituents were evaluated. Targeted next-
generation sequencing was performed on 28 tumors, including additional 4 BIDC biopsies without resection. 
Results: BIDC was primarily seen in men (n=93, 98%), with median age of 70y (49-95y). Diverticulectomy or partial cystectomy 
was performed in 66 cases (69%) & radical cystectomy in 29 (31%). Non-invasive carcinoma was noted in 23 cases (24%, 8=flat, 
13=high-grade papillary, 2=low-grade papillary). Invasion was present in 72 cases (76%), 43 of which invaded the perivesical fat 
(45%). Urothelial carcinoma NOS was the most common in invasive tumors, 35 cases (37%). Divergent differentiation was present 
in 28 cases (30%), most commonly as squamous (n=17, 61%). Micropapillary features were noted in 4 cases (4%). Pure squamous 
cell carcinoma was seen in 2 cases and adenocarcinoma was noted in one case. Muscularis mucosa was identified in 77/84 cases 
(92%) with median thickness of 0.4 mm (ranging from wisps/0.1 mm to 1.0 mm) and 45 cases (58%) showed hypertrophic features 
(defined as ≥ 0.4 mm). Muscularis propria was identified in 78/84 cases (93%); located mainly at the edge of the os (n=67) or 
surrounding the diverticula (n=11). Seven patients had lymph node metastases and 9 patients developed distant metastasis. In 28 
tumors profiled, oncogenic/likely oncogenic mutations were detected in TERT 
promoter (75%) TP53 (50%), ERBB2 (29%), KMT2D (29%), RB1 (25%), CDKN1A (25%), KDM6A (21%) and PIK3CA (21%). 
Notable copy number alterations include CDKN2A deletion (29%) and MDM2 amplification (14%). Oncogenic FGFR3 mutations 
were rare (7%). 
Conclusions: Primary BIDC arise mainly in adult males and span the entire spectrum of tumors arising within the bladder proper. 
BIDC shows a higher percentage of invasive tumors, but comparable rate of divergent differentiation to bladder proper tumors. The 
molecular profiles of BIDC are overall comparable to usual bladder urothelial carcinoma.

Background: Immunotherapy is being increasingly used as a neoadjuvant treatment in the management of advanced stage renal 
cell carcinoma. We present the largest cohort of such cases & outline guidelines for the pathologic examination & reporting of these 
cases. 
Design: 70 cases of RCC s/p immunotherapy & nephrectomy collected from 2015-2022 were evaluated. A grossing protocol was 
developed to assess percent viable tumor. A complete cross section of the largest diameter of tumor was submitted along with 
sections from areas of gross extrarenal involvement. Percentage of necrosis was reported as an average by assessing gross & 
microscopic necrosis. Follow up (FU) was calculated in months from the date of surgery to the last known event.  
Results: We found a discrepancy between the gross & the microscopic stages in 15 cases; 12 cases were grossly pT3 (including 8 
with a renal vein thrombus), 2 were pT4; all with no viable extrarenal tumor. Of these, 1 pT1 tumor & 3 pT3 tumors showed 
complete pathologic response. We divided groups based on % viable tumor in the post treatment nephrectomy. Group A (n=21, 
mean FU 37.5 mths) showed <20% viable tumor. Group B: (n=48, mean FU 37.6 mths) showed ≥ 20% viable tumor. 1 case did not 
have % viable tumor available. Kaplan Meir curve showed statistically significant differences in survival within the 2 groups p=0.261 
 
  
 
S686 
(Fig 2). Common histologic findings included hypocellularity, hyalinization, chronic inflammation & myxoid change. Pseudoprogression (an increase 
in T size of 2 or more cm post therapy) was noted in 8 cases, predominantly due to dense inflammatory infiltrate mimicking a mass lesion grossly; 1 
such case showed a pathologic CR and a gross tumor size of 11.5 cm. 
 
Figure 1 - 701 
 
Figure 2 - 701 
 
Conclusions: There is a distinct survival difference in patients with <20% viable tumor vs those with ≥ 20% viable tumor. pT stage 
should be based on the extent of the microscopically viable tumor, as there may be a disconnect between extent of the 
microscopically viable tumor vs the grossly visible tumor. Conventional staging guidelines may not apply to such cases due to 
discrepancy between the gross estimate of tumor burden and microscopic extent of viable tumor. Extensive sampling of grossly 
visible tumor outside the kidney is essential to exclude microscopic tumor involvement, to avoid inaccurate downstaging of the 
tumor. Although long term FU data is limited in our cohort, there may be some benefit to routinely reporting percent viable tumor in 
post treatment resection specimens.

Background: Renal tumor biopsy (RTB) is increasingly used to guide the clinical management of patients with small renal masses. 
Renal tumours with oncocytic morphology are among the most difficult to classify at RTB since the distinction between oncocytoma 
and chomophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC) has significant implications for patient management and can be challenging in 
limited specimens. In addition, a number of emerging entities with low-grade oncocytic morphology have been recently described. 
In this study we evaluated the spectrum of oncocytic tumours diagnosed in a series of RTB and correlated with final diagnosis in 
patients undergoing nephrectomy. 
Design: Cases were identified from a consecutive institutional RTB series. All RTB with a diagnosis or differential diagnosis 
including oncocytoma, ChRCC or low-grade oncocytic neoplasm that could not be classified (incorporating new and emerging 
entities and tumours with intermediate or hybrid features) were included. High grade and papillary tumours with eosinophilic 
morphology were not part of this study. RTB findings were correlated with final diagnosis in cases undergoing nephrectomy. 
Diagnosis was based on the original classification at the time of reporting with review of discordant cases. 
 
  
 
S687 
Results: Of 425 RTB, the biopsy diagnosis was oncocytoma/favor oncocytoma in 69% (291/425); ChRCC/favor ChRCC in 27% 
(116/425) and oncocytic neoplasm NOS (indeterminate) in 18/425 (4%). The latter included tumors with features of emerging 
entities including 7 low-grade oncocytic tumor (LOT) and 2 eosinophilic vacuolated tumor (EVT). 85 patients 
had subsequent nephrectomy (table 1). The RTB and final diagnosis was discordant in 3 cases (4%). In 1 discordant case, there 
was very minimal lesional tissue (<1mm) in the biopsy which limited interpretation. On review, the remaining 2 discordant cases 
showed features consistent with newly described emerging entities (LOT x 1; EVT x 1).

Conclusions: Despite known challenges, there was overall good concordance between RTB and nephrectomy for the diagnosis of 
oncocytic tumours. Discordance occurred primarily in tumours with hybrid or intermediate features and some of these cases could 
be reclassified based on recently described emerging entities. Additional evaluation of the series and correlation with clinical 
outcome is underway. Further defining reproducible criteria for clinically relevant categories of oncocytic neoplasms may aid risk 
stratification at RTB to optomise patient management.

Background: Rarely müllerian epithelial tumors (also referred to as ovarian-type epithelial tumors) arise in the testis and 
paratesticular region. They may arise from müllerian metaplasia of the peritoneal surface of the tunica vaginalis in a process similar 
to that of primary peritoneal serous tumors in women or from embryonic remnants such as the appendix testis. Most of these 
tumors are borderline serous tumors but low and high-grade serous carcinomas have also been reported in this location. 
Design: We therefore investigated the clinical, morphologic, and immunohistochemical features of 29 cases of high-grade serous 
carcinomas of the testis and paratesticular region diagnosed at two Tertiary Cancer Centers from 1999 to 2021 to better 
characterize and understand these lesions. Clinical information was obtained from the Institutional clinical files 
Results: The patients were from 49 to 76 years of age (mean 59 years) and all underwent radical orchiectomy. Presenting 
symptoms included, palpable masses (58%) and scrotal enlargement (42%); 14 were left-sided.  Tumors were located in the tunica 
vaginalis (41.3%), spermatic cord (27.5%), testis (17.2%) and epididymis (13.7%). None of the patients had elevated serum 
markers. The tumors measured 1.8 to 9.0 cm (mean 3.5 cm) in size. All cases (100%) had infiltrative borders. Histologically they 
showed the various typical patterns of high-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary. The predominant morphology was papillary, 
glandular and solid. On immunohistochemical study, the tumor cells were positive for AE1/AE-3 cytokeratin (29/29), CK7(29/29), 
PAX 8 (29/29), WT-1 (29/29), Calretinin (14/29) and Estrogen Receptor (18/29). Ber.EP4, CK20, OCT3 and SALL4 were 
negative. At presentation, 11 patients had retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis and 3 patients had lung metastasis. Follow-up 
available in 27 cases (range 14-82 months, median 52 months), showed 12 (44.4%) dead of disease, 9 (33.3%) alive with disease 
and 6 (22.2%) alive without disease 
Conclusions: This series, the largest to date, confirmed the aggressive behavior for high-grade serous carcinoma of the testis and 
paratestis. Also, our findings indicate that morphological and immunophenotypic features are similar to that of ovarian high-grade 
serous carcinoma.

Background: Nested (NUC) and large nested (LNUC) subtypes of urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract (UUT) are 
exceedingly rare. This study describes the clinical and pathological features of the largest cohort to date of these rare tumors and 
sheds new light on their molecular underpinnings. 
Design: Resection specimens of LNUC and NUC of UUT were retrospectively collected from 7 institutions. Clinicopathologic data 
was obtained. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was 
performed by trimming raw sequencing reads using Trim_galore, mapping reads to human primary reference assembly (hg38) 
using bwa-mem followed by somatic variant calling using Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK4) 'maftools' R package. Microsatellite 
instability assay was performed using Idylla TM  MSI assay 
Results: 10 patients with LNUC and 7 patients with NUC were included in this study. The clinicopathologic features of these 
patients are listed in Table 1. 85.7% of NUC presented as high stage tumors (pT3 and pT4) compared to 40% of LNUC. 60% of 
LNUC had no evidence of disease on follow up compared to 14.2% of NUC. On WES a total of 26,707 genetic alterations (range: 
407- 4168) in 11,451 genes (range: 374-3031) were identified. The 10 most frequently mutated genes were MT-CYB,GOLGA6L6, 
MUC16 (16/17, 94%); and CCDC187, FCGBP, FOXD4L4,MUC12,NBPF26, OR4E1, TYW1 (15/17, 88%). Pathogenic mutations 
most commonly involved MT-CYB(16/17; 94%), followed by FGFR3 (8/17;47%) and PIK3CA (5/17; 29.4%) (Fig.1). The latter two 
were seen only in LNUC. HOXD9, FAM25C, DSCAML1, MT-CO3 & PIK3CA & CNTNAP 3 showed significant differential mutation 
among the two subtypes (Fig.2). KDM6A, STAG2, TERT and FGFR3 showed a trend, with increased mutations in LNUC. Analysis 
of differential mutational profiles based on pathologic stage (low stage vs high stage) showed statistical significance 
for USPY9, PARP4 and FGFR3 in low stage tumors. All tumors were microsatellite stable (MSS) (MSI score of 0).

Conclusions: NUC involving the UUT appears to be more aggressive than LNUC. The most frequent pathogenic mutation in both 
subtypes involve MT-CYB, which has not been previously reported. PIK3CA is significantly mutated in LNUC 
while FGFR3 mutations are more common in LNUC and is significantly associated with low stage tumors. This study expands the 
clinicopathologic spectrum and molecular profile of these tumors, highlighting genetic alterations of potential therapeutic and 
prognostic value.

Background: Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 (TRPS1) has recently been reported as a highly sensitive and specific 
immunohistochemical (IHC) marker for breast carcinomas, especially when determining the primary site of origin. Interestingly, to 
date, there is no data on TRPS1 expression in prostate cancer, which is important because a subset of breast carcinomas, 
particularly hormone receptor positive cases of the type that occur in men, can be positive for NKX3.1 and show overlapping

morphologic features. As a result, this study was performed to evaluate TRPS1 and GATA3 staining in primary and metastatic 
prostatic adenocarcinoma.   
Design: A cohort of primary and metastatic prostatic adenocarcinomas was identified at our institution and selected for TRPS1 and 
GATA3 IHC staining. TRPS1 was optimized based on previously published protocols with appropriate positive and negative 
controls, and GATA3 was performed per clinical protocol. Stains were scored utilizing a modified quick score method in the same 
manner as previously published: expression score= percent of tumor staining (0, <1%; 1, 1–10%; 2, 11–50%; 3, 51–100%) 
multiplied by the average staining intensity (0, negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong). Expression scores of 0-1, 2, 3-4, or 6-9 
were considered negative, low, intermediate, and high, respectively.   
Results: Sixty-nine cases were stained with both markers, including 35 primary tumors and 34 metastases (local and distant); 26 
cases were matched primaries and metastases. TRPS1 expression was seen in 22 cases overall (31.9%), including 10 primaries 
(28.6%) and 12 (35.3%) metastases. Intermediate or high expression was seen in 17 cases (24.6%). For the 26 matched cases, 9 
primaries and 7 metastases were positive for TRPS1. There was no statistically significant difference in primary versus metastasis 
in TRPS1 expression (p=0.13). All cases were negative for GATA3. 
Conclusions: In this study, a significant number of prostatic adenocarcinomas were positive for TRPS1 (31.9% in our cohort), 
including a quarter of cases showing intermediate or high expression. This finding is significant and suggests TRPS1 may not be as 
specific for a breast primary as the current literature states. Importantly, all cases were negative for GATA3, which underscores its 
usefulness in ruling out a prostatic primary in a scenario where TRPS1 or NKX3.1 could be positive. In summary, more work is 
needed to evaluate TRPS1 expression in a variety of primary and metastatic tumors before accurate claims of specificity and 
sensitivity can be made.

Background: Several studies have found that the presence of large cribriform pattern 4 (LCP4) correlates with worse pathological 
outcomes at radical prostatectomy (RP). We assessed if LCP4, controlled for percent of Gleason pattern 4 (GP4%) and tumor 
volume (TV), is an independent predictor of adverse pathological RP outcomes. 
Design: A single-center retrospective cohort analysis was performed. All cases were re-reviewed and only Grade Group (GG) 2 
and 3 tumors were included in the analysis. Tumor grade, GP4%, stage, TV and margin status of each tumor were measured 
individually. We assessed statistical differences between the presence or absence of LCP4 groups based on patient age, prostate 
specific antigen density (PSAD), TV, GP4%, pathologic stage (pT2, pT2+, pT3a, and pT3b), positive surgical margin (SM+), and 
lymph node metastasis (LN+). We conducted univariable analysis (UVA) and multivariable analysis (MVA) where in each tumor we 
assessed the association of the presence of LCP4 with pathological RP outcomes accounting for the effect of TV and 
GP4%. P values were obtained by Chi-square test and Student’s t-test. Statistical analysis was conducted using SAS v9.4. 
Results: Patients with LCP4 cancer (487/1108) had higher PSAD (P < 0.001), larger TV (1078.56 cm3 vs. 564.48 cm3; P < 0.001), 
and higher GP4% (70% vs. 20%; P < 0.001). In UVA, LCP4 predicted higher GG, stage (all P < 0.001), SM+ (P = 0.002), and LN+ 
(P = 0.034). In a MVA based on a multiple-effects generalized linear model, when TV and GP4% were accounted for, LCP4 lost its 
independent statistically significant impact on RP outcomes: pT2+, pT3a, pT3b, SM+, and LN+, all P > 0.05 but TV and GP4% 
retain it (Table 1).

Conclusions: LCP4, TV, and GP4% are codependent variable in GG2 and GG3 cancer. Similar to previous studies, we 
demonstrated a significant association of LCP4 with PSAD, TV, GP4%, GG, pathologic stage, SM+, and LN+ when TV and GP4% 
of corresponding TNs were not taken into consideration. After controlling for the effect of GP4% and TV on adverse pathological 
RP outcomes, LCP4 alone was no longer an independent predictor. Therefore, higher GP4% and TV of tumors in which LCP4 is 
present are likely to explain the more adverse cancer found at RP rather than the presence of LCP4 alone. Our findings are 
clinically pertinent to patients with LCP4 diagnosed on needle biopsy for their preoperative risk stratification management planning. 
 
707   Molecular Features of High Grade, Non-Sarcomatoid Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma

Background: Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma (ChRCC) is a common subtype of renal cell carcinoma which typically behaves 
indolently.  However a rare subset of ChRCC cases shows high-grade morphologic features and is more likely to 
demonstrate aggressive clinical behavior.  While the molecular features of histologically classic ChRCC have been well 
characterized, there is limited data available regarding the molecular features of histologically high-grade ChRCC.  We therefore 
assembled a cohort of high-grade ChRCC cases and investigated their molecular features using next-generation sequencing 
(NGS). 
Design: Kidney resections were collected and examined histologically for cases showing areas of classic ChRCC as well as 
morphologically distinct areas of high-grade ChRCC, which were defined by: increased cellularity, high mitotic rate, atypical mitotic 
 
  
 
S692 
figures, necrosis, and loss of typical ChRCC morphologic features.  For six cases, separate areas of low and high grade ChRCC 
were independently dissected and analyzed by NGS using a panel analyzing 800 cancer related genes. 
Results: Compared to adjacent classic ChRCC areas (Figure 1A, 2A), high grade ChRCC showed tumor necrosis (1B), vascular 
invasion within renal sinus fat (2B), increased cellularity with atypical mitotic figures (1C, 2C) and tumor cells with prominent central 
nucleoli (1D, 2D).  High grade ChRCC areas harbored additional oncogenic mutations not seen in adjacent areas of classic 
ChRCC.  Five of six high grade ChRCC cases harbored damaging TP53 alterations, four of which were not seen in the adjacent 
classic ChRCC areas.  Two high grade ChRCC cases harbored damaging PTEN alterations not seen in the adjacent classic 
ChRCC areas.  Five of the high grade ChRCC cases harbored damaging RB alterations, none of which were seen in the adjacent 
classic ChRCC areas.  Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate morphologic features of classic and high-grade ChRCC areas from two 
representative cases along with molecular alterations detected only in areas of high-grade ChRCC.  Additional studies are in 
progress to spatially map the molecular alterations using immunohistochemical surrogates for the observed mutations. 
Figure 1 - 707 
 
Figure 2 - 707 
 
Conclusions: High Grade ChRCC shows aggressive behavior and harbors molecular alterations not seen in adjacent classic 
ChRCC.  This study provides insight into the molecular pathogenesis of high grade ChRCC, implicating TP53, PTEN, and RB in the 
progression from classic to high-grade ChRCC.   
 
708   Morphologic and Molecular Features of Mismatch Repair Deficient (MMR-d) Prostate Cancer: 
Insights from a Series of Radical Prostatectomies

Disclosures: Ezra Baraban: None; Eric Erak: None; Tamara Lotan: None 
Background: Although uncommon in primary prostate cancer, mismatch repair protein deficiency (MMR-d) is enriched in Grade 
Group 4-5 tumors and has clinical implications, raising consideration for genetic counseling as well as eligibility for 
immunotherapy.  Thus far limited data regarding MMR-d prostate cancer is available based on a small number of described 
cases.  We assembled a large cohort of MMR-d primary prostate cancers to investigate their clinical, morphologic, 
immunohistochemical, and genetic features. 
Design: MMR-d prostate cancers were identified by IHC or germline/somatic sequencing.  For 20 radical prostatectomies, the 
following parameters were evaluated: Grade Group (GG), stage, intraductal carcinoma, intratumoral stromal tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TIL) (assessed visually according to International TILS Working Group guidelines on a representative tumor block 
with maximal inflammation), intratumoral germinal centers.   
Results: MMR-d prostate cancers (Table 1) were frequently of high grade and stage (85% GG5, 90% ≥pT3), and often harbored 
intraductal carcinoma (65%).  Large cribriform glands were common (80%), with the diameter of the largest cribriform glands 
exceeding 1 mm in 60% of cases.  Tumors frequently harbored striking inflammatory infiltrates, with an average stromal tumor 
infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) content of 30%, and germinal centers noted in 40% of cases.  Distinctive morphologies were noted in a 
subset of cases, including foci reminiscent of lymphoepithelial-like carcinoma (LELC) seen in other organs (30%) as well as 
Crohn's-like lymphoid aggregates noted in MMR-d colorectal cancer (55%).  The distribution of MMR protein loss by IHC was: 
90% MSH2/6, 5% MSH6, 5% MLH1/PMS2, 0% PMS2.  Germline testing was performed in 65% of cases and 38% of these had 
confirmed pathogenic germline mutations. 75% of cases had available somatic sequencing and all had confirmed pathogenic MMR 
gene alterations.  The average tumor mutational burden (TMB) was 31/Mb (range: 3-104), but only 43% of cases had microsatellite 
instability (MSI) by sequencing. 
 
  
 
S693 
Figure 1 - 708 
 
Figure 2 - 708 
 
Conclusions: Several morphologic features (cribriform glands >1mm, germinal centers, lymphoepithelial-like foci) may suggest 
MMR-d, but these are insensitive and systematic IHC screening for GG4-5 cancers is warranted.  Cases with MMR-d by IHC and 
somatic mutations may lack MSI as assessed by sequencing and have variable TMB.  Further studies to characterize the tumor 
microenvironment in this series of MMR-d prostate cancers are ongoing.

Background: Somatic or germline Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) gene mutations are seen in up to 20% of 
prostate carcinomas and are predictive of response to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. In this study we 
hypothesize that histological patterns of prostate carcinoma are predictive of HRD gene mutations. 
 
  
 
S694 
Design: 130 cases of prostate carcinoma with somatic or germline mutations (38 with BRCA1/2, 36 with non-BRCA1/2 HRD gene 
mutations) and 56 cases negative for HRD gene mutations 
(ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CHEK2, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, RAD51C,?RAD51D, EMSY, PTEN, ATR, CHEK1, FAM175A) were 
included. Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed at a CLIA-certified laboratory. Cases were evaluated for presence or 
absence of histological patterns of prostate carcinoma and quantified by 4 genitourinary pathologists. Discordances were resolved 
by consensus review. Presence of prostate carcinoma histological patterns were analyzed for any correlation with mutations in 
HRD genes, BRCA1/2 or non-BRCA1/2 HRD genes compared to the negative control group using Chi-square test. Patterns at 
greater than 20 and 30% of tumor volume were additionally evaluated for any correlation. 
Results: Cribriform pattern, intraductal carcinoma (IDC), ductal carcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, signet ring-like pattern and 
lobular carcinoma-like patterns were not predictive of BRCA1/2, non-BRCA1/2 HRD gene or HRD gene mutations (Table-1). 
Analyzing for tumors with greater than 20 or 30% patterns also did not show any correlation. Neuroendocrine carcinoma showed a 
marginal increase in cases with BRCA1/2 mutations compared to the negative group (p=0.07), although the number of 
neuroendocrine carcinomas in the entire cohort was small (n=6). The non-BRCA1/2 HRD group showed a marginally greater 
increase in volume of cribriform pattern (greater than 30%) compared to the negative group.

Conclusions: In this study histological patterns were not predictive of HRD gene mutations. A marginal increase of 
neuroendocrine morphology and high-volume cribriform patterns were seen in BRCA1/2 and non-BRCA1/2 HRD mutated prostate 
carcinomas respectively. This data suggests that histopathologic examination alone is insufficient to distinguish BRCA1/2 and HRD 
gene mutated prostate cancers, further highlighting the importance of ancillary molecular diagnostics in therapy selection for those 
who may benefit from PARP inhibitors.

Background: Nested urothelial carcinoma (NUC) is a rare but aggressive subtype of bladder cancer despite its deceptively bland 
histopathologic features. Therefore, identifying pathogenic and potentially targetable genomic alterations could inform novel 
treatment approaches. Herein, we analyzed clinical and genomic data and expression of basal and luminal immunohistochemical 
(IHC) markers in a cohort of NUC. 
Design: Targeted next generation sequencing was performed on 51 NUC tumors and 26 high-grade urothelial carcinomas with 
nested features (HGUC-N). In addition, IHC for luminal (FOXA1, GATA3, PPARG) and basal (CK5/6, CK14) markers was 
performed on 34 NUC and 23 HGUC-N tumors, assembled in a tissue microarray. Clinical and molecular data were compared 
between the NUC and HGUC-N tumors and a prospectively annotated cohort of 600 clinically localized urothelial carcinomas, not 
otherwise specified (UC-NOS). 
Results: In NUC cohort, there was 19 male and 15 female patients. The age ranged from 55 to 87 (69.7). With a median following-
up of 4.3 years, classic NUC was significantly associated with higher risk of cancer death compared to UC NOS (HR 2.06, 
p=0.004). Tumor mutational burden was lower in NUC tumors compared to HGUC-N and UC NOS (p<0.001). Evaluation of 136 
 
  
 
S695 
altered cancer-associated genes detected differences in the frequency of commonly mutated genes among the 3 cohorts (Table 1). 
Mutations in TP53, FGFR3, ARID1A and KDM6A were less frequent in NUC than in UC-NOS. A subset of NUC was enriched with 
recurrent RhoA mutations and FOXA1 amplification. All NUC cases expressed luminal markers including GATA3, FOXA1 and 
PPARG (range from 94.2% to 100%). NUC also expressed the basal markers CK5/6 and CK14 in 30 (88%) and 7 (21%) of cases, 
respectively.  Although the mean H-score of CK5/6 expression was higher in NUC compared to HGUC-N (152>123), this difference 
not significant (p=0.15). PAX8 was expressed in 8 (24%) NUC compared to 5 (21.7%) HGUC-N.

Conclusions: Despite its bland histomorphology, the NUC subtype of bladder cancer is associated with worse outcome than UC 
NOS. Despite the overlapping genomic landscape of NUC and UC-NOS, NUC is enriched for recurrent RhoA mutations 
and FOXA1 amplification, with less frequent mutations in TP53, the TERT promoter, KDM6A and ARID1A. HGUC with nested 
features is molecularly more comparable to UC NOS than to NUC. A subset of NUC tumors express both luminal and basal 
markers, the significance of which will require further study. 
 
711   Clinicopathologic Differences in Unilateral Versus Bilateral Seminal Vesicle Invasion of 
Prostate Cancer in Radical Prostatectomies

Disclosures: Yekaterina Belogrivtseva: None; Mohamad Mazen Gafeer: None; Aileen Grace Arriola: None 
Background: Reporting seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) following radical prostatectomy (RP) has historically been associated with a 
poor prognosis. The extent of SVI has also been included in some previous studies, but results regarding its influence on prognosis 
were contradictory. Our aim is to provide more data on whether bilateral SVI is associated with worse oncological outcomes by 
analyzing a large RP cohort from our institution, potentially helping to further define the prostate cancer protocol for future 
prognostic applications. 
Design: We reviewed clinicopathological data of men who underwent RP during the period from 1/1/12-06/28/19. The following 
data were collected from pathology reports and patient charts: age, race, grade group, margin status, lymph node (LN) status, type 
of LN dissection, extraprostatic extension (EPE), SVI, bladder neck involvement, tumor volume, and follow-up such as recurrence 
and progression of the disease. Differences between categorical values were assessed by chi-square/Fisher exact test and 
continuous values by student T-test. 
Results: 769 RP cases were identified. Among them, 114/769 (14.8%) had SVI, out of which 56 (7.2%) had bilateral and 54 (7%) 
had unilateral SVI. Table 1 shows the clinical and pathological characteristics of the series stratified by unilateral and bilateral SVI. 
Our study shows that bilateral SVI was present more frequently in patients with higher tumor volumes (p-value=0.0006), positive 
margins (p-value=0.0064), EPE other than SVI (p-value=<0.0001), and LN affection (p-value=0.0013). These features are 
considered adverse pathological factors and represent more aggressive tumors. In our study, there was a shorter time interval for 
the development of biochemical recurrence (BCR) with higher PSA values in the bilateral SVI group compared to unilateral SVI, 
although did not reach statistical significance. There was also no difference in the progression of disease between the two 
groups.  Limitations of the present study include its retrospective nature and the fact that it was a single-center study.

Although not statistically significant, our study showed a shorter interval to BCR and a higher PSA value at BCR for bilateral SVI. 
Further studies with a larger sample size would be worthwhile to pursue in order to understand the clinical implications of 
pathologic reporting of bilateral versus unilateral SVI.

712   Fumarate Hydratase Deficient Renal Cell Carcinoma Involving the Peritoneum with a 
Pseudomesotheliomatous Pattern: A Diagnostic Pitfall

Matteo Brunelli: None; Guido Martignoni: None 
Background: Fumarate Hydratase (FH) deficient renal cell carcinoma is a rare neoplasm characterized by mutations in the FH 
gene, often associated with cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas. Neoplastic cells may be arranged in a great variety of architectural 
patterns, including papillary, solid, and tubulocystic. These tumors often show an aggressive behavior with rapid metastatic spread 
to many distant organs, like the liver, the lungs, the bones, and the peritoneum. Involvement of this latter one is not such an 
infrequent finding and could cause difficulties in differentiating between primary mesothelial reactive or neoplastic diseases and 
metastatic localizations. This is of particular concern when peritoneum involvement firstly shows up. 
Design: Among a series of eleven FH deficient renal cell carcinomas, eight of them with aggressive behaviour, we retrieved three 
tumors with peritoneal metastasis resembling mesothelial proliferations. In one case the peritoneal involvement was the first finding 
of the disease and in two cases previous diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma was on record. 
Results: One patient was female, two were males. Peritoneal involvement was represented by papillary to microcystic proliferation 
made up of cells characterized by eosinophilic cytoplasm, roundish nuclei and prominent nucleoli, initially suspicious for a benign 
reactive mesothelial process or a primary peritoneal mesothelioma. The neoplastic cells were positive for CK8-18 and CKAE1/AE3 
but did not expressed mesothelial markers (podoplanin, calretinin, and WT1). Nuclear staining for PAX8 suggested to consider the 
possibility of a localization from a renal cell tumor. Loss of immunohistochemical expression of FH leaded to the diagnosis of 
metastatic FH deficient renal cell carcinoma. The revision of the primary renal tumors confirmed this histotype. 
Conclusions: FH deficient renal cell carcinomas are aggressive neoplasms with early metastatic spread. In our series of 
aggressive FH deficient renal cell carcinoma, a significant percentage of the cases (3/8, 37%) displayed the peritoneum 
involvement mimicking a mesothelial disease due to either cytological or architectural features. Therefore, in patients with renal 
mass and peritoneal involvement with controversial histopathological features, an immunohistochemical panel should include PAX8 
and FH in order to avoid misdiagnoses of such a morphological pitfall.

Background: Papillary renal neoplasm with reverse polarity (PRNRP) is a renal entity with distinct oncocytic morphology, 
immunoprofile and frequent KRAS mutations (Raspollini, 2022). Although it is considered a subset of papillary renal cell carcinoma 
(PRCC), it has a very indolent clinical course (Al-Obaidy, 2019). Thus, the distinction of this renal tumor from other 
oncocytic/eosinophilic PRCCs (ePRCC) has important prognostic implications. ABCC2 is an active transporter protein that localizes 
to the apical cell membranes. It is overexpressed in more aggressive PRCCs on transcriptomic and proteomic levels and it shows 
prognostic utility in PRCC (Saleeb, 2022). In this study, we compare the PRNRP and ePRCC clinicopathological parameters and 
the ABCC2 expression.  
Design: PRNPR (n=8) and ePRCC (n=21) cases were selected from resection specimens and corresponding clinicopathological 
data were collected. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for ABCC2 and GATA3 was performed. ABCC2 staining patterns were 
classified as negative, cytoplasmic, and cell “brush border". RNA in-situ hybridization (ISH) was used to assess ABCC2 transcript 
levels in-situ. A semi-quantitative scoring system (0-4) was adapted to assess the RNA ISH. Statistical analysis for T test, Fisher’s 
exact, Chi-square and log-rank were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 software. 
Results: All 8 PRNRPs had diffuse, moderate to strong IHC staining for GATA3 and very weak cytoplasmic staining for ABCC2. 
PRNRP had no detectable ABCC2 transcripts on RNA ISH (score 0). In contrast, none of the ePRCCs had GATA3 expression, 
while 16/21 (76%) showed ABCC2 IHC brush border expression. ePRCCs also had a significantly higher transcript level of ABCC2 
by RNA ISH (p=0.001). All PRNRPs had low grade (WHO/ISUP 1-2) and low-stage disease (pT1a). ePRCCs were also 
characterized by significantly larger tumor size (p=0.0039), higher WHO/ISUP grade (p<0.0001), and higher stage (p=0.0374) 
(Table 1). None of the PRNRP cases showed disease progression, while 2 ePRCCs (~10%) had disease progression.

Conclusions: PRNRP is clinically and biologically distinct from ePRCC. ePRCCs show a significantly more aggressive tumour 
behaviour and have higher proteomic and transcriptomic ABCC2 expression highlighted by the IHC BB pattern and the RNA ISH 
analysis respectively. Hence, it is crucial to differentiate between these two entities with careful morphological and 
immunohistochemical analysis.

Background: Increasing number of kidney tumors are now molecularly defined, though next generation sequencing (NGS) testing 
is not routinely used in clinical practice, largely due to limited availability, cost and uncertain utility. In this study we present our 
institutional experience with NGS testing on renal mass biopsies in an academic center subspecialty clinical setting. 
 
  
 
S699 
Design: Our pathology clinical database was searched for renal mass biopsies (2017-2022) in which our institution's NGS assay 
was ordered. The NGS assay uses capture-based NGS sequencing to target and analyze the coding regions of 479-520 cancer 
genes and select introns of 41-47 genes (dependent on iteration if test used). Clinical and pathologic information was extracted 
from the electronic medical record. The test was recorded as clarifying the diagnosis if a specific mutation, translocation or copy 
number profile previously reported for a known histologic subtype of renal tumor was identified without any other confounding 
molecular features. 
Results: We identified 52/300 (17%) renal biopsies in which sequencing was ordered. 11 cases were ordered by the treating 
physician: 4 oncocytic renal neoplasms, 4 urothelial carcinomas, 2 clear cell renal cell carcinomas and one leukemia/lymphoma. 41 
cases were ordered by the pathologist and divided into the following categories: oncocytic (12), with clear cytoplasm (9), papillary 
(5), spindled (6), unclassified (7) and pediatric (2). Indication for sequencing by the pathologist ranged from confirmation of 
expected diagnosis (due to an unusual morphology, immuohistochemical result, or clinical presentation) to complete diagnostic 
uncertainty.  Of these 41 pathologist ordered cases plus the 4 oncocytic renal neoplasm ordered by the treating physician, the 
molecular findings clarified the diagnosis in 28 (62%): oncocytic 7/16 (44%), with clear cytoplasm 7/9 (78%), papillary 3/5 (60%), 
spindled 4/6 (67%), unclassified 5/7 (71%), and pediatric 2/2 (100%).  Detailed molecular findings Fig 1.  In 3 cases, sequencing 
was not performed due to tumor quantity not sufficient; in these cases, an extensive immunohistochemical workup had been 
performed, largely exhausting the specimen. 
Figure 1 - 714 
 
Conclusions: Molecular testing on renal biopsies was helpful to provide a more definitive diagnosis in the majority of our 
pathologist ordered cases, across multiple morphologic settings. Dividing renal biopsies into two cassettes can help preserve 
adequate tissue for molecular testing.

Background: Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is an uncommon condition that can affect genitourinary sites. In our 
experience, we have noted variable nuclear positivity with the prostatic marker NKX3.1 in some cases of EMPD, a potential 
 
  
 
S700 
diagnostic pitfall for prostate cancer.  A recent study on 20 cases of EMPD by Shabihkhani et al 2020 showed 1 case with positive 
PSA, but positive NKX3.1 in EMPD has not been reported. In this study, we sought to characterize the incidence of NKX3.1 
staining in EMPD of genitourinary sites. 
Design: A retrospective multi-center study was conducted. We obtained cases of EMPD involving genitourinary sites from our 
pathology databases and collaborators (2000-2020). H&E slides were reviewed, and IHC was performed and evaluated on 
available material (CK7, CK20, NKX3.1, AR, GATA3, and PSA). Demographics information and cancer history were obtained from 
the electronic medical record. 
Results: We identified 19 cases of EMPD involving genitourinary sites (scrotum, penis, groin, suprapubic region, and inguinal 
crease) from male patients. The mean age at diagnosis was 72 years old.  IHC showed: CK7 positive in 19/19, CK20 negative in 
16/18, GATA3 positive in 18/18, androgen receptor (AR) positive in 16/18, PSA negative in 18/18, and NKX3.1 showed variable 
nuclear positivity in 4/19. One of the 4 cases with positive NKX3.1 had a reported history of prostate cancer with metastatic tumor 
to pelvic lymph nodes that were initially called metastatic prostatic cancer, but subsequently revised to metastatic EMPD following 
evaluation of their groin lesion and expert consultation. We also evaluated 3 cases of EMPD involving female vulvar sites. Mean 
age was 72 years old. NKX3.1 was positive in 1/3, CK7 was positive in 3/3, CK20 was negative in 2/3, and AR and PSA were 
negative in 3/3. 
Figure 1 - 715 
 
Conclusions: EMPD commonly shows diffuse AR+ IHC and occasional NKX3.1+ IHC, potentially leading to concern for metastatic 
cutaneous prostate cancer, especially in male patients with a history of prostate cancer in which EMPD may not be 
considered.  However, a solid growth pattern and characteristic IHC pattern of CK7+, CK20-, and GATA3+ can be helpful in 
avoiding this diagnostic pitfall.

Background: Metanephric adenoma (MA), which arises from the undifferentiated metanephric mesenchyme, is a rare benign 
neoplasm that generally localizes to the renal cortex and comprises 0.2% of all adult renal neoplasms. It has overlapping 
morphological features with epithelial predominant Wilm’s tumor (WT) and papillary renal cell carcinoma type (PRCC), which can 
cause diagnostic dilemmas. Current clinical practice includes immunohistochemical (IHC) based combination markers for MA which 
is generally CK7-, AMACR-, BRAF V600E+, WT1+, and CD57+. However, these biomarkers cannot accurately differentiate MA 
from its histopathological mimickers. Hence, we set our goal to identify MA-specific markers that can reinforce the current clinical 
IHC panel and validate them using an independent methodology. 
Design: With the goal described above, we interrogated in-house and publicly available major and rare renal tumor subtypes’ 
RNAseq data and nominated Trinucleotide Repeat Containing Gene 6C Protein (TNRC6C), Superoxide Dismutase 3 (SOD3), and 
Nitric Oxide Synthase 1 (NOS1) as three differentially expressed genes between MA and the remaining RCC subtypes including 
 
  
 
S701 
WT. We assembled a focused cohort containing 6 MA, 8 WT, and 8 PRCC cases for validation studies. We utilized a chromogenic 
RNA in-situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) assay on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections for validating the nominated 
biomarkers. For RNA-ISH-based biomarker assessment, individual chromogenic mRNA transcripts were recorded in the neoplastic 
cells and final H-scores (out of 400) were calculated. 
Results: TNRC6C expression was noted in all samples for both MA (6/6; 100%) and WT (8/8; 100%) and detected in a subset of 
PRCC (3/8; 37.5%) cases. SOD3 was expressed in all (6/6; 100%) MA but also detected in 3/8 (37.5%) cases for both PRCC and 
WT. In contrast, NOS1 expression was seen to be positive in all (6/6; 100%) MA samples and negative in all PRCC (0/8; 0%) and 
WT (0/8; 0%) samples. The expression of NOS1 was variable with H-scores ranging from 90-252. 
Figure 1 - 716 
 
Conclusions: All nominated markers had positive expression in MA cases, however, TNRC6C and SOD3 showed positive 
expression in a subset of WT and PRCC in the study cohort. On the other hand, robust NOS1 expression was detected exclusively 
in MA and not in either WT or PRCC cases included in our validation cohort. Our analysis suggests that of the three nominated 
markers, NOS1 staining can reliably distinguish between MA and WT or PRCC.

Background: Urothelial carcinoma (UC) displays a wide spectrum of morphologic subtypes that often co-exist within individual 
tumors resulting in a heterogeneous histomorphologic appearance. Although up to 40% of bladder cancers exhibit divergent 
differentiation and/or histopathologic subtypes, little is known about the differences in oncogenic drivers and clinical outcomes 
across these distinct entities. 
Design: Molecular profiling by a next generation sequencing assay was performed on 1,188 primary bladder tumors, including 
invasive UC NOS (n=439), UC with squamous (n=96) and glandular and differentiation (n=37), micropapillary (n=73), high grade 
neuroendocrine (n=62), plasmacytoid (n=62), nested (n=38) and sarcomatoid (n=28) subtypes, and primary bladder 
adenocarcinoma (n=23). Also included was non-invasive (NI) low grade papillary UC (n= 89), NI high grade papillary UC (n=164) 
and urothelial carcinoma in situ (n=77).  Associations between genetic alterations and morphologic features were assessed. 
Results: The results are depicted in Figure 1. FGFR3 mutations were enriched in non-invasive papillary UC (52% HG, 78% LG), 
and were less frequent in invasive UC NOS (15%), squamous (19%) and nested (15%) tumors. ERBB2 mutations/amplification 
were identified in all histologic subtypes in a mutually exclusive pattern with FGFR3 mutations/fusions with the highest prevalence 
noted in micropapillary (37%), glandular (19%) and UC NOS (19%) tumors. Plasmacytoid carcinoma was associated 
with CDH1 mutations and small cell/neuroendocrine carcinoma was notable for frequent TP53, RB1 and TERT promoter mutations. 
Patterns of gene mutations in adenocarcinoma were most distinct from other subtypes, with frequent mutations in KRAS and 
infrequent TERT promoter and chromatin modifying gene mutations. 
 
  
 
S702 
Figure 1 - 717 
 
Conclusions: This analysis highlights the genomic diversity and phenotypic plasticity of urothelial carcinoma and its 
subtypes. CDH1 alterations are associated with plasmacytoid carcinoma and ERBB2 alterations are enriched in micropapillary 
carcinoma. Targetable alterations in FGFR3 and ERBB2 are present across UC and its histologic subtypes and may be an 
attractive therapeutic approach in these settings. Genomic profiles of primary bladder adenocarcinoma are most distinct from other 
UC subtypes and suggests a distinct pathogenesis.

Background: Extraprostatic extension (EPE) of prostate cancer (PCa) on transrectal (TR) needle core biopsy (Bx) is a rare 
histopathological finding which will help clinical decision-making. The detection efficiency through transperineal (TP) approach has 
yet been explored. 
Design: We retrospectively reviewed 2622 PCa cases having concomitant systemic template biopsy (SBx) and multiparametric 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-ultrasound fusion-targeted biopsy (TBx) using TR (n = 1877) or TP (n = 745) approach in our 
institution between 01/2015 and 03/2022. We assessed and compared biopsy detection of EPE, defined as the presence of cancer 
cells within or immediately adjacent to periprostatic adipose tissue (Fig. A&B), by approaches (TP and TR) and methods (SBx and 
TBx). 
Results: Thirty-six cases with EPE were identified (36/2622, 1.4%). TP showed a significantly higher EPE detection rate than TR in 
the combined methods (2.1% vs 1.1%, p = 0.032), SBx (1.6% vs 0.7%, p = 0.044) or TBx (1.2% vs 0.5%, p = 0.042). SBx showed 
a higher EPE detection rate than TBx with no statistical significance. More EPEs were found at non-base sites of TP than TR (84% 
vs 50%, p = 0.028).

Background: BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is mutated in a subset of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) and is known 
to confer aggressive clinical behavior. The histologic features of tumors with previously known BAP1 mutations has been reported 
and BAP1 immunohistochemistry has shown effectiveness in identifying BAP1-mutated tumors. However, the clinicopathologic 
comparison of tumors with and without nuclear BAP1 loss has not been evaluated.   
 
  
 
S704 
Design: Nuclear BAP1 expression was assessed in 295 unselected CCRCCs from nephrectomy specimens at three institutions. 
We evaluated the clinicopathologic features of tumors with and without BAP1 loss as a surrogate for BAP1 mutations.  Data were 
an analyzed using Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test. 
Results: A total of 61 of 295 (21%) of CCRCC showed nuclear BAP1 loss. In comparison to BAP1-retained tumors, tumors with 
BAP1 loss were larger in size (7.0 vs 5.0 cm, p<0.01), showed more necrosis (11% vs 4%, p=0.02), had more frequently positive 
margins (17% vs 5%, p<0.01), and had higher pathologic stage (63% vs 14% pT3a or above, p<0.01). In particular, tumors with 
BAP loss showed frequent sinus adipose invasion (49% vs 17%, p<0.01) and renal vein invasion (40% vs 23%, p=0.01). Previously 
reported histologic features of BAP1-mutated CCRCC were also more common including high nuclear grade (100% vs 24% G3/G4, 
p<0.01), rhabdoid/sarcomatoid differentiation (37% vs 5%, p=0.01), the degree of cytoplasmic eosinophilia (2.03 vs 0.78 on scale 
of 0-3+, p<0.01), voluminous cytoplasm (50% vs 18%, p<0.01), cytoplasmic granules (52% vs 22%, p<0.01, and cytoplasmic 
globules (38% vs 3%, p<0.01). 
Figure 1 - 719 
 
Figure 2 - 719 
 
Conclusions: BAP1 loss was observed at a higher rate in our CCRCC cohort than has previously been reported. These tumors 
showed a higher pathologic stage including high rates of renal vein and sinus adipose invasion.  The spectrum of histologic findings 
in tumors with BAP1 loss was wider than previously reported, but these do demonstrate characteristic yet non-specific high grade 
histologic features which could allow for prediction of BAP1 mutation during case review.

Background: Bladder cancer is a useful model for the whole-organ studies as its simple anatomy permits mapping of 
microscopically identifiable in situ preneoplastic conditions and adjacent field effects in the entire organ. We used whole-organ 
histologic mapping combined with exome mutational and mass spectrometry-based protein profiling to model the evolution of 
bladder cancer from mucosal field effects. 
Design: We performed a proof of principle analysis of whole-exome mutational landscape and mass spectrometry proteomic 
profiling on the whole-organ scale of a single cystectomy specimen with invasive bladder cancer. The 38 samples were 
microscopically classified into normal urothelium, low grade intraurothelial neoplasia, high-grade intraurothelial neoplasia, and 
invasive cancer. Exome sequencing with an average depth of approximately 300X was performed on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 
sequencer and protein sequencing was performed with Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
Results: We identified 12,764 nonsynonymous mutations and 8,475 proteins. Analysis of mutational patterns identified three types 
of mutations based on their geographic distribution and variant allele frequencies. The most common were mutations restricted to 
individual mucosal samples referred to as α mutations. The two additional types of mutations were associated with clonal 
expansion. The mutations referred to as β occurred at low frequencies and Δ mutations increased in frequency with progression. 
The analysis of proteomic profiles identified dysregulations of multiple pathways including neutrophil regulation, Hippo, cAMP, 
Hedgehog, and IL-17 signaling complemented by dysregulation of cellular adhesion, antigen processing, autophagy, and PD-1/PD-
L1 checkpoint. Modeling of bladder cancer evolution revealed that it develops through multiple mutational waves spanning 
 
  
 
S705 
approximately 10-15 years, which can be divided into dormant and progressive phases. The progressive phase lasted 
approximately two years and was driven by Δ mutations. 
Conclusions: This is the first proof of principle report of detailed combined mutational and proteomic characterization of mucosal 
field effects initiating bladder carcinogenesis on the whole-organ scale. It provides unique insights into bladder cancer initiation and 
will pave the way for future studies of early events in human carcinogenesis using bladder cancer as a model.

Background: Predictive biomarkers such as PDL1 expression and mismatch repair (MMR) status are advocated for 
immunotherapy in advanced urothelial cancer. The reported frequencies of microsatellite instability (MSI) in bladder carcinoma 
(MIBC) range between 1 to 3%, while for upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), it is 3% to 46%. 
Design: This was an ambispective study of 60 cases including UTUC (n=30) and muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC, 
n=30). MSI was detected using fluorescent PCR-based assay by comparing allelic profiles of microsatellite markers generated by 
amplification of DNA from matching normal and test samples ,using the MSI Analysis System, Version 1.2 from Promega. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for four MMR proteins (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2) was also done. CK5/6 and GATA3 IHC were 
performed for molecular subtyping and PDL1 expression was evaluated in molecular subtypes. Findings were correlated with 
clinical parameters and outcomes. 
Results: Distal ureter (50%) was the most common site for UTUC. The most common molecular subtype was basal (60%) for 
MIBC and luminal (60%) for UTUC. MSI was seen in 20% (5/30) cases of UTUC, while in only 6.6% (2/30) cases of MIBC. Three of 
the six MSI cases of UTUC showed basal/squamous subtype, two were luminal (urothelial-like) subtype, while one was of double 
negative subtype. In UTUC, three out of six MSI cases (50%) showed PD-L1 positivity in tumor cells, while four cases (75%) 
showed PD-L1 immunoexpression in immune cells. Out of the two MSI cases of MIBC, one was of luminal subtype (urothelial-like), 
while other was basal/squamous subtype. One out of the two MSI cases of MIBC was positive for PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, 
while both MSI cases showed PD-L1 positivity in immune cells. PD-L1 positivity rates in tumor cells (TPS≥1%) in MIBC cohort was 
46%, while it was 50% in UTUC cohort, being 83.3% in MIBC basal subtype cases (p=0.003) and 77.8% in UTUC basal subtype 
cases. PD-L1 positivity in immune cells (ICS≥5%) was seen in 36.6% cases in both cohorts. Overall survival was least in basal 
subtype and worse in MSI tumors. Tumors expressing PD-L1 expression in tumor or immune cells had better survival.

Conclusions: MSI is more prevalent in UTUC than MIBC and PD-L1 is differentially expressed in molecular subtypes at both sites. 
Our results indicate that upper and lower tract urothelial cancers have different molecular landscape and can be differentially 
stratified for prognostic and optimal therapeutic benefits of immune checkpoint therapy.

Background: Lymph-nodal metastasis is one of the most important factors in determining the outcome of penile squamous cell 
carcinoma (PC). Many patients with PC may present with inguinal lymph node enlargement which may be either reactive or due to 
metastases. But the rate of complication following radical inguinal lymphadenectomy can be quite high. Therefore, it is necessary to 
identify the factors on histopathology that indicate better risk stratification. Hence, we attempt to study the association of pattern of 
invasion (POI) and depth of invasion (DOI) in predicting the likelihood of positive inguinal nodal metastases.   
Design: This was a retrospective observational study. 90 patients with PC who underwent inguinal lymph node dissection during 
the period January 2020 to April 2022 were included. The POI was classified as pushing or infiltrative. When both the patterns were 
noted in the same sample, it was classified as infiltrative pattern. The DOI was measured in mm from epidermal-dermal junction to 
deepest point of invasion and was classified as superficial (≤ 5 mm) or deep (> 5 mm). Statistical analysis was done in SPSS 
version 20. Categorical data was analyzed by Chi-square test along with Fisher’s exact test. Odds ratio was calculated where 
required. Prediction model was done by binary regression. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
Results: The age ranged from 24 to 90 (median 56) years. Majority of the patients were aged between 51-60 years. Lymph node 
metastasis was identified in 40%. Infiltrative pattern was observed in 52.22% and pushing pattern in 47.78%. Infiltrative POI was 
identified in 36/48 (75%) of nodal metastases and pushing POI was not identified in any of the nodal metastases. Infiltrative POI 
showed association with nodal positivity which was statistically significant in different tumor stages (T1b, T2 and T3; p value= 
0.005, <0.001, 0.006 respectively) and higher in combined (T3+T4) group (p value= 0.005). In T1b and T2 stages, both the positive 
(PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of POI were 100% and 77.8%, respectively with accuracy of 86.7%. A significant odds 
ratio showed that the infiltrative POI had 3.777 times chances of being node positive than the pushing POI. DOI > 5mm was seen 
in 66 (73.3%) and ≤ 5mm in 24 (26.7%). Among 66, lymph nodal metastasis was noted in 46.97%. There was a significant 
association of DOI with lymph node metastasis (p value= 0.025). Regression analysis model of POI was not significant for nodal 
involvement (p >0.05), however, 75% of PC with nodal involvement could be attributed to POI.

Conclusions: A significant association of POI and DOI with increased lymph node metastasis is noted. In early stages, POI 
showed high PPV and NPV with good accuracy for predicting nodal invasion. We, hence, recommend the reporting of POI along 
with DOI on a routine basis in PC.

Background: PC is considered a rare malignancy in the West. The rates in Indian subcontinent is high, up to 3.32 per 105 men. 
Due to the social stigma, patients present at advanced stage with limited treatment options and poor outcomes. Immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICI) like anti PD-L1 are currently used in treatment of other tumours especially in colorectal cancer where it is well 
established. The strong immunogenicity and the widespread expression of immune-checkpoint ligands make MSI subtype more 
vulnerable to immunotherapy. Very few studies have been done related to PD-L1 and MSI expression in PC. This study attempts to 
evaluate the expression of PD-L1 in tumour cells (TCs) and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) along with the analysis of 
MSI/MMR status in PC.  
Design: A retrospective observational study was done on 50 cases of PC from January 2020 to April 2022. The IHC was 
performed with anti-PD-L1 antibody (clone SP263 Ventana) to access PD-L1 expression and anti-MLH1 (clone M1), anti-PMS2 
(clone A16-4), anti-MSH2 (clone G219-1129) and anti-MSH6 (clone SP93) antibodies to access MMR expression on tissue 
microarray. Both IHCs were performed on Ventana Benchmark ULTRA platform. The membranous expression of PD-L1 was 
evaluated with combined positive score (CPS) in TC and TILs. Values <1% was considered negative; ≥1% was 
considered positive, further divided into 2 subgroups: 1-50%: low positivity and >50%: high positivity. The nuclear staining of MMR 
was considered positive. It was divided into 3 subgroups: 1) pMMR cases with all four positive MMR staining; 2) lo-pa MMR cases 
with either loss of/ patchy positivity expression for one of the MMRs; 3) dMMR cases with loss of one of two heterodimers. 
Statistical analysis was done in SPSS version 20. Categorical data was analysed by Chi-square test along with Fisher’s exact test. 
A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
Results: 42/50 cases (84%) showed positive PD-L1 expression. 30/42 cases showed low positive followed by 12/42 showing high 
PD-L1 expression. 8 cases showed <1% PD-L1 expression. There was significant association of PD-L1 with grading (p value= 
0.042), lymph node metastasis (p value= 0.015), lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (p value= 0.015) and nodal stage (p value=0.007). 
The PD-L1 expression didn't correlate with tumour stage and perineural invasion (PNI) with p value >0.05. 42/50 cases (84%) 
showed pMMR, 7 cases (14%) showed lo-pa MMR and only 1 case (2%) showed loss of MMR expression/ dMMR. There was no 
significant association of expression of MMR with grading, tumour staging, nodal staging, LVI and PNI (p >0.05). However, only 2% 
with dMMR showed high PD-L1 expression.

Background: Plasmacytoid (PLC) variant histology of urothelial bladder cancer (UCB) exhibits unique histological features. 
Genomic characterization has revealed CDH1 mutation as a potential defining molecular event in PLC differentiation. Phenotypic 
characteristics of CDH1 mutated UCB without PLC histology has not yet been elucidated. Herein we describe the genomic 
alteration landscape of CDH1 mutated UCB in the setting of differing histological expression. 
Design: 7,903 clinically advanced UBC underwent hybrid capture based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) to evaluate all 
classes of genomic alterations (GA). Selected cases featured CDH1 short variant mutation. H&E stained digital pathology images 
were subjected to review by a single expert genitourinary pathologist. Minimum of 10% PLC histology on digital images was 
required for categorization into PLC cohort (PLC vs non-PLC). Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was determined on up to 1.1 Mb of 
sequenced DNA and microsatellite instability (MSI) was determined on 114 loci. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression was determined by 
IHC (Dako 22C3) and defined as tumor proportion score (TPS) >1. Chi-Square test was used to compare differences between 
cohorts. 
Results: 7,641 samples were CDH1 wild-type while 158 patients were CDH1 mutated with pathology available for central review. 
Of these samples, 103 (65.2%) had a minimum of 10% PLC histology.  The PLC cohort was slightly younger than the non-
PLC group. The non-PLC population featured a higher preponderance of MSI-High status (5.7% vs 1.9%, p=0.21). Cell-Cycle 
regulatory GA were significantly higher in the non-PLC cohort, specifically CDKN2A (25.5% vs 9.7%, p=0.01) and CDKN2B (23.6% 
vs 5.8%, p<0.01) homozygous deletions. FGFR3 GA was similar between the CDH1 wild-type UCB and non-PLC (ranging from 
16.4%-18.7%) groups; however, significantly higher than the 4.9% FGFR3 GA frequency seen in the PLC cases 
(p=0.02). ERBB2 were similar in “total GA” in all groups but were an even mix of amplifications and mutations in the CDH1 mutation 
negative UBC (p>0.05). RB1 GA were more common in both PLC and non-PLC than in the CDH1 mutation negative cases.

Conclusions: CDH1 mutation positive UBC exhibits differential GA depending on histological appearance. MTAP, CDKN2A, 
and CDKN2B, genes located on chromosome 9p21, were increasingly mutated in non-PLC CDH1 mutation positive UCB. The 
clinical implications of this mutational pattern require further exploration.

Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the top diagnosed cancer in men of North America, with 20% of the cases being lethal. In 
2022, 268,490 new PCa diagnosis and 34,500 related deaths are projected to occur in the US. Although surgical, radiation, and 
androgen-ablation therapies are effective for localized PCa, progression to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) 
is essentially inevitable. However, the epigenetic and metabolic reprograming involved in PCa progression is largely unknown. 
Recently, Nicotinamide N Methyltransferase (NNMT) is reported to modulate cancer cell epigenome by acting as a S-adenosyl-
methionine (SAM) sink. Therefore, understanding its expression pattern and function in PCa development is of great potential for 
prognosis prediction and personalized therapies. 
Design: To study the genetic profile of NNMT in PCa, we first explored publicly available Next Generation Sequencing datasets, 
which contains 753 of primary PCa, 203 treatment resistant PCa and 147 metastasis CRPC patient samples. Secondly, we studied 
NNMT expression pattern by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining on human PCa tissue microarrays including 469 benign tissue, 
473 primary and 305 metastases cores followed by pathological grading. Lastly, we generated a prostate 
specific Nnmt and Pten knockout (KO) mouse model and traced its cancer progression longitudinally. 
Results: In the public PCa clinical datasets, we identified 5-8% of genetic deletions of NNMT in primary (TCGA), treatment 
resistant and metastases (SU2C, MET500, Michigan mCRPC) PCa patient samples. In the NNMT IHC staining of the PCa tissue 
microarrays, a statistically significant decrease of the IHC staining scores in the primary tumors (p<0.01) and metastatic samples 
(p<0.03) were observed when compared to the benign tissue. Of note, PCa metastases showed no NNMT expression while the 
hosting organs were highly NNMT positive. It suggests that NNMT negative prostate cells potentially gained growth advantage in 
different microenvironment. Finally, by analyzing 12-month-old Nnmt and Pten double KO (n=40) and Pten KO prostate (n=26), we 
observed that the double KO prostate displayed more severe florid atypical intraductal proliferation and/or infiltrating ductal 
carcinoma. It further supports that loss of NNMT being an early driver in PCa. 
Conclusions: We identified NNMT as a bona fide tumor suppressor in PCa. NNMT IHC staining is a feasible way to detect its 
expression, the expression loss is an indicator for advanced PCa.

Background: It is recognized that there can be morphologic overlap between high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia 
(HGPIN) and intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDCP). In cases with a small number of glands with atypical cribriform 
morphology, a definitive diagnosis may be difficult to achieve. Given that HGPIN is managed conservatively while IDCP is 
recommended to be treated with definitive therapy, the distinction is clinically significant. Cases with indeterminant features 
between the two entities are diagnosed as “Atypical Intraductal Proliferation” (AIP). We explored the pathologic findings of patients 
diagnosed with AIP. 
Design: The surgical pathology databases from three institutions were searched from 2003-2022 for cases of AIP. Pathologic 
findings were evaluated in the initial biopsy specimen with AIP as well as any follow-up biopsies or resection specimens. 
Results: We identified 102 patients with a diagnosis of AIP, which consisted of 100 biopsies and 2 transurethral 
resection specimens. Concurrent cancer was identified in 81/102 (79%) initial specimens. Of the cases with cancer on initial biopsy, 
39/81 (48%) had grade group (GG) 1 tumor, 28/81 (35%) had GG2 tumor, 10/81 (12%) had GG3 tumor, 1/81 (1%) had GG4 tumor, 
and 3/81 (4%) had GG5 tumor. Subsequent management included radical prostatectomy (RP) (n=41), active surveillance (n=29), 
radiation therapy (n=15), androgen deprivation therapy (n=4), and no follow-up (n=6). Repeat biopsy results were available in 21 
patients on active surveillance. Seven patients had no cancer on repeat biopsy, of which 3 had only AIP on initial biopsy. The 
remainder (14/21, 67%) had cancer on repeat biopsy (GG1=4, GG2=7, GG3=3). Five patients with only AIP on initial biopsy were 
found to have cancer on repeat biopsy (GG1=2, GG2=1, GG3=2). Cribriform morphology was present in 2 cases on repeat biopsy, 
both of which had only AIP on initial biopsy. Of the 81 patients with cancer on initial biopsy, 41 (51%) underwent RP. Of these, 
15/41 (37%) had IDCP present and 22/41 (54%) had cribriform morphology on RP. Final GG on RP included GG1=3, GG2=29, and 
>GG2=9. Extraprostatic extension was found in 19/41 (46%) of cases. No lymph node metastases were identified.

Conclusions: AIP is often found concurrently with prostatic adenocarcinoma on biopsy. Most cases of AIP alone are found to have 
cancer on repeat biopsy. Many patients with AIP who subsequently undergo RP are found to have poor pathologic findings, 
including IDCP, EPE, and cribriform morphology.

Background: Pathologic grade remains one of the most potent predictors of prostate cancer metastasis after radical prostatectomy 
(RP). Here, we tested whether deep learning algorithms applied to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSI) 
of prostate tumors and paired clinical-pathologic data can improve on standard metastasis prediction scores such as CAPRA-S. 
Design: We developed a Concatenated Feature Based Classification (CFBC) system that integrates multi-modality data from 
histopathology images and clinical parameters (including age, race, pre-operative PSA, pathologic T- and N-stage and margin 
status). The system includes four stages: A) tumor identification in H&E-stained WSI or tissue microarray (TMA) samples from the 
dominant tumor nodule at RP; B) patch generation; C) pre-training; D) classification. A SegFormer transformer model was used for 
the tumor identification task. For the pre-training task, we apply self-supervised learning using the Barlow Twin SSL ResNeXt50 
architecture, and for the classification task, we employ supervised learning using the ResNet18 architecture. The algorithm was 
trained on 241 patients from a previously published Johns Hopkins RP cohort and validated on 65 additional patients from this 
cohort, as well as tested in an independent Johns Hopkins RP cohort comprised of 242 patients. Model performance for metastasis 
prediction was assessed using area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC), and compared to the C-index obtained 
from Cox regression modeling for CAPRA-S alone. 
Results: The baseline C-index for CAPRA-S was 0.780 in the 65 patient validation cohort, compared to an AUC of 0.874 using an 
algorithm incorporating WSI and clinical-pathologic parameters. In the 242 patient test cohort, the baseline C-index for CAPRA-S 
was 0.850 versus an AUC of 0.911 with using WSI and clinical-pathologic parameters. Similar algorithms using images of 4 tumor 
punches on TMA from the dominant nodule and clinical-pathologic parameters were also tested, with an AUC of 0.873 in the 65 
patient validation cohort, and 0.834 in the 242 patient test cohort. 
Figure 1 - 727 
 
 
  
 
S713 
Conclusions: Deep learning algorithms incorporating WSI or TMA images from the dominant tumor nodule as well as clinical-
pathologic parameters outperform current clinically-utilized prognostic nomograms such as CAPRA-S for prediction of metastasis. 
Validation in additional multi-institutional as well as racially diverse cohorts is underway.

Background: Fatty acid synthase (FASN) catalyzes the synthesis of long chain saturated fatty acids and is upregulated in prostate 
cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated that FASN gene expression may be higher among prostate tumors from self-identified 
Black (BL) compared to White (WH) patients, potentially due to increased frequency of FASN gene amplification or an altered 
androgen receptor (AR) cistrome. However, FASN expression also increases in cases with ERG gene rearrangement, which is less 
common in tumors from BL men. Here, we quantified FASN expression in a racially diverse cohort of primary prostate tumors and 
examined its association with clinical, genomic and immune tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristics. 
Design: We genetically validated FASN immunohistochemistry using cell lines and analyzed its expression in a previously 
described tissue microarray constructed from radical proctectomy (RP) specimens of 371 grade-matched, self-identified BL and 
WH men with clinical follow-up and genomic copy number analysis. Digital image analysis was performed using QuPath to quantify 
average FASN H-score in tumor glands identified by lack of p63 immunostaining. 
Results: FASN expression was not significantly associated with tumor grade or pathologic stage, but was significantly higher 
among WH compared to BL patients (p=0.02).  ERG-positive tumors had significantly higher FASN expression in the overall cohort 
compared to ERG-negative tumors (p<0.0001). In a generalized linear regression model including race and ERG status and 
adjusted by clinical-pathologic factors, ERG (p=0.02) but not race (p=0.1) remained significantly associated with FASN expression 
and there was no interaction between FASN and race (p=0.9). FASN expression was weakly correlated with FASN gene copy 
number (r=0.14, p=0.02) and with percent genome altered by somatic copy number alterations (r=0.15, p=0.01). FASN expression 
was significantly correlated with density of FOXP3+ T-regulatory cells (r=0.21, p=0.0002) in both races, but not with cytotoxic T-cell, 
B-cell, macrophage, mast cell or neutrophil densities. 
Conclusions: Consistent with prior studies, ERG positivity is associated with higher FASN expression, but there is not an 
independent association of FASN expression with self-identified race. The association of FASN expression with increased 
immunosuppressive T-regulatory cells suggests a potential interaction between prostate cancer lipid metabolism and the immune 
TME. 
 
729   Mesothelioma of Uncertain Malignant Potential of Tunica Vaginalis (MUMP) – Novel

Disclosures: Chien-Kuang Cornelia Ding: None; Oleksandr Kryvenko: None; Huihui Ye: None; Jonathan Epstein: None 
Background: Arising from the testis tunica vaginalis, well-differentiated papillary mesothelial tumor (WDPMT) with pure papillary 
architecture lined by a single layer of bland cuboidal cells and malignant mesothelioma (MM) are well-recognized entities. With 8 
cases first reported by one of the current authors in 2010, MUMP is rare with only 5 cases subsequently reported. MUMP has 
areas typical of WDPMT but predominantly consists of more complex cribriform architecture (Fig. 1A), and is not seen in other 
mesothelial sites. 
Design: 12 cases of MUMP were identified (2010-2022) from the consultation files of the authors. 
Results: Clinical features are summarized in Table 1. Patients’ age at presentation averaged 56 years (range: 24 to 81). Only one 
patient self-identified with asbestos exposure. In addition to classic findings of MUMP, newly described histologies seen in the 
current series include: solid foci (Fig. 1B) (n=1); cystic areas (Fig. 1C) (n=1); cellular spindle cells lacking hyperchromasia, atypia,

or increased mitotic activity (n=5) with osteoclast-like giant cells in 1 of these cases (Fig. 1D); and prominent collagen deposition in 
2 of these cases (Fig. 1E). Despite architectural complexity, MUMP’s cytology was identical to the WDPM-like area. No case 
showed cytological features of MM and none were associated with invasion. 9 cases were multifocal.  All 5 analyzable cases 
showed retained MTAP and BAP1 immunohistochemically (Fig. 1F), with low Ki-67 labeling index (most <5%, up to 10%).  No 
patient received adjuvant chemoradiation after surgery. Follow-up information was available in 8 patients, 6 patients for more than 
1 year (1.5 - 11 years, median 2 years). None showed evidence of disease recurrence or metastases post-surgery.

Conclusions: The current series expands the morphology that may be seen in MUMP with additional cases followed with no 
recurrence/metastases.  Despite greater architectural complexity, evidence supporting MUMP is a variant of WDPMT includes: 1) 
bland cytology; 2) merging in with WDPMT areas; 3) low mitotic/Ki-67 rate; 4) retention of MTAP/BAP1; and 5) benign clinical 
follow-up. If these cases were MM, one would have expected at least some of the patients to demonstrate disease 
recurrence/progression without adjuvant therapy within the available follow-up time, particularly with limited resection in most 
patients. Nevertheless, MUMP is currently a reasonable term, given the limited number of these lesions that have been studied and 
followed.

Background: Low-grade oncocytic renal tumor of the kidney (LOT) has been proposed as a new entity. LOTs and oncocytomas 
cannot be differentiated from each other morphologically except by immunostains. Renal oncocytic neoplasms with low-grade 
features that characteristically demonstrate CK7-positivity and CD117-negativity are classified as LOTS while the converse is true 
for oncocytomas. Our study aims to use a deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) approach on hematoxylin and eosin-stained 
(H&E) whole-slide images (WSI) to classify these tumors as LOTs, oncocytomas, or chromophobe renal cell carcinomas 
(ChRCC).    
Design: We retrospectively identified and retrieved (77) oncocytic tumors, including 29 cases of LOT, 25 cases of oncocytoma and 
23 ChRCC. Clinicopathologic parameters including age, gender, tumor size, and location of tumor on radiology (exophytic vs 
endophytic) were recorded. H&E-stained slides and immunohistochemical slides were reviewed and digitized. Digitized images 
were annotated with labels of the three histologic classes by 3 GU pathologists. Extracted patch images were pre-processed and 
split into a 7:2:1 ratio and fed into a convolutional neural network. 
Results: Patients with LOT ranged in age from 23 to 84 years (mean, 67.3 years). The tumors ranged in size from 1.0 cm to 
11.5cm (mean, 4.38 cm). Patients with oncocytomas ranged in age from 38 to 77 (mean, 63.5 years). The tumors ranged in size 
from 1.7 cm to 10.4 cm (mean, 4.29 cm). The male: female ratio was 1:1.7 for LOT and 4:1 for oncocytoma. This difference was 
statistically significant (p=0.005). Patients with oncocytomas were more likely described as having exophytic tumors (9/11 cases, 
81.8%).  We developed a residual learning-based deep learning framework for oncocytoma and LOT prediction on the patch level 
(Figure 1). The AI model was able to achieve 3-class predictions with accuracy of 61.7%, precision of 62.1%, and recall 60.2%. 
Figure 1 - 730 
 
Conclusions: Although this study shows promising results for the use of deep learning AI to differentiate LOTs from other renal 
oncocytic tumors, it also highlights the challenges that need to be overcome. Based on the limited dataset, a deep learning 
approach to distinguish between LOTs, oncocytomas and ChRCC using H&E WSI is not currently feasible and IHC use remains 
the gold standard. Creation of public large-scale curated datasets of oncocytic tumors is needed to allow investigation of multiple 
deep-learning approaches.

Background: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most common malignancies. Like other types of cancer, the stage at 
presentation is one of the major prognostic parameters. Based on the size alone, RCC ≤ 4 cm is staged as pT1a. RCC ≤3 cm in 
size has also recently become recommended for surveillance. The aim of this study is to elucidate the prevalence of small RCC 
(≤4 cm) that present at high stage (pT3) and their association with RCC variants as well as their clinicopathologic features. 
Design: All RCC cases that were ≤4 cm, including clear cell RCC (cRCC), papillary RCC (pRCC), chromophobe RCC (chrRCC) 
and unclassified RCC (uRCC), accessioned from 2017 to 2021 at our institution were retrieved from the archives. There was a total 
of 496 RCC cases that met the size criteria, of which 408 were cRCCs, 46 pRCCs, 40 chrRCCs, and 2uRCCs. Among the 496 
RCCs ≤4 cm, 51 (10%) were staged pT3. For each of these small size and high stage RCC cases, patient demographic, 
pathologic, and any available follow-up information was collected. 
Results: In our cohort of 51 RCC cases of small size and high stage, the tumor size ranged from 1 to 4 cm, patients’ age from 39 
to 89 (68±11) and male: female ratio at 2.6:1. Based on the available follow up data, 29% (12/51) of patients presented with distant 
metastasis (liver, lung, bone, etc), 6% (3/51) with local recurrence, 23% (12/51) cases with no disease progression at follow up ≥6 
months, and 41% (21/51) only had short follow up (<6 months) and /or were lost to follow up.  In addition, of the 51 cases, 37% 
(19/51) of tumors were ≤3 cm in maximum dimension. The results are summarized in Table 1. 
Table 1. Prevalence and clinical and pathologic features of RCC with size ≤4 cm and stage pT3 (n=51) 
 
Conclusions: Although uncommon, small RCCs (≤4 cm) may present at high stages, even tumors ≤ 3 cm that are often 
recommended for active surveillance. These tumors were found to be most often located in the upper to mid poles. Renal vein and 
perinephric invasion contributed to the high stage in most cases. Although the most common variants were cRCC and pRCC, 
pRCC and uRCC tumors seemed to be more likely to present at stage pT3 than the former. About 29% cases reviewed presented 
with distant metastasis. Metastasis appeared to be more strongly associated with middle lobe location, renal vein invasion, nuclear 
grades 3 and 4, and pRCC and uRCC subtypes. Like RCC in the general population, age and gender had no significant impact. 
Though further validation is warranted, the findings are of significant clinical implications in patient management.

Background: American men of African ancestry (AA) develop prostate cancer (PC) at twice the rate of their European ancestry 
(EA) counterparts, present at higher stages and tend to be more aggressive. Preliminary evidence from our whole-genome 
sequencing cohort of localized AA PC demonstrates differences in mutational signatures that implicate genomic stability. 
Interestingly, improved responses in AA men to Sipuleucel-T (an immune-based therapy) and radiotherapies have been observed 
in advanced disease. In this study we aim to investigate the correlation between the expression of MMR proteins in localized PC 
and their variation between AA and EA men. 
Design: Radical prostatectomies from self-reported ancestries of 156 AA and 41 EA specimens represented in tissue microarrays 
were interrogated by IHC for MSH2 and MSH6. Digital analysis was run by using HALO® software through annotating the Regions 
of Interest (ROIs), classifying tumor nuclei, and measuring the stain expression via an automated cytonuclear algorithm (Figure 1). 
A numerical score (0-4) was set to match the percentage of stain preservation within tumor nuclei and a threshold of 0.2 score to 
consider a case as MMR-deficient (MMR-d). 
Results: Quantitative image analysis shows a significant loss of MSH6 stain in AA (mean score=1.56) compared to EA tumors 
(mean score=2.74) (P<0.0001), observed in 27 (17%) and 3 (7%) cases, respectively (Figure 2A). There was not a statistical 
difference in MSH2 expression; 23 of AA PC (14.7%) were found to be MSH2 deficient compared to 5 EA cases (12%) with mean 
scores of 1.78 and 1.95, respectively (P=0.4) (Figure 2B). Grade group 4 showed slightly lower expression than other groups, not 
significant. No correlation was identified between MSH2/MSH6 scores and age, Grade group or pathological stage (Table 1).

Background: Death from prostate cancer (PC) is most commonly due to the development of metastatic, castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (mCRPC). Among these, androgen-independent tumors with variant histology, often referred to as neuroendocrine 
prostate cancer (NEPC), represent the most aggressive variants. The aim of this study was to identify new targets – an unmet 
clinical need – via integrative whole genome (WGS) and transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) analysis of metastatic PC. 
Design: WGS was performed on 55 tumor/normal pairs (CRPC_Adenocarcinoma n= 32, CRPC_NEPC n=13, de novo NEPC n=7, 
metastatic hormone naive PC n=3) from 48 patients. RNAseq data was available in a subset of 21 samples. We employed the Isabl 
GxT analytic platform and manually curated single base substitution (SBS) molecular signatures and structural variants (SV) that 
involved tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. 
 
  
 
S719 
Results: We observed 184 events in cancer-associated genes and targets in 38 cases. Rare ETS fusions were identified in 2 
patients (MSMB-ERG and YWHAE-ETV4). Other rare events included SVs affecting ALK (SLC45A3-ALK) 
and FGFR1 amplification in 1 patient each. Relevant pathogenic germline alterations were identified in 15% of cases affecting 
genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM, and other genes of uncertain relevance for prostate cancer (e.g., PPM1D and MUTYH). 
SBS genomic signatures associated with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) were observed in 15% of the patients (7 
cases): 3 harbored germline BRCA1/2 mutations, 2 with somatic BRCA2 mutations, and 2 without alteration in BRCA1/2 (1 of these 
had a complex SV affecting RAD51B). Further, molecular signatures of potential clinical relevance were detected at varying 
contributions and included CDK12-type genomic instability (2 cases) (4%) and MMR deficiency with POLD1 proofreading (1 
case). See Table 1 and Figure 1 and Figure 2.

Background: Androgen receptor-independent metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) represents up to 25-30% 
of lethal prostate cancer. We reconstructed the transcriptomic data from our Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) cohort of patients with 
mCRPC with adenocarcinoma morphology (mCRPC-Ad) and treatment-emergent neuroendocrine prostate cancer (tNEPC) to 
observe the tumor microenvironment (TME), genomic characteristics, and molecular diversity of samples in association with clinical 
outcomes. Data were combined with datasets from publicly available cohorts. 
 
  
 
S721 
Design: We performed RNA-seq (n=23) and whole-exome sequencing (WES; n=36) on our cohort of 14 patients, including 3 rapid 
autopsies with multiple samples. In addition, we developed a meta-cohort of 358 prostate cancer samples from publicly available 
RNA-seq cohorts (Table 1). Unsupervised clustering was used for TME classification, and the Kassandra deconvolution algorithm 
(Cancer Cell 2022) was used to calculate cellular composition. Differential gene expression (DGE) was analyzed. The Mann-
Whitney U test was used for statistical analyses. 
Results: Five distinct TME subtypes were identified (Figure 1): immune desert neuroendocrine-like (IDN) (24.3%), immune desert 
basal-like (IDB) (15.6%), fibrotic (F) (20.3%), immune enriched (IE)-neutrophil enriched (IENE) (16.4%), and IE-T cell enriched 
(IETE) (23.4%). Expression of neuroendocrine gene signatures, basal-like signatures, T-cell fractions (CD4, CD8), and neutrophil 
content were higher in the IDN, IDB, IETE and IENE subtypes, respectively (P<0.001) (Figure 2A). Half of mCRPC-Ad were 
classified as IDB and almost all tNEPC and mixed samples were within the IDN subtype. Liver, lymph node, and bone metastases 
were more prevalent in IDN, IETE, and IENE, respectively. Overall survival (OS) analysis showed a trend of IDN and IENE being 
more aggressive than IETE, F, and IDB (p > 0.05). DGE analysis to delineate tNEPC revealed a new stem cell 
marker, FOXJ1 (mean logFC = 3.725, p < 0.001), a known cell stemness gene that had not previously been described in tNEPC 
(Figure 2B).

Conclusions: mCRPC has five novel TME subtypes with molecular characteristics associated with histology, sample site, and 
clinical annotation. We also describe FOXJ1 as a potential novel marker of tNEPC. The subtype classification of CRPC/NEPC 
presents a novel molecular stratification with potential clinic-pathologic significance.

Background: Unlike other genitourinary cancers, such as renal cell carcinoma, visual microscopic examination of prostate cancer 
has failed to reveal a reproducible association between tumor molecular subtype and morphologic features. However, deep 
learning-based algorithms trained on whole slide images (WSI) from large cohorts with known molecular classification may 
outperform the human eye and provide a cost-effective and rapid method to identify cases with clinically relevant genomic 
alterations. As proof of principle, we describe one such algorithm to identify prostate tumors with underlying ERG fusions and/or 
PTEN deletion.   
Design: We created a Concatenated Feature Based Classification (CFBC) system based on deep learning that extracts non-linear 
characteristics from histopathology imaging data for improved prediction of molecular markers. The system included four stages: A) 
tumor identification in histopathology images; B) patch generation; C) pre-training; D) classification. The pre-training task utilized a 
single representative hematoxylin and eosin-stained (H&E) WSI of the dominant nodule from each of 242 tumors from a previously 
published Johns Hopkins radical prostatectomy cohort where ERG/PTEN status were determined by genetically validated 
immunohistochemistry assays. For pre-training, we applied self-supervised learning using the Barlow Twin SSL ResNeXt50 
architecture. The classification task employed supervised learning using ResNet18 architecture and was performed on three Johns 
Hopkins validation cohorts where ERG/PTEN status were determined by previous immunohistochemistry. 
Results: ERG algorithm performance was assessed on two radical prostatectomy cohorts, including 64 additional WSI held out 
from the pre-training cohort (AUC: 0.89) and 248 WSI from an independent radical prostatectomy cohort (AUC: 0.86). In addition, 
we tested ERG algorithm performance in 202 WSI from a needle biopsy cohort of patients undergoing radiation therapy (AUC: 
 
  
 
S723 
0.80).  PTEN algorithm performance was assessed using 64 additional WSI held out from the pre-training cohort (AUC: 0.76) and a 
previously published cohort of 214 WSI of Grade Group 2 needle biopsies (AUC:0.74). 
Conclusions: A deep learning algorithm to predict ERG/PTEN status on H&E stained WSI images from prostate carcinoma, 
showed excellent performance across three independent validation cohorts, including radical prostatectomy and needle biopsy 
tissues. Similar algorithms to predict underlying DNA repair defects may be clinically useful.

Background: High-risk HPV is considered a major etiological co-factor in penile carcinomas. About 30 to 40% of invasive 
carcinomas and 80 to 90% of Penile Intraepithelial Neoplasias (PeIN) are associated with high-risk genotypes of HPV. The 
relationship of genital condylomas and carcinoma is not well established because the majority of condylomas are associated with 
low-risk HPVs, not considered carcinogenic 
Design: Cases were selected from the files of the Instituto de Patologia e Investigacion. Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM)-
PCR and p16 immunostaining were performed at the DDL laboratory in the Netherlands. Study cases were selected from a group 
of 191 lesions. Condylomas were classified as acuminatum and flat, each further subclassified in typical (common condyloma) or 
atypical. In the former no atypical cells were identified. In the latter atypical cells were present in the lower third of epithelial 
thickness 
Results: The majority of the lesions were from the foreskin of older patients. High-risk HPV genotytypes (HPV16, 39) were 
identified in 14 condylomata (5 patients) as shown in Table 1. Morphological features varied from typical condylomata acuminata (3 
cases), atypical condylomata acuminata (3 cases), mixed atypical flat condylomata (5 cases). Most cases were p16 positive. Low-
risk HPV genotypes (HPV87, 84, 11, 44) were detected in 5 warty and basaloid PeINs from 3 patients. Most cases were p16 
negative

Conclusions: Unexpectedly, high-risk HPV genotypes were present in a set of condylomas, especially those with moderate atypia, 
and low-risk HPV genotypes in high-grade variants of PeIN. The findings suggest that more studies are needed to elucidate the 
role of condylomas in the pathogenesis of HPV driven penile carcinomas

Background: Although active surveillance has emerged as a therapeutic option for low-risk prostate cancer (PCa), optimal 
prognostic biomarkers to select patients who may benefit from early curative treatment are lacking. Previous studies have shown 
an association between germline mutations, such as those in DNA repair genes (ATM, BRCA1/2), and grade reclassification. 
However, prevalence and clinical significance of somatic genomic alterations in large cohorts of PCa patients on active surveillance 
have not been reported. Our aim was to identify potential somatic genomic biomarkers of progression (grade reclassification) for 
patients with PCa undergoing active surveillance. 
Design: We included patients from a large multi-institutional cohort of men with low-risk PCa on active surveillance. Tumor DNA 
was assessed using Oncomine Comprehensive Panel (OCP v2), a next-generation sequencing clinical assay to interrogate single 
nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (indels) in 99 oncogenes and tumor suppressors, copy number variations 
(CNVs) in 75 genes. 
Results: Of 634 patients with available diagnostic FPPE prostate biopsy blocks, 291 had PCa with sufficient tumor DNA. Clinico-
pathological characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1. Of 291 patients, 121 (41.6%) experienced upgrading 
(reclassification) at a follow-up biopsy at time of analysis. We identified 52 somatic SNVs and indels in 41 patients (14.1%). Among 
them, 26 likely pathogenic/pathogenic somatic alterations were found in the tumors of 23 patients (7.9%), including in ATM (n= 
3), BRCA1 (n=2), BRCA2 (n=1), CHEK2 (n=1), PIK3CA (n=1), TP53 (n=1), SPOP (n=4), PTEN (n=1) or RAS 
(n=5) genes. FGFR1 and APEX1 gene amplifications were found in 1 tumor. No significant association was identified between 
individual pathogenic SNVs/CNVs, including those occurring in DNA repair genes, and tumor grade reclassification (Figure 1A). 
Patients with genomic alterations classified as benign/likely benign/variant of uncertain significance (n=18) had shorter time to 
grade reclassification (Figure 1B). Whether this association reflects a biological significance remains to be elucidated.

Conclusions: We provide a first assessment of somatic genomic alterations in PCa in a large multi-institutional cohort of patients 
on active surveillance. Potentially owing to the low prevalence of pathogenic genomic alterations (7.9%), no association between 
pathogenic genomic alterations and grade reclassification was identified.

Choy: None; Maha Hussain: None; Ximing Yang: None 
Background: Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate (LCNCAP) is a rare entity that has been mostly described in 
patients associated with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). De novo cases have been reported, but not well studied. We report 
six cases of de novo LCNCAP from our institution with detailed clinical, pathological analyses and molecular characterization. 
Design: We conducted a retrospective search in our database from 2012 to 2022, and 6 cases of LCNCAP were identified. Clinical 
and morphologic information including age, serologic markers, histologic findings, ancillary tests, treatment, and follow-up are 
summarized. 
Results: Median age at diagnosis was 65 years (60-78). None of our patients had previously received ADT. Median PSA level was 
27.1 ng/mL (1.5-115). Two patients had elevated serum chromogranin. The tumors had large solid nests with focal central necrosis 
and large pleomorphic cells with prominent nucleoli, salt/pepper chromatin, and brisk mitotic activity (Fig 1A). Three cases (50%) 
had concomitant adenocarcinoma, and all cases partially retained at least one prostatic marker (NKX-31, PSA, AMACR) (Fig 1B). 
All three cases tested for TTF-1 were negative. The tumors were highly proliferative with a median Ki-67 of 70% (20-90) (Fig 1C). 
All cases tested positive for neuroendocrine markers (synaptophysin, chromogranin, NSE) (Fig 1D). Three cases were subjected to 
next-generation sequencing, and all were microsatellite stable. TP53 mutations (2/3), PTEN (2/3) and RB1 (2/3) losses were 
identified. Among six patients, one was treated with radical prostatectomy/radiation, two with radiation or radiation/chemotherapy, 
and three with chemotherapy only. All patients had metastatic disease at the diagnosis, the most common sites being lymph nodes 
(50%) and bone (50%), followed by liver (33%) and lung (33%). After a median follow-up of 15 months, 4 patients died (median 
survival 15 months). Two patients are alive with multisite metastasis (23 and 8 months of follow-up). 
Figure 1 - 738 
 
Conclusions: LCNCAP is a morphologically defined variant of prostate cancer. At least half of our cases coexisted with Grade 
group 5 adenocarcinoma. LCNCAP is composed of large pleomorphic cells with partial loss of prostatic markers, diffuse positivity 
for neuroendocrine markers, and high Ki-67. Our cases were microsatellite stable, but we identified TP53 mutations and loss 
of PTEN and RB1. The prognosis is dismal despite active therapy, with 67% mortality after a median follow-up of 15 months.

Background: Primary LCNEC of the urinary tract is a rare and poorly characterized, in contrast to pulmonary LCNEC where it is a 
distinct entity. Using microscopic criteria of pulmonary LCNEC (organoid nests, rosette-like structures, trabecular growth, peripheral 
palisading and cells with abundant cytoplasm, vesicular chromatin, & prominent nucleoli. We report the clinical, pathological, and 
molecular features of a cohort of urothelial LCNEC.  
Design: We identified 80 LCNEC cases (77 from bladder, 3 from upper urinary tract) and performed IHC for synaptophysin, 
chromogranin, INSM1, CD56, p53, Rb, and Ki-67. Molecular profiling by NGS was performed on 37 tumors. Clinical correlation and 
treatment outcomes (DFS, OS) were analyzed. 
Results: The study included 21 pure LCNEC tumors (26%), (LCNEC group); 21 combined small cell carcinoma (SMC) and LCNEC 
tumors (26%), with or without urothelial or other histologic subtypes (LCNEC/SMC group); and 38 LCNEC tumors (48%) that co-
existed with urothelial with/without divergent differentiation/histologic subtypes (LCNEC/UC group). LCNEC morphology was 
organoid/nests (n=49, 61%), trabecular (n=23;29%), sheets (n=36, 45%), palisading (n=12;15%) and rosette/glandular (n=25;31%). 
Prominent nucleoli were seen in 34 cases (43%). IHC showed Syn positivity in 63/71 tumors (89%), Chr in 39/66 (56%), INSM1 in 
15/16 (94%) and CD56 in 39/40 (98%). Abnormal p53 expression was seen in 34/41 tumors (83%) (71% overexpression vs 12% 
null) and Rb loss was seen in 33/47 tumors (70%). Ki67 ranged from 20 to 100% (median 70%). LCNEC and LCNEC/SMC 
pts were compared to pts with bladder SMC without concurrent LCNEC and UC-NOS.  LCNEC pts treated with cystectomy +/- 
perioperative therapy (n = 38) had shorter DFS than SMC pts (n = 95, p = 0.009) or UC NOS (n = 75, p = 0.01). Platinum-based 
NACT in 26 LCNEC patients was not associated with improved DFS or OS. Molecular profiling identified mutations 
in TP53, RB1 and TERT promoter in 34 (92%), 24 (65%) and 28 (76%) tumors, respectively. Potentially targetable alterations were 
seen in ERBB2, ERBB3, & PIK3CA (4 cases each,11%). TMB of LCNEC was lower than SMC (p = 0.003). 
Conclusions: Urothelial LCNEC is rare with a wide histopathologic spectrum.  LCNEC is more commonly admixed with SMC, 
urothelial or other histologic subtypes, but can also be pure. Among patients treated with cystectomy +/- perioperative therapy, 
LCNEC is associated with shorter DFS compared to those with SMC or UC NOS. Genomic profiles of LCNEC and SMC are similar.

Background: Urothelial carcinoma (UCa) subtypes (UCaS) and their differences in biological behavior and response to 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) may have important prognostic implications.  Currently there are sparse and disparate evidence 
on the efficacy of NAC and overall survival of the UCaS.  
Design: RC with or without NAC for UCa in between January 2015-March 2022 were selected. Clinicopathologic features, 
treatment, and survival data (date of surgery to date of death/last follow-up) were obtained. When applicable, changes in UCaS 
between biopsy and the RC specimen were noted. Squamous (Sq; Fig. 1A), glandular (Gl; Fig. 1B), micropapillary (MP; 
Fig. 1C), plasmacytoid (P; Fig. 1D), lymphoepithelioma-like (LEL), clear-cell (CC), nested (N; Fig. 1E), neuroendocrine 
(NE), sarcomatoid (Sarc), and poorly differentiated (PD; Fig. 1F) subtypes were identified. Pre- and post- treatment UCaS changes 
were compared between NAC+RC and RC using Pearson Chi-Square, Likelihood ratios, Fisher’s exact, and post hoc Bonferroni 
tests. A multivariate Cox regression (treatment, pathologic staging, lymphovascular invasion, margin status, and extranodal 
extension) was performed to analyze survival outcomes of UCaS between NAC+RC and RC only groups. A p-value of <0.05 was 
considered significant. 
 
  
 
S728 
Results: Table 1 summarizes the findings. Of a total of 91 cases (male:female ratio = 28/4; median age 69.1), 32 (35%) had UCaS 
either in their biopsies or resection, 5/32 (16%) had more than one UCaS. 15/32 (47%) patients with UCaS received NAC+RS. 16 
(50%) biopsies had no UCaS, and biopsies with UCaS were as follows: 5 (16%) Sq, 2 (6%) Gl, 2 (6%) MP, 2 (6%) P, 2 (6%) Sarc, 
1 (3%) NE, 1 (3%), and 1 PD (3%). In RC 11 (34%) Sq, 7 (22%) MP, 6 (19%) N, 1 (3%) Pl, 1 (3%) Sarc, and 1 (3%) PD UCaS were 
identified. 16 (50%) cases had UCaS in RC that were absent in biopsy. 16 new UCAs (9 RC only, 7 NAC+RC) were present in 
resection (8 Sq, 3 MP, 2 PD, 1 Gl, 1 LEL, 1 N). 7/15 (47%) UCaS identified in biopsy (1 Sq, 1 Gl, 1 CC, 1 MP, 1 Pl, 1 PD, 1 NE) 
were not present in resections in cases with NAC+RC (vs. no such cases in RC only group, p=0.005). The mean overall for cases 
with is 17.15 months (Median 3.6, range: 0.03-83.13). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed margin status to be most 
predictive of better survival outcome (Table1). 
Figure 1 - 740 
 
Figure 2 - 740 
 
Conclusions: NAC+RC was associated with significant UCaS changes in biopsy versus resection, with complete absence of 
biopsy proven UCaS in following resection subset of cases.

Background: The presence of perineural invasion (PNI) by prostate cancer, particularly in biopsy (Bx) specimen, has been 
associated with adverse pathologic features, including extraprostatic extension, and resultant poor clinical outcomes. However, the 
 
  
 
S729 
impact of PNI location (e.g. apex vs. mid vs. base) on Bx remains poorly understood. We herein compare radical prostatectomy 
(RP) findings and long-term oncologic outcomes in prostate cancer patients with single Bx site PNI. 
Design: We assessed consecutive patients who had undergone systematic sextant prostate Bx (i.e. 6 sites) followed by RP from 
2009 to 2018. 434 men in our Surgical Pathology database met the inclusion criteria for PNI detected in only 1 of 6 Bx sites. Cases 
with PNI on targeted Bx were excluded from analysis. 
Results: PNI was present in right apex (n=62; 14.3%), right mid (n=70; 16.1%), right base (n=89; 20.5%), left apex (n=64; 14.7%), 
left mid (n=58; 13.4%), and left base (n=91; 21.0%). There were no significant differences in clinicopathologic features, including 
age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, Bx findings [e.g. highest Grade Group (GG), GG at the site with PNI, total tumor 
length], RP findings (e.g. GG, pT, pN, surgical margin status, estimated tumor volume), and the need for adjuvant therapy before 
recurrence, between those exhibiting PNI on the right and left. Similarly, no significant differences in these features were seen in 
PNI at apex vs. mid vs. base. Kaplan-Meier analysis coupled with log-rank test revealed no significant difference in the risk of 
disease progression after RP in patients with PNI on the right vs. left (P=0.614). However, PNI at the apex was associated with a 
significantly higher risk of progression, compared with PNI at the mid or base. In multivariate analysis with Cox regression model, 
apex (vs. mid or base) PNI showed significance for progression (hazard ratio 1.829, 95% confidence interval 1.183-
2.827, P=0.007).

Conclusions: In Bx specimens exhibiting PNI in 1 of sextant sites, PNI at the apex was independently associated with poorer 
prognosis, but not worse histopathologic features in RP specimens, compared with PNI at the mid or base. Pathologists may thus 
need to report the presence of PNI in every Bx site, which is likely to be useful for the risk stratification of prostate cancer.

Background: Approximately 1 million prostate biopsies are undertaken in the US each year representing a significant proportion of 
histopathology workload. With many laboratories facing insufficient staff coverage, diagnostic AI-based software is an attractive 
option. To justify the use of these technologies, we must first understand the landscape of current standard of care which is 
pathologist without AI assistance; but detailed workflow data on diagnostic practices are not routinely available. 
Design: Articulate Pro (Artificial Intelligence for Cellular Pathology Transformation in Prostate Practice) is a prospective study of a 
market authorized prostate biopsy AI diagnostic assistance software with tumor detection, quantification and grading modules. To 
enable data collection by pathologists, an interactive browser-based study capture tool was developed using the Grails open-
source web application framework (figure 1&2). Pathologists captured diagnostic and health economic data within the study capture 
tool alongside reporting of cases as part of standard of care to establish the baseline workflow, enabling quantitative comparison 
with AI assisted workflows in later phases of the study.

Results: 100 consecutive prostate biopsies were reported by 4 histopathologists in one academic hospital histopathology 
laboratory with a fully digital pathology workflow. Cases included Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) biopsies (n=56, mean 11.9 
biopsies per case) and Local Anaesthetic Transperineal (LATP)/template systematic biopsies (n=44, mean 19.8/23.5 
biopsies).  The mean viewing and typing times are shown in table 1 with an overall mean time to view the digital slides per case of 
32.3 min (range 8.7-101.6).  Cases were also stratified by complexity with mean times for digital slide viewing into: i)One reporting 
pathologist with H&E alone (n=67) (24.7 min, range 8.7-64.2), ii)Further work needed (IHC and/or deeper levels) necessitating 
multiple reporting sessions but only one reporting pathologist (n=18) (43.2 min, range 13.1–70.1), iii)Complex cases requiring more 
than one pathologist (n=15) (53.6 min, range 11.8–101.6 including further opinions).

Conclusions: This study provides a detailed picture of prostate biopsy reporting in Articulate Pro as the baseline for deployment of 
AI in one study centre, with case complexity increasing reviewing time.  Histopathology workflows are complex, but this complexity 
must be captured to evidence the potential health economic benefits of AI assistance.

Background: Prostatic amyloidosis may be a localized or a systemic process. We have reviewed a large series of prostatic 
amyloidosis analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS) to determine the prevalence of amyloid subtypes, and to correlate with 
patterns of histologic localization. 
Design: 150 consecutive cases of prostatic amyloidosis analyzed using MS were reviewed.  Pathology review was performed for 
99/150 (66%) cases to correlate amyloid subtype with pattern of histologic localization.  Medical chart review was performed for a 
subset of patients for relevant clinicopathologic features. 
Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 69 years. Amyloid subtyping revealed systemic amyloidosis in 86/150 (57%) cases, and 
localized amyloidosis (semenogelin) in 64/150 (43%) cases (Table 1).  Systemic amyloidosis was predominantly comprised of 
ATTR (n=55), followed by AL (lambda: 25; kappa: 2), and ALECT2 in rare instances (n=4).  In cases with known specimen type 
(Table 1), 75% (51/68) of cases of systemic amyloidosis were identified on biopsy. In contrast, localized amyloidosis (semenogelin) 
was predominantly identified on resection specimens 27/40 (68%).  Assessment of patterns of histologic localization revealed that 
all cases with localized amyloidosis had a subepithelial distribution (semenogelin, 39/39, 100%), as opposed to systemic 
amyloidosis, in which none of the cases had similar localization (0/60, 0%).  Among patients with available follow-up and systemic 
amyloidosis, ATTR amyloidosis was identified in 10 patients. No evidence of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis was identified on 
ancillary molecular studies in patients that were tested (8/10). Two patients within this cohort had multiple subtypes of amyloid 
(semenogelin/ATTR & AL-lambda/ATTR).  Of note, 7 of 17 patients had documented cardiac amyloidosis, and 5 of these patients 
were identified following detection of amyloid on histologic evaluation of prostate specimens (ATTR: 4; AL-lambda: 1). Clinical 
follow-up was available for 17 patients (mean follow-up: 57 months, range: 4-129), and 3 of 17 patients died of systemic 
amyloidosis-related complications. No prostate cancer-specific mortality was identified. 
 
 
  
 
S732 
Conclusions: In summary, our results confirm specific patterns of systemic amyloid localization in prostatic tissue compared to 
localized amyloidosis (semenogelin).  Our results emphasize that diagnosis and MS-based subtyping of amyloid on histopathologic 
examination of prostatic specimens can have significant impact on patient management.

Background: A recent outcome-based radical prostatectomy (RP) study defined >0.25 mm diameter to distinguish large versus 
small cribriform glands, with >0.25 mm diameter cribriform glands associated with worse recurrence free survival.  We aim to 
determine whether identification of >0.25 mm cribriform glands in Gleason score 3+4=7 (Grade Group 2, GG2) patients at biopsy is 
associated with adverse pathology at RP. 
Design: We identified 133 GG2 prostate cancer patients biopsy with subsequent RP (2000-2016).  Tumor containing slides were 
re-reviewed for largest diameter cribriform gland; henceforth, large is defined as largest cribriform diameter >0.25 mm and small as 
<=0.25 mm. The primary outcome was adverse pathology (Gleason score 4+3=7 or greater, GG3-5; stage pT3a or greater, or 
pN1).  The secondary outcome was recurrence free survival (RFS), defined as 2 consecutive prostate specific antigen (PSA) 
measurements greater than 0.02 ng/ml 7-8 weeks following RP or receipt of salvage treatment. 
Results: Cribriform pattern was present in 53/133 (40%) patients; of these, 37/53 (70%) had small cribriform glands and 16/53 
(30%) had large cribriform glands.  Patients with large cribriform glands had significantly increased adverse pathology at RP 
compared to patients with small cribriform glands, and patients without cribriform glands (large 11/16, 69%; small 12/37, 32%; no 
cribriform 25/80, 31%; Chisq p-value 0.01). On multivariate analysis, largest cribriform gland was also associated with adverse 
pathology, independent of age at diagnosis, PSA and PSA density at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, and biopsy cores % positive 
(global p-value 0.0171). Large cribriform glands was also associated with increased CAPRA-S surgical risk score relative to small 
cribriform glands (Interquartile range: large 2.00-5.00; small 1.00-3.00; no cribriform 1.00-4.00; Kruskal-Wallis p-value 0.02). No 
significant differences were seen with RFS after RP. 
Conclusions: In GG2 patients who underwent RP, large cribriform glands is associated with increased risk of adverse pathology, 
but not BCR, which could be due to sampling error or low power.  The presence of large cribriform histology should be taken into 
account when considering AS for those with GG2 disease.

Background: Molecular-based risk classifier tests are increasingly being utilized by urologists to guide clinical decision making. 
The Decipher prostate biopsy test is designed to predict likelihood of high-grade disease at radical prostatectomy (RP) and risk of 
metastasis and mortality. The test provides a risk category of low, intermediate, or high. We investigated histologic features of 
biopsies in which the Grade Group (GG) and Decipher risk category were discrepant. 
Design: We included patients who had the Decipher molecular assay performed from 2016 to 2020 and were either GG>3 with low 
Decipher risk category or were GG1 with high Decipher risk category. The biopsy slide on which Decipher testing was performed 
was re-reviewed for Gleason score and various histologic patterns, including types of Gleason pattern 4 and pattern 5, intraductal 
carcinoma (IDC), mucinous carcinoma, atrophic carcinoma, carcinoma with basal cells, carcinoma with vacuolations, ductal 
carcinoma, collagenous fibroplasia, and stromal reaction. 
Results: Among 234 men who underwent RP and had Decipher testing on their biopsy specimen, there were 23 cases (10%) with 
discrepant molecular risk and GG, of which 15 (6%) had biopsy slides available for review. Of the 5 GG1 cases with high molecular 
risk, 2 were GG2 on re-review, with non-cribriform Gleason pattern 4. At least one unusual histologic pattern was seen in each of 
the 5 cases. These 5 cases showed carcinoma with basal cells (1), atrophic carcinoma (3), mucinous carcinoma (1), collagenous 
fibroplasia (1), and mild stromal reaction (1). Of these 5 patients, 4 underwent RP, and all 4 were pT2 at RP. 
 
  
 
S733 
Of the 10 cases with low molecular risk and GG>3, 1 had large cribriform, 2 had small cribriform, and 1 had both large and small 
cribriform. One case had single cell/single file Gleason pattern 5, 1 had IDC, 1 had vacuolated carcinoma, 1 had ductal carcinoma, 
and 1 had mild stromal reaction. Of these 10 patients, 2 remained on active surveillance, 1 was lost to follow up, and 7 underwent 
RP. Of the 7 patients who underwent RP, 4 were pT3a and 3 were pT2 at RP.   
Conclusions: Unusual histologic patterns were rarely seen in increased molecular risk relative to GG. Despite training in large 
data dets, molecular classifiers may be less robust in rare patterns.

Disclosures: Scott Gregory: None; Michael Feely: None; Cathy Gonsalves: None; Robert Allan: None; Sara Falzarano: None 
Background: The aim of this study is to evaluate optimal surgical pathology tissue sampling in TURPs from men with incidentally 
found T1a (less than 5% of tissue involvement) prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCA) and assess whether additional sampling has the 
potential to significantly affect risk assessment and follow up in the contemporary era. 
Design: Our surgical pathology files were interrogated for all TURPs with PCA diagnosis performed at our institution between 
November 2016 and December 2021. Patients with previously diagnosed PCA were excluded. The remaining cases were reviewed 
and clinicopathological data were recorded in an IRB approved database, including age, race, PSA, presence/absence and type of 
symptoms, specimen weight, initial number of blocks submitted, total blocks submitted, Grade Group(GG), percent Gleason pattern 
4(%GP4), presence/absence of cribriform morphology (CRM) and/or intraductal carcinoma (IDCP), % of tissue involved, number of 
blocks involved, first positive block ID, change in % tissue, GG, and %GP4 with added blocks, and follow up (F/U) information, 
when available, such as MRI (PIRADS), biopsy results, and treatment. 
Results: Of total 502 TURPs, 57 (11%) cases fulfilled study inclusion criteria.  Clinicopathological data are summarized in table 1. 
With an average weight of 1.1 grams of tissue per block, 91% of cancers were identified within the first 10 submitted blocks (Figure 
1). Additional sampling did not change the percent of tissue involved or the final GG, nor significantly increased or decreased 
percentage of pattern 4. Of the 4 (9%) cases not identified within the first 10 blocks, all were GG1 and T1a.

Conclusions: Sampling of 10 blocks of TURP chips led to identification of greater than 90% of incidental cancer at TURP with no 
clinically significant cancer left undetected. Moreover, additional sampling in cases with less than 5% of tissue involved by cancer 
did not result in any change in risk category by pathologic findings.

Background: Spermatocytic tumor (ST) is a testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) that commonly affects older men. Unlike type II 
post-pubertal TGCTs, STs do not arise from germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS) and typically lack i(12p). Recently, it has been 
reported that a subset of anaplastic ST harbor copy number gains involving chromosome 12; however, an in-depth molecular 
evaluation of ST with anaplasia and/or aggressive clinicopathologic features (ST-A) has not been undertaken. 
Design: We evaluated 17 STs (14 ST-A, 3 conventional) using next-generation sequencing (447-gene panel) and genome-wide 
methylation profiling. 
Results: Among 14 ST-A cases, 10 were uniformly anaplastic (with or without other aggressive features), 1 had conventional 
histology and lymphovascular invasion, 1 had sarcomatous transformation and 2 had a combination of conventional and anaplastic 
areas. DNA sequencing was successful in 15/17 cases (Table 1), demonstrating hotspot gain-of-
function NRAS/HRAS/BRAF alterations in 5/15 cases (4 ST-A, 1 conventional) and loss-of-function TP53 mutations in 2/15 cases 
(both ST-A). One of the latter was a ST with rhabdomyosarcomatous (RMS) transformation (case 12) in which the ST and RMS 
components were differentially dissected and sequenced in parallel, both demonstrating a shared TP53 alteration.  Copy-number 
gains involving chromosome 9/9p (12/15 cases) and evidence of whole-genome duplication with widespread loss-of-heterozygosity 
(6/15 cases, all ST-A) were significantly recurrent. A subset demonstrated copy-number losses or copy-neutral loss-of-
heterozygosity of chromosome 13 (4/15 cases, all ST-A). Copy number gains involving 12/12p were identified in case 9 (by prior 
SNP array only) and case 10 (by sequencing and prior SNP array). Findings suggestive of 12p were also identified in a background 
of widespread copy number changes in the RMS component of case 12. Methylation analysis was performed to compare a subset 
of 15 cases (12 ST-A, 3 conventional) with 3 seminomas. Using the top 1000 differentially methylated probes, case 10 (ST-A) and 
the RMS component of case 12 clustered together with the seminomas, whereas most remaining anaplastic/aggressive and 
conventional STs comprised a separate cluster (Figure 1). Interestingly, both the RMS component of case 12 and case 6 had 
evidence of +12p.

Background: Nonlinear microscopy (NLM) is a laser scanning microscopy technique that generates images of fresh or fixed 
tissues closely resembling paraffin-embedded H&E, but without the need for fixation, embedding, microtome sectioning, or slide 
preparation. NLM has been successfully utilized to evaluate bone, bone marrow, lymph nodes, skin, prostate, and breast tissue. 
The ability of NLM to characterize kidney tumors has not been previously examined. 
Design: Fresh or formalin-fixed tissues from kidney tumors, not required for clinical assessment, were evaluated. Tissue slices 
were stained for 2 minutes with acridine orange to highlight the nuclei and sulforhodamine 101 to highlight the stoma and 
cytoplasm, followed by a 30-second saline rinse. Real-time evaluation of the tissue was performed with NLM and subsequently 
compared with standard paraffin-embedded H&E histology. 
Results: We evaluated 103 tissue samples from partial or total nephrectomies with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), including clear cell 
RCC (International Society of Urologic Pathologists [ISUP] low grade and high grade), papillary RCC, chromophobe RCC, clear cell 
papillary RCC, oncocytoma, and oncocytic renal cell neoplasms. Figure 1 shows representative NLM images of normal kidney 
parenchyma illustrating glomeruli, tubules, arteries, and inflammatory cells. Figure 2 shows representative NLM images of RCC.

The low-grade clear cell RCC exhibited nested groups of cells with clear cytoplasm and a delicate capillary network. In contrast, 
rhabdoid cells and giant multinucleated tumor cells were identified on the high-grade clear cell RCC. The papillary RCC showed 
basophilic cuboidal cells and foamy macrophages. The chromophobe demonstrated cells with clear cytoplasm, distinct cell 
membrane, perinuclear halos, nuclear grooves, and raisinoid nuclei; additionally, cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm were observed. 
The clear cell papillary RCC displayed a tubular and papillary pattern.

Conclusions: NLM enables rapid assessment of kidney tissue for the presence of RCC and characterization of RCC subtypes. 
Possible future applications include the use of NLM to diagnose RCC, rapid adequacy assessment of targeted kidney biopsies for 
the presence of tumor, and collection of fresh viable tumor tissue and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for molecular studies.

Background: Nonlinear microscopy (NLM) is a laser scanning microscopy technique that generates real-time images and optical 
serial sections closely resembling paraffin-embedded H&E, but without the need for fixation, embedding, microtome sectioning, or 
slide preparation. NLM has been successfully utilized to evaluate bone, bone marrow, lymph nodes, skin, prostate, and breast 
tissue. The ability of NLM to characterize testicular parenchyma and tumors has not been previously examined. 
Design: Testicular tissues, not required for clinical assessment, were stained for 2 minutes with acridine orange (nuclear features) 
and sulforhodamine 101 (stomal and cytoplasmic features) followed by a 30-second saline rinse. The tissue slices were evaluated 
in real-time using NLM. Subsequently, the images were compared to the standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded H&E 
histology. 
Results: The study included 18 samples from radical orchiectomies including normal parenchyma and mixed germ cell tumors. 
NLM allows novel appreciation of seminiferous tubules and interstitial tissues. The normal cellular components of the seminiferous 
tubules can be recognized and the tunica propria constituents become distinct. Leydig cells and crystalloids of Reinke could be 
defined and examined by optical serial sections. Intratubular germ cell neoplasia was distinctive. The large pleomorphic cells with 
prominent nuclei and nucleoli with a high mitotic count characteristic of embryonal carcinoma were easily visualized. The usual 
features of yolk sac carcinoma were delineated. Multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts were seen in choriocarcinoma, confirmed by 
immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue. Seminomatous tissue was characterized by cells with monomorphic large 
nuclei admixed with lymphocytes.

Background: After radical cystectomy, approximately 50% of patients with high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC) experience 
recurrence, with more than 80% of them relapsing within 2 years (fast relapse) [1]. The tumor immune microenvironment is 
increasingly relevant for predicting response to therapy and prognostication. We investigated the relationship between fast relapse 
and the immune-cell count using machine learning (ML) methodology. 
Design: From a retrospective cohort of 209 HGUC patients post-cystectomy, we created tissue microarrays of triplicate 1-mm-
cores. Adjacent sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and with CD3 and CD20 antibodies. We 1) used a 
pretrained model (HoverNet [2]) to identify and quantify the count of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) on H&E images, then 2) 
re-trained the model with our internal immunohistochemistry (IHC) dataset of acute myeloid leukemia to identify and count the 
CD3+ cells on CD3 IHC images. For reference, cell counts were manually evaluated by the pathologist at the hotspot region-of-
interest.  Spearman correlation was used to evaluate ranking of automated counting against the manual cell counts for: 1) TIL 
counts from H&E vs. the sum of CD3 and CD20 manual counts on IHC (an approximation of TIL counts), 2) automated vs. manual 
CD3+ counts on IHC. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to assess the patient outcome of fast relapse within 2 years with a 
subset of 96 cases, after removing cases having incomplete follow-up/cell count scores, and pT1 cases. 
Results: We observed high Spearman correlations for CD3 IHC (RS=0.84) and H&E (RS=0.80) images, between manual and our 
ML-based automated counting technique. In the fast relapse analysis, there were significant differences in the cell counts from the 
automatic system between patients with fast recurrence (71) vs. not (25) with a p value of 0.006 and U value of 583.0 on CD3 IHC 
images, and a p value of 0.009 and U value of 603.0 on the H&E images. Significant difference was also reported using manual 
estimated CD3+ cell count on IHC with a p value of 0.017 and U value of 548.5.

Conclusions: Our machine learning based methods demonstrated the feasibility of automatically quantifying CD3+ cells on IHC

Background: While the Gleason Grading system is the primary prognostic feature in prostate cancer, it’s subjective nature 
underestimates tumor heterogeneity and suffers from poor inter-reader agreement. The objective of this work was to develop 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for detection and grading of prostate cancer and investigate quantitative correlation with 
recurrence interval after Radical prostatectomy (RP).  
Design: Digital pathology slides from patients previously undergoing RP at three institutions were retrospectively collected. 
Pathologist-defined Gleason score and recurrence-free survival (RFS) defined as time from surgery to biochemical or clinical 
evidence of recurrent disease was recorded, when available. Data were supplemented with publicly available PANDAS challenge 
set. A detection algorithm was trained using MobileNetV3 on image tiles corresponding to 0.5mmx0.5mm at 10x was trained 
(validation loss = 0.275629) from 6551 slides from biopsy (6210 PANDAS) and RP (69 Center1, 148 Center2, 124 Center3). Multi-
label Gleason classification was trained using ResNet50 on identical size tiles using 6326 slides from biopsy (6098 PANDAS) and 
RP (149 Center2, 81 Center3). An additional 246 slides from 152 patients were reserved for testing cascaded detection and 
grading algorithms (Fig1). Kaplan-Meier and Cox-Proportional Hazard Regression were used to compare pathologist scoring to 
quantitative AI outputs with RFS. 
Results: In 197 slides from Center3 in the testing set, detection performance based on individual tumors (n=144) and individual 
foci across all tumors (n=593), achieving 94.7% and 92.7% Sensitivity, respectively, with median 13 (range 0-50) false positives per 
slide. In cancer grading, artificially forcing grade heterogeneity in training patches, i.e. “cut-mix”, improved generalizability to test set 
and the final model achieved a patch-based mean F1 score of 0.74.  Of test patients with available RFS information from Center3 
(Table 1), quantitative burden of AI-predicted Gleason 4 and Gleason 5 resulted in significant association to RFS (AI-Gls4 
HR=1.5[1.1-2.0];p=0.004, AI-Gls5 HR=1.5[1.1-2.1];p=0.021). Unsupervised clustering of AI grading outputs resulted in improved 
patient RFS stratification compared to traditional scoring (Fig 2).

752   PAX-8 Based Machine Learning Nuclear Model Better Stratifies Nuclear Grade in Clear Cell 
Renal Cell Carcinoma

Background: Grading of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been recognized as a prognostic factor for decades. Fuhrman and the 
current grading system adopted formally by the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) and subsequently by the World 
Health Organization (WHO) is based upon nucleolar prominence for grades 1-3, while grade 4 requires nuclear anaplasia 
(including tumor giant cells, sarcomatoid differentiation and/or rhabdoid morphology). This gradings is subjective and can be 
challenging for non-genitourinary trained pathologists. Automated computational algorithms have been developed to grade the 
tumor using nuclear segmentation, but inevitably include non-neoplastic cells such as endothelial cells or lymphocytes. 
Design: Digitalized hemoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained tissue microarrays (TMAs) sections of clear cell RCC and corresponding 
de-stained PAX-8 immunohistochemistry were utilized to develop the model. All cell nuclei (blue in Figure 1) were segmented from 
H&E slides using a convolutional neural network U-Net. Neoplastic nuclei (orange in Figure 1) were localized using PAX-8 images 
using the thresholding algorithm from QuPath. H&E slides and PAX-8 slides were co-localized and all nuclei were registered and 
classified as neoplastic or non-neoplastic. Thirty-seven morphological (8), intensity (16) and texture (13) features were extracted 
from 231 H&E 256x256-pixel image patches were generated. Two classifier models, random forest (RF) and support vector 
 
  
 
S741 
machine (SVM), were applied to correlate nuclear features with the WHO/ISUP grades. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) 
curves were plotted to compared WHO/ISUP grades rendered by 2 trained pathologists and the classifier models. 
Results: Area under the curve (AUC) for the RF classifier model for each tumor grade is 0.988, 0.976, 0.988 and 0.989 
respectively. AUC for SVM classifier model is lower for grade 1-3 tumor (0.960, 0.890 and 0.905 respectively) and 0.994 for grade 
4 tumor (Figure 2). PAX-8 guided nuclear segmentation overall improves grade effect by excluding smaller non-neoplastic nuclei 
that tend to bias more on the high grade (3 & 4) tumor cells. In the RF model, nuclei morphological, intensity and texture features 
contribute 53.2%, 26.9% and 20.0% respectively to the final tumor grade (Table 1).

Disclosures: David Henriquez Ticas: None; Rajen Goyal: None; Maria Tretiakova: None 
Background: Cytokeratin 20 (CK20) is a structural protein predominantly expressed in epithelial cells of the gastric and intestinal 
mucosa. This protein is generally negative in renal cell carcinomas (RCC), except for eosinophilic solid and cystic renal cell 
carcinoma (ESC-RCC). Herein we report a series of non-ESC-RCC cases with CK20 expression. 
Design: We retrospectively reviewed all RCC cases showing CK20 expression, excluding ESC-RCC cases, between 2008-2022. 
In addition, tissue microarrays with 259 renal tumors (133 clear cell RCC, 78 PRCC, 20 chromophobe RCC, 24 oncocytomas and 4 
collecting duct carcinomas) and 14 non-neoplastic kidneys were immunostained with CK20 as a control group. 
Results: Four CK20 positive non-ESC-RCC cases were identified; all cases are from males with a median age of 68 years (range 
47-78). Three specimens are radical nephrectomies presented as advanced stage disease, and one is a lung metastasis biopsy 
(table). Morphologic findings were heterogenous combining solid, alveolar, tubulopapillary, or biphasic morphology with nuclear 
grades 3 or 4. All cases were positive for PAX8 and CK20 (figure); 3 out of 4 cases additionally expressed melanocytic markers or 
cathepsin K. All cases were negative for TFE3, CK7, and CAIX. Molecular and/or cytogenetics studies were available for 3 of 4 
cases. Case 1 had copy number gain on chromosome 6p, including the TFEB locus, identified by chromosome genomic array 
testing (CGAT) and demonstrated TFEB (6p21.1) amplification, identified by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and RNA-
ISH. Case 2 had on CGAT demonstrated complex copy number alterations with allelic imbalances of chromosomes 6 and 17 
harboring TFEB and KRT20 loci, but without amplification. Case 3 did not have cytogenetic studies available, however, 
demonstrated positive staining for 2 melanocytic markers, suspicious for a TFEB-amplified RCC phenotype. Case 4 had TFEB 
(6p21.1) amplification by FISH. None of other 259 renal tumors or 14 benign kidneys from tissue microarrays were positive for 
CK20.

Conclusions: Our findings highlight CK20 expression in a subset of aggressive tumors which were either molecularly proven or 
highly suspicious for TFEB-amplification RCC. Thus, we postulate that CK20 could serve as a potential marker for this recently 
described entity and may indicate a more aggressive RCC presentation. 
 
754   Accuracy of Gleason Grading of Prostatic Adenocarcinoma in Community Practice

Disclosures: Jake Hill: None; Ameer Hamza: None 
Background: Gleason grading in prostatic adenocarcinoma is the most important factor in disease management and prognosis. 
However, in the community practice setting, the grading is not always accurate. The objective of this study is to identify Gleason 
Grade discrepancies in prostate biopsy specimens received at our institution for a second opinion. 
Design: Prostate biopsy specimens from outside institutions that were reviewed at our institution between July 1, 2020 and June 
30, 2022 were included in this study. In total, 92 specimens were identified, and in-house and outside pathology reports were 
reviewed. Mischaracterization of any single core was considered a discrepancy. Discrepancies were stratified based on number of 
discrepant cores, incorrect benign versus malignant categorization, including high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), 
Gleason score and Grade Group discrepancies, and highest Grade Group discrepancy in an entire case. 
Results: Of the 92 cases identified, 55 had discrepancies. The number of discrepant cores in a given case ranged from 1 to 12; 
summarized in Figure 1. In nine cases, at least one core was found to be discrepant based on the misclassification of the sample 
as benign versus malignant; in seven cases malignancy was missed and in two cases it was over-called. A difference of one Grade 
Group was present in 38 cases with 29 over-calls and 9 under-calls. Seventeen of these single Grade Group discrepancies were 
cases of Grade Group 1 versus 2. In 11 of the cases, at least one core was incorrectly identified by the outside institution as Grade 
Group 2, when it was Grade Group 1; in six of these cases, the outside institution under-called the Grade Group. Discrepancy by a 
difference of two Grade Groups was present in nine cases; eight over-calls and one under-call. Discrepancy by a difference of 
three Grade Groups was found in four cases, all of which were over-called. In 17 cases, at least one core was found to be 
discrepant based on the diagnosis of HGPIN versus benign prostate; in 16 cases HGPIN was over-called and in one it was under-
called. 
 
  
 
S744 
Figure 1 - 754 
 
Conclusions: A high proportion (60%) of cases had discrepancies. These discrepancies, especially that of Grade Group 1 versus 
Grade Group 2, can potentially lead to over- or under-treatment. This highlights the need for further training in the diagnosis and 
grading of prostate adenocarcinoma in the community practice setting.  
 
755   Diagnostic Discrepancies in Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor Specimens

Disclosures: Jake Hill: None; Ameer Hamza: None 
Background: Transurethral resection of bladder tumor is a common surgical pathology specimen. However, evaluation by non-
subspeciality trained pathologists often results in diagnostic  discrepancies. The objective of this study is to identify and classify 
discrepancies in urothelial carcinoma diagnoses made by pathologists at an academic institution versus pathologists in the 
community setting. 
Design: The outside urothelial carcinoma cases reviewed at our institution between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2022 were included 
in the study. A total 337 specimens were identified.  Both the inhouse and outside pathology reports were reviewed. Discrepancies 
were classified as major or minor. Major discrepancies included change from a benign to malignant category and vice versa; over 
and under calling of muscle (muscularis propia) invasive disease and incorrect tumor classification. Minor discrepancies included 
discrepancy in tumor grade, non-recognition of variant histology and lymphovascular invasion and stage discrepancies including 
pTis, pTa and pT1. 
Results: Of the 337 specimens, diagnostic discrepancies were identified in 61 (18%) specimens. Among these 43 were classified 
as minor and 18 as major. Major discrepancies included 11 specimens with overcalling of muscularis propria invasion; three cases 
of prostatic adenocarcinoma being called urothelial carcinoma; two cases of urothelial carcinoma with squamous differentiation 
being called squamous cell carcinoma; one case of urothelial carcinoma with small tubules being called nephrogenic adenoma; and 
one case of a polypoid cystitis with exuberant von Bruns nests being called high-grade urothelial carcinoma. Minor discrepancies 
included inability to recognize variant histology in 25 specimens. Of these 10 had micropapillary, seven had plasmacytoid, four had 
nested, two had neuroendocrine, one had squamous, and one had glandular differentiation. Other minor discrepancies included 
discrepancy of histology grade i.e., low versus high grade in 13 specimens (eight over-calls and five under-calls), staging 
discrepancy up to pT1 in four specimens and inability to recognize lymphovascular invasion in one specimen. 
 
  
 
S745 
Figure 1 - 755 
 
Conclusions: Over and under calling of muscle invasive disease, wrong tumor classification and inability to recognize aggressive 
variants of urothelial carcinoma can potentially lead to inappropriate management. Diagnostic discrepancy in a considerable 
proportion of a common surgical pathology specimen indicates the need for subspecialized training.

Background: Patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) metastases have poor prognoses even with adjuvant therapies. 
Studies have shown that T-cells and macrophages are the primary tumor-infiltrating immune cells that target antigenic tumor cells 
in the renal tumor microenvironment. The robustness of this response could predict clinical response to immune checkpoint 
inhibitor treatment. Large scale gene-sequencing studies have identified several driver genes beyond VHL in ccRCC. These genes 
encode for subunits of the SWI/SNF remodeling complex, including PBRM1, BAP1, ARID1A, SETD2, SMARCA4 (BRG1), and 
SMARCA2 (BRM). We hypothesized that the loss of SWI/SNF subunit protein expression may impact tumor-infiltrating T-cells in 
the ccRCC microenvironment. 
Design: A tumor tissue microarray (TMA) of 160 ccRCC cases was used in this study. 4 different areas were analyzed for each 
tumor. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) quantification was performed to analyze expression of PBRM1, BAP1, ARID1A, SETD2, 
BRG1, and BRM(p). A dual-color IHC protocol was developed for evaluation of intratumoral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells (Fig 1). 
Clinical and pathologic features were obtained through electronic medical records. One-way ANOVA, paired t-test, and Pearson 
correlation were used for statistical analyses. 
Results: There was a statistically significant association between ccRCC stage and expression of PBRM1, BAP1, BRM(p), BRG1, 
and SetD2 (P all<0.05), but not ARID1A (P=0.273). The number of intratumoral CD4+ T-cells in stage 4 ccRCC was significantly 
higher than in stage 1 (P=0.002), but no significant difference occurred for CD8+ T-cells. Interestingly, intratumoral infiltrations of 
both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were significantly increased in tumors that had loss of PBRM1 and BAP1. However, this was only 
observed in stage 1 vs. stage 4 tumors (P all<0.05) (Fig 2). There was no correlation between loss of expression of SWI/SNF 
complex proteins and T cell infiltration when stratified by stage.

Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that loss expression of PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2, BRG1, and BRM(p) was significantly 
associated with ccRCC tumor stage. A significant increase in infiltrating CD4+ T-cells was present in more advanced stage ccRCC. 
CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were significantly increased in PBRM1- and BAP1-mutated ccRCC in early stage ccRCC, indicating they 
may play an important role in tumor microenvironment and progression. Our results provide important information that may help 
predict response to immune checkpoint blockade.

Background: SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) cancer registry data are utilized by numerous prostate cancer 
epidemiologic studies, and clinical data on tumor characteristics are based on pathology reports abstracted by hospitals and 
reported to cancer registries. These variables include tumor grade (Gleason score) and stage which are critical for risk models 
developed in these analyses. However, few prior studies have evaluated the accuracy of reporting pathology data originating from 
multiple institutions. We leveraged the ongoing RESPOND study of prostate cancer in 1400 African-American men to examine the 
concordance between the pathology variables recorded in cancer registries and the original pathology report re-examined by a 
centralized review. 
Design: Pathology reports from needle biopsies (n=698) and radical prostatectomies (n=697) from men diagnosed from 2010-2019 
and enrolled in the RESPOND study were sent to Johns Hopkins by registries in 6 states (GA, TX, NJ, LA, CA, and MI) for central 
review. A pathologist at JHU re-reviewed each pathology report to extract the Gleason Grade Group and T-stage, and these data 
were compared to data initially reported by hospital registrars to the respective cancer registries for each patient. 
Results: Registry tumor grade data was available for 94% (659/698) of prostate needle biopsies and 82% (571/697) of radical 
prostatectomy samples. Among needle biopsies with registry grade available, there was agreement between the re-review of the 
pathology report with the original reported variable in 91% of available cases, with κ= 0.881. Among radical prostatectomies with 
registry grade available, there was agreement with the original pathology report in 94% of cases, with κ= 0.907. Registry pT stage 
data was available for 77% (429/557) of radical prostatectomy samples, and there was concordance with the original pathology 
report in 98% of cases, corresponding to κ=0.951. 
Conclusions: There is high concordance between the centralized pathology report review and pathology grade and stage 
information originally recorded in cancer registries. Grade discordances may be due to multiple independent biopsies obtained in 
patients undergoing active surveillance, misinterpretation of pathology reports containing multiple needle cores, or input errors. As 
cancer registry data elements and grading and staging systems evolve over time, studies to examine accuracy are especially 
valuable given the widespread utilization of SEER data in epidemiologic studies.

Background: Cribriform (CB) histology and intraductal carcinoma of prostate (IDC-P) are important morphologic correlates of 
prostate cancer (PC) harboring mutations in the genes involved in homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway leading to high 
genomic instability. Recently, revised clinical guidelines from the NCCN have recommended genetic testing for all PC patients with 
an IDC-P or CB histology. Paucity of literature from the Indian perspective prompted us to correlate CB and IDC-P histology with 
HRR mutations and the common genes altered.  
Design: Specimens from 78 advanced metastatic castrate resistant PC (mCRPC) patients were studied for HRR gene somatic and 
germline mutations referred from Uro-oncologists. The complete coding region and splice junctions of HRR pathway genes 
including ATM, MRE11, BARD1, NBN, BRCA1, PALB2, BRCA2, PPP2R2A, BRIP1, RAD51B, CDK12, RAD54L, CHEK2, TP53, 
FANCD2, RAD51C and RAD51D were sequenced by next generation sequencing on Illumina sequencing platform at ≥1000X 
mean depth and HRR mutations were analyzed for association with CB histology and IDC-P.  
Results: HRR somatic mutation was seen in 25 of 78 patients (32.1%). The age ranged from 50 to 81 years with a mean age of 
66.1. Of the positive patients, somatic testing was performed on the prostate biopsy in 20 and on the metastatic biopsy in 5 
patients. Various mutations noticed 
were: TP53 (n=12;48%), ATM (n=6;24%), BRCA2 (n=4;16%), PALB2 (n=3;12%), RAD51D, CDK12, and BRIP1 (n=1 each;4%). 
Nine, 8 and 3 patients (80%) had both CB and IDC-P, isolated CB pattern 4 and isolated IDC-P histologies, respectively (Figure 1). 
The prevalence of HRR mutation was 11 (44%), 4 (16%) and 2 (8%) for Gleason score 9, 8 and 7 and grade groups 5, 4 and 3 
tumors, respectively (Table 1). Genomic abnormalities detected in the tumors are described in Figure 2. None of these patients had 
germline genomic abnormality.

Conclusions: This is the first Indian study to highlight the relationship between CB and IDC-P histology with HRR mutation. The 
prevalence of HRR mutation in this study is similar to the West (32.1% versus 34%). ATM, BRCA2 and TP53 were the common 
mutations detected. There is a higher prevalence of HRR mutations in mCRPC with CB/IDC-P histology as compared to West 
(80% versus 40% from the West). The mutations were more prevalent in Group grade 5 tumors. However, further studies with large 
cohort of patients is warranted to substantiate our observations.

Background: The accurate assessment of tumor purity is essential for diagnostic molecular testing. The tumor purity is defined as 
the proportion of tumor cells in a tumor tissue, which usually consists not only tumor cells but also non-tumor cells such as stromal 
cells and inflammatory cells. Although manual counting by pathologists is gold-standard currently, the tumor purity estimation is 
tedious, time consuming process and suffers from high interobserver variability. We aimed to find an accurate and easy-to-
use artificial intelligence (AI)-based method for the tumor purity assessment of bladder cancer. 
Design: Among 245 bladder cancer cases tested for next generation sequencing in our institution, we carefully selected six cases, 
of which tumor purity estimation was extremely difficult due to extensive inflammatory cell infiltration, severe stromal desmoplastic 
reaction, sarcomatoid dedifferentiation, or divergent differentiation. A tissue-microarray construct (TMA) was generated from tumor 
tissues of the six cases and used for multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) with pan-cytokeratin, alpha-SMA and CD45 
antibodies, which were representing tumor cells, mesenchymal cells, and lymphocytes, respectively. Based on the tumor purity 
assessed by the mIHC as reference value, the performance of five pathologists and seven AI-based deep learning models, 
EfficeintNetB0 to EfficientNetB6, were examined on 34 regions of interest in the TMA tissue. Interclass correlation coefficients 
(ICC) was used to demonstrate the reliability to the reference value of the mIHC.  
Results: As shown in the Figure, the pathologists showed relatively poor reliability and wide range of interobserver variability (ICC 
range, 0.31 – 0.48). In contrast, the EfficientNet models showed moderate reliability, among which the highest ICC was 0.69 (95% 
CI, 0.48, 0.83) from EfficientNet B1. The EfficientNetB1 showed 85.0% of accuracy, 85.2 % of sensitivity, 94.2% of specificity, 88.5 
of F1-score, and 0.95 of area under ROC.

Figure 1 - 759 
 
Conclusions: These results demonstrate that AI-based deep learning models assessed tumor purity more accurately than 
pathologists in extremely difficult bladder cancer cases. Therefore, the AI-based models could be a useful tool for pathologists to 
better estimate tumor purity in the difficult cases and conventional urothelial carcinoma cases with minor adjustment.

Background: Succinate dehydrogenase-deficient renal cell carcinomas (SDH RCC) are defined as RCC’s with mutations in SDH 
subunits, and are known to have an association with hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndrome and gastrointestinal 
stromal tumors in most cases. Herein we report the distinctive features that characterize the rarely reported and seemingly higher-
grade SDHA RCC via the morphologic, immunohistochemical (IHC) and molecular analysis of 5 tumors. 
Design: Morphologic and IHC features were examined in all 5 cases, including SDHB and SDHA IHC. Molecular analysis via next-
generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on 4/5 cases including 2 metastatic tissue samples. 
Results: The findings are summarized in the Table 1. 
• Five kidney tumors were identified (4 by NGS, 1 by IHC) with a patient median age of 40 years and a male predominance 
(4M:1F) 
• Morphologic features included areas with solid growth (75%), nests (100%), papillae (100%), cysts (25%), 
eosinophilic/flocculent cytoplasm (100%), cytoplasmic vacuoles with inclusions (75%), and nuclear grooves (25%) 
• 4/5 tumors were reported as high grade (ISUP/WHO nuclear grade 3) (the core biopsy was not graded) with desmoplastic 
stromal changes and a mixed inflammatory response 
• The metastatic tumors showed a predominantly nested growth pattern 
• All primary tumors were stained with SDHB IHC with 4/5 (80%) showing loss of expression while SDHA IHC showed loss of 
expression in 3/5 (60%) of cases

Figure 1 - 760 
 
Figure 2 - 760 
 
Conclusions: The histologic spectrum of SDHA RCC ranges from classic low-grade SDH morphology to heterogenous high grade 
features and brisk inflammation. SDHA RCC should be included in the differential diagnosis of RCCs with high grade features. 
SDHA IHC should be subsequently performed on all cases that show SDHB loss on IHC. In case #1, the SDHA IHC showed 
retained staining which may be explained by the presence of a dysfunctional protein and in case #2, the SDHB IHC is retained 
possibly due to a truncating mutation; both cases will need further evaluation. Request NGS on RCC, NOS with papillary and CDC-
like morphology, especially as SHDA IHC can be retained in cases with SDHA mutation. With 2/5 (40%) patients dead of disease 
and one with extensive metastasis, SDHA RCC should be considered an aggressive RCC subtype. Compared to most SDHB RCC, 
it appears that the rare SDHA RCC is a high-grade tumor with increased risk for metastatic disease and a worse overall prognosis.

Background: The fifth edition of the WHO classification (2022) has integrated a new category of molecularly defined renal 
tumors. The list includes TFE3-rearranged RCC, TFEB-rearranged RCC, ELOC (previously TCEB1)-mutated RCC, ALK-
rearranged RCC, fumarate hydratase-deficient RCC, SDH-deficient RCC, and SMARCB1-deficient RCC. Recognition and 
awareness of these entities are still evolving among pathologists and clinicians. 
Design: A survey instrument was shared among uropathologists using Survey Monkey software, and de-identified and anonymized 
respondent data were analyzed.  
 
  
 
S752 
Results: Seventy three participants completed the survey, of which 51% (n=37) were from North America, 29% (n=21) were from 
Asia, and remaining were from Europe and Australia. The majority were pathologists with at least 10 years of experience (n=45; 
62%), associated with a University or an academic centre (n=64; 88%), 5 of them handled >200 RCCs per month. The majority 
(n=52;71%) of participants reported difficult-to-classify renal neoplasms at least 2-5 times per month and 49% (n=36) reported 
seeing at least 2 molecularly-defined RCCs per month.  The principal reason for performing molecular work-up on RCC was a 
diagnostic clue or challenge by morphology / IHC. A majority (n=47; 64%) used specific IHC alone (n=30) or in conjunction with 
FISH for diagnosis of molecularly defined RCCs and were aware of characteristic morphology and essential diagnostic 
criteria. However, ELOC mutated RCC was not seen by one-third of respondents. Most common diagnostic techniques 
used were break-apart FISH probes (-for TFE3 / TFEB); NGS (for ELOC); IHC (for FH def, SDH def, ALK-rearranged, 
and SMARCB1-def RCC). A third of respondents believed that SDH testing should be performed for all oncocytic tumors 
irrespective of tumor grade or patient age. Most were not sure if WHO /ISUP grading was preferred or not in molecularly defined 
RCCs. Most commonly utilized IHC panel for diagnosis of molecularly defined RCCs included KRT7, CD117, SDH-B, FH, 2-SC, 
TFE3, TFEB, ALK, Melan A, HMB45, cathepsin K, SMARC-B1, & PAX8.  Only 60% had experience with cathepsin-K IHC (n=42). 
Papillary neoplasm with reverse polarity (n=51;70%) was the most accepted emerging molecularly defined RCC followed by EVT 
(eosinophilic vacuolated tumor).

Conclusions: Molecular testing is increasingly utilized, in conjunction with IHC as a surrogate for molecularly defined RCCs. 
Awareness and recognition of these entities are important for unequivocal genotype-phenotype correlation.

Background: Muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer (MIBC) is associated with limited response rates to systemic therapy 
leading to significant risk of recurrence and death. Tumor infiltrating immune cells have been described to be associates with 
patient’s outcome and response to chemotherapy. We aimed to profile the immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to 
predict prognosis in MIBC and responses to adjuvant chemotherapy. 
Design: We performed multiplex immunohistochemical (IHC) profiling and quantification of immune and stroma cells (CD3, CD4, 
CD8, CD163, FoxP3, PD1 and CD45, Vimentin, aSMA, PD-L1, Pancytokeratin, Ki67) in 101 patients with MIBC that received 
radical cystectomy. We used uni- and multivariate survival analyses to identify cell types that could predict prognosis. Samples 
were clustered into three K-means clusters for their Treg and macrophage infiltration: cluster 1: T-reg high, cluster 2: macrophage 
high, cluster 3: T-reg and macrophage low. Standardized CD68 and CD163 IHC was digitally analyzed with QuPath in an extended 
cohort of 141 MIBC patients. 
Results: High rates of macrophages were associated decreased overall survival probability (OS) (HR 10.9, 95%CI 2.8-40.5; 
p=0.0004) and high concentration of T-regs were associated with decreased risk of death (HR 0.1, 95%CI 0.01-0.7; p=0.03) in the 
multivariate Cox-regression model adjusting for adjusting for adjuvant chemotherapy, tumor and lymph node stage. Cluster 1 and 2 
both were rich in PD1 and PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells. Patients in the macrophage rich cluster (2) showed the 
 
  
 
S753 
poorest OS with and without adjuvant chemotherapy. High levels of the macrophage marker CD163 confirmed poorer prognosis in 
an extended MIBC cohort 
Conclusions: T-reg and macrophage rates in MIBC are independent predictors of prognosis and are important players in the 
tissue microenvironment. Standard IHC for macrophages (CD163) is feasible to predict prognosis but validation studies, especially 
to predict response to systemic therapies, are required.

Background: Cowden syndrome (CS) is the prototype of PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) and is most clearly 
associated with cancer predisposition. While rare and not generally a defining feature, patients with CS have a risk of developing 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The aim of this study was to assess the histopathologic spectrum and clinical behavior of renal tumors 
in patients with PHTS. 
Design: A multi-institutional collaborative study was conducted to obtain clinical and pathologic data on renal tumors arising in 
patients with PTHS, either diagnosed by germline mutational analysis or clinical criteria. Histologic sections of the renal tumors 
were re-reviewed to classify tumors under current WHO criteria. 
Results: Twelve renal tumors from 9 patients, 6 confirmed germline PTEN mutation and 3 clinically diagnosed as CS, were 
identified. One patient had 3 metachronous tumors, and one had 2. There were 4 males and 5 females, with mean age of 41.8 
years old (range 7-64 years old). The mean tumor size was 4.4 cm (range 0.5-10.2 cm). All 12 tumors were RCCs: 5 were classic 
chromophobe RCCs, 4 papillary RCCs, and 3 unclassified RCCs. Eleven of 12 tumors had available staging data (one was 
received fragmented): 7 (59%) pT1a, 2 pT1b (17%), 1 (8%) pT2a, 1 (8%) pT2b, and 1 (8%) pT3a. ISUP/WHO histologic grade was 
applicable in 7 (54%) tumors: 3 (43%) G1, 1 (14%) G2, 2 (28%) G3, and 1 (14%) G4. The grade 4 tumor was a pT1b unclassified 
RCC with rhabdoid differentiation. Three of 12 (one clear cell and two papillary RCCs) showed marked intratumoral and peritumoral 
lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. The average follow-up time was 67.8 months (13-172 months): 5 patients had no evidence of disease, 
2 were lost to follow up, 1 died of other cause/disease, and 1 patient had metastatic RCC to the lung (unclassified RCC with 
rhabdoid differentiation). 
Conclusions: Renal tumors associated with PHTS represent a heterogeneous group of RCCs with classic chromophobe RCC 
being the most common, followed by papillary RCC. In contrast to other hereditary renal neoplasia syndromes, morphologic 
features do not allow for identifying PHTS-associated neoplasia with any degree of specificity in the absence of clinical setting 
and/or prior history. The majority of PTHS-associated RCCs demonstrate a favorable clinical behavior. RCCs with unclassifiable 
morphology or renal tumor multifocality in young patients should raise suspicion for hereditary associated syndromes, and prompt 
appropriate genetic counseling.

Background: Extensive studies, including next generation sequencing, have established that TP53 and RB1 co-inactivation is a 
hallmark of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). This result has been translated to pathology practice:  IHC stains for TP53, RB1 and 
P16 are helpful supplemental diagnostic markers of SCLC.  Small cell carcinoma of the bladder (SCCB), the most common extra-
pulmonary small cell carcinoma, presents with identical morphology and immunohistochemical profile as SCLC. In contrast with 
SCLC, SCCB usually accompanies high grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC), metachronically or synchronically.  In the current 
study, we investigated TP53 and RB1 status in SCCB and its associated urothelial carcinoma by IHC staining. 
 
  
 
S754 
Design: We collected 20 consecutive SCCB cases from our institute between 2018 to 2022. The prior or concurrent HGUC for the 
SCCB cases were also included in this study. IHC stains for TP53, RB1 and P16 were performed on these SCCB and HGUC 
specimens. The mutation profile of TP53 and RB1 in HGUC was evaluated via cBioPortal database.  
Results: Among these 20 SCCB cases, 8 had prior or concurrent HGUC. We found that all 20 SCCB cases presented with a non-
wild type pattern for TP53 (either null or mutant pattern), complete RB1 protein loss, and diffuse and strongly positive P16 
staining.  All 8 prior or concurrent HGUC cases, except one (87.5%) showed concordant results with the corresponding SCCB. The 
remaining one HGUC showed mutant TP53 pattern, reduced (but intact) RB1 expression, and negative P16 (focal and weak 
pattern). Among 2769 urothelial carcinoma samples from the cBioPortal database, we identified 164 samples (5.9%) with co-
inactivation of TP53 and RB1. 
Conclusions: In summary, our data demonstrates that SCCB shares similar genetic features with SCLC: co-inactivation 
of TP53 and RB1. Interestingly, the urothelial carcinomas associated with SCCB also exhibited the same genetic features in 
majority of the cases (87.5%). In contrast, only 5.9% UC have the same genetic changes. This result indicates that other genetic 
and/or epigenetic alterations, in addition to co-inactivation of TP53 and RB1, are required for the progression of HGUC to small cell 
carcinoma bladder.  
 
765   Searching for “Borderline” Neuroendocrine Morphology in High Grade Prostatic 
Adenocarcinoma

Disclosures: Jung Woo Kwon: None; Gladell Paner: None 
Background: Prostatic adenocarcinoma has the potential to undergo neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation either in post-treatment 
or de novo settings. NE carcinomas (NEC), including small cell and large cell carcinomas, have poor prognosis and usually do not 
respond to hormonal therapy. Molecular evidence suggests that NEC arises via transdifferentiation from pre-existing usual prostatic 
adenocarcinoma. However, borderline phetotype that is in the midst of NE transdifferentiation has not been identified or studied. 
Herein, we attempt to identify non-typical NE cells that have immunophenotypic NE expression in high grade prostatic 
adenocarcinoma. 
Design: As baseline, 20 cases (8 RPs, 8 prostate biopsies, and 4 TURPs) of frank prostatic NECs were examined for areas with 
non-typical NE morphologies. 8 cases had areas of non-typical NE morphologies with positive synaptophysin expression adjacent 
to the frank NEC (Figures 1 [H&E] and 2 [synaptophysin]). Subsequently, 63 cases (43 RPs, 15 prostate biopsies, and 5 TURPs) of 
grade group 5 prostatic adenocarcinoma with no frank NE features were retrospectively searched for areas with similar 
morphologies, and immunohistochemically stained with synaptophysin. 
Results: In 63 cases of grade group 5 prostatic adenocarcinoma with no frank NE features, 25 (40%) contained foci with 
somewhat similar morphologies to non-typical NE morphologies seen adjacent to the frank prostatic NECs. These foci were 
subsequently stained with synaptophysin, and in 10 (16%) cases, positive synaptophysin expression was demonstrated (Table 1). 
These foci with non-typical NE morphologies usually had dense nuclear crowding. The nuclei usually showed prominent nucleoli in 
the background of granular chromatin. The tumor cells had ample cytoplasm, and often formed fused or cribriform gland patterns. 
Synaptophysin expression was typically patchy in these areas.

Conclusions: Non-typical NE morphologies with NE marker expression can be seen in grade group 5 prostatic adenocarcinoma. 
These morphologies overlap with the non-typical NE morphologies seen adjacent to frank prostatic NEC. These morphologies may 
represent the elusive “borderline” NE morphology depicting prostatic adenocarcinoma in the midst of NE transdifferentiation. 
Additional studies are underway to further characterize this "borderline" NE morphology and investigate its clinical relevance.

Background: The prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) in localized renal 
cell carcinoma (RCC) is unclear. This study investigated the prognostic impact of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and tertiary 
lymphoid structures (TLSs) on the recurrence and survival of patients with surgically treated RCC. 
Design: A total of 88 patients with ≥7cm pT3N0M0 RCC underwent complete surgical resection at a single institution with median 
follow-up 31 months (IQR 15-62). TIL presence (minimal, moderate, heavy) and TLS maturation (aggregate, primary follicle, 
secondary follicle) was graded using brightfield H&E slides according to previously published criteria. We categorized tumors into 
three groups: heavy inflammation with mature TLS (TIL+/TLS+, N=18), either heavy inflammation or mature TLS (TIL+ or TLS+, 
N=20), and neither heavy inflammation nor mature TLS (TIL-/TLS-, N=50). The prognostic impact of TIL and TLS on survival were 
analyzed using multivariable Cox regression adjusting for prognostic factors (sarcomatoid, rhabdoid, nuclear grade, and tumor 
size). Multivariable logistic regression evaluated these factors for associations with early (≤12 months) recurrence. 
Results: Most tumors (90%) were clear cell with median tumor size 9.5 cm (Table 1). Heavy presence of TILs was observed in 
41%. TLS were seen in 76%, of which 23% were mature. Presence of mature TLS was associated with reduced odds of early 
recurrence [OR 0.19 (95% CI 0.04-0.97) P=0.04] and presence of heavy TIL was associated with improved OS [HR 0.27 (95% 
0.09-0.82) P=0.02]. Tumors categorized as TIL-/TLS- were associated with a significantly worse OS [HR 3.6 (95% CI 1.2-
11), P=0.02] compared to tumors that had heavy TILs or mature TLS [ figure 1.]

for high-risk localized RCC tumors.  Further studies should validate these potential low-cost biomarkers. 
 
767   Immunohistochemistry for GPNMB in the Differential Diagnosis of Renal Cell Tumors with 
Clear Cell Morphology

Disclosures: Huili Li: None; Pedram Argani: None; Tamara Lotan: None; Victor Reuter: None; Andres Matoso: None 
Background: Renal cell tumor with clear cell morphology encompasses different tumor entities with various genetic alterations and 
prognoses, such as conventional clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), clear cell papillary renal cell tumor (CCPRCT), 
ELOC/TCEB1 mutated RCC, RCC with leiomyomatous stroma (TSC associated RCC). Besides high morphologic similarity, a 
subset of these tumors is also known to be diffusely positive CAIX and CK7 by immunohistochemistry. We have previously 
demonstrated diffusely strong GPNMB (glycoprotein nonmetastatic B) expression in TFE3/TFEB RCC and in TSC/mTOR 
alteration-associated renal tumors including eosinophilic solid and cystic renal cell carcinoma, low grade oncocytic tumor, and 
angiomyolipomas, while only focally weakly positive or negative in CCRCC and CCPRCT. In this study, we evaluated the utility of 
 
  
 
S757 
GPNMB immunostain in renal tumors with clear cell morphology that are also diffusely positive for CK7 and CAIX (CCPRCT, ELOC 
mutated RCC, and RCC with leiomyomatous stroma). 
Design: Immunohistochemical stains of CAIX, CK7 and CK903 and GPNMB were performed on whole sections of CCPRCT 
(n=7), molecularly confirmed ELOC mutated RCC (n=4), and RCC with leiomyomatous stroma (n=3 with one molecularly confirmed 
TSC mutant). 
Results: GPNMB immunostain was strong and diffusely positive in all three RCC with leiomyomatous stroma, weakly focally 
positive in (one of seven; 14%) of CCPRCT, and negative in ELOC mutated RCC.  CK903 immunostain is variably positive in most 
of CCPRCT (five of seven; 71%) and RCC with leiomyomatous stroma, but negative in all ELOC mutated RCC. CAIX and CK7 
immunostain were diffusely positive in all tested cases, except for one ELOC mutated RCC, which was negative for CK7. 
Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that positive CK903 and/or GPNMB immunostain in tumors with clear cell morphology 
and diffusely positive CK7 and CAIX immunostain excludes ELOC mutated RCC. Since both ELOC mutated RCC and TSC-
associated RCC with leiomyomatous stroma are morphologically very similar, positive GPNMB immunostain could confirm TSC-
associated tumor and exclude ELOC mutated RCC avoiding costly molecular testing. These findings should be confirmed with a 
larger cohort of cases.

Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/ultrasound targeted biopsy has been used together with the 12-core systematic 
biopsy for prostate cancer screenings in the past few years. However, the efficacy of targeted biopsy compared to systematic 
biopsy as well as its clinical-histological correlation has only been assessed by limited studies and is further investigated in this 
study. 
Design: We collected 960 cases with targeted and systematic prostate biopsies from 04/2019 to 04/2022. We compared cancer 
detection rates between targeted and systematic prostate biopsies in different grade groups. The correlations between the size of 
prostate lesions, PSA level, and PI-RADS scale using these two biopsy methods were also analyzed. 
Results: Among the 960 men who underwent targeted biopsy with systematic biopsy, prostatic adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 
652 (67.9%) cases. 489 (50.9%) cases were diagnosed by targeted biopsy and 576 (60.0%) cases were diagnosed by systematic 
biopsy (Table 1). In the 384 negative cases diagnosed by systemic biopsy, targeted biopsy identified cancer in 76 (19.8%) cases. 
Systemic biopsy was able to detect 163 cancer cases that were missed by targeted biopsy. Systematic biopsy detected more grade 
group 1 cancer compared to targeted biopsy. However, as the grade went higher, the differences between the cancer detection 
rates of targeted biopsy and systemic biopsy became negligible. Targeted biopsy upgraded the grade group (Figure 1) categorized 
by systemic biopsy (20.1%, 10.2%, 5.3%, and 5.7% in Grade Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, Table 1). Targeted biopsy was 
more likely to detect cancer in larger lesions (13.17mm VS 11.41mm, p=0.0056) and higher PI-RADS scales (4.19 VS 3.68, 
p<0.0001). The cancers detected by targeted biopsy also had higher PSA levels (10.38ng/ml VS 6.39ng/ml, p=0.0026) (Figure 2). 
 
 
  
 
S758 
Table 1. Gleason grade groups of each case identified by targeted biopsy were compared with systematic biopsy. Data in blue indicated 
concordance between targeted and systematic biopsy. Data in green showed that targeted biopsy detected new tumors or upgraded the grade 
groups compared to systematic biopsy. Data in yellow indicated that targeted biopsy downgraded the grade groups compared to the systematic 
biopsy. 
Figure 1 - 768 
 
Figure 2 - 768 
 
Conclusions: Targeted biopsy with systematic biopsy improved cancer detection rate compared with systemic biopsy alone. 
Targeted biopsy is not sensitive to grade group 1 cancer but is as sensitive as systemic biopsy in detecting higher-grade cancers. 
Targeted biopsy is more effective at detecting cancers when the patients have larger lesions, higher PI-RADS scales, and higher 
PSA levels.

Disclosures: Kristen Liu: None; Yan Hong (Shirley) Yu: None; Katherine Lajkosz: None; Theodorus Van Der Kwast: None;

Background: Dozens of studies have proven the adverse effect of cribriform (C) or intraductal (IDC) patterns of prostate cancer 
(PC) [PMID:28820750]. Recent evidence suggested adding C/IDC may significantly enhance the predictive power of the UCSF-
CAPRA and NCCN patient risk stratification nomograms [PMID:35676330], but its generalizability was uncertain.  
Design: We chose to focus on biopsy findings since that is the clinical decision point. Patient cohorts from 2 different countries 
(n=537 and n=612) were assessed for C/IDC presence in their biopsy. Biopsy CAPRA scores were grouped as 0-2, 3-5, and 6-10. 
NCCN scores were grouped as very low/low, favorable intermediate, unfavorable intermediate, and high/very high. All 
men underwent radical prostatectomy. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as a PSA >0.1 and Event-free survival (EFS) 
was defined as survival without nodal positivity /metastasis. Counted data were analyzed by chi-square or Fisher exact test; 
measured data by Kruskal-Wallis test. ANOVA was used to evaluate whether +/- C/IDC made a difference in model performance. 
The with/without C/IDC for lowest scores of CAPRA and NCCN were merged into 1 group due to small numbers.  
Results: Group 1 tended to have lower Gleason, CAPRA, and NCCN scores and less C/IDC than Group 2 (all p<0.001). The 
median follow-up was 4.0 years for Group 1 and 4.4 years for Group 2. For BCR-free survival with CAPRA, the addition of C/IDC 
status increased the c-index from 0.60 to 0.61, p=0.0871 in Group 1, and 0.66 to 0.71, p=0.0038 in Group 2. With NCCN, the 
addition of C/IDC increased the c-index from 0.57 to 0.60, p=0.0126 in Group 1, and from 0.62 to 0.68, p<0.001 in Group 2 (Table 
1). For EFS with CAPRA, the addition of C/IDC increased the c-index 0.60 to 0.63, p=0.03 in Group 1, and from 0.62 to 0.68, 
p=0.0038 for Group 2. With NCCN (Figure 1), the addition of C/IDC increased the c-index from 0.59 to 0.61, p=0.1396 for Group 1, 
but could not be evaluated in Group 2 due to insufficient number of events.

Conclusions: For both BCR and EFS, CAPRA discriminated better than NCCN did before adding C/IDC. For BCR, in both groups, 
adding C/IDC helped split the intermediate group of CAPRA. The effect was stronger in Group 1 than Group 2. There was 
more group separation in NCCN with Group 2 than Group 1. For EFS, the CAPRA 6-10 subset was split by adding C/IDC. NCCN 4 
and 5-6 were split, again with stronger effect in Group 2. Findings affirm the practical value of including C/IDC status in biopsy 
reporting.

Disclosures: Shuman Liu: None; Miriam Velazquez: None; Ryan Xiao: None; Brian Ma: None; Guang-Qian Xiao: None 
Background: Since the pre-immunohistochemistry (IHC) era, it has been assumed that classic neoplastic/malignant cribriform and 
comedonecrosis (comedo) prostatic lesions are stroma invasive prostatic carcinoma (PC) and graded as Gleason 4 and 5, 
respectively. Compared to non-cribriform pattern 4 PC, cribriform PC has recently been shown to have a more aggressive 
behavior, and cribriform morphology has been recommended to be included in the pathology report. No study has been done to 
evaluate the prevalence of peripheral basal cells (BCs) in these neoplastic patterns. 
Design: Classic neoplastic/malignant cribriform lesion is defined as cribriform glands lined with cytologic malignant cells spanning 
the lumen. In this study, cribriform was divided by size into small (≤normal gland size), medium (1-3 times normal gland size) and 
large cribriform (≥3 times normal gland size). Cases accessioned in the past 3 years at our hospital, contained at least 20% 
cribriform/comedo of tumor volume with or without glomeruloid pattern and with triple antibody PIN cocktail IHC performed, were 
reviewed for the presence of peripheral BCs. A total of 48 such cases (38 prostatectomies, 10 biopsies) were retrieved. 
Results: 38 cases contained small cribriforms, 39 contained medium-sized cribriforms, 23 contained large cribriforms and 18 had 
comedo. The number and % of cribriform/comedo cases with BCs only, no BCs at all, or mixtures of both with BCs and without BCs 
are summarized in Table 1. The locations of these lesions were variable. All 8 cases of glomeruloid PCa were absent of BCs.

Conclusions: The study showed the neoplastic/malignant cribriform/comedo lesions oftentimes contained BCs and, strictly 
speaking, were not stroma invasive PC. Small cribriforms were more likely to be invasive. Comedo lesions mostly contained 
peripheral BCs and none of the cases showed pure stroma invasive comedo only (i.e., complete absence of basal cells in all the 
comedo), though they could represent either the precursor lesions of PC or intraductal carcinoma. The findings may infer that small 
and large cribriforms and comedo be derived/progressed from the medium-sized cribriforms, and, overtime, some may eventually 
lose their BCs. There seems to be no location difference in the distribution of variably sized cribriforms and comedo 
lesions.  Glomeruloid pattern was always absent of BCs, stroma invasive and located in the peripheral zone. This suggests that 
glomeruloid PC may not be related to cribriform lesions.

Background: Genitourinary sarcomas comprise less than 2.7% of all sarcomas. Synovial sarcoma (SS) is an extremely rare 
genitourinary malignant mesenchymal neoplasm with variable epithelial differentiation and a specific SS18::SSX 1/2 gene 
fusion. The paratesticular location of this neoplasm, is even more rare with only a single case reported in literature till date. 
Paratesticular region contains various structures, including the epididymis, tunical layers, spermatic cord, and the surrounding 
supportive fat, muscular, and ligamentous tissues. Patients usually have a poor outcome, with metastases to the lung and/or other 
sites. Herein, we describe the clinicopathologic and molecular findings of paratesticular SS in the largest case series to date and to 
the best of our knowledge, the only series to use novel SS18-SSX antibody for immunohistochemistry (IHC).

Design: Paratesticular SS cases were identified from the anatomic pathology files of the collaborating institutions. 
Clinicopathologic, IHC, molecular, treatment, and follow-up data were analysed.  
Results: There were 8 patients, ranging from 15 years to 47 years (median 31 years) in age. The tumor size ranged from 4.0 cm to 
15.0 cm. Grossly, the tumors were solid and homogeneous tan-white, (n=8); with spindle cell morphology (Figure 1). SS18-SSX 
IHC was positive in all tumors (diffuse, n=5; multifocal, n=2; focal, n=1). All tumors harbored SS18::SSX1 gene rearrangement 
(Figure 2). All 8 tumors exhibited TLE1 immunoreactivity. Other positive immunostains included were CD99 (n=8/8) and BCL2 (n 
=7/7). NKX2.2, BCOR, and STAT6 immunostains were negative in 7/7 tumors. Surgical radical orchiectomy resections with high 
ligation of the spermatic cord were done for all. Metastases to liver, lymph nodes, brain, and lung (n=1); liver and lungs (n=1); liver 
(n=1) was identified. Adjuvant chemotherapy history was available in 6/8 patients. Follow-up was available for 6 patients (range: 5 
months to 24 months), 2 patients died of disease, and 4 patients are alive with no recurrence or metastasis. 
Figure 1 - 771 
 
Figure 2 - 771 
 
Conclusions: 1. Paratesticular SS is an extremely rare sarcoma of the paratestis with few reported contemporary case series; 
tumors have a poor prognosis with metastasis. 2. Patients with multiorgan metastasis have a more aggressive course and died due 
to disease. 3. SS18-SSX IHC shows excellent concordance with the FISH results, therefore may reliably be used as a molecular 
surrogate for paratesticular SS, particularly in a resource-limited setting.

Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is slowly but steadily being incorporated in the pathology practice. This was fueled by 
adoption of deep learning-based techniques, graphic processing units, and large-scale datasets. While the size of the datasets is 
extremely important, data accuracy is also essential. There is widespread use of whole slide images (WSI) from the Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) repository to build and/or assess the accuracy of AI-based models. We hypothesized the presence of 
potential diagnostic misclassifications in one of the TCGA's datasets. We conducted a morphologic review of the papillary renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC) dataset with documentation of microscopic findings, histology artifacts and identification of debatable diagnoses.  
Design: All WSIs from permanent slides (300) of the papillary RCC dataset from the TCGA portal 
(https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository) were reviewed by two pathologists. The following variables were documented: diagnosis, 
morphology consistency, architecture(s), percentage of solid areas, cytoplasm color and amount, necrosis, presence of foamy 
histiocytes within tumor stalks, hemosiderin inclusions, intratumoral blood, intratubular mucin, calcifications, non-tumoral elements 
in WSIs, and types of artifacts.  
Results: 16/300 WSIs were found to have potential diagnostic discrepancies – TFE3-rearranged RCC (1 WSI), papillary renal 
neoplasm with reverse polarity (4), metanephric adenoma (3), chromophobe RCC (2), urothelial carcinoma (2), fumarate 
hydratase-deficient RCC (3), and an oncocytic tumor/oncocytoma (1). See Figure 1 for examples. Other significant findings were 
WSIs with no tumor (1), necrosis in >99% of tissue (3), tumor in less than 1% of tissue (1), WSIs of immunostains only (3). See 
Table for summary of morphologic findings and artifacts.

Conclusions: Multiple WSIs with questionable diagnosis were found. Raising awareness about these WSIs would give 
researchers the opportunity to exclude them from some types of AI-model creation/data analysis workflows. Publication of 
morphologic findings and artifacts would enable subgroup analysis on the WSI-level. Dataset data accuracy is paramount for AI 
development. Therefore, morphologic review of public open-source datasets could minimize introduction of systemic errors in the 
literature.

Background: Nephrogenic adenoma (NA) is a benign proliferative lesion seen in the urinary bladder and other genitourinary sites. 
Its varied morphology (papillary, tubular, and signet ring cell) frequently causes diagnostic dilemmas in histology as both 
urothelial and prostatic carcinoma are the differential diagnoses. The literature cites renal tubular epithelial cell origin for NA despite 
its predominant lower genitourinary tract localization. The current diagnostic immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarkers: PAX-2, PAX-
8, and GATA3 used contextually neither address the lineage specificity nor describe the specific cell(s) of origin for NA. Hence 
refining biomarkers for NA is an unmet clinical need that we explore in this study. 
Design: Our recent single-cell sequencing study (PMID: 34099557) nominated lineage-specific markers for renal distal tubular 
(DCT) epithelial cells including L1CAM -for principal cells and, FOXI1/LINC01187- for intercalated cells of the kidney. To 
characterize the exact cellular lineage for NA, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of these markers. GATA3 was also 
interrogated since it is known to be enriched in DCT and collecting duct epithelium. A specialized tissue cohort comprising 12 NA, 
10 benign urothelial, 5 benign prostates, 5 prostatic, and 2 urothelial carcinomas was interrogated for L1CAM, GATA3, and FOXI1 
IHC and LINC01187 RNA in situ hybridization.  
Results: L1CAM was positive in all (12/12; 100%) NA with uniform diffuse strong to moderate membranous expression (average 
product score=203.6; and a range of 140 to 268), devoid of any intra-lesional heterogeneity. (Table-1 and Figure-1) Additionally, 
L1CAM showed no expression in either benign or malignant urothelial/prostatic samples. GATA3 expression was patchy and focal 
and seen in 7/12 (58.3%) NA cases and was expressed in 100% benign and malignant urothelium and prostate tissues (basal 
cells). Interestingly, the other predominant DCT intercalated cell-specific markers, FOXI1 and LINC01187, were found to be 
negative.

Conclusions: L1CAM, a marker for principal cells of the DCT, was uniformly expressed in NA, and negative in other relevant 
tissues (including prostatic and urothelial adenocarcinoma). The absence of intercalated cell markers (FOXI1/LINC01187) in NA 
provides additional evidence that the principal cells of DCT (and not intercalated cells) are a putative cell of origin for NA. Based on 
these findings, we demonstrate L1CAM as a potential diagnostic and lineage-specific biomarker for NA.

Background: Subtyping of papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is not recommended in the 2022 WHO classification. Currently, 
WHO/ISUP nuclear grade is the only prognostic marker for PRCC. ABCC2 is a transporter protein that localizes to the apical cell 
membranes of the proximal renal tubules. ABCC2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been shown to significantly 
predict outcome in PRCC (Hum. Pathol. 2022; 120: 57-70). In this study, we assess the prognostic significance of ABCC2 IHC 
staining patterns with correlation to the ABCC2 in situ transcript levels in a large multi-institutional PRCC cohort, and with focus on 
tumors of small size (pT1a; ≤4 cm). 
Design: A cohort comprising 254 PRCCs was collected from 6 institutions, along with corresponding clinicopathologic data. TMAs 
were constructed for 211 cases, and 43 cases were evaluated as whole slides. PRCC cases were stained for ABCC2 by IHC, and 
the results were stratified into: negative, cytoplasmic, brush border (BB) <50%, and BB ≥50%. RNA in-situ hybridization (ISH) for 
ABCC2 was performed in 65 cases. ISH slides were assessed quantitatively using the HALO™ software system. Statistical analysis 
was performed using GraphPad and SPSS software. 
Results: The distribution of ABCC2 IHC patterns was as follows: 77 (30%) negative, 72 (28%) cytoplasmic, 63 (25%) BB <50%, 
and 42 (17%) BB ≥50% (Figure 1). ABCC2 BB staining was associated with a significant increase in the RNA transcript levels, as 
compared to the negative/cytoplasmic group (p=0.0337). Higher ABCC2 expression (IHC BB patterns) was associated with worse 
disease free survival (DFS) on univariate analysis (p=0.0002) (Figure 2). Conversely, WHO/ISUP grade did not show a significant 
association with DFS (p=0.309) on univariate analysis. ABCC2 BB staining was also useful in stratifying the DFS in pT1a (≤4 cm) 
cases, n=120 (p=0.0002), while WHO/ISUP grade was not (p=0.324). Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, stage, grade and 
tumor size showed that only ABCC2 IHC patterns (p=0.003) and stage (p<0.001) had a DFS prognostic significance. 
 
 
  
 
S765 
Figure 1 - 774 
 
Figure 2 - 774 
 
Conclusions: ABCC2 BB expression by IHC in PRCC correlates with significantly higher gene expression. ABCC2 was also 
significant in predicting survival outcomes for PRCC on both univariate and multivariate analysis, and provided better prognostic 
stratification than the WHO/ISUP grade. Importantly, ABCC2 was useful for prognostic separation of small PRCC tumors (≤4 cm), 
which may guide active surveillance decisions in that group. 
 
775   The Importance of Recognizing Somatic FH-Deficient Renal Cell Carcinoma

Background: Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) is a hereditary cancer syndrome where affected 
individuals are predisposed to the development of leiomyomas in skin and uterus and aggressive forms of kidney cancer. Affected 
individuals harbor germline pathogenic mutations of the fumarate hydratase(FH) gene and tumors demonstrate loss of function of 
FH. Somatic FH-deficient RCC with somatic mutational inactivation of FH is not well recognized or described, which may lead to 
misdiagnosis that have great impact in the treatment of the patients. Herein, we report the clinical, morphological, and genetic 
findings of 7 patients with Somatic FH-deficient RCC 
Design: All patients had metastatic RCC disease when accepted on an IRB approved UOB/NCI protocol. Patients (4 males, 3 
females) ranged in age from 27 to 77 and all denied family history of RCC, skin lesions or uterine 
leiomyomas.  Clinical, morphological evaluation, IHC for FH and 2SC and Germline genetic testing was performed in all cases. 
Results: The tumors varied in size (4-10cm). The predominant morphologic pattern of the RCCs was extensive tubular formation 
with small tubules lined by cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and the characteristic nuclear features of HLRCC (large prominent 
nucleous with orangiophilic nucleoli and perinucleolar halos). Other tumors showed papillary formation and in two cases a cystic 
 
  
 
S766 
component was also present. The IHC staining for FH was negative confirming the non functional FH protein and 2SC was diffusely 
and strongly positive. However, none of the patients gave clinical history consistent with HLRCC.  Germline genetic testing was 
negative in all patients, but each tumor demonstrated pathogenic somatic mutations/alterations of FH, including point mutation, 
homozygous deletion of 1q43, multiple break points on chromosome 1, and loss of heterozygosity. 
Conclusions: Pathologists need to be aware that Somatic FH-deficient RCC that lack FH germline mutation can occur and have 
an aggressive behavior. Affected patients deny clinical features or family history usually associated with HLRCC 
syndrome.  Morphology and IHC are the key tools in highlighting this potential diagnosis.  Any high grade tumor with 
morphologic features similar to HLRCC and negative FH staining should raise suspicion and patients should be evaluated for both 
germline and somatic FH mutation to ensure proper diagnosis and that patients receive the correct targeted therapy for these 
highly malignant tumors.

Background: Bladder cancer accounts for more than 80,000 new cancer diagnoses and 17,000 deaths per year in the United 
States. Muscle invasive cancer portends a poor prognosis with high morbidity and mortality. In patients with metastatic disease, 
particularly those who cannot tolerate chemotherapy, immunotherapy is an approved and sometimes highly successful treatment 
option. However, certain patients have little to no therapeutic response and ongoing work is necessary to understand why. 
Design: A retrospective search of patients with advanced stage or metastatic bladder cancer was performed in our case database 
from 2012 to 2019. A retrospective chart and cBioPortal review was performed and 43 cases with sufficient clinical follow up were 
identified and reviewed. For two cases, imaging mass cytometry was performed to characterize immune cell populations in the 
tumors. 
Results: Of the 43 cases identified, 33 had molecular analysis of their tumors performed with 17 having whole exome sequencing. 
22 patients had long term progression free survival. Furthermore, 22 patients were identified that had documented treatment with 
immunotherapy targeting either PD-1, PDL-1, or CTLA-4. Of this cohort, 8 of 22 of these patients had sustained response to 
immunotherapy without radiological or pathologic evidence of recurrence. One of these cases had a PDL-1 CPS score <1 although 
demonstrated mismatch repair deficiency. There was no significant difference between patients who responded to therapy and 
those who did not in terms of sex, age, history of tobacco use, stage, positive nodal status, positive margins, or angiolymphatic 
invasion at resection. A significant difference was seen in that the patients who responded to immunotherapy had not received 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p=0.0419). No significant differences in mutations associated with better patient outcomes were seen 
although 3 of 3 patients with FGFR3 mutations had poor outcomes. Imaging mass cytometry revealed an inflamed phenotype in 
one of the patients with sustained immunotherapy response.

Figure 2 - 776 
 
Conclusions: While no significant differences in genomic phenotypes seem to be associated with outcome in sustained response 
to immunotherapy from these data, imaging mass cytometry may demonstrate clues to tumor microenvironmental differences 
which predict therapeutic response. Further work is required to elucidate which patients will have the best therapeutic response to 
immunotherapy in order to provide them with the most successful personalized care.

Background: ULGOREN of the kidney are a challenging subset of tumors. Despite the emergence of newer entities there is a 
group of oncocytic renal tumors that ultimately remain unclassified.  
 
  
 
S768 
Design: This multi-institutional study aims to investigate ULGOREN. Along with evaluation of histologic features, immunostains 
(IHC) Keratin 7, Keratin 20, CD 117, SDHB, FH/2SC, ALK-1, GATA3 and MIB-1 were performed to exclude an oncocytoma, 
chromophobe RCC (ChRCC), eosinophilic solid and cystic RCC (ESC RCC), low grade oncocytic tumors (LOT), SDH-deficient 
RCC (SDH RCC), low grade FH-deficient RCC (FHD RCC) and ALK-1 rearranged RCC (ALK RCC). Molecular evaluation using a 
targeted NGS-based panel to detect small nucleotide variants/substitutions, small indels (insertions and/or deletions), and copy 
number variations in 324 cancer associated genes (including genes involved in PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway) was performed on the 
Illumina® HiSeq 4000 platform. Molecular analysis was performed on fourteen tumors. 
Results: The results are in table 1. There were fourteen patients ranging from 35-68 yrs in age. A majority of the tumors showed 
no capsule with a well circumscribed architecture. The mixed histologic features consisted of compact and nested (LOT-
like), microcystic, tubular, trabeculated, sheets of tumor cells with ChRCC-like areas, as well as areas with fibromyxoid stroma that 
are oncocytoma-like. The nuclear grades were ISUP/WHO 2 (n=11) and 3 (n=3). The Keratin 7 and CD117 staining patterns are 
summarized in the table. MIB-1 index was low (2-5%). No necrosis, rhabdoid or sarcomatoid features were present. All other IHC 
(SDHB+ FH+/2SC- ALK1- Keratin 20-GATA3+/-) did not support other entities. Therefore, this subset was termed as ULGOREN. 
Genomic analyses revealed alterations in the TSC/MTOR pathway. Mutations were as follows: TSC2 (6), PIK3CA (4), MTOR (3), 
FOXI1(3),TSC1 (2),PTEN(1) and NF2(1). The types of mutations were nonsense, missense, splice acceptor, splice donor, 
frameshift and synonomous.

Conclusions: ULGOREN harbors frequent alterations in the TSC/MTOR pathway, thus expanding the morphologic spectrum of 
low grade oncocytic neoplasms to include such tumors with heterogenous histomorphology without diffuse Keratin 7 staining. It is 
critical to perform Keratin 7 and CD117 among other immunostains listed above. Given the commonality of involvement 
of TSC/MTOR pathway in LOT's as well as ULGOREN as described above, the morphologic spectrum of LOT could be expanded 
to include such tumors.

Background: ELOC (formerly TCEB1)-mutated renal cell carcinoma (ELOC-RCC) is a recently renamed molecularly defined RCC 
that harbors mutation in the elongin C(ELOC) gene at 8q21.11. These tumors are characterized by a nodular appearing low-grade 
clear cell neoplasm arranged in nests and tubules with prominent thick transecting smooth muscle and fibrous stroma and a distinct 
molecular signature. 
Design: Because of the rarity of this tumor, we performed a multi-institutional study to comprehend the overarching clinico-
pathologic, immunohistochemical (IHC), and molecular features of 11 patients with ELOC-mutated RCC (defined by morphological 
features and somatic ELOC mutation). 
Results: The patients' age ranged from 31-54 years (mean=41 years) with M:F::1:1.8. All patients presented with a solitary renal 
mass. None had family history or features of tuberous sclerosis(TS). All patients had pT1 disease(size range=1-3.8cm). The tumors 
showed classical gross and microscopy of ELOC-RCC. Other changes included focal papillae(2), lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate(1), 
foamy histiocytes and siderophages(2), collapsed acini(4). The non-neoplastic renal parenchyma lacked any features of TS. The 
tumors were CK7+(11)/CA9+(11)/PAX8+(11)/CD10+(11)/CAM5.2+(7)/AMACR+(3)/TFE3-/CathepsinK-/SDHB+/FH+/HMB45-/Ki-
67(1-7%). Desmin immunoreactivity in the smooth muscle component was observed (Figure 1). The table 1 and figure 2 show the 
somatic genomic alterations in the 11 patients. Germline testing in 5 patients did not reveal any genomic alteration. All patients 
were alive and without disease progression after a mean follow-up of 11.8 months (range=3-49 months).

Figure 2 - 778 
 
Conclusions: ELOC-mutated RCC is a distinct subtype of RCC with morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular 
characteristics distinct from clear cell RCC and clear cell papillary tumors as these tumors frequently harbors mutations in 
the ELOC gene and demonstrate recurrent mutations involving the TSC/MTOR pathway. Also, RCC with fibromyomatous stroma 
harboring TSC/MTOR alteration and/or ELOC mutation could be grouped together because of their overlapping morphology and 
CK7 positivity, despite the differing molecular alterations.

Background: Fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma (FHD RCC) represents a distinct morphologically characteristic 
high grade, aggressive neoplasm. Low- grade FHD RCC has also been described associated with and independent of hereditary 
leiomyomatosis-renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) syndrome.  
 
  
 
S771 
Design: This multi-institutional study aims to investigate unclassifiable low grade oncocytic tumors to identify low grade FHD 
RCC. Along with evaluation of histologic features, immunostains (IHC) Keratin 7, Keratin 20, CD 117, SDHB, FH/2SC, ALK-1, 
GATA3 and MIB-1 were performed. Molecular evaluation using targeted NGS-based panel to detect small nucleotide 
variants/substitutions, small indels (insertions and/or deletions), and copy number variations in 324 cancer associated genes 
(including genes involved in FH and PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway) on Illumina® HiSeq 4000 platform. Six tumors were identified on 
which molecular analysis was performed. 
Results: The results are in table 1. The mixed histologic features (see image 1.) ranged from solid nests, to microcystic, papillary, 
tubules and trabeculae with sheets of tumor cells some with Chromophobe RCC-like areas and areas with fibromyxoid stroma that 
are oncocytoma-like and some are Low grade oncocytic tumor-like. The nuclear grades were ISUP/WHO 2 (n=5) and 3 (n=1). The 
Keratin 7 is positive in 5/6 cases and ranges from focal to diffuse. The FH/2SC staining patterns are summarized in image 2. MIB-1 
index was low (2-8%). No necrosis, rhabdoid, sarcomatoid features were present. Most of the other IHC (SDHB+ ALK1- Keratin 20- 
GATA3+/-CD117+/-) appear to be inconsistent and unreliable. The FH is retained in 4 of 6 cases, of which 3 had diffuse and one 
had patchy weak-moderate staining (comprising 60% of tumor cells). The 2SC is diffuse with moderate intensity in all cases. 
Mutation in the FH gene were identified in all cases. The types of mutations included were nonsense, missense, frameshift and 
synonomous.

carcinoma of the kidney.

Figure 2 - 779 
 
Conclusions: 1. Low grade FHD RCC is a heterogeneous group of tumors. 2. Interestingly, a synonymous mutation (case # 1 
and 3) could lead to a defect in the FH protein folding and function without altering the encoded amino acid while a nonsense 
mutation (case # 2) could lead to the protein that is incomplete and shorter than the usual. These may likely explain the retention of 
FH staining in these cases. 3. It is critical that FH and 2SC be performed in conjunction. In equivocal cases, NGS may be needed 
to arrive at the right diagnosis.

Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a highly heterogeneous disease, and mortality is mainly due to metastases. However, the 
molecular underpinnings that lead to the initial steps of metastasis have not been well characterized. We performed transcriptome 
analysis of primary prostate tumor foci and corresponding lymph node metastases (LMN). 
Design: Primary tumor foci (PTF) and LNM from 40 patients with high-risk PCa were analyzed by RNAseq.  Two or more PTF and 
all available LNM greater than 0.4cm were subjected to sequencing.  Of these 40 patients, 17 (42.5%) had LNM and 23 (57.5%) 
had benign LNs. A total of 155 tissue samples (97 PTF, 39 benign LNs, and 19 LNM) were sequenced and mapped to the human 
transcriptome with STAR mapper after QC trimming and removal of adapter sequences using TrimGalore. Differentially expressed 
genes between PTF, LNM, and benign LNs were identified using DESeq2, and gene set enrichment analysis was performed using 
WebGestalt.   
Results: A median of 57 million paired-end reads were obtained per sample, with a median of 10 million total readcounts per 
sample across the transcriptome, and 39,021 transcripts were detected in at least 5% of samples. Comparing PTF to LNM, 6203 
transcripts were differentially expressed (p-adj < 0.01). PTF were enriched relative to LNM in gene sets associated with Wnt 
signaling, hormone signaling, Hippo signaling, KRAS signaling, and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Comparing PTF from 
metastatic patients to non-metastatic patients, 1265 transcripts were differentially expressed (p-adj < 0.01).  PTF from metastatic 
patients were enriched in gene sets associated with cell cycle progression, oxidative phosphorylation, ER stress, fatty acid 
metabolism, and DNA repair. LNM gene sets were enriched in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative phosphorylation. 
The top 500 upregulated genes in malignant tissues were significantly enriched in genes related to androgen and estrogen 
signaling as expected. We also identified a set of 193 genes whose expression was significantly increased in primary tumor over 
benign LNs and in LNM over primary tumors. This gene set was significantly enriched in genes related to oxidative phosphorylation 
and included oncogenes such as PIK3CB, NCOA2, and SCHLAP1.

Background: Despite histologic similarities between upper-tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) and urothelial carcinoma of the 
bladder (UCB), there are differences in the clonal types, mutations, and the immune landscape between these tumors.  Patients 
with concomitant UTUC and UCB present a unique platform to examine these differences. In this study, we performed multiplex 
spatial profiling of RNA on tumor samples from patients with concomitant UTUC and UCB to include tumor and tumor environment 
heterogeneity in the evaluation of the tumors using the GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiling platform. 
Design: Three patients with concomitant high grade non-invasive UTUC and UCB were identified. Six FFPE samples from 
cystectomy and nephroureterectomy for the three patients were identified. A pathologist selected 18 regions of interest (ROIs), 
including tumor, tumor-stroma interface, and stroma area on each specimen. Multiplex IHC was performed on each sample with 
stains for DNA, Pan-CK, CD20 (B cells), and CD45 (immunocytes). The GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiling platform was used to 
sequence the RNA from the ROIs on each FFPE slide. Chi-squared analysis was performed. 
Results: Multiplex IHC images demonstrated the increased infiltration of CD20 and CD45 immune cells in the UCB in compared to 
UTUC tumors; however, the proportion of inflammatory cells component (i.e. T-cells, B-cells, plasma cells, T-regulatory cells, 
macrophages) are similar in different ROIs within each tumor and in UCB and UTUC tumors in each patient and even in samples 
from same sites among all patients. From the 11000+ genes identified through GeoMx analysis, we identified the variable 
expression among UTUC and UCB samples. Notably, UNC5B, a gene that codes for a netrin receptor that is correlated with 
bladder cancer recurrence, was highly expressed in UCB. Additionally, UTUCs showed higher expression of histone regulatory 
genes (H1-3, H2BC5, H2BC8), which may lead to tumorigenesis and progression to muscle-invasive UC.

Figure 2 - 781 
 
Conclusions: UTUC demonstrates lower immune cells infiltration, consistent with previous UTUC studies; however, the proportion 
of inflammatory cells component is similar in different foci of the tumor and in concomitant UCB and UTUC tumors in each patient 
and even among all tumor samples from the same site. UNC5B, which has been associated with tumor recurrence, is highly 
expressed in UCB. UTUC patients showed higher expression of histone regulatory genes.

Background: Urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract (UTUC) exhibits notable differences in the prevalence of common 
genomic alterations compared to urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB). Similar to UCB, histologic subtypes of UTUC are 
associated with more advanced stage and poor survival. However, data is limited regarding the spectrum of genomic alterations 
and their association with morphologic subtypes. 
Design: Retrospective review was performed of nephroureterectomy specimens for UTUC with available molecular testing using 
next generation sequencing (NGS) between 2015 and 2022. H&E slides of the region sampled for molecular testing was reviewed 
for histologic features in the non-invasive (grade and configuration) and invasive components (histologic subtype). Mutational 
profiles for 26 genes commonly altered in urothelial carcinoma were correlated with histologic findings. 
Results: The study included 173 patients, 102 males and 71 females, with (mean ± SD) age of 67±10.9 years at the time of 
sequencing. Five-year overall survival was 32.6%. The cohort was divided into 5 subgroups (Table 1) as follows: noninvasive (low 
grade, high grade, and high grade with a low-grade background), and invasive (UC, NOS only and with histologic subtype). 
Invasive UTUC was present in 124 cases (71%), of which 89 (72%) had pure UC, NOS. Histologic subtypes were present in 35 
(28%) tumors, the most frequent of which were squamous (n=14, 40%) and sarcomatoid (n=7, 20%). PIK3CA, CDKN2A, FGFR3, 
and BRAF mutations were more frequent in squamous compared to UC, NOS or sarcomatoid tumors. Within cases containing a 
non-invasive component (n=141), bulky papillary morphology (reported to be associated with FGFR3 alterations) were enriched 
in FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, HRAS or KRAS alterations (78%, 35/45), while only 46% (44/96) without this morphology harbored 
these alterations. A non-invasive flat component was present in 31 patients, and papillary in 104. FGFR3 and PIK3CA were present 
more frequently in papillary tumors (42% and 23% respectively, vs. 3% and 3% in flat tumors). TP53 was present more frequently 
in flat tumors (52% vs. 24% in the papillary tumors).

Conclusions: Histologic subtypes are present in 28% of invasive UTUCs in this cohort. Histologic subtypes are associated with 
differences in genomic alterations in UTUC. Non-invasive UTUC with bulky papillary morphology is enriched for FGFR1, FGFR2, 
FGFR3, HRAS or KRAS alterations. TP53 mutations are more common in flat precursor lesions. 
 
783   Pathologic Findings in Patients on Active Surveillance for Prostatic Adenocarcinoma: 
Comparison Between Caucasian and African American Patients

Disclosures: Thi Nguyen: None; Dattatraya Patil: None; Adeboye Osunkoya: None 
Background: Active surveillance for prostate cancer (PCa) in patients who meet the criteria has become widely accepted across 
the United States (US), though the appropriateness of this approach for African American (AA) patients has not been well 
characterized in the pathology literature. The aim of this study was to compare the differences in pathologic findings between AA 
and Caucasian American (CA) patients who underwent active surveillance for PCa at a major academic institution in the US. 
Design: A search was made through our urology database for consented subjects with self-reported race as AA or CA with biopsy-
proven PCa diagnosed between 2008 and 2021 who underwent active surveillance with at least 1 repeat biopsy. We examined the 
differences in the pathological findings and other clinicopathological features, including follow-up. 
Results: One hundred and ten patients were included in the study. Twenty-seven (25%) were AA and eighty-three (75%) were CA. 
Mean patient age was 62 years (range: 40-103 years). The mean duration of follow-up was 22 months (range: 6-113 months). 
Among the CA patients, 79 (95%) had Gleason score 3+3=6 (Grade group 1), and 4 (5%) had Gleason score 3+4=7 (Grade group 
2) on the initial biopsy. The mean number of positive cores was 2. Perineural invasion was present in 7 patients (8%). In the AA 
patient cohort, 26 (96%) had Gleason score 3+3=6 (Grade group 1) and 1 (4%) had Gleason score 3+4=7 (Grade group 2). The 
mean number of positive cores was 2.2. Perineural invasion was present in 4 patients (15%). All patients had at least one repeat 
biopsy (range: 1 - 3), with 1 repeat biopsy in 91 patients (69 CA, 22 AA), 2 repeat biopsies in 14 patients (10 CA, 4 AA), and 3 
repeat biopsies in 5 patients (4 CA, 1 AA). The rate of higher Gleason scores (Grade groups) identified on subsequent biopsies 
was 33/83 (40%) for CA patients versus 8/27 (30%) for AA patients (p=0.34). Of the patients with upgraded Gleason scores (Grade 
groups), 16 had newly identified perineural invasion, 13 of whom were CA, and 3 were AA 
Conclusions: In our study, AA patients on active surveillance for PCa were not at increased risk for higher Gleason scores (Grade 
groups) or other adverse pathology findings at subsequent repeat needle core biopsies compared to CA patients. The results of 
this study may play a critical role in counseling and risk stratification of AA patients with PCa who are eligible for active surveillance.

Disclosures: Sarah Ni Mhaolcatha: None; Susan Prendeville: None 
Background: Cribriform carcinoma (CC) is recognised as an adverse prognostic parameter in prostate carcinoma (PCa). Despite 
recent consensus definitions of CC, PCa with cribriform architecture and mucin extravasation has been identified as a challenging 
area with limited studies assessing the prognostic significance of this pattern. This study evaluated the frequency and pathologic 
correlates of mucinous cribriform pattern (MCP) at radical prostatectomy (RP). 
Design: A series of completerly embedded RPs (n=488) were reviewed for the presence of MCP and CC. MCP was defined as 
tumours with cribriform epithelial proliferation associated with intraglandular or extraglandular mucin as the only CC component 
(absence of non-mucinous CC or intraductal carcinoma). Cases with non-mucinous CC were identified as a comparison group. 
Findings were correlated with serum PSA, grade group and pathologic stage at RP. 
Results: Results are summarised in table 1. MCP was identified in 19/488 (4%) cases while CC was identified in 158/488 cases 
(32%). MCP showed predominantly intraglandular mucin with 1 case containing abundant extraglandular mucin pools. The 
overwhelming majority of MCP were GG2 (18/19, 95%) with no cases >GG3 in this series. Among GG2 cases, the rate 
of non organ-confined disease was significantly greater in the CC group compared to the MCP group (p value <0.001). Of 
those undergoing lymph node dissection (LND), lymph node metastasis was identified in 7% of CC tumours and 0% of MCP 
tumours.

Conclusions: MCP is an uncommon morphologic pattern at RP and was not associated with adverse features in our series when 
compared with non-mucinous CC. These findings support excluding MCP when reporting cribriform carcinoma as an adverse 
prognostic marker. Further study assessing biopsy findings and correlating with clinical outcome is underway and evaluation in 
larger cohorts may help to further refine the prognostic significance of this morphologic growth pattern.

Background: Metastases to the penis are rare, and their clinicopathologic spectrum remains incompletely described. 
Design: In this multi-institutional study, we compiled a series of 109 patients to investigate the histologic and clinical features of 
solid malignancies that secondarily involve the penis. 
Results: The mean patient age at diagnosis was 71 years (range 7-94 years). 95/109 (87%) patients had clinically manifest 
disease most commonly presenting with a penile nodule/mass (48/95; 51%), pain (14/95; 15%), and hematuria (11/95; 12%); 1/109 
(1%) patients was diagnosed incidentally, while 13/109 (12%) patients had no available data. A history of prior cancer was 
identified in 92/104 (89%) patients, whereas in 12/104 (12%) patients, penile metastases were the initial clinical presentation. 
Diagnosis was made mainly on biopsy (82/109; 75%) or penectomy (either partial or total) (21/109; 19%) specimens (Fig. 1). In four 
patients (4/109; 4%), the diagnosis was made by fine-needle aspiration. The most common penile locations were the glans (45/98; 
41%) and corpora cavernosa (39/98; 36%). Carcinoma (101/109; 93%) was the most common primary histology, followed by 
malignant melanoma (3/109; 3%), sarcoma (2/109; 2%), teratoma (1/109; 1%), myeloma (1/109; 1%), and yolk sac tumor (1/109; 
1%). Most primary carcinomas originated in the genitourinary (76/109; 70%) and gastrointestinal (20/109; 18%) tracts. The most 
common genitourinary primaries included prostate (38/109; 35%) and bladder (27/109; 25%), while colorectal (18/109; 17%) was 
the most common gastrointestinal primary (Fig. 2). Data on metastasis to other organs were available for 78/109 (72%) patients 
and 50/78 (64%) patients had additional (i.e., non-penile) metastases. Outcome data were available for 87/109 (80%) patients, and 
59 (68%) died during the follow-up period.

Conclusions: This largest series compiled to date on this topic demonstrates that: 1.) most secondary solid tumors of the penis 
originate in the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts; 2.) they are typically clinically manifest; and 3.) they portend poor clinical 
outcomes.

Background: Secondary solid malignancies of the testis are rare and their clinicopathologic spectrum remains incompletely 
understood. 
Design: In this multi-institutional study, we evaluated a series of 158 patients who had secondary solid testicular tumors, to 
characterize their clinical and pathologic features. 
 
  
 
S779 
Results: The mean patient age at diagnosis was 64 years (range 12-93 years). Available history of prior cancer was present in 
123/141 (87%) patients, whereas in 18/141 (13%) patients, testicular involvement was the initial manifestation. Most patients 
(127/144; 88%) had clinically manifest disease, with either testicular mass/nodule (89/127; 70%) and/or pain (13/127; 10%) as the 
most common findings. In 17/144 (12%) patients, the testicular involvement was discovered incidentally on surgical specimens or 
imaging studies. The diagnosis was made mainly on orchiectomy specimens (150/158; 95%) (Fig. 1). Different types of carcinomas 
(144/158; 91%), including adenocarcinomas (72/158; 46%), were the most common histologies (Fig. 2). Most primary neoplasms 
originated in the genitourinary (93/149; 62%), gastrointestinal (27/149; 18%), and respiratory (13/149; 9%) tracts. The most 
common primary sites were prostate (51/149; 34%), kidney (29/149; 20%), colorectal (13/149; 9%), and lung (12/149; 8%). 
Intratubular growth was identified in 13/124 (11%) cases and paratesticular involvement in 84/152 (55%) cases. The mechanism of 
testicular involvement was metastasis in 154/157 (98%) cases, unclear in 2/157 (1%) cases, and direct spread in 1/157 (1%) 
cases; in one case, there was no data available. 78/101 (77%) patients had concurrent or prior extratesticular metastases. In 
patients with available follow-up data (110/158; 70%), 53% (58/110) died of disease. 
Figure 1 - 786 
 
Figure 2 - 786 
 
Conclusions: In conclusion, in this largest series compiled to date on this topic, we demonstrate that most secondary solid tumors 
of the testis represent metastatic spread from genitourinary, digestive, or respiratory primaries and often occur in the context of 
widespread disease. 
 
787   Clinical Significance of Perineural Invasion Encircled Completely Vs. Incompletely by 
Prostate Cancer on Needle Core Biopsy

Disclosures: Julum Nwanze: None; Yuki Teramoto: None; Ying Wang: None; Hiroshi Miyamoto: None 
Background: The presence of perineural invasion (PNI) by prostate cancer, particularly in biopsy specimens, is well known to be a 
strong indicator of aggressive disease, such as extraprostatic extension, and resultant poor prognosis. However, it remains unclear 
if the pattern of PNI has a clinical impact. In the present study, we compared radical prostatectomy findings and long-term 
oncologic outcomes to identify any differences between biopsies with PNI encircled completely vs. incompletely by cancer. 
Design: We assessed consecutive patients with PNI on systematic sextant biopsy who had subsequently undergone radical 
prostatectomy at our institution from 2009 to 2016. A total of 125 men in our surgical pathology database met the inclusion criteria 
for PNI detected only in one focus in the entire biopsy specimen after excluding cases undergoing neoadjuvant therapy prior to 
prostatectomy and those where the histology slides had been unavailable for review. 
Results: 57 (46%) cases showed completely encircled PNI, whereas 68 (54%) were non-encircled PNI. Between the two cohorts, 
there were no significant differences in clinicopathologic features, including preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, the number 
of cancer-positive biopsy site, tumor grade on biopsy or prostatectomy, pT or pN category, surgical margin status, estimated tumor 
volume, and the need for adjuvant therapy immediately after prostatectomy (see Table). Kaplan-Meier analysis coupled with log-
rank test revealed no significant difference in the risk of postoperative disease progression in patients with encircled PNI vs. non-
encircled PNI detected on biopsy (Figure 1). When the non-encircled cases were further divided into four groups [i.e. <25% 
encircled (n=12; 18%); ≥25%/<50% encircled (n=18; 26%); ≥50%/<75% encircled (n=10; 15%); and ≥75%/<100% encircled (n=28; 
41%)], no significant differences in progression-free survival were seen (Figure 2).

Conclusions: In biopsy specimens exhibiting PNI at only one focus, encircled vs. non-encircled PNI appears to show little clinical 
significance. PNI on prostate biopsy may thus need to be similarly taken into consideration irrespective of the pattern of nerve 
involvement. 
 
788   Clinical Significance of the PI-RADS Score in Men with Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radical 
Prostatectomy

Disclosures: Julum Nwanze: None; Yuki Teramoto: None; Ying Wang: None; Hiroshi Miyamoto: None 
Background: MRI-targeted biopsy (T-Bx) for which the PI-RADS score is useful has been shown to more accurately detect 
clinically significant prostate cancer. However, the clinical significance of prostate cancer detection on T-Bx, in conjunction with PI-
RADS, needs to be further investigated. In the present study, we compared radical prostatectomy (RP) findings and oncologic 
outcomes in patients with prostate cancer detected on sextant biopsy (S-Bx) and/or T-Bx. 
Design: We assessed consecutive patients who had undergone T-Bx in addition to systematic S-Bx (6 parts, ≥12 cores), followed 
by RP at our institution. Within our Surgical Pathology database, we identified a total of 222 men who met the inclusion criteria for 
prostatic adenocarcinoma on S-Bx and/or T-Bx. Cases undergoing neoadjuvant therapy prior to RP were excluded from analysis. 
Results: Prostate cancer was detected on S-Bx only (n=32; 14%), T-Bx only (n=40; 18%), or both S-Bx and T-Bx (B-Bx: n=150; 
68%), while these patients showed PI-RADS 3 (n=47; 21%), 4 (n=90; 41%), or 5 (n=85; 38%) lesion. Meanwhile, T-Bx detected 
cancer in 36 (77%) of PI-RADS 3 cases, 76 (84%) of PI-RADS 4 cases, and 78 (92%) of PI-RADS 5 cases. Compared with PI-
RADS 3 lesion, PI-RADS 4 lesion was associated with significantly higher tumor grade on biopsy or RP. Similarly, some of RP 
findings (i.e. Grade Group, pT, estimated tumor volume) were significantly worse in cases with PI-RADS 5 lesion than in those with 
PI-RADS 3 lesion. There were no significant differences in any of clinicopathologic features examined, except age, between PI-
RADS 4 vs. 5 lesions. Kaplan-Meier analysis coupled with log-rank test revealed significantly higher risks of biochemical recurrence 
after RP in patients with PI-RADS 5 lesion than in those with PI-RADS 3 (P=0.027), 4 (P=0.040), or 3 or 4 (P=0.016) lesion. 
Additionally, compared to cases with no cancer, cancer detection on T-Bx (i.e. T-Bx + B-Bx cases) was associated with a 
significantly higher risk of recurrence in patients with PI-RADS 5 lesion (P=0.046), but not in those with PI-RADS 3 (P=0.254) or 4 
(P=0.085) lesion.

Conclusions: PI-RADS 5 lesions are associated with adverse pathology in RP specimens, such as higher tumor grade, stage, and 
volume, as well as poorer prognosis following RP. Moreover, the failure of cancer detection on T-Bx of PI-RADS 5 lesion, but not 
PI-RADS 3 or 4 lesion, may particularly indicate favorable outcomes.

Background: CDKN2A deletions are adverse features in non-muscle invasive bladder cancers however their impact and 
associations in the muscle invasive (MIBC) setting are still being investigated. Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), which 
also resides on chromosome 9p21, is reported as a reproducible surrogate immunohistochemistry (IHC) test 
for CDKN2A fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in mesothelioma but such correlation in MIBC has not been described. We 
assessed CDKN2A and MTAP correlation in a MIBC cystectomy cohort and explored their relationship to FGFR3 mutations, 
molecular subtypes, and outcomes. 
Design: A tissue micro-array of 302 high grade urothelial MIBC was created and assessed for CDKN2A status: normal, polysomy, 
homozygous (HOM-Del), heterozygous deletion (HET-Del) using DAKO probes and MTAP IHC (Abnova, clone 2G4). IHC was 
interpreted as negative when carcinoma completely lacked MTAP expression with appropriate internal controls. Results were 
compared with a subset of cases with known FGFR3 mutation status by next generation sequencing. Molecular subtype was 
defined as basal, luminal-URO and luminal-GU using CK5/6, GATA3, and p16 IHC. Relapse free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) 
were assessed. Statistical analysis was completed using SPSS. 
Results: 281/302 cases (pT2=46, T3=151, T4=84) were assessable by FISH and all IHC markers (basal=53, URO=119, GU=100, 
negative=9). CDKN2A was deleted in 130/281 (46%) with MTAP loss in 80/281 (28%), p < 0.001 (Table 1). Cases with MTAP loss 
were highly concordant with all CDKN2A deletions (PPV 92.5%, sensitivity=57%, specificity=96%) with improved sensitivity for 
HOM-Del (sensitivity=85%, specificity= 95%). CDKN2A status did not correlate with stage or nodal metastases. CDKN2A deletions 
were most frequent in luminal-URO (70% cases) and lowest in luminal-GU (17%) subtypes with 51% in basal subtype, p <0.001. In 
a subset of cases assessed for FGFR3 mutations (n=47 cases), CDKN2A deletions were seen in 6/7 FGFR3 mutated and 12/40 
wild-type cases, p=0.0091. In luminal-URO, CDKN2A deletions or polysomy reduced RFS (p=0.080) but not OS.

Conclusions: CDKN2A deletions are frequent in MIBC, predominantly within the luminal-URO group where they impact RFS. 
MTAP staining shows high sensitivity and specificity for HOM-Del in CDKN2A. There is a strong correlation of CDKN2A deletions 
with FGFR3 mutations as previously found in the non-muscle invasive setting.

Background: Several targeted therapies for FGFR alterations in bladder cancer are either currently in clinical trials or already 
FDA-approved. FGFR alterations—including activating single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and fusions—are common in bladder 
cancer and detectable via next-generation sequencing of DNA and RNA. The ability to rapidly screen patients based on routine 
pathology would help prioritize patients for full NGS workup. Here, we developed a model using H&E whole slide images (WSIs) to 
predict FGFR alterations using real-world data. 
Design: WSIs and ground truth labels pertaining to FGFR mutational status (obtained by DNA- and RNA-seq) were collected from 
primary and metastatic bladder cancer specimens (N=3,706, Table 1). Positive labels were defined as those harboring a 
pathogenic SNV or fusion of FGFR, as confirmed by a molecular pathologist (n=214 FGFR3, n=10 other FGFR genes). A holdout 
set (20% of data) was reserved for future validation purposes and not assessed further. Model development was performed on the 
remaining set of data as follows: i) a custom attention-based convolutional neural network with ResNet-18 backbone was trained to 
predict FGFR alteration from each WSI in the training set (60%), ii) hyperparameters were selected using an optimization set (20%) 
and iii) performance was reported on an evaluation set of data (20%). Training, optimization, and evaluation was performed in 5-
fold cross-validation (CV). Cohorts were stratified to maintain a similar distribution of tissue site and scanner types across each 
fold. 
Results: In 5-fold CV, the FGFR model achieved a mean receiver operating characteristic area under curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.79 
(95% CI 0.72 - 0.87, Figure 1). The ROC-AUC was 0.82 (95% CI 0.77 - 0.87) for WSIs within the bladder and 0.76 (95% CI 0.69 - 
0.83) for non-bladder, non-lymph node WSIs (Figure 2). The ROC-AUC was 0.80 (95% CI 0.72 - 0.88) for Philips UFS WSIs and 
0.78 (95% CI 0.68 - 0.87) for Leica GT450 WSIs. The ROC-AUC when considering only FGFR3 mutated alterations was 0.79 (95% 
CI 0.72 - 0.87), and for FGFR1 / FGFR2 alterations was 0.81 (95% CI 0.69 - 0.94).

Conclusions: This work demonstrates the ability to predict FGFR SNVs and fusions in bladder cancer using a deep learning 
model trained on H&E WSIs. Performance was similar across tissue sites, scanner types, and genes within the FGFR family. We 
anticipate that this model could be used to rapidly identify patients enriched for FGFR alterations, who could then be prioritized for 
NGS screening.

Background: Gleason pattern 5 (GP5) is heterogeneous, comprising single cells, files of single cells, solid masses/sheets and 
cribriform growth with comedonecrosis. Recent studies have suggested that cribriform carcinoma with comedonecrosis and large 
solid masses (comedo/solid) are associated with worse outcomes, but data on the prognostic significance of these sub-patterns in 
the context of Grade Group 5 (GG5) disease is limited. The goal of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of 
solid/comedo in radical prostatectomies (RP) with GG5 Prostate cancer (PCa). 
Design: We identified all in-house RP with GG5 PCa and excluded cases with limited archival material, history of neoadjuvant 
ADT, prior radiation, and those in which GG5 could not be confirmed after re-review of slides. All slides were reviewed for each 
case to determine GP5 sub-patterns. Cases with any amount of comedo/solid were considered comedo/solid+. Other variables 
obtained by review of slides and medical records included: cribriform carcinoma/intraductal carcinoma without comedonecrosis 
(CC/IDC), T stage, N stage, margin status, lymphovascular invasion, PSA and biochemical recurrence (BCR). 
Results: One-hundred and thirty (130) patients with a median age of 65 years and median pre-operative PSA values of 8 ng/mL 
were included in the analysis. Fifty-six (56, 43%) were comedo/solid+ and 74 (57%) were comedo/solid-. Among comedo/solid+, 48 
(86%) were also CC/IDC+. Among comedo/solid-, 34 (46%) were also CC/IDC+. On multivariable regression analysis, 
comedo/solid- was associated with a lower risk of BCR (OR=0.45, 95% CI=0.21, 0.96, p=0.039) only when CC/IDC status was 
excluded from the model. When CC/IDC status was included, CC/IDC+ was the only variable significantly associated with higher 
rates of BCR (OR=4.22, 95% CI=1.77, 11.0, p=0.002). Interestingly, pT stage, margin status and PSA values were not associated 
with outcomes in this series of RP with GG5 PCa. The number of cases with pTN1 stage was too small to analyze in a multivariable 
model.

Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that large solid growth and comedonecrosis is highly associated with CC/IDC in 
RPs with GG5 PCa. In this context, the presence of CC/IDC seems to be an important independent predictor of BCR. Additional 
studies with a larger number of CC/IDC- cases are needed to determine if large solid growth and comedonecrosis have 
independent prognostic value in RPs with GG5 PCa.

Background: Renal oncocytoma (RO) is a benign neoplasm, which may show potentially problematic and worrisome microscopic 
features. Fibrous epithelial cellular component (FECC) refers to entrapped epithelial cells with cytoplasmic clearing (ccRCC-like 
foci) within the fibrous stroma/scar. FECC has been previously reported although not to date studied in detail. The aim of our study 
has been to characterize the morphology and its IHC profile. 
Design: We retrospectively evaluated cases of RO with scar, collected from four tertiary academic centers. Cases with fibrous 
stroma/scar containing FECC were selected and examined for architectural patterns, cytological features, and IHC (CK7, CD117, 
vimentin, CA-IX, AMACR/P504S, cyclin-D1, and CK34bE12) in comparison to the surrounding oncocytoma. 
 
  
 
S786 
Results: Three hundred sixty one ROs were retrieved, and 114 cases (31.6%) showed a gross or microscopic central scar. 
Seventy-eight cases containing a scar with FEEC were finally evaluated. In 25 ROs, the FECC was so abundant that it showed a 
tumor-like morphology or tumor-in-tumor collision. Six architectural patterns were recognized: tubular, trabecular-solid, microcystic, 
nephrogenic adenoma-like, angiomatoid-like, and mixed. The FECC was located immediately adjacent to the oncocytoma 
component (32.1%), in the central portion of the scar (15.4%) or diffusely (52.6%). Cytologically, four cell types were identified in 
the FECC, all of them with cleared (ccRCC-like) or eosinophilic cytoplasm: flat-elongated, cuboidal, hobnail, and vacuolated-signet 
ring-like. In most FECC (88.5%), the nuclei were “higher grade” than oncocytes or atypical/reactive with nucleolus. The IHC study 
showed positivity for CK7 (100%), vimentin (100%), CA-IX (85.7%), AMACR (100%), and negativity for CD117 and cyclin D1 in the 
FECC. The RO showed an inverse IHC pattern to FECC.

Conclusions: FECC is a relatively unusual finding, which in our series appeared in 21.6% of all ROs. FECC can show widely 
variable architectural and cytological patterns. It is important to know and keep FECC in mind, when evaluating an oncocytic tumor, 
since it may pose diagnostic problems, especially in needle core biopsies. Its IHC profile is the inverse of the RO. This raises 
questions about its origin: trapped normal renal tubular component with reactive changes vs. changes in tumor cells in a fibrotic 
“hostile” hypoxic microenvironment.

Background: DNA methylation is an early and stable event in cell differentiation and tumorigenesis. Measurement of genome-wide 
methylation signatures by Illumina arrays is feasible in FFPE clinical samples and has well demonstrated utility in brain and 
mesenchymal neoplasm classification. 
Design: We profiled FFPE samples of renal neoplasms on Illumina methylation arrays and obtained methylation data from publicly 
available sources. Machine learning applications were used to characterize distinct methylation groups and identify relationships 
with known clinicopathologic parameters. 
Results: We analyzed DNA methylation data (450k and 850k) of 1626 kidney and urothelial neoplasms and normal kidney 
controls. Of these, 226 were newly profiled and the remaining 1400 samples were obtained from publicly available datasets. Using 
unsupervised dimensionality reduction, we identified 20 groups comprising cortex, medulla, and 18 neoplasm classes (1 urothelial 
group and 17 classes of kidney neoplasms) (Figure 1). Several histologically defined tumor entities resolved into distinct epigenetic 
subclasses including prognostically favorable (Cluster 1) and unfavorable (Cluster 2) classes of both clear cell RCC (ccRCC) and 
papillary RCC (pRCC) (Figure 2). pRCC Cluster 2 tumors (unfavorable prognosis) often had both SETD2 and PBRM1 mutations. A 
distinct class of VHL-wild-type clear cell papillary RCC (ccpRCC) without chromosome 3p loss was also identified. Tumors with a 
histologic diagnosis of chromophobe RCC (ChRCC) resolved into 3 classes: a major ChRCC class enriched in TP53 mutations, an 
MTOR pathway mutation enriched class, and a smaller class of eosinophilic renal tumors with benign clinical course. Additional 
groups included FH-deficient RCC, FLCN-mutant hybrid oncocytic tumor, KRAS-mutant papillary renal neoplasm with reverse 
polarity, BRAF-mutant metanephric adenoma, angiomyolipoma, Wilms tumor, malignant rhabdoid tumor, and clear cell sarcoma of 
the kidney. A support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier was developed using a reference set of 1268 samples and applied to 
a validation set (n=358), showing that 353 samples (99%) were correctly assigned to one of the 20 classes (Table).

Background: Bladder urothelial carcinoma (BUC) is the most common neoplasm of the urinary tract. Muscle invasive bladder 
carcinoma (MIBUC) is the most aggressive BUC and is characterized by genomic instability and a high mutational rate. Genomic 
data has led to a better molecular classification of BUC, but this data is elusive in Hispanic patients. Thus, we aim to identify the 
somatic variants and copy number variations (CNV) of Mexican patients with BUC assessing for a potential relationship with the 
MIBUC. 
Design: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional study using data from 37 patients. Genomic DNA was isolated from 
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded BC tissues obtained from the National Cancer Institute – Mexico pathology department for each 
patient. DNA was sequenced and mapped against the reference genome hg19. High confidence variants were identified by two or 
more variant callers (Mutect2, Strelka2, and Lancet). CNVs were identified with Facets. Mutations and CNV events frequency were 
contrasted with the MIBC phenotype using Fisher’s exact test. 
Results: A total of 37 patients with a mean age at diagnosis of 62.49 years (Standard Deviation [SD]: 11.41 years) and a greater 
proportion of male patients (70.73%) were included. MIBUC was identified in 45.95% (n=17) of the cases and displayed a poorer 
overall survival compared to patients with non-MIBUC (p=0.001). A total of 15,770 somatic variants were identified, from which 601 
 
  
 
S789 
were considered driver mutations. KMT2C (32%), CDC27 (27%), ARID1A (24%), KMT2D (22%), and MUC16 (22%) were the Top-
5 genes more mutated. Chromosomes 20, 19, and 8 were affected almost entirely by CNV gains, whereas chromosomes 9, 10, 17, 
21, and 22 were affected mainly by CNV losses. The cytobands 5q31.3 (94.59%), 1p36.21 (91.89%), and 19q13.42 (81.08%) were 
the most frequently affected. When comparing the mutations landscape, patients with MIBUC tended to present frequent mutations 
in KMT2CD (p=0.06) and focal amplifications in 11p15.5 (p=0.06), whereas patients with non-MIBUC tend to have 
more BRCA1 (p=0.07), CTNND1 (p=0.07) and STPAN1 (p=0.07) and focal deletions in chr7q11.23 (p=0.005). 
Conclusions: Mexican patients with MIBUC showed a high frequency of KMT2CD mutation and focal amplification of 11p15.5. To 
our knowledge, this is the first genomic evaluation of BUC in a Hispanic cohort. Further research is needed to confirm the high 
mutation frequency of KMT2D in Hispanic patients and to assess its potential as a prognostic biomarker.

Background: Micropapillary variant of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (MPUC) is a rare and aggressive histological variant of 
bladder cancer and has been associated with a poor prognosis. A high frequency of MPUC contain activating mutations in the 
extracellular domain (ECD) of ERBB2. We sought to further characterize ERBB2 ECD-mutated tumors to identify additional 
genomic alterations (GA) that have been associated with tumor progression, therapeutic response and treatment resistance. 
Design: DNA was extracted from 219 cases of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections from ERBB2 ECD-mutated bladder 
tumors. We used comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) to evaluate the frequencies of GA. Sequencing was performed using 
hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation-based libraries to a mean coverage depth of >500× for 315 cancer-related genes. Tumor 
mutational burden (TMB) was determined on up to 1.1 Mbp of sequenced DNA and microsatellite instability (MSI) was determined 
on 114 loci. 
Results: We identified 219 cases of urothelial bladder cancer with ERBB2 ECD mutations, 63 (28.7%) of which were MPUC. The 
median age of patients was 74 and 71 for MPUC and non-MPUC, respectively. Male sex was predominant in both cohorts (87% in 
MPUC and 81% in non-MPUC). Analysis of co-mutated genes revealed that TERT, TP53, and ARID1A were the most common co-
altered genes in ERBB-mutant MPUC (82.5%, 58.3%, and 39.7%) and did not differ significantly from ERBB-mutant non-MPUC 
(86.5%, 51.9%, and 35.3%). The main genomic differences between ERBB2 ECD-mutated MPUC versus non-MPUC were in 
frequencies of KMT2D, RB1 and MTAP mutations. KMT2D and RB1 are tumor suppressor genes. KMT2D frequency was 
significantly decreased in ERBB2 ECD-mutated MPUC (6.4%) versus non-MPUC tumors (27.6%) (p=0.02). RB1 mutations were 
higher in ERBB2 ECD-mutated MPUC (33.3%) than non-MPUC (17.3%). Lastly, MTAP is an arginine metabolism gene and is an 
emerging biomarker for new synthetic lethality based anti-cancer drugs (PRMT5 and MTA2 inhibitors). MTAP loss was lower 
in ERBB2 ECD-mutated MPUC (11.1%) compared to non-MPUC (26.9%). 
Figure 1 - 795 
 
Conclusions: Characterizing the genomic landscape of urothelial carcinoma is an important tool to identify possible diagnostic and 
prognostic biomarkers that drive tumor progression and dictate treatment response. This study 
identified KMT2D, RB1 and MTAP as potential important genomic driver co-mutations that differ between ERBB2 ECD-mutated 
MPUC versus non-MPUC tumors.

Background: Middle-income countries face challenging health care and educational systems. Regarding the training of the 
pathologists, the reduced offer of fellowship programs leads to a small number of subspecialist pathologists. Correct pathological 
evaluation of prostatic specimens is crucial for patient prognostic assessment and therapeutic planning. This study aims to 
compare original prostatic cancer reports with subspecialist second-opinion reviews and determine the concordance rate in a 
tertiary brazilian cancer center. 
Design: Reviewed reports of prostatic specimens were searched in our institution pathology database between April 2017 and 
August 2022. The cases were referred for second opinion or reviewed routinely by trained genitourinary pathologists before 
initiation of the treatment. Our study included reviewed reports of biopsy, transurethral resections of the prostate (TURP) and 
radical prostatectomies (RP). Diagnostic agreement after review was evaluated for the following variables: diagnosis of prostatic 
adenocarcinoma (PA), Gleason score (GS) and ISUP grading group (GG). Kappa coefficient (κ) was performed to establish 
diagnostic concordance. 
Results: In the period of study, 729 cases of 725 patients were reviewed, including 678 biopsies, 33 RP and 18 TURP. 708 cases 
(97.1%) showed diagnosis agreement (κ=0.797; p<0.001) in which 662 cases agreed on the diagnosis of PA. Among PA cases, 
GS concordance was observed in 408 cases (61.6%) and disagreement in 254 (38.4%) (κ=0.496; p<0,001). Among all cases with 
GS disagreement, there was an upgrade in 155 cases (61.0%), downgrade in 75 cases (29.5%) and maintenance of GG in 24 
cases (9.5%) (κ=0,537; p<0.001). Specifically in biopsy and TURP cases, in which the change of GG can potentially define surgical 
indication, there was GS disagreement in 243 cases (38.5%) (κ=0.488; p<0.001), with an upgrade, downgrade, and maintenance of 
GG in 59.3%, 30.8% and 9.9%, respectively (κ=0.532; p<0.001). Among all cases, there was diagnostic discordance in 21 cases 
(2.9%) after review, one case with change in the diagnosis from benign to PA and from PA to benign in 8 cases. 
Conclusions: Accurate pathological diagnosis is crucial for defining the best therapeutic approach for patients. Thus, the relevant 
rate of diagnostic disagreement regarding GS and GG in prostatic samples found in our study endorses the significant role of 
pathologic report review by a subspecialist genitourinary pathologist.

Background: Molecular analysis has been useful in translational studies of prostatic tissues, but is hampered by the availability 
and quality of appropriate tissues, i.e. tumor recognition in radical prostatectomies. Nonlinear microscopy (NLM) is a laser 
microscopy technique that can rapidly image tissue without requiring sectioning. It can recognize prostate carcinoma in both fresh 
and fixed tissue with high sensitivity and specificity. NLM produces high resolution images that resemble H&E histology by using a 
scanned, short-pulsed laser to excite exogenous fluorescence only at the laser focus. NLM does not interfere with subsequent 
tissue processing or immunohistochemical analysis. In this study we obtained fresh tissues from prostatectomies of patients 
enrolled in a NIH funded project (NIH 5R01CA249151-02) designed to examine prostate tissue margins and putatively reduce 
neurovascular bundle sacrifice. 
Design: Fresh tissue specimens were stained in acridine orange and sulforhodamine 101 solution for 2 min and rinsed for 30-
second in saline. Areas of cancer and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were identified by NLM. Collected fresh tissues were 
mechanically disrupted and filtered through a nylon mesh screen. Single cell suspensions were centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min and 
the cell pallet was washed before staining. Collected single cell suspensions were processed for TILs functional assays and 
isolation of TIL-specific RNA, DNA and proteins. 
Results: NK cells and T cells were identified by first gating on lymphocytes and then gating on CD45+ and amine negative viable 
cells that were either NK cells (CD14-CD20-CD3-CD159A+) or T cells (CD14-CD20-CD3+CD159A-). Prostate cancer and benign 
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissue along with sorted NK cells and CD8+ T cells from these tissues were sequenced using third 
generation sequencing (TGS) direct RNA sequencing (Nanopore). NK cells and CD8+ T cells were also assessed for activation 
state and general phenotypes in addition to more functional properties using multiparametric flow cytometry panels. Preliminary

TGS approaches have also generated 5-20 long RNA sequence reads per gene, on average, with associated epitranscriptional 
modification of RNA bases.

Background: Gleason score and grade group of prostate adenocarcinoma on needle core biopsies help in risk stratification and 
prognosis. Higher grade groups typically demonstrate increased risk of biochemical recurrence and advanced (metastatic) disease. 
Within one grade group, the percentage of cores involved by tumor is directly related to increased risk of aggressive disease. 
Recent studies have shown that volume of Gleason pattern 4 in radical prostatectomies has the most influence on pre- and post-
operative serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) as well as disease progression. Our aim was to predict the clinical behavior based 
on prostate biopsy assessment of limited versus extensive Gleason pattern 4 carcinoma compared across separate grade groups 
and secondary patterns. To our knowledge, such a study has not been previously published. 
Design: Our institutional pathology database was searched for prostate carcinoma cases which had Gleason score 4+3=7 and 
higher on biopsy. Cases were classified into Gleason score 4+5=9 with less than 50% cores involved (limited pattern 4) and 
Gleason score 4+3=7 with more than 50% cores involved (extensive pattern 4). Cases with any additional cores showing differing 
Gleason scores were excluded. Follow-up information like radical prostatectomy findings, treatment modalities provided and 
percentage of cases with biochemical recurrence was obtained. 
Results: A total of 972 prostate biopsies (2015-2018) with Gleason score 4+3=7 and higher were reviewed. More than 95% of the 
cases had been diagnosed and graded by one of the authors. All cases had received clinical interventions like radical 
prostatectomy, androgen deprivation, radiation therapy or combination modalities. 23 cases had Gleason score 4+5=9 with less 
than 50% cores involved. 4 of 23 cases (17%) had biochemical recurrence (mean recurrence free survival = 15 months). 7 cases 
had Gleason score 4+3=7 with more than 50% cores involved. 3 of 7 cases (43%) had biochemical recurrence (mean recurrence 
free survival = 27 months).

Conclusions: Extent of involvement by primary Gleason pattern 4 carcinoma on prostate biopsies predicts adverse outcome 
independent of secondary pattern 3 or 5.

Background: Low-grade oncocytic tumor (LOT) of the kidney is a recently described entity, characterized by an oncocytoma-like 
morphology, a distinct immunohistochemical profile (CK7+, CD117-), and gene mutations (TSC1/2, MTOR) resulting in a 
constitutive mTORC1 complex activation. Herein, we analyzed a case series of LOT to verify whether, in addition to the mutations 
directly affecting the mTOR pathway, other genes could be involved in the activation of the mTORC1 complex through alternative 
mechanisms. 
Design: We retrospectively collected 9 cases of LOT diagnosed at our two Institutions between January 1st 2019-May 1st 2022; all 
cases were reviewed and confirmed by two uropathologists, also adopting a large immunohistochemical (PAX8, CD117, CK7, 
AMACR, CK20, Ki67, FH, SHDB, Cathepsin-K). Subsequently, each case was tested with two laboratory-developed NGS panels 
targeting a total of 19 tumor-associated genes (for a total of 888 amplicons), including the genes involved in the pathogenesis of 
RCC and mTOR pathway. 
Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 66.1 years (range: 50-79 years), with 5 (55.6%) males and 4 (44.4%) females, 
respectively. No patients had a story of tuberous sclerosis, with the majority of the lesions (77.8%) located in the right kidney. All 
cases showed the characteristic histological (no capsule; solid/nested/tubular-reticular growth; a central area with “boats in a bay” 
aspect; rare lymphocytic clusters; oncocytic cells without “raisinoid” nuclei; no necrosis, pleomorphism and mitoses) and 
immunohistochemical (CK7+, CD117-) features of LOT. In one case the extracted DNA did not pass the quality 
control. MTOR mutations were found in 4 (50%) cases (p.Ala2420Val, p.Ser2215Tyr, p.Leu2427Gln, p.Ser2215Phe), with 1 
(12.5%) case showing NOTCH1 (p.Glu515Lys) and NOTCH4 (p.Asp272Gly) mutations; 3 (37.5%) cases did not show mutations. 
No mutations in TSC1/2 were found in our cases, contrary to what was previously reported. 
Conclusions: Our data confirm the main role of the mTOR pathway in the pathogenesis of LOT, mostly due to MTOR rather 
than TSC1/TSC2 mutations. Besides, our study suggests that activating mutations of NOTCH genes (proved to be associated with 
an exaggerated and constitutive activation of the mTOR pathway in neoplastic cell lines, solid tumors, and leukemias) could be 
involved in the pathogenesis of a subgroup of LOT through a not-canonical activation of mTORC1 complex, not directly involving 
mTOR pathway genes and so not detected by the commonly used NGS panels.

Background: Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is an increasingly important molecular phenotype given the 
development of targeted treatments for HRD positive tumors. While HRD is routinely assessed in breast and ovarian cancer, 
prostate cancer patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene loss may also benefit from targeted therapy. Here, we 
applied weakly supervised deep learning to predict HRD status from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images 
(WSIs) in prostate cancer as a potential screening assay for confirmatory sequencing. 
Design: Real world prostate cancer tumor biopsy and resection specimens were collected; each sample additionally included: 1) 
clinical characteristics, 2) molecular profiles via DNA/RNA sequencing, and 3) digitized WSI data. The ground truth HRD status for 
each WSI was generated from an analytically validated commercial assay that relies on RNA expression. Attention-based multiple-
instance-learning networks were trained to predict HRD status from WSIs. All WSIs (N=3210, HRD+ 8.1%) were split into training 
 
  
 
S793 
(N=2038, HRD+ 7.8%), tuning (N=455, HRD+ 9.8%), and test sets (N=332, HRD+ 8.4%). The test set consisted of needle core 
biopsies scanned on Leica GT450, while the training/tuning sets included biopsies and resections scanned on Leica GT450 or 
Philips UFS instruments. 
Results: The cohort skewed towards high gleason scores (GS) and these high GS samples had a higher prevalence of HRD 
(Table 1). Predicting HRD from WSI resulted in an area under receiving operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.73 [0.64-0.82 95% 
CI] on the test set (Figure 1A). At 70% sensitivity, the predictor had a 21.3% PPV across all samples compared to an underlying 
prevalence of 8.4%. In additional analysis, we found that the model is able to effectively stratify patients with BRCA double hit 
mutations (AUROC: 0.77 [0.68-0.84 95% CI], Figure 1B). Performance remained robust in GS7-8 (AUROC 0.81, PPV 23.5% at 
70% sensitivity) and GS9-10 (AUROC 0.68, PPV 16.7% at 70% sensitivity). Visualization of high attention HRD+/HRD- tiles 
suggest the model relies on dense tumor regions in making its predictions (Figure 2).

Conclusions: An imaging-based model effectively predicts HRD status and BRCA double-hit mutations from routine H&E images. 
This low-cost and rapid detection capability could help to prioritize tissue for confirmatory molecular testing and better identify 
populations that may benefit from existing therapy or clinical trial enrollment eligibility. 
 
801   DNA Methylation Landscapes of Prostate Cancer Brain Metastasis Are Shaped by Early Driver 
Genetic Alterations

Disclosures: Antonio Rodriguez: None; John Gallon: None; Mark Rubin: None; Salvatore Piscuoglio: None 
Background: Epigenetic dysregulation is a feature of primary prostate cancer, and distinct DNA methylation profiles are 
associated with the mutually exclusive SPOP mutant or TMPRSS2-ERG fusion genetic backgrounds. Metastases from primary 
 
  
 
S794 
prostate cancers to rare locations, such as the brain, are becoming more common due to longer life expectancy thanks to improved 
treatments and a deep molecular understanding of these is lacking. 
Design: Our cohort includes samples from 42 patients with PCBM and 17/42 patients with available paired primary tumor, collected 
from Pathology Departments across Switzerland and from the Department of Pathology, Emory University, Atlanta, USA. We 
collected archived FFPE tissue from CNS (brain/spinal cord) and meningeal metastases as well from available paired primary 
tumors. Multi-region sampling permitted evaluation of intra-tumoural epigenetic heterogeneity at the primary (56 samples) and 
metastatic sites (96 samples). All 155 selected areas underwent DNA methylation analysis, and were integrated with whole exome 
sequencing and targeted-RNA-seq data, produced in an already published manuscript by our group. 
Results: We performed unsupervised hierarchical consensus clustering using the top 1% most variably methylated CpG sites 
across the metastatic samples. This separated the TMPRSS2-ERG fused samples from the non-fused samples, which included 
those with SPOP mutations. We calculated the mean methylation change of the SPOP mutant, or TMPRSS2-ERG fusion PCBM 
samples, compared to normal prostate tissue, and observed the previously reported hypermethylator phenotype in 
the SPOP mutant samples (Fig. 1). The variably methylated CpG sites were predominantly CpG island-associated. SPOP mutant 
metastases showed hypermethylation in comparison to metastases lacking mutation. To understand what processes might drive 
the detected hypermethylation, we performed gene set enrichment analysis using the CpG-level DM data. When examining the 
methylation changes specifically associated with either the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion or SPOP mutant backgrounds, in comparison to 
the other metastases, PRC2-associated pathways were enriched in the SPOP mutant metastases. RNA-seq data showed a 
significant increase in EZH2 expression, a component of PCR2, in the metastases compared to primaries (Fig. 2). 
Figure 1 - 801 
 
Figure 2 - 801 
 
Conclusions: We found aberrant methylation in PCBM is associated with mutational background, PRC2 complex activity and 
upregulation of EZH2, an effect that is particularly pronounced in SPOP mutant PCBM.

Background: Urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the upper urinary tract (UUT) is a rare malignancy that demonstrates similar histologic 
features to those of urinary bladder UC. However, UUTUC may be a genetically different disease from bladder UC. Recent studies 
have revealed that bladder UC can be divided into different molecular subtypes which are associated with distinct biological 
behaviors. Herein we analyzed the gene mutational profile of UUTUC in correlation with its clinical and pathological features. 
Design: We searched our pathology files from 2014-2016 and identified 54 patients with UUTUC who underwent Next-Generation-
Sequencing (NGS) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens. Pathologic features were reviewed, and 
clinicopathologic parameters were collected from patient records. 
Results: The patients included 33 males and 21 females with a mean age of 67 years (range, 41-90 years). The primary tumors 
were located at the renal pelvis (30), ureter (10), or both (14). All tumors were high-grade UC, and 18 tumors showed divergent 
differentiation, squamous (5), micropapillary (3), sarcomatoid (2), small cell carcinoma (2), and others (6). NGS tests were 
performed on 43 primary tumors and 11 metastatic tumors. Mutations were detected in 50 cases, and the most common mutations 
were TP53 (23), followed by PIK3CA (11), FGFR3 (10), TSC1 (6), ERBB2(5), KIT (5), ATM (5), TERT-P (4), ERG (4), and APC (4). 
TP53 mutations were more common in male patients (Table 1). Renal pelvis UC had higher rates of PIK3CA and FGFR3 mutations 
than ureteral UC. ERBB2 and ATM mutations were more frequent in UC with divergent differentiation. Twenty-eight patients died of 
disease in a mean time of 31 months (range 1-107 months). While TP53 mutations were associated with high-stage UC and a 
shorter survival time (mean 27 months), FGFR3 mutations were associated with low-stage UC with a longer survival time (mean 43 
months).  
 
Conclusions: UTTUC demonstrates frequent gene mutations, which may underlie the development of this rare disease. Our 
results suggest that gene mutations may be associated with distinct pathologic and clinical features, which may be useful in the 
targeted therapy of UTTUC.

Background: Low-grade noninvasive urothelial carcinoma (LGUCa) of the bladder exhibits a heterogenous clinical course 
following initial diagnosis. Identification of clinical variables associated with tumor recurrence may help to risk stratify patients and 
develop personalized surveillance protocols. We aimed to utilize a complementary histological investigation along with artificial 
intelligence (AI) to predict LGUCa tumor recurrence. 
Design: Patients with LGUCa from 2015-2019 with at least 3 years of clinical follow up were enrolled in the study. Tumors were 
stratified by downstream recurrences (Non-Recurrent: NR: vs. Recurrent: R). A genitourinary pathologist reviewed H&E stained 
slides, noting cytologic and architectural atypia, including inverted growth pattern and percentage of non-tumor cell component. 
Histologic features in R vs. NR tumors were analyzed using Fisher’s Exact Test. To construct a morphological signature for 
recurrence risk stratification, a deep learning algorithm was used to extract quantitative features from segmented nuclei on high-
resolution digitized whole slide images. These features were then correlated to recurrence free survival (RFS) utilizing a 
multivariable Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model and recurrence risk stratification was examined using Kaplan-Meier analysis 
and log-rank test. 
Results: Twenty-nine LGUCa from 29 patients were identified, of which 17 (59%) had subsequent recurrence. The median (IQR) 
follow up was 59 months, and the median (IQR) number of recurrences following initial diagnosis was 4 in the R cohort. R tumors 
exhibited a higher frequency of inverted growth pattern (45% vs. 11%, p=0.04) and higher median stroma percentage (50% vs. 
20%, p<0.01). The AI derived morphological signature was predictive of recurrence with an AUROC of 0.81. Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated the model was able to risk stratify the cohort with a statistically significant hazard ratio of 5.43 [95% CI 1.1, 26.76] 
(p=0.02) for prediction of high and low risk of recurrence. Patients in the high risk group had a 87.5% recurrence rate while those in 
the low risk group had a 28.5% recurrence rate.

Conclusions: Utilizing a complimentary approach with histologic analysis and AI, we were able to identify critical differences 
between R and NR LGUC bladder tumors. These hypothesis-generating findings will guide future studies to identify tumors that are 
at high risk for recurrence, thereby allowing for surveillance protocol tailoring and improved patient stratification.

Background: Demonstration of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression has become a prerequisite for decision-making 
around immune checkpoint therapy in a variety of tumors. Assessment of PD-L1 expression by percent tumor cell positivity (%TC) 
using IHC 28-8 pharmDx correlates with enhanced response from nivolumab in urothelial cancer. The quality of PD-L1 scoring and 
potential routes for optimization were investigated in an international study using diagnostic urothelial cancer samples covering the 
whole range of PD-L1 scores. 
Design: Tissue sections from 50 advanced pre-treatment urothelial carcinomas were preselected by three pathologists from 132 
specimens according to their PD-L1 score distribution, with most cases (80%) being close to the FDA approved cut-off of ≥1%TC 
expression using 28-8 and 22C3 assays centrally performed (CellCarta). Whole slide images were scanned at 40x magnification 
(3DHISTECH) and uploaded into the PathoTrainer platform (CellCarta).  Ten pathologists across the world performed PD-L1 
scoring prior and after 2 hours of online training at TC ≥1% cutoff. Scoring agreement was assessed using the intraclass correlation 
coefficient (ICC). Key challenges of scoring were identified by using mean absolute deviation (MAD) analysis. 
Results: Incident rate of samples ≥1% TC was generally in the 20-30% range for 8 of the 10 pathologists with only slightly lower 
scores for 22C3 as compared to 28-8. Training did not change positivity rate significantly. Interobserver variability for %TC 
expression was low with good agreement between pathologists both pre- (ICC range 0.80-0.88) and post-(ICC range 0.75-0.86) 
training by both assays. Review of PD-L1 expression in slides exhibiting high variability (MAD>10) revealed some challenges. 
Accordingly, faint membrane staining raises difficulty of scoring at the 1% cut off, particularly in tumors with optically prominent cell 
borders. In high score tumors discrepancy is mostly due to strong cytoplasmic staining obscuring the membrane related reaction. 
Conclusions: Inter-observer agreement of %TC expression scoring in bladder cancer was at an acceptable level between 
pathologists regardless of training or assay. Routes of improvement include PD-L1 training addressing challenges specific for low 
and high-score tumors. In addition, use of artificial or augmented intelligence may also contribute to the standardization of PD-L1 
%TC expression analysis to accurately identify patients likely to benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

Disclosures: Faisal Saeed: None; Adeboye Osunkoya: None 
Background: Prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) with seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) is frequently associated with high grade and 
high-volume disease, tumor recurrence, and poor prognosis. In this study we analyzed the lymph node (LN) findings in patients 
with PCa and SVI on radical prostatectomy (RP). 
Design: A search was made through our urologic pathology files for patients who had RP and LN dissection demonstrating PCa 
with SVI. The number of LNs involved, laterality of LN involvement, size of metastatic foci, extranodal extension (ENE), Gleason 
scores/Grade groups, presence of Gleason pattern 5, and laterality of SVI were documented and analyzed in all patients. 
Results: A total of 224 patients were included in the study. The mean patient age was 62 years (range: 42-79 years). Patients 
were stratified into 2 cohorts; 1] PCa Grade group 2 with no tertiary pattern 5 (24/224 patients, 11%) and 2] PCa Grade group 2 
with tertiary pattern 5 and Grade group 3 or higher (200/224 patients, 89%). LN metastasis was present in 100/224 (44.6%) 
patients. Three of 24 (12.5%) patients in cohort 1 had LN metastasis whereas 97/200 (48.5%) patients in cohort 2 had LN 
metastasis. The mean number of positive LNs was 4 (range: 1-42) and the mean size of the metastatic foci was 1.0 cm (range: 0.1-
4.3 cm). ENE was present in 57/100 (57%). Forty-eight of the 100 (48%) patients with LN metastasis had unilateral SVI, 25/48 
(52.1%) patients had LN metastasis ipsilateral to the SVI, whereas only 3/48 (6.2%) patients had LN metastasis contralateral to the 
SVI. The remaining 20/48 (41.7%) patients had bilateral LN metastasis. Of the 52 patients with bilateral SVI, 32 (62%) had bilateral 
lymph node metastasis and 20 (38%) had unilateral LN metastasis. 
Conclusions: Patients with SVI and PCa Grade group 3 or higher and those with Grade group 2 associated with tertiary pattern 5 
have a higher risk of LN metastasis compared to those with SVI invasion and PCa Grade group 2 with no tertiary pattern 5 
(p=0.000802). Patients with bilateral SVI are more likely to have bilateral LN metastasis (p=0.046903), and patients with unilateral 
SVI have a higher likelihood of ipsilateral LN metastasis (p=<0.00001). These findings are important for risk stratification, and may 
also guide post-operative lymph node sampling strategies for patients who initially have radical prostatectomy without lymph node 
dissection.

Background: Cribriform morphology (CM) in prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens is known to be associated with 
adverse clinical outcomes. CM can be present in invasive cribriform carcinoma (ICC) as well as intraductal carcinoma (IDC). 
Although they are pathologically distinct entities, the prognostic value of each component has not been studied in detail. In this 
study, we evaluated the prognostic heterogeneity of prostate cancers presenting with CM in pretreatment biopsies, using 
comprehensive immunostaining to rigorously distinguish between ICC and IDC. 
Design: We surveyed consecutive patients who had undergone prostate biopsy at our institution from 2017-2021 and identified 
370 cases of Grade Group 2-5 cancer from the pathology database. We then performed immunohistochemical staining with 
p63/AMACR cocktail antibodies on all cores in each case, and two urologic pathologists independently reviewed and evaluated the 
presence of ICC and/or IDC. 
Results: We classified the patient cohort into four groups: G1 [ICC-/IDC-; n=239], G2 [ICC+/IDC-; n=66], G3 [ICC-/IDC+; n=34], G4 
[ICC+/IDC+; n=31]. Patients with CM had significantly longer tumors and higher Grade Groups. In Kaplan-Meier analysis by log-
rank test, both disease-specific survival (DSS) and progression-free survival after prostatectomy were in the order G1>G2>G3>G4, 
with a significant difference in DSS between G1 and G2-G4 (P<0.001), but not between G2 and G3 (P=0.088) or G3 and G4 
(P=0.978). Multivariate analysis with Cox regression model (G1 as a reference) showed significance for DSS in G3 (hazard ratio 
6.250, P=0.003) and G4 (hazard ratio 14.940, P<0.001) with IDC, but not in G2 with ICC alone (hazard ratio 3.317, P=0.059).

Conclusions: Despite the limitation of the relatively short follow-up period, our results suggest that evaluating biopsy specimens, 
along with for the presence of IDC when CM is present may be useful for better risk stratification.

Background: Eosinophilic solid and cystic renal cell carcinoma (ESC RCC) has been recently described as a unique and indolent 
renal neoplasm, with or without tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The morphologic variation and molecular profile of this relatively 
novel neoplasm is still evolving. To address this, we sought to elucidate the somatic and germline genomic alterations in a 
contemporary cohort of ESC RCC from various institutions. 
 
  
 
S800 
Design: Because of the rarity of this tumor, we performed a multi-institutional collaboration to comprehend the overarching clinical, 
gross, microscopic, and immunohistochemical profile of 13 ESC RCC from multiple institutions. Genomics was done using targeted 
next generation sequencing to detect small nucleotide variants/substitutions, small indels (insertions and/or deletions) and copy 
number variations in 324 cancer-associated genes. The panel was based on Illumina® Hi Seq 4000 platform. 
Results: The results are illustrated in figures 1 and 2. There was a female preponderance (F:M=2.3:1) and the patients' age 
ranged from 11 to 60 years with a median of 27 years. None of the patients had clinical features of TSC.  Three patients had a 
history of a prior neoplasm (pilocytic astrocytoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and low-grade urothelial carcinoma). All the patients 
had unifocal renal tumors. Twelve patients were of stage pT1 (pT1a=6; pT1b=6) and one patient had stage pT2a.  Classical 
histology of ESC RCC was observed in all tumors. The tumors exhibited PAX8+/CK20+/CD10+ with variable Cathepsin K and 
AMACR staining; Ki-67 indices were low; SDHB and FH were retained. Ten patients on follow up were alive without evidence of 
disease progression or metastasis (3-34 months). All the 13 tumors harbored somatic genomic alterations (Figure 1 and 2). 
Germline testing in 6 patients was negative.  
Figure 1 - 807 
 
Figure 2 - 807 
 
 
  
 
S801 
Conclusions: ESC RCC appears to be a unique keratin 20 positive renal neoplasm with a female preponderance having an 
indolent clinical course and harbors characteristic TSC1/2 gene mutation. They appear histologically identical to a subset of renal 
neoplasms seen in TSC patients, but in this study they were found in a sporadic setting. The molecular signature of ESC RCC in 
our study identified a distinct oncogenic PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation in three patients.

Background: The pT1 subclassification has been shown to be a prognosticator for T1 bladder cancer (BCa), although it is often 
challenging owing to fragmentation and cauterization in conventional transurethral resection of bladder tumor (cTURBT) specimen. 
En bloc resection of bladder tumor (ERBT) is a relatively novel method in which BCa is resected in en bloc manner with 
surrounding bladder tissue. The ERBT has been known as better diagnostic feasibility and accuracy in pT1 
subclassification compared to cTURBT. Here, we examined prognostic value of pT1 subclassification in ERBT specimen.  
Design: A total of 106 T1 BCa patients who underwent ERBT from 2013 to 2021 was adopted. The pT1 substages were assigned 
by three different subclassification methods: muscularis mucosae (MM) method dividing cases into tumors with invasion above and 
into/beyond MM; depth of invasion (DOI) method dividing cases into tumor with single invasive focus of DOI <0.5mm and others; 
papillary stalk (PS) method dividing cases into tumors with invasion confined to and beyond PS. Inter-group difference of 
progression- (PFS) and recurrence- (RFS) free survival rate were analyzed by log-rank test. Then, prognostic value of 
clinicopathological factors for progression/recurrence were analyzed by univariate/multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression 
analysis. 
Results: The pT1 substage was evaluable in all cases. Tumors with invasion into/beyond MM and those beyond PS were 
associated with worse PFS (P=0.002 and 0.010, respectively; Figure 1 and 2). Notably, cases with invasion confined to PS did not 
presented progression during 23 months of median follow-up period. Difference was not shown between two substages of DOI 
method. In the multivariate analysis, only MM method was an independent prognosticator of progression (P=0.033). All three 
different pT1 subclassification methods did not predict recurrence. 
Figure 1 - 808 
 
Figure 2 - 808 
 
Conclusions: The pT1 subclassification by MM method was shown to be a strong prognosticator of disease progression in the 
ERBT specimen. The PS method which can detect better prognostic group is another candidate for clinical application. The 
ERBT with accurate pT1 subclassification for T1 BCa patients will contribute to appropriate postoperative planning.

Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is currently recommended for muscle-invasive bladder cancer and may result in 
absence of gross tumor. Presently, gross examination and reporting protocols do not include standard guidance on the approach to 
these post-NAC specimens. 
Design: A Qualtrics survey to evaluate gross examination and reporting practices for post-NAC cystectomy specimens was 
disseminated via email and Twitter. Only US pathologists and Pathologists’ Assistants (PAs) responses were included in the final 
results. The survey interrogated demographics, practice settings, approach to gross examination, block selection, and reporting 
practices. 
Results: The survey received 46 responses (13 PAs, 27 pathologists, 6 Other) with broad representation by geographic location, 
with most pathologists having urologic pathology fellowship training (63%). Based on respondents’ experience, identifying gross 
tumor occurs less frequently than tumor bed/ulcer (39% vs. 69%). Lack of identification of any gross lesions was estimated to occur 
in 31% of cases. Grossing practices were relatively consistent in cases with residual gross tumor or gross tumor bed, with 
agreement that gross tumor should be submitted 1 block/centimeter (64%) and tumor bed should be submitted entirely (97%). 
However, grossing practices appeared more varied when no gross lesions are identified (Figure 1). It was uncommon (21%) for 
final staging to be determined based on random sections. Pathologists reported microscopic pathologic complete response (ypT0) 
in 48% of cases, and for these, most pathologists selected yes or maybe (83%) when asked if they request and submit additional 
sections of bladder. Overall, most responders definitely or maybe support a standardized grossing (88%) and reporting (96%) 
protocol. 
Figure 1 - 809 
 
Conclusions: With the increased use of NAC, lack of any gross lesion occurs in approximately 1/3rd of cystectomies post-
treatment. The most consistent grossing practices in post-NAC specimens were seen when gross tumor or tumor bed were 
present, but less consistency was seen when no gross lesion was identified. Lack of standardization can lead to inconsistent 
grossing techniques and uncertainty regarding best practices for cases with no gross lesion or presumed pathologic complete 
response. Standardization of grossing and reporting protocols should be considered for post-NAC cases, with guidance for 
sampling when no gross lesion is present, while also focusing on conservative submission of blocks when unlikely to change stage.

Background: Somatic tumor testing in prostate cancer (PCa) can guide treatment options by identifying clinically actionable 
variants, including acquired variants not detected by germline testing alone. While testing is most often initiated in the metastatic 
setting, there is currently limited data on the yield and value of routine testing outside of this context. This study describes the first 
year experience of somatic PCa testing at a tertiary center, including pathologist-driven reflex testing of non-metastatic tumors at 
primary diagnosis.  
Design: For our reflex pathway, all primary tumors with Grade Groups (GG) ≥3 and GG2 tumors with cribriform/intraductal 
morphology were tested.  Non-reflex cases included institutional historical cases with clinical progression and referrals.  Specimens 
meeting criteria were sequenced with a custom enrichment hybrid capture NGS panel (Illumina platform). Variant calls were 
generated using a custom bioinformatics pipeline, and for those meeting quality thresholds, the AMP/ASCO/CAP standards and 
guidelines were used for variant interpretation. Pathology characteristics and genetic results were collated.  
Results: To date, 280 cases have been tested, comprising prostate biopsies (64%), radical prostatectomies (25%), metastatic 
biopsies (8%) and TURPs (3%).  Tumors with GG5 (31%) and GG3 (29%) were the predominant groups, followed by GG2 (24%) 
and GG4 (15%). Approximately a third of patients had at least one Tier I, II or III variant.  Of these 28% were Tier I/II 
(actionable/potentially actionable) variants, of which 82% were detected in ATM (31%), BRCA1 (11%) or BRCA2 (40%). Only 10% 
of Tier I/II were detected in the MMR genes (mostly MSH2 and MSH6). Copy number loss was detected in 40% of cases, of which 
half were in BRCA2.  Tier I/II variants were most frequently detected in GG5 tumors (48%), followed by GG3 (28%), GG2 (12%) 
and GG4 (8%).  Among 171 in-house reflex tests performed on hormone naive primaries, 25% contained a variant. Overall, 5% of 
this unique subgroup contained a Tier I/II variant - GG2 (4%), GG3 (2%), GG4 (5%) and GG5 (7%).  
Conclusions: Our findings confirm the utility of somatic tumor testing to detect variants of clinical significance in PCa. Of interest, 
reflex testing on hormone naïve primary non-metastatic PCa identified variants in 25% of the cases, including a subset of 
intermediate risk cases with potentially actionable variants requiring follow-up germline testing. Further analysis on a larger cohort 
of cases is ongoing. 
 
811   Primitive Soft Tissue Neoplasms of the Penis: Our Thirty-Years Experience

Disclosures: Sascia Pietro Servillo: None; Giancarlo Pruneri: None; Nicola Nicolai: None; Maurizio Colecchia: None 
Background: Primitive urogenital sarcomas are rare tumors, accounting for less than 5% of all sarcomas. They occur in the para 
testis, kidney, bladder, and prostate. Penile sarcomas are exceptionally rare, usually described in case-reports or small case 
series. To date, only one comprehensive study including 46 cases was published in 1970. Here we describe a series of 18 primitive 
penile sarcomas collected in the last thirty years at our institution. 
Design: Consecutive primitive penile neoplasms diagnosed from 1990 to 2020 were identified in the Pathology archive. All cases 
were reviewed by two experienced pathologists and adjunctive immunohistochemical and molecular analyses were performed 
when paraffin blocks were available. Clinico-pathological data were collected and updated including disease-free and overall 
survival data. 
Results: Among 1150 penile neoplasms, we found 18 (1,5%) penile soft tissue tumors. Four were hemangiomas. Following the 
revision, the diagnoses of the malignant neoplasms were as follows: Kaposi sarcoma (4 cases), epithelioid angiosarcoma (1), 
“proximal-type” epithelioid sarcomas (3), myogenic sarcomas (2), dedifferentiated liposarcoma (1), low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma 
(1), and synovial sarcoma (1). One more case previously diagnosed as epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is currently under further 
investigation (the alternative diagnosis is epithelioid hemangioma). Most (10) of these cases were internal, while 4 were received 
for second opinion. The age range was 20-89 years. Clinical data were retrieved for the 10 inpatients: 2 patients underwent radical 
penectomy, 1 partial penectomy, 4 local excisions, and 3 patients only received chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The follow-up 
 
  
 
S804 
range was 7-217 months (updated to January 2022): 3 patients died for the disease, 2 were alive without disease, 2 were alive with 
disease, 1 died for other causes, and 2 were lost to follow-up.

Conclusions: Penile soft tissue neoplasms affect all ages. They are often misdiagnosed both clinically (an induration mimicking 
Peyronie’s disease) and histologically (granulomatous appearance in epithelioid sarcomas mimicking chronic inflammation, 
epithelioid morphology resembling a carcinoma). The absence of intraepithelial penile neoplasia, a true primitivity in the penis, and 
the presence of urinary symptoms are clues for the diagnosis. Most cases are vascular neoplasms and epithelioid sarcomas, in line 
with the previous observations. Here we describe the first case of penile dedifferentiated liposarcoma.

812   Review of the Clinicopathological Correlation and Survival Data of Genitourinary 
Liposarcoma

Disclosures: Nada Shaker: None; Nuha Shaker: None; Swati Satturwar: None; Anil Parwani: None 
Background: Genitourinary sarcomas (GUSs) are rarely encountered in the genitourinary tract and account for less than 1% of all 
malignant neoplasms. Among GUSs, liposarcoma is a major contributor to mesenchymal lesions in this anatomic location. We aim 
to analyze the burden of liposarcoma among GUSs and evaluate their overall survival. 
Design: Data of 61 patients were queried over a period of seven years (2015-2022) from The Ohio State University Wexner 
Medical Center to identify cases of primary GU liposarcomas. Pathology reports from patients with liposarcoma were extracted and 
data on tumor characteristics were collected.  
Results:  A total of 61 cases of GUSs were identified, out of which, 28/61 (45%) liposarcoma cases were retrieved. Liposarcoma 
preferentially involves the testicular region 25/28 (89%) followed by the kidney 3/28 (10%). The testicular region included 
specimens from: 10/28 (35%) scrotum, 6/28 (21%) para-testicular, 4/28 (14%) spermatic cord, 3/28 (10%) para-testicular and 
testicular, and 2/28 (7%). The tumor size range was 2.8 – 30.6 cm. The median follow-up time, available for 20 patients, was 31.5 
months with a mean of 66.1 months. Well-differentiated (WDL) 9/28 (32%) and de-differentiated liposarcomas (DDL) 19/28 (67%) 
were the only histologic types in the genitourinary tract. No LVI or PNI was noted. Regional lymph node involvement was identified 
in one case of DDL of the scrotum.  Local recurrence was noted in 14/28 (50%) of cases. Recurrence was not restricted to cases 
with positive margins. Distant metastases to the adrenal, lung, skin, and ureter were observed in 4/28 (14%) of patients. 
Remarkably, the scrotum was the origin of 3/4 (75%) of the metastasis.  At the time of the last review, 5/28 (17%) patients were 
deceased, three of whom had either metastasis or recurrence 3/5 (60%). DDL was the prominent diagnosis in all deceased 
patients. The mean overall survival was 23.8 months. 
Table 1 summarize the clinicopathological records of 28 patients diagnosed with genitourinary liposarcoma 
 
Conclusions: Liposarcoma of the genitourinary tract is most frequently encountered within the testicular region. Noteworthy, DDL 
is the most frequently identified in the testicular region and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis and overall survival.

Disclosures: Khalid Shittu: None; Oudai Hassan: None; Nilesh Gupta: None; Khaleel Al-Obaidy: None 
Background: The detection of adenocarcinoma extending into the adipose tissue signifies extraprostatic tumour extension and 
therefore pT3a stage category. However, the presence of intraprostatic adipose tissue, albeit rare, had put some reluctance on 
such diagnosis and subsequently staging on needle biopsy specimens. In the present study, we aimed at evaluating cases of 
prostatic adenocarcinoma diagnosed with extraprostatic extension (i.e. extension into adipose tissue) and comparing the pathologic 
stage category (T) to that of the resection specimen from the same patient. 
Design: The pathology electronic archive from department of Pathology at our institution was searched for needle core biopsies 
with a diagnosis of extraprostatic extension (i.e. extension into adipose tissue) between 2015 and 2022. All cases with such 
diagnosis were retrieved and cases with subsequent prostatectomy were included.  Our system utilizes a subspecialty sign out 
system and cases were signed out by urologic pathologists. 
Results: One-fifty-eight (158) needle core biopsy cases with the diagnosis of extraprostatic extension (i.e. extension into adipose 
tissue) were identified in our electronic databases. Of these, 38 cases had subsequent radical prostatectomy in our system within 6 
months of the EPE diagnosis.  The grade group of these cases were 2 (n=8; 21%), 3 (n=13; 34%) and 5 (n=17; 45%). All 38 cases 
diagnosed with EPE on biopsy were found to have EPE on resection (concordant rate is 100%). Of these, the pathologic stage 
category pT3a in 12 cases (32%), pT3b in 14 cases (63%) and pT4 in 2 cases (invading adjacent organs on resection; 
5%). Additionally, of the remaining 120 cases without follow-up prostatectomy, 6 patients had biopsy confirmed metastases to the 
liver (2), brain (1), spinal cord (1), lymph node (1) and bone (1). 
Conclusions: Our findings signifies the importance of diagnosing extraprostatic extension in needle core biopsies. Interestingly, 
most of the cases (68%) had a higher pT stage category on follow-up resections, and 6 cases had documented metastasis.

Disclosures: Deepika Sirohi: None; Yeonjung Jo: None; Beatrice Knudsen: None 
Background: We previously demonstrated that histological growth patterns (HGPs) can be used to grade clear cell renal cell 
carcinoma (CCRCC) as accurately as WHO/ISUP nuclear grade and that HGPs are predictive of disease outcomes. Herein, we 
investigate genomic pathway dysregulation related to HGPs in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database.  
Design: We analyzed cases from the TCGA CCRCC cohort (n=416) that correspond to established diagnostic criteria of combined 
morphological and molecular data for ccRCC. Digital slides were separated into 3 HGP grade groups (HGP-GG) based on HGP 
subtype and nuclear grade as: HGP-GG1: small nests, expansile nests, nests with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio; HGP-GG2: 
tubular and/or papillary, HGP-GG 3: sarcomatoid, rhabdoid, low grade spindled (LGS), fused nests (FN) and pleomorphic tumor 
giant cells. RNA expression data in c-Bioportal were used to identify dysregulated pathways in each case. Chi square test was 
used to determine the significance of frequencies of dysregulated pathways between pairwise groups of HGP-GGs. Univariate and 
multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine whether dysregulated pathways are 
predictive of overall survival (OS) across all cases and within specific HGP-GGs.  
Results: PI3K pathway was dysregulated in HGP-GG 3 compared to HGP-GG 2 (adjusted p-value 0.002). Across all cases, RTK-
RAS-PI3K pathway (HR=0.68, p=0.034) and NOTCH signaling pathway (HR=0.53, p=0.003) dysregulation were associated with 
longer OS. This result was most significant in HGP-GG2 tumors. In tumors with sarcomatoid and rhabdoid features, alterations in 
apoptotic and Hippo pathways were associated with longer OS (HR=0.05, p=0.06 each), while activation of TGFB pathway 
predicted shorter OS (HR=11.8, p=0.02). In tumors with FN and LGS HGPs, dysregulated BRCA2 signaling was predictive of 
shorter OS (HR=13.73, p=0.02). Finally, dysregulated WNT signaling showed a trend towards shorter OS in HGP-GG2 (HR=0.55, 
p=0.07).  
Conclusions: HGP-based grade groups of CCRCC express dysregulated pathways that are predictive of OS. We confirmed the 
expected dysregulation of the TGFB pathway in tumors with mesenchymal differentiation and phenotypes of sarcomatoid and 
rhabdoid HGPs. Data reveals additional associations between molecular alterations leading to pathway dysregulation and 
morphologic characteristics of HGPs.

815   Overexpression of UBE2C Correlates to Immune Infiltration and Poor Prognosis: A Potential 
Prognostic Biomarker and Promoting Therapeutic Target for Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma

Hospital Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, China, 3Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing, China 
Disclosures: Qingyang Sun: None; Yao Fu: None; Xiangshan Fan: None 
Background: UBE2C is a protein coding gene and its protein product involves the modification of proteins with ubiquitin, an 
important cellular mechanism for targeting abnormal or short-lived proteins for degradation. Contributions to tumor pathogenesis of 
overexpression by UBE2C have been discovered in several cancers, such as lung cancer, breast cancer. However, the correlation 
of UBE2C and papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) remains unclear. In this study, we tend to identify the underlying impact 
of UBE2C expression on PRCC. 
Design: Using public databases, we analyzed the gene expression status of UBE2C and explored the relevance of its expression 
level to patients prognosis. And we performed UBE2C immunohistochemical(IHC) staining on tumor tissues of PRCC cases in our 
department to further its overexpression in PRCC. We continued gene oncology and gene set enrichment analysis(GSEA) to 
identify potential biological functions of UBE2C. Finally, we explored whether expression level correlates to immune infiltration 
status and corresponding miRNA level. Finally, given the risks we identified above, we designed a prognosis model to predict 
outcomes of patients suffering from PRCC. 
Results: Expression level of UBE2C was much higher in tumor tissues than in normal ones, and even in tumor samples, its 
expression level in higher stages exceeded that in lower stages, while higher expression level appeared worse patients prognosis 
in PRCC as well. We further validated UBE2C overexpression in PRCC cases in our department by IHC staining, with tumor 
samples displaying stronger IHC staining. GSEA results revealed UBE2C involved in chromosome organization, mitotic cell cycle, 
mitotic cell cycle process, negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II and nerve system process. UBE2C high-
expression expression group, on contract to low-expression group, tended to show higher immune infiltration reactions and higher 
IDO1 expression level. Then, high-expression group of UBE2C in our study showed high corresponding upstream miRNAs level. 
When came to the prognosis model we constructed, it could efficiently predict patients overall survivals of different expression 
groups under situations of >2years, >3years and >5years.

Disclosures: Jerasit Surintrspanont: None; Khalid Algarrahi: None; Elizabeth Genega: None; Ming Zhou: None 
Background: The classification of renal oncocytic tumors has undergone significant revision in recent years with more precise 
diagnostic criteria and discovery of novel and emerging entities, which is reflective of the clinical behavior and genetics. Using the 
2022 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Urinary and Male Genital Tumors, this study attempts to reclassify “pink” 
renal tumors and determine the impact of the new classification system. 
Design: Fifty-six renal neoplasms with the diagnoses of renal oncocytoma (RO), chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC), 
oncocytic renal tumor, NOS (OT NOS), and unclassified RCC with “oncocytic features” from 50 patients, between 2010 and 2020, 
were retrieved from the surgical pathology file at the authors’ institution. H&E and immunohistochemical (IHC) slides were 
reviewed; additional IHC stains were performed if alternative diagnoses were considered. The IHC panel for working up oncocytic 
tumors included CK7, CK20, vimentin, CD117, Cathepsin K, SDHB, and FH. The final diagnoses were made based on morphology 
and IHC profiles. 
Results: Twenty tumors were reclassified (20/56 = 36%): 6 RO were reclassified as OT NOS; 6 ChRCC were reclassified as 
unclassified RCC (2), suspicious for TSC/MTOR-mutated RCC (1), and low grade oncocytic tumor (LOT) (3); 6 OT NOS were 
 
  
 
S809 
reclassified as RO (2), ChRCC (1), eosinophilic vacuolated tumor (EVT) (1), suspicious for TSC/MTOR-mutated RCC (1), and 
eosinophilic solid cytstic RCC (ESC RCC) (1); and 2 unclassified RCC from the same patient were reclassified as ESC RCC. 
Eleven cases remained unclassified: OT NOS (9) and unclassified RCC (2). During a median follow up time of 78.7 months (range: 
16.2-147.7 months), most patients had no evidence of disease (44/50 = 88%); 2 were alive with disease (2/50 = 4%): ChRCC and 
OT NOS; 1 patient died of other causes (1/50 = 2%); and 3 patients were lost to follow up (3/50 = 6%).

Conclusions: This study showed that the 2022 WHO criteria have a significant impact on the classification of renal oncocytic 
tumors. Some of the previously unclassifiable oncocytic renal tumors can now be diagnosed as specific entities. It is important to 
recognize these tumors as many of them have indolent or benign behavior, and some of them may occur in genetic syndrome. A 
significant proportion of tumors would require additional tests to be further classified. This study also shows that a panel of IHC 
stains can aid the classification of oncocytic tumors in routine clinical practice. 
 
817   BAP1 is the Most Common Disrupted Gene in VHL Mutation-negative Advanced Clearcell 
Renal Cell Carcinoma

Background: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common renal malignant neoplasm in adults, and advanced 
stage of ccRCC is associated with poor prognosis. Approximately 90% of ccRCC is caused by VHL gene abnormalities such as 
gene mutation, 3p loss and hypermethylation, which leads to uncontrolled activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) and a 
number of HIF targets including vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) and carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX). However, 
approximately 10% of ccRCC cases do not have VHL gene abnormalities, thus VHL independent oncogenic mechanism must be 
involved. 
Design: We retrospectively reviewed morphologically diagnosed ccRCC with advanced pathological stage (pT3 or greater) 
between January 2021 and July 2022, and analyzed VHL gene mutation status and additional 161 commonly mutated genes in 
cancer by targeted next generation sequencing (Oncomine testing). To prove whether HIF pathway is indeed activated, 
immunohistochemical analysis for CAIX was performed and only diffuse box-like membranous staining pattern is considered to be 
positive. Tumor size, nuclear grade (WHO/ISUP), lymphovascular invasion, presence of sarcomatoid and rhabdoid features were 
also analyzed. 
Results: We identified 68 cases of advanced ccRCC. The diagnosis was confirmed by histological morphology and positive 
immunoreactivity for CAIX. Among these cases, 60 cases (88%) were found to have VHL mutations, and 8 cases (12%) were 
negative for VHL gene mutations. The Oncomine analysis for these 8 cases revealed that BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) 
gene abnormality was identified in 4 cases (50%); one case of BAP1 p.T111Pfs*2, three cases of BAP1 copy number loss. Other 
 
  
 
S810 
gene abnormalities include ARID1A, SETD2, PTEN, TERT and p53. In contrast, BAP1 abnormality was found in 26.6 % of VHL 
mutation-positive ccRCC. As shown in Table, The VHL mutation-negative ccRCC tends to have milder features compared to VHL 
mutation-positive ccRCC, such example includes nuclear grade, sarcomatoid/rhabdoid features and the average tumor size.

Conclusions: We identified BAP1 gene is the most common abnormality in VHL mutation-negative ccRCC. BAP1 loss has been 
reported to alter cell metabolism toward anaerobic glycolysis and allow cancer cells to survive in hypoxic conditions (often called 
Warburg effect). Our data suggest BAP1 alteration may be another route to activate HIF pathway in the context of no VHL 
abnormality in ccRCC. Further molecular analysis is warranted. 
 
818   Impact of Grading Small Tumor Volumes with Gleason Pattern 4, with an Emphasis on Global 
Biopsy Scoring

Disclosures: Ingrid Tam: None; Andres Acosta: None; Michelle Hirsch: None; Karan Vats: None; Nicholas Baniak: None 
Background: The Gleason Score/Grade Group (GS/GrGr) is an important factor in therapeutic decision making for prostatic 
adenocarcinoma (PCa). However, in core biopsies (CBx) with limited tumor volumes, grading small areas of PCa is difficult; this is 
especially challenging with small tumor foci containing Gleason pattern 4 (GP4), which may lead to erroneous upgrading of cases. 
The terminology ‘small GP4’ was introduced by the BWH group in 2019, with cores being diagnosed as "small focus of PCa, not 
amenable to precise Gleason grading; however, GP4 is present". Reports have been conflicting on the impact of grading small foci 
of PCa in terms of correlation with grading radical prostatectomies (RP). The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of 
grading small tumor volumes containing GP4, particularly in the context of global CBx scoring. 
Design: We retrospectively reviewed 503 matched prostate CBx and RP specimens between 2014 and 2022. Only cases with at 
least 12 cores were included. For each CBx, the number of positive cores, the maximum percent of core involved, the highest 
GrGr, and global GrGr was recorded. Cores with less than 1mm of tumor or less than 10% involvement containing GP4 were 
designated as small GP4 (SmGP4); any core with GrGr5 was excluded. 
Results: We identified 42 CBx cases (8.3%) with SmGP4 in one of the cores. In 20 cases (3.9%), SmGP4 corresponded to the 
core with the highest grade in the case. If grading according to the relative volume of GP4, 14 (70%) would have been over-graded 
compared to the final grade in the RP, 4 (20%) would have been concordant, and 2 (10%) would have been under-graded. SmGP4 
was the only focus of PCa in only 4 cases (0.8%), affecting both the highest and global GrGr. In the remaining 16 CBx cases, 
assigning a GS/GrGr rather than a designation of SmGP4 did not change the global GrGr. Of the 4 cases where the global GrGr 
would be changed, 2 (50%) would be over-graded compared to the RP, 1 (25%) would have been concordant, and 1 (25%) would 
have been under-graded. As a small comparison group, in CBx cases with only 1 positive core and a tumor volume between 10 
and 20%, only 1/9 (11%) were over-graded compared to the RP, while 8/9 (89%) were concordant. 
Conclusions: Grading small foci of PCa containing GP4 has a minimal impact on the global GS/GrGr, but more often changes the 
highest GS/GrGr. When considering a highest-grade approach on CBx, these cases should be diagnosed descriptively, ex. 
SmGP4, rather than being assigned a GS/GrGr.

Background: Patient outcomes for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) based on high-risk Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) positivity at 
sites such as the head and neck are relatively well defined. However, limited data have been reported for penile SCC. Herein, 
therefore, we aimed to study the prevalence of high-risk HPV positivity in patients with penile SCC and to evaluate relevant 
clinicopathologic features including tumor morphology, pathologic stage, and outcomes based on HPV status. 
Design: A single institutional pathology archive was interrogated for patients who underwent a partial or total penectomy for SCC 
between 2000 and 2021. Clinicopathologic variables were evaluated by chart review and corresponding H&E-stained slides were 
evaluated by 4 pathologists blinded to the original diagnosis and HPV status. High-risk HPV positivity was established based on a 
combination of histology, P16 immunohistochemistry (IHC), DNA in situ hybridization (ISH, low and high-risk genotypes), and/or 
RNA ISH (E6/7 transcripts in high risk genotypes). In addition, IHC (22c3 clone) was performed to determine PD-L1 status in 
invasive tumors. 
Results: The clinicopathologic features of 120 consecutive patients treated with penectomy are outlined in Table 1. Histologic 
evaluation had a sensitivity of approximately 97% (115/119) in correctly predicting HPV status when compared to ancillary testing 
(IHC/ISH). PD-L1 IHC was performed in 106 cases and showed a mean combined positivity score (CPS) of 7.9 (0 – 90), and a 
mean h-score of 12 (0 – 220). Follow-up was available for 102 patients with >=pT1 tumors. Our results show that compared to 
patients with high-risk HPV-positive tumors, those with HPV-negative tumors had an older age at penectomy, larger tumor size, 
and higher PD-L1 CPS (mean values listed; age at penectomy: 70.2 vs 64.4 years; size: 3.7 vs 2.8 cm; CPS: 9 vs 3.3; p<.05). 
However, no significant differences in outcome based on HPV status were identified when patients were stratified based on 
pathologic stage. Finally, 8 patients had grossly multifocal lesions and had an aggressive clinical course (cancer-specific mortality 
in 4/8 patients).

Disclosures: Yuki Teramoto: None; Numbereye Numbere: None; Ying Wang: None; Hiroshi Miyamoto: None 
Background: The presence of extraprostatic extension (EPE), including bladder neck and seminal vesicle invasion, does not 
uniformly indicate poor clinical outcomes in men with prostate cancer. Accordingly, further risk stratification of the current pT3 
disease is required. Indeed, we have recently demonstrated the prognostic significance of either nonfocal/established EPE (E-EPE) 
or microscopic bladder neck invasion (mBNI) vs. both, the absence vs. presence of the current pT3a lesions in the current pT3b 
disease, and unilateral (Uni) vs. bilateral (Bil) seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), as well as comparable prognosis between focal EPE 
(F-EPE) only vs. mBNI only. The present study aims to further determine the clinical impact of these pT3 lesions (i.e. F-EPE, E-
EPE, mBNI, Uni-SVI, Bil-SVI) and their combinations in radical prostatectomy (RP) cases. 
Design: We assessed consecutive 1,223 patients who had undergone RP without neoadjuvant therapy at our institution from 2009 
to 2018. Based on our previous findings, the following points were given (1 point to F-EPE, mBNI, or Uni-SVI; 2 points to E-EPE or 
Bil-SVI) and summed up in each case. 
Results: The cases had 1 point (n=258, 21.1%; P1), 2 points (n=666, 54.5%; P2), 3 points (n=189, 15.5%; P3), 4 points (n=78, 
6.4%; P4), and 5 points (n=32, 2.6%; P5). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the prognosis was worse in the following order: P1, 
P2, P3, P4, and P5, and that the differences in progression-free survival (PFS) between any two groups, except P4 vs. P5, were 
statistically significant. When P4 and P5 were combined, significant differences in PFS were also seen in subgroups of patients, 
such as those with pN0 disease and those without adjuvant therapy immediately after RP. When RP findings (e.g. tumor grade, 
lymph node metastasis, surgical margin, estimated tumor volume) were compared, significant differences were observed in all 
except surgical margin status in P1 vs. P2 patients. In multivariate analysis with Cox regression model (P1 as a reference), P2 
(HR=1.939, P<0.001), P3 (HR=2.569, P<0.001), and P4/P5 (HR=3.615, P<0.001) showed significance for progression.

Conclusions: We believe these data provide a logical rationale for a novel subclassification, pT3a (1 point), pT3b (2 points), pT3c 
(3 points), and pT3d (4 or 5 points), which more accurately stratifies the prognosis of pT3 prostate cancer. Further studies, ideally 
prospectively designed, are warranted to validate our results.

Disclosures: Wei Tian: None; Ji Yoon Yoon: None; Karen Shore: None; Anuradha Singhal: None; Franto Francis: None 
Background: TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion is the most common genetic rearrangement in prostatic adenocarcinomas (PCa), with a 
reported rate of about 50%. ERG nuclear expression detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is considered a surrogate for 
TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. The multiplex antibody panel PIN4ERG (p63/CK903, AMACR, and ERG) is a useful cocktail for PCa 
diagnosis and is routinely used in our high-volume urologic pathology practice. This study aimed to identify if certain morphologic 
features of PCa were associated with ERG protein expression. 
Design: We assessed prostate biopsy cases with cancer diagnoses and available PIN4ERG IHC signed out by three urologic 
pathologists from April 2021 to August 2022. The IHCs were performed based on diagnostic necessity. Cancer morphology, 
Gleason Score/Grade Group, association with intraductal carcinoma (IDC-P), patient age, and PSA were collected. Histology was 
reviewed in consensus conferences. We defined five morphologic categories in this study: 1. Conventional/NOS morphology; 2. 
Marked amphophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic chromatin; 3. Abundant foamy or flocculent cytoplasm with basally located 
nuclei; 4. PIN-associated; 5 Atrophic features.     
Results: The study included 237 ERG-positive (41 heterogeneous expression) and 247 ERG-negative cases. PCa with ERG 
protein expression were diagnosed at a younger age than the ERG-negative group: mean 65.7 (range 34-83) vs 67.2 (range 47-
90) (P=0.039). PSA and Grade group distribution showed no significant differences between the two groups (p=0.128 and 0.058, 
respectively). Three morphologic features were associated with ERG protein expression: abundant foamy (Fig A-B, H&E, PIN4ERG 
IHC)/flocculent cytoplasm (Fig C-D) (49 cases, 20.6%), marked amphophilic cytoplasm (33, 13.9%) (Fig E-F), and PIN- associated 
(38, 16%) (Fig G-H), all with p <0.001. 10% of PCas with ERG protein expression were associated with IDC-P, significantly higher 
than in the ERG-negative group (2%, p=0.0001).    
Figure 1 - 821 
 
 
  
 
S814 
Conclusions: Our study is the largest cohort to date to identify morphologic features in PCa associated with ERG protein 
expression. We found that certain morphologic features have a higher propensity to show nuclear ERG expression, including 
abundant foamy/flocculent cytoplasm, marked amphophilic cytoplasm, and PIN-associated cancer. ERG-positive PCa were also 
more frequently associated with IDC-P. Our study may provide valuable information for pathologists when making diagnoses and 
considering additional ERG FISH or IHC testing.

Background: Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the urinary bladder is a rare and aggressive cancer. The correct diagnosis of this 
entity and its separation from poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma are a challenge for practicing pathologist 
and have important implication in patients' management and prognosis. The latest WHO classifications of urinary tract tumors, and 
of endocrine and neuroendocrine tumors provide updated diagnostic criteria that must be validated on clinical series. 
Design: The files of four different Italian Institution were searched for "neuroendocrine neoplasms" or "neoplasms with 
neuroendocrine differentiation" of the urinary bladder diagnosed between 2010 and 2020. 78 cases with available histopathological 
material were reviewed by expert uropathologists and endocrine pathologist and only 52 carcinomas with convincing small cell or 
large cell neuroendocrine morphology and immunohistochemical expression of at least two general neuroendocrine markers 
(among chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and INSM1) were defined as UB-NEC and included in the study. Data on clinical 
presentation, therapy and follow-up were collected and an extensive immunohistochemical study was performed, including 
transcription factors (CDX2, TTF1, SATB2, GATA3, p63), cytokeratins (CK 7, 19, 20), key cancer genes protein products (p53, Rb, 
p16), and PDL1. 
Results: Patients with UB-NEC were mostly elderly men and more than 50% had a smoking history. Large cell morphology was far 
less frequent than small cell (5 out of 52). 28 of 52 UB-NECs were mixed neuroendocrine/non-neuroendocrine neoplasms 
(MiNEN), with a morphologically evident non-neuroendocrine component. The sensitivity and specificity of INSM1 were overlapping 
with those of synaptophysin. The comparison between the two components of MiNENs highlighted that GATA3 and p63 were 
consistently absent in NEC, as well as CK20, whereas abnormal expression of p53, Rb, and p16 was mostly observed in NEC. 
SATB2 was frequently expressed in NEC. PDL1 expression was present in NECs, although to a lesser extent than in non-
NEC. The survival analysis showed a worse outcome for patients with pure NEC, compared with MiNENs. Neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy resulted in prolonged survival. 
Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that the employment of strict morphological and immunohistochemical diagnostic criteria 
identifies UB-NEC as a defined entities, with distinct prognosis an provides clues for differential diagnosis of difficult cases as well 
as for predicting response to therapy.

Background: In the 5th edition of the WHO classification of renal tumors, recently described tumor entities and/or subtypes have 
been added. One of these is the biphasic squamoid alveolar renal cell carcinoma (BSARCC). This tumor is characterized by the 
presence of two cell populations: large squamoid cells with different growth patterns, and small cells with a papillary/alveolar 
architecture. To date there have been around 65 cases of BSARCC reported. 
Design: We carried out a retrospective study of 1771 renal tumors from the files of our hospital from 2000 to 2021. From 219 
previously diagnosed papillary renal cell carcinomas (PRCC), we selected those that showed at least areas with a morphology 
consistent with BSARCC. The clinical and pathologic data were reviewed in detail, and the expression of PAX-8, CK7, CK20, EMA, 
CD10, AMACR, vimentin, e-cadherin, CAIX, Cyclin D1 and ki67 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) was evaluated in both small and 
large cells using paraffin-embedded tissue. 
 
  
 
S815 
Results: We found nine cases consistent with BSARCC. The median patient age was 62 years. Three patients were females and 
six were males. Four patients had end-stage renal disease. No recurrence, metastasis, or tumor-related death occurred in a mean 
follow-up period of 76 months. None of the patients had a family history of RCC. Seven patients underwent a partial nephrectomy. 
Tumor size ranged from 1.5 to 6 cm. Three of the patients had multiple tumors. Grossly, most of the tumors were homogenous, 
soft, and well-demarcated; and five (5/9; 55%) cases had a fibrous capsule. All cases were pT1. The squamoid area-extend varied 
between 10 to 95% of the tumor. Emperipolesis was present in all cases. The large cells showed a higher ISUP/WHO histologic 
grade than the small cells. Four (4/9; 44%) cases showed psammomatous calcifications, and foamy histiocytes were present in all 
cases. None of the cases had either a sarcomatoid component or tumor necrosis. Both cell populations revealed diffuse expression 
of PAX-8, CK7, EMA, and AMACR by IHC. Cyclin D1 was positive only in the large cells (Fig. 1). Additionally, we found a papillary 
adenoma that showed the same morphology as this tumor. 
Figure 1 - 823 
 
Conclusions: BSARCC represented 4.1% (9/219 cases) of PRCC and 0.50% (9/1771) of all renal tumors during the 22-year 
period in our series. BSARCC shows two cell populations with different morphologies and immunophenotypes. All the patients in 
our study exhibited an indolent clinical course in a mean follow-up period of 76 months.

Parwani: None 
Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to facilitate diagnosis and reporting of prostate cancer. In this study, the impact 
of AI on the diagnostic efficiency (time spent establishing diagnosis) was evaluated. 
Design: 484 prostate biopsies (236 non-cancer; 248 cancer) were selected retrospectively from Boston and Ohio. Reference 
diagnosis was performed by senior pathologists. The resident pathologists performed diagnosis without AI in a cross over manner 
(Boston resident diagnosed WSIs from Ohio and vice versa). After 4 weeks, the AI was applied to predict suspicious cancer areas 
and the residents repeated diagnoses in a blinded manner. Time to establish diagnoses was recorded. 
Results: Time for diagnosis was 3.65 ± 1.75 minutes for Boston images and 2.67 ± 0.59 minutes for Ohio images. The time 
decreased with AI predictions (2.50 ± 1.75 minutes for Boston images, 1.65 ± 0.63 minutes for Ohio images, p < .00001). The time 
decrease is ~1 minute irrespective of slide type (benign or cancer). The largest time decrease (1.63 minutes/image) is seen for 
images where the resident was least confident initially; while the time decrease for images where the resident was confident was 
significantly lower (0.91 minute/image, p<.00001). The time is decreased for majority of WSIs (Figures 1 and 2). The time decrease 
is achieved without drop in performance (sensitivity and specificity).

Conclusions: With AI predictions, resident pathologists diagnosed WSIs significantly faster than without AI, without loss of 
performance. The time saving is likely facilitated by AI predictions and learning to effectively use the system.

Background: Evaluation of muscularis propria (MP) invasion in TURBT maybe challenging.  In this study we report on the findings 
in follow up TURBT in cases that were diagnosed as ambiguous for muscularis propria invasion at our institution. 
Design: All consecutive in-house TURBTs with the diagnosis of ambiguous for MP invasion from 2015 to 2022 were included. 
AMPMUS was defined as: either extensive carcinoma displaying small muscle bundles where it is hard to decide if those muscle 
bundles represent muscularis mucosae or MP (pattern1) or invasive carcinoma sitting adjacent to thick muscle bundles (pattern 2). 
No case with small cell carcinoma or prior therapy were included. All cases were double reviewed by specialized urologic 
pathologists. 
Results: Thirty cases were included. 19 (63%) cases with pattern 1 AMPMUS and 11 (37%) cases with pattern 2 
AMPMUS. Median patient age was 75 (53-92). The median number of follow up TURBT was 1 (1-6). The median period before the 
first follow up TURBT was 2 months (1-9). Of the 19 cases with pattern 1 AMPMUS 10 had follow TURBT, two went directly to 
cystectomy while seven patients had no follow up at our institution. Of the 10 cases with follow up TURBT 5 (50%) showed MP 
invasion, 1 (10%) showed Ta/T1 disease and 4 (40%) were negative on follow up. Of the two patients who went directly to 
cystectomy, one had muscle invasive disease on cystectomy and the other patient had no residual invasive carcinoma and only 
urothelial carcinoma in situ. Of the 11 patients with pattern 2 AMPMUS, 10 had follow TURBT and one went directly to cystectomy. 
Of the 10 patients with follow up TURBT, 4 (40%) had muscle invasive disease, 5 (50%) had Ta/T1 disease and 1 (10%) was still 
AMPMUS. The patient who went directly to cystectomy showed invasion into perivesical adipose tissue. No significant difference is 
seen between pattern 1 and pattern 2 AMPMUS. 
Conclusions: Although most patients with the diagnosis of non-muscle invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma undergo a follow 
up TURBT within 12 weeks.  7 (23%) of the 30 patients in our cohort did not get a follow up TURBT. Of the 23 AMPMUS patients 
 
  
 
S817 
who had follow-up at our institution, 11 (48%) had T2 disease or higher on first follow up. Our findings support that these patients 
with the diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma ambiguous for muscularis propria invasion are at high risk of having advanced pathologic 
stage and emphasize the importance of immediate follow up TURBT to appropriately stage these patients.

Background: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) comprises 3% of all malignant tumors. More than 61,000 new cases and 15,000 deaths 
are due to RCC in the US. It is frequently diagnosed in advance stage, thus the need for markers for early detection. MicroRNAs 
(miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs responsible for gene regulation at a post-transcriptional level. Exosomes present in biofluids, 
including urine, act as a transporting system for miRNAs. Recently, studies of urine have gained interest as a liquid biopsy because 
its easy sampling. Therefore, miRNA profile in the urinary exosomes of patients with RCC could serve as non-invasive biomarkers 
for initial detection and follow up. 
Design: A total of 31 cell-free urines (CFU) from patients with Von-Hippel-Lindau associated clear cell RCC (VHL-ccRCC) and the 
available FFPE tumor samples were collected previous patient’s consent from the Urologic Oncology Branch Clinic, at the NIH. 
Samples from healthy human donors were also included for comparison. After centrifugation, CFU were prepared for Exosome 
RNA Purification. The presence of exosomes was confirmed by Exo-Check Exosome Antibody Array (SBI) and Western Blots 
(abcam, exosome panel). RNA's were then analysed by Next-Generation Sequencing.  Clinico-pathological information was also 
evaluated. 
Results: Between 112 and 336 unique known miRNAs per sample were identified. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on 
miRNA expression showed two major clusters. The first group of cases showed highly expressed miRNAs contrasting with the 
second cluster that grouped mostly with the non-tumor samples and had downregulated miRNAs. Most upregulated miRNAs were 
miR200b-5p, 320b, 107 and 152-5p and the downregulated ones were miR291-5p, 342-5p, 378a-5p and 24-2-5p (fold change 2.3 
and -2.3). When we compared our results with miRNAs already known to be dysregulated in VHL-ccRCC (miR30c, 182-5p, 92a, 
210, 17-5p, 224, 28-5p 204 and 155); all of them with miR21 were also altered in a similar fashion. 
Conclusions: Our results show that most of the differentially expressed miRNAs have downstream target genes with important 
roles in the pathogenesis of RCC that are involved in pathways related to Hypoxia and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). 
These results also demonstrate the potential use of exosomal microRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosis, detection of 
tumor recurrence or progression, and possibly the evaluation of treatment response.

Background: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is currently the most sensitive and specific imaging technique 
for the detection of prostate cancer. However, approximately 20% of clinically significant prostate cancers are invisible by mpMRI. 
We hypothesize that the metabolomic profiles of prostate cancers determine their visibility on mpMRI. 
Design: By comparing mpMRI images with whole mount pathology analysis of prostatectomy specimens, we identified 12 patients 
each with both MRI-visible and MRI-invisible tumors in the prostate. Tissue cores were obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) prostatectomy tissue from areas of benign prostate glands, MRI-visible tumors, and MRI-invisible tumors. Polar 
metabolites were extracted and analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). 
Results: Characteristics of MRI-visible versus MRI-invisible tumors are included in Table 1. Compared to MRI-visible tumors, the 
MRI-invisible tumors are generally smaller in size and lower in Gleason grade. MRI-visible and MRI-invisible tumors show 
significant differences in the levels of 42 out of 300 metabolites. Enrichment analysis identified potential metabolic pathways that 
 
  
 
S818 
differ between MRI-visible and MRI-invisible tumors (Figure 1). Specifically, the polyamine levels are significantly lower in MRI-
visible tumors but comparable between benign prostate and MRI-invisible tumors (Figure 2).

Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the distinct metabolomic profiles of MRI-visible and MRI-invisible prostate cancers. MRI-
invisible tumors are not detected by mpMRI possibly because of their metabolomic similarity to benign prostate glands, while 
certain metabolic features (e.g., lower polyamine levels) may be the molecular basis of tumor detection by mpMRI. We conclude 
that further metabolomic studies of prostate cancer tissue could provide novel insights to improve the sensitivity and specificity of 
radiologic detection of prostate cancer.

Background: Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome is an inherited genetic disorder associated with an increased risk of kidney lesions, 
including cysts and renal tumors called hybrid oncocytic tumor (HOT).1 HOT are usually low-grade tumors, displaying a mixture of 
neoplastic cells with histologic features of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (chRCC) and renal oncocytoma (RO). The 
development of HOT specific biomarker would improve the diagnostic accuracy, facilitate disease management, and assist familial 
genetic monitoring. 
Design: We analyzed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data from HOT and matched benign kidney tissue to identify lineage markers 
expressed in HOT. In parallel, we utilized single cell RNAseq data from benign kidney tubular epithelial cell types to train a random 
forest model to nominate putative cell of origin for HOT, chRCC, and RO.2 We simultaneously characterized the expression pattern 
of candidate biomarkers using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RNA in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) in 16 HOT tumors obtained 
from 10 genetically confirmed BHD patients and further validated the top candidate biomarker specificity in various common and 
uncommon renal tumors. 
Results: We identified candidate biomarkers highly expressed in HOT, including L1CAM, FOXI1, and long non-coding 
RNA LINC01187. L1CAM is known to be expressed in the principal cells of distal nephron, while FOXI1 and LINC01187 are 
expressed in the intercalated cells of benign kidney.3 L1CAM, FOXI1, and LINC01187 are expressed in a unique “checkered” 
pattern in HOT, where L1CAM (a principal cell marker) staining pattern showed mutual exclusivity with 
FOXI1/LINC01187 (intercalated cell markers), among the two morphologically distinct cellular populations of HOT (Figure 1). 
Overall, 15/16 (93.8%) HOT tumors showed checkered L1CAM expression pattern and 1/16 (6.2%) HOT tumor cases showed 
focal/low expression of L1CAM. L1CAM expression was negative in 16/20 (80%) chRCC and patchy or focal in the other 4 chRCC 
cases. L1CAM expression was also negative in 5/5 RO cases. 
Figure 1 - 828 
 
Conclusions: L1CAM protein is expressed in a unique “checkered” pattern in BHD associated HOT tumors. L1CAM expression 
shows mutual exclusivity to FOXI1/LINC01187 expression, which collectively captures the two unique tumor epithelial populations 
that co-exist in BHD associated HOT tumors, and helps distinguish HOT from chRCC and RO. These markers will inform future 
studies on the evolution and interaction between the two transcriptionally distinct tumor epithelial populations in HOT.

Background: MiTF family altered renal cell carcinoma (MiTF-RCC) demonstrates a wide morphologic spectrum and can 
histologically resemble common RCC subtypes, posing a diagnostic challenge. MiTF-RCC are known to harbor recurrent 
chromosomal rearrangements involving the MiTF family of transcription factors, TFE3 and TFEB. Clinical fluorescence in 
situ hybridization (FISH) assays for detection of TFE3 and TFEB gene aberrations have been performed at our institution since 
2014. 
Design: Interphase FISH was performed using commercial dual-color break-apart probes specific to the TFE3 locus at Xp11.2 
(TFE3 FISH) and TFEB locus at 6p21 (TFEB FISH) employing previously established methodologies (PMID: 28840857). We 
reviewed clinical TFE3/TFEB FISH assays performed during 2014-2022 and summarized test results. 
Results: TFE3 FISH was performed on 424 tumor cases suspicious for TFE3 rearrangement associated renal cell carcinoma. 62 
of these 424 cases (15%) tested positive for TFE3 translocation. Age for positive cases ranged from 14 to 86 years (average 47 
years), including 40 females, 21 males, and 1 patient without gender information. One of the positive cases also showed high copy 
number gain of the TFE3 locus in > 50% cells. TFEB FISH was performed on 357 tumor cases. 28 of these cases (8%) tested 
positive for TFEB rearrangement (including translocation and amplification). Patients with any TFEB rearrangement ranged in age 
from 19 to 77 years (average 59 years), including 15 females and 13 males. TFEB amplification interpretation has been included in 
our TFEB FISH test reports since 2017. Since then, 18 cases were diagnosed with TFEB amplification, while 5 cases were 
consistent with TFEB translocation. Patients with TFEB translocation ranged in age from 19 to 62 years (average 41 years), 
including 3 females and 6 males. Patients with TFEB amplification ranged in age from 55 to 77 years (average 67 years), including 
9 females and 9 males. Between 2014-2017, 1 patient (68-year female) had a complex gene fusion, amplification, or partial tandem 
duplication of TFEB, and 5 cases had copy number gain in a subset of tumor cells. TFE3 and TFEB rearrangements were never 
detected in the same patient.

Conclusions: Clinical TFE3/TFEB FISH assays successfully identified those rare MiTF-RCC 
with TFE3 and TFEB rearrangements. TFE3 and TFEB translocations tend to occur in relatively younger 
patients TFEB amplifications occur more frequently than TFEB translocations in renal tumors and manifest largely in older patients. 
 
830   Cribriform Morphology in Conventional Prostatic Adenocarcinoma Vs. Intraductal Carcinoma 
of the Prostate: Their Clinical Significance May Not Be Comparable 
Ying Wang1, Yuki Teramoto2, Hiroshi Miyamoto1 
1University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, 2Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan 
Disclosures: Ying Wang: None; Yuki Teramoto: None; Hiroshi Miyamoto: None 
Background: Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC) in most of which cribriform morphology (CM) is present is a distinct entity 
of aggressive prostate cancer. Meanwhile, assigning a Gleason grade to IDC associated with conventional prostatic 
adenocarcinoma (CPA) remains controversial. In particular, the clinical impact of CM seen in CPA vs. IDC needs to be further 
 
  
 
S821 
investigated. We herein compared radical prostatectomy (RP) findings and long-term oncologic outcomes in patients with CPA 
and/or IDC exhibiting CM. 
Design: We studied consecutive patients who had undergone RP at our institution from 2010-2011. Within our Surgical Pathology 
database, we identified a total of 426 cases with Grade Group (GG) 2-4 CPA with or without IDC after excluding cases showing any 
Gleason grade 5 pattern (including minor tertiary 5 and comedonecrosis within IDC) or undergoing neoadjuvant therapy prior to RP, 
as well as those where the histology slides had been unavailable for review. 
Results: We divided our patient cohort into 4 groups: G1) no CM [CPA(-)/IDC(-): n=174, 41%]; G2) CM only in CPA [CPA(+)/IDC(-
): n=142, 33%]; G3) CM only in IDC [CPA(-)/IDC(+): n=16, 4%]; and G4) CM in both CPA and IDC [CPA(+)/IDC(+): n=94, 22%]. 
Compared with G2 patients, G4 was associated with significantly worse clinicopathological features, including higher GG, higher 
pT/pN category, larger estimated tumor volume, and the need for adjuvant therapy immediately after RP. Similarly, G4 patients 
showed significantly higher GG and larger tumor volume than G3 patients. There were no significant differences in these features 
between G2 and G3 patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis coupled with log-rank test revealed significantly higher risks of disease 
progression after RP in G2 than in G1 (P<0.001) as well as in G4 than in G2 (P<0.001), while there were no significant differences 
in progression-free survival between G2 vs. G3 (P=0.267) and G3 vs. G4 (P=0.611). In multivariate analysis with Cox regression 
model (G1 as a reference), G2 (hazard ratio 4.264, P=0.004), G3 (hazard ratio 4.957, P=0.003), and G4 (hazard ratio 
12.35, P<0.001) showed significance for progression.

Conclusions: Compared with CPA(+)/IDC(-), CPA(+)/IDC(+) was found to be associated with not only adverse histopathologic 
features in RP specimens but also poorer prognosis, while the prognosis of CPA(-)/IDC(+) vs. CPA(+)/IDC(+) was similar. These 
findings suggest that the clinical significance of CM in CPA vs. IDC is not comparable.

831   Cytologic Assessment of Supernatants of Formalin Solution Following Histological 
Assessment of Transurethral Resection Specimens: Potential Detection of Denuded 
Urothelial Cancer Cells

Disclosures: Ying Wang: None; John Plavnicky: None; Donna Russell: None; Jerome Jean-Gilles: None; Hiroshi Miyamoto: None 
Background: Urothelial denudation is often seen in transurethral biopsy specimens even where no definitive cancer is identified. 
Importantly, it may reflect cases of carcinoma in situ or otherwise high-grade cancer in which the neoplastic cells have shed as a 
result of discohesion. The present study aims to determine if denuded cells remain in the supernatants of formalin solution after 
submission of transurethral resection specimens for histological assessment. 
Design: Formalin supernatants were collected from the containers of transurethral resection/biopsy specimens after the entire 
tissue (mostly with filtration) was submitted for histological examination. The cell block (n=43) was prepared from the centrifuged 
supernatant, while the ThinPrep smear (n=37) was prepared by the T2000 ThinPrep processor (Hologic). 
Results: In the cell blocks from cases showing urothelial carcinoma in situ (n=7), non-invasive high-grade papillary urothelial 
carcinoma (n=14), invasive high-grade papillary/non-papillary urothelial carcinoma (n=7), or denuded urothelial mucosa with no 
definitive cancer (n=15), urothelial cells were detected in only 2 (5%) specimens (1 case of pTa tumor and 1 case of invasive 
tumor). We then used the ThinPrep method (see Table). Overall, the smear was satisfactory for evaluation in 34 (92%) of 37 cases. 
In all 13 cases with pTis disease (including those suspicious for but not diagnostic of carcinoma in situ), high-grade urothelial 
carcinoma cells (see Figure 1), cells suspicious for high-grade urothelial carcinoma, and/or atypical urothelial cells were detected. 
Similarly, in 13 (87%) of 15 cases with pTa or pT1 disease, denuded urothelial cells were detected. More interestingly, atypical 
urothelial cells (n=2; see Figure 2) or benign-appearing urothelial cells (n=6) were present in the supernatants from cases showing 
urothelial denudation (without definitive cancer), and only 1 (11%) case was unsatisfactory.

Conclusions: The present results suggest that cytologic examination of the ThinPrep smear from the supernatants of formalin

this technique can be applied to non-neoplastic or indeterminate cases showing extensive urothelial denudation to detect possible 
malignant cells.

Background: Nonlinear microscopy (NLM) is a laser scanning microscopy technique that generates real-time images and optical 
serial sections closely resembling formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded H&E without the need for fixation, embedding, microtome 
sectioning, or slide preparation. Both fresh and fixed tissues can be imaged. NLM has been successfully utilized to evaluate bone, 
bone marrow, lymph nodes, skin, prostate, and breast tissue. Herein, we evaluated the ability of NLM to characterize benign 
bladder tissue and bladder tumors. 
Design: Discarded (not required for clinical assessment) unsectioned bladder tissue was stained for 2 minutes with fluorescent 
dyes consisting of acridine orange (nuclear staining) and sulforhodamine 101 (stromal/cytoplasmic staining), followed by a 30-
second rinse in saline. The tissue specimens were evaluated in real-time using NLM (Fig. 1A) and subsequently compared with 
standard paraffin-embedded H&E histology. 
Results: This study included 36 tissue samples from radical cystectomies with known urothelial carcinoma (low and high grade). 
Representative NLM images of bladder tissue are shown in Figures 1 and 2. The background bladder tissue was well 
characterized, including the presence of benign urothelial epithelium, muscularis propria, and fibroadipose tissue. The 
characteristic features of low-grade tumors were observed, including papillary structures. High-grade tumors showed nuclear 
pleomorphism, brisk mitotic count, apoptosis, and focal squamous differentiation. Additionally, muscularis propria invasion was 
visualized. 
Figure 1 - 832 
 
Figure 2 - 832 
 
Conclusions: We demonstrate the capability of NLM for the evaluation of benign bladder tissue and bladder tumors. Possible 
future applications of NLM include: intraoperative confirmation of the presence of muscularis propria in transurethral resections of 
bladder tumors (TURBT), rapid confirmation of diagnostic tissue in urinary tract biopsies, and collection of fresh tissue for research 
from TURBT procedures while preserving the adequate specimens for staging and diagnosis.

Background: Background: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is comprised of distinct histological subtypes, the most common of which 
are clear cell (ccRCC), papillary (pRCC) and chromophobe RCC. The recently renamed “TFE3 rearranged RCC” (2022 WHO 
classification) is rare subtype of RCC belonging to the MiT family translocation RCCs, harboring TFE3 translocations with various 
gene fusion partners.  These rearrangements have a unique morphology and immunophenotype.  To further elucidate the 
molecular alterations in TFE3 rearranged RCC, we characterized the genomic, transcriptional, and immune landscapes in 
comparison to ccRCC and type II pRCC. 
Design: Design: Next-generation sequencing of RNA (whole transcriptome) and DNA (592-gene panel or whole exome) for TFE3 
rearranged RCC (N=21), type II pRCC (N=22) and ccRCC samples (N=391) was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 
tumor samples using the NextSeq platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). PD-L1 expression was tested by IHC (SP142; Positive 
(+): ?2+, ?%5).  Immune cell fractions of the tumor microenvironment (TME) were estimated with RNA deconvolution using 
quanTIseq. Differentially regulated pathways were assessed by gene set enrichment analysis. X2 and Kruskal-Wallis tests were 
used, and p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons (Benjamini-Hochberg). 
Results: Results: RCC patients with TFE3 fusions were significantly younger and more frequently female (47.0 years (y), 71.4% 
female) as compared to pRCC (70 y, 28.6%; p<0.05) and ccRCC (62 y, 27.6%; p<0.05). A total of 14 unique fusion partners were 
observed, including a novel fusion with SRRM2. Co-alteration rates in TFE3 fusion-positive RCC (Figure 1) were comparable to 
pRCC, while ccRCC exhibited significantly higher mutation rates of VHL (0% TFE3 RCC, 4.8% pRCC, 78.8% ccRCC; p<0.05) and 
PBRM1 (0% TFE3 RCC, 4.8% pRCC, 49.5% ccRCC; p<0.05). TME analysis revealed that TFE3 fusions were associated with 
significantly less M1 macrophages (0.8%) as compared to pRCC (1.4%) and ccRCC (2.7%) (p<0.05), suggesting a cold immune 
microenvironment. However, TFE3 fusion-positive tumors were more commonly PDL1+ (TFE3 50%, pRCC 19.0%, ccRCC 12.2%; 
p<0.05). 
Figure 1 - 833 
 
Conclusions: Conclusions: TFE3 rearranged RCC has different molecular alterations compared to cRCC and pRCC. Despite it 
having a relatively cold TME compared to pRCC and ccRCC, increased PDL1+ rates in TFE3 translocation RCC suggest a 
potential benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and warrants further investigation in this rare RCC subtype.

Disclosures: Rumeal Whaley: None; Thomas Ulbright: None 
Background: Yolk sac tumor (YST) is often associated with embryonic-type neuroectodermal elements (ENE) in germ cell 
neoplasia in situ-derived mixed germ cell tumors of the testis. The primitive endodermal-type glands of YST mimic tubules of ENE 
(Fig. 1), potentially leading to an overestimation of the size of ENE and misinterpretation as embryonic-type neuroectodermal tumor 
 
  
 
S825 
(ENT) based on the WHO guideline of >5 mm diameter. A diagnosis of ENT in the testis may lead to retroperitoneal 
lymphadenectomy even in clinical stage I patients and in post-chemotherapy resections indicates a poor prognosis. 
Design: We identified cases of YST (n=19) and with ENE (n=17) that were often admixed and showed morphologic overlap. 
Immunohistochemical studies with antibodies directed against villin, CDX2, glypican 3, AFP, synaptophysin, INSM1, CD56, GFAP, 
S100 protein, neurofilament, PHOX2B, cytokeratin AE1/AE3, and SALL4 were performed on 4 µm sections on a Dako automated 
platform with appropriate controls.  
Results: The results are summarized in the table. ENE often admixed with YST glands that resembled tubules of ENE (Fig 1). 
Positivity for villin (Fig. 2), CDX2 and AFP were specific for YST in the differential with ENE, with villin having the best sensitivity 
(91%), followed by AFP (81%) and CDX2 (78%). Villin showed more diffuse expression (45%) than the others (AFP – 21%; CDX2 - 
0%). Glypican 3 was not helpful because of frequent (64%) positivity in ENE. GFAP, synaptophysin (Fig. 2) and PHOX2B were 
specific for ENE, with respective sensitivities of 90%, 88%, and 40%, but were often focal/patchy, with GFAP commonly occurring 
at the periphery of ENE. The other markers either lacked specificity or sensitivity to be considered routinely helpful, although strong 
and diffuse CD56 expression favored ENE over YST.

Conclusions: Primitive endodermal-type YST glands often admix with and mimic the tubules that are common as a feature of 
ENE. The optimal immunohistochemical panel for distinguishing these components is villin, AFP, synaptophysin and GFAP.

Background: Consensus recommendations on grading and reporting of prostatic adenocarcinoma have been published by the 
International Society of Urological Pathology and the Genitourinary Pathology Society. Although the societies’ position papers are 
in overall agreement, a few differences remain on important issues. Resulting practice standards among genitourinary pathologists 
have not been evaluated. 
Design: This cross-sectional study was conducted using a web-based survey querying grading and reporting practices of 
genitourinary pathologists. Data were collected and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). De-identified 
respondent data were scored as a percentage. 
Results: The response rate was 83% (61 of 73). For biopsies, tumor measurement would include (69%) or subtract (31%) 
intervening benign glands. Both Gleason score and Grade Groups are reported by 93% of participants. Most participants (98%) 
report percent pattern 4 (PP4) but reporting decreases to 62% if higher grades are present. In systematic biopsies, cores with 
different grades contained in the same jar are graded globally (74%) vs. per core (26%), and volume estimated globally (44%) vs. 
per core (56%). In targeted biopsies, multiple cores in the same jar are graded globally (87%) vs. per core (13%), and volume 
estimated globally (61%) vs. per core (39%). Cribriform morphology (CRIB) is reported by 84% of participants but CRIB size is 
reported by 23%. Basal cell markers (BCM)s are used by 92% for differentiating isolated intraductal vs. invasive CRIB (?IDC) and 
by 84% for ?IDC associated with Grade Group 1 (GG1) cancer. However, only 15% would use BCMs for ?IDC associated with 
≥GG2. IDC, isolated, associated with GG1 or with ≥GG2 is not graded by 90%, 72%, and 59% of participants, respectively. In 
radical prostatectomies, 97% of participants report PP4, but 57% would report if overall grade >GG3. GG1 with < 5% pattern 4 is 
graded as GG2 by 72%. A <5% cut-off for tertiary (“minor”) pattern is used by 84%, and 87% report >5% pattern 4 or 5 as 
secondary pattern. Grading is assigned based on the dominant nodule for 71%. CRIB is reported by 87%. Small and large CRIB is 
discriminated by 18%. For ?IDC associated with GG1, 72% use BCMs. However, 21% would perform BCMs for ?IDC associated 
with ≥GG2.  IDC, isolated, associated with GG1 or with ≥ GG2 is not graded by 90%, 72%, and 57% of participants, respectively.

Conclusions: There is substantial agreement in grading and reporting patterns in this predominantly academic cohort of 
genitourinary pathologists. 
 
836   Can Glomerular Involvement in Renal Pelvic Urothelial Carcinoma Be Used to Redefine pT3 to 
Improve Correlation with Survival?

Background: pT categorization from the American Joint Committee on Cancer is an important pathologic factor for prognostication 
and clinical decision-making in renal pelvic urothelial carcinoma. Defined as tumor invading the renal parenchyma and/or peripelvic 
fat, renal pelvic pT3 is the largest pT category with notable survival heterogeneity. Using glomeruli as a boundary, this study sought 
to compare survival of renal pelvic pT3 tumors based on the extent of renal parenchyma invasion and determine whether redefining 
pT2 and pT3 improves pT correlation with survival. 
Design: Primary renal pelvic urothelial carcinoma was identified by review of nephroureterectomies performed at our institution 
from 2010-2019. Patients with prior or concurrent higher pT bladder or ureter tumors and those treated with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy were excluded. Slide review was completed. Cases (n=145) were stratified by pT, pN, lymphovascular invasion, and 
invasion of the renal medulla (adjacent to renal collecting ducts and/or tubules) versus invasion of the peripelvic fat and/or renal 
cortex (adjacent to or beyond at least one glomerulus). Overall survival was compared using Kaplan Meier survival curves and Cox 
regression multivariate analysis. 
Results: pT3 was the most populous category (41.4%) and pT2 was the least numerous (5.5%). pT2 and pT3 tumors had similar 
5-year overall survival, with multivariate analysis demonstrating overlap of hazard ratios for pT2 [HR=2.20, 95% CI (0.70-6.95)] and 
pT3 [HR=3.15, 95% CI (1.63-6.09)], concordant with survival curve analysis. pT3 tumors invading the peripelvic fat and/or renal 
cortex had a 3.25-fold worse prognosis than those with only renal medulla invasion. Furthermore, pT2 and pT3 tumors with only 
renal medulla invasion had similar overall survival, whereas pT3 tumors with peripelvic fat and/or renal cortex invasion had a worse 
prognosis (p=0.00036). Notably, moving pT3 tumors with only renal medulla invasion to pT2 reduced overlap between survival 
curves and hazard ratios for pT2 [HR=1.93, 95% CI (0.93-4.02)] and pT3 [HR=6.15, 95% CI (2.92-12.96)].

Figure 2 - 836 
 
Conclusions: Modifying pT2 to include pT3 tumors with only renal medulla invasion and restricting pT3 to peripelvic fat and/or 
renal cortex invasion improves pT correlation with survival. Thus, we recommend using glomeruli as a landmark to stratify renal 
parenchyma invasion as they are easily identifiable, and our proposed modifications improve prognostic accuracy of pT 
classification.

Background: IO, given alone or in combination with targeted agents, has become a mainstay for patients with metastatic RCC, 
either as the first line or later in the treatment course. Patients with de novo metastatic disease and favorable systemic responses 
to IO may be offered a CN. This population is under-characterized and the prognostic value of pathologic response assessment in 
this setting is unclear. Our study aims to assess pathologic response in CN following IO and identify histologic features that can 
help inform management. 
Design: We conducted a retrospective study of 33 pts who underwent CN following systemic IO for metastatic RCC. Paired pre-
treatment biopsies and post-IO CNs were reviewed. We evaluated %RVT [residual viable tumor area/total tumor bed area 
(including regression tumor bed)], necrosis, fibrosis, and additional immune-related features [tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), 
lymphoid aggregates, immune cell populations by IHC, etc.]. Pathologic response was categorized based on %RVT: complete 
response (CR) 0%, near-CR (nCR) ≤10%, 10%< partial response (PR) ≤90%, no response (NR) >90%. Kaplan-Meier method and 
log-rank test were used to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between groups. Median follow-
up time was calculated using reverse Kaplan-Meier method. 
Results: Median age at diagnosis was 61y (39-76), and 91% were male. All pts had metastatic disease at presentation and 30 
(91%) had clear cell RCC. IO received before CN included ipilimumab+nivolumab(58%), combination VEGF+IO (27%), sequential 
VEGF and IO monotherapy (12%), and interferon (3%). At CN, pathologic CR and nCR were observed in 6 (18%) and 4 (12%), 
respectively (combined in Table). 18 (55%) pts had PR with a broad %RVT range (20-90%), and 5 (15%) pts were NR. Pts who 
demonstrated CR/nCR had a longer PFS compared to those with a PR or NR [92.4mo. vs. 5.1(PR) vs. 10.3(NR), p<0.01]. OS 
varied by the pathologic response group, but differences were not significant (Figure 1). %RVT within the PR group did not 
correlate with outcomes. Increased TILs (primarily T cells) were observed in the RVT of most nCR and PR cases. Further 
characterization of tumor immune milieu is ongoing.

additional biomarkers beyond %RVT should be investigated. 
 
838   Is the Stratification of Positive Lymph Nodes into pN1 and pN2 for Renal Pelvic and Ureter 
Carcinoma Prognostically Significant? 
Douglas Wu1, Megan Wong1, Cheryl Lee2, Debra Zynger3 
1The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, 2The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 3The Ohio State 
University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH 
Disclosures: Douglas Wu: None; Megan Wong: None; Cheryl Lee: None; Debra Zynger: None 
Background: The 6th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer had 3 categories for positive lymph nodes (pN1-3) in 
upper urinary tract carcinoma. pN3 was subsequently removed, with the 7th and 8th editions defining pN1 as 1 lymph node with 
tumor deposit 2 cm or metastases in multiple lymph nodes. The aim of this study was to assess if the current pN categories impact 
overall survival in renal pelvis and ureter tumors. 
 
  
 
S831 
Design: Patients who underwent nephroureterectomy with lymphadenectomy at our institution between 2010-2019 for primary 
upper urinary tract carcinoma were identified through review of pathology reports. Patients with prior or concurrent higher pT 
bladder tumors, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and those without lymphadenectomy were excluded from additional analysis. Slide 
review was completed. Cases were stratified by pN, size of largest positive lymph node deposit, number of positive lymph nodes, 
and extranodal extension. Overall survival was compared using Kaplan Meier survival models. 
Results: 152 patients had a nephroureterectomy with lymph nodes resected (mean 11.7 nodes, range 1-43; pN0 80.3%, pN1 
7.2%, pN2 12.5%). 82 (53.9%) patients were deceased at last review [pN0, 56 (45.9%); pN1-2, 26 (86.7%)]. There was no 
difference in survival between pN1 and pN2 (p=0.24, Fig. 1) with 5-year survivals (95% confidence interval) of pN0, 63.1% (54.9-
72.5%); pN1, 9.3% (3.7-30.2%); and pN2, 14.8% (7.8-35.6%). Analysis of the 2 current pN classification criteria, metastatic deposit 
size threshold of 2 cm (p=0.79) and number of positive lymph nodes (p=0.24), both showed no significant differences in survival. 
Extranodal extension did not correlate with survival (p=0.29). As such, pN1 and pN2 were grouped together (pN+) based on any 
tumor presence in the lymph node(s). pN+ patients had worse survival than pN0 (p<0.0001, Fig. 2) with a 5-year survival of 11.2% 
(4.1-30.4%). 
Figure 1 - 838 
 
Figure 2 - 838 
 
Conclusions: The current stratification of upper urinary tract carcinoma into pN1 and pN2 categories does not provide prognostic 
information, and both yield a stage IV classification, regardless of pT or pM category. Therefore, we recommend further 
simplification of the pN classification into 1 category for regional lymph node metastasis, irrespective of positive lymph node deposit 
size or number of positive lymph nodes.

Background: Both transperineal (TP) and transrectal (TR) multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsy 
(TBx) has shown to detect more clinically significant (cs) prostate cancer (PCa) than standard template biopsies (SBx). TP biopsy 
technique is becoming more favored since the lower risk of complications. Current data supports the inclusion of both TBx and SBx 
in obtaining an optimal csPCa detection rate for both approaches. However, the accuracy of each biopsy technique for predicting 
PCa Gleason Grade Group (GG) following radical prostatectomy (RP) remains under investigation. Our aim was to evaluate the 
accuracy of SBx and TBx by both TP and TR approaches in predicting GG at RP. 
Design: We identified 310 PCa patients who underwent RP following TP TBx (3-core) and SBx (20-core) (n=105) or TR TBx (4-
core) and concomitant SBx (12-core) (n=205) from September 2019 to February 2021. All patients had one or more lesions that 
were identified on prior prostate mpMRI. csPCa was defined as GG2 or greater. 
Results: Overall, the TP combined Bx showed a similar csPCa detection rate as the TR approach (81.0% vs 76.1%). When 
comparing TBx with SBx in all patients, TBx showed a similar overall PCa to SBx (91.9% vs 91.4%), but demonstrated a 
significantly higher csPCa detection than SBx (70.2% vs 63.9%, p<0.001). Compared with RP, TP combined Bx showed a better 
GG concordance than TR approach but did not reach a statistical significance (63.8% vs 57.1%). Furthermore, TP combined Bx 
 
  
 
S832 
showed a similar upgrading rate (21.9% vs 22.9%) but significantly lower downgrading rate (10.5% vs 20.0%, p=0.034) than the TR 
approach. TP TBx showed a similar concordance as TP SBx (all p>0.05). TR TBx however showed a significantly higher 
concordance than TR SBx (52.2% vs 41.5%, p=0.002). Kappa coefficient of TP combined Bx was highest (k=0.48) followed by TR 
combined Bx (k= 0.39), TP TBx (k=0.36), TR TBx (k=0.35), TP SBx (k=0.34) and TR SBx (k=0.26). Of 69 cases with combined 
clinically insignificant PCa diagnosis, 38 (55.1%) were diagnosed as csPCa. Univariate logistic regression analysis did not reveal 
any clinical factors for predicting final pathological upgrade except a trend that TR showed a 2.8-fold than TP approach to have a 
final upgrade (p=0.065). 
Conclusions: The combined effect of SBx plus TBx led to a better pathological concordance rate and less upgrading from biopsy 
to RP. With more SBx cores, TP combined Bx showed the best performance. 
 
840   Prostatic Urethral Polyps and Ectopic Urethral Polyps: A Case Series 
Yubo Wu1, Jonathan Epstein1 
1Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD 
Disclosures: Yubo Wu: None; Jonathan Epstein: None 
Background: Prostatic urethral polyps and ectopic prostatic polyps are rare, benign entities. This entity has been previously 
described in the literature in limited case series and thus remains poorly characterized. 
Design: 57 cases (4 in-house; 53 consults) with these diagnoses were found in our Surgical Pathology files from 2012-2022. Of 
these, slides were available for review in 34 cases. 
Results: The age range at presentation was 21 to 85 years. Polyps were located throughout the urothelial tract – prostatic urethra 
(n=30), bladder (n=20), bulbomembranous urethra (n=4), penile urethra (n=1), and indeterminate (n=2). Gross size ranged from 0.1 
cm to 1.3 cm in greatest dimension with a median size of 0.3 cm. Architecturally, they were either broad-based (Figures 1A-B) or 
narrow-based (Fig. 1C) polypoid lesions surfaced by prostatic epithelium, urothelium, or a mixture of both. Surface morphologies 
included flat (Fig 1B right) or villoglandular (Fig. 1D) or mixed. Villograndular pattern mimicked papillary prostatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma, yet were lined by benign prostatic epithelium or urothelium or both (Fig. 1E). One case demonstrated severe 
edema mimicking polypoid cystitis (Fig. 1F). The presence of tightly-packed prostatic glands was variable, from none to florid and 
either were immediately beneath the surface (Fig. 1B) or filled up the underlying stroma (Fig. 1A), the latter mimicking prostatic 
adenocarcinoma. Verumontanum-type corpora amylacea were noted in several polyps, appearing in orange, green, blue, and dark 
purple colors (Fig. 1A). 4 cases had neoplastic lesions comingling with the polyps including: 1 benign inverted urothelial papilloma, 
3 prostatic adenocarcinomas [prostatic urethra (2), membranous urethra (1)]; and 1 intraductal prostatic adenocarcinoma (prostatic 
urethra).

Conclusions: Our case series is the largest to date and demonstrates that prostatic urethral polyps and ectopic prostatic polyps 
have a wide range of morphological findings and can occur in a wide age range. Exceedingly rarely, they may arise in the urethra 
distal to the prostate. Lesions can mimic both acinar and ductal prostatic adenocarcinoma and in a minority of these cases give rise 
to prostatic adenocarcinoma.

Background: Extraprostatic extension of prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) is divided into pT3a, extraprostatic extension without 
SVI and pT3b; Seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) with or without extraprostatic extension.  In this study we correlate SVI with other 
pathologic variables such as presence of extra prostatic extension (EPE) elsewhere, prognostic Grade Group (GG), percentage of 
gland involved by tumor (VOL) and location of dominant nodule (DN). 
Design: All consecutive patients with SVI who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) at our institution between 2009-2015 were 
included. All cases were reviewed by a urologic pathologist. Statistical analysis was done using cox proportional hazard for 
prognostic factors in multivariate setting. Adverse outcome was defined as biochemical recurrence (BCR), systemic recurrence or 
death from disease. 
Results: 293 patients were included. Median age was 63 (45-83). Median follow up period was 84 months (6-153). Median 
percentage of prostate gland involvement was 25% (2-95). 42 (14.3%) patients had SVI only without EPE while 22 (7.5%) had SVI 
with focal EPE and 229 (78.2) had SVI with established EPE. Of the 42 patients with SVI only, 32 patients (76.2%) are alive with no 
recurrence, 7 (16.7%) showed biochemical recurrence (BCR) or recurrence in bone or lymph nodes, 2 (4.7%) died from disease 
and 1 (2.4%) died from other reasons. Of the 22 patients with SVI with focal EPE, 20 patients (91%) are alive with no recurrence, 1 
(4.5%) show BCR or recurrence in bone or lymph nodes, and 1 (4.5%) died from other reasons. Of the 229 patients with SVI and 
established EPE, 176 patients (75.1%) are alive with no recurrence, 29 (12.7%) showed BCR or recurrence in bone or lymph 
nodes, 6 (2.6%) died from disease and 22 (9.6%) died from other reasons. Multivariate anlaysis showed that the presence of focal 
or nonfocal EPE in patients with SVI was not significantly associated with adverse outcome. None of the other pathologic variables 
was significant by multivariate analysis. 
Conclusions: The majority of prostate cancer patients with SVI are alive and without disease after long follow up. The presence of 
EPE (focal or nonfocal) in patients with SVI does not appear to be associated with adverse outcome when compared with patients 
with Seminal vesicle invasion without EPE.

Background: Large cell calcifying Sertoli tumor (LCCSCT) is a type of testicular sex cord-stromal tumor (TSCST) that often occurs 
sporadically (~60-70%) or in the context of Carney complex (~30-40%); rare examples are associated with other syndromes. A 
subset of LCCSCT is clinically malignant and the molecular mechanisms that drive such aggressive behavior remain unknown. 
Design: We analyzed 20 LCCSCT (12 benign, 8 malignant) using PRKAR1A immunohistochemistry and next-generation 
sequencing (447-gene panel). Malignant cases were defined by the presence of metastases. 
 
  
 
S834 
Results: Malignant LCCSCTs were associated with older age (median 32.5 vs. 16 years) and larger tumor size (median 3.3 vs. 1.5 
cm). All tumors except one (case 20, Table 1) demonstrated loss of PRKAR1A expression. Among 14 cases sequenced to date (8 
benign, 6 malignant), 4 failed QA metrics and had uninterpretable results (2 benign, 2 malignant). All cases with interpretable 
results harbored pathogenic single nucleotide variants of PRKAR1A (Table 1). Evidence of loss-of heterozygosity (LOH) 
of PRKAR1A was present in malignant LCCSCTs, but not in benign LCCSCTs. The mechanisms of LOH included mutation + copy 
number loss (case 15) and 2 concurrent mutations (case 14). In 2 malignant LCCSCTs (cases 13 and 18), 
pathogenic PRKAR1A variants were present at variant allele frequencies > 70%, but sequencing quality precluded a definitive 
evaluation of LOH. Co-mutation of BRCA2 (with LOH, case 15), homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/CDKN2B and arm-level or 
chromosome-level copy number changes were only seen in malignant LCCSCT. Analysis of consecutive metastases in case 15 
(interval: 3 years) showed "stable" genomic alterations. Of note, studies have demonstrated that haploinsufficiency of PRKAR1A is 
tumorigenic in humans and mice, and the neoplasms that arise in this context often lack evidence of PRKAR1A LOH. 
 
Conclusions: The present study suggests that, in LCCSCT, PRKAR1A LOH is associated with malignancy. The consistent loss of 
PRKAR1A expression observed in LCCSCT with both haploinsufficiency and LOH suggests that this gene might influence 
oncogenic processes that drive aggressive behavior at a pre-translational level or, alternatively, that immunohistochemistry is 
insufficiently sensitive to distinguish between reduced and ablated protein expression. The results of this study suggest that 
assessment of the genomic alterations present in LCCSCT might be helpful to identify a subset of tumors with malignant potential.

Disclosures: Yan Hong (Shirley) Yu: None; Kristen Liu: None; Katherine Lajkosz: None; Theodorus Van Der Kwast: None;

Background: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) 
scores are pretreatment risk stratification tools which use biopsy data to guide patient management. We have previously shown 
that the CAPRA outperforms NCCN in patient stratification, and the addition of cribriform architecture pattern 4 (CC) and intraductal 
carcinoma (IDC) improves outcome stratification particularly for patients in CAPRA intermediate and NCCN unfavorable 
intermediate categories.  In this study, we performed decision curve analysis (DCA) to determine clinical net benefit derived from 
the addition of CC/IDC to the NCCN and CAPRA tools.  
Design: Multi-centre retrospective cohorts of matched biopsy-prostatectomy cases (2010-2017) were reviewed for the presence or 
absence of CC/IDC. Clinicopathological and follow up data were retrieved. The NCCN CAPRA scores were tabulated and 
categorized as follows: NCCN scores 1-2 = very low/low risk, 3 = favorable intermediate, 4 = unfavorable intermediate, 5-6 = 
high/very high risk; CAPRA scores 0-2 = low risk, 3-5 = intermediate risk, 6-10 = high risk. Clinical outcome variables were 
biochemical (BCR) and metastases/death of prostate cancer (event free survival-EFS) after prostatectomy. DCA was calculated to 
evaluate the models stratified by the presence of CC/IDC. 
Results: The full cohort (n= 1149, three centres) had mean age 63 years and mean follow up of 4.9 (range 0-10.8) years. CC/IDC 
was present in 252/1149 (22%) biopsies. For biopsy grade groups: 20% were GG1, 51% GG2, 16% GG3, 7% GG4, and 6% GG5. 
BCR was present in 229 (20%) patients and there were 113 (10%) events. For BCR (Figure 1) and EFS (Figure 2) models for each 
separate center and the full cohort, DCA shows improved net benefit in most threshold probabilities with the addition of CC/IDC to 
NCCN and CAPRA risk assessment tools. 
Figure 1 - 843 
Figure 2 - 843 
Conclusions: DCA analysis shows addition of CC/IDC improves the prognostic performance of NCCN and CAPRA patient 
stratification. Our study underscores the importance of including these histomorphologic features as part of pretreatment tools.

Disclosures: Nicole Zalles: None; Sean Williamson: None; Rohit Mehra: None; Jesse McKenney: None; Jane Nguyen: None 
Background: TFEB amplified renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a recently described entity that exhibits various morphologic patterns 
of high grade RCC, with a characteristic amplification of chromosome 6p21.2. We aimed to further characterize both histological 
and immunohistochemical features of these tumors, to aid in their identification. 
Design: We searched our archives retrospectively to identify cases of TFEB-amplified RCC. Clinical and imaging features, 
immunohistochemical findings and histological features were reviewed. Morphologic features assessed included papillary 
architecture, eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm, necrosis, nucleoli, and rhabdoid and/or sarcomatoid morphology. 
Results: We identified 12 RCCs with TFEB gain, of which 9 were reported by FISH as having unequivocal amplification, and 3 had 
increased copies below the cutoff of >10 defining amplification. Of note 1 tumor exhibited increased copies of 
both TFE3 and TFEB. A majority demonstrated papillary or pseudo-papillary architecture (9/12), prominent nucleoli (11/12) and 
eosinophilic cytoplasm (10/12). Clear cytoplasm was present in 9. Most tumors showed an infiltrative growth pattern (9/12). 
Cytoplasmic vacuoles were florid in one tumor (Figure 1A) and two had chromophobe-like cells. Using immunohistochemistry, 
positivity was less frequent than previously reported for melan-A (1/11) and cathepsin K (2/12).  Keratin 7 was positive in 4/11 and 
keratin 20 in 5/10 (Figure 1B). There was patchy staining for 2SC in 6/9, although not diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic, and FH was 
normal / retained (10/10). All tumors tested were positive for alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR, 9/9). CA9 focal or patchy 
labeling was present in 4/10. More than half (7/11 with stage data) were at least pT3a, and 2 had lymph nodes involved at 
presentation. 
Figure 1 - 844 
 
Conclusions: In this novel series of RCC with TFEB amplification, the most consistent morphological patterns shared across a 
majority of the tumors included papillary or pseudo-papillary architecture, eosinophilic cytoplasm, an infiltrative growth pattern and 
prominent nucleoli, although a clear cell or chromophobe-like patterns were present in a minority. Florid cytoplasmic vacuoles were 
noted in one. Novel findings include relatively common keratin 20 positivity, overlapping with eosinophilic solid and cystic RCC and 
a lesser rate of melanocytic markers / cathepsin K than previously described.

Background: Several publications have suggested that Black men with clinically localized prostate cancer have worse pathological 
radical prostatectomy (RP) findings than White men. This study evaluates whether race is an independent predictor of the 
pathologic outcomes at RP after controlling for other risk factors associated with locally advanced disease in a tri-ethnic population. 
 
  
 
S837 
Design: We studied 2,528 men (529 Black, 1,046 White Hispanics, and 953 White non-Hispanics) who had RP at a single 
institution. All cases were re-reviewed. Using a multivariate COX regression model, the independent predictive value of race as a 
clinical prognostic factor was analyzed and controlled for patient age, PSA density, tumor volume, Grade Group, and tumor 
location. 
Results: In univariable analysis, Black men were younger than Hispanics and non-Hispanics (60.6 vs 62.5 vs 64.1 y, p<0.001), 
had higher PSA density (0.26 vs 0.22 vs 0.2, p<0.01), and had BMI in between two other ethnicities (28.2 vs 28.5 vs 27.9, 
p=0.003). There was no significant difference between Black, White Hispanic, and White non-Hispanic men in age, PSA density, 
tumor volume, prostate wight, Grade Group, surgical margin status, stage or presence of lymph node metastasis at RP. Higher 
pathological T stage and lymph node metastasis correlated with higher Grade Group, higher tumor volume, higher PSA density, 
and posterior tumor location. In multivariable analysis, Grade Group, age, PSA density, tumor volume, and posterior tumor location 
directly correlated in with advanced local stage. Black ethnicity inversely corelated with advanced local stage compared to White 
Hispanic and White non-Hispanics (OR: 0.71; p=0.025). 
Conclusions: We demonstrate that in our region population, race may have an independent influence on behavior of prostate 
cancer as shown by RP findings in this study. With other variables being the same, Black men tend to have a better pathologic 
outcome than white Hispanics and white non-Hispanics at RP which contrasts with the prior reports. Both socioeconomic and 
genealogical (e.g., African or Caribbean origin) reasons can possibly contribute to different findings. A separate on-going study will 
examine disease progression in these populations. 
 
846   Predicting NF1 Expression in Renal Tubules and Kidney Cancer Subtypes using Nuclear 
Hematoxylin Features

Disclosures: Wei Zhang: None; Deepika Sirohi: None; Mei Kho: None; Beatrice Knudsen: None 
Background: Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) is a tumor suppressor protein that negatively regulates the RAS/MAPK pathway. In the 
nucleus, genetic modifiers that intersect with NF1 loss determine NF1-associated tumor formation and severity. We hypothesized 
that nuclear hematoxylin features are associated with loss of NF1 and IHC staining intensity of NF1 in single cells. 
Design: The study cohort includes 97 cases of 50 clear cell carcinomas (ccRCC), 30 chromophobe carcinoma (CRCA) and 17 
papillary carcinomas (PRCA). 6 cores from each case were displayed on a tissue microarray (TMA) and stained by IHC with a 
validated NF1 antibody.  Image analysis using the open-source QuPath software included cell classification and segmentation of 
nuclei within renal tubules. H-scores of NF1 intensity were calculated in benign and cancer cores (IHC-NF1). Nuclear hematoxylin 
features (n=33) of renal tubular epithelial cells were used to train machine learning (ML) algorithms (linear regression, decision 
tree, random forest and XGBoost) to predict NF1 expression levels (ML-NF1) in single cells from renal tubules and from kidney 
cancers. 
Results: Three subgroups of tubules were identified with high, low and absent IHC-NF1 expression. The average IHC-NF1 
expression in all kidney cancer subtypes was below that of low-level NF1 tubules (Fig 1). PRCA had the lowest IHC-NF1 
expression, followed by ccRCC and CRCA. To train ML models that predict NF1 expression in single cells, benign tissues were 
separated into training, validation and test groups at the case level, regardless of cancer type. Renal tubules were outlined to 
extract nuclear hematoxylin features defined by QuPath. Trained XGBoost and Random Forest (RF) models outperformed linear 
regression and decision tree models using IHC-NF1 scores as ground truth (R2XGBoost=0.53). Comparing IHC-NF1 and ML-NF1 
scores revealed good concordance for subgroups of tubules. ML-NF1 scores in kidney cancers were below those of renal tubules, 
however, the difference of average ML-NF1 scores between kidney cancer subtypes was lower than the difference of IHC-NF1 
scores (Fig 2). 
 
  
 
S838 
Figure 1 - 846 
 
Figure 2 - 846 
 
Conclusions: Loss of NF1 expression in three subtypes types of kidney cancer suggests a role of NF1 in kidney cancer 
tumorigenesis. NF1 expression levels in renal tubules and kidney cancers can be predicted using nuclear features, providing novel 
insights into an association between nuclear morphology and cytoplasmic NF1 expression. 
 
847   Diagnostic Discordance of Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma between Biopsy and 
Nephroureterectomy Specimens: A Tertiary Cancer Center Experience

Disclosures: Jianping Zhao: None; Bogdan Czerniak: None; Charles Guo: None 
Background: Upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UUTUC) arises from the renal pelvis and ureter. It is challenging to provide 
an accurate diagnosis of UUTUC on a small biopsy specimen due to technical difficulty of obtaining sufficient tissue at these 
locations. Here we evaluated the diagnostic discordance of UUTUC between matched biopsy and nephroureterectomy specimens 
at our institution and studied possible causes of the discordance. 
Design: We searched our pathology file and found 100 patients with UUTUC who underwent retrograde biopsy and 
nephroureterectomy at our institution from 2014 to 2018. Eight patients showed only urothelial carcinoma in situ or no residual 
tumor in the nephrourectomy specimens after neoadjuvant treatment, and they were excluded from the study.  H&E slides from 
biopsy and nephroureterectomy specimens were reviewed for pathologic analysis. Medical records were reviewed for clinical and 
demographic data.  
Results: The patients included 64 men and 28 women with a mean age of 69 (range 47-93) years old. The tumors were located at 
the ureter (26 cases) or renal pelvis (66 cases). 22 patients (24%) showed low-grade UC on biopsy specimens but high-grade UC 
on the matched nephroureterectomy specimens. The size of biopsy specimens (based on the greatest dimension) in the discordant 
group (mean 0.6 cm, range 0.1-2 cm) was significantly smaller than that in the concordant group (mean 0.9 cm, range 0.2-3.2 cm) 
(p<0.05), and the minimum specimen size in the concordant group was 0.2 cm. 24 patients (26%) had noninvasive UC on biopsy 
specimens but invasive UC on the matched nephroureterectomy specimens. Although the size of biopsy specimens did not show a 
significant effect on the discordance of stromal invasion (p>0.2), the tumor size in the discordant group (mean 3.9 cm, range 1.3-
7.6 cm) was significantly larger than that in the concordant group (mean 2.9 cm, range 0.4-5 cm) (p<0.05). The discordances of 
tumor grade and stromal invasion were not significantly associated with the tumor location. 
Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the diagnostic challenges of UUTUC on small biopsy specimens. The size of biopsy 
specimen and tumor size are two significant factors that contribute to the diagnostic discordance between matched biopsy and 
nephroureterectomy specimens. To reduce the diagnostic discordance, a minimal size of 0.2 cm may be required for upper urinary 
tract biopsy specimens.

Disclosures: Lan Zheng: None; Hui Chen: None; Jianping Zhao: None; Bogdan Czerniak: None; Sinchita Roy-Chowdhuri: None; 
Charles Guo: None 
Background: Plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma (PUC) is a distinct subtype of bladder cancer that demonstrates an aggressive 
clinical behavior. Recent studies have revealed that PUC is enriched with somatic mutations of the CDH1 gene, leading to the 
frequent loss of E-cadherin expression. However, the mutational profile of PUC remains to be studied. We aim to analyze the 
mutational profile of PUC in correlation to its pathological and clinical features. 
Design: We searched our pathology files from 2010 to 2020 and identified 51 patients with PUC of the urinary bladder who had 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) tests. The molecular analysis included gene mutations, copy number variations (CNV), and 
gene fusions. Histologic slides were reviewed for pathological analysis. Clinical data were collected from the medical records. 
Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. 
Results: The patients included 43 men and 8 women, with a median age of 64 years (range, 41-91 years) (Table 1). PUC 
component accounted for a mean of 47% of bladder tumor specimen (range, 5-100%). Other UC subtype components were 
coincidently present in 11 cases. NGS tests demonstrated distinct somatic gene mutations in all PUC, and the most common gene 
mutations were TP53 (56%), followed by TERT (39%), CDH1 (35%), and ARID1A (32%) (Fig. 1A). CNV data were available for 34 
patients, and 13 showed CNV in ERBB2 (2), CCND1(2), CCNE1(2), and other genes (7). No gene fusion was present in any 
patients (0/12). The median follow-up time was 19 months (range, 1-72 months). Individual gene mutations did not show any 
significant effect on the clinical outcome, but gene mutations in the mTOR pathway (PICK3CA or PIK3R1 mutations) were 
associated with significantly worse prognosis (p<0.05). (Fig. 1B).

Conclusions: PUC demonstrates distinct somatic gene mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, which may underlie 
its aggressive behavior. A subset of plasmacytoid UC also shows distinct CNV in several oncogenes. Furthermore, gene mutations 
in the mTOR pathway are associated with poor outcome, indicating a potential therapeutic value of mTOR inhibitors in PUC.

Background: Fumarate hydratase–deficient renal cell carcinoma (FH-RCC) is a rare subtype of renal cancer caused by FH gene 
mutations. FH negativity and S-2-succinocysteine (2SC) positivity on immunohistochemistry can be used to screen for FH-RCC, 
but insufficient. FH mutation could promote aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) expression. We compared 
AKR1B10, 2SC, and FH as diagnostic biomarkers for FH-RCC. 
Design: We retrospectively reviewed data on 544 RCC cases treated at our hospital from 2012 to 2022. We included 58 
genetically confirmed FH-RCCs, 83 genetically confirmed TFE3 translocation RCCs (TFE3-tRCC), 188 clear cell RCCs (ccRCC), 
128 chromophobe RCCs (chRCC), and 97 papillary RCCs (pRCC). 
Results: FH gene variants were detected in 58 FH-RCC cases. Among them, 24 patients had germline FH mutations, 27 patients 
had somatic FH mutations, and seven patients had germline and somatic mutations. All FH-RCC tumors demonstrated diffuse and 
strong staining for AKR1B10 (Fig 1). In contrast, 26.5% of TFE3-tRCCs and 21.6% of pRCCs were positive for AKR1B10 (Fig 2). 
All ccRCC and chRCC cases were negative for AKR1B10. Thus, AKR1B10 had 100% sensitivity and 91.4% specificity for FH-
RCC. All genetically confirmed FH-RCCs were 2SC positive; among them, 45 (77.6%) cases were positive in both the nucleus and 
cytoplasm, and 13 (22.4%) cases were positive only in the cytoplasm (Fig 1). Among other RCCs, 2SC positivity was found in 
26.8% of pRCCs, 15.7% of TFE3-tRCCs, 3.2% of ccRCCs and 6.25% of chRCCs, all of which were cytoplasmic positivity (Fig 2). 
2SC showed 100% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. Of the 58 FH-RCCs, FH was negative in 49 cases, partly positive in 8 cases, 
and completely positive in 1 case (Fig 1). Other RCCs were negative for FH. FH was 100% specific, but 84.3% sensitive. The 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed AKR1B10 performed best, with an area under the ROC curve 
(AUC) of 0.957, followed by 2SC (0.943) and FH (0.922). For the combined markers, AKR1B10+/2SC+ showed the best diagnostic 
performance, with an AUC of 0.980. The others showed equal AUCs of 0.922.

Conclusions: AKR1B10 served as a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic biomarker and combining with 2SC is useful to screen 
for FH-RCC. AKR1B10+/2SC+/FH- cases can be diagnosed as FH-RCC without molecular testing. Patients with 
AKR1B10+/2SC+/FH+ should be referred for FH genetic tests after excluding TFE3-tRCC and oncocytic pRCC.

850   Should Grade Group 1 Prostate Cancer Be Reclassified as “Non-cancer”? A Pathology 
Community Perspective

University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 4University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, 5UTSouthwestern 
Medical Center, Dallas, TX 
Disclosures: Ming Zhou: None; Ali Amin: None; Priya Rao: None; Farshid Siadat: None; Rajal Shah: None 
Background: Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of Grade Group (GG) 1 prostate cancer remains a significant health care problem 
despite of its improved risk assessment and uptake in conservative management. Removing the cancer label from these non-lethal 
cancers has been proposed as an expedient way to reduce potential physical, psychological and financial harm to patients. 
Recently there have been an renewed effort from our clinical colleagues to implement such a name change. Such a nomenclatural 
change necessitates a multidisciplinary team effort by clinicians and pathologists.  Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) 
recently conducted a survey of its members, gauging their awareness of this controversy and their position on whether GG 1 
prostate cancer should be reclassified. 
Design: Full active members of GUPS with voting privilege (n=338) were invited to participate in the survey by completing a 
Google form containing 9 questions (https://www.gupathsociety.org/GG1-questionnaire/). The first 6 questions queried 
respondents’ position on removing the cancer label from GG 1 prostate cancer, the specimen type (biopsy vs radical 
prostatectomy) and reasons for which they supported or opposed such a change. The last 3 questions concerned respondents’ 
demographics, training, and working experiences. 
Results: 240 (71.0%) members completed the full survey. Most respondents (196, 81.7%) opposed removing the cancer label from 
GG 1 cancer, 33 (13.8%) supported a change in nomenclature, while 11 (4.6%) responded that they were uncertain. Of those who 
supported the reclassification, 17 (51.5%) supported the change for radical prostatectomy only, 4 (12.1%) for biopsy only, and 12 
(36.4%) for both biopsy and radical prostatectomy. The reasons for and against as well as the potential consequence of  such a 
name change are listed in the Table.  
Respondents who opposed a name change for GG 1 cancer selected the following reasons 
(respondents could choose more than one): 
a. Current biopsy techniques may not adequately sample cancer and may miss high-grade 
cancer (82%) 
b. Grade alone does not dictate the biology of GG 1 prostate cancer (63%) 
c. Poor interobserver reproducibility in the grading of prostate cancer, especially for certain sub-
patterns of Gleason 4 and 5 (62%) 
d. Lack of robust biomarkers for detection of unsampled high-grade prostate cancer (61%) 
Conversely, respondents who supported a name change selected the following reasons (respondents 
could choose more than one): 
a. Removing the cancer label would lead to fewer cancer diagnoses, treatments, treatment-
related side effects, reduction in psychological and financial burden related to cancer 
diagnosis and treatment (49%) 
b. There are precedents in cancers of other organs including bladder, thyroid and soft tissue for 
which cancer label is removed due to their excellent prognosis and management 
implications (43%) 
c. GG 1 cancer behaves clinically like precancer rather than cancer (33%) 
d. Contemporary detection and management of GG 1 cancer reflects a precancer rather than 
cancer (28%) 
Respondents that opposed a change in nomenclature were concerned about potential consequences, 
including: 
a. Overgrading of 3+3=6 to 3+4=7 (GG2) by pathologists to avoid potential litigation (74%) 
b. Significant modifications in diagnosis, grading, and reporting practices of prostate cancer 
(72%) 
c. Health care disparities in many parts of the world would create significant challenges in 
adopting new recommendations (57%) 
d. Overutilization of genomic testing and biomarkers in the work up of such cases (47%) 
Conclusions: Majority of pathologists opposed to removing the cancer label from GG prostate cancer. This survey results highlight 
the gap between pathologists and clinicians in whether GG1 prostate cancer should be labeled as “non-cancer” and calls for 
continued debates and conversations between pathologists and clinicians, and further studies on the biology, diagnostic 
reproducibility, and ideal management of GG 1 prostate cancer in order to make a more evidence-based decision for patients.

Bladder and its Clinical Implication.

Disclosures: Ruoji Zhou: None; Alcino Gama: None; Bonnie Choy: None; Xiaoqi Lin: None; Joshua Meeks: None; Ashely Ross: 
None; Ximing Yang: None 
Background: Muscularis propria (MP) invasion of bladder cancer is a strong indicator of radical cystectomy. However, 
distinguishing smooth muscle of MP from that of lamina propria (LP) can be difficult because the descriptions of “thin and wispy” 
being LP and “large and thick” being MP are vague and subjective. We conducted quantitative measurement of smooth muscle 
bundles in LP and MP using digital analysis. Furthermore, we evaluated Smoothelin immunostaining in differentiate smooth 
muscles in LP from MP. 
Design: A total of 14 whole slide images (13 H&E and 1 Smoothelin-immunostains) containing full thickness of bladder wall were 
generated using an Aperio GT 450 digital slide scanner (Leica). Aperio eSlide Manager (Leica) was used for measurement of 
thickness of H&E stained or Smoothelin-stained smooth muscle bundles. 
Results: Total 366 foci of HE stained smooth muscle bundles were measured based on morphology and location, including 195 
foci of LP and 171 foci of MP. The average thickness of smooth muscle is 37.5 μm (range, 8.1-128.2) in LP, and 290.0 μm (range, 
70.2-994.8) in MP. Vast majority (97.4%, 190/195) of the measured muscle bundles in LP were less than or equal to 100μm while 
95.9% (164/171) of the measured MP were greater than 100 μm.  There was overlap between the thickness of muscle in LP and 
MP ranging from 50 μm to 150 μm (5/195 bundles in LP, 7/171 bundles in MP).  All LP muscle bundles measured were less than 
150 μm, while only 19 measured MP muscle bundles were smaller than 150 μm, and the small bundles in MP could be due to 
incomplete sectioning. The positive Smoothelin staining were categorized into three intensity groups: weak (1+), intermediate (2+) 
and strong (3+). The average thickness is 39.6 μm (range 12.1-105.9) in smooth muscles stained 1+, 85.1 μm (range, 12.1-105.9) 
in 2+ staining, and 227.1 μm (range, 60.2-676.4) in 3+ staining. 99.5% (194/195) of smooth muscle staining weakly positive was 
less than 100 μm; while 92.0% (161/175) of the smooth muscle stained strongly positive is more than 100 μm.

Conclusions: Measurement of bladder smooth muscle bundles provides a benchmark to differentiate the LP from MP for better 
cancer staging.  Using 100 μm as a cutoff, the specificity for MP is 97.4% and sensitivity is 95.9%. While using 150 μm cutoff, the 
specify is 100% and sensitivity is 88.9% (152/171) (Table). In the uncertain cases, strong Smoothelin immunoreactivity (2+ and 
3+) can be helpful to further distinguish MP from LP.

Background: Upper tract urothelial carcinomas (UTUCs) occur in about 5-10% of all UCs and are frequently discovered at a high-
stage disease. Adjuvant treatment options are rare. Similar to that for breast carcinoma, a recently published consensus 
classification divided muscle-invasive UCs of the urinary bladder (UCB) into different molecular groups, including luminal, basal, 
neuroendocrine(NE)-like, and mesenchymal(MES)-like type. A surrogate immune marker panel was previously proposed for the 
simplified molecular classification of muscle-invasive UCB. Since new treatment options may arise from the molecular classification 
of UC, the classification of UTUC into luminal, basal, and non-luminal-non-basal subtypes in particular would be important, but data 
in the upper urinary tract are sparse. Our aim was to perform a simplified molecular classification of UTUCs according to the 
consensus classification for muscle-invasive UCB and to correlate it with several known molecular changes such as microsatellite 
instability (MSI) status. 
 
  
 
S844 
Design: In a tissue microarray-based approach, immunohistochemical analyses were performed on 186 invasive UTUCs. Except 
for CD56 and synaptophysin, which were considered positive when expressed >2% in tumor cells, the immunoreactive score 
(Remmele-Stegner score) was applied to evaluate FOXA1, CK20, GATA3, CK5/6, and CD44v. Morphologic features including the 
presence of a distinct mesenchymal stroma were determined on full tissue sections and considered for classification. For 
correlation analyses, the results of previous subgroup analyses on ERBB2 amplification, MSI, and FGFR3 mutation status were 
included. Survival analyses evaluated the prognostic value of the molecular subgroups. 
Results: UTUC were classified as follows: 74 luminal, 44 basal, 14 NE-like, and three cases as MES-like subtype (Fig. 1A-D). A 
subgroup classification was not achievable in 46 UTUCs. Nine/20 UTUC with ERBB2 amplification were luminal-type. Seven, 5, 
and 10 UTUCs harboring MSI were assigned to the luminal, basal, and non-luminal-non-basal type, respectively. Comparing 
to UTUC of no special type, the patients with UTUC classified as MES-like showed a significant shorter overall survival 
(OS)(p=0.028; log-rank test; Fig. 2). 
Figure 1 - 852 
 
Figure 2 - 852 
 
 
Conclusions: The majority of UTUCs can be classified into molecular groups using a surrogate immune marker panel in 
combination with morphological features. This categorization could serve to optimize individualized adjuvant treatment decisions. 
 
853   Molecular Diversity of Testicular Embryonic-Type Neuroectodermal Tumors (ENT; former 
PNET) Arising from Germ Cell Tumors

California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 
Disclosures: Yang Zong: None; Alexandra Drakaki: None; Douglas Lin: None; Huihui Ye: None 
Background: Testicular PNET arising from germ cell tumors (GCT) is a rare type of somatic transformation in GCT with poor 
prognosis and limited therapeutic options, particularly when patients develop disease recurrence or metastasis. Knowledge of key 
events driving this transformation is limited to the paucity of comprehensive genomic data. We sought to characterize the genomic 
features of these rare tumors to potentially aid in molecular classification and treatment. 
Design: A retrospective database search of a CLIA- and CAP-certified reference molecular laboratory (Foundation Medicine, Inc.) 
was performed for PNETs arising from testicular germ cell tumors that had previously undergone NGS-based comprehensive 
genomic profiling (CGP) during the course of clinical care.  Clinicopathological and genomic data was centrally re-reviewed. 
 
  
 
S845 
Results: Here we report the molecular features of 12 advanced testicular PNETs of GTC origin. Patient age ranged from 24 to 49 
years, with a mean and median of 36 and 38 years.  CGP was performed in 1 primary tumor and 11 metastases, whose submitting 
diagnoses were testicular PNET or ENT with or without an associated classical GCT component. All tumors harbored gain of 
chromosome 12p, often with KRAS, CCND2 and KMD5A co-amplification, supporting a germ cell origin, and all were negative 
for EWSR1 fusions.  The tumors were microsatellite stable and exhibited low tumor mutational burden. 3 tumors (25%) 
exhibited MYCN or MYC amplification with co-occurring inactivation of the p53 pathway via either TP53 mutations 
or MDM2 amplification in 2 tumors. 3 additional tumors (25%) had activation of the PI3K pathway 
via PIK3CA and PIK3CG mutations or PIK3C2B amplification; one tumor with co-occurring CDK4 amplification.  Fusions or 
rearrangements were detected in 3 tumors (25%), such as an internal truncating ATRX rearrangement with no partner, as well as 
novel BRD4-MAU2 and BCOR-CLIP2 fusions.  The 2 cases with BRD4 and BCOR fusions were reminiscent of the emerging CNS 
embryonal tumor (CNS-PNET) entities that are defined by molecular alterations, such as CNS HGNET-BCOR (PMID: 26919435). 
Figure 1 - 853 
 
Conclusions: PNETs arising from GCT are molecularly heterogeneous; however, a subset may be stratified by alterations in 1) 
MYCN/MYC/TP53/MDM2, 2) PIK3 pathways or 3) fusions that overlap with molecularly defined CNS-PNETs entities.  Additional 
studies examining the prognostic and therapeutic implications of our findings are warranted.
