Abstract
This study developed an innovative biosensor strategy for the sensitive and selective detection of canine mammary tumor 
biomarkers, cancer antigen 15–3 (CA 15–3) and mucin 1 (MUC-1), integrating green silver nanoparticles (GAgNPs) with 
machine learning (ML) algorithms to achieve high diagnostic accuracy and potential for noninvasive early detection. The 
GAgNPs-enhanced electrochemical biosensor demonstrated selective detection of CA 15–3 in serum and MUC-1 in tissue 
homogenates, with limits of detection (LODs) of 0.07 and 0.11 U ­mL−1, respectively. The nanoscale dimensions of the 
GAgNPs endowed them with electrochemically active surface areas, facilitating sensitive biomarker detection. Experi-
mental studies targeted CA 15–3 and MUC-1 biomarkers in clinical samples, and the biosensor exhibited ease of use and 
good selectivity. Furthermore, ML algorithms were employed to analyze the electrochemical data and predict biomarker 
concentrations, enhancing the diagnostic accuracy. The Random Forest algorithm achieved 98% accuracy in tumor presence 
prediction, while an Artificial Neural Network attained 76% accuracy in CA 15–3-based tumor grade classification. The 
integration of ML techniques with the GAgNPs-based biosensor offers a promising approach for noninvasive, accurate, and 
early detection of canine mammary tumors, potentially revolutionizing veterinary diagnostics. This multilayered strategy, 
combining eco-friendly nanomaterials, electrochemical sensing, and ML algorithms, holds significant potential for advanc-
ing both biomedical research and clinical practice in the field of canine mammary tumor diagnostics.

Introduction
Canine mammary tumors are primarily observed in elderly 
dogs, especially after 6 years of age [1, 2]. The prevalence 
of malignant lesions in canine mammary tumors ranges 
from 26 to 73% [3–5]. As canine mammary tumors share 
similarities with human breast cancer, understanding its 
mechanism is crucial for preventing human breast cancer 
progression. Additionally, biomarkers used for diagnosis, 
treatment options, and prognosis determination are com-
mon to both [6]. Biomarkers are proteins that express 
characteristics specific to each cancer cell and are usually 
measurable in the blood or other tissues (such as tumor 
tissue). They can provide valuable information about the 
presence of a disease, treatment outcomes, and patient 
prognosis. When these proteins known as tumor-associ-
ated antigen are found in other tissues, serum, or urine 
at quantities that differ from those of healthy individu-
als, they serve as biomarkers. Malignant transformation 
is thought to be the cause of their increasing production 
[7–9]. Integrins, immunoglobulin-like particles, cadher-
ins, cancer antigen 15–3 (CA 15–3), carcinoembryonic 
antigen (CEA), and selectins are biomarkers involved in 
intracellular adhesion [10]. The mammary gland associ-
ated-antigen MUC1, also known as episialin, polymor-
phic epithelial mucin, can be assessed through CA 15–3 
[11]. CA 15–3 (in serum), also expressed as mucin 1 or 
MUC1 (in tissue), is overexpressed in tumoral cells and 
enters the bloodstream [12]. Detecting these biomarkers 
in tissue, blood, or various other body fluids aids in early 
diagnosis, tumor grading, prognosis, and monitoring of 
response to treatment in bitches with mammary tumors 
[13]. CA 15–3 was determined using a variety of methods, 
such as immunosorbent enzyme-linked assays, chemilumi-
nescence immunoassays, enzyme immunoassay, radioim-
munoassay (RIA), and electrochemical and photoelectro-
chemical immunoassays [14]. However, because of their 
long process, difficult label collection, and other errors, the 
approaches are unable to address the growing clinical need 
for the rapid detection of CA 15–3. Furthermore, conven-
tional techniques might not be able to detect tumor mark-
ers at incredibly low concentrations, which emphasizes the 
necessity of developing novel nanoscale strategies.
By incorporating these small size and exceptional mor-
phology, nanostructures play a pivotal role in advancing 
cancer diagnosis and treatment. With the assistance of 
nanomaterials, electrochemical biosensors can traverse 
biological barriers and reach specific human tissues and 
cells. Biosensors leverage the precise electrochemical 
performance of nanosensors by integrating a biologically 
derived recognition element into a physico-chemical 
converter [15–20]. This combination holds the potential 
for exciting developments in the field of cancer research 
enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of early-stage can-
cer detection and monitoring. When compared to tradi-
tional analytical methods such as immunohistochemistry 
or ELISA, biosensors are remarkably easy to use and reli-
ably produce findings, partly due to their small particle 
sizes (lab-on-a-chip devices) [18].
Machine learning (ML) is frequently employed as a rapid 
method for training machines and developing predictive 
algorithms that facilitate efficient decision-making in data 
science [21, 22]. The evaluation of tumor size and grade by 
ML contributes to the determination of mammary tumor 
type and aids in early diagnosis. ML computational models 
stand as the most effective techniques in biomedical fields 
and data science for obtaining favorable clinical data for pre-
diction and classification of target problems. The application 
of ML in tumor detection and the prediction of tumor pres-
ence or absence has been proposed to advance breast tumor 
research. Additionally, ML approaches may be utilized 
to predict the size and severity of a tumor. Traditionally, 
disease diagnosis relies on human observation to identify 
specific signal features. In conditions such as tumor, where 
early detection is vital, the development of computer-aided 
diagnostic approaches has accelerated in data science. These 
methods aim to transform qualitative diagnostic criteria into 
quantitative features, thereby enhancing classification accu-
racy. In a review, Teng et al. presented innovative biosen-
sor developments for detecting prostate tumor, highlighting 
the utilization of both single and multiple biomarkers. The 
potential of ML to improve biosensor performance metrics 
in prostate tumor diagnosis was also underscored [20]. In 
another study, Pennacchio et al. proposed a bacterial biosen-
sor that utilizes gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified with a 
hydrophobin chimera combined with ML algorithms and a 
simplified process for immobilizing antimicrobial peptides, 
which enables cost-effective measurement of bacterial con-
tamination [18]. By integrating ML algorithms with an NP-
based biosensor, clinical data can be analyzed intelligently 
and accurately, leading to improved identification of tissue 
and serum sample biomarkers that are both selective and 
sensitive. In addition to enhancing in sensitivity and accu-
racy of sophisticated sensor applications, this technique 
supports real-time analysis and intelligent evaluation. The 
integration of ML algorithms holds the potential to trans-
form several industries, including biotechnology, point-of-
care services, health monitoring, and early disease diagnosis 
due to its innovative capabilities.
The novelty of this study lies in its multifaceted approach 
to biosensor development and biomarker detection in bio-
medical and sensor applications. Firstly, the utilization of 
GAgNPs provides an eco-friendly and cost-effective alterna-
tive in the field of canine mammary tumor sensors. These 
nanoparticles were instrumental in developing a unique 
5073
Enhancing electrochemical detection through machine learning‑driven prediction for canine…
electrode modification, facilitating the creation of a sensi-
tive impedimetric immunosensor capable of quantitatively 
detecting canine mammary tumor biomarkers, specifically 
CA 15–3 and MUC-1, in serum and tissue homogenate 
samples. Additionally, the antibodies coated on the GAg-
NPs improved the sensor’s sensitivity and selectivity of the 
sensor by enhancing the coating on the working electrode. 
With a broad linear concentration range of 5 to 100 U ­mL−1, 
the biosensor demonstrated selective detection of CA 15–3 
and MUC-1, boasting respective LODs of 0.07 and 0.11 U 
­mL−1 within a 60-s voltammetric cycle. Furthermore, the 
sensor exhibited ease of use and good selectivity in detect-
ing CA 15–3 and MUC-1 in clinical canine serum and tissue 
homogenate samples, underscoring its efficacy in diagnosing 
canine mammary tumors. Secondly, the integration of ML 
techniques enhances the biosensor’s predictive capabilities, 
enabling accurate predictions of biomarker concentrations 
for CA 15–3 and MUC-1. Notably, ML predictions further 
enhanced the diagnostic accuracy. Overall, this innovative 
biosensor strategy holds significant promise for advancing 
of veterinary diagnostics.
Material and method
Materials
The powdered maca root, purchased from Arioğlu Company 
(Türkiye), has the following composition are as follows pro-
tein (14.30), water (6.28), ash (3.22), and oil (1.31). Moreo-
ver, it has 1.25 mg ­g−1 of glucosinolate, 0.16 mg ­g−1 of 
maca amide, and 0.18 mg ­g−1 of alkaloid. Sodium hydroxide 
(NaOH) was purchased from Merck Company (Germany). 
Whatman® qualitative filter paper (diam. 25 mm) and silver 
nitrate ­(AgNO3, purity ≥ 99.0%) were obtained from Sigma-
Aldrich Company Ltd. (USA). All samples were filtered 
using a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and 
a sterile syringe filter with a 0.45-µm retention. All chemi-
cals and reagents were used as received without further 
purification.
Animal material
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Istan-
bul University-Cerrahpaşa, Veterinary Faculty Ethics Com-
mittee Unit (2021/55, 16.11.2021). Bitches brought to our 
clinic with malignant mammary tumors were included into 
the study (n = 17), they underwent bilateral mastectomy for 
the treatment of mammary tumors, and during this opera-
tion, superficial inguinal lymph nodes at both sites were also 
extirpated. After the operation, the extirpated tissues were 
sent to pathology for histopathological examination and to 
evaluate of lymph node metastasis. Prior to surgery, 5 mL 
of blood samples were collected from each bitch. One gram 
of mammary tissue samples from the suspected tumorous 
lesions was obtained postoperatively. At the owner’s request, 
a 4-year-old spayed Cocker Spaniel bitch underwent a pre-
ventive (prophylactic) bilateral mastectomy, resulting in 
the acquisition of a normal mammary gland from the right 
inguinal mammary lobe. Upon palpation of all mammary 
glands, no tumoral lesions were detected, and the control 
group (n = 1) had no prior history of endocrine or mammary 
disorders. Additionally, a 5-mL blood sample was taken 
from this bitch before surgery. The determination that there 
of no size variation in the axillary and popliteal lymph nodes 
in all bitches included in the study was confirmed by palpa-
tion. To investigate the presence of lung metastasis, three 
projections of thorax radiography (left lateral to right lateral 
(Li-Ld), right lateral to left lateral (Ld-Li), and ventrodorsal 
(VD)) were taken from all the bitches with mammary tumors 
in the study. A complete blood count and chemistry panel 
were among the laboratory tests performed on all the bitches 
in the study to detect any unusual changes that could affect 
serum CA 15–3 concentration (hepatic and kidney diseases) 
and bilateral mastectomy operation. Only the bitches with 
blood parameters within the reference ranges were included 
in the study. All blood samples were centrifuged at 3500 rpm 
for 20 min, and the extracted serum samples were stored 
at − 86 °C until use. A gram of mammary tissue samples 
(g) was defatted in the laboratory and homogenized (Mic-
cra D-1, ART, moderne Labortechnik e.K., Germany) in 
4 mL of PBS (pH 7.2). Then, this mixture was centrifuged at 
3500 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. All supernatants were collected 
and stored in centrifuge tubes (1.5 mL) at − 86 °C until use. 
After collection, all tissue homogenates and serum samples 
were stored in a cold chain for electrochemical biosensor 
applications. Additionally, tissue samples from each animal 
underwent pathological examination for histopathological 
analysis and immunohistochemical determination of the 
MUC-1 biomarker.
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
Tissue samples taken for histopathological examination and 
immunohistochemical labeling were fixed in 10% neutral 
buffered formalin solution for 48 h. Routine tissue follow-
up procedures were performed, and paraffin blocks were 
prepared. The sections were cut at a thickness of 4 µm and 
stained with dyes (hematoxylin and eosin), and histopatho-
logical evaluation was performed under a light microscope 
(Nikon Eclipse Ci-L). The tumor samples were diagnosed 
and graded histopathologically according to Goldschmidt 
et al. [5] and Pena et al. [23], respectively.
Each case was labeled with MUC-1 antibody using the 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) technique. Sections, 4-µm 
thick, were taken on positively charged glass slides and

deparaffinized by incubation in a dry oven at 65 °C, fol-
lowed by immersion in xylene, and then passed through 
graded ethyl alcohol concentrations from high to low 
(100%, 96%, 85%, and 70%, respectively) and rehydrated 
in distilled water. They were then washed three times with 
0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS; pH 7.4). To block 
endogenous peroxidase activity in the tissues, the sections 
were incubated in 0.3% ­H2O2 in methanol for 20 min at 
room temperature. Subsequently, the sections were heat-
treated in a microwave oven for 20 min in pH 6.0 citrate 
buffer solution. Protein blocking was performed using the 
serum cocktail included in the IHC staining kit (Thermo 
Scientific IHC kit Cat. No.TP-125-HL). The polyclonal 
rabbit anti-MUC-1 antibody (Ab Clonal, Cat. No. A0333) 
was diluted to 1/100 and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. 
After the primary antibody incubation, the sections were 
washed with PBS. The secondary antibody and HRP solu-
tion were applied for 10 min each. Following additional 
washes, the reaction was completed with 3,3′-diaminoben-
zidine (DAB; Thermo Scientific Cat. No. TA-125-HD). 
The sections were then incubated for 5 min in Mayer’s 
hematoxylin for background staining and covered with 
coverslips. The stained preparations were evaluated based 
on the extent and intensity of the staining. Immunohisto-
chemical staining was evaluated using a light microscope, 
and MUC-1 staining reactions were scored as follows: no 
staining (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and intense (3) based 
on the extent and intensity of staining [24]. All micro-
scopic examinations were independently evaluated by two 
pathologists, and the final scores were determined by com-
paring the results. Digital micrographs were obtained from 
H&E- and IHC stained preparations with at Nikon Eclipse 
Ci-L microscope and a Nikon DSQi2 camera system. All 
images were enhanced using Macromedia Fireworks 8, at 
the same settings.
Cell culture
To check the sensitivity of the sensor, canine mammary 
carcinoma cell line CMT-U27 was used as a positive con-
trol. Chemicals used in the cell culture were products 
of Gibco (Invitrogen, CA, USA). CMT-U27 cells were 
maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium/Nutri-
ent Mixture F-12 supplemented with 1% L-glutamine, 1% 
penicillin–streptomycin solution, and 10% fetal bovine 
serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% ­CO2 at 
37 °C. The culture medium was changed every 2 days. 
When cells reached 80–90% confluence, a 0.25% trypsin/
EDTA solution was added to remove adherent cells from 
the surface. For immunocytochemistry, 1 × ­105 cells/well 
were seeded on coverslips in 24-well plates and incubated 
overnight.
Immunocytochemistry
To demonstrate MUC-1 expression in the CMT-U27 cell 
line, the medium was aspirated with the pipette over cells 
grown on coverslips in 24-well plates. Without allowing the 
cells to dry, 1000 μL each of methanol cooled at -20°C was 
added, and the cells were incubated at -20°C and fixed under 
this condition for 20 minutes. Methanol was aspirated from 
the wells, followed by immediate washing three times with 
PBS (pH 7.4). After incubation in 0.3% ­H2O2 prepared in 
methanol for 10 min at room temperature, the wells were 
washed three times with PBS, and coverslips were removed 
from the wells and transferred onto parafilm. The coverslips 
were then incubated with the protein block solution in the 
IHC kit for 15 min, followed by incubation with MUC-1 
antibody diluted 1/200 for 60 min at room temperature. After 
incubation, coverslips were washed again with PBS. The 
secondary antibody and then horseradish peroxidase were 
applied for linking. The reaction was completed with DAB. 
Mayer Hematoxylin was performed for background staining.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was conducted to assess the relation-
ships between clinical variables and tumor grades, aiming 
to enhance the understanding of their interdependencies and 
impact on cancer diagnostics. Spearman’s rank correlation 
coefficient was used as the primary method for this analysis. 
This choice is due to its non-parametric nature, making it 
suitable for not-perfectly normally distributed data and ordi-
nal variables. The dataset comprised 17 entries, with vari-
ables including “Location,” “Size,” “Lymph Node Metas-
tasis,” “Lung Metastasis,” “MUC-1 Expression.” Each of 
these variables was assessed for its association with tumor 
grade. Spearman’s correlation was selected for its ability to 
measure the strength and direction of association between 
ranked variables.
Preparation of electrochemical biosensor
In our previous study, we detailed the synthesis of GAgNPs 
via a cost-effective ultrasonication method at room tem-
perature [25]. The prepared GAgNPs were produced at a 
reasonable cost by using ultrasonication at 25 °C. To create 
the green solution, maca root powder was cleaned, dried 
in a vacuum oven at 70 °C, combined with distilled water, 
and allowed to sit at 25 °C in the dark for 5 days. Following 
filtration through a sterile syringe filter with a micron size 
of 0.45, 0.42 g of ­AgNO3 and 0.1 g of NaOH were dissolved 
in 250 mL and 125 mL of distilled water, respectively. After 
adding the NaOH solution dropwise to the silver solution, 
5075

the mixture was sonicated for half an hour at room tempera-
ture. Ultimately, a sterile syringe filter with a 0.45 µm was 
used to filter the final nanostructure.
In this study, electrochemical tests were performed at 
25 ± 1 °C using the Ebtro Voltammetric Electrochemical 
workstation (Türkiye). Gold electrodes (Ebtro instruments, 
Türkiye) with a surface area of 2 ­cm2 were used as work-
ing electrodes, and alternating current voltammograms were 
recorded from − 0.05 to − 0.45 V and a scanning rate of 
50 mV ­s−1 at 25 °C. The electrodes were equilibrated in PBS 
(pH 7.4) until a stable current peak was observed. Before the 
single layer was formed, the gold electrodes were cleaned 
with DI ­H2O, polished with a 0.1-μm diamond solution 
(Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL), and sonicated for around 5 min 
in a low power sonicator to get rid of bound particles. After 
that, the working electrodes underwent a series of oxida-
tion and reduction cycles in 0.5 M ­H2SO4 between − 0.3 and 
1.5 V to electrochemically wash them. For the Ag NP-based 
sensors, following the cleaning process, the Au electrodes 
were rinsed with deionized water, dried using ­N2 gas, and 
modified with the nanoformulation. To prepare the biosen-
sors, we applied 10 μL of GAgNPs solution onto a gold-
coated electrode and dried it in an oven at 50 °C for 5 min. 
Following this, the GAgNPs-coated sensor was left to rest 
at room temperature for 15 min. For electrochemical meas-
urements, we treated the GAgNPs-coated sensor with 3 μL 
of antibody solution (Ab1), and it stored in the refrigerator 
for 1 h. Subsequently, we washed the electrode surface with 
PBS 7.4 solution to remove any unbonded capture antibody 
and obtain the Ab1/GAgNPs-coated sensor. As a control, the 
sensor was prepared using the same procedure, except with-
out immobilizing Ab1. To detect CA 15–3 (4.9 mg ­mL−1, 
MYBioSource) and MUC-1 (0.5 mg ­mL−1, Biolegend), 
10 µL of MUC-1 and CA 15–3 antibodies (concentration 
ranging from 500, 2000, 50,000, and 100,000 cells ­mL−1 in 
50 mM PBS buffer) were dropped onto the prepared Ab1/
Ag NPs-coated sensor and incubated for 30 min at room 
temperature.
Electrochemical analysis of clinical serum and tissue 
homogenate samples
The clinical serum samples obtained from bitches for this 
study were supplied by the Istanbul University-Cerrahpaşa, 
Veterinary Faculty, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecol-
ogy clinic (Table 1). All the collected blood samples were 
centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min and were subsequently 
diluted tenfold with PBS solution (“Animal material" sec-
tion). These serum samples were collected from various 
bitches before the surgical procedure. Prior to the electro-
chemical analysis, serum samples were prepared follow-
ing the procedure described earlier (“Histopathology and 
immunohistochemistry” section). Subsequently, various 
concentrations of CA 15–3 (500, 2000, 50,000, and 100,000 
cells ­mL−1) were dissolved in tenfold diluted serum for the 
electrochemical analysis. Following this preparation step, 
measurements were taken by dripping 10 µL of CA 15–3/
MUC-1 protein-based solutions (pH 7.4), serum samples, 
and tissue homogenates onto the sensor surface.
Machine learning‑based prediction of tumor grade 
using electrochemical data
In this research, an extensive application of ML algorithms 
was applied to enhance the prediction of tumor grades based 
on cyclic voltammetry (CV) data from canine mammary 
tumors. The dataset was based on CV measurements derived 
from canine serum and tissue homogenate samples. These 
measurements were crucial for determining the concentra-
tions of the specific biomarkers, CA 15–3 and MUC-1, asso-
ciated with the presence of mammary tumors. The initial 
phase of the analysis involved a feature engineering process 
designed to transform raw CV data into a structured format 
suitable for ML algorithms. Features crafted from the CV 
readings were aimed at capturing the complex behavior of 
the electrochemical responses associated with canine mam-
mary tumor biomarkers, CA 15–3 and MUC-1. From the raw 
CV data, several features were derived that encapsulate both 
the basic and complex characteristics of the electrochemical 
curves.
•	 Charge (Q): Represents the total charge involved in the 
electrochemical reaction, integral to understanding the 
overall activity level of the biomarker.
•	 Half-peak potential: Indicates the potential at which the 
current is half of its peak value, providing insights into 
electrochemical kinetics.
•	 Peak width at half height: Measures the width of the 
peak at its half-maximum, related to the dispersion of the 
signal and indicative of the reaction uniformity.
•	 Mean current and median current: These statistical 
measures give an average level of current during the CV 
measurement, reflecting the general behavior of the bio-
marker’s electrochemical response.
•	 Standard deviation, kurtosis, and skewness: These fea-
tures describe the distribution of current readings, offer-
ing details on the variability, tailedness, and asymmetry 
of the electrochemical signal, respectively.
•	 Peak derivative and peak second derivative: Reflect 
the first and second rates of change of the current, impor-
tant for identifying subtle shifts in the electrochemical 
response.
•	 Positive and negative peak currents: Indicate the maxi-
mum upward and downward peaks, respectively, provid-
ing a direct measure of the biomarker’s highest and low-
est electrochemical activities.

•	 Positive and negative peak potentials: The potentials 
at which the maximum and minimum currents occur are 
crucial for understanding the electrochemical properties 
of the biomarker.
Following the feature engineering, a correlation analysis 
among the engineered features was performed. This step 
was crucial to identify the dependencies and relationships 
among the variables, which could influence the subsequent 
ML models. Feature importance was assessed using the 
Random Forest algorithm. This approach was employed 
to determine which features that significantly influence 
the predictive models. The importance assigned to each 
feature guided the selection process for the most relevant 
variables, thereby ensuring that the models focused on the 
most impactful data. ML algorithms were then tested for 
their ability to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor 
samples. This classification performance testing was criti-
cal to validate the effectiveness of the algorithms in mak-
ing accurate diagnostic predictions. Separate classification 
models were developed for CA 15–3 and MUC-1 samples 
to classify the tumor grade. Each biomarker was analyzed 
using a tailored set of ML algorithms to accurately predict 
the severity and grade of the tumors. A variety of ML mod-
els have been explored for their effectiveness in predicting 
tumor presence, and grades, including Ensemble Methods 
such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, were 
known for their robustness against overfitting and ability to 
handle complex datasets, as well as Artificial Neural Net-
works (ANN), which were employed for their superior pat-
tern recognition capabilities to model complex interactions 
within the electrochemical data.
A leave-one-out cross-validation strategy was employed 
to train the models, ensuring their generalizability of the 
models and mitigating overfitting. The rigor of this method, 
where each sample in the dataset is used once as the test set, 
while the remaining samples from the training set allows for 
a thorough assessment of the model performance.
The effectiveness of each model was evaluated using vari-
ous 
metr ics. 
The 
accuracy, 
def ined 
as 
Accuracy =
TP+TN
TP+TN+FP+FN , measures the overall correctness 
of the model. Precision, calculated as Precision =

TP+FP , 
assesses the model’s ability to identify only relevant 
instances as positive. Recall, or sensitivity, quantified by 
Recall =

TP+FN , evaluates the model’s ability to identify all 
actual positives. The F1-score, which is the harmonic mean

Precision+Recall , providing a balance between 
precision and recall in cases of uneven class distributions. 
These metrics collectively furnished a comprehensive 
assessment of each model’s capacity to classify the tumor 
grades accurately.
Post-validation, the models were integrated into a diag-
nostic framework that utilizes real-time CV data to predict 
tumor grades. This integration was intended to markedly 
enhance both the accuracy and timeliness of tumor clas-
sification, thereby improving the effectiveness of treatment 
planning.
The entire process, from data collection through the sen-
sor to the final classification of tumor grades, is detailed in 
a flow chart included in this section (Fig. 1). This visual 
representation aids in understanding the sequential steps 
involved in the methodology, highlighting the logical pro-
gression from raw data processing to detailed ML analysis.

In this study, 17 bitches were between 8 and 13 years of 
age (median age, 11.17 ± 1.59 years). The involved bitches’ 
mean weights were noted as 17.52 ± 8.17 kg which were 
suffering from malignant mammary tumors in this study. 
Control bitch (n = 1) was 4 years old and weighed 20 kg. The

bitches were from different breeds, such as Mix (n = 6), Ital-
ian Greyhound (n = 1), Border Terrier (n = 2), Boxer (n = 1), 
American Cocker Spaniel (n = 3), Golden Retriever (n = 2), 
Yorkshire Terrier (n = 1), and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel 
(n = 1), and control bitch’s (n = 1) breed was Cocker Spaniel 
in this study. During the clinical inspection, the location 
of the mammary lobes where the primary malignant mam-
mary tumor development was detected as follows: nine of 
them were detected in the inguinal lobes (M5), five in the 
caudoabdominal (M4), and three in the cranioabdominal 
(M3) mammary lobes. After X-ray evaluation, distant lung 
metastasis was detected in two of these animals (Fig. 2). All 
clinical details are shown in Table 1.
Sorenmo et al. reported that the occurrence of malignant 
mammary tumors can be increased in elderly bitches with 
the range of 7–13 years, which is in line with our findings 
(11.17 ± 1.59 years) [26, 27]. Edmunds et al. [28] reported a 
higher incidence of mammary tumor formation according to 
the breed distribution as Setter, American Bulldog, Spaniel, 
Akita, Yorkshire Terrier, and Cocker Spaniel. In this study, 
the mix breed (n = 6) is found to be the most predominant 
breed to malignant mammary tumor formation. Since car-
cinomas are epithelial tumors, they metastasize to regional 
lymph nodes and distant organs, primarily to the lungs via 
the lymphatics [29]. Sarcomas are mesenchymal tumors and 
metastasize directly to the lungs via the bloodstream. The 
most active mammary lobe in terms of tumor development 
in dogs is the 3rd cranioabdominal, 4th caudoabdominal, 
and 5th inguinal mammary lobes [30–32]. Metastasis of 
tumors to these lymphatics is also very important. While 
the caudoabdominal and inguinal mammary lobes drain into 
the superficial inguinal lymph node, the cranioabdominal 
mammary lobes drain mostly into the axillary lymph node 
and secondarily into the superficial inguinal lymph node; so, 
the tumors tend to metastasize to these lymph nodes firstly 
if they are of epithelial origin [33, 34]. A link has been 
determined between malignant canine mammary tumors 
and tumor location previously. Mammary tumors generally 
occur in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th lobes. It has been determined

that mammary tumors in these lobes have more malignant 
characteristics than those in other lobes [35, 36]. This study 
found a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) between 
the histological malignancy degree of mammary tumors 
and their location, in line with the literature. However, his-
tological grading was found to increase as the tumor size 
increased. In addition, in line with the results stated in that 
study reported by Yamagami et al., the prognosis of bitches 
was also worsened, and lymph nodes and distant metastases 
can be occurred [37]. In this study, a statistically significant 
difference (P < 0.01) was found between the histological 
grade and the size of the tumor. In addition, there is a posi-
tive relationship between the degree of histological malig-
nancy and lymph node/lung metastases and the age of the 
bitches in this study. It has been determined that the risk of 
mammary tumor development increases with age in bitches 
[38]. Grading the tumor not only gives the clinician impor-
tant information regarding treatment but also allows the 
clinician to have information about the follow-ups required 
throughout the animal’s life. Grading of the tumors is based 
on some parameters such as tubule formation, nuclear atypia, 
and mitotic count [39]. Karayannopoulou et al. reported that 
grade III tumors have a poor prognosis as they can spread 
to lymph nodes than grade I and II tumor types [40]. Addi-
tionally, sarcomas can be more aggressive than carcinomas 
in bitches [39].
Histopathological findings
Sixteen of the tumors were histopathologically evaluated 
as carcinoma and one as sarcoma. The histological sub-
types and their corresponding numbers of tumors were as 
follows: intraductal papillary carcinoma (n = 1), carcinoma 
with a simple-tubular or tubulopapillary pattern (n = 6), solid 
carcinoma (n = 2), complex-type carcinoma (n = 3), mixed-
type carcinoma (n = 3), sarcoma (n = 1), and adenosqua-
mous carcinoma (n = 1). The case of intraductal papillary 
carcinoma showed a stratified population of duct epithelial 
cells with malignancy-related characteristics. Carcinomas 
with a tubulopapillary pattern or simple tubulary were com-
posed of neoplastic cells, predominantly cuboidal epithelial 
cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm in tubular or tubulopapil-
lary morphologies (Fig. 3A, B). These cells had large oval 
vesicular nuclei and showed marked nuclear pleomorphism, 
hyperchromaticity, and abnormal nuclear structures. Two 
cases were diagnosed as carcinoma-solid type, character-
ized by tumoral cell clusters with numerous mitotic figures 
(Fig. 3C). The carcinoma-complex type included luminal 
and myoepithelial neoplastic cells arranged in the tubules 
and solid groups (Fig. 3D). Mesenchymal and epithelial neo-
plastic components were involved in the carcinoma-mixed 
type (Fig. 3E). One case was diagnosed as sarcoma, while 
the other was diagnosed as adenosquamous carcinoma. 
Adenosquamous cell carcinomas were identified by islands 
and cords of epithelial cells containing keratin filaments 
with the formation of keratin pearls (Fig. 3F). Microscopi-
cally, tumor metastasis was detected in the superficial ingui-
nal lymph nodes in six of a total of 17 cases (Fig. 4). Four 
of these cases were simple carcinoma, one was a complex 
carcinoma, and the other was a sarcoma with lung involve-
ment. All details such as tumor types, grades, and metastasis 
situations related to the cases are summarized in Table 2. 
Canine mammary tumors can include epithelial (adenoma 
or carcinoma), mesenchymal (sarcomas), or rarely myoepi-
thelial cells (benign mixed tumors or carcinosarcoma), com-
bined or separately [41]. Although studies have shown that 
the types of malignant dog mammary tumors are different in 
most countries, most of these tumor types have been found 
to be carcinomas. This study obtained a result compatible 
with this literature [41].
Immunohistochemistry findings
MUC-1 labeling was detected predominantly in the luminal 
epithelium of the tumors at various levels. A tissue sam-
ple was obtained from an animal without a tumoral story 
to compare MUC-1 expression between tumoral tissues 
and normal mammary glands. Histologically, the sample 
exhibited mild hyperplastic and fibrous reactions. Immuno-
histochemically, benign hyperplastic areas demonstrated a 
slightly positive reaction, especially on the apical surfaces 
of the luminal epithelial cells (Fig. 5A), whereas the neo-
plastic epithelium showed strong positivity, especially in 
carcinoma-simple (tubulopapillary) types (Fig. 5B and C). 
One of the carcinoma-solid cases showed negative MUC-1 
expression (Fig. 5D), whereas the other displayed slight 
positivity. The immunohistochemical reactions of the car-
cinoma-complex type and mixed-type tumors were compa-
rable. In both tumor types, only the luminal epithelium was 
positive (Fig. 5E). CMT-U27 cells exhibited strong positiv-
ity for the MUC-1 antibody in immunocytochemistry stain-
ing (Fig. 5F), and the immunolabeling results are shown in 
Table 2. However, MUC1 antibodies were higher in grade 
III tumors, indicating tumor aggressiveness [42]. An impor-
tant finding of this study is the expression of MUC-1 in 
benign canine mammary gland lesions. The reaction was 
mostly observed in the apical membrane of epithelial cells 
and extended to the cytoplasm of the luminal epithelial cells. 
This result is in absolute agreement with those observed in 
human and canine mammary tissues [43, 44]. When we eval-
uated the distribution of the positivity of the MUC-1 among 
mammary tumor cases, 11 of the 17 tumors were stained 
with different intensities. The MUC-1 positive staining rate 
was 54.5%. Manuali et al. stated that they observed MUC1 
activity in 68% of the analyzed cases that displayed strong 
immunostaining in a mixed pattern (involving the entire cell 
5079

surface and the cytoplasm), which comprises the whole cell 
population in several carcinoma samples. These findings are 
similar to those of our study. According to previous studies, 
a higher expression of MUC-1 is detected in more metastatic 
cancers [45]. In this study, six metastases were detected in 
superficial inguinal lymph node (SILN) metastases positive. 
However, only one metastatic case showed strong positivity 
for MUC-1, whereas the others were negative for MUC-1 
expression. One of these metastatic cases was a sarcoma. 
This can be explained by the negative MUC-1 expression. 
The other four metastatic mammary tumor cases conflicted 
with the previous data. However, there was no meaning-
ful relationship between MUC-1 expression and the type 
and grade of the tumors in our study. Manuali et al. showed 
that CA 15–3 has a positive correlation with tumor grade 
(higher CA 15–3 serum concentrations were observed in 
grades II and III than in grade I carcinoma types). Addi-
tionally, high levels of CA 15–3 were correlated with poor 
clinical stage and a poor prognosis. Apart from that, the 
study confirmed that tumor size, skin ulceration, necrosis, 
inflammation, and histological type of mammary cancer 
have no relation to serum levels of CA 15–3 [44]. This con-
troversy can be explained by the histologically heterogene-
ous structures of canine mammary tumors. The CMT-U27 
(ductal invasive carcinoma) cell line is a cell line consists 
of a single cell type showing epithelial or myoepithelial 
cell morphology isolated from the mammary gland of a 
14-year-old female dog. It expresses low levels of cytokera-
tin, vimentin, and smooth muscle actin (SMA) filaments. 
The CMT-U27 cell line expresses 25% progesterone but 
not estrogen [46]. The cell line is examined for studies of 
mammary carcinomas, comparative in vitro studies of mam-
mary tumors, and preclinical testing of drugs in veterinary 
oncology [47]. In this study, CMT-U27 cells were used as 
positive control to verify the efficacy of the CA-15–3 probe. 
First, an immunocytochemical staining was performed to

show MUC-1 expression in CMT-U27 cells. The cells were 
labeled strongly with the MUC-1 antibody, as in a previous 
study showing MUC-1 positivity in CMT-U27 cells [44]. 
Campos et al. have investigated the level of MUC1 in tissue 
and CA-15–3 in serum of dogs with mammary gland cancer 
additionally they have investigated how the two markers cor-
relate with the evolution of disease [48]. They have reported 
that the increased concentrations of MUC1 in the serum of 
dogs with mammary cancer are associated with the presence 
of metastasis to regional lymph nodes [48]. In some of our 
cases, an increased MUC-1 was observed in animals with 
metastasis, and this strong immunopositivity with MUC-1 
correlated with the advance of disease. These results indicate 
that determining the expression of MUC-1 by IHC helps to 
predict the malignancy of tumor in dogs with a mammary 
tumor. In literature, it is reported that CA 15–3 is the most 
preferred serum biomarker in breast cancer patients with its 
low sensitive properties, and the detection of CA 15–3 in 
the diagnosis of primary breast cancer is insufficient. For 
this reason, it is used in monitoring approaches, especially 
when other markers such as CEA are detected at the same 
time. In veterinary medicine, the published studies were 
made based on a small number of heterogeneous patients. 
Therefore, more studies need to be done before it can be 
considered as an adequate biomarker [49]. In this study, we 
did not identify any significant correlation between tumor 
type, tumor grade, metastasis status, and MUC-1 expression, 
in which is consistent with the findings of Kazsak (2018) 
[49]. We attribute these results to the heterogeneous nature 
of canine mammary tumors. Additionally, our investigation 
determined that MUC-1 expression does not yield effective 
results as a biomarker in tissue samples. Furthermore, our 
study suggests that evaluating MUC-1 expression by immu-
nohistochemistry is not a very suitable technique for canine 
mammary tumors.
The histopathological diagnosis and MUC-1 expression 
in IHC were summarized in Table 2 in this study.
Statistical analysis of clinical, histopathological 
and immunohistochemical data in predicting tumor 
grade
The Spearman’s correlation coefficients and their corre-
sponding P-values were calculated for each variable against 
tumor grade. The results are summarized in Table 3.
The analysis revealed that “Location” and “Size” are 
significantly correlated with tumor grade, with P-values 
indicating strong statistical significance (below 0.05). This 
suggests that these variables are important predictors of the 
severity of tumor and could be vital in clinical assessments 
and further research into tumor grading. Conversely, vari-
ables such as “Lymph Node Metastasis,” “Lung Metastasis,” 
“MUC-1 Expression” did not show significant correlations 
with tumor grade. The higher P-values suggest that there is 
insufficient evidence to conclude a strong association with 
tumor grade, indicating that they may be less critical in pre-
dicting tumor severity within this dataset.

Electrochemical results
In this study, we conducted electrochemical measure-
ments on the electrodes to track the stepwise alteration of 
the electrode and the changes in the sensing interface fea-
tures after modification with GAgNPs. This analyze aimed 
to determine the concentrations of CA 15–3 and MUC-1 
biomarkers in blood serum and tissue homogenate samples, 
respectively. Figure 5 illustrates the sensitive and selective 
detection capabilities of the GAgNPs-coated sensor, pre-
senting comparative results from the measurements. For 
CA 15–3, assessments were conducted on blood serum 
samples, demonstrating the Ab1/GAgNPs-coated sensor’s 
efficacy in detecting and quantifying biomarker within a 
biological matrix commonly used in clinical diagnostics. 
Similarly, the sensor’s performance in detecting MUC-1 
from tissue homogenates underscores its potential for tissue-
based diagnostics, offering valuable insights into the tumor 
microenvironment. According to the electrochemical results 
presented in Fig. S1, a noticeable increase in the redox peak 
current for the biosensor is observed with rising concentra-
tions of biomarkers. As both the tumor grade and biomarker 
(CA 15–3 and MUC-1) concentrations increase, the Ab1/
GAgNPs-coated sensor redox peaks at higher values. This 
enhancement can be attributed to the larger active area and 
higher electronic conductivity of the GAgNPs, which facili-
tate the accelerated interfacial electron transfer.
The combination of nanomaterials with electrochemi-
cal biosensors offers the potential to at once monitor sev-
eral cancer signals. These devices are highly beneficial in 
the early diagnosis of malignancies and are distinguished 
by their rapidity, simple use, and affordability. In 2018, 
Pacheco et al. developed a molecularly imprinted polymer 
(MIP)-based electrochemical sensor for monitoring breast 
cancer. The sensor was created by directly imprinting CA 
15–3 onto a screen-printed gold electrode (Au-SPE). A

linear relationship was established between the peak cur-
rent intensity of the redox probe and the logarithm of the 
CA 15–3 concentration within the range of 5 to 50 U ­mL−1, 
achieving a LOD of 1.5 U ­mL−1 [50]. In 2023, AlGhamdi 
et al. synthesized a Fe–gallic acid MOF embedded in an 
epoxy methyl cellulose polymer thin film. With a sensitivity 
range of 0.05–570 U ­mL−1, they created this to identify CA 
15–3 in the serum of breast cancer patients. In comparison 
to existing detection techniques, this affordable and reliable 
probe demonstrated a LOD of 0.01 U ­mL−1 [14]. Oliveira 
et al. developed a printed electrode on paper using carbon 
nanotube ink, graphite pencil, and silver nanoparticles 
(AgNPs) ink. In this study, they modified the electrode with 
gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and a MIP to target CA 15–3. 
Despite shortcomings in saliva samples, the CNE/AuNP/
MIP sensor showed promise for detecting CA 15–3 levels in 
serum [51]. Despite recent advances, these methods are still 
in their infancy, and further studies are required to offer real-
time and in-situ sensing abilities. Comparing the suggested 
biosensor to counterparts listed in Table 3, it has a greater 
linear range, a remarkable LOD for CA 15–3 detection and 
is simpler and easier to fabricate. Advanced nanomaterial 
techniques, frequently involving hazardous chemicals and 
labor-intensive preparation processes of the high prices and 
energy consumption, are the foundation of many investi-
gations listed in Table 3. By using a green nanomaterial-
based detecting method and needing less preparation time, 
our sensor is more economical. Using the Ab1/GAgNPs-
coated biosensor, specific interaction between anti-CA 15–3 
antibody and CA 15–3 antigen results in the formation of 
an immunocomplex. Using a redox mechanism, this tech-
nique allows for indirect CA 15–3 detection. The binding 
of CA 15–3 to the recognition sites of the Ab1/GAgNPs-
coated sensor is essential for the biosensor to work. The 
current signal is correlated with the amount of CA 15–3 
because this binding event masks the probe’s electrode trans-
fer and reduces the electrochemical response (see Table 4). 
The experimental findings confirmed that CA 15–3 and 
MUC-1 electrochemical immunosensors were successfully 
constructed and can sense substances. We sought to deter-
mine if antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) binding was responsible 
for the observed alterations in the electrochemical signal 
using experimental investigations with control groups and 
different analytes. It was discovered that the current signal

in the control group and with other analytes remained mostly 
constant by analyzing the CV graphs of the experimental 
group (electrode modified with Ab) and the control group 
(electrode without Ab) using the ML technique. Targeting, 
however, the biomarkers in the experimental group resulted 
in a notable change in the current signal. These experimental 
results clearly show that the immunological sensor is sensi-
tive and selective.
The performance characteristics of the immunosensor for 
the various analytes are depicted in Fig. 6. The sensitivity of 
the immunosensor is illustrated in Fig. 6A, demonstrating 
the detectability of target analytes, including CA 15–3 and 
MUC-1. The biosensor exhibits selective detection of CA 
15–3 and MUC-1, with LOD of 0.070 and 0.112 μM, respec-
tively, alongside a high sensitivity of 0.0045 and 0.0031 
μA/cm2 mM, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6A. Figure 6B 
showcases the immunosensor’s selectivity, wherein diverse 
analytes, such as fructose (12 mM), galactose (12 mM), glu-
cose (12 mM), lactose (12 mM), maltose (12 mM), oxytocin 
(10 IU ­mL−1), progesterone (2.2 mg ­mL−1), prostaglandin 
(250 µg ­mL−1), CA 15–3 (100 U ­mL−1), and MUC-1 (100 
U ­mL−1). This thorough experimental research demonstrates 
the immunosensor’s selectivity identifying biomarkers. The 
distinct responses of the immunosensor to CA 15–3 and 
MUC-1 at specific doses emphasize its selectivity towards 
these target biomarkers. In this study, the selectivity anal-
ysis for various biomarkers and compounds revealed that 
CA 15–3 exhibited the highest selectivity value of 2.843, 
demonstrating excellent specificity in its detection within 
the tested set. Similarly, MUC-1 also showed substantial 
selectivity with a value of 2.002, indicating its effective dif-
ferentiation from other substances. Additionally, Fig. 6C and 
D presents the correlation coefficients between CV-derived 
characteristics and the canine mammary tumor grade for 
CA 15–3 and MUC-1, respectively. These coefficients offer 
crucial insights into the relationship between the electro-
chemical characteristics and severity of canine mammary 
tumors, aiding in diagnosis and disease tracking.
Machine learning‑based prediction of tumor grade 
using CV data
This section presents the findings from the application 
of ML algorithms to predict tumor presence and grade in 
canine samples using differential pulse voltammetry data. 
A correlation analysis was conducted to refine the feature 
set and enhance the accuracy of the models by analyzing 
the relationship between which is the engineered features 
and tumor grades for both CA 15–3 and MUC-1 biomark-
ers. This analysis, summarized in Table 5 and illustrated 
in the correlation chart (Fig. 6C–D), was instrumental in 
identifying the features that were most significantly relate 
to the severity of the tumor, thereby guiding the selection 
of features for subsequent modeling. For CA 15–3, features 
such as kurtosis (0.462), peak derivative (0.332), and peak 
second derivative (0.332) were found to demonstrate rela-
tively higher positive correlations, indicating their strong 
predictive power regarding tumor grade. In contrast, skew-
ness (− 0.404) and median current (− 0.316) were found to 
exhibit significant negative correlations, suggesting that 
lower values of these features correspond to higher tumor 
grades. Similarly, for MUC-1, median current (− 0.541) 
and peak width at half height (− 0.443) were observed to 
show strong negative correlations, while the peak deriva-
tive (0.360) and kurtosis (0.295) displayed positive correla-
tions, underlining their relevance in predicting tumor sever-
ity. These insights obtained from the correlation analysis

are crucial for optimizing the predictive models for both 
biomarkers.
Following the correlation analysis, a feature importance 
analysis was conducted to further refine the understanding 
of the variables which most significantly impact the predic-
tive models. A tree-based ensemble method was employed 
to estimate the importance of each feature in predicting 
tumor grades. The importance score assigned to each fea-
ture reflects its utility in enhancing the model's predictive 
accuracy, with higher scores indicating a greater influence 
on the model’s output. The results of the feature importance 
analysis are presented in Table 6. It enumerates the features 
along with their importance scores for each biomarker, offer-
ing a clear comparison of their relevance. For the MUC-1 
biomarker, the most influential features, all with importance 
scores above 0.08, include charge (Q), mean current, peak 
second derivative, median current, kurtosis, skewness, and 
standard deviation. These features significantly contribute to 
the model, underscoring the diverse aspects of the CV signal 
that correlate with tumor severity. Similarly, for CA 15–3, 
features such as kurtosis, skewness, median current, peak 
second derivative, and positive peak current were identified

Enhancing electrochemical detection through machine learning‑driven prediction for canine…
as the most important, each surpassing the 0.08 importance 
threshold. This suggests that features related to the distri-
bution’s shape (kurtosis and skewness) and specific peak 
characteristics (median current and peak second derivative) 
are crucial for predicting tumor grade from CA 15–3 data.
The features selected for their high importance scores 
were utilized to train predictive models. The approach 
ensures that the models are not only accurate but also effi-
cient, mitigating overfitting by excluding less informative 
features. By focusing on high-importance features, the 
models are closely aligned with the underlying biological 
and chemical phenomena evident in the CV data, thereby 
enhancing their clinical relevance and potential applicability.
Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and ANN algo-
rithms are employed for developing a predictive model to 
determine the presence of tumor in canine samples. The 
dataset included CV signals from 18 samples (17 tumorous 
and one control). Each sample was represented by multiple 
features derived from CV analysis, as previously outlined 
in the feature importance section. The performance of each 
algorithm was evaluated based on its accuracy in correctly 
classifying the samples as tumorous or non-tumorous. The 
accuracies achieved were as follows:
•	 Random Forest: 98%
•	 XGBoost: 96%
•	 LightGBM: 95%
•	 ANN: 97%
These results indicate a high level of predictive accuracy, 
with Random Forest performing slightly better than the other 
models. Given the varied nature of these algorithms, rang-
ing from ensemble tree-based methods to neural networks, 
this spread in performance underscores the robustness of 
the predictive modeling process, confirming that multiple 
advanced techniques are capable of high-precision tumor 
detection using electrochemical data.
The high accuracy rates achieved by these models 
emphasize their potential in clinical settings, where rapid 
and reliable tumor diagnostics are critical. The success of 
these algorithms in distinguishing between tumorous and 
nontumorous samples, even in a small dataset, suggests 
that the CV data contain significant diagnostic information 
that can be effectively extracted using ML algorithms. This 
capability could lead to improvements in noninvasive tumor 
diagnostics, offering faster, less costly, and more accessible 
options for veterinary medicine, and potentially adaptable 
methods for human healthcare.
Building on the successful detection of the presence of 
tumor in canine samples, the research advanced to the next 
phase: predicting the tumor grade based on CV data. Accu-
rate tumor grading is crucial for determining the appropri-
ate treatment strategies and making prognostic evaluations. 
Accurate training with cross-validation was conducted for 
each model to ensure that the findings were robust and not 
artifacts of the specific data split. For the CA 15–3 bio-
marker, the ANN model demonstrated the highest accuracy, 
achieving a 76% success rate in tumor grade predictions, 
which was notably superior compared to the other mod-
els. This result underscores the ANN’s ability to capture 
complex patterns and interactions within the CA 15–3 data, 
likely attributable to its layered structure and nonlinear 
processing capabilities. Conversely, the results for MUC-
1, though slightly less effective overall, still demonstrated

Conclusion
In conclusion, it was determined that CA 15–3 in serum 
could be detected more sensitively rather than MUC-1 in tis-
sue by biosensor and that the biosensor allowed the CA 15–3 
tumor biomarker to be detected even at lower concentrations 
in serum samples in this study. The superior performance of 
CA 15–3 in predictive modeling, particularly with the ANN 
approach, suggests that CA 15–3 may possess more detect-
able or relevant characteristics to tumor progression stages 
than MUC-1. These findings could influence future direc-
tions, prompting further investigation into the molecular 
mechanisms underlying CA 15–3 biomarker’s capabilities. 
Moreover, the results indicate the potential in applying ML 
techniques to enhance the predictive accuracy of tumor diag-
nostics. By integrating these models into clinical settings, 
it may be possible to achieve more nuanced and accurate 
diagnosis which can be critical in tailoring treatment plans 
to individual patient needs effectively.
