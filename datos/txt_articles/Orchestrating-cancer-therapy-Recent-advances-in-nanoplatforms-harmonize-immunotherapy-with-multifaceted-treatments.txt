Advancements in cancer therapy have increasingly focused on leveraging the synergistic effects of combining
immunotherapy with other treatment modalities, facilitated by the use of innovative nanoplatforms. These
strategies aim to augment the efficacy of standalone treatments while addressing their inherent limitations.
Nanoplatforms enable precise delivery and controlled release of therapeutic agents, which enhances treatment
specificity and reduces systemic toxicity. This review highlights the critical role of nanomaterials in enhancing
immunotherapy when combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, photothermal ther-
apy, and sonodynamic therapy. Additionally, it addresses current challenges, including limited in vivo studies,
difficulties in standardizing and scaling production, complexities of combination therapies, lack of comparative
analyses, and the need for personalized treatments. Future directions involve refining nanoplatform engineering
for improved targeting and minimizing adverse effects, alongside large animal studies to establish the long-term
efficacy and safety of these combined therapeutic strategies. These efforts aim to translate laboratory successes
into clinically viable treatments, significantly improving therapeutic outcomes and advancing the field of
oncology.
1. Introduction
Immunotherapy represents a transformative frontier in oncology,
harnessing the body’s immune system to combat cancer. This thera-
peutic modality capitalizes on the specificity and adaptability of the
immune response, aiming to enhance its ability to recognize and erad-
icate cancer cells [1,2]. The strategies employed in immunotherapy
range from checkpoint inhibitors, which release the brakes on T cells to
allow them to attack cancer cells more effectively [3,4], to adoptive cell
transfer, where T cells are engineered ex vivo for enhanced tumor tar-
geting and then reintroduced into the patient [5]. Additional approaches
include cancer vaccines that provoke immune responses against
tumor-specific antigens and immunomodulators that tweak the immune
environment to tilt the balance in favor of anti-tumor activity [6,7]. By
reactivating the patient’s immune surveillance, these therapies offer a
potent means to achieve durable cancer control, potentially leading to
sustained remission and improved patient outcomes.
The efficacy of immunotherapy is often limited by a combination of
biological and clinical factors that can undermine its therapeutic po-
tential. One of the primary challenges is the inherent heterogeneity of
tumors, which include a diverse array of cancer cell subtypes within a
single tumor. This variability not only complicates the immune system’s
ability to uniformly recognize and attack tumor cells but also fosters
environments where some cancer cells can escape immune surveillance
through mutations that alter antigenic profiles [8,9]. Additionally, the
tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts a potent immunosuppressive
effect. It often features a high concentration of regulatory cells such as
regulatory
T
cells
(Tregs)
and
myeloid-derived
suppressor
cells
(MDSCs), which suppress effector T cells and natural killer cells (NK
cells) that are crucial for anti-tumor immunity [10,11]. The TME also
frequently expresses various immune checkpoint proteins, like PD-L1,
which bind to receptors on immune cells to deactivate them, thus

protecting tumor cells from immune attack [12]. Another limiting factor
in immunotherapy efficacy is the presence of metabolic barriers within
the TME, such as hypoxia and nutrient depletion, which can suppress the
proliferation and function of infiltrating immune cells [13,14]. Addi-
tionally, patient-specific factors play a critical role; genetic variations
can affect the expression and function of immune-related genes, influ-
encing how patients respond to immunotherapy [15,16].
To overcome these challenges, the field of oncology is actively
exploring combination therapies that integrate immunotherapy with
other treatment modalities, such as chemotherapy, radiation, photody-
namic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), and nanomaterial-
based systems [17]. These combination strategies aim to modulate the
TME, enhance tumor immunogenicity, and either restore or boost the
immune response. Central to these strategies are nanoplatforms, which
are transforming oncology by enhancing targeted drug delivery with
high precision [18–21]. These nanoscale platforms not only optimize
therapeutic efficacy and minimize collateral damage by precisely tar-
geting tumor cells and reducing systemic side effects, but they also
enable the integration of multiple therapeutic agents and diagnostic
markers. This facilitates the development of personalized medicine
strategies, tailoring treatments to the specific genetic and molecular
profiles of individual tumors.
This review explores the integration of immunotherapy with other
treatment modalities using nanoplatforms to overcome the limitations of
standalone immunotherapies. It begins by outlining the fundamental
principles of synergistic interactions between immunotherapy and other
therapies. The critical role of nanomaterials in facilitating these syn-
ergies is then highlighted. Importantly, we critically summarize and
review the significant applications of various nanomaterials in combi-
nation with PDT, PTT, chemotherapy, radiotherapy (RT) and sonody-
namic
therapy
(SDT),
underscoring
their
potential
to
enhance
immunotherapy efficacy, reduce side effects, and address TME chal-
lenges. Finally, the review addresses current research challenges and
future directions, offering valuable perspectives and insights for inno-
vation and advancement in cancer immunotherapy.
2. Mechanisms of the synergistic effect of immunotherapy and
conventional cancer therapies
Chemotherapy has been shown to augment the efficacy of immu-
notherapy through several mechanistic pathways that modulate the
TME. Primarily, chemotherapeutic agents induce immunogenic cell
death (ICD), which is characterized by the release of damage-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as ATP, HMGB1, and calreticulin [22,
23]. These DAMPs facilitate dendritic cell (DC) recruitment and matu-
ration, thereby enhancing antigen presentation and T cell priming. For
instance, paclitaxel (PTX) triggers ICD-associated DAMPs via TLR4
signaling, activating NF-κB and promoting antitumor immunity [24].
Additionally, chemotherapy can modulate the expression of immune
checkpoint molecules, thus sensitizing them to checkpoint inhibitors.
Platinum-based chemotherapeutics reduce the expression of the T cell
inhibitory molecule PD-L2 on human DCs and tumor cells, enhancing
antigen-specific T cell responses and Th1 cytokine secretion [25].
Moreover, it can selectively deplete immunosuppressive cell pop-
ulations, reducing local immunosuppression and fostering a more
permissive environment for immune effector functions. For instance,
PTX combined with ginsenoside metabolite compound K selectively
depletes immunosuppressive Tregs and increases T helper cell 17,
inducing cancer cell pyroptosis via the JAK-STAT pathway. In vivo
studies confirm significant inhibition of lung cancer progression, high-
lighting this combination as a promising immunotherapy strategy [26].
RT, a conventional cancer treatment, has also been increasingly
recognized for its synergistic potential with immunotherapy [27]. By
inducing DNA damage and subsequent tumor cell death, RT exposes
tumor neoantigens and releases immunostimulatory signals. This
exposure not only enhances antigen presentation but also recruits and
activates DCs, crucial for initiating T-cell responses [28]. RT upregulates
immunogenic neoantigens in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),
enhancing their presentation. Vaccination with these neoepitopes elicits
CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, boosting immunotherapy by targeting irradiated
cells and promoting Th1 cytokine production and epitope spread [29].
Furthermore, RT can modulate the expression of immune checkpoints
on tumor cells or immune cells, making tumors more susceptible to
checkpoint blockade therapies. For instance, RT upregulates PD-L1
expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the cGAS-STING
pathway, leading to immune cloaking and reduced Cytotoxic T
lymphocyte (CTL) activity. Combining RT with anti-PD-L1 therapy
augments antitumor immunity, highlighting the synergy between RT
and immunotherapy in HCC [30].
Targeted therapy has proven to be an effective complement to
immunotherapy, enhancing its efficacy through several mechanistic
pathways. By selectively inhibiting oncogenic pathways, targeted agents
can modulate the TME to improve immune visibility and responsiveness
[31]. Additionally, targeted therapies can reduce immunosuppressive
factors within the TME, facilitating a more robust immune response. For
instance, targeted therapy using an anti-WNT2 monoclonal antibody
enhances Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) efficacy in oesophageal
squamous
cell
carcinoma
and
colorectal
cancer
by
disrupting
CAF-mediated immune evasion. Anti-WNT2 restores DC differentiation
and
antitumor
T-cell
responses
via
the
SOCS3/p-JAK2/p-STAT3
signaling pathway, promoting antitumor immunity and enhancing ICI
effectiveness [32].
Similarly, PDT and PTT have been recognized for their potential to
enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy by inducing ICD and remodeling
the TME. PDT involves the activation of photosensitizing agents by light
to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause direct tumor cell
damage and subsequent release of DAMPs [33]. For instance, PDT using
aluminum-phthalocyanine in nanoemulsion (PDT-AlPc-NE) induces ICD
in CT26 and 4T1 cancer cells, marked by the emission of DAMPs.
PDT-treated cells enhance antitumor immunity in vivo, as shown in a
vaccination-challenge model [34]. Additionally, PTT utilizes photo-
thermal agents to convert light energy into heat, causing thermal
destruction of tumor cells. This thermal ablation not only results in the
release of tumor antigens but also induces a local inflammatory response
that can overcome the immunosuppressive TME [35].
SDT enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy by inducing ICD and
modulating the TME [36]. When activated by ultrasound, sonosensi-
tizers produce reactive ROS leading to tumor cell apoptosis and necrosis.
This cell death releases tumor-associated antigens and DAMPs [37].
Moreover, SDT can increase the expression of heat shock proteins and
co-stimulatory molecules, further boosting T-cell activation. The resul-
tant enhanced antigen presentation and T-cell activity contribute to a
more effective immunotherapeutic response, particularly in conjunction
with checkpoint inhibitors. For instance, SDT using ultrasound-activated
IR-780 induces significant ROS production and cancer cell death in
BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells. This process triggers ICD and the release
of DAMPs, promoting DC activation and an effective immune response
(Fig.
1)
[37].
In
summary,
combining
conventional
ther-
apies—chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, PDT, PTT, and
SDT—with immunotherapy enhances antitumor immunity by inducing
ICD, modulating immune checkpoints, and reshaping the TME to favor
immune activation. This multimodal strategy holds promise for over-
coming
immune
resistance
and
achieving
more
durable
cancer
responses.
3. Nanomaterial-driven enhancements in synergistic cancer
therapies
Nanomaterial-based systems stand at the forefront of innovative
cancer treatment strategies, particularly due to their potential to
significantly enhance the synergistic effects of combinative therapies
[38]. These systems leverage the unique properties of nanomaterials to

overcome several limitations associated with conventional cancer
therapies. Firstly, nanomaterials, through their intrinsic immunomod-
ulatory properties, hold substantial promise for cancer treatment by
reshaping the TME and enhancing immune responses. For instance, the
FDA-approved iron oxide nanoparticle ferumoxytol exhibits intrinsic
anti-tumor effects by inducing pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage po-
larization in tumor tissues. In vitro, ferumoxytol-treated macrophages
enhanced caspase-3 activity in adenocarcinoma cells and promoted
Th1-type responses. In vivo, ferumoxytol nanoparticles inhibited tumor
growth and prevented liver metastasis, highlighting their potential
’’off-label’’ application in cancer immunotherapy through macrophage
modulation [39]. In addition, silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) exhibit
intrinsic anti-tumor effects by promoting M1 macrophage polarization
within the lung TME. By activating the NF-κB pathway and glycolytic
mechanisms, SiNPs suppress lung cancer progression and modulate
pre-metastatic and metastatic niches [40]. Notably, gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) exhibit intrinsic therapeutic properties in cancer therapy by
selectively disrupting NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in macrophages
through ROS scavenging, thus reducing IL-1β production. When conju-
gated with the MDSC-targeting peptide H6, AuNPs effectively decrease
MDSC populations and IL-1β levels within the TME, enhancing T cell
activation and improving immunotherapy outcomes in PD-1-sensitive
and -resistant tumor models [41]. Moreover, titanium dioxide NPs
(TiO₂ NPs) inherently induce a pro-inflammatory response, activating
M1 macrophages and amplifying cytokine production, which correlates
with inhibited cancer metastasis. In vivo, TiO₂ NPs trigger immune cell
infiltration and systemic inflammation in liver and spleen, demon-
strating their potential to modulate immune activity against metastasis
through intrinsic immunostimulatory properties [42]. In conclusion,
these findings underscore the significant role of nanomaterials’ intrinsic
immunomodulatory properties in revolutionizing cancer treatment
strategies, fueling the development of nanomaterial-driven synergistic
cancer therapies.
Secondly, nanomaterials can be engineered to target tumor cells
specifically, minimizing off-target effects and enhancing therapeutic
efficacy. Their surface can be modified with ligands that recognize and
bind to receptors overexpressed on tumor cells, ensuring that the active
agents are delivered precisely where needed. For instance, engineered
NK cell-mimic nanoparticles (NK.NPs) incorporate death ligand TRAIL
and CD16 peptide for antibody-mediated tumor recognition. Function-
alized with anti-CD38 antibody, NK.NPs effectively targeted and killed
CD38-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in vitro, ex vivo, and
in vivo, reducing AML burden in bone marrow [43]. Additionally,
nanocarriers can encapsulate drugs, protecting them from premature
degradation and releasing them in a controlled manner at the tumor site.
This targeted delivery is crucial for therapies like chemotherapy, where
reducing systemic toxicity is a primary concern [44]. Thirdly, nano-
materials are uniquely capable of carrying multiple types of therapeutic
agents simultaneously. This co-delivery capability allows for the direct
combination
of
different
therapeutic
modalities

Fig. 1. Mechanisms of the synergistic effect of immunotherapy and conventional cancer therapies. (A) PTX activates TLR4 signaling in ovarian cancer cells,
leading to NF-κB-mediated transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and exocytotic release of ATP and HMGB1, inducing ICD. (B) Platinum-based drugs inhibit
STAT6 phosphorylation, reducing PD-L1 expression on DCs and tumor cells. This leads to decreased T cell deactivation and enhances immune surveillance, coun-
tering tumor immune evasion. (C) Targeted therapy with PTX-CK disrupts JAK2/STAT3 signaling, enhancing CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity and reducing Treg suppression.
This modulation fosters a pro-inflammatory environment conducive to tumor control by promoting the release of cytolytic proteins like granzyme B and perforin
from CD8+ T cells. (D) WNT2 antibody therapy inhibits WNT2 signaling, impacting the SOCS3/p-JAK2/p-STAT3 pathway in CAFs and DC precursors. This leads to
the activation of antigen-presenting DCs and subsequent stimulation of CD8+ T cell responses, enhancing immune surveillance against tumor cells. (E) PDT using the
photosensitizer AlPc-NE targets CT26 and 4T1 tumor cells in a mouse model, resulting in ICD. The therapy triggers the release of damage- DAMPs from dying tumor
cells, which stimulate DCs and subsequently activate effector T cells, enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. (F) Radiotherapy induces the cGAS-STING pathway in
liver cancer cells, leading to increased expression of PD-L1 through activation of IRF3 and TBK1. This modulation facilitates immune evasion by tumor cells but also
presents potential targets for enhancing the effectiveness of CTL-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells. (G) Radiotherapy exposes mutated proteins as neo-
antigens in tumor cells, enhancing their recognition by T cells. The process involves the upregulation of MHC molecules, facilitating the presentation of these
neoantigens and promoting T cell-mediated tumor cell targeting through engagement of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. (H) Sonodynamic therapy with the sonosensitizer IR-
780 in BXPC-3 tumor cells generates ROS and leads to apoptosis. The dying tumor cells release DAMPs, which activate DCs to promote an adaptive immune response
against the tumor.

platform. For instance, nanoscale coordination polymer core-shell
nanoparticles, encapsulating oxaliplatin and pyropheophorbide-lipid
conjugate
(pyrolipid),
enhance
the
efficacy
of
PD-L1
anti-
body-mediated immunotherapy in advanced colorectal cancer [45].
Fourthly, the TME often presents a significant barrier to effective cancer
treatment. Nanomaterials can alter the TME to make it more conducive
to therapy. Nano-Pt/VP@MLipo liposomes leverage platinum nano-
particles to catalyze oxygen production, altering the TME by reducing
hypoxia. This enhances verteporfin’s photodynamic effect and nano-
particle penetration, significantly improving treatment efficacy against
tumor growth and metastasis [46]. Fifthly, nanomaterials used in PDT
and PTT can induce ICD, which releases tumor antigens in a context that
is conducive to immune system activation. This not only helps in the
direct killing of cancer cells but also turns the tumor itself into a vaccine
against itself, promoting an adaptive immune response that can target
tumor
cells
systemically.
For
instance,
ER-targeting
nanosystem
combining
FAL-ICG-HAuNS
and
hemoglobin
liposomes
enhances
photodynamic and photothermal therapies, inducing ER stress and cal-
reticulin exposure under near-infrared (NIR) light. This activation
stimulates DC function and CD8+ T cell responses, boosting ICD and
anti-tumor efficacy through ROS-mediated mechanisms [47]. Lastly, the
multi-modal nature of nanomaterial-based systems can help overcome
mechanisms of drug resistance. Nanoparticles can bypass cellular efflux
pumps, a common resistance mechanism in chemotherapy, ensuring
higher intracellular concentrations of chemotherapeutics [48]. More-
over, the combination of different treatment modalities can attack
cancer cells via multiple pathways simultaneously, reducing the likeli-
hood of developing resistance (Fig. 2).
Accumulating preclinical evidence underscores the efficacy of
diverse nanoplatforms in enhancing cancer therapy. Through precise
targeting, improved pharmacokinetics, and reduced systemic toxicity,
these platforms demonstrate significant therapeutic potential across
various tumor models, offering a robust foundation for their potential
clinical application. For instance, mitochondria-targeting nanoparticles
enhance PDT efficacy in breast cancer by conserving local oxygen within
tumors. Conjugating 5-aminolevulinic acid to triphenylphosphine and
coating with folic acid enables precise mitochondrial delivery. In BALB/
c mice with MCF-7 xenografts, these nanoparticles improve PDT effec-
tiveness, confirmed by pharmacokinetic and distribution studies,
underscoring their potential to optimize PDT under anoxic conditions
[49].

ligand modification, efficient drug packaging, TME regulation, co-delivery capacity, reduction of drug resistance and induction of ICD. By engineering nanoparticles
to specifically target cancer cells with apoptosis-inducing ligands and deliver multiple therapeutic agents directly to the tumor site, these strategies reduce drug
resistance and improve treatment efficacy. Additionally, nanoparticles facilitate the induction of ICD and precisely regulate the TME. These approaches optimize
local conditions for therapies such as PDT and chemotherapy, bolstering the immune response and disrupting immunosuppressive barriers within the TME,
significantly enhancing therapeutic outcomes.

suppressed breast cancer growth and metastasis in preclinical murine
models. Leveraging macrophage cloaking and polymer conjugation, this
bioadhesive nanoparticle formulation showed high tumor specificity,
improved pharmacokinetics, and minimal systemic toxicity, under-
scoring its potential to improve cancer therapeutic efficacy [50].
Moreover,
in
preclinical
models
of
colorectal
cancer,
ALKBH5
mRNA-loaded exosome-liposome hybrid nanoparticles with folic acid
modification significantly inhibited tumor progression by modulating
the ALKBH5/JMJD8/PKM2 axis and reducing glycolysis. This nano-
particle system, tested in colitis-associated tumor models, effectively
decreased tumorigenesis, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of
targeting m6A modifications for colorectal cancer treatment [51].
Similarly, in an orthotopic osteosarcoma murine model, keratin nano-
particles co-encapsulating Chlorin e6 (Ce6) and PTX achieved a 78 %
tumor reduction with combined photodynamic and chemotherapy
significantly outperforming PTX monotherapy’s 32 % reduction. These
optimized parameters for light delivery, dosing, and treatment sched-
uling demonstrate the efficacy of nanoplatform-based combination
therapy in osteosarcoma, advancing its potential for clinical translation
[52]. Notably, glycol chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) showed varied ef-
ficacy across pancreatic tumor models, highlighting the impact of TME
differences on nanoparticle accumulation. Using non-invasive imaging,
CNP targeting efficiency was assessed in BxPC3, PDC, and PDX models,
revealing that vessel density, collagen, and hyaluronic acid content
influenced CNP delivery. PDX models reflected inter-patient TME het-
erogeneity, suggesting they may better predict clinical permeation and
retention
effects,
providing
critical
insights
for
personalized
nanoparticle-based
cancer
therapies
[53].
Collectively,
nanomaterial-based systems represent a transformative approach in
cancer therapy, enhancing the precision, efficacy, and synergy of
combinative
treatments.
By
enabling
targeted
delivery,
co-encapsulation of therapeutic agents, modulation of the TME, and
induction of ICD, these nanosystems address critical limitations of
conventional therapies. Their multi-modal functionality offers a prom-
ising avenue to overcome drug resistance, potentially leading to more
effective and durable anticancer responses.
4. Enhancing the synergistic effect of PDT and immunotherapy
with nanotherapeutic platforms
4.1. Organic-based nanomaterials
Organic nanoparticle-based PDT has recently been shown to signif-
icantly increase the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer treatment. For
instance, graphdiyne oxide (GDYO) used in PDT increases the mechan-
ical stiffness of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells, enhancing CTL re-
sponses and inflammatory cytokine production [54]. Additionally, a
charge-reversal polymer nano-modulator (SPDMC N), designed for
PDT, exploits an acidic TME to enhance tumor penetration and release
the
immunomodulator
demethylcantharidin.
Upon
NIR
photo-
irradiation, SPDMC N facilitates tumor ablation and DC maturation
while demethylcantharidin modulates the CTL/Treg ratio, significantly
inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis [55].
4.2. Hybrid organic-inorganic nanomaterials
Similarly, various types of hybrid organic-inorganic nanomaterials
have been developed to enhance PDT efficacy, which in turn amplifies
the effectiveness of immunotherapy. For instance, a novel immuno-
therapeutic nanobooster, C9SN, combines a glutaminase inhibitor with
Ce6 to potentiate PDT against tumors. By inhibiting glutamine meta-
bolism, C9SN prevents glutathione from neutralizing ROS, enhancing
cell death and ICD effects. This dual-action not only promotes DC
maturation and CTL activation but also repolarizes M2-type macro-
phages to M1-type, effectively targeting both primary and distant tu-
mors [56]. Similarly, polyethylenimine hybrid thin shell hollow
mesoporous silica nanoparticles (THMSNs), encapsulating Ce6, syner-
gize photodynamic and immunotherapy. Enhancing cellular uptake and
endosomal escape, these nanoparticles increase PDT efficiency, facili-
tating DC maturation and robust CD8+ T cell activation [36]. Interest-
ingly,
a
nuclear-targeted
photodynamic
nanostrategy
using
mSiO2-Ion@Ce6-NLS nanoparticles enhances intratumoral enrichment
and directs therapy to the nucleus. This approach triggers ICD and ac-
tivates macrophages and DCs, facilitating CD8+ T-cell recruitment and
strengthening antitumor immunity [57].
4.3. MOF-based nanomaterials
MOFs are being employed to improve the synergistic effects of PDT
and
immunotherapy.
Notably,
a
metal-organic
frameworks-based
nanoagonist, DZ@A7, is engineered for tumor-specific, NIR light-
enhanced delivery, activating the cGAS-STING pathway with mini-
mized off-target effects. Under NIR irradiation, it generates ROS, re-
leases mitochondrial DNA, and triggers zinc ion overload, enhancing
cGAS activity and boosting DC maturation and T cell infiltration [58].
Additionally, copper (II) metalated MOF nanosheets enhanced with
platinum nanoparticles and folate (Cu-TCPP(Al)-Pt-FA) deliver targeted,
dual-enhanced PDT and mitigate tumor hypoxia. This nanomedicine
exploits copper’s GSH depletion and platinum’s catalase-like activity,
boosting ROS levels for effective PDT and triggering ICD. The approach
not only amplifies oxidative stress and systemic immune response but
also facilitates the transition of M2 to M1 macrophages, enhancing CTL
infiltration and demonstrating significant antitumor effects [59].
4.4. Cell- and bacteria-hitchhiking nanomaterials
Cell- and bacteria-hitchhiking nanomaterials offer a versatile
approach for enhancing combination cancer therapies, enabling precise
targeting and synergistic activation of phototherapy, chemotherapy, and
immunotherapy within the TME. For instance, red blood cell (RBC)-
mimicking nanoparticles (M@AP) enhance tumoral photodynamic-
immunotherapy by combining RBC membrane encapsulation with
aggregation-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) for ROS generation
and Poly(I) as an immune stimulant. Enriched in tumors via the
enhanced permeability and retention effect and in the spleen through
RBC homing, M@AP nanoparticles induce ROS under light irradiation,
releasing tumor antigens and stimulating immune responses [60].
Notably, cancer cell membrane-coated nanoparticles (CCMV/LTNPs)
enhance photoimmunotherapy by integrating PDT with TLR7 agonists
and tumor antigens. These biomimetic nanoparticles specifically kill
tumor cells via ROS generation from PDT, while the immune adjuvant
and cancer cell membrane-derived antigens activate host immune re-
sponses to target residual cells [61]. Additionally, an E. coli Nissle
1917-based biohybrid (EcN@TTVP) loaded with aggregation-induced
emission
photosensitizer
(AIE-PS)
enhances
Cerenkov
radiation-induced PDT and activates anti-tumor immunity. Targeting
tumors with both EcN@TTVP and radiopharmaceutical 18F-FDG trig-
gers ICD and DC maturation, priming CTLs [62]. This synergistic
approach achieves effective tumor remission with minimal toxicity,
presenting a promising method for deep-seated tumor treatment.
4.5. Functional composite nanosystems
Recently, multifunctional composite nanosystems have been devel-
oped to boost cooperative enhancement in PDT and immunotherapy.
ATO/PpIX-SMN nanocubes enhance protoporphyrin IX-mediated PDT in
TNBC by facilitating ICD and downregulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
Combined with anti-PD-L1, these nanocubes promote DC maturation,
increase CTL infiltration, and reduce Tregs, effectively improving
treatment efficacy against primary and distal tumors [63]. Similarly, the
MB@MSP nanocarrier, integrating a D-peptide antagonist and methy-
lene blue within a TME-responsive framework, utilizes MMP-2 and

glutathione sensitivity for controlled drug release. This platform en-
hances tumor penetration, facilitates immune checkpoint blockade
(ICB), and strengthens PDT-induced CTL responses [64]. Notably,
Cu3P/1-MT
nanocomposites
combine
PDT
and
immunotherapy,
enhancing tumor ablation and ICD while modulating the immunosup-
pressive microenvironment. These nanocomposites effectively promote
DC maturation and CD8+ T cell infiltration, and reduce Tregs and M2
macrophages,
significantly
amplifying
antitumor
responses
in
photothermal-immunotherapy contexts [65].
Importantly, various drugs, small molecule compounds, and antigens
are loaded into composite nanosystems to enhance the combined effects
of PDT and immunotherapy. For instance, a self-assembled nano-
medicine, CCXB, combines Ce6 and celecoxib to deliver PDT that
effectively reduces breast cancer cell proliferation and mitigates
immunosuppressive environments. This approach enhances ICD, lowers
PGE2 synthesis, and adjusts T cell populations, significantly amplifying
in vivo antitumor immunity and reducing metastasis [66]. Similarly, a
supramolecular prodrug nanoplatform co-delivers a photosensitizer and
a bromodomain-containing protein 4 inhibitor (BRD4i) JQ1, targeting
pancreatic cancer. The nanoparticles, formed by host-guest complexa-
tion
using
cyclodextrin-grafted
hyaluronic
acid,
enhance
PDT’s
immunogenicity and limit immune evasion by modulating key glycol-
ysis and evasion regulators [67]. Likewise, a chimeric peptide,
PpIX-1MT, forms nanoparticles that deliver a photosensitizer PpIX and
an ICI 1 MT to tumors, utilizing a caspase-responsive linkage for
cascaded drug release. Upon light irradiation, these nanoparticles
generate ROS, inducing apoptosis and tumor antigen production, fol-
lowed by enhanced immune response through the release of 1 MT. This
innovative approach effectively activates CD8+ T cells, significantly
inhibiting primary and metastatic tumors [68]. In addition, the devel-
opment of PheoA-PEI/OVA nanoparticles, which incorporate a photo-
sensitizer and a model antigen, enhances antigen-specific CD8+ T cell
responses
via
photochemical
internalization.
These
nanoparticles
improve endocytosis, ROS generation, and cytosolic antigen release in
DCs upon light stimulation, leading to increased T cell activation and
notable tumor growth inhibition in vivo (Table 1) (Fig. 3) [69].
Nanotherapeutic platforms markedly enhance the synergy of PDT
and immunotherapy by facilitating targeted delivery, modulating im-
mune responses, and amplifying antitumor efficacy. Leveraging a vari-
ety of nanomaterials—from organic and hybrid structures to MOFs and
functional composites—these systems induce ICD, reprogram the TME,
and activate adaptive immunity. This integrative approach represents a

Fig. 3. Multifaceted role of nanomaterials in enhancing PDT and Immunotherapy synergy. Nanomaterials serve as a pivotal component in advancing the
synergistic effects of PDT and immunotherapy. Organic-based nanomaterials such as SPDMCN facilitates the generation of singlet oxygen, pivotal in activating
downstream immune responses, including the modulation of the CTL/Treg ratio favorable for immune activation. Hybrid organic-inorganic nanomaterial C9SN
target glutamine metabolism pathways, escalating ROS production, and further enhancing the immunogenic environment within tumors. MOF-based nanomaterial
Cu-TCPP(Al)-Pt-FA catalyzes the conversion of intratumoral hydrogen peroxide to oxygen, mitigating hypoxia and boosting ROS levels to potentiate immune re-
sponses and PDT efficacy. Functional composite nanosystems, incorporating agents like ATO and PplX, directly impact signaling pathways such as Wnt5a and PLC,
crucial for sustaining cellular immune responses and enhancing the overall antitumor efficacy. Through these diverse mechanisms, nanomaterials optimize both TME
manipulation and immune system engagement, substantially improving the combined therapeutic outcomes of PDT and immunotherapy.

promising advancement for combinatorial cancer therapies, providing a
versatile and potent framework for future treatment strategies.
5. Enhancing the synergistic effect of PTT and immunotherapy
with nanotherapeutic platforms
5.1. Organic-based nanomaterials
Organic-based nanomaterials are used to enhance the synergistic
effect of PTT and immunotherapy due to their biocompatibility, biode-
gradability, and the ease with which they can be functionalized with
various therapeutic agents, allowing for precise tumor targeting, effi-
cient heat generation, and robust immune system activation. For
instance, a novel nanosystem utilizing reduced graphene oxide loaded
with mitoxantrone and SB-431542, and activated by NIR laser, syner-
gizes PTT, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. This approach increases
cytotoxic CD8+ T cell infiltration while reducing Tregs, offering a
promising strategy for metastatic cancer therapy [70]. Additionally,
polydopamine nanoparticles (PDMN-JQ1) provide a novel, multifaceted
approach for TNBC treatment by synergizing targeted therapy, PTT, and
immunotherapy. Loaded with JQ1, PDMNs down-regulate PD-L1 and
inhibit the BRD4-c-MYC axis, enhancing CTL activation and inducing a
durable
immune-memory
effect
[71].
Interestingly,
cuttlefish
ink-derived nanoparticles (CINPs), rich in melanin and biocompatible
components, synergize PTT and immunotherapy. Upon NIR irradiation,
CINPs efficiently convert to heat, promoting tumor cell apoptosis and
antigen
release.
Concurrently,
these
nanoparticles
reprogram
tumor-associated macrophages from an M2-like suppressive to an
M1-like antitumor phenotype, enhancing CTL recruitment and activity
[72].
5.2. Hybrid organic-inorganic nanomaterials
Hybrid organic-inorganic nanomaterials are employed to enhance
the synergistic effect of PTT and immunotherapy due to their ability to
integrate the high thermal conversion efficiency and stability of inor-
ganic components with the biocompatibility and functional adaptability
of organic materials, leading to precise tumor targeting, effective heat
production, and strong immune system activation. A titanium carbide
MXene-based nanoplatform linked with Mn2+-contained ovalbumin
activates both innate and adaptive immunities upon NIR laser irradia-
tion. This activation leads to efficient antigen presentation and DC
maturation, significantly enhancing CTL infiltration and antitumor ef-
ficacy [73]. In addition, a NIR responsive nanoenzyme, PB-Mn/OVA NE,
was developed by doping manganese into Prussian blue nanoparticles
templated with ovalbumin. This nanoenzyme alleviates tumor hypoxia,
enhances photothermal tumor ablation, and triggers ICD. It effectively
activates the cGAS-STING pathway, enhancing DC function and boost-
ing cytotoxic and memory T cell responses, thereby offering a compre-
hensive strategy for photothermal and immunotherapy of tumors [74].
Moreover, a photothermally activatable polymeric pro-nanoagonist
(APNA) uses NIR-II light for precise spatiotemporal control in cancer
immunotherapy. This nanoparticle, constructed from a NIR-II semi-
conducting transducer and an immunostimulant linked by a thermola-
bile
linker,
triggers
localized
tumor
ablation
and
releases
the
immunostimulant upon NIR-II irradiation. The result is enhanced cyto-
toxic and helper T cell infiltration across distant tumors and organs,
effectively inhibiting metastasis [75]. Notably, combining mesoporous
organosilica nanoparticles loaded with Fe3+ and indocyanine green, and
mild PTT efficiently induces oxidative cell death and DC activation in
vitro. In vivo, it promotes T cell infiltration and robust adaptive im-
munity, demonstrating significant potential in TNBC treatment without
notable side effects [76].
5.3. Metal-based nanomaterials
Metal-based nanomaterials are used to enhance the combinative ef-
fects of PTT and immunotherapy because their excellent light absorption
and conversion efficiency allow for the effective generation of localized
heat upon NIR irradiation, leading to precise tumor ablation and mini-
mal damage to surrounding healthy tissues. For example, cerium oxide
end-deposited gold nanorods (CEG) enhance NIR photoimmunotherapy
by generating heat and ROS under NIR light, triggering ICD and boosting
CTL infiltration in TNBC. When combined with PD-1 antibody, CEG
reverses the immunosuppressive environment, amplifying the immune
response and demonstrating effective synergy in TNBC treatment [77].
Similarly,
a
supramolecular
cationic
gold
nanorod
combines
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated PD-L1 disruption with NIR-II light-induced mild
hyperthermia for enhanced ICB therapy. This dual-action nanoplatform
triggers ICD and promotes dendritic-to-T cell conversion, enhancing CTL
infiltration and reprogramming the TME [78]. Additionally, the
Au@Pt-based nanosystem, conjugated with an MMP-activated peptide,
enhances cancer treatment by combining PTT and immunotherapy. This
dual-function nanosystem effectively delivers photothermal heat and a
D-peptide antagonist of PD-L1, promoting robust tumor ablation and
CTL activation [79]. Moreover, AuPtAg-GOx nanomodulators are engi-
neered to enhance immune responsiveness by integrating mild PTT and
glucose oxidase-induced starvation. Upon laser irradiation, these
nanomodulators stimulate T cell activation and modulate the TME,
while their nanozyme activity reduces hypoxia to boost overall treat-
ment efficacy. When combined with PD-L1 antibodies, this multifunc-
tional platform significantly amplifies antitumor effects, demonstrating
a novel method to combat immunologically "cold" tumors through a
synergistic approach [80].
5.4. Cell- and bacteria-hitchhiking nanomaterials
Interestingly, due to their inherent ability to selectively target tu-
mors, deliver therapeutic agents, and uniquely interact with the TME,
bacteria are now being engineered into composite nanosystems to
significantly enhance therapeutic outcomes. An engineered microbial
nanohybrid combining Escherichia coli with Cu2O nanoparticles targets
colon tumors, converting to CuxS under high H2S conditions and
exhibiting effective photothermal activity. This hybrid triggers ferrop-
tosis and cuproptosis, reversing immunosuppression and enhancing DC
and CD8+ T cell responses, particularly when paired with ICI, showing
promise for precise photothermal-enhanced tumor therapy [81]. Simi-
larly, decorating bacteria with triple immune nanoactivators, this
approach
employs
polydopamine
nanoparticles
to
conjugate
tumor-specific antigens and checkpoint blocking antibodies on bacterial
surfaces. Polydopamine facilitates photothermal macrophage repolari-
zation,
antigen-induced
DC
maturation,
and
checkpoint
blockade-enhanced T cell activation, offering a multimodal, durable
cancer immunotherapy platform with potent tumor-specific effects [82].
Alongside bacterial systems, various cell membranes also serve as
valuable carriers for nanomaterials in therapeutic applications. For
instance, a biomimetic nanoparticle coated with a microglia membrane
(BM@MnP-BSA-aPD-1) effectively crosses the blood-brain barrier to
target the immunosuppressive TME in glioblastoma. Leveraging the
membrane’s targeting capabilities, this nanoplatform combines metal-
loimmunotherapy and PTT to activate interferon pathways, induce ICD,
and inhibit PD-1/PD-L1 signaling, thereby revitalizing antitumor im-
munity [83]. Similarly, hybrid cell-membrane-coated nanoparticles
(Fe3O4-ICG@IRM), combining ovarian cancer cell and RBC membranes,
offer precise targeting and prolonged circulation for ovarian cancer
therapy. Using PTT, these biomimetic nanoparticles induce tumor an-
tigen release, activating CD8+ T cells and reducing Foxp3+ Tregs. This
synergistic approach enhances both primary and metastatic antitumor
immune responses, showing promise for effective photothermal-
immunotherapy in ovarian cancer [84].

5.5. Functional composite nanosystems
Functional composite nanosystems enhance the synergistic effect of
PTT and immunotherapy by integrating various therapeutic agents and
functionalities into one platform, enabling precise targeting, controlled
drug release, efficient heat generation, and robust immune activation,
thereby improving treatment efficacy and minimizing side effects. For
instance, multifunctional nanoparticles (GOP@aPD1) encapsulated
with anti-PD1 antibodies, iron oxide, and perfluoropentane in a PLGA-
PEG shell enhance melanoma treatment by synergizing PTT and
immunotherapy. These nanoparticles specifically deliver anti-PD1 to the
tumor site, enabling effective release and increased CD8+ T cell infil-
tration, thereby activating the immune system within the TME [85].
Similarly, a semiconducting polymeric nanoantagonist (ASPA), incor-
porating a NIR photothermally activatable component and an adenosine
A2A receptor antagonist, facilitates precise immunometabolic cancer
therapy. Under NIR-II irradiation, ASPA promotes tumor ablation,
triggers antagonist release to inhibit the immunosuppressive pathway,
and enhances CTL function while reducing regulatory T cell activity
[86]. In addition, a novel nanoimmunotherapy using Prussian blue

nanoparticle-based PTT (PBNP-PTT) and systemic anti-CD137 mono-
clonal antibody enhances melanoma treatment. PBNP-PTT induces ICD
and boosts antigen presentation, achieving tumor-free survival and
reducing secondary tumor growth in vivo [87]. Moreover, an innovative
in situ vaccination strategy utilizes gold nanocage-based photothermal
effects, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, and JQ1 to counteract the immu-
nosuppressive TME. This approach effectively activates DCs, primes T
cells, enhances CTL infiltration, and repolarizes macrophages towards
an anti-tumor phenotype (Table 2) (Fig. 4) [88].
Nanotherapeutic platforms combining PTT and immunotherapy
offer a transformative approach to cancer treatment, achieving precise
tumor ablation, immune activation, and modulation of the TME. These
systems—spanning organic, hybrid, metal-based, and bacterial com-
posite nanosystems—efficiently harness thermal effects to enhance CTL
responses, promote immune memory, and convert immunologically
"cold" tumors into responsive ones. The integration of PTT-specific
mechanisms provides a unique pathway to potent, adaptable cancer
immunotherapy, demonstrating promise for both localized and systemic
tumor control.
6. Enhancing the synergistic effect of thermotherapy and
immunotherapy with nanotherapeutic platforms
In addition to PTT, various nanomaterials have been utilized to
enhance the combined effects of thermotherapy and immunotherapy.
For instance, a novel metal-organic framework nanoamplifier facilitates
microwave-enhanced thermotherapy and immunotherapy by targeting
mitochondria to release nitric oxide and programmatically upregulating
HSP70. This multifaceted approach activates CTLs, enhancing antitumor
immunotherapy with a significant tumor inhibition rate [89]. Addi-
tionally, biodegradable poly (beta-amino ester) nanoparticles encapsu-
lating mRNA for co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines, combined
Fig. 4. Nanomaterial-enhanced PTT as a catalyst for immunotherapy synergy. Nanomaterials critically enhance the synergistic effects of PTT and immuno-
therapy across multiple platforms. Metal-based nanomaterial CEG, combined with PD-1 blockade therapy, amplify the immune response and enhance treatment
efficacy against TNBC through the generation of ROS and induction of ICD. Organic-based nanomaterial PDMN-JQ1, carrying c-Myc targeted therapies like JQ1,
modulate immunological profiles by reducing PD-L1 expression, thereby potentiating immune checkpoint therapy. Hybrid organic-inorganic nanomaterial PB-Mn/
OVA NE enhances anti-tumor effects by reversing hypoxia within the TME and activating the cGAS-STING pathway, leading to enhanced ICD and improved anti-
tumor immunity. Additionally, functional composite nanosystems such as Vipadenant-carried ASPA platform modulate immunosuppressive pathways, increasing
the cytolytic activity of CTLs while Treg interference. Collectively, these nanomaterials enable a multifaceted approach to cancer treatment that integrates PTT with
advanced immunotherapy strategies, significantly increasing the therapeutic potential against various cancer types.

with a thermoresponsive gel, locally reprogram the TME. This strategy
enhances lymphocyte recruitment and activation, synergizing with ICB
to induce significant tumor regression and resistance to rechallenge
[90]. Notably, a novel nanocatalytic modality, MNP-RGD-TPP, har-
nesses magnetic hyperthermia to target tumor-associated bacteria,
inducing oxidative damage via a Fenton reaction. This activity not only
disrupts bacteria, releasing lipopolysaccharides that polarize macro-
phages and mature DCs, but also promotes a robust immune response
against tumors [91]. Moreover, ferrimagnetic vortex-domain iron oxide
nanorings (FVIO) mediate mild magnetic hyperthermia to enhance ICD
in breast cancer cells, marked by increased calreticulin expression and
subsequent phagocytosis by the immune system. This strategy boosts
CTL infiltration and synergizes with PD-L1 checkpoint blockade,
reducing metastasis and suppressing MDSCs [92]. Nanomaterial-based
thermotherapy enhances immunotherapy by inducing immune activa-
tion, modulating the TME, and increasing checkpoint blockade sensi-
tivity. These versatile approaches provide a powerful strategy for
achieving robust, localized, and systemic antitumor effects.
7. Enhancing the synergistic effect of chemotherapy and
immunotherapy with nanotherapeutic platforms
7.1. Organic-based nanomaterials
Organic-based nanomaterials are effective in enhancing the combi-
native effect of chemotherapy and immunotherapy due to their ability to
be precisely engineered for targeted drug delivery, controlled release in
response to the TME, and capacity to modify surface functionalities for
improved biocompatibility and immune system engagement. For
instance, a novel triblock copolymeric micelle (NanoPCPT + PIMDQ)
efficiently delivers chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic agents
directly to tumors, enabling deep penetration and controlled release
responsive to the tumor’s acidic and reductive environment. This
strategy synergistically activates DCs, enhances CTL infiltration, and
mitigates regulatory T cell and M2 macrophage immunosuppression,
promisingly advancing chemoimmunotherapy effectiveness [93]. Simi-
larly,
amphiphilic
block
copolymers,
TfR-T12-PEG-PLGA
and
TATH7-PEG-PLGA,
self-assemble
into
nanocomposite
micelles
to
co-deliver PTX and imiquimod, targeting glioma via TfR-mediated
Blood-Brain Barrier penetration and pH-sensitive mechanisms. These
micelles modulate the TME, notably enhancing M1 polarization of TAMs
and CD8+ T cell activity, contributing to effective glioma treatment
through a synergistic chemotherapy and immunotherapy approach
[94]. In addition, cisplatin-loaded poly (l-glutamic acid)-graft-methoxy
poly (ethylene glycol) nanoparticles (CDDP-NPs) enhance antitumor
CD8+ T cell responses in tumor-bearing mice by maintaining persistent
tumor MHC-I overexpression, facilitating MHC-I-TCR interaction, and
activating TCR signaling. Combined with agonistic OX40 antibody,
CDDP-NPs significantly suppress tumor growth, underscoring their po-
tential
in
synergistic
cancer
immunotherapy
[95].
Moreover,
a
TME-activable prodrug nanoparticle effectively co-delivers a PD-L1
antagonist
and
doxorubicin
(DOX)
for
enhanced
chemo-
immunotherapy in solid tumors. This nanoparticle, featuring PEGylated
DOX and a D-peptide antagonist, promotes deep tumor penetration and
releases therapeutic agents in situ. It simultaneously kills tumor cells,
enhances CTL infiltration and reduces Tregs [96]. Furthermore, a novel
nanovaccine formulation, employing redox-responsive polymer micelles
encapsulating DOX and TLR7/8 agonist R848, triggers ICD and initiates
an immune response. Combined with A2AR antagonist SCH58261, this
approach suppresses the immunosuppressive adenosinergic pathway,
enhances NK and CD8+ T cell activation, and inhibits regulatory T cell
proliferation, thereby generating a robust antitumor immune response
[97]. Significantly, a pH-responsive polyhydralazine nanoparticle
(PHDZ/BTZ) effectively delivers bortezomib (BTZ) into tumors, utilizing
hydralazine-induced vessel dilation to overcome transport barriers
within the TME. Triggered release in acidic conditions enhances BTZ
accumulation and efficacy, significantly reducing tumor growth and
lung metastasis while minimizing side effects. The nanoparticle also
promotes ICD, boosting CTL infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine
secretion [98]. Similarly, the pH-responsive PAG/BTZ nanocarrier,
modified with aminoguanidine, enhances BTZ delivery, promoting ICD
and antigen uptake by DCs. This activation leads to increased DC
maturation and CTL infiltration, significantly boosting antitumor im-
mune responses and synergizing effectively with ICB [99].
In addition to the above polymer-based materials, various types of
organic-based nanocarriers have been developed to deliver chemother-
apeutic agents and enhance immunotherapeutic outcomes. For instance,
sialic acid-functionalized liposomes, coloaded with decitabine and tri-
clabendazole, target tumor sites to enhance pyroptosis and CD8+ T cell
infiltration by upregulating pyroptosis-related proteins and demethy-
lating mRNA [100]. In addition, pH-responsive nanomicelles loaded
with PTX, AMD3100, and a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor enhance the targeting
and therapeutic outcomes in TNBC by modulating the TME. This
configuration significantly reduces tumor growth and metastasis, re-
programs immunosuppressive conditions, and boosts CD8+ T cell infil-
tration, thereby revitalizing ICI effectiveness [101]. Similarly, an
amphiphilic peptide micelle system (Co-LMs) was designed for targeted
co-delivery of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and DOX to breast cancer
tumors, providing pH and redox-sensitive drug release. Demonstrating
enhanced efficacy against TNBC, Co-LMs significantly increased CTL
activation
and
reduced
metastasis
[102].
Moreover,
chemotherapy-induced
tumor
RNA
nanoparticles
enhance
cancer
immunotherapy by promoting DC maturation and boosting T cell re-
sponses. These nanoparticles, formed from RNA extracted from
chemotherapy-treated cancer cells, improve ICB efficacy by increasing
CD8+ T cell to Treg ratios and facilitating T cell infiltration within tu-
mors. Interestingly, a novel carrier-free nanoparticle integrates DOX,
melittin, and anti-TOX siRNA to modulate T-cell activity in cancer
therapy. This multifunctional system enhances ICD and CD8+ T-cell
infiltration while reducing T-cell exhaustion, effectively converting
"cold" tumors into "hot" ones [103].
7.2. Hybrid organic-inorganic nanomaterials
Notably, various types of DOX-loaded organic-inorganic nanomaterials
are utilized to enhance the efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy. Periodic
mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles functionalized with TRAIL and
loaded with DOX enhance antitumor immunity by targeting cancer cells
and activating DCs. This dual-functional approach triggers ICD, boosts T
cell activation, and demonstrates superior efficacy in suppressing tumor
growth in a breast cancer mouse model, offering a promising strategy for
targeted immunotherapy [104]. Similarly, DOX-loaded silica nanocarriers
(DOX@HMSPHs)
with
hyaluronidase
functionalization
enhance
chemo-immunotherapy by improving tumor drug permeability and
inducing ICD. These nanocarriers degrade hyaluronic acid in the tumor
matrix, facilitating controlled DOX release and boosting CTL activity
[105]. In addition, hyaluronic acid-cisplatin/polystyrene-polymetformin
(HA-CDDP/PMet) dual-prodrug nanoparticles enable synchronous de-
livery of cisplatin and metformin, enhancing therapeutic efficacy in lung
cancer through chemo-immunotherapy. These nanoparticles improve
intracellular drug delivery, synergistically inhibit tumor growth, and
enhance survival in lung cancer models by modulating immune responses,
increasing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, reducing Treg cells, and activating
cytokine production(Fig. 5) [106].
7.3. Metal-based nanomaterials
Multiple types of manganese-based nanomaterials have been devel-
oped to enhanced the combinative efficacy of chemotherapy and
immunotherapy. For instance, a manganese-chelated telodendrimer
nanodriver, combined with DOX nanoparticles, enhances the STING
pathway in glioblastoma models, promoting DC maturation and CD8+ T
R. Xu et al.

11 
cell infiltration [107]. In addition, amorphous porous manganese
phosphate nanoparticles (PL/APMP-DOX NPs), coated with phospho-
lipid and loaded with DOX, enhance antitumor immunity by releasing
Mn2+ to activate the cGAS/STING pathway and DOX to induce DNA
damage. These hybrid nanoparticles boost DC maturation, increase CTL
and
NK
cell
recruitment,
and
elevate
type
I
interferon
and
pro-inflammatory cytokine production [108]. Similarly, hydrogenated
mesoporous manganese oxide nanoparticles (mHMnO-Dox), camou-
flaged with cancer cell membranes, effectively deliver DOX and activate
the cGAS-STING pathway. This dual action induces robust DC matura-
tion, enhances CTL and NK cell recruitment, and promotes ICD, signif-
icantly inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis while prolonging
survival in tumor-bearing mice [109]. Moreover, a nanoplatform
(Mn-HSP) incorporating manganese ions and a PTX prodrug, based on
hyaluronic acid, enhances tumor immunotherapy by inducing DNA
damage and pyroptosis for tumor antigen release and activating the
STING pathway. This dual mechanism promotes antigen presentation
and CTL infiltration, establishing a self-perpetuating "circulating
immunotherapy" that effectively suppresses primary breast tumors and
metastases [110].
7.4. Cell- and bacteria-hitchhiking nanomaterials
Cell membranes and bacterial systems, leveraging their inherent
versatility, serve as potent carriers for nanomaterials in therapeutic
applications, thereby enhancing the efficacy and delivery of combined
treatment strategies. For instance, cancer cell membrane-coated nano-
gels (ADCT@CM NGs) co-loaded with Cu (II) and toyocamycin enable
targeted, redox-responsive chemodynamic and chemoimmunotherapy.
These biomimetic nanogels release Cu (II) and Toy in the TME, inducing
oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress that triggers ICD [111].
Additionally,
probiotic
Bifidobacterium

DOX-loaded CaP/SiO₂ nanoparticles (DNPs@Bi) combines chemo-
therapy and immunotherapy for enhanced anti-tumor efficacy. This
bacteria-hitchhiking system achieves pH-responsive DOX release to
induce ICD and promotes TAA presentation through gap junctions,
enhancing DC maturation and T cell infiltration in the TME [112].
7.5. Functional composite nanosystems
Notably, various composite nanosystems have been employed to
enhance the therapeutic outcomes of chemo-immunotherapy. For
instance, LDH-PAA@DOX nanosheets, serving as both deacidification
Fig. 5. Integration of nanomaterials to enhance the synergy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. (A) Periodic mesoporous organosilica nanoparticle(PMO)
encapsulating DOX and hT(PKC) (a bridging molecule to attach TRAIL to the PMO nanomaterial surface) target tumor sites, where hT(PKC) improves the PMO tumor-
targeting ability and promotes DOX release. This induces direct cytotoxic effects and promotes ICD, subsequently activating antigen-presenting cells and stimulating
CD8+ T cell-mediated tumor cell killing. (B) Hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSNs) encapsulating DOX and hyaluronidase are injected into tumors rich in
hyaluronic acid (HA). HAase-mediated degradation of HA facilitates nanoparticle penetration and sustained DOX release, enhancing apoptosis and ICD, followed by
immune responses through DAMPs and calreticulin exposure. (C) Nanocomplexes of cisplatin (CDDP) and metformin (Met) encapsulated in HA-coated nanoparticles
target CD44 receptors on tumor cells. Co-delivery of these drugs disrupts cancer cell metabolism and DNA repair pathways, augmenting chemotherapy efficacy and
promoting favorable immune modulation in the TME. This combination reduces immunosuppressive Tregs and enhances CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses, syner-
gistically improving overall tumor control.

agents and chemodynamic therapy vectors, effectively neutralize the
acidic TME and repolarize TAMs from M2 to M1. This transition en-
hances CD8+ T cell activation and induces significant tumor cell damage
through a Fenton reaction-driven oxidative stress mechanism [113].
Interestingly, twin-like charge-switchable nanoparticles comprising
shMFN1-NPs and DOX-NPs effectively target TAMs and cancer cells,
respectively. These pH-responsive nanoparticles facilitate TAM repo-
larization from M2 to M1 phenotypes and induce ICD, enhancing DC

ICD and reverses CD8+ T cell exhaustion. This synergistic approach
enhances immunotherapy, effectively suppressing tumor growth and
metastasis in breast cancer and melanoma models [116]. Importantly, a
core/shell nanoplatform integrating macrophage membrane-coated
mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with catalase, DOX, and resi-
quimod enhances cancer immunotherapy. It targets tumors via ligand
binding, modulates the immunosuppressive environment by catalyzing
hydrogen peroxide to oxygen, blocks A2AR in Treg cells, and activates
DCs [117]. Moreover, a nanoassembly, PP-(hDOX&siCD47), formed by
DOX-conjugated polyphosphoester and CD47-targeting siRNA, en-
hances cancer immunotherapy by blocking CD47 and triggering ICD.
This dual action promotes macrophage activation and T cell infiltration,
reducing immunosuppressive cells in the TME and significantly inhib-
iting tumor growth [118]. Furthermore, a triple-combination nano-
system
integrates
gemcitabine
prodrug
nanoparticles
with
surface-bound anti-PD-L1 antibodies and encapsulated STING agonists,
enhancing drug delivery and antitumor efficacy. This design transforms
poorly immunogenic tumors into inflamed ones, inducing robust CD8+ T

and

(Table

[119].
Nanomaterial-based platforms amplify chemo-immunotherapy by pre-
cisely targeting tumors, modulating immune responses, and inducing
ICD, offering a robust approach for enhanced cancer treatment and
immune activation.
8. Enhancing the synergistic effect of non-chemotherapeutic
drugs or traditional Chinese medicine and immunotherapy with
nanotherapeutic platforms
In addition to the traditionally used chemotherapeutic drugs
mentioned above, various non-chemotherapeutic drugs and extracts
from traditional Chinese medicine have been loaded into nanomaterials
to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. A bionic nanoparticle
(CP@CM), coated with activated murine vascular endothelial cell
membrane and loaded with the PGE2 inhibitor celecoxib, targets post-
operative melanoma to prevent recurrence. By adhering to inflamma-
tory white blood cells and leveraging their natural tropism, CP@CM
effectively delivers celecoxib to inhibit COX-2, reduce immunosup-
pressive cell recruitment, and increase CD8+ and CD4+ T cell infiltration
at the tumor site, reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment
and enhancing postoperative immunotherapy outcomes [120]. Addi-
tionally, engineered "Gemini nanoimmunoregulators" utilize meso-
porous
polydopamine
nanovectors
to
co-deliver
metformin
and
resiquimod, wrapped in red blood cell membranes with specific pep-
tides, to cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages. These nano-
regulators amplify ICD, reprogram macrophage phenotype from M2 to
M1, degrade PD-L1, and enhance CTL function, significantly reducing
tumor
growth
and
preventing
metastasis
[121].
Similarly,
self-degradable PMI nanogels loaded with imiquimod and metformin
remodel the TME by promoting DC maturation, repolarizing M2 mac-
rophages, and reducing PD-L1 expression. This formulation enhances
CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation, synergizing with anti-PD-1 an-
tibodies to amplify antitumor immune responses [122]. Notably, an
in-situ vaccine utilizing acid-responsive liposome-coated polydopamine
nanoparticles, modified with mannose and loaded with resiquimod,
targets DCs for enhanced antigen presentation. This design leverages
PTT and ICD for effective DC activation, boosting CTL responses and
inhibiting tumor recurrence and metastasis through long-term immune
memory,
offering
a
refined
method
for
cancer
immunotherapy
enhancement [123]. Moreover, hyaluronidase-responsive biomimetic
nanoparticles (mCAuNCs@HA), optimized to 150 nm for superior cir-
culation and tumor targeting, co-deliver pheophorbide A and a
ROS-responsive PTX prodrug, enhancing on-demand drug release and
ROS production. Incorporation of an anti-PD-L1 peptide augments this
platform by mitigating the immunosuppressive tumor environment and
boosting
CTL
activity
[124].
Remarkably,
an
engineered
manganese-based metal-organic framework, encapsulating polyphyllin I
and coated with red blood cell membranes (RBC@Mn-MOF/PPI), en-
hances cGAS/STING-mediated immunity. This system prolongs circu-
lation,
targets

TMEs,
and

immune
cells,
transforming "cold" tumors into "hot" ones, and effectively targeting
primary and metastatic tumors [125]. Nanomaterial-based delivery of
non-chemotherapeutic agents and traditional Chinese medicine extracts
demonstrates a promising strategy for enhancing immunotherapy. By
precisely targeting the TME, reprogramming immune cell functions, and
activating CTLs, these platforms transform immune suppression into
robust antitumor responses, offering an innovative route to advance
cancer immunotherapy.
9. Enhancing the synergistic effect of RT and immunotherapy
with nanotherapeutic platforms
Nanomaterials can significantly enhance the combined efficacy of RT
and immunotherapy by not only modulating the TME to increase
radiosensitivity but also facilitating the release of tumor antigens
through ICD induced by radiation. This process enhances the tumor’s
visibility to the immune system, while the targeted delivery of immu-
nomodulators further amplifies the immune response, leading to a more
potent anti-tumor effect. For instance, AGuIX nanoparticles, acting as
radiosensitizers, augment RT by exacerbating DNA damage in B16
tumor cells, enhancing the ICD and systemic T-cell responses. When
combined with PD-1 blockade, this synergistic approach significantly
increases CD8+ T cell infiltration and mitigates the immunosuppressive
TME [126]. Similarly, biomimetic MnO2 nanoparticles encapsulating
anti-PD-L1
(αPDL1@MnO2)
enhance
RT
by
overcoming
hypoxia-induced resistance and reprogramming the TME. Released
Mn2+ ions activate the cGAS-STING pathway, enhancing DC maturation
and CTL infiltration, thus amplifying systemic antitumor responses and
inhibiting metastases through a pronounced abscopal effect [127].
Additionally, multifunctional core-shell R837/BMS@Au8 nanoparticles,
integrating Au8NCs with an R837/BMS nanocore, enhance RT by
reducing X-ray dose and boosting antitumor immunity. These nano-
particles enhance X-ray absorption, activate effector T cells via antigen
presentation, and inhibit the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, effectively reducing
tumor metastasis [128]. Moreover, Phy@PLGdH nanosheets, combining
physcion
with
layered
gadolinium
hydroxide, enhance
radiation
therapy-induced ICD and boost in situ tumor vaccination. These nano-
sheets increase X-ray deposition and tumor penetration, leading to
amplified oxidative stress and DNA damage. This mechanism primes
CD8+ T-cell-dependent antitumor immunity, enhancing the efficacy of
checkpoint blockade therapies against primary and metastatic tumors
[129]. Interestingly, MGTe, a hybrid nanoplatform combining Te
nanoparticles (GTe) for radiosensitization with fused tumor and bacte-
rial membranes, enhances RT by producing ROS and inducing ICD under
X-ray irradiation. This approach amplifies antitumor immunity through
antigen presenting cells and T cell activation, demonstrating significant
tumor control and potential as a clinical strategy for effective and
reduced-side-effect cancer treatment [130]. Nanomaterial-based plat-
forms significantly enhance the synergy of RT and immunotherapy by
promoting ICD, overcoming hypoxia, and activating systemic immune
responses. These approaches amplify radiosensitivity, prime antitumor
immunity, and support robust T-cell activation, offering a powerful
strategy to extend the therapeutic impact of RT and achieve durable
cancer control.
10. Enhancing the synergistic effect of SDT and immunotherapy
with nanotherapeutic platforms
Nanomaterials enhance the synergistic effect of immunotherapy and
SDT by optimizing the delivery and activation of sonosensitizers within
the TME. This targeted delivery facilitates ICD, releasing tumor antigens
and ROS that prime the immune system. The enhanced immune acti-
vation not only boosts the local immune response but also increases
R. Xu et al.
Materials Today Bio 30 (2025) 101386 
14 
systemic immune surveillance, leading to a more effective immuno-
therapeutic outcome. The PFH-Ce6 liposome@O2 nanodroplets enhance
SDT by generating increased ROS and inducing ICD. When integrated
with PD-1 blockade post-inadequate radiofrequency ablation, this
treatment boosts antitumor immunity, reduces Tregs, and promotes DC
maturation and T cell infiltration, significantly prolonging survival and
initiating long-term immune memory in a preclinical cancer model
[131]. Similarly, a biomimetic nanoplatform, Ru-TePt@siRNA-MVs,
integrates Fenton-like sonosensitization, genetic immunotherapy, and
oxygen-producing capabilities to enhance tumor oxygenation and pro-
voke oxidative stress. This system triggers ICD, activates T cells, and
silences the PD-L1 gene, synergistically augmenting the immune
response against tumors [132]. Additionally, oxygen-carrying perfluo-
rocarbon nanoparticles (M@P-SOP) enhance high-intensity focused ul-
trasound tumor ablation, inducing significant ICD and alleviating
hypoxia in the TME. This biomimetic strategy, combined with
anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, matures DCs and repolarizes macrophages,
boosting systemic antitumor responses and suppressing distant tumor
growth [133]. Moreover, titanium diselenide nanosheets, utilized as
nano-sensitizers under ultrasound, enhance SDT by generating ROS
under both hypoxic and normoxic conditions. This treatment triggers
ICD, promoting DC maturation and T-cell activation. In combination
with anti-PD-1 therapy, it suppresses primary and distant tumor growth
and prevents lung metastasis [134]. Nanomaterial-enhanced SDT syn-
ergizes with immunotherapy by inducing ICD and robust oxidative
stress, priming both local and systemic antitumor immunity. These
platforms effectively modulate the TME, activate DCs, and enhance
T-cell infiltration, offering a potent strategy for achieving sustained
tumor control and preventing metastasis.
11. Enhancing the synergistic effect of multi-modal therapies
and immunotherapy with nanotherapeutic platforms
Enhancing the synergistic effect of multiple therapeutic modalities
and immunotherapy using nanotherapeutic platforms involves inte-
grating at least two conventional treatments—such as chemotherapy,
RT, targeted therapy, PDT, or PTT—with immunotherapy. This
approach leverages the strengths of each method to improve overall
therapeutic efficacy, targeting tumor cells more effectively and stimu-
lating a robust immune response to combat cancer. For instance,
erythrocyte membrane-encapsulated copper indium selenium nano-
materials (RNCIS) harness chemodynamic, photodynamic, and photo-
thermal mechanisms for enhanced T lymphocyte recruitment and
macrophage M1 polarization. These features, combined with NIR-
triggered release of NLG919, potentiate targeted photoimmunotherapy
against primary and metastatic tumors [135]. Similarly, the nanoagent
Cu9S5@mSiO2-PpIX@MnO2@CpG
(CSPM@CpG)
integrates
photo-
therapy and immunotherapy for enhanced cancer treatment. This
strategy leverages the intracellular delivery of CpG to stimulate CTLs,
boost IFN-γ production, and elevate immune response levels. The syn-
ergistic
effect
of
PTT,
PDT,
and
immunotherapy
provided
by
CSPM@CpG not only suppresses tumor growth but effectively inhibits
metastasis, offering a potent approach to mitigate the spread of cancer
[136]. In addition, supramolecular nanomicelles PolyMN-TO-8, con-
structed
from
MTX-MPEG2000,
NPX-2S,
and
TO-8,
initiate
pyroptosis-mediated ICD, enhance DC maturation, and boost CD8+ T
cell infiltration into tumors. Leveraging laser-triggered photodynamic
and photothermal therapies alongside chemotherapy, these nano-
micelles significantly reduce immune escape and tumor metastasis
[137].
The BHMDI nanoplatform, a manganese oxide-crosslinked albumin/
hyaluronic acid construct co-loaded with DOX and indocyanine green,
enhances PDT for HCC. This approach alleviates tumor hypoxia,
downregulates M2 macrophages, and induces ICD, boosting DC matu-
ration and T cell activation. Coupled with PD-1 blockade, it effectively
eliminates primary tumors and prevents recurrence and metastasis by
invigorating systemic antitumor immunity [138]. In addition, an
albumin-based nanoplatform co-delivers IR780, NLG919 dimer, and
tirapazamine, enhancing PDT and chemotherapy under hypoxic condi-
tions. This dual action activates tumor-specific CTLs and reduces
immunosuppression, promoting effective intratumoral CTL infiltration
and nearly eliminating tumor recurrence and metastasis in breast cancer
[139]. Moreover, the iron oxide nanoparticle (FGR) integrates photo-
thermal and chemodynamic therapies with a dextran-conjugated Toll--
like receptor agonist (R848) for targeted cancer immunotherapy. Upon
exposure to the acidic TME, FGR releases R848, enhancing DC matu-
ration and CTL infiltration. This activation, coupled with direct tumor
cell killing via photothermal and chemodynamic effects, effectively
suppresses melanoma growth and metastasis [140]. Notably, integrating
the αOX40 antibody, Ti3C2-MXene-Au nanocomposites deliver a multi-
functional nanoplatform combining PTT and enzyme dynamic therapy,
enhanced by photoacoustic and thermal imaging. These treatments
induce ICD and apoptosis, promoting DC maturation and T-cell infil-
tration, further enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy [141].
Furthermore, the Ag2S QD/DOX/Bestatin@PC10ARGD polypeptide
hydrogel, incorporating a photosensitizer, chemotherapy drug, and
immune-adjuvant, serves as a multifunctional platform for mammary
carcinoma treatment. Triggered by PTT, this hydrogel facilitates sus-
tained drug release, enhances immune cell infiltration, and significantly
inhibits tumor growth and metastasis [142]. Interestingly, LINC, a
light-inducible nanocargo, integrates a photosensitizer and an IDO-1
inhibitor with a light-activatable prodrug of oxaliplatin, enhancing
chemoimmunotherapy by ensuring targeted delivery and controlled
drug release in tumor sites. This dual-light-triggered system enhances
deep tumor penetration and retention, facilitating increased CTL infil-
tration and reducing immunosuppression within the TME [143].
In addition to the above-mentioned phototherapy-involved multi-
modal therapies, targeted therapy and SDT-involved multi-modal ther-
apies also improve immunotherapy outcomes. These integrated ap-
proaches enhance the therapeutic efficacy by leveraging the strengths of
each method, ultimately boosting the immune response against cancer.
For instance, a novel biomimetic nanoparticle system enhances solid
tumor therapy by integrating chemotherapy, targeted therapy and im-
mune synergy. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles, loaded with DOX and
coated with cell membranes featuring GPI-anchored anti-HER2 scFv and
CD80, effectively increase tumor targeting and immune response acti-
vation. This system improves antitumor efficacy by boosting CD8+ T cell
activity, enhancing cytokine production, and reducing suppressive cell
populations in tumor environments [144]. In addition, biocompatible
nanocarriers targeting MDSCs were developed to combat immunosup-
pressive chemoresistance in lung cancer. These carriers deliver l-Nor-
valine and Sunitinib, enhancing apoptosis, reducing tumor volume, and
increasing drug retention. They significantly boost CD8+ and CD4+ T
cell infiltration, activate NK cells, and reduce Treg cells and MDSCs in
the TME. Enhanced tumor ablation under NIR exposure underscores the
potential of this strategy for effective metastatic cancer treatment [145].
Interestingly, AIPH/Cu-Cys@Lipo, a sonodynamic-chemodynamic lipo-
some, effectively depletes glutathione, generating radicals via ultra-
sound and -OH through Fenton-like reactions. This nanoparticle
enhances tumor immunotherapy by disrupting mitochondrial function
and activating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, thereby increasing IL-2 and
TNF-α expression, and significantly inhibiting tumor growth (Table 4)
(Fig. 6) [146]. Multi-modal nanotherapeutic platforms integrating
phototherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and SDT with immu-
notherapy offer a comprehensive strategy to enhance antitumor im-
munity. By harnessing distinct mechanisms—such as ICD, immune
modulation, and precise tumor targeting—these platforms amplify im-
mune responses, reduce tumor escape, and inhibit metastasis. This
approach represents a powerful advancement for durable and highly
effective cancer treatments.

12. Comparative analysis of nanoplatforms
A comparative analysis of nanoplatforms for cancer therapy reveals
that each type offers distinct structural and physicochemical properties,
which contribute to their specific therapeutic outcomes and versatility
in clinical applications. Organic-based nanomaterials, such as poly-
dopamine and graphene oxide, benefit from high biocompatibility and
inherent biodegradability due to their organic molecular structures,
making them ideal for tumor-specific targeting with minimal systemic
toxicity. Their structure allows efficient functionalization, enabling PTT
and immune activation that stimulate CTL responses while suppressing
Tregs to control tumor growth [147,148]. Hybrid organic-inorganic
nanomaterials, by integrating organic components with inorganic ele-
ments, exhibit improved stability and multifunctionality. This structure
supports potent PDT effects while enabling hypoxia reversal in the TME
and facilitating immune cell infiltration, achieving superior tumor
ablation compared to single-modality therapies [149].
Metal-based nanomaterials, including copper sulfide and iron oxide
nanoparticles, offer unique magnetic and optical properties due to their
metallic composition. Their structures are conducive to photothermal
effects and ROS generation, which disrupt hypoxic TME barriers and
enhance drug delivery precision. These properties not only amplify
tumor suppression but also improve specificity in immune activation.
MOF-based nanomaterials leverage their highly porous structures,
allowing high drug loading and controlled release of therapeutic agents.
These structural characteristics enhance PDT efficacy and enable sus-
tained activation of cytotoxic immune responses, leading to better sur-
vival outcomes in preclinical models while minimizing systemic side
effects [150]. Cell- and bacteria-hitchhiking nanomaterials, leveraging
living carriers such as cells or bacteria, enhance the targeted delivery
and retention of therapeutic agents in the TME through active homing
mechanisms. These systems provide a natural biocompatible shield,
improving circulation time and reducing immune clearance while
facilitating precise delivery to tumor sites. Additionally, their ability to
penetrate tumor tissues and modulate the TME amplifies therapeutic
efficacy [151].
Lastly, functional composite nanosystems combine various thera-
peutic agents—including chemotherapeutic, immunomodulatory, and
photothermal components—on a single, multifunctional platform. The
composite nature of these systems allows for precise targeting,
controlled drug release, and simultaneous engagement of multiple
pathways within the TME, maximizing synergistic effects. Their robust
and adaptable structure has demonstrated an exceptional capacity to
reduce tumor volume and activate adaptive immunity in multiple cancer
models, underscoring their significant therapeutic potential. This
structural and physicochemical comparison of nanoplatforms highlights
the specific material advantages each type offers, informing the selec-
tion of nanoplatforms for targeted, effective multimodal cancer
therapies.
13. Challenges in nanoplatform applications for cancer
immunotherapy
The convergence of nanotherapeutic platforms with traditional
cancer therapies, such as PDT, PTT, chemotherapy, RT and SDT,
alongside immunotherapy, represents a promising frontier in oncology.
By exploiting the unique properties of nanoparticles, these combined
approaches aim to enhance the precision and potency of cancer treat-
ment modalities. Nanoparticles can specifically deliver therapeutic
agents to tumor sites, modulate drug release rates, and even actively
target TME, thereby amplifying the therapeutic efficacy and minimizing
systemic toxicity [152]. Additionally, nanoparticles can be engineered
to carry both cytotoxic drugs and immunomodulatory agents, facili-
tating a dual attack on cancer cells while simultaneously priming the
immune system [153]. This synergistic strategy harnesses the strengths
of each therapy, potentially overcoming the limitations of each when
used alone. However, despite these promising advances, significant
challenges remain.

Firstly, current research on nanomaterials predominantly focuses on
their characterization under in vitro conditions, with only a limited
number of studies venturing into in vivo evaluations. However, these in
vivo studies are primarily constrained to small animal models, particu-
larly mice [154–156], which may not accurately replicate human
physiological responses due to differences in scale, immune system
characteristics, and metabolic rates [157]. This limitation significantly
hampers the translation of nanomedical innovations from the laboratory
to the clinic. Future investigations need to extend beyond rodent models
to include larger animal models, such as pigs or non-human primates,
which offer more comparable anatomical and physiological traits with
humans. These models could provide more relevant data on the
Fig. 6. Nanomaterials facilitate synergistic multimodal therapies in cancer treatment. Nanomaterials significantly enhance the synergistic effects of con-
ventional therapies and immunotherapy by integrating multiple therapeutic modalities on a single platform. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are engineered
to deliver DOX while presenting cell membrane proteins and targeted antibodies like GPI-CD80 and HER2 scFv, enhancing targeted therapy and immunogenic
response. These MSNs facilitate targeted drug delivery directly to tumor cells, promoting apoptosis and necrosis. Additionally, copper sulfide nanoparticles (CuS/
NorSun NC) incorporate L-norvaline and sunitinib, affecting tumor metabolism in a tumor xenograft mouse model. This combination modulates the TME, influencing
the proliferation of CD4+ T cells and the activity of MDSCs and Tregs, promoting a more effective immunotherapeutic response. Further, lipid-coated nanoparticles
(AIPH/Cu-Cys@Lipo) use ultrasound and reactive oxygen species generation to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells, enhancing sonodynamic and chemodynamic
therapies. Collectively, these nanoplatforms orchestrate a comprehensive and targeted attack on cancer cells, significantly amplifying the efficacy of combined
therapeutic strategies and leading to improved treatment outcomes.

biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and long-term biocompatibility of
nanomaterials, thereby enhancing the predictability of clinical out-
comes [158,159]. Such comprehensive animal studies are crucial for
advancing nanomedicine, enabling more effective and safe therapeutic
solutions that can be confidently moved into human trials. This expan-
sion in model diversity will also contribute to a better understanding of
the nano-bio interactions at play, essential for optimizing the design and
functionalization of nanomaterials for specific therapeutic applications.
Secondly, scaling up the production of nanotherapeutics from labo-
ratory prototypes to industrial-scale manufacturing presents significant
challenges due to the complex nature of nanomaterial designs and the
precise requirements for ligand modification and drug loading strate-
gies. Standardized protocols for the characterization and production of
these nanomaterials are essential to mitigate variability, which can lead
to significant discrepancies in experimental and clinical outcomes, thus
hindering reproducibility essential for clinical translation [160]. In
response, ongoing efforts in the field are increasingly focused on
developing uniform standards and optimized production methods to
enhance consistency and control across the manufacturing process
[161]. Moreover, it is critical that the scale-up process rigorously ad-
dresses the stability, quality, and safety of nanomaterials, ensuring each
batch produced meets stringent criteria. Enhanced predictive models
and quality assessment frameworks are being integrated into develop-
ment workflows to systematically evaluate the long-term stability and
performance of nanomaterials under various conditions [162,163]. This
level of standardization is crucial not only for maintaining the integrity
of therapeutic effects but also for complying with the regulatory stan-
dards set forth by health authorities such as the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In
addition, there is a growing emphasis on early engagement with regu-
latory agencies to facilitate a smoother approval process. Proactive
collaboration with regulatory bodies helps to clarify specific re-
quirements and align nanotherapeutic development with regulatory
expectations from the outset. This approach ensures that all necessary
data, from manufacturing process details to quality control measures,
are collected in compliance with established standards [164]. By
aligning production practices and regulatory considerations early, the
pathway to clinical trials and market entry is streamlined, ultimately
ensuring that these innovative treatments are delivered to patients both
efficiently and safely.
Thirdly, the design and application of nanoplatforms in medical
therapies are primarily governed by their biodegradability, excretion,
toxicity, and non-toxicity profiles, which are essential for ensuring both
clinical efficacy and minimal environmental impact. Ideally, these
nanoplatforms should be constructed from materials that degrade into
biologically benign byproducts naturally metabolized by the body, thus
preventing long-term accumulation and associated toxicity [165]. The
physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, such as size, shape,
and surface properties, critically influence their biodistribution, deter-
mining their clearance mechanisms—smaller nanoparticles are typically
excreted renally, reducing the risk of bioaccumulation, whereas larger
particles may require surface modifications, such as pegylation, to
enhance solubility and promote excretion through the liver and bile
[166]. Toxicity is a major concern, as nanoparticles can interact with
cellular and subcellular structures, potentially causing oxidative stress,
ion release, and other cytotoxic effects. Rigorous toxicity assessments
through both in vitro and in vivo studies are essential to ensure that
nanoparticles do not induce harmful biological responses such as
inflammation or immune reactions. In terms of non-toxicity, it is crucial
that nanoplatforms are designed to perform their therapeutic roles
effectively without eliciting any adverse biological interactions. This
involves engineering nanoparticles with ’stealth’ capabilities that evade
the immune system, prolonging their circulation time and enhancing
their delivery efficiency [167].
Fourthly, combination immunotherapy based on nanomaterials,
while
more
effective
than
monotherapies,
introduces
a
greater
complexity of effects, including an increased risk of autoimmune re-
actions, toxicity, and adverse events in patients [168–170]. The inter-
play between different therapeutic modalities leveraged in these
approaches involves a myriad of potential targets and pathways, each
contributing uniquely to the therapeutic outcome. Currently, under-
standing of the synergistic effects between these modalities is primarily
superficial, with the underlying mechanisms still largely unexplored.
There is a critical need to delve deeper into these interactions to
determine whether antagonistic effects exist or if there could be unin-
tended side effects on normal tissues. Further, while preliminary results
are promising, rigorous clinical and mechanistic studies are essential to
elucidate the specific contributions of each component in the combi-
nation therapy.
Fifthly, the development of personalized combination therapies is
essential due to the inherent heterogeneity of tumors and specific ge-
netic mutations in individual patients. Leveraging nanoplatforms, these
tailored therapies can deliver targeted treatments more effectively
[171]. Nanoplatforms can be engineered to transport multiple thera-
peutic
agents,
specifically
targeting
tumor
characteristics
and
patient-specific genetic profiles, thereby enhancing precision and effi-
cacy while minimizing side effects. Notably, advanced genomic and
proteomic technologies are pivotal in identifying optimal therapeutic
combinations and treatment sequences that nanoplatforms can facilitate
[172]. Additionally, the ability to monitor treatment responses in real
time and dynamically adjust strategies is crucial for effective personal-
ized therapy. By utilizing nanoplatforms in a patient-centric treatment
approach, it not only promises enhanced disease management but also
supports the broader objectives of precision medicine, aiming to tailor
medical decisions and treatments to individual patient needs.
Lastly, the economic implications of implementing nanoplatform-
based cancer therapies are significant and multifaceted, with potential
long-term impacts on healthcare systems. The development and pro-
duction
of
these
therapies
entail
high
costs
due
to
complex
manufacturing processes, quality control, and regulatory compliance.
These factors can translate to high treatment costs, raising concerns
about affordability and accessibility. For healthcare systems, this cost
structure may necessitate increased budget allocations or adjustments in
resource distribution, potentially impacting the provision of other ser-
vices [173]. However, nanoplatform-based therapies offer benefits in
terms of treatment precision and reduced adverse effects, which could
lower downstream costs associated with managing treatment side ef-
fects, hospital readmissions, and lengthy recovery times. As production
methods advance and standardization improves, the cost efficiency of
these therapies may increase, which could alleviate some economic
pressures [174]. Overall, a detailed economic assessment is essential to
evaluate the cost-benefit balance and inform policy decisions on inte-
grating
nanoplatform-based
therapies
within
healthcare
systems,
ensuring sustainable and effective implementation.
14. Ongoing and future developments in nanotherapeutics
The field of nanotherapeutics is experiencing rapid advancements,
driven by cutting-edge research and technological innovations. A sig-
nificant area of development is in the engineering of stimuli-responsive
nanoparticles, designed to react to specific environmental cues within
the TME, such as pH fluctuations or the presence of specific enzymes.
These advanced materials are tailored to optimize the targeted delivery
and controlled release of therapeutic agents, enhancing treatment pre-
cision while mitigating collateral damage to healthy tissues [152,175,
176]. Concurrently, the integration of computational tools, notably
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), is transforming
nanomedicine [177]. These technologies are instrumental in refining the
design and functionality of nanoparticles, allowing for the simulation
and prediction of nanoparticle behavior in complex biological systems
[178,179]. By leveraging vast datasets to forecast interactions at the
molecular level, AI and ML are facilitating the creation of nanoparticles
R. Xu et al.
Materials Today Bio 30 (2025) 101386 
18 
customized to the genetic and molecular profiles of individual patients.
This approach not only enhances therapeutic efficacy but also ushers in a
new paradigm of personalized medicine, where treatments are specif-
ically tailored to the unique characteristics of each patient’s disease.
Moreover, the development of theranostic nanosystems represents a
convergence of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities into a single
platform [180]. These multifunctional systems are designed to detect
cancer at its earliest stages, monitor the dynamic responses of tumors to
treatments in real-time, and deliver therapeutic agents precisely where
needed. By combining imaging and therapeutic capabilities, thera-
nostics provide a powerful tool for oncologists to optimize treatment
strategies, adjust dosages, and predict therapeutic outcomes with
greater accuracy [181,182]. As these technological and scientific ad-
vancements progress, the need for robust interdisciplinary collaboration
becomes increasingly evident. The translation of nanotherapeutics from
the laboratory to the clinic necessitates close cooperation among sci-
entists, clinicians, and regulatory agencies. Establishing comprehensive
regulatory frameworks and standards for the approval and clinical use of
nanotherapeutics is critical [183]. These frameworks must address the
unique challenges posed by nano-scale materials, ensuring that they
meet safety and efficacy criteria without stifling innovation.
15. Conclusions
The integration of immunotherapy with various treatment modal-
ities, facilitated by nanoplatforms, represents a significant advancement
in cancer treatment. Combining immunotherapy with traditional cancer
therapies, and targeted nanomaterial applications enhances efficacy and
addresses the limitations of single-modality treatments. Continued
refinement of nanoplatform specificity and delivery mechanisms is
essential to minimize off-target effects and toxicity. Future research
should focus on patient-specific therapeutic combinations to optimize
treatment outcomes. Comprehensive clinical trials are necessary to
validate the safety and effectiveness observed in preclinical models and
to investigate long-term outcomes and immunological effects. These
efforts are critical for realizing the full potential of nanotechnology in
revolutionizing cancer therapy.
