Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in maintaining immune homeostasis and,
within tumors, their upregulation is common and promotes an immunosuppressive micro-
environment. Therapeutic strategies that can eliminate Tregs in the tumor (i.e., therapies that
do not run the risk of affecting normal tissues), are urgently needed for the development of
cancer immunotherapies. Here we report our discovery of B-cell lymphoma extra-large
(BCL-XL) as a potential molecular target of tumor-inﬁltrating (TI) Tregs. We show that
pharmacological degradation of BCL-XL using a newly developed platelet-sparing BCL-XL
Proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) induces the apoptosis of TI-Tregs and the activation
of TI-CD8+ T cells. Moreover, these activities result in an effective suppression of syngeneic
tumor growth in immunocompetent, but not in immunodeﬁcient or CD8+ T cell-depleted
mice. Notably, treatment with BCL-XL PROTAC does not cause detectable damage within
several normal tissues or thrombocytopenia. These ﬁndings identify BCL-XL as a target in the
elimination of TI-Tregs as a component of cancer immunotherapies, and that the BCL-XL-
speciﬁc PROTAC has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic for cancer
immunotherapy.

A
growing body of evidence demonstrates that regulatory
T cells (Tregs) play an important role in cancer pro-
gression and that they do so by suppressing cancer-
directed immune responses1. Tregs have been targeted for
destruction by exploiting antibodies against and small-molecule
inhibitors of several molecules that are highly expressed in Tregs
—including immune checkpoint molecules, chemokine receptors,
and metabolites2,3. To date, these strategies have had only limited
antitumor efﬁcacy; yet they have also created signiﬁcant risk of
autoimmunity because most of them do not differentiate Tregs in
tumors from those in normal tissues.
We have explored Treg targeting from a different angle,
determining how tumor-inﬁltrating (TI) Tregs survive the
adverse tumor-immunosuppressive microenvironment, which is
characterized by a stress condition resulting from the low supply
of oxygen and nutrients and a high concentration of metabolic
waste4–6. The pro-apoptotic nature of such environments can be
countered by anti-apoptotic proteins of the BCL-2 family, such as
BCL-2, B-cell lymphoma extra-large (BCL-XL), or MCL-1. These
proteins have been extensively targeted with small-molecule
inhibitors in cancer therapies7,8, including BCL-2- and BCL-XL-
dual inhibitor ABT263 (navitoclax)9, BCL-2 inhibitor ABT199
(venetoclax)10, BCL-XL inhibitor A-1331852 (ref. 11), and MCL-1
inhibitor S63845 (ref. 12). ABT199, the BCL-2 speciﬁc inhibitor,
has been approved by the FDA for cancer therapy13. The inhi-
bition of BCL-XL with an inhibitor, however, induces severe
thrombocytopenia, an on-target and dose-limiting toxicity, which
limits the use of ABT263 and other BCL-XL inhibitors as safe and
effective anticancer drugs in clinic14,15.
To avoid the on-target toxicity of BCL-XL inhibitors to platelets,
we have recently reported the development of the ﬁrst-in-class
BCL-XL degrader—a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC)
referred to as DT2216—targets BCL-XL to the von Hippel-Lindau
(VHL) E3 ligase for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal
degradation16. Because platelets express a low level of VHL E3
ligase, DT2216 has minimal effect on platelets but exhibits an
improved cytotoxicity against various cancer cells that are
dependent on BCL-XL for survival16,17. We also developed
another similar PROTAC PZ15227 that uses cereblon (CRBN) E3
ligase to induce BCL-XL polyubiquitination and degradation18.
Here we show that BCL-XL is highly expressed within the TI-
Treg population from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and several
other human cancers. Using the two PROTACs (DT2166
and PZ15227) to degrade BCL-XL, we are able to deﬁne the
critical pro-survival function of BCL-XL within TI-Tregs, which
represents a potential method to deplete TI-Tregs for cancer
immunotherapy.
Results
Proﬁling of BCL-2 family proteins in immune cells. We
recently developed a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq)
dataset including a total of 12,239 TI immune cells and 13,433
peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells (paired PB immune cells
from the same patients) from three human clear cell renal cell
carcinomas (ccRCCs). A total of 22 clusters of immune cells were
annotated for different immune cell types based on the t-dis-
tributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) machine-learning
algorithm (Supplementary Fig. 1a) with deﬁned T cell subtypes
based on various markers (Supplementary Fig. 1b). In TI-Tregs
within ccRCCs, the expression of BCL2L1 (the gene encoding
BCL-XL) was higher than that in PB-Tregs and other T cells
(CD4+ conventional T cells (Tconv) and CD8+ T cells) (Fig. 1a
and Supplementary Fig. 1c, shown as Napierian log fold-change
versus percent difference compared to PB-counterparts). The
expression of BCL2L1 was also high in TI-Tregs in human
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC scRNAseq dataset GSE98638)19
(Supplementary Fig. 1d, shown as Napierian log fold-change
versus percent difference compared to PB-counterparts), as well
as in mouse MC38 colon adenocarcinoma (Fig. 1b and Supple-
mentary Table 1, here the comparison is to spleen Tregs shown as
log2 (n + 1)-transformed data). Other BCL2 family genes such as
PMAIP1 (NOXA) and BAX were also higher in TI-Tregs than
other PB-Tregs cells from human ccRCC (Supplementary
Fig. 1c); MCL1 was slightly higher in TI-Tregs than PB-Tregs in
HCC (Supplementary Fig. 1d). The expression of genes such as
BCL2 did not differ signiﬁcantly between TI-Tregs and other TI-
T cells (Fig. 1a).
An analysis of published RNAseq datasets from previous
reports20,21 revealed that BCL2L1 levels were elevated in TI-Tregs
across many cancer types and species in comparison to Tregs
from normal tissues and other TI-T cell types (Supplementary
Fig. 1e). The cancer tissues included human breast (BrCa) and
colorectal (CRC) cancers, as well as mouse CRC cancers (CT26
and MC38) and melanomas (B16 and BP) (Supplementary
Fig. 1e). Tregs from normal tissues (colon, pancreas, muscle, fat)
expressed lower levels of BCL2L1 than counterparts from spleen
(Supplementary Fig. 1e). Using the reverse graph embedding
approach in the Monocle 2 algorithm22, we constructed a cell
trajectory
of
the
TI-Tregs
and
PB-Tregs
in
the
ccRCC
(Supplementary Fig. 1f). The trajectory from PB to TI Tregs
contained two distinct branches (Supplementary Fig. 1f) that were
not detectable using marker genes nor revealed in our previous
tSNE clustering analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1a). BCL2L1—but
not BCL2—was signiﬁcantly upregulated within the branch 1
(Cell Fate #1) TI-Tregs relative to Cell Fate #2 TI-Tregs or PB-
Tregs (Supplementary Fig. 1g); whereas both branches expressed
Treg markers FOXP3 and IL2RA (CD25) (Supplementary Fig. 1h).
Other immune-suppressive molecules that are known to mediate
Treg
function,
such
as
ENTPD1
(gene
encoding
CD39)
(Supplementary Fig. 1g), are also elevated along the Cell Fate
#1; however, another gene that is also critical to convert ATP to
AMP, i.e. NT5E (gene encoding CD73), is not detectable in TI-
Tregs (Supplementary Fig. 1g). Using ﬂow cytometry of human
cancer specimens (Supplementary Fig. 2a), we examined the
heterogeneity of human TI-Tregs using effector/memory markers
CD45RA and CCR7. Although PB-Tregs exhibited subpopula-
tions of naïve (CD45RA+CCR7+), effector (EMRA, CD45RA+
CCR7−), central memory (CM, CD45RA−CCR7+), and effector
memory (EM, CD45RA−CCR7−), TI-Tregs only consisted of the
EM population (Supplementary Fig. 2b), which is consistent with
the observation from Sakaguchi laboratory who initially devel-
oped the use of CD45RA for human Treg heterogeneity23.
Using ﬂow cytometry, we found that the levels of BCL-XL
protein—determined by intracellular staining of BCL-XL—were
much higher in TI-Tregs versus PB-Tregs in both human BrCa
(Fig. 1c, d) and ccRCC (Fig. 1e, f). BCL-XL levels were higher in
TI-Tregs than those within PB or TI CD8+ and Tconv cells in
human BrCa (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3a) and ccRCC
(Fig. 1e, f and Supplementary Fig. 3b). BCL-XL levels were also
higher, though to a lesser extent, in conventional TI-CD4+ Tconv
versus their PB-counterparts (Fig. 1d, f); whereas TI-CD8+ T cells
exhibited increased BCL-XL in BrCa (Fig. 1d) but decreased level
in ccRCC relative to PB CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1f). A similar result
was observed in mouse Py8119 BrCa tumors (Supplementary
Fig. 3c). BCL-XL levels were also signiﬁcantly higher in TI-Tregs
with all human cancer specimens combined, including the nine
BrCa and paired PBs, two ccRCC and paired PBs, and two colon
cancer and paired PBs (Supplementary Fig. 3d). BCL-XL levels
were similar in PB-CD8+, PB-Tconv, and PB-Treg from same
BrCa patients (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3d). As the major
anti-cancer immune cell types, PB- and TI-CD8 T cells exhibited

different populations of effector/memory phenotypes (Supplemen-
tary Figs. 2b and 3e, f), all of which exhibited lower expression of
BCL-XL relative to TI-Tregs (Supplementary Fig. 3g, h). The
selective upregulation of BCL-XL in TI-Tregs, as well as high levels
of the pro-apoptotic BH3−only proteins NOXA (encoded by
PMAIP1), BID and BAX (Fig. 1a), which inhibit MCL-1 and BCL-
2 respectively, suggest that TI-Tregs may primarily depend on
BCL-XL for survival24.
Targeting BCL-XL for degradation in TI-Tregs. To test whether
BCL-XL is required for the survival of TI-Tregs, we used our
newly generated PROTACs to target BCL-XL. DT2216, the lead
BCL-XL PROTAC, targets BCL-XL to the VHL E3 ligase for
polyubiquitination and degradation16. DT2216 did not cause the
platelet toxicity observed when other BCL-XL inhibitors were
used to inhibit BCL-XL25, because of the poor expression of VHL
in platelets. To assess the effectiveness of PROTAC-mediated
BCL-XL degradation, we developed an ex vivo cancer slice culture
system (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Treatment with DT2216 led to a
signiﬁcant decrease in BCL-XL levels within TI-Tregs from
human BrCa (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Fig. 4b, c) and RCC
(Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Fig. 4d). Whereas the treatment
also reduced BCL-XL levels in TI-Tconv (CD4+ FOXP3−T cells)
and TI-CD8+ T cells, this effect was more modest (Fig. 2b, d and
Supplementary Fig. 4b–d). Similar results were observed in cul-
tures of MC38 colon adenocarcinoma slices (Fig. 2e, f).
To
study
the
role
of
BCL-XL
in
the
tumor
immune
microenvironment, we chose several cell lines with which to
produce syngeneic tumor models (MC38 for colon adenocarci-
noma, 4T1 and Py8119 for breast cancer, and Renca for renal
cancer). These cell lines express various levels of VHL, CRBN,
BCL-XL, BCL-2, and MCL-1 (Supplementary Figs. 4e and 12).
The DT2216 (ref. 16) and PZ15227 (a second BCL-XL PROTAC
that targets BCL-XL to the CRBN E3 ligase for polyubiquitination
and degradation)18 treatments each resulted in dose-dependent
reduction of BCL-XL levels (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Figs. 4f,
13, and 14). Treatment of mice bearing tumors originated from
MC38 and Renca cells with DT2216 resulted in reduced BCL-XL
levels in the tumors, regardless of whether the mice were wild-
type (WT) (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 13) or immunodeﬁ-
cient (NOD-SCID and null for IL-2 receptor gamma (NSG))
(Supplementary Figs. 4g and 14).
Degradation of BCL-XL within TI-Tregs induces anti-tumor
immunity. As we have seen efﬁcient degradation of BCL-XL by its
PROTACs, we ﬁrst checked whether the mouse cell lines are
sensitive to BCL-XL PROTACs. We found that in vitro treatment
of MC38, Renca, Py8119, or 4T1 cells with DT2216 or PZ15227
had little effect on cell survival (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). This is
because these cell lines also express the anti-apoptotic proteins
BCL-2 and MCL-1 (Supplementary Fig. 4e), and thus are not
solely dependent on BCL-XL for survival, as conﬁrmed by a BH3-
pairing assay using inhibitors speciﬁc for BCL-2, BCL-XL, and
MCL-1 (Supplementary Fig. 5c–f). BCL-XL deﬁciency, caused by
either treatment with DT2216 or genetic knockout (KO), inﬂu-
enced neither apoptosis nor colony-forming efﬁciency of cancer
cells in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 5g–i).
Although BCL-XL PROTACs did not kill the above cancer cells
in vitro, DT2216 treatment resulted in signiﬁcantly reduced
tumor growth of the tested models—including Renca (Fig. 3a),
MC38
(Fig.
3b),
and

(Fig.
3c)
tumors
in
WT
immunocompetent mice. A similar result was observed in the
Renca model after treatment with PZ15227 (ref. 18) (Fig. 3a).
Notably, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO of BCL-XL in Renca cells
resulted
in
a
much
smaller
reduction

growth
(Supplementary Figs. 6a and 15). Also, DT2216 lost its tumor-

killer cells (Fig. 3d, e). Collectively, our results suggest that
DT2216 exerts its antitumor activity via a mechanism that is
dependent on immune cells. We found that depletion of CD8+
T cells abrogated the DT2216-mediated tumor inhibitory effect
(Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 6b), supporting the notion that
DT2216-mediated inhibition of tumor growth in syngeneic
models is via CD8+ T cells.
Degradation of BCL-XL leads to the reduction of TI-Tregs and
activation of CD8+ T cells. To determine the extent to which
BCL-XL depletion affects the immunosuppressive environment of
tumors, we proﬁled lymphocytes of MC38 tumor-bearing mice in
Fig. 3b by ﬂow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. 7a). The percen-
tages of lymphocytes in the spleen, draining lymph node (DLN),
and tumors were assessed in mice that had been treated once
weekly for 3 weeks with DT2216 after tumors were palpable.
DT2216 treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the frequency of TI-
Tregs in both the DLN and tumors; it did so to a lesser extent in
the spleen (Fig. 4a). To determine whether this DT2216-mediated
Treg depletion was due to increased apoptosis, we injected MC38
tumor-bearing mice with a ﬂuorescent probe that detects active
caspases. A signiﬁcant increase in median ﬂuorescence intensity
(MFI) was observed in TI-Tregs upon DT2216 treatment (Fig. 4b
and Supplementary Fig. 7b, c), indicative of active caspases.
DT2216 treatment did not signiﬁcantly affect the frequency of TI,
PB, and splenic Tconv cells (Fig. 4c) or that of TI-Tconv and TI-
CD11B+ myeloid cells in which caspases were active (Fig. 4d and
Supplementary Fig. 7b, d, e). Splenic cells, including Treg, Tconv,
CD8+ T, and CD11B+ myeloid cells, however, exhibited minimal
caspase activation with or without DT2216 treatment (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7f). CD39+ TI-Tregs—shown to have suppressive
capacity when undergoing apoptosis26—exhibited similar levels
of cell death after DT2216 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 7g).
Although DT2216 had a small effect on the frequency on total
CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4e), a signiﬁcant increase in the activation of
these cells was indicated by the presence of granzyme B (Gzmb)+
and perforin+ CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4f, g and Supplementary Fig. 7h)
without signiﬁcant change of Ki-67+ proliferative cells (Fig. 4g).
Similar increase of Gzmb+ CD8+ T cells was also seen in blood and
DLN from tumor-bearing mice, but not spleen and other non-
draining lymph nodes (NDLN) after DT2216 treatment (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7i). This ﬁnding supports the notion that treatment
with DT2216 leads to an immune active tumor microenvironment
due to the elimination of TI-Tregs, resulting in tumor-speciﬁc CD8
T cell activation as seen from tumor, blood, and DLNs.
TI-Treg depletion by DT2216 was conﬁrmed in ex vivo cancer
slice cultures generated from mouse Py8119 BrCa (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 7j) or mouse Renca renal tumors (Supplementary
Fig. 7k), as well as human BrCa (Fig. 4h) and CRC (Fig. 4i).
Moreover, this immune-related tumor-inhibitory phenotype is
speciﬁc to BCL-XL degradation, given that inhibition of BCL-2
with BCL-2-speciﬁc inhibitor ABT-199 (ref. 10), which did not
cause an increase in the activation of TI-CD8+ T cells
(Supplementary Fig. 7l), did not inhibit the growth of MC38 or
Renca tumors, even with daily administration of much higher
doses than DT2216 (Supplementary Fig. 7m, n). The impact of
DT2216 was minimal to the majority of myeloid cell populations
in tumor-bearing mice, including granulocytic or monocytic
MDSC (CD11b+Ly6G+ G-MDSC or CD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G−M-

MDSC), macrophages (F4/80+), dendritic cells (CD11c+MHCII+
DC), or CD8+ DCs, with the exception of DC where DT02216
treatment led to slightly decreased TI-DC population (Supple-
mentary Fig. 8a–d).
Treatment with DT2216 had no global effect on the overall
levels of Treg, CD4+ Tconv, CD8+ T, NK cells, and B cells from
various tissues within non-tumor bearing mice (Supplementary
Fig. 9a–e), nor did we see signiﬁcant difference in CD8 T cell
memory
and
effector
sub-populations
from
these
tissues
(Supplementary Fig. 9f–i), deﬁned by CD45RA and CCR7
(Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). There was a slight increase of thymic
Tregs (Supplementary Fig. 9a). These ﬁndings suggest that
DT2216 may selectively deplete TI-Treg in an individual
tumor/mouse-dependent manner.
Serum IgM and IgG levels were not altered by DT2216
treatment either from normal or tumor-bearing mice after an
extended treatment of 5 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 9j, k), as
compared with the elevated levels from pristane-treated mice
(Supplementary Fig. 9j, k). PB-Tregs, -Tconv, or -CD8+ T cells
from non-tumor-bearing mice (Supplementary Fig. 9l, top), or
total Tregs from the blood, lymph nodes, or spleens of non-
tumor-bearing mice (Supplementary Fig. 9l, bottom) remained
unaltered by DT2216. Histological analysis did not reveal tissue
damage in the lung, pancreas, or intestines of Renca-tumor-
bearing mice treated with either DT2216 or PZ15227 (Supple-
mentary Fig. 9m), indicating that Treg depletion and CD8+ T cell
activation are relatively speciﬁc to the tumor microenvironment
rather than being systemic and that targeting BCL-XL by
PROTACs is a relatively safe and effective way to treat cancer.
However, further studies are needed to examine whether DT2216
treatment causes any other autoimmune pathology in the organs
such as liver, skin, and other organs as seen in Foxp3−mice27 to
ensure the safety of DT2216 before it can be translated into the
clinic.
Discussion
Our results reveal that targeting BCL-XL has the potential to
improve cancer immunotherapy. This can be achieved pharma-
cologically by applying PROTACs that target BCL-XL for ubi-
quitination (and thereby for proteasome-mediated degradation)
within the tumor microenvironment, but these PROTACs cannot
eliminate platelets because the expression of VHL or CRBN in
platelets is minimal16,18. Degradation of BCL-XL by PROTACs
reduces the frequency of TI-Tregs by inducing apoptosis,
resulting in the activation of TI-CD8+ T cells. This leads to the
inhibition of tumor growth without signiﬁcant induction of
serum immunoglobulins and/or detectable tissue damage from
lung, intestine, and pancreas. Interestingly, a recent report from
Dr. Zou group found that the apoptotic Tregs were able to induce
a strong immune suppression via the CD39/CD73-mediated
conversion of ATP to immunosuppressive metabolite adenosine
in human ovarian cancers26. In the current study, we determined
the kinetics of DT2216-induced caspase activation within TI-
Tregs and found that caspase activation was detectable at 24 h
after DT2216 treatment of MC38 tumor-bearing mice, but
completely disappeared after 48 h of treatment (Supplementary
Fig. 10a, b), supporting the rapid clearance of these apoptotic TI-
Tregs within tumor microenvironment. Apoptotic clearance by
monocytes/macrophages is believed to be an event starting from
earlier stages of apoptotic induction28,29. Ly6C+ monocytes or
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are much more abundant
populations in most cancer models and human cancers than TI-
Tregs. The battle between the clearance of apoptotic Tregs and
the maintenance of Treg-suppressive functions—in our case—
clearly favors the clearance of apoptotic TI-Tregs.
As shown in the immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies, it is
likely that BCL-XL PROTAC-based immunotherapy will be
effective in a subset of cancer patients. It will be important to
identify the relevant populations, as well as cancer types that are
susceptible to this treatment, before clinical trials with BCL-XL
PROTACs are considered. Cancer types that are likely to be most
susceptible to treatment with DT2216 include: (1) those in which
TI-Tregs are critical for immune regulation and cancer progres-
sion; and (2) those that rely on BCL-XL for survival and in which
high BCL-XL levels and poor outcome are positively correlated.
Cancer types that rely on TI-Tregs for their progression include
several common ones, for example cervical, renal, ovarian, mel-
anoma, pancreatic, gastric, and breast cancers. In these cancer
types, DT2216 may be able to eliminate TI-Tregs and thereby
boost immunity against cancers30. To identify cancer types that
rely on BCL-XL for survival, we used our recently developed
cloud-based application31 to perform a bioinformatics-based
search of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) protein dataset. We
found that BCL-XL levels correlated signiﬁcantly with hazard
ratios (HR) within renal, melanoma, breast, and cervical cancers,
as well as sarcomas and low-grade gliomas. These are cancers for
which DT2216 treatment might lead to direct killing of cancer
cells and/or sensitization to anti-tumor immunity (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 11). The expression of VHL and CRBN suggests that the
choice of E3 ligase will also be critical in selecting BCL-XL
PROTACs. For example, VHL is frequently lost in certain cancer
types, such as RCC; in such cases, a different E3 ligase such as
CRBN would be more appropriate. This study provides the
rationale and a proof-of-principle to eliminate Tregs within
tumors by targeting and degrading an intracellular pro-survival
factor BCL-XL. BCL-XL PROTACs may provide additional choice
for cancer immunotherapies particularly within cancer patient
populations that cannot be treated by the current cancer immu-
notherapies due to low efﬁcacy or immune toxicity.
Methods
Human tissue collection, isolation of mononuclear cells, and sorting for
scRNA-seq. Paired blood and primary ccRCC along with matched normal kidney
parenchyma samples were obtained from the University of Iowa Tissue Procure-
ment Core and GUMER repository through the Holden Comprehensive Cancer
Center from de-identiﬁed three subjects (with an age range of 67–74 years old)
previously provided written consent approved by the University of Iowa Institu-
tional Review Board (IRB) under the IRB number 201304826 and conducted under
the Declaration of Helsinki Principles. Tumor grades were histologically deter-
mined by a pathologist. Primary tumor stages for Patient 1 and Patient 2 were
reported as pT1b without extension, while Patient 3 was reported as pT3a with
renal vein invasion. Other human tissues were collected under IRB protocol:
201901677 that was approved by the University of Florida Institutional Review
Board as non-human subject protocol, including all tissues for ex vivo culture of
tumor slice sections. Tumor samples were dissociated into single cells via enzy-
matic and mechanical dissociation using the Human Tumor Dissociation Kit
(Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). CD45+ cells were isolated from single-cell sus-
pensions using the SepMate FITC Positive Selection Kit (StemCell Technologies,
Vancouver, Canada). Mononuclear cells were isolated from PB samples by density
gradient using SepMate Tubes (StemCell Technologies) and Lymphoprep density
gradient media (StemCell Technologies). CD45+ immune cells were further sorted
on a FACS ARIA sorter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for lymphoid and myeloid
cells and remixed at a 3:1 ratio. Cell viability was assessed by MoxiGoII counter
(Orﬂo Technologies, Ketchum, ID) and resuspended at 1000 cells/µl with >90%
viability.
RNA-seq 10X Genomics library preparation, sequencing, and alignment.
Single-cell library preparation was carried out as per the 10X Genomics Chromium
5ʹ library and Gel Bead Kit Version 2 (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA). Following
cDNA ampliﬁcation, quality control and quantiﬁcation were performed on the
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the DNA high Sensitivity Chip (Agilent Technol-
ogies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled Libraries were run on separate lanes of a ﬂow cell
using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 in the University of Iowa Genomics Division.
Basecalls were converted to FASTQ ﬁles using the Illumina bcl2fastq software and
aligned to human genome (GRCh38) using the CellRanger v2.2 pipeline as
described previously32. Cells were quality checked for total expression of mito-
chondrial reads. Cells with <200 or >5000 unique genes were ﬁltered out.

Single-cell RNA normalization and analysis. The single-cell RNAseq data were
normalized by scaling the unique molecular identiﬁer (UMI) counts per cell to
10,000 and the data were Napierian log(n + 0.1) transformed. Clustering was
performed using the Seurat R package (V2.3.4) and the data were normalized
across the three patients to correct for patient variability using the canonical
correlation process33. Dimensional reduction using the top 20 calculated dimen-
sions and resolution of 1.2 was done to generate the tSNE plot. The predicted cell
type for each cluster was determined by examining the expression levels of a set of
canonical markers for each cell type and by correlating the cluster mean expression
to immune cell signatures from human primary cell atlas dataset using the SingleR
R package V0.2.0 (ref. 34). A fold change in the expression of BCL-2 family genes
between TI T cells and PB-T cells was determined by comparing the average
Napierian log(n + 0.1)-transformed counts for BCL2 family member genes for each
of the four clusters of TI cells identiﬁed as CD8+ T cells to the single-cluster PB
cells identiﬁed as CD8+ T cells, the average Napierian log(n + 0.1)-transformed
counts of the single cluster of TI cells identiﬁed as CD4+ T cells to each of the three
clusters of PB cells identiﬁed as CD4 T cells, and TI cells to the PB cells in the
cluster identiﬁed as Tregs. The fold change values were used to generate a heat map
using GraphPad Prism Software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). scRNAseq
data for human HCC data from GSE98638 (ref. 19) underwent the same processing
and quality control procedures. The average Napierian log(n + 0.1) expression of
BCL2 family genes in all TI CD8+, TI CD4+, and TI Tregs were compared to their
PB counterparts and a heatmap of the Napierian log-fold change for each gene was
made using GraphPad Prism Software. Violin plots of the expression of genes in TI
and PB Tregs were generated using monocle 2R Package.
Bulk RNA sequencing and analysis. Mouse MC38 tumors were enzymatically
and mechanically dissociated to form single-cell suspensions using the Mouse
Tumor Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) and mononuclear cells were isolated by
density gradient using SepMate Tubes and Lymphoprep (StemCell Technologies).
Single-cell suspension of splenic cells was obtained by pressing spleens from the
same tumor bearing mice through a 40-µm nylon strainer and lysing red blood
cells using ACK lysis buffer (150 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, 0.1 mM EDTA).
Cells were then stained with mouse anti CD45-FITC (clone 30F.11; Biolegend),
CD3-APC (clone 17A2, Biolegend), CD4 (clone GK1.5; Biolegend), CD25-PE-Cy5
(clone PC61, Biolegend), and glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (GITR, clone
DTA1; Biolegend) and Fixable, Viability Dye (FVD)-eFluor (EF) 780 (eBioscience
from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, San Diego, CA). All antibodies were used here at
1:100 dilution for ﬂow cytometry. Live Tregs (CD4+GITR+CD25+) were sorted
using a BD LSRFortessa SORP (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), into RLT buffer and
RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Ribosomal RNA was depleted using the NEBNext Ultra II rRNA depletion Kit
(New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and libraries were generated using the
NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs). Libraries were
sequenced on a NextSeq 500 1 × 75 base pairs at an approximate read depth of 30
million reads per library. Samples were aligned with the kallisto pseudoalignment
protocol and mm10 build for the mouse genome to produce estimated counts35.
Counts were then processed using the sleuth R package (v0.30.0)36 aggregating
based on gene symbol. Expression values were transformed into log2(n + 1) values.
Chemical synthesis. DT2216 (ref. 16) and PZ15227 (ref. 18) were synthesized as
described previously.
Ex vivo culture of tumor slice sections. De-identiﬁed human tumor samples were
obtained from the Clinical and Translational Science Institute Biorepository at the
University of Florida under the IRB approved study number IRB201901677. Fresh
human or mouse tumor samples were encased in 3% agarose and cut into 300-µm-
thick sections using a Compresstome VF-300 OZ (Precision Instruments, Green-
ville, NC). Sections were cultured in 12-well plates in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle
Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml
penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Alternating slices were grouped and treated
with different concentrations of DT2216 (25 nM, 50 nM, and/or 100 nM) or vehicle
alone and cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 48 h. Tumor slice samples were
dissociated into single cells via enzymatic and mechanical dissociation using the
Human Tumor Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec), following with ﬂow cytometry
to quantitate different populations of immune cells.
Cell lines and cell culture. MC38 mouse colon carcinoma cells (Kerafast Inc.,
Boston, MA) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM
glutamine, 0.1 M non-essential amino acids (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA), 1 mM
sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomy-
cin. 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cells and Renca mouse renal carcinoma cells
were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in
RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml
streptomycin. Py8119 mouse mammary carcinoma cells37 were obtained from Dr.
Lesley Ellies at the University of California San Diego and cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. All
cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidiﬁed incubator.
CRISPR/CAS9-mediated KO and viability assay. BCL-XL-KO MC38 and Renca
cells were generated by transient transfection of Cas9 protein-guide RNA complex
into parental cells, followed by single clone section and immunoblot to conﬁrm KO
of BCL-XL following the instruction (Synthego). The guide RNA used for BCL-XL
KO is 5′-AUACUUUUGUGGAACUCUAU-3′.
Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 3 × 103 to 5 × 103 cells per well
and cultured overnight. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of DT2216,
PZ15227, ABT199, a BCL2 speciﬁc inhibitor10 (LC laboratories), A1155463, a BCL-XL
speciﬁc inhibitor38 (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX), ABT263, a BCL-2/BCL-XL dual
inhibitor9 (Selleck Chemicals) or S63845, a MCL-1 selective inhibitor12 (Selleck
Chemicals) for 72 h. Cell viability was measured by tetrazolium-based MTS assay as
described previously16. Brieﬂy, MTS reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was
supplemented with phenazine methosulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at a 20:1
ratio and 20 µl was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Absorbance was
measured at 490 nm using a Synergy Neo2 multimode plate reader (Biotek, Winooski,
VT) and cell viability was determined for each well. The data were expressed as the
average percent of viable cells and ﬁtted in non-linear regression curves using Prism
software (GraphPad Software).
Animal studies. All animal studies were approved by the University of Florida
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol
201810399. All animals were housed in a pathogen-free Association for Assessment
and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care accredited facility at the University
of Florida and performed in accordance with IACUC guidelines. The room tem-
perature is 21.1–23.3 °C with an acceptable daily ﬂuctuation of 2 °C. Typically the
room is 22.2 °C all the time. The humidity set point is 50% but can vary ±15% daily
depending on the weather. The photoperiod is 12:12 and the light intensity range is
15.6–25.8 FC. C57BL/6 and Balb/C mice were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories (San Diego, CA). NOD-SCID interleukin-2 receptor gamma null
(NSG) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). For all
studies involving DT2216 or PZ15227 (ref. 16), the compounds were formulated in
50% phosal PG, 45% miglyol 810N, and 5% polysorbate 80 and administered via
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. ABT199 (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) was for-
mulated in 60% phosal 50 PG, 30% PEG 400, and 10% ethanol and administered 5
consecutive days per week by oral gavage. For studies in non-tumor bearing mice,
6–8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were treated once weekly with DT2216 at 7.5 mg/kg
body weight or vehicle alone. Blood samples were taken just before each treatment
and 24 h later. For syngeneic tumor models, 1 × 105 cells (MC38 and Renca) or 500
cells (for Py8119) were resuspended in 50% phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 50%
Matrigel (Corning Inc., Corning, NY), and implanted into 6–8-week-old C57BL/6
(MC38, s.c.; and Py8119, intra mammary fatpad), Balb/C (Renca, s.c.), or NSG
mice. Tumor growth was monitored daily and measured twice weekly with calipers
and volume was determined using the formula ½ (L × W2). Once the largest
tumors reached 0.5 cm in diameter, mice were treated with 7.5 mg/kg body weight
DT2216 by i.p. injection once weekly, or with 30 mg/kg body weight of PZ15227 by
i.p. injection every 4 days. For BCL-2 inhibitor study, once the largest tumors
reached 0.5 cm in diameter, mice were treated with 100 mg/kg ABT199 5 days per
week by oral gavage. Mice were euthanized in accordance with IACUC protocol
once the largest tumors reached 2 cm in diameter and tissues were collected for
further analysis.
For non-tumor bearing mice, 8-week-old mice were treated with 7.5 mg/kg
body weight DT2216 by i.p. injection once weekly for upto 5 weeks when tissues
were collected for analysis.
Flow cytometry. Mouse tumors were excised and ~200 mg of tumor tissue was
enzymatically and mechanically digested using the mouse Tumor Dissociation Kit
(Miltenyi Biotec) to obtain a single-cell suspension. Human tumor samples and sec-
tions were enzymatically and mechanically digested using the human Tumor Dis-
sociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) to obtain single-cell suspension. Red blood cells were
lysed using ACK lysis buffer and mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient
using SepMate Tubes (StemCell Technologies) and Lymphoprep density gradient
media (StemCell Technologies). Mouse cells were then washed and incubated with
combinations of the following antibodies; anti-mouse CD62L-BV785 (clone MEL-14),
anti-mouse MHCII I-A/I-E-BB515 (Clone 2G9, BD Biosciences, 1:400), anti-mouse
CD11B-PEdazzle (clone M1/70, 1:200), anti-mouse CD45-AF532 (clone 30F.11), anti-
mouse CD3-APC (clone 17A2), anti-mouse CD8-BV510 (clone 53-6.7), anti-mouse
CD4-BV605 (clone GK1.5), anti-mouse NK1.1-AF700 (clone PK136), anti-mouse
CD69-SB436 (clone H1.2F3, eBioscience), anti-mouse CD279 (clone-PerCP-EF710,
eBioscience Inc), anti-mouse CD366-PacBlue (clone B8.2c12), anti-mouse CD11C-PE-

antibodies: anti-human CD45-BV510 (clone H130), anti-human CD3-AF700 (clone
HIT5a), anti-human CD4-BV421 (clone OKT4), anti-human CD8-BV711 (clone
RPA-T8), anti-human CD127-BV605 (clone A019DS), anti-human CD25-PE-Cy7
(clone MA251) plus FVD-eFluor-780 (eBioscience) and human FcR blocking Reagent
(StemCell Technologies). Anti-human CD45RA (clone: HI100) and anti-human
CCR7 (clone: G043H7) were included for the effector/memory analysis for different
populations of PB and TI T cells. Cells were washed then ﬁxed and permeabilized
using the eBioscience FOXP3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set. Cells were
further stained with a combination of the following antibodies: anti-human FOXP3-
FITC (clone 206D), anti-mouse/human BCL-XL-PE (clone S486, Cell Signaling
Technologies). Flow cytometry was performed on a 3 laser Cytek Aurora Cytometer
(Cytek Biosciences, Fremont, CA) and analyzed using FlowJo software (BD Bios-
ciences). All antibodies are from Biolegend, unless otherwise speciﬁed. Most antibodies
were used at 1:100 dilution for ﬂow cytometry, unless speciﬁed.
NIR-FLIVO poly-caspase activity assay. MC38 tumor-bearing mice were treated
with 7.5 mg/kg DT2216 or vehicle via i.p. injection; 24 h later, the mice were
injected with 50 µl of NIR-FLIVO 690 caspase probe (ImmunoChemistry Tech-
nologies, Bloomington, MN) via i.v. injection per the manufacturer’s suggestion.
Tumors and spleens were harvested after 4 h. Tumors were chemically and enzy-
matically digested using the mouse Tumor Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) and
mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient using SepMate 50 tubes
(StemCell Technologies) and lymphoprep (StemCell Technologies). Spleens were
pressed though a 40-µm nylon strainer and red blood cells were lysed with ACK
lysis buffer. Cells were incubated with the following antibodies: anti-mouse CD45-
AF532 (clone 30F.11), anti-mouse CD3-APC (clone 17A2), anti-mouse CD4-
BV605 (clone GK1.5), anti-mouse CD8 (clone MEL-14), CD11B-PE-dazzle (clone
M1/70, 1:200), and FVD-eFluor-780. Cells were then ﬁxed and permeabilized with
eBioscience FOXP3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set, following with
intracellular staining of anti-mouse FOXP3-EF450 (FJK-16S, eBioscience, 1:50).
Antibodies were used at 1:100 dilution for ﬂow cytometry unless speciﬁed. Flow
cytometry was performed on a 3 laser Cytek Aurora Cytometer (Cytek Biosciences,
Fremont, CA) and analyzed using FlowJo software (BD Biosciences). All antibodies
are from Biolegend, unless otherwise speciﬁed.
Immunoblot. Cells or tumors samples were lysed with RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl,
5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.5% SDS)
supplemented with 1 mM dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were
then separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by standard western blotting protocol.
Antibodies used were anti-BCL-XL (Cell Signaling, 54H6, 1:1000), anti-MCL-1
(Cell Signaling, D35A5, 1:1000), a nti-BCL-2 (Cell Signaling, 50E3, 1:500), and
anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling, 1:10,000).
Statistical methods. All graphs, unless indicated otherwise, were made and sta-
tistical analysis done using Prism software (GraphPad Software). For comparison
of tumor growth curves, a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed.
To compare the means of three or more groups, a one-way ANOVA was per-
formed and comparisons between speciﬁc groups were done using Dunnett’s
multiple comparison test. To compare the means of two groups, an unpaired T test
was performed. For analysis of RNAseq expression data comparing the expression
of genes between two groups, a two-tailed unpaired T test was performed with a
Bonferroni correction. The precise P values were provided.
