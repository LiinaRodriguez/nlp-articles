Abstract 
Background  Nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery aims to target specific cells, addressing the challenge that many 
drugs lack the necessary properties to reach their intended targets effectively. Lipid-based nanocarriers considered 
as a promising drug delivery due to their biocompatibility and ability to encapsulate various drugs. Surface modi-
fications, including the attachment of polyethylene glycol for stability and the conjugation of targeting ligands 
(e.g., antibodies, peptides) for specific delivery, play a crucial role in enhancing the interaction of these nanocarriers 
with biological environments. These modifications improve cellular uptake and targeted delivery, thereby increas-
ing therapeutic efficacy and reducing side effects. This review will explore various surface modification techniques 
and their impact on the performance of lipid nanocarriers in drug delivery.
Main body  Lipid-based nanodelivery platforms have garnered significant interest due to their notable characteristics, 
including their ability to accommodate high drug loads, reduced toxicity, improved bioavailability, and compatibility 
with biological systems, stability within the gastrointestinal environment, controlled release capabilities, streamlined 
scaling up processes, and simplified validation procedures. Targeted lipid-based nanocarriers represent a significant 
advancement over non-targeted counterparts in cancer therapy. Unlike non-targeted systems, which distribute drugs 
indiscriminately throughout the body, targeted lipid-based nanocarriers can be engineered with ligands or antibodies 
to specifically recognize and bind to tumor-associated markers, enabling precise drug delivery to cancer cells. This tar-
geted approach enhances therapeutic efficacy while minimizing adverse effects on healthy tissues, thereby offering 
a promising strategy for improving the outcomes of cancer treatment.
Conclusion  The authors in this review provide an overview of preclinical research on diverse lipid-based nanocar-
riers, such as liposomes, solid lipid nanocarriers, and lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles. The customization of these 
carriers using various surface modifiers is discussed, including folic Acid, peptides, polysaccharides, transferrin, 
and antibodies. Surface-modified nanocarriers offer regulated discharge, improved penetration capability, and pre-
cise drug conveyance. This work compiles recent instances of emerging surface-modified lipid-based nanocarrier 
systems and their applications, sourced from existing literature. Novel approaches to surface engineering of these 
nanocarriers, aimed at enhancing their specificity and efficacy in targeted drug delivery, were discussed. Key 
advancements in this field, such as improved targeting mechanisms and significant therapeutic outcomes demon-
strated in preclinical studies, were highlighted. Additionally, critical gaps that require attention include long-term

1  Background
In recent years, progress in developing novel medications 
has slowed due to substantial costs and lengthy discovery 
periods. Additionally, the prevalence of adverse reactions 
and drug resistance underscores the need to enhance the 
safety and efficacy balance of established pharmaceu-
ticals. One viable approach to tackle these obstacles is 
ensuring the precise delivery of drugs to their intended 
sites of action [1, 2]. This involves achieving targeted 
accumulation of drugs at the appropriate locations, in 
optimal quantities, and at the correct timing [2]. Nano-
carriers, characterized by their small size, narrow size 
distribution, and high surface-to-volume ratio, exhibit 
enhanced cellular penetration and interaction with bio-
molecules, thereby improving absorption, bioavailability, 
and stability [3, 4]. They offer the advantage of precise 
targeting, and facile surface modification for active tar-
geting purposes [4]. These nanocarriers are categorized 
into lipid-based, polymer-based, viral nanoparticles, or 
inorganic nanoparticles, based on their constituent mate-
rials [5]. Among these, the lipid-based nanocarrier sys-
tem represents the forefront of drug delivery technology, 
offering advantages such as easy large-scale production, 
biocompatibility, and biodegradability owing to its inher-
ent material characteristics [6]. Additionally, it boasts low 
toxicity, enables controlled, and tailored drug release, [7] 
enhances drug solubility and accommodates both hydro-
philic and lipophilic drugs [8].
1.1  Objective
This review focuses on the role of surface modifications 
in enhancing the targeting capabilities of lipid-based 
nanocarriers for cancer therapy. It aims to provide a 
comprehensive overview of various surface modification 
techniques, their applications in targeted drug delivery, 
and recent advances in this field.
2  Lipid‑based nanocarriers and surface 
modifications
Lipid-based nanocarriers have emerged as a versatile and 
promising platform for drug delivery, gene therapy, and 
diagnostics. Utilizing naturally occurring lipids, these 
nanocarriers encapsulate therapeutic agents to enhance 
stability, bioavailability, and targeting capabilities. Major

types include liposomes, SLNs, and LPHNPs (Table  1). 
Surface modifications for lipid-based nanocarriers are 
techniques used to alter the surface properties of lipid 
nanocarriers to improve their performance for drug 
delivery applications. These modifications can enhance 
the stability, targeting ability, and overall efficacy of the 
nanocarriers.
2.1  Liposomes
Liposomes, initially introduced in 1964, are molecular 
assemblies created from amphiphilic components, like 
polar lipids, dispersed within water. These structures, 
resembling cell membranes in composition, and struc-
ture, form bilayer spheres [9]. With an aqueous core, 
liposomes feature core–shell structures, allowing the 
encapsulation of both hydrophilic, and hydrophobic sub-
stances [10]. They are straightforward to prepare and can 
be tailored for various uses by adjusting their composi-
tion, size, and lamellarity. Additionally, liposomes can 
be modified with different molecules, giving them spe-
cific functionalities for a wide array of applications [11]. 
They have found utility in diverse fields including drug 
delivery, vaccine development, the exploration of proto-
cells, and the origins of life. Liposomes can also be loaded 
with nanocarriers of different types, and sizes, expand-
ing their potential applications even further due to their 
exceptional characteristics, and properties. For all the 
mentioned advantages of liposomes, several commer-
cially available formulations have been developed such 
as Doxil® (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection) is well 
known for improving the delivery of doxorubicin to can-
cer cells while minimizing systemic toxicity and is used 
in treating breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and Kaposi’s 
sarcoma. Additionally, DepoCyt® (cytarabine liposome 
injection) targets lymphomatous meningitis by delivering 
cytarabine more effectively to the central nervous sys-
tem. Similarly, Myocet® (doxorubicin liposome injec-
tion) offers similar benefits for breast cancer treatment, 
enhancing drug stability and reducing side effects. These 
formulations showcase the clinical efficacy and impact of 
liposomal technology in cancer therapy [12].
2.1.1  Folic acid targeted liposomes
Phospholipid-anchored 
folate 
conjugates 
direct 
liposomes to tumors with folate receptors, offering a 
promising chemotherapy delivery strategy [13]. Epithelial 
neoplastic cells, including those found in various cancers 
such as kidney, lung, colon, breast, cervical, and brain, 
commonly exhibit overexpression of two main forms 
of FA receptors (FR a and FR b) on their surfaces [14]. 
Notably, normal tissues generally express minimal lev-
els of FRs. Folate receptors (FRs) are glycoproteins rich 
in cysteine with a high affinity for binding folate. They 
facilitate the uptake of folate through receptor-mediated 
endocytosis. Once FRs ligands bind, the plasma mem-
brane envelops the receptor-ligand complex, creating an 
endosome. This specific binding and uptake mechanism 
makes FRs an attractive target for drug delivery in can-
cer therapy [15]. FA stands out as a preferred targeting 
ligand due to its distinct advantages over other ligands, 
including its high specificity towards tumors, high tumor 
cell penetration, lack of immunogenicity, enhanced sta-
bility, and ease of functional group modification [16]. 
FA-modified liposomes was fabricated to deliver 5-fluo-
rouracil (5FU) to tumor cells [17]. The liposomes were 
prepared using the thin-layer method with PC/cho-
lesterol and PC/cholesterol/FA-PEG-DSPE at molar 
ratios of 2:1 and 2:1:0.031, respectively. Initially, FA was 
conjugated with amino-PEG acetic acid using EDC and 
NHS as coupling reagents, yielding FA-PEG-COOH.

Subsequently, FA-PEG-COOH was conjugated with 
1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine 
(DSPE) in the presence of EDC and NHS to produce 
the FA-PEG-DSPE conjugate. Studies conducted using 
CT26, a murine colorectal carcinoma cell line, revealed 
that the targeted liposomes exhibited elevated cellu-
lar uptake and enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
production compared to the free drug when evaluated 
in colon cancer cells. Additionally, the half-maximal 
inhibitory concentration ­(IC50) values, a critical metric 
for evaluating the inhibitory strength of a substance and 
determining the potency and potential efficacy of drugs, 
were measured and found to be very low. Hemolysis 
assays confirmed that the liposomes were biocompatible 
with blood. In  vivo experiments demonstrated that the 
folate-targeted liposomes were more effective at inhibit-
ing tumor growth than the free drug [17]. Moreover, in 
another study FA -modified liposomes were loaded with 
curcumin (Cur) to target and treat breast cancer. The goal 
was to enhance the effectiveness of Cur against breast 
cancer cells by specifically targeting FR that are abun-
dant in these cells [18]. The researchers developed and 
tested both the folate targeted liposomes and untargeted 
ones using cell cultures in 2D and 3D models. Results 
showed that folate targeted liposomes had a significantly 
stronger toxic effect on the cancer cells compared to free 
Cur and untargeted formulation. Furthermore, cellular 
uptake assays indicated that modified liposomes had bet-
ter penetration into the cells and spheroids compared to 
the other formulations, suggesting that folate targeted 
liposomes improved their ability to be internalized by 
breast cancer cells through interaction with FR [18]. 
Additionally, for improving the effectiveness of vincris-
tine (Hanfang Pharmaceutical Co.) against multidrug-
resistant cancers, FA-linked PEGylated liposomes were 
used to encapsulate vincristine for treating resistant can-
cers, the authors aimed to enhance its antitumor activity. 
Their findings showed that this delivery method had the 
highest toxicity against resistant cancer cells compared 
to naked liposomes. Additionally, it effectively inhibited 
tumor growth in both laboratories, animal studies, and 
induced cell death [19].
2.1.2  Peptide targeted liposomes
Peptides have emerged as a promising tool for targeting 
cancer cells due to their unique properties and versatil-
ity. Key perspectives on their use in cancer cell target-
ing include their high specificity, which reduces impact 
on healthy cells and minimizes side effects. Additionally, 
their versatile functionalization allows them to be tai-
lored to enhance stability, binding affinity, and resistance 
to enzymatic degradation [20]. Most peptide-targeted 
liposomes have been created using peptides that are 
already known to bind to specific receptors [21]. Pep-
tides exhibit high specificity due to their unique amino 
acid sequences, which determine their three-dimen-
sional structure and receptor affinity. Upon binding, the 
receptor undergoes conformational changes, initiating 
intracellular signaling cascades and recruiting adaptor 
proteins. The receptor-ligand complex is often inter-
nalized through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, with 
clathrin proteins forming a coated pit on the plasma 
membrane’s inner surface. This process ensures targeted 
delivery and minimizes off-target effects, improving 
therapeutic outcomes by releasing the therapeutic agent 
within target cells [22]. Numerous peptides possess both 
the structure and biological characteristics necessary to 
guide liposomes toward tumor tissues. Utilizing a tumor 
metastasis targeting (TMT) peptide to deliver liposomes 
containing doxorubicin (DOX, Hisun Pharmaceutical 
Co.) to highly metastatic cancer cells was designed spe-
cifically to highly metastatic tumors [23]. The researchers 
showed that these targeted nanocarriers had favorable 
characteristics such as drug release behavior as well as 
particle size when tested in laboratory settings. They are 
taken up more quickly by highly metastatic cancer cells 
through a receptor-based process, and they effectively 
target highly metastatic tumors both in living organisms, 
and in laboratory samples. Furthermore, the study indi-
cated that the designed targeted liposomes significantly 
improved the effectiveness of DOX in slowing down 
the growth of xenograft tumors and causing cancer cell 
death, with minimal side effects [23]. To address the 
challenges posed by the acidic conditions and cancer-
associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor microenvi-
ronment (TME), which can impact the stability, release 
profiles, and uptake of nanocarriers, Chen and colleagues 
developed targeted liposomes. This nanocarrier, called 
TR-PTX/HCQ-Lip, featured a tandem peptide targeting 
integrin αvβ3 and was designed to respond to the acidic 
conditions of tumor microenvironments. It is engineered 
to deliver a combination of the autophagy inhibitor 
hydroxychloroquine and the chemotherapy drug pacli-
taxel (PTX) to both tumor cells and CAFs. Their research 
demonstrated that these liposomes effectively target 
and penetrate pancreatic tumors, inhibit autophagy, 
and reduce stromal fibrosis, leading to improved thera-
peutic outcomes in various pancreatic cancer models 
[24]. Vakhshiteh et  al. [25] developed liposomes modi-
fied with cyclic RGD peptides and PEG to deliver miR-
34a, a known tumor suppressor microRNA, directly to 
breast cancer cells. These liposomes selectively targeted 
cells expressing integrin receptors, which are abun-
dant in breast cancer. The results found that the tar-
geted liposomes were significantly more internalized 
by breast carcinoma cells, leading to increased miR-34a

accumulation. Consequently, this resulted in notable 
inhibition of tumor cell growth, migration, and invasion, 
along with a reduction in the proportion of cancer stem-
like cells [25]. CAFs hinder drug delivery within tumors 
and deteriorate the TME. Directly depleting CAFs risks 
tumor metastasis. This study explores reversing epithe-
lial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in liver cancer by 
using CFH peptide (CFHKHKSPALSPVGGG)-decorated 
liposomes containing oxymatrine (CFH/OM-L) to tar-
get Tenascin-C. CFH/OM-L upregulates E-cadherin and 
downregulates vimentin, N-cadherin, and snail protein, 
effectively reversing EMT. Combined with an icaritin-
loaded lipid complex, it enhances anticancer efficacy, 
reduces collagen levels, and improves nanocarrier pen-
etration in tumor models. CFH/OM-L inactivates rather 
than kills CAFs, reducing metastasis risk and reprogram-
ming the TME to activate immune cells. This approach 
offers a promising strategy for combination therapies in 
hepatocellular carcinoma [26]. In a recent study cationic 
liposome was developed as a targeted delivery system by 
attaching a peptide-based ligand (THRPPMWSPVWP) 
that binds specifically to transferrin receptors at the 
blood–brain barrier (BBB). This liposome was then com-
bined with a CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid designed to knock 
down P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The peptide-conjugated 
liposomes showed significantly higher uptake in bEND.3 
cells compared to those without the peptide. Addition-
ally, the CRISPR/Cas9 liposomes effectively knocked 
down P-gp, leading to increased P-gp-related ATP activi-
ties in the treated cells [27].
2.1.3  Polysaccharides targeted liposomes
Polysaccharides play an important role in the field of 
pharmaceutical industry, being widely utilized in various 
applications. Cellulose derivatives, alginate, hyaluronic 
acid (HA), mannans, and dextrans are commonly used to 
modify nanocarriers, creating targeted delivery systems 
for drugs, vaccines, theranostics, and immune-thera-
peutics [28]. The mechanism of polysaccharide-receptor 
interactions is influenced by the distinct arrangement 
of sugar residues. Receptors have carbohydrate-binding 
domains that identify specific glycan structures through 
various non-covalent interactions. For instance, receptors 
like C-type lectin receptors and galectins possess special-
ized carbohydrate-binding domains (CBDs) that enable 
the recognition and binding of polysaccharides. When 
a polysaccharide binds to the receptor, it induces con-
formational changes in the receptor, which can trigger 
intracellular signaling pathways. This understanding is 
crucial for optimizing the design of polysaccharide-mod-
ified nanocarriers to enhance their targeting and thera-
peutic efficacy [29]. A particular focus is placed on the 
modification of liposome surfaces with polysaccharides, 
representing a unique aspect of bioconjugation chemis-
try. A novel, and challenging approach involves the use of 
chemistry for the orthogonal binding of polysaccharides 
onto the surface of liposomes, aiming to enhance the 
development of drug, and vaccine targeting nanosystems 
[30]. Innovative method for producing sucrose-coated 
liposomes using a microfluidic system was developed, 
which improves the delivery of drugs to cancer cells. Spe-
cifically focusing on loading liposomes with berberine 
hydrochloride (BBH, ACEF Italy), a natural compound 
known for its anticancer properties, particularly against 
triple-negative breast cancer cells [31]. The results 
revealed that sucrose-coated liposomes exhibited notably 
stronger antiproliferative effects on MDA-MB-231 cells 
compared to non-coated ones. The results confirmed 
that the presence of sucrose on the liposome surface 
increased drug uptake by cancer cells, thus improving 
the therapeutic effectiveness of encapsulated BBH. In this 
research, liposome surfaces were modified with disaccha-
ride molecules, such as sucrose or maltose, which inter-
act with lectins (carbohydrate-binding proteins) found 
on the surface of many cancerous cells [32]. The study 
demonstrated that these decorated liposomes enhance 
the uptake of liposomes into different cancer cell lines 
through the mechanism of endocytosis. Moreover, disac-
charide-modified liposomes loaded with the anticancer 
drug DOX exhibit increased cytotoxicity against diverse 
cancer cells compared to unmodified liposomes. Conse-
quently, the authors suggest that disaccharide-modified 
liposomes hold promise as cancer-targeting carriers, 
enhancing intracellular uptake, and cytotoxicity through 
lectin-mediated endocytosis [32].
2.1.4  Transferrin‑targeted liposomes
Naturally occurring proteins like Tf have garnered sig-
nificant interest in drug targeting due to their non-toxic, 
biodegradable, and non-immunogenic properties. Addi-
tionally, their high abundance of receptors on cell sur-
faces enables precise targeting to specific sites [33]. The 
high affinity of transferrin for TfRs allows nanocarriers 
to efficiently bind to and target overexpressed receptors 
on cancer cells. Following this binding, the transferrin-
coated nanocarriers are internalized via clathrin-medi-
ated endocytosis, mimicking the natural transferrin-TfR 
complex. Inside the cancer cells, the nanocarriers release 
their therapeutic payload in response to the acidic pH of 
the endosome, enabling controlled release of the agents 
and improving therapeutic efficacy while reducing off-
target effects [34]. The effective cellular uptake through 
the Tf pathway has demonstrated promise in delivering 
anticancer drugs, [35] therapeutic genes, and proteins 
into highly proliferating malignant cells that exhibit 
heightened expression of Tf receptors (TfRs). A study was 
Page 6 of 21
Anwar et al. Beni-Suef Univ J Basic Appl Sci          (2024) 13:106 
conducted to create an innovative drug delivery method 
for glioblastoma. The researchers utilized Polyethyl-
ene glycol-coated (pegylated) liposomes to encapsulate 
resveratrol (RES, Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO)) [36]. 
To target cancer cells specifically, the liposomes were 
modified with Tf components, taking advantage of the 
increased presence of TfRs in glioblastoma multiforme 
(GBM), Fig.  1. Results indicated that these modified 
liposomes, exhibited greater cytotoxicity, and prompted 
higher levels of apoptosis in GBM cells in comparison 
with free RES or RES-L. In a mouse model xenograft of 
GBM, Tf modified liposomes were notably more effective 
in impeding tumor growth, and enhancing survival rates. 
The authors concluded that the developed liposomes 
containing RES demonstrate promising efficacy both in 
laboratory settings and animal models [36]. Fernandes 
et al. [37] developed and characterized liposomes loaded 
with docetaxel and functionalized with Tf to precisely 
target prostate cancer cells. Encapsulation efficiency 
for docetaxel was approximately 69% for functionalized 
liposomes and 37% for non-functionalized ones. Func-
tionalized liposomes demonstrated enhanced uptake by 
prostate cancer cells compared to non-functionalized 
ones. In vitro cytotoxicity assays revealed that function-
alized liposomes were more effective against prostate 
cancer cells than the commercial formulation [37]. In 
another study theranostic Tf targeted liposomes intended 
for the treatment of brain cancer were developed. This 
investigation utilized D-alpha-tocopheryl PEG 1000 
succinate mono-ester (TPGS) liposomes as carriers for 
brain theranostics [38]. These liposomes incorporate Tf 
as a ligand recognizing specific tumor cell markers, and 
were loaded with both docetaxel (Neon Laboratories Ltd) 
and quantum dots [39]. In vivo experimentation suggests 
that these liposomes show potential as vehicles for brain 
theranostics because of their small size for delivery and 
ability to penetrate and offering enhanced and prolonged 
brain targeting of docetaxel and quantum dots compared 
to non-targeted formulations [38].
2.1.5  Antibody‑targeted liposomes
Antibody-targeted nanocarriers are advanced drug 
delivery systems designed to enhance the specificity and 
efficacy of therapeutic agents. These nanocarriers are 
engineered with antibodies or their derivatives that spe-
cifically bind to antigens or receptors overexpressed on 
cancer cells. The Y-shaped glycoprotein of the antibody 
recognizes and binds to a unique epitope on the recep-
tor protein present on the surface of the target cells. This 
binding interaction is mediated by the variable regions 
of the antibody, which are highly specific to the antigen. 
The effectiveness of this interaction is often augmented 
by the increased surface expression of the receptor on the 
targeted cancer cells. Once bound, the antibody-receptor 
interaction can trigger various cellular responses, such as 
internalization of the nanocarrier and subsequent release 
Fig. 1  Tf-directed liposomes containing RES aimed at addressing glioblastoma. These targeted formulations showed superior pharmacokinetics 
(PK), and brain accumulation properties as well as improved in vitro cytotoxicity, and uptake also exhibited superior effectiveness compared 
to the unencapsulated drug or non-targeted liposomes in both in vitro, and animal studies. Adapted with permission from ref. [24] copyright (2024)

of the therapeutic agent, depending on the specific 
nature of the antibody-receptor engagement [40]. Mon-
oclonal antibodies (mAbs) or their derived compounds 
frequently serve as the designated ligands within ligand-
targeted liposomes (LTLs) [41]. When LTLs are enhanced 
with mAbs or their derivatives, they are categorized as 
immunoliposomes [42]. These specialized liposomes are 
engineered to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of con-
ventional drugs. The advancement of immunoliposomes, 
combining antibody engineering with liposome tech-
nology, is a promising frontier in research [43]. A novel 
approach to targeted cancer therapy involves the crea-
tion of DOX-loaded liposomes with extended circula-
tion times, modified with the monoclonal nucleosome 
(NS)-specific 2C5 antibody (mAb 2C5). By coating the 
liposomes with PEG, a hydrophilic polymer, they become 
adept at accumulating in solid tumors via the enhanced 
permeability and retention effect. In  vitro experiments 
demonstrated that these modified liposomes, laden with 
DOX, exhibited superior efficacy in killing various tumor 
cells in comparison with the non-targeted liposomes 
carrying the drug [44]. Lukyanov et al. [44] investigated 
the potential for attaching an anticancer mAbs 2C5 to 
the liposomes loaded with Doxil Pharmaceutics (West 
Roxbury, MA). Results indicated that mAb 2C5-tar-
geted liposomes exhibited increased accumulation in 
tumors, leading to significantly superior therapeutic 
effects in vivo compared to all Doxil control treatments. 
Tumor weights following mAb 2C5-Doxil treatment were 
reduced to only 25% to 40% of those in control groups, 
highlighting the effectiveness of 2C5-targeted Doxil in 
delivering drugs specifically to tumors and enhancing 
therapy efficacy. In another formulation liposomes were 
modified with anti-CD44 antibodies in order to improve 
the effectiveness of timosaponin AIII. The results showed 
that the anti-CD44 antibody-modified liposomes dis-
played significantly heightened cytotoxicity, and more 
potent suppression of tumor growth compared to their 
unmodified counterparts. This research suggests that 
anti-CD44 antibody-modified liposomes hold promise 
as a treatment option for CD44-positive cancers, offering 
substantial antitumor benefits [45]. Table 2 demonstrates 
summary for surface modified liposomes for cancer 
therapy. By addressing the role of TME in influencing 
the effectiveness of liposomes delivery, tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs) are considered one of the most 
aggressive barriers to effective cancer treatment. These 
macrophages, which are a major component of the TME, 
often support tumor progression by promoting angio-
genesis, suppressing immune responses, and enhanc-
ing tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Chen et al. [46] 
devised a combined treatment strategy for TME using 
a co-delivery liposome system containing the mTOR 
inhibitor rapamycin and the antiangiogenesis drug 
regorafenib to simultaneously regulate tumor metabo-
lism and angiogenesis. By dual modification with a PD-L1 
antibody and mannose ligand, the liposomes targeted 
TAMs and cancer cells overexpressing PD-L1 and man-
nose receptors. This delivery system effectively reduced 
glycolysis, repolarized TAMs, suppressed angiogenesis, 
reconfigured immune cells, and consequently inhibited 
tumor growth. A recent study demonstrated that deliver-
ing CRISPR/Cas9 via liposomes effectively targets HPV, 
inducing autophagy and immune activation. In  vivo, 
HPV-targeting guide RNA-liposomes increased CD8 + T 
cell infiltration, elevated proinflammatory cytokines, and 
reduced regulatory T cells and myeloid suppressor cells. 
Combining these liposomes with immune checkpoint 
inhibitors and anti-PD-1 antibodies enhanced antitumor 
effects and induced immune memory in cervical cancer 
models [47].
2.2  Solid lipid nanoparticles
Solid lipid-based nanoparticles exhibit considerable 
promise for transporting pharmaceuticals, and genetic 
material. These lipidic system offer an encouraging 
avenue for advancing new therapies, primarily due to 
their simplicity of formulation, and distinct size-related 
characteristics [48]. Their capacity to encase drugs, and 
nucleic acids, alongside their facile surface modifica-
tion, renders them appealing nanosystems for precise 
drug, and gene delivery. These nanocarriers can be given 
through different methods such as through the skin, oral, 
parenteral, and pulmonary, expanding their applicability. 
In comparison with alternative delivery systems, lipidic 
nanocarriers amalgamate several benefits such as mini-
mal toxicity, controlled release of enclosed substances, 
and high biocompatibility. They have demonstrated effec-
tiveness in delivering drugs that are poorly water-sol-
uble or insoluble, reducing unintended side effects, and 
enhancing the targeted delivery of active agents [49].
2.2.1  Folic acid‑targeted SLNs
Utilizing FA ligands for targeting SLNs presents a 
promising approach to address the issue of non-selec-
tivity in cancer therapy. Consequently, FA has been 
widely employed for nanocarriers modification to 
enhance endocytosis via FRs. Yassemi et  al. [50] dis-
cussed the development of SLNs to serve as carrier 
SLNs s for letrozole (LTZ, Tofigh Daru Co. (I. R. Iran)) 
and modified with FA. Scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) revealed the uniform, and spherical morphology 
of both SLNs-LTZ, and FA-SLNs-LTZ. Results from 
cell culture experiments demonstrated that FA-SLNs-
LTZ exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity against 
MCF-7 cancer cells compared to SLNs-LTZ, and free

LTZ, with an ­IC50 value of 81 ± 0.89 nM. Overall, this 
study suggests that FA-SLNs-LTZ holds potential to 
trigger programmed cell death in a precise target-ori-
ented fashion while minimizing adverse effects on the 
entire system [50]. Another study aimed to enhance the 
therapeutic potential of Chrysin (CHY) by loading it 
onto SLNs and then decorating these nanocarriers with 
folate-bound chitosan. The targeted SLNs loaded with 
CHY exhibited scavenging activity against 2,2-diphe-
nyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) ­(IC50: 108.7 µg/mL), and 
2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid 
(ABTS) ­(IC50: 123.73 µg/mL) free radicals, as well as 
suppressing angiogenesis. The observed up-regulation 
of Bax, and caspase 9 genes, along with findings from 
fluorescence staining, and cell cycle analysis, provided 
further evidence of the pro-apoptotic properties of 
CHY-SCF-NPs. These findings suggest that the targeted 
SLNs loaded with CHY hold promise as a further explo-
ration in preclinical, and clinical studies, particularly 
for pancreatic cancer treatment [51]. Chitosan-coated 
SLNs were fabricated to co-load trans-resveratrol 
(RSV) and ferulic acid (FER), and they were conjugated 
with folic acid (FA) for targeting colon cancer, utiliz-
ing Sulfo-NHS and EDC as coupling reagents. In vitro 
studies indicated that FA targeted RSV-FER-SLNs 
effectively heightened cytotoxicity against cancer cells, 
leading to apoptosis induction compared to free RSV-
FER. Consequently, the robust stability of the opti-
mized formulation under acidic conditions suggests 
their promise as a prospective candidate for innovative 
nano drug formulations in colon cancer treatment [52].
2.2.2  Peptide‑targeted SLNs
Modifying the surface of SLNs by attaching different 
ligands such as cell-penetrating peptides and homing 
peptides aims to address issues of non-specificity, reduce 
adverse effects, and enhance the effectiveness of antican-
cer treatments. This approach increases drug concentra-
tion at the tumor site due to their small size, allowing 
them to penetrate tumors more effectively compared to 
larger molecules like antibodies [53]. For treating GBM 
were developed with surface modification using a cyclic 
cell-penetrating peptide sequence (cRGD; Gly-Asp-Arg) 
to enhance the targeting of the drugs to GBM tumor 
cells. The research aimed to address the challenges asso-
ciated with current GBM treatments, such as poor drug 
permeability into the brain, and tumor metastasis. The 
optimized SLNs exhibited a particle size of 129 nm, a sur-
face charge of 23 mV, and drug loading efficiency exceed-
ing 7%. In  vitro drug release studies showed that over

70% of the drug was released within an 8 h period. Phar-
macokinetic evaluation in vivo demonstrated that there 
have been notable enhancements in drug absorption 
metrics in contrast to the free drug suspension. The study 
concluded that the targeted dual drug-loaded SLNs pro-
vided enhanced chemoprotective effects compared to the 
non-targeted SLNs, and plain drug solution [54]. Lute-
inizing-hormone-releasing-hormone (LHRH) receptors 
are excessively expressed in prostate cancer cells. One of 
the most obstacles for the treatment of cancer is the pres-
ence of various immune cells in the TME that can lead 
to the uptake and clearance of nanocarriers before they 
reach cancer cells, so strategies like surface modification 
with PEG to evade immune detection was reported. PEG 
conjugated lipids demonstrate enhanced retention, and 
circulation within biological systems. PEGylated dipalmi-
toylphosphatedylethanolamine (DPPE-PEG) was conju-
gated with new LHRH-receptor positive peptide analog. 
This novel peptide analog positive for LHRH receptors 
was utilized to target the delivery of DOX into pros-
tate cancer cells, a surface-modified SLNs loaded with 
DOX was formulated through a solvent emulsification/
evaporation technique. Modification of SLNs resulted 
in a homogeneous surface morphology, as confirmed by 
dynamic light scattering. Cellular uptake, and in  vitro 
efficacy against LHRH-positive PC3/SKBR3 prostate, 
and breast cancer cell lines, respectively indicated higher 
internalization, and cytotoxicity. Dye staining, and flow 
cytometry illustrated increased apoptosis in cancer cells. 
They concluded that these receptor-specific drug deliv-
ery systems hold significant potential for prostate cancer 
therapy [55]. One of the most promising aspects of using 
peptides for cancer cell targeting is their potential to be 
labeled with radioactive isotopes or fluorescent dyes. This 
capability allows for imaging and diagnostic purposes, 
aiding in the early detection and monitoring of tumors 
[20].
2.2.3  Polysaccharides ‑targeted SLNs
Coating nanocarriers with polysaccharides presents 
an opportunity to alter both the physical, and chemical 
characteristics as well as the targetability behavior of the 
SLNs [56]. Researches developed SLNs that have been 
modified on their surface with galactose, and contain the 
chemotherapy drug DOX [57]. The authors emphasize 
that the galactosylation of SLNs resulted in the creation 
of promising delivery vehicles, especially for targeted 
drug administration to enhance therapeutic efficacy. 
The galactosylated SLNs loaded with DOX exhibited 
increased cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, and localization 
within the cell nucleus when tested against A549 cells, 
suggesting their potential for enhancing DOX delivery in 
cancer treatment [57]. Furthermore, in another research 
SLNs were decorated with fucose for enhancing delivery 
of methotrexate. The results indicated that the fucose-
decorated SLNs exhibited improvement in the cytotoxic-
ity, and cellular uptake, with a lower ­IC50 of methotrexate 
in breast cancer cells, leading to increased apoptosis, and 
altered lysosomal membrane permeability. Also In  vivo 
assessments demonstrated maximal bioavailability, and 
tumor targeting efficiency, while minimizing second-
ary drug distribution in organs compared to free drug 
administration. The authors concluded that fucose-
decorated SLNs hold promise for developing targeted 
therapies for breast cancer [58]. Wang et al. [59] formu-
lated SLNs loaded with PTX (Zhejiang Hisun Pharma-
ceutical Co., Ltd (Zhejiang, China)) and decorated with 
HA and pluronic 85 (P85) to address drug resistance 
and enhance antitumor effectiveness in mice with cer-
vical and breast tumors. Results indicated that the HA 
decorated P85-PTX- SLNs had an average size of 160.3 
nm, an entrapment efficiency (EE) of 88.2%, and a drug 
loading capacity (LC) of 4.9%. The release of PTX from 
HA-PTX-P85- SLNs demonstrated a more prolonged 
and sustained profile compared to free PTX. Addition-
ally, biodistribution analysis showed higher concentra-
tions of the drug in tumors with HA decorated SLNs than 
with free PTX [59]. Additionally, in another study HA 
was tagged to SLNs, and loaded with docetaxel (DTX) 
to effectively target, and combat drug-resistant tumor 
cells. The particle sizes of the SLNs and HA-SLNs meas-
ured 109.5 ± 8.2 nm and 224.3 ± 15.9 nm, respectively. It 
was observed that HA-SLNs exhibited increased cellular 
uptake and cytotoxicity in MCF7/ADR cells compared 
to other cell types, indicating their ability to effectively 
target and address tumor resistance. Consequently, the 
researchers concluded that HA-SLNs represent a promis-
ing targeted drug delivery system for delivering DTX to 
overcome drug-resistant tumors [60].
2.2.4  Transferrin‑targeted SLNs
Transferrin-conjugated SLNs were successfully devel-
oped for enhancing the active targeting of anticancer 
drugs to cancer cells. Jain et al. [61] investigated effec-
tiveness of Tf-anchored SLNs loaded with DOX for 
specifically targeting brain cancer. The study aimed 
to overcome the challenge of delivering chemother-
apy agents across the blood-tumor barrier (BTB) by 
leveraging TfRs abundantly present on brain cancer 
cells. The modified SLNs had an average particle size 
of 210.3 nm. In  vitro experiments conducted on U87 
MG brain cancer cell lines demonstrated that the cyto-
toxicity of D- SLNs-T was significantly enhanced upon 
anchoring Tf to the nanocarriers, leading to increased 
cellular uptake of the drug. These findings suggest that 
D-SLNs-T holds promise for enhancing the treatment 
Page 11 of 21

of brain cancer by effectively targeting, and deliver-
ing DOX to cancerous cells [61]. SLNs loaded with 
Cur were bioconjugated with Tf using EDC as cou-
pling reagent to target prostate cancer cells, aim-
ing to enhance Cur’s clinical efficacy despite its poor 
bioavailability. The researchers aimed to improve the 
clinical effectiveness of Cur, which is limited by its 
poor bioavailability. The results showed that Tf-SLNs 
exhibited notably higher cellular uptake, and induced 
greater apoptotic effects compared to non-conjugated 
SLNs. In vivo models with prostate cancer showed that 
the use of Tf- SLNs led to significant tumor regres-
sion. These findings suggest that bioconjugated SLNs 
represent a promising strategy for targeted cancer 
therapy [62]. In breast cancer treatment, tamoxifen 
citrate was loaded in SLNs that conjugated with Tf in 
an attempt to improve the targeted delivery of tamox-
ifen citrate. The findings indicated that the developed 
formulations showed increased toxicity against MCF-7 
human breast cancer cells compared to pure tamoxifen 
citrate solution. Consequently, the study suggests that 
Tf-engineered nanocarriers hold potential for enhanc-
ing the therapeutic efficacy of nanomedicines in breast 
cancer treatment [63].
2.2.5  Antibody‑targeted SLNs
The creation of positively charged SLNs modified with 
specific mAbs targeted for the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) marked the initial advancement in uti-
lizing antibody-driven approaches with SLNs loaded with 
drugs for cancer treatment [64]. A research investigated 
the conjugation of SLNs with Death receptor-5 antibod-
ies (DR5 mAb) to deliver γ-secretase inhibitor effectively 
into cancer cells Fig.  2. The DR5 monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) was covalently attached through its amino ­(NH2) 
group to the exposed carboxylic (COOH) group of the 
Fig. 2  The process by which BCSCs contribute to the recurrence of tumors, their spread to other parts of the body, and their resistance 
to chemotherapy is explained. In the case of DAPT-DR5-SLNs, the way it works involves the DR5-mediated intake of DAPT. This intake stops 
γ-secretase activity, thus halting the splitting of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). Consequently, the shutdown of downstream Notch signaling 
inhibits various functions such as cell growth, blood vessel formation, resistance to cell death, and the ability of BCSCs to renew themselves 
by blocking the expression of genes targeted by Notch. In addition to its role in actively seeking out targets, DR5mAb triggers the extrinsic 
apoptotic pathway, potentially leading to improved reduction of tumors. Adapted with permission from ref. [65] copyright (2024) Elsevier

lipid in DAPT-SLNs, with EDC serving as the coupling 
agent for the covalent linkage. Results indicated that 
the targeted SLNs exhibited increased cytotoxicity in 
MDA-MB231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells 
compared to non-targeted SLNs [65]. In animal studies, 
targeted SLNs demonstrated superior tumor regression 
compared to non-targeted SLNs, indicating selective 
targeting of cancer cells, and enhanced anticancer effi-
cacy against TNBC cells [65]. In another research they 
focused on enhancing the delivery of the anticancer drug 
etoposide to treat GBM, by developing SLNs combined 
with melanotransferrin antibody (MA) and tamoxifen to 
traverse the blood–brain barrier. Etoposide-SLNs were 
preactivated with EDC and NHS and then conjugated 
with tamoxifen. Results indicated that a higher con-
centration of MA on the particle surface led to eleva-
tion in the permeability coefficient for etoposide across 
the blood–brain barrier, this study concluded that MA-
conjugated etoposide-loaded SLNs represent a promis-
ing approach for delivering pharmacotherapy for GBM 
[66]. Souto et al. [67] developed a new method of drug 
delivery for breast cancer treatment using SLNs modified 
on the surface with a antibody targeting human epithe-
lial growth receptor called CAB51. Scientists connected 
CAB51 to cationic SLNs to target breast cancer cells. The 
findings indicated that the antibody showed increased 
uptake in negative MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. At 
lower concentrations, the antibody- conjugated SLNs 
displayed a synergistic impact on cell viability, surpass-
ing the effects of SLNs or antibody alone. They concluded 
that these MA surface- modified SLNs have the potential 
to offer targeted delivery, thereby minimizing systemic 
side effects [67]. Table 3 demonstrates summary for sur-
face modified SLNs for cancer therapy.
2.3  Lipid‑polymer hybrid nanoparticles
The lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles is an innova-
tive formulation that merges polymeric nanoparticles, 
and liposomes, effectively overcoming the drawbacks 
associated with each component when used alone [68]. 
Liposomes, characterized by spherical vesicles compris-
ing a lipid bilayer membrane, offer the advantage of deliv-
ering both hydrophilic, and hydrophobic drugs. However, 
they encounter various limitations such as lipid peroxi-
dation, oxidation, hydrolysis of phospholipids, and unin-
tended leakage [69]. Conversely, polymeric nanocarriers 
demonstrate excellent controlled release capabilities in 
comparison with liposomes, and are recognized as a 
cost-efficient approach. Nonetheless, they suffer from the 
drawback of having a moderate circulation half-life [70].
2.3.1  Folic acid—targeted LPHNPs
Folic acid, a commonly utilized ligand, targets the FR 
present on different cancer cells. In their research, Gu 
et  al. [71] employed FA as a targeting tool, showcasing 
its effectiveness in directing delivery via folate modifica-
tion. Their investigation displayed distinct monodisper-
sity, and stability for indocyanine green (ICG) compared 
to free ICG, shielding ICG from degradation, and offer-
ing superior near-infrared (NIR) penetration during 
in  vitro experimentation [71]. Additionally, in  vivo tri-
als of β-amino ester-prepared nanocarriers for targeted 
delivery of docetaxel exhibited heightened intracellular 
uptake, and cytotoxicity Fig. 3. These particles, sized at 
100 nm with a narrow distribution, demonstrated supe-
rior tumor targeting ability in mice bearing tumors [72]. 
Tang and his colleagues fabricated FA-conjugated lipid-
coated chitosan/chondroitin sulfate (CT/CS) nanocar-
riers loaded with sorafenib, demonstrated significantly 
enhanced uptake by cancer cells compared to the non-
targeted nanocarriers. This heightened internalization 
was primarily due to its specific interaction with FR, 
which are overexpressed in liver cancer cells. FA targeted 
lipid polymer hybrid NPs displayed potent cytotoxicity 
across all tested concentrations, as evidenced by a nota-
bly lower ­IC50 value of 0.78 μg/mL compared to 3.92 μg/
mL. These findings underscore the promising potential 
of folate-conjugated LPHNPs for delivering antican-
cer drugs in liver cancer treatment [73]. Additionally, 
LPHNPs targeted with FA were loaded with gefitinib 
(GEF, European Pharmacopoeia Reference Standard) and 
yttrium-90 (Y90, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) [74]. FA-
targeted-LPHNPs, sized approximately 150 nm, showed 
increased accumulation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma 
cells and demonstrated superior cytotoxicity. In  vivo 
experiments revealed remarkable tumor inhibition with 
a tumor volume of 221.2 ± 13.5 mm [3] by day 21 post-
treatment, alongside minimal changes in body weight, 
indicating low systemic toxicity. These findings suggest 
that FA-GEF-Y90-LPHNPs could serve as a safe thera-
peutic system for nasopharyngeal Cancer treatment.
2.3.2  Peptides—targeted LPHNPs
Peptides employed for active targeting in different cancer 
types have demonstrated impressive efficacy in deliver-
ing anticancer drugs [75]. Research on RGD-targeted 
delivery has shown its exceptional targeting precision, 
and therapeutic impact across various in vivo investiga-
tions. One such study utilized docetaxel-loaded RGD-L-
P nanocarriers with a size of 110 nm, revealing enhanced 
targeting capability, and treatment effectiveness. In 
experiments on rats with GBM, administration of these 
nanocarriers led to a median survival duration of 57 days, 
highlighting their promising therapeutic potential [76].

Gao et al. [77] conducted a study using, a hybrid nano-
particle (NP) system to enhance the therapeutic efficacy 
of Isoliquiritigenin (ISL). Incorporating internalized Arg-
Gly-Asp (iRGD) peptides onto their surface using a post-
insertion approach resulted in the formation of ISL iRGD 
NPs. In comparison with free ISL, and non-iRGD modi-
fied counterparts, ISL-iRGD NPs exhibit elevated cyto-
toxicity, and induce greater levels of cell apoptosis across 
various breast cancer cell types. This enhanced effect is 
attributed to heightened cellular accumulation facili-
tated by iRGD-integrin recognition, and the nanoscale 
properties of the particles. Crucially, owing to the active 
tumor-targeting ability of iRGD peptides, and prolonged 
circulation in vivo, ISL-iRGD NPs demonstrate superior 
efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth in mouse models 
bearing 4T1 breast tumors [77]. Furthermore, research-
ers developed hybrid nanoparticles comprising a lipid 
shell and a polymer core (lpNPs) that loaded with Cur 
and were modified with RGD peptide. The optimized 
RGD-lpNPs, exhibited high entrapment efficiency, sub-
micron size, and a core–shell structure. Cytotoxicity 
demonstrated that Cur encapsulated within RGD–lpNPs 
maintained potent antitumor effects. Cellular uptake 
revealed increased uptake of Cur when encapsulated 
in RGD–lpNPs. Additionally, Cur-loaded RGD–lpNPs 
exhibited superior efficacy by impeding the growth of 
tumors in a subcutaneous B16 melanoma tumor model 
[78].
2.3.3  Polysaccharide—targeted LPHNPs
Shao et al. [79] created LPHNs with a core–shell config-
uration, loading DOX, and gallic acid together, and tar-
geted with HA. This strategy combined the biomimetic 
properties of lipids with the structural benefits of poly-
mer cores, resulting in an exceptional delivery system. 
The HA-modified LPHNs had dimensions approximately 
measuring 160 nm. Among these, the dual drugs loaded 
HA-modified LPHNs exhibited the highest cytotoxicity, 
with optimal synergy observed at a DOX/GA ratio of 2/1. 
In animal studies, the dual drugs loaded HA-modified 
LPHNs significantly reduced tumor volume from 956 
mm [3] to 213 mm [3], achieving a remarkable inhibition 
rate of 77.7% [79]. Furthermore, within the insertion of 
HA on the surface of the co-loaded LPNs incorporating 
irinotecan, and a gene, there was an observed improve-
ment in cytotoxic effects, resulting in heightened efficacy 
against SW480 cells. This enhancement was accompa-
nied by peak plasma concentrations of 41.31 ± 1.58 μg/
mL, and half-lives of 12.56 ± 0.67 h [80]. Additionally, in 
the realm of vaccine distribution, hybrid nanoparticles 
Fig. 3  A diagram illustrates the delivery process of FA/PBAE/DTX-NPs for medication transport. Tumor cells will take up FA/PBAE/DTX-NPs internally 
through FA-mediated endocytosis. Once the inclusion bodies are absorbed by tumor cells, the acidic conditions within the cells cause PBAE 
to become protonated, transitioning from hydrophobic to hydrophilic states. This alteration enables the nanocarrier to escape from lysosomes/
endosomes, and promptly release the drug. Adapted with permission from ref. [72] copyright (2024) Elsevier

comprising cationic lipid–poly(lactide-co-glycolide) acid 
(PLGA), adorned with HA, proved to be efficient convey-
ors. Interestingly, trials conducted within living organ-
isms showcased that vaccination using HA-targeted 
nanocarrier triggered notably stronger immune reactions 
when contrasted with cationic lipid-PLGA nanocar-
rier, and unbound ovalbumin. This method has emerged 
as a powerful framework for fostering potent immune 
responses [81].
2.3.4  Transferrin—targeted LPHNPs
Iron is crucial for the proliferation of cancer cells and 
can be efficiently transported to tumors via Tf, which 
is known to have heightened expression on numerous 
cancer cells. Many authors have therefore attached Tf 
to LPHNPs to enhance the targeted delivery of anti-
cancer agents to tumor cells. Alpha-mangostin was 
incorporated into an LPHNPs delivery system conju-
gated with Tf. The conjugation of Tf to the LPHNPs was 
done by utilizing the thiol–maleimide “click” reaction. 
The results demonstrated a sustained release of alpha-
mangostin following an initial burst release, contrasting 
with the rapid release observed with the drug solu-
tion. Decoration of alpha-mangostin-LPHNPs with TF 
enhanced its uptake by cancer cells, consequently aug-
menting its antiproliferative activity compared to the 
free drug solution. Moreover, it represents a promising 
therapeutic approach warranting further optimization 
as a cancer treatment modality [82]. Nevertheless, for 
enhancing targeting to non-small cell lung cancer, a 
protein- LPHNPs equipped with Tf was formulated to 
encapsulate both DTX, and cisplatin (CIS). The analysis 
revealed a particle size of approximately 189.5 ± 5.9 nm, 
with a surface charge measured at around − 16.9 ± 2.1 
mV. When compared with CIS/DTX-LN, which lacked 
Tf, and other singly loaded formulation, and free drugs, 
Tf-targeted LPHNPs demonstrated significantly supe-
rior efficacy against tumors both in laboratory cell 
studies, and in vivo [83].
2.3.5  Antibody—targeted LPHNPs
Antibodies have been employed to regulate the disper-
sion of functional nanoparticles toward specific tissues. 
Conjugating antibodies to nanoparticles enables precise 
cancer targeting. Yang et al. [84] employed a site-specific 
anticlaudin 3 (CLDN3) antibody conjugation to LPHNPs. 
The targeted LPHNPs showed high colloidal stabil-
ity, and xenograft mouse model resulted in remarkable 
tumor ablation compared to non-targeted LPHNPs. This 
study establishes a precise antibody-linking technique 
for enhancing breast cancer treatment. In an attempt 
to modulate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), LPHNPs 
loaded with adriamycin and linked to an anti-EGF recep-
tor antibody have been developed. For the conjugation 
of antibodies, the formulated system was coupled with 
thiolated anti-EGFR Fab´ to form LPHNPs anti-EGFR 
Fab´ conjugate. Anti-EGF-targeted LPHNPs demon-
strated markedly increased cellular cytotoxicity against 
HCC cells with elevated EGFR expression compared to 
non-targeted system. In  vivo results demonstrated that 
the accumulation of targeted LPHNPs was notably higher 
than that of non-targeted LPHNPs with high antitumor 
efficacy [85]. Table 4 demonstrates summary for surface 
modified LPHNPs for cancer therapy.
3  Summary
Different targeting agents exhibit distinct properties 
that make them suitable for specific applications. A sys-
tematic comparison facilitates the selection of the most 
suitable agent tailored to the specific requirements of a 
given application, such as targeted drug delivery to spe-
cific types of cancer [86, 87]. Table  5 provides a com-
prehensive overview, highlighting both advantages and 
disadvantages, thereby ensuring a balanced evaluation 
across different targeting agents. This approach promotes 
impartial assessment and aids in selecting the most 
appropriate agent for specific applications. Moreover, it 
identifies gaps in current knowledge and outlines oppor-
tunities for further research [53].
4  Conclusion
In conclusion, the review on targeted lipid-based nano-
carriers highlights their immense potential in revolu-
tionizing drug delivery systems. Through meticulous 
examination, it becomes evident that these nanocarri-
ers offer precise targeting, enhanced drug efficacy, and 
minimized adverse effects. Their ability to encapsu-
late therapeutic agents and navigate biological barriers 
underscores their significance in overcoming challenges 
associated with traditional drug delivery methods. Fur-
thermore, the versatility of lipid-based nanocarriers 
allows for customization to meet specific therapeutic 
needs, promising advancements in machine learning 
models that can analyze patient-specific data to design 
personalized lipid-based nanocarriers that cater to indi-
vidual therapeutic needs. This ensures that treatments 
are tailored to the unique genetic and molecular profiles 
of patients. As research in this field continues to evolve, 
targeted lipid-based nanocarriers are poised to play a piv-
otal role in shaping the future of health care by delivering 
treatments with unprecedented precision and efficacy.

5  Challenges and future prospective
Presently, targeted lipid-based nanocarriers present both 
challenges, and promising future prospects in drug deliv-
ery. Challenges include ensuring precise targeting to 
specific tissues or cells, overcoming biological barriers 
such as the reticuloendothelial system, and maintaining 
stability, and biocompatibility [88]. Additionally, issues 
related to scalability, and reproducibility need to be

addressed for widespread adoption. However, the future 
holds exciting potential for targeted lipid-based nanocar-
riers e.g. AI (Artificial Intelligence) can forecast the ideal 
composition and properties of lipid-based nanocarriers, 
such as size, charge, and encapsulation efficiency, based 
on experimental data. This facilitates the development 
of more potent compounds [89]. Advances in nano-
technology, and lipid chemistry offer opportunities to 
enhance targeting efficiency, improve payload delivery, 
and minimize off-target effects. Furthermore, the versa-
tility of lipid-based carriers allows for the incorporation 
of various therapeutic agents, including small molecules, 
nucleic acids, and proteins. In order to find possible 
medication candidates that can be encapsulated in lipid-
based nanocarriers, AI an emerging technology, may 
scan massive datasets. In doing so, the process of finding 
new drugs is sped up and compounds with the best char-
acteristics for creating nanocarriers are found [90]. Con-
tinued research and innovation in this field are poised to 
revolutionize drug delivery, offering tailored solutions for 
diverse medical challenges.
CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short pal-
indromic repeats) is one of the most exciting emerg-
ing technologies. It can also be used to alter the genetic 
expression of cells, enhancing their interaction with 
lipid-based nanocarriers and enhancing their uptake 
and therapeutic efficacy [91]. CRISPR technology offers 
a powerful tool for modifying genes that regulate recep-
tor expression or for creating new antibodies to enhance 
lipid nanocarrier surfaces. Using CRISPR/Cas9, research-
ers can accurately alter the genetic code that governs the 
production of cell surface receptors, thereby improving 
or modifying their expression to boost the targeting effi-
ciency of lipid nanocarriers. Furthermore, CRISPR can 
be employed to design cells that generate novel antibod-
ies with specific binding properties. These engineered 
antibodies can be attached to lipid nanocarriers, facili-
tating precise delivery of therapeutic agents to targeted 
cell types or tissues. This method supports the creation 
of highly tailored nanocarriers with enhanced target-
ing and therapeutic effectiveness [92]. In this context, 
personalized medicine involves customizing lipid nano-
carriers based on genetic, proteomic, and clinical data 
unique to each patient. By analyzing specific biomarkers 
and disease characteristics, researchers can modify the 
surface of lipid nanocarriers with targeted ligands, such 
as antibodies or peptides, that precisely interact with the 
patient’s unique cellular markers. This personalized tar-
geting improves the efficiency of drug delivery and mini-
mizes off-target effects, leading to more effective and 
safer treatments. The integration of personalized medi-
cine into lipid nanocarrier design ensures that therapies

are optimized for each patient’s individual needs and dis-
ease profile [93].
The examples highlighted in this review showcase the 
significant potential of surface modifications in these 
nanocarriers. However, there are a number of important 
issues that need to be addressed in subsequent studies. It 
has been observed that the efficiency of functionalization 
is influenced by the selection of ligand density, type, and 
excipients. Depending on the precise lipid surface chem-
istry required for the intended biomedical applications, 
choosing the right surface modification techniques for 
lipid-based nanocarriers is essential. For all lipid-based 
nanocarriers, there is not a single best coating method 
that can be applied to increase selectivity. To accurately 
characterize these functionalized carriers, lipid-based 
nanocarriers must be purified after surface functionaliza-
tion. Additionally, to demonstrate the safe and effective 
clinical application of fabricated surface-modified lipid-
based nanocarriers, toxicity issues must be investigated 
[86].
Due to their significant affinity for the negatively 
charged cell membrane, positively modified nanocarriers 
tend to accumulate excessively on the surface of the cell. 
In order to improve therapeutic efficacy, future options 
involve developing nanocarriers with the ideal size, 
shape, and charge density. Additionally, studies should 
concentrate on thoroughly analyzing the interactions 
between particular proteins and these nanocarriers uti-
lizing in vitro and in vivo models [94].
Targeting lipid nanocarriers presents several sig-
nificant regulatory challenges, particularly concerning 
complex safety assessments required to determine their 
toxicity, especially for those combining multiple ligands 
to achieve advanced multifunctionality. Additionally, 
scaling up the synthesis from laboratory scale to large-
scale manufacturing without compromising the quality 
and performance of the nanocarriers is a major hurdle. 
Ensuring batch-to-batch consistency and designing reli-
able clinical trials that meet regulatory standards for 
demonstrating safety and efficacy further complicate the 
development process [95]. However, with the advent of 
machine learning, it is now possible to identify patterns 
and connections by processing and analyzing large, com-
plex datasets from clinical and preclinical research. This 
technology helps in understanding the factors that influ-
ence the effectiveness and safety of lipid-based nanocar-
riers [96].
