Background: Trichoblastoma is a benign primitive follicular neoplasm that arises in the setting of Brooke-Spiegler syndrome 
(driven by pathogenic CYLD mutations), in association with nevus sebaceous (driven by mosaic RAS mutations), or sporadically, 
with so far poorly understood pathogenesis. We studied the histopathologic and molecular genetic features of 15 sporadic 
trichoblastic neoplasms including a rare case of trichogerminoma and a case of trichoblastic carcinoma arising within 
trichoblastoma. 
Design: Institutional archives at two institutions were searched for ‚Äútrichoblastoma/trichoblastic‚Äù. Tumors in the setting of Brooke-
Spiegler syndrome or arising within nevus sebaceous were excluded. Available slides and blocks were retrieved. Clinical data was 
extracted from the electronic medical record systems. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was performed on selected cases to assess for 
fusions, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and mutation signature (COSMIC). 
Results: Fifteen tumors occurred in 9 males and 7 females with a median age of 64 years (range: 33-97) and involved the scalp 
(4), nasolabial fold (1), cheek (1), parotid (1), nasal ala (1), ear (1), upper chest (1), back (1), gluteal region (1), thigh (1), leg (1) 
and ankle (1). The median size was 1.6 cm (range: 1.2-7.0 cm). Clinical follow-up (15 patients; 100%; median: 65 months; range: 
3-107 months) showed no evidence of disease at last follow-up. On histology, 13 tumors showed classic features of trichoblastoma, 
such as multinodular growth pattern, dermal location without epidermal connection, and surrounding fibrotic stroma. One case 
showed foci of increased atypia and mitotic activity, representing malignant transformation. One case demonstrated focal areas 
suggestive of ‚Äúcell balls‚Äù, previously described in a rare variant of trichoblastoma, so-called trichogerminoma. RNAseq (6 tumors) 
revealed highly variable TMB and mutation signature related to DNA base excision repair and mismatch repair defect in all 6 cases 
(Fig. 1A, B). A recurrent FOXK1::GRHL1 fusion was found in the case of trichogerminoma (2).

Conclusions: Herein, we report the histopathologic features of 15 cases of sporadic trichoblastic neoplasms. Among cases with 
gene expression profile, all tumors demonstrated consistent mutation signature associated with DNA repair defect and a case of 
trichogerminoma with FOXK1::GRHL1 fusion. These findings shed light on molecular tumorigenesis which could potentially be of 
use for diagnostic practice. Larger scale validation studies are needed.

Background: Follicular mucinosis is a rare dermatologic disorder characterized by the accumulation of mucin within hair follicles, 
resulting in distinct skin lesions. It can be associated with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), further complicating its clinical 
management and prognosis. 
Design: We identified 19 cases of follicular mucinosis from 2010 to 2023. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides were 
reviewed to evaluate morphological features, including the presence of mucin within hair follicles and the extent of lymphocytic 
infiltrate. Immunostains for colloidal iron, Alcian blue, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD20, Granzyme, and TIA were performed 
in a subset of cases. T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement analysis was performed to investigate clonality. 
Results: Patients aged 12 to 87 years (median age: 38), with 11 males (57.9%) and 8 females (42.1%), were included. Biopsies 
were obtained from various anatomical sites, with the back being the most sampled site (Table 1). All cases (100%) exhibited 
mucin accumulation within hair follicles, confirming follicular mucinosis by H&E staining. Immunostains were evaluated to rule out 
lymphoma, with additional staining (colloidal iron and Alcain blue) supporting mucin deposition. Two cases (10.5%) were 
associated with mycosis fungoides, and four cases (21.1%) were associated with atypical lymphoid proliferation.  In the majority of 
cases (16/19, 84.2%), epidermotropism was not present. However, prominent epidermotropism occurred in 1/2 cases (50%) of 
mycosis fungoides and 1/4 cases (25%) of atypical lymphoid proliferation. Additionally, minimal epidermotropism was noted in one 
case (5.3%) of atypical lymphoid proliferation. TCR gene rearrangement analysis in 17 cases (89.5%) showed clonality in 9 cases 
(52.9%).

Conclusions: The abstract offers a detailed clinicopathologic and molecular analysis of 19 cases of follicular mucinosis, with a 
particular focus on its association with CTCL, the utilization of immunohistochemistry, and molecular analysis. In cases of atypical 
lymphoid proliferation, TCR gene rearrangement analysis was positive. However, there was insufficient morphological evidence to 
make a diagnosis of lymphoma in the current biopsies. Therefore, close follow-up was recommended. Some follicular mucinosis 
cases may exhibit clonal TCR gene rearrangements without T-cell lymphoma evidence‚Äîreferred to as pseudo-clonality or benign 
clonality. Distinguishing between true clonality and pseudo-clonality can be challenging.

Background: ALK rearrangements occur in an emerging family of kinase fusion-positive mesenchymal neoplasms, including 
epithelioid fibrous histiocytoma (FH) and the recently described superficial ALK-rearranged myxoid spindle cell neoplasm 
(ALKSCN). Here we expand upon the histopathologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular spectrum of ALKSCN. 
Design: Retrospective searches identified 32 cases from consultation and departmental archives. Patient demographics, tumor 
characteristics, and clinical outcome were ascertained when obtainable. Seventeen tumors were successfully sequenced using 
next-generation sequencing platforms (12 DNAseq, 5 RNAseq). 
Results: The cohort consisted of 17 females (53%) and 15 males, with a median age at presentation of 40 years (range: 6‚Äì82 yr). 
Most tumors occurred on the lower extremity (23 tumors; 72%), followed by upper extremity (4; 13%), trunk (3; 9%), and face (2; 
6%). Tumors occurred primarily in the dermis (28 tumors; 88%) or subcutis (4; 13%); ten dermal tumors extended into the subcutis. 
Median tumor size was 1.2 cm (range: 0.5‚Äì7.0 cm). Histologically, tumors were characterized by bland spindle to ovoid cells 
showing whorled growth and myxoid to collagenous stroma. Recurrent features included perivascular hyalinization (19 tumors; 
59%), epidermal collarette (16; 50%), amianthoid collagen (12; 38%), and bone formation (2; 6%). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
demonstrated expression of ALK (23/28), EMA (16/26), CD34 (14/19), and S-100 (11/31). Eleven tumors showed hybrid features 
between epithelioid FH and ALKSCN; most of these showed cytomorphology typical of epithelioid FH, but with whorled growth, 
myxoid stroma, and/or spindle cell features. Two hybrid tumors showed sharp transitions from a region of epithelioid FH to a region 
of ALKSCN, with a concomitant sharp transition in EMA, CD34, and S-100 expression. Sequencing revealed ALK fusions in 15/17 
tumors: two each with fusion partners FLNA, SQSTM1, and VCL, and one each with COL1A2, DCTN1, EML4, FXR1, 
MPRIP, PLEKHH2, PRKAR1A, SPECC1L, and TLN2. Thirteen of 14 ALK-rearranged tumors expressed ALK by IHC. Two tumors 
negative for ALK fusions instead harbored RET fusions (NCOA4::RET and TRIM27::RET). RET-rearranged tumors were negative 
for ALK IHC. CDKN2A/B deletions were found in two tumors with ALK fusions and both tumors with RET fusions. 
Conclusions: ALKSCN is on a morphologic and molecular genetic spectrum with epithelioid FH, and some morphologically typical 
examples harbor alternate RET fusions. 
 
414    Clinicopathologic and Molecular Characterization of Sun-Protected Basal Cell Carcinoma

Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 
Disclosures: Elizabeth Draper: None; Yvonne Li: None; Alvaro Laga: None; John Hanna: None; Eleanor Russell-Goldman: None 
Background: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common skin cancer, is driven by UV-mediated Sonic Hedgehog (Hh) 
pathway mutations, most often involving PTCH1. Rarely, BCC can occur at sun-protected sites (i.e. genital and perianal BCC). This 
raises consideration of an alternative mechanism of pathogenesis in sun-protected BCC (SP-BCC). Here we use a next generation 
DNA sequencing (NGS) platform to compare the molecular pathogenesis of SP-BCC to conventional BCC, and we also describe 
the clinicopathologic features of SP-BCC. 
Design: We retrospectively identified 14 candidate SP-BCC cases. NGS was performed using a platform including the complete 
exonic DNA sequences of 447 cancer-related genes and 191 intronic regions across 60 genes to detect structural rearrangements 
and copy number variations. We also identified 8 conventional BCC with existing NGS data for comparison. Of note, Hh pathway 
genes including PTCH1, SUFU and SMO are included in this platform. In addition, we detail the clinicopathologic features of SP-BCC. 
Results: The clinicopathologic and genomic findings of SP-BCC are summarized in Table 1. A single patient (case 1) had a remote 
history of cobalt radiation to the anal area with subsequent development of a SP-BCC. For conventional BCC, tumor sites included 
metastatic site (n=3), trunk (n=3), and head/neck (n=2). None of the SP-BCC harbored a UV mutation signature, in contrast to all 
 
 
 
 
S514 
conventional BCC cases. Thirteen SP-BCC cases had PTCH1 genomic alterations (13/14, 93%), and a subset harbored recurrent 
PTPN14 genomic alterations (4/14, 29%). All conventional BCC cases had PTCH1 alterations (8/8, 100%), but none had PTPN14 
alterations (0/8, 0%). Management of SP-BCC included Mohs surgery (4/14; 29%); surgical excision (8/14; 57%); surgical excision 
and sentinel node biopsy (1/14; 7%) and no treatment (1/14; 7%). Recurrence was seen in 4/14 (29%) of SP-BCC cases, with a 
median follow-up of 18 months (range: 6 months to 9 years).

Conclusions: We describe recurrent Hh pathway alterations in SP-BCC, namely in the PTCH1 gene, supporting their classification 
in the BCC family. All SP-BCC lacked evidence of a UV mutation signature, suggesting an alternative mechanism of mutagenesis 
in these tumors. SP-BCC appeared to be enriched for PTPN14 alterations, although PTPN14 alterations are described in the 
literature in BCC. SP-BCC can be locally aggressive tumors. Notably, the presence of PTCH1 mutations in SP-BCC confirms their 
susceptibility to Hh pathway inhibitors such as vismodegib.

Background: Melanoma was one of the earliest tumors considered for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy given its highly 
immunogenic nature. The presence of an inflamed tumor microenvironment correlates with response to therapy. Previously 
proposed grading methods for TILs were semi-quantitative and somewhat subjective. Our aim was to utilize artificial intelligence 
(AI) in developing a deep learning-based model to identify and quantify TILs in melanoma. 
Design: Whole slide images (WSI) in the TCGA melanoma databased were reviewed, and 57 cases of primary tumor with optimal 
tissue quality were selected. Digitized images were then uploaded to Aiforia cloud-based image analysis platform (Aiforia Inc., 
Cambridge, MA, USA). The training set included 20 representative images and a layer tree was assembled in a hierarchical fashion 
(Figure 1) to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize 9 region or object feature layers. Hand-drawn annotations 
constituted the learning input and training was done in 6 consecutive cycles with gradually increasing iterations and additional 
annotations based on feedback from the verification and analysis results. Training region covered 863.55 mm2 and 5650 objects 
(5220 tumor cells and TILs and 430 stromal infiltrating lymphocytes/SILs). Finally, adequate performance was achieved, and image 
analysis was run on the entire dataset. 
Results: Model performance metrics in training regions was generated for each layer/class using the verification tool. The overall 
accuracy (F1 score) for both tumor cells and lymphocytes was 98.63%, with total error of 2.7% (141/5220). F1 score for the tumor, 
stroma and lymphoid aggregate sublayer was 95.95% (total error 5.78%, 2.13/36.84 mm2) (table 1). The mean TIL counts/tumor 
area was 391.85 (17.93-1475.38 range and SD ¬± 345.00) while the mean tumor cell count/tumor area was 3809.57 (770.32-
6242.02 range and SD ¬± 1071.87). None of the normalized tumor cell counts or TILs counts were significantly correlated with 
survival or tumor mutational burden (data not shown).

Conclusions: TIL density in melanoma shows wide variability, which may form the basis for differences in response to ICI. 
Attempts at precise manual quantification are rather impractical, which makes AI models more time efficient quantification 
tools. Application of AI-powered models can help establish novel grading criteria. As our current metrics did not correlate with 
survival or TMB, we plan to apply a more sophisticated analysis of TILs and lymphoid aggregates.

Disclosures: Robert Emerson: None; Thomas Davis: None; Justin Lemke: None; Eshwar Udho: None 
Background: Emerging evidence indicates that microsatellite instability (MSI) may be associated with Lynch Syndrome across 
cancer types, not just in colorectal carcinoma and endometrial carcinoma. Interest in detection of MSI in tumors other than 
 
 
 
 
S517 
colorectal and endometrial carcinoma is increasing as immunotherapeutic approaches are being developed for MSI-high (MSI-H) 
tumors of diverse types. The goal of this research study is to validate a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method of 
detecting microsatellite instability in cutaneous tumors through comparison with immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of mismatch 
repair (MMR) proteins.     
Design: We identified tumor specimens from adult patients including 17 Merkel cell carcinomas, 27 sebaceous carcinomas, 30 
melanomas, and 29 vulvar squamous cell carcinomas. Specimens with an adequate tumor block (greater than 20% tumor) and a 
normal tissue block were included. Paraffin curls of tumor and normal tissue for each specimen were analyzed using the Applied 
Biosystems 3500 Dx Genetic Analyzer using the OncoMate¬Æ MSI Dx Analysis System and determined to be MSI-H or microsatellite 
stable (MSS) with an investigational data interpretation software currently under development at Promega. For tumors that had not 
been evaluated previously by MMR, sections of tumor were stained for MMR-associated proteins. If at least one MMR marker 
showed loss of expression, the case was considered to show MMR loss.   
Results: Of the 103 samples, 88 (85%) could be evaluated for MSI by PCR and in 15 the results were considered invalid. Of these, 
87 cases had sufficient material for MMR staining and 1 did not. The MSI results correlated with MMR IHC results in 82 cases 
(94%) and did not correlate in 5 cases (6%). There were 14 correlating MSI-H/MMR-loss cases, 68 correlating MSS/MMR-retained 
cases, and 5 non-correlating MSS/MMR-loss cases. There were no non-correlating MSI-H/MMR-retained cases. MSI-H was 
identified in 1 of 13 Merkel cell carcinomas (8%), 13 of 26 sebaceous carcinomas (50%), 0 of 23 melanomas, and 0 of 26 vulvar 
squamous cell carcinomas.  
Conclusions: PCR analysis using the Promega OncoMate¬Æ MSI Dx Analysis System with an investigational data interpretation 
software correlates with evaluation of MMR expression by IHC in 94% of cases, among the tumor types evaluated. MSI-high results 
reliably (100% in this sample) predict loss of MMR protein IHC staining, but occasional cases yield MSS results while having MMR 
loss by IHC. 
 
417    The Microenvironment in Transformed Mycosis Fungoides: Potential Prognostic Factors and 
Therapeutic Targets

Disclosures: Anna Sarah Erem: None; Ishaq Asghar: None; Pamela Allen: None; Saja Asakrah: None 
Background: Mycosis fungoides (MF) with large cell transformation leads to poor survival. Prognostic factors include CD30 
negativity, stage IIb-IV, and folliculotropic variant. Despite advances in targeted immunotherapy, MF remains incurable, particularly 
in advanced stages. Research on tumor microenvironment (TME) reveals mechanisms behind immune dysregulation. This study 
delves into the MF‚Äôs immune microenvironment to uncover disease pathogenesis and potential treatment avenues. 
Design: We reviewed Epic patient charts diagnosed with mycosis fungoides. Factors like large cell percentage, CD30, and disease 
stage at biopsy were examined. RNA extracted from tissues underwent analysis with the nCounter pan-cancer immune profiling 
panel, processed by ROSALIND¬Æ with QC measures. Data was normalized using Nanostring criteria. 
Results: 31 patients with MF were identified. Large cell transformation was seen in 14 patients. Two cases lacked staging 
information. 17 cases didn‚Äôt show significant large cell transformation (large cells <5%-10%). 71% transformed MF cases had CD30 
immunostaining ‚â• 10%, and 57% were in advanced stages. In non-transformed cases, 18% had CD30 > 10% and 33% were in 
advanced stages. Genomic analysis revealed overexpression of NKG2 family genes (KLRC1, KLRC2, KLRK1) with significant p 
values. T-reg and Foxp3 genes were less expressed in transformed cases, while CD164 showed overexpression.

Conclusions: NKG2A, found on natural killer cells and T-cells, inhibits NK cell activity. Monalizumab, an antibody targeting 
CD94/NKG2A, shows promise in solid tumors and lymphomas but is unexplored in MF. Our findings suggest potential benefits of 
Monalizumab in transformed MF. Fewer T-regulatory cells with Foxp3 expression in transformed MF indicates their role in 
suppressing neoplastic T-cell progression. CD164 impacts hematopoietic progenitor cell functions, and its high expression links to 
Sezary syndrome. This study noted raised CD164 expression in transformed cases, hinting at poor prognosis. However, our 
study‚Äôs small sample size necessitates further large-scale research.

Background: Eccrine porocarcinoma (EPC) is a rare, cutaneous adnexal neoplasm with a reported rate of 20-30% metastasis to 
lymph nodes. EPC may arise de novo or in association with a poroma. Differentiating EPC from other cutaneous epithelial 
neoplasms, including other malignant adnexal tumors, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (pdSCC), and metastatic 
carcinoma, can be challenging. Molecular advances have found YAP1::NUTM1 fusions are more common in EPCs 
and YAP1::MAML2 in poromas. 
Design: Evaluate the utility of YAP1 C-terminus, YAP1 N-terminus and NUT immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue microarray 
samples of cutaneous neoplasms. A search of our pathology database identified 13 EPCs (9 arising in association with a poroma), 
24 poromas, 15 pdSCCs, 7 hidradenocarcinomas, and 9 sebaceous carcinomas (SC). Furthermore, we evaluated the utility of IHC 
for c-KIT, CEA, EMA, p40 and PRAME in EPCs and other cutaneous neoplasms. 
Results: Seven of 13 (54%) EPCs had a complete loss of YAP1-C expression, of which 6 (46%) demonstrated strong nuclear NUT 
positivity, confirming the YAP1::NUTM1 fusion. One case (8%) with loss of YAP1-C had no NUT expression, consistent with YAP1 
fusion with a non-NUT partner. One (8%) EPC showed YAP1-C retention with NUT positivity, suggesting a NUT fusion with a 
different partner. All YAP1 fusion associated EPCs rose in association with a poroma. The majority of poromas (71%) had loss of 
YAP1 without NUT expression, consistent with YAP1 fusion with a different partner. Four of 24 (17%) poromas had loss of YAP1-C 
and NUT positivity. One of 13 EPC patients (8%) had local recurrence with lymph node metastasis, while 3 (23%) passed away. 
None of those patients had YAP1 or NUT fusion. All pdSCCs, hidradenocarcinomas and SCs were NUT negative with strong 
YAP1-C expression. YAP1 N-terminus was positive in all tumors. C-KIT was positive in 71% EPCs, while only 20% pdSCCs were 
focally positive. C-KIT was negative in all other tumors. PRAME was only positive in all SCs.

Conclusions: The combination of YAP1 C-terminus and NUT IHC demonstrates diagnostic utility for tumors of poroid origin, including 
EPC. The presence of pre-existing poroma in all EPCs with YAP1::NUTM1 fusion suggests increased risk of developing EPC from 
poromas with this fusion. Other YAP-associated fusions have a lower risk of transformation. In clinical follow up, EPCs lacking YAP 
or NUT fusions showed more aggressive behavior. 
 
419    Unique Genomic Alterations Characterize Undifferentiated Melanoma

Disclosures: Grant Fischer: None; Navin Mahadevan: None; Jason Hornick: None; Christopher Fletcher: None; Eleanor Russell-
Goldman: None 
Background: Undifferentiated melanoma (UM) is defined as melanoma which has lost phenotypic and immunohistochemical 
features of conventional melanoma (CM). A subset of UM harbor BRAF or NRAS mutations, yet there is a paucity of data 
describing alterations unique to UM. We directly compare the molecular profiles of UM to CM to provide novel insights into UM-
specific pathogenesis. 
Design: This retrospective study included 10 UMs, selected based on exclusion of alternative diagnoses, the presence of 
melanoma-associated drivers and a history of melanoma in a subset of cases. Available sequencing data of 119 CMs was 
compared. Targeted sequencing of 447 cancer-associated genes was performed, including identification of mutations and somatic 
copy number alterations (CNAs). Variants classified as ‚ÄúTiers 1-3‚Äù (Joint Consensus Guidelines) were included in downstream 
analyses along with ‚ÄúTier 4‚Äù variants predicted to be pathogenic by the Cancer Genome Interpreter workspace. Statistical analyses 
were performed in R (v4.3.1) and SPSS (v29.0). The clinicopathologic features of the UM cohort are also described. 
Results: The clinicopathologic features of the UM cohort are described in Table 1. Recurrent pathogenic variants and the most 
recurrent CNAs are shown in Fig. 1 & 2. NRAS was the most frequent driver in UM. Compared to CMs, UMs demonstrated 
nominally significant enrichment of pathogenic variants in RAC1 (OR=19.1, p<0.001), TP53 (OR=5.5, p<0.05), 
and NRAS (OR=3.931, p<0.05). RAC1 remained statistically significant after multiple hypothesis testing correction on univariable 
analysis (FDR q-val<0.05) and after correcting for patient age and primary/metastatic status of samples in a multivariable model 
(OR=20.4, p<0.001). UMs also showed statistically significant (FDR q-val<0.05) enrichment of low-level gains in WWTR1 and 
heterozygous deletions of FOXO1, FIP1L1, and FAM175A.

Conclusions: We show that UMs harbor distinct genomic aberrations including enrichment of non-Q61R NRAS mutations. This 
has important diagnostic implications as NRASQ61R immunohistochemistry, often critical for the diagnosis of UM, is negative in 
these cases. The presence of recurrent and potentially targetable RAC1 mutations in UM is a notable finding with both diagnostic 
and therapeutic implications. Furthermore, RAC1 P29S mutations have been shown to drive a melanocytic to mesenchymal switch 
in melanocytes, offering a possible explanation for the undifferentiated phenotype of these melanomas.

420    CD140b (PDGF Receptor beta) is a Sensitive and Potentially Useful Marker for Atypical 
Fibroxanthoma/Pleomorphic Dermal Sarcoma 
Tayler Gant1, Wonwoo Shon1 
1Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 
Disclosures: Tayler Gant: None; Wonwoo Shon: None 
Background: Atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) and pleomorphic dermal sarcoma (PDS) are closely related tumors, believed to 
represent a continuum of the same neoplastic process, sharing numerous clinical features as well as morphological, 
immunohistochemical, and genetic characteristics. Because AFX/PDS often remains a diagnosis of exclusion, there has been 
considerable interest in identifying diagnostic markers that offer specificity for AFX/PDS or are pertinent to this differential 
diagnosis.  Recently, whole-exome sequencing analysis revealed high-level PDGFRA/B gene expression and suggested PDGFRB 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a "lineage specific" marker for PDS. To evaluate the potential diagnostic utility of PDGFRB status, 
we examined CD140b (PDGFRB) protein expression in a well-characterized cohort of AFX, PDS, and morphologic mimics.  
Design: Clinical information and details regarding each patient‚Äôs diagnosis were collected. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 
sections from 15 AFX, 5 PDS, 21 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) (8 sarcomatoid, 8 poorly differentiated, and 5 moderately 
differentiated), 29 melanomas (5 desmoplastic and 24 non-desmoplastic), and 6 cutaneous leiomyosarcomas were retrieved.  An 
automated IHC system (Ventana BenchMark XT) was used for the detection of CD140b, using a commercially available antibody 
(RM303, 1:2000, RevMAb Biosciences). Cases were independently reviewed and scored as negative (<5%), 1+ (5%-25%), 2+ 
(26%-50%), or 3+ (>50%). 
Results: The results of CD140b IHC are summarized in Table 1. All AFX and PDS were diffusely positive (20/20).  CD140b IHC 
showed a variable extent of staining in 4/21 SCC (4/8 sarcomatoid and 0/13 poorly/moderately differentiated SCC) and 9 of 29 
melanomas (5/5 desmoplastic and 4/24 non-desmoplastic).  1+ positivity was observed in 2/6 cutaneous leiomyosarcomas. In 
some cases, non-lesional fibroblastic stromal cells and intra-tumoral vessels exhibited diffuse CD140b reactivity, complicating the 
interpretative analysis.

Conclusions: In a practical sense, although CD140b may not be truly lineage specific, it does show utility as a diagnostic marker 
of AFX and PDS. Notably, CD140b expression also correlates with desmoplastic component in melanoma and is expressed in a 
subset of sarcomatoid SCC. Several targeted drugs have shown efficacy in PDGFR-expressing tumors, and our findings further 
delineate therapeutic strategies for a selected group of cutaneous sarcomatoid neoplasms.

Background: Cutaneous vasculitis with IgA deposition (cIgAV) is most closely associated with Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP, 
currently termed systemic IgA vasculitis). This syndrome classically presents as abdominal pain, joint pain, IgA nephropathy, and/or 
skin lesions in a child, sometimes after an upper respiratory infection.  There is a growing literature on IgA-dominant infection-
related glomerulonephritis (IGRN) in older adults, particularly related to Staphylococcus infections in diabetic adults. In analogy, we 
aimed to study the frequency of cIgAV, as well as the types of infections, pathogenic organisms, clinical presentations, and direct 
immunofluorescence (DIF) characteristics associated with these cases.  
Design: We searched our pathology database for direct immunofluorescence-detected vascular-perivascular IgA deposits present 
on skin biopsy at our institution from 2017-2022. Patients older than 18 years of age with accessible electronic medical records 
were eligible for inclusion. Retrospective chart review for demographic information, clinical presentation descriptions, laboratory 
data, and pathology reports was performed. 
Results: In our cohort of 43 patients, dermatologists consistently described the skin lesions as non-blanching and erythematous 
macules, papules, or petechiae with involvement of the lower extremities in all 43 patients. Seventeen patients (43%) were found to 
have a bacterial or fungal infection within 6 months of their initial diagnosis of cIgAV. Diabetes was infrequent in the cohort (18.6%) 
but was nearly five times more common in those with infection (35.3 vs 7.7%). Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently 
implicated pathogen (23.5%) and skin and soft tissue infections were most commonly reported (41.2% of those with one infection, 
up to 53% considering multiple infections). DIF demonstrated that patients with infections tended to have higher intensity IgA, C3, 
and fibrinogen deposition.

Conclusions: In our experience, a significant fraction (43%) of adult cutaneous IgA vasculitis cases are associated with bacterial 
or fungal infections. As reported with IGRN, S. aureus was a frequently implicated pathogen. The association of cIgAV with not only 
Henoch-Schonlein Purpura but also infection is of critical importance to recognize, as the treatment differs. Pathologists and 
clinicians should carefully rule out infection before administering immunosuppression for IgA vasculitis.

Background: Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) show 
clinicopathological overlapping presentations, which makes them challenging to differentiate on a small skin biopsy.  NPM1 
mutations are the most common genetic lesions in AML, accounting for one third of cases and cause an aberrant cytoplasmic 
delocalization of NPM1 protein mutants, which can be detected by an immunohistochemical stain (IHC). The frequency of NPM1 
mutations in BPDCN remains controversial, but different studies showed frequencies of 15-29% in MS patients [1]. We aimed to 
investigate BPDCN cases for NPM1 mutations and compare them with cutaneous NPM1 positive leukemia cutis cases. 
Design: Aim: To show that the cytoplasmic expression of nucleophosmin by immunohistochemistry can be used to differentiate 
between BPDCN and cutaneous NPM1 positive myeloid sarcoma. Methods: From a multi-institutional search, we identified and 
analyzed a total of 8 cases of cutaneous BPDCN and 19 cases of NPM1-mutated cutaneous myeloid sarcoma (7 of which 
were primary leukemia cutis). The IHC antibody detects A, B, and D subtypes of NPM1 mutations that account for ~90% of 
mutation subtypes. We compared the clinical and pathological findings of these patients and identified distinguishing features 
between these groups.   
Results: Results: BPDCN patients presented at an older age, had lower WBC, higher hemoglobin level, and higher platelets 
counts than cutaneous myeloid sarcoma patients (p <0.05; Table 1). The bone marrow of patients in both groups was similarly 
involved at the time of diagnosis with no significant difference; however, the percentage of involvement was significantly different 
among the two groups (Table 1). Overall and event-free survival rates were not significantly different among the two groups. Next-
generation sequencing profile differed among the two groups, with a significant enrichment of NPM1 in cutaneous myeloid 
sarcoma, while no NPM1 mutation was detected by NGS or immunohistochemistry (IHC) in BPDCN cases.

Conclusions: We find that BPDCN patients present similarly to cutaneous AML patients, but lack NPM1 mutations.  NPM1 
immunohistochemical stain can be useful in the differential diagnosis of BPDCN and cutaneous myeloid sarcoma, as its abnormal 
expression appears to exclude BPDCN in a rapid and cost-effective manner.

Background: Anorectal melanoma (AM) is a rare, aggressive melanoma with a 5 year survival rate of 14-30% and a distinct 
genetic profile. There is no standard staging system and limited consensus on optimal treatment. Immune checkpoint inhibitors 
 
 
 
 
S527 
have shown a significant survival advantage in patients with stage IV melanomas, however limited AM cases were studied. 
Additional research is imperative to elucidate molecular pathways and find predictive biomarkers and pinpoint therapeutic targets. 
Design: After IRB approval, 30 patients with primary AM were identified by pathology database review over a period of 33 years 
and their clinicopathologic, molecular, and survival information was evaluated.  
Results: The median patient age was 69 years (range: 32-91) with a M:F ratio of 1:1.5. Tumor distribution included 18 rectal, 9 
anal, and 3 anorectal cases, with an average tumor size of 15.6 mm (range: 1.35-58 mm). Of 20 patients with reported race, 84.2% 
were Caucasian, 5.3% Hispanic, 5.3% African American, and 5.3% Arabic. The most common presenting symptoms were rectal 
bleeding, anorectal mass, and weight loss. Next generation sequencing (NGS) with a 50-gene panel was performed on 7 (23.3%) 
patients, revealing alterations in KIT (4 pts), NRAS (2 pts), and SF3B1 (1 pt) (Table 1). Two patients had CDKN2A loss. 
Interestingly, mutations involving BRAF or NF1 genes were absent. While KIT, SF3B1, and NRAS mutations have been reported, 
to our knowledge these are the first reports of CDKN2A loss in AM. CDKN2A inactivation has previously shown to increase 
sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors in melanoma cell lines, suggesting potential therapeutic significance. Of 24 patients with follow-up, 5 
(21%) developed regional metastasis and 16 (67%) distant metastases including lung (n=2; M1b), viscera (n=11; M1c), and brain 
(n=3; M1d), according to AJCC 8th‚Äâedition cutaneous melanoma staging system. 12 (50%) patients died, 10 (42%) were alive with 
disease, and 2 (8%) were disease free at last follow-up (median follow-up 22.5 mo).‚ÄâThe 5-year survival rate was 28.6%. However, 
cases in which NGS was done in our study had a 0% 5-year survival. Two patients with identical NRAS alterations had divergent 
outcomes: One underwent treatment with local excision, radiation, and nivolumab and survived 20 mo, while the other went 
untreated and only survived for 58 days.

424    STAT6 Expression in Sebaceous Neoplasms and Mimickers 
Haya Homsi1, Jennifer Ko1, Steven Billings1, Shira Ronen1 
1Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 
Disclosures: Haya Homsi: None; Jennifer Ko: None; Steven Billings: None; Shira Ronen: None 
Background: STAT6 is a transcription factor that belongs to the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family with 
a critical role in cellular proliferation. It is a highly sensitive and specific immunohistochemical nuclear marker for solitary fibrous 
tumor. Recently, we noticed cytoplasmic staining with a vesicular pattern for STAT6 in sebaceous glands of normal skin. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate STAT6 staining patterns in various sebaceous neoplasms and mimickers. 
Design: We examined STAT6 expression in various sebaceous lesions, including 9 sebaceous adenomas, 4 sebaceomas, and 18 
sebaceous carcinomas, and their cutaneous mimickers, including 5 trichilemmomas, 9 hidradenomas, 6 squamous cell carcinomas 
(SCC), 7 basal cell carcinomas (BCC), 5 metastatic renal cell carcinomas (RCC), and 8 Merkel cell carcinomas (MCC).   
Results: STAT6 was expressed in 9/9 (100%) sebaceous adenomas, 4/4 (100%) sebaceomas, 18/18 (100%) sebaceous 
carcinomas, 2/9 hidradenomas, 5/5 (100%) metastatic RCC, and 6/8 (75%) MCC.  The staining pattern observed in the sebaceous 
neoplasms showed a distinctive cytoplasmic and membranous vesicular (small vesicles) pattern. The hidradenomas and MCC 
mostly exhibited granular cytoplasmic staining. The surrounding normal tissue was negative. STAT6 expression was not seen 
in trichilemmomas, SCC, and BCC. 
Figure 1 - 424 
 
Figure 2 - 424 
 
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that use of STAT6 can be helpful for identifying intracytoplasmic lipids, as seen in sebaceous 
neoplasms and renal cell carcinomas, thereby offering diagnostic utility for identifying sebaceous differentiation in primary skin 
tumors. Notably, the expression pattern of STAT6 was akin to the pattern of adipophilin stain, and differs significantly from that of 
MCC and hidradenomas, which exhibit granular staining, as opposed to intracytoplasmic small vesicles seen in sebaceous 
neoplasms. The broader application of STAT6 as a marker for sebaceous lesions necessitates further validation through 
comprehensive and larger-scale studies.

425    The Clinicopathological and Prognostic Features of Promoter Mutation, Rs2853669 
Polymorphism and Methylation within the TERT Gene in Chinese Melanoma Patients

University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China 
Disclosures: Jue Hu: None; Xu Cai: None; Yunyi Kong: None 
Background: Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene promoter mutations in Chinese melanoma patients remained to be 
studied. The status of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site rs2853669 and methylation level of TERT promoter in Chinese 
melanoma patients were also not unveiled. 
Design: Sanger sequencing was used to detect the mutation of TERT gene promoter region, the status of rs2853669 and the 
BRAF hotspot mutation in 93 cases of primary melanoma. Pyrosequencing was used to detect the methylation level of 5 CpG sites, 
located in upstream of transcription start site (UTSS region) of TERT gene, in primary tumor tissues of 15 melanoma patients as 
well as their paired normal skin and subsequent metastatic tissues. 
Results: Ninety-three cases of patients with primary melanoma were all Chinese, including 47 males and 46 females. The ages of 
patients ranged from 26 to 87 years old. 25(26.9%) cases had TERT promoter mutations. 9(36.0%) of them were -124bp C>T 
mutations, 3(12.0%) were -138/139bp CC>TT mutations, and 13(52.0%) were -146bp C>T mutations. These three mutation types 
did not coexist. 66(71.0%) cases were found to be SNP rs2853669 carriers. TERT promoter mutation was mainly found in non-
acral cutaneous melanoma, the mutation frequency of which was 43.5% (20/43). But it less frequently mutated in acral lentiginous 
melanoma and mucosal melanoma (5/47, 10.6%) (P<0.01) (Table). BRAF and TERT mutations had tendency to coexist(P<0.01) 
(Table). In non-acral cutaneous melanoma, there was no significant association between TERT promoter and/or BRAF mutation 
and progression-free survival (PFS), but the PFS of patients with TERT promoter and/or BRAF mutation tended to be shorter than 
those with wild-type (Figure A-C). Notably, in all the patients, the PFS of rs2853669 carriers tended to have longer survival than 
non-carriers, though there was still no statistically significance (Figure D). Pyrosequencing was performed in 15 patients, and 2 of 
them were TERT promoter mutated. The methylation level of TERT promoter UTSS region in primary and metastatic tumors is 
generally higher than those in normal tissues (Figure E-F). Interestingly, taking the mean methylation level of the normal group as 
the threshold value, the primary lesions were divided into hypermethylation group and hypomethylation group. All of the 2 cases 
with TERT mutation were found to be hypomethylated.

Conclusions: TERT promoter more frequently mutated in non-acral cutaneous melanoma than in acral and mucosal melanoma. 
TERT promoter mutation prefers to coexist with BRAF hotspot mutation, and single or dual gene mutations may indicate a shorter 
PFS. SNP rs2853669 carrier may be a favorable factor for PFS. TERT promoter showed hypermethylation in primary and 
metastatic melanoma without TERT promoter mutation.

Background: Nevoid melanoma (NeM) is a rare subtype of melanoma that resembles common nevus in low power silhouette, and 
likely to be wrongly diagnosed. NeM in Asian population is still remained to be explored. 
Design: Twenty-four cases of NeM were collected in Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center from 2018 to 2023. The 
clinicopathological characteristics and follow-up data were retrospectively analyzed. The Vysis Melanoma FISH probe kit, 
combined with 9p21(CDKN2A) and 8q24(MYC) assays were performed in all patients. 
Results: We identified 24 cases of nevoid melanoma from 24 patients (6 males and 18 females). Fifteen cases were classified as 
papillomatous NeM. The age of the patients ranged from 11 to 60 years old (mean=34). This group resembling papillomatous 
dermal nevi had a mean Breslow thickness of 2.2 mm (range 0.8-4.5mm). Junctional melanocytes were only focal or complete 
absent. Impaired mature were observed in 80% (12/15) cases. Mitotic figures ranged from 1 to 11/mm2 (mean=4/mm2) and could 
be found in deeper portion in 11 cases. At the time of diagnosis, 5 patients had local-regional lymph node metastasis. Non-
papillomatous NeM comprised 9 patients. The average age of this group was 40(range 22 to 59 years old). This group was flat or 
slightly dome shaped. The mean Breslow thickness was 1.5mm (range 0.5-2.6mm). Junctional proliferation of atypical melanocytes 
could be observed in 7 cases. Impaired mature were present in 7 cases. Mitotic figures ranged from 1 to 2/mm2 (mean=1/mm2). 
Deep dermal mitosis presented in 4 cases. Immunohistochemically, 21/21(100%), 12/20 (60%) and 3/21 (14.3%) showed diffusely 
positive for SOX10, MelanA and HMB45, respectively. But there were 8/20 (40%) and 18/21 (85.7%) showed a diminished 
expression pattern for MelanA and HMB45 with the increasing depth. Ki-67 was higher in the superficial component compared with 
the deeper component. FISH studies were positive in 83.3% (20/24) of the cases studied, including 13 papillomatous NeM (86.7%) 
 
 
 
 
S531 
and 7 non-papillomatous NeM (77.8%). CCND1 gain demonstrated the highest proportion of positive cases (15/24, 62.5%). The 
follow-up time ranged from 3 to 100 months (median=34.0months). 21 patients had no evidence of disease. 3 patients had distant 
metastasis, one of them eventually died from melanoma, and these three patients were all papillomatous NeM. 
Conclusions: FISH assay is a valuable adjunct for the diagnosis of NeM. Papillomatous NeM may have poorer outcome than non-
papillomatous NeM.

Background: Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti PD-1 and anti-
PD-L1 therapies have exhibited significant survival improvement in advanced melanoma, many Asian patients do not benefit from 
these therapies due to high ratio of acral and mucosal melanoma subtypes. Tumor microenvironment has demonstrated its 
importance of identify appropriate patients for immunotherapies in a variety of cancers. Current study aimed to find pathological 
parameters with correlation of anti PD-1 therapy response in Asian melanoma patients. 
Design: Twenty-four melanoma cases received PD-1 monoclonal antibody immunotherapy in our hospital were evaluated in 
current study. Amony them, 11 cases exhibited a partial response (PR) including four acral, two mucosal and five cutaneous 
subtypes, and 13 cases were progressive disease (PD), with seven acral, two mucosal and four cutaneous melanomas, 
respectively. Median PFS in PR group and in PD group were 25 and 3 months, respectively. Archived patient FFPE sections were 
examined utilizing multiplex immunofluorescence staining with PN 6-Plex Detection Kit (PhenoVision Bio Co., Itd) targeted CD68, 
CD3, CD20, S100, PD-L1 and PD-1. The multiple staining images were scanned, tumor areas were lined out by pathologists and 
analyzed using Oncotopix Discovery system (Visiopharm). The positive cell numbers of CD3, CD20, CD68, PD-1+CD68, PD-
1+CD3, PD-1+CD20, PD-L1+CD68, PD-L1+CD3, PD-L1+CD20, PD-L1+S100, and others (any other cell) were calculated. Spatial 
analysis was examined by setting each S100 positive cell as center to count other cell types from 0-25, 25-50 and 50-100 
micrometers (Œºm) of center cells. 
Results: The positive cell ratios of CD68, CD3, CD20, PD-L1, and PD-1 in PR group and PD group were 2.94%, 6.04%, 2.85%, 
1.34%, 0.34% and 0.74%, 4.47%, 1.24%, 0.41%, 0.04%, respectively. CD3/PD-1 co-positive cell ratio was significantly higher in 
PR group than in PD group, p =0.04. The spatial analysis exhibited significant higher of CD3/PD-1 co-positive cell ratio within 25-50 
Œºm of tumor cells in PR group compared to PD group (p=0.028). According to the ROC curves generated from clinical response 
data, the response score AUC of PD-1/CD3 co-positive was 0.881 (95% CI: 0.722-1.0). 
Conclusions: Current results indicate that PD-1/CD3 co-positive may be a valuable pathological parameter for anti-PD-1 therapy 
response of melanoma in Asians.

Background: While gene fusions are infrequent in melanomas, those involving rearrangements in receptor tyrosine kinase genes 
often lack mutations in BRAF, NRAS, and NF1 (termed triple wild-type (WT)). This supports the notion that gene rearrangements 
play an oncogenic role in these melanomas. Thus, identifying gene fusions may carry therapeutic implications for a subset of 
melanomas. 
 
 
 
 
S532 
Design: We conducted a retrospective analysis of melanoma patients who underwent molecular testing via next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) at our institution between 2021 and 2023, aiming to assess the frequency and specific types of fusions in 
melanomas. Relevant demographic, clinicopathologic, and molecular data‚Äîsuch as somatic mutations, copy number variations, 
tumor mutational burden (TMB), and gene fusions‚Äîwere documented. 
Results: The cohort comprised 68 primary and 76 metastatic melanomas, categorized as 106 (74%) non-acral cutaneous, 15 
(10%) mucosal, 8 acral (6%), and 6 (4%) uveal/blue-nevus-like melanomas, with 9 cases (6%) of unknown primary. Overall, gene 
fusions were found in 4% (6/144) of melanomas (clinicopathologic and molecular profiles summarized in Figure 1). Patients with 
gene fusions had a 1:1 male-to-female ratio and a median age of 65.5 years (range: 19-75 years). Among the fusion-associated 
melanomas, 67% (4/6) were non-acral cutaneous, while the rest were mucosal (anorectal and vaginal). BCR (n=2) (Figure 2) 
and BRAF (n=2) fusions were most common, followed by ALK (n=1) and TMPRSS2 (n=1) fusions. Notably, fusions 
involving BRAF and TMPRSS2 genes were found to be intragenic fusions. Mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or NF1 were seen in 33% 
(2/6) of fusion-associated melanomas, one with a BRAF missense mutation (c.1790T>A, p.L597Q). Half of the melanomas with 
fusion transcripts harbored TERT promoter mutations (TPMs), and 67% (4/6) exhibited a low TMB (<5 mut/Mb).

S533 
Conclusions: Through NGS, we identified 3 novel fusions, including 1 intragenic fusion, which have not been previously 
documented in melanoma: BCR::ZNF11, BCR::CYLC2, and TMPRSS2::TMPRSS2. BCR fusions in solid tumors are exceedingly 
rare, only having been documented in a subset of breast carcinomas and oropharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinoma. TMPRSS2 fusions have predominantly been linked to prostate cancer. Our study indicates that fusion-associated 
melanomas are often triple WT, with low TMB, displaying ultraviolet signatures with TPMs. Further studies with a larger cohort are 
warranted to validate these observations. 
 
429    TRPS1 Expression is Frequently Seen in a Subset of Cutaneous Mesenchymal Neoplasms 
and Tumors of Uncertain Differentiation: A Potential Diagnostic Pitfall

Columbia, New Westminster, BC

Background: TRPS1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was initially regarded as a highly sensitive and specific marker for mammary 
carcinomas and mesenchymal tumors. However, recent data challenges this notion, indicating that TRPS1 expression is not 
exclusive to breast neoplasms. It has been observed in various cutaneous epithelial neoplasms, including extramammary Paget 
disease, squamous cell carcinoma in situ, and certain adnexal neoplasms. Nonetheless, data on TRPS1 expression in cutaneous 
mesenchymal neoplasms and tumors of uncertain differentiation (CMNTUD) remain limited. 
Design: We collected cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) (n=20), dermatofibroma (DF) (n=22), cutaneous 
leiomyosarcoma (n=8), leiomyoma (n=8), angiosarcoma (n=19), Kaposi sarcoma (KS) (n=5), neurofibroma (NF) (n=17), and 
atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) (n=20). Selected cases were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis using anti-TRPS1 antibody 
(Abcam, EPR16171, 1:2000). H-scores were calculated for each case by multiplying the intensity (0=none, 1=weak, 2=moderate, 
3=strong) and extent (0-100) of TRPS1 expression. H-scores were compared between groups via two-tailed t-test. 
Results: The IHC findings are summarized in Figure 1. TRPS1 expression was common in DFs (100%; 22/22), leiomyomas 
(100%; 8/8), AFXs (95%; 19/20), leiomyosarcomas (75%; 6/8), and DFSPs (60%; 12/20), with AFXs having the highest median H-
score of 240 (Figure 1 and Figure 2). TRPS1 expression was rare in angiosarcomas and KSs. In AFXs, when present, it was 
mostly diffuse (84%; 16/19) and at least moderate (89%; 17/19). The H-scores of AFXs were significantly higher than those of 
leiomyosarcomas, a morphological differential diagnosis of AFX (p=0.03). The difference between DFSPs and DFs in H-score was 
highly significant (p<0.0001), while leiomyosarcomas and leiomyomas showed no statistically significant difference (p=0.32).

S534 
 
 
Figure 2 - 429 
 
Conclusions: TRPS1 exhibits variable expression in CMNTUD, with AFXs showing the highest immunoreactivity. This 
underscores that TRPS1 expression is not confined to tumors of breast origin, reaffirming the crucial role of interpreting IHC results 
within the appropriate histopathologic context to avoid potential diagnostic pitfalls. Further studies with larger, more diverse 
CMNTUD cohorts are in process to validate these observations.

Background: In recent years, the Interleukin-36 (IL-36) receptor inhibitor spesolimab has emerged as an effective FDA-approved 
treatment for patients with generalized pustular psoriasis. Several academic dermatopathology labs have incorporated IL-36 IHC to 
assist in evaluating various psoriasiform dermatoses, offering insights not only for diagnosis but also potential treatment 
implications by targeting the Th17 pathway. During the routine evaluation of psoriasiform lesions in our practice, we have 
encountered high IL-36 expression in psoriasiform keratosis (PK), a distinct keratosis histologically resembling psoriasis. The 
clinical differential diagnosis of PK also often includes benign acanthomas/keratoses and non-melanoma skin cancers. Herein, we 
conducted a survey study to assess IL-36 expression in various benign acanthomas/keratoses and precursors of squamous cell 
carcinoma. 
Design: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from benign acanthomas/keratoses (19 PK, 16 seborrheic keratosis, 10 
lichen planus-like keratosis, 7 clear cell acanthoma, 6 porokeratosis, and 5 each of warty dyskeratoma, acantholytic acanthoma, 
epidermolytic acanthoma, and melanoacanthoma) and squamous cell carcinoma precursors (12 squamous cell carcinoma in situ 
and 8 actinic keratosis) were obtained and immunostained for IL-36 (clone 2F4, 1:300 dilution, Cambridge, MA). The staining was 
scored according to the extent and intensity of staining using a numerical scale as reported previously (negative: 0, focal weak: 1+, 
diffuse weak: 2+, focal strong: 3+, diffuse strong: 4+). 
Results: All 19 PKs and 7 of 16 (43.8%) seborrheic keratoses demonstrated high IL-36 expression (‚â•3+).  Of note, all IL-36 
positive seborrheic keratosis cases demonstrated foci of inflamed parakeratosis with scattered neutrophils. All other 
keratoses/acanthomas and carcinoma precursors showed no or low IL-36 expression, apart from 1 warty dyskeratoma and 1 
acantholytic acanthoma (Table 1).

Conclusions: We found high IL-36 expression in PK, similar to psoriasis. Consequently, distinguishing PK and psoriasis primarily 
depends on clinical presentation, necessitating rigorous clinicopathologic correlation. Furthermore, the relatively frequent IL-36 
expression in seborrheic keratosis may suggest a link between PK and seborrheic keratosis, with PK potentially representing a 
variant of inflamed seborrheic keratosis. Unlike previous observation of high IL-36 expression in lichen planus, lichen planus-like 
keratosis exhibits only focal and weak IL-36.

Background: Primary female urethral mucosal melanoma (PFUM) is exceedingly rare, accounting for <1% of all melanomas and 
<4% of all urethral tumors. Since they are often evaluated together with other female genital tract melanomas, the 
clinicopathological and molecular features that are unique to PFUM are unknown. 
Design: In this retrospective study, we identified 20 PFUM and recorded clinicopathological and molecular features. Univariate Cox 
regression model was used to assess associations between recorded characteristics. 
Results: Most patients (pts) were White (n=18, 90%) with median age of 70 years (range: 43-92); bleeding was the most common 
presenting symptom (n=11, 55%). PFUM were most commonly lobulated, amelanotic masses (n=14, 70%), located in the distal 
urethra (n=16, 80%) with involvement of urethral meatus, vagina and bladder in 50%, 40% and 30%, respectively. Relevant 
histopathologic features included lentiginous growth pattern (n=14, 70%); submucosal invasion (n=15, 75%); tumor thickness 
>4mm (n=15, 75%; median: 8.6mm, range: 3.4-25.0); ulceration (n=17, 85%); mitotic rate >10/1mm2 (n=14, 70%); lymphovascular 
invasion (n=10, 50%) and perineural invasion (n=4, 20%). Next generation sequencing performed on 16 cases revealed mutations 
involving TP53 (n=3), KIT (n=3), NF1 (n=3), TERT (n=2), SF3B1 (n=2), AXL (n=1), CTNNB1 (n=1), EGFR (n=1), FGFR3 (n=1), 
MSH2 (n=1), PIK3CA (n=1), and NRAS (n=1), and amplification of KIT, KDR, NOTCH1, PDGFRA, CDK4, and MDM2 genes. At 
presentation, 14 (70%) pts had localized disease, 2 (10%) had regional and 4 (20%) had distant metastases. With 68 months of 
median follow-up, 9 (45%) and 15 (75%) pts developed regional and distant metastases, respectively. Median time to regional and 
distant metastasis were 3.6 (range: 0.6-19.8) and 6.2 (range: 1.8-57.3) months from the date of diagnosis, respectively. Thirteen 
pts died and 11 (55%) died due to progression of PFUM. Increasing tumor thickness correlated with locally advanced disease 
(p=0.035) and distant metastasis at presentation correlated with shorter disease specific survival (p=0.045). 
 
 
 
 
S536 
Conclusions: In this exploratory analysis, we found that PFUM is an aggressive malignancy predominantly affecting older White 
women, with high risk for metastasis and disease-specific mortality; the genetic alterations are distinct from cutaneous melanoma 
as well. Certain clinicopathological features associated with worse prognosis. Studies using larger cohorts are essential for better 
risk stratification and treatment.

Background: Genomic fusions involving Protein Kinase C (PRKC) have been classically associated with heavy melanin 
pigmentation in a subset of melanocytic neoplasms. The understanding and classification of these tumors are evolving, with 
recently proposed reclassification from pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (PEM) category to the blue nevus (BN) category in the 
fifth edition of the World Health Classification (WHO) of Skin Tumors. 
Design: Herein, we report a series of 5 non-pigmented/hypopigmented PRKC fusion melanocytic tumors to further expand on the 
morphology of this entity and present a novel comprehensive molecular characterization. Clinical, histopathologic, and 
immunohistochemical findings were reviewed. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) data on genomic and transcriptomic levels were 
explored. 
Results: The patients presented over a wide age range (7-54) at various anatomical locations (from scalp to ankle). 
Histomorphology shows dermal-based proliferations of non-pigmented medium-sized melanocytes with a biphasic pattern of 
hypercellular areas composed of nevic/epithelioid cells and hypocellular areas with dense fibrotic stroma and ‚Äúcollagen 
trapping‚Äù.  High-risk features including significant atypia and mitotic activity are not identified. Immunohistochemistry mostly shows 
retained p16 and preserved BAP1. The clinical courses were uncomplicated after excisions. NGS reveals 2 cases of 
PTPRJ::PRKCB fusion and 3 cases of PRKCA fusions with partners SLC44A1, RNF13, and ATP2B4. Pathogenic secondary 
genomic alterations are rare and sporadic, including ATM stop-gain mutation and WT1 germline loss. RNA differential expression 
analysis against 6 GNAQ/GNA11-driven low-risk BNs shows a group of genes with significantly higher transcription levels, 
including LOXL4, RNF157, BCHE, and GDF15. Interestingly, gene set pathway analysis shows strong enrichment in 
microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) related genes, and yet, the tumors all lacked any significant pigmentation. 
Conclusions: We further expand the morphologic spectrum of PRKC fusion melanocytic tumors with molecular characterization. 
Our novel transcriptome-level findings provide insight into the nuanced molecular events and new evidence for classification.

Background: Primary conjunctival melanoma (PCoM) is an unusual, highly aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis. The risk of 
metastatic disease is as high as 30%, and the 10-year disease-specific mortality is 9‚Äì35%. PCoM is inherently distinct from other 
mucosal, uveal and skin melanomas; however, its molecular pathogenesis is poorly understood hindering the development of 
targeted therapy.  
 
 
 
 
S537 
Design: A total of 18 patients with PCoM were identified retrospectively from the archives of two institutions over a period of 30 
years (11 patients from one; 7 from the other). Three conjunctival nevi (CN) were also analyzed for comparison. Demographic and 
clinicopathologic features were reviewed. Mutation profiling was performed using next generation sequencing (NGS) with a 
customized targeted 32-gene panel. 
Results: The median age of the 18 PCoM and 3 CN pts was 70.5 years (range 39-94) and 52 years (range 31-56), respectively. 
The M: F ratio was 1.25:1 and 2:1 for PCoM and CN, respectively. The mean tumor thickness was 1.9 mm. All 3 CNs harbored 
activating NRAS codon 61 mutations (Q61R, Q61K and Q61K). PCoM harbored at least one pathogenic mutation in the 8 cases 
(100%) in which NGS was performed, and two cases had 3 or more mutations. Genomic alterations in BRAF (S467L & V600E) 
and NRAS (Q61H & Q61R) were the most frequent. Additional mutations included EIF1AX(N4Y), EGFR (M600T),  
PDGFRA (D576N), MET (R988C), ATM (V410M), NF1(L1187F), ERBB4 (E928V), GRIN2A (D369N), PREX2 (E414K) 
and STK19 (D89N). Interestingly, activating mutations in BAP1, KIT, SF3B1, GNAQ, and GNA11 were not identified in any of the 
studied cases. Seven patients had recurrences of the CoM, 1-10 years after initial diagnosis and excision, while 2 patients had 
local recurrence as well as metastasis (to lymph node in one pt and LN as well as distant in other). After a mean follow up of 78.3 
months, 11 pts were alive with no evidence of disease, 1 was alive with disease (margin positive) and 6 pts had died, 2 of other 
cause and 4 of unknown cause.

Conclusions: Mutational analysis of PCoM reveals a distinct mutational profile from uveal and other mucosal melanomas and 
shows some similarity to skin melanomas. Similar NRAS mutations in CNs and some PCoM suggest a possibility of common 
precursor pathway among a subset of these lesions. Molecular profiling of PCoM may be valuable in strategizing management in 
metastatic PCoM with therapeutically actionable alterations such as NRAS, NF1, BRAF, PDGFRA, ERBB4 and EGFR.

Background: Proliferating trichilemmal tumor (PTT) is a rare cutaneous adnexal tumor of external root sheath derivation.  Though 
most are benign, rare cases exhibit malignant histopathologic characteristics and aggressive clinical behavior.  Significant 
variability in diagnostic terminology and criteria persists within the different categories of PTT, necessitating further classification 
improvements. We therefore undertook a morphologic and genomic study of benign, atypical (intermediate), and malignant PTT.  
Design: Our surgical pathology archives were searched for benign, atypical, and malignant PTT. Two authors independently 
reviewed all available slides.  Cases previously diagnosed as "atypical" or ‚Äúmalignant‚Äù PTT were included only if clear areas of 
morphologically ‚Äútypical‚Äù PTT were present. We identified and assessed the morphologic features from the current WHO 
classification and previously published characteristics.  Selected cases underwent molecular analysis by a next-generation 
sequencing platform and/or array comparative genomic hybridization. 
Results: Clinical, morphologic, and genomic features of PTT are summarized in Table 1. All benign PTT demonstrated solid-cystic 
tumors composed of cells with trichilemmal differentiation, without significant cytoarchitectural atypia.  In contrast, atypical and 
malignant PTT showed areas of moderate to severe cytologic atypia, with many resembling squamous cell carcinoma.  Pairwise 
comparisons revealed that malignant PTT differed from atypical PTT by displaying an infiltrative growth pattern, peripheral stromal 
desmoplasia, atypical small nests or cords, and atypical mitotic figure.  None of our PTT cases revealed perineural or vascular 
invasion.  Copy number variations (CNVs) were found in all evaluated cases, frequently involving chromosomes 6, 15, and 19. 
Extensive and more complex CNVs were a feature of atypical and malignant PTT.  TP53 mutation was also seen in 2 cases (1 
benign and 1 malignant).

‚Ä†Two malignant PPT demonstrated both central and peripheral desmoplastic stroma.  
Conclusions: Our results confirm a broader morphologic and genomic spectrum of PTT.  Additional more complex CNVs present 
in atypical and malignant PTT probably explain its higher grade cytomorphology and possibly more aggressive clinical 
behavior.  Moreover, atypical PTT can show genomic features similar to malignant PTT, suggesting that at least some atypical PTT 
are likely to be "encapsulated" malignant PTT. Ongoing clinical follow-up analysis should provide further insights into the natural 
biology of this PTT subgroup. 
 
435    Smooth Muscle Neoplasms of the Dermis and Subcutaneous Tissues

Disclosures: Michael Mortellaro: None; Sandra Gjorgova Gjeorgjievski: None 
Background: An atypical intradermal smooth muscle neoplasm (AISMN) is a primary dermal smooth muscle neoplasm with 
nuclear enlargement, increased mitoses, and an indolent prognosis. Leiomyosarcoma is a mitotically active, malignant smooth 
muscle neoplasm with local recurrence and metastatic potential. 
Design: Cases from August 2013 to August 2023 were reviewed for dermal smooth muscle neoplasms, excluding benign smooth 
muscle neoplasms (pilar leiomyoma), metastatic lesions and irradiated cases. Nineteen cases were further categorized by location 
into dermal only, dermal with minimal subcutaneous involvement, dermal and subcutaneous involvement, and subcutaneous only. 
Results: Three cases with pure dermal location and four dermal cases with minimal subcutaneous involvement occurred in seven 
male patients (age range: 24-83, median: 54). All had mild to moderate cytologic atypia, mitotic activity range: 1-8 per 10 high 
power fields (HPF), and an infiltrative growth pattern. These cases lacked tumor necrosis, surface ulceration, local recurrence or 
metastatic disease after 1.5 - 55 months (median: 26 months). The seven cases from six patients (4 females and 2 males, age 
range: 41-86, median: 72) with dermal and significant subcutaneous involvement (>50% of tumor volume) had moderate to severe 
cytologic atypia, skin ulceration (three cases), focal tumor necrosis (one case) and a significant increase in mitotes (range: 4-27/10 
HPF). Follow up of 2 ‚Äì 69 months (median: 15.5) found one patient with local recurrence at 8 months. Five subcutaneous only 
cases (3 females and 2 males, age range: 60-71, median: 62) were well circumscribed, showed moderate to severe cytologic 
atypia, increased mitoses (range: 2-13/10 HPF) and tumor necrosis (in four of 5 cases). Follow up of 1-63 months (median: 52) 
identified one case with metastatic pulmonary disease after 6 months.

Figure 2 - 435 
 
Conclusions: In our series, dermal smooth muscle neoplasms with infiltrative growth, cytologic atypia and increased mitotic 
activity, including those with minimal subcutaneous involvement, are seen only in males, and lack evidence of local recurrence or 
metastatic potential compared to smooth muscle neoplasms with significant subcutaneous involvement or that are located entirely 
in the subcutis. Therefore, AISMN is good terminology for these dermal lesions. ‚ÄúCutaneous leiomyosarcoma‚Äù should be used for 
subcutaneous lesions or those with significant subcutaneous extension (>50% of the tumor volume) given their metastatic and 
recurrence potential. 
 
436    Molecular, Morphologic and Immunohistochemical Characterization of PRKAR1A-Mutant 
Melanoma

Disclosures: Alexander Neil: None; John Hanna: None; David Papke: None 
Background: PRKAR1A mutations are common in malignant melanotic nerve sheath tumor (MMNST), and PRKAR1A expression 
loss via immunohistochemistry (IHC) is used in diagnostic practice to distinguish MMNST from malignant melanoma. 
However, PRKAR1A alterations also have been reported in malignant melanomas that share histologic features with pigmented 
epithelioid melanocytoma, suggesting that PRKAR1A alterations have imperfect specificity in this differential diagnosis. We sought 
to systematically characterize PRKAR1A alterations in malignant melanoma along with their morphologic and IHC correlates. 
Design: We interrogated our institutional database and identified 1,320 melanomas that underwent panel next generation 
sequencing. We interpreted the pathogenicity of PRKAR1A single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variants (CNVs), and 
where possible, we correlated PRKAR1A mutation with histologic findings and PRKAR1A protein expression by IHC. 
Results: PRKAR1A SNVs were identified in melanomas from 18 of 1,320 patients (1.4%). SNVs from 4 of 18 patients (22%) were 
interpreted as pathogenic, based on published characterization of pathogenicity including association with Carney complex. One 
pathogenic variant was missense, and the other 3 were nonsense. One of these 4 melanomas was heavily pigmented, and 3 were 
epithelioid; all 4 showed marked nuclear atypia that would be unusual for MMNST, and all harbored concurrent mutations typical of 
melanoma, including TERT promoter (3/4), MAP2K1 (1/4) and NF1 (1/4) alterations. PRKAR1A CNVs were identified in 176 
melanomas (13.3%). 25 CNVs (13.6%) were single copy deletions, 1 was an amplification, and the others were low level gains. All 
8 tested melanomas with non-pathogenic PRKAR1A variants (2 missense, 6 single-copy deletion) demonstrated retained 
PRKAR1A expression by IHC, while the 1 melanoma with a truncating PRKAR1A variant available for testing showed loss of 
expression. Melanomas harboring PRKAR1A single-copy deletions or SNVs showed pathogenic alterations in genes involved in 
melanoma pathogenesis (38/42 overall; 90%), including TERT (20/42; 48%) BRAF (17/42; 40%), NF1 (11/42; 26%), 
and NRAS (9/42; 21%). 
 
 
 
 
S541 
Conclusions: Pathogenic PRKAR1A mutations are rare in melanoma (4/1,320 sequenced cases; 0.3%), and 
most PRKAR1A alterations in melanoma are not pathogenic. However, because pathogenic PRKAR1A mutations with loss of 
PRKAR1A expression by IHC does occur in melanomas, PRKAR1A IHC has imperfect specificity in distinguishing MMNST from 
melanoma.

Background: Distinguishing benign from malignant melanocytic lesions can be challenging. MyPath¬Æ Melanoma, previously 
known as Myriad MyPath, is a qRT-PCR assay designed to evaluate the expression of 23 targeted genes, including 
primarily PRAME and several S100 genes. This assay serves as an adjunctive tool in differentiating benign from malignant 
melanocytic lesions. PRAME is a highly sensitive and specific marker for melanoma diagnosis. Our study sought to correlate 
MyPath results with PRAME expression, SNP array, and FISH analyses and evaluate their diagnostic utility in melanocytic lesions. 
Design: We assessed 56 diagnostically ambiguous melanocytic lesions, categorized based on morphology into dysplastic nevi vs 
malignant melanoma (29), spitzoid (19), nevoid (7), and blue nevus (1). Two dermatopathologists independently reviewed the 
histopathologic findings, PRAME expression, MyPath, SNP array, and FISH results. Subsequently, lesions were definitively 
classified as benign or malignant. PRAME staining was quantified based on percentage of positive nuclei and intensity of staining, 
and a combined score (0-7) was calculated. SNP array was considered positive when ‚â•3 chromosomal aberrations were detected, 
or <3, but typical of melanoma. Aberrations encountered in indolent lesions, such as sole gain in 11p, were considered negative. 
FISH results were interpreted as normal or abnormal according to the cutoffs used by the reporting institutions. 
Results: Thirty-eight lesions were classified as benign and 18 as malignant. SNP array results were available in 16 cases and 
FISH results were available in 30 cases. MyPath results showed a robust positive correlation with PRAME expression. Pearson's 
correlation coefficient further substantiated the strong association between MyPath and both PRAME combined score (r=0.81, 
p<0.0001) and percentage score (r=0.7599, p<0.0002). No significant correlation emerged between MyPath and SNP or FISH 
results. All the assessed markers‚ÄîMyPath, PRAME combined score, SNP array, and FISH‚Äîdemonstrated statistically significant 
difference between benign and malignant lesions. MyPath displayed the most robust correlation with malignancy (œá2=25.58, 
p<0.001), followed by PRAME combined score (œá2=21.37, p<0.001). 
Conclusions: PRAME immunohistochemistry strongly correlates with a PRAME-based molecular assay and can serve as a cost-
effective and rapid ancillary tool in the routine evaluation of melanocytic lesions to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

Background: Cutaneous clear cell mesenchymal neoplasms have significant morphologic and variable immunophenotypic overlap 
and include PEComa, dermal clear cell mesenchymal neoplasm (DCCMN) and the recently described clear cell tumor with 
 
 
 
 
S542 
melanocytic differentiation and ACTIN::MITF translocation (CCMT with ACTIN::MITF), many of which are likely to have been 
diagnosed as PEComa prior to its recognition. The study aims to investigate a series of cases previously diagnosed as cutaneous 
PEComa and as DCCMN to gain more insight into these tumors.  
Design: The institution‚Äôs laboratory information system was searched (2015-2023), yielding 11 cases diagnosed as cutaneous 
PEComas or DCCMN. For final inclusion, cases had to have paraffin blocks or unstained slides sufficient for whole exome (WES) 
and whole transcriptomic sequencing (WTS).  
Results: Ten cases met selection criteria. Amongst previously diagnosed PEComas, four cases involved the lower extremities 
(4/7), two involved the trunk (2/7), and one the upper extremities (1/7). Five cases were originally diagnosed as PEComas (5/7) and 
two as malignant PEComas (2/7). Immunohistochemical stains revealed simultaneous melanocytic (HMB-45, MITF, and/or Melan-
A) and smooth muscle marker (Desmin and/or SMA) expression in three cases (3/7), while isolated expression of melanocytic 
markers was observed in three cases (3/7). A case was negative for both, but positive for NK1/C3 and Cathepsin-K. All cases were 
negative for S-100 and/or SOX-10.  Three had fusions involving MITF and actin coding regions (ACTB/ACTG1::MITF) and were 
reclassified as CCMT with ACTIN::MITF, while one had concurrent TSC2 and WNR mutations. The remaining 2 cases, diagnosed 
as malignant PEComas, harbored either an isolated TP53 mutation, or concurrent TP53 and KEAP1 mutations. The tumor mutation 
burden (TMB) was low or indeterminate in these two malignant cases. Among the three DCCMN cases, one showed 
a TP53 mutation with low TMB while the other two cases did not demonstrate either any or clinically relevant mutations. No fusions 
were identified in DCCMN.

Conclusions: Subsets of cutaneous PEComas are CCMT with ACTIN::MITF. In cases without this fusion classified as PEComa, 
no TFE3 gene fusions were seen, unlike PEComas of other sites. Mutations in TP53 and KEAP1 were seen in cutaneous 
malignant PEComas which lacked a high TMB or a genetic signature that would be expected in melanomas. No fusions were 
identified in DCCMN; one case demonstrated mutations, but TMB was low in all cases. 
 
439    Cutaneous Rhabdomyosarcoma: Analysis of NRAS/BRAF Status, Tumor Mutation Burden,

Background: Rhabdomyosarcomatous transdifferentiation is a rare but well-documented phenomena in both carcinoma and 
melanoma, and, in these cases, recognition of a conventional component by either morphology or immunophenotype is essential 
 
 
 
 
S543 
for correct diagnosis. However, tumors which are entirely transdifferentiated have been traditionally impossible to differentiate from 
primary rhabdomyosarcoma.  The introduction of novel immunohistochemistry and molecular testing, which allows for the detection 
of NRAS/BRAF mutations, high tumor mutation burden (TMB), and UV signature, features uncommon in sarcoma, has given us 
additional tools to more accurately classify these malignancies as either transdifferentiated melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma. 
We sought to analyze a cohort of primary cutaneous rhabdomyosarcoma to determine their NRAS/BRAF status and asses for TMB 
and UV signature. 
Design: Cases diagnosed as cutaneous rhabdomyosarcoma were retrieved. The tumors were evaluated for the presence or 
absence of melanoma is situ (MIS) and/or epithelial dysplasia. NRAS Q61R and BRAF V600E immunohistochemistry was 
performed, and molecular data including TMB and UV signature was collected when available. 
Results: 10 cases of cutaneous rhabdomyosarcoma were identified (8M/2F; 30-90 years; median, 83 years) presenting in the 
head/neck (n=7), extremity (n=2), and trunk (n=1). All tumors involved the dermis, and 4 cases extended into the subcutis. 
Morphologically, cases showed a sheet-like proliferation of atypical epithelioid cells with variably prominent nucleoli with brisk 
mitotic activity. All lesions were at least focally positive for myogenin or MyoD1 but lacked S100, SOX10 and keratin 
immunoreactivity. Examination of the overlying epidermis when present (n=9), showed MIS in a single case. By 
immunohistochemistry, 1 tumor (of 10) was positive for NRAS Q61R; all were negative for BRAF V600E (0/10). 2 additional cases 
had high TMB and UV signatures. Additional molecular testing in the remaining cases is ongoing. Follow-up was available in 4 
patients; 3 developed metastasis (2 regional lymph nodes, 1 lung). 
Conclusions: Cutaneous rhabdomyosarcoma have a predilection for head/neck sites, and a subset have genetic signatures that 
include either NRAS mutations or high TMB/UV signatures.  Additionally, nodal metastases are common in this cohort. These 
findings raise the possibility that some cutaneous rhabdomyosarcomas may be melanoma or carcinoma with complete 
rhabdomyosarcomatous transdifferentiation.

Background: Melanoma is the most fatal skin cancer, and patients likely develop nodal and distant metastases during follow-up. 
Many known mutations contribute to the tumorigenesis of melanoma, but it is not well understood how these genetic alterations 
together affect patient outcomes. In this study, we aimed to construct and validate a prognostic nomogram incorporating 
clinicopathological features and molecular characteristics of cutaneous melanomas. 
Design: Clinicopathological and molecular data from 276 melanoma patients were extracted. Cases were randomly divided into 
train (n = 220) and test cohorts (n = 56). In the train set, we first performed stepwise algorithms on the saturated Cox proportional 
hazard model followed by the inclusion of stepwise-selected variables in a survival random forest model. Subsequently, data were 
validated and evaluated by the dynamic Harrell‚Äôs concordance index (C-index). 
Results: In the first part of the validation, the C-index was 0.72 (95%CI=0.64-0.80) for prognosticating the disease-free survival 
(DFS) of the test set. We then validated the model‚Äôs performance in overall survival (OS) estimation in train and test sets in the 
second part. The resulting C-indexes were 0.80 (95%CI=0.76-0.85) and 0.71 (95%CI=0.60-0.81). We divided train and test sets by 
the median score of the model into low and high scores. The survival differences were evaluated between patients with low and 
high scores in both training (Figure 1A, B) and test sets (Figure 1C, D). Patients with high scores had worse DFS and OS than 
those with low scores. Two-year DFS of low-score and high-score patients in the entire cohort were 98% (95%CI=96-100%) and 
47% (95%CI=39-57%), respectively. On the other hand, the two-year OS of patients with low scores was 97% (95%CI = 95-100%), 
which is significantly higher than those with high scores (72% [95%CI=65%-81%]).  The impact of each variable in the prediction 
model was calculated (Figure 2). The dynamic nomogram is available online (https://lkhangkv1995.shinyapps.io/MISP/).

Conclusions: We developed a dynamic nomogram incorporating both clinicopathological and molecular parameters that can help 
precisely estimate the survival outcomes of melanoma patients. It can help clinicians better assess patient prognoses and tailor 
appropriate treatment decisions.

Disclosures: Huy Vuong: None; Minh-Khang Le: None; Chau Bui: None; Tetsuo Kondo: None; Andrew Bellizzi: None 
Background: It has been well established that polyomavirus (MCPyV) can drive the tumorigenesis of Merkel cell carcinoma 
(MCC). In this multicenter study, we aimed to investigate the clinical and prognostic implications of MCPyV in MCC patients. 
 
 
 
 
S545 
Design: We retrospectively collected 124 MCC cases from the archives of three institutions. MCPyV status was assessed using 
the CM2B4 immunohistochemistry in 73 cases. Chi-square, Fisher‚Äôs exact test, and Wilcoxon‚Äôs test were used to compare 
categorical and continuous variables, when applicable.  For time-to-event outcomes such as metastasis-free survival (MFS), 
recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS), Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression 
analyses were utilized by calculating hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence interval (CI). 
Results: The clinicopathological characteristics of MCPyV-positive and MCPyV-negative cases are shown in Table 1. The 
incidence of MCPyV in MCCs was 43% and not significantly different between institutions (p=0.697). There were no statistical 
differences in patient age, gender, T stage, M stage, radiation, or chemotherapy administration between the two groups. On the 
other side, lymph node metastasis was more frequent in MCPyV-positive MCCs (p=0.045). Regarding tumor location, MCPyV-
positive MCC was more frequently identified in the acral sites but less commonly seen in the head and neck region (p=0.002) 
compared to MCPyV-negative cases. Kaplan Meier analyses demonstrated a trend toward worse prognoses in MCPyV-negative 
tumors, but statistical significance was not reached (Figure 1). In multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses, we 
found a statistically significant association of improved MFS (HR=0.21; 95% CI=0.08-0.56; p=0.002) and OS (HR=0.18; 95% 
CI=0.07-0.47; p<0.001) in MCPyV-positive versus MCPyV-negative MCCs (Figure 2).

Conclusions: This study confirmed that polyomavirus is commonly seen in MCCs. MCPyV-positive and MCPyV-negative MCCs 
had distinct clinicopathological features. In comparison to MCPyV-driven tumors, MCPyV-negative MCCs were associated with 
worse survival outcomes. 
 
442    Cutaneous Desmoid-type Fibromatosis: Clinicopathologic Analysis of a Rare Clinical Subtype

Disclosures: Craig Wakefield: None; David Papke: None; Christopher Fletcher: None; Leona Doyle: None 
Background: Desmoid fibromatoses are locally aggressive, deep-seated fibroblastic neoplasms characterized by mutations 
in CTNNB1 and less often APC. Palmar and plantar fibromatoses are referred to as ‚Äòsuperficial fibromatoses‚Äô but arise in deep 
aponeurotic tissue. Primary cutaneous or true superficial desmoid-type fibromatosis is exceptionally rare and its clinical significance 
unknown; this study describes the clinicopathologic features and outcomes of ten such tumors. 
Design: Cases involving only dermis and/or superficial subcutaneous tissue were identified from departmental and consultation 
files. Clinical, histologic and immunohistochemical features, as well as outcomes, were evaluated. 
Results: There were 7 female and 3 male patients with a median age of 39 years (range 24-75). None had a history of familial 
adenomatous polyposis. Four patients had antecedent local trauma. Median tumor size was 2.7cm (range 1-10.5). Lesions 
involved trunk (n=6), extremities (n=3) and head & neck (n=1). Grossly, most were well circumscribed nodules. Suggested 
pathologic diagnoses included fibromatosis, hypertrophic scar, nodular fasciitis, and low-grade sarcoma. Tumors were dermally 
confined (n=4), showed focal extension into subcutis (n=3) or only involved superficial subcutis (n=3). Tumors were composed of 
long fascicles of uniform spindled cells in a collagenous stroma. Two had a prominent myxoid stroma and 7 had a Grenz zone. 
There was frequent displacement and compression of native adnexal structures. Scattered, atypical hyperchromatic cells were 
present in one case. Mitotic activity was minimal. All tumors showed nuclear expression of beta-catenin (10/10), 87% showed 
expression of SMA (7/8), and CD34 was negative (0/4). Trisomy 8 and 20 was identified in one tumor. Follow up data were 
available for 6 cases (range 1-12y; median 5.5y). One patient (tumor size 9 cm) developed local recurrence, underwent 
 
 
 
 
S547 
chemoradiation and was alive with disease at last follow up; no other patient had recurrence, including one with positive resection 
margins.  
Conclusions: Desmoid-type fibromatosis is extremely rare in skin & subcutis and shows similar histologic features to deep-seated 
tumors; while the risk of recurrence appears much lower, there is potential for local progression. Diagnostic clues include a long 
fascicular growth pattern, compressed adnexa (in contrast to appendageal atrophy of scar), and in some cases a myxoid 
stroma. Immunohistochemistry for beta-catenin is usually essential to confirm the diagnosis.

Background: Immunotherapies (IT) work by regulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and have shown striking results as a 
treatment for advanced melanoma; however, meaningful responses are seen in only a subset of patients. Acral melanoma (AM) is 
a rare, aggressive type of melanoma with a distinct genetic profile. Our knowledge of the TME in rare subtypes is limited. Herein, 
we aimed to investigate the TME in primary acral lentiginous melanoma (PALM) and compare it with primary cutaneous melanoma 
(PCM) and primary non-lentiginous acral melanoma (PNLAM) to identify potential therapeutic and predictive biomarker. 
Design: Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis was performed on 18 PALM, 9 PCM, and 8 PNLAM with a customized 770-
gene expression panel (including 24 different immune cell types and 30 common cancer antigens). IHC staining for protein kinase 
R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) was performed on 25 ALM (19 primary, 6 metastatic), 9 PCM, and 9 PNLAM. 
Molecular and IHC findings were correlated with clinicopathologic parameters, therapy and disease-specific and overall survival. 
Results: A prominent finding was PERK immunoexpression was significantly more common in ALM cases (40%) than in PCM 
(0%) and PNLAM cases (11%) (p=0.038)(Fig 1). However, IHC staining was not significantly associated with other clinicopathologic 
parameters or survival. DGE identified significant upregulation of ICAM3, CD164, YTHDF2, IFNAR1, TNFSF13, and TYK2 in PALM 
cases (p<0.01), which correlated with enrichment in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR, NF-kB, TNF, ERK, adhesion, and chemokine pathways (p 
<0.01). PALM and PCM TMEs showed a significant predominance of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CD8+T) compared to PNLAM 
(p<0.001; p<0.01)(Fig 2). PCM had a greater proportion of mast cells than PALM and PNLAM (p<0.01). PNLAM TME showed 
significantly less CD8+T signature. Most PALM showed relative abundance of CD8+T over exhausted CD8+T and Tregs (p<0.01), 
and these cases significantly associated with stage I/II presentation and epithelioid cytology (p<0.05). PALMs with exhausted CD8 
signatures significantly associated with ulceration and PNI (p=0.01)

Conclusions: IHC and DGE unveil that PALM is significantly different from PCM and PNLAM. PALM TMEs are distinct from 
PNLAM TME, showing a significant preponderance of CD8+ T cells over T-regs, suggesting possibly better response to IT in 
PALM. Upregulation of TYK2 and TNF in PALM suggests the potential efficacy for combination regimen with selective TYK2 or 
TNF1 inhibitors when IT alone fails. Finally, upregulation of TYK2 and TNF in PALM cases is supported by significantly greater 
immunoexpression of PERK.
