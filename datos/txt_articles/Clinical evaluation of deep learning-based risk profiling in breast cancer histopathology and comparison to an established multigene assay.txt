Introduction
Based on classic clinicopathological variables, a signifi­
cant proportion of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative 
early-stage breast cancer are categorized as clinically inter­
mediate risk, thus providing limited information to guide 
adjuvant chemotherapy decisions. Prognostic risk profiling 
has become an integrated part of modern breast cancer diag­
nostics to provide additional risk information for this patient 
group for identifying patients where adjuvant chemotherapy 
can be omitted [1–3].
Among the established prognostic multiparameter diag­
nostic assays based on gene expression [4], the Prosigna 
assay (Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature 
Assay, Veracyte, South San Francisco, USA) is widely used

Abstract
Purpose  To evaluate the Stratipath Breast tool for image-based risk profiling and compare it with an established prognostic 
multigene assay for risk profiling in a real-world case series of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early breast cancer patients categorized as intermediate risk based on classic clinicopatho­
logical variables and eligible for chemotherapy.
Methods  In a case series comprising 234 invasive ER-positive/HER2-negative tumors, clinicopathological data includ­
ing Prosigna results and corresponding HE-stained tissue slides were retrieved. The digitized HE slides were analysed by 
Stratipath Breast.
Results  Our findings showed that the Stratipath Breast analysis identified 49.6% of the clinically intermediate tumors as low 
risk and 50.4% as high risk. The Prosigna assay classified 32.5%, 47.0% and 20.5% tumors as low, intermediate and high 
risk, respectively. Among Prosigna intermediate-risk tumors, 47.3% were stratified as Stratipath low risk and 52.7% as high 
risk. In addition, 89.7% of Stratipath low-risk cases were classified as Prosigna low/intermediate risk. The overall agreement 
between the two tests for low-risk and high-risk groups (N = 124) was 71.0%, with a Cohen’s kappa of 0.42. For both risk 
profiling tests, grade and Ki67 differed significantly between risk groups.
Conclusion  The results from this clinical evaluation of image-based risk stratification shows a considerable agreement to an 
established gene expression assay in routine breast pathology.

and endorsed by national and international guidelines [5–8]. 
The Prosigna assay identifies intrinsic molecular subtypes 
(i.e., luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched and basal-like) 
and provides an individual risk of recurrence (ROR) score 
between 0 and 100 along with a three-tier risk category (low, 
intermediate, high) based on ROR score and nodal status. 
The Prosigna assay contributes with prognostic information 
for patients with early ER+/HER2- breast cancer and its 
efficacy has been demonstrated in several study populations 
[1, 9–14].
The diagnostic foundation with pathological assessment 
of the well-established prognostic variables such as tumor 
size, stage and tumor grade, is still an essential part of clini­
cal decision making [15]. Among these, histologic grade is 
one of the most important prognostic factors for breast can­
cer [16, 17]. Approximately 50% of all [17–20], and around 
60% of ER-positive/HER2-negative [1, 21] breast cancers 
are classified as histologic grade 2, which is a heterogenous 
group of tumors with variations in terms of aggressiveness 
and prognosis [22, 23], thus, associated with limited value 
to guide decisions on choice of therapy. A limitation in clini­
cal decision-making is, despite the use of prognostic multi­
gene assays, that tests such as Prosigna may classify up to 
44% of histologic grade 2 tumors as intermediate risk [24], 
which does not add any clinically actionable information. In 
addition, the diagnostic multigene assays for breast cancer 
risk stratification show discordances in risk categorization 
between different tests [12, 25].
Digital pathology workflows are becoming standard 
practice and enable application of advanced image analysis 
in the clinical setting [26]. In addition, the recent evolution 
in deep learning, a field of artificial intelligence (AI), has 
further expanded the utility of machine learning techniques 
in computational pathology, making it possible to predict 
patient prognosis [27–32], response to neoadjuvant therapy 
[33], underlying molecular phenotypes [28, 34–37] or mul­
tigene assay results [38] in breast cancer using computer-
based models to analyze and characterize histopathology 
whole slide images. Hence, computational pathology also 
plays a central role in precision medicine [26]. By lever­
aging grade-associated morphological features from hema­
toxylin and eosin (HE)-stained histopathology slides, deep 
learning-based image analysis has been shown to enable 
stratification of grade 2 tumors into two risk groups associ­
ated with risk of recurrence [27].
The novel AI-based precision diagnostic solution, 
Stratipath Breast (Stratipath AB, Solna, Sweden), is a com­
mercial CE-IVD marked deep learning-based image analy­
sis tool that utilizes digitized histopathological whole slide 
images to stratify intermediate risk patients in terms of risk 
of recurrence [29]. The test outputs a two-tier risk category. 
Compared with multigene assays, deep learning-based 
techniques have the strength of providing fast and cost-effi­
cient solutions.
In this study, we provide the first clinical evaluation of 
the AI-based Stratipath Breast tool for image-based risk 
profiling where we compare it with an established multigene 
assay for risk stratification in a real-world breast cancer case 
series of clinically intermediate-risk ER+/HER2- tumors.
Methods
Patient inclusion and clinical data retrieval
This retrospective real-world case series consisted of 234 
invasive breast tumors from patients with early ER-pos­
itive HER2-negative breast cancer, clinically assessed as 
intermediate-risk tumors and eligible for chemotherapy, 
diagnosed at Karolinska University Hospital and Söder­
sjukhuset, Stockholm, Sweden. The case series represents 
consecutive tumors that had been analysed with the Prosigna 
assay in clinical routine at point of diagnosis between the 
years 2020 and 2022, to evaluate the patients’ risk of recur­
rence according to the Swedish national guidelines [39] and 
regional treatment guidelines. The guidelines recommend 
that gene expression-based analysis should be considered 
for postmenopausal patients with lymph node negative or 
1–3 positive nodes (N0 or N1) and ER+/HER2- breast can­
cer where there is uncertainty about the tumor’s risk cat­
egorization prior to chemotherapy decisions. In addition, 
multigene assays were considered for luminal B-like tumors 
based on immunohistochemistry biomarker categorization 
to provide information for chemotherapy decision. The 
cohort has partly been expanded from Kjällquist et al. [24]. 
The Prosigna assay had been performed at the Department 
of Clinical Pathology and Cancer Diagnostics, Karolinska 
University Hospital, on sections from formalin-fixed paraf­
fin-embedded (FFPE) breast cancer tissue blocks, accord­
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions (Veracyte, South San 
Francisco, CA, USA) on the nCounter system (NanoString 
Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) as part of clinical routine. 
Clinicopathological data including Prosigna results (intrin­
sic molecular subtype, ROR score (0-100) and risk group) 
were retrospectively retrieved from electronic records, 
along with the corresponding archived HE-stained, and par­
allel sectioned Ki67-stained, FFPE tissue slides.
Clinicopathological tumor data was retrieved from elec­
tronic records. Upon diagnosis, the routine biomarkers ER, 
progesterone receptor (PR), HER2 and Ki67, were assessed 
according to national guidelines [39]. Monoclonal rab­
bit anti-ER (clone SP1), anti-PR (clone 1E2), anti-HER-
2/neu (clone 4B5) and anti-Ki67 (clone 30 − 9) antibodies 
were utilized according to the manufacturer’s instructions 
1 3

(BenchMark ULTRA Staining Module, Ventana Medical 
Systems, Arizona, USA). A positive ER or PR status was 
defined as > = 10% positive tumor nuclei. HER2 status was 
first determined by IHC, and tumors with 2 + score were 
subsequently evaluated for gene amplification by HER2 
dual-probe in situ hybridization staining with VENTANA 
HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail assay (Roche Diag­
nostics, Rotkreutz, Switzerland) together with VENTANA 
Silver ISH DNP Detection kit and VENTANA Red ISH 
DIG detection kit according to the manufacturer’s instruc­
tions (BenchMark ULTRA IHC/ISH Staining Module, Ven­
tana Medical Systems, Arizona, USA). Ki67 scores were 
reported as a continuous index that describe the percentage 
of positively stained tumor nuclei within a hotspot contain­
ing a minimum of 200 tumor cells, or from year 2022 as a 
global score across the entire tumor due to changes in the 
national guidelines.
Exclusion criteria are described in the consort diagram in 
Supplementary Fig. S1 and further in sections below. Only 
cases with complete results available from both the Pro­
signa and Stratipath Breast tests were included in the study 
comparisons.
Ki67 global scoring
Due to the change in Ki67 scoring recommendations in 
2022, all tumors were re-scored for Ki67 by the global 
scoring method using the open-source image analysis soft­
ware QuPath [40]. All original Ki67 stained tissue slides 
were digitized in-house with a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer 
XR (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Shikuoka, Japan) at 40X 
magnification (0.226 μm/pixel). A protocol for digital Ki67 
global scoring using QuPath was followed, described pre­
viously [41–43] and in accordance with recommendations 
from the International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working 
Group (https://www.ki67inbreastcancerwg.org/; accessed 
on 18 July, 2023). The analysis was run on the entire inva­
sive tumor area of the whole slide image (WSI) and output 
as a global Ki67 score (%). A few cases without digitized 
Ki67 slide available (N = 22) were manually evaluated by 
the global scoring method [44]. The cut-offs applied in the 
national guidelines were used for three-tier groups: Ki67-
low (< 6%), Ki67-intermediate (6–29%), and Ki67-high 
(> 29%) [6].
Stratipath Breast analysis
Stratipath Breast (Stratipath AB, Solna, Sweden) is a com­
mercial CE-IVD marked deep learning-based image anal­
ysis tool for risk stratification of breast cancer patients. 
HE-stained slides of FFPE tissue sections were retrieved 
and subsequently digitized in-house with a Hamamatsu 
NanoZoomer XR at 40X magnification (0.226 μm/pixel). 
Each HE-stained WSI was analysed by Stratipath Breast 
(version 1.1). The image analysis model encompasses con­
secutive steps including quality assessment, cancer detec­
tion and risk stratification. Twenty-three images did not meet 
the intrinsic quality control of the Stratipath Breast analysis 
and were excluded from subsequent analysis (Supplemen­
tary Fig. S1). In addition, for two cases the WSIs were not 
available for Stratipath Breast analysis. All Stratipath Breast 
analysis reports underwent pathologist review to verify that 
adequate tumor area was analysed as part of quality control, 
and cases that did not meet this requirement were excluded 
(N = 14; Supplementary Fig. S1) and is in line with the 
manufacturer’s instructions for use (Stratipath AB). For 
each case Stratipath Breast provides a two-tier risk group; 
low risk or high risk, together with a continuous risk score 
(research use only).
Statistical analysis
Descriptions of agreements between two risk stratification 
approaches were reported by the actual number and percent­
age, and Cohen’s kappa was used for two-group compari­
sons. The differences in distribution of patients belonging 
to each risk group, with respect to categorical clinical vari­
ables, were evaluated by the Fisher’s Exact test when the 
minimum number of patients in a subgroup was less than 
5, or by the chi-square test otherwise. For comparing differ­
ences in continuous variables that were not assumed to be 
normally distributed, the Mann-Whitney U test (compari­
son across two groups) and Kruskal-Wallis test (comparison 
across more than two groups) were used. The correlation 
between continuous scores were calculated with Spear­
man correlation. All statistical analyses were 2-sided, and 
a P value of less than 0.05 was regarded as significant. The 
above statistical analyses were performed in IBM SPSS 
Statistics (version 28.0; IBM, Armonk, New York, USA). 
Changes in classification between tests were visualized by 
Sankey diagrams in https://jsfiddle.net.

In total 36 cases showed two-level discordant risk cat­
egory (low and high) by the two tests (Supplementary Table 
S4). There were 24 Stratipath-high, Prosigna-low cases, 
which all were grade 2 or 3, node negative and luminal A. 
Among the 12 Stratipath-low, Prosigna-high cases there was 
a mix of all grades, all but one case was luminal B, and there 
was a higher proportion of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC; 
33.3%) and invasive mucinous carcinoma (IMC; 16.7%) 
than in the opposite two-level discordant group (16.7% ILC 
and 0% IMC). Upon review, two of the Stratipath-low, Pro­
signa-high cases had incorrectly reported tumor size, which 
may have altered the ROR score and Prosigna risk category 
if re-tested.
Clinicopathological characteristics across Stratipath 
risk groups
When comparing the distribution of clinical variables in 
each risk group, there was a significant difference in distri­
bution of grade (p < 0.001), Ki67 status (p = 0.004), histo­
logic subtype (p = 0.002) and intrinsic subtype (p < 0.001) 
across Stratipath risk groups, but no difference regarding PR 
status, lymph node status or tumor size (Table 4). The major­
ity of grade 1 (10 of 12) and grade 3 (37 of 46) tumors were 
stratified as Stratipath low risk and high risk, respectively. 
There was a significant difference in the distribution of Ki67 
score across Stratipath risk groups, with higher Ki67 scores 
in the high-risk than the low-risk group (Mann-Whitney U 
test p = 0.001; Fig. 2A). Among grade 2 cases, no difference 
in Ki67 score was observed between Stratipath risk groups 
(Mann-Whitney U test p = 0.058; Fig. 2B). For the group 
of grade 2 tumors, only histologic subtype (p = 0.010) and 
intrinsic subtype (p < 0.001) differed significantly between 
the Stratipath risk groups (Supplementary Table S5). ILC 
accounted for 17.9% of the tumors and 29 of the 42 (69.0%) 
ILC tumors were classified as low risk by Stratipath Breast, 
with even higher proportion among grade 2 cases (22.2% 
ILC and 74.4% of ILC as low risk). Among Prosigna 
intermediate-risk cases, a significant difference between 
Stratipath low-risk and high-risk groups was identified for 
score was 24.5% (range 3.85–75.2%) by digital global scor­
ing method. Out of all included tumors, the Prosigna assay 
classified 76 (32.5%), 110 (47.0%) and 48 (20.5%) tumors 
as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively. The median 
ROR score was 47 with a range from 3 to 84. The Prosigna 
intrinsic molecular subtypes were distributed as follows: 
127 (54.3%) luminal A, 107 (45.7%) luminal B, 0 (0%) 
HER2-enriched and 0 (0%) basal-like. Notably, one patient 
had more than three lymph node metastases.
Comparison between the tests for risk stratification
The Stratipath Breast analysis identified 116 (49.6%) 
tumors as low risk and 118 (50.4%) as high risk. Among 
Prosigna intermediate-risk tumors, 52 (47.3%) were strati­
fied as low risk and 58 (52.7%) as high risk by Stratipath 
Breast (Fig. 1A; Table 2). In addition, 24 (31.6%) of the 
76 Prosigna low-risk cases were upgraded as high-risk by 
Stratipath Breast, whereas 12 (25.0%) of the 48 Prosigna 
high-risk cases were downgraded by Stratipath Breast 
(Fig. 1B; Tables 2 and 3). The overall agreement between the 
two tests for low-risk and high-risk groups was 71.0%, with 
a Cohen’s kappa of 0.42. Prosigna intermediate-risk results 
were not included in the overall agreement estimate as it is 
non-informative for treatment decision making. However, 
when grouping Prosigna low and intermediate risk together, 
out of the 116 Stratipath low-risk cases 104 (89.7%) were 
Prosigna low/intermediate risk and 12 (10.3%) were high 
risk (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Table S1).
Among the 176 histologic grade 2 tumors, 97 (55.1%) 
and 79 (44.9%) were stratified as Stratipath low risk and 
high risk, respectively, whereas 66 (37.5%), 83 (47.2%) and 
27 (15.3%) were stratified as Prosigna low, intermediate 
and high risk, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). The 
agreement between the two tests for low-risk and high-risk 
groups among grade 2 cases was 68.8%, with a Cohen’s 
kappa of 0.39. The grade 2 cases showed similar propor­
tions of discordant risk categories as among all cases (Sup­
plementary Table S3).

ROR score and intrinsic subtype across Stratipath 
risk groups
ROR scores were higher in the Stratipath high-risk group 
compared to the low-risk group (p < 0.001), across all cases 
as well as in the Prosigna intermediate-risk group and 
among grade 2 cases (Fig. 3). Regarding the distribution of 
intrinsic subtypes, a total of 83 out of 127 (65.4%) luminal 
A cases were classified as Stratipath low risk and 74 of 107 
(69.2%) luminal B cases as Stratipath high risk (Fig. 1D, 
Supplementary Table S9) and similar results were observed 
among grade 2 cases (Supplementary Table S10). A signifi­
cant difference in distribution of Prosigna intrinsic subtypes 
across Stratipath risk groups and Prosigna risk groups was 
identified for all cases as well as for grade 2 cases (Chi-
square test and Fisher exact test p < 0.001; Table 4, Supple­
mentary Table S5).
Discussion
In this study we show the first clinical comparison between 
the AI-based tool Stratipath Breast and the well-established 
multigene assay Prosigna for risk profiling of clinically 
intermediate-risk breast cancer. The agreement between the 
two tests reached 71.0% (Cohen’s kappa of 0.42) for clas­
sifying patients as low risk and high risk. This considerable 
overall agreement between Stratipath Breast and Prosigna, 
two methodologically different tests, is on a similar level to 
what has been observed previously with respect to agree­
ment between different multigene assays [25]. In a com­
parison of multigene tests in the OPTIMA Prelim trial, the 
overall agreement between Prosigna risk group and Onco­
type DX recurrence score (Exact Sciences, Madison, USA) 
was 81.0% for low and high risk groups and 77.5% for low/
intermediate and high risk groups [25]. A disagreement in 
this range is expected since these assays are based on differ­
ent models, gene sets and clinical variables. Although dem­
onstrating robust prognostic value on a population level, 
discrepancies on the individual patient level are evident 
when different multigene assays are performed on the same 
tumor sample [1, 12].
Risk profiling of breast cancer, by e.g., the Prosigna 
assay, is currently an integrated part of clinical routine 
diagnostics for clinically intermediate-risk early breast can­
cer patients. This is crucial to avoid inadequate treatment, 
especially for ambiguous cases where traditional biomark­
ers are insufficient to predict if patients would benefit from 
e.g., additional adjuvant chemotherapy or could be spared 
grade (p = 0.002) and lymph node status (p = 0.013; Supple­
mentary Table S6).
Among the 116 Stratipath low-risk cases, 88 (75.9%) 
were Ki67-low/intermediate and 28 (24.1%) were Ki67-
high (Supplementary Table S7). In total, 37.6% of all cases 
were both Stratipath low risk and Ki67-low/intermediate. 
Furthermore, 95.5% of the Stratipath low-risk group with 
Ki67-low/intermediate was Prosigna low or intermediate 
risk (Supplementary Table S7). Turning to the Stratipath 
high-risk group, two of the 50 (4.0%) Ki67-high cases were 
classified as Prosigna low risk (Supplementary Table S8).
Clinicopathological characteristics across Prosigna 
risk groups
Across Prosigna risk groups, a significant difference in dis­

status (p < 0.001), tumor size (p = 0.001) and intrinsic sub­
type (p < 0.001) was observed (Table  4) and Ki67 status, 
tumor size, lymph node status and intrinsic subtype all 
remained significant among grade 2 cases (Supplementary 
Table S5). There was no difference in the distribution of his­
tologic subtype between Prosigna risk groups.
Regarding Ki67 score, a significant difference in distri­
bution of Ki67 score across all Prosigna risk groups was 
observed (Kruskal-Wallis test adjusted p < 0.001; Fig. 2C). 
Among grade 2 cases there was a difference in distribution 
of Ki67 score across the three Prosigna risk groups (Kruskal-
Wallis test p < 0.001) with a significant difference between 
low vs. intermediate risk (adjusted p < 0.001) and low vs. 
high risk (adjusted p < 0.001), but not between intermedi­
ate vs. high risk (adjusted p = 0.126; Fig. 2D). In addition, 
Ki67 score showed a significant correlation with ROR score

adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, when assessing Ki67 
as a clinical factor together with Stratipath Breast, 95.5% 
of the Stratipath low-risk with Ki67-low/intermediate cases 
were also Prosigna low/intermediate risk. This supports the 
use of additional AI-based risk profiling to identify those 
patients that can be spared from chemotherapy, assuming 
that other risk factors are in alignment. Furthermore, dif­
ferences in intrinsic subtype were observed not only in the 
Prosigna risk groups but also between Stratipath risk groups 
with higher proportion of luminal A tumors in the low-risk 
and luminal B tumors in the high-risk group.
Special resources at the individual pathology laboratory 
are required for running the Prosigna assay on the nCounter 
platform, including tissue preparation by macrodissection 
of invasive tumor region and sectioning prior to analyses. In 
chemotherapy. We observed a higher proportion of all cases 
classified as low risk by Stratipath Breast (49.6%) than 
by Prosigna (32.5%), which may impact treatment deci­
sion to spare patients of chemotherapy. However, as Pro­
signa also provides an intermediate-risk group, which in 
this study constituted of almost half of the cases (47%), the 
risk information remains inconclusive for these patients in 
guiding treatment decisions. Our findings also showed that 
Stratipath Breast classified a high proportion (47.3%) of the 
Prosigna intermediate-risk group as low risk. In addition, 
the majority (89.6%) of the Stratipath low-risk cases were 
found in the Prosigna low/intermediate-risk group, which is 
the patient group where adjuvant endocrine therapy alone is 
generally considered, depending on local routines. The Pro­
signa high-risk group is generally considered candidates for

by deep learning, studies have shown that it is feasible to 
predict RNA expression profiles [34, 46], DNA mutations 
[47], intra-tumoral heterogeneity [31] or intrinsic subtypes 
[36] directly from HE-stained slides. Further, by leveraging 
grade-related feature extraction, deep learning has shown 
the ability to stratify grade 2 tumors into a low- and high-
risk group [27].
The AI-based image-analysis tool used in this study 
extracts information based on the morphological appearance 
in the HE-stained tumor WSI to determine the patient’s risk 
category. Histopathological variables including histologic 
subtype and tumor grade showed significant different distri­
bution between low-risk and high-risk groups by Stratipath 
Breast. The deep learning model has capacity to capture 
a range of representations/features, that are grade-related, 
comparison, Stratipath Breast is a fully automated decision 
support tool which operates on digitized routine HE-stained 
slides, thus, limited additional workload apart for the digiti­
zation of routine slides is required, ensuring a considerably 
reduced turnaround time and cost.
The heterogeneous nature of breast cancer and especially 
inter-tumoral heterogeneity of histologic grade 2 tumors has 
been illustrated by gene expression analysis (DNA microar­
ray), which shows that these tumors constitute of a mixture 
of gene expression patterns found in grade 1 and 3 tumors 
[22]. The gene expression signature, Genomic Grade Index, 
was further developed and has shown prognostic potential 
to more accurately divide histologic grade 2 into a low- and 
high-risk group associated with risk of recurrence [22, 23, 
45]. Leveraging the capacity of automated feature extraction

is in line with previous findings [24]. A significant associa­
tion between Prosigna risk categories and Ki67 status was 
observed in all patients, and in low- vs. intermediate-risk 
groups and in low- vs. high-risk groups in the grade 2 sub­
group. For Stratipath Breast, Ki67 was significantly differ­
ent between low- and high-risk groups when evaluating 
all patients but not in the subset of grade 2 tumors. This is 
not unexpected since the PAM50 gene assay incorporates 
eleven proliferation relative genes, and while Stratipath 
Breast does not explicitly include any information on pro­
liferation, the AI-based approach has the capacity to capture 
proliferation associated morphological patterns in the WSIs.
Strengths of this study are that the CE-IVD marked com­
mercial form of both tests was used and in a clinical case 
series from two sites in the intended patient population. 
However, the study has several limitations. One limitation 
to the study is the lack of follow-up information for prog­
nostic comparisons but this was outside of the scope for this 
study and may instead be evaluated in future studies. Nei­
ther was treatment information available for evaluations of 
the effect on treatment decisions. Another limitation is that 
the Prosigna assay categorizes a relatively large proportion 
of the cases as intermediate risk, which is non-informative 
for decision making and was thus excluded in several com­
parisons focusing on the two-level agreement (low and high 
risk), and we note that this is an intrinsic limitation of the 
Prosigna assay.
To conclude, in this study of clinically assessed interme­
diate-risk ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancers, we 
observed a considerable agreement between Prosigna and 
but other than the actual subcomponents routinely identi­
fied by the pathologist when determining Nottingham his­
tologic grade (i.e., tubular formation, pleomorphism and 
mitotic count) [27]. Here, we showed that histologic grade 
was associated with both Stratipath Breast risk groups and 
Prosigna risk groups. The association with tumor grade has 
been shown for several multigene assays [48–51] and tumor 
grade has also been incorporated in prognostic index (Not­
tingham Px) for prognostic stratification of the clinically 
intermediate-risk group of breast cancer (node negative ER-
positive/HER2-negative) [52].
To establish the risk category, Stratipath Breast utilizes 
only the WSI as input, i.e., without incorporating other clin­
ical variables. On the contrary, several of the clinical vari­
ables shown to be significantly different between Prosigna 
risk groups in this study, are included in the ROR score. The 
PAM50 gene expression of the tumor sample designates 
the intrinsic subtype and is combined with a proliferation 
score and tumor size to calculate the ROR score [53]. Apart 
from the apparent methodological difference in the tests, it 
may be speculated that these differences in modalities could 
explain the discordances to some extent.
Differences in the prognostic performance between dif­
ferent assays can be explained by several factors, including 
different molecular markers included in the gene signature 
assays, where the Prosigna ROR score is largely deter­
mined by proliferative features whereas others are driven 
by ER-related features [51]. We found a significant correla­
tion between the proliferation marker Ki67 and ROR score 
(Spearman’s rho 0.596) in this clinical case series, which
