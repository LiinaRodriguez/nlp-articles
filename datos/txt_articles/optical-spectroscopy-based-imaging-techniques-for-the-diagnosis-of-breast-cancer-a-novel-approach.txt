Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women, with 2 million cases
diagnosed annually and over 600,000 fatalities.[1,2] In developed countries, the incidence
is higher compared to developing countries; however, the case fatality rate in developed
countries is lower than in developing countries.[1,2] Data from Globocan 2018, IARC
shows that out of 2,088,849 new breast cancer cases reported globally, the incidence rate
in high income and low-middle income countries was 823,638 (39%) and 444,728 (21%)

respectively; however, the mortality was 178,554 (8.5%) and 205,691 (9.8%) respect-
ively.[1,2] A significant reason for this difference is due to the diagnosis of breast cancer
at an early stage in high-income countries; however, high level of population-based
screening facilities for early detection of breast cancer in low-middle income countries
are also materializing.[3,4]
Currently, the methods for diagnosis of breast cancer, whether in a symptomatic or a
screening situation are clinical breast examination, imaging with X-ray mammography
and ultrasound as well as tissue diagnosis using a needle biopsy. The most common
tool used for screening for breast cancer is X-ray mammography has been reported to
have sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 97% respectively.[5] However, X-Ray mam-
mography’s sensitivity and specificity reduce significantly to 67% and 89% respectively
for mammographically dense (relatively radiopaque) breasts.[5,6] Moreover, X-Ray mam-
mography is expensive, hospital-based, involves small radiation risks, and is less accur-
ate in younger women, under 50.[7–12] Contrast enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) is reported to have the highest sensitivity between 93% and 100%;[13,14] but is
costly, the equipment is bulky and expensive, and needs to be hospital-based.
Ultrasonography[15–17] does not use ionizing radiation, but requires a skilled operator
and is less accurate and less reproducible[18,19] compared to X-ray mammography.
Thermography is highly sensitive to ambient and temperature fluctuation, resulting in
high false-positive rates,[20–22] low accuracy,[23] and is not used in clinical practice.
Diverse optical and non-optical spectroscopy techniques are used to diagnose breast
cancer. The optical spectroscopy techniques involve Transillumination Imaging (TI),
Diffuse Optical Imaging (DOI), Raman spectroscopy, and Fluorescence spectroscopy,
while non-optical spectroscopy comprises of microwave spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and molecular mass spectroscopy. The review gives a
detailed analysis on optical spectroscopy techniques such as Transillumination Imaging
and Diffuse Optical Imaging, which have the potential to be translated to rapid diagnos-
tic tools for breast cancer.
Optical properties of tissue, e.g., absorption and scattering coefficients, have been studied
thoroughly[24–27] where the differences in optical properties of breast cancer and normal tissue
could potentially be used to diagnose cancer. Spectroscopy instruments measuring optical
properties use visible to near-infrared (NIR) light (wavelength from 600nm to 1100nm)
which propagates through the tissue. As it propagates, there is photon diffusion and scattering
and the difference in local blood supply that accompanies cancer leads to higher absorption as
compared to the adjacent normal tissue, resulting in distinguishable contrast between the
tumor to normal tissue in the acquired image,[25,28] which forms a basis for tumor detection.
Such optical detection uses spectroscopy techniques such as Transillumination Imaging (TI)
and Diffuse Optical Imaging (DOI). Transillumination imaging has been studied using a com-
mercial tool such as Breastlight[29,30] and has been found to have varying sensitivities between
60% and 93% for breast cancer detection, primarily due to the dependency on the skill of the
clinician to visually analyze the transillumination images.[28,30–36] Mehnati et al.[37] and Edge
et al.[38] critically review the transillumination imaging for breast screening and recommended
performing more clinical trials.
Spectroscopy based imaging technique such as Diffuse Optical Imaging (DOI) has
several theoretical advantages over simple transillumination. DOI can map the relative

concentration of different tissue constituents such as oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO),
deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR), total hemoglobin (HbT), lipid (L), water (H2O), and
collagen (C) along with bulk tissue properties such as absorption coefficient (ma),
reduced scattering coefficient (ms), oxygen saturation (SO2), and tissue oxygenation
index (TOI). These parameters can be used as multiple biomarkers to improve accuracy
of delineation between normal and abnormal cases.[39–41] However, DOI techniques are
still lab-based, expensive, and provide lower resolution images as compared to X-Ray
mammography due to comparatively higher scattering of infrared photons within the
breast tissue.[42] Tromberg et al. was the first to review the DOI system as a potential
diagnostic technique,[43] followed by Godavarty et al., specifically proposing the hand-
held optical imaging systems as a potential tool for quick diagnosis of breast cancer in
the field.[44] However, other configurations such as parallel-plate and bed-based techni-
ques may have a better potential to be translated as a rapid diagnostic tool and are also
discussed in this review.
The challenges of such an approach include variation of breast volume between
patients, acquisition time, and automatic interpretation of results. In this review, we
assess different cancer biomarkers that could be used to delineate between tumor and
normal cases. The TI and DOI systems are analyzed with an engineering perspective,
including its mechanical, electronics, optics, and ergonomic design. Detailed analysis is
performed on different configurations of the lab based DOI systems giving higher sensi-
tivity, albeit with a comparatively small patient sample size. The review also discusses
the application of machine learning techniques in DOI based system for automated
interpretation of results. Finally, the design of opto-electronics components, which plays
a vital role in the overall development cost of the DOI system is discussed.
Low cost rapid diagnosis of breast cancer
Challenges involved in breast cancer diagnosis at low-resource settings
Various challenges of application of the diagnostic tool in low-resource settings include
proficiency in imaging breasts with different volume and density, cost, portability, auto-
matic interpretation of results, and optimization of parameters, e.g., time to examine
each patient, adequate sensitivity, and specificity.
Breast volume and density variation
One of the pressing challenges when manufacturing a device for breast imaging is its
adaptability[45] to accommodate the variation of breast volume between 200 and 1500 cc
and breast surface area varying from 100 to 500cm2[46–48] while maintaining sensitivity.
Moreover, variation in breast texture between patients,[43,49] or due to the menstrual
cycle[50] is also a concern.
Accurate diagnosis of cancer even when the tumor is very small
The diagnostic tool should have high contrast and resolution to be adequately sensitive to
detect cancer at an early stage.[51–54] However, the holy grail is the ability to differentiate
between early cancers that may never grow and those that could potentially spread and

be lethal. Additionally, while detecting these early cancers, the tool should be capable to
distinguish between breast abnormalities due to the patient’s age, physiological factors,
hormonal changes and other abnormalities caused by cancer.[55,56] Finally, for a tool to be
useful, the sensitivity and specificity need to be high and well quantified.[42,44,57–59]
Reducing human input and cost
Highly trained human resource is necessary for the current approaches to breast cancer
diagnosis, including surgeons, radiographers, radiologists, and pathologists. Furthermore,
the intimate examination may lead to hesitancy in women with some socio-cultural back-
grounds.[55,60,61] If a diagnostic tool requires much less human input, it may be more
cost-effective, less time consuming as well as more acceptable in certain cultures.
Therefore, a machine learning algorithm with segmentation and classification algorithms
could help to differentiate between normal and abnormal cases automatically.
Portability
A tool that is portable and battery operated will facilitate its use in remote locations in
the developed world as well as in low and middle-income countries.[28,32–35,37]
The complete wish-list of the requirements of a practical tool for the rapid diagnosis
of breast cancer is shown in Table 1.
Spectroscopy based techniques to diagnose breast cancer
The spectroscopy techniques can be classified as optical and non-optical based on the
operating wavelength and the type of source used in the technique.
The optical spectroscopy techniques include Transillumination Imaging (TI), Diffuse
Optical
Imaging
(DOI),
Raman
spectroscopy,
and
Fluorescence
spectroscopy.
Transillumination Imaging has been studied extensively for breast cancer screening in
Egypt, Iran, Iraq, and Ghana.[28,29,31–35] While DOI is still lab-based, it is touted to be a
promising technique to be used for breast cancer screening in the future.[43,80] The DOI
system is classified as parallel plate geometry, bed-based, and handheld probe techni-
ques, based on the arrangement of the source and detector. Zhao et al.[81] compare bed-
based DOI images (Figure 1a–e) with MRI T2 images, while Ghartey et al.[28] visually
analyze the transillumination image for breast cancer detection (Figure 1f). More

and
Fluorescence spectroscopy.
Raman spectroscopy is used to detect the Stokes and anti-Stokes scattered photons to
quantify chemical composition. This technique is highly sensitive to detect breast can-
cer; however, it is highly sophisticated and expensive to be deployed at large scale.
Fluorescence spectroscopy uses endogenous and exogenous chromophores to re-emit
the absorbed photons with a distinct spectral response. Fluorescence spectroscopy using
exogenous chromophores such as indocyanine green (ICG) needs to be injected intra-
venously,[82] which makes the technique invasive, and there are concerns of an allergic
reaction due to the presence of sodium iodide in ICG.[83] Fluorescence spectroscopy
using endogenous chromophores such as collagen, elastin, and hemoglobin is noninva-
sive; however, this technique uses sophisticated optical tools to measure sensitive fluor-
escence signals, which makes it practically difficult to be used at large scale.[84–86]
The non-optical spectroscopy techniques used to diagnose breast cancer include
microwave spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy, and
molecular mass spectrometry. The microwave spectroscopy uses non-ionizing micro-
wave radiation; however, the technique suffers from low contrast between healthy and
malignant fibroglandular tissues. Additionally, the shorter wavelength and significant
tissue conductivity limit the penetration depth of the microwave radiation.[87–89] The
NMR spectroscopy uses non-ionizing radiofrequency radiation to quantify the compos-
ition of chemical biomarkers within the breast tissue, such as phosphocholine, which is
about ten times more in cancer tissues as compared to normal tissues. However, the
NMR technique suffers from lower sensitivity, and the equipment is expensive.[90–92]
The molecular mass spectrometry with the recent advancement of ambient ionization
technology provides the molecular signature for differentiating between normal and
cancerous regions within the breast; however, the technique is destructive and invasive,
and hence appropriate only for advanced diagnosis of breast cancer, such as intraopera-
tive margin assessment.[93–95] The complete analysis of different types of spectroscopy
techniques are showcased in Table 2.

Transillumination imaging (TI) systems
The transillumination method has been extensively studied for breast cancer diagnosis,
as TI based systems are cost-effective, portable and easy to operate.[28–35] In the trans-
illumination method, the handheld probe (Figure 2a) consisting of few LEDs, is placed
under the breast (Figure 2b), while the skilled clinician analyzes the transilluminated
view of the breast (Figure 1f).[28] The transilluminated view consists of the light propa-
gating through the breast tissue and the blood vessels. As the LEDs are operated at
about 620 nm, overlapping with the absorption peak of red blood cells, the blood vessels
appear as dark and tissue appears as light pink or red. In addition to any abnormality
of blood vessel diameter, dark patches in the breast tissue due to an abnormality also
become a basis for tumor detection.
Vaidya et al.[30] reported the use of Breastlight from a survey of 1500 women, where
1054 returned with their feedback, out of which 3 had mammogram and 1 was diag-
nosed with cancer. They found that the use of Breastlight did not raise the anxiety nor
did it detract women from seeking medical advice. Iwuchukwu et al.[36] screened 300
women and detected 12 out of 18 malignant cases using Breastlight in a screening per-
formed in UK with a sensitivity and specificity of 67% and 85% respectively. Labib
et al.[34] screened 310 women in Egypt, reporting sensitivity as high as 93% and specificity
of 73.7%. Al-Alwan et al.[31] screened 150 women in Iraq, reported a sensitivity of

80.56%. However, the device reported a low specificity of 53.47% and high false positives
(46.53%). Shiryazdi et al.[33,35] screened 500 women in Iran, specifically young women
(<30), for whom the use of mammography is inadvisable. The sensitivity of 60.3% and
specificity of 92.5% was reported for the device and domiciliary use of the device was
proposed as an alternative technique to BSE. Aliasghar et al.[32] screened 100 samples in
Iraq and suggested that the technique shouldn’t be used exclusively due to high false-posi-
tive (46%) and low sensitivity (66.66%), specificity (51.06%) and accuracy (52%). Ghartey
et al.[28] screened 2204 women in Ghana and reported a sensitivity of 92.3% with the
device as compared to 73% with CBE; however, specificity remains unreported
(Figure5a–c). We agree with other authors[37,38] that there is a need for more clinical tri-
als before using the transillumination method as a rapid diagnostic tool as it does offer a
potentially accurate tool that is inexpensive and very easy to use. The varying sensitivity
showcases the need for the rapid diagnostic tool which can delineate between normal and
abnormal breast based on biomarkers such as hemoglobin, lipids, collagen, water and tis-
sue properties such as absorption coefficient, reduced scattering coefficient, oxygen satur-
ation, and tissue oxygenation index. The sample size, age group of subjects, and
performance parameters of the studies discussed in this section are tabulated in Table 3.
Diffuse optical imaging (DOI) systems
The DOI systems are based on either continuous wave (CW), frequency domain (FD),
or time-domain (TD) operation. However, considering the cost-effective requirement of
rapid diagnosis, we only review those CW and FD systems performed on large-scale
clinical trials, while averting the TD systems due to its comparatively higher develop-
ment cost.[97] The CW system can be developed with lower instrumentation cost as
compared to the FD system, primarily due to the requirement of network analyzer,
advance laser/led driver, and bias network.[98] In this section, we analyze the parallel
plate, bed-based and handheld DOI systems tested on large sample size in-vivo detection
of breast cancer with the perspective of rapid diagnosis and summarized in Table 4.

Parallel plate-based DOI system
The parallel plate technique involves an array of source and detectors attached to two
adjacent parallel plates with a distance separating them for the placement of breast, simi-
lar to the parallel plate technique of X-Ray mammography. The patient can sit on a chair
or stand upright while placing the breast within the expanded parallel plate. The parallel
plate compresses the breast with a specific pressure to begin the acquisition process.
Carp et al.[99] assessed a total of 17 patients by performing compression induced
hemodynamic analysis, with the discriminating factor as total hemoglobin (higher in
tumor), oxygenated hemoglobin, and saturated oxygen. The sensitivity and specificity of
the system was reported to be 88% and 70% respectively. The bottom plate of the sys-
tem was fixed, while the upper plate could be moved vertically, with forces ranging
from 0 to 55 N, to study compression dependent hemodynamics (Figure 3a, b). The
compression was measured using strain gauge fixed to the upper plate. The system used
a periodic cycle to perform coupled continuous wave (CW) and frequency domain (FD)
operation, with a total acquisition time of about 7 mins. Mastanduno et al.[115] dealt
explicitly with the variation in breast volume by adjusting to breasts with different cup
sizes. The system involved three parallel plates with 6 degrees of freedom to consider
different breast volume.
Anderson et al.[100] specifically developed a cost-effective CW system, most suitable
for rapid diagnosis of breast cancer. An assessment of 26 patients was reported by
optical characterization of breast and creation of breast maps. As compared to the sur-
rounding tissues, the tumor regions had a higher concentration of hemoglobin and
water, along with lower lipid concentration and oxygen saturation. Anderson et al.[101]
further assessed 80 patients with oxygenation saturation maps and used the Dice coeffi-
cient as a main discriminating factor.
Bed based DOI system
The bed-based systems are adapted from the parallel plate configuration, where the
patient lies in a prone position with breast pendant in a chamber enclosed by parallel
plates. The breast is usually immersed in a scattering fluid, having a similar refractive
index that of fatty breast tissue.[116] The chamber holding the fluid and breast is sur-
rounded by an array of sources and detectors, embedded within the plates. The fluid
mainly consists of intralipid and/or India ink which has a similar refractive index to
that of breast tissue so that the photons getting scattered within the breast do not

tions,[105] replacing the scattering fluid with an arrangement of optical fibers to get dir-
ect contact with the breast surface.
The system proposed by Choe et al.[40] consisted of a fixed plate and a movable com-
pression plate. Based on the size of the breast, the compression plate could be moved
between 5.5 cm to 7.5 cm (Figure 4d). The total acquisition time for a single breast took
about 12 mins. The study assessed a total of 51 patients and reported the sensitivity and
specificity of 98% and 90% respectively. The cancer regions were reported higher total
hemoglobin, oxygenated hemoglobin, and scattering coefficient as compared to normal
cases. Busch et al.[104] expanded Choe et al. system[40] and converted the 2D images
into 3D DOT (Diffuse Optical Tomography) images using multiparameter, multivoxel

and multisubject statistical analysis to overcome the image artifacts. The study reported
the assessment of 35 patients with a sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 94%, with
HbT contrast ratio (T/N) cutoff of 1.2.
The system proposed by Wang, James et al.[103] reported higher absorption coefficient,
reduced scattering coefficient, and refractive index in tumor regions as compared to the
surrounding regions. The system was based on the work by Iftimia et al.,[102] which took
about 4 minutes for the acquisition of an image. The specificity and accuracy of the sys-
tem developed by Iftimia et al.,[102] was improved by Wang, James et al.[103] by the
employment of machine learning algorithm (support vector machine classification) for
automated delineation of normal and tumor cases. The study[103] assessed a total of 33
patients and reported the sensitivity and specificity of 81.8% and 91.7% respectively.
Pogue et al.[24] assessed a total of 39 healthy patients and quantified hemoglobin con-
centration, oxygen saturation, water, absorption, and scattering coefficient. The system
used optical fibers to deliver the light source directly to the breast surface. Sixteen
optical fibers were arranged circularly to cover the breast surface uniformly. The vari-
ation of breast volume was adjusted by varying the diameter of this circular arrange-
ment. The acquisition time for a single breast took about 5 mins. Force transducers
were placed explicitly for safety as well to measure optical images based on different
applied pressures. Wang, Jia et al.[105] extended this approach by using a coupled fre-
quency domain (FD) and continuous wave (CW) operation along with a broadband
light source with a reasonable development cost. The study reported more accurate tis-
sue constituents with this coupled approach as compared to FD data alone. The study
assessed 9 patients and reported 1.5 to 2-fold increase in water and hemoglobin concen-
tration in the tumor as compared to the surrounding normal region. The study also
reported lower lipid concentration in lipid as compared to the normal region.
Ban et al.[71] introduced real-time camera-based DOT technique to quantify tissue
properties along with 3D image reconstruction of the breast. The camera could detect
any error rising due to motion artifacts. The system was extended by Cochran
et al.,[107] an assessment of 222 patients was done and the accuracy of 86% was
reported. The FD system developed by Zhao et al.[106]consisted of a movable football-
shaped fiber breast interface to facilitate different breast volume. The system reported
an assessment of 11 patients with hemoglobin and water contrast ratios of 1.4 and 1.2
respectively (Figure 4a–c). The acquisition time in this system of about 90 sec was
reduced to 55 sec in the updated system[81] by applying a prospective gain setting
scheme. The updated system reported an increase of contrast in total hemoglobin to 1.7
by the inclusion of the collagen concentration in image reconstruction.
Handheld based DOI system
Unlike X-Ray mammography, the Diffuse Optical Imaging (DOI) system use smaller
light sources and detectors that can be configured within a handheld system. The hand-
held probe is scanned point by point to cover the complete breast surface area. This pro-
cess increases acquisition time for both breasts, and hence, the handheld device is
primarily used in conjunction with complementary techniques, e.g., Ultrasound[41,108,117]
12
U. M. PAL ET AL.
and X-Ray.[113] With the help of such complementary techniques, the operator can focus
on a specific suspicious breast area for higher image contrast and resolution.
Zhu et al.[108] assessed a total of 19 patients with an ultrasound-guided diffuse optical
imaging handheld probe. The study reported a 2-fold higher total hemoglobin in the
tumor as compared to the benign region. The system first localizes the lesion using
ultrasound and then scans the suspected region at higher resolution using DOI. Chen
et al.[117] expanded the system proposed by Zhu et al., by reducing the weight and con-
verting it into a portable system weighing 26.5 lb (12 kg) with an acquisition time of
about 5 minutes. Cheng et al.[109] assessed a total of 50 patients with a real-time time
continuous-wave handheld DOI probe, and reported the sensitivity and specificity of
92% and 67% respectively. The study reported a higher total hemoglobin and oxygen
saturation in tumor cases as compared to the normal.
The study by Chance et al.[110] used a multiwavelength LED at the center circularly
surrounded by eight detectors with a radius of 4 cm. This arrangement gave a circular
measurement area with a diameter of about 9 cm over the breast. The integration of a
pressure transducer preserved the accuracy by maintaining the pressure of 3 mmHg
throughout the measurement process. The study used hemoglobin concentration as a
main discriminating factor to identify the cancerous region. The system assessed a total
of 116 patients and reported the sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 93% respectively.
Cerussi et al.[111]proposed the handheld probe system which consisted of the source
optical fiber attached to a movable plastic attachment along with the casing of the probe
consisting of an Avalanche photodiode (APD) detector. This arrangement helped to meas-
ure data at different source-detector distances. The point by point scan was performed on a
line with a spacing of 10mm, and source-detector separation of 28mm. The study assessed
a total of 58 patients, and reported higher water, oxy- and deoxygenated hemoglobin (more
than 50% each), and lower lipid ( 20%) concentration in the tumor as compared to nor-
mal region. The study also reported TOI with a 2-fold contrast of malignant tissue as com-
pared to the surrounding regions. The system required prior knowledge of tumor location
through X-ray mammography. The system developed by O’Sullivan et al.[98] extended
Cerussi et al. work, by printing the PCB circuit thereby replacing the network analyzer with
equivalent accuracy while proving 5x faster acquisition time and 10x less cost (Figure 5d–f).
Kukreti et al.[112] introduced self-referencing differential spectroscopy technique to
report an absence or presence of molecular disposition in spectral fingerprint rather
than the molecular concentration. The study retrospectively assessed a total of 60
patients and used malignancy index (MI) as a discriminating factor, which was higher
in the malignant as compared to benign. The study reported a sensitivity and specificity
of 91% and 94% respectively. The system required the location of the tumor beforehand
using an ultrasound technique, and the probe was vertically scanned with a spacing of

93.33% respectively, and Mammography as 68.18% and 57.78% respectively. The DOT
and UE were reported to have higher specificity and accuracy as compared to conven-
tional mammography. The DOT images were recorded using a scanner (Xinao-MDT,
APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY REVIEWS

Beijing, China) and used discriminating factors as total hemoglobin concentration (high
in tumor) and oxygen saturation (low in tumor).
Gonzalez et al.[118,119] introduced a fork design (Gen-2 system) which performed
sequential and simultaneous bilateral reflectance and transmittance measurements. The
probe head (4  5 cm2) was flexible to conform to breast tissue surfaces with minimal
compression. The probe head was integrated with 3 source fibers and 96 detector fiber
connected to the laser source and ICCD camera. Erickson et al.[72] compared the Gen-2
system proposed by Gonzalez et al.[118,119] with an updated Gen-1 system, using a flex-
ible probe head (4  9 cm2) with 6 source fibers and 165 detector fibers. Real-time
images with an updated Gen-1 system were gathered with processing time for each
image of about 2 seconds. The study by Erickson et al.[72] assessed a total of 5 patients
using the discriminating factor as total hemoglobin concentration (higher in tumor).
Zhu et al.[41] assessed a total of 288 patients based on the different stages of breast
cancer (T1, T2, T4, Tis), and reported a sensitivity and specificity of 96.6%–100% and
77.3%–83.3% respectively. Mostafa et al.[114] proposed a real-time semi-automated pro-
cess that automatically identified tumor location and fed to the optical imaging recon-
struction process. The study assessed a total of 20 patients and reported the
discriminating factor as total hemoglobin concentration (high in tumor).
Challenges of different configurations of DOI systems for routine diagnostic
applications
The parallel plate techniques were the earliest studied configuration, because of its similarity
with mammography. The advantage of using this technique is the availability of the sophisti-
cated mechanical rail system that can facilitate breast volume variation. However, a signifi-
cant challenge faced by the parallel plate is the breast density variation of the compressed
breast within the plate area. When the breast is under compression using parallel plates, the

orthogonal density toward the chest will be relatively high. This gradient in density must be
taken into consideration while performing image reconstruction. Additionally, the compres-
sion of the breast causes pain and inconvenience to the patient.[100] Considering a large-scale
clinical trial, the mechanical parts of the system will be more prone to failure. Moreover,
due to the mechanical arrangement of the vertical railing, subtle vibration due to motion
artifacts while taking measurement also induces errors in the acquired image.[99]
The patient lying in a bed-based system is in a relaxed position, whether in a supine or
prone position. Moreover, the bed-based system has been reported to have sensitivity and
specificity of more than 90%.[40,104] However, a significant challenge using a bed based
system is using matching fluid-based chambers,[82,120] which is susceptible to spilling and
leakages. Additionally, due to the use of fluid, the issue of hygiene and cleanliness is also
a concern. Replacing the fluid-based chamber with a motion-based contact technique
requires maintaining optimal pressure and uniform contact with the breast surface, which
is a challenge. Additionally, considering large-scale clinical trial for rapid diagnosis, the
mechanical motion-based contact technique for different breast size is more prone to fail-
ure. Finally, the requirement of a specialized bed with chambers makes the system bulky
and decreases portability. The bed-based system can be configured in a modular way to
be deployed during the rapid diagnosis. Moreover, with the recent advancements of the
bed-based system, taking less than 1 minute[71,81] to perform imaging, the bed-based tech-
niques seem to be a promising configuration to be used as a rapid diagnostic tool.
The handheld system is a highly researched configuration and a promising technique to
be used in breast cancer diagnosis,[44] especially with the recent advancement of real-time
imaging of the breast.[72,109,114] The handheld systems are easy to use, portable and have
been reported with more than 90% sensitivity[41,109,110,112,113] and more than 90% specifi-
city.[110,112] However, the major challenge is the manual scanning process, where the oper-
ator has to scan point-by-point over the breast. The diagnosis involving large sample size,
an operator taking such measurements throughout the day would tend to make mistakes
and may skip the scanning points due to monotony, which can lead to errors while recon-
structing the images. Moreover, the non-uniformity of breast density/volume is a challenge
for handheld devices. As the number of sources is limited and the operator must vary the
scanning location manually, it is a challenge to automatically vary the intensity of the
source based on the breast density/volume, i.e., higher density orthogonally toward the
chest. Besides, the manual scanning process requires firm pressure to be applied by the
operator (3mm Hg) to obtain the required contact and manual control over this variable
by the operator can lead to inaccurate image.[110] The handheld system is a promising
technique to be used for rapid diagnosis; however, due to limited measurement area, the
tool can be advantageous and reliable along with complementary techniques such as ultra-
sound[41,108,117] and mammography.[113]
Automatic interpretation of results using machine learning
Transillumination imaging (TI) is performed by a visual interpretation of an image by a
skilled clinician; however, machine learning algorithms are yet to be applied in TI. While,
the automatic interpretation or detection of breast cancer using DOI has been performed
by reconstructing optical signals into images by inverse modeling the diffusion effect, as
showcased in-depth in this section. Segmentation and classification of the reconstructed

images are difficult due to the presence of noise, motion artifacts, and image degradation
because of short acquisition time. Researchers have used several machine learning meth-
ods to tackle the above problems and achieve high efficiency while performing different
segmentation and classification algorithms, as tabulated in Table 5. Considering the rapid
diagnosis, the machine learning algorithm needs to choose between these methods for
high quality and low artifact reconstruction of images.
In the latest development, McKinney et al.[125] used three independent Deep Learning
Methods (DLM) while training each method with data augmentation applied to each
image. Each model reported a cancer risk score between 0 and 1, while the final predic-
tion was based on the mean of the predictions from each of these models. The study
reported the use of AI resulted in a reduction of 1.21% in false-positive and 2.7% in
false-negative in datasets from UK. Wang et al.[103] utilized absorption and scattering
attributes along with a refractive index to isolate the lesion area. Based on mean coeffi-
cients and lesion area properties, and with the help of Support Vector Machine SVM,
the classification of the lesion as cancerous or non-cancerous was achieved with an
accuracy of 88.6%. Entropy and iterative selective methods rather than simple predeter-
mined threshold methods improved performance. Taroni et al.[39] examined different
tissue composition, i.e., water, hemoglobin, lipid, collagen, and their absorption parame-
ters as potential input features to a discrete Adaboost classifier to identify malignant
invasive ductal carcinomas. The type of collagen and the type of lesion had a significant
impact on the performance of the Adaboost classifier.[121]
Cochran et al.[107] used diffuse optical biomarkers’ optical properties in the frequency
domain as a feature to classify ductal and lobular invasive carcinomas against benign lesions
using Logistic Regression. According to Breneisen et al.,[122] the Energy Spectral Density
(ESD) can be used to differentiate malignant and healthy tissue, due to scattering properties
of the tissue. The respective ESDs of the scattered incident light was fed to a feed-forward
Neural Network (NN), which determined the grade of the lesion. A secondary NN was
developed to represent as a “critic” for indecisive cases from the primary feed-forward NN.
Barbour et al.[123] investigated hemoglobin signals from the tissue to characterize the
nature of the tissue. The oxygenated state and saturation of hemoglobin were given as
input features for finite Markov Chain to determine the grade of the lesion. Zhang
et al.[124] used Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS) to estimate the Blood Flow
Index (BFI), associated with tumors. The study compared three different methods: L1
norm, L2 Norm, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to estimate BFI, SVR proved to
be most efficient with an error rate of 2.23%.
Electronic design for DOI systems
The critical aspect of imaging is the contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. The
contrast and resolution of the image depend on the number and type of sources/detec-
tors and spacing between them. LASER or LED is used as a light source, the former
generating narrower beamwidth and bandwidth; however, its thermal reliability is a
concern. While, LED is comparatively cost-effective, reliable, and robust, but has wider
beamwidth and bandwidth. Additionally, a critical challenge is the unavailability of a

single detector that is capable to detect light of different wavelengths with the same
absolute sensitivity.
The choice of the operating wavelength is based on characterizing specific tissue bio-
marker, for e.g., selective absorption of oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemo-
globin occurs between 635 nm and 785, lipid absorption peak around 920 nm, water
absorption peak around 975 nm, and collagen absorption peak around 1060 nm.[39,126]
Additionally, considering rapid diagnosis, the development cost of the system should be
minimal, while being portable. The TD systems[97,116,127] reportedly have higher cost due
to expensive detector and source/detector driving system; however, FD[71,81,106,107,112] sys-
tems are reported as an alternative, still requiring costly instruments such as source modu-
lation driving circuit and biasing network; while low-cost alternative are considered as
CW[100–103,115] system albeit with lower information (i.e., no tissue scattering property).
The electronic design specifications for different configurations, such as parallel plate, bed-
based, and handheld probes, are tabulated in Table 6.

while modestly accurate, is complex and expensive. Thermography is not used in clin-
ical practice, and non-optical spectroscopy techniques such as microwave spectroscopy,
NMR spectroscopy, and molecular mass spectrometry have inherent or practical disad-
vantages making them unsuitable as a rapid diagnostic tool. Development of an inex-
pensive, portable tool that requires the least amount of human expertise to operate
could greatly improve the accessibility of women to high-quality diagnosis of this
dreaded disease. Optical spectroscopy-based imaging modalities appear to be eminently
suitable for the rapid diagnosis of breast cancer. The elementary optical spectroscopy-
based techniques including Transillumination Imaging (TI) and Diffuse Optical Imaging
(DOI) are comparatively more practical for rapid diagnosis of breast cancer in the field
as compared to advanced optical spectroscopy techniques such as Raman spectroscopy
and Fluorescence spectroscopy. The handheld Transillumination Imaging is inexpensive
and easy to use, but its accuracy is not high, and a skilled clinician needs to interpret
the transilluminated image. Diffuse Optical Imaging appears to be most promising. It
provides a detailed spatial map of relative concentration of different cancer biomarkers
and could be amenable to be used within a system of a handheld tool in combination
with AI driven rapid analysis. Currently, DOI is lab-based and expensive to manufac-
ture and needs improvement in its image resolution.
The DOI tool is classified as parallel plate, bed-based, and handheld system. The par-
allel plate system includes both transmission and reflection data and gives results with
and without the application of pressure with relatively low acquisition time. The parallel
plate system considers breast volume variation and breast density variation. However,
due to its mechanical design, it is prone to vibration-induced errors. Additionally, con-
sidering rapid diagnosis with large sample size, it is more prone to failure due to mech-
anical motion. The parallel plate-based configuration is more advantageous in systems
connected to bed-based configuration.
The bed-based technique involves both transmission and reflection analysis while
taking breast volume and breast density variation into account. Moreover, the patient is
comfortable during the acquisition process, with the bed-based system having the sensi-
tivity and specificity of more than 90%. However, the mechanical design, including a
specialized bed decreases portability, and the spilling of chamber fluid and its hygiene is
a concern. The motion-based contact bed-based technique is more favorable but is
more prone to mechanical failure. With the recent developments in bed-based
techniques taking the acquisition time to be less than 1 minute, the bed-based technique
is a promising configuration to be used as a rapid diagnostic tool. However, there is a
need to configure the bed-based system in a modular approach to improve portability
and rapidly deploy the system.
The handheld system primarily provides the reflection data and can compensate
for breast volume variation by manually changing the number of scanning points. The
sensitivity and specificity of hand-held systems are reported to be more than 90%.
However, manually choosing the scanning points makes the process dependent on the
operator’s skill. Considering an extensive number of tests, the operator can be prone to
fatigue and reduced accuracies on skipping the scanning points. Hence, the handheld
probe is more advantageous and reliable when used along with ultrasound or mammo-
gram, where the location of the tumor is known beforehand.

The FD and CW based rapid diagnosis systems are reported as an alternative to TD
system, while the CW based system was considered as a low-cost alternative; however,
with limited information on scattering data. Each of the modalities showcases potential
to be used as a rapid diagnostic tool; however, there is a critical need to fully resolve all
the challenges of being proficient in maintaining sensitivity with variation in breast vol-
ume and density between patients, portable, battery-powered, low-acquisition time, min-
imum human intervention, and integrated with machine learning techniques for
automatic interpretation of the results. Additionally, the rapid diagnostic tool should
quantify the main cancer biomarkers, such as total hemoglobin, water, and lipids.
