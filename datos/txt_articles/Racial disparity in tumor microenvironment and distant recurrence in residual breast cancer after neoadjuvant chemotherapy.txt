Black, compared to white, women with residual estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(NAC) have worse distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS). Such racial disparity may be due to difference in density of portals for
systemic cancer cell dissemination, called TMEM doorways, and pro-metastatic tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we evaluate
residual cancer specimens after NAC from 96 Black and 87 white women. TMEM doorways are visualized by triple
immunohistochemistry, and cancer stem cells by immunoﬂuorescence for SOX9. The correlation between TMEM doorway score
and pro-metastatic TME parameters with DRFS is examined using log-rank and multivariate Cox regression. Black, compared to
white, patients are more likely to develop distant recurrence (49% vs 34.5%, p = 0.07), receive mastectomy (69.8% vs 54%, p = 0.04),
and have higher grade tumors (p = 0.002). Tumors from Black patients have higher TMEM doorway and macrophages density
overall (p = 0.002; p = 0.002, respectively) and in the ER+/HER2- (p = 0.02; p = 0.02, respectively), but not in the triple negative
disease. Furthermore, high TMEM doorway score is associated with worse DRFS. TMEM doorway score is an independent prognostic
factor in the entire study population (HR, 2.02; 95%CI, 1.18–3.46; p = 0.01), with a strong trend in ER+/HER2- disease (HR, 2.38; 95%
CI, 0.96–5.95; p = 0.06). SOX9 expression is not associated with racial disparity in TME or outcome. In conclusion, higher TMEM
doorway density in residual breast cancer after NAC is associated with higher distant recurrence risk, and Black patients are
associated with higher TMEM doorway density, suggesting that TMEM doorway density may contribute to racial disparities in breast
cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading
cause of cancer-related deaths among women1. Although breast
cancer related deaths declined in the last three decades by
approximately 40%, death rates declined less in Black, compared
to non-Black, patients, resulting in persistent racial disparities in
survival after a breast cancer diagnosis. Factors contributing to the
racial gap in breast cancer mortality include: (i) advanced stage at
presentation, (ii) higher incidence of triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC), (iii) higher comorbidity rates, (iv) poorer adherence to
chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, and (v) adverse social
determinants of health contributing to limitations in access to
care2–6.
Racial
disparities
are
also
present
in
clinical
trial
populations that are healthier and have access to care, indicating
that social determinants of health and presentation with more
advanced stage disease are the contributing factors7–10, and
suggesting that other unknown factors may be contributing.
Due to more aggressive and advanced disease at presentation,
Black patients with breast cancer are frequently treated with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) to downsize tumors and obtain
information regarding treatment response. Tumor response to
NAC is used as a pharmacodynamic biomarker that provides
prognostic information and may be used to guide the choice of
subsequent systemic adjuvant therapy after surgery11,12.
After NAC, the tumor microenvironment (TME) enters a
reparative stage that results in a “cytokine storm” causing
recruitment of bone marrow derived progenitors including pro-
angiogenic TIE2+ monocytes and endothelial progenitor cells into
TME13,14. In murine mammary carcinoma models, NAC leads to an
increased density of tumor microenvironment of metastasis
(TMEM) doorways, TMEM doorway-mediated cancer cell intravasa-
tion, and, ultimately, metastatic burden15,16. TMEM doorways are
three-cell structures (composed of an actin regulatory protein
mammalian-enabled [Mena] expressing tumor cell, a perivascular
macrophage [TIE2 high], and an endothelial cell) and function as
portals that surrounding tumor cells can use to intravasate into
the blood stream17–22. Several large studies showed that TMEM
doorway density is an independent prognostic marker for distant

recurrence in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer who were
treated with adjuvant systemic therapies20,22,23. It has been
recently shown that TMEM doorways are also microanatomical
niches enriched for cancer stem cells (CSCs) expressing SOX924.
This ﬁnding is important because CSCs have the ability to initiate
primary tumor growth and metastatic foci at distant sites25.
However, the importance of CSC density for disease outcome is
inconclusive, as several studies have found an association
between CSCs and inferior clinical outcome in breast cancer
patients26,27, whereas others have not28. Moreover, in ER+/HER2-
disease, TMEM doorway density increased in the residual disease
after NAC when compared with TMEM doorway density in the
primary tumor before NAC15. This effect is now recognized as a
mechanism of resistance to cytotoxic therapy wherein tumor
dissemination is promoted, despite concomitant cytoreduction29.
In a pooled analysis of 9702 women from 8 National Surgical
Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) trials treated with
NAC, Black patients with residual ER+ breast cancer after NAC had
inferior DRFS compared to white patients30.
We hypothesize that racial differences in TMEM doorway
density may contribute to a racial difference in clinical outcome.
Here we test this hypothesis using a prospective-retrospective
study of TMEM doorway density and TMEM doorway-associated
TME after NAC.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
We analyzed formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded tissue samples
from 183 patients with residual invasive ductal breast cancer after
NAC (Fig. 1). Tissue and outcome data from 96 (52.5%) Black and
87 (47.5%) white patients were included in the analysis (Table 1).
There was no difference in neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens
(taxane only, taxane-containing, no-taxane containing regimens)
between Black and white patients. Additionally, NAC only and
NAC in combination with endocrine, HER2 inhibition, or radiation
therapies were all similar in Black compared to white patients
(Supplementary Table 1). When the cohort was stratiﬁed by breast
cancer subtype, treatment regimens in Black and white patients
with ER+/HER2- and TN disease were similar (Supplementary
Table 2).
Demographic and tumor characteristics of the entire cohort,
and for each breast cancer subtype, are described in Table 1 and
Supplementary Table 3 respectively. Black, compared to white,
patients were more likely to have distant recurrence (49% vs
34.5%, p = 0.07), receive mastectomy over breast conserving
therapy (69.8% vs 54%, p = 0.04), and have a higher tumor grade
(p = 0.002) in the entire cohort (Table 1). Age was similar among
Black and white patients (51.6 vs 52.3). There was no difference in
time to distant recurrence, tumor stage, lymph node status, or
subtype between Black and white patients (Table 1).
When the cohort was stratiﬁed by breast cancer subtype, a
racial difference in distant recurrence remained in ER+/HER2-
(46.3% vs 28%) but did not reach statistical signiﬁcance. However,
this difference was lost in the TNBC (54.1% vs 54.5%) subtype
(Supplementary Table 3). Black, compared with white, patients
were more likely to get mastectomy (82.9% vs 52%, p = 0.004),
have higher grade (p = 0.01), and positive lymph nodes (90.2% vs
66%, p = 0.01) in the ER+/HER2- subtype, but not in the TNBC
subtype, indicating a racial disparity in the biology of ER+/HER2-
but not TNBC disease. Black, compared to white, patients with ER
+/HER2- breast cancer were slightly younger (49.6 vs 54), and
patients with TNBC disease were slightly older (53.4 vs 50.9).
Furthermore, there was no racial difference observed in the two
breast cancer subtypes in time to distant recurrence and tumor
stage (Supplementary Table 3).
Approach to evaluating Pro-metastatic tumor
microenvironment and distant recurrence
Since NAC may increase the density of TMEM doorways in certain
patients, we wanted to determine if there is racial disparity in this
recently reported side-effect of NAC15,16,29. In addition, we wanted
to determine if TMEM doorway score could be used as prognostic
indicator of metastasis in the residual disease post-NAC similarly
to treatment-naïve breast cancers20,22,23. Given that macrophages
and blood vessels are components of TMEM doorways we also
investigated racial disparity in macrophage and microvascular
density and potential correlation with DRFS of these 2 parameters
of TME. Lastly, we wanted to determine racial disparity in CSC
density because CSCs are crucial for initiation of growth of
metastatic foci and it was demonstrated that TMEM doorways
may act as niches where CSCs preferentially reside24.
In all analyses we ﬁrst examined potential disparity in pro-
metastatic parameters between the two most prevalent breast
cancer subtypes, ER+/HER2- and TNBC, and then the racial
disparity between Black and white patients.
Disparity in pro-metastatic TME parameters
We used high nuclear expression of SOX9 to identify cells that
activated stem program as previously reported24. Representative
images of cancer cells expressing high levels of nuclear SOX9
(SOX9high) and low levels of nuclear SOX9 (SOX9low) are showed in
Fig. 2a and representative images for TMEM doorway high vs mid/
low analysis are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Tumors from
patients with TNBC had a higher density of TMEM doorways
(p = 0.004) (Fig. 2b), macrophages (p = 0.0002) (Fig. 2c), and CSCs
(nuclear SOX9high cancer cells, p = 0.0002) (Fig. 2d) than tumors
from patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer. There was no
difference in microvascular density between these two subtypes
of breast cancer (Fig. 2e). Of note, two cases were excluded from
the analysis of microvascular density because of large amount of
highly vascularized intertumoral stroma.
Black, compared to white, patients had higher density of TMEM
doorways and macrophages in their TME overall (p = 0.002 and
p = 0.002, respectively) and in ER+/HER2- subtype (p = 0.02 and
p = 0.02, respectively) but not in TNBC (p = 0.74 and p = 0.31,
respectively) (Fig. 3a–f). There was no racial difference in
microvascular density (Fig. 3g–i) and density of CSCs (Fig. 3j–l)
in either of the subtypes.
Taken together, these data show enrichment of the pro-
metastatic TME parameters TMEM doorway and macrophage
density in TNBC compared to ER+/HER2-. Additionally, when
separated by race and subtype, Black, compared to white, patients
had higher TMEM doorway and macrophage density only in ER
+/HER2- but not in TN subtype. We next tested how high density
of these pro-metastatic TME parameters correlate with DRFS.
Correlation between DRFS and pro-metastatic TME
parameters
Given that high TMEM doorway density is prognostic for DRFS in
breast cancer patients receiving AC, we hypothesized that TMEM
doorway density may also be prognostic for DRFS in patients with
residual disease after NAC. We also wanted to examine if other
pro-metastatic parameters in the residual disease post-NAC are
associated with DRFS. All comparisons were made in the overall
cohort as well as within ER+/HER2- and TNBC subtypes.
Since TMEM doorways contain macrophages and blood vessels,
and since the areas around TMEM doorways have been found to
be enriched for SOX9 expressing CSCs24, we ﬁrst performed a
Spearman correlation analysis among these pro-metastatic para-
meters and found signiﬁcant positive correlation only between
TMEM
doorway
score
and
macrophage
density

Next, we examined the racial disparity in DRFS and observed a
trend towards inferior DRFS for Black compared to white patients
with ER+/HER2- disease, but not with TNBC (Fig. 4a–c). Even
though we collected patient samples from multiple institutions,
follow-up time was similar between Black and white patients
(median follow-up time 68.95 and 71.53 months, respectively,
p = 0.9). Then we studied the correlation of DRFS and pro-
metastatic TME parameters. We found that patients with high
TMEM doorway score, compared to patients with mid/low TMEM
doorway score, in their residual disease had worse DRFS overall
(p = 0.008) (Fig. 4d) and trended towards inferior DRFS in
ER+/HER2- (p = 0.08) (Fig. 4e), but not in TNBC (Fig. 4f). To
investigate if NAC regimen is one of the driving factors affecting
DRFS in TMEM doorway-high vs mid/low patients, we compared
NAC treatment regimen between these two groups. There was no
statistical difference in NAC treatment regimens in TMEM doorway-
high and -mid/low groups (Supplementary Table 4). Even though,
we observed racial disparity in macrophage density and correlation
between TMEM doorway and macrophage density, there was no
association between macrophage density and DRFS (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3a). Although there was no association between DRFS and
other pro-metastatic tumor markers (microvascular and CSCs

density) (Supplementary Fig. 3), there was a trend towards worse
DRFS in high compared to low microvascular density in TNBC
(p = 0.06) (Supplementary Fig. 3f).
We next performed a multivariate Cox regression model and
found that TMEM doorway score (high vs mid/low) is an
independent prognostic indicator (HR 2.02 [95% CI 1.18–3.46],
p = 0.01), along with stage (T3 vs T1) (HR 1.97 [95% CI 1.03–3.76],
p = 0.04), lymph node status (positive vs negative) (HR 3.88 [95%
CI 1.92–7.86], p = 0.0002), grade (3 vs 2) (HR 2.91 [95% CI
1.43–5.92], p = 0.003), and subtype (TNBC vs ER+/HER2-) (HR 1.99
[95% CI 1.1–3.58], p = 0.02) (Fig. 4g). Of note, we included in the
multivariate analysis patients whose tumors did not fall into TN or
ER+/HER2- category as “other” category because one of the goals
of the study was to determine if TMEM doorway density is an
independent prognostic indicator of distant recurrence regardless
of cancer subtype. Multivariate Cox regression analysis among
patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer showed that there is a
positive association between DRFS and TMEM doorway score
(high vs mid/low) with a slightly stronger magnitude (HR 2.38
[95% CI 0.96–5.95]) but with borderline signiﬁcance (p = 0.06)
compared to entire cohort analysis. Grade (3 vs 2) remained
associated with DRFS in ER+/HER2- disease (HR 3.66 [95% CI
1.45–9.27], p = 0.006) upon cancer subtype stratiﬁcation. Although
the type of surgery (mastectomy vs breast conserving therapy)
was not signiﬁcantly associated with DRFS in entire cohort, it was
associated with DRFS in ER+/HER2- disease (HR 0.35 [95% CI
0.13–0.95], p = 0.04) (Supplementary Fig. 4).
These data demonstrate that out of the four pro-metastatic
parameters evaluated here, only TMEM doorway score was
prognostic for DRFS in patients with residual disease post-NAC.
DISCUSSION
In this prospective-retrospective, multi-institutional study we
investigated disparity in four pro-metastatic TME parameters in
residual disease post-NAC according to breast cancer subtype (ER
+/HER- vs TNBC) and race (Black vs white patients), as well as the
association of high density of these parameters with DRFS in all
patients. We
found
a higher
density of
TMEM
doorways,
macrophages, and CSCs in TNBC compared to ER+/HER2-.
Furthermore, we found a higher density of TMEM doorways and
macrophages in residual tumors from Black, compared to white,
patients with an ER+/HER2- subtype, but not TNBC. We also
showed that high TMEM doorway density in residual ER+/HER2-,
but not TNBC, is associated with DRFS. Taken together, these
ﬁndings show that a pro-metastatic response to chemotherapy
depends on cancer subtype and race and is most unfavorable in
Black patients with residual ER+/HER2- disease (Fig. 5).
Over the last two decades many controlled clinical trials have
demonstrated an association between Black patients and distant
recurrence and several have indicated that racial disparity is more
prominent in patients with ER+/HER2- disease. For example, in a
randomized clinical trial including 4817 breast cancer patients,
Black patients were strongly associated with inferior DRFS and
overall survival in ER+/HER2- disease9. Likewise, in a single
institution cohort of 3890 patients with invasive breast cancer,
Black patients with ER+/HER2- disease had 2-fold increase in
distant recurrence compared to white patients31. Moreover, the
ECOG-ACRIN-5103 clinical trial of 4994 patients showed that Black
patients with ER+/HER2- disease had worse disease free survival
than white patients10. It needs to be emphasized that these three
clinical trials have not found a racial disparity in distant recurrence
in TNBC9,10,31. The recent NCI-sponsored trial, TAILORx, focused on
ER+/HER2- disease alone, reported that Black patients were
associated with a 1.60-fold increase in distant recurrence rate and
an inferior overall survival8. Additionally, Albain et al. showed that
Black patients with hormone-dependent cancers, such as pre- and
post-menopausal ER+ disease, have worse outcome compared to
white patients7. Furthermore, our group recently reported that
racial disparities in DRFS for Black patients with residual ER
+/HER2- but TNBC disease after NAC in a review of 8 NSABP
trials30. However, in the present study, we only observed a trend
towards worse DRFS in Black compared to white patients with
residual ER+/HER2- disease. Most likely the difference in this
current study did not attain statistical signiﬁcance due to the
tenfold smaller cohort size compared to the one by Kim et al.30.
Consistent with the existing literature, we have not found in this
current study a discrepancy in survival between Black and white
patients with TNBC.
Among all breast cancer subtypes, TNBC has the poorest
outcome due to a high risk of relapse, early recurrence with
visceral organ metastases, and a lack of targeted therapies32–34.
Furthermore, the aggressive nature of TNBC may mask other
biological factors that would otherwise contribute to disparity in

DRFS between Black and white patients. Indeed, in this current
study we found that TMEM doorway score, as well as density of
macrophages and CSCs, were higher in TNBC compared to ER
+/HER2- disease, consistent with the higher metastatic potential
associated with TNBC.
It has been shown that NAC induces repair signals in the tumor,
leading to a recruitment of myeloid cells (particularly TIE2+
macrophages) into the TME13,14 and a subsequent increase in
TMEM
doorway
score15,16.
TIE2+
macrophages
are
crucial
components of TMEM doorways, as they induce transient localized
vascular openings via their secretion of vascular endothelial
growth factor-A (VEGFA)17. Once TMEM doorways are open,
MenaINV, an isoform of Mena (Mammalian Enabled, Actin
regulatory protein) expressing tumor cells can intravasate19,35,36
and disseminate to other organs. Knowledge of this biology has
important clinical implications since it has recently been demon-
strated that TMEM doorway related vascular opening can be
observed in patients in real time using a novel MRI approach37,
and can be blocked by small molecule inhibitor of TIE238.
Several studies have reported a correlation between high
macrophage density in the breast TME and worse prognosis39,40.
Likewise, microvascular density has been shown to correlate with
inferior survival and metastasis in patients with invasive breast
carcinoma41. In the context of racial disparity, Martin et al. showed
that Black patients with breast cancer have a higher macrophage
and microvasculature density in the TME compared to white
patients42.
Although
we
also
found
a
greater
number
of
macrophages in Black, compared to white, patients, we did not
observe racial disparity in microvascular density. Unlike in prior
reports, neither macrophage nor microvascular density were
associated with DRFS in our cohort.
It is currently unclear in which clinical scenarios CSC density
correlates with outcome. Some reports clearly indicate an
association with worse outcome, while others do not. For example,
in 48 patients with stage IV breast cancer, a high percentage of
circulating CSCs was associated with inferior treatment response,
survival, and progression-free survival27. Similarly, a meta-analysis
that included 12 studies showed an association between CSCs and
inferior overall survival in breast cancer26. However, other studies
have found that CSCs and clinical outcome do not correlate28,
which accords with the results we report here. The lack of
correlation we observed between TMEM doorway density and
CSCs is an unexpected ﬁnding given the recently reported ﬁnding
of a positive correlation between TMEM doorway score and a high
percentage of CSCs24. The reasons for these discrepancies need to
be further investigated.
The strengths of the current study are the inclusion of patients
of different racial background (Black and white patients) from
several large academic institutions with similar distribution of age,
time to distant recurrence status, tumor stage, and lymph node
status. Although the patients were treated at different institutions,
their treatments were relatively uniform (Supplementary Tables 1,
2). Of note, the criteria for calling a case ER+ changed from 10% to
1% in 201043. However, about 97% of patients with ER+ disease
have more than 10% of cancer cells positive for ER44. Therefore,
subtyping cancer into ER+ category has not changed for most
patients. Furthermore, the standard of care did not substantially
change in the course of this study that included patients with
HER2-negative disease. Anthracycline-taxane neoadjuvant che-
motherapy was used in about 85% of patients, and those with ER-
positive disease received adjuvant endocrine therapy for up to 10
years. An additional strength is the use of a multivariate Cox
regression model that adjusts for potential confounders (Fig. 4
and Supplementary Fig. 4). Limitations are the relatively small
cohort size, unknown treatment status in 10 Black and 4 white
patients, and unclear effect of comorbidities (e.g., hypertension)
on pro-metastatic parameters. As discussed in the results,
relatively small cohort size might have underpowered our DRFS

regression
model,
especially
considering nearly signiﬁcant p values in ER+/HER2- group
(Supplementary Fig 4). To overcome this limitation, future studies
need to be designed with larger cohort size. Although the
treatment status of 10 Black and 4 white patients was unknown, it
is unlikely that this affected the results because for the vast
majority of patients in the cohort (169) treatment regimen was
known and no statistical difference in treatment status was found.
Comorbidities could be one of the variates affecting survival of the
patients in the study. We included potential cofounders in our
multivariate Cox regression model from available patient data,
however, comorbidities such as BMI or hypertension, when
available, need to be taken into consideration in future studies.
Additionally, knowing the adjuvant treatment such as additional
endocrine therapy, radiation and chemotherapy after surgery
could be affecting DRFS and would be help understand the data
presented here. Unfortunately, the current sample is limited in size
to control for too many potential confounders in the multivariate
model. Further, one important limitation of this study is the
absence of pre-chemotherapy tissue samples to observe the
chemotherapy effect on TME for each patient individually. Now,
we are focusing on new studies to validate our ﬁndings in larger
cohorts and more detailed covariates (including comorbidities,
adjuvant, endocrine, and radiation therapy regiments, etc.) with
matched pre/post-chemotherapy tissue samples from patients
with ER+/HER2- disease. This would guide us to investigate the
impact of each limitation on our current ﬁndings and to
understand the mechanism of the racial disparity in TME even

further. Based on our previous work on inferior DRFS in Black
patient with residual ER+/HER2- breast cancer, compared to white
patients30, we only included Black and white patients in current
study to investigate the biology of the racial disparity in these
patient groups. Patients with other or unknown races were
excluded in this study. To expand racial disparity, new studies
could be designed including other races and/or ethnicities.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the existence of a racial
disparity in pro-metastatic TME in Black, compared to white,
women with residual ER+/HER2- disease after NAC. This work
provides a foundation for the development of companion
diagnostics such as TMEM-MRI activity37 to facilitate the evalua-
tion of systemic therapies on the metastatic dissemination, and
therapies to block TMEM doorway activity38, which may ultimately
contribute to reducing racial disparity in breast cancer.
METHODS
Study design
This was a prospective-retrospective, multi-institutional case-control
study performed in accordance with REMARK guidelines45,46.
Patients were selected from four participating New York Pathology
Oncology Group (NYPOG-https://einsteinmed.edu/research/groups/
ny-pathology-oncology/) institutions (Monteﬁore Medical Center;
New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center; NYU Langone
Health; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center). The study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of each institution. The
written consent from patients was not obtained because we only
used leftover archival tissue that was excised for standard clinical
care for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes years before the
initiation of this study. Due to the timing of the study many
subjects are deceased. Female patients over age of 18, diagnosed
with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) between 2004 and 2014, who
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had sufﬁcient residual
cancer for staining (deﬁned as >5 mm) were included. Patients with
a prior personal history of breast or other cancers, bilateral cancers,
and distant metastatic disease at the time of presentation were
excluded from the study (Fig. 1). Cases were deﬁned as patients with
localized breast cancer treated with NAC who subsequently
developed distant recurrence, whereas controls were deﬁned as
patients who did not develop distant recurrence. Detailed NAC
regimens can be found in Supplementary Tables 1, 2.
Although it is now understood that race is a social construct,
race was self-identiﬁed per the patient’s electronic medical
records. Only patients of Black or white patients were included.
Patients with ‘Other’ or unknown races were excluded from the
study. Distant recurrence was deﬁned as clinical or radiographic
evidence of disease recurrence outside of the breast, chest wall,
and axillary lymph nodes, with or without tissue conﬁrmation.
Primary endpoints were TMEM doorway score; percentage of
tumor cells expressing high levels of SOX9, which indicates
activation of stem program24; and time to distant recurrence,
measured in months from date of diagnosis. Secondary endpoints
were macrophage and microvascular density.
Cohort assembly and tissue collection
The tumor registry at each institution was queried and all cases
were reviewed by a clinician to ensure that inclusion and
exclusion criteria were met. A cohort of 216 patients who met
the inclusion and exclusion criteria were assembled from the
NYPOG institutions. The representative Formalin Fixed Parafﬁn
Embedded (FFPE) blocks created at the time of surgical excision
and stored in pathology archives at each institution were selected
and ﬁve sequential sections were cut. Of the cohort 216 patients,
33 were excluded due to poor tissue quality, as determined by
pathologists (MO, SA).
Slide staining & scanning
Of the ﬁve sequential sections, one was stained for TMEM
doorways, and the other for the stem cell marker (SOX9) and DAPI
(to mark nuclei).
TMEM doorways were visualized by triple immunostaining as per
a previously validated protocol22,23 identifying Mena-overexpressing
tumor cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells. Cancer stem cells
were identiﬁed by immunoﬂuorescent staining of SOX9 (anti-rabbit
Millipore 3205915, 1:100 dilution) and DAPI (1:1000 dilution) on an
adjacent sequential section. Alexa Fluor-546 goat anti-rabbit (H + L)
Fig. 5
Summary of racial disparity in pro-metastatic TME of residual ER+/HER2- breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).
Black patients with residual ER+/HER2- breast cancer after NAC have higher numbers of TMEM doorways and macrophages in their tumor
microenvironment compared to white patients. TMEM doorways are localized, transient vascular openings formed by Mena expressing tumor
cell, perivascular macrophage, and endothelial cell. Increased permeability around TMEM doorways helps cancer cells to intravasate and
disseminate to other organs. Higher TMEM doorway score can be one of the mechanisms of inferior outcome and distant recurrence free
survival in Black vs white patients with residual ER+/HER2- breast cancer. This original clipart was created with BioRender.com.

antibody. The slides were digitally scanned at 20x on a 3D Histech
P250 High-Capacity Slide Scanner.
TMEM doorway quantiﬁcation
The
digitally
scanned
slides
were
ﬁrst
imported
into
the
Visiopharm image analysis software, Vis (Visiopharm, Hørsholm,
Denmark). Next, in Vis, pathologists (MO, SA) identiﬁed approxi-
mately ten high power (20X) microscope ﬁelds best suitable for
analysis based upon appropriate pathological criteria (e.g., lack of
tumor necrosis, inﬂammation, tissue folds). Each 20X ﬁeld covers a
660 × 880 µm2 area, which is 4 times the area of a 40X ﬁeld
previously used for TMEM doorway quantiﬁcation23,47,48. Next,
TMEM doorways were quantiﬁed using previously published
algorithms47 in all the 20X microscope ﬁelds and the sum of
TMEM doorways in these ﬁelds, divided by a conversion factor of
4, was used as the TMEM doorway score for the patient sample,
which is consistent with previously published methods23,47,48.
TMEM doorway-high patients were deﬁned as those in the highest
tertile of TMEM doorway score.
Quantiﬁcation of macrophage and microvascular densities
In the original TMEM doorway quantiﬁcation algorithm47, tumor,
macrophage, and vessel areas were identiﬁed across entire region
of interest (ROI). Macrophage area divided by the ROI area was
used to determine the macrophage density. Likewise, vessel area
divided by the ROI area determined the vascular density.
Nuclear SOX9 image analysis
We analyzed the percentage of nuclear SOX9 cells in Vis. We used
the same ten, high-powered ﬁelds (20X) that were used for TMEM
doorway quantiﬁcation. The ROIs were captured using the screen
capture tool and exported as bitmap (BMP) image ﬁles (lossless
and uncompressed), allowing for accurate quantiﬁcation of
immunoﬂuorescence intensities. Using the image analysis pack-
age, Fiji49, each image was split into separate color channels and
the red (SOX9) and blue (nuclei) channels were used for further
analysis. Again in Fiji, a machine learning algorithm, implemented
via the Trainable Weka Segmentation plugin50 was used to
segment the nuclei (blue) channel. The Trainable Weka Segmen-
tation plugin was again run with separate training on the SOX9
(red) channel to segment the tumor regions. SOX9 mean
ﬂuorescence intensity measurements were made for nuclei in
the tumor regions. Nuclear SOX9 intensity was quantiﬁed in each
nucleus, and SOX9high cells above a speciﬁed intensity threshold
were counted. It has been determined that CSCs constitute no
more than 5% of cancer cells in untreated tumors24. Thus, the
threshold for detecting CSCs was determined using cases
expected to have the lowest CSC density - untreated ER+/HER2-
breast cancers from white patients. We showed previously that
CSC density correlates with TMEM doorway density24. In addition,
we showed here that ER+/HER2- cancers have lower TMEM
doorway density than TNBC and that breast cancers from white
patients have lower TMEM doorway density than cancers from
Black patients. Furthermore, TMEM doorway density may increase
as a response to chemotherapy15. Hence the threshold was
calculated using three different untreated ER+/HER2- cancers
from white patients and the cutoffs averaged. This intensity
threshold was then applied to all samples. SOX9high cell numbers
were aggregated from all ten high-powered ﬁelds to get a single
percentage of nuclear SOX9high cells number for each patient.
Sample size and power calculation
For each race group with at least N = 50 non-recurrences and
N = 25 recurrences, with a two-sided type I error rate of not more
than 5%, the study has 80% power to detect a difference of
0.61 SD in each marker between recurrences and non-recurrences.
Thus, our study has adequate power to detect a moderate level of
effect size.
Statistical analysis
Patient and tumor characteristics, including age (years); surgery
type (breast conserving therapy vs mastectomy); post-NAC tumor
size (> 5 cm, 2–5 cm, < 2 cm); post-NAC nodal status (positive vs.
negative); Nottingham histologic grade (1, 2, 3); tumor subtype
(TNBC vs ER+/HER2-); and tumor markers, including TMEM
doorway score; density of SOX9High cancer cells; macrophage
density; and microvascular density were compared between Black
and white patients using Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous
variables and chi-squared tests or Fisher’s exact tests for
categorical
variables.
Spearman
correlation
was
calculated
between each pair of tumor markers.
The primary outcome variable was DRFS, deﬁned as time from
diagnosis to ﬁrst distant relapse or a second primary cancer.
Death prior to a distant recurrence or second primary cancer
was censored. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests
were used to compare DRFS between racial groups and
between
categorized
pro-metastatic
tumor
characteristics
(e.g., high vs low/mid tertile). A multivariate Cox proportional
hazard model was used to examine the association between
TMEM doorway score and DRFS, adjusting for race, age, surgery
type, tumor size, nodal status, tumor grade, tumor subtype. The
proportionality of the Cox model was examined using Schoen-
feld residuals51,52.
Statistical signiﬁcance was speciﬁed a priori as p < 0.05 and the
two-side p-values were reported. All analyses were conducted
using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC 2014) and GraphPad
Prism version 9.1 (Dotmatics, Boston, MA).
