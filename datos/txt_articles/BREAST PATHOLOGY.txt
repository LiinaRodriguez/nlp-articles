Background: Paget disease of the nipple-areolar complex is an uncommon type of intraepithelial adenocarcinoma, characterized 
histologically by glandular differentiation, intracellular mucin, and immunoreactivity for cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen 
and carcinoembryonic antigen. Although the cell of origin in Paget disease remains controversial, the prevailing view is that most 
cases arise from in situ or invasive ductal carcinoma. Associations of Paget disease of the nipple with lobular breast neoplasia is 
largely unknown. We, therefore, aimed to investigate whether Paget disease has any association with lobular breast tumors or is 
strictly limited to ductal breast malignancies. 
Design: We reviewed mastectomy specimens done for carcinoma at our institution from 2007 to 2016. We retrieved H&E sections 
containing only the nipple to identify characteristic pathologic findings. Paget disease was defined as single cells to nests of 
intraepithelial adenocarcinoma-like cells with intracellular mucin and confirmed by immunohistochemistry with cytokeratin and/or 
epithelial membrane antigen. 
Results: A total of 808 H&E-stained nipple sections were reviewed from 432 unilateral and 188 bilateral mastectomies of 620 
female patients. Paget disease was identified in 28/808 (3.5%) cases; all Paget were unilateral, and one (3.5%) Paget was 
pigmented (Fig 1). All Paget diseases were of ductal phenotype. Five (18%) Paget cases that contained invasive or in-situ lobular 
neoplasia in the nipple or breast tissue confirmed ductal phenotype of Paget disease by E-cadherin and p120 
immunohistochemistry (Fig 1). Seven (25%) Paget cases also contained concomitant Toker cells (Fig 1). Toker cells were identified 
in 124 (15%) nipples from 115 (18.5%) patients, of which 9 (1.4%) patients had bilateral Toker cells. Toker cells contained melanin 
pigment in 4 cases and showed duct formation in 2 cases. Invasive carcinoma was present in the nipple section in 66 (8%) cases: 
ductal 41(5%), lobular 14(2%), and others 11(1.4%). In-situ carcinoma was present in the nipple sections in 73 (9%) cases: ductal 
50(6%) and lobular 23(3%). Other histological findings included: squamous metaplasia (31), papilloma (9), lactational-like changes 
(4), adenomyoma (1), osteoid (1), and granuloma (1). 
Figure 1 - 94 
 
Conclusions: This is the first comprehensive study of histological and pathological findings of the female nipple. Our findings 
indicate that Paget disease is purely associated with ductal-type neoplasia and absent with lobular breast lesions.

Background: Pure intralymphatic breast carcinoma (PIC) after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) represents an unusual 
pattern of residual disease and data in the literature are limited. Here, we sought to assess clinicopathologic features and outcome 
of residual PIC/predominantly PIC. 
Design: Electronic medical records were searched to identify patients with PIC/predominantly PIC post-NAST between 2007-2022 
at a Cancer Center and clinicopathologic data were retrieved. Slides from surgical specimens were reviewed. Survival analysis was 
performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test. 
Results: Amongst a cohort of 1113 breast cancer patients submitted to NAST, we detected 7 (0.6%) cases of PIC. All were female, 
being 6 pre-menopausal. Average age at diagnosis was 42.4 years old (range 24-51 yo). Clinically, 4 women presented with a 
palpable breast mass, 2 with inflammatory carcinoma, and 1 with a non-palpable lesion. Mean tumor size was 4.3 cm (range 0.8-13 
cm) and 1 patient was metastatic. Regarding nodal status, 5 patients had axillary LN metastasis before treatment. Histologic 
evaluation demonstrated 3 no-special type invasive breast carcinomas, 2 invasive carcinomas with apocrine differentiation, 1 
pleomorphic invasive lobular carcinoma, and 1 micropapillary. Interestingly, 2 cases exhibited LVI pre-NAST. When stratified by 
molecular subtype, 4(57.1%) were HER2+; 1(14.3%) triple-negative; 1 luminal B-HER2; and 1 luminal B. Following treatment, most 
cases (5/7; 71.4%) were categorized as RCB I, size of residual intralymphatic carcinoma ranged from 0.2-40 mm (mean 7.4 mm) 
and residual DCIS was present in 2 cases. While 5 patients showed no LN metastasis, 2 had micrometastasis. At a mean follow-up 
time of 16.14 months (2-56 mos), all patients were alive without evidence of disease. Compared to the whole NAST population, PIC 
patients demonstrated a distinct survival (p<0.005), with better outcome. However, there was no statistical difference when taking 
each RCB group into consideration, due to the small number of PIC cases and short follow-up time.

Conclusions:  PIC is an extremely rare pattern of residual disease after NAST. The majority of breast cancers were HER2+ with 
an advanced clinical stage at diagnosis. In contrast to previous reports, we did not find a poor outcome associated with 
intralymphatic carcinoma, although a longer follow-up time is required to determine and better understand the prognosis of this 
cohort.

Disclosures: Daniel Ahmadi: None; Horacio Maluf: None; Reza Setoodeh: None; Souzan Sanati: None 
Background: Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is a subtype of breast cancer (BC) that is characterized by the loss of E-cadherin, a 
surface molecule that constitutes cell cohesion. The growth of majority of ILCs is propagated through stimulation by ER, hence 
hormonal therapy is the main line of therapy.  A minority of ILCs (<1%) are negative for ER, PgR, and Her2, so called triple 
negative (TN), which while rare, is an important and understudied group of ILC with limited treatment options.  We aimed to study 
clinical, pathologic, and molecular characteristics of TN-ILC. 
Design: A retrospective search between 2006 and August 2022 for TN-ILC was performed.  Demographic and clinical data 
including age, laterality, biomarker status (ER, PgR, Her2, Ki-67), focality, size, grade, LVI, DCIS, LCIS [classic vs. pleomorphic 
(P)], LN status, TNM stage, neoadjuvant therapy (NT), and sequencing results were collected.  24 consecutive ER+ ILCs were 
randomly selected as control.  Androgen receptor (AR) IHC was performed using standard protocol (SP107). 
Results: 28 TN-ILCs were identified: mean age was 67.7 (Range: 48-98) years; tumor size 2.5 (Range: 0.1-9.5) cm; 1 tumor was 
grade 1, 13 grade 2, and 11 grade 3; 10 tumors had LN metastasis, 4 in >3 LNs; 6 patients received NT, 1 achieved complete 
response and 1 partial response. ER+ ILCs did not show significant differences in age, tumor size, LN status, and LVI, but they 
showed less grade 3 tumors (2 grade 1, 19 grade 2, 2 grade 3).  Mean Ki-67 expression was higher in TN ILCs 18% (3%-74%) vs. 
ER+ ILCs 8% (1-21%).  100% of TN-ILCs were ILC-P compared to 32% of ER+ ILCs.  Except 2 TN-ILCs which didn't show AR 
expression, all tumors were AR positive. One AR+ TN-ILC showed good response to anti-AR therapy. 10 TN-ILCs and 8 ER+ ILCs 
were sequenced.   In TN-ILCs a range of pathogenic [PALB2 (1), MUTYH (1)], and potentially actionable [AKT1 (1), CDH-1 (1), and 
PIK3CA (1)] mutations, and VUS [ATM (1), POLE (2), BARD1 (1), SDHB (1), APC (1), BLM (1), FANCM (1), CDH-1 (1), MSH3 (1) 
and PIK3CA (1)] were seen in 8 of 10 tumors. In ER+ ILC only 1 tumor showed VUS in BRCA2 and CFTR; 7 tumors showed no 
mutations or alterations. 
Conclusions: All TN-ILC in our series were P-ILCs.  Actionable and pathogenic mutations and VUS were seen more commonly in 
TN-ILC cases in our series.  Anti-AR therapy can be a potential treatment option in TN-ILCs with limited treatment options.

97   Reassessing Histopathology of Breast Cancer Cases with Pathologic Complete Response 
after Neoadjuvant Therapy

Disclosures: Di (Andy) Ai: None; Lauren Postlewait: None; Yuan Gao: None; Xiaoxian Li: None 
Background: Pathologic complete response (pCR) is defined as no residual invasive carcinoma (RIC) in the breast and no lymph 
node metastasis (LNM) on evaluation of surgical specimens post neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Patients who do not achieve pCR 
have worse outcomes and thus may receive additional chemotherapy. Evaluation of pCR is usually based on one level of H&E 
section. The aim of this study is to assess whether occult RIC or LNM can be identified in deeper level recuts of tumor bed and 
lymph nodes in cases originally reported as pCR and whether occult RIC or LNM is associated with worse outcomes. 
Design: We collected 40 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cases with pCR from 2010 to 2017 at our institution. Three deeper 
level recuts were performed on the tumor bed and all lymph nodes. First and third level recuts were stained with H&E and the 
second was stained with pancytokeratin (AE1/3) by immunohistochemistry.  The slides were reviewed by two pathologists. This 
study was approved by the Institutional Research Board. 
Results: Occult disease was identified in 7 (17.5%) of the 40 cases, including 6 (15%) RIC and 2 (5.0%) LNM (1 case had both 
RIC and LNM) (See Table for details). The MD Anderson residual cancer burden was class I in all 7 cases. Median follow up time 
was 47.9 months for the entire group.  In all patients, there was 1 local recurrence and 4 distant metastases.  All recurrence events 
occurred in the group with pCR without residual occult disease, with no recurrence or distant metastatic events in the group with 
occult RIC or LNM. There was no statistical difference in median disease-free survival (DFS 42.8 mo vs 38.0 mo, p=0.97) or overall 
survival (OS 47.9 mo vs 38.0 mo, p=0.79) between these two groups.

Conclusions: In patients with TNBC undergoing NAT who appeared to have a pCR by standard pathologic assessment, 17.5% 
had occult residual disease in deeper sections of the tumor and/or lymph nodes.  This occult disease was not associated with 
poorer DFS or OS. Our results suggest evaluation with one H&E slide of the tumor bed and lymph nodes as currently standard 
practice is sufficient to identify clinically meaningful residual disease.  Patients with occult minimal residual tumor burden after 
neoadjuvant therapy have similar prognosis as patients who achieved true pCR, and additional chemotherapy may not be needed.  
 
98    Identification of Glandular (Acinar)/Tubule Formation in Invasive Breast Cancer: A Pilot Study 
to Investigate if an Expanded Definition Can Improve Concordance

Background: The Nottingham Grading System (NGS) is used to determine prognosis and AJCC stage, as well as to guide 
treatment for invasive breast carcinoma (IBC). In WHO, the glandular/tubular formation (G/TF) component of NGS is specified to 
include "only structures exhibiting clear central lumina surrounded by polarized neoplastic cells". A recent study showed poor 
concordance when 35 breast pathologists used this definition to classify 58 structures (with each structure circled) as determined 
 
  
 
S88 
by Dr. Ian Ellis (manuscript in preparation). Based on these results, this pilot study was undertaken to determine if an expanded 
definition of G/TF could improve concordance. 
Design: The expanded definition addressed areas of difficulty identified in the initial study, included more information about 
structures that should be considered G/TF, and provided a definition of polarization. In addition, there was guidance about 
classifying complex/cribriform, mucinous, and micropapillary patterns. The same 58 images used for the original study were used 
for the pilot study.  These images were sent in PowerPoint format along with the expanded definition to 10 experienced breast 
pathologists who did not participate in the original study. 
Results: The 10 invited pathologists completed the survey. The overall concordance increased from a mean of 66% (range 40-
97%; kappa statistic 0.324) in the original study (Figure 1) to a mean of 94% (range 86-100%; kappa statistic 0.868) in the pilot 
study (Figure 2). The concordance for the 41 structures that should be considered G/TF increased from a mean of 57% (range 15-
100%) to a mean of 99% (93-100%). However, the concordance for the 17 structures that should not be considered G/TF 
decreased from a mean of 91% (range 18-100%) to a mean of 81% (range 53-100%).  Of the 32 misclassifications in this latter 
group, 10 involved a micropapillary pattern (a solid nest with inverted polarity) and 9 involved solid nests with a possible artifactual 
space. 
Figure 1 - 98 
 
Figure 2 - 98 
 
Conclusions: In this pilot study, an expanded definition of G/TF markedly improved overall concordance and concordance for the 
recognition of structures that should be included as G/TF. However, concordance for structures that should not be classified as 
G/TF decreased, suggesting that the definition could be improved further, especially for the micropapillary pattern. Additional 
validation studies using a revised definition on a new larger set of challenging cases to determine if concordance can be further 
improved would be of value.

Disclosures: Sarah Anderson: None; Brooke Bartow: None; Xiao Huang: None; Shi Wei: None 
Background: Low HER2 expression is emerging as an actionable target for the treatment of breast cancer (BC) with the antibody 
drug conjugate Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd). However, the evolution of HER2-low expression during BC progression remains 
poorly characterized. The aim of this study is to evaluate the evolution of HER2 expression in primary and metastatic BCs 
(pBCs/mBCs) by including the HER2-low category.  
Design: The HER2 statuses of pBCs and their paired mBCs available at the authors' institution between 01/2000 and 08/2020 
were retrospectively collected. Those from regional lymph nodes were excluded. The HER2 status, evaluated by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or in situ hybridization (ISH), was categorized as HER2-0, HER2-low (IHC 1+ or 2+/non-amplified) 
and HER2-positive (HER2+). The cases with non-amplified HER2 but no IHC performed and those with a negative IHC result from 
referring institutions but without an IHC score were not included.  A total of 171 paired pBC/mBC cases were available in the study 
period. 
Results: The proportions of HER2-low cases were 25.7% in pBCs and 23.4% in mBCs, respectively, while those of HER2-0 cases 
were 35.1% and 42.7%, respectively. The overall conversion rate between HER2-0 and HER2-low was 31.7%. HER2-low switching 
to HER2-0 (19/44, 54.2%) was more frequent than the vice versa (14/60, 24.1%; p=0.03). No significant difference was found when 
comparing the conversion rates among the common organs of relapses, including bone, liver, lung and brain (p=0.8). Two (3.3%) 
and 9 (20.5%) cases of pBCs with a HER2-0 and a HER2-low status, respectively, were converted to HER2+ mBCs. In contrast, 10 
(14.9%) and 10 cases of the 67 HER2+ pBCs were converted to HER2-0 and HER2-low mBCs, respectively, significantly higher 
when compared to the HER2-0 to HER2+ (p=0.03), but not HER2-low to HER2+ (p=0.45) conversions. Of the 17 patients with 
multiorgan metastases, 7 (41.2%) had discordance among the different sites of relapse, including 3 with HER2-0/HER2-low, 3 with 
HER2-0/HER2+ and 1 with HER2-low/HER2+, respectively. Overall, about 25% of cases (43/171) had a switch from or to a HER2-
low status. 
Conclusions: HER2-low expression is highly unstable during BC evolution. Furthermore, discordance of HER2 status is frequent 
among the distant sites of relapse. Thus, repeat testing is warranted in patients with accessible metastases, and to preferentially 
use the HER2 status of the metastasis to direct therapy in the pursuit of precision medicine.

Background: Given therapeutic opportunities brought about by new antibody-drug conjugates, the HER2 classification of breast 
cancer has been refined to include the new HER2-low (H2L) category comprising HER2 1+ by IHC, 2+ and non-amplified by ISH, 
and double-equivocal tumors. We analyzed three downstream HER2 effector pathways: PI3K-AKT, MAPK, and JAK-STAT, in H2L 
tumors in association with clinical and pathologic features, compared to those of HER2-positive and HER2-negative tumors. 
Design: The study comprised 62 luminal H2L carcinomas matched by hormone-positive status to 20 HER2-negative (0+) and 43 
HER2-positive tumors (20 2+weakly-amplified and 23 3+). The transcriptomic activity of the three signaling pathways was analyzed 
by RNA sequencing and the mutational status of key breast cancer-related genes by DNA sequencing. 
Results: H2L tumors had lower histoprognostic grades (p=0.0017), and lower mitotic and Ki67 proliferation indexes than HER2-
positive tumors (p=0.0042 and 0.0003). Their PIK3CA mutation rates were close to those of HER2-negative and significantly higher 
than in HER2-positive tumors (p=0.0048), which was opposite to TP53 mutations (p=0.0028). We found no differences between 
H2L and HER2-negative tumors (Table 1). At the transcriptomic level, we identified three groups with distinct profiles which did not 
reflect the new HER2 classification and did not single out a H2L tumor-specific profile (Fig. 1). Double-equivocal and weakly-
amplified tumors had similar mutation rates and transcriptomic profiles. Furthermore, we observed that the presence of a mutation 
in a signaling pathway had a strong pathway activation effect regardless of the HER2 tumor status (Fig. 2). Consequently, H2L 
tumors had similar PIK3CA mutation prevalence and similar transcriptomic profiles to HER2-negative tumors.

Conclusions: We found that luminal H2L and HER2-negative carcinomas shared most of clinicopathological, molecular and 
transcriptomic characteristics, except for HER2 membrane expression and mRNA levels. Transcriptomic clustering did not overlap 
with tumor groups in the new HER2 classification. Furthermore, PIK3CA mutations were more prevalent in these tumors, leading to 
a strong activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway even in the absence of HER2 overexpression/amplification. From a 
therapeutic point of view, PIK3CA mutations may explain the failure of conventional anti-HER2 treatments, suggesting that targeted 
anti-PI3K therapies and – possibly - new antibody-drug conjugates may be more effective. 
 
101   Adenomyoepithelioma: A Clinicopathological Study of 18 Cases of a Rare Breast Neoplasm 
with Literature Review

Disclosures: Saba Anjum: None; Nasir Ud Din: None; Muhammad Usman Tariq: None; Naila Kayani: None 
Background: Adenomyoepithelioma (AME) is an uncommon breast tumor, accounting <0.5% of breast tumors. AME is typically 
benign; however, atypical and malignant categories are also recognized, and few cases may be associated with carcinoma. 
Classical AMEs pursue benign course and complete surgical excision is curative. We aimed to describe the clinicopathological 
features of this rare entity along with follow up. 
Design: H&E and IHC slides of AME cases diagnosed between 2012 and 2021(n=18) were retrieved and reviewed. Demographic 
data was collected from surgical pathology reports. Follow up was obtained. 
Results: Patient’s age ranged from 26-73 (Median 48) years. All presented with a palpable lump, associated with nipple discharge 
in 8 cases. Tumor was multifocal in 1 case. Tumor size ranged from 1.1 to 16 (Median 4.8) cm. Benign AME had circumscribed 
borders while cases with malignant features showed infiltrative borders. Architecturally Tubular pattern was seen in 10, Spindle 
pattern in 3 and Mixed pattern in 5 cases. Hyaline degeneration (15), calcification (11), cystic degeneration (4), apocrine metaplasia 
 
  
 
S92 
(5), squamous and mucinous metaplasia (2) was noted. No significant mitotic activity was noted in benign tumors. Histologically, 13 
tumors showed morphological features of benign AME, 1 was diagnosed as atypical AME, 1 as malignant AME, 2 as Metaplastic 
carcinoma arising in AME and 1 as Epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma in AME. Mitotic count ranged from 9-15/ mm2 in malignant 
tumors. All tumors demonstrated heterogenous expression for keratins. ASMA and P63 were positive in myoepithelial cells in all 
cases. S100, CK5/6 and ER were positive with variable frequency. Available follow up of 16 patients ranged from 12–124 (Median 
39.5) months. All benign including 1 atypical AME cases were treated with surgery alone (n=14). Adjuvant chemo and/or 
radiotherapy was administered in 2 malignant cases; remaining 2 cases (Metaplastic carcinoma and Epithelial-myoepithelial 
carcinoma in AME) lost to follow up. Rest of the patients were alive and disease free. 
Conclusions: AME exhibits distinct morphological and IHC features. Atypical, malignant forms and associated carcinoma are not 
uncommon. Typical cases show indolent behavior. Limited follow-up in our cohort of patients showed recurrence in 1 patient with 
atypical AME. Thus, long term follow up will accurately determine its clinical behavior. 
 
102   Genomic Testing on Core Needle Biopsy Samples from Newly Diagnosed ER+/HER2- Breast 
Cancer Patients Decreases Use of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy

Background: Genomic profiling assays for invasive breast cancer (BC) are performed most commonly on surgical resection 
specimens in patients with ER+/HER2- disease to help determine the need for chemotherapy.  However, obtaining this genomic 
information earlier in the course of treatment from core needle biopsy (CNB) material has numerous advantages including 
identifying patients who would benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).  In 2020, our breast program began a pilot study 
where all newly diagnosed breast cancers were sent for genomic analysis using the Agendia MammaPrint (MPT) and BluePrint 
(BPT) assays on CNB material to assess overall clinical utility and impact.  
Design: After obtaining IRB approval, the system tumor registry was queried for all patients diagnosed with BC from 8/2019-
12/2021.   We then compared the population of ER+/HER2- patients who had genomic testing by MPT/BPT on the initial CNB 
sample to those who did not to determine rate of NAC usage.  Pearson χ2 test was used to analyze the data using SPSS software. 
Results: 952 patients with newly diagnosed ER+/HER2- BC were identified.  There were 585 patients with reflex genomic testing 
on CNB and 367 who were treated based upon traditional clinicopathologic features alone.   When the two groups were compared, 
NAC was used significantly more often in patients who had not undergone genomic testing on the initial CNB. While 20.1% 
(74/367) of ER+/HER2- patients underwent NAC in the time before the pilot reflex testing program, only 9.74% (57/585) received 
NAC when the genomic result was available on the CNB material (odds ratio (OR), 2.339, P<0.0001). Genomic testing on the initial 
CNB identified many patients for whom NAC would have been offered based upon traditional clinicopathologic features but who 
would not have benefited significantly. 
Conclusions: Patients with newly diagnosed ER+/HER2- breast cancer were significantly more likely to undergo NAC when 
genomic testing was not performed on the initial CNB.  Genomic testing identified patients with high risk clinicopathologic features 
but low risk genomic features who were unlikely to benefit from NAC, allowing the both the clinician and patient to better 
understand the tumor biology and make treatment decisions earlier in the course of care.  Furthermore, despite the cost of genomic 
testing, reflex testing of ER+/HER2- BC on CNB may be cost effective because of the significant reduction in NAC.

Background: Molecular studies have reclassified triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) into basal-like 1 (BL1), basal-like 2 (BL2), 
mesenchymal (MSL), and luminal androgen-receptor (LAR). Studies have noted differences in inflammatory infiltrates and 
 
  
 
S93 
differences in stromal signatures, but no study has focused on the histologic findings specific to each of these molecular subtypes. 
We aim to identify histological findings that are associated to TNBC molecular subtypes. 
Design: Molecular subtypes were extracted from classifications generated by Jiang et al. Cancer Cell 2019, based on data from 
the Cancer Genome Atlas and validated in an external cohort. We downloaded corresponding slides from the TCGA using the GDC 
Data Transfer Tool. We created a list based on a review of the literature of prior histological classifications of TNBC and for 
classical histological findings : squamoid morphology intercellular bridges, keratin whorls, keratinization, matrix production, spindle 
cells, sarcomatoid, tubular, nuclear pleomorphism, color of cytoplasm, abundance of cytoplasm, syncytial growth, heterologous 
elements, NC ratio, presence of DCIS, invasive tumor necrosis, tumoral tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), peritumoral TILs, 
necrosis, cribriform features, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, SBR grade. The slides were reviewed by two observers 
including a pathologist. The presence of these findings was then correlated to molecular subtypes. 
Results: There were 122 patients with molecular subclassification, adequate for histology review, and confirmed TNBC. An 
example of different histological patterns is presented in figure 1. As described in previous studies, TILs were significantly 
associated to molecular subtypes. The only features that two pathologists could reliably replicate with molecular subtypes were 
squamoid morphology, intercellular bridges, keratin whorls, keratinization, cytoplasmic abundance, and NC ratio (table1). The 
presence of DCIS was present in all 4 molecular subtypes, although it was significantly more prevalent in the MSL subtype. Also, 
the color of the cytoplasm, the SBR grade, spindle cells, and matrix production were not specific to a molecular subtype (table 1).

Conclusions: Overall, our findings show some histological findings are significantly associated with molecular subtypes. However, 
if molecular subtyping of TNBC is clinically warranted, molecular ancillary testing will likely be required.

Background: HER2-low expression in breast cancer is defined as HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 1+ or 2+ with a 
negative in-situ hybridization (ISH) assay, according to current scoring criteria. Recent studies have demonstrated clinical benefits 
to patients with primary and metastatic breast cancers showing HER2-low expression using novel anti-HER2 antibody-drug 
conjugates. More HER2-low tumors are recognized by careful exam under 200× and high power (400×) magnification, according to 
a recent article. Herein, we further evaluated HER2-low status in invasive breast tumors with absent and low (1+) protein 
expression. 
Design: We identified 112 invasive breast cancer cases in our pathology database (n=114, including two patients with two tumors 
each), from 2019-2022 that were interpreted as either HER-0 or HER2-1+ on the final pathology report. Two blinded breast 
pathologists independently reviewed the slides using 200× and 400× magnification, categorized into three groups: HER2(0) - 
complete lack of expression; HER2(very low), >0% but <10% tumor cells with faint incomplete membranous staining; and 
HER2(low, 1+), >10% faint incomplete membranous staining. Discordant cases between the two pathologists were rescored 
together. Cohen’s kappa test was used to analyze differences between original report interpretations and rescored HER2 IHC 
results and between the two breast pathologists (BP). 
Results: The original report HER2 interpretation, and the first and second round of re-scoring is shown in the Table 1. Comparison 
of first round of re-scoring between BP1 and BP2 showed moderate agreement with Cohen's kappa value of 0.62. Whereas the 
comparison of original report interpretation and the second re-scoring showed no agreement with Cohen’s kappa value of 0.16.

Conclusions: Given the significant treatment implications and prognosis of HER2-low breast cancers, its recognition as a new 
reporting category in HER2 IHC scoring algorithms is paramount. Our data supports that HER2 IHC results can be reliably 
classified into the following updated categories: HER2(0), HER2(very low), and HER2(low,1+). Analysis should be performed by 
skilled breast pathologists utilizing the 200x and 400x methods. Interpretations with close cut-off values may require consensus 
review by a second pathologist. The significance to patient management in regards to biological significance and tumor behavior 
between the new categories remains to be investigated.

Background: This study aimed to validate the performance and clinical utility of an artificial intelligence (AI) solution in the 
detection of invasive and in situ breast carcinoma in real world clinical routine use in a hospital pathology laboratory setting. 
Design: The study included an enriched cohort of 475 retrospective breast core needle biopsies, comprising 5081 H&E slides, 
enriched with invasive carcinoma (180 biopsies; 38%), DCIS (112; 23%) and ADH (45; 9%). All the slides were digitized and blindly 
processed by the AI solution. Alerts were triggered in case of discrepancies between the AI results and the ground truth (GT) that 
was based on the original sign-out reports, prompting a second review by two independent breast pathologists. After the 
completion of the validation, the solution will be deployed as a quality control system prospectively, on all new breast biopsies. 
Results: The AI solution demonstrated high performance for the detection of invasive carcinoma with an AUC of 0.98 (sensitivity 
and specificity of 95.6% and 91.5%, respectively) and AUC of 0.99 for the detection of DCIS (sensitivity and specificity 
of 95.5% and 95.7%, respectively) when compared with the GT. The AI differentiated well between subtypes/grades of invasive 
and in-situ cancers with an AUC of 0.97 for IDC vs. ILC and AUC of 0.92 for DCIS high grade vs. low grade/ADH, respectively.

support and complement the traditional microscopic evaluation done by pathologists, potentially increasing both diagnostic 
accuracy and patient safety.

Background: Although axillary dissection is no longer indicated for many breast cancer patients with positive axillary sentinel 
lymph nodes (ASLN), intraoperative ASLN assessment is still necessary for some patients. With recent advancements in digital 
pathology, pathologists are increasingly expected to evaluate ASLN via telepathology. 
Design: We aimed to compare the performance characteristics of remote telepathology and conventional on-site intraoperative 
ASLN assessment. Data from ASLN evaluation for breast cancer patients performed by the same group of pathologists at two sites 
between April 2021 and August 2022 was collated. Remote telepathology consultation was conducted via the Aperio 
eSlideManager system. 
 
  
 
S96 
Results: Intraoperative ASLN assessment was performed in a total of 308 patients during the study period (67 telepathology, 241 
on-site evaluations). The overall discrepancy rate between intraoperative and final diagnoses was 10.4% (7/67) for telepathology 
and 6.6% (16/241) for on-site assessment (p=0.0035). The rate of interpretive errors was 1.5% (1/67) for telepathology and 2.5% 
(6/241) for on-site assessment. Of 7 discrepant cases assessed via telepathology, all were false negative, including 1 
macrometastasis (MaMet), 4 micrometastases (MiMet), and 2 isolated tumor cells (ITCs). These included 1 interpretive (invasive 
lobular carcinoma [ILC]) and 6 sampling errors (3 ILCs, 3 invasive carcinomas of no special type [IC-NST]), all in treatment-naïve 
patients. Of 16 discrepant cases assessed on-site, there were 10 sampling and 6 interpretive errors, the latter including 2 false 
positive results in treatment-naïve patients with invasive carcinoma with ductal and lobular features and 4 false negative results in 
patients with IC-NSTs (1 post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy [PNACT], 3 treatment-naïve). The 14 false negative cases included 4 
MaMets, 5 MiMets and 5 ITCs, of which 7 were PNACT. The deferral rate was 3% (2/67) for telepathology and 3.7% (9/241) for on-
site ASLN assessment. All deferrals were atypical cells interpreted as benign on permanent sections, except for 2 cases reported 
as atypical cells on-site but showing MaMets on permanent sections. 
Conclusions: ASLN assessment via telepathology appears to have a higher discrepancy rate compared with on-site evaluation 
(10.4% vs. 6.6%; p=0.0035), while the rates of interpretive errors (1.5% vs. 2.5%) and deferrals (3% vs. 3.7%) are comparable. 
Further studies are warranted to ensure accuracy of ASLN assessment via telepathology.

Background: Different methods are employed by radiologists to biopsy imaging detected lesions in the breast. At our institution, 
the Brevera Biopsy System (Hologic, Inc.) (BBS) is now preferred over the traditional stereotactic guided biopsy (SB) for 
calcifications. From a radiology standpoint, there are benefits, including improved time and efficiency of work flow, as well as the 
real-time confirmation of calcifications in the sample. Multiple biopsies can be taken at the same time, which also improves 
sampling. However, there is an increase in slide number per biopsy compared SB, with an increase in case review time for the 
pathologist. The aim of this study is to compare the diagnoses and attributes of biopsies take by SB and BBS in terms of both 
pathologist workload and sampling efficacy. 
Design: Pathology reports and slides were collected from stereotactic breast biopsies performed during the entire 2012 calendar 
year and compared to breast biopsies performed utilizing the Brevara system during the 2019 calendar year. The slides were 
retrospectively reviewed for diagnostic findings. Diagnosis, age at biopsy, BIRADS score, identification of calcifications, number of 
blocks per case, and additional levels ordered were compared. 
Results: 85 cases utilizing SB were compared against 78 cases utilizing BBS. BBS detected significantly more disease and 
showed a broader range of diagnoses including benign (n=33), atypia of any type (n=9) and carcinoma in situ (n=27) categorized 
together as “pre-cancer”, and invasive carcinoma (n=9). Fewer cases of atypia or malignancy were detected by SB. The difference 
between diagnostic categories between the two methods was statistically significant (table 1). On average, the number of blocks 
per case was 2.4 for BBS and 1.1 for SB (p=<0.001). Patient age, BIRADS score, presence of calcifications, and whether additional 
levels were needed to find calcifications did not significantly differ between sampling methods.

Conclusions: In a uniform sample population matched by radiologic risk stratification (BIRADS score) and age, BBS increased 
pathology work-load but resulted in a significant increase in detection of atypia/malignancy compared to SB.  The data suggests 
that BBS is a superior sampling method for the detection of atypia, DCIS, and malignancy associated with calcifications.

Background: Poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) recently have been approved by the FDA for the 
treatment of germline BRCA1/2 associated breast cancer. PARPi have also been found to be efficacious in BRCA wild-type 
(BRCAwt) carcinomas with high genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH-high) or other identifiable mutations in homologous 
recombination repair (HR) genes in ovarian carcinomas. The goal of this study was to retrospectively investigate tumor mutations in 
HR genes and LOH status in advanced stage breast carcinomas (BC). 
Design: Patients diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma between 2019 and 2022 whose tumors underwent whole 
exome sequencing were identified. LOH was determined by analyzing single nucleotide polymorphisms throughout the 
genome. Tumor pathologic genomic alterations and LOH score were collected. Patients’ medical records were also reviewed to 
obtain data on demographic and pathologic characteristics. The cohort was divided into three groups: BRCA1/2 mutated 
(BRCAmt), BRCA wild-type HR-mutated (BRCAwt- HRmt), and HR wild-type (HRwt). 
Results: We identified 36 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast carcinoma; their clinicopathological characteristics 
and the associations with HRD are given in the table. Of the 36 cases, 12 (33%) had HR mutations, including 3 (8%) BRCA1, 3 
(8%) BRCA2, and 6 (17%) BRCAwt-HR (Figure 1). There was no association between HR mutations and Nottingham grade (NG) 
or triple negativity (TN). LOH data was available for 23 cases. Seven (7/23, 30%) had HR mutations, including 3 (43%) in BRCA1/2 
and 4 (57%) in BRCAwt-HR (figure 2A). Eight (35%) and 16 (70%) of the 23 were LOH-high using 16% and 10% cutoffs 
respectively. LOH-high (≥10%) had a positive association with BRCAmt (p<0.0001). BRCA1/2 mutations were only identified in 
LOH-high (≥10%) cases. There was no association between LOH-high (≥16%) and BRCAmt. Five of 15 (33%), and 2 of 7 (29%) 
LOH-low cases had HR mutations with 16% and 10% cutoffs respectively (figure 2B and 2C). LOH-high was positively associated 
with TN, but not NG.

Conclusions: 17% of 36 cases showed HR gene mutations other than BRCA 1/2. Although LOH-high showed positive association 
with BRCAmt only, a subset of LOH-low cases showed mutations in BRCAwt-HR and/or BRCA genes. The necessity of next 
generation sequencing with homologous recombination deficiency gene analysis requires further investigation in large clinical trials.

Background: Anti-PD1/PD-L1 clinical trials in breast cancer have allowed both small biopsies and large surgical specimens for 
PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing. Many research studies on PD-L1 expression used tissue microarrays (TMA) in order to 
test a large number of tumors in a cost-effective manner. However, the concordance between small tumor samples and large tumor 
sections for PD-L1 expression has not been well studied. Here, we compared PD-L1 IHC staining between TMAs and whole slide 
sections (WSS) using two FDA-approved assays and three scores. 
 
  
 
S99 
Design: The study cohort consisted of 24 patients (14 with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and 10 with non-TNBC) 
diagnosed between 2004 and 2016. WSSs of surgically resected tumors and the corresponding TMAs (1.0 mm puncher, duplicate 
punches) were stained for PD-L1 using the Dako 22C3 and 28-8 assays. The tumor cell (TC) score was calculated as the percent 
of invasive carcinoma cells showing membranous staining for PD-L1. The tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC) score was assessed 
as the proportion of tumor area occupied by PD-L1-positive immune cells. The combined positive score (CPS) was calculated as 
the number of PD-L1 stained immune cells and invasive carcinoma cells divided by the number of invasive carcinoma cells, 
multiplied by 100. For TC and IC, 1% or greater was considered positive. For CPS, two cutoffs of 1 and 10 were applied. 
Concordance was evaluated based on positive versus negative categories. 
Results: The numbers of PD-L1 positive tumors and the concordance rates in each scoring method are shown in Table 1. The 
concordance rates ranged from 71% to 100%. There were 30 discordant events in all comparisons: 22 had positive staining only in 
WSSs, and 8 had positive staining only in TMAs. Among the tumors that showed discordance in any of the comparisons, only one 
tumor, which was a TNBC, had discordance in all scoring methods and with both 22C3 and 28-8.

Conclusions: In a minor proportion of tested tumors, TMA underestimated or overestimated PD-L1 staining compared with WSS. 
CPS with a cutoff of 10 improved the concordance rate in TNBC over CPS with a cutoff of 1. Our findings suggest that in clinical 
settings using CPS 10 as the cutoff, small tumor samples are comparable to large tumor sections in the vast majority of breast 
tumors.

Background: Molecular apocrine breast carcinoma (MABC), defined as estrogen and progesterone receptor negative breast 
cancer with androgen receptor (AR) expression, is rare. It encompasses different morphologic entities with or without apocrine 
differentiation. Histopathological, molecular and prognostic characteristics of these tumors are not fully understood. The aim of this 
work is to better characterize the subgroup of MABC. 
Design: We analyzed clinicopathological and genomic characteristics of 92 MABCs, retrieved from the files of three Cancer 
Centers between 2004 and 2020. Clinicopathological, immunohistochemical characteristics and follow-up information, were 
collected. Molecular profiles were obtained by Exome and RNA sequencing by NGS and analysis of overall (OS) and progression-
free survival was done according to Kaplan-Meier method. 
Results: Among the 92 MABCs, 24 were HER2-amplified (HER2+) and 68 triple-negative (Luminal androgen receptor tumors 
(LAR)). These two groups shared some histomolecular characteristics, but some features were significantly different. Basal marker 
expression (CK5/6 (p=0.040) and EGFR (p=0.006)) was more frequently observed in LAR while ERBB2 mutations (p=0.027) were 
more frequent in HER2+ tumors. When focusing on the LAR subgroup, tumors with apocrine morphology had lower grade 
(p=0.024) and proliferation index (p<0.001) than those without apocrine features. The former lesions displayed higher expression 
levels of AR (p<0.001), FOXA1, GGT1, BCL2 (p<0.001) and GCDFP15 (p=0.002), and lower expression levels of FOXC1 and 
SOX10 (p<0.001). PIK3CA mutations were more frequent in tumors with apocrine features (p=0.043). Morphological, 
immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics of these tumors are compared in the Table. OS was significantly better for

HER2+ tumors compared to LAR (p=0.029) and for LAR tumors with apocrine morphology compared to those without apocrine

(p=0.017) (Fig. 2).

Conclusions: MABC is a peculiar tumor subgroup which encompasses distinct entities with specific histomolecular and prognostic 
characteristics. Excluding HER2+ tumors which harbor a good prognosis due to targeted therapy, LAR tumors seems to be a 
heterogeneous subgroup with a worse prognosis, including more than only one entity. RNA sequencing will be presented during 
the USCAP 2023 meeting, and will attempt to shed light on this complex tumor subgroup.

Background: HER2-low is a newly described entity due to the benefit from target therapy of Trastuzumab/Deruxtecan. 
Consistency in evaluating HER2-low is a new challenge for the practicing pathologists. The aims of the study are to: 1) evaluate the 
inter-observer and intra-observer variability in interpreting HER2 based on the new definition, and 2) examine the benefit from 
educational online HER2-know material. 
Design: Tissue Microarray (TMA) slides from the College of American Pathologists (CAP) stained with HER-2 as part of the 
laboratory proficiency test for four years (2018-2021) were retrieved. The TMAs were stained with HercepTest Antibody. Total of 
156 readable TMA cores were evaluated by 5 practicing breast pathologists (experience range of 2-15 years; including 3 full time 
breast pathologists) and 3 surgical pathology fellows. ASCO-CAP 2018 scoring guidelines were followed. A precise percentage of 
scoring (0+, 1+, and 2+) was recorded. After reviewing an educational online material of HER-2 know “experts-reviewed 
challenging cases”, the TMAs’ order was shuffled, and the cores were re-scored. Cases scored 3+ were removed if majority of 
each group agreed on the scoring. Results were compared to assess consistency among the entire group, intra-observer, pre- and 
post-online preview, and between practicing and in-training pathologists. Fleiss' kappa test is used to assess the agreement among 
the participants with K= 0.81-1.00 almost perfect agreement, and K= 0.61-0.80 a substantial agreement. 
 
  
 
S102 
Results: The kappa was calculated based on the majority agreement among three categories; practicing pathologists (at least 4), 
trainees (at least 2), and combined (at least 6 participants). Overall consistency of scoring HER-2 0+ versus 1+ or 2+ was higher 
than scoring them individually. Overall scoring 1+ was the lowest in agreement compared to scoring 0 and 2+, and it was further 
decreased after reviewing the online material. The agreement improved after the online review for trainees but worsened for the 
practicing pathologists (Table 1). 
*Total number of cases is variable based on the eliminated 3+ scored cases in the three evaluating groups.

Background: Metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) is an aggressive type of triple-negative breast cancer characterized by complex 
genomes. Based on whole-exome and targeted sequencing, it has been suggested that ~40% of MBCs display homologous 
recombination (HR) DNA repair deficiency (HRD), however only a minority of MBCs benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy. 
We performed an HRD assessment of MBCs utilizing the ‘gold standard’ of whole genome sequencing (WGS) to define whether 
these cancers harbor only partial genomic features of HRD or are classified as true HRD, and if so, whether HRD is underpinned 
by bi-allelic alterations affecting HR-related genes. 
Design: Twenty-one MBC were reviewed according to the WHO criteria. Estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 status were evaluated 
according to clinical guidelines. Tumor and normal samples were subjected to WGS at a median of 94x (range 75x-107x) and 49x 
(range 42x-62x), respectively. Single nucleotide substitution (SBS) mutational signatures were inferred using Signal. Large-scale 
state transitions (LSTs) were defined using state-of-the-art methods. HRD was predicted using the Homologous Recombination 
Deficiency Detect (HRDetect) classifier. The presence of mutations, copy number alterations and rearrangements targeting HRD 
genes was interrogated. 
Results: Of the 21 MBCs, 9 were chondroid, 5 spindle cell, 5 squamous, 1 osseous, and 1 myoepithelial. All MBCs were of 
histologic grade 3 and most (95%) were ER-/HER2-; 1 case was ER-/HER2+. SBS analysis revealed a dominant HRD mutational 
signature (i.e. COSMIC SBS3 and/or SBS8) in 8/21 (38%) MBCs, and 10/21 (48%) MBCs had LST-high scores. Five MBCs (24%) 
displayed both dominant HRD SBS mutational signatures and high LST scores. HRDetect, the “gold standard” for WGS, however, 
demonstrated that only three (14%) MBCs harbored a complete HRD genomic profile, characterized by a marked enrichment in 
deletions with microhomology, HRD SBS mutational signatures, LST-high scores and HRD rearrangement signatures. Analysis of 
the repertoire of somatic genetic alterations of the three bona fide HRD MBCs demonstrated the presence of bi-
allelic BRCA1 mutations in two cases. 
 
  
 
S103 
Conclusions: Our findings reconcile the clinical observations of relative chemo-resistance of MBCs and their genomic profiles, 
given that only a minority of MBCs (14%) harbor a complete HRD, despite the high prevalence of a dominant HRD SBS mutational 
signature and LST-high scores. Bona fide HRD MBCs often harbor bi-allelic inactivation of BRCA1.

Background: In the recent DESTINY-Breast04 trial, patients with previously treated Her2 low metastatic (met) breast 
cancer treated with Trastuzumab had significant improvement in survival compared to those treated with chemotherapy. This 
provides a new targeted therapeutic option for patients with met Her2 low breast cancer, defined as Her2 
immunohistochemistry (ihc) score of 1+ or 2+ and negative FISH result. This has created an impetus for detailed Her2 ihc scoring 
(Negative=0&1+; Equivocal=2+, Positive= 3+). The goal of our study was to compare the Her2 ihc scores of paired primary breast 
cancers (PBC) and mets, with particular emphasis on Her2 low criteria and its implications for detailed ihc interpretation. 
Design: Using the institution pathology database from 2002, we identified 276 cases of PBC and paired mets. We reviewed and 
scored all Her2 ihc slides using detailed CAP Her2 ihc (0,1+,2+,3+) criteria and FISH scores, checked for concordance, and 
calculated the incidence of Her2 low (see Table below). 
Results: The met sites included: bone(84), liver(60), lung(44), brain(36), soft tissue(24), lymph nodes(20), gyn(5), and GI(3) and 
had no effect on ihc score. Compared to the primary, Her2 ihc score in the mets changed in 113/276 (41%) cases; increased in 
71/276 (26%) and decreased in 42 (15%). In the context of Her2 low criteria, these results were only meaningful in 76/276 (28%) 
cases that were upgraded from ihc score 0 to 1+/2+ (49/71=69%) or that were downgraded to 0 (27/42=64%). The remaining 
cases were already scored either 1+ or 2+ and thus qualified as Her2 low by criteria. The few discordances of 0 to 3+ were due to 
the primary being tested in the 1990s and not meeting the ischemic and fixation times and the mets being tested 10 years later. 
The few discordances of 3+ to lower were due to heterogeneity.

Conclusions: The concordance rate of Her2 ihc scores in matched PBC and mets decreased from 73% to 59% with detailed 
analysis. While concordance was highest in 3+ cases (90%), it was lowest in PBC that changed from 0 to 1+/2+ in mets. The 
incidence of Her2 low was higher in the mets by 8% compared to primary. We agree that Her2 should be tested in mets and 
recommend comparing the results with the primary, due to meaningful differences in Her2 low scores as seen in 28% of our 
cases, which will have clinical implications in the new Her2 low era of treatment.

Background: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is exceedingly rare in the breast, with <50 cases reported. While ER/PR/HER2 
triple-negative, MEC is characterized as a special subtype of breast carcinoma with significantly better prognosis than conventional 
basal-type tumors. Hidradenoma (HA) is considered a benign cutaneous adnexal neoplasm showing histomorphologic overlap with 
MEC. Rare cases of HA have been reported in the breast. Molecularly, both salivary gland MEC and cutaneous HA harbor 
recurrent CRTC1-MAML2 or less common CRTC3-MAML2 rearrangements. We previously described 2 cases of breast MEC and 
confirmed that they also harbor CRTC1-MAML2 fusions. We now report the largest series to date of breast/axillary HA, with 
clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical (IHC) and molecular comparison to 3 breast MEC. 
Design: Ten cases are included in this study: 3 were diagnosed as MEC and 7 cases as HA. Nine arose in the breast and 1 was 
axillary. IHC for high- and low-molecular weight keratins, p63, GATA3, SOX10, mammaglobin, GCDFP15, AR and MUC4, as well 
as breakapart MAML2 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), were performed. All cases were subjected to next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) for mutation testing using a 648-gene panel and fusion testing using a 137-gene panel. 
Results: Patients included 9 females and 1 male, with a mean age of 48 years. Cases presented as a palpable mass (n=5), mass 
on imaging (n=4) or asymmetry (n=1). MEC cases were low-intermediate grade, and no cases showed highly atypical or 
pleomorphic features. MEC demonstrated a more infiltrative growth pattern than HA, with myosin and calponin immunostains 
highlighting an in situ component in all 3 cases. Distinguishing immunostains included SOX10 (≥90% positive cells staining in MEC, 
≤10% in HA), mammaglobin (≥40% in MEC, ≤10% in HA) and MUC4 (≥20% in MEC, ≤5% in HA); other markers were similar. All 
cases were positive for MAML2 FISH. Nine cases demonstrated a CRTC1-MAML2 rearrangement by NGS, and 1 MEC harbored 
a CRTC3-MAML2 fusion. Mutational burden was low, with only 1 HA exhibiting a MAP3K1 pathogenic alteration.

Conclusions: Breast MEC and HA show considerable histologic overlap and MAML2 gene fusions. Their immunophenotypes are 
also similar, with apparent differences in SOX10, mammaglobin and MUC4 stains. As in salivary gland, breast MEC cases harbor 
infrequent CRTC3-MAML2 rearrangements, a novel finding. More work is needed to elucidate this spectrum of MAML2-positive 
neoplasms and distinguish benign from malignant tumors.

Background: Abemaciclib is FDA-approved for adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, node-positive 
breast carcinomas with Ki67 expression (Ki67%) ≥20%. There are no guidelines regarding specimen type to use for scoring Ki67%. 
 
  
 
S105 
Since prior studies have shown inconsistent variation in Ki67% between biopsies and resections, we set out to evaluate Ki67% 
variability between sample type and possible impact on drug eligibility by performing manual counts and quantitative image 
analysis (QIA). 
Design: We found 51 consecutive breast cancer patients with ER positive, HER2 negative, and at least N1 stage disease. Per 
patient, we stained a block from 1) the core needle biopsy (CNB), 2) resection (RES), and 3) largest lymph node metastasis (LN) 
for MIB-1 using the Dako Omnis assay. Two to three pathologists independently manually counted Ki67% using the weighted Ki67 
scoring protocol recommended by the Ki67 IWG. QIA was also used to score Ki67%. 
Results: Specimens comprised 64 CNB (13 patients with multiple CNB), 53 RES and 51 LN (total = 168). The highest Ki67% was 
in CNB in 20 patients, 20 in LN, and 11 in RES. The lowest Ki67% was in LN in 18 patients, 17 in RES and 16 in CNB. The 
average Ki67% difference between the highest specimen and lowest/patient was 8.89 (range: 0.44 to 38.2). There was an impact 
on treatment choice in 9 patients with the highest Ki67% in CNB in 4 patients, LN in 3 patients, and RES in 2 patients. Overall, the 
average Ki67% difference between CNB vs RES was 4.65, 6.89 for CNB vs LN, and 5.43 RES vs LN; however, these were not 
statistically significant differences (p = 0.90, 0.88, 0.97). For 13 patients with two CNB, the average difference between the 2 CNB 
was 7.47, and 4 patients would have had changes in treatment eligibility. The average difference between automatic scoring with 
QIA versus manual counting was 3.86 (range: 0.03 to 21.76), with near statistical significance (p=0.051). A total of 17 specimens 
would have had clinically significant differences between automatic vs manual scoring (< vs ≥20% Ki67), which would have 
impacted 13 patients. 
Conclusions: There was no statistical difference in mean Ki67% between CNB, RES, and LN specimens using the weighted Ki67 
scoring protocol; however, 9 patients in our cohort (18%) would have treatment changes based on which specimen was chosen for 
analysis and 13 (25%) whether manual or automated counting was performed. To ensure reproducible eligibility assessment, 
further refinement in scoring Ki67% is needed.

Disclosures: Therese Bocklage: None; Virgilius Cornea: None; Mara Chambers: None; Jessica Moss: None; Sara Bachert: None 
Background: Abemaciclib is FDA-approved for adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, axillary node-
positive breast carcinoma with Ki67 expression ≥20%. As there are no required Ki67 scoring methods, we chose to evaluate 
variability in Ki67 expression (Ki67%) among proposed scoring methods to assess possible impact on patient eligibility for 
abemaciclib. 
Design: We identified 51, treatment-naive patients meeting eligibility criteria for abemaciclib. Per patient, we stained a 
representative block from 1) the core needle biopsy (CNB), 2) resection (RES), and 3) largest lymph node (LN) metastasis for MIB-
1 using the Dako Omnis assay, the recommended companion diagnostic assay. Two breast pathologists manually counted Ki67% 
by three methods: 1) overall estimation (EST), 2) weighted Ki67 score (per the Ki67 international working group (IKWG) protocol) 
(WT), and 3) unweighted Ki67 score (per IKWG protocol) (UNWT). 
Results: Specimens included 64 CNB (13 patients had multiple CNB), 53 resections (2 patients with multifocal disease), and 51 LN 
(168 specimens in toto). Average range of Ki67% between pathologists was 5.5 for EST method, 3.59 for UNWT, and 3.60 for WT. 
When sorted by specimen type, there was a statistically significant difference in range between EST vs UNWT in CNB and LN 
(p=0.059, p=0.014) and EST vs WT in RES and LNs (p=0.034, p=0.015). There was no significant difference in UNW vs WT. Using 
EST, there were 28 cases with interobserver variability resulting in treatment eligibility discordancy (Ki67 score < vs ≥ 20%), to 
include 10 CNB, 9 RES, and 9 LN (19 patients). However, this discordance was seen in only 13 patients for WT, and 14 patients for 
UNWT (Table 1). For all specimens, there was a significant difference between EST vs WT (p=0.02), but not for EST vs UNWT 
(p=0.078). However, when sorted by specimen type, there was no significant difference between the three scoring methods. (EST 
vs WT for: CNB p=0.285, RES p=0.139, LN p=0.148). The averaged UNWT count was the highest count in 63 specimens, followed 
by EST in 53, and WT in 37.

Conclusions: UNWT and WT trend toward better interobserver variability compared to the EST. Count differences between 
pathologists that would have led to treatment difference were minimized using the WT protocol; however, this was not statistically 
significant when sorted by specimen type. Overall, our study suggests that further refinement in Ki67% scoring is advisable to 
reduce clinically significant manual score variation.

Background: Molecular subtypes of TNBC show distinct clinical outcomes and suggest new therapies. However, therapeutic 
options are still limited for the immune-suppressed subtype. Here, we compare histologic features and gene expression patterns of 
basal-like immune-activated (BLIA) and basal-like immune-suppressed (BLIS) TNBCs. 
Design: Stage II and III breast cancers were identified in the pathology archives (2005-2015) and triple negative status was 
determined from Cancer Registry data. Histologic subtype, presence of apocrine, metaplastic, syncytial or micropapillary features, 
nuclear grade, mitotic score, and Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) were recorded. Cases were macrodissected and evaluated 
using the NanoString BC360 gene expression assay. Histologic and molecular features were then compared between BLIA 
(characterized by upregulation of B, T and NK cells) and BLIS (characterized by the downregulation of these pathways). 
Results: Of 72 TNBCs, 41 cases were classified as BLIA (56.9%) and 14 as BLIS (19.4%), with the remainder as luminal androgen 
receptor or mesenchymal types. BLIA and BLIS tumors differed significantly in TILs, with BLIA average TILs of 32% vs BLIS 
average TILs of 9% (p- value<0.001) and differed significantly in survival (BLIA average 9.17 vs BLIS average 5.54 years; (p- value 
<0.001). Both BLIA and BLIS tumors were predominantly high nuclear grade and had high mitotic scores. Syncytial architecture 
was seen only in the BLIA group (2/41 cases) with no significant difference between the groups in lobular, metaplastic, apocrine, 
micropapillary or other features. Using a p-value of 0.01, 99 genes were differentially expressed between BLIA and BLIS tumors. 
The majority of the genes overexpressed in the BLIA tumors were immune cell-associated. Four genes were found to be 
overexpressed in the BLIS group, including FOXC2, MAPT, BAMBI and HES1. Overexpression of these genes in tumor cells has 
been associated with poor survival and chemotherapy resistance in preclinical models and in other malignancies. 
Conclusions: BLIA and BLIS subtypes are distinguished histologically by the level of TILs but otherwise show similar morphologic 
features. In gene expression analysis, BLIS tumors showed higher expression of four genes (FOXC2, MAPT, BAMBI and HES1). 
Overexpression of these genes may be useful as clinical markers of the BLIS phenotype, especially in tumors with intermediate 
TILs, and may also serve as potential targets in this therapeutically challenging subtype of TNBC.

Background: HER2-targeted therapies for HER2-low metastatic BC (mBC) are under investigation, but HER2 assays currently 
used to select patients for approved anti-HER2 therapies are optimized for high HER2 expression and are not validated for HER2-
low detection. Approximately 50-60% of BCs traditionally categorized as HER2 negative (HER2-neg) express low levels of HER2 
(IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH- and the interobserver agreement in evaluation of IHC scores of 0 and 1+ using current HER2 assays 
ranges from <70%. Our objectives were to assess the prevalence of HER2-low among HER2-neg cases based on rescored HER2 
IHC slides and describe patients characteristics of HER2-low vs HER2 IHC 0 mBC. 
Design: The retrospective study included patients with mBC with avaliable HER2 slides diagnosed between january 2021 and may 
2022. Observers were blinded to historical HER2 scores. HER2 was assessed using Ventana 4B5 clone in a Benchmark ULTRA 
instrument.  BCs were categorized as HER2-low or HER2 IHC 0. The prevalence of HER2-low BC among patients originally scored 
 
  
 
S107 
as HER2-neg was measured. Demographics and clinicopathological characteristics were retrieved from medical records. 
Concordance between historical HER2 scores and rescores was assessed. 
Results: HER2 rescores were obtained for 7230 patients (mean age, 59 y). HER2-low prevalence was 58.4%. The majority of 
these HER2-low cases were clinical stage II, with 7.8% being stage III. Most of the HER2-low cancers had a invasive ductal 
phenotype (87%), histologic grades 2 (94%) were ER positive (96%), PR positive (80%), and were luminal molecular subtypes 
(96%). Compared to HER2-negative cancers, HER2-low BC showed a higher ER positivity (p<0.05), higher pathologic stage 
(p<0.05), and were more likely to be of the luminal A subtype (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in age, tumor size, 
histologic type, histologic grade, presence of lymphovascular invasion or PR score.  Concordance rate between historical and 
rescored slides for HER2-status classification was 84.8%. 
Conclusions: HER-2 low breast cancers represent a heterogeneous group, and the majority are lower grade, early-stage, 
hormonal receptor positive with luminal molecular phenotype. Since data on HER2-low prevalence in BC is limited, this study 
provides a baseline clinicopathologic and molecular features of HER2-low BCs and support development of best practices for 
identifying patients with HER2-low expression who may benefit from HER2-targeted therapies.

Disclosures: Ankica Braun: None; Andrea Madrigrano: None; Vijaya Reddy: None; Paolo Gattuso: None 
Background: Breast conserving surgery is a common approach for women with early-stage breast cancer. Nearly 1/3 women 
undergoing lumpectomy will have a positive margin on final pathology and surgeons have adopted performing shave margins at the 
time of index surgery to reduce the need for additional surgery. This practice has led to increased workload in pathology.  We 
performed a retrospective study to assess how the findings in additional shave margins impact final margin status and need for 
additional surgery to assess if it justifies the increased workload. 
Design: A retrospective chart review from 2019 to 2021 evaluating breast conserving specimens with the pre-operative diagnosis 
of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive cancer for which additional shave margins were taken. 
Results: A total of 97 DCIS cases were identified, 17 were grade 1, 48 grade 2, and 32 grade 3. All patients were female with age 
range of 36-87 years (mean 62 years). 33/97 (34%) cases contained DCIS in the additional shaving margins, in 20/33 (60%) the 
DCIS was <2 mm from the margin of resection, of which 3/20 (15%) were grade 1, 11/20 (55%) grade 2, and 6/20 (30%) grade 3. 
18/20 (90%) of these cases underwent re-excision, 11/18 had residual tumor, 5 cases were <2 mm and 6 cases ?2 mm from the 
margins of resection. The number of shaved margins taken ranged from 1 to 9, mean 3.5. The number of glass slides examined 
ranged from 1-52, mean 12.1. There were a total of 88 invasive ductal carcinoma. All patients were female with age range 31-96 
years, mean 63 years. 18/88 (20%) contained tumor in the shaved margins (12 DCIS and 6 invasive tumors). In 3 cases the tumor 
was ?2 mm and in 15 was <2 mm from the margin of resection, with positive margin for invasive tumor in 1 case. 6/15 cases 
underwent re-excision, residual tumor was found in 5 (4 DCIS, 1 invasive). The number of shaved margins ranged from 1- 7, mean 
3.6. The number of glass slides examined ranged from 1-38, mean 8.8. 
Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that additional shave margins performed at the index operation did reduce the need for re-
excision in 13% of patients with DCIS. In palpable lesions and those with invasive carcinoma, this approach is of greatest benefit. 
Patients with large spans of DCIS that are associated with non-calcified disease are at greatest risk for continued positive margins 
despite shave margins, although reduced. Although re-excision rates are reduced it comes at the expense of increased burden on 
pathology.

Background: Breast cancer (BC) with low human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression is attracting much 
attention due to the breakthrough progress of novel anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugates. In this study we aim to investigate the 
changes of HER2 expression in patients with HER2-low BC and their distant metastases, so as to further clarify the dynamic 
characteristics of HER2 low expression in the process of disease progression. 
 
  
 
S108 
Design: This study included patients with confirmed HER2 low breast cancer (defined as IHC1+ or IHC2+/ISH-) diagnosed from 
2012 to 2021. HER2 expression was tested by Ventana 4B5, and was rescored by pathologists blinded to historical HER2 scores. 
We evaluated HER2 status of primary and metastatic sites, compared the impact of different clinicopathological parameters on 
HER2 status of metastases and compared the disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with different HER2 status in 
metastases. 
Results: 98 patients were included. All HER2 IHC scores were confirmed and the consistent rate with the original pathological 
report was 81.1%. 27.6% of the patients showed different HER2 status in metastases (Fig. 1). The HER2 discordance rate differed 
among different metastatic sites (lung/pleura vs liver vs bone vs skin and soft tissue vs others = 14.3% vs 24.4% 53.8% vs 27.3% 
vs 60.0%, p=0.040) (Figure 2A). The higher the T stage of the primary BC, the higher the rate of HER2 discordance was observed 
(T1 vs T2 vs T3=9.1% vs 27.3% vs 66.7%, p=0.042) (Fig. 2B). For the specimen type of metastasis, the rate of HER2 discordance 
was higher in surgical specimen than biopsy (45.0% vs 23.1%, p=0.050) (Fig. 2C). No difference of HER2 discordance rate was 
found between HER2-1+ and HER2-2+ patients. But comparing HER2 IHC score, HER2-2+ patients were less likely to have 
consistent metastatic HER2 levels than HER2-1+ patients (56.4% vs 39.6%, p=0.006) (Fig. 2D). No difference in survival outcomes 
was observed between patients with different HER2 status in metastases. 
Figure 1 - 120 
 
 
Figure 2 - 120 
 
Conclusions: There is a possibility of HER2 expression alteration in the metastases of HER2-low BC. The rate of altered HER2 
low expression was different among different metastatic sites, and the discordant rate of bone metastasis was the highest. The 
discordant rates of HER2 were also different among different T stages of primary BC and different specimen type of metastasis. No 
 
  
 
S109 
difference of HER2 discordance rate was found between HER2-1+ and HER2-2+ patients. No prognostic significance was 
observed. 
 
121  Aberrant E-cadherin Expression in Lobular Carcinoma in Situ: A Comprehensive 
Immunohistochemical Evaluation of N-terminal, Extracellular, and C-terminal E-cadherin 
Domains

Disclosures: Rita Canas-Marques: None; David Pinto: None; Maria Antónia Vasconcelos: None 
Background: Approximately 15% of invasive lobular carcinomas show aberrant expression of E-cadherin (E-cad), but the 
frequency of aberrant E-cad expression in lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is less well characterized. Further, among LCIS cases 
with aberrant E-cad expression, the domains of the E-cad molecule that are aberrantly expressed and the relationship to 
expression of other components of the cadherin-catenin complex and to LCIS subtype have not been previously analyzed. 
Design: To address this, we identified 50 cases of LCIS without concurrent invasive carcinoma diagnosed in core needle 
biopsies and categorized each case as classic (type A or B), florid, or pleomorphic using the WHO 5th edition criteria. In 
addition, for each case immunohistochemical staining was performed to identify the frequency and patterns of expression of 
components of the cadherin-catenin complex including the E-cad N-terminal (N; 36B5, Leica), extracellular (ECD; EP700Y, 
Abcam), and C-terminal (C; M168, Abcam) domains, p120 catenin (EP66, Leica), and beta-catenin (17C2, Leica). 
Results: Mean patient age at diagnosis was 55 yrs (range: 38-74 yrs). The most common radiologic presentation was 
microcalcifications (36/50;72%). The majority of LCIS were of classic type (32/50, 64%; 22 type A; 10 type B), and 9 cases each 
were florid (18%) or pleomorphic (18%). Loss of membrane expression of all 3 E-cad domains was seen in 34 cases (68%) 
whereas aberrant expression of one or more E-cad domains was seen in 16(32%) including 3/22 classic type A, 3/10 classic type 
B, 5/9 florid and 5/9 pleomorphic LCIS. The frequency of aberrant expression of E-cad domains was 
N+ECD+C=5(Fig1);N+ECD=5;C+ECD=2(Fig2);C only=2;ECD only=1;N only=1(see Table). Aberrant E-cad expression was most 
often partial, fragmented membrane staining; complete, circumferential membrane staining and cytoplasmic staining were less 
frequently seen. Among the cases with aberrant E-cad expression, aberrant expression of p120 catenin, beta-catenin, or both was 
seen in 4 cases, 3 cases and 5 cases, respectively.

Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate aberrant E-cad expression in LCIS by examining expression of 
distinct domains of E-cad. Our results demonstrate that aberrant E-cad expression is seen in all LCIS subtypes and may be due to 
expression of various E-cad domains, singly and in combination. This, in turn, likely reflects different mechanisms of E-cad 
alterations in LCIS, the underlying nature of which merits further study.

Background: Variable penetrance genes, including ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, PALB2, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, and TP53, are 
linked to genetic predisposition to breast cancer and have become increasingly prevalent in screening panels as a result 
of improvements in technology. The understanding of the clinical significance of these mutations is currently limited. Early 
identification of mutation carriers and understanding their clinicopathological features will assist in understanding the screening 
tests and surveillance needed for patients with the goal of mortality reduction. Our study aimed to analyze the clinicopathological 
presentation of patients within our healthcare system who carry mutations in variable penetrance genes. 
Design: This study analyzed 103 patients within our healthcare system who tested positive for mutations in variable penetrance 
genes. The study team collected data on clinical characteristics, including age at diagnosis and personal and family history of 
cancer, as well as pathologic characteristics, including hormone receptor status, cancer type, tumor size, stage, and grade, then 
quantified the data and observed various trends to understand how these mutations impact prevalence and progression of 
disease.  
Results: In the cohort, 31% (12/39) of ATM patients were diagnosed with breast cancer, 0% (0/6) for BARD1, 20% (2/10) 
for BRIP1, 21% (4/19) for PALB2, 75% (3/4) for PTEN, 22% (2/9) for RAD51C, 25% (2/8) for RAD51D, and 38% (3/8) 
for TP53. Notable trends include the presence of only grade 2 and 3 invasive carcinomas, 100% of ATM cancers being estrogen 
receptor positive, and 80% (4/5) of PTEN cancers being classified as ductal carcinoma in situ (Table 1).

Table 1: Pathologic Data of Breast Cancers 
 
Conclusions: Evaluation of the prevalence of variable penetrance genes in our healthcare system will aid in early identification of 
breast cancer susceptibility in patients and their relatives. The data show that patients with PTEN and TP53 mutations had higher 
prevalence’s of breast cancer than the other genes studied. Many of the tumors are of higher grade, which is helpful to clinicians 
and patients in understanding the significance of these mutations. Knowing the clinicopathological features of these patients will 
enable physicians to expedite screening, improve preventive medicine and target treatment protocols.

Background: Many institutions use cytokeratin immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast 
cancer. We validated an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to screen sentinel lymph node metastasis with an aim to replace 
cytokeratin IHCs. 
Design: We included 234 sentinel lymph nodes from 108 invasive breast carcinoma resections. All lymph nodes had two levels 
stained with H&E and one level stained with cytokeratin IHC. All slides had already been scanned into whole slide images (WSIs) 
and stored in clinical Imaging Managing System (IMS) during our routine digital workflow. The deepest H&E level WSIs were 
streamed directly from IMS into Visiopharm (VIS) platform without downloading/uploading. All WSIs were automatically batch 
analyzed using VIS tumor Detection algorithm without manual region of interest (ROI) selection. After the analysis, the results were 
exported into an Excel spreadsheet with the largest area of metastasis in mm2 and length in mm. 
Results: VIS AI algorithm detected all 46 metastases including 19 macro-metastases, 26 micro-metastases, 1 case with isolated 
tumor cells (ITC). There were no false negative cases, while false positive cases were 110 after comparing with cytokeratin-stained 
slides. The results showed a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 41.5%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 29.5% and negative 
predictive value (NPV) of 100%. VIS AI annotated all potential metastasis on WSIs which was either confirmed as true metastasis 
or excluded as false metastasis very easily and quickly (average time 10 seconds). The false positivity was caused 
predominantly by histiocytes (52.7%), followed by crushed lymphocytes (18.2%), germinal centers (14.5%), blood vessels (6.4%), 
lymphocytes around adipocytes (6.4%) and others (1.8%, contaminated epithelium and nerve).

Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 
Disclosures: Ellen Chapel: None; Lakshmi Kunju: None; Liron Pantanowitz: None; Jane Brock: None; David Chapel: None 
Background: Re-excision rates following standard breast-conserving surgery (BCS) are approximately 20%. Intraoperative 
consultation (IOC), including frozen section (FS), on breast lumpectomy margins reduces subsequent re-excision rates. However, 
the efficacy of this practice following implementation of the 2014/2016 SSO-ASTRO margin guidelines remains unreported, and this 
practice has not been compared to cavity shave margins. 
Design: We evaluated primary lumpectomy specimens sent for IOC between 2017 and 2022 from a single academic institution and 
compared concordance between IOC and final diagnosis. Surgical indications included invasive carcinoma, DCIS, and pleomorphic 
LCIS. Excisional biopsies and procedures with concurrent cavity shave margins were excluded from the IOC cohort. Subsequent 
re-excision rate for was compared to a cohort of lumpectomies with cavity shave margins from a separate academic institution 
during the same period (2017, 2019). 
Results: IOC was performed for 1193 (91.8%) of 1300 lumpectomies. Tissue was submitted for FS in 1087 (91.4%) IOC 
lumpectomies, with the remainder evaluated by gross-only examination. 3620 blocks were submitted for FS, ranging from 1-29 
blocks per case (including additional intraoperative margin re-excision specimens). FS and final diagnoses were concordant in 
1030 (94.8%) cases. Among 57 discordant cases, 12 (21%) were due to interpretive error and 45 (79%) were due to sampling 
discrepancies. Among lumpectomies evaluated by gross-only examination (n=130), 9.2% had positive final margins that were not 
identified at IOC. The discordance rate trended higher for gross-only examinations, compared to cases for which FS was performed 
(P=0.06). Subsequent re-excision was performed for 137 (11.5%) of 1193 IOC cases, including 119 (10.9%) with FS and 18 
(13.8%) with gross-only examination (P=0.33). There was no significant difference in re-excision rate from year to year. Among 386 
lumpectomies with cavity shave margins, 49 (12.7%) required subsequent re-excision. There was no significant difference in 
subsequent re-excision rates for IOC lumpectomies compared to those with cavity shave margins (P=0.52). 
Conclusions: IOC on breast lumpectomies results in subsequent re-excision rates that are comparable to cavity shave margins 
and lower than standard BCS. While gross-only examination is accurate in select cases, diagnostic concordance appears to be 
improved by FS.

Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy

China, 2Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China 
Disclosures: Honglei Chen: None; Sufang Tian: None 
Background: Breast cancer is an epithelial malignant tumor that occurs in the terminal ducts of the breast. Neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy (NACT) is an important part of breast cancer treatment. However, some patients who do not respond to NACT will 
lead deterioration in their condition. Therefore, prediction of NACT efficacy in breast cancer is vital for precision therapy. Sialic acid 
binding immunoglobulin like lectin 15 (Siglec-15) is an immunosuppressive factor equivalent to PD-L1 in the tumor 
microenvironment, which is a way of tumor immune escape. In this study, we aimed to explore whether Siglec-15 and related 
phenotypes can predict the NACT efficacy of breast cancer, combined with clinicopathological information and bioinformatics 
analysis. 
Design: In this study, TCGA, GEO, WGCNA, TIMER and other public databases were used to analyze the bioinformatics functions 
of Siglec-15 in Pan cancer and breast cancer. Simultaneously, 32 patients with breast cancer who were treated by NACT were 
collected and divided into disease progression (PD) group and pathological complete response (pCR) group. The expression of 
Siglec-15 and related immunophenotypes were examined by immunohistochemistry, multiplex immunofluorescence histochemistry 
(mIHC) and multispectral quantitative analysis system. The relationship between the therapeutic effect of NACT and other 
clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer was evaluated. 
Results: Bioinformatics analysis showed that Siglec-15 was up-regulated in breast cancer, which was related to stromal cells and 
immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (Fig.1). The expression of Siglec-15 in PD group was higher than that in pCR 
group before NACT (p< 0.05). High density of FoxP3 before treatment predicted a good response to NACT. mIHC confirmed that a 
novel immune phenotype of CD8 and FoxP3 co-expression in PD patients after NACT (Fig.2). Siglec-15 expression was also 
observed in the tumor-associated macrophages. The analysis of clinicopathological information showed that ER, PR, HER2, Ki-67 
and molecular typing before treatment affected the efficacy of NACT. High expression of ER and PR before treatment indicated 
poor efficacy; on the contrary, overexpression of HER2 and Ki-67 had good therapeutic effect.

Conclusions: Siglec-15 up-regulates in breast cancer and affects the tumor immune microenvironment. High expression of Siglec-
15 before NACT presaged poor efficacy. ER, PR, HER2, Ki-67 and molecular typing before NACT can predict the efficacy as well.

Background: Low HER2 expression, defined as immunohistochemical (IHC) score of 1+ or 2+, HER2 unamplified, is not 
considered as an indication for conventional anti-HER2 treatment in breast cancer.  With the recently FDA-approved antibody-drug 
conjugate, trastuzumab-deruxtecan, HER2-low has emerged as a predictive marker to guide targeted therapy in advanced breast 
cancer in clinical trials. However, there is high interobserver variation in evaluating HER2 IHC scores of 0 and 1+. Here, we 
explored the value of Oncotype DX in distinguishing between HER2 IHC 0 and HER2-low tumors.  
Design: We retrospectively reviewed 643 patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative and node-negative primary breast carcinomas 
with both HER2 IHC and Oncotype DX performed from 2010 to 2018. Medical records were reviewed for pathologic 
parameters and HER2 results by IHC and Oncotype DX. The correlation of HER2 results between the two assays was examined. 
Results: Of the 643 cases, the HER2 IHC scores were as follows: 307 IHC 0, 266 IHC 1+, and 70 IHC 2+. All 70 IHC 2+ cases 
were HER2 non-amplified. The tumors were predominately ductal (533, 83%), grade 2 (374, 58%), ER-positive (643, 100%) with 
strong intensity (542, 84%), PR-positive (526, 82%), and of low Ki67 index (<17%) (342/524, 65%). The HER2 scores by Oncotype 
DX demonstrated a range from 6.8-10.9 (median 8.8 and mean 8.7) in the IHC 0 group, from 7.6-11.1 (median 8.9 and mean 8.9) 
in the IHC 1+ group, and from 7.6-10.6 (median 9.3 and mean 9.2) in the IHC 2+ group. There was a trend toward higher median 
and mean HER2 scores by Oncotype DX with higher IHC scores in the 3 different IHC groups (p<0.05), However, the wide range of 
HER2 scores by Oncotype DX was observed.

Conclusions: Our results demonstrated a trend of higher HER2 scores by Oncotype DX corresponding to IHC scores. However, 
Oncotype DX was not effective in further segregating HER2 IHC 0 from HER2-low tumors.  Correlating with treatment response in 
large clinical trials is necessary to determine the best HER2 testing method to guide patient selection.

Background: Human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) is an important biomarker for breast cancer prognosis and therapy. 
Recently, a novel HER2 antibody drug conjugate (ADC), trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), demonstrates benefit in breast 
carcinomas with low HER2 expression (IHC 1+ or 2+ with negative fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)). Therefore, the accurate 
and reproducible detection of HER2 IHC 1+ and 2+ levels is very important to identify candidate patients eligible for HER2 ADC 
therapy. As digital pathology and digital image analysis software (DIA) are becoming increasingly prevalent, we examine the 
capabilities of automated DIA on discriminating HER2-low cases from HER2 0 cases. 
Design: A cohort of 376 cases consisting of HER2 IHC 0 (n=147), HER2-low (n=229; 1+: n=145; 2+/FISH negative: n=84) 
previously read by pathologists were re-read by Visiopharm DIA software. Representative images used for analysis are 
demonstrated in Figure 1 (Fig.1 A,B: one case with HER2 IHC 0. Fig.1 C,D: one case with HER2 IHC 1+. Fig.1 E,F: one case with 
HER2 IHC 2+). The DIA read for HER2-low (Fig.1 B,D,F) labeling was compared to pathologists’ read, and both DIA and 
pathologist scorings were compared to HER2 copy number and HER2/CEP17 ratio by FISH. 
Results: Eighty-nine percent of cases (334/376) were concordantly scored into either HER 0 or HER2-low category between 
pathologists and automated DIA, while eleven percent of cases (42/376) showed discordant scores (Table 1). By Cohen’s weighted 
kappa, there was a substantial agreement between pathologist and automated DIA scores (κ=0.638; 95% CI: 0.581-0.696). HER2-
low cases classified by pathologists had significantly higher mean HER2 copy number (3.22 vs 2.58, p=1.96E-12) 
and HER2/CEP17 ratio (1.26 vs 1.11, p=1.25E-08) compared to HER2 0 cases classified by pathologist. HER2-low cases 
classified by DIA also demonstrated significantly higher HER2 copy number (3.25 vs 2.57, p=3.59E-14) and HER2/CEP17 ratio 
(1.26 vs 1.11, p=7.89E-09) than HER2 0 cases classified by DIA with greater statistical significance.

Background: Spindle cell lesions of the breast elicit a specific, relatively limited differential diagnosis, and accurate classification 
requires careful morphologic distinction between low- and high-grade lesions and assessment of a panel of immunohistochemical 
stains. Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) is an uncommon malignancy with deceptively bland spindle cell morphology. 
Involvement of the breast is exceedingly rare. We examined the clinicopathologic and molecular characteristics of three cases of 
LGFMS involving the breast/axilla. In addition, we interrogated the immunoexpression of MUC4, a commonly used marker of 
LGFMS, in other breast spindle cell lesions. 
Design: Three cases of mammary/axillary LGFMS were reviewed and subject to immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) for FUS and EWSR1, and RNA-based next-generation (NGS) sequencing fusion testing. MUC4 
immunostaining was performed on 144 cases of various breast spindle cell lesions using whole sections or tissue microarray. 
Results: All LGFMS patients were female, with ages of 23, 33 and 59 years. Lesions were 1.1 to 3 cm in size. Two cases 
presented as palpable masses; one was incidentally noted on imaging. Microscopically, lesions were relatively well-circumscribed 
nodular masses of bland spindle cells with myxoid stroma. Immunohistochemically, all cases were diffusely positive for MUC4 and 
negative for keratin, CD34, desmin, S100 protein and nuclear beta-catenin. By comparison, MUC4 demonstrated only weak limited 
expression in a subset of cases of fibromatosis (10/20, ≤30%, 1-2+ staining), fibrous scar (5/9, ≤10%, 1+), spindle-cell metaplastic 
carcinoma (2/10, ≤5%, 1-2+), and phyllodes tumor (1/70, 10%, 1+). Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (n=9), 
myofibroblastoma (n=5), periductal stromal tumor (n=3), and cellular/juvenile fibroadenoma (n=18) cases were entirely negative. 
FISH for FUS rearrangement was positive in two LGFMS cases and follow-up NGS on one confirmed an FUS-CREB3L2 fusion. 
The third case was positive for EWSR1 breakapart FISH and harbored an EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion by NGS. Outcome data were 
available for two patients; neither developed recurrence or metastasis. 
Conclusions: LGFMS can rarely occur in the breast and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of breast spindle cell 
lesions, particularly those with myxoid stroma. Strong and diffuse MUC4 expression is highly specific for LGFMS in this 
context. Detection of an FUS or EWSR1 rearrangement can confirm the diagnosis.

Background: Ki-67 proliferation plays a role in prognosis and prediction of chemotherapy benefits and high and low values are 
helpful in the decision of oncology treatments in Sweden.  In Sweden, the new national guidelines recommend the use of a global 
counting by the International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working Group (IKWG). New cut-offs according to the data of IKWG were 
implemented in all pathology departments across Sweden (Global Score weighted score, Ki-67-low <6 %, Ki-67-medium 6-29 %, 
and Ki-67-high > 29 %)  
Design:  We used an algorithm from the AI-development company Mindpeak (Germany) to evaluate Ki-67 expression in invasive 
breast cancers on IHC stained whole slide images and compared the manual IHC scoring with the AI algorithm counting 
(Mindpeak).In a prospective study, 113 Ki-67-stained slides from breast cancer patients were analyzed, 102 from hospital Sankt 
Görans and 11 from Elskinstuna, using manual counting, and using AI algorithm for global counting including the following criteria: 
quality assurance in pre-analytical and analytical factors. The entire glass slide section was examined. The manual assessment 
 
  
 
S117 
was performed (counting 400 cells, 4 areas) of the percentages of the invasive tumor in the glass slide that exhibit the following Ki-
67 scores (excluding carcinoma in-situ and non-tumor tissue such as necrosis and fibrosis): Negative i.e. contains invasive cells but 
a very low (including zero), percentage of positive invasive cells with the following estimation: low, medium and high according to 
the protocol published by IKWG. The same methodology was chosen with the Mindpeak AI algorithm but here the software counted 
the cells automatically, did the mathematical calculations, and gave the Global Score weighted and Global Score unweighted as 
readout. 
Results: The quantification of Ki-67 expression on tumor cells with the AI software identified more Ki-67 positive samples at cut-
offs of ≥1% and ≥5% compared with manual scoring. Four additional patients were classified as low >5 % when more cells were 
considered by the AI software Figure 1. Similarly, two additional patients were recategorized into the medium range with 6%-29 %. 
In addition, the diagnostic time needed for quantification and calculation was 8 times shorter when using the AI software compared 
to the manual process as shown in figure 2. We found a correlation between manual counting and AI automatic counting.

Background: FANCA encodes for a pivotal component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway which is central to the DNA damage 
response. FANCA alterations are associated to FA, a rare syndrome characterized by defective DNA repair and increased cancer 
risk. Little is known about the role of FANCA in breast cancer (BC). Here, we sought to characterize the clinicopathologic and 
genomic features of BCs harboring FANCA alterations. 
Design: BCs with FANCA pathogenic alterations were identified among 8,477 BC patients, whose tumor and normal samples were 
previously subjected to targeted sequencing using an FDA-approved large multigene panel. We conducted the histologic review of 
 
  
 
S118 
cases following the criteria put forward by the World Health Organization. The extent of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was 
assessed following the recommendations by the International TILs Working Group. ER and HER2 status were retrieved from 
medical records. Mutational signatures were evaluated using SigMA in cases with at least 5 SNVs, 
Results: Our cohort included 61 BCs harboring pathogenic germline (n=17) or somatic (n=44) alterations targeting FANCA, 
including 24 primary (pBC) and 37 metastatic BCs (mBC). Bi-allelic FANCA inactivation was observed in most (75%; 46/61) cases, 
as homozygous deletions (n=25) or as loss-of-function mutations (n=15), intragenic deletions (n=4) or rearrangements (n=2) with 
loss-of heterozygosity of the wild-type allele (LOH). Most FANCA-altered pBCs and mBCs were invasive ductal carcinomas of no 
special type (IDC-NSTs; 83% and 95%), histologic grade 3/poorly differentiated (79% and 97%) and ER+ (67% and 81%) and 
displayed scarce TILs (median, 10% and 5%). Notably, most pBCs (70%) and mBCs (59%) lacked a homologous recombination 
deficiency (HRD) mutational signature, displaying dominant clock (50% and 18%) or APOBEC (20% and 41%) signatures, instead. 
Two FANCA-altered mBC, including an ER+/HER2- IDC-NST (FANCA E1420*) and an ER+/HER2+ IDC-NST 
(FANCA homozygous deletion), had a prior pBC sample subjected to targeted sequencing, which revealed wild-type FANCA. 
Conclusions: FANCA-altered BCs are predominantly ER+ tumors of high histologic grade and minimal TIL infiltration, and lack a 
dominant HRD mutational signature, a hallmark genomic feature of BCs with inactivated canonical HRD genes (e.g., BRCA1/2). 
The presence of somatic FANCA alterations restricted to metastases in a subset of paired cases suggest that they might represent 
late events in evolution or progression.

Disclosures: Elizabeth C. Conner: None; Beth Harrison: None; Veerle Bossuyt: None 
Background: Pure mucinous breast carcinoma usually has a good prognosis and often does not require chemotherapy. However, 
patients with breast carcinoma with mucinous differentiation (CMD) on initial core biopsy may be eligible for and receive 
neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST). There is little information about the characteristics of the patients with CMD receiving NST 
or about the posttreatment pathology findings in these patients. 
Design: We identified patients with breast carcinoma treated with NST with tumors showing mucinous differentiation before or after 
NST or mucin only (without residual invasive carcinoma cells) in the breast or the lymph nodes (LNs) from 2007 to 2022. We 
analysed patient characteristics, pre- and posttreatment pathology findings, and patient outcomes. We will identify additional 
patients from multiple institutions to evaluate the clinical significance of abundant mucin and mucin only in the breast and LNs. 
Results: We identified 21 CMD (including 1 pure mucinous carcinoma) treated with NST. In 6 patients, the pretreatment core 
biopsy did not show a mucinous carcinoma component. Nine tumors were grade 3. Eleven tumors were HR+HER2-. Nine tumors 
were HER2+. One was triple negative (TN). Fifteen patients were clinically considered LN positive (13 with a positive LN biopsy) at 
diagnosis. Pathologic complete response (pCR) with mucin only was seen in only 1 patient (grade 3, TN, no mucinous component 
in the pretreatment core biopsy, biopsy proven positive LN). The posttreatment breast specimen in 6 patients showed abundant 
mucin (figure 1) with very few residual tumor cells. Acellular mucin only was present in a posttreatment LN of 3 patients (figure 2). 
All but 2 patients are alive without distant or local recurrence (follow-up 1 to 13 years, median 3 years). One patient died of disease 
(3 years after diagnosis), she developed bone metastases 1 year after diagnosis, followed by liver and brain metastases. However, 
she had contralateral grade 2 invasive carcinoma, NOS with 12 positive LNs in the posttreatment specimen. One patient was lost to 
follow-up.

Conclusions: Patients with CMD treated with NST often present with high grade, HER2+, and LN+ disease. On occasion, a 
previously unknown mucinous carcinoma component is present in the posttreatment specimen. Large quantities of acellular mucin 
are often seen in the breast and LNs after treatment. Assessing the clinical implications of abundant mucin or mucin only in the 
breast and or LNs requires a multi-institutional study.

Background: HER2 evaluation by IHC and/or ISH is performed in all primary and metastatic breast cancer (BC) to select 
patients for anti-HER2 therapies. Recent data demonstrated that novel HER2-targeted compounds can induce a response in the 
subgroup named HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-), formerly categorized as HER2-negative. Our study aims to describe how we 
identify HER2-low cases during daily practice using current ASCO/CAP guidelines, and to characterize its clinicopathologic 
features. 
Design: Retrospective analysis of all primary BC diagnosed on core biopsy in our Institution, between May-2019 and November-
2020. IHC status of Hormone Receptors and HER2, as well as FISH test results were assessed. Additional clinicopathologic 
features were included.  
Results: A total of 877 cases of BC with HER2 evaluation were included and categorized as shown in Figure 1. Globally, HER2-
low was the most prevalent group (43,3%) with distinctive clinicopathologic features (Table 1). Cases with borderline expression of 
HER2, 1+/2+ (4,8%) and 2+/3+ (0,8%), had a more detailed reporting. These cases were re-tested on surgical specimen or sent to 
FISH. There were no reported cases with 0/1+ expression. As shown in Figure 2, re-testing IHC on surgical specimen allowed for a 
more accurate HER2 classification. Most borderline and indeterminate cases directly sent to FISH on core biopsy were negative. 
Indeterminate cases without amplification (96,2%) weren’t further characterized.

Conclusions: HER2-low concept is changing the traditional dichotomy of HER2 status. Although in the past wasn’t clinically 
relevant to distinguish between negative (0) and negative (1+), ASCO/CAP 2018 guidelines allow this distinction which is 
fundamental for the HER2-low group identification. In recent literature, cases with heterogeneous/borderline staining on core biopsy 
should be additionally tested by FISH or on surgical specimen. We believe the second option should be favored since it grants 
better evaluation of tumour heterogeneity and reduces the number of cases sent to FISH. Moreover, it allows further 
characterization of non-amplified indeterminate cases and hypothetical FISH-Group 3 cases with borderline 1+/2+ expression. 
Although our case series showed similar results compared to those reported in literature, existence of borderline cases and 
increasing awareness of HER2-low group as a therapeutic target might require better discrimination and detailed reporting for each 
level of HER2 expression. 
 
133  Histologic and Immunohistochemical Assessment of Early Stage, ER-Positive Breast Cancer 
Following Pre-Operative Endocrine Therapy

Disclosures: Michael Crawford: None; Max Meneveau: None; Trish Millard: None; Shayna Showalter: None; Kristen Atkins: None 
Background: Early-stage, estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer is traditionally treated breast conserving surgery (BCS) 
followed by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and 5-10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET). Long-term data from randomized 
controlled trials demonstrate that omission of RT in older women (≥65 years) with ER+, early-stage breast cancer who are treated 
with AET does not result in decreased survival. However, the majority of older women still received RT after BCS due to concerns 
about AET adherence. The POWER Trial (Pre-Operative Window of Endocrine Therapy to Inform Radiation Therapy Decisions; 
NCT 0427801) is an ongoing trial in which older women with early stage, ER+ breast cancer receive a 3-month course of pre-
operative endocrine therapy (pre-ET) prior to subsequent adjuvant therapy decisions. The current study is an examination of the 
preliminary morphologic and immunohistochemistry (IHC) data of the first 20 patients enrolled in the POWER trial. 
Design: For each participant, histologic and IHC evaluation was performed on the core biopsy and the lumpectomy specimen (after 
pre-ET).  Estimation of tumor response was performed using a modified MD Anderson residual cancer burden scoring system, that 
consisted of tumor burden (scoring ten consecutive high-powered fields (hpfs) and the percentage of tumor estimated and 
averaged), Ki67 (scored according to the International Ki67 Working Group using an unweighted global assessment of 100 cells in 
at least 4 hpfs to derive a mean Ki67 score from the two highest proliferation hpfs and 2 lowest proliferation hpfs) and ER 
expression (assessed on a continuous level, ranging from <1% to 100%). A paired T-test was used to assess the differences 
between the core biopsy and lumpectomy resection specimens. 
Results: Table 1 summarizes the histologic and IHC results. Two cases demonstrate a complete pathologic response with no 
residual tumor, while five cases show increased or unchanged tumor cellularity. The mean expression of ER showed a non-
significant decrease of 3.78% (P = 0.3894). The mean expression of Ki-67 showed a significant decrease of 10.19% (P = 0.0004), 
and the mean tumor burden showed a significant decrease of 11.45% (P = 0.0423).

134  MLPH (melanophilin), a Gene Involved with in Melanosome Transport and Skin Pigmentation 
Has Perhaps Unexpected Importance in Breast Cancer 
Leslie Dalton, Dalton Pathology, West Lake Hills, TX 
Disclosures: Leslie Dalton: None 
Background: Nottingham score 9 (NS9) tumors encompass the most aggressive breast cancers. In a phenotype/genotype 
correlation it was not expected a gene involved with melanosome transport (MLPH) would best describe NS9 cancers. 
Design: From TCGA cohort, and by examination of whole slide images, a Nottingham score was assigned to 773 cancers. With 
NS9 as label and mRNA expression of 16,864 genes as predictors, gradient boosting (R library xgboost) identified MLPH as best 
describing NS9 cancers. MLPH expression was also studied in the n= 3273 Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network (SCAN) patient 
cohort and n=1875 METABRIC cohort. 
Results: In predicting NS9, MLPH had higher variable importance than the sum of all other coefficients. In TCGA, and by receiver 
operator curve analysis, AUC = 0.85 of MLPH expression with NS9 as response variable. This compared to ESR1 
AUC=0.81.  Spearman correlation of MLPH and ESR1 corresponded to rho: SCAN = 0.64; 0.62 in METABRIC; 0.60 in TCGA. 
MLPH had minimal to moderate correlation with vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) with rho: SCAN= -0.171; TCGA= -0.176; BRIC= -
0.073. From examination of TCGA whole slide images, those tumors with concordant low ESR1 and MLPH expression often 
showed zonal necrosis and features typical of triple negative cancers (TNBC). Those cancers with low ESR1/high MLPH were 
often lobular cancers and tumors having complex glands with eosinophilic or overtly apocrine cytoplasm. In both SCAN and 
METABRIC, by plot inspection of MLPH expression with ESR1, three distinct clusters were evident corresponding to concordant 
high expression of ESR1 and MLPH; discordant low ESR1/high MLPH, and concordant low ESR1 & MLPH. In SCAN, 70% of those 
cancers in the low MLPH & low ESR1 were TNBC. In cluster of low ESR1/high MLPH; 25% were TNBC. 33% of low ESR1/high 
MLPH were HER2+, but only 1% in concordant low ESR1/MLPH. The low ESR1/high MLPH cluster trended toward intermediate 
survival probability but not statistically significant. 
Conclusions: Literature trails involving MLPH expression extend in many directions. Intriguingly, in skin, melansome transport is 
under the influence of Vitamin D (VD). In breast cancer a disproportionate number of patients with VD deficiency have TNBC. 
Documented here is MLPH expression (lack thereof) also shows disproportionate low expression in TNBC.  Perhaps level of MLPH 
expression can best provide a tissue based estimate of VD activity. The multiple roles of VD in cancer progression and prevention 
are increasingly becoming realized. 
 
135  Quantifying the Number of “Significant” Genes in Predicting Breast Cancer Survival: More 
Than You Might Think 
Leslie Dalton, Dalton Pathology, West Lake Hills, TX 
Disclosures: Leslie Dalton: None 
Background: From the n= 3247 Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network patient cohort (SCAN), mRNA expression of 7,465 genes 
showed p < 0.05 univariate significance in survival stratification (Cox Regression). This magnitude was surprising, if not 
astounding. Of interest, was to find the number of genes maintaining significance after, lowering p-values, multivariate analysis, 
and requiring significance in an independent patient cohort (n=1895 METABRIC). 
Design: Evaluated were 16,914 genes common to SCAN and METABRIC. In SCAN, each gene was individually examined in 
multivariate Cox regression. The covariates were lymph node status (lnodes), tumour size, patient age, and mRNA expression of 
MKI67 and ESR1. In both cohorts, all of the just mentioned covariates were independently significant with each other (all p < 
0.0005). While grade is important, cell-based biomarkers were limited to mRNA expression. A stepwise filtering approach counted 
number of genes remaining significant after increasing stringency. Those genes found significant in SCAN were then tested in 
METABRIC. Statistical analysis used functions and libraries from R. 
Results: After covariates were added, 2,722 genes showed p <0.05 in SCAN, and 950 of these were then significant in 
METABRIC. At a more stringent p-value < 0.005, SCAN had 688 significant genes and 126 remained after METABRIC as test set. 
At a very stringent p-value < 0.0005, 101 genes were significant in SCAN. Of these, only 10 genes showed significance in 
METABRIC. The 10 were: HLA-DOB, IL7R, PIM2, PNOC, SLC2A8, SLC6A1, STAT4, TAB3, TNFAIP8, TNFRSF17. After literature 
review, the prevalent theme of function for the ten genes was immune response (although not exclusively so). For example, PIM2 
is hypothesized to influence function of PD-L1 and has Spearman rho=0.58 (p<0.00001) with CD274. 
 
  
 
S123 
Conclusions: Building yet another gene signature was not intended. This was planned as an illustrative exercise. Findings can be 
interpreted from many perspectives. Among the suggested: 1) given number of genes significant at p<0.05, an essentially infinite 
number of gene signatures are possible to predict patient survival 2) given number of genes significant, the p <0.05 threshold is too 
lenient; 3) independent test sets are essential; 4) Ten genes were identified deserving of greater attention. 
 
136  Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia of the Breast: Morphologic Variables Have a Limited Value in 
Predicting Upgrade Rate in Subsequent Surgical Specimens

Background: Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) of the breast is an atypical epithelial proliferation with low-grade cytologic atypia. 
ADH either partially involves multiple lobules/ducts or completely involves lobules/ducts but not exceeding 2 mm in maximum linear 
dimension. Few studies have examined whether complete involvement of lobules/ducts by ADH is associated with upgrade to 
breast cancer.  
Design: This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with ADH in breast core needle biopsy (CNB) who underwent 
subsequent surgical excision between 2011 and 2018. Clinical data and microscopic slides were reviewed for the following 
variables: patient age, race, type of CNB, number of slides with ADH, number of atypical foci, extent of duct involvement (partial vs 
complete), size of each involved duct, nuclear grade, punctate necrosis, calcifications in ADH, lobular neoplasia, and background 
non-proliferative or proliferative lesions. Upgrade was defined as diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive 
carcinoma (any histologic type) in the surgical specimen. Statistical analysis included univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
models. 
Results: A total of 123 CNBs with ADH were identified during the study period, including 97 (79%) stereotactic CNBs for 
calcifications, 19 (15%) ultrasound-guided CNBs for mass lesions, and 7 (6%) magnetic resonance imaging guided CNBs for non-
mass enhancement. The median patient age was 55 years (31-82). Most patients (116, 94%) underwent excision, whereas 
mastectomy was performed in 7 (6%). The overall upgrade rate was 27% (33/123), with 23 cases diagnosed as DCIS and 10 as 
invasive carcinoma. Of the remaining cases, 41 (33%) had residual ADH, and 49 (40%) showed benign breast tissue. The 10 
invasive carcinomas included invasive ductal carcinoma (4 cases), tubular carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma (3 cases 
each). None of the morphologic features was significantly associated with upgrade rate, including the extent of lobule/duct 
involvement by ADH (p=0.19). In the multivariate model, only the number of atypical foci was associated with upgrade rate 
(p=0.03), and the median and mean numbers of atypical foci were 1 and 1.7, respectively (range 1-6). 
Conclusions: Morphologic features in breast CNBs have a limited value in predicting upgrade of ADH. The only feature associated 
with upgrade appears to be the number of ADH foci on CNB, whereas complete versus partial duct involvement is insignificant.

Background: Invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC) are characterized by a loss of E-cadherin expression and CDH1 gene 
inactivation.  
Design: We aimed to analyse the relationship between the type or position of CDH1 mutations, E-cadherin expression and the 
clinical outcome in a retrospective series of 250 ILC patients treated by primary surgery between 2005 and 2008. The mutational 
status of E-cadherin was determined by RNA sequencing from frozen tumor samples. E-cadherin immunohistochemistry (clone 
4A2C7 antibody) was performed on FFPE tumor blocks. Intensity (H-Score), localisation and distribution of staining (absent: 0%, 
focal 1-10%, heterogeneous 11-89%, or diffuse > 90% +ve cells respectively) were assessed. P120-catenin and beta-catenin 
expression were determined when E-cadherin was diffusely positive. The median follow-up was 106 months; 20 (8%) patients died 
of breast cancer. 
 
  
 
S124 
Results: E-cadherin protein was detected in 52.4% of the cases (131/250), with a low or intermediate (≤ 200) H-score (128/131; 
98%) and shown a focal (48%; 63/131), an heterogeneous (36.6%; 48/131), or a diffuse (15.26%; 20/131) pattern. Diffuse E-
cadherin +ve cases had significantly lower p120-catenin and β-catenin H-scores compared to E-cadherin (p < 0.05), a lower tumor 
cellularity (p=0.02) and a lower estrogen receptor H-score (p=0.024) than E-cadherin-negative ILC. The CDH1 gene mutation rate 
was 70.4% (176/250) and similar regardless of E-cadherin protein level of expression. Mutations were truncating, missense and in-
frame in 91%, 7.3% and 1.7% of cases, respectively. Mutations were in the extracellular, the propeptide/signal peptide, the 
intramembranous and the intracytoplasmic domains in 60.2%, 26.1%, 3.4% and 10.2% of the cases respectively. There was no 
significant correlation between E-cadherin protein expression and the location of mutations in the CDH1 gene. Diffuse E-cadherin 
staining was significantly associated with non-truncating mutations (p<0.001). In univariate analysis, truncating CDH1 mutations 
were significantly associated with a poor Breast Cancer Specific Survival (BCSS) (p=0.046), and a shorter Metastatic-Free Survival 
(MFS) (p=0.006). 
Conclusions: In this series, ILC with diffuse E-cadherin staining had similar rate of CDH1 mutations than other ILC but were 
enriched in non-truncating mutations, a decreased expression of ER and β & p120 catenins. In univariate analysis, the presence of 
a truncating mutation was significantly associated with poorer BCSS and MFS.

Background: Invasive lobular carcinomas (ILCs) of the breast are characterized by their distinctive dis-cohesive growth pattern, 
largely due to CDH1 genetic inactivation or promoter methylation. CDH1 encodes for E-cadherin, a key component of the epithelial 
cell-cell adhesion complex. A small but substantial subset of ILCs, however, lack alterations in this gene, despite displaying a bona 
fide lobular phenotype. Here we sought to define the basis of the lobular phenotype in ILCs lacking CDH1 genetic or epigenetic 
alterations. 
Design: ILCs lacking genetic alterations or promoter methylation of CDH1 were identified among 364 primary ILCs, previously 
subjected to clinical targeted massively parallel sequencing and/or to CDH1 promoter methylation assessment. Tumor and normal 
samples of four cases were subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) at a median of 71x (range 65x-73x) and 39x (range, 
37x-39x), respectively. The presence of mutations, copy number alterations and rearrangements affecting genes involved in cell-
cell adhesion was investigated. Confirmatory CDH1 promoter methylation assessment was conducted using a digital droplet PCR 
assay (ddPCR). Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) was assessed using HRDetect. 
Results: Four primary ILCs lacking genetic alterations in CDH1 were included in this study. None of the four cases 
displayed CDH1 promoter methylation by ddPCR. WGS analysis revealed a median number of mutations of 15,049 (range, 2,771-
47,139). In 3 of 4 cases, we identified inactivating genetic alterations in genes with key roles in cell-cell adhesion other than CDH1. 
One case harbored a truncating mutation in PCDHGB2, which encodes of a protocadherin that mediates cell-cell connections; a 
second case harbored a structural variant affecting CDH1; a third case had a truncating mutation in AXIN2 which regulates the 
stability of catenins and orchestrates cell adhesion. Notably, this AXIN2-altered case also harbored a loss of function mutation 
affecting BRCA2 and was predicted to be HR-deficient by HRDetect (score=0.99), while all other cases were predicted to be HR-
proficient. No genetic alterations in cell-cell adhesion genes were found in the fourth CDH1-wild type ILC studied. 
Conclusions: The lobular phenotype in ILCs lacking CDH1 mutations or promoter methylation might be driven by CDH1 structural 
rearrangements, or by the genetic inactivation of other genes playing key roles in epithelial cell-cell adhesion, such as AXIN2 or 
genes encoding for protocadherins.

Background: Adenomyoepitheliomas (AME) are rare biphasic neoplasms composed of both epithelial and myoepithelial cells. 
Estrogen receptor (ER) positive AME are more commonly associated with mutations in the PI3K pathway, while ER negative AME 
tend to harbor mutations in RAS/RAF pathway. Our study evaluates ER expression AME (including benign, atypical, and 
malignant) and next generation sequencing (NGS) hotspot panel testing on malignant AME. 
Design: The anatomic pathology databases CoPath PlusTM and EPIC Beaker were searched from 2000-2022 for all cases of 
AME. Cases were re-reviewed with consensus of diagnosis, grading, and histologic features. Immunohistochemical stain for 
ER was performed using the Ventana Medical System Benchmark Special Stainer. Hotspot panel NGS assay including primary 
analysis performed by MiSeq Real Time analysis (RTA). Sequence alignment and variant calls are performed by NextGENe® 
software, Softgenetics®. 
Results: 52 cases of AME from 41 patients were identified: 22 benign, 13 atypical, 2 malignant-in situ (MIS), and 13 malignant. 
See table 1 for histomorphologic findings. The majority of AME showed at least patchy ER expression (95% of benign, 83% of 
atypical, and 57% of malignant, see Figure 1). Of the malignant AME, 10 had a benign AME component in association with an in-
situ and/or invasive component. Carcinoma subtypes included: 3 ductal carcinoma in situ, 2 invasive ductal carcinomas, 1 invasive 
mucinous carcinoma, 2 adenoid cystic carcinomas, 3 salivary analogue type tumors, 1 metaplastic carcinoma, and 2 epithelial-
myoepithelial carcinomas (see Figure 2). Molecular hot spot panel testing on 12 of the malignant AME cases, including one case of 
MIS AME is actively ongoing.

Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) like anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) and anti-PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have shown to 
be effective therapies in various cancers. However, the benefits of using ICIs in TNBC still remain unclear and can largely be 
attributed to the vague diagnostic indications and subpar detection methods. The current gold standard for assessing if a patient 
will benefit from ICIs is conventional immunohistochemistry (IHC) for PD-L1. IHC is limited as it only detects a single marker and 
doesn’t convey the entire story of the TME. Here, we utilized multispectral immunofluorescence (mIF) to better characterize the 
TME and delineate which patients will respond best to ICI therapy. 
Design: mIF was performed on two tumor micro arrays made up of 480 core biopsies taken from TNBC patients. The mIF panel 
consisted of 8 biomarkers that comprised CD3, CD8, PD-1, PD-L1, CD33, CD163, OX40 and AE1AE3. Slides were imaged on the 
Vectra Imaging System and cores were segmented into tumor and stroma regions. A phenotyping algorithm was then applied to all 
cores based on the abundance of each biomarker. The association of each phenotype and overall survival (OS) were analyzed 
using k-means clustering for PD-1 and PD-L1.      
Results: Separation of patients into low, intermediate and high PD-L1 intensities revealed that high intensity on both tumor 
and immune cells is significantly associated with increased OS. Cluster 4 represents patients with the best overall survival and 
reveals a TME that is highly inflamed. Myeloid cells, macrophages and helper/cytotoxic T cells display high PD-L1 intensity. This 
cluster also has the highest level of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Cluster 3 has the second-best OS, however the TME is 
slightly different. Here there are relatively low amounts of TILs and PD-L1 intensity is highest in the stroma. Cluster 2 consists of 
patients with lower overall survival and no lymphocytes are seen in the tumor or stroma. Macrophages dominate the TME and have 
high expression of PD-L1, suggesting a possible benefit from ICIs. Cluster 1 has the worst OS and lowest PD-L1 expression. This 
TME is characterized by an abundance of macrophages with no PD-L1.

Conclusions: Determining which patients will benefit most from ICIs involves more than just looking at PD-L1 expression. Our mIF 
8-biomarker assay allows for the TME to be considered as well.  The greatest benefit may come to patients who have moderate 
PD-L1 expression, but an abundance of immunosuppressive cells. 
 
141   A Comparison of the Biological Profiles of HER2-Low, HER2-Amplified and HER2-Zero Breast 
Cancers

Disclosures: Gelareh Farshid: None; Malcolm Pradhan: None 
Background: DESTINY-Breast04, a phase 3, open label RCT, recently demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Trastuzumab 
deruxtecan (T-DXd), compared with chemotherapy of physician’s choice, in patients with HER2-Low unresectable or metastatic 
breast cancer. HER2-Low designation requires HER2 IHC 1+ or 2+ without amplification. HER2-Zero patients (IHC 0) were 
ineligible for this trial. Pathologists’ concordance for distinguishing between HER2 IHC 0 and 1+ cancers is suboptimal. We sought 
to determine if HER2-Low cancers have distinctive biological features, compared to HER2-Amplified and HER2-Zero cancers.    
Design: We performed statistical analysis of a consecutive series of breast cancers, evaluated in our laboratory during 2012-2017, 
when we routinely used both IHC and ISH for HER2 testing. 
Results: 1744 invasive breast cancers (1735F, 9M) were evaluated. Of IHC 3+ cancers, 18 were non- amplified and are excluded. 
The remaining 1726 cases comprised HER2-Amplified: 16.9%, HER2-Low: 55.5% and HER2-Zero: 27.6% cancers. Significant 
differences were found for age, grade, subtype, ER and PR expression, Ki67 score, HER2 copy number and CEP 17 copy number, 
in all pairwise subgroup comparisons (p<0.0001). The differences were greater between HER2-AMP and the other subgroups, but 
although smaller, remained statistically significant between HER2-Low and HER2-Zero cancers (Table). HER2-Zero cancers were 
significantly more likely to be triple negative (17.9%), compared to HER2-Low cancers (5.3%), less likely to express ER (79.8% 
versus 93.1% of HER2-Low cancers), with more grade 3 cancers and higher ki67 scores. Their HER2 copy number (1.95) was 
significantly lower than HER2-Low cancers (2.15), although these differences are presently not clinically meaningful.

Conclusions: In this large, consecutive series, we demonstrate significant biological differences between HER2-Amplified, HER2-
Low and HER2-Zero cancers. While some of the differences are too small to be clinically meaningful, HER2-Low cancers are 
certainly enriched for ER expression, while TNBC are over-represented among HER2-Zero cancers. 
 
  
 
S129 
Level 1 evidence supports the use of T-DXd for patients with HER2-Low cancers, but such evidence is presently lacking for HER2-
Zero cancers and pathologists can legitimately be requested to make this distinction in the interest of patient care. In the absence 
of established reference standards distinguishing IHC 0 from 1+ cancers, for borderline cases, the differences we have found may 
assist in more consistent case assignment.

Background: Histopathological grade is the gold standard for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment decision-making. 
The Nottingham grading system (NGS) is a well-established tool used to define the ‘aggressive potential’ for breast cancer (BC); 
however, a high percentage of patients are placed in an intermediate-risk group with indeterminate clinical value, highlighting the 
need for decision support tools to improve reproducibility and prognostic accuracy for histologic grade (HG) in clinical practice. 
Design: We developed an AI-digital BC grade and phenotyping assay (AI-grade, AG) to predict low vs. high risk of early-stage BC 
recurrence within 6 years. We conducted a retrospective development and validation study utilizing samples from BC patients with 
infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) in the Mount Sinai Health System. Participants were >23 years old, had H&E slides or paraffin 
blocks from the resected BC specimen and outcome data.  H&E slides were digitized (40X) using a Philips Ultra-Fast scanner. 
15,000 H&E slides and paired digital images were reviewed with a single WSI selected for model development.  AUC/CI and 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves with HR were used to compare AG vs. HG. 
Results: A total of 2075 eligible participants from 2004-2016 were subdivided (3:1) into training (Tr) (n=1559) and validation (Val) 
(n=516) cohorts. Samples were ER(+) (87%) and PR(+) (81%), with 13% Her2 amplified and 42% and 40% histologic grade 2 and 
3, respectively. There were 289 (14%) total recurrence events (220 in Tr; 69 in Val) including metastases (n=85), loco-regional and 
nodal extension (n=72), and overall survival (n=126). In training, 7 AG features had a CI 0.72 (95%CI, 0.70-0.74) vs. HG 0.62 (95% 
CI, 0.59-0.64) and a test AG CI of 0.68 (95%CI, 0.63-0.71) vs HG CI 0.61 (95%CI, 0.57-0.64).  KM curves comparing AG vs HG 
showed significant differences in both Tr (HR: 3.65, p-value <0.001) and Val models (HR: 2.1, p<0.001). Of the 868 Grade 2 cases 
in the total cohort (41% of 2075), 187 (22%) were reclassified as high-risk; 681 (78%) were reclassified as low risk by the AG 
model.  
Conclusions: By applying image analysis tools, we extracted tissue architecture features and cell type characteristics, generating 
a novel BC grading and phenotyping method. The assay was more predictive of early-stage BC recurrence than histologic grade, 
identifying discrete biologically driven tumor elements not captured using the current BC NGS.

Background: The Nottingham Grading System (NGS) is used for prognosis, for AJCC stage, and to guide therapy for invasive 
breast cancer (IBC). Glandular (acinar)/tubular formation (G/TF) is one component of NGS and requires a pathologist to identify 
 
  
 
S130 
and quantify G/TF structures.  In this multi-institutional study, we investigated the ability of pathologists to identify individual 
structures that should be classified as G/TF. 
Design: 58 unique H&E photographic images of IBC (NOS, mucinous, and micropapillary), with a single structure circled, were 
classified as showing G/TF (41 cases) or not showing G/TF (17 cases) by Dr. Ellis who helped develop the NGS. The images were 
sent in PowerPoint format to 35 breast pathologists who were provided with the WHO definition of tubule formation (“structures 
exhibiting clear central lumina surrounded by polarized neoplastic cells”) and told to follow established guidelines to determine if a 
circled structure represented a tubule.  If a structure was not considered a tubule, the participants could choose 6 possible reasons 
or write in a reason.  Questions about practice and difficulties in tubule evaluation were included. 
Results: Among the 35 pathologists who participated in the study the kappa statistic for overall agreement in evaluating the 58 
images was 0.324 (95% C.I. 0.314-0.335), a kappa value considered poor agreement.  The median (IQR) concordance rate 
between a participating pathologist and Dr. Ellis on evaluating the 17 non-tubule cases was 94.1% (88.2,100), but only 53.7% 
(34.2,85.4) for the 41 tubule cases. 41% of the tubule cases were classified correctly by <50% of the participants (Fig 1). Structures 
that resulted in frequent discordance with Dr Ellis as G/TF present but misclassification by pathologists as not being a tubule 
included complex and cribriform patterns (especially when mucinous) and the "inverted tubule" pattern of micropapillary carcinoma 
(cell clusters with reverse polarity and a central space) (Fig 2).  Eighty percent of participants reported they did not have clarity on 
what represented a tubule.  
Figure 1 - 143 
 
Figure 2 - 143 
 
Conclusions: This study identified individual types of structures that should be included as G/TF, but that were not readily 
identified as such, even by pathologists experienced in breast pathology.  Greater concordance for G/TF might be obtained by 
providing more detailed images and descriptions of the types of structures included in the NGS as G/TF. The study images can be 
used to illustrate difficult cases.

Background: Recent clinical trial evidence has demonstrated a benefit of novel anti-HER2 therapies in "HER2-low" breast cancer 
(BC), defined as BC with a score of 1+ on HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC), or 2+ HER2 IHC with negative HER2 in-situ 
hybridization. The validity of the core needle biopsy (CNB) for detecting HER2-positive BC has been well established; however, the 
accuracy of the CNB for detecting HER2-low disease has not been studied. 
Design: We identified 45 consecutive BC patients with HER2 IHC score 0 or HER2-low on CNB, with an available excision 
specimen, from the pathology database (2014-2015) at our institution. HER2 IHC was performed on the CNB and corresponding 
excision specimen by PATHWAY 4B5. All slides were reviewed individually by four subspecialty trained breast pathologists, and 
then separately by a collective group of subspecialty breast pathologists, all blinded to the original IHC interpretation diagnosis and 
each other’s scores. Discordance rates for detecting HER2-low disease between CNB and excision specimens were calculated 
based on the “majority opinion” of individual raters. Sensitivity of CNB vs excision for detecting HER2-low disease was compared 
using the McNemar test. Inter-rater reliability for CNB and excision specimens was calculated using Krippendorff’s alpha. All 
analyses were performed in R v4.1.1. 
Results: On CNB, 32/45 (71%) patients were interpreted as HER2 0, 11/45 (24%) were interpreted as HER2 1+, and 2/45 (4%) 
were interpreted as HER2 2+. On excision, 32/45 (71%) patients were interpreted as HER2 0, 9/45 (20%) were interpreted as 
HER2 1+, and 4/45 (9%) were interpreted as HER2 2+. Comparison of CNB and excision HER2 scoring is shown in Table 1. 
Discordance between CNB and excision HER2 scoring was seen in 11/45 (24%) patients. 5/32 (16%) patients with an 
interpretation of HER2 0 on the CNB had an interpretation of HER2-low on the excision specimen. 5/13 (38%) patients with an 
interpretation of HER2-low on the CNB had an interpretation of HER2 0 on the excision specimen.

Biopsy and excision HER2 IHC scores are reported based on “majority opinion” of individual raters. No significant difference was 
seen in the sensitivity of biopsy (72%) and excision (72%) specimens for detection of HER2-low disease (P>0.99). Inter-rater 
reliability was similar for both biopsy (α=0.794) and excision (α=0.792) specimens. 
Conclusions: When considering "HER2-low" status on CNB, our results demonstrate a potentially clinically significant subset of 
patients with discordant results between the CNB and excision specimen. Reasons for this likely include tumor volume and 
heterogeneity. As treatments for HER2-low disease are introduced into clinical practice, repeat testing on the excision specimen for 
patients that are HER2 0 or HER2 1+ on the CNB should be considered. Additional studies are warranted.

Background: Tumor heterogeneity is a crucial pathologic feature, which may lead to subtype discordance between primary breast 
carcinoma (PBC) and brain metastasis (BCBM). Such discordance is indicative of a biological phenotype/therapy changes and has 
been described in limited studies. We aim to examine clinicopathologic features of BCBM with subtype discordance that may help 
define molecular mechanisms of brain metastasis. 
Design: A retrospective query (7/6/2000~2/16/2021) identified 149 cases of PBC with subsequent BCBM. 89 BCBM cases had 
complete hormone and HER2 receptor data and were classified as HRonly (HR+/HER2-), triple negative (TNBC), and HER2pos 
 
  
 
S132 
(HER2+/any HR). Additionally, we subclassified HER2pos to triple positive (TPBC, HER2+/HR+) and HER2only (HER2+/HR-). We 
compiled clinicopathologic data including subtype discordance between PBC and BCBM, microsatellite instability (MSI), mismatch 
repair (MMR) protein status, NTRK and PD-L1 expression in BCBM, and overall survival (OS) analysis since BCBM diagnosis. 
Results: The median ages of PBC and BCBM diagnosis were 49.0 and 55.3 years respectively. The median time between BC and 
BCBM first diagnosis was 33.1 months. Most BCBM patients also had non-brain metastases (76.1%) and high nuclear grade 
(74.2%). Among BCBM, there were 36 (40.4%) HRonly, 31 (34.8%) HER2pos, and 22 (24.7%) TNBC. 56 (65.11%) cases showed 
receptor concordance between PBC and BCBM. PBC HRonly, TPBC, TNBC, and HER2only showed 65.9%, 47.4%, 77.8% and 
75.0% concordance, respectively (Fig.1). HER2pos patients showed lower age at time of BCBM diagnosis (54.8%<50y, p=0.035) 
and higher risk of LVI in BC (p=0.063). MMR deficiency was found in one BCBM HRpos case (n=21), but all 17 cases done for MSI 
were negative. Notably, 2 NTRK fusion positive cases were both TNBC. Two (20%) of TNBC showed PD-L1 positivity. The median 
follow-up time since BCBM diagnosis was 12 months (range 1~59.8 mos). Discordant breast receptor subtype cases showed 
significantly worse prognosis since brain metastasis when compared to concordant cases (p=0.004, Fig.2). HER2pos patients had 
the worst OS (p=0.05). Further subclassification showed similar OS between TPBC and TNBC, but better than 
HER2only (p=0.043).

Conclusions: Subtype discordance defines a poor prognosis phenotype that may aid in understanding the mechanisms of brain 
metastasis. TPBC group showed the lowest concordance rate with BCBM, which may be treatment related. HER2pos in brain 
metastases were the most aggressive tumor type in our cohort.

Background: Microglandular adenosis (MGA) is a rare benign yet infiltrative proliferation of small glands devoid of myoepithelium 
that morphologically mimics invasive carcinoma (IC). Molecular evidence has shown that MGA is a non-obligate precursor to triple-
negative IC. Although the molecular alterations of MGA-associated carcinoma (MGA-CA) have been investigated, data regarding 
their clinical behavior are lacking. 
Design: We searched the pathology database for patients with MGA, atypical MGA or MGA-CA diagnosed between 2000 to 2022. 
Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate patient survival. 
Results: A total of 115 patient were identified, including 42 with MGA, 8 with atypical MGA (AMGA), and 65 with MGA-CA. The 
clinicopathologic characteristic are summarized in Table 1. All MGA/AMGA were incidental findings in otherwise benign breast 
tissue or in specimens with separate focus of carcinoma. Among 65 patients with MGA-CA, 13 (20%) displayed carcinoma without 
definitive stromal invasion (MGA-CA in situ) and 52 (80%) had IC (MGA-CA IC). Of the 52 IC, approximately half were 
invasive carcinoma of no special type and the other half of a special histologic subtype, mostly matrix-producing metaplastic 
carcinoma (Table 1). Among 23 patients with MGA-CA who had BARCA germline testing, 13 (57%) had 
germline BRCA1/2 mutation (BRCA1=11, 2 BRCA2=2). Five of six (83%) MGA-CA with molecular analysis available displayed 
 
  
 
S134 
somatic mutation in TP53. Forty-three of 50 patients with MGA or AMGA who had follow-up information with a median follow-up 
time of 38 months (1-221 months) had no locoregional recurrence (LRR) or distant metastasis (DM). Follow-up information was 
available for 49/65 (in situ=7/13, IC=42/52) patients with MGA-CA with a median follow-up time of 35 months (1-198 months). 
There was no LRR or DM among patients with MGA-CA in situ, whereas 11 (26%) patients with MGA-CA IC developed DM, 5 of 
which with LRR and DM. Overall, the 5-year recurrence-free survival and 5-year overall survival was 68% and 81%, respectively.

Conclusions: This is the largest cohort examining MGA-CA with follow-up information. MGA-CA was found to be associated with a 
high prevalence of BRCA1/2 germline mutations and enriched for matrix-producing metaplastic carcinoma. Although in 
situ carcinoma associated with MGA is a controversial diagnosis, the outcome data in our cohort support the notion that MGA-CA 
without stromal invasion behaves like in situ carcinoma. 
 
147  Changing Clinicopathologic Features of Malignant Phyllodes Tumors in the Setting of the 
COVID-19 Pandemic: Size Matters

Background: Malignant phyllodes tumors of the breast are a rare subset of fibroepithelial carcinomas with a recurrence rate of 23-
30% per the World Health Organization. At our hospital, a tertiary care county center, there have been a number of malignant 
phyllodes cases with a high recurrence rate over the past few years. Additionally, in light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic with 
cancellation of elective procedures, patients have had delays in obtaining treatment and presented at advanced stages of disease. 
We present a case series of malignant phyllodes cases over the past five years at our hospital showing the clinicopathologic 
features in the setting of the Covid-19 pandemic.  
Design: A retrospective review of the malignant phyllodes tumors from 2018-2022 was conducted at our institution. Data, including 
age at diagnosis, tumor size, margin status, free margin distance, histologic features including stromal overgrowth, mitotic count, 
necrosis percentage, infiltrative or pushing borders, heterologous components, lymphovascular invasion, local recurrence, distant 
metastasis and overall survival were analyzed. 
 
  
 
S135 
Results: A total of 10 patients were identified as having malignant phyllodes tumors, 3 pre and 7 post-pandemic. The mean age at 
presentation was 53 years and the mean tumor size was 93 mm and 180 mm for pre- and post pandemic cases respectively. In all 
the cases, the surgical margins were negative with the closest margin most frequently being the deep margin, and average 
distance from the margin being 9 mm (range 1 -27 mm). Mitoses ranged from 15-40 mitoses per 10 high power fields and necrosis 
was present in 6 of 8 cases with an average of 29 %. 4 cases had malignant heterologous components; 2 were 
chondrosarcomatous, and 2 showed osteosarcomatous components. Local recurrence occurred in 4 cases at a mean interval of 29 
months. All cases with local recurrence also had distant metastases. The follow-up range was from 8- 60 months. 3 patients died of 
disease, all diagnosed after peak pandemic. The average interval from time of diagnosis to death was 12 months. 
Figure 1 - 147 
 
Figure 2 - 147 
 
Conclusions: We demonstrate that malignant phyllodes breast carcinoma can recur locally and with distant metastases in the 
absence of adequately negative margins. Patients presenting after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic had larger tumors and 
poorer outcomes overall. This case series highlights the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on delaying patient care and 
overall survival. 
 
148  Radial Sclerosing Lesions (RSLs) found on Core Needle Biopsy (CNB): Can Surgery Be 
Avoided?

Disclosures: Anne Grabenstetter: None; Sandra Brennan: None; Timothy D'Alfonso: None; Lee Tan: None 
Background: RSLs are benign breast lesions composed of glandular and epithelial proliferations radially arrayed around a fibro-
elastotic center, which mimic invasive carcinoma (IC) on imaging. Surgical management following a CNB diagnosis of RSL remains 
controversial with no standard guidelines as to whether excision (EXC) is necessary. This study evaluated the upgrade rate of 
RSLs. 
Design: We retrospectively identified CNBs with RSL between 1/2015-1/2021. All CNB slides were reviewed to confirm the 
diagnosis. Cases were excluded if there was a co-existing lesion warranting EXC or if the patient had concurrent ipsilateral 
carcinoma without separate EXC for RSL. Imaging was reviewed by a dedicated breast radiologist to categorize each RSL as 
either the “target” lesion of the CNB or an “incidental” finding and determine radiologic-pathologic concordance. An upgrade was 
defined as IC or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the EXC. The EXC slides of upgraded cases were reviewed. 
Results: The final cohort consisted of 134 CNBs from 128 women (median age 52 years, range 27-76) that had EXC. Fifty-five 
(43%) patients had prior/concurrent history of carcinoma. The imaging modality was mammogram in 53 (40%) cases, MRI in 52 
(39%) and ultrasound in 29 (21%). Most (109, 81%) CNBs were vacuum-assisted and 25 (19%) ultrasound-guided CNBs were not. 
The median size on imaging was 9 mm (range 2-41). The target was deemed by imaging to be completely removed by the CNB in 
25 (19%) cases. The RSL was categorized as the target in 99 (74%) cases and incidental in 35 (26%). In 4 CNBs the pathology 
was assessed as being discordant with the imaging findings. Overall, 4 (3%) cases were upgraded at EXC (Table 1). Two of the 
RSLs upgraded on EXC were discordant with imaging, resulting in an upgrade rate of 1% (2/130) among cases with radiologic-
pathologic concordance (Figs. 1, 2). Foci of IC/DCIS found in the EXC of upgraded cases were not closely associated with the RSL 
biopsy site. In cases without upgrade, 7 EXCs yielded atypical ductal hyperplasia. For 25 patients that did not undergo EXC of the 
RSL imaging follow up data was available and none developed carcinoma over a median of 31 months (range 9-74).

Conclusions: In this study, the upgrade rate of radiologic-pathologic concordant CNBs with RSL was 1%. Both upgrades are 
incidental, minute ICs not associated with the biopsy site. With careful radiologic and pathologic correlation, the upgrade rate of 
RSLs without atypia is very low and EXC can be safely avoided.

Individuals

Background: Numbers of gender affirming mastectomies have significantly increased within the last seven years as their access 
has increased. Population based statistics demonstrate that a higher percentage of Black individuals identify as transgendered and 
non-binary compared to White counterparts. Although Black individuals constitute 13.6% of the United States Census, young Black 
natal women have higher rates of aggressive, late stage breast cancers. However, to our knowledge, no study has specifically 
evaluated the rates of atypia in gender affirming mastectomies from Black transgendered individuals. 
Design: A retrospective chart review was performed between January 1, 2000 and July 12, 2022 to chronologically curate a list of 
bilateral gender affirming mastectomies. Clinicopathologic data collected included patient age, family medical history, use and 
duration of gender affirming androgen-derived hormones, specimen weight, histopathological findings, and the total number of 
slides examined. GraphPad was utilized to calculate both Fisher’s exact and t-tests. 
Results: Gender affirming mastectomies were received from 151 patients, 21.8% (n=33) of which were from Black individuals. Two 
(6.1%) mastectomies from Black individuals contained atypical findings, consisting of atypical ductal hyperplasia in one and 
invasive and in situ ductal carcinoma in the other, with a carcinoma rate of 3.0%. In contrast, atypia was seen in 1 (0.85%) 
mastectomy from non-Black individuals [p=0.12], with no cases of carcinoma. Black individuals had a higher rate of breast cancer 
in a female relative (39%) and increased incidence of fibrocystic changes (42%) compared to non-Black individuals (30% and 34%, 
respectively). Black and non-Black individuals had similar rates of androgen therapy use (100% vs 93%), duration from initiating 
androgen therapy to surgery (2.1 vs 2.2 years), average specimen weight (1162 vs 1088g), number of slides submitted (11.9 vs 
12.5), and average duration of follow-up (7.5 vs 8 days). 
Conclusions: Black transgendered non-binary individuals had higher rates of atypia and carcinoma in gender affirming 
mastectomies than non-Black individuals. However, both groups had otherwise similar clinical parameters including management. 
Although the findings in this exploratory study were not statistically significant, they may be clinically noteworthy.  Larger studies 
are warranted to evaluate whether increased breast cancer screening should be considered in this unique population.

Background: HER2 is a standard and critical biomarker in the staging, diagnosis, and management of breast cancer. Proper 
classification of HER2 in stained tissue sections is critical to precision pathology and personalized medicine for patients. Borderline 
cases require additional timely and costly tests, including reflex and ISH testing. Visiopharm’s HER2Connect algorithm has a 
proven track-record of assisting pathologists by expediting review time during staging and reducing the number of borderline cases 
which are IHC positive, ISH negative. In this study, we show that the HER2Connect can be activated following manual sign-out as 
a checkpoint to mitigate risk on challenging cases by flagging non-concordant reads during this AI-based quality assurance step at 
the Center of Integrated Diagnosis (CID). 
Design: 58 random patient samples were stained for HER2 IHC at one of 5 hospitals according to their standard staining methods. 
Samples were assessed by both IHC and FISH. Samples were digitized by a Motic Scanner at the MGH CID then tumor areas 
were analyzed by HER2Connect.Tumor areas were identified by either a Fully Automated workflow where the tumor 
was demarcated by AI prior to HER2Connect analysis; and a Semi-automated workflow where selection areas were guided by 
pathologist inking prior to imaging. Scores from both methods were then compared to manual pathology IHC and FISH 
interpretations.

Negative Impact: Discordant IHC, Deleterious Impact on Treatment Strategy (Major discordance) 
Conclusions: Both approaches yielded results which validated the HER2Connect for use in routine workflows.19 (fully) and 22 
(semi-automated) cases were appropriately reassigned by AI. The AI was not influenced by site specific clones and staining. 
Discordant cases demonstrate real examples of cases that would be flagged for re-examination by a pathologist. The AI also 
served as a QC checkpoint by confirming IHC(-) status on cases which displayed abnormal FISH. Alerting the laboratory of the 
inconsistency allows the pathologist to revisit samples for confirmation. The detection of excision and staining artifacts caused the 
major discordance cases and would easily be identified by an observer, confirming the power of AI paired with pathologist yields 
the highest level of precision medicine. Adding these artifacts in the AI training should negate all major discordant 
cases. HER2Connect can be validated and implemented within 2 days for QC and risk mitigation. Minimally positive specimens 
may qualify for new HER2-low treatment strategies and different from traditional HER2-therapy.

Background: Dillon et al. found that the frequency of compromised margins after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) increases with 
the proportion of ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) in needle core biopsy (NCB) specimens (Mod Pathol 2007:21;39-45). This is an 
attractive metric for risk stratification of BCS candidates; studies use estimated quantities. Our goal was to use a whole slide 
imaging platform for digital quantification of NCB DCIS and retrospectively analyze an association with BCS margin status.  
Design: After institutional review board approval we retrieved BCS cases with DCIS alone or DCIS and admixed invasive ductal 
carcinoma (IDC) in the NCB treated at our institution from 2011-2021 (Table 1). We identified 180 cases and reviewed their clinical, 
radiologic, and pathologic data. We performed digital scans of a single slide in each case with the highest absolute quantity of 
DCIS. With whole slide imaging software we measured and outlined the areas of stroma, adipose tissue, DCIS, and invasive 
carcinoma (Figure 1). Positive margins were defined based on the 2019 American College of Breast Surgeons Consensus 
Guidelines on Lumpectomy Margins. Chi-square test was performed on categorical variables and either logistical regression or 
analysis of variance on continuous variables. P-value < .05 was considered statistically significant.       
Results: Eighty-two cases were identified with positive margins and 97 cases with clear margins. By logistic regression of all cases 
an increasing percentage of DCIS was associated with a progressively higher probability of positive margins (Figure 2, P 
< .001). One positive case of extensive DCIS alone was excluded as an outlier. Additionally, a lumpectomy diagnosis of DCIS 
admixed with invasive ductal carcinoma was associated with an increase in positive margins compared to cases with DCIS alone 
(P < .001). Alternatively, in cases of NCB DCIS alone a mean of 9.5% DCIS (95% CI 6.4 to 12.51, P = .0149) was associated with 
the presence of IDC in the lumpectomy specimen. This is compared to cases of DCIS alone with a mean of 5.33% DCIS (95% CI 
4.0 to 6.7, P = .0149).

Conclusions: The selection of patients for BCS currently relies on imprecise criteria. The percentage of DCIS in 
a NCB predicts margin status at lumpectomy and the possibility of an unbiopsied IDC - % DCIS should appear in 
pathologic reporting.  This combined with the clinical, radiologic, and pathologic presentation can provide an improved risk-
stratification for patients considering BCS.

Background: Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) are a heterogenous group of carcinomas with variable prognoses and limited 
treatment options. Though molecular profiling has allowed for better prognostication of TNBC, these techniques are not widely 
available for clinical use. We sought to determine the prognostic significance of several biomarkers by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
in TNBC. 
Design: TNBC cases diagnosed at our institution from 2009-2020 were retrieved through retrospective database review. Cases 
without adequate tumour including pathologic complete response and low cellularity post-neoadjuvant therapy were excluded. A 
total of 302 cases were identified. Tissue microarrays were immunostained and scored as follows: keratin 5 (K5) and androgen 
receptor (AR) (positive if >10% of tumour staining); CAIX and vimentin (positive if at least moderate staining in >50% or strong 
staining in >25% of tumour); RB1 (retained or lost); p16 (overexpressed or wildtype); p53 (mutant or wildtype); Ki67 (<20% or 
>/=20%). Univariate and multivariate cox proportional-hazards regression methods were used to evaluate the impacts of 
clinicopathologic and IHC parameters on locoregional (LR) and distant recurrence (DR) and overall survival (OS). For statistical 
analysis, patients who died of disease or were transitioned to palliative care were combined to reach a composite endpoint. 
Results: Of 253 patients with follow-up data, 184 had no evidence of disease with a mean follow-up time of 61.8 months (+/- 54.7), 
13 were alive with disease, 22 died of disease, and 34 were transitioned to palliative care. LR and DR occurred in 28 and 76 cases. 
On univariate survival analyses (Table 1), T stage (P<0.001), N stage (P=0.019), and use of chemotherapy (P<0.001) were 
significantly associated with LR; T stage (P<0.001), N stage (P<0.001), overall stage (P<0.001) and CAIX expression (P<0.001) 
were significantly associated with DM; and grade (P=0.028), T stage (P<0.001), N stage (P<0.001), overall stage (P<0.001) and 
CAIX expression (P=0.003) were associated with OS (Figure 1). On multivariate analysis, overall stage (HR CI P<0.001) and CAIX 
expression (HR CI P=0.011) were independent predictors of DM; only overall stage (HR CI P<0.001) was an independent predictor 
of OS. 
 
 
 
  
 
S141 
Figure 1 - 152 
 
Conclusions: Expression of the transmembrane protein CAIX, known to be upregulated in hypoxia, is associated with disease 
progression in TNBC. This marker may be used as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target for TNBC.

Background: IHC4 score may be used to guide treatment decision in invasive breast cancer (BC), provided that the score has 
been validated beforehand in the laboratory, and if multigene prognostic assays are not available. The derived IHC4+C is a 
prognostic algorithm combining IHC4 (based on ER, PR, HER2, Ki67 immunohistochemistry) and clinical parameters (lymph node 
status, tumor size, histological grade, age, type of endocrine therapy). Despite low cost and wide availability, the use of IHC4+C 
remains limited, mainly due to lack of validation of IHC4 in decentralized “real life” conditions. Our study aimed at evaluating: (i) the 
IHC4+C score concordance between local and central technique, (ii) the inter-observer reproducibility between both techniques, 
and (iii) the concordance between IHC4+C and EndoPredict (EP) multigene prognostic assay. 
Design: This retrospective study included 155 patients selected from the National EndoPredict database, with a balanced 
repartition between low and high EPclin scores (48.5% and 51.5% respectively). Participating laboratories (n=6) provided for each 
of their case: 1 HE and 4 local IHC slides (ER, PR, HER2, Ki67), and unstained slides for central testing. All slides were digitized. 
After a training session, 7 pathologists were asked to score ER (H-score), PR (% stained cells), HER2 (positive vs negative) and 
Ki67 (% stained cells). Two pathologists scored the whole local and central series, and 5 pathologists scored 30 selected cases, 
both locally and centrally stained. The equivalence between local and central technique was defined as a ≥90% concordance rate. 
Results: Comparison of risk category obtained by IHC4 +C on local IHC for 155 cases scored by 2 pathologists showed an 
agreement for 145 (93.5%) patients (κ=0.76). The 10 discordant cases presented with a 10-yr risk of recurrence near the 10% cut 
off (-3.8% to +2.5%). Preliminary results for 3 out of 5 pathologists on the 30 selected cases showed a 90% inter-observer 
concordance rate on central IHC technique, vs 93% concordance rate on the local technique. For the 5 discordant cases, the 
maximum 10-yr risk deviation between observers ranged from 0.9 to 3.1%. Full concordance analysis between IHC4+C 
local/central scores and EPclin scores is still ongoing and will be presented.

Conclusions: Preliminary inter-observer analysis showed a good concordance (≥90%) for IHC4+C scoring on local and central 
IHC, supporting its technical validity for a real-life use.

Disclosures: Jiankun He: None; Hongbo Liu: None; Yueping Liu: None 
Background: The antigen immune reaction in paraffin sections will change with time, and the storage time of paraffin sections will 
affect the results of immunohistochemistry. With the emergence of new therapeutic drugs ADCs, accurate detection of HER2 low 
affects the prognosis of these patients. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the expression of HER2 in breast cancer paraffin 
sections with different storage times. 
Design: A total of 240 invasive breast cancer cases were selected. 128 cases were paraffin sections of surgical specimens. There 
were 47 paraffin sections with initial status of HER2 1+ and 40 cases of HER2 2+ and 41 cases of HER2 3+. To simulate the study 
of biopsy tissue, the 112 cases were fabricated as tissue microarray sections with a diameter of 2 mm. There were 31 paraffin 
sections with initial status of HER2 1+ and 46 cases of HER2 2+ and 35 cases of HER2 3+. All cases were serially sectioned. 
HER2 staining was performed at weekly intervals. A total of 8 weeks of HER2 staining was performed. 
Results: For paraffin sections of surgical specimens, HER2 expression in sections stored for 1 week and 2 weeks was highly 
consistent with that in fresh sections (Kappa ≥ 0.800). The HER2 expression in the slices stored for 3 weeks to 7 weeks was 
consistent with that in fresh slices (Kappa ≥ 0.600). For tissue microarray sections simulating needle biopsy tissue, HER2 
expression in sections stored for 1 week was highly consistent with that in fresh sections (Kappa= 0.815). The HER2 expression in 
the slices stored for 2 weeks to 3 weeks was consistent with that in fresh slices (Kappa ≥ 0.600). The HER2 expression in the 
slices stored for 4 weeks to 5 weeks was moderately consistent with that in fresh slices (Kappa ≥ 0.400). With the increase of 
storage time of paraffin sections, the expression level of HER2 gradually decreased. HER2 expression in tissue microarray 
sections decreased faster with time than in paraffin sections of surgical specimens. Sections with HER2 expression of 2+ had the 
highest rate of change, followed by 1+. Sections with HER2 3+ had the most stable HER2 expression levels. All cases were divided 
into HER2 low and HER2 positive. The decline in patients with HER2 low was higher than that in HER2-positive patients. 
Figure 1 - 154 
 
 
  
 
S143 
Figure 2 - 154 
 
Conclusions: Long-term storage of paraffin sections can lead to decreased HER2 expression levels, especially in patients with 
HER2 low. Compared with surgical specimens, the HER2 expression level decreased more in biopsy tissue.

Background: The basic treatment of hormone-receptor(HR) positive breast carcinoma(BC) is anti-hormonal therapy. 
Recently, cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 inhibitor called abemaciclib, has been approved for high risk patients after surgery, together 
with Ki-67 IHC MIB-1 pharmDx(Dako Omnis) for the patient selection. However, there remains concerns about reproducibility, and 
a development of automated image analysis is desired. 
Design: Random 100 cases were collected from a previous study [Histopathology. 2020;77(3):471-480]. Resected specimen of 
primary breast invasive carcinoma(HR positive and HER2 negative) had been stained with Ki-67(MIB-1; Dako, Autostainer Link 
48; Agilent), and digitized by NanoZoomer-XR(Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.). Two board-certified pathologists evaluated Ki-67 
following the recommendations from the International Working Group. We also performed original scoring using a 
deep learning(DL)-based Ki-67(Breast, AI APP, research use only; Visiopharm) in a fully automated approach with no manual input 
or review. We compared the continuous output score with Spearman’s correlation analysis, and calculated agreement with the 
clinically relevant cut-off of 20% for treatment with adjuvant abemaciclib. 
Results: Median/mean value of each pathologist and automated analysis were 11.7/15.1(AIH, Path 1), 8.4/12.0(TW, Path 2) and 
6.5/9.4 respectively. Every pair showed statistically positive correlations of Ki-67(Figure 1-2), and the highest value was yielded by 
Path 1 and the software(R2=0.9112). Time needed for pathologist to evaluate 100 cases ranged from 328(Path 2) to 562 
minutes(Path 1). The software counted 385,985 cells on average within the full-face slides. When we set the threshold of Ki-67 at 
20% by pathologist 1 and calculated 13% by software, the sensitivity and specificity of our new algorithm 
is 88.9% and 97.6% respectively.

Conclusions: Here, we have created a fully automated software to analyze Ki-67, which includes DL-based algorithm to detect 
invasive BC nest and count a large amount of cells quickly. It has probed to have concordant result with experienced breast 
pathologists, although the prognostic value needs to be confirmed. As the software tend to have lower value than pathologists, we 
have to pay attention to the cut-off value. However, fully automated analysis can be performed by a technician or an engineer, and 
allow pathologists to focus on another task. This objective method would help clinicians and patients to select the optimal treatment 
based on the tumor biology.

Background: Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare fibroblastic tumor with malignant potential that is underpinned by a recurrent 
inv12(q13q13)-derived NAB2-STAT6 fusion. Breast and axilla are exceptionally uncommon locations for this entity, with 
approximately 50 such cases reported in the literature. A SFT risk stratification model has been developed, and studies 
suggest NAB2-STAT6 fusion variants correlate significantly with anatomic site and clinical behavior. However, such studies include 
limited examples from breast and axilla. Herein we describe clinical, pathologic, and molecular features of SFT in these sites. 
Design: Surgical pathology records of 2 large academic centers were electronically searched for 'SFT' and 'hemangiopericytoma' 
from 1989-2022. Clinical information, pathologic diagnoses, immunohistochemical (IHC) profile, next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
fusion panel results, treatment, and outcome data, if available, were reviewed. SFTs were classified according to the risk 
stratification model from Demicco et al.1 
Reference: Demicco EG et al. Mod Pathol 2017;30:1433-42. 
Results: Clinicopathologic parameters of 5 patients with SFT are shown in Table 1. All patients were women, and median age at 
time of diagnosis was 57 years (range,21-74 years). Patients presented with either palpable mass (4 cases) or radiographic 
abnormalities (1 case). Surgical procedures were excisional biopsies in all cases. Diagnosis of 'SFT' was rendered in 4 cases, 
and 'malignant SFT' in 2 cases. Using the risk stratification model, 3 cases were scored as 'low risk,' 2 as 'intermediate risk,' and 1 
as 'high risk;' the latter case recurred. IHC stains were supportive of SFT, where performed (Figure 1). NGS was attempted in 4 
cases; quality was sufficient in 3 cases and confirmed all to harbor the characteristic NAB2-STAT6 fusion with different variants 
(Table 1). Clinical follow-up was available for 4 patients (median,58 months;range,10-163 months). All patients were surgically 
managed. Three patients showed no evidence of disease; however, 1 patient developed local recurrence 4 months after initial 
procedure and underwent extensive resection.

Background: A new therapeutically relevant category of breast carcinoma, HER2-low, defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
HER2 score of 1+ or 2+ with no high-level HER2 amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)/chromogenic ISH (i.e., 
FISH negative) using the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology and the College of American Pathologists testing 
guidelines has shown response to the anti-HER2 drug, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd). Given that up to 60% of breast 
carcinomas can be HER2-low, there is a need for rigorous evaluation of this category. These goals can 
include recategorizing/reevaluating our testing methods and reporting cutoffs in cases with lower HER2 expression. HER2 gene 
amplification (copy number and/or HER2/CEP17 ratio) has been known to be well-correlated to HRE2 protein expression, when 
HER2 IHC 0 and 3+, and lowest for cases with HER2 IHC 1+ and 2+. Using a large historical series, we characterize HER2-low 
category and reassess the correlations of HER2 copy number and/or HER2/CEP17 ratio in the breast carcinomas with low HER2 
protein expression as a first step in developing reliable criteria for HER2-low scoring criteria. 
Design: We have collected IHC and FISH data from 1309 invasive breast carcinoma biopsy cases diagnosed from 2018 to 2021 
comprising 465 HER2 0, 844 HER2-low cases. Clinicopathological features (including estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone 
receptor (PR) status), the HER2 copy number and HER2/CEP17 ratio were compared between HER2 0 and HER2-low groups. 
Results: There were no significant differences in age distribution or tumor subtypes between HER2 0 and HER2-low groups. The 
HER2 0 group was significantly associated with higher Nottingham grade (grade 3), more ER-negative, PR-negative and triple 
negative breast carcinomas than the HER2-low group. There were significant increases in the average copy number of 
the HER2 gene and HER2/CEP17 ratio in HER2-low group when compared to HER2 0 group (Table 1).

Conclusions: Breast carcinoma with HER2-low group has fewer triple-negative, ER-negative and PR-negative cases than those 
with HER2 0 group. There is significantly increased HER2 copy number and HER2/CEP17 ratios in the HER2-low group providing 
support for reliable discrimination of HER2-Low cases using existing immunohistochemical methods. Large studies correlating 
pattern of HER2-low expression with response to T-DXd may be useful in further refining scoring criteria.

Background: Recently, the Food and Drug Administration approved fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-DXd, Enhertu, Daiichi 
Sankyo, Inc.) for patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-low breast carcinoma (i.e., immunohistochemical (IHC) HER2 
score of 1+ or 2+ with no high-level HER2 amplification by in situ hybridization using the 2018 American Society of Clinical 
Oncology and the College of American Pathologists testing guidelines) who have received prior chemotherapy in the metastatic 
setting or developed disease recurrence.  Given that up to 60% of breast carcinomas can be HER2-low, characterization of this 
newly proposed HER2-low category becomes very important. The goal of our study is to evaluate the clinicopathological features, 
Oncotype DX recurrence scores and HER2 RNA expression scores in HER2-low, estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), early-stage 
breast carcinomas. 
Design: A total of 438 ER+ with HER2-negative scores early-stage breast carcinomas with available Oncotype DX results were 
included. The cases were subdivided into two subgroups: HER2 0/ER+ and HER2-low/ER+. Clinicopathologic features, 
ER/progesterone receptor (PR) qualitative and semi-quantitative results, Oncotype DX recurrence scores, and HER2 RNA 
expression scores were compared between the two groups. 
Results: HER2-low/ER+ cases showed significantly lower Nottingham grades (p=0.04), higher ER+ percentages (p=0.02), and 
more PR-positive cases than HER2 0/ER+ cases (p=0.04), with no significant differences in age distribution, histologic type, tumor 
size, lymph node metastasis or American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage. The average Oncotype DX recurrence score 
was significantly lower in HER2-low/ER+ group than in the HER2 0/ER+ group (17.3 vs 19.6, p=0.0332). HER2 RNA expression 
score was significantly higher in HER2-low/ER+ group than in the HER2 0/ER+ group (9.2 vs 8.6, p<0.0001) (Table 1).

Conclusions: IHC evaluation in HER2-low/ER+ versus HER2 0/ER+ breast carcinomas correlates with the HER2 RNA expression 
score by Oncotype DX. Given its association with lower Nottingham grade and lower Oncotype DX recurrence score, HER2-
low/ER+ early-stage breast carcinoma could represent a less-aggressive variant. 
 
159  Effect of Activating Cancer-associated Fibroblasts Biomarker TNC on Immune Cell Infiltration 
and Prognosis in Breast Cancer

Background: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are critical components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and definitely 
involved in tumor initiation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. CAFs usually display a distinctly activated phenotype. It has 
been reported that CAFs-expressing biomarkers may contribute to remodeling the TME and serve as prognostic factors for 
predicting clinical outcomes in patients with various solid cancers. However, the predictive value of CAFs-expressing biomarkers 
such as Tenascin-C (TNC) in breast cancer is incompletely elucidated. This study sought to determine the correlation of CAFs-
expressing biomarkers with the immune cell infiltration and survival of patients with breast cancer (BC). 
Design: The RNA-sequencing data and survival information for breast cancer patients were downloaded from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) in R software. The clusterProfiler package was used for GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, the ssGSEA 
algorithm was used to analyze the correlation between platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA), platelet-derived 
growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRB), Tenascin-C (TNC) and immune cells, and the survminer package was used to evaluate the 
prognostic role of appealing genes. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was used to determine expression levels of TNC in 160 
breast cancer samples pathologically diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified (IDC-NOS). 
Results: Pathway enrichment displayed that overexpression of CAFs-related genes mainly enriched in focal adhesion and PI3K-
AKT signaling pathway. Immune infiltration analysis suggested that high expression of CAFs-related genes was 
significantly positively correlated with the infiltration of B cell naive, dendritic cell resting, and inversely correlated with macrophages 
cell infiltration. In addition, high expression of TNC in tumor cells was associated with most adverse clinicopathological features and 
reduced metastasis-free survival (MFS) (hazard ratio 0.574, 95% confidence interval 0.404-0.815, P=0.035), and independent of 
ER status, blood vessel invasion and T stage in breast cancer.

Conclusions: In this study, we found that CAFs may participate in immunosuppression and regulate tumor cell proliferation and 
invasion through the focal adhesion and PI3K-AKT pathway. High TNC expression was associated with several adverse 
clinicopathological features, and high TNC expression in tumor cells was identified as an independent prognostic factor for IDC-
NOS.

Background: Atypical apocrine adenosis (AAA) in the breast is defined as apocrine cells with cytologic atypia involving sclerosing 
adenosis or nodular adenosis and is rare. Cytologic atypia in apocrine cells include threefold variation in nuclear size, 
hyperchromasia, and pleomorphic nucleoli. The diagnosis of AAA may be challenging and should be distinguished from apocrine 
atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and apocrine ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Atypical apocrine adenosis should lack the 
 
  
 
S149 
architectural complexity seen in apocrine ADH and DCIS and should not have necrosis. The incidence of AAA on core biopsy is 
very low with no clear guidelines on the management of these lesions. The purpose of this study was to determine the upgrade rate 
when AAA is found on breast core biopsy. 
Design: After institutional review board approval, the databases of three different hospitals were searched for AAA for a period 
ranging from 2010-2022. All breast core biopsies with AAA were identified and those with concomitant diagnoses of invasive 
carcinoma, DCIS, ADH, and non-classic lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) were excluded. The excisions of included AAA cases were 
identified and correlated with the biopsy. In each case, patient age, breast laterality, the lesion being targeted, the method of breast 
biopsy, history of breast cancer, and follow up were recorded. Cases without follow up for at least one year were excluded. 
Results: A total of 19 cases involving 18 patients were identified. Fourteen cases were in the right breast and five cases in the left. 
The age range was 33-71 years with a median age of 60. The imaging target was as follows: mass=11, architectural distortion=5, 
calcifications=3. Fifteen of the 19 cases were excised with no upgrade to DCIS or invasive carcinoma on excision. The patients 
who did not undergo excision had follow up ranging from 2-7 years with no breast cancer subsequently diagnosed. 
Conclusions: This study shows no upgrade to DCIS or invasive carcinoma of AAA diagnosed on breast core biopsy. Only a few 
studies have been performed on this topic and show varying results. While the number of cases in this study is small, with careful 
radiologic-pathologic correlation performed to ensure that the targeted lesion is adequately sampled, routine excision of atypical 
apocrine adenosis may not be necessary.

Background: Pseudo-lactational hyperplasia (PLH) is an incidental lesion discovered in biopsies from women who, curiously, are 
neither pregnant nor lactating. PLH is typically recognizable by its irregular oval acinar structures with pale luminal eosinophilic 
secretions and lined by hobnail-shaped cells containing vacuolated clear cytoplasms. Although PLH is a benign lesion, some 
atypical and in situ forms have been described suggesting a spectrum. Little is known regarding the histopathological and 
molecular aspects of PLH. We assembled a multicenter series of PLH cases, encompassing PLH lesions ranging from benign to 
malignant, and aimed at deciphering their clinical, histopathological and molecular characteristics. 
Design: We retrospectively collected cases displaying PLH from seven cancer centers and performed immunohistochemical (IHC) 
and molecular analysis using SNParray and next generation sequencing (panel of 66 genes). 
Results: We included 15 patients displaying PLH diagnosed between 2017 and 2020. All cases were female. The mean age at 
diagnosis was 46 years. Most lesions were revealed by microcalcifications on mammography (12/15) with a majority of BI-RADS 4 
lesions (10/15). We report five cases of PLH, three cases of atypical PLH and seven cases of pseudo-lactational carcinoma in situ. 
Atypical PLH and carcinoma in situ showed a complex morphological pattern: cribriform, papillary and micropapillary structures, 
associated with moderate to high nuclear atypia and with an increased number of mitoses. One case of carcinoma in situ showed 
necrosis. 11 cases were intermingled with cystic hypersecretory lesion. One patient showed a recurrence 1 year later with an 
invasive carcinoma. All cases expressed hormone receptors. Reactivity for estrogen receptor was diffuse with moderate to strong 
intensity in 9/16 cases. Only one case had diffuse reactivity for progesterone. One case showed an overexpression of the HER2 
protein (3+ staining) but without HER2 amplification by FISH. p53 IHC showed an aberrant phenotype in 7/16 cases: 1 atypical 
PLH and in 6 carcinoma in situ. Molecular analysis confirmed a TP53 mutation in 6 out of these 7 cases. In atypical PLH and in 
carcinoma in situ, SNParray analysis showed recurrent gains of 1q and 8q and losses of 14q (1q+8q+14q-).   
Conclusions: We herein describe for the first time the molecular alterations associated with atypical PLH and pseudo-lactational 
carcinoma in situ, characterized by recurrent TP53 mutations and 1q+8q+14q- genomic pattern.

Background: With the significant clinical benefits of novel HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugates in HER2-low breast cancers, 
accurate and reproducible assessment of lower levels of HER2 expression becomes crucial.  We assessed the reproducibility of 
HER2 IHC scoring among breast specialized pathologists in a HER2-low enriched cohort which were stained by two commonly-
used HER2 IHC kits. 
Design: 114 breast cancer cases were stained by both HercepTest and PATHWAY 4B5, and scored by six breast subspecialized 
pathologists independently using 2018 ASCO/CAP HER2 testing guideline. Level of agreement was evaluated by Cohen’s Kappa 
analysis. 
Results: The overall inter-observer agreement rates for HercepTest and 4B5 were 74.3% and 64.1%, and average weighted 
Kappa values were 0.76 and 0.65 respectively, which was statistically significant (p<0.01) (Fig. 1). The overall inter-antibody 
agreement rate between HercepTest and 4B5 was 57.8%, with a weighted Kappa of 0.58 (moderate agreement). Inter-observer 
concordance with 100% agreement rate were achieved in 44.7% (51) cases by HerceptTest and in 45.6% (52) cases by 4B5. 
Disagreement was highest in IHC 0 cases by both HercepTest (7 cases, 5%) and 4B5 antibody (10 cases, 9%) (Fig. 2). Absolute 
agreement rates on HercepTest increased from 78.1% for IHC score of 0-1+ cases to 91.9% for cases with IHC score of 2-3+. On 
4B5 antibody, it increased from 72.2% for IHC score of 0-1+ to 86.3% for cases with IHC score of 2-3+. Additionally, average 
absolute agreement on HercepTest showed moderate agreement for cases of 0+-1+ (Kappa value:0.53), substantial agreement for 
cases of 1+-2+ (Kappa value:0.61) and almost perfect agreement for cases of 2+-3+ (Kappa value:0.84). 4B5 clone also showed a 
similar trend, with moderate agreement for cases of 0-1+ (Kappa value:0.41) and 1+-2+ (Kappa value:0.38), while almost perfect 
agreement for cases of 2+-3+ (Kappa value:0.72).

Conclusions: Our results demonstrated notable inter-observer and inter-antibody variation for evaluating HER2 IHC, especially in 
cases with scores of 0-1+, although the performance was much more improved among breast specialized pathologists with the 
awareness of HER2-low concept. More accurate and reproducible methods are urgently needed for selecting patients who may 
benefit from the newly-approved HER2-targeting agent on HER2-low breast cancers.

Background: Low-levels of HER2 expression is an emerging promising biomarker for the treatment of advanced breast cancers 
with novel HER2-targeted agents. In this study, we analyzed the HER2 expression between primary breast cancers and matched 
resection specimens after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) as well as the likelihood of pathologic complete response (pCR), 
disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in HER2-zero, HER2-low and HER2-positive subgroups. 
Design: 139 breast cancer cases with available pre- and matched post-NAC samples between 2008-2018 at our institution were 
included. HER2 IHC was performed by HercepTest and was re-evaluated by consensus scoring according to 2018 ASCO/CAP 
HER2 testing guideline. Tumors were re-classified into HER2-0 (IHC 0+), HER2-low (IHC 1+ or 2+/ISH-negative) and HER2-
positive (IHC 3+ or 2+/ISH positive) subgroups. 
Results: The pCR rate was significantly higher in HER2-positive (44%) compared with HER2-low (23.1%) and HER2-0 (17.5%) 
tumors, while there was no significant difference between HER2-0 and HER2-low tumors (By Fisher Exact test, Fig 1). In 99 
patients with residual disease (RD) after NAC, the proportion of HER2-low cases were 21.2% (21/99) in pre-NAC biopsies and 
18.2% (18/99) in RD samples. The overall rate of HER2 evolution from pre-NAC biopsy to post-NAC excision specimen was 
30.9%. Among patients with HER2-0 expression on pre-NAC biopsy, 22.5% (9/40) experienced a conversion to HER2-low, while 
40.3% (21/52) of HER2-low tumors showed a conversion in the opposite direction. For HER2-positive group, 28.8% (13/45) of 
patients converted to either HER2-low (13.3%, 6/45) or HER2-0 (15.5%,7/45) (Table 1). Exploratory survival analysis based on the 
baseline HER2 expression did not reveal any significant difference in DFS among three groups. There was no significant difference 
in OS between HER2-0 and HER2-low groups, while both appeared to have inferior OS compared to HER2-pos group (Fig 2).

Conclusions: Our results with HER2 consensus re-review demonstrated a high dynamic change of HER2 expression after NAC in 
breast cancers, mostly driven by cases switching from and to HER2-low. The findings of this study may suggest re-testing HER2 
expression in patients with residual disease after NAC might help enhancing the access to potentially effective drugs in patients at 
high-risk of relapse, especially in the era of rapid development of HER2-targeted agents in HER2-low expressing breast cancers.

Background: RecQ DNA helicases play key roles in maintenance of genomic stability and homologous recombination (HR) DNA 
repair. Alterations in these genes are associated with cancer predisposition syndromes, such as Bloom (BLM) and RAPADILINO 
(RECQL4) syndromes. Their role in breast cancer (BC) development is poorly understood. We sought to characterize the histologic 
and genomic features of BCs with pathogenic alterations in these genes. 
Design: We identified BCs harboring germline or somatic pathogenic genetic alterations in BLM, RECQL and RECQL4 among 
8,571 BCs previously subjected to targeted sequencing. A histologic review was conducted following the WHO criteria; tumor 
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were assessed according to the International TILs working group. Estrogen receptor (ER)/HER2 
status was retrieved from medical records. Mutational signatures were inferred using synonymous and non-synonymous mutations 
using SigMA in cases with ≥5 SNVs. 
Results: The study cases include 69 BCs, including 34 primary (pBC) and 35 metastatic (mBC) BCs with germline (n=32) or 
somatic (n=37) alterations in RECQL4 (n=36), BLM (n=22) or RECQL (n=11). RECQL4/BLM/RECQL were affected by loss-of-
function mutations (n=54) or rearrangements (n=15) and were altered in a mutually exclusive manner. Bi-allelic inactivation as loss-
of-heterozygosity of the wild-type allele (LOH) was seen in 21% of pBCs and 17% of mBCs. Most of the 34 RECQL4/BLM/RECQL-
altered pBCs were invasive ductal carcinomas of no special type (IDC-NST, 82%), of histologic grade 3 (62%) and ER+/HER2- 
(47%) or ER-/HER2- (38%). Most of the 35 mBCs were IDC-NSTs (89%), poorly differentiated (83%) and ER+/HER2- (60%). 
Median TIL infiltration was 10% for pBCs and mBCs. No differences in TIL extent were seen between BCs with mono- vs bi-allelic 
alterations (P>0.05). Most pBCs (79%) and mBCs (68%) lacked a dominant HR deficiency (HRD) mutational signature; instead, a 
dominant APOBEC signature was detected in 67% of pBCs and 75% of mBCs with bi-allelic RECQL4/BLM/RECQL alterations. 
Conclusions: BCs harboring pathogenic alterations in RecQ helicases are enriched for ER+/HER2- high-grade tumors and display 
low TIL levels. In contrast to BRCA1/2 BCs, most RecQ helicases-altered BCs lack a dominant HRD mutational signature. 
Genomic features of these tumors might deviate from those of BCs with inactivation of canonical HRD genes, or the back-up DNA 
repair mechanisms elicited by loss of RECQL4/BLM/RECQL may differ from those triggered by loss of BRCA1/2.

Disclosures: Maha Khedr: None; Mohamed Desouki: None; Thaer Khoury: None 
Background: Treatment decisions in primary breast cancer patients and/or disease recurrence are based on hormone receptors 
(HR) and HER2 status. The emerging new medications, mandates to categorize those patients to guarantee the appropriate 
treatment delivery. The aim of our study is to evaluate the HR and HER2 evolution among primary BC and recurrence including the 
distant metastasis. 
Design: We retrieved ER, PR and HER2 results from the pathology reports in our database for BC patients with disease 
recurrence (local or distant metastasis). HER2 status was reported based on the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of 
American Pathologists. We excluded contralateral BC without other sites of recurrence and solitary bone metastasis. The ER and 
PR data were pooled together as HR as follows, HR positive is designated when either ER or PR were positive and HR negative 
when ER and PR were both negative. The HER2 was subclassified into HER2-negative [0+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC)], 
HER2-low [(IHC1+ or 2+ with negative in situ hybridization (ISH)], and HER2-positive [(IHC3+ or 2+ with positive ISH)]. The final 
categories for the HR/HER2 groups were as follows: HR-positive/HER2-0, HR-positive/HER2-low, HR-negative/HER2-0, HR-
negative/HER2-1 and HR positive or negative/HER2-positive. We studied the rate of discordance in the above categories between 
primary BC and the disease recurrence including distant metastasis. 
Results: A total of 287-patients who underwent tissue confirmation of locoregional recurrence or distant metastasis were 
included. The time range from original diagnosis to disease recurrence was 4.4 years.  Primary BC was positive for HR in 215 
(75%) cases. The rate of switching was 14% from HR-positive to HR-negative, and 7% from HR-negative to HR-positive. The 
distribution according to the primary tumor phenotypes and the recurrent tumor including local recurrence and distant metastasis 
combined is presented in Table 1. The overall discordance among the different categories was 34%. The highest rate of 
discordance was observed in the HR-negative/HER2-negaitve switching to HR-negative/HER2-low (64%).

Background: The eligibility criteria for metastatic breast carcinoma (BC) patients to receive Trastuzumab Deruxtecan is for the 
tumor to be HER2-low. The clinical trial accepted the results of any sample to be eligible, regardless of the origin, previous primary 
tumor or current metastatic carcinoma. The aim of this study is to evaluate the HER2 evolution from primary BC to locoregional 
recurrence or distant metastasis. 
 
  
 
S154 
Design: Our database was searched for BC patients with recurrence (local or distant metastasis) with available HER2 results 
scored based on the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists. We excluded cases with 
contralateral BC without other sites of recurrence and solitary bone metastasis. HER2 status was abstracted from the pathology 
reports and sub-classified into 3 categories: HER2-negative [0+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC)], HER2-low [(IHC1+ or 2+ with 
negative in situ hybridization (ISH)], and HER2-positive [(IHC3+ or 2+ with positive ISH)]. We compared all cases with the three 
staining categories. We focused on the HER2-negative versus HER2-low between primary BC, locoregional recurrence and distant 
metastasis, as combined and separate groups. The rate of discordance was compared in terms of the site of the metastasis. 
Results: A total of 287-patients who had tissue confirmation of locoregional recurrence or distant metastasis were included. HER2 
distribution and evolution in the primary tumor and locoregional recurrence or distant metastasis are shown in Table 1. Overall 
HER2 discordance between primary BC and locoregional recurrence or distant metastasis was 28% (24% locoregional and 30% 
distant metastasis), mostly driven from switching HER2-negative to HER2-low in 26/38 (68.4%) (39% locoregional and 91% 
metastasis). The rates of HER2 switching from HER2-low or positive to HER2-negative were 25/212 (12%) and 2/37 (5%), 
respectively. Among the discordant metastatic cases (n=41) for HER2-negative/HER2-low, 12%, 32%, 22%, 12%, 7% and 15% 
were in brain, liver, lung, pleural fluid, lymph nodes and others, respectively. Among each organ site, the discordance rate was 
38%, 29%, 56%, 25%, 40% and 32%, respectively.

Conclusions: Management based on a previous sample result may deny eligible patients and at the same time may have no 
benefit to others, as a good proportion of the cases convert from HER2-negative to HER2-low or from HER2-low to HER2-negative, 
respectively. Therefore, we recommend sampling the recurrent tumor when possible and testing for HER2

Background: Immunotherapy (IT) with checkpoint inhibition along with chemotherapy (CT) were accepted to treat patients with 
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in the neoadjuvant (NA) setting (KEYNOTE-522). Pembrolizumab is associated with several 
immune related toxicities. With NACT alone, around 40% patients achieve pathologic complete response (pCR). Therefore, there is 
a serious concern that we are potentially overtreating many of our patients in this setting, who can be cured just with CT alone. We 
aim to, 1. compare the response rate between two cohorts (CT+IT vs. CT alone), and 2, define clinicopathologic variables to 
specify certain patients who may benefit from adding IT. 
Design: The database of four collaborating institutions is searched for patients treated with CT and IT (n=54) based on KEYNOTE-
522 in the NA setting. The following variables were recorded, patient’s age and race, clinical AJCC (c-AJCC) stage, CT 
regimen/number of cycles, and IT regimen/number of cycles. Then, the cases were matched 1:1 with patients treated with CT 
alone, including the following variables, age range (10-years), CT regimen, c-AJCC stage, and histologic type (no special type, 
metaplastic). For all cases, the proceeding core needle biopsy (CNB) to the surgical resection was reviewed, and histologic type, 
degree of necrosis and the percentage of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were recorded. The resected tumor was reviewed, 
and the following variables were recorded, residual cancer burden class (RCB) [0-pathologic complete response (pCR), I, II, and 
III], the RCB score, and pathology AJCC (p-AJCC) stage. 
Results: pCR was achieved in 26 (48.1%) patients treated with CT + IT vs. 16 (29.6%) treated with CT alone (p=.075) (Table).  In 
CT alone group, pCR correlated with TILs with mean/standard deviation (SD) 40.3%/24% in pCR group vs. 24.1%/17.4% in non-
pCR group (p=0.017). In CT + IT group, pCR correlated with TILs with mean/SD 39.2%/22.4% in pCR group vs. 19.6%/22.8% in 
 
  
 
S155 
non-pCR group (p < .001). For c-stage III cases, 6 of 28 (21.4%) patients had pCR when treated with CT alone vs. 11 of 23 
(47.8%) when treated with CT/IT (p=0.07). Two of 5 metaplastic carcinoma had pCR in CT + IT group.

the maximum benefit to the patient with the least side effects. Larger number of cases is warranted to evaluate these findings. 
 
168  The Role of Axillary Lymph Node Residual Cancer Burden in the Survival of Triple Negative 
Breast Cancer Patients Treated with Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy

Disclosures: Thaer Khoury: None; Kristopher Attwood: None; Shipra Gandhi: None 
Background: In breast cancer (BC) treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAT), measuring the size of the metastatic 
carcinoma to the axillary lymph node (ALN) with therapy-related changes could be challenging. The aim of the study is to 
investigate whether the residual cancer burden in the largest ALN (RCBmet) correlates with the clinical outcomes; therefore, have 
the potential to improve existing RCB calculator. 
Design: We conducted pathologic review of 85 patients who had triple negative BC (TNBC) and had residual disease, diagnosed 
between 2002 and 2016. RCB of the primary tumor (RCBprim) is calculated as follows: √d1prim d2prim X fprim,, where d1prim and d2prim are 
the two dimensions of the primary tumor bed, and fprim is the tumor/tumor bed ratio. Then, RCB class and score were calculated 
utilizing published formula. The two dimensions of the largest involved ALN were combined as follows: √d1d2. We estimated the 
largest involved LN tumor/tumor bed ratio (fmet). RCBmet was calculated as follows: √d1d2 X fmet. Pathology-stage (p-stage) and 
clinical-stage (c-stage) were recoded following AJCC staging system. Clinicopathologic variables were correlated with the 
recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis with hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval 
(95% CI) were calculated. 
Results: p-stage-I was identified in 28 (32.9%) cases, II in 21 (24.7%), and III in 36 (42.4%). 20 (23.5%) patients died from disease 
after 5-years, and 23 (27.1%) after 10. In the univariate analysis, the following variables were statistically significantly correlated 
with RFS and OS including, RCB score (but not class), RCBprim, p-stage, c-stage, lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (extent and 
location), and RCBmet. In the multivariate analysis including p-stage and RCBmet, RCBmet correlated with OS [HR and 95% CI 1.71 
(1.25, 2.34) per standard deviation increment (SD inc) (p=.0008)], while p-stage did not. RCBmet correlated with RFS [HR and 95% 
CI 1.79 (1.31, 2.43) per SD inc (p=0.0002)]. p-stage correlated with RFS with HR and 95% CI of 1.23 (0.14, 10.53) for p-stage II vs. 
I, and 4.16 (0.55, 31.64) for p-stage III vs. I (p=.033). When RCBmet and RCB score were included, only RCBmet correlated with both 
RFS and OS with HR and 95% CI of 1.96 (1.47, 2.6) per SD inc (p<.0001) and 2.02 (1.50, 2.70) per SD inc (p<.0001), respectively. 
Conclusions: RCBmet could improve the predictability power of the existing formula that calculates the RCB index for TNBC 
treated with NAT

Background: PTPRF Interacting Protein Alpha 1 (PPFIA1) plays an important role as a regulator of cell motility and tumor cell 
invasion and is frequently amplified in breast cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic features, 
survival, anticancer immunities and specific gene sets related to high PPFIA1 expression in patients with breast cancer. We verified 
the importance of PPFIA1 and survival rate using machine learning, and suggested drugs that can effectively reduce breast cancer 
cells with high PPFIA1 expression. PTPRF Interacting Protein Alpha 1 (PPFIA1) plays an important role as a regulator of cell 
motility and tumor cell invasion and is frequently amplified in breast cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
clinicopathologic features, survival, anticancer immunities and specific gene sets related to high PPFIA1 expression in patients with 
breast cancer. We verified the importance of PPFIA1 and survival rate using machine learning, and suggested drugs that can 
effectively reduce breast cancer cells with high PPFIA1 expression. 
Design: This study analyzed clinicopathologic factors, survival rates, immune profiles and gene sets according to PPFIA1 
expression in 3,457 patients with breast cancer from the Kangbuk Samsung Medical Center cohort (456 cases), the Molecular 
Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (1,904 cases) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (1,097 cases). We applied 
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), in silico cytometry, pathway network analyses, in vitro drug screening, and gradient boosting 
machines (GBM). 
Results: High PPFIA1 expression in breast cancer was associated with worse prognosis with reduced tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes, especially CD8+ T cells, and increased PD-L1 expression. In pathway network analysis, PPFIA1 was linked directly 
to the tyrosine-protein phosphatase pathway and indirectly to immune pathways. The importance of PPFIA1 associated with 
survival rate in GBM was higher than that of perineural and lymphovascular invasion. In vitro drug screening, erlotinib effectively 
suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cell lines.

Background: Somatic chromosomal rearrangements involving NTRK genes often results in oncogenic fusion protein that can be 
detected via Pan-TRK immunohistochemistry. Pan-TRK IHC has been reported to be a sensitive and specific test for confirming the 
diagnosis of secretory breast carcinoma; however, the number of breast cancers analyzed to date have been limited. The aim of 
our study was not to identify secretory carcinomas but rather survey a large cohort of well characterized triple negative breast 
cancers (TNBCs) for high Pan-TRK expression which may then be amenable to targeted therapy. 
Design: Five tissue microarrays containing 245 untreated TNBCs (not subjected to neoadjuvant chemotherapy) represented in 
triplicate were evaluated with Pan-TRK IHC (clone EPR17341, Ventana). Staining in any cellular compartment and with an H-score 
of 1 was considered a positive result. H-score of 1-100 was considered low, 101-200 intermediate, and 201-300 as high 
expression. Semi-quantitative expression was correlated with tumor morphology. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and breast 
cancer-specific survival (BCSS) were evaluated with respect to Pan-TRK results. 
Results: Pan-TRK expression was seen in 47% cases (table 1). None of the cases showed nuclear expression, which is expected 
in secretory carcinomas with ETV6-NTRK3 fusions.  Low expression is common in TNBC but likely does not correlate 
with NTRK gene fusion (as per prior studies). Intermediate to high expression was seen in 9 cases (4%, figure 1). These latter 
cases may have NTRK gene fusions with partner gene other than ETV6. None of these cases had morphology of secretory 
carcinoma. There was no difference in RFS (log rank test p-value 0.973) or BCSS (p-value 0.215) with respect to Pan-TRK results.

Conclusions: While low expression with Pan-TRK is common in TNBC, intermediate to high expression is rare (<5%). Carcinomas 
with no special type morphology and intermediate to high Pan-TRK expression should be tested for fusion transcript for potential 
therapeutic value.

Background: Metaplastic breast carcinomas (MBC) are aggressive tumors with molecular features that broadly align with cell 
lineage. Many markers have been studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC), especially to differentiate MBC from phyllodes tumor or 
sarcoma. Whether expression varies among MBC subtypes has not been evaluated in detail, but may be useful diagnostically and 
elucidate oncogenic drivers. We evaluated IHC markers across MBC subtypes and correlated expression patterns with genetics. 
Design: 55 MBC were studied: 12 chondroid matrix-producing (CMC), 11 spindle cell (SPC), 8 squamous cell (SQC), 9 mixed 
spindle/squamous (MSSC), 15 mixed with chondroid +/- osseous differentiation (diff) (MCOD). IHC was performed for TRPS1, 
SOX10, P63, GATA3, P53, RB, P16, beta-catenin (BCAT) and SATB2. MBC were scored by percent positive tumor cells (focal [F] 
1-9%, patchy [P] 10-49%, diffuse [D] >49%) and H-score (HS). Next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) was performed using an 
assay targeting exons of 480 cancer genes. 
Results: TRPS1 was positive in 57% MBC (n=35), including 100% MCOD and 89% CMC compared to only 20% SQC, 17% SPC 
and 17% MSSC (p<.001). MCOD (100%) and CMC (67%) were often TRPS1 P or D, in contrast to SQC (20%), SPC (0%) or 
MSSC (0%) (p<.05 each). SOX10 was positive (and P or D) in 100% CMC but only 13% MSSC and 0% SQC or SPC (p<.001). P63 
was positive in 94% MBC (n=49) and was D in 57% SQC and 40% SPC vs 0% CMC or MCOD. P63 mean HS was higher in SQC 
and SPC than CMC and MCOD (p<.05 each). GATA3 was more often P or D in SQC (67%) than SPC (0%), CMC (9%) or MCOD 
(8%) (p<.05 each), and mean HS was higher in SQC and MSSC than other subtypes (p=.002). BCAT was nuclear (n) in 47% MBC 
(n=38) but was F in most (89%). MCOD (90%) more often had nBCAT than CMC (33%, p=.02) or SPC/SQC/MSSC (32%, p=.005). 
SATB2 staining in >70% cells was restricted to MBC with osseous diff (100% vs 0% other MBC, p<.001). RB was negative in 53%

Conclusions: Expression of common IHC markers in MBC varies by subtype. MCOD and CMC are usually TRPS1 positive, and 
CMC are SOX10 positive. P63 is more often D in SQC and SPC, and GATA3 is more often P/D in SQC. nBCAT is usually focal 
across subtypes. Awareness of these staining patterns may be useful for diagnosis of primary or metastatic MBC. Along with PI-3 
kinase and TP53, differential aberrations in the RB/CDK4/P16 axis reflect distinct oncogenic pathways between subtypes that may 
have treatment implications.

Background: Visual interpretation of IHC HER2 staining is subjective, leading to intra- and inter-pathologist variability. Recent 
findings on the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapy on HER2-low patients raises the need for accurate and reproducible 
scoring. This study aimed to validate the use of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based solution for reviewing and reporting HER2 
scores in breast samples in comparison to standard practice of manual scoring based on ASCO/CAP 2018 guidelines. 
Design: We developed a fully automated AI-based solution for HER2 scoring. The AI solution performs three steps: 1) It runs an AI 
model detecting areas of invasive carcinoma within the HER2 slide; 2) It then employs another AI model that identifies individual 
tumor cells and classifies their staining pattern; 3) Finally, it counts cells and determines the HER2 score according to ASCO/CAP 
2018 guidelines. The AI models were trained on >770,000 image samples annotated by a team of senior pathologists in a large, 
diverse set of slides from multiple labs and scanners. A two-arm retrospective reader study comparing the performance of 
pathologists using the HER2 AI-based solution with pathologists reviewing digitally with manual scoring was performed. Both arms 
were compared to rigorous ground truth (GT) established by consensus of breast subspecialists. Rates of discrepancies between 
each arm and GT were compared. 
Results: The HER2 algorithm showed very high performance for detecting areas of invasive cancer in HER2-stained IHC slides 
(AUC=0.967) and for determining the type and staining pattern of individual cells – e.g., tumor vs. non-tumor cells (AUC=0.931) 
and negative vs. stained tumor cells (AUC=0.936) (results were measured with 4-fold cross validation). The study endpoints 
included accuracy of the HER2 scoring by pathologists with and without the AI system compared to the GT, and pathologists’ 
feedback on the performance and potential benefits of the AI solution.

Conclusions: This study reports the successful validation of an AI-based solution for accurate IHC HER2 scoring in breast cancer. 
AI solutions, such as the one reported here, could be used as decision-support tools for pathologists in routine clinical practice, 
enhancing the reproducibility and consistency of HER2 scoring, thus enabling optimal treatment pathways and better patient 
outcomes. Accurate and automatic IHC scoring solutions can also contribute to the development of new prognostic, predictive and 
companion diagnostic tools.

Background: Recent advances in immunotherapy have shown promising results in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In 
particular, studies regarding programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) co-inhibitory 
pathway observed that PD-L1 expressing TNBCs had better prognosis and increased response to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. 
However, there are few studies on programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2) and its relationship to PD-L1/PD-1 co-inhibitory 
pathway. 
 
  
 
S162 
Design: 319 TNBC cases diagnosed between 2003 and 2013 in Singapore General Hospital were used in this study. Tissue 
microarray blocks (TMAs) was stained with anti-PD-L2 antibody (D7UHC). Immunostaining was scored based on expression in 
tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and positivity was defined as ≥ 2 TILs count. A total of 874 immune/hypoxia-associated 
genes in the NanoString panel were tested for significant differential expression between sample groups using Welch’s t-tests with 
multiple testing corrections. PDCD1LG2 expression association with survival outcomes and identification of differentially expressed 
genes were also assessed in METABRIC and TCGA. 
Results: PD-L2 TILs positivity was observed in 22.3% (71/319) cases, where higher densities of PD-L2 TILs is significantly 
associated with better disease-free survival (DFS, P = 0.044) and histological subtype (P = 0.001). Within the same cohort, 
high PDCD1LG2 transcript levels reported significantly improved survival rates [DFS: P < 0.001, OS: P < 0.001] and association 
with tumor size (P = 0.043). Similarly in METABRIC, high PDCD1LG2 conferred significantly better relapse-free survival (P = 
0.03323). Top-10 key hub genes were identified between sample groups in PDL2 TILs (SGH: PTPRC, CD4, CD8A, IL10RA, 
CTLA4, ITGB2, LCP2, SELL, IFNG, TYROBP) and PDCD1LG2 (SGH/METABRIC/TCGA: CD4, PTPRC, CD86, CD80, IRF8, IL1B, 
ITGB2, CD274, IL10RA, IFNG). Interestingly, all hub genes were markedly downregulated in negative PD-L2 TILs or 
low PDCD1LG2 sample groups, and is significantly associated with poorer survival rates within 3 TNBC databases. 
Figure 1 - 173 
 
Figure 2 - 173 
 
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate PD-L2 expression in TILs to be significantly associated with better prognosis in TNBCs. 
Furthermore, our data suggest that PD-L2 could function independently of PD-L1 expression with key regulatory roles in identified 
immune genes signatures. However, further studies are required to review the prognostic signature of PD-L2 and its role in the 
tumour microenvironment and immune response.

Background: It is well-established treatment strategy for anti-HER2 therapy in patients with HER2 3+ and 2+ with amplification in 
situ hybridization (ISH) results. Furthermore, a promising response has recently been shown for anti-HER2 therapy in patients with 
 
  
 
S163 
HER2 low-expressing breast cancers (i.e., HER2 1+ and HER2 2+/ISH unamplified tumors). However, the clinicopathologic 
characteristics and biology of HER2-low breast cancers are not well understood. 
Design: A total of 299 patients with first diagnosed breast cancer between January 2015 and December 2017 in the authors’ 
institute were evaluated for histological and clinical parameters. 
Results: The number of patients with HER2 IHC 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+ was 204 (69%), 51 (17%), 18 (6%), and 26 (9%), respectively. 
Among patients with HER2 2+ tumors, ISH was unamplified in 7 (39%) and amplified in 11 (61%). The estimated mean relapse free 
survival (RFS) according to HER2 expression are as follows:  87, 78, 76, 72, and 67 months in patients with HER2 IHC 0, 1+, 
2+/ISH unamplified, 2+/ISH amplified, and 3+, respectively (P=0.012, Fig 1). In HER2-low and negative (score 0) cases, there was 
no statistical difference in age, tumor size, TNM stage, and histologic grades. After excluding triple negative breast cancers, the 
percentage of tumor cells with positive ER and PR expression were significantly lower in patients with HER2 2+/ISH unamplified 
than those with HER2 0, 1+ group (ER: 90.4%, 81.2%, 31.4%, P<0.001; PR: 65.6%, 44.4%, 13.3%, P<0.001 in HER2 0, 1+, 
2+/ISH unamplified respectively, Fig 2), however the level of Ki67 was not different (P=0.678). 
Figure 1 - 174 
 
 
Figure 2 - 174 
 
 
Conclusions: The significant prognostic implication of HER2 overexpression was shown in our study. In HER2-low expressing 
breast cancers, the levels of ER and PR inversely correlated with HER2 levels, which may have clinical impact on tailored 
treatments for anti-HER2 and hormonal therapy in patients with HER2 low breast cancers. The clinical and prognostic implication of 
HER2 low breast cancer needs to be further validated in larger cohort prospective studies.

Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has an important role in management of breast cancer patients. Biomarker 
changes according to NAC has variably reported previously. Here, we investigated the impact of NAC on biomarker expression in 
breast cancer patients. 
 
  
 
S164 
Design: We reviewed pathologic reports of 106 patients who had paired biopsy and post-NAC resection samples from 2016 to 
2022. Total 106 cases of invasive breast carcinoma were included. The results of ER, PR, HER2, p53, and Ki-67 proliferation index 
were collected and survival analysis was performed. 
Results: After NAC treatment, 81 (76.4%) out of 106 patients had any residual disease. 68 (83.9%) patients had any changes in at 
least one biomarker. Among 68 patients with residual disease, 31 (38.3%) patients were hormone receptor HR(+)/HER2(-), 13 
(16.0%) patients were HR(+)/HER2(+), 17 patients (21.0%) were HR(-)/HER2(+), and the other 20 (24.7%) patients were HR(-
)/HER2(-). The status of ER, PR, HER2, p53 and Ki-67 index had significant difference in total patient group (p<0.001, p<0.001, 
p<0.001, p<0.001, and p=0.01, respectively) before and after NAC. There was no case of increase of Ki-67 index after NAC. In 31 
HR(+)/HER2(-) patients, expression of ER, PR and p53 showed significant difference according to NAC (p=0.002, p=0.006, and 
p<0.001, respectively). Among 13 patients of HR(+)/HER2(+) group, significant difference was identified in expression of HR and 
p53 (p=0.033 and p=0.002, respectively). In group of 17 HR(-)/HER2(+) patients, p53 status had significant difference according to 
NAC (p<0.001). In 20 patients with HR(-)/HER2(-), p53 status and Ki-67 index had significant difference before and after NAC 
(p<0.001, p=0.002). In total 81 patients with residual disease, patients of HR(+)/HER2(-) in pre-NAC biopsy had worst DFS 
(p=0.041). Negative to positive change of p53 was associated with worst DFS, no change of p53 had best DFS, and positive to 
negative change of p53 had intermediate outcome in DFS (p<0.001) and decrease in Ki-67 index after NAC correlated with better 
DFS though it was not statistically significant (p=0.053). In HR(+)/HER2(-) patients, negative to positive change of p53 was 
associated with worst DFS, no change of p53 had best DFS, and positive to negative change of p53 had intermediate outcome in 
DFS (p=0.006). Among HR(+)/HER2(-) group, decrease in Ki-67 index was correlated with better DFS (p=0.033).

Complete Response for Breast Cancer Receiving Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy

Disclosures: Fengling Li: None; Yongquan Yang: None; Yuanyuan Zhao: None; Jing Fu: None; Xiuli Xiao: None; Hong Bu: None 
Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapeutic option for locally advanced breast cancer. In breast 
cancer patients receiving NAC, a pathological complete response (pCR) is regarded as a proxy goal for favorable survival. 
Clinicians currently mainly rely on empirical clinical risk stratification to make decisions about patients who should receive NAC. 
However, the routinely used pretreatment determination method is not accurate enough, and the demand for efficient prediction 
tools of pCR is still quite high. 
Design:  We enrolled 1035 breast cancer patients receiving NAC from four centers in China, and the largest cohort (N=695) was 
designated as the primary cohort (PC), with the other three serving as validation cohorts (VCs). Deep learning (DL) was used to 
generate predictive scores from tumor epithelium (TE), tumor-stroma (TS), and representative tumor regions (TR) respectively 
based on three different basal DL architectures. The only combination of region and architecture was selected in PC and then 
inference was performed in VCs. Integrated prediction-model (IPM), a random forest model that incorporates the histology score 
and important clinical parameters, was created to predict pCR. Additionally, we comprehensively tested the IPM. 
Results: The combination of inceptionV4 architecture and TR generated score, called TR-score, showed an AUC of 0.735 (95%CI 
0.692-0.777) and was determined. The TR-score showed AUCs of 0.757 (95%CI 0.670-0.843), 0.636 (95%CI 0.521-0.750), and 
0.627 (95%CI 00.447-0.806) in VCs respectively. To create the IPM for better pCR prediction, significant clinical parameters such 
as T-stage, HR, HER2, Ki67 , and grade were integrated with TR-score. The AUCs were 0.808 (95%CI 0.775-0.841) in PC, 0.810 
(95%CI 0.763-0.855) in V1, 0.792 (95%CI 0.767-0.832) in V2, and 0.733 (95%CI 0.698-0.782) in V3, indicating that the IPM 
demonstrated effective discrimination of pCR across all cohorts. In PC and VCs, IPM demonstrated strong sensitivity and 
specificity; particularly, the NPVs for predicting pCR were 0.916 and 0.890, respectively.  IPM divided patients into NAC-sensitive 
(SEN) and NAC-insensitive (INSEN), with the NAC-SEN group showing a higher pCR rate than the NAC-INSEN group (P<0.05).

Background: T cell exhaustion (Tex) belongs to a state of T cell dysfunction, which enables cancer cells to develop immune 
escape, thus forming a barrier to anti-cancer immunotherapy. However, the molecular basis of T cell exhaustion in triple-negative 
breast cancer (TNBC) remains unclear. Herein, we are dedicated to exploring the expression abundance and its potential 
molecular mechanisms of the Tex signature in TNBC. 
Design: Multi-centered microarray and RNA-sequencing datasets of BC tissue samples were obtained from GEO, TCGA, 
Metabric, and ArrayExpress. The comprehensive expression statuses of nine Tex markers were compared between distinct BC 
molecular subtypes by calculating standardized mean difference (SMD). Kaplan-Meier and Cox survival analyses were performed, 
and the prognostic value of Tex signature was comprehensively assessed by pooling hazard ratios (HR). Based on a TIMER 
algorithm, the association between Tex signature and tumor microenvironment was quantified. The potential of Tex signature in 
forecasting anti-PDL-1 immunotherapy response was evaluated in the IMvigor210 cohort by using a support vector machine (SVM) 
learning. Potential therapeutic agents for treating TNBC were predicted by targeting Tex signature in Cellminer. 
Results: Compared to non-cancerous breast tissue and non-TN BC tissue, a total of six Tex markers were significantly 
upregulated in TNBC tissue samples (SMD >0, p<0.05). Among them, PD1, CTLA4, TIM3, and LAG3 may be potent risk factors for 
relapse-free survival of BC patients. All the Tex markers were positively correlated to the infiltration levels of B cells in TNBC tissue 
(R>0.30, p<0.05) but negatively correlated to the tumor purity of TNBC tissue (R<-0.30, p<0.05). Additionally, the majority of Tex 
markers were positively associated with the infiltrations of CD8+ T, CD4+ T, neutrophil, and dendritic cells (Figure 1) (R>0.30, 
p<0.05). Moreover, Tex signature might have the potential in predicting the immunotherapy response and immune phenotype in the 
IMvigor210 cohort (Figure 2A) (immune phenotype: training set AUC=0.855, testing set AUC=0.785; overall response: training set 
AUC=1.000, testing set AUC=0.629). Moreover, the Tex signature was predicted to participate in negative regulation of the immune 
system process (Figure 2B). TAK−632, Vemurafenib, and FLX−8394 were anticipated to be putative anti-cancer agents by 
targeting TIM3 and CTLA4.

Background:  Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous group of cancers. The luminal androgen receptor 
(LAR) subtype is characterized by the expression of the Androgen Receptor (AR) and its downstream effects. The aim of this study 
was to determine the appropriate threshold of AR positive TNBC, investigate whether AR status affects the efficacy of neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy (NACT) in TNBC patients, and determine the landscape of mutations associated with pathological complete 
response (pCR) in LAR cases. 
Design: AR and FOXC1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on core-needle biopsy (CNB) specimen before NACT in 226 
TNBC patients between 2018 and 2022. Response was evaluated in terms of pCR in the subsequent mastectomy or breast 
conservation specimens. 44 LAR cases were further investigated by next-generation sequencing (NGS). 
Results:  Among 226 TNBC patients, the percentage of AR negative, AR＜10% and AR≥10% cases were 61.50% (139), 
5.75%(16),and 26.99%(71), respectively. AR≥10% tumors demonstrated distinct clinical and pathological features compared to AR 
negative patients, while no significant difference was seen between AR negative and AR＜10% cases. Thus, AR≥10% was defined 
as AR positivity. Of the 226 TNBC patients, pCR was observed in 62 cases (27.43%). Tumors with LAR phenotype(AR positive 
TNBC) presented a pCR rate of 12.68% compared to 34.19% of the AR negative group (p＜0.001). In TNBC, the multivariate 
analysis indicated that FOXC1 was an independent predictor of pCR (p =0.042), while AR was not. The pCR rate was higher in 
tumors with FOXC1 expression compared to FOXC1 negative TNBC patients (34.44% vs. 3.13%, p＜0.001). In the LAR subgroup, 
patients with FOXC1 expression showed higher Ki-67 expression (p =0.011) and higher histologic grade (p＜0.001). In addition, 
patients with FOXC1 expression showed a higher rate of pCR as compared to FOXC1 negative patients (28.00% vs. 0.00%, 
 
  
 
S169 
p=0.01). The identified alterations in non-pCR LAR cases were mainly categorized into PI3K/mTOR pathway alterations (loss or 
mutation of PTEN, mutations in PIK3CA, PIK3R1, TSC2 or AKT1). 
Figure 1 - 178 
 
Conclusions: This study indicated that the LAR phenotype is associated with lower rates of pCR after NACT. Our results suggest 
that assessment of FOXC1 in LAR patients may be applied as a predictive marker for the efficacy of NACT, and highlights the 
genetic basis in non-pCR LARs and provides a rationale for the AR inhibitor and PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in these tumors. 
 
179  Novel Immune Biomarkers Identified in Triple Negative Breast Carcinoma (TNBC) Using 
Spatially-Resolved Highly Multiplexed Protein Quantification

Disclosures: Xiaomo Li: None; Mingtian Che: None; V Krishnan Ramanujan: None; Shikha Bose: None 
Background: TNBC is an aggressive subtype of breast carcinoma. While immunotherapy has improved its outcome, the 
suboptimal response rates (10-40%), significant toxicity, and high cost underscore the need to elucidate the important factors in the 
tumor microenvironment and identify biomarkers that would help stratify patients for immunotherapy. Recent studies have revealed 
a TNBC subset characterized by a robust host immune response evidenced by increased tumor-associated lymphocytes (TILs) and 
increased immune cell and cytokine signaling. However, the importance of lymphocyte subsets and associated protein expression 
in the tumor microenvironment is incompletely understood. This study aims to identify candidate biomarkers in immune cell rich 
TNBC that may allow for a better selection of patients for immunotherapy. 
Design: 16 treatment-naïve TNBCs were selected including good (GP, DFS>5 years, n=8) and poor prognosis (PP, never disease-
free or DFS < 5 years, n=8) groups. All cases showed associated TILs. Tissue sections were imaged using three-color 
immunofluorescence (PanCK, CD45, DNA) for regions of interest (ROI) selection (Figure 1).  Six ROIs were selected in each case 
localizing stromal lymphocytes. 50 immune-related proteins (Immune cell type, activation status, immunotherapy targets) were 
quantified in all ROIs using the GeoMx Protein Assay in NanoString Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) platform. GeoMx DSP Analysis 
Suite was used for normalization and background correction. 
 
  
 
S170 
Results: 15 of 50 proteins showed statistically significant (p<0.05) differential expression in the two groups (Figure 2A). High 
expression of checkpoint inhibitors PDL-1, PD-L2, and IDO1 were noted in GP. Additionally, GP also demonstrated high expression 
of CD3, CD4, CD68, CD45RO, CD40, ICOS, and STING indicating a Th1 skewered tumor microenvironment. PP group 
demonstrated high expression of fibronectin and CD66b, and CD127 possibly indicating T cell exhaustion.  Linear regression 
analysis demonstrated a positive correlation of STING, ICOS, and IDO1 with PD-L1(Figure 2B). 
Figure 1 - 179 
 
Figure 2 - 179 
 
Conclusions: Our results showed that good prognosis TNBC cases displayed an acute inflammation microenvironment (Th1 type) 
seen in tumors during the elimination phase. Poor prognosis TNBC cases showed T cell exhaustion. IDO1, STING, CD40, 
CD45Ro, CD127 and CD66b are potential novel biomarkers. Additional studies are needed to determine the prognostic and 
predictive value in isolation or in combination for immunotherapy and patient selection.

Disclosures: Xiaoxian Li: None; Yuan Gao: None; Sarah Wood: None; Ji-Hoon Lee: None; Qun Wang: None; Sadaf Ilyas: None; 
Jane Meisel: None 
Background: For patients with locally advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the standard of care is to administer the 
neoadjuvant KEYNOTE-522 regimen (K522), including chemotherapy and immune-blockade therapy (pembrolizumab).  Pathologic 
complete response (pCR) is more likely in patients who receive the K522 regimen than standard chemotherapy, and previous 
studies have shown that pCR is a strong predictor of long-term disease-free survival.  However, factors predicting pCR to K522 are 
not well understood.   
Design: We retrospectively retrieved tissues from 59 patients treated with the K522 regimen at our institution.  Twenty nine pre-
treatment biopsies had slides that were available for pathologic review.  Nuclear grade, Nottingham histologic grade, Ki-67, and 
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) of the biopsy specimens were evaluated for these 29 cases. For the cases that did not have 
available slides, these variables were retrieved from pathology reports. In addition, tumor size and lymph node status by imaging 
evaluation before K522 and BMI at the time of biopsy of all 59 cases were retrieved from patients’ charts.  Binary logistic regression 
models were used to correlate these variables with pathologic complete response (pCR). 
Results: Of the 59 cases, 54 were invasive ductal carcinoma, NOS, 4 metaplastic carcinoma and 1 invasive lobular 
carcinoma.  Thirty-five patients underwent surgery following completion of K522 and 16 (45.7%) achieved pCR.  In univariate 
analysis, only TIL was significantly associated with pCR (p=0.0448); whereas other variables including age, race, nuclear grade, 
Nottingham grade, Ki-67, BMI, pre-treatment tumor size and lymph node status were not associated with pCR (p>0.1).  
Conclusions: Our real-world data shows a lower pCR rate than what was seen in the KEYNOTE-522 trial (45.7% vs 
64.8%).  Reasons for this are being investigated. High TIL is significantly associated with pCR rate in our cohort and may 
potentially serve as a biomarker to select patients for the optimal regimens.  Larger studies are warranted to investigate the role of 
immune cells in TNBC response to K522 and other treatment regimens.

Background: Abemaciclib has been approved for treatment of ER+/HER2- node positive breast cancer with high risk and ≥20% Ki-
67 expression. Therefore, accurate Ki-67 evaluation is important for optimal patient care. The International Ki-67 in Breast Cancer 
Working Group (IKWG) developed an algorithm to improve interobserver variability. However, this algorithm is tedious and time 
consuming. We modified the IKWG algorithm and assessed interobserver agreement. 
Design: Six subspecialized breast pathologists (practice experience <5 years: 4, ≥5 years: 2) evaluated 57 immunostained Ki-67 
slides. Each pathologist assessed the percentage of positive cells with any staining intensity in 5% increments (<1%, 1-5%, 6-10%, 
11-15%, 16-20%, 21-25%, 26-30% and >30%). The time spent on each slide was recorded. Our modified IKWG algorithm used 
eyeballing method at 40x to estimate the Ki-67 percentage instead of counting 100 tumor nuclei. Two rounds of ring study were 
performed before and after training with the modified algorithm after a 4-week washout period. Concordance was assessed using 
Kendall’s coefficient for all categories with 5% increments and Kappa coefficient for binary categories based on 20% as the cutoff 
(<20% vs ≥20%).  
Results: Analysis of ordinal scale ratings for all categories with 5% increments showed almost perfect agreement in round 1 
(0.821), with substantial agreement among senior and junior pathologists (0.718 vs 0.649). With our modified algorithm, agreement 
for all categories with 5% increments slightly decreased to substantial in round 2 (0.793), and was similar among seniors and 
juniors (0.756 vs 0.658). Agreement in round 1 vs round 2 remained substantial for both seniors (0.718 vs 0.756) and juniors (0.649 
vs 0.658). In dichotomous scale analysis using 20% as cutoff, the overall agreement remained moderate (round 1: 0.437, round 2: 
0.479). Agreement also remained moderate among juniors (round 1: 0.445, round 2: 0.505) and seniors (round 1: 0.436, round 1: 
0.437). Average scoring time per case was 37 seconds in round 1 and 71 seconds in round 2.  
 
  
 
S172 
Conclusions: In our study, overall interobserver agreement among subspecialized breast pathologists is almost perfect in 
evaluating Ki-67 using the conventional eyeballing method. The modified algorithm yields moderate (binary data) to substantial 
(categorical data) agreement among junior and senior pathologists. A better algorithm, probably with machine learning, is needed 
to accurately evaluate Ki-67 expression for optimal patient care.

Background: Intraoperative frozen section of the sentinel lymph node is used for evaluating the nodal status of patients with breast 
cancer. However, the sensitivity is low for micrometastasis. We develop an automatic method using the convolutional neural 
network to help identify the metastases in whole slide images (WSI) within 2 minutes. 
Design: A total of 954 sentinel lymph nodes frozen section examinations were performed from 2021/01/01 to 2022/09/27, including 
732 (76.7%) negative, 4 (0.4%) isolated tumor cells, 49 (5.1%) micrometastases, and 169 (17.7%) macrometastases. The glass 
slides were scanned by Hamamatsu S360 in 20x and seventy-two WSIs were selected and annotated for training the model (50 
macrometastases, 16 micrometastases and 6 negatives). All annotated WSIs were sent for training by a self-developed platform 
(EasyPath). Our system was built under R 4.1.3 accompanied by python 3.7 using the reticulate package. Another 105 metastatic 
cases were collected to validation test the algorism. 
Results: The results of the validation test were shown in table 1. Ninety-eight percent of the metastases were identified by our 
algorism in a very short time (average 87.3 seconds). The time spent, including slide scanning (taking about 1-2 minutes) and 
artificial intelligence (AI) processing, can be completed in less than 4 minutes. The two missed cases are due to severely crushed 
artifacts. (figure 1). Two macro-metastases and six micro-metastases were missed in the original frozen sections and were 
identified in the algorism. The performance of AI algorism was significantly better than that of original pathologists (p = 0.005), 
especially for identifying micrometastasis (p = 0.014).

Conclusions: Our AI system can work in a reasonable time, meeting the requirement of the frozen section. Especially for 
micrometastases, the AI system performs better than pathologists. With the assistance of the AI system, pathologists can improve 
the accuracy of the intraoperative frozen section of the sentinel lymph node. 
 
183  Mucocele-Like Lesions without Atypia on Breast Core Biopsy Performed for Indeterminate

Disclosures: Chad Livasy: None; Shayna DeSando: None; Daniel Coldren: None 
Background: Mucocele-like lesions (MLLs) of the breast are rare findings in core biopsy specimens and consist of dilated mucin-
filled ducts associated with extravasation of mucin into stroma.  Most MLLs are clinically occult and identified in biopsies performed 
for indeterminate calcifications.  Several studies have described an association between MLLs and presence of atypia or 
carcinoma.  Differing opinions exist on the need for surgical excision of MLLs identified in core biopsy specimens.  This study was 
initiated to specifically focus on upgrade rate and need for surgical excision for MLLs without associated atypia identified in 
stereotactic core biopsies for indeterminate calcifications.     
Design: After institutional review board approval, our system database was searched to identify all cases of mucocele-like lesion 
identified on stereotactic core biopsy for indeterminate calcifications.  Cases with associated atypia or carcinoma in the core biopsy 
were excluded.  All cases were reviewed by a subspecialty breast pathologist to confirm the diagnosis of MLL.  All imaging studies 
were performed by radiologists with subspecialty expertise in breast imaging.  Available excision pathology reports were 
reviewed.  An upgrade was defined by the presence of ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma in the excision 
specimen.  The frequency of any atypia in the excision specimen was also recorded.       
 
  
 
S174 
Results: MLLs were identified in 132 patients undergoing core biopsy for indeterminate calcifications.  A total of 74 cases were 
excluded either due to presence of associated atypia/carcinoma in the core biopsy or lack of follow-up excision.  Of the remaining 
58 cases, there were no cases (0%) that were upgraded to invasive carcinoma or DCIS.  Atypia in the excision specimen was 
identified in 7 cases (12%) consisting of 3 flat epithelial atypia, 1 atypical lobular hyperplasia and 3 atypical ductal 
hyperplasia.           
Conclusions: Mucocele-like lesions without atypia identified in stereotactic core biopsies for indeterminate calcifications have an 
extremely low upgrade rate to DCIS or invasive carcinoma on excision.  Breast imaging surveillance rather than immediate surgical 
excision is a reasonable option for these patients.

Disclosures: Christopher Lloyd: None; Heather Rocha: None; Nicole Ortiz: None; Chelsea Mehr: None 
Background: Cancers in patients who are CHEK2 mutation carriers have become a target for research in the hopes of yielding 
information that can assist patients and providers in determining cancer risk and treatment plans. Data are still lacking in regards to 
the breadth of the disease profile, particularly prevalence of different cancer types as well as pathologic features of breast cancers 
(BCs) in CHEK2 mutation carriers. The aim of this study is to collect clinical and pathologic data from a cohort of CHEK2 mutation 
carriers.  
Design: Genetic testing data was analyzed for patients that had previously underwent screening and tested positive for a 
germline CHEK2 mutation predisposing them to cancer. Patients' demographic and family history of malignancy were recorded. If 
the patient had a history of BC, surgical pathology data including tumor type, grade, lymph node involvement, estrogen receptor 
(ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 status were obtained.  
Results: Of the 120 patients, 25.8% (31/120) had a history of BC. The mean age of initial diagnosis was 49.4 years old. Of note, 
87.5% (21/24) of tumors biopsied were high grade (grades 2 & 3). A subset had lymph node involvement (8/24; 33.3%) at the time 
of diagnosis. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) accounted for the majority of BC at 58% (18/31) with an average age at diagnosis of 
54.6 years. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) was much less common at 13% (4/31) with an earlier age at diagnosis of 38.2 years 
(Table 1). The majority of carcinomas were ER (84.6%) and PR (69.2%) positive and HER2 negative (88.5%) (Figure 1). Regarding 
family histories of malignancies, 43.3% (52/120) of patients had a 1° family member with BC. This rate was higher than family 
history rates of other cancers (Table 1). Complete pathological records were not available for 7 patients.

Conclusions: Our cohort of patients with CHEK2 mutations predisposing them to carcinoma had a 25.8% rate of breast cancer. 
The cancers tended to be invasive ductal carcinoma, high grade (grade 2/3) and ER/PR positive. These patients also had higher 
rates of breast cancer in their family history than other cancers. These findings provide insight into this patient population and can 
ultimately guide surveillance and treatment for patients who test positive for CHEK2 germline mutations.

Background: The most common cause of hereditary breast cancer is an inherited mutation in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, 
which are associated with DNA repair. This study aims to identify the influence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations on 
clinicopathological characteristics in Mexican breast cancer patients at risk of hereditary invasive carcinoma focusing on tumor-
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), complete pathologic response (pCR), and prognosis. 
Design: A retrospective study of 168 Mexican females at high risk of hereditary carcinoma, according to NCCN criteria, and 
diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2011 and 2019 were included. Age, sex, tumor location, extent of resection, 
molecular subtype, WHO grade, TILs (according to International TILs Working Group), NAT (neoadjuvant therapy), recurrence, and 
death were collected. All cases were tested for BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes by NGS. A comparison between patients with mutations 
on BRCA1 or BRCA2 and patients without these or other mutations was performed. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall 
survival (OS) were analyzed using a Log-rank test.   
Results: Out of 168 patients, 24 (14.3%) showed BRCA1 mutation, 15 (8.9%) BRCA2 mutation, 129 (76.8%) no mutations. The 
most prevalent molecular subtype was TN (triple negative) for the mutated group (28/39, 71.8%), and luminal for the non-mutated 
group (78/129, 60.5%) (p<0.0001). The mutated group was predominantly Nottingham grade 3 (31/39, 79.5%) and the non-
mutated group was grade 2 (66/129, 51.2%) (p=0.0002). Clinical stage between groups was no different (p=0.16). Median TILs in 
patients with and without mutations (23.9 vs 17.9, p=0.06) were not different. There were no significant differences in DFS and OS. 
One-hundred patients received NAT. From the mutated group treated with NAT (27/100), 18 (66.7%) achieved pCR, while in the 
non-mutated group (73/100), 29 (39.7%) reached pCR (p=0.02). Multivariate analysis showed that BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations are a 
predictive factor for pCR (OR 5.196, CI 95% 1.746-15.462, p=0.003). 
Conclusions: Our findings suggest the relevance of the mutational status as an independent predictive factor to NAT in the 
presence of pathogenic BRCA variants in a Mexican population with breast cancer and a high risk of hereditary carcinoma. 
Although there was a tendency for higher TILs in BRCA mutated tumors, the difference was not statistically significant. The 
prognosis seems to be similar among both groups of patients.

Background: Trastuzumab deruxtecan has been effective in metastatic breast carcinomas with low expression of HER2 (Modi, et 
al. NEJM 2022). The molecular characteristics of this cohort is still unknown. We sought to characterize mutational landscapes in 
HER2-low breast carcinoma cases, and identify differences in HER2-negative, HER2-low, and HER2-positive breast cancers. 
Design: We performed retrospective review of advanced stage breast carcinomas sequenced using Oncomine Comprehensive 
Assay (ThermoFisher), an in-house next-generation sequencing (NGS) based assay. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining 
performed for ER, PR, HER2, and HER2 FISH results were recorded. HER2-low was defined as 1+ staining on IHC or 2+ staining 
with negative FISH. NGS variants were tiered using the AMP/ASCO/CAP system to reflect targetability and oncogenicity. Cases 
with unknown or unclear HER2 status were excluded. 
Results: NGS was performed on 147 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues, from 140 patients, 108 (74%) samples from 
metastatic sites and 39 (26%) from primary/locally recurrent sites. The most common metastatic sites were liver (32, 22%), bone 
(26, 18%), and brain (11, 8%).  There were 19 (12%) HER2-positive, 64 (44%) HER2-low, and 64 (44%) HER2-negative cases 
(Table 1). Variants in 73 genes were identified. Common tier 1 variants in HER2-positive cases occurred in ERBB2 (74%, 100% 
amplification) and PIK3CA (16%), while tier 1 variants occurred in PIK3CA and ESR1 in HER2-low (33% and 16%) and HER2-
negative (38% and 13%) groups. ERBB2 variants occurred in 9% of HER2-low cases (50% amplification and 50% single nucleotide 
variant/ insertions and deletions [SNV/indels]) and 3% of HER2-negative cases(50% amplification and 50% 
SNV/indels). CCND1 amplification was more common in HER2-low cases (27%), compared to HER2-positive (11%) and HER2-
negative (16%), but was not statistically significant.

Conclusions: Precision medicine to identify molecularly targetable alterations is rapidly becoming standard of care in oncology.  In 
our breast cancer cohort, 44% of cases were HER2-low, which is concordant with previous reports. Interestingly, these cases 
appear also enriched of actionable mutations in PIK3CA. Molecular characterization of breast carcinomas in disease subtypes, 
including those defined as HER2-low may further expand potential treatment options and further the understanding of HER2 
expression in tumorigenicity and treatment response.

Background: In HER2-positive breast carcinoma, different HER2 average copy number and ratio of HER2/CEP17 may lead to 
different response to HER2 targeted therapy. Our aim is to explore the response of invasive breast carcinoma patients with low 
HER2 amplification (HER2/CEP17≥2.0 & <3.0, HER2 average copy number ≥4.0 & <6.0) to HER2 targeted therapy in neoadjuvant 
setting. 
Design: The clinicopathological data of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who underwent chemotherapy and HER2-
targeted neoadjuvant therapy in Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Centre from January 2015 to July 2022 were collected. 
Patients were divided into four groups according to different results of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Group A: 
HER2/CEP17<2.0, HER2 average copy number ≥ 6.0; Group B: HER2/CEP17≥2.0 and <3.0, HER2 average copy number≥ 4.0 
and <6.0; Group C: HER2/CEP17≥2.0 and <3.0, HER2 average copy number≥6.0; Group D: HER2/CEP17≥3.0, HER2 average 
copy number≥4.0. Group B was defined as HER2 low amplification group according to literature. The clinicopathological 
characteristics and the efficacy of anti-HER2 neoadjuvant therapy of HER2-positive breast cancer patients with different FISH 
results were analyzed. 
Results: A total of 173 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer underwent anti-HER2 targeted neoadjuvant therapy were 
collected. The age of the patients ranged from 27 to 69 years (mean, 51.0 years).  According to different FISH results, there were 
12 cases (6.9%) in group A, 32 cases (18.5%) in group B (low amplification group), 30 cases (17.3%) in group C and 99 cases 
(57.2%) in group D. There were no significant differences in age(p=0.356), lymph node metastasis(p=0.129), MP grade(p=0.055), 
ER(p=0.195), PR(p=0.733), and Ki67(p=0.351) expression among the four groups. However, the low-amplified group B was 
enriched with HER2 2+ patients(27/32,84.4%) and no HER2 3+ cases(0.0%) were identified. The pCR rate of group B was only 
3.1% (1/32), which was the lowest among the 4 groups (p <0.001).

Conclusions: This study suggests different response to HER2-targeted therapy within HER2-FISH positive breast cancers. Low 
HER2-amplified breast cancers are enriched with HER2 2+ cases and less responsive to HER2-targeted treatment. Thus, it might 
be of clinical significance in subclassification of HER2-FISH positive breast cancers. Larger prospective studies are vital to obtain 
more accurate prognostic information in HER2 low-amplified breast cancers.

Background: Changes in breast cancer (BC) hormone receptor (HR) and HER2/neu (HER2) phenotype may occur following 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). This may be due to due to tumor heterogeneity, NACT-related selective pressure or technical 
issues. Currently, there is no consensus regarding biomarker re-assessment on residual tumor post NACT. This study aimed to 
determine if repeating biomarker studies in this setting identifies clinically actionable changes. 
Design: A retrospective review was conducted of tumor biomarker profile from 240 BC patients who received NACT followed by 
definitive surgery from 2019 to mid 2022. The biomarker profile (estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone receptor [PR], and HER2) of 
residual tumor post NACT was compared with that of the pre-treatment core needle biopsy. 
Results: Complete pathological response was seen in 72 patients (30%) and biomarkers were not repeated in a further 7 (3%) due 
to insufficient residual tumor. Repeat biomarker testing was performed on the post NACT surgical resection specimen from 161 
patients (67%). Changes in biomarker profile were observed in 36/161 (22%).  PR changed in 16/36 patients (14 positive to 
negative; 2 negative to positive, 1 of which also expressed ER). ER changed in 9/36 cases (6 positive to negative; 3 negative to 
positive). Changes in both ER and PR were identified in 2 patients (positive to negative). HER2 status changed in 9/36 cases (7 
positive to negative; 2 negative to positive).   
Conclusions: A change in biomarker profile post NACT was identified in 22% of patients with a tendency towards decreased 
expression. In 6 patients (4% of tumors tested) there was a positive change in biomarker status (2 with HER2 positivity, 4 with HR 
positivity) with potential to introduce new adjuvant treatment options. This study adds to the evidence that repeat biomarker testing 
post NACT may have a significant impact on therapeutic management in a small group of patients with BC. Whether re-testing of 
residual tumor should be performed as routine in all patients post NACT or be subject to specific selection criteria remains a matter 
of debate.

Background: With the advent of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy such as trastuzumab deruxtecan, further elucidation of 
the HER2-low category of invasive breast cancer (IBC) is necessary given the promising benefits of ADCs in this newly defined 
group (IHC score 1+ or 2+ and FISH negative). 
Design: We retrospectively reviewed paired H&E and HER2 IHC (HercepTest™) slides for 350 cases (2015-2017), FISH-negative 
by 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines. Consensus was determined by two breast pathologists (BP), with a third senior BP as arbiter in 
challenging cases that would be of clinical significance (16%, 56/350). IHC and FISH are performed on all IBC at our institution. 
Results: Of the 350 cases, 16% (n=56) were 0, 48.9% (n=171) were 1+, and 35.1% (n=123) were 2+. On review, 84% (n=294) 
were classified as HER2-low. Histologic grade (see table) and ER/PR status (see figure) were recorded by HER2 score. The 
majority of HER2-low and HER2 0 IBC were FISH group 5 (see table). Of note, 6.5% (19/294) of the HER2-low cases were 
assigned to the non-classical FISH groups (groups 2-4) as compared to 1.8% (1/56) of the HER2 0 cases. Of the HER2-low cases 
 
  
 
S179 
91.5% (n=269) were ER+ as compared to 80.4% (n=45) of HER2 0 cases. Oncotype DX was performed on 40.9% (n=110) of ER+ 
HER2-low cases with a mean RS of 15.8 (range=0-58); for HER2 0 IBC (42.2%,n=19) cases the mean RS was 14.7 (range=5-27).

Conclusions: In our cohort, a majority of cases (84%; 294/350) that were originally classified as HER2 negative by the 2018 
ASCO/CAP guidelines were classified as HER2-low, qualifying them for HER2-targeted ADC therapy in the appropriate clinical 
setting. As triple-negative IBC (TN; ER/PR/HER2 negative by current guidelines) has limited treatment options, the observation that 
a majority of TN IBC in this cohort (69.4%; 25/36) were classified as HER2-low raises the possibility that these patients may derive 
clinical benefit from HER2-targeted ADCs. This study adds to the limited literature available for this newly defined category. 
Additional evaluation is warranted to further assess the clinical benefit of treating HER2-low IBC with HER2-targeted ADCs. As 
acknowledged by others, the authors note that the distinction between 0 and 1+ is challenging, as such an alternate 
assay/methodology to reliably detect low HER2 expression is an important imperative for biomarker evaluation. 
 
190  Biomarker Testing in Microinvasive Carcinoma (T1mi) of the Breast: A Study of 79 Cases 
Highlights Need for Clinicopathologic Guidelines

Background: Per NCCN 2022 (PMID: 35714673) and St. Gallen 2021 Guidelines (PMID: 34242744), the optimal clinical 
management of T1mi (<0.1 cm) and the role of biomarkers in T1mi remain unclear. Emerging data suggest that T1mi and T1a (1-
<5mm) tumors show similar clinical behavior (PMID: 31342393) and that patients with T1mi benefit from anti-HER2 therapy (PMID: 
34830989); however, data on biomarkers assessment and its relevance in T1mi remains limited. 
Design: All relevant histopathological material and clinical data of consecutive cases of T1mi, diagnosed over 2 years: 07/20 to 
06/22, were reviewed. Diagnosis of T1mi was confirmed. Immunohistochemical-based biomarker preparations (ER, PR, HER2 & 
Ki-67) were re-assessed in T1mi and concurrent in situ carcinoma. 
Results: During the study period, 105 T1mi were diagnosed. 26 T1mi were not tested and excluded (larger invasive carcinoma or 
other T1mi elsewhere). 79 T1mi cases were studied (45 lumpectomies, 15 mastectomies, & 19 core biopsies; 61 ductal, 14 lobular 
& 4 mucinous). Nuclear grade was 2 in 43 cases, and 3 in 32 cases; with nuclear grade of concurrent in situ carcinoma 
being similar or lower in 63 of 65 cases with DCIS. T1mi comprised of <50 cells in 45 (57%) cases and >100 cells in 20 (25%) 
cases. ER, PR & HER2 assessment was possible in 60 (76%), 59 (75%) and 59 (75%) cases respectively; of which 38 (63%) were 
ER (+), 26 (33%) PR (+), and 25 (42%) HER2 (+). 2 of 6 HER2-equivocal (2+) cases were tested via FISH; one showed no 
amplification, and the other was inadequate (paucicellular). T1mi was no longer identified in slides from cases stained for ER 
(n:19), PR (n:20) and HER2 (n:20). 19 of these 20 cases comprised <100 cells. Assessment of proliferation was complicated or 
precluded by co-staining of Ki-67 in peritumoral lymphocytes and by paucicellularity. ER and HER2 status were concordant in T1mi 
 
  
 
S180 
and concurrent in situ carcinoma in 96% and 93% of cases, respectively. Endocrine and HER2-targeted therapies varied in the 
cohort. 
Figure 1 - 190 
 
Conclusions: In this study of 79 T1mi, results for ER, PR and HER2 could be obtained in about 3/4 of cases. Loss of T1mi in 
immunostained slides was the main obstacle to the assessment of biomarkers, mostly in cases with <100 cells. ER & HER2 results 
in T1mi and associated DCIS were concordant in 96% and 93% of cases respectively. Ki-67 testing, when assessed, was 
complicated by co-staining of peritumoral lymphocytes and paucicellularity. Guidelines for testing and clinical utilization 
of biomarkers in T1mi are needed. 
 
191  Can We Avoid Routine Excision for Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia Diagnosed on Breast Core 
Biopsy?

Background: In addition to long-term increased risk of breast carcinoma, atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) diagnosed on core 
biopsy (CB) is associated with an upgrade to invasive or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) on follow-up surgical excision. Although 
single institution studies of ADH upgrades have shown that observation and surveillance can be a safe approach in a select 
subgroup of patients with well-sampled lesions, currently most patients with ADH on CB undergo surgical excision of the CB 
site. The aim of our study is to characterize features associated with upgrade of ADH at our institution and to establish criteria to 
identify a subset of patients with a low risk of upgrade, who may avoid surgical intervention. 
Design: After institutional review board approval, we retrospectively collected imaging, clinical and pathologic data from January 
2020 to June 2022 on patients with image-guided in-house performed CB with a diagnosis of ADH without coexistent invasive 
carcinoma or DCIS. Cases without excision at our hospital or lacking complete follow-up were excluded. 
Results: A total of 44 patients were identified, aged 41 to 77 (median 56.5). Prior or synchronous carcinoma was established in 9 
patients. Imaging target was: mass or asymmetry (17/44), calcifications (21/44), and MRI enhancement (7/44). 41 were vacuum-
assisted biopsies and 43 used 9 or 12-gauge CB. Excluding a case of apocrine ADH with an upgrade to apocrine DCIS, all 
upgrades were ER-positive DCIS (6/43), and grade 1 or 2 (measuring 3 to 20 mm). The upgrades were seen in 3/21 CB targeting 
calcifications, 3/17 targeting masses (1/3 asymmetries), and 1/7 of MRI enhancements. In all upgrades of CB that targeted 
calcifications, calcifications were larger than 3 cm and were less than 50% removed by the CB procedure. Only the upgraded cases 
showed all three histological features in CB: at least two foci of ADH, complete duct involvement, and size no less than 2 mm. 
Conclusions: The upgrade of ADH is limited to borderline and small low to intermediate grade DCIS and is related to the size of 
the targeted lesion, adequacy of sampling, and qualitative and quantitative extent of ADH in the CB. With the inclusion of additional 
cases and with careful pathologic-radiologic correlation we anticipate defining a subset of ADH with a low risk of upgrade. Our 
preliminary data based on a limited number of cases supports the non-surgical management of ADH in a subset of patients who 
may benefit from observation and surveillance instead of surgery.

Background: In recent years, breast cancer (BC) operations have largely become outpatient procedures. The decision for BC 
systemic therapy relies significantly upon the expression of three key biomarkers: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor 
(PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). One drawback of outpatient BC procedures is that there may be no 
physical on-site pathology presence for punctual specimen processing, and therefore, delays in specimen transport and processing 
can have significant negative impacts on BC biomarker expression (i.e., false negatives), potentially resulting in omission of 
targeted systemic therapy. We aimed to evaluate the effect of practical alternatives, such as refrigeration and freezing, on BC 
biomarker expression. 
Design: Benign prophylactic mastectomy specimens from five patients were rapidly delivered to pathology, and from each, 4 “mock 
lumpectomies” were procured and assigned to one of 4 arms: room temperature (20-22°C) without formalin, room temperature (20-
22°C) with formalin, (pre-chilled) refrigerated formalin (4°C), and freezer (-18°C) without formalin. Excision into and submission of 
central tissue to create tissue blocks was done at 3 timepoints: 30-60 minutes, >90<120 minutes and 12-18 hours. 
Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains for ER, PR, HER2, and Ki-67 were performed. IHC was blindly quantitated using digital 
pathology software (QuPathÒ). The room temperature formalin arm was used as the “standard” control arm and compared with the 
remaining arms using two-tailed T-tests. Small tissue fragments were procured for future RNA analysis. 
Results: The median age of patients was 54 (range 30-66 years), median “mock lumpectomy” volume 25 cm3 (range 14.9-36.7 
cm3) and median weight 13.8 g (range 6.4-22.1 g). The refrigerated formalin study arm showed statistically significant preservation 
of ER expression compared to the room temperature formalin control arm (p=.027). Other study arms did not show differences in 
ER expression (Figures 1-2). Similarly, the refrigerated formalin arm alone showed preservation of Ki-67 that approached statistical 
significance (p=.07). Statistical analysis of PR and HER2 is pending.

Conclusions: Our novel pilot study shows promising results suggesting refrigerated formalin as the best alternative to preserve ER 
expression when surgical specimens may not be able to be rapidly triaged or grossed. However, larger scale studies utilizing BC 
specimens are needed to assess the reproducibility of these findings.

Background: The results of DESTINY-Breast04 trial reported at ASCO 2022 have established that Trastuzumab Deruxtecan, the 
anti-HER2 antibody drug conjugate, is a new standard of care for HER2-low metastatic breast cancer. HER2-low is defined as 
HER2 1+ or 2+ by IHC analysis and negative by FISH analysis, and HER2 negative breast cancer, including HER2 0 and HER2-
low subgroup, consisting of roughly 85% of all breast cancer, which was not previously eligible for HER2 target therapy. Thus, this 
newly developed HER2 target therapy can potentially help a significant portion of breast cancer patients. 
Design: We identified 2683 consecutive HER2 negative breast cancer treated in our institution during last 20 years, to determine 
the frequency of HER2-low breast cancer (HER2 1+ or HER2 2+/FISH negative). We also compared the clinical and pathological 
features among these three groups (HER2 0, HER2 1+ and HER2 2+/FISH negative) of HER2 negative breast cancer. 
Results: Among these 2683 cases of HER2 negative breast cancer, 46% (1229 cases) belonged to HER2-low subgroup (Table). 
13% of HER2-low breast cancer are ER/PR negative, compared to 20% in HER2 0 subgroup. These three groups of HER2 
negative breast cancer are significantly different in patient age, tumor size, and tumor types. Histologic grade and tumor markers 
are also different among these three groups with significantly more high grade and >20% KI-67 cancers in HER2 2+/FISH negative 
subgroup. More importantly, HER2 2+/FISH negative subgroup has significantly more >3 node metastasis and local or/and distant 
recurrence compared to HER2 0 or HER2 1+ subgroup.

Conclusions: This study has clearly demonstrated the biological difference among the three subgroups of HER2 negative breast 
cancer: HER2 0, HER2 1+, and HER2 2+/FISH negative. It provides the biological basis for the new HER2 target treatment of anti-
HER2 antibody and drug conjugate. 
 
194   Phyllodes Tumor of The Breast, A 18 Year Experience of a Single Institution

Background: Phyllodes tumor (PT) is a rare biphasic breast tumor, consisting of <1% of all breast tumors. It ranges from benign to 
borderline and malignant subtypes based on its morphologic features, which can overlap among themselves and with subtypes of 
fibroadenomas (FA). Recent findings of the recurrence mutation of mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12) and telomerase reverse 
transcriptase (TERT) hotspot mutation in PT and FA have not only shed light on their pathogenesis but also can serve as great 
tools for differential diagnosis of them. Biologically, PT can be locally aggressive; thus, historically, 1cm surgical margins were 
recommended for all subtypes of PT. However, breast surgeons across the country often do not follow this radical 
recommendation, as it may significantly compromise the cosmetic result of surgery. Based on recent data, NCCN (version 2.2022) 
has revised its recommendation for PT treatment: simple excision for benign PT and wide excision with 1cm margin for borderline 
and malignant PT. 
Design: We have retrospectively identified 75 cases of PT diagnosed and treated in our institution for last 18 years, in an effort to 
find the practice pattern, and the relationship between local recurrence and margin status, tumor size, and patients' age. 
Results: Among the 75 cases of PT treated in our institution for 18 years; all were treated with surgical excision only (Table). The 
benign, borderline and malignant PT consisted of 87%, 7%, and 5% of these tumors respectively. 12% (9 cases) of PT were in 
patients 18 years of age or younger, and 84% of cases with tumors 5cm or smaller. Three patients (4%) had recurrence, all 
occurred within 3 years of original diagnosis, only one with close <1mm margin, and 45% of cases with positive or close (<1mm) 
margins did not recur. Two patients with local recurrence were from benign PT and one patient with lung metastasis was from 
malignant PT. Both local recurrence cases occurred in patients with benign PT >2cm in size, occurred within 1 year (with negative 
margin) and 3 years (with <1mm margin) after original diagnosis. One malignant PT metastasized to lung only one year after 
original diagnosis (with negative margins) in a 64-year-old with a 5.5cm tumor.  None of the patients aged 18 years old or younger 
have recurrence.

Background: Inflammation is essential to induce an effective immune response and mediates tumor initiation and promotion. 
Maintenance of serum inflammatory mediators (IM) has been related to immunosuppressive cell recruitment and immune 
checkpoint expression. In breast cancer (BC), their release has been linked to tumor invasion, progression, metastasis and 
treatment resistance. However, little is known about their serum profile in BC phenotypes. 
Design: Pretreatment serum from 204 BC patients (23% Luminal A, 23.6% Luminal B/HER2-, 22.5% Luminal B/HER2+, 10.3% 
HER2-enriched and 20.6% Triple-Negative/Basal-like -TNBL-) and 50 healthy donors was collected. Measurement of 62 IM was 
performed using LEGENDplex immunoassay. Fluorescence intensity was quantified by flow cytometry. The results were correlated 
with clinicopathological factors (age, tumor size and grade, vascular invasion, necrosis, immunophenotype, tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes -TILs-, lymph-node status and Ki67). Statistical analysis was done by Student’s t-test and Mann–Whitney U test. 
Results: Compared to the healthy group, BC patients showed higher levels of SCF, MIP3α, EPO and 4-1BB but lower levels of IL-
2RA, IL-8, IL-12p40, IL-18, IL-23, IL-27, PDGF-AA, Galectin9, PDGF-BB, B7.2, MIP1β and PD1. Furthermore, IL-23, IL-27 and 
EPO correlated with younger age (p≤0.041), in contrast to Galectin9, MCP1, IL-2RA and MIP1β (p≤0.003). IL-12p40 and IFNγ were 
elevated in grade I (p≤0.05) and, in addition to IL-11 and IL-27, in low Ki67 tumors (p≤0.030). Moreover, IL-12p40 and IL-23 were 
associated with positive lymph nodes (p≤0.031). In Luminal tumors we detected high IL-12p40, IL-15, IL-23, IL-27 and IFNγ 
(p≤0.048), but only PDGF-BB in non-Luminal (p=0.040). IL-12p40, IL-18, IL-23, IL-27, SCF and EPO were mainly higher in Luminal 
A, while PDGF-AA in Luminal B/HER2-. Likewise, Luminal B/HER2+ serum was elevated for MIP1β, MIP3α and EPO, whereas 
Galectin9, PDGF-BB, IL-2RA, B7.2, SCF, 4-1BB and PD1 were found in TNBL, with no specific profile for HER2-enriched. 
Conclusions: Our results showed a specific serum profile of IM among BC phenotypes. Moreover, IL-12p40 and IL-23 were 
correlated with unfavourable characteristics in Luminal tumors, especially in Luminal A.

Background: Approximately 80% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER) positive making endocrine therapy the first line of 
treatment and current standard of care.  Despite therapy, 20% of patients develop resistance after long-term therapy. There are 
many genetic alterations associated with endocrine resistance including Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1) alterations. In this study, we 
analyze clinicopathologic features and prognosis in metastatic or recurrent breast carcinoma with ESR1 genetic abnormalities. 
Design: We evaluated 81 breast carcinoma patients with available Oncomine genetic profile on metastatic or recurrent tumors. 
They had undergone standard therapy according to their clinicopathologic stage and subsequently developed tumor metastasis or 
recurrence. The mean follow-up time was 63 months (range 0-315.8). The follow-up endpoint was defined as metastasis or 
recurrence. Clinicopathological evaluation and survival analysis was performed to compare the groups of ESR1 mutation (ESR-
MUT), ESR1 wild-type with positive ER (ESR-WT ER+), and ESR1 wild-type with negative ER (ESR-WT ER-). 
Results: There was no statistical difference of age, gender, laterality, histological types, pathologic stages and tumor biomarkers 
among the groups of ESR-MUT, ESR-WT ER+ and ESR-WT ER-. All the ESR-MUT breast cancer cases were ER positive and well 
to moderately differentiated, while ESR-WT ER+ and ESR-WT ER- breast cancers were poorly differentiated in 31% and 85%

cases, respectively. Among the ER positive breast cancers, although ESR1-MUT breast cancer showed significantly lower (1-
2) Nottingham grade (100% vs. 69% in ESR-WT ER+ cases, p<0.0262), ESR-MUT patients’ disease-free survival time appeared to 
be shorter than ESR-WT ER+ patients (median 51.7 months vs. 57.8 months, p>0.05). ESR-WT ER- patients had shorter survival 
time with no statistical significance (p>0.05) (Fig. 1). The most common (7/12) ESR1 mutation was D538G variant, 5 out of these 7 
cases had liver and or bone metastasis.

Conclusions: Endocrine therapy resistance is a main concern in ESR1 mutated breast cancer. It probably explains that although 
patients with ESR1 mutation had lower grade cancer, they did not show longer survival time. Therefore, endocrine therapy alone is 
not favored in ESR1 mutated breast cancer, instead combination with other chemotherapeutic agents is now being considered as 
the new standard of care. ESR1 genetic abnormalities may need to be tested in metastatic or recurrent breast cancer, especially 
when the primary tumor is well to moderately differentiated.

Background: Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is a group of mammary in situ carcinomas that occur in terminal duct lobular units 
(TDLU) and is characterized by loss of cellular cohesion. Classic LCIS (c-LCIS) is characterized by small dyscohesive cells with 
uniform hyperchromatic nuclei to slightly larger vesicular nuclei with mild variability, filling and expanding more than half of TDLU. 
When c-LCIS creates a confluent mass-like architecture with little to no intervening stroma between markedly distended TDLU 
and/or expands acinus or duct by filling an area equivalent to 40-50 cells in diameters, it is classified as Florid LCIS (f-LCIS). 
Pleomorphic LCIS (p-LCIS) is characterized by large dyscohesive cells with marked nuclear pleomorphism with nuclear size over 
four times the size of a lymphocyte (equivalent to the cells of high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)). 
Design: We retrospectively identified all in-house core needle biopsies (CNB) obtained between January 2011- June 2022 with f-
LCIS and/or p-LCIS. We reviewed all CNB slides and assessed radiologic-pathologic concordance. The biopsy target, imaging 
modality, size of the target, gauge of the biopsy needle, type of surgery, and outcomes were reviewed. An upgrade on excision was 
defined as invasive carcinoma (IC) and DCIS in the excision material. The excision slides of all upgraded cases were re-reviewed. 
Results: Out of ~32000 consecutive CNBs in the study period, 122 CNBs yielded f-LCIS, p-LCIS, or combined p-LCIS and f-LCIS, 
with classic lobular neoplasia. We excluded 60 CNBs with prior/concurrent carcinoma and 16 without available excisional material. 
After re-review, we reclassified 6 cases, one from DCIS to p-LCIS and 5 “extensive” c-LCIS to f-LCIS. The final p/f - LCIS study 
cohort consisted of 46 CNBs. The CNB targeted mammographic calcifications in 33 (71.7%) cases, MRI non-mass enhancement in 
6 (13%), and 3 (6.5%) sonographic mass. All CNBs were deemed radiologic-pathologic concordant. Excision yielded 10 (21.7%) 
invasive carcinomas, spanning 1-12 mm, and 5 (10.8%) cases of DCIS. One additional case showed atypical ductal hyperplasia on 
excision.

S187 
Figure 2 – 197 
 
Conclusions: The upgrade rate of p/f-LCIS was 32.6%. Compared to c-LCIS, most of the cases in the study cohort were imaging 
targets and not incidental. Previously reported by our group, the upgrade rate of c-LCIS on excision was 3.8%. We conclude that 
surgical management should be recommended for any non-classic LCIS (p-LCIS and f-LCIS) diagnosed on CNB.

Background: The incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has risen mainly due to improved capabilities of non-invasive 
detection through mammographic screenings. Risk in patients with DCIS following breast-conserving surgery primarily involves 
recurrence. Various clinical and pathological variables are implicated in prediction of the risk of recurrence outcomes in women 
diagnosed with DCIS. 
Design: In a retrospective study of 446 patients diagnosed with DCIS between 2006 and 2011, with first recurrence greater than 
6months after initial DCIS treatment and with >10 years of follow-up were included in this study. Clinical and pathological variables 
were reviewed in relation to the recurrence of DCIS. "Low-risk" was defined as disease-free since the DCIS diagnosis and surgery; 
while "high-risk" included recurrence of ipsilateral DCIS and ipsilateral invasive breast carcinoma (IBC). 
Results: Of the 446 patients, 9 had a local DCIS recurrence, 17 had an IBC recurrence, and one had both. The mean time to 
recurrence was 107 months, median 112 months and range 14 -185 months. These 27 cases were collectively grouped as “High 
Risk.” When looking at patients as high or low risk, surgical margin was found as significant (P =0.0354), Table 1. Notably, when 
comparing DCIS and invasive recurrences separately, ipsilateral DCIS recurrence was found to be more strongly associated with 
positive margin (P= 0.0019). When comparing those with invasive recurrence to those without, high DCIS grade was significantly 
associated with recurrence (P=0.0270). For clinical variables, race was significantly associated with recurrence, with those of 
African American descent have a higher relative incidence (P=0.0282). Kaplan Meier curves demonstrated hormone treatment 
(P=0.0050) and Radiation (P=0.0369) to be associated with improved recurrence-free survival (RFS).

Conclusions: Pathological variables such as surgical margin appear to have a significant impact on recurrence. Despite having 
less significance with clinical variables, it was interesting to see the association of AA race with recurrence in our patient 
population. Future prospective studies are necessary to determine variables which lead to recurrence in diverse patient 
populations.

Background: Assessment of ‘tumor bed’ size (TB) by imaging (I-TB) is clinically crucial in the management of breast carcinoma 
(ca) in patients undergoing NACT. TB must also be pathologically assessed via gross exam (G-TB) and microscopic exam (M-TB) 
for calculation of Residual Cancer Burden (RCB, http://www3.mdanderson.org/app/medcalc/). However, the measurement of TB 
can be problematic when the microscopic and gross extents differ. In this study, we compared the tumor size at presentation by 
imaging (I-preNACT), to I-TB, G-TB and M-TB. 
Design: All relevant clinicopathologic material of patients with invasive breast ca s/p NACT over a 11-month period (08/21-06/22) 
was reviewed. I-preNACT, I-TB, G-TB & M-TB were analyzed and compared, using the largest dimension as a surrogate for TB. 
Results: A total of 44 patients (median age: 52 [26-95]) were studied. Of these patients, 37 (84%) presented with invasive ductal 
ca, 32 (72%) were grade 3 and 17 (39%) had multifocal or multicentric disease before initiation of NACT. On pre-NACT testing: 14 
(32%) were ER-/PR-/HER2+, 13 (30%) were triple-negative, 12 (27%) were ER+/PR+/HER2-, and 5 (11%) were triple-positive. 
 
  
 
S189 
Median interval from diagnosis to surgery (mastectomy in 23 (52%) and lumpectomy in 21 (48%)), was 6 months (interquartile 
range (IQR): 5-7). Median I-preNACT was 2.4 cm (n: 44, IQR: 1.8-3.6) and median I-TB was 0.2 cm (n: 41, IQR: 0-1.8). Regardless 
of the presence of residual ca, median G-TB was 2.0 cm (n: 42, IQR: 0.7-3.3) and median M-TB was 1.8 cm (n: 40, IQR: 1.4-3.0). 
Twenty-three (52%) cases showed residual invasive ca with median largest contiguous focus (ypT, per AJCC/TNM System) of 1.0 
cm (IQR: 0.4-1.8) with associated median M-TB of 2.1 cm (IQR: 1.5-3.3).

Conclusions: In this study, (1) I-TB did not correlate with either G-TB or M-TB, (2) There was no statistically significant difference 
between G-TB and M-TB. (3) ypT per AJCC/TNM criteria differed from TB size per RCB criteria in all cases studied. Assessment of 
TB can be a complicated matter in some cases.

Background: In the era of multiomics data there is still no classification based on breast cancer (BC) epigenetics. Therefore, the 
establishment of an epigenetic signature based on DNA methylation for classifying BC patients with clinical outcome would be 
essential to better classify BC. 
Design: The present study aimed to assess the feasibility of a molecular screening program of advanced BC to facilitate the 
access to matched-targeted therapies. DNA sequencing of 74 cancer-related genes was performed using FFPE tumor samples. 
Gene expression was evaluated using a custom 55-gene panel on the nCounter. Intrinsic subtypes were determined by the 
 
  
 
S190 
research-based PAM50 predictor. DNA methylation profiles was performed using the Infinimum Methylation EPIC Kit (Illumina, Inc, 
San Diego, CA) (~850,000 CpG sites). Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis were performed. 
Results: Methylation data were obtained from 113 (37%) patients, 76 primary and 37 non-paired metastatic tumors. According to 
the IHC subtype, 83 (74%) were HR+/HER2; 13 (11%) HER2+ and 17 (15%) triple-negative (TNBC). The PAM50 subtypes were 30 
(26%) Luminal A, 21 (19%) Luminal B, 19 (17%) basal-like, HER2-enriched 15 (13%), 10 normal-like (9%), and 18 (16%) were not 
available. An unsupervised consensus clustering analysis of the top 1% most variable CpG probes was performed, and 3 groups of 
patients were established according to CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) as CIMP-low, CIMP-intermediate(int) and CIMP-
high (Fig. 1). The BC CIMP-low was enriched with the TNBC, basal-like subtypes and mutation in TP53, and was associated with a 
worse OS compared to CIMP-int/high tumors (Fig. 2). We established a CIMP epigenetic signature, and with only 15 CpG probes 
from the CIMP signature a machine learning algorithm (MLA) was trained to predict methylation BC subtypes in ABC tumors. The 
MLA classified with high specificity (0.939) and sensitivity (0.909) CIMP-low tumors of an external validation cohort from the TCGA.

Figure 2 - 200 
 
 
 
Conclusions: The epigenetic classification of BC according to the CIMP has an important prognostic value. Our epigenetic 
signature is useful to classify CIMP-low tumors with high specificity and sensitivity.

201   Breast Cancers Negative for HER2 Over-Expression/Amplification Have Inconsistent HER2 IHC 
Results from Primary to Metastatic Samples: Can We Trust Metastatic Site IHC 0 Results?

Mammatome 
Background: The antibody drug-conjugate trastuzumab-deruxtecan (T-DXd) was originally FDA approved as a treatment option 
for metastatic breast cancers testing positive for HER2 over-expression/amplification.  In August of 2022 the FDA expanded this 
approval to include HER2 IHC 1+ or 2+/ISH negative metastatic cancers, based on the results of the DESTINY-Breast04 trial. 
While HER2 IHC 0 cases were not included in this trial, the difference between an IHC 0 and a non-zero result is now clinically 
relevant. We sought to determine if breast cancers have consistent HER2 IHC 0 vs 1-2+/ISH- results with metastatic progression 
and to determine how frequently metastatic IHC 0 results occur in the setting of primaries with 1-2+ expression.  
Design: This is a cohort study on both tissue microarray (TMA) breast cancer samples and a retrospective search for all HER2 not 
over-expressed/FISH negative metastatic breast carcinomas. A total number of 50 patients with case-matched primary and 
metastatic sites were included. 
Results: 40% of primary vs 58% of metastatic samples were IHC 0 (vs 1-2+/ISH-).  Overall, 38% of case-matched primary vs 
metastatic breast cancer samples had a change in HER2 IHC expression between the IHC 0 and 1-2+ categories.  Primary IHC 1-
2+ cancers with matched metastatic IHC 0 results occurred in 28% of cases. Primary IHC 0 results with matched metastatic IHC 1-
2+ results occurred in 10% of cases.    An IHC 0 primary remained IHC 0 in the metastatic sample in 30% of cases. Importantly, 
when a metastatic sample tested IHC 0, 48% of the time it was 1-2+ in the prior matched primary sample.  In contrast, when a 
primary tested IHC 0, only 26% of the time did it become 1-2+ in the metastatic site (74% remained IHC 0). Metastatic samples 
may not always follow the pre-analytic tissue handling requirements that primary breast samples do, which may contribute to the 
greater probability of an IHC 0 result in a metastatic site when the breast primary tested 1+-2+/ISH- (vs heterogeneity).  
Conclusions: HER2 non-amplified cancers have inconsistent IHC 0 vs 1-2+ results in primary vs metastatic samples with 
metastatic samples more often testing IHC 0.  These results suggest that low levels of HER2 expression are not reliably tested by 
IHC across sample types (or are heterogeneous) and raise concern about using metastatic sample IHC 0 results for T-DXd 
access.  
 
202   Upregulated mRNA Expression and Protein Overexpression of Alpha-Methylacyl-CoA 
Racemase (AMACR) in Breast Carcinoma with Apocrine Differentiation are Associated with 
Peroxisomal β-oxidation 
Harumi Nakamura, Osaka International Cancer Institute, Osaka, Osaka, Japan 
Disclosures: Harumi Nakamura: None 
Background: We reported at USCAP in 2022 that most breast carcinomas with apocrine differentiation (AC) are positive for anti-
alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) antibodies; AMACR gene expression was significantly higher in carcinomas with 
apocrine differentiation than in non-AC (p<0.001). AMACR is localized in peroxisomes and mitochondria and is involved in β-
oxidation. Here, we conducted an immunohistochemical investigation of the peroxisomal and mitochondrial enzymes involved in β-
oxidation and associated fatty acid metabolism. 
Design: We used surgically obtained formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens from 35 cases of AC, 21 cases of ER+/HER2- 
carcinoma, 12 cases of ER+/HER2+ carcinoma, 19 cases of ER-/HER2+ carcinoma, and 8 cases of triple negative breast 
carcinoma (TNBC). Immunohistochemical staining was performed for the following:  acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), acyl-CoA 
oxidase 2 (ACOX2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), catalase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short chain 
(ACADS), cytochrome c, long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and CD36. Those with 
significantly more intense staining than normal adipose tissue and mammary gland tissue were deemed positive (i.e., 
overexpression). 
Results: The results of immunohistochemical staining are summarized in Table 1 (where there were untested specimens, the 
actual number of specimens was recorded as the denominator). The positive (overexpression) rates of ACOX1, 
catalase, ACSL1, and FASN were significantly higher in ACs than in non-ACs (p<0.001). In contrast, the expression of ACOX2, 
ACADS, cytochrome c, and CD36 did not significantly change in AC.

Background: Accurate HER2 status based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) is required to select patients for existing and newly 
developed HER2-targeting treatments. Patients with HER2 gene-amplified and/or HER2 IHC overexpressing breast carcinomas 
(BCs) are eligible for treatment with anti-HER2 drugs as trastuzumab. Recently, BC patients with HER2 low expression (IHC 1+ or 
2+ without HER2 gene amplification) may be offered new anti-HER2 antibody-drug-conjugates as trastuzumab deruxtecan. Since 
patient stratification for anti-HER2 drugs primarily is based on IHC, our goal is to compare the analytical accuracy of HER2 
overexpression and concordance rate for HER2 low expression in BC amongst four different HER2 IHC assays. 
Design: 98 human formalin fixed paraffin embedded resection BC specimens from five microarrays were analyzed by four different 
IHC assays: (1) HercepTest SK001, Agilent, (2) HercepTest GE001 , Agilent, (3) PATHWAY 4B5, Roche and (4) HER2 EP3, 
Sakura Finetek. The gene amplification status for all specimens were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
analysis. IHC results were evaluated by three reviewers and a consensus result was obtained for each specimen analyzed. IHC 
and FISH results were scored accordingly to the 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines.   
Results: A total of 33 BC specimens exhibited HER2 amplification by FISH. A higher positive predictive value to FISH analysis of 
94% was observed for HercepTest GE001, PATHWAY 4B5 and HER2 EP3 when compared to HercepTest SK001 (91%). All four 
IHC assays resulted in a negative predictive value to FISH of 100%.  21% of the non-amplified BCs were categorized as HER2 low 
expression by HercepTest GE001 and HER2 EP3 compared to 19% and 14% for HercepTest SK001 and PATHWAY 4B5, 
respectively.    
Conclusions: This was to our knowledge, the first study to evaluate the inter-assay performance of two well-established HER2 
IHC assays (HercepTest SK001 and PATHWAY 4B5) with two relatively new IHC assays (HercepTest GE001 and HER2 EP3).  A 
high accuracy and concordance for HER2 overexpression was obtained by the four different IHC assays; however, HercepTest 
SK001 exhibited 3% more false negative results. A reduced concordance was seen for HER2 low expression BCs amongst the 
different assays; therefore, future comparative studies with an enriched number of HER2 low and HER2 negative BCs must be 
performed to evaluate the concordance rate for HER2 low expression in BC amongst these IHC assays.

Background: Immunohistochemical characterization of breast cancers with biomarkers including Ki67 are required for 
contemporary oncologic care. Manual estimation of Ki67 expression in breast cancer is unappealing for Pathologists. Automated 
methods minimize variability and time spent with manual estimation with the hypothesis that correlation between a manual estimate 
and automated count is acceptable. 
Design: Breast cancer cases diagnosed between March, 2020 and August, 2021 were retrospectively reviewed and random 
selection of 40 biopsy cases was done. The H&E and Ki67 slides of the selected cases were retrieved from the archives. Images of 
the Ki67 slides were taken with Olympus camera (U-TV0.63XC). The score was estimated by two residents and subsequently, a 
scoring application (QuPath, 0.2.3) was used on the same images. Manual estimation was calculated as the average of the scores 
from the two residents.  The QuPath application settings were made to minimize interference of tumor Ki67 staining estimation by 
stromal and inflammatory cell Ki67 staining. This was done by selecting the hotspot of tumor cell staining and irregular polygon 
annotation of hotspots. Manual method estimation was performed prior to automated count for all cases. Correlation of tumor 
grades as well as manual and automated scoring systems was performed (Linear regression analysis, Excel 2016). 
Results: Forty cases were reviewed for the study. About 70% of the breast cancer cases studied were invasive ductal carcinoma 
(70%) followed by Invasive lobular carcinoma (19%). Majority of the cases (37.5%) were grade 1 carcinomas. There was a good 
level of correlation between the manual methods of Ki67 estimation compared to the automated method with a R2 of 0.86 (Fig. 1). 
Grade 1 and 2 tumors were found to have a higher level of correlation (R2 of 0.88 and 0.84 respectively) compared to grade 3 
tumors with a R2 of 0.69 (Fig. 2). 
Figure 1 – 204 
 
 
Figure 2 – 204 
 
 
Conclusions: Automated methods such as QuPath are helpful in reducing the intra and inter-observer variability in Ki67 scoring. 
We noticed a higher correlation in cases that had lower Ki67 scores than those with higher scores. Line plots of correlation show a 
slope less than 1 for all tumor classifications. This indicates that Ki67 was over-estimated with manual method compared with the 
automated method even when an average count was taken between two observers.

Background: Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is characterized by a dis-cohesive growth pattern, mainly due to bi-
allelic CDH1 inactivation, present in up to 80% of ILCs. Bi-allelic CDH1 alterations, however, are vanishingly rare in other histologic 
types of breast cancer (BC). Although ILCs show inferior response rates to chemotherapy and SERMs relative to other BC 
subtypes, the high inter-observer variability in ILC diagnosis, precludes its incorporation in therapeutic decisions. Artificial 
intelligence (AI)-based models have the potential to improve pathologic diagnoses. Histologic diagnoses, however, which might be 
confounded by human subjectivity, are often used as ground truth (GT) for training. We sought to develop an AI-based algorithm for 
detection of ILC using CDH1 biallelic mutations as GT. 
Design: We developed an AI-based model to detect CDH1 biallelic mutations (i.e., inactivating mutation and loss of heterozygosity 
(LOH) of the wild-type allele, or two inactivating mutations), using diagnostic whole slide images (WSI) from 1057 primary BCs with 
available MSK-IMPACT targeted sequencing data. The model was developed using a 10-fold cross validation system. CDH1 gene 
promoter methylation assessment was conducted in a subset of cases using digital droplet PCR. 
Results: The AI-based algorithm trained utilizing CDH1 bi-allelic mutations as the GT predicted the presence of CDH1 ‘bi-allelic 
mutations’ with an AUC of 0.966, accuracy of 0.95, positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.77 and negative predictive value (NPV) of 
0.98. Re-analyses of the misclassified cases revealed that most (74%; 25/34) false positives (FPs) harbored CDH1 inactivation 
through different mechanisms, including promoter methylation (n=21), homozygous deletion (n=3) or intragenic deletion with LOH 
(n=1). The performance of the algorithm for detection of a ‘lobular phenotype’ (i.e., ILC (classic or variant) or mixed lobular and 
ductal BC) regardless of CDH1 status had an AUC of 0.974, accuracy of 0.94, PPV of 0.97 and NPV of 0.93. Most (66%) cases 
with a ‘lobular phenotype’ not detected by the algorithm were mixed ductal and lobular BCs (n=33; 53%) or ILC variants (n=8; 
13%), whereas only a subset of them (n=21; 34%) were classic ILCs. 
Conclusions: An AI algorithm trained to detect ‘CDH1 biallelic mutations’ as GT, instead of labels based on histologic diagnosis of 
ILC can detect ILC robustly. These findings represent a paradigm shift for the use of orthogonal GT in the development of AI-based 
cancer classification systems.

Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is extremely rare, accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancers and 0.5% of all 
cancers in males. Current treatment for MBC is based on protocols and research on female breast cancer. Pathogenic variants in 
cancer-predisposing genes are a likely etiology in 4% to 40% of MBC cases, and it is currently advised that all MBC patients be 
offered genetic counseling.  The goal of this project was to characterize the genomic landscape of this rare cancer via whole-
genome sequencing (WGS).

Design: We performed WGS on matched tumor/normal tissues from 10 localized invasive ductal MBCs. By IHC these were 10 ER-
positive, 8 PR-positive, and 10 HER2-negative, i.e., 80% luminal A-like, 20% luminal B-like, and 0% basal-like cases. The median 
age at diagnosis was 77 years of age. 
Results: Table 1 summarizes the histopathologic characteristics of the ten patients with identified targets/biomarkers and 
associated treatments. The ten cases were found to have an average tumor mutational burden (TMB) of 4.97/Mb, Coding TMB 
11.70/Mb, structural variant counts (SVs) 87, and 55% tumor purity. Seven of the ten cases were found to have at least one 
molecular target. Four cases harbored FGFR1 amplification and another set of five cases were identified to have high TMB.  One 
case was identified to have borderline ERBB2 amplification with HER2 IHC showing 1+ scoring, which may support this case to 
be classified as HER2-low (a new proposed categorization of receptor status) (Figure 1). Mutational signatures associated with 
homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) were identified in one case (Figure 2). A pathogenic BRCA2 germline mutation was 
identified in one patient.

Conclusions: Comprehensive WGS analysis has empowered us to further characterize the genomic landscape of male breast 
cancer, which appears to harbor molecular differences when compared to its female counterpart. Employing a single WGS assay 
and state-of-the-art analytic pipelines, we detected known targets, pathogenic germline mutations, high TMB, and genomic 
signatures associated with an HRD phenotype.

Background: Patients with metastatic breast carcinoma portends to a poor prognosis, especially for patients who fail first line 
therapies. Molecular sequencing has allowed us to provide additional information to guide targeted and salvage therapies. The aim 
of this study is to profile locally advanced and metastatic breast carcinomas via WGS to identify novel events that may unearth new 
biomarkers and potential targets of the disease. 
Design: WGS was performed on 48 tumor/normal DNA pairs of locally advanced and metastatic breast carcinoma from 34 patients 
including 20 local/regional/axillary lymph node metastases and 28 distant metastases. Three cases were excluded due to 
sequencing artifacts. We employed the Isabl GxT analytic platform and manually curated single base substitution (SBS) molecular 
signatures and structural variants (SV) that involved tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. 
Results: The IHC hormone receptor profile was: 22 (65%) ER positive, 16 (47%) PR positive and 5 (15%) HER2 positive. Seven 
(24%) were triple negative breast carcinomas. Histologically, 31 (91%) were ductal, 2 (6%) lobular and 1 (3%) was metaplastic 
carcinoma. Twenty-two out of 31 patients (71%) had actionable/clinically relevant alterations including SV 
impacting BRCA1, PIK3CA hotspot, FGRF1 and ERBB2 amplifications, among others (Table 1). Gene fusions 
included TBL1XR1::PIK3CA (described in a metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) and ESR1::EP300 (novel event) (Figure 
1). Interestingly, of 7 patients which tumors had strong evidence of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), i.e. excess 
tandem duplications or short, small deletions and annotation by the Classifier of HOmologous Recombination Deficiency (CHORD) 
algorithm, 6 patients did not have pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations or SVs altering these genes (Figure 2). Remarkably, 4 out of 
those 6 patients (67%) responded to chemotherapy, including 2 with complete remission and lack of pathogenic variants in HRD 
genes. In contrast, only 7 out of the 18 patients (39%) which tumors lacked HRD responded to treatment.

Conclusions: WGS of locally advanced and metastatic breast carcinoma empowered by state-of-the-art analysis 
elucidates significant molecular signatures and relevant structural variants that may provide additional biomarkers and open 
therapeutic avenues. These include patients with tumors featuring high TMB and HRD phenotype, and their potential susceptibility 
to checkpoint and poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.

Disclosures: Peter Podany: None; Reza Golestani: None; Susan Fineberg: None; Kamaljeet Singh: None; Malini Harigopal: None 
Background: Core needle biopsy (CNB) is an accurate method for detection of invasive ductal carcinoma with a high degree of 
concordance with surgical excision. CNB is used to provide valuable information that can be used in presurgical decision making. 
In this study we investigated the value of CNB in assessment of Nottingham histologic grade in comparison to final histologic grade 
assessed on excision. 
Design: All cases of breast excision for invasive ductal carcinoma between September 2020- August 2021 that had in-house 
biopsies were included in this study. All cases with preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. Nottingham histologic 
grade with total scores, tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and mitotic activity were compared between CNB and excision. 
Results: A total of 216 cases with histologic grade diagnosed on CNB were included. Rates of well-, moderately-, and poorly 
differentiated carcinomas on CNB were 27.8%, 60.2%, and 12.0%, respectively, and on excision 27.8%, 50.5%, and 21.7%, 
respectively. Changes in final grades and individual components are summarized in Figure 1A. Final total score was changed in 
37.0% of cases (28.2% upscore, 8.8% downscore) (Figure 1B). Grades were changed in 19.0% of cases (13.9% upgrade, 5.1% 
final downgrade) (Figure 2A). Tubule formation score was changed in 14.3% (5.1% increase, 9.2% decrease), nuclear score was 
changed in 12.0% (8.3% increase, 3.7% decrease), and mitosis score was changed in 26.4% of cases (24.1% increase, 2.3% 
decrease) (Figures 2B-1D). Table 1 shows the factors responsible for changes in Nottingham scores. There was no difference 
between tumor size/extent on CNB cases with grade changes (0.63 ± 0.33 cm) and without grade changes (0.63 ± 0.32 cm, p = 
0.99).

Figure 2 - 208 
 
Conclusions: Nottingham grade, diagnosed on CNB was changed in one fifth of breast excisional biopsies. Mitosis score was the 
least reliable histologic variable on CNB and its changed on final excision resulted in 47% of Nottingham score downgrades. 
Although, tubule formation score was relatively stable between CNB and excision, its changes on final excision was responsible for 
a majority of Nottingham score upgrades (51%). We propose that nuclear grade and tubule point score on CNB without mitotic 
count score will result in better concordance with surgical excision.

Background: Tumor markers estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 are key in predicting breast cancer 
(BC) outcomes and selecting appropriate treatment. Differences in ER/PR/HER2 between the primary tumor (PT) and metastatic 
site (MET) have been observed. We aimed to describe patterns of ER/PR/HER2 on PTs and corresponding METs and to assess 
the relationship between expression patterns and overall survival (OS). 
Design: Patients with BC (2011-2020) with a PT and MET from a single institution were included. Those with missing data points 
were excluded. ER/PR expression was stratified by % staining [<1% (-), 1-10% (+), or >10% (+)] on immunohistochemistry, and 
HER2 was classified as positive or negative by ASCO/CAP recommendation. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to 
compare OS based on change of receptor expression. 
Results: 440 patients were assessed: 18% had a synchronous MET and 82% a metachronous MET. Location of MET included 
20% brain, 36% bone, 20% lung, 17% liver, 5% distant lymph node, and 2% other site. Detailed tumor marker data for the PT with 
corresponding MET were available in 188 cases (Table). Patients whose PT was ER- (n=60) or PR- (n=92) commonly had a MET 
with ER- (n=53/60, 88%) or PR- (n=81/92, 88%). These ER- or PR- PTs rarely had a MET that was ER+ (n=7/60, 12%) or PR+ 
(n=11/92, 12%). In contrast, those who had PT that was ER+ (n=128) or PR+ (n=96) frequently had a MET with loss of ER 
(n=29/128, 23%) or PR (n=48/96, 50%). HER2+ PTs (n=44) had HER2- MET in 18% (8/44), while HER2- PTs (n=144) had only 9% 
HER2+ MET (13/144). There were no additional patterns noted between tumor markers expression on the PT and MET in patients 
stratified by MET site of disease. Decrease in ER expression between the PT and MET was associated with decreased OS 
(p=0.043, Figure 1). A similar trend was observed with worse OS in patients with decreased PR expression in the MET (p=0.23, 
Figure 2). Differences in HER2 expression were not associated with changes in OS (p=0.52).

Conclusions: The tumor expression of ER/PR/HER2 in patients with BC can differ between PTs and corresponding METs. Loss of 
ER/PR expression is common, and decrease in ER expression is associated with worse OS. This observation merits additional 
investigation. Re-evaluating tumor markers at the metastatic site could potentially inform prognosis and therapeutic decision-
making.

Background: Fibroepithelial lesions (FELs) of the breast are biphasic neoplasms for which the precise diagnosis entails an 
integrated evaluation of both epithelial/stromal components and this may generate issues in core needle biopsy (CNB) due to 
limited sampling. Here, we sought to establish clinical, radiological and histological parameters on CNB of indeterminate FELs that 
can predict a diagnosis of phyllodes tumors (PTs) at excision.  
Design: Consecutive cases of FELs with overlapping features between fibroadenoma (FA) and PT diagnosed on CNB from 2014-
2022 at a Cancer Center were selected and clinicopathological data were collected. Findings were correlated with subsequent 
excisions and sensitivity/specificity of the histologic parameters were calculated. 
Results: Of 148 FELs from 145 female patients, 83/56% underwent surgical excision, with a final diagnosis of FA in 52/63% cases; 
benign PT in 12/15%; borderline PT in 5/6%; other benign lesions in 4/5% women. For 10/12% tumors, a clear distinction could not 
be made at excision and the term “benign fibroepithelial neoplasm” was used. Compared to FA, PT patients had an older average 
age at diagnosis (44 yo PT vs 36 yo FA; p=0.019) and a larger tumor size (3 cm PT vs 2 cm FA; p=0.019) - Table. Additionally, PT 
cases exhibited more frequently a leaf-like pattern (41% vs 33%; p=0.56) and stromal hypercellularity (88% vs 75%; p<0.001), 
particularly moderate hypercellularity (58.8% vs 7.7%; p<0.001). Stromal overgrowth was absent in all FAs, while it was found in 
12% of PTs, all borderline. Mild/moderate stromal atypia was observed in 6% and 59% of FA/PT cases, respectively (p<0.001). No 
cases showed marked stromal hypercellularity/atypia. All lesions demonstrated a low mitotic rate, with a mean count in PTs greater 
than in FAs (p=0.004). Stromal hypercellularity on CNB was highly sensitive for the diagnosis of PT at surgical excision, whereas 
stromal atypia and mitotic activity were highly specific. In 32/39% cases, the diagnosis of FA vs PT was suggested in a note in the 
CNB report and it was concordant with the surgical diagnosis in 24. Follow-up data were obtained for 133 (90%; mean 12 mos) 
patients and 9 women developed new breast nodules. Only one was submitted to CNB, which revealed a FA.

Background: The trichorhinophalangeal syndrome 1 (TRPS1) gene is a GATA transcription factor family member that has been 
found to play a role in breast carcinogenesis. Given the dearth of highly sensitive and specific markers for triple-negative breast 
carcinomas (TNBCs), interest in TRPS1 as a potential immuohistochemical (IHC) marker for TNBCs has grown. Recent data 
suggests high expression of TRPS1 in TNBCs and low or absent expression in carcinomas of other organs including gynecologic 
(GYN) carcinomas. Our aim was to explore the performance of TRPS-1 as an IHC diagnostic marker, find the optimal conditions for 
its use within breast carcinomas with an emphasis on TNBCs and compare to carcinomas of a select few organ sites with an 
emphasis on gynecologic tumors. 
Design: Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from breast carcinomas (n=197); endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma (n=69); ovarian 
tumors (n=250); vulvar squamous cell carcinomas (n=96); pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (n=20); gastric adenocarcinoma 
(n=12) were stained with TRPS-1 using different conditions. Breast carcinomas consisted of hormone receptor positive 
(HR+)/HER2-negative (n=53); HR+/HER2-positive (n=6) and TNBCs (n=138). Ovarian tumors consisted of endometrioid (n=5); 
high grade serous (n=55), low grade serous (n=24), clear cell (n=25) carcinomas, serous borderline tumors (n=135) and carcinoma 
NOS (n=3). After trying >30 different staining conditions, two staining protocols (with intense reactivity in breast cancers, minimal 
reactivity in endometrium with no background staining) were chosen for staining (see table 1). 
Results: A total of 644 tumors were tested for TRPS1 using two selected protocols (table 1). In our cohort, comparing TRPS1 
result in breast carcinomas versus tumors from other tested organ sites, the sensitivity of TRPS1 was 89.13% and 84.74% while 
the specificity was 64.82% and 72.77% for protocol 1 and 2, respectively. For TNBCs versus GYN tumors, the sensitivity of TRPS1 
was 91.37% and 86.8% while the specificity was 62.75% and 71.81% for protocols 1 and 2, respectively.

Conclusions: Under the conditions used, TRPS-1 stains 85-100% of breast carcinomas but also up to 71% of gynecological 
carcinomas, albeit with a weaker median expression (figure 1). Our data shows that while TRPS1 is a highly sensitive marker for 
TNBCs, it is not as highly specific as previously reported. Our protocol #1 had the maximum sensitivity with minimal compromise of 
the specificity and is currently approved for clinical use at our institution.

Background: Secretory breast carcinoma is an uncommon subset of breast cancer that usually has a favorable outcome. Although 
initially described in children, it also occurs in adults where it may metastasize, possibly resulting in death.  
Design: The clinicopathological data and prognostic information of 23 patients with secretory breast cancer diagnosed by the 
Department of Pathology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from 2014 to 2022 were collected, and their clinical 
characteristics, histological structure, immunophenotype and molecular characteristics were analyzed. 
Results: There were 21 female patients and 2 male patients, ranging from 12 to 63 years old, with a median age of 43 years. 9 
cases in left breast and 14 cases in right breast. The clinical manifestations were mainly painless breast masses. Generally, most 
of them were relatively well-defined nodules, gray and hard. Microscopically, the tumor cells were mainly arranged in 
microcystis and tubular, and a few were in solid nest and papillary structures. The cytoplasm of tumor cells was eosinophilic 
granules or foam like. Introcytoplasmic and extracellular eosinophilic or amphophilic secretions were consistently present. Most 
cases are accompanied by sclerotic stroma. An in situ component often present. Immunohistochemically, 23 cases showed S100 
and pan-TRK diffuse strong positive, 14 cases showed ER, PR and HER2 triple negative expression, 9 cases showed a small 
amount or weak positive ER, and Ki67 proliferation index was 3%-30%. FISH detection in 6 cases showed that NTRK3 gene was 
broken. Treatment and prognosis: 23 patients received surgical treatment, 14 of them received postoperative adjuvant 
chemotherapy. all 23 patients were followed up for 2-96 months, and 1 patient had pulmonary metastasis after 1 year. all 23 
patients survived. 
 
  
 
S203 
Figure 1 - 212 
 
Conclusions: Secretory breast carcinoma is a rare invasive carcinoma, most of which show indolent biological behavior, but a few 
cases can also have lymph node and distant metastasis. The cases with solid structure, increased mitotic figures, necrosis and 
high proliferative activity in histology may indicate a higher tendency of recurrence or metastasis. The application of specific 
immunological marker pan-TRK and FISH detection of NTRK gene can assist in the diagnosis of secretory breast carcinoma. With 
the popularization and application of NTRK inhibitors, new treatment options will be provided for patients with recurrent or 
metastatic secretory breast carcinoma.

Background: The detection of metastases to lymph nodes constitutes an essential task in breast cancer staging, which is done by 
pathologists worldwide. However, this is tedious and time-consuming, and the sensitivity of pathologists at this task is suboptimal. 
The literature shows that pathology review by experts results in a change of nodal status in up to 24% of patients. The literature 
also shows that artificial intelligence (AI) tools can help pathologists in detecting breast cancer metastases to lymph nodes, which 
could potentially improve their diagnostic accuracy and alleviate workload issues. We set out to study how the diagnostic 
performance of pathologists varied when they were aided by a tumor detection AI tool. 
Design: An AI algorithm was trained using multiple instances learning, a weakly supervised deep learning approach whereby the 
digitized glass slide image (known as whole slide image or WSI) is paired with its corresponding pathology report. More than 
32,000 breast sentinel lymph node WSIs from more than 8,000 patients were used to train this algorithm, which is designed to 
highlight areas suspicious to harbor metastasis in digitized WSIs of lymph node tissue. Three pathologists were asked to review a 
challenging dataset comprising 167 breast sentinel lymph node WSIs, of which 69 harbored cancer metastases of different sizes, 
enriched for challenging cases. Ninety eight slides were benign. The pathologists read the dataset twice, both digitally without AI 
assistance and with AI assistance, staggered to control for reading order bias, after a three week washout period. They were asked 
to record their slide level diagnosis, and were timed during their reads.  
Results: The average sensitivity of the pathologists during the unassisted phase in this challenging dataset was 81% which 
improved to 93% during the assisted phase. Specificity was non-inferior during the assisted phase, and remained at 98%. The 
average reading time was 131 seconds per slide during the unassisted phase compared with 58 seconds per slide during the aided 
 
  
 
S204 
phase, resulting in an overall efficiency gain of 55% when the pathologists were assisted by AI. These shorter reading times 
applied to both benign and malignant WSIs regardless of metastasis size.  
Conclusions: This study highlights how AI can help pathologists improve their diagnostic performance, as measured by sensitivity 
improvements to detect metastases of any size. In addition, AI helped pathologists reduce their reading times by more than half.

Background: Cell cycle control is tightly coordinated by Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family activities, which are frequently 
deregulated in cancer.  The CDK4/6 action is targeted by compounds that are FDA-approved in the context of HR+/HER2- breast 
cancer, while a number of CDK2 inhibitors are in the early-stage clinical development.  Here, we sought to define means to identify 
tumors with specific configurations of CDK and Cyclin proteins expression using multispectral profiling to define precision 
approaches for these inhibitors. 
Design: A combination of gene perturbation and biochemical approaches were used to define requirement for different CDK and 
Cyclins in driving cancer cell cycles. These dependencies were linked to specific alterations in the expression of select Cyclin and 
CDK genes. Multispectral immunofluorescence panels were applied to >500 clinical cases to define protein markers associated 
with sensitivity to CDK4/6 or CDK2 inhibitors. Cell cycle states in breast cancer were compared to those in genitourinary, and 
gynecological malignancy tissue microarrays.   Results were benchmarked against xenograft models of known sensitivity to these 
agents.  
Results: The differential requirements for specific CDK or Cyclins associated with tumor origin and genetic alterations, revealing 
substantial heterogeneity within and between different tumor types. This variability in cell cycle dependences can be predicted in 
clinical specimens by analyses of multispectral immunofluorescence expression data.  Unbiased statistical analyses indicated 
specific protein configurations that are associated with sensitivity to CDK4/6 vs. CDK2 inhibitors. Benchmark experiments using 
xenograft models of known resistance and sensitivity profiles supported specific marker configurations associated with 
pharmaceutical sensitivities. 
Conclusions:  The cell cycle states define sensitivity to FDA-approved CDK4/6 inhibitors as well as the emerging CDK2 inhibitors 
and could provide precision medicine approach to treatment.

Background: TRPS1 is a GATA family transcription factor and recent work has demonstrated the utility of TRPS1 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the clinicopathologic evaluation of breast carcinoma. TRPS1 has been shown to be a highly 
sensitive marker for triple-negative breast carcinoma, including tumors which do not express immunohistochemical markers GATA3 
and SOX10. Such high-grade lesions may be an underlying carcinoma in mammary Paget disease (PD), with >95% of PD 
patients harboring a concurrent high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma. Histologic mimics of PD, 
including Toker cell hyperplasia and Bowen disease, and the immunohistochemical overlap of these entities, can represent a 
diagnostic challenge.  
Design: Cases of mammary PD and mimics were stained with TRPS1, including 24 cases of PD (9 ER-HER2+, 5 ER+HER2-, 
5 ER+HER2+ and 5 ER-HER2-), 5 cases of Toker cells/Toker cell hyperplasia, and 1 case of Bowen disease. Additionally, TRPS1 
and GATA3 IHC was performed on 15 cases of extramammary PD (5 perianal, 5 vulvar and 5 scrotal) to explore any potential 
immunohistochemical differences from mammary PD. 
Results: TRPS1 consistently demonstrated strong (22/24) to moderate (2/24) nuclear staining of Paget cells in mammary PD 
cases from all four ER/HER2 expression profiles. Moreover, TRPS1 IHC demonstrated improved differential staining of Paget cells 
from surrounding keratinocytes, with minimal to absent staining of background epidermis compared to GATA3. For extramammary 
PD, a similarly positive staining pattern was demonstrated in scrotal (5/5) and vulvar (5/5) cases. Interestingly, however, 
 
  
 
S205 
PD cases from perianal skin demonstrated faint (3/5) to no (2/5) nuclear expression of TRPS1. Lastly, TRPS1 also positively 
highlighted Toker cells of nipple skin (5/5), while Bowen disease was negative. 
Conclusions: These data suggest a potential use of TRPS1 immunohistochemistry, combined with ER and HER2, in the 
evaluation of mammary PD. Paget (and Toker) cells are more easily distinguished from keratinocytes using TRPS1 compared to 
GATA3. Though beyond the scope of this study, these data also suggest a molecular divergence in the pathogenesis of 
extramammary Paget disease arising in genital versus perianal skin. 
 
216   End-to-End Deep Neural Network for Ki-67 Stained WSI Automatic Hotspot Detection and

Background: The advent of digitalisation of immunostained slides and recent progress in artificial intelligence emphasised the 
development of computer-assisted quantification, assessment and analysis of whole-slide images (WSI). In this paper, we shed 
light on the nuclear protein Ki-67 assessment, which is one of the main prognostic factors for tumor progression and treatment in 
breast cancer. The main objective is to propose an end-to-end pipeline based on a deep neural network for the hotspot detection 
on Ki-67 stained WSI as well as proliferation rate quantification. 
Design: We developed a supervised deep neural network on histopathology annotated squared images (tiles) of size 256 pixels of 
the publicly available dataset SHIDC-BC-Ki-67, which consists of 2356 images from 23 patients, labelled by expert pathologists. 
For each tile, cell annotations were available in three different classes of immunopositive, immunonegative, and tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes. A U-Net architecture with an adequate backbone network is investigated and trained and validated on 1656 tiles. 
Testing was carried on a left-out set of size 701 of the same database originating from 23 patients. The performance of the model 
is investigated and compared to the original PathoNet architecture, among others. 
Results: Ki-67 PI prediction was evaluated using the root mean squared errors (RMSE) at the tile and patient level. Our 
pipeline has an RMSE of 0.035 at the patient level, which outperforms the benchmark, on the same data split, that has an RMSE of 
0.048. The model also outperforms other state of the art frameworks. The hotspots are implicitly and accurately inferred on the 
basis of outcomes of this prediction. Regarding the classification of the patients with respect to the cut-off thresholds: 16% and 
30%, the accuracy is 95.96% over 23 patients on the left-out set SHIDC-BC-Ki-67 database. Finally, the pipeline is challenged 
using an external dataset of 65 cases, which were independently screened by experienced pathologists, with the same 
performance. 
Conclusions: Development of artificial intelligence models for WSI treatment is generally task-specific and is based on casting 
possibly complex processing pipelines. Thus, unlike most of the available algorithms, the proposed end-to-end approach identifies 
the hotspot and quantifies the PI, on a single end-to-end step with promising performance. The model can be easily generalized to 
other prognostic and/or nuclear biomarkers in a quick and straightforward manner.

Background: The diagnosis of atypia in the breast is subject to inter and intraobserver variability. In addition, this diagnosis is 
impacted by other factors such as clinical and radiological findings, type and quality of the biopsy sampling, and lesion 
characteristic, among others. 
Design: To evaluate diagnostic variability within our team of 7 breast pathologists, we performed a search of our system to identify 
lesions with the undetermined/borderline diagnoses of "atypical intraductal proliferation" and "atypical glandular proliferation" on 
CNB between 2010 and 2021. Slides were reviewed independently and blindly to the original interpretation and available follow-up. 
 
  
 
S206 
Clinical and radiological information was provided at the time of review. Interobserver variability was evaluated using Fleiss multi-
rater kappa analysis and possible associations underwent Chi-square testing. 
Results: Forty cases with available slides for review were included. Relevant follow-up data were collected. In 62.5% of cases 
(25/40) a follow-up diagnosis of atypia or carcinoma was made upon excision. Of these, 52% of cases (13/25) had overt invasive or 
in-situ carcinoma (upgraded group) and 48% (12/25) were diagnosed with atypical lesions (no change/atypical group). In 27.5% of 
cases (11/40) an atypical or malignant lesion was not present on follow-up (downgraded group). Four cases (10%) did not undergo 
excision. A statistically significant agreement of 0.866 (p<0.001) on calling a lesion atypical on CNB was found. Interobserver 
agreement for the diagnosis of atypia on CNB was 0.93 (p=0.42) for the upgraded group, 0.86 (p<0.001) for the no change/atypical 
group, and 0.79 (p<0.001) for the downgraded group. The most cited reasons for being unable to make a definitive diagnosis on 
CNB included: 1) limited focus, 2) borderline features, 3) apocrine features, however none were statistically significant when Chi-
square was applied.

Figure 2 - 217 
 
Conclusions: During this retrospective study, we evaluated our experience with atypical and borderline breast lesions diagnosed 
on core needle biopsy in correlation with surgical or clinical follow-up and we statistically measured the interobserver variability 
where a significant interrater agreement (p<0.001) was observed.  The seeming lack of definitive associations with the definition of 
atypicality calls for consensus agreement which showed very good kappa measurement in our study.

Background: Salivary gland-type neoplasms of the breast are uncommon and are comprised of a collection of entities with distinct 
biology and clinical behavior, sharing analogies to salivary glands carcinomas. Most of these tumors are triple-negative breast 
carcinoma (TNBC) with a low risk of metastasis. While GATA3 is the most widely used breast marker, its utility is limited in 
diagnosing TNBC. In this study, we have investigated the expression of a new breast marker, TRPS1, in the subset of salivary 
gland-type tumor of breast and head & neck (H&N) and compared its utility to GATA3. 
Design: We collected 37 breast cases (28 adenoid cystic carcinoma [AdCC], 7 secretory carcinoma [SC], 2 acinic cell carcinoma 
[ACC] and 24 H&N cases (16 AdCC, 2 SC, and 4 ACC) between 2015-2022. Immunohistochemical staining for TRPS1 and GATA3 
were performed. Only nuclear staining was considered as positive. The immunoreactivity scores were calculated semi-quantitively 
and categorized as negative (<1%), low positive (1-10%), intermediate positive (11-50%), and high positive (>50%). 
Results: In the breast AdCC, TRPS1 was positive in 100% of solid type, and mixed cribriform and solid type, but only positive in 
50% of cribriform type; conversely, GATA3 was negative in majority of all types of breast AdCC. In the H&N AdCC, TRPS1 was 
positive in 100% of solid, 67% of mixed, and only 30% of cribriform type; GATA3 was also predominately negative in these tumors. 
 
  
 
S207 
Both TRPS1 and GATA3 were positive in 100% of secretory carcinomas of breast and H&N, while both TRPS1 and GATA3 were 
negative in all breast ACC and majority of ACC of H&N (75%). (Figure 1) 
Figure 1 - 218 
 
Conclusions:  
• TRPS1 exhibited high expression in AdCC with solid component (solid and mixed types) of both breast and H&N, while 
GATA3 was predominantly negative or weak positive in all AdCCs.  
• TRPS1 & GATA3 showed similar pattern in SC and ACC of both breast and H&N. 
• TRPS1 does not differentiate breast salivary gland-type tumor from H&N counterparts, which may provide evidence of 
genetic analogies between these entities.

Disclosures: Alireza Salem: None; Yun Wu: None; Qingqing Ding: None; Lavinia Middleton: None 
Background: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) of the breast is a rare subtype of TNBC, characterized by proliferation of two cell 
types: luminal and myoepithelial with either a cribriform or solid growth pattern. Most AdCCs harbor a characteristic chromosomal 
translocation resulting in an MYB::NFIB fusion gene and the overexpression of MYB. NOTCH1 mutations are found in 
approximately 14% of patients with salivary gland AdCC and patients harboring NOTCH1 mutations have shorter relapse free and 
overall survival. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of NOTCH1 pathway on the clinical behavior of patients with 
primary breast AdCC by examining NOTCH1 immunoreactivity. 
Design: We reviewed 24 cases of breast AdCC in patients diagnosed at a single institution from 2015-2022.  Immunohistochemical 
staining for NOTCH1 was performed. Only nuclear expression of NOTCH-1 considered as positive. Results were assessed on a 
four-tier scale: negative indicated no staining (<1%), low positive (<20%), intermediate positive (20-50%), and high positive (>50%). 
Clinical features were reviewed. Follow-up data was available in all 24 patients and median follow-up was 23 months (range 1-127 
mo). 
Results: In 70% (7 of 10) of patients with metastasis or recurrences NOTCH1 showed 20% or more nuclear expression 
(intermediate and high positive) and in 30% (3 of 10) NOTCH1 was negative. In patients without metastasis /recurrence NOTCH1 
was negative in 21.5% (3 of 14), low positive in 57% (8 of 14), and intermediate positive in only in 21.5% (3 of 14). These results 
show overexpression of NOTCH1 ≥ 20% in AdCCs is associated with aggressive clinical features. Fisher exact test 0.0351, p 
<0.05. MYB expression was documented in 12 cases. In 50% of which, NOTCH1 was expressed more than 20% (intermediate or 
high positive) and in the remaining 50 % NOTCH1 was either negative or low positive (<20%). NOTCH1 was predominantly 
expressed in tumor cells with reticular and cribriform growth patterns.

Conclusions:   
• Our study demonstrates that in patients with breast AdCC, overexpression of NOTCH ≥ 20% is associated with aggressive 
clinical outcomes. 
• NOTCH1 inhibitor may have potential therapeutic effect in patients with breast AdCC, by inhibiting cancer cell growth in 
recurrence and metastasis.

Background: In spite of widespread use and known mechanism of action, predictive biomarkers for the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors 
(CDK4/6i) in conjunction with endocrine therapy have yet to emerge. Here a cohort of patients treated with standard-of-care 
combination regimens was utilized to explore features of disease and determinants of progression-free survival (PFS). 
Design: In this cohort of 235 patients, >90% of patients were treated with Palbociclib in combination with either an aromatase 
inhibitor (AI) or fulvestrant (FUL). The PFS mirrored that observed in randomized clinical trials. A total of 151 patient tumor tissues 
were used for targeted gene expression analyses with the HTG-Oncology Biomarker Panel. The association of disease state and 
gene expression analyses were interrogated for disease evolution and association with PFS using Cox PH regression. 
Results: HER2 immunohistochemistry (0, 1+, 2+) was not associated with PFS in full cohort, or AI and FUL subgroup analyses. 
The lack of progesterone receptor was associated with shorter PFS in the full patient cohort (p=0.012) and selectively in patients 
treated with AI (p=0.005), but not FUL. Gene expression-based subtyping indicated that the majority of patients had luminal breast 
cancer; the predominant subtypes changed with treatment and disease evolution. Primary tissue from tumor resection was 
dominated by luminal A subtype, which diminished with metastatic disease, and was rare in post progression. The luminal B, 
HER2, and basal subtypes exhibited shorter PFS in CDK4/6i combinations (AI, p=0.01; FUL, p=0.03). Existing clinically developed 
breast cancer signatures (e.g. breast cancer index) had variable associations with PFS; however high expression of gene 
signatures associated with cell cycle were broadly associated with short PFS. Concordantly, utilizing unbiased analyses, gene 
expression programs linked to cell cycle were associated with short PFS, while interferon response processes were associated with 
longer PFS. Algorithms that incorporated standard pathological and clinical variables with the gene expression data were 
developed that exhibited potent predictive power. 
Conclusions: Tumor evolution occurs on treatment with CDK4/6i; however, analyses of pretreatment biopsies can inform the 
duration of PFS. These data support discrete biological processes associated with sensitivity/resistance. Predictive algorithms 
could be developed to inform features of treatment decision which will require prospective validation which is ongoing.

cancer (BC). While it is known that BC arising in the context of CHEK2 mutation are estrogen receptor (ER) and/or HER2 positive, 
the clinical and genetic features of these BC are lacking. 
Design: A cohort of 64 patients with heterozygous high-risk germline CHEK2 alterations that underwent breast sampling was 
assembled. All pathology slides were reviewed. Clinicopathologic and outcome data were retrieved. Targeted next generation DNA 
sequencing (NGS) was performed on a subset (21 BC, 18 patients) with an assay targeting 529 cancer genes. 
Results: Of 64 patients, 36 (56%) had invasive BC. Median age at diagnosis was 45 years (range 25-71). Mean tumor size was 
1.5 cm (range <0.1 to 9.4). Lymph node metastases were present in 31% (10/32). Most BC were invasive ductal carcinomas (81%, 
29/36) and grade 2 (61%, 22/36) or 3 (19%, 7/36). Nearly all tumors (92%, 33/36) were ER+, and 28% (10/36) were HER2+ (8 
ER+, 2 ER-). Mammaprint scores (MP) were equally high (50%) and low (50%) risk (n=12). 21-gene recurrence scores (RS) were 
low (<17) in 50%, intermediate (18-30) in 33%, and high (>30) in 17% (n=12). Of 13 patients treated with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, 31% had pathologic complete response, with 15% RCB-I, 46% RCB-II and 8% RCB-III. One patient (3%, 1/33) had 
 
  
 
S209 
disease progression, with overall event free survival rate of 93% (mean follow up 3.4 years, range 0.4-13.9). There were no 
differences in clinical or pathologic data between HER2- and HER2+ groups, aside from higher Ki-67 (>25%) in the HER2+ group 
(p=.01). By NGS, 57% (12/21) BC had biallelic CHEK2 inactivation, due to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the germline allele in 
92% (11/12). One patient with multifocal BC had a somatic CHEK2 mutation as a second hit in 1 tumor. Three patients also had 
germline mutations in other BC risk genes (ATM, PALB2, RAD50), 2 with CHEK2 LOH and 1 also with ATM LOH. Most CHEK2 BC 
had a luminal genetic profile with aberrations in GATA3 (24%,), PIK3CA (24%), CCND1 (24%), and FGFR1 (19%). TP53 alteration 
was infrequent (10%). 
Conclusions: Most BC arising in high-risk CHEK2 carriers are ER positive and were clinicopathologically heterogeneous in our 
cohort. In addition to a luminal genetic profile, most BC had biallelic CHEK2 inactivation, supporting CHEK2 as a dominant 
oncogenic driver. No differences were identified between HER2+ and HER2- BC, but larger studies with longer follow-up are 
required.

Background: The emergence of HER2 antibody-drug conjugates provides new treatment decisions for breast cancer patients, 
especially those with low HER2 expression. In order to explore the biological characteristics of breast cancer with low HER2 
expression, the HER2-Low category in primary breast cancer and residual tumor after neoadjuvant therapy was investigated to 
reflect the evolution of HER2 expression. Comparing the clinicopathological features of HER2-low and negative breast cancer. 
Design: HER2 was assessed according to the latest ASCO/CAP guidelines. The cut-off value for staining of HER2-positive cells 
was >10%. HER2-negative cases were divided into HER2 low expression (IHC=1+/2+ and no ISH amplification) and HER2-0 (IHC-
0), and the clinicopathological characteristics of the cases were collected. 
Results: This study included 1140 patients with invasive breast cancer who received preoperative neoadjuvant therapy from 2018 
to 2021, of which 365 patients achieved pCR and 775 were non-pCR. In the non-pCR cohort, HER2-Low cases accounted for 
59.61% of primary tumors and 55.36% of residual tumors. Among HER2-negative cases, HR-positive tumors had a higher 
incidence of low HER2 expression compared with triple-negative tumors (80.27% vs 60.00% in primary tumors and 72.68% vs 
50.77% in residual tumors). The inconsistency rate of HER2 expression was 21.42%, mainly manifested as the conversion of 
HER2-Low cases to HER2-0 (10.19%) and the conversion of HER2-0 to HER2-Low (6.45%) (Fig.1). Among the HER2-negative 
cases in the primary tumor, the HER2 discordance rate of HR-positive cases was lower than that of triple-negative cases (23.34% 
VS 36.92%) (Fig.2). This difference was mainly caused by the case switching from HER2-Low to HER2-0. Compared with HER2 0 
cases, there were statistically significant differences in RCB grade, MP grade and the number of metastatic lymph nodes in HER2 
low expression cases. Patients with low HER2 expression had a lower pathological response rate and a higher number of 
metastatic lymph nodes. 
Figure 1 - 222 
 
Figure 2 - 222 
 
Conclusions: Low expression of HER2 is highly unstable during disease evolution and has certain biological characteristics. Re-
detection of HER2 in breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy may lead to new treatment opportunities for a certain proportion of 
patients.

Background: Although chemotherapy is the most effective treatment for breast cancer (BC), some patients are chemoresistant. 
Elimination of chemotherapy resistance would improve the overall survival for BC patients. This study aims to screen essential 
chemoresistant factors, clarify the corresponding mechanism, and ultimately try to reverse this process. 
Design: Samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and West China Hospital were used to screen and validate 
chemoresistant candidate genes. MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells were mainly used to conduct gain-of or loss-of function 
studies. RNA-seq was used to screen the underlying mechanism. Interactions among DNAJC12, HSP70 and AKT were explored 
by coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay. Mouse xenograft models were generated to validate the molecular mechanism in vivo. 
Results: DNAJC12 expression was closely correlated with the response to taxane and anthracycline-based neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy in GEO datasets and our clinical cases, which was confirmed to be anthracycline. Doxorubicin (DOX, a typical 
anthracycline) could induce cell death via ferroptosis, which could be inhibited by ferroptosis inhibitors. DNAJC12 inhibited both 
DOX-induced ferroptosis and apoptosis, and the combined apoptosis and ferroptosis inhibitors entirely reversed this DOX 
resistance. RNA-seq enrichment revealed that overexpression of DNAJC12 activated the PI3K-AKT pathway. An AKT inhibitor 
reversed DNAJC12-induced DOX resistance by restoring DOX-induced apoptosis and ferroptosis. Furthermore, we confirmed that 
DNAJC12 increased AKT phosphorylation in an HSP70-dependent manner. HSP70 inhibition could also relieve DNAJC12-induced 
DOX resistance by recovering apoptosis and ferroptosis. Finally, in a subcutaneous tumor-bearing mouse model, we used an AKT 
inhibitor to reverse DNAJC12-induced DOX resistance in vivo. 
Conclusions: DNAJC12 expression is strongly associated with chemoresistance in BC patients. The DNAJC12-HSP70-AKT 
signaling axis plays an essential role in chemotherapy resistance by inhibiting DOX-induced ferroptosis and apoptosis. Our results 
reveal a potential therapeutic target for BC chemoresistance.

Background: The Elston-Ellis modification of Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) grading system is a major prognostic factor for 
invasive breast carcinoma (IC). Its determination requires the evaluation of a mitotic score which is subject to low intra and inter 
reproducibility. The mitotic count shall be performed in the most proliferative area of the tumor, which determination is hard but 
critical. Artificial intelligence based tools could help pathologists to detect mitosis on whole slide images (WSI). We developed an 
automatic detection pipeline along with an interactive interface to ease mitotic score determination. Here we present a clinical study 
designed to measure the help brought to practicians by this tool. 
Design: The algorithm locates mitosis in IC regions. Localization is a two-step process : a first brick detects candidate objects 
resembling mitosis, the selection is then refined by a classifier. It is trained on a set of invasive breast carcinoma slides containing 
2838 labeled mitoses from various medical centers. Mitosis density on the slide is then measured and the densest regions are 
shown to the pathologist along with detected objects. The pathologist can then establish a score. 
For this study, three expert pathologists determined a ground truth mitotic score on fifty slides in a consensual manner. Those 
slides were also submitted to two junior pathologists who evaluated the mitotic score of each slide twice, with and without the 
assistance of the algorithm, with a four weeks wash-out period. The help brought by our tool was measured by evaluating the 
scores obtained with, and without assistance, compared to the ground truth. 
Results: AI improves both pathologists' reproducibility and diagnostic accuracy. Mitotic score accuracy is increased by 14%, from 
62% without IA (resp. 64%) to 76% with IA (resp. 78%) for both junior pathologists. Kappas are increased from 0.457 (resp. 0.378) 
to 0.726 (resp. 0.629), Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for the mitotic count between junior pathologists is increased from 
0.591 to 0.883.

Conclusions: A clinical study confirmed that our mitotic detection can assist pathologists in their daily practice. 
 
225  Clinicopathological Features of HER2 Expressing Lobular Carcinoma of Breast

Disclosures: Maher Sughayer: None; Majd Khader: None 
Background: Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) comprises about 10% of invasive breast carcinomas (IBC) and is considered the 
most common special subtype of invasive breast carcinoma.  The vast majority (95%) of classical ILC express estrogen receptors 
(ER+) and progesterone receptors (PR+) but lack HER2 overexpression. On the other hand 30% of pleomorphic ILC are reported 
to be HER2+.  In a previous study we found that ILC represents 7.1% of all IBC and that HER2 was overexpressed in 3.6% of 
them. The aim of this study is to assess the histopathologic features of ILC that show overexpression of HER2. 
Design: This study was carried out at the King Hussein Cancer Center department of pathology. The archives were retrospectively 
searched for cases of invasive lobular carcinoma that exhibited HER2 overexpression between the years (2008-2019). H&E slides 
were retrieved. The histopathologic features of the invasive carcinomas were reviewed looking for any morphological deviation from 
the classical features of lobular carcinomas.  The following features were specifically looked for: nuclear pleomorphism, signet ring 
cell morphology, and apocrine features in order to see if these tumors can be classified as pleomorphic lobular carcinoma 
Results: A total of twenty-eight cases were found. Ten cases displayed all three histopathologic criteria that were studied (nuclear 
pleomorphism, signet ring cell morphology, and apocrine features), 12 cases showed pleomorphism and signet ring cell 
morphology, 3 cases showed pleomorphism and apocrine features, 2 cases showed pleomorphism only, and 1 case did not show 
any of the features. Twenty two cases were ER+ (78.6%), while only 16 cases (57.1%) were PR+. The patients were followed up 
over an average duration of 47 months. At 60 months, the overall survival was 40.7%. At time of last follow-up, of the twenty-eight 
patients, seven patients were alive (35%), four were alive with advanced disease (metastasis) (20%), and nine were dead 
(45%).  Eight patients had no outcome data available.  Out of the seven alive patients, three had a pathologic stage of ypT0N0 
(43%) at time of presentation 
Conclusions: The vast majority of HER2+ invasive lobular carcinomas are of the pleomorphic variant. In addition they tend to have 
signet ring cell morphology and apocrine features. Compared to the classical variant they have decreased overall survival rates and 
tend to have less expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors.

Background: Pure invasive apocrine carcinoma (IAC) is a rare type of primary breast cancer, constituting approximately 1% of all 
breast cancers. Most pure IACs are triple negative, while the rest are HER2-enriched. The clinical outcome of pure IACs varies 
among different studies due to limited cases and other reasons such as the criteria of the diagnosis. Therefore, we analyzed the 
clinicopathologic features of 96 pure IACs to investigate the characteristics of this population. 
Design: 96 pure IAC patients who underwent breast surgery at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center between 2009-2021 
were collected. Clinicopathologic characteristics including age, tumor size, lymph node status, histological grade, 
immunophenotype, pTNM stage, local recurrence and metastasis status were analyzed. 
Results:  All IAC patients were female, with a median age at diagnosis of 61 years (ranging from 38 to 83 years). The largest 
diameter of these tumors ranged from 0.8 to 7.5 cm. 86.8% of cases were diagnosed as histological grade II, and 13.2% as grade 
III. 25% of patients had nodal metastases at diagnosis, and the number of positive lymph nodes ranged from 1 to 14. The majority 
of patients in this cohort presented at an early TNM stage (I:51.0%; II:41.7%; and III:7.3%). 86.5% of patients were TNBC while 
only 10.4% were HER2 positive. The mean Ki-67 index was 12.9% (ranging from 3 to 50%). All cases exhibited diffuse nuclear 
staining for AR and GCDFP15. 41.4% of cases showed a distinctive granular cytoplasm staining pattern for HER2, and most of 
them (93.1%) were of TNBC subtype. After a median follow-up of 49 months, six patients (6.3%) died, four of whom developed 
disease-related mortality, and the other 2 died from other diseases. One (1.0%) patient suffered from local recurrence, and six 
(6.3%) experienced distant metastases. The most common metastatic sites were bone and lung. Twenty-five triple negative 
apocrine carcinomas were further investigated by next-generation sequencing (NGS), and the top ranked genomic alterations were 
PIK3CA (68%), TP53 (32%) and PTEN (28%) mutation. 
 
  
 
S212 
Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the largest clinicopathologic cohort for pure IACs. In our study, most pure 
IACs were TNBC with a relatively good clinical outcome compared with other aggressive subtypes of TNBC. NGS revealed the 
most common clinical relevant genomic alteration for triple negative IACs was PIK3CA mutation. Longer follow-up is vital to obtain 
more accurate prognostic information for IAC patients.

Background: Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently used for screening high risk patients, pre-surgical planning, 
assessment of eligibility for and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and resolution of lesions with discordant pathology. It has 
high sensitivity (> 90%) compared to conventional breast imaging methods (i.e., mammography) but is a time-consuming procedure 
that requires specific equipment and highly trained staff. More importantly, it has variable specificity (range 30-90%) and low 
positive predictive value, thereby increasing cost of care, patient anxiety, and time to treatment. This study explores the common 
clinical indications whereby MRI-guided breast biopsy is performed in our institution, as well as the histopathologic findings in these 
biopsies. 
Design: A retrospective electronic database search for MRI-guided breast biopsies performed in our institution between January 1, 
2016 and December 31, 2021 was conducted. Clinical indications and MRI findings were correlated with final histopathology and 
tested for statistical significance. 
Results: A total of 655 MRI biopsies (bx) from 548 patients were identified: 455 patients with 1 bx and 93 patients with more than 1 
bx. The MRI findings were: mass/mass-like enhancement (MLE) = 230 (35%), non-MLE = 214 (33%), enhancement = 118 (18%), 
and others = 93 (14%). Indications for bx were: post-mammogram dense breast = 19 (3%), high risk screening 267 (41%), 
concurrent breast cancer = 294 (45%), and others = 75 (12%). The bx histological findings included: 415 (63%) benign proliferative 
changes, 105 (16%) high-risk histology, 68 (10%) DCIS, 66 (10%) invasive carcinoma, and 1 (0.2%) mastitis. Malignancy was 
significantly higher in a setting of concurrent breast cancer (p<0.001, Figure 1). The prevalence of high risk/ borderline lesions was 
similar in all the clinical settings and ranged from 10.5% to 18%. MRI bx in the setting of nipple discharge revealed malignancy and 
high risk lesion in 13% and 7% of cases, respectively (Figure 2). The histological diagnosis of malignancy was independent of MRI 
findings, ranging from 19% to 22% among the 4 aforementioned categories.

Figure 2 - 227 
 
Conclusions: Benign proliferative changes are the most common finding in MRI-guided breast biopsies. Malignancy and high risk/ 
atypical histology are noted in up to 21% and 16% of biopsies, respectively. The malignant diagnosis in MRI biopsies is significantly 
higher in a setting of concurrent breast cancer and is independent of specific MRI features.

Background: Papillary neoplasms of the breast are diagnostically challenging due to morphological overlap among entities. When 
definitive classification is not possible on core needle biopsy (CNB), we use the term “atypical papillary neoplasm” (APN), defined 
as cytologic and/or architectural atypia occurring in papillary lesions. The upgrade rate of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) has 
been reported as 30%. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical significance of APN on CNB by determining upgrade rate on 
excisional biopsy. 
Design: We collected CNB diagnosed as APN in a single institution between January 2000 and January 2022. Demographics and 
excisional biopsy reports were correlated.   
Results: 55,669 CNB were performed. Of these, we found 116 CNB with the diagnosis of APN in 113 patients. Excisional biopsy 
findings are summarized in table 1.

Conclusions: APN is used sparingly in our institution accounting for 0.2% of CNB. 88% of patients diagnosed with APN were 
upgraded to DCIS, EPC, or IDC on excisional biopsy. Age was not a factor in upgrade risk (p=0.73). Because the upgrade rate of 
APN is higher than for ADH (30%), complete excision with negative margins should be considered.

Background: The recent DESTINY-Breast04 clinical trial reported survival benefits of using Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in patients 
whose metastatic breast carcinoma showed low HER2 IHC expression (HER2-L). HER2-L is defined as a IHC score of 1+ or 2+ 
with negative FISH. These new findings may cause challenges for pathologists as the HER2 testing and reporting guidelines were 
designed with an emphasis on identifying HER2 positive tumors. Only limited data has reported poor agreement in scoring HER2-0 
vs. 1+ on glass and scanned IHC slides. The aim of this project is to investigate the HER2 IHC concordance rate, with a particular 
focus on HER2-0 vs. HER2-L, among pathologists who practice in the same institution, and to evaluate impact of a training session 
on concordance improvement. 
Design: Total 60 HER2 IHC and H&E stains from breast biopsies with invasive carcinoma were retrieved. The cases were 
reviewed by 9 breast pathologists (7 experienced attendings and 2 fellows) individually in 2 rounds of 30 cases each. An 
educational slide review session was provided between the 2 rounds addressing cases from 1st round that showed low 
concordance rate. SPSS (ver 27) was used to analyze the data and compute Cohen’s kappa (ƙ) values. 
Results: The overall complete agreement for HER2 was noted in 37/60 (62%) cases, with similar agreement in the 1st [19/30 
(63%)] and 2nd round [18/30 (60%)]. For all 60 cases ƙ values ranged from .517 to .895 with 92% ƙ values in substantial agreement 
range or better (≥.61). The agreement in diagnosing HER2-0 & HER2-L was 59%: 14/25 (56%) in the 1st round and 62% (16/26) in 
the 2nd round. For HER2-0 and HER2-L ƙ values ranged from .298 to .826, with only 45% of the ƙ values in substantial agreement 
or better range.  Two or more scorers classified 5 HER2-0 as HER2-L & 3 HER2-L as HER2-0. In HER2-L group 50% of the scorer 
pairs ƙ values were ≤ 0 (no agreement) and only 14% of pairs showed substantial or better agreement (Table 1). Cytoplasmic blush 
(A), dislodged tumor cells in fibrin (B), staining of in-situ component (C) and lobular features (D [Figure1]) were considered potential 
reasons for difficulty in distinguishing HER2-0 vs. HER2-L staining.

Conclusions: Breast pathologists show poor agreement in distinguishing HER2-0 and HER2-L IHC scores in breast carcinomas. 
This disagreement may be related to pitfalls of the IHC staining assessment. Scoring HER2-L may require continuous education 
and calibration to increase awareness of these pitfalls and to improve concordance rate.

Background: The 5th edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of breast tumors recommends diagnosing 
malignant phyllodes tumors (MPTs) when all of the following 5 morphologic features are present: permeative tumor borders, 
stromal overgrowth, marked stromal cellularity, marked stromal cytologic atypia and ≥10 mitoses per 10 high-power fields (HPF). 
We aimed to assess the performance characteristics of the WHO recommendation to capture MPTs and morphologic features 
predictive of distant metastasis in this multi-institutional retrospective study. 
Design: MPTs diagnosed at participating institutions between 2000 and 2021 were identified. Selection criteria included excisions 
or mastectomies with available slides and clinical outcome. Clinical-pathologic data were collected. Statistical analyses were 
performed using R software and included univariate (Kaplan-Meier curves, log rank test) and multivariate models. 
Results: A total of 65 MPTs were identified with median follow-up of 24.5 months (1-204). The median patient age was 49 years 
(22-89). The median tumor size was 8 cm (2-33). Stromal overgrowth was present in 56 cases (86%), marked stromal cellularity in 
40 (61.5%), marked stromal atypia in 38 (58.5%), ≥10 mitoses per 10 HPF in 50 (77%), and at least focally permeative borders in 
58 (89.5%). A subset of tumors (17, 26%) had heterologous elements, the most common being liposarcomatous differentiation (8, 
47%). Distant metastases were observed in 20 (31%) patients (Table 1). All 5 morphologic features were identified in only 13 (20%) 
of the 65 cases and 7 (35%) of the 20 cases with distant metastases. In univariate analysis, only marked stromal atypia (p=0.004)

Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the current WHO recommendation will miss a significant number of MPTs with distant 
metastases. We propose refined diagnostic criteria for MPTs without requiring all 5 morphologic features: 1) a combination of 
stromal overgrowth with ≥1 of the features (marked stromal atypia, marked stromal cellularity, ≥10 mitoses per 10 HPF), or 2) in the

absence of stromal overgrowth, a combination of marked stromal cellularity with either marked stromal atypia or ≥10 mitoses per 10 
HPF.

Background: The approval of trastuzumab deruxtecan in advanced HER2-low (IHC 1+ or 2+/ish-) breast cancers has led to a 
paradigm shift in the evaluation of HER2. Meanwhile, it raised a number of important questions related to the biologic significance 
of HER2-low expression as well as the best methodology that can be used to identify which patients with "HER2-negative" breast 
cancers will be the most likely to derive clinical benefit from this new targeted therapeutic approach.  We herein retrospectively 
examined a large series of ER-positive breast cancer sent for Oncotype (ODX) testing, looking for correlates between the reported 
HER2 mRNA results, recurrence scores, Magee scores, Ki67 results, and HER2 IHC categories (0+, 1+ and 2+/ish-). 
Design: A total of 750 ER positive, HER2 negative breast cancer samples from 2008 to 2018 that had been sent for ODX testing 
were included. HER2 mRNA levels, ODX recurrence score (RS), Magee score and Ki67 index were collected and analyzed 
by Welch's t-test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
Results: Among HER2 IHC categories, there was a significant difference in HER2 mRNA values between IHC 0+ and IHC 1+ 
(8.80 vs 9.18, p<0.01), as well as between IHC 1+ and 2+/ish- (9.18 vs 9.35, p<0.05) (Table 1). Ki-67 index, recurrence scores by 
both ODX and Magee equation showed statistically significant differences between IHC 1+ and 2+/ish- cases, but not between 
HER2 0 and HER2 1+ cases (Fig 1). Further analysis between HER2 0 and HER2 low cases showed that only difference in HER2 
mRNA levels reached statistical significance; while, the differences in RS, Magee scores and Ki-67 index between HER2 0 and 
HER2 low groups failed to reach statistical significance (Fig 2).

Figure 2 - 231 
 
Conclusions: From this large cohort, IHC 0+, 1+, and 2+/ISH- appeared to be able to distinguish between quantitative levels of 
HER2 mRNA in these HER2-low expressing tumors. Given IHC 0+ and 1+ were indistinguishable in RS, Magee Scores, and Ki67 
levels, IHC testing is not the most efficient when predicting the risk of recurrence between HER2-0 and HER2-low breast cancers. 
On the contrary, IHC 2+/ish- was significantly distinguished across each quantitative variable and expected to have a higher 
chance of recurrence as suggested by RS/Magee Score. Correlation with HER2 mRNA, RS, Magee scores need to be further 
evaluated as a methodology for identifying HER2-low breast cancers to determine who will gain the greatest benefit from new 
treatment.

Background: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for HER2 protein evaluation is a semi-quantitative method with relatively limited 
dynamic ranges and is not an ideal method for detecting low levels of HER2 expression. With the inclusion of HER2-low category in 
the HER2 evaluation, it is urgently needed to develop alternative methods for accurate and reliable evaluation of HER2 expression 
for selecting patient who would derive clinical benefit from the newly-approved anti-HER2 agent. Streptavidin-coated phosphor 
integrated dot fluorescent nanoparticles (PID) has been reported to be a valuable quantitative methodology for HER2 testing in 
breast cancers. In this study, we evaluated whether there was significant difference in the level of HER2 protein expression by PID 
across the different HER2 IHC subgroups. 
Design: A total of 105 samples which were previously tested by PID assay were included. The corresponding HER2 IHC was 
performed by HercepTest and was scored according to ASCO/CAP HER2 testing guidelines. The average number of PID 
nanoparticles per cell (PID score/cell) and the average number of PID nanoparticles per unit area (PID score/ROI100um2) were 
collected and analyzed by descriptive statistics to produce a mean and confidence interval for each HER2 IHC category. P<0.05 
was considered statistical significance. 
Results: Both PID score/cell and PID score/unit had a broad dynamic range (2.25-294.26 and 1.53-140.65) across the different 
HER2 IHC subgroups, and increased with the IHC scores (Table 1). Statistical analysis revealed that there were significant 
differences in average PID score/cell between IHC 1+ vs. 2+/ish- groups (p<0.05), 2+/ish- vs. 2+/ish+ groups (p<0.01) and 2+/ish+ 
vs. 3+ groups (P<0.01), while no significant difference was achieved between HER2 0 and HER2 1+ groups. The average PID 
score/unit showed similar trend, although there was no significant difference between HER2 1+ and HER2 2+/ISH- groups (Fig 1). 
When comparing between HER2-0, HER2-low and HER2-positive categories, the significant differences on both PID score/cell and 
PID score/unit were achieved between HER2-0 and HER2-low, as well as between HER2-low and HER2-positive cases (Fig 2).

Conclusions: The preliminary results demonstrated quantitative PID method has a broad dynamic ranges (~133 folds) and could 
provide more reliable evaluation on HER2-low expressing breast cancers. Further evaluation of PID in the large case cohort and 
extensive clinical validation are needed.

Background: Mammographic architectural distortion (MAD) is defined as distorted normal breast architecture without definitely 
visible mass in the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon. MAD have been associated with a wide variety 
 
  
 
S219 
of benign or malignant lesions. In this study, we evaluated the outcomes of this radiological finding at our institution, including the 
frequency with which malignancy is identified in the associated biopsy. 
Design: Our pathology data base was searched for all breast core needle biopsies (CNB) performed for a radiologic indication of 
MAD between 1/2011 and 6/2022. Radiologic and pathology findings were reviewed. 
Results: A total of 242 cases were identified, comprising approximately 1.8% of all CNBs. The age of patients ranged from 22 to 
86 (mean: 58). The pathologic diagnoses were classified as malignant (40.5%), atypical (4.5%), and benign (55%).  Of 99 
malignant cases, 74 (74.8%) were invasive carcinomas, 22 (22.2%) were ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and 2 (2%) showed 
metastatic carcinoma. Of the invasive cancers, 53 (71.6%) were invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), 15 (20.2%) were invasive lobular 
carcinoma (ILC), and 6 (8.1%) were mixed type carcinomas. Among the cases with metastatic carcinomas, one was high grade 
serous carcinoma of gynecologic origin and one lung adenocarcinoma. Among the 11 atypical lesions, there were 6 (54%) atypical 
ductal hyperplasia and flat epithelial atypias, and 5 (46%) lobular carcinoma in sit). Benign lesions (133, 55%) included 29 complex 
sclerosing lesion/radial scar, 3 intraductal papillomas, 3 fibroadenomas, and 96 cases that encompass a variety of benign findings 
such as fibrocystic changes, fibrotic stromal changes, mastitis, and fibroadenomatous alterations. Malignant outcomes were 
associated with older age (mean 65.2 vs 55.1 years, p < 0.001). 
Conclusions: At our institution, approximately 1.8% of breast core needle biopsies were performed for MAD, and up to 40.5% of 
these biopsies showed a malignant histologic finding. The majority of malignant cases (74.8%) were invasive carcinomas, most of 
which were invasive ductal carcinomas. Malignant outcomes were associated with older age. These findings support that a needle 
biopsy should be performed in MAD cases given the high number of malignant cases.

Disclosures: Jayalakshmi Venkateswaran: None; Ramapriya Vidhun: None; Madhavi Raghu: None 
Background: The management of radial scar/s (RS) is controversial due to the questionable intrinsic malignant potential of RS and 
coexistence of other high risk proliferative lesions requiring excision. In the past, all RS diagnosed on biopsy were excised. 
Upgrade to a carcinoma on excision was observed in less than 2.0%. Excising RS without atypia is debatable. RS can coexist with 
other proliferative high-risk lesions, including atypia, contributing to the overall upgrade rate to malignancy at excision. Rates of 
upgrade of RS to cancer at excision varies from 0-43%. Upgrade risk factors include- older age (>50 years), postmenopausal 
status, larger size on imaging, and presence of atypical hyperplasia.  The most important reason for this variation is attributable to 
the coexistence of higher risk proliferative lesions. Other factors include biopsy needle size, and the number of cores obtained. The 
purpose of this study was to evaluate the upgrade rate of radial scars without atypia at excision. 
Design: An IRB approved retrospective review of the pathology database was conducted for breast biopsies diagnosed 
as RS without atypia diagnosed at stereotactic and ultrasound biopsy between Jan 1, 2015, and May 31, 2022, at Danbury 
Hospital. Informed consent was waived. Upgrade rate to malignancy at excision was documented. 
Results: During the study period, there were 234 biopsies with diagnoses of RS along with other lesions (benign and/or 
malignant). Eighty-three of these were identified as RS without atypia or malignancy. A total of 49.4% (41 of 83) of RS without 
atypia or malignancy diagnosed on core biopsies were surgically excised. A majority of cases (40/41 (97.6%) were benign.  One 
case was upgraded to ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) on excision (2.4%). There were no upgrades to invasive carcinoma. The 
biopsy needle size and the number of biopsies did not provide conclusive information in our study sample.

Conclusions: In this study, RS without atypia diagnosed at core needle biopsy showed an upgrade rate of 2.4% (DCIS). Excision 
of RS without atypia may not be necessary in every case. Imaging follow-up of these lesions with may be a reasonable 
management plan.

Background: Novel anti-HER2 antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) have shown efficacy in invasive breast cancers (BCs) expressing 
low levels of HER2 (1+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and 2+ non-amplified). However, differentiating scores 0 from 1+ is 
challenging even for experienced pathologists. In private practice, pathologists diagnose frequently BCs and must be able to 
establish the HER2 low status with reliability and reproducibility. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms based on deep learning could 
help in the assessment of HER2 low score. The objectives of this work were 1) to assess the concordance of the diagnosis of 
HER2 low among pathologists practicing in a liberal structure and 2) to study the performance of AI algorithms in this indication. 
Design: 200 whole slide images (WSI) centrally stained by IHC HER2 from primary BCs expressing low levels of HER2 were 
selected based on pathology reports. The slides were digitized and then subjected to an inter-observer study including 12 
pathologists from a private laboratory. The same 200 slides were analyzed by a pathologist expert in breast pathology and then 
subjected to four AI tools designed for HER2 scoring. To study the performance of the algorithms, AI tests were performed on 
regions of interest (ROI) representative of HER2 labeling. In parallel, the ease of use of each software and algorithm was 
evaluated. 
Results: After proofreading by the expert pathologist, the cohort included 41 "0" cases, 120 "1+" cases and 36 "2+" cases by IHC. 
With the expert pathologist as reference, the inter-observer studies showed an average concordance of 68% (range: 57-87%) with 
10.6% of the cases (n=21) for which the concordance between pathologists was 100%. AI testing is ongoing. The first results show 
variable performances from 43 to 71% concordance with the reference. 
Figure 1 - 235 
 
Conclusions: Inter-observer agreement for HER2 scoring within a liberal group is similar to that observed in the literature. Ongoing 
training for establishing low HER2 status should increase concordance between observers. The guidelines used to configure the 
HER2 scoring and their ability to recognize artefacts partly explain the differences in performance observed between the AI 
algorithms. The use of these AI tools in routine practice will require prospective validations but also perfect integration and 
interoperability with the image management systems currently deployed in pathology laboratories.

Background: The molecular pathogenesis of breast phyllodes tumors (PTs) is not fully understood. Most studies have 
concentrated on genetic alterations, e.g., chromosomal imbalances or somatic mutations (e.g., MED12 and TERT genes), while 
little is known about epigenetic changes. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) has been recognized as a stable epigenetic mark 
showing global loss and/or specific redistribution patterns in various tumor types. Nano-hmC-Seal is a 5hmC enrichment next-
 
  
 
S221 
generation sequencing (NGS) assay capable of trapping covalently and isolating 5hmC-modified-loci of genomic DNA extracted 
from FFPE samples. Herein, we employ this technique for genome-wide 5hmC profiling of benign (BEN) and malignant (MALIG) 
PTs. 
Design: Six BEN and six MALIG PTs from women with comparable age and race were selected to minimize confounding variables. 
Following extraction, genomic DNA fragments were ligated with standard adaptors, selectively labeled with an azide tag at 5hmC 
sites, biotinylated, streptavidin-bead-captured, and then underwent NGS. Data analysis was carried out using NGS analysis tools 
such as bowtie2 and DESeq2. 
Results: Of the 31781 distinguishable 5hmC-enriched regions identified, 320 were statistically different between BEN and MALIG 
PTs (p<0.005). Principal component analysis and heat-mapping successfully separated BEN from MALIG samples (Fig 1). We 
further identified 168 differentially 5hmC-modified genes (p<0.005), including 8 genes with FDR<0.05 (AJAP1, ARHGEF39, 
KCNH2, HS3ST6, PLEKHO1, NFAM1, IRF2BP2, and EPOR). The 5hmC-seal sequencing reads showed a distinct genomic 
distribution, enriched most in the promoter/enhancer regions, depleted at the transcription start site (TSS), and modestly enriched 
in gene bodies. Whereas the level of promoter enrichment was similar between BEN and MALIG PTs, on the gene bodies and after 
the transcription end site (TES), BEN PTs had much higher 5hmC levels of mapped reads, indicating a greater global amount of 
5hmC in BEN vs. MALIG PTs (Fig 2). The selected differentially 5hmC-modified genes (lfc>20%, p<0.01) involved several top 
canonical pathways, including WNT/β-catenin signaling and G1/S checkpoint regulation. 
Figure 1 - 236 
 
Figure 2 - 236 
 
Conclusions: BEN and MALIG PTs show distinct methylation signatures by genome-wide 5hmC profiling. While we are currently 
investigating the borderline category and adjacent normal breast tissue, this pilot report suggests a potential use of 5hmC profiling 
in the categorization of PTs, in addition to uncovering the underlying PTs biology.

Background: Hematopoietic neoplasms (HN) involving the breast are rare, mostly comprising lymphomas. Knowledge of 
presentation (primary [PBHN] vs. secondary [SBHN]), radiologic aspects, and their outcomes are critical to a breast pathologist for 
seeking appropriate hematopathology consultation. Herein, we present our experience of breast HN in the past 20 years. 
Design: We identified 59 patients (pts) diagnosed at the University of Chicago Medical Center between 2002-2021. Demographic, 
pathologic, radiologic, therapy, relapse data, and vital status were abstracted. Data were examined using univariable statistics with 
event-free and overall survival (EFS, OS) as primary outcomes examined with the lymphoma subgroup using Cox PH regression 
adjusted for age. 
Results: The cases included 27 (46%) PBHN and 32 (54%) SBHN comprising 93% females, mostly Caucasian (79%). The mean 
age at diagnosis was 58.8 yrs. 5 of 59 pts presented with concurrent breast carcinoma (BC: 4 IDC SBR gr II/III, 1 HG DCIS); 3 of 5 
with BC preceding; 1 synchronous; and 1 BHN preceding. Lymphomas were the most frequent hematopoietic neoplasm (Figure 1), 
but unusual HN types were also identified and included ALCL, histiocytic sarcoma, and AML. Examining the lymphoma cohort 
(86.4% of all cases), pts with PBL were significantly older than SBL (61.2 vs. 49.8 yrs, p<0.02). There was no tumor size difference 
between PBL vs. SBL (median 2.1 cm).  The most frequent lymphomas were MZL (32.2%) and DLBCL/HGBCL, NOS (33.9%), 
followed by FL (15%) (Fig. 1) including two DLBCLs that were transformed-FL. Over half of MZL and DLBCLs were primary in the 
breast with two MZL pts with underlying autoimmune disease. Although 2 patients had breast implants, no cases of implant-
associated ALCL were diagnosed. Within B-cell lymphomas, 20 (37%) were high grade with inferior 10-yr OS (age-adjusted HR 
5.47, 95% CI 1.38, 21.64) compared to low-grade without any impact on EFS (Figure 2) 
Figure 1 - 237 
 
 
 
  
 
S223 
Figure 2 - 237 
 
Conclusions: This is one of the largest cohorts by far describing HN in the breast. Patients with PBL were significantly older while 
DLBCL and MZL remain the most common lymphomas involving this site. Radiographically, the presentation might sometimes 
mimic breast cancer and unusual HN may also be identified at this site (myeloid sarcoma, histiocytic sarcoma, PTCL).

Background: In breast tumors, neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation is seen in neuroendocrine tumors (NET), neuroendocrine 
carcinomas (NEC), solid papillary carcinomas, mucinous carcinomas, and invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs) with NE 
differentiation. Diagnosis of NE differentiation relies on immunohistochemistry for synaptophysin (SYN) and chromogranin-A 
(CHR). INSM1 is a sensitive and specific NE marker and has been shown to be a reliable marker for NE differentiation in NET and 
NECs of GI and lung origins. Few studies have shown similar results in INSM1 in breast carcinomas with NE differentiation.  In this 
study we investigated the value of INSM1 expression as a marker of NE differentiation in tumors with NE morphology by comparing 
INSM1 expression with traditional markers of NE differentiation. 
Design: Core needle biopsies or excisional biopsies between 2017 and 2022 were assessed for NE differentiation in tumors with 
NE morphology on histology based on cytological and/or architectural features. INSM1, SYN, and CHR stains were performed. 
Positive staining was defined as any cytoplasmic staining for SYN and CHR and moderate to strong nuclear staining for INSM1 in 
>5% of cells. Percentage of positive cells were calculated using 500 cell count. 
Results: Thirty-three cases with NE morphology were evaluated in this study.  SYN was positive in 23 (sensitivity of 70%), 
chromogranin in 18 (sensitivity of 55%) and INSM1 in 25 (sensitivity of 76%).  INSM1 expression was concordant with SYN in 31 
(94%) and chromogranin in 24 (73%) of cases.  Twenty-five of 33 cases (76%) expressed SYN or CHR.  This included 4 NETs, 4 
mucinous carcinomas, 2 NE carcinomas, 1 solid papillary carcinoma and 14 IDCs with NE differentiation.  There was one case out 
of 33 (3%) that was positive for INSM1 and negative for SYN and CHR.  Seven cases out of 33 (21%) were negative for all NE 
markers, despite displaying concerning features on H&E.  Additionally INSM1 expression in breast carcinoma without NE 
differentiation was evaluated in a tissue microarray consisting of 203 IDCs without NE differentiation.  INSM1 was positive in 3 
cores (specificity 98.5%).

features and can be considered as a reliable diagnostic tool in conjunction with SYN and or CHR.  However, molecular profile and 
clinical implications of INSM1 expression in breast tumors needs to be further investigated.

Background: TRPS1 has been identified as a specific and sensitive biomarker for breast cancer. However, a few tumors of non-
mammary origin also express TRPS1, which can cause a diagnostic challenge. To date, whether TRPS1 is also a lineage-
restricted transcription factor for non-mammary tumors remains unknown, and the details of its expression in the normal 
counterparts are not even known. We aimed to assess the expression of TRPS1 in different types of relatively normal organs using 
polyclonal TRPS1 (pTRPS1) and monoclonal TRPS1 (mTRPS1). 
Design: We collected 135 samples from 27 different organs (n= 5 for each). Whole tissue sections were stained with pTRPS1 and 
mTPRS1 using Leica Bond Max autostainer system following standard automated protocols. Only nuclear staining was considered 
as pos and their immunoreactive scores were calculated by multiplying a number representing the percentage of immunoreactive 
cells (0, <1%; 1, 1%-10%; 2, 11%-50%; and 3, 51%-100%) by the staining intensity (0, no nuclear staining at 40x power; 1, visible 
at 40x power; 2, visible at 20x power; and 3, visible at 4-10x power). The scores were defined as neg (0 or 1), low pos (2), 
intermediate pos (3 or 4), or high pos (6 or 9). 
Results: pTRPS1 and mTPRS1 were both high pos in breast epithelium (5, 100%), embryonic mesenchymal cells (5, 100%), and 
squamous epithelium of uterine cervix (5, 100%), tonsil (5, 100%) and esophagus (5, 100%). In the skin, mTPRS1 was low pos in 
 
  
 
S225 
epidermis (2, 40%), and pos in appendages (5, 100%), with high, intermediate and low pos in sebaceous glands, eccrine and hair 
follicles, respectively, but neg in apocrine; otherwise, pTRPS1 was low pos only in eccrine (3, 60%). In the brain, mTPRS1 was 
low-intermediate pos in ependyma (5, 100%, with 2 intermediate pos and 3 low pos), and intermediate pos in glial cells (5, 100%). 
Moreover, mTRPS1 was high pos in endometrial glands (5, 100%), intermediate pos in endocervical glands (5, 100%) and low pos 
in bladder urothelium (2, 40%).

Conclusions: TPRS1 is a sensitive marker for breast epithelium, non-skin origin squamous epithelium and mesenchymal cells. 
Moreover, pTRPS1 is more specific for these cells than mTRPS1, with the pTRPS1 being high pos only in these cells.

Disclosures: Chengqin Wang: None; Xiaoming Xing: None; Zhaoxu Chen: None; Zhimin Wei: None; Yujun Li: None 
Background: Recently, HER2-low has received much attention as a new breast cancer subtype, however, its significance in 
adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) patients is unclear. This study aims to evaluate the correlation between HER2 status and 
clinicopathological features in NAC breast cancer patients and to analyze the prognostic significance of HER2 status. 
Design: The clinicopathological data of 166 female patients with primary invasive breast cancer who received NAC in our 
institution (from January 2017 to June 2019) were collected. All patients underwent mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection 
afterNAC. Preoperative HER2 status was stratified into HER2-zero (IHC 0), HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC2+/FISH negative)and HER2-
high (IHC 2+/FISH positive or IHC3+). Median follow-up was 46 months with disease-free survival (DFS) as study endpoint. 
Results: Of the 166 patients, the proportion of HER2-high tumors (75, 45.2%) was higher than that of HER2-low(70, 42.2%) and 
HER2-zero(21, 12.6%). Hormone receptor (HR)+ was more common in the HER2-low tumors than in the HER2-zero (p=0.036) and 
HER2-high (p<0.001) (Fig. 1). There was no significant difference in postoperative pathological complete response (pCR) rates 
among the three groups (Fig.1). In addition, no difference was found in postoperative Miller-Payne grading system(p=0.140) and 
Sataloff lymph node grade (p=0.502) between HER2-low and HER2-zero tumors(Table 1). In the HR+ tumors, the HER2-low 
accounted for 58.0%. Compared with HER2-zero ,ER levels were higher in the HER2-low tumors, but not statistically significant 
(n=0.738).However, compared to HER2-high, HER2-low tumors had higher ER level (p=0.030), lower Ki-67proliferation 
index(p=0.014) and differences in Miller-Payne grading system (p=0.047).In the HR-tumors, the proportion of HER2-high was 
62.3% and there was no significant difference in clinicopathological features among the three groups (all p>0.05).Kaplan-Meier 
survival analysis found that HER2 status had no effect on DFS of the overall, HR+ and HR- patients (log-rank, all p>0.05). 
Furthermore, pCR status (log-rank, p=0.914) also had no effect on patient DFS (Fig. 2). Univariate analysis showed that HER2 
status (HR=0.757, 95% CI,0.164-3.505,p=0.722), HR status (HR=1.053, 95% CI,0.655-1.691,p=0.831) and pCR status (HR=2.968, 
95% CI,0.379-23.215,p=0.300) had no significance for the prognosis of NAC patients. Only age was an independent prognostic 
factor affecting DFS of NAC patients in univariate (HR=0.955, 95% CI,0.913-0.995,p=0.041.)and multivariate(HR=0.943, 95% 
CI,0.893-0.996,p=0.035) analyses.

Conclusions: HER2-low tumors were strongly associated with HR status, however, no evidence was found that HER2 status was 
associated with chemotherapy response and prognosis in NAC patients.

Background: HER2-targeted therapy for invasive breast cancer was until now available only for patients with a HER2 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 3+ or a score of 2+ with gene amplification. Recent clinical trials suggest that HER2-targeted 
therapy may also benefit patients with HER2-low breast cancer, defined as an HER2 score of 1+ or 2+ and no gene amplification. 
We evaluated concordance between pathologists and between core biopsy and surgical excision in establishing HER2-low status 
by light microscopic examination of HER2 IHC. 
Design: The study included 61 patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer classified as HER2 negative (0, 1+, or 2+ and no 
gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization) by standard-of-care core biopsy evaluation. Representative tumor from 
surgical excision was immunostained for HER2. Three pathologists independently interpreted HER2 IHC staining on core biopsy 
and surgical excision specimens. Consensus diagnosis was obtained in discordant cases. Kappa statistic evaluated agreement of 
HER2 scores between the study pathologists, agreement between the study pathologists and the pathologists who initially reported 
the core biopsy’s HER2 score, and agreement between the HER2 consensus scores for the core biopsy and surgical excision 
specimens. 
Results: HER2 IHC scores were concordant between the study pathologists in 50 (82%) core biopsy and 53 (87%) surgical 
resection specimens. HER2 consensus scores were concordant between the core biopsy and surgical excision specimens in 37 
(61%) cases; low (1+ or 2+) HER2 expression was identified in 29 (48%) core biopsy and 26 (43%) surgical excision specimens. 
Kappa statistics were 0.79 and 0.84, respectively, for interpathologist agreement on core biopsy and surgical resection specimens; 
0.52 for agreement between the study pathologists and initial pathologists; and 0.32 for agreement in HER2 consensus scores 
between the core biopsy and surgical excision specimens. 
Conclusions: Interobserver agreement among study pathologists was good for both core biopsy and surgical excision specimens. 
Agreement was poor between the core biopsy and surgical excision specimens, suggesting intratumoral heterogeneity in HER2 
protein expression at the lower end of the spectrum. Testing of both core biopsy and surgical excision specimens may increase the 
rates of identification of HER2-low status in selecting patients for targeted therapy.

Background: Cancer cells that transit from primary tumours into the circulatory system are known as circulating tumour cells 
(CTCs). Classical CTC detection forms part of the liquid biopsy and relies on EpCAM affinity-based technologies such as 
CellSearch. The FDA has recently approved the Parsortix® for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) CTC enrichment. Breast cancer 
patients commonly present with local and systemic changes in the immune-inflammation index and recent studies report that CTCs 
associated with peripheral immune cells may have a higher metastatic potential. 
Design: Peripheral blood specimens were prospectively collected from MBC patients (n=20) and processed for CTC isolation 
within 4 h of blood draw using Parsortix®. Isolated cells were immunophenotyped (CTC-ID; DAPI, CD45, CK19/panCK/EpCAM and 
HER2) by immunofluorescence microscopy. A subset of patients (n=10) had CTC enumeration performed on both Parsortix and 
CellSearch (CRUK Manchester). Patients were stratified as <5 CTC/7.5ml or ≥5 CTC/7.5 and tested for correlation with clinical 
markers of inflammation and survival. 
Results: 85% of MBC patients had ³1 CTC (1-220 cells/7.5ml) detected. Concordance was found between CellSearch and 
Parsortix CTC counts. 50% of patients were found to have at least 1 HER2+ CTC. Presence of ³5 CTCs or CTC clusters was 
associated with shorter survival time in MBC. Patients with ³5 CTCs had an increase in platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR). CTC 
positivity was also associated with higher plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). High CTC count did not 
correlate with CA15.3 levels. 
Conclusions: We report that the use of expanded CTC-ID markers for CTC enumeration on cells isolated using Parsortix correlate 
with markers of inflammation in metastatic breast cancer. The presence of CTCs and CTC clusters is a marker of aggressive 
disease in MBC. HER2+ CTCs were also detected in HER2- patients. High CTC counts were associated with an increase in 
PLR and PAI-1 levels indicating that high CTC trafficking is associated with an altered inflammatory response which may aid in 
metastatic dissemination.

Background: Nipple adenoma (NA) is a rare, benign proliferation of the lactiferous nipple ducts. It presents as a skin growth, rash, 
erosive lesion, and/or with nipple discharge. It may be clinically mistaken for Paget disease or squamous cell carcinoma. No large 
case series of nipple adenoma has been undertaken since the 1980s. Herein, we report a series of 42 cases of nipple adenoma to 
broaden our understanding of its clinicopathologic characteristics. 
Design: After IRB approval, cases of NA were retrieved from the in-house and consultation archives from 2003-2022. For 
inclusion, cases had to have a dense ductal proliferation in breast tissue with close proximity to the nipple epidermis. Medical 
records were reviewed. Referring physicians were contacted when necessary. 
Results: 42 cases met criteria. 36 had follow-up data. All were female, with a mean age of 57 years (26-78 years). The left breast 
(62%) was more common than the right breast (38%). Tumor size averaged 0.9 cm (0.2 – 1.5 cm). 25 patients (68%) were 
symptomatic. Common symptoms included bloody nipple discharge and itching/irritation (24% each). A skin growth was present in 
59%. 67% were excised: primarily (33%) or via re-excision after biopsy (33%). In a median follow-up time of 66 months (0.5-227 
months), 94% were alive with no evidence of disease, and 6% were dead from other causes. One patient developed invasive 
ductal carcinoma (IDC) adjacent to the excision site at 98 months. Four histologic patterns were noted: adenosis-like (dense 
proliferation of small-to-medium ducts) (Fig. 1); large duct (medium-to-large caliber ducts); papillary-like (frond-like architecture with 
 
  
 
S230 
branching, slit-like lumens); and pseudo-infiltrative (ducts distorted by dense stromal fibrosis) (Fig. 2). All cases demonstrated bi-
layered epithelium visible on H&E.  Histopathologic characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Conclusions: We report a large series of NA with four principle architectural patterns, which are often intermixed with one 
predominating. The most pertinent differential diagnosis is IDC, especially when the pseudo-infiltrative pattern is present. Overall 
symmetry, lack of cytologic atypia, and bi-layered epithelium (typically visible on H&E) support a diagnosis of NA. 
Syringocystadenoma papilliferum may also be confused for NA; NA is often lacking the prominent cystic invagination with papillary 
formation and abundant plasma cells in the stroma.  Simple excision is curative, and recurrence is rare.

Background: Breast carcinomas with micropapillary features (BrCaMP) may be HER2-amplified despite negative HER2 
immunohistochemistry (IHC). ASCO/CAP guidelines recommend basolateral staining in BrCaMP should be reported as equivocal 
expression (2+) and reflexed to Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) testing. Amplification rates over 40% were reported 
following 2013 ASCO/CAP guidelines with alternate probes in FISH equivocal cases.  In this study we assessed the amplification 
rates, clinicopathologic features and treatment of patients with BrCaMP following updated 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines. 
Design: Breast cancer cases with “micropapillary” in the diagnoses between 1/2019-2/2022 were retrospectively identified. All 
available clinicopathologic information was recorded including treatment and follow-up. Slides were reviewed to determine the 
extent of micropapillary histology. 
Results: 48 cases were identified with average age of 61.4 (range:35-97). 7(14.6%) were biopsy, 41(85.4%) excision. 
Micropapillary histology varied from 5-100%, (5-≤10% in 8; 10-50% in 13; ≥50% in 27). 12(25%) had mucinous features. 4(8.3%) 
was grade 1, 32(66.7%) grade 2, 12(25%) grade 3. 44(91.7%) were Estrogen Receptor (ER) positive, 3(6.3%) ER&PR 
negative.  23(47.9%) were T1 stage, 14(29.2%) lymph node negative (N0). 12(25%) were HER2 positive by IHC or FISH (Table). 
6/30 (25%) of IHC 1+/2+ were FISH amplified. 11/12 (91.7%) of HER2 positive patients got targeted therapy.  8 patients got 
neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) (4 HER2 positive, 4 HER2 negative), 1/8 NAT had complete pathologic response (HER2 3+ case). After 
an average follow up of 22.7 months (range=3-125; median=18), 37 patients were alive with no evidence of disease, 8 alive with 
recurrent/metastatic disease, 3 dead from breast cancer.

*There were no FISH Group 2 &3 cases. 
Conclusions: Following 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines 25% of BrCaMP were HER2 positive, higher than what is expected for all 
breast cancers but lower than expected following 2013 recommendations for BrCaMP. 11.1% of IHC 1+/negative, and 33.3% of 
IHC 2+/equivocal cases were FISH amplified emphasizing FISH should be part of HER2 testing for these tumors. Both the lymph 
node negativity (pN0) and (in those receiving NAT) the rate of complete pathologic response was low, suggesting these are 
biologically aggressive tumors.

Background: Immune checkpoint gene expression clusters into specific patterns, which have been shown to have significant 
impact on disease progression. However, they were often studied within the confines of a specific molecular disease and with a 
 
  
 
S232 
limited set of genes in breast cancer. We aim to study the molecular, histological, and clinical correlates of immune checkpoint 
genes signatures by incorporating a complete set of genes with immune checkpoint features. 
Design: We used the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan-Cancer dataset. We extracted clinical, pathology reports, histological 
slides and RNA-seq data using the GDC Data Transfer Tool. We selected 108 immune checkpoint genes based on a review of the 
literature. We performed K-means clustering in STATA. A screeplot was used to determine the optimal number of groups. Each IC 
group was then correlated to clinical, pathology, and histological parameters in SPSS. 
Results: There were 1081 breast cancers in the TCGA. The screeplot highlights the optimal 6 groups for K-means clustering 
(figure 1). Group 1 is defined by NECTIN2, COL2A1, TNFSRF18 overexpression and CD96, CD247 under expression. Group 2 is 
inverted, with CD96 and CD247 overexpression, and NECTIN2, COL2A1, and FGL1 underexpression. Group 3 is defined by 
CCL19 and ADORA2A overexpression, while PVR and ILBP2 are underexpressed. Group 4 is TNFRSF18, COL2A1 
overexpressed, but CD3E and CD2 underexpressed. Group 5 is PVR and ULBP2 overexpressed, and CCL19, PVRIG, KRLK1 
underexpressed. Finally, Group 6 is defined by CD96, CD247 overexpression, and NECT2 and CD276 underexpression. These 
groups were associated with AJCC Stage (p=0.004), fraction of genome altered (p<0.0001), SBR grade (p<0.0001), cribriform 
features (p<0.0001), tumor necrosis (p<0.0001), stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, intratumoral lymphocytes, peritumoral 
lymphocytes (p<0.0001 for all inflammatory features). Fraction of genome altered and hotspot counting of TILs were also significant 
(p<0.0001). Most notably, even though significant trends of immune checkpoint groups are noted within each subtype (table 2), 
these patterns are shared between molecular subgroups.

Conclusions: By approaching all immune checkpoints genes comprehensively, we identify 6 immune checkpoint classes with 
defining clinical, molecular, and histological features. These patterns are significantly associated with specific subtypes, but are still 
shared between all breast cancers regardless of subtype.

Background: Treatment options for breast cancer include the use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy, which can reduce tumor 
volume and potentially limit the extent of surgery. After surgery, pathologists evaluate the tumor response to therapy, which 
 
  
 
S233 
correlates with survival outcomes and can guide further treatment. Methods of measuring tumor response within the breast are well 
defined. However, there is scant literature regarding characterization of metastatic tumor in local lymph nodes (LN) and the factors 
that influence LN tumor response. The objectives of this study are: i) to describe post-neoadjuvant histology of LNs from patients 
with node-positive disease at diagnosis, and ii) to determine the clinicopathologic features that correlate with or predict LN tumor 
response. 
Design: With IRB approval, all post-treatment mastectomy specimens at our institution from Jan 2020 to July 2022 were identified. 
Only cases with LN metastasis at diagnosis confirmed by biopsy or fine needle aspiration were included. H&E slides were reviewed 
to identify histologic findings in LNs. Clinicopathologic features were recorded from the electronic medical record. Statistical 
analysis was performed using the chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. 
Results: Thus far, 33 cases have been evaluated (anticipated ~100 cases). Eleven cases showed a CR in both the LN and the 
breast, with 3 cases with LN CR but residual tumor in the breast. Notably, 3 cases (9%) had a breast CR but residual LN tumor, 
and 8 cases (24%) had greater tumor burden in the LN compared to the breast. Recurrent histologic features of partial or complete 
LN response included pale or dense fibrosis, hemosiderin deposition, capsular thickening, and histiocytic reaction. Three cases 
(9%) showed no definitive histologic evidence of prior metastasis, despite the presence of biopsy site or clip. Breast CR both 
significantly correlated with (p=0.0003) as well as predicted (p=0.001) CR in the LN. Histologic type and grade, hormone receptor 
and HER2 status, type of therapy, and completion of therapy did not significantly correlate with or predict LN CR. 
Conclusions: We found that breast CR correlated with and predicted LN CR. Interestingly, some tumors had a better response in 
the breast than in the LN, raising the possibility of the local environment or genetic changes in the metastasis modifying treatment 
effect. The results of this study will improve pathology practice and deepen our understanding of metastatic tumor response to 
therapy.

Background: The trajectory of breast cancer studies has broadened from solely tumor cell based to being more holistic, inclusive 
of tumor-associated desmoplastic stromata and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Today we understand the components of 
desmoplastic stroma, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and TILs are of clinical significance. Phosphatase and Tensin homolog 
deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) constitutes a negative regulator of the proto-oncogenic phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase 
(PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. Genetic mutations involving PTEN in stromal fibroblasts have been found to accelerate 
extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, innate immune cell infiltration, and promote angiogenesis in breast cancer.  
Design: We compared PTEN mutational status and RNA expression using a TCGA PTEN data cohort. We then analyzed the 
heterogeneity of tumoral microenvironment (TME) in PTEN mutated breast cancer using whole slide images (WSIs) to demonstrate 
the significance of stromal computational signatures using Qupath and our previously developed supervised machine learning (ML) 
methods: proportionated stroma area (PSA), myxoid stromal ratio (MSR) and immune stroma proportion (ISP). Computational 
signatures can be seen in Figure 1.  
Results: Our study included 176 breast cancers with a PTEN mutational frequency of 53%. PTEN mutated breast cancers were 
associated with higher MSR(p<0.001). In total cohort, high PSA, high MSR and low ISP were associated with high pathologic 
stage(p<0.05), lymph node metastasis(p=0.018). Worse disease specific survival was associated with higher PSA(p<0.001) and 
MSR(p<0.001), regardless of PTEN mutational status. In PTEN mutated cohort, high PSA and MSR were associated with high 
pathologic stage(p<0.05). In wild type cohort, PSA showed similar prognostic trend to the PTEN mutated cohort(p=0.001), whereas 
MSR did not show prognostic value(p=0.287) (Table 1). Based on PTEN RNA expressions, tumors which had low PTEN 
expression had higher stage(p=0.03), and amongst all the subtypes, triple negative breast cancers were most commonly 
seen (Figure 2).

Conclusions: The stromal features of PTEN mutated breast cancer is different than that of the wild type. PTEN mutated breast 
cancer is associated with increased MSR. While PSA is quantitatively associated with disease specific survival in wild type and 
mutant breast tumors, MSR acts as a prognostic signature unique to PTEN mutated breast tumors. Our findings must be validated 
in other independent data sets.  
 
248  Ki-67 Evaluation in HR+/HER2- Node-Positive High Risk Early Breast Cancer on Patients 
Eligible for Abemaciclib Using Artificial Intelligence

Disclosures: Sayeeda Yasmeen: None; Al Amin: None; Wiam Bshara: None; Mohamed Desouki: None; Thaer Khoury: None 
Background:  Abemaciclib combined with endocrine therapy have shown benefit for patients with early-stage breast cancer (BC) 
that are hormonal receptor (HR)+/HER2-, node-positive, and high-risk. One of the inclusion criteria is Ki-67≥20% using specific 
clone (PharmDX, Agilent). However, the cost of this antibody is high. The aim of the study is to compare MIB-1 vs. PharmDX clone 
using artificial intelligence. 
Design: Tumors from eligible patients for the treatment are prospectively stained with MIB1 and PharmDx clones as part of our 
internal quality control process. The slides were scanned in Aperio scanning system. The tumor was manually annotated on both 
stains for each case using copy and paste function. A nuclear algorithm was developed and the annotated areas were scored. The 
percentage of each of the staining intensities were recorded. The following pathological datapoints were recorded: histologic type, 
Nottingham grade, ER, PR, HER-2, T stage, N-stage, and treatment (Abemaciclib). Data were analysed including all intensities (0+, 
1+, 2+, and 3+), then the percentage of 1+ was subtracted from the final score. Correlation between the two clones was 
calculated, as a continuous variable as well as using 20% cutoff. 
Results: A total of 31 cases were included (28 ductal, 3 lobular). AJCC TN stage was II in 27 (87.1%) and III in 4 (12.9%). 11 
(35%) patients were eligible for Abemaciclib (Ki-67≥20%) based on PharmDx results and 10 (32%) patients based on MIB1 results. 
Three patients received Abemaciclib. The average for PharmDx and MIB1 were 17%±12 and 15%±11, respectively with correlation 
coefficient (r) of 0.92, p=0.23. When the percentage of 1+ staining was omitted from the final analysis, the average for the PharmDx 
and MIB1 were 14%±12 and 11%±9, respectively (r = 0.91, p=0.23). However, the number of patients eligible for Abemaciclib 
dropped to 8 (25%) when adopting either PharmDx or MIB1 results. No statistically significant difference found between stage II 
and III, or grade 1 or 2 and 3 when Ki67 cutoff of 20% was adopted (p=0.447 and p=0.404). 
Conclusions: In our cohort, PharmDx clone is not superior to MIB1 stain and either of the clones can be used in the clinical 
laboratory to direct therapy with Abemaciclib. Considering the weak staining of Ki-67 (1+) increases the final score and 
consequently the number of eligible patients for Abemaciclib, the benefit from treatment is unclear. Validation of different clones in 
the clinical laboratories is warranted.

Background: Malignant phyllodes tumors (MPT) are aggressive fibroepithelial tumors with high risk for recurrence, metastasis and 
mortality. Distinguishing MPT from metaplastic carcinoma (MBC) or sarcoma can be challenging in cases with malignant stromal 
overgrowth, yet diagnosis of MPT versus MBC has important management and treatment implications. Keratin and P63 expression 
is typical of MBC but has been described in a subset of MPT, although data remains limited. Additional ancillary tools to distinguish 
MPT from MBC are needed. 
Design: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on whole sections or tissue microarrays of 58 MPT for one or more keratins 
(CK) (cocktail, Cam5.2, CK14, CK5/6, CK7, MNF116 and/or CK34βE12), P63, TRPS1, GATA3, CD34, β-catenin (BCAT) and 
HMGA2 and scored in stroma (≤20% focal [F], 21-80% patchy [P], ≥80% diffuse [D]). Results were compared to MBC. For a subset 
of MPT (n=23), next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) was performed using an assay targeting exons of 480 cancer genes. 
 
  
 
S236 
Results: TRPS1 was positive in 68% (21/31) MPT (42% F, 53% P, 5% D), which was similar to MBC (57%, 20/35) (p=.45). 3/3 
MPT with heterologous chondrosarcoma, 4/4 osteosarcoma and 3/4 liposarcoma were TRPS1+. GATA3 was positive in 16% (5/31) 
MPT, each with 1-2+ staining in <5% cells, compared to 54% (25/46) of MBC (p=.001). BCAT was nuclear in 58% (22/38) MPT 
(67% F, 19% P, 14% D) and 53% (20/38) MBC (p=.82). BCAT and GATA3 were also usually F in MBC. CK was expressed in 38% 
(21/56) MPT and was F in all cases. P63 was positive in 67% (32/48) MPT (85% F, 15% P). Of MPT with CK and P63 IHC, 38% 
(18/47) were CK+/P63+, compared to 96% (44/46) MBC (p<.001). The remaining MPT were CK-/P63+ (30%), CK+/P63- (6%), or 
CK-/P63- (26%). CD34 was expressed in 60% (29/48) MPT but was negative in 45% CK+ and/or P63+ tumors. Of 17 MPT with CK 
and/or P63 expression that were sequenced, 7 (41%) had pathognomonic MED12 mutations, including 6 of 7 CK+/P63+ and 3 
CD34- tumors. Nuclear HMGA2 was expressed in 77% (24/31) MPT (17% F, 29% P, 54% D). Of CD34- tumors, HMGA2 was 
positive in ≥10% cells in 85% MPT vs 8% (3/40) MBC (p<.001) and in ≥50% cells of 62% (8/13) MPT vs 3% (1/40) MBC (p<.001). 
Conclusions: MPT often express CK and/or P63, although staining is usually focal and co-expression is less common than in 
MBC. NGS can be very useful to confirm the MPT diagnosis in these cases. HMGA2 is a promising marker to distinguish MPT from 
MBC, especially in CD34- cases. TRPS1 and BCAT are less useful. 
 
250  Nuclear Staining for Pan-Trk by Immunohistochemistry Is Highly Specific for Secretory 
Carcinoma: Pan-Trk in Various Subtypes of Breast Carcinoma

Disclosures: Qiqi Ye: None; Cody Han: None; Hui Chen: None; Aysegul Sahin: None; Lei Huo: None; Qingqing Ding: None 
Background: Secretory carcinoma typically harbors a pathognomonic t(12;15)(p13;q25) balanced translocation, resulting in ETV6-
NTRK3 gene fusion. Pan-Trk immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been demonstrated as a sensitive assay (>95%) to detect the 
ETV6-NTRK3 fusion product. A previous study showed focal weak pan-Trk nuclear staining in 10% non-secretory breast 
carcinomas. To further examine the specificity of pan-Trk IHC, we evaluated pan-Trk staining in various subtypes of breast 
carcinoma. 
Design: The study cohort consists of 343 patients with invasive breast carcinoma (IBC) diagnosed between 2011 and 2021, 
including 154 TNBCs (7 secretory carcinomas, 36 metaplastic carcinomas including 12 matrix-producing carcinomas, 5 adenoid 
cystic carcinomas, 5 with apocrine differentiation, and 101 IBCs of no special type), 101 ER-positive/HER2-negative IBCs, and 88 
HER2-positive IBCs. In addition, 6 secretory carcinomas of salivary gland origin were included as positive controls. Pan-Trk IHC 
was performed on whole slide sections of the 13 secretory carcinomas, 5 adenoid cystic carcinomas and 5 apocrine carcinomas, 
and on tissue microarrays of the remaining tumors, using a rabbit monoclonal antibody (clone EPR17341, Abcam) on a Leica 
Bond-Max autostainer. Nuclear staining of any intensity in the invasive carcinoma cells was considered positive.   
Results: All 13 secretory carcinomas of the breast and salivary gland origins exhibited moderate to strong pan-Trk nuclear 
staining. In contrast, no nuclear staining was identified in any of the 336 non-secretory IBCs including 147 cases of different 
subtypes of TNBC, 101 ER positive and 88 HER2 positive IBCs (Table 1).  Focal cytoplasmic pan-Trk staining was observed in 9 
non-secretory IBCs (2.7%), which was considered as nonspecific and negative.

Abbreviations: AdCC-adenoid cystic carcinoma; IBC-invasive breast carcinoma; NST-no special type; MBC-metaplastic carcinoma; 
TNBC-triple negative breast carcinoma.  
Conclusions: Our results indicate that positive nuclear staining for pan-Trk is highly specific for secretory carcinoma. In low to 
intermediate grade invasive breast carcinomas that share histologic features with secretory carcinomas, the addition of pan-Trk to a 
routing panel of ER/PR/HER2 is highly diagnostic. Our results also support that pan-Trk can differentiate secretory carcinoma from 
its triple-negative histological mimics such as adenoid cystic carcinoma, matrix-producing carcinoma and apocrine carcinoma, 
although this finding needs to be validated in larger studies.

Background: Primary neuroendocrine (NE) neoplasms are rare in the breast. In the absence of in situ carcinoma, metastasis from 
other organ systems need to be ruled out first. In addition to widely used GATA3, TRPS1 is a recently identified marker for breast 
origin. It is significantly more sensitive than GATA3, particularly in triple-negative breast carcinomas. In current study, we 
investigated TRPS1 expression in breast neuroendocrine neoplasms, including well differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and 
poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) and compared its expression in neuroendocrine neoplasms in lung, 
gastrointestinal tract and pancreas.  
Design: A total of 81 cases of NE neoplasms were included in our study cohort, including 38 breast cases (29 ER positive NET, 9 
triple negative NEC), 18 lung cases (5 typical carcinoid, 7 atypical carcinoid, and 6 NEC), 13 gastrointestinal cases (10 NET, 3 
NEC), and 12 pancreatic cases (9 NET, 3 NEC).  Slides were subjected to immunohistochemical staining using rabbit monoclonal 
TRPS1 antibody (1:2000, clone EPR16171, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and mouse monoclonal GATA3 antibody (1:600, clone L50-
823, Cell Marque, Rocklin, CA). Only nuclear staining was considered as positive. The immunoreactivity scores were calculated 
semi-quantitively and categorized as negative (<1%), low positive (1-10%), intermediate positive (11-50%), and high positive 
(>50%). 
Results: TRPS1 exhibited moderate to strong expression in all 29 breast NETs (100%) (Table 1). Two of 9 (22%) breast NECs 
showed weak (1 case) to moderate (1 case) staining. All 29 breast NETs were also strongly positive for GATA3 (100%), but none 
of the 9 NECs expressed GATA3. Not surprisingly, no TRPS1 staining was found in all 18 lung and 12 pancreatic NE neoplasms. 
Among 13 gastrointestinal NE neoplasms, only 1 NEC showed scattered low positivity (<10%) for TRPS1.  
Table 1 TRPS1 expression in neuroendocrine neoplasms of breast and other organs (n=81). 
 
Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that TRPS1 is universally expressed in mammary NET, and it is a good marker to 
differentiate primary mammary NET from metastatic NET of other organs, including lung, gastrointestinal and pancreas. There is a 
limited utility of TRPS1 in differentiating mammary NEC from NEC of other organ systems. Clinical radiographic correlation is 
paramount in diagnosing primary NEC of the breast.

Background: Evaluation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression is an essential prognostic and predictive 
parameter in breast cancer. HER2 assessment by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is reported as negative (0 or 1+), equivocal (2+), or 
positive (3+). HER2 low breast cancers account for approximately 50% of all breast cancers, including those with an IHC score of 
1+ and those with an IHC score of 2+ and negative amplification by FISH. Recent approval of fam-trastuzumab-deruxtecan-nxki for 
use in a subset of HER2 low breast cancers has increased the diagnostic importance of distinguishing IHC 0 from IHC 1+ cases, as 
 
  
 
S238 
this distinction now carries an actionable clinical difference. This study aims to determine whether quantitative image analysis (QIA) 
of low HER2 IHC score is more accurate than manual pathologist scoring. 
Design: A retrospective review identified 157 invasive breast carcinomas (167 HER2 slide assessments) where QIA scored HER2 
IHC slides as HER2 negative (0 or 1+). All IHC slides were blindly reviewed by two fellowship-trained breast pathologists who 
reached a consensus on "true" HER2 IHC status. "True" HER2 IHC score was compared to QIA-assigned HER2 IHC score and 
both pathologists with and without access to QIA-assigned HER2 IHC score. When available, HER2 FISH results were included for 
comparison. 
Results: QIA-assigned HER2 IHC score as well as pathologist-assigned HER2 IHC score, with QIA access, agreed with the final 
"true" designation of HER2 negative versus HER2 low positive score in 92% of cases (153/167), whereas pathologist-assigned 
HER2 IHC score, with no QIA access, agreed with the "true" designation in 84% of cases (141/167). Disagreements with the "true" 
interpretations were considered false positive (FP) reads by both the QIA (7%) and the pathologist with no QIA access (11%), 
whereas the pathologist-assigned HER2 IHC score with QIA access has the least FP reads (5%). In discordant cases where the 
"true" IHC interpretation was considered 2+, additional HER2 FISH was negative in 86% of cases(6 of 7). Rereview demonstrated 
that a common cause of FP QIA-reads was the inadvertent inclusion of DCIS in the analysis.

Conclusions: Quantitative image analysis is a helpful diagnostic support tool for pathologists that improves standardization of low 
positive HER2 IHC scoring. QIA assessment of HER2 IHC demonstrated excellent concordance with consensus pathologist 
opinion and reliably discriminated between HER2 low positive and negative cases.

Background: Invasive lobular carcinomas (ILCs) are typically characterized by loss of E-cadherin expression due to bi-allelic 
inactivation of the CDH1 gene. A subset of breast cancers displays a single cell infiltrative growth pattern similar to classical ILCs 
and yet, in contrast to classical ILCs, they retain diffuse strong membranous E-cadherin reactivity and membranous p120 
expression (Figure 1). We refer to such cases as “lobular-like invasive ductal carcinoma” (LLIDC). The study aims to explore (1) if 
such cases show biallelic inactivation of CDH1 similar to classical ILCs; (2) whether they exhibit clinical-pathological features 
comparable to classical ILCs or invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type (IDC). 
Design: LLIDC cases (n=166) were analyzed and compared with classical ILC (n=104) and grade-matched IDC (n=100) regarding 
clinical-pathologic and radiological characteristics, survival outcomes, and prognostic/predictive factors. An exploratory, hypothesis 
generating analysis of the genomic features of 14 randomly selected LLIDCs and classical ILCs (7 from each category) was 
performed utilizing an FDA-authorized targeted capture assay. 
Results: LLIDC displayed an underestimation of tumor size on imaging and frequent positive margins on first resection similar to 
ILC; however, revealed a higher rate of lymphovascular invasion similar to IDC and an intermediate pathologic tumor size between 
ILC and IDC. Survival outcomes of all groups were similarly influenced by traditional prognostic factors and the multivariable 
prognostic score of Magee Equation 2 (ME2). Sequencing analysis revealed that all classical ILCs harbored 16q loss-of-
heterozygosity (LOH) and CDH1 mutations (7/7); however, 5 of the 7 LLIDCs did not harbor CDH1 mutations or genomic 
rearrangements (Figure 2). CDH1 mutations were identified in the other 2 LLIDCs: one with a subclonal CDH1 in-frame indel 
mutation coupled with LOH (this case showed focal areas of E-cadherin membranous loss on re-review), and the other harboring a 
complex in-frame indel with subclonal LOH that had a negligible impact on protein structure. 
Figure 1 - 253 
 
 
 
  
 
S240 
Figure 2 - 253 
 
Conclusions: Despite the histologic similarities, LLIDCs differ from classic ILCs based on the lack of CDH1 bi-allelic inactivation 
and the retained membranous E-cadherin/p120 catenin expression. LLIDCs have clinical-pathologic features intermediate between 
classical ILC and IDC. Further studies are required to ascertain the cause of the discohesiveness of LLIDC cells.

Background: H3K27me3 is a histone trimethylation modification observed on the transcriptional suppressor, polycomb repressive 
complex 2 (PRC2). H3K27me3 loss occurs in the setting of PRC2 inactivation, which results in activated transcription and tumor 
progression. H3K27me3 loss by immunohistochemistry may be a diagnostic adjunct for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor 
(MPNST) among spindle cell neoplasm, but loss is seen in other tumors including melanoma. MPNST is among the differential 
diagnosis of spindle cell tumors in the axilla, but to our knowledge, H3K27me3 labeling has not previously been evaluated in 
primary breast tumors. 
Design: H3K27me3 immunohistochemistry was performed on previously constructed tissue microarrays of invasive breast 
carcinomas and fibroepithelial lesions. Labeling was scored as positive (retained), variably positive (retained), and negative (lost; 
0% labeling). Non-neoplastic cells including epithelium and lymphocytes served as positive internal controls. 91 evaluable primary 
breast carcinomas consisted of 28 basal-like triple negative breast carcinomas (TNBC), 11 non-basal TNBC, 19 ER+/HER2-, 6 
ER+/HER2+, and 13 ER-/HER2+ carcinomas and 15 metaplastic carcinomas. 41 evaluable fibroepithelial lesions consisted of 31 
phyllodes tumors (14 malignant, 9 borderline, 8 benign) and 10 fibroadenomas. H3K27me3 labeling was compared to Sox10 
labeling, previously reported for all tumors (Human Pathol. 2013;44:959-65). 
Results: Complete H3K27me3 loss was observed in 8 (9%) of invasive carcinomas, including 5 (18%) basal-like TNBC, 1 (7%) 
metaplastic carcinoma, 1 (5%) ER+/HER2- carcinoma, and 1 (8%) ER-/HER2+ carcinoma. H3K27me3 loss was more frequent in 
phyllodes tumors (29%, p=0.0128), with loss in 5 (36%) malignant, 3 (33%) borderline, and 1 (13%) benign phyllodes tumors. 
 
  
 
S241 
H3K27me3 loss was not observed in non-basal TNBC, ER+/HER2+ carcinomas, or fibroadenomas. The majority (80%) of invasive 
carcinomas with H3K27me3 loss also displayed Sox10 labeling, compared to none of the phyllodes tumors (p=0.0294). 
Conclusions: H3K27me3 loss occurs in malignant spindle cell lesions of the breast, including metaplastic carcinoma and phyllodes 
tumors. Half of breast carcinomas with H3K27me3 loss also display Sox10 positivity, which further overlaps with the 
immunophenotype of MPNST. H3K27me3 loss alone cannot be used to support the diagnosis of MPNST in the breast or axilla, and 
labeling should be interpreted in the context of a targeted immunopanel, tumor morphology and clinical history.

Disclosures: Sara Zadeh: None; Jinbo Fan: None; Robin LeGallo: None; Eli Williams: None; Anne Mills: None 
Background: While ETV6-NTRK3 translocations are well-established in secretory breast carcinoma, recent studies have shown 
other NTRK gene rearrangements in rare (<0.2%) non-secretory breast carcinomas.  This molecular abnormality is of considerable 
clinical interest due to the potential vulnerability of these tumors to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibition, with response rates of >50% 
described in studies of solid tumors bearing this molecular signature.  Pan-TRK immunohistochemistry is increasingly enlisted to as 
a screen for translocations involving NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3, however expression rates have not been well-studied in non-
secretory breast carcinoma. 
Design: Tissue microarrays containing 285 non-secretory breast carcinomas were stained with pan-TRK 
immunohistochemistry.  Immunoexpression was evaluated as positive or negative based on the presence of any staining.  Positive 
cases were scored by intensity (1+, 2+, 3+) and extent (% tumor cells staining), and the cellular compartment staining was 
recorded (membranous, cytoplasmic, or nuclear). 
Results: Six (2%) of breast carcinomas expressed pan-TRK.  The average patient age was 57 (range: 44-77) (See Table). All were 
HER2-negative invasive ductal carcinomas; five were ER-positive, one was triple-negative.  All positive cases showed 
membranous pan-Trk expression with one case also showing cytoplasmic staining; no nuclear staining was appreciated.  Pan-Trk 
positivity extent ranged from 5-80%, with intensity from 1-2+; no cases showed strong (3+) expression.  In the three cases with an 
associated intraepithelial component, pan-TRK expression was present in both the in situ and invasive tumor.

Conclusions: Pan-Trk immunohistochemical expression is uncommon in non-secretory breast cancer and may represent a useful 
screen for underlying NTRK gene rearrangements.  The overall low rate of positivity suggests that enlisting this immunostain will 
not result in unnecessarily triaging large numbers of cases to molecular testing. Future studies correlating pan-TRK expression 
patterns with NTRK status are needed.

Background: Recent clinical trials have demonstrated significantly improved survival from novel therapeutic compounds, 
particularly the new HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), in a subset of patients with “HER2-low” breast cancer. The 
 
  
 
S242 
FDA recently approved the first targeted therapy for unresectable and metastatic HER2-low breast cancers, defined as HER2 IHC 
scores of 1+ or 2+ with negative ISH results. HER2-low breast cancers are not well characterized, and further studies are needed. 
Design: We identified 314 consecutive cases of invasive breast cancers with complete clinical and pathological data from 1/1/2019 
to 4/31/2019 by retrospective search of the pathology information system at the Cleveland Clinic. We studied the incidence, clinical 
and pathological characteristics in the HER2-low group and HER2-negative group (IHC score of 0). HER2 incidence also was 
studied in another 150 patients sent for Oncotype Dx. 
Results: All 314 patients with invasive breast cancer in the study were female. The median patient age was 62 years for both 
Her2-low and Her2-negative groups. According to the HER2 scores by immunochemistry, 29.6% were 0 (93/314), 34.1% were 1+, 
21.7% (68/314) were 2+ with negative FISH, and 14.6% (46/314) were 3+. The HER2-low cases accounted for 55.8% (175/314) of 
all patients. HER2 status in different clinical stages is summarized in table 1. HER2-low breast cancers were predominantly: ductal 
type (70.9%), Nottingham grade 2 (48.6%), ER-positive (89.7%), no LVI (54.9%), clinical stage I (69.7%), underwent partial 
mastectomy (59.4%), and not received adjuvant chemotherapy (61.6%). Compared to the HER2-low group, the HER2-negative 
group had more triple-negative cases (21.5% vs. 10.3%), more clinical stage IV cases (8.6% vs. 4.6%), and more deceased 
patients (10.8% vs. 6.9%). However, when adjusted for ER status, there was no significant difference in the examined variables 
between HER2-low and HER2-negative groups. Among the 150 cases sent for OncotypeDx, 59.3% were HER2-low (89/150), and 
40.7% were HER2-negative (61/150). There is no significant difference between HER2-negative and HER2-low groups; both 
showed similar percentages for cases with scores of 0-10, 11-25, and >25.  
 
 
Figure 1 - 256 
 
Conclusions: HER2-low breast cancers account for a significant part of invasive breast cancer (55.8% in this study). Our study 
provides valuable characteristics from consecutive, real-world patients and helps better understand this newly defined subset of 
breast cancer. 
 
257  The Local Recurrence of DCIS, The Experience from A Single Institution for The Last 20 Years

Background: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) consists of 20% of all breast cancer diagnosed annually in the US. The standard of 
care for DCIS is breast conserving therapy including lumpectomy and radiation therapy. Around 10-20% of DCIS will have local 
recurrence, and half of the recurrence will be invasive cancer. Thus, it is critical to identify subgroup of DCIS patients with features 
 
  
 
S243 
of higher risk for local recurrence. Many studies have shown that positive or close resection margin (<2mm) is the most important 
factor associated with local recurrence. Other factors such as younger age, larger and higher grade tumors are also suggested to 
be associated with recurrence. 
Design: We have identified 509 consecutive cases of DCIS diagnosed and treated in our institution for the last 20 years and 
studied clinical and pathologic features that are associated with local recurrence.  
Results: Among the 509 cases of DCIS, 3.5% (18 cases) were with local recurrence (11 cases recurred as DCIS and 7 cases 
recurred as invasive carcinoma) (Table). The recurrence occurred between 1 and 20 years after the original diagnosis. In our 
cohort of DCIS, the local recurrence is significantly associated with close margin (<2mm), younger patients (<40 years old), and 
lumpectomy.  The recurrence is not significantly associated with high grade ER/PR low (<10% weak staining) or negativity and 
tumor size, although larger tumors are seen more frequently in the recurrence group. Interestingly, we also noted that majority of 
recurrence with invasive carcinoma (6 out of 7 cases) were from DCIS with high nuclear grade.

for DCIS. Margin status is still the most important factor for local recurrence, while younger patients and lumpectomy are at higher 
risk for it.

Background: Squamous cell carcinoma of breast (SCC) is a subtype of metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC). Its 
clinicopathological and molecular features are not well recognized due to its rarity. A better understanding of molecular features 
may lead to better treatment approaches for this type of aggressive tumor. 
 
  
 
S244 
Design: 70 pure SCCs (69.3%, 70/101) and 31 mixed SCCs (30.7%, 31/101) from 2007–2022 in our center were analyzed. In 
mixed cases, the proportion of SCCs was more than 50% in each case. Twelve patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
and the histological response was assessed according to the Miller-Payne (MP) grading system. Seventeen pure cases and three 
mixed cases were sequenced by DIAN (Hangzhou Lab) using a 324-gene platform or in our center by a 520-gene platform with 
licensed technologies. 
Results: All cases were female ranging from 26 to 80 years (median 52 years). The mean diameter of the tumor was 19 (5-140) 
mm and the median disease-free survival (DFS) was 15 (2-116) months. Of the 89 early breast cancer patients, more than two-
thirds (76.1%, 67/88) were stage II or Stage III at the initial diagnosis and ten patients (23.9%, 21/88) had lymph node metastasis. 
Recurrence and/or distant metastasis occurred in 24 patients (27%, 24/90) after 1-49 months’ (median 15 months) follow-up. One 
patient achieved pathological complete remission (pCR) (8%, 1/12) with MP grade 5 and no lymph node metastasis after 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. MP grade of the remaining 11 patients was grade 1 in 3, grade 2 in 6, grade 3 in 1 and grade 4 in 1, all 
of which were non-pCR (92%, 11/12) even though two of them received HER2-targeted therapy. And one of the 2 patients occurred 
bone metastasis during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The most frequently identified pathogenic aberrations were in TP53(75%, 
15/20) and PI-3 kinase pathway(60%,12/20). TERT promoter mutations were identified in 10% (2/20). Other gene alterations 
corelated to chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, cell cycle, metabolism could also be seen in our cohort. 
Figure 1 - 258 
 
Conclusions: Squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is extremely rare and the tumor is usually resistant to conventional 
chemotherapy. Although most of the tumors are triple negative, neoadjuvant therapy should not be given priority in initial treatment 
decisions. Genomic profile using next-generation sequencing can identify clinically meaningful alterations that have the potential to 
guide targeted treatment decisions in patients with primary or metastatic SCC.

Background: To investigate the clinicopathological features associated with the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive 
breast cancer. 
Design: A total of 480 cases of HER2-positive breast cancer who received neoadjuvant therapy, diagnosed at the Department of 
Pathology of Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center from 2015 to 2020, were retrospectively collected. Clinicopathological 
parameters such as age, tumor size, molecular subtype, type of targeted therapy, Ki-67 proliferation index, ER expression level, 
 
  
 
S245 
HER2 immunohistochemical (IHC) expression level, and HER2 amplification status were analyzed to correlate with the efficacy of 
neoadjuvant therapy. 
Results: Among 480 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, 209 achieved pathology complete response (pCR) after 
neoadjuvant therapy, with a pCR rate of 43.5%. 457 patients received chemotherapy plus trastuzumab and 23 patients received 
chemotherapy with trastuzumab and pertuzumab. A total of 198 cases (43.3%) achieved pCR in patients with chemotherapy plus 
trastuzumab, and 11 patients (47.8%) with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab achieved pCR. The pCR rate in the 
latter group was higher, but there was no statistical significance. The results showed that the pCR rate of IHC-HER2 3+ patients 
(49%) was significantly higher than that of IHC-HER2 2+ patients (26.1%) (p﹤0.001). The higher the mean HER2 copy number in 
the FISH assay, the higher the pCR rate was achieved. The expression level of ER was inversely correlated with the efficacy of 
neoadjuvant therapy, and the pCR rate in the ER-positive group (28.2%) was significantly lower than that in the ER-negative group 
(55.8%) (p﹤0.001). The pCR rate (29.1%) of patients with luminal B type was lower than that of HER2 overexpression type 
(55.8%) (p﹤0.001). In addition, higher Ki-67 proliferation index was associated with higher pCR rate (p﹤0.001). The pCR rate was 
the highest in the tumor size ≤ 2 cm group (57.7%), while the pCR rate in the tumor size > 5 cm group was the lowest (31.1%). The 
difference between the groups was significant (p = 0.005).

Conclusions: Multiple clinicopathological features were significantly associated with the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-
positive breast cancer. In-depth exploration of the relationship between these clinicopathological features and the efficacy of 
neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer is of great significance for treatment decision-making and efficacy prediction.

Background: Secretory carcinoma (SC) of the breast is a rare type of triple-negative breast carcinoma that generally confers a 
good prognosis. It histologically resembles SC of the salivary gland and harbors the same genetic mutation, ETV6-NTRK3 gene 
fusion. Recent studies have shown TRPS1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) to be a sensitive and specific marker for triple negative 
breast carcinomas. This study compares results of TRPS1 and the historical marker GATA3 in SC of the breast and salivary gland. 
Design: A total of 11 archival cases of SC were identified at multiple institutions. Of those, 5 were of breast origin and 6 were of 
salivary origin. Each case was studied by both TRPS1 and GATA3 IHC and was evaluated independently by two breast 
pathologists. The IHC slides were scored for percentage of immunoreactive cells as well as the intensity of staining (Table 1). For 
TRPS1 and GATA3, only nuclear staining was counted as positive (Figure 1). 
Results: The patients with a diagnosis of SC of the breast were female (100%) ranging in age from 22 to 78 years. The primary 
site of SC of salivary gland was right parotid gland (50%), left soft palate (16.6%), left submandibular gland (16.6%), and left 
sublingual gland (16.6%). SC of salivary origin patients ranged from 30 to 64 years and were predominantly male (83%). All 
patients with SC of breast showed diffuse and moderate to strong intensity IHC positivity with TRPS1. While immunoreactivity with 
TRPS1 was present in patients with SC of salivary origin, this was less often diffuse and always of low intensity. GATA3 IHC on the 
other hand showed highly variable results in SC of the breast. GATA3 in SC of salivary origin was consistently diffusely and 
strongly positive (Table 1 and Figure 1). The scoring agreement between pathologists was 90% initially and 100% at consensus.

Conclusions: In our cohort, all cases of SC of breast showed diffuse and moderate to strong TRPS1 positivity, while no cases of 
SC of salivary origin showed this pattern. SC of salivary gland was more likely to be diffusely and strongly GATA3 positive. TRPS1 
may be a valuable adjunctive study at confirming SC of breast versus salivary gland primary, and combination of this marker with 
GATA3 may prove helpful. 
 
261  Clinicopathological Characteristics of 22 Cases of Apocrine Encapsulated Papillary Carcinoma

Disclosures: Ke Zuo: None; Xiaoli Xu: None; Rui Bi: None; Ruohong Shui: None; Wentao Yang: None 
Background: Apocrine encapsulated papillary carcinoma (AEPC) is rare, and no more than 10 cases have been reported in 
previous literature. Although it has high level expression of AR and GCPFP15 protein, tumor cells show triple-negative (ER-PR-
HER2-) phenotype. Our study is aimed to explore whether the clinicopathological characteristics of AEPC are different from those 
of classical EPC. 
Design: 22 cases of AEPC were identified in our department since 2014. Clinicopathologic data were reviewed and relevant 
prognosis information was analyzed. 
Results: All of the 22 patients were female, the median age at diagnosis was 61.5 (range: 49-82). Fifteen cases were consultation 
cases and seven cases were diagnosed and treated in our center. For consultation cases, the major concern of the original 
diagnosis was whether the tumor was malignant or not. Histologically, most of the AEPC were cystic with glandular and papillary 
growth pattern. The papillary structures were covered by cells with uniform apocrine differentiation. The degree of cellular atypia 
varied among cases, but no severe atypia was identified. Myoepithelial cells were absent along the papillary structure and the 
periphery of the lesion. Of the 22 AEPC, 13 cases had no stromal invasion, 6 cases had microinvasion (<1mm), and 3 cases had 
frank invasion (1–4mm). Tumor cells were negative for ER, PR and HER2 (0/1+/2+), while diffusely positive for AR and GCDFP15. 
The median Ki-67 proliferation index was 10% (range: 5–20%). Fifteen patients had no postoperative adjuvant therapy, while seven 
patients received either adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. The follow-up information was available in 21 patients. In the 
median follow-up time of 35.5 months (range: 5.4–99.6m), none of the patients experienced recurrence and/or metastasis. 
Figure 1 - 261 
 
Conclusions: For classical EPC, patients generally have a good prognosis and are treated as ductal carcinoma in situ. In our 
study, no recurrence and/or metastasis were observed in all AEPC patients with or without postoperative adjuvant therapy. 
Although the tumor immunophenotype was triple-negative, there were significant differences between AEPC and triple-negative 
breast cancer (TNBC) of no special type. Therefore, the indolent biological behavior of AEPC is different from that of TNBC of no 
special type, but much closer to classical EPC. It might be more appropriate to treat patients with the same strategies for classical 
EPC.
