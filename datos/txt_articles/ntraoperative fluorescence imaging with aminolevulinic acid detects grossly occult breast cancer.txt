Abstract
Background: Re-excision due to positive margins following breast-conserving surgery (BCS) negatively affects
patient outcomes and healthcare costs. The inability to visualize margin involvement is a significant challenge in
BCS. 5-Aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (5-ALA HCl), a non-fluorescent oral prodrug, causes intracellular
accumulation of fluorescent porphyrins in cancer cells. This single-center Phase II randomized controlled trial
evaluated the safety, feasibility, and diagnostic accuracy of a prototype handheld fluorescence imaging device plus
5-ALA for intraoperative visualization of invasive breast carcinomas during BCS.
Methods: Fifty-four patients were enrolled and randomized to receive no 5-ALA or oral 5-ALA HCl (15 or 30 mg/
kg). Forty-five patients (n = 15/group) were included in the analysis. Fluorescence imaging of the excised surgical
specimen was performed, and biopsies were collected from within and outside the clinically demarcated tumor
border of the gross specimen for blinded histopathology.
Results: In the absence of 5-ALA, tissue autofluorescence imaging lacked tumor-specific fluorescent contrast. Both
5-ALA doses caused bright red tumor fluorescence, with improved visualization of tumor contrasted against normal
tissue autofluorescence. In the 15 mg/kg 5-ALA group, the positive predictive value (PPV) for detecting breast
cancer inside and outside the grossly demarcated tumor border was 100.0% and 55.6%, respectively. In the 30 mg/
kg 5-ALA group, the PPV was 100.0% and 50.0% inside and outside the demarcated tumor border, respectively. No
adverse events were observed, and clinical feasibility of this imaging device-5-ALA combination approach was
confirmed.

Introduction
Breast cancer, the most prevalent cancer in women, is
often treated by breast-conserving surgery (BCS) [1, 2]
which aims to completely excise the tumor with clear
margins while preserving the maximum amount of
healthy tissue. Cancer visualization under standard white
light (WL) operating room conditions is difficult due to
low cancer-to-normal tissue contrast, resulting in posi-
tive margins which are related to greater risk of local re-
currence (LR) [3–6], inferior outcomes (complications,
stress, poor cosmesis) [7], adjuvant delay [8], increased
healthcare costs [9–11], and lower disease-specific sur-
vival [12]. Furthermore, incomplete resection requires
reoperation in 20–70% of patients [2, 6, 13–20]. Thus,
reducing positive margin rates is a major goal in BCS
[21] and is an internationally recognized quality indica-
tor for treatment [7, 22].
Currently, BCS best practice uses WL visualization,
palpation,
specimen
radiography,
and
intraoperative
histopathology to guide resection. These techniques are
lengthy (~ 20 min) [23], limited by inaccurate co-
localization of positive margins on the excised tissue to
the surgical bed [24] and variably impact outcomes [23].
Adaptation of standard medical imaging technologies for
operating room use (MRI [25], ultrasound [25, 26], PET/
CT [25]), and emerging intraoperative tumor detection
technologies for BCS, both non-optical and optically en-
abled, are either at the preclinical stage or are not widely
adopted due to practical limitations. Thus, there is a
clinical need for an alternative, safe, practical, cost-
sensitive, and real-time intraoperative imaging technol-
ogy for surgeons and pathologists to visualize occult ma-
lignancy in excised specimens and surgical cavities
during index BCS.
Fluorescence imaging using an intraoperative instru-
ment plus an exogenous tumor-specific imaging agent
may fulfill this need by enhancing tumor tissue contrast
and facilitating the detection of grossly occult disease.
Intraoperative fluorescence imaging for detection of car-
cinoma has been demonstrated in clinical trials for sev-
eral tumor types using visible and near-infrared (NIR)
contrast agents [27–30]. However, the instrumentation
involves large, costly cart-based systems that are imprac-
tical for BCS since they do not fulfill the surgeon’s need
to interrogate both the surgical specimen and cavity. To
address this, we developed a handheld fluorescence im-
aging device (Portable Real-time Optical Detection Iden-
tification and Guide for Intervention, PRODIGI) for
real-time intraoperative fluorescence imaging of excised
breast specimens and the surgical cavity. PRODIGI is
clinically safe and has demonstrated clinical utility in
other medical applications [31–33]. The device com-
bines consumer-grade imaging sensor technology with
miniature light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and multiband
optical filtering to capture high-resolution WL and
fluorescence digital images and videos. PRODIGI’s mul-
tiband optical filter allows for imaging of porphyrins, in-
cluding protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), which fluoresces red
(peak emission at 635 nm wavelength) [34, 35] when ex-
cited by violet-blue light (~ 400–410 nm). PpIX is a me-
tabolite of the prodrug 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA),
an endogenous non-protein amino acid involved in
heme biosynthesis in mammalian cells. Unlike contrast
agents that are receptor-targeted or enzyme-activated,
PpIX is not affected by suboptimal biodistribution and
tumor penetration, heterogenous target receptor/enzyme
expression [29], and high background fluorescence [29,
36].
Delivered systemically, 5-ALA is taken up by cells
throughout the body where it is converted into heme. In
aberrant cells, such as cancer cells, defects in heme bio-
synthesis cause accumulation of PpIX [35, 37–42], enab-
ling real-time visualization. 5-ALA is widely known for
its clinical use in photodynamic diagnosis [43–55] and
therapy [34, 49, 56, 57] of premalignant and malignant
disease. Large clinical trials have demonstrated the safety
and clinical utility of 5-ALA-based fluorescence image-
guided surgery (FIGS) for malignant glioma [58–61],
which led to the approval of oral 5-ALA hydrochloride
(HCl) for FIGS of high-grade glioma in approximately
40 countries, including the USA [62]. Other clinical
studies support 5-ALA for the visualization of malignant
tissue in the bladder [44], gastrointestinal tract [50], oral
cavity [51, 52], lung [47, 55], and female genital tract
[49, 53, 54]. 5-ALA has a well-established safety profile,
which is highlighted in the Gleolan Prescribing Informa-
tion for glioma patients where pyrexia, hypotension,
nausea, and vomiting are reported to have occurred in >
1% of patient’s in the week following surgery and chills,
photosensitivity reaction, solar dermatitis, hypotension,

abnormal liver function test, and diarrhea are reported
to have occurred in < 1% of patients in the 6 weeks after
surgery [62]. Only one other clinical study (in 2001) ex-
plored the utility of 5-ALA (40 mg/kg bodyweight (BW))
for detecting breast cancers in a non-randomized study
of 16 patients, although the results were exploratory and
limited to imaging surgical specimens only [48]. Since
then, no follow-up studies on the application of 5-ALA
in breast cancer imaging have been published.
In this report, we present the results of a single-center
non-interventional Phase II randomized controlled trial
(RCT) designed to characterize the imaging performance
of our handheld imaging device with two doses (15 and
30 mg/kg BW) of 5-ALA HCl versus no tumor contrast
in patients with invasive breast cancer undergoing lump-
ectomy or mastectomy. Two doses (15 or 30 mg/kg BW)
of 5-ALA HCl were administered to evaluate the mini-
mum dosage for sufficient tumor-to-normal tissue fluor-
escence contrast obtained using the PRODIGI device.
The doses selected are “on either side” of the FDA-
approved dose for glioma (20 mg/kg) [62] and are based
on previous clinical studies validating safety at ≤60 mg/
kg [63–65], tumor enhancement as low as 10 mg/kg [59,
60, 64], and improved tumor-to-normal tissue contrast
with increased doses [60, 64]. The primary objective was
to determine measures of diagnostic accuracy (positive
and negative predictive values, sensitivity, specificity, and
diagnostic odds ratio) of visualization of breast tumors
in surgical specimens using PRODIGI in combination
with 5-ALA HCl, with ex vivo biopsy-based histology as
the gold standard. The secondary objective was to evalu-
ate the feasibility and safety of the PRODIGI device for
intraoperative imaging of the surgical cavity following
resection. Finally, we confirm the safety and technical
feasibility and discuss the future clinical adoptability of
PRODIGI
plus
5-ALA
HCl
to
improve
tumor
visualization during BCS.
Materials and methods
Study design
The Princess Margaret Cancer Center (PMCC; Toronto,
Canada), University Health Network (UHN) Research
Ethics Board (REB#10-0633-CE) and Mount Sinai Hos-
pital (MSH; Toronto, Canada) Research Ethics Board
(REB#13-0155E) approved the clinical protocol for this
study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01837225). All
subjects provided written informed consent and were
randomized to receive no 5-ALA, 15, or 30 mg/kg 5-
ALA ~ 3 h before surgery (2–4 h prior to anesthesia). A
randomization table was generated before study initi-
ation
using
the
List
Randomization
tool
from
RANDOM.org and stored in a locked cabinet. The pri-
mary objective of this RCT was to determine measures
of
diagnostic
accuracy
of
PpIX
fluorescence
for
visualizing breast tumors in patients receiving oral 5-
ALA HCl. Participants underwent standard breast can-
cer surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) by one of two
study surgeons (A.M.E., W.L.L.), followed by fluores-
cence imaging of the cavity and surgical specimen by a
researcher, and collection of biopsies from the surgical
specimen by the pathologist’s assistant (PA) (V.S., M.S.,
F.M.). The first 5 patients randomized per group under-
went ex vivo imaging of the surgical specimen only. Im-
aging of the surgical cavity and specimen was performed
in the remaining 10 patients/group. Neither the surgeon
(A.M.E., W.L.L.), researcher, nor PA (V.S., M.S., F.M.)
were blinded to allocation.
Imaging was performed en face of the external surface
of the intact surgical specimens followed by the serially
sliced specimen (1–1.5 cm thickness/slice). Biopsies were
collected from two spatially distinct areas of specimen
slices: (i) inside the grossly demarcated primary tumor
border near the center of the tumor and (ii) outside the
grossly demarcated primary tumor border (see Study
Workflow, Supplementary Fig. 1). Biopsies were col-
lected from areas of red and non-red fluorescence tissue
to determine the accuracy of fluorescence visualization
of clinically obvious (inside the tumor border) and clin-
ically occult (outside the tumor border) disease. A path-
ologist (S.J.D.) blinded to fluorescence imaging results
evaluated biopsies for the presence of cancer (including
invasive and in situ disease). Surgeons (A.M.E., W.L.L.)
and pathologists (S.J.D.) did not modify their conven-
tional margin assessment based on fluorescence imaging
results or use fluorescence imaging to guide resection.
Study population
Patients were screened for eligibility by their breast can-
cer surgeon (A.M.E., W.L.L.) during their pre-operative
clinic visits. The inclusion criteria were as follows: ≥18
years of age, female, diagnosed with invasive breast can-
cer, primary tumor measuring ≥2 cm in diameter based
on diagnostic imaging, consented to standard surgeries
for primary invasive breast cancer with/without axillary
procedure (axillary dissection or sentinel node biopsy),
and consented to banking of core biopsies with UHN
tissue bank. The exclusion criteria were as follows: pre-
operative therapy (chemotherapy, endocrine therapy,
radiotherapy), history of photosensitivity, liver disease or
recurrent disease, pregnant, tumor diameter < 2 cm at
grossing (as stipulated by the pathology department),
unable to consent, or refused tissue banking. Seventy pa-
tients were consented to participate in the study, of
which 14 were withdrawn prior to randomization and 9
after randomization (Fig. 1) due to the following reasons:
tumor diameters measuring < 2 cm at the time of gross
examination, change of treatment plan to include pre-
operative chemotherapy or surgery at a hospital other

than PMCC or patient choice. Data from withdrawn par-
ticipants was not included in the patient demographics
or data analysis.
5-ALA HCl doses and administration
5-ALA
HCl
(generously
provided
by
photonamic
GmbH and Co. KG, Pinneberg, Germany) was dis-
solved in tap water and administered orally by a
study nurse 2–4 h before surgery in patients random-
ized to the 15 or 30 mg/kg BW 5-ALA groups. Pre-
cautionary measures were taken to prevent adverse
events related to 5-ALA, including monitoring for
symptoms related to skin photosensitivity [63–65]
and providing homecare instructions to minimize ex-
posure to sunlight and/or bright indoor light for at
least 48 h following 5-ALA ingestion. Patients were
provided with SPF 60 sunscreen and instructed how
to use it prior to leaving the hospital. Patient re-
cords were reviewed for any adverse events reported
at the post-surgical follow-up with their surgeon
(A.M.E., W.L.L.).
Handheld fluorescence imaging device
PRODIGI (Supplementary Fig. 2) is a handheld fluores-
cence imaging device prototype developed by our group
for clinical fluorescence imaging applications [60, 61].
PRODIGI emits 405 nm light with an optical power
density of 1.14 mW/cm2at a 10-cm imaging distance.
Fluorescence imaging was performed with all room
lights turned off and intrinsic camera sensor settings
(e.g., ISO: Auto; Exposure Value: 0; Macro: Auto) were
kept the same across all image acquisition sessions. The
device was cleaned with disinfecting wipes between uses.
Images were transferred to a designated password-
protected personal computer after each imaging session
for storage and analysis. The device was Canadian Stan-
dards Association certified for electrical safety prior to
use and exempt from Health Canada Investigational
Testing Authorization requirements.
In vivo fluorescence imaging of the surgical cavity
The technical feasibility, safety, and integration into the
clinical workflow of in vivo imaging of the surgical cavity
immediately following lumpectomy or mastectomy was
Fig. 1 CONSORT diagram. Patients with tumors measuring < 2 cm (greatest dimension) at specimen gross examination were excluded from the
analysis because biopsies could not be collected from inside the demarcated tumor border. One case was excluded because of insufficient time
to complete data collection prior to initiating formalin fixation of the specimen

examined using PRODIGI in n = 30 (n = 10/group) pa-
tients. The device and its power supply cable were cov-
ered in a disposable sterile plastic drape (Laser Arm
Drape, Cardinal Health, 29-59029) using an instrument
draping protocol to maintain sterility. Small neodymium
magnets permanently embedded in the device were at-
tached to four autoclaved magnets on the exterior of the
drape thereby holding the drape flush against the emis-
sion filter. The draping protocol complied with the
safety requirements of the International Electrotechnical
Commission IEC 60601-1 such that heat generated from
the LEDs was safely dissipated within the drape during
use. Real-time still and video WL and fluorescence im-
aging of the cavity was performed by a member of the
research
team
with
the
assistance
of
the
surgeon
(A.M.E., W.L.L.), who manipulated the cavity to expose
the entire inner surface of the cavity. Overhead room
lights and surgical lights were turned off during fluores-
cence imaging.
Ex vivo specimen preparation, image acquisition, and
interpretation
Following breast cancer surgery, surgical specimens
were sent to pathology where WL and fluorescence
images were acquired of all anatomical surfaces of the
intact specimen. Margins were painted by the PA
(V.S., M.S., F.M.) using a standardized margin inking
schema (different colors for different margins) follow-
ing fluorescence imaging of the intact specimen, to
avoid ink artefacts. Specimens were serially sliced
grossly (“bread-loafed”) [66] and the slice containing
the
largest
clinically
discernable
cross-sectional
of
tumor was laid open. A digital WL image of the
complete slice was transferred to a tablet computer
(Galaxy Note, Model GT N8010, Samsung). WL im-
ages were indelibly marked by the PA (V.S., M.S.,
F.M.) using Photoshop (Adobe) to demarcate the clin-
ically identifiable primary tumor border based on
visualization and palpation. In cases of nonpalpable
cancers or tumors with an ill-defined edge, no pri-
mary tumor border was marked. Fluorescence images
were
collected
to
ensure
each
WL
image
had
a
spatially colocalized fluorescence image. Specimen im-
aging was performed with the device held ~ 10 cm
from the tissue. For scale, a white specimen sticker
was used during imaging. Images were date stamped
and saved for analysis. Fluorescence images were ac-
quired under low light, consistent across imaging ses-
sions.
In
some
patients,
additional
WL
and
fluorescence images of adjacent specimen slices and
slices
identified
by
the
PA
(V.S.,
M.S.,
F.M.)
as
“tumor-free”
were
collected.
WL
and
fluorescence
image acquisition took < 1 s and 1–2 s, respectively
per surface or specimen slice. Specimens were placed
in formalin for fixation within 1 h of surgical excision
as per clinical practice.
Tissue biopsy collection and analysis
Research tissue biopsies were collected by study research
staff from ex vivo specimens of all 45 patients (n = 141
biopsies) for gold standard histological evaluation by the
study pathologist (S.J.D.) blinded to the imaging results.
A 2- or 4-mm diameter punch biopsy device (Cat #12-
460-409 and -399, Thermo Fisher Scientific, New Hamp-
shire, USA) was used. Biopsies were collected from in-
side and outside the tumor border. Outside the border,
fluorescence imaging was used to target biopsy collec-
tion in areas with red or no-red PpIX fluorescence. A
minimum of 1 biopsy (inside the tumor border, to retain
sufficient carcinoma for clinical diagnosis) and a max-
imum of 4 biopsies (tumor plus additional biopsies, to
ensure specimen fixation commenced within an accept-
able ischemia time) were collected per specimen (total
biopsies = 141). Most biopsies (n = 134) were fixed in
neutral buffered formalin, paraffin-embedded, sectioned
(4 μm), and H&E stained. A subset of tumor biopsies (n
= 7) were placed in a tissue cassette, immersed in opti-
mal cutting temperature compound, flash frozen in li-
quid
nitrogen,
and
protected
from
light
using
established methods before fluorescence microscopy
visualization of the cellular localization of PpIX fluores-
cence. All H&E sections were evaluated by the blinded
study pathologist (S.J.D.) for invasive and/or in situ can-
cer. When required, immunohistochemical stains (High
Molecular Weight Keratin, Estrogen Receptor, Calponin,
Smooth Muscle Myosin, CAM5.2, P63) were performed
on serial sections according to standard institutional
staining protocols. We used a custom quantitative fluor-
escence (qF) system [38] to characterize the fluorescence
spectra between 500 and 800 nm emission (405 nm exci-
tation) and measure local tissue PpIX concentration at
locations within the primary tumor border before biopsy.
Tissue fluorescence spectra were obtained by a fiberoptic
probe connected to a bench-top spectrometer, and a val-
idated algorithm was used to calculate absolute PpIX
concentrations [38].
Ex vivo tissue fluorescence microscopy
A subset of biopsies (n = 7) from inside the primary
tumor border were processed by frozen section for fluor-
escence microscopy. Frozen biopsies were collected from
n = 4 low-dose patient specimens and n = 3 high-dose
patient specimens. Frozen biopsies were cut serially into
8 μm frozen tissue sections and placed on glass micros-
copy slides for confocal fluorescence microscopy before
histological staining. Frozen sections were wrapped in
tin foil to limit light exposure and stored at −80 °C until
fluorescence microscopy was performed. Serial sections

Page 5 of 20
were cut from each biopsy for confocal microscopy,
H&E, and additional staining, as required. Slides were
imaged with the Nikon A1R resonance scanning con-
focal fluorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc.
Melville, NY, U.S.A.) using 405 nm excitation, a 525/50-
nm emission filter for background tissue autofluores-
cence (AF) and a 600/50 + 685/70-nm emission filter for
PpIX fluorescence. Resonance mode was used to scan
frozen tissue sections rapidly (30 or 420 frames/second),
to optimize image acquisition settings and minimize
photobleaching of PpIX fluorescence. Fluorescence im-
ages were acquired using Galvano scanning at 1024 ×
1024 pixels.
Immediately following fluorescence microscopy, frozen
sections were fixed in formalin and stained with H&E.
Two additional serial sections of the same sample were
stained using standard protocols with Masson’s tri-
chrome (MT) to identify connective tissues and Oil Red
O (ORO) to identify adipocytes. This enabled spatial
correlation between fluorescent tissue features in the
frozen section and tissue-specific staining for histology.
Nikon NIS Elements C software (Nikon Instruments Inc.
Melville, NY, USA) was used to convert fluorescence mi-
croscopy images to TIF format and Aperio ImageScope
was used to export corresponding images of H&E, MT,
and ORO-stained tissues to JPEG image format. Fluores-
cence H&E, MT, and ORO-stained tissue section images
were examined by the study pathologist (S.J.D.).
Image analysis of stained tissue sections
Stained biopsy tissue sections from 5-ALA patient speci-
mens were digitalized using the Aperio Scanscope XT
whole-slide scanner (Aperio Technologies, Inc., Vista,
CA, USA). HALO Image Analysis software v2.0.1145.14
(Indica Labs, Albuquerque, NM, USA) was used to
quantify the area and relative amount tissue types (can-
cer, connective, adipose) within biopsies histologically
confirmed to contain cancer cells based on pathologist
(S.J.D.)-blinded examination. A blinded researcher used
the HALO Classifier Module to train the proprietary
machine-learning algorithm to identify and differentiate
tissues based on differences in color, texture, and con-
textual features. Previous work has validated this soft-
ware
for
detecting
pathology
in
human
paraffin-
embedded tissue [67]. Up to four different classifiers
were defined per tissue section: carcinoma, connective,
adipose tissue, and non-tissue area (background). Areas
corresponding
to
each
tissue
type
were
manually
highlighted to provide training inputs and refined for
each section with additional training inputs to improve
accuracy. Cancer cells, stromal tissue, and adipocytes
were identified with the aid of the Classifier Module and
the area (mm2) for each tissue type as well as the total
biopsy slice area was obtained based on pixel algorithms.
The percentage of cancer tissue (area of cancer pixels/
area of tissue pixels) and connective tissue (area con-
nective tissue pixels/area of tissue pixels) was calculated,
as well as the ratio of tumor over connective tissue (area
of tumor pixels/area of connective tissue pixels). Aperio
ImageScope (Aperio Technologies, Inc., Vista, CA, USA)
was used to export images of H&E-stained sections in
JPEG format for publication.
Analyses of clinical fluorescence images
Fluorescence images of serially sliced specimens were
analyzed using Matlab v2018b (The MathWorks, Inc.,
Massachusetts, USA). Slices annotated with the primary
tumor border were included (n = 14, control; n = 11,
low dose; n = 12, high dose). During gross examination,
the PA (V.S., M.S., F.M.) identified the primary tumor of
8 specimens as having ill-defined borders and the images
were not annotated with the clinically demarcated pri-
mary tumor border. These 8 specimens were excluded
from this analysis. JPEG images were converted from
RGB to XYZ format using an inbuilt Matlab function.
Regions of interest corresponding to the primary tumor
and normal tissue were defined based on the clinically
demarcated primary tumor border. Background areas
without tissue or that included the scale bar sticker, and
areas outside the primary tumor that had histologically
confirmed cancer were excluded. The average X, Y, and
Z values for all pixels in the primary tumor ROI and
normal tissue ROI were calculated, converted into (x,
y)tumor and (x, y)normal coordinates, and plotted on a CIE
chromaticity graph. The Euclidean distance between (x,
y)tumor and (x, y)normal, which corresponds to a perceived
difference in color according to the MacAdams diagram
(Supplementary Fig. 3), was calculated per image using
an inbuilt Matlab program. The average ± standard devi-
ation Euclidean distance for images from patients in
each group was compared.
Statistical analysis
Specimen fluorescence images and corresponding re-
search tissue biopsies (n = 93) from patients treated with
5-ALA were used to estimate the PPV, NPV, sensitivity,
specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of the device
plus 5-ALA to differentiate between breast cancer and
healthy tissues. The exact method (Pearson-Clopper)
was used to calculate the 95% confidence intervals of the
estimated PPV, NPV, sensitivity and specificity, and nor-
mal approximation on logarithmic scale was used for the
confidence intervals of the DOR. True positives were bi-
opsies from a PpIX red fluorescence area, histologically
confirmed as cancer cell positive (invasive and/or in
situ), whereas false positives were biopsies from a red
fluorescence area, histologically confirmed as cancer cell
negative. True negatives were biopsies from a non-

sies from a non-red fluorescence area, histologically con-

probability of cancer being present in an area of tissue
identified as positive for PpIX red fluorescence, and
NPV is defined as the probability of cancer being absent
in an area of tissue identified as negative for PpIX red
fluorescence. DOR is a measure of test performance de-
fined as the ratio of the odds of detecting red PpIX
fluorescence if cancer is present relative to the odds of
detecting red PpIX fluorescence if cancer is not present.
Scatterplots and Mann-Whitney tests were used to com-
pare proportions of cancer and connective tissue, and
the ratio of cancer and connective tissue pixels between

Results
Subject demographics
Forty-five females (29–83 years old) undergoing lump-
ectomy (n = 29) or mastectomy (n = 16) for primary
ductal (n = 37), lobular (n = 7), or mixed (n = 1) in-
vasive carcinoma at the Princess Margaret Cancer
Center (PMCC, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) between
August 2013–August 2018 were included in the ana-
lysis (Table 1). Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to re-
ceive no 5-ALA (control), 15 mg/kg (low dose) or 30
mg/kg (high dose) BW orally administered 5-ALA 2-
4 h before surgery. Ten patients (22.2%) had margins
revised at the surgeons’ (A.M.E., W.L.L.) discretion
during index surgery. Seven (15.6%) patients had at
least one involved margin on the index surgical path-
ology report, of which 6 (13.3%) were positive for in-
vasive carcinoma and 2 (4.44%) were positive for
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Six of 45 patients
(13.3%)
underwent
a second operation
to achieve
negative margins.
In patients receiving 5-ALA, oral administration oc-
curred between 2 and 4 h before anesthesia with an
average time to imaging ± SD of 248.3 ± 55.8 min vs
246.1 ± 37.3 min (p = 0.90, t-test) for the low- and
high-dose 5-ALA groups, respectively.
5-ALA-induced fluorescence in clinically obvious and
clinically occult disease
Bright red PpIX fluorescence was detected inside the
demarcated tumor border in grossly sectioned speci-
mens only from patients administered either 5-ALA
dose (Fig. 2). PpIX fluorescence was observed in
both invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC; with or with-
out DCIS) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). In
the absence of 5-ALA, tumor AF was indistinguish-
able from background normal adipose and connect-
ive tissue AF.
Strong PpIX fluorescence was detected in grossly
obvious disease (Fig. 2A), which was visibly appre-
ciable and/or palpable both in grossly sectioned surgi-
cal
specimens
(Fig.
2A(a))
and
clinically
positive
tumor-draining lymph nodes (Fig. 2A(b)). The bound-
ary between the PpIX fluorescence primary tumor
and surrounding normal tissue of the grossly sec-
tioned specimen was well-defined and aligned closely
with that of the pathologist’s assistant (PA) (V.S.,
M.S., F.M.) demarcated tumor border (Fig. 2A(a)). 5-
ALA-induced PpIX fluorescence was also detected in
grossly occult disease, which was not otherwise obvi-
ous under intraoperative standard of care (Fig. 2B).
Grossly occult disease, including IDC and DCIS, was
detected by fluorescence imaging on the margin of
the intact specimen (Fig. 2B(a)), in sectioned surgical
specimens (Fig. 2B(b-c)) and in tumor-draining lymph
nodes (Fig. 2B(d)).

Diagnostic accuracy of fluorescence imaging with 5-ALA
HCl
Diagnostic measures of accuracy were calculated to
evaluate the ability of 5-ALA-induced PpIX red fluores-
cence to discriminate breast carcinoma using the PRO-
DIGI device. Blinded pathologist (S.J.D.) analysis of
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained research biopsies
served as the gold standard for comparison with fluores-
cence imaging results. Control tumors (no 5-ALA) ap-
peared as green and pink/brown fluorescence and lacked
perceptible fluorescence contrast to differentiate tumors
from surrounding healthy tissue (Fig. 2A(a)). As a result,
all biopsies collected from control patients (n = 47) were
classified as negative for PpIX red fluorescence (except a
single biopsy, Supplementary Fig. 4). Diagnostic mea-
sures of accuracy to detect PpIX red fluorescence tu-
mors are therefore not presented for the control group.
Data for the low-dose (n = 46 biopsies) and high-dose (n
= 48 biopsies) 5-ALA groups are presented in Table 2.
Measures were calculated separately for the areas inside
and outside the grossly demarcated tumor border, ac-
counting for the anticipated difference in cancer preva-
lence in these areas. The positive predictive value (PPV)
was 100.0% for both the 15 and 30 mg/kg groups inside
the tumor border. Outside the tumor border, the PPV
was 55.6% and 50.0% for the low- and high-dose groups,
respectively. The NPV inside the tumor border is not re-
ported since the prevalence of normal healthy tissue in-
side the tumor border is expected to be extremely low
and therefore the denominator of NPV is expected to be
near zero regardless of the results of the fluorescence
imaging.
However,
outside
the
demarcated
tumor
border, the NPV was 95.5% and 90.9% for the low- and
high-dose groups, respectively.
The specificity outside the tumor border was 84.0%
and 80.0% in the low- and high-dose groups, respect-
ively. The DOR was 26.3 and 10 for the 15 and 30 mg/
kg groups, respectively. The measures of diagnostic ac-
curacy for all biopsies, irrespective of collection location,
are presented in Table 3. Overall, sensitivity and specifi-
city to detect cancer was 65.0% and 84.6%, respectively
in the low dose group and 68.2% and 80.0%, respectively
in the high-dose group. The PPV was 76.5% (low dose)
and 75.0% (high dose) and the NPV was 75.9% (low
dose) and 74.1% (high dose). No significant difference in
the measures of diagnostic accuracy was observed be-
tween the low- and high-dose groups (Supplementary
Table 1).
Accurate discrimination of small tumor foci was
demonstrated by microscopic examination of H&E-
stained biopsies collected from a small focus (~ 2 mm
diameter) of red fluorescence and nearby non-red
fluorescence tissue (Fig. 3A). Fluorescence imaging
detected a 0.71-mm2 IDC focus (Fig. 3B) within sur-
rounding normal breast tissue (Fig. 3C), otherwise oc-
cult to the pathologist (S.J.D.). In another specimen,
DCIS 2.6 mm below the imaged tissue surface was vi-
sualized as a small area of red fluorescence (Fig. 3D,
E). These data demonstrate the sub-millimeter fluor-
escence image resolution of our device, the cancer
cell-selective nature of 5-ALA, and its ability to detect
sub-surface disease.
Confocal fluorescence microscopy of frozen tumor tis-
sue sections from representative patients was used to

biopsied and fluorescence imaging results were compared to gold-standard histological evaluation of biopsy H&E tissue sections
performed by a blinded pathologist (S.J.D.)

showed bright PpIX fluorescence in the cytoplasm of
cancer cells identified in corresponding H&E-stained tis-
sue sections (Fig. 4A). No significant red PpIX fluores-
cence
was
observed
in
the
cancer
stroma,
which
exhibited bright green AF (Fig. 4A) due to dense con-
nective tissues, such as collagen and elastin, visible in
Masson’s trichrome-stained section (Fig. 4B) [68]. Adi-
pose tissue, which was identified using Oil Red O-
stained sections, was visible in both the green and red
channels, demonstrating broad green-to-red AF albeit
with a qualitatively subdued intensity compared with the
green AF of connective tissues or the red PpIX fluores-
cence. The boundary between cancer foci containing
PpIX fluorescence and connective tissue green AF was
distinct at the cellular level (Fig. 4), indicating the speci-
ficity of PpIX accumulation in cancer cells compared
with healthy surrounding tissues.
Characterization of normal and cancerous breast tissue
fluorescence
To characterize fluorescence features of cancer and nor-
mal breast tissues, focal areas inside and outside the de-
marcated tumor border were visually appraised before
biopsy and categorized by a research team member as
red, green, or dull pink/brown fluorescence during bi-
opsy (Fig. 5A(a), B(a), C(a)). H&E-stained sections were
evaluated for carcinoma and other normal breast tissues
(Fig. 5A(b), B(b),C(b)). In patients receiving 5-ALA, bi-
opsies from outside the tumor border were obtained
from areas of red PpIX fluorescence, if present, while
the remaining biopsies were from areas identified as
green or pale pink/brown fluorescence. In control and
both 5-ALA dose groups, areas of bright green fluores-
cence on gross imaging corresponded to connective tis-
sues (Fig. 5A–C), while pale pink/brown areas were
predominately adipose tissue (Fig. 5A, B). Quantitative
fluorescence point spectroscopy performed at biopsy

locations within the demarcated tumor border con-
firmed PpIX (peak emission 635 nm) in red fluorescence
tumors of patients that received 5-ALA (Fig. 5B(c) and
C(c)) but not in controls (Fig. 5A(c)). Among both 5-
ALA groups, histological assessment of H&E tissue sec-
tions of biopsies from red fluorescence tumors showed
that while fluorescence imaging of the gross specimen
often appeared homogeneously bright red in the demar-
cated primary tumor [due to increased PpIX in cancer
cells (Fig. 5C(a), Bx1)], in fact, microscopically, these
corresponding tissue regions contained a mixture of can-
cer and healthy tissue cells (Fig. 5C(b), Bx1). Taken to-
gether with our fluorescence microscopy data (Fig. 4),
which demonstrated specific accumulation of PpIX in
cancer cells and not in interspersed normal tissue, these
data demonstrate that visualization based on PpIX red
fluorescence is feasible in areas with a mixture of tissue
types (malignant, connective and adipose). Additionally,
fluorescence
imaging
revealed
the
multifocal
and
spatially heterogeneous nature of invasive breast cancers
(Fig. 5C(a), slices 5–6).
To determine the effect of different 5-ALA doses on
cancer fluorescence contrast compared with normal tis-
sues, fluorescence images were analyzed in the CIE xyY
(chromaticity-luminance) color space, which is more
sensitive to differences in fluorescence images than RGB
intensity-based analysis [69]. For a given image, the aver-
age pixel color (x,y coordinates) in two regions of inter-
est (ROI) was calculated and the Eucliden distance
between these points was measured (Fig. 5D). The aver-
age (±SD) Euclidean distance for the low-dose (0.09 ±
0.04) and high-dose (0.10 ± 0.09) 5-ALA groups was sig-
nificantly greater than the control (0.03 ± 0.2, p < 0.05,
one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison
test), confirming the lack of visually perceptible cancer
fluorescence contrast in the control group and the im-
proved fluorescence contrast of PpIX red fluorescence
cancers relative to healthy background tissue in the 5-
ALA groups.
Effect of tissue composition on detection of PpIX
fluorescence
The average percentage of the total biopsy area classified
as cancer or connective tissue in histologically confirmed
cancer cell-positive biopsies was compared between bi-
opsies collected from red fluorescence (true positive) or
green fluorescence (false negative) regions (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 5). Given that the 5-ALA dose did not signifi-
cantly affect the classification of biopsies (comparable
number of TP and FN were observed between both 5-

ALA dose groups), the data from both dose groups was
pooled. While the average percent cancer was higher in
biopsies collected from red versus green fluorescence re-
gions, this was not statistically significant (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 5A, 24.43% vs 14.82%, p = 0.12). Conversely,
the average percent connective tissue was significantly
lower in biopsies collected from PpIX red versus green
fluorescence regions (Supplementary Fig. 5B, 56.04% vs
73.18%, p = 0.007). PRODIGI simultaneously detects
green and red fluorescence to produce a composite color
image; therefore, the relative amount of both connective
and cancer tissue is hypothesized to affect the resultant
fluorescence
color
in
that
region
of
tissue.
The
carcinoma-to-connective tissue ratio (area of a biopsy
tissue section classified as cancer divided by the area
classified as connective tissue) demonstrates that histo-
logically confirmed cancer cell-positive biopsies collected
from red fluorescence regions had a significantly higher
carcinoma-to-connective tissue ratio compared to those
classified as green fluorescence (Supplementary Fig. 5C,
0.49 vs 0.20, p = 0.02).
Safety and feasibility of intraoperative imaging
No adverse drug reactions or device-related adverse
events were observed during the trial. One patient, who
reported a sunburn after post-operative discharge, did
not adhere to the sun protection instructions. Intraoper-
ative imaging of the surgical cavity was performed in 30
study participants (n = 10/group) to demonstrate tech-
nical feasibility, safety, and integration of PRODIGI into
the BCS clinical workflow (Supplementary Fig. 6). We
noted that the fixed placement of LEDs did not ad-
equately illuminate the entire cavity surface homoge-
neously. To overcome this, we scanned the surface in a
sweeping manner with the device and collected videos of
the fluorescence. Cavity imaging integrated into the
standard operating room workflow without significant
disruption. Approximately 1–2 min was required to per-
form a complete scan with real-time video display of all
anatomical margins of the surgical cavity. The device
was quickly and easily draped prior to entering the ster-
ile field and was thermally stable during operation and
comfortable for the operator. Furthermore, the device
was used to image surgical specimens without workflow
disruption in the pathology setting.
Discussion
We present preliminary evidence of effectiveness from a
Phase II RCT demonstrating the first clinical use of 5-
ALA plus PRODIGI, a prototype fluorescence imaging
device, for real-time visualization of breast cancers. The
primary objective of this study was to determine esti-
mates of diagnostic accuracy including PPV, NPV, sensi-
tivity, specificity, and DOR for the visualization of breast
cancer using 5-ALA-induced PpIX fluorescence plus
PRODIGI. We also evaluated the technical feasibility,
safety, and clinical workflow integration of this approach
in the intraoperative setting. To the best of our know-
ledge, this is the first RCT to test a fully handheld, wide-
field fluorescence imaging device for real-time intraoper-
ative breast cancer imaging of lumpectomy and mastec-
tomy specimens and surgical cavities, as well as the first
to report results for 15 and 30 mg/kg 5-ALA-induced
PpIX fluorescence in breast cancer patients.
Surgical margins are a significant challenge in the
treatment of solid cancers [11]. During this study the So-
ciety of Surgical Oncology/American Society Radiation
Oncology/American Society of Clinical Oncology re-
leased joint guidelines for BCS recommending a stand-
ard definition of a positive margin based on clinical
evidence [6, 70]. The guidelines define positive margins
as “ink on tumor” for invasive breast cancer [6] and can-
cer within 2 mm of the inked margin for DCIS [70]. Sur-
geons disagree regarding the recommendations [19, 71,
72] and the effect of the guidelines on re-excision rates
varies [71, 73–79]. Many studies still report suboptimal
re-excision rates [71, 74, 76, 79–81], above the inter-
nationally accepted target of 10% [7, 22], reinforcing the
need for new imaging methods that allow surgeons and
pathologists to visualize grossly occult disease on the
lumpectomy and in the surgical cavity during index
surgery.
5-ALA was well tolerated and enabled visualization of
grossly obvious tumors and occult disease across all
tumor grades (I-III) and types, including IDC and ILC
with and without in situ disease. Both doses tested were
lower than the only dose previously reported for clinical
use in breast cancer (40 mg/kg) [48] and consistently in-
duced bright red cancer fluorescence (contrasted against
normal tissue AF) detected by the device.
PRODIGI was easy to use and practical due to its
handheld form factor (e.g., non-cart based), which over-
comes the large footprint limitation of existing closed-
and wide-field fluorescence surgical imaging systems.
The device was safely integrated into the standard surgi-
cal workflow in both the operating room and the path-
ology
suite
without
affecting
standard
specimen
processing procedures. PpIX fluorescence imaging with
PRODIGI was feasible in the presence of blue dye, which
is commonly used in sentinel node mapping. Although
there is a potential for the blue dye to absorb light in the
red wavelength range, PpIX was visualized in tissues
stained with blue dye. PRODIGI imaging within a small
lumpectomy cavity was impeded by the form factor of
the prototype which led to shadow artefacts due to the
position of the LEDs. Additionally, although a standard-
ized imaging distance of ~ 10 cm was maintained when
imaging
excised

the
bench,

consistent distance for intracavity imaging was challen-
ging. The next-generation device, currently being devel-
oped by our group, is anticipated to overcome these
challenges by improving the optical power density out-
put, re-configuring the optical components to maximize
cavity and specimen surface illumination, including
range finder technology to ensure a standardized work-
ing distance is maintained for optimal imaging and re-
designing the form factor. For the free-hand imaging
modality of the PRODIGI device, there is a potential for
images taken to be blurry. We acknowledge that some of
our images (Fig. 2A(b) and Fig. 2B(d)) are blurry and
were not frames from a video. A blurry image, however,
did not detract from real-time visualization of PpIX
fluorescence. The next-generation device will include a
tap-to-focus feature. A multicenter Phase III interven-
tional imaging RCT will use this optimized device to
evaluate the effectiveness of 5-ALA-induced PpIX fluor-
escence image-guided margin assessment and resection
during BCS. Future studies may also evaluate fluores-
cence imaging during gross examination of specimens to
facilitate rapid, targeted specimen sectioning and identi-
fication of areas for touch-prep cytology and frozen-
section analysis, to improve rapid decisions about add-
itional tissue excision and location of positive margins in
the surgical cavity.
Predictive values depend on disease prevalence, with a
higher disease prevalence associated with higher PPV
and lower NPV, and vice versa [82]. Analysis was, there-
fore, stratified by biopsy location as the prevalence of
cancer cells is higher inside versus outside the tumor
border. In our study, high PPV inside and high NPV
outside the tumor border were observed for both 5-ALA
doses, indicating that PRODIGI functioned as expected.
However, sensitivity and specificity are generally ac-
cepted to not be influenced by differences in disease
prevalence [83]. Thus, while these calculations are pos-
sible with biopsies from inside and outside the tumor
border, more meaningful sensitivity and specificity are
derived without stratification by biopsy location. When
compared to MarginProbe, which uses non-imaging ra-
diofrequency signals to alert surgeons about positive
margins [84–86], our platform may be less likely to re-
sult in removal of cancer-negative tissues. Moreover, our
approach is more sensitive and comparably specific to
conventional BCS [86].
False positives and negatives were seen in both 5-ALA
dose groups inside and outside the demarcated tumor
border. False positives were only observed in 5-ALA pa-
tients (outside the tumor border), and not in controls,
indicating likely ALA-induced PpIX production in non-
malignant cells. The majority of false positive biopsies
(5/9),
examined
histologically,
demonstrated
non-
malignant proliferative changes (hyperplasia, columnar
cell change, atypical ductal hyperplasia, sclerosing ade-
nosis, and fibrocystic change) with infiltrating immune
cells present in one biopsy. If we consider the detection
of these “abnormal” proliferative changes as a desirable
outcome of the test, the PPV to detect abnormal breast
tissue (including malignant and non-malignant prolifera-
tive changes) increases to 89% and 70% for the low- and
high-dose groups, respectively. Other studies using 5-
ALA have observed the accumulation of PpIX fluores-
cence in premalignant diseases [57], in areas with im-
mune cell infiltration [87, 88] and in benign disease,
such as Grade 1 meningiomas [89]. Removing non-
malignant tissues that are associated with increased
breast cancer risk [90] may outweigh the potential effect
on cosmesis during BSC, minimizing the clinical impact
of false positives. Unlike other non-targeted approaches,
such as circumferential cavity shaving [81], fluorescence
imaging would conceivably allow for more spatially tar-
geted revision of margins, reducing unnecessary removal
of additional tissue which is desirable in optimizing
cosmesis. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to
understand how 5-ALA behaves in benign and malig-
nant breast tissues to improve their differentiation dur-
ing intraoperative fluorescence imaging.
Eleven of the 14 false negative biopsies were collected
from inside the tumor border, the majority of which (8/
11) came from primary tumors that had observable red
fluorescence elsewhere inside the demarcated tumor or
in an area contiguous with the demarcated tumor on an
adjacent slice, suggesting heterogeneity in biological fac-
tors that may influence 5-ALA uptake and the produc-
tion, accumulation, and/or detection of PpIX in the
primary tumor. For example, differences in tissue com-
position can affect optical properties and light transport
in tissue which can affect the detection of PpIX. More-
over, endogenous fluorophores that emit high-intensity
green AF (collagen, flavin adenine dinucleotide-FAD, re-
duced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-NADH) [91]
may “mask” PpIX fluorescence, especially in small cancer
foci.
Multifocal disease, associated with poorer disease-free
survival [92], was also visualized in serially sectioned
specimens. PpIX fluorescence revealed lobulated tumor
borders and heterogenous tumor composition, which
was consistent with patients’ preoperative imaging/path-
ology but not appreciable by palpation. While some
specimens had uniform bright red fluorescence tumors,
others had heterogeneous (multifocal) bright red fluores-
cence foci with green connective tissue interspersed
throughout
the
tumor,
which
is
consistent
with
carcinoma-associated fibrosis [93]. We observed spatial
heterogeneity in the density of fluorescent connective
tissues in the surgical specimens during macroscopic
examination with some specimens being homogeneously

bright green and others showing a more mottled appear-
ance. Moreover, increased microvasculature may prefer-
entially absorb the 405 nm excitation light and emitted
PpIX fluorescence. These findings may aid decision-
making for oncoplastic surgical techniques [94] and
identify patients with residual or multicentric disease be-
yond the primary tumor.
Limitations of the study include its single-center de-
sign, variability in the time to imaging, restriction on the
total number of biopsies collected per patient, and a
focus on visualization of carcinoma inside the serially
sectioned specimen and not on the specimen margins.
PMCC draws patients from various regional community
practices representative of patients seen throughout
Canada and the U.S. However, clinical practice by breast
surgeons (A.M.E., W.L.L.) in our academic setting may
vary from community practices [95]. Variability in the
imaging time relative to administration of 5-ALA be-
tween patients is unavoidable in a surgical intervention
study at a high-volume center. Nevertheless, we aimed
to administer 5-ALA 2-4 h before anesthesia, to enable
imaging between 2.5 and 5 h post-administration, which
is clinically relevant for maximal PpIX signal [96]. The
institution restricted the number and size of biopsies
collected from inside and outside the demarcated tumor
border. To maximize the number of PpIX red fluores-
cence areas analyzed histologically, biopsies were col-
lected
under
fluorescence
image
guidance,
possibly
leading to a sampling selection bias. However, given the
restrictions on biopsy collection, it would be difficult to
collect enough biopsies without fluorescence image
guidance to calculate sensitivity outside the tumor
border. Lastly, future studies will assess the accuracy of
5-ALA-induced fluorescence visualization for the detec-
tion of positive margins during BCS.
Conclusions
Intraoperative fluorescence imaging is an emerging tech-
nique with significant potential to improve clinical out-
comes in breast cancer patients. The superficial (~ 2 mm
[56]) penetration of PRODIGI’s 405 nm excitation light
is more suitable for intraoperative margin assessment
compared to NIR fluorescence imaging methods, which
can image to depths of several centimeters [27, 28, 97,
98] and are, therefore, more likely to result in false posi-
tive margin readings. Unlike other non-image-based
methods, including
the
FDA-approved MarginProbe
[86], our approach produces a real-time color image of
the anatomical location and extent of carcinoma with
sub-millimeter resolution. The differing emission spectra
of normal tissue AF and PpIX are visually distinguish-
able, providing excellent fluorescence contrast of the
cancers against background healthy tissues and simplify-
ing fluorescence image interpretation for the operator
[99]. This facilitates real-time decision-making by guid-
ing surgeons to potential areas of microscopic disease
within a macroscopic setting [99], and enabling treat-
ment plan adjustments, which is not possible with
current preoperative imaging modalities.
Our study also contributes to the growing clinical evi-
dence of 5-ALA for intraoperative visualization of clinic-
ally occult cancer beyond neurosurgery where this
approach is becoming the standard of care [43]. The ver-
satile design of the novel handheld fluorescence imaging
device could help to translate this approach to other
cancer surgeries where margin assessment and image-
guided resection are valuable. Future clinical adoption
will be predicated on safe and effective device and con-
trast agent combinations that are easily integrated into
the operating room workflow, meet the user’s needs
(wireless one-handed use), and are cost-sensitive.
