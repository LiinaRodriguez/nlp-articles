Summary
Quantitative thermal imaging
can be used to detect physi-
ological changes associated
with radiation-induced
dermatitis and can be inte-
grated with machine learning
Purpose: Radiation-induced dermatitis is a common side effect of breast radiation
therapy (RT). Current methods to evaluate breast skin toxicity include clinical exam-
ination, visual inspection, and patient-reported symptoms. Physiological changes asso-
ciated with radiation-induced dermatitis, such as inﬂammation, may also increase
body-surface temperature, which can be detected by thermal imaging. Quantitative
thermal imaging markers were identiﬁed and used in supervised machine learning
to develop a predictive model for radiation dermatitis.

frameworks to develop a
predictive tool for skin-
toxicity at early treatment
times. Ninety patients treated
for whole-breast radio-
therapy were recruited for
the study. Thermal images of
the treated breast were taken
at four intervals. Machine
learning models demon-
strated early thermal signals
associated with skin-toxicity
after the ﬁfth radiotherapy
fraction with high prediction
accuracy.
Methods and Materials: Ninety patients treated for adjuvant whole-breast RT (4250
cGy/fx Z 16) were recruited for the study. Thermal images of the treated breast were
taken at 4 intervals: before RT, then weekly at fx Z 5, fx Z 10, and fx Z 15. Para-
metric thermograms were analyzed and yielded 26 thermal-based features that
included surface temperature (C) and texture parameters obtained from (1) gray-
level co-occurrence matrix, (2) gray-level run-length matrix, and (3) neighborhood
gray-tone difference matrix. Skin toxicity was evaluated at the end of RT using the
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) guidelines (Ver.5). Bi-
nary group classes were labeled according to a CTCAE cut-off score of 2, and ther-
mal features obtained at fx Z 5 were used for supervised machine learning to predict
skin toxicity. The data set was partitioned for model training, independent testing, and
validation. Fifteen patients (w17% of the whole data set) were randomly selected as an
unseen test data set, and 75 patients (w83% of the whole data set) were used for
training and validation of the model. A random forest classiﬁer with leave-1-patient-
out cross-validation was employed for modeling single and hybrid parameters. The
model performance was reported using receiver operating characteristic analysis on
patients from an independent test set.
Results: Thirty-seven patients presented with adverse skin effects, denoted by a
CTCAE score 2, and had signiﬁcantly higher local increases in skin temperature,
reaching 36.06C at fx Z 10 (P Z .029). However, machine-learning models demon-
strated early thermal signals associated with skin toxicity after the ﬁfth RT fraction.
The cross-validated model showed high prediction accuracy on the independent test
data (test accuracy Z 0.87) at fx Z 5 for predicting skin toxicity at the end of RT.
Conclusions: Early thermal markers after 5 fractions of RT are predictive of
radiation-induced skin toxicity in breast RT.  2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Introduction
Radiation therapy (RT) uses ionizing radiation to target
residual cancer cells of the breast and induce cellular death.
This results in the reduction of locoregional and distant
cancer recurrence after lumpectomy (15.7%; 95% conﬁ-
dence interval, 13.7-17.7; P <.00001)1 or mastectomy (rate
ratio Z 0.68; 95% conﬁdence interval, 0.57-0.82; P Z
.00006).2 However, RT is associated with dermatologic
risks such as erythema, which affects approximately 90%
of treated patients.3,4 The skin is a highly proliferative
organ and is therefore susceptible to radiation damage and
toxicity.5 Cellular apoptotic and necrotic events are initiated
in the skin from repeated and fractionated exposure to ra-
diation.5,6 Cellular death leads to the recruitment of cyto-
kines,
prompting
an
inﬂammatory
response
(acute
dermatitis) that stimulates the transendothelial migration of
immune cells to the target site.5,6 Consequently, blood ves-
sels dilate causing an increase in blood volume and the
damaged irradiated skin clinically presents as erythema and
may lead to more severe effects such as desquamation.3
As a result, patients undergoing RT are carefully moni-
tored using standard assessment tools such as the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) system
to manage toxicity burden.7 Major challenges associated
with visual inspection of the breast to evaluate skin-related
symptoms include low sensitivity and speciﬁcity for
detecting
early
signs
of
dermatitis
in
addition
to
differentiating the degree of severe skin toxicity (ie, CTCAE
 2). This is caused by practitioner bias, underreporting by
patients, and clinician expertise that may lead to variability
in grading skin toxicity.7-9 Topographic imaging modalities,
such as quantitative thermal imaging (QTI), have the po-
tential to overcome these challenges and objectively mea-
sure the changes in surface skin temperature associated
with radiation-induced skin dermatitis. Exploiting QTI and
machine-learning frameworks (ie, thermoradiomics) may
yield
actionable
insight
into
symptom
management
during RT.
QTI has previously been used to identify temperature
changes associated with alterations in blood ﬂow and dis-
ease presentation.10-12 Within the RT setting, Maillot et al13
investigated the use of thermography to quantitatively
evaluate skin toxicity. Patients who were classiﬁed using
the CTCAE and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
criteria demonstrated a high-grade of skin toxicity (2) that
was also associated with an increase in the average local
temperature (P < .05). Furthermore, Maillot et al13 found
that thermography-derived temperature features recorded a
week before the clinical presentation of skin toxicity had a
predictive value of 70%. Their study also demonstrated a
higher incidence of high-grade radiation-induced dermatitis
after 10 to 15 RT fractions. Other QTI applications for
breast cancer include using ﬁrst-order temperature features
and second-order features such as thermogram-texture pa-
rameters for detecting breast lesions. Milosevic et al tested

the feasibility of thermal breast imaging to screen for ma-
lignancies. The study exploited machine-learning classiﬁ-
cation algorithms to distinguish thermal features associated
with benign versus malignant masses in the breast. Second-
order features included gray-level co-occurrence matrix
(GLCM) features, and the results of the study demonstrated
a diagnostic accuracy of 92.5%.14 Potential applications
and advantages of employing image guided decision sup-
port tools, such as QTI, include early intervention and
preventive therapeutics
that
could mitigate radiation-
induced skin toxicity. Current treatment strategies for
managing skin toxicity include the use of glucocorticoste-
roids to inhibit the inﬂammatory response that mediates
acute skin dermatitis.15,16 Early thermoradiomic markers
for skin toxicity would potentially allow radiation oncolo-
gists to target patients for prophylactic corticosteroid use,
which has been shown to reduce the incidence of radiation-
induced dermatitis.17
Although the capability of thermal imaging to monitor
the occurrence of disease has been demonstrated in previ-
ous studies, the potential of using temperature-based and
textural features as imaging biomarkers for radiation-
induced dermatitis remains unclear and warrants further
investigation.12,13 Here, we investigated QTI and machine-
learning frameworks (ie, thermoradiomics) to develop a
predictive tool for radiation-induced skin toxicity at early
treatment time intervals. This study aimed to measure
thermal characteristics of the irradiated skin in patients
with breast cancer. We hypothesized that radiation-induced
skin toxicity is associated with an increase in skin-surface
temperature and changes in thermoradiomic parameters.
Methods and Materials
Patient recruitment criteria and radiation
treatment parameters
This study was carried out at a single academic health
center and approved by the institutional research ethics
board. Participants signed an informed consent form
before enrollment. Patients were included in the study
based on the following inclusion criteria: conﬁrmed
diagnosis of invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in
situ, age (18þ), and undergoing adjuvant hypofractionated
RT to the whole breast or chestwall (4250 cGy/fx Z 16).
Patients were excluded from the study if their planned
treatment position was prone, undergoing expander-
implant
breast
reconstruction,
or
had
a
history
of
inﬂammatory breast cancer.18,19 Ninety patients were
prospectively recruited to the study, and clinical charac-
teristics are presented in Table 1. All patients completed a
full whole-breast or chestwall treatment course, that is, 16
fractions of adjuvant RT, and received standard skin
management strategies consisting of saline rinses only. As
part of the study protocol, patients were not prescribed
topical corticosteroids (eg, hydrocortisone) or topical
antibiotics (eg, bacitracin/polymyxin B or silver sulfa-
diazine cream) during their treatment course. Figure 1
summarizes the study workﬂow and methods.
Data acquisition: Quantitative thermal imaging and
clinical information
Thermal infrared imaging data were captured using a
forward-looking infrared (FLIR) E53 advanced thermal
imaging device (FLIR, Wilsonville, USA). Images were
acquired from the ipsilateral and contralateral breasts at the
following time intervals: baseline (before RT) and after
every ﬁfth RT fraction (fx Z 5, fx Z 10, and fx Z 15).
Imaging settings were kept constant throughout the time
series for each patient. A ﬁxed distance of 2 m was used
between the patient and camera. Thermograms were
reconstructed at a resolution of 240  180 pixels. The
instantaneous ﬁeld of view, which comprises the pixel size
on the measurement surface (ie, breast or chestwall) was
3.54 mm. Thermal images were captured using a ﬁxed
emissivity setting of ε Z 0.98.
Long wave infrared thermography was carried out in a
designated examination room. The room was controlled for
ambient temperature and air ﬂow during examination. Pa-
tients were positioned, while standing, with their arm behind
their head, exposing the axilla, midline, and inframammary
folds. All study participants were evaluated for radiation-
induced skin toxicity using the CTCAE Ver. 5 guidelines,
and information was recorded in the electronic medical re-
cord. The ﬁnal CTCAE assessment (ie, end of the 16th
fraction) was used for ground truth labeling in machine-
learning models (described in a later section). Other clinical
and demographic information was collected from the elec-
tronic medical records and included the following variables:
age, cancer diagnosis, clinicopathologic characteristics of
the tumor, surgery details, and RT treatment information.
Patient ethnicity information was collected through clinical
reports and breast cup size was measured as per the stan-
dardized North American scale (Table 1).
Other clinical information associated with risk factors
for radiation-induced dermatitis were collected from the
patient’s electronic medical record and recorded in the
patient’s case report forms. Table 1 includes information on
those variables, which includes the administration of
adjuvant chemotherapy (y/n), type of adjuvant chemo-
therapy,
local
treatment
(whole
breast
only)
versus
locoregional irradiation (4-ﬁeld technique involving the
chestwall and regional lymph nodes), the radiation dose-to-
skin volume (cGy), and menopausal status.20-22
Image processing and feature extraction
Data preprocessing was performed to construct parametric
thermal images using FLIR’s proprietary software devel-
opment kit (FileReader). Thermal images were normalized
using the software development kit before segmentation

and analysis, which used a nonuniformity correction pro-
cess. Analytical software for segmentation and to extract
ﬁrst and second order QTI features was developed using
MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, USA). The region of
interest (ROI) was delineated manually by using a standard
protocol. The ROI comprised the treatment ﬁeld borders
according to clinical and anatomic landmarks, that is,
clavicle (superior border), 2 cm below inframammary fold
(inferior border), midline sternum (medial border), and
midaxillary line (lateral border). The radiation treatment
ﬁeld published from the radiation treatment planning sys-
tem
(Pinnacle,
Philips
Healthcare,
Amsterdam,
Netherlands) was used as a reference to the targeted irra-
diated area of the thermograms for each time interval. All
ROIs were veriﬁed with our collaborating radiation oncol-
ogists with 5 to 30 years of experience (Fig. 2F).
First-order features included temperature (C) mea-
surements, which were calculated as an average value
across the entire breast treatment area (Fig. 2C). Other ﬁrst-
order features included entropy, skewness, and kurtosis. All
ﬁrst-order features recorded are presented in Table E1
(available online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.
12.032). The thermal images were also analyzed using
second-order statistics to extract 25 textural features related
to Haralick textures. For extracting textural features from
the thermal images, the original thermograms were used
without resampling, and the full range of gray-level in-
tensities in each thermal image was quantized into 16
levels. Second-order texture features were extracted using
MATLAB and adapted from open-source radiomics codes
using the Pyradiomics platform.23,24 The Pyradiomics
platform has been used in previous radiomic studies and
comprises standard methods for radiomics feature extrac-
tion and image analysis.24 Second-order features were
derived using a GLCM, which yielded attributes associated
with the spatial relationship between pixel intensities.25,26
Other second-order features were computed from a gray-
level run-length matrix (GLRLM) and a gray-tone differ-
ence matrix (GTDM). Other available second-order feature
matrices (eg, a gray-level size zone and a gray-level
dependence matrix) were excluded owing to redundancy
with the selected feature sets and sample size limitations,
that is, to avoid “data ﬁshing” that can potentially over ﬁt
the models (ie, the total number of selected features within
a given model should be limited to 1/10 of the sample
size).27,28
Overall, there were 4 Haralick texture GLCM features
(FGLCM Z 4), 5 GTDM features (FGTDM Z 5), and 16
GLRLM attributes (FGLRLM Z 16). Gray-tone texture
features were calculated based on a gray-scale of 16 tones
(Ng Z 16). The displacement vector (d) and offset angle
(q), relative to the central pixel, were constrained to d Z 1
and q Z 0, 45, 90, and 135, respectively. Directional
matrices (GLCM and GLRLM) were summated into a
global matrix and normalized before feature extraction. The
texture equations (GLCM, GTDM, GLRLM) and the

textural features (F Z 25) are described in Tables E2
through E4 (available online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.
ijrobp.2019.12.032).
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for differences in
temperature and textural features between CTCAE  2
and CTCAE  1 patient classes using SPSS V. 24 (IBM
Corp, Armonk, NY). This was calculated for the ipsilateral
(irradiated) side and contralateral (nonirradiated) side. A
Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normality viola-
tions. Averages were calculated (Fig. 2C) and compared
between groups using both parametric (unpaired, 2-sided
independent t test) and nonparametric (Mann-Whitney)
statistical tests based on normal versus nonnormal data
distributions, respectively. A repeated-measures analysis
of variance was carried out to determine the signiﬁcance
of temporal changes in features. A Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons was carried out, as was random
sampling with replacement (ie, bootstrapping) over 1000
repetitions. Group comparisons for clinical and de-
mographic data used a Fisher exact test to compare
categorical variables (Table 1). P values <.05 were
considered signiﬁcant.
Dimensionality reduction and machine-learning
modeling
For thermoradiomic markers, the relative changes from the
baseline value of all ﬁrst- and second-order features were
calculated for each subject and class at all time intervals.
Skin toxicity is typically observed after the 10th RT frac-
tion; therefore, the objective was to test whether QTI and
texture parameters obtained from earlier time intervals (ie,
ﬁfth RT fraction) demonstrated early prediction capabilities
to severe skin toxicity. Several machine-learning classiﬁ-
cation experiments were carried out to yield various pre-
dictive models. First, the data set was divided into 2 sets for
training and independent testing of the model. Fifteen pa-
tients (w17% of the whole data set) were randomly
selected as an unseen test data set, and 75 patients (w83%
of the whole data set) were used for training and validation
of the model. Feature selection was performed using a
sequential forward feature selection approach. The leave-1-

operating characteristic (ROC) curve (area under the curve,
AUC) was used as the criteria for feature selection. In the
ﬁrst 2 experiments, the ﬁrst-order temperature features
alone were used as the initial feature set. In experiments 3
and 4, all ﬁrst-order and texture features were included in
the initial feature set. Because the ﬁrst initial feature set
only included 8 ﬁrst-order features, no feature reduction
was applied or required before feature selection. The sec-
ond initial feature set included 33 features (8 ﬁrst-order and
25 texture features) and the redundant features were elim-
inated based on interfeature correlation. Speciﬁcally, the
correlation between 2 features was calculated. The features
with high interfeature correlation (r2 > 0.70) were selected
for analysis, and the retention criterion was based on the
feature that yielded a higher AUC in the training set.
Bootstrapping was used on the training data to improve the
generalization performance of the trained classiﬁer on un-
seen data.29 Speciﬁcally, the classiﬁer was trained using
100 bootstrap samples for each fold of the data during
LOPO cross-validation. Before each bootstrap sampling,
the majority class (negative) was randomly down sampled
to compensate for the imbalance of data between the 2
classes (45 negative vs 30 positive cases). The optimal
feature set was selected using a majority vote on the
selected features for all folds of the data. The sensitivity,
speciﬁcity, and accuracy of the trained model were calcu-
lated on the unseen test data and used in addition to the
AUC to evaluate the efﬁcacy of the optimal feature set to
predict skin toxicity.30

been previously shown to predict radiation-induced skin
toxicity: adjuvant chemotherapy (y/n), type of adjuvant
chemotherapy, local (whole breast only) versus locore-
gional (4-ﬁeld technique) irradiation, radiation dose-to-skin
volume (cGy), menopausal status, and cup size. The clin-
ical model was trained and subsequently evaluated using

Results
Study participant demographics and outcomes
Of the 90 patients enrolled in this study, 37 (41%) pre-
sented with bright tender erythema or desquamation
(CTCAE  2) at the end of their treatment. The difference
in reported skin toxicity between CTCAE  2 and CTCAE
 1 groups is represented in Figure E1 (available online at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.12.032). Of the pa-
tients who presented with skin toxicity (CTCAE  2),
70.3% were Caucasian, 13.5% Asian, and 5.4% were Black
(Table 1). Further demographic and clinical features such as
cancer histologic type, tumor grade, and molecular subtype
are presented in Table 1.
Temperature measurements of the treated breast
Signiﬁcant differences (P < .05) in skin-surface tempera-
tures (mean value and central tendency measures) were
observed between the CTCAE  2 and CTCAE  1 clas-
ses, at fraction intervals fx Z 10 and fx Z 15 (Fig. 3A,
Fig. E2, available online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.
2019.12.032). The CTCAE  2 patients demonstrated an
increase in mean skin temperature, reaching 36.42C at the
end of treatment with a signiﬁcant temperature increase of
0.58C (0.172C) from baseline (P < .01), whereas the
CTCAE  1 group had an insigniﬁcant temperature in-
crease of 0.13C (0.133C) compared with the baseline
measurements (P > .05). Figure 3C illustrates a signiﬁcant
difference in mean temperature distributions of 0.45C
(0.202C) (P Z .029) on the ipsilateral side at the 10th
treatment fraction between CTCAE  2 and CTCAE  1
classes, with the CTCAE  2 patients demonstrating higher
breast surface temperature.
Thermoradiomic markers using textural features of
the treated breast
Most of the textural feature distributions did not demon-
strate any statistical signiﬁcance (Figs. E3-E5, available
online
at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.12.032).
However, texture analyses identiﬁed the GLRLM-short run
emphasis (SRE) as being signiﬁcantly different between the
2 patient groups (Fig. E4, available online at https://doi.org/
10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.12.032). Thermal measurements of
CTCAE  2 patients exhibited higher SRE values than the
CTCAE  1 group at fx Z 10 (P Z .033). However, this
effect demonstrates insigniﬁcant differences by fx Z 15
(P Z .69)
Machine-learning predictive models using clinical
variables
The performance of the clinical model demonstrates a
prediction accuracy (Acc) of 67%, sensitivity of 75%, and
speciﬁcity of 57%, using the following 5 clinical features
selected through a forward feature selection: adjuvant
chemotherapy (y/n), type of adjuvant chemotherapy, radi-
ation dose-to-skin volume (cGy), menopausal status, and
cup size. In a second experiment, the forward feature se-
lection algorithm was used to select 4 clinical features
(instead of 5). The selected features included adjuvant
chemotherapy (y/n), radiation dose-to-skin volume (cGy),
menopausal status, and cup size. The accuracy of the model
in this experiment was 60%, with a sensitivity of 62.5% and
a speciﬁcity of 57%.

Discussion
The aim of this study was to investigate the use of QTI
biomarkers for radiation-induced skin toxicity in breast
cancer. Our results demonstrate that patients who presented
with a CTCAE  2, as evaluated at the time of their last RT
fraction, exhibited higher skin-surface temperature values
during treatment compared with those who demonstrated a
CTCAE  1 score. The temperature differences between
patient groups were most evident at the 10th fraction of RT.
Moreover, using inferential statistical analyses alone, the
QTI-texture features of the ipsilateral breast such as the
GLRLM-SRE revealed a signiﬁcant difference between the
patient groups after the 10th radiation fraction. The
CTCAE  1 patient group showed higher GLRLM-SRE
average values. GLRLM textural features quantitate the
length/number of homogenic pixels, and the GLRLM-SRE
is indicative of how many short lengths of homogenic
pixels are within the matrix.31,32 Within this framework, we
posit that a high GLRLM-SRE value in low-grade patients
(CTCAE  1) represents a ﬁner/smoother image texture
within the thermograms. Clinically, this corresponds to
unremarkable
dermatologic
changes
and
temperature
variances on the breast skin surface.31 In contrast, patients
who demonstrated a CTCAE  2 had heterogeneous ther-
mal maps of the skin, which may represent increased
temperatures in regions of the breast that are at higher risk
for dermatitis, such as the inframammary fold and axilla.
Using machine learning, we report early thermoradiomic
signatures of acute skin toxicity, which is typically
observed after 10 to 14 days of initiating RT.33 Early
thermal parameters from the 5th RT fraction were used in
machine-learning models to classify patients and to test the
accuracy of predicting symptom-based endpoints from
selected QTI and textural hybrid feature sets.34,35 These
hybrid feature sets, in conjunction with a nonlinear classi-
ﬁcation model and bootstrapping, yielded high classiﬁca-
tion accuracy in a multidimensional space. We carried out
several experiments using the random forest method to
compute individual textural features and temperature pa-
rameters into optimized sets that are associated with binary
outcomes, that is, CTCAE  2 versus CTCAE  1.
Figure 4 displays the experiment containing only ﬁrst-order
feature sets and an experiment with both ﬁrst-order and
texture feature sets, where experiment 3 had the highest
prediction accuracy and area under the ROC curve (test
Acc Z 0.87, test AUC Z 0.98). The results presented in
Figure 4 and Table 2 demonstrate the signiﬁcance of using
texture features in conjunction with the mean temperature
parameter to predict skin toxicity after breast RT. In com-
parison, the ﬁrst-order temperature features alone did not
demonstrate a high prediction accuracy (test Acc Z 0.73).
Despite individual QTI features that showed insigniﬁcant
differences between groups based on a Gaussian distribu-
tion (ie, carrying out inferential statistical analysis), the

machine-learning algorithm used a nonlinear classiﬁer to
assess the predictive performance of the combined features
within a multidimensional space. The forward feature se-
lection method yielded optimal complementary features
based on the relative distances of attributes within the
feature space.36 We tested clinical features alone to develop
a baseline machine-learning model. A comparison between
clinical models versus thermoradiomic models was carried
out, and the results suggest that thermoradiomic markers
demonstrate superior early-predictors of radiation-induced
skin toxicity compared with using clinical features alone.
Within these frameworks, we propose that QTI may be used
as a clinical tool in radiation oncology; speciﬁcally, that
measuring the breast surface temperature and extracting the
associated texture features may serve as possible predictive
biomarkers for severe radiation-induced skin toxicity
(CTCAE  2).
In comparison to other investigations, Templeton et al
measured radiation-induced dermatitis in mice using
3-dimensional
thermal
tomography.37
Their
results
revealed an increase in the thermal effusivity, which was
associated with high-grade skin dermatitis.37,38 In the
clinical setting, our ﬁndings are concordant with a pre-
vious study by Maillot et al, which tested thermography
for monitoring and predicting skin toxicity in a pro-
spective patient cohort (n Z 64).13 Patients in that study
who demonstrated a CTCAE  2 (ie, high-grade derma-
titis) showed a very signiﬁcant increase in the average
skin-surface temperature over the course of RT (P <
.001).13 Here, our novel approach incorporated textural
features from GLCM, GTDM, and GLRLM analyses to
evaluate and predict dermatitis in patients with breast
cancer. We also employed machine-learning classiﬁcation
to identify early signatures (at fx Z 5) of skin toxicity,
which corresponded to the patients’ CTCAE grade at the
end of treatment. Other technologies have been used to
noninvasively study radiation-induced skin toxicity. For
example, laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (LDF) has been shown
to quantitatively monitor skin toxicity by measuring
microscopic changes in blood ﬂow associated with skin
reactions.39,40 Previous studies have demonstrated that
the LDF microcirculation index values correspond with
CTCAE scores and suggest that LDF may be used to
monitor radiation-induced dermatitis.41 Although there is
interest in combining LDF with thermal imaging, QTI
remains a more practical and economic imaging modal-
ity39,42,43 owing to readily available technology in radi-
ation oncology clinics and its ability to relay practical and
intuitive information about the macroscopic changes of
the skin during RT.43
RT remains a crucial component in the postoperative
management of breast cancer. The associated side effects
from treatment may affect patient quality of life. Particu-
larly, severe skin toxicity is prevalent within this patient
population and carries an increased risk of pain and
discomfort. Approximately 61.9% of patients will develop
CTCAE 2 toxicity, whereas 8.3% present with CTCAE 3
symptoms after 2 weeks of treatment.44 In our patient
cohort, 41.1% of patients had a CTCAE  2. Therefore,
this represents a signiﬁcant patient population that would
potentially beneﬁt from early detection and early inter-
vention for symptom management.
Radiation-induced skin toxicity associated with RT may
be better managed using thermography, which has several
advantages such as portability and relatively low cost
compared with other imaging devices, and may provide
actionable biomarkers that may guide the administration of
early-intervention therapeutics. Therapeutic options include
Mepitel ﬁlm for prophylaxis against the onset of skin
toxicity. The mechanism of action of Mepitel ﬁlm involves
protecting the affected skin from external contamination
and maintaining a moist environment to facilitate wound
healing.45-47 Herst et al demonstrated that Safe-tac-based
Mepitel
ﬁlm
prevented
the
occurrence
of
radiation-
induced skin toxicity by 92% (P < .0001) and improved
postradiation patient satisfaction.45 Thermal imaging may
also provide a method to validate the efﬁcacy of pharma-
cologic agents to manage skin toxicity.16,48 For instance,
although glucocorticosteroids are successful in treating
radiation-induced skin toxicity, their antiinﬂammatory ef-
fects have been found to interfere with passive wound
healing, which may compromise the structural integrity of
the tissue in the long term.48,49 QTI has potential uses as a
decision-support tool. QTI-based biomarkers could steer
symptom management decisions in radiation oncology; for
example, avoiding unnecessary treatments for patients who
demonstrate a low risk of developing skin symptoms.
Conversely, for patients who have a high risk, there is an
opportunity to develop a personalized thermography-
guided
approach
for
skin
toxicity
management
and
prevention.
The limitations of this study include small sample size,
which affects the framework of the prediction model. First,
small sample sets limit the approach for group classiﬁcation
(ie, sufﬁcient samples and distributions are required be-
tween classes). Second, model testing and validation in
small sample sets have a greater risk of yielding an over
ﬁtted prediction model. To address this problem, the pre-
dictive model was trained using a LOPO validation
approach and subsequently evaluated using unseen data
from an independent test set. Furthermore, although data
collection conditions were controlled as best as possible,
some inconsistencies in experimental conditions, such as
heavy clothing attire, may have led to an increase in pa-
tients’
skin-surface
temperature
before
imaging.
We
attempted to reduce this effect by instructing patients to
change into standard hospital gowns before imaging. Other
limitations include interfraction ROI selection. Although
we used clinical- and protocol-guided segmentation with
reference to the radiation treatment plan, the region of in-
terest may also ﬂuctuate based on anatomic changes (ie,
changes in the size of the breast) and positional differences
of the patient at each time interval. Our study population
was largely composed of Caucasian and Asian patients

(86.7%) with light skin pigmentation (Table 1) who tend to
demonstrate less severe skin toxicity than patients with
darker skin pigmentation.50 Ethnicity is a known risk factor
for radiation-induced skin toxicity, most notably, Black
patients have a 73% greater risk of skin-dermatitis than
other ethnic groups, and thus it is crucial that these methods
be repeated in a patient population with greater diversity in
ethnicity and skin phenotype.50,51 In future work, ther-
moradiomic markers may also be useful in other cancer
sites, such as head and neck radiation oncology. Severe skin
toxicity, characterized as conﬂuent moist desquamation (ie,
grade 3) presents in approximately 23% of patients with
head and neck cancer52; thus, early thermoradiomic
markers in this setting may signiﬁcantly improve manage-
ment strategies at the beginning of the 7-week treatment
course for this patient population.
In conclusion, QTI is a readily available technology
and may potentially support clinical decisions in breast
radiation oncology. Quantitative assessments of skin
toxicity are useful to reduce diagnostic variability among
health care providers and have the potential to validate
early clinical management of skin-related side effects of
treatment. Advances in current practices are limited by
the available imaging tools that can objectively measure
skin toxicity. As a result, visual inspection and patient-
reported symptoms remain the primary method, but this
can be subjective.7,53,54 Thermal imaging has the poten-
tial to reduce these biases and may also complement
current grading systems such as the CTCAE score. It
could potentially help better deﬁne the grading scales
within quantitative thermal boundaries. Image guided RT
already plays an integral role in the clinic for treatment
delivery. This study demonstrates the feasibility of
additional image guided approaches; speciﬁcally, to use
QTI as a clinical decision support tool for symptom
management in the breast radiation oncology clinic.
