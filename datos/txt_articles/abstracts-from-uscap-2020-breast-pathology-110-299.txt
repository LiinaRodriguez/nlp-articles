Background: Breast angiosarcoma (BAS) is an aggressive neoplasm with poor prognosis accounting for about 1% of all breast 
malignancies. It can be classified as either primary (de novo) or secondary BAS (status post radiation). We aimed to study the 
histopathologic, comorbid characteristics and clinical outcomes of this rare disease. 
Design: We retrospectively reviewed databases from two institutions in order to identify patients diagnosed with BAS between 1990 and 
2019. Clinical data for these patients was obtained from electronic medical records. 
Results: Nineteen patients with BAS were identified from the databases. Of these, 5 (26%) cases were primary BAS and 14 (74%) cases 
were secondary BAS. The mean age at diagnosis for primary and secondary BAS were 45 (range: 23-71) and 61 (range: 33-84) years 
respectively. The mean time to secondary BAS development following radiation therapy was 74.6 (range: 24-144) months. The mean follow 
up period was 23 months (range: 1-108). Disease recurrence was seen in 1 (20%) and 5 (36%) cases of primary and secondary BAS, 
respectively. 3 (60%) and 2 (14%) patients, with primary and secondary BAS respectively, died of disease. The mean duration from 
diagnosis to death was 16.8 months (range: 15-29) and 12.5 months (range: 5-20) in primary and secondary BAS, respectively. Patient 
characteristics including comorbidities and histopathologic descriptors are summarized in Table 1.

Conclusions: Although no histologic differences were identified between primary and secondary, secondary BAS appears to have a 
poorer outcome with higher recurrence rates and shorter survival times. Comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension and 
smoking were strikingly more prevalent in patients who developed secondary BAS, which may have prognostic implications.

Background: Metaplastic breast carcinoma is an aggressive form of breast cancer with poor prognosis, accounting for approximately 1-2% 
of all breast cancers. We aimed to study the clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes of this rare disease in our patient population. 
Design: This is a retrospective study of patients who were diagnosed with metaplastic breast carcinoma between 2000 and 2019. Clinical 
data was obtained from electronic medical records. Bayesian Cox Proportional model method was used to determine association between 
survival and several clinicopathologic variables and hazard ratio (HR) > 1 were considered significant. 
Results: Of the 135 patients, 47 (34.8%) were Caucasian, 76 (56.7%) were African-American, and 12 (8.9%) belonged to other ethnicities. 
Median age at diagnosis and tumor size were 57 years (range: 27-92) and 3 cm (range: 0.5-21.5), respectively. At diagnosis, 100 (74.1%) 
cases were triple negative tumors and 122 (90.4%) cases were grade III tumors. 73 (54.1%), 37 (27.4%), and 57 (42.2%) cases had non-
squamous histology, vascular invasion, and stage II disease, respectively. 21 (15.6%) cases had multi-focal disease. Ductal carcinoma in-
situ (DCIS) and fibrocystic breast disease were seen in 56 (41.5%) and 26 (19.3%) cases, respectively. 78 (57.8%) patients were obese 
(BMI>30), and of those, 53 (68%) were African Americans. During a median follow-up of 24 months (range: 0-221), 107 (79.3%) patients 
were alive. However, 14 (10.4%) deaths were reported with a median time-to-death of 17.5 months (range: 1-169). Of the 14 patients that 
died, 13 (93%) were African-American and this was statistically significant with a HR of 11.14 (95% CI:1.13-131.6). Multivariable analysis 
also showed significant association between tumor size and overall survival (HR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.17-1.49).  Disease recurrence was 
reported in 22 (16.3%) patients; however, this was not associated with tumor grade or stage at presentation. 
Conclusions: Metaplastic breast carcinoma is an aggressive disease and patients with a larger tumor size at presentation have worse 
overall outcomes. Results from our patient population with metaplastic breast carcinoma suggest that African-American women have worse 
survival compared to women of other races with similar characteristics. Characteristics such as age, obesity, grade, triple negative status, 
multifocal disease, presence of vascular invasion, and histologic morphology have no effect on overall survival.

Disclosures: Ali Afsari: None; Karen Anderson: Primary Investigator, Co-inventor on patent submission on 9p24.1 detection 
Background: 10-24% of invasive breast cancers (BC) are triple negative (TN), occur with increased frequency in younger African 
American (AA) women, are clinically aggressive with unfavorable outcome, and have no targeted therapy other than PARP inhibitors. Using 
array CGH of TNBC, “PDJ” amplicon on chromosome 9p24.1 including PD1-L1, PD-L2 and JAK2 has been shown to be enriched in a 
subset of TNBC with transcriptional upregulation of JAK2 and PD-L1. The objective was to assess PDJ amplification in breast and lymph 
node tissue from chemoradiation naïve AA women with TNBC and to correlate with disease-free survival and overall survival. 
Design: Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed from FFPE tumor blocks from primary TNBC (87) and axillary lymph nodes (15) in 
AA women. 2 separate 1 mm cores representing each case was scored. A novel multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
combined probe (Metasystems) mapping to 9q22 (FITC), 9q34.1 (Texas Red), and a combined JAK2/9p24.1 (PDJ) (TAMRA) was the 
enumeration probe set used to determine copy number alterations of the PDJ breakpoints. Ratio of PDJ out of 50 cells scored was 
calculated to determine amplification status. Ratios of PDJ to 9q22 and PDJ to 9q34.1 were calculated to distinguish polyploidy from 
amplification. Due to significant intratumoral heterogeneity, PDJ signal >4.0, PDJ/9q22>2 and/or PDJ/9q34.1>2 were calculated in the top 
10% of cells based on copy number. Survival data and data regarding distant control were gathered. Overall survival and disease-free 
survival were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank test. Patients were divided into groups according to their 
amplification status and univariate Cox regression modeling was performed to determine impact of amplification on survival. Statistical 
analysis was performed using SPSS ver. 21.0 (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY, USA) and statistical significance was achieved with a p-value ≤ 0.05.

Results: 48% (42/87) breast and 80% (12/15) nodes showed PDJ amplification; in 3 of 4 cases with paired breast, only the node showed 
amplification. 83% (35/42) had PDJ>4. Analysis of 64 cases revealed p=0.055 for overall survival with poor survival linked to an increasing 
number of amplifications. 
This figure measures the number of amplification present. 0=no amplifications 1= 1 amplification 2= 2 amplifications 3= 3 amplifications Chi

Conclusions: 9p24.1 (PDJ) amplification encoding JAK2, PDL1 and PDL2 is present in TNBC in AA females (AAF). JAK2 inhibitor may be 
a consideration for targeted therapy of AAF with TNBC, especially if nodes are positive. Testing on nodes may be useful.

Background: The recommended neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for HER2-positive breast carcinomas is combined chemotherapy and 
HER2-targeted therapies. Although the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate is high at 51%, therapeutic responses are not 
homogenous. For personalized therapy, investigation of new biomarkers is required to improve pCR rates. Estrogen receptor (ER) 
expression is reportedly correlated with pCR in HER2-positive breast carcinomas, while basal marker expression is related to worse 
prognosis in ER-negative HER2-positive breast carcinomas after NAC. Previously, we reported that high androgen receptor (AR) 
expression is useful to predict therapeutic response in HER2-positive breast carcinomas. In this study, we examined the relationship 
between multiple biomarkers including AR and therapeutic effects in HER2-positive breast carcinomas. 
Design: The study cohort comprised patients with HER2-positive invasive breast carcinoma undergoing surgery after NAC (±HER2-
targeted therapies) between 2007 and 2017. ER, AR, and basal marker (CK14, CK34βE12, EGFR) expression was assessed by 
immunostaining of pre-NAC biopsy specimens. ER was considered positive when Allred score ≥2, while the other markers were considered 
positive when Allred score ≥4. pCR was defined as QpCR (quasi pCR; grade 2b [near pCR] + grade 3 [comprehensive pCR]). 
Results: A total of 82 eligible patients was identified. Negative ER, positive AR, and basal marker expression was observed in 37 (45.1%), 
43 (52.4%), and 55 (67.1%) patients, respectively. pCR was observed in 40 patients (48.8%) (ER-negative: 22 [59.5%; P=0.08]; AR-
 
 
99 
positive: 31 [72.1%; P<0.001]; basal marker-positive: 31 [56.4%; P=0.05]). In the univariate analyses, negative ER, positive AR, and basal 
markers were significantly correlated with pCR; only negative ER (P=0.03) and positive AR (P<0.001) were correlated with pCR in 
multivariable logistic regression analyses. pCR was observed in 16 (80%) (P=0.006) ER-negative AR-positive and 15 (65.2%) (P<0.001) 
ER-positive AR-positive patients. pCR rate was significantly better in AR-positive patients regardless of ER expression. 
Conclusions: Multivariate analysis revealed that ER and AR are useful predictors of therapeutic effect compared with other markers, and 
AR expression was a better significant predictor than ER expression. AR assessment can also determine more responsive ER-positive 
patients, who have poorer pCR than ER-negative patients with HER2-positive breast carcinomas.

Disclosures: Rana Aldrees: None; Kui Zhang: None; Gene Siegal: None; Shi Wei: None 
Background: The Anatomic Stage Groups (ASG) have been arguably most powerful in predicting breast cancer (BC) outcomes. 
Recognizing the prognostic influence of histologic grade and ER/PR/HER2 status, the 8th AJCC mandates their incorporation and 
consolidation into the newly established prognostic stage groups (PSG). The subsequent observations of investigators’ incapability to 
assign up to 13.6% of BCs in the initial staging scheme have resulted in a major revision in the PSG table. The updated staging system 
provides pathological and clinical prognostic stage tables (PPSG/CPSG), with the former only used for patients having surgical resection as 
the initial treatment, and the latter for all patients. Given the increasing use of neoadjuvant therapy, PPSG cannot be assigned in a 
significant proportion of BCs. In this study, we sought to validate the CPSG in a cohort of 5,321 BCs, the largest of its kind from a single 
center. 
Design: All BCs diagnosed at the authors' institution between 1998-2018 were included. Analysis of BC-specific survival (BCSS) was 
performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. 
Results: Of 8152 invasive BCs diagnosed in the study period, 5,321 had all required elements for CPSG, received standard of care 
therapy and thus were included in the analyses. The median follow-up was 4.6 years. Compared to ASG, application of CPSG assigned 
15% and 25% of cases to higher and lower stage groups, respectively. The grade change was mostly observed in ASG IIA (29%) and IIB 
(22%). 7.2% of cases changed more than one stage group from ASG. CPSG provided an improved overall discriminating power in 
predicting BCSS when compared to ASG (Χ2=2739 vs. 2570, both P<.0001). Pairwise comparisons using the Cox proportional hazard 
model provided additional evidence of superiority for CPSG. The differences between IA and IB, IB and IIA, IIIA and IIIB as well as IIIB and 
IIIC were not significant for ASG. In contrast, all categories in CPSG showed a significant difference when compared to their proximate 
groups, except IB vs. IIA (HR 1.5, P=.06) and IIIA vs. IIIB (HR 1.4, P=.16). Moreover, the hazard ratio for IIIB was greater than that for IIIC 
in ASG while such scenarios were not seen in CPSG. 
Conclusions: The revised 8th AJCC CPSG provided a superior staging scheme for predicting BC prognostic outcomes in all patients 
receiving standard of care treatment. Further validation using the available data with larger populations and longer follow-up may be 
needed to refine and improve this table.

Disclosures: Melissa Alexander: None; Yuanxin Liang: None; Nebras Zeizafoun: None; Shabnam Jaffer: None 
Background: The Impassion 130 trial established the benefit of adding a checkpoint inhibitor for the first line treatment of metastatic triple 
negative breast cancer. This led to the FDA approval of atezolizumab and the companion PD-L1 (SP142) Assay, but with no specific 
indication for testing the primary versus the metastases (met). The goal of our study was to resolve this dilemma. 
Design: A total of 33 specimens from 22 patients were identified for which PDL-1 testing was performed based on oncologist request. As 
per Impassion 130 trial, we used the SP142 Assay with the cutoff of >/= 1% staining for positive immunohistochemical staining. 
Results: The 33 specimens were comprised of 17 primary breast carcinomas, 14 mets (liver-5, lymph nodes(LN)-4, lung-3, bone 
marrow(BM)-1, and brain-1) and 2 chest wall recurrences (CWR). Ten out 14 mets and both CWR were tested synchronously with the 
older primary mammary carcinoma. Of the 17 primary tumors, 8 were PDL-1 + and 9 were PDL-1 negative. Of the 14 metastases, 4 
were PDL-1 + and 10 were PDL-1 negative. When matched with the primary, synchronous findings were found in both the primary and 
 
 
100 
metastases in 4 cases (3+,1-); the remaining 6 cases were + in the primary and negative in the mets. Both CWR were + but only 1 of the 
primaries was +. 
Conclusions: We found a higher percentage of PDL-1+ in primary tumors (50%) compared to paired mets/CWR. This could be due to 
greater volume of tissue and immune cells in the primary tumor compared to scantier mets. In some mets sites such as BM and LN, 
distinguishing the host immune cells from tumor ones was challenging and presented issues with scoring. For these reasons, when 
evaluating PDL-1 in patients with mets or CWR, an attempt to retrieve the primary block should be done for concurrent PDL-1 evaluation 
for therapeutic benefit.

Background: In management of invasive breast cancers (IBC), status of HER2 (ERBB2) gene serves as a strong prognostic predictor & 
predictive marker of response to HER2 Targeted Agents (HTA). There is significant heterogeneity in response to these agents in HER2-
positive cases. Our aim was to determine the distribution of the status of HER2 by FISH in IBC along with its predictive implications. 
Design: IBC cases that were tested for HER2FISH & received HTA from 2006-2017 were identified. HER2FISH was interpreted using the 
ASCO/CAP guidelines at the time of reporting. Cases were grouped as follows: 1) Monosomy (ratio ≥2.0, mean HER2/cell<4.0) 2) Co-
Amplified (ratio<2.0, mean HER2/cell ≥6.0) 3) Low amplified (ratio ≥2.0, mean HER2/cell 4.0-5.9) 4) Amplified (ratio ≥2.0-2.99, mean 
HER2/cell >6) 5) Excessive Amplification (ratio ≥3.0) 6) 2013 Equivocal (ratio<2.0, mean HER2/cell 4.0-5.9) 7) Negative. Outcomes studied 
were recurrence, metastasis, second breast primary, disease specific survival (DSS) & overall survival (OS). 
Results: There were 226 cases, with median age 65 (range 26-98), 58% Caucasians, 24% African Americans, 1.5% others & 16.5% 
unknown. The median HER2FISH ratio was 2.47 (1.18-21) & HER2 signal/cell 5.71 (2.09-21). Table 1 shows categoric distribution of 
cases. 60/226-27% patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 139/226-62% hormonal therapy, 187/226-83% adjuvant & 146/226-65% 
radiotherapy. The median follow up was 207 weeks (4.3-708). Overall, 165/226-73% patients were alive without disease, 17/226-7% alive 
with disease, 33/226-15% died of IBC & 11/226-5% died due to other causes. 31/226-14% patients developed metastasis, 7/226-3% local 
recurrence & 4/226-2% second breast primary. The category of HER2FISH status was significantly associated with OS (p<0.05-Figure1), 
higher HER2 amplification was associated with fewer deaths, possibly reflecting a better response to HTA. Her2FISH status also 
statistically significantly relates to metastasis (p=0.04-Figure 2) & second primary (p<0.05) but not with recurrence (p=0.09) or DSS (p=0.5) 
in our cohort.

Conclusions: The current HER2FISH interpretation does not stratify as high or low amplification based on FISH results. In our study, we 
demonstrate that high HER2 amplification is significantly associated with longer OS; these patients seem to benefit more from HTA. We 
recommend reporting these categories when assessing HER2FISH in IBC. Larger, prospective longitudinal studies are needed to validate 
our findings.

Background: HER2 gene status as a primary predictor of responsiveness to HER2-targeted therapies in invasive breast carcinomas (IBC), 
is assessed by in situ hybridization (ISH) for HER2 gene amplification or protein overexpression assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). 
We sought to access the influence of changes in HER2 FISH ASCO /CAP reporting guidelines from 2007, 2013 and 2018 on HER2 status. 
Design: This is a retrospective study of patients with IBC, who underwent HER2FISH testing between 2006 and 2017. At our institution, 
HER2 status is first determined by HER2IHC staining. All the HER2IHC equivocal (2+) cases are reflexed to HER2FISH. HER2FISH status 
was assessed by using Vysis dual FISH probe (Abbott Molecular, Inc., FDA Approved PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit). A comparative 
analysis was made based on 2007, 2013 and 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines to assess HER2 status reclassification. 
Results: Complete data were available on 274 patients with equivocal HER2IHC results, 104 (38%) Caucasians, 52 (19%) African 
American, 4(1%) other, and 114 (42%) unknown. The results are summarized in tables 1-3 below.

Conclusions: We observed 27.2% reclassification rate by using 2013 guidelines compared to 2007, lower threshold for positive (from 
equivocal, 20.7% of patients re-classified to positive and 6.5% to negative HER2 status). In contrast, the 2018 updates eliminated the FISH 
equivocal category with concomitant Her2IHC correlation and additional scoring of tumor nuclei. Implementing 2018 CAP guidelines led to 
100% reclassification of 2007 equivocal cases into in 81.7% negative cases and 18.3% positive for HER2 status. Prospective data on 
survival is necessary to evaluate impact of 2018 guidelines on outcomes.

Santiago, Dominican Republic, 3Mexican Oncology Hospital IMSS, Cd Mexico, MEX, Mexico 
Disclosures: Isabel Alvarado-Cabrero: None; Rafael Estevez-Castro: None; Raquel Valencia-Cedillo: None 
Background: The vast majority of Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS) cases are incidental findings in excision and biopsies performed for 
other anomalies, however a small subset of both pleomorphic and classic LCIS may be clinically indentifiable due to their associated 
calcifications or their presentation as a mass lesion. Classic LCIS has long been considered a risk factor for invasive carcinomas, and 
treatment often consists of life long follow-up with risk-reduction rather than surgery. Pleomorphic LCIS and florid LCIS are typically 
considered to be more aggressive than classic LCIS, but management remains controversial. 
Design: In this study we describe the clinicopathologic features of 105 cases of florid lobular carcinoma in situ (FLCIS). The archives of the 
Department of Pathology were searched for all cases of FLCIS diagnosed on core surgical excision/mastectomy between 1997 and 2017. 
All LCIS lacked complete membranous e-cadherin immunostaining and were further classified as: a) pure FLCIS and b) mixed LCIS/ 
invasive lobular carcinoma. Clinical data was obtained from the medical records. 
Results: Median age at diagnosis was 54 years (range 22-79 years). At diagnosis 36 (35%) had a palpable tumor. The disease was 
discovered by mammography, with microcalcifications in 45 cases (43%), and opacities on mammography in 24 (22.8%). The lesions were 
initially identified in an excisional biopsy in 82 cases and in a mastectomy in the remaining 23 patients. In 39 (37.1%) of the cases the LCIS 
could be described as extensive, in that it was evident in multiple sections involved multiple noncontiguous terminal ductolobular units. An 
associated invasive lobular carcinoma was present in 69 (65.7%) patients. All invasive cancers lacked lymphovascular invasion. 
Contralateral LCIS or invasive lobular carcinoma was present in 10 cases (9.5%). All extensive LCIS cases were associated with invasive 
lobular carcinoma 
Conclusions: A substantial proportion of cases of florid LCIS (65.7%), was associated with invasive lobular carcinoma. In this study all 
cases of extensive LCIS were associated with invasive lobular carcinoma. Florid LCIS demonstrates features of direct precursor lesions 
warranting surgical excision. 
119 How Do Pathologists in Academic Institutions Across the United States and Canada Evaluate 
Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer? A Practice Survey

Disclosures: Jaya Asirvatham: None; Julie Jorns: None 
Background: Recent clinical trials have changed the management of axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer. There is little data on how this 
has influenced the way pathologists evaluate sentinel lymph nodes. 
Design: A questionnaire was sent to 11 Canadian and 33 US academic breast pathologists. 5 questions related to intraoperative 
evaluation (IOE) of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) and 9 to permanent sections. 
Results: 5 Canadian and 16 US pathologists, from 21 academic institutions (AI) responded. IOE of SLN is performed only for selected 
cases (mastectomy, post-neoadjuvant, ACOSOG Z11 non-qualifier) in 9 AI, for almost all cases in 8 AI, and not performed in 4 (3 
Canadian). 13 AI use frozen sections (FS) alone, 4 use FS and/or cytologic techniques (2 imprints, 1 smear, 1 either). 
During IOC, perinodal fat is completely trimmed in 8, not completely trimmed in 7, and variable in 2 (trimmed tissue submitted for 
extranodal extension (ENE) evaluation). For FS, in 12 AI the entire node is submitted sectioned at 2mm intervals. Practice is variable in 
the others. In all AI, non-sentinel lymph nodes are entirely processed at 2mm. Preferred plane of sectioning is parallel to long axis in 8 and 
perpendicular to long axis in 10, 3 variable). 
In 9 AI, only a single H&E slide is obtained from the FFPE block. In 12 AI multi-level evaluation is performed (2 H&E- 7 AI; 3 H&E-4 AI; 4 
H&E- 1 AI). In 6 AI, levels are between 1-10 μ deep; in 3 AI, between 10-50 μ deep and 2 AI between 100-200 μ. In 11 AI, cytokeratin 
immunostain is obtained if necessary on a case by case basis (suspicious cells, lobular variant, post-neoadjuvant). Routine keratin 
immunostain is obtained in 10 AI (only if lobular- 2 AI; only if frozen negative-2 AI). In 3 AI both AE1/AE3 and CAM 5.2 are obtained. 
19 pathologists document extent of ENE (2 qualitative). 11 would consider tumor cells in the pericapsular lymphatic space as 
lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and 10 would consider it isolated tumor cells (ITC). 
 
 
104 
Conclusions: There are areas of uniformity and dichotomy in practice. Frozen section is the preferred mode of SNL IOE. In most AI the 
entire SLN is submitted after sectioning at 2mm and this practice extents to evaluating non-sentinel lymph node for permanent sections; 
extent of ENE is documented. There is a dichotomy in practice with near equal support for routine vs case-by-case multilevel/immunostain 
evaluation, perpendicular vs parallel sectioning, complete vs incomplete fat removal and tumor in pericapsular lymphatics as LVI vs ITC. 
120 Adenosquamous Proliferations: Clarifying Histologic Features in a Series of 237 Complex 
Sclerosing Lesions

Disclosures: Emily Bachert: None; Lames Hamoodi: None; Virgilius Cornea: None; Therese Bocklage: None 
Background: Adenosquamous proliferations (ASP) are reported to occur in up to 60% of complex sclerosing lesions (CSLs). The nature of 
ASPs in CSLs remains unclear including definitional histologic features due in part to evaluation in small series only. ASPs are important, 
as they are proposed to be the precursor to the rare low-grade, triple-negative adenosquamous carcinoma (LGASC). Moreover, the 
distinction between a prominent ASP within a CSL and an early LGASC is subjective and has been suggested to be artificial. 
Design: Our objective was to determine ASP prevalence and quantitatively analyze ASP histologic features. We identified 306 breast 
specimens from 2000 to 2019 with a diagnosis of “radial scar” or “complex sclerosing lesion.” Three pathologists evaluated adequate cases 
for: 1) overall CSL size, 2) central nidus size, 3) presence of lymphocyte clusters, 4) nidus stromal composition, and 5) the presence of 
squamoid cells.  Chronic inflammation was defined as an aggregate of greater than ten lymphocytes or plasma cells located within or 
immediately adjacent to the nidus. Nidus stroma was classified as:  hyalinized/sclerotic, cellular/desmoplastic, or mixed. When applicable, 
the mixed stroma category was further sub-grouped into hyalinized- and cellular-predominant. Criteria for squamoid features included 
single cells or small groups with eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei visible at 100x magnification. 
Results: From the 306 cases identified, 237 unique complex sclerosing lesions/radial scars met diagnostic criteria (158 cases).  Patient 
age ranged from 20 to 81 years (median: 53). The average size of the overall lesion and the central nidus was 5.5 mm and 2.5 mm, 
respectively. Of the 237 lesions, 120 were positive for lymphoid aggregates (50.8%), and 87 (36.9%) demonstrated squamoid features 
(Table 1). Cases with a cellular stroma component of at least 50% were significantly more likely to demonstrate squamoid features and 
inflammation (74/87 and 74/120, respectively; p < 0.001).

Conclusions: In our large cohort, inflammation is commonly found in complex sclerosing lesions with squamoid features. Our findings 
negate the notion that prominent lymphocytes are a diagnostic clue to LGASC on limited biopsy material. Discordant with other series, in 
our cohort, cases with squamoid features were highly significantly associated with a cellular stroma component, suggesting a possible 
etiologic relationship between activated stromal cells and preneoplastic epithelial cells.

121 Adenosquamous Proliferations in Complex Sclerosing Lesions (CSLs): Analysis of PIK3CA, SOX4, 
ER and Luminal and Myoepithelial Marker Expression by Immunohistochemistry

College of Medicine, Lexington, KY 
Disclosures: Emily Bachert: None; Lames Hamoodi: None; Dana Napier: None; Virgilius Cornea: None; Therese Bocklage: None 
Background: Amplified SOX4 up-regulates the PI3K/Akt pathway in triple negative carcinomas and regulates epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition. PI3K/Akt pathway mutations occur in ~60% of CSLs and ~100% of low-grade adenosquamous carcinomas (LGASCs). Shared 
molecular and histologic features in adenosquamous proliferations (ASPs) and LGASC suggest the two entities are closely related. 
Design: Due to morphologic and genetic overlap between CSLs and LGASC, we sought to evaluate CSLs and ASPs by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate 1) IHC features of ASPs and CSLs, and 2) relationship to LGASC by protein expression. IHC 
stains were performed for PIK3CA, SOX4, ER, p40, and a breast cocktail (p63 and high-molecular weight keratin (CK) for myoepithelial 
staining plus CK8/18 and CK7 for luminal staining). The IHC panel was also performed on one LGASC. 
Results: Thirty four CSLs underwent IHC staining (n = 24). Fourteen cases (41%) had squamoid cells (single cells or small groups visible 
at 100x magnification with eosinophilic cytoplasm and round or spindle shape) consistent with ASP (Fig. 1). SOX4 demonstrated wild-type 
(W-T) expression (no significant difference from normal breast tissue) in all cases. PIK3CA showed W-T expression in the CSLs. 
Interestingly, even in spindle (presumed nascent) squamoid cells, PIK3CA expression was identified (Fig. 2). IHC for p40 highlighted rare 
squamoid cells in 9 CSLs. Diminished staining for ER in the CSL nidus was identified in 22 cases (65%). The breast cocktail identified 7 
CSLs with rare squamoid cells with myoepithelial-only staining and 8 cases with myoepithelial-only staining in ducts. For comparison, the 
LGASC demonstrated an identical staining profile as the ASPs. 
Figure 1 - 121 
 
Figure 2 - 121 
 
Conclusions: IHC results parallel morphologic and molecular findings in that ASPs and LGASC stain similarly. PIK3CA generally shows 
W-T expression. However, PIK3CA expression in squamoid stromal cells distinguishes these cells from surrounding nidus stromal 
fibrocytes at the IHC as well as histologic level and confirms these cells are distinctly different from surrounding spindle cells. Central 
epithelial elements lose ER expression further extending the similarity between ASP and LGASC. Absence of ER staining alone should not 
trigger a diagnosis of LGASC. The breast cocktail IHC reveals a range of reactivity in nidus epithelium in terms of M-E markers (p40, high 
molecular weight CK and p63). Wild type SOX4 expression in the ASPs and LGASC suggest that it does not play an etiologic role in these 
lesions.

Background: A subset of breast cancers with overexpression of HER2/neu (HER2) also show immunoreactivity for both the estrogen and 
progesterone receptors (ER and PR), a group that has been described as “triple positive breast cancers (TPBC)”. Although data is 
relatively limited on TPBC, emerging data suggests that anti-HER2 treatments are less effective in this group of cancers when compared 
with their hormone receptor negative (HRN), HER2 amplified counterparts. We aim to characterize the clinical and pathological features 
associated with TPBC and study their responses to HER2 targeted neoadjuvant therapy. 
Design: Clinicopathologic data associated with HER2 positive breast carcinomas from 2014 to 2018 were retrieved from our pathology 
database. Cases were separated in two groups: TPBC and HRN-HER2-positive. These two groups were compared regarding a variety of 
clinicopathologic parameters, including patient age, tumor Nottingham grade (1/2+ vs 3+), HER2 IHC status (3+ vs others), HER2 copy 
number, HER2/CEP17 ratio, and frequency of pathologically-determined complete response to neoadjuvant treatment (PCR). 
Results: Of 194 consecutive HER2 amplified breast cancers, 102 (52.5%) cases were TPBC. 93%, 4% and 3% of the TPBC group were 
invasive ductal, lobular, and mixed carcinomas respectively. TPBC were more often node-positive (56.8% vs 39.1%, p=0.013) and were 
less often IHC 3+ (57.8% versus 79%, p=0.004), when compared to the HRN-HER2-positive group. In the TPBC group, the median HER2 
signals/cell was 7.8 and the median HER2/CEP17 FISH ratio was 3.2. By comparison, for the HRN-HER2-positive group, the median 
HER2 signals/cell and HER2/CEP17 FISH ratio were 16.6 and 5.8, respectively. Among the patients that underwent neoadjuvant HER2 
targeted therapy, PCR was achieved in 12 of 58 (20.6%) TPBC as compared to 29 of 60 (48.3%) HRN-HER2-positive (p=.001). Both 
groups showed no significant difference in patient age. 
Conclusions: In our study cohort, 52.5% of HER2 positive breast carcinomas also expressed hormone receptors. Compared to other 
HER2 positive subtypes, TPBC are associated with lower mBR grade, higher rate of node-positivity, lower HER2 protein expression, and 
lower HER2 gene copy number. Notably, these tumors show lower rate of complete pathologic response to HER2 targeted neoadjuvant 
therapy.

Disclosures: Sunil Badve: None; Yesim Gokmen-Polar: None 
Background: Expression of the B7 family members such as PD-L1 provide critical co-inhibitory or co-stimulatory signals and have play a 
major immune modulatory role in cancer. The expression pattern and role(s) of B7 family members, apart from PD-L1, in epithelial 
neoplasms is not yet fully elucidated. The objectives of this study are to systematically characterize by immunohistochemistry the 
expression of 5 B7 family members, PD-1, PD-L2, B7.1 (CD80), B7.2 (CD86), and B7-H3 (CD276), in series of breast cancers. Expression 
of the B7 family m 
Design: We analyzed the expression of PD-1, PD-L2, CD80, CD86 and CD276 in a TMA series of 164 breast cancers. Briefly, following 
antigen retrieval with EDTA, 4um sections were incubated with the PD-1 (1:100, #315M-94; Cell Marque), PD-L2 (1:100, #82723S; Cell 
Signaling Technology), CD80 (1:200, #AF140), CD86 (1:200, #AF-141-NA) and CD276 (1;200; #AF1027) from R&D systems. Normal 
pediatric tonsils were used as controls. The staining was analyzed as follows. Negative- less than 1%; positive- greater than 1%. Reverse 
phase protein analysis (RPPA) data from the breast cancer cohort (n= 741 cases) of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was analyzed 
using the cBioPortal tool. 
Results: Expression of CD80, CD86, PD-1 and PD-L2 was essentially restricted to the immune cells of the germinal centers in normal 
tonsil whereas staining of the crypt epithelium was also observed with CD276. Within the breast, expression of CD86 was cytoplasmic, 
CD80 was cytoplasmic plus nuclear and CD276 was membranous and peritumoral. The expression pattern was similar in tumors. In 
cancers, PD-1 was observed only in TILs in 3 cases, PD-L2 membranous expression only was observed in 1 case. In contrast, the 
expression of CD80, CD86 and CD276 was observed in all cases analyzed, irrespective of the molecular phenotype. None of the cases of 
breast cancer were positive for PD-1 by RPPA. 
Conclusions: PD-1 and PD-L2 expression was rare. RPPA data from the breast cancer cohort in TCGA, which is based on tissue extracts 
that include stromal and immune cells confirmed the PD-1 expression data.  The lack of T-cell co-inhibitory molecules (PD-1 /PD-L2) and 
the high frequency of expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD80/CD86/CD276) may explain low response rates in breast cancer for 
PD-L1 immunotherapies. Alternative approaches are necessary for immune-oncological therapeutic strategies in breast cancer.

124 Androgen Receptor Expression in Breast Cancer: Rate and Patterns of Conversion in Recurrent and 
Metastatic Disease 
Gabrielle Baker, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 
Disclosures: Gabrielle Baker: None 
Background: Signaling via the androgen receptor (AR) is known to be involved in mammary gland development; however, its role in 
breast carcinogenesis and disease progression is incompletely understood. Whereas expression of the estrogen and progesterone 
receptors as well as overexpression of HER2/neu is routinely evaluated following a diagnosis of invasive mammary carcinoma (IMC), AR 
status is not typically evaluated outside of the setting of a clinical trial. Data regarding the role of AR expression in IMC is accumulating but 
only limited data exists regarding the degree to which AR status is conserved with disease progression. As the AR represents a potential 
therapeutic target, this study seeks to expand knowledge regarding patterns of AR status conversion in the settings of recurrent and 
metastatic breast cancer. 
Design: A cohort of primary IMC with matched, histologically confirmed recurrent and/or metastatic lesions having sufficient archival tissue 
for further immunohistochemical evaluation was identified. The AR status of all lesions was assessed via a commercially available AR 
antibody. Data were analyzed as binary results with AR positivity defined as nuclear expression of any intensity in ≥10% of tumor cells. 
Results: All patients were female and ranged from 20-82 years of age at initial diagnosis; most had a single recurrent or metastatic lesion 
available for evaluation (range 1-4; see Table). The majority of primary IMC was AR+ (81%; 38/47) and was of no special type (68%; 
32/47). Similarly, the majority of recurrent and metastatic lesions was AR+ (65%; 49/75). A subset of cases demonstrated AR status 
conversion in the recurrent and/or metastatic setting (18%; 13/74), the majority of these represent conversion from AR+ to AR- (85%; 
11/13). Of note, 4/13 cases with AR status conversion represented metastases to the central nervous system (CNS), all of which converted 
from AR+ primary IMC to AR- metastases.

Conclusions: In keeping with the existing literature, the majority of primary IMC in this series was AR+. In contrast to several prior reports 
citing maintenance of AR status in distant disease, in this study a subset of locally recurrent and metastatic disease exhibited AR status 
conversion with the loss of AR expression most notable in disease metastatic to the CNS. Although the sample size in this study is 
relatively small, the findings of AR status conversion in metastatic and recurrent IMC is not well documented in the literature and warrants 
awareness and further investigation.

Disclosures: Anne Bartels: None; Oluwole Fadare: None; Farnaz Hasteh: None; Somaye Zare: None 
Background: Non-mass enhancement (NME) on breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is defined as an area whose internal 
enhancement characteristics can be distinguished from the normal surrounding breast parenchyma, without an associated mass in the 
Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon. NME have been associated with a wide variety of benign or malignant 
lesions. In this study, we evaluated the outcomes of this enigmatic radiological finding at our institution, including the frequency with which 
malignancy is identified in the associated biopsy. 
Design: Our pathology data base was searched for all breast core needle biopsies (CNB) performed for a clinical indication of NME 
between 1/2010 and 8/2019. Radiologic and pathology findings were reviewed. 
 
 
108 
Results: A total of 443 cases were identified, comprising 5.5% of all CNBs. The age of patients ranged from 22 to 81 (mean: 51). The 
pathologic diagnoses were classified as malignant (20.5%), atypical (11.5%), and benign (67.5%).  Of the malignant cases, 63 (69.2%) 
were ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 28 (30.7%) were invasive carcinomas. Of the invasive cancers, 14 (50%) were invasive ductal 
carcinoma (IDC), 12 (39.3%) were invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), and 3 (10.7%) were mixed type carcinomas. 41%, 35% and 24% of 
the DCIS cases were high, intermediate and low grade respectively. Among the 51 atypical lesions, there were 23 (46%) atypical ductal 
hyperplasias, 4 (8%) flat epithelial atypias, and 24 (47%) lobular neoplasias (20 lobular carcinoma in situ and 4 atypical lobular 
hyperplasia). Benign lesions encompassed a spectrum of lesions that included fibrocystic changes, pseudoangiomatous stromal 
hyperplasia, fibrotic stromal changes, mastitis, and fibroadenomatous alterations. 
Conclusions: At our institution, approximately 5.5% of breast core needle biopsies were performed for NME, and up to 32% of these 
biopsies showed a neoplastic or atypical histologic finding. 20.2% of cases were carcinomas, most of which were in-situ. However, a large 
proportion of the invasive carcinoma in this setting were ILC (39.3%). The latter is notably disproportionate to the expected frequency of 
that histotype (approximately 10%) and highlights the need for the pathologist to look for potentially subtle disease in the radiologic setting 
of NME.

Background: Breast carcinomas (BC) are increasingly analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) for clinical decisions and trial 
eligibility. The most frequently altered BC genes include TP53, PIK3CA, PTEN, GATA3, CCND1 and RB1. TP53 is most frequently mutated 
in triple negative BC and may be prognostic and predictive of therapy response. The p16/ CDKN2A-CyclinD1(CycD1)/CCND1-Rb axis may 
also be prognostic and PTEN may be predictive. GATA3 mutations are often inactivating in luminal BC, which paradoxically have high 
Gata3 expression. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for these markers is readily available but correlation with mutation status is unclear. We 
analyzed IHC and mutation status of commonly mutated genes in a large cohort of BC to determine correlations for clinical utility. 
Design: NGS was performed targeting all exons of TP53 (n=124), GATA3 (n=130), PTEN (n=103), CDKN2A (n=103), RB1 (n=75) 
and CCND1 (n=104). Single nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions, focal amplifications (amp) and deep deletions (DD) were evaluated. 
Inactivating aberrations (IA) included frameshift, nonsense and splicing mutations and DD. IHC was performed on tissue microarrays of 
sequenced cases and was evaluable in all. Aberrant staining was defined: p53- negative (neg) or 2-3+ nuclear staining in >90% (DP); Pten, 
Rb, p16- neg staining; Gata3- neg or cytoplasmic staining; CycD1- DP. 
Results: Neg p53 IHC was sensitive (90%) and specific (98%) for TP53 IA, with 18/20 IA associated with neg IHC; 3 IHC neg cases were 
TP53 wild-type (PPV 86%, NPV 98%). DP p53 IHC was less sensitive (83%) for TP53 missense/inframe mutations (MI), with 6 MI cases 
lacking DP IHC. However, PPV of DP p53 IHC was 100%; no BC without MI TP53 had DP p53 IHC. Neg Pten IHC was highly sensitive 
(100%) for PTEN IA, but PPV of neg staining was only 44%, with 15 BC without IA being IHC neg. PTEN MI (n=2) did not show Pten loss. 
There was no correlation between GATA3 IHC and mutation; IA were not associated with protein loss. One GATA3 splicing mutation 
showed nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. Neg Rb IHC was not predictive of RB1 IA (PPV 29%), with 5/7 IHC neg cases lacking IA. DP 
CycD1 IHC had low sensitivity (62%) for CCND1 amp and PPV was 47%, with only 8/17 DP cases being amplified. No CDKN2A IA were 
IHC neg (n=4; PPV 0%).

Background: Angiosarcoma (AS) is a rare mesenchymal neoplasm with aggressive clinical behavior. Primary AS of the breast (PASB) is 
defined by lack of exposure to radiation therapy for prior cancer. AS from various anatomic sites have been shown to harbor recurrent 
alterations in TP53, MAP kinase pathway genes and genes involved in angiogenic signaling including KDR and PTPRB. MYC amplification 
is primarily seen in radiation-induced AS. Prior studies largely group AS arising in multiple sites and settings, with heterogeneous results. 
The pathogenesis of PASB has not been fully characterized. We profiled 10 PASB by capture-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) to 
determine whether these tumors have characteristic alterations. 
Design: Clinicopathologic data was collected for 10 patients, each with no prior history of breast cancer or radiation. DNA was extracted 
from 9 PASB and matched normal tissue, as well as 1 patient with a known pathogenic FANCA germline mutation who presented with 
bilateral AS 2 years apart. NGS targeted exons of 479 cancer genes, 40 introns and the TERT promoter. Single nucleotide variants, 
insertions/deletions and copy number alterations (CNA) were evaluated. 
Results: All patients were female with an average age of 45 years (range 32-64). Tumor size at excision ranged from 2.1 to 13.6 cm (mean 
5.2). All patients underwent mastectomy and 6 received adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. Two patients died of disease. Recurrent 
genomic alterations were identified in KDR (70%), PIK3CA/PIK3R1 (70%) and PTPRB (40%), each at higher frequencies than reported in 
AS across all sites (21%, p=.004; 21%, p=.004; and 4%, p=.006, respectively). Six cases harbored a KDR p.T771R hotspot mutation, and 
all 7 KDR-mutant AS showed evidence of biallelism (4 with loss of heterozygosity, 3 with two aberrations). Three cases were hypermutated 
(>10 mutations/Mb); both patients who died had hypermutated tumors. Copy number analysis revealed recurrent gains in chromosome 7 
(7/10), 8 (5/10) and distal 17q (5/10). The bilateral AS had shared mutations and CNA indicative of contralateral metastasis. 
No MYC, TP53, RAS or FLT4 alterations were detected.

Conclusions: PASB harbor KDR alterations more frequently than previously reported and its pathogenesis appears to be distinct from 
other AS. A subset of tumors is hypermutated, which is possibly associated with worse outcome but may be targetable.

Background: The Mediator Complex (MED) is a large multi-subunit protein which interacts directly with RNA Polymerase II and 
transcription factors for general regulation of protein expression. Recently, Mediator Complex 7 (MED7) has been shown to be 
underexpressed in high grade invasive mammary carcinomas in comparison to lower grade invasive carcinomas. No study has yet 
investigated the expression of MED7 in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). In our study, we set out to evaluate the biological significance of 
MED7 in DCIS. 
Design: MED7 immunostaining was performed with a rabbit monoclonal antibody (EPR15410, Abcam- Ab187146, Cambridge, UK). The 
H-score method was utilized for quantifying MED7 nuclear expression in DCIS. This method combines nuclear staining intensity and the 
percentage of positive cells. Staining intensity (0–3) is multiplied by percentage of positive DCIS cells (0–100) leading to the H-score, with a 
range of 0–300 for each case. We investigated breast core biopsies with DCIS; 20 were high grade, 14 were intermediate grade, and 15 
were low grade. The hormone receptor status of each case was also recorded. GraphPad PRISM 7.0 software was used for statistical 
analysis. 
Results: The mean H-Score for high grade DCIS cases was 146, intermediate grade was 219, and low grade was 228 (p <0.0001, 
Kruskal-Wallis test).  The mean H-score for high grade DCIS cases was significantly lower than that of low and intermediate grade DCIS (p 
<0.0001 and p = 0.0004, respectively, Dunn's test). The MED7 H-Score was significantly lower in ER negative cases compared to that 
seen in ER positive cases (p <0.0001). Area under the curve (AUC) in the ROC curve for MED7 H-Scores in high grade versus non-high 
grade DCIS cases was 0.9276 (p <0.0001).

Conclusions: Our results suggest that MED7 expression is significantly down regulated in high grade and ER-negative DCIS cases, thus 
implying a significant biological role of MED7 in the progression of DCIS. Taken together, our data establishes MED7 H-score as a tangible 
tool for evaluating high grade DCIS. Further studies are underway to establish a practical cut-off value for the MED7 H-Score for high grade 
DCIS. We believe that these important early steps investigating MED7 are crucial in clarifying its important role in the development and 
progression of breast and other cancers.

Background: Lobular carcinoma is the second most common type of invasive breast cancer. Triple-negative lobular carcinomas (TNLC) 
which do not express either hormone receptors or HER2, at the time of diagnosis, are extremely rare. Morphological, immunophenotypic 
and molecular characteristics as well as prognosis of these types of tumors are poorly known. The aim of this work is to better characterize 
TNLC through comparison with phenotypically close tumors. 
Design: We retrieved all TNLCs, at the time of diagnosis, in our databases between 2000 and 2018. Cases were compared to non-lobular 
triple-negative carcinomas (NLTNC) and to non-triple-negative lobular carcinomas (NTNLC), after being matched according to stage and 
Elston/Ellis grade. Clinical, morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics, as well as follow-up information’s, were collected. A 
comparative analysis of the different tumors molecular profiles (Exome and RNA sequencing by NGS) was also performed. Analysis of 
overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was done according to Kaplan-Meier method. 
Results: Thirty-eight cases of TNLC were analyzed. TNLC tumors accounted for 0.1% of invasive breast carcinomas diagnosed. TNLC 
shared some morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics with both control groups. However, some features were significantly 
different. Patients with TNLC were significantly older than those with NTNLC (p = 0.002) or NLTNC (p <0.0001). In immunohistochemistry, 
these tumors more frequently expressed SOX10 (p = 0.0351) and EGFR (p = 0.0006) than NTNLC, but less frequently than NLTNC (p = 
0.0001). Morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of the three groups, as well as comparison between groups are 
summarized in Table 1. Analysis of survival curves did not show a significant difference between the TNLC and the NLTNC. In contrast, 
TNLC OS (p = 0.0470) and PFS (p = 0.0388) was significantly worse than NTNLC (Figs 1 and 2).

Conclusions: Results show that TNLC have some distinct clinical, morphological and immunophenotypic characteristics but also share 
features with NTLNLC and others with NLTNC. At equal stage and grade, TNLC survival is comparable to NLTNC but much worse than 
NTNLC, despite an identical proliferation index (mitosis, Ki67). Molecular analysis, currently underway and presented during the USCAP 
2020 meeting, will attempt to find molecular explanations (mutations, activation of signaling pathway) to explain this prognosis, apart from 
the absence of hormone receptors expression.

Background: Magee Equations™ (MEs) are multi-variable models that can estimate oncotype DX® (ODX) recurrence score and ME3 has 
been shown to have chemopredictive value in the neoadjuvant setting as a standalone test (PMID: 23503643, 28548119). We recently 
described a decision algorithm using Magee Equations and tumor mitotic activity score to safely forgo ODX testing (PMID: 30395177). 
Design: The current study tests the accuracy of Magee Decision Algorithm (MDA) using a large in-house database. According to the 
algorithm, if all ME scores are <18, or 18-25 with mitosis score of 1, then ODX testing is not required as the actual ODX recurrence score 
(RS) is expected to be ≤25 (labeled “do not send”). If all ME scores are 31 or higher, then also ODX testing is not required as the actual 
score is expected to be >25 (also “do not send”). All other cases could be considered for testing (labeled “send”). We analyzed all ER+, 
HER2-negative cases sent for ODX testing with available pathology parameters for calculation of all MEs. Two different datasets were 
utilized-a retrospective database of 1824 cases (years 2007-2015) and 372 prospectively collected cases in the last 3 years sent for clinical 
ODX testing with a total of 2196 cases. 
Results: Of the 2196 cases, 1538 (70%) were classified as “do not send” and 658 (30%) as “send”. The classification accuracy in the “do 
not send” group was 95.1% (see Table 1). With respect to the “75 discordant cases”, 67 patients were from the retrospective database on 
which long term follow up was available. Of the 67 cases, 36 received chemo-endocrine therapy, 2 received chemotherapy only, 24 had 
endocrine therapy alone (mostly an aromatase inhibitor), and 5 did not receive any systemic therapy. The average follow up was 78 
months. There were 3 distant recurrences, 2 in patients that received chemo-endocrine therapy and one in a patient who did not receive 
any systemic therapy. No distant recurrences were recorded in the group that received hormonal therapy alone.

Conclusions: The Magee Decision Algorithm using Magee Equations and mitosis score accurately identifies cases that will not benefit 
from ODX (or other similar) testing. Such cases constitute ~70% of the routine clinical ODX requests. If Magee algorithm is regularly used 
in routine practice, then it will save at least $300,000 per 100 test requests. The occasional discordant cases (expected ≤25, but actual 
ODX RS >25) appears to have an excellent outcome on endocrine therapy alone.

Background: Magee Equations™ (ME) are multi-variable models that can estimate oncotype DX® recurrence score. Magee Equation 3 
(ME3) which utilizes only estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2 and Ki-67 semi-quantitative results is chemo-
predictive in the neoadjuvant setting (PMID: 28548119). 
Design: A multi-institutional study involving 8 institutions was undertaken to examine the validity of ME3 in predicting response to 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER+/HER2-negative breast cancers. The study was limited to stage I-III cases diagnosed in the year 2010 to 
2014 in order to facilitate comparison to the original study from the same time-period (PMID: 28548119). 
Results: A total of 166 cases met the inclusion criteria. The patient age ranged from 24 to 83 years (median 53 years) with 75 patients 
(45%) age 50 years or younger. The average pre-therapy tumor size was 3.9 cm, and axillary lymph nodes were confirmed positive by pre-
therapy core biopsy in 85 of 166 cases (51%). Pathologic complete response (pCR) was seen only in tumors with ME3 scores >25, with the 
highest pCR rate in tumors with ME3 score 31 or higher (see table).  The pCR rate was not different in patients ≤50 years (n=75) and was 
again determined by ME3 scores (0% pCR in scores <18, 0% in 18-25, 11% in >25 to <31, and 27% in 31 or higher; p-value: 0.0092). 
Other Magee Equations (ME1, ME2, and average score) were also evaluated in 159 of 166 cases which showed similar results as ME3 
(data not shown). Pre-therapy tumor Nottingham grade also predicted for chemotherapy response (pCR in grade I: 1/20 [5%]; grade II: 3/89 
[3%]; grade III: 13/57 [23%]; p-value I & II versus III: 0.0002); however, stratification using ME3 showed the best results. There were no 
distant recurrences and no deaths in 17 patients with pCR. In the remaining 149 cases with residual disease, ME3 score of >25 was 
associated with significantly shorter distant recurrence-free survival and showed a trend for shorter breast cancer-specific survival (see 
figures).

Conclusions: The results of this multi-institutional study are similar to previously published data from a single institution (PMID: 28548119) 
and confirms the chemo-predictive value of ME3 in the neoadjuvant setting. Additionally, ME3 may provide prognostic information in 
patients with residual disease and this should be further evaluated.

Background: Lynch syndrome (LS) is an inherited cancer-susceptibility disorder due to pathogenic germline mutations in DNA mismatch 
repair (MMR) genes, including MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Syndromic patients (pts) are known to have increased risk for colorectal, 
endometrial, ovarian, small bowel, urothelium, biliary tract, and gastric carcinoma (CA).  Controversy exists if breast carcinoma (Br CA) 
should be considered a LS related neoplasm.  This study assesses a cohort of known LS pts with Br CA. 
Design: Br CA pts with known LS were identified from an institutional registry.  Data collected included age at Br CA diagnosis, prior 
relevant tumor diagnoses, histopathologic features including tumor type and grade, ER, PgR and HER2 status, stage, tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs).  Mismatch repair (MMR) immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 was performed and scored 
blinded to the germline results. 
Results: Table 1 collates the data collected. Overall, 50% of Br CA pts were found to have loss of MMR proteins that corresponded to their 
known mutations.  The average age for pts with MMR proficient (MMR-p) tumors was 49.4 (range 42-65) while the average pt age for MMR 
deficient (MMR-d) tumors was 62. Prior CA diagnoses (colon CA, n= 2 identified 9 and 10 years prior and urothelial CA, n=1 identified 2 
 
 
117 
years prior) were seen in 60% of the MMR-d group and in 20% of the MMR-p group (endometrial CA, n=1 identified 9 years prior).  Tumor 
morphology was variable in both groups while MMR-d and MMR-p tumors had similar ER, PgR and HER2 status. Stromal TILs in the 
MMR-d group averaged 45% (range 10-85%) while MMR-p cases averaged 12.5% (range 10-15%).  MMR-d tumors were seen most 
commonly in pts with MLH1 mutations (3/5), while none of the MMR-p tumors were germline MLH1 mutated.

Conclusions: We found that half of Br CAs seen in LS were MMR-d and correlated with known mutations. Higher numbers of TILs were 
noted in this group and given that PD1/PDL1 inhibitors work in MMR-d tumors, prominent TILs might serve as a potential biomarker of 
response. The MMR-p group average age of Br CA diagnosis was a full decade younger than the MMR-d group (49.4 vs 62) and although 
these cancers were not Lynch related, it brings up the importance of vigilant screening in this population. Given that the majority of pts in 
the MMR-p group had no prior CA history, their germline mutations were identified on multi-panel gene testing owing to the Br CA 
diagnosis, supporting the broadening use of such assays.

Background: Immune-related biomarkers have emerged as actionable targets in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We used 
quantitative digital spatial profiling to 1) characterize the immune architecture of distinct tumoral and stromal regions in TNBC and 2) 
identify spatially-defined prognostic immune biomarkers. 
Design: From the FinXX trial of adjuvant fluoropyrimidine therapy, FFPE whole tumor sections from a patient subset with TNBC, matched 
for treatment arm and outcome (N=44) were assessed with the Nanostring GeoMx™ DSP platform. Using 3-plex immunofluorescence 
(pan-cytokeratin, CD45, CD68 with SYTO-13 dye), tumor and stroma segments (N=950)  were classified as 1) Peripheral Peritumoral 
stroma (PTS) or 2)Adjacent tumor (PTTu), 3)Intratumoral stroma (ITS) or 4) Adjacent tumor (ITTu) and 5)central tumor with no stroma 
(CTu). Per segment, digital quantitation (NanoString nCounter®) of 42 immune biomarkers, including immune cell profiling proteins (e.g. 
CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11c, CD20, CD56, CD68, PD-1; PD-L1), immune drug targets (e.g. VISTA, STING, IDO1), and activation status-
related proteins (e.g. ICOS, PD-L2, CD40, CD40L, CD44) was performed. Normalized, differentially-expressed (DE) proteins were 
evaluated for associations with durable recurrence free survival (RFS)(> 1.5 fold change (FC); p< 0.05). 
Results: 20 DE immune proteins were significantly associated with RFS, including 5 “spatially-agnostic” biomarkers (PD-L1, PD-L2, CD20, 
IDO1, and fibronectin), enriched in ≥ 4 (of 5) tumor and stroma segments, and a “spatially-constrained” subset, restricted to ≤ 3 segment 
classes (N=15). Among the latter, CD4, CD8, CD11c, CD45, TGFB1 and VISTA were prognostic only in PTTu segments (FC 1.5-1.9); 
CD44 was associated with RFS only in ITTu. Overall, top up-regulated proteins associated with RFS were PD-L2, CD56 and HLA-DR (FC> 
3 in ≥1 segment). Tumor segments had the most prognostic DE immune proteins: PTTu (N=18), ITTu (N=12) and CTu (N=11), with 9 
shared proteins (CD20, CD40, CD56, HLA-DR, IDO1, ICOS, beta 2 microglobulin, PD-L1 and PD-L2). Stromal segments had 3 shared 
RFS-associated DE immune proteins (PD-L2, IDO1 and fibronectin, FC: 1.6-4.0). 
Conclusions: With DSP-based quantitative mapping, we identified novel groups of spatially-agnostic and spatially-constrained prognostic 
immune proteins in TNBC. PD-L2, CD56 and HLA-DR were the top DE proteins and the peripheral tumor had the largest unique protein 
set. These data add a new dimension to our understanding of the immunobiology of TNBC.

Background: Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a rare histological type of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is not sensitive 
to adjuvant therapy and have poorer prognosis. MBC is a group of neoplasm exhibiting metaplastic change to squamous or mesenchymal 
elements. The prognosis predictive significance of tumor infiltration lymphocytes(TILs) has been well demonstrated in breast cancer 
especially in TNBC. Additionally, the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 has heterogeneous expression type in diverse tumors. This study 
aimed to investigate the diversity of immune parameters in different components of metaplastic breast carcinoma. 
Design:  All the patients diagnosed with MBC from January 2006 to December 2017 were included in our study. Patients with recurrences 
at diagnosis, previous malignances, immune deficiencies were excluded. The medical records and tumor slides were reviewed. The 
percentage of stromal TILs, intratumoral TILs, TILs at the invasive margin were evaluated. The stromal TILs were also quantificated. 
Besides, the quantification of CD4+ and CD8+ TILs using immunohistochemistry  were evaluated by digital image analysis (Halo imaging 
analysis software; Indica Labs, Corrales, NM). The immunohistochemical expression percentage of PD-1 and PD-L1 in tumors and stroma 
were also analyzed by digital software above. All these variables were re-evaluated separately by two pathologists blind to clinical data. 
Statistical analysis was performed with t test, chi-square test, univariate and multivariate cox regression. 
Results: 61 patients were included in our study. The median age at diagnosis was 50 years (range: 25-81years). The clinicopathological 
characteristics were listed in Table 1. There is a median follow-up of 48 months (range: 22-163 months). More stromal TILS (>30/0.1mm2) 
 
 
119 
in MBC were proved to be associated with longer disease-free survival (DFS) (HR, 0.26; 95%CI, 0.07–0.97), and this trends become 
stronger in MBC with squamous cell cancer (HR, 0.07; 95%CI, 0.008–0.64). Also, more CD4+ (>25/0.1mm2) TILs and CD8+ (>7/0.1mm2) 
TILs were also associated with longer DFS (CD4: HR, 0.12; 95%CI, 0.02–0.93; CD8: HR, 0.21; 95%CI, 0.05–0.95), . The >1% expression 
of PDL1 in tumor  (HR, 0.19; 95%CI, 0.04–0.85) and >1% expression of PD1(HR, 0.20; 95%CI, 0.05–0.91) in stroma were both associated 
with longer DFS.

Background: Metaplastic breast carcinoma with osseous differentiation is a rare histopathological type of breast neoplasms. Clinical 
outcomes of which were extremely poor and optimal treatment remains challenging. We performed a next generation sequencing to identify 
genetic alterations of metaplastic breast carcinoma with osseous differentiation, seeking to possible therapy strategies. 
Design: 4 metaplastic breast carcinomas with osseous differentiation without neoadjuvant therapy were included in our study (Figure 
1).Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was conducted on DNA/RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue using the 
FoundationOne assay. All classes of genetic alterations (GA) including base substitutions, indels, copy number alterations and selected 
genomic rearrangements (Table 1). Additionally, genomic signatures including microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden 
(TMB) are reported. 
Results: CGP revealed 14 GAs (3.5 per tumor), 3 of which were clinically relevant genomic alterations.3 of 4 patients have detected 
clinical relevant genomic alterations. Mutations in coding exon 20 (H1047R) of PIK3CA were detected in 2 cases, which indicates that 
these patients may benefit from mTOR inhibitors, including everolimus and temsirolimus.1 cases detected a classical GA of EGFR 
(L858R), means the tumor may respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 3/4 patients had TP53 mutations. Other GAs 
including RB1, TET2, PIK3CA, FGFR1, JUN, NSD3, ZNF703a, MUTYH and RAD21. All RSs were MSI stable, the mean TMB was 4.75 
mutations/megabase (Mb), and none (0%) featured TMB >10 mutations/Mb. Limitations include the small sample size.

Conclusions: PIK3CA and TP53 change were frequently found in metaplastic breast carcinoma with osseous differentiation. All MSI-
status of these four cases were stable. 1 case exhibited a TMB burden of 9 mutations/Mb, indicating it may respond to immune therapy. 
Further study involving epigenetic changes of metaplastic breast carcinoma is awaiting to find possible treatment strategies.

Background: High grade metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a rare subtype of invasive breast carcinoma, mostly triple-negative. It is 
currently known as being associated with a worse outcome and less sensitivity to chemotherapy than invasive carcinomas of no special 
type. The goal of this study was to review the clinicopathological features of patients with MBC. 
Design: 65 patients diagnosed from 2005 to 2017 in our institution with high grade MBC were retrospectively included. Clinicopathological 
and immunohistochemical data were reviewed (antibody panel: ER, PR, AR, HER2, Ki67, CK5, CK14, EGFR, SOX10, PDL1 and TROP2). 
 
 
122 
Results: Median age was 59.5 years (median follow-up: 52 months). 9% of patients had metastatic disease at diagnosis. Nineteen patients 
received neoadjuvant therapy with 5 pathological complete responses (26% pCR). Most tumors were pT1/pT2 (77%) and 12% were pN+. 
Histological subtypes (squamous, spindle cells, mesenchymal, mixed) were 35.5%, 9%, 15.5% and 40%, respectively. TILS levels were 
low (median: 10%) except when squamous differentiation was present. Most of the tumors were triple negative (92%) and expressed at 
least one of the three surrogate markers (CK5, CK14 or EGFR) for basal-like breast cancer (93%). RA was positive in 19% of the cases, 
TROP2 85% and SOX10 32%. PDL1 was positive in tumor cells in 18% (cut-off: 1% of positive tumor cells) of the cases and in tumor-
infiltrating immune cells in 40% (cut-off: 1% of tumor area). None of the markers studied were specific to one of the subtypes of MBC but 
SOX10 was negative in pure spindle cell carcinoma and more frequently expressed in pure mesenchymal MBC (7/9 (78%)) than in other 
types of MBC (12/50 (24%)) (p<0.05). Five years survival rates were 88% (overall survival, OS) and 92% (breast cancer specific survival, 
BCSS). pN+ and lymphovascular invasion were statistically associated (p < 0.05) with poorer OS and BCSS. Seven (11%) patients had a 
local recurrence. Patients with pure spindle cell MBC had statistically worse local recurrence free survival. 
Conclusions: Conclusion: MBC demonstrate low TILs breast carcinomas than IC-NST but better survival rates than those reported in the 
literature. Interestingly, SOX10 was negative in spindle MBC and expressed in the majority of mesenchymal MBC. In a non-negligible 
proportion of cases, PDL1 and AR expression underpin patients that may benefit from new targeted therapeutic strategies.

Background: Amyloidosis of the breast is rare and can occur as a localized process or may be part of a systemic disease including light 
chain (AL) amyloidosis or amyloidosis associated with chronic inflammatory diseases. The most common clinical presentation is of a 
palpable unilateral mass that may be associated with calcifications. We set out to further characterize mammary amyloidosis with respect 
to clinicopathologic features and classification of amyloid precursor proteins.  
Design: An electronic search was performed over a 20-year period (1/2000 – 1/2019) for mammary amyloidosis from two institutions. H&E 
and Congo Red slides were reviewed. Clinical and imaging data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Liquid chromatography 
mass spectrometry (LCMS) was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue blocks in selected cases.  
Results: Nine female patients with mammary amyloidosis were identified with a mean age of 65 years (range: 41-84) (Table). Five patients 
(59%) presented with suspicious mammographic calcifications, one of which was bilateral. One patient presented with bilateral palpable 
masses. One patient presented with a palpable mass that was found to be invasive mammary carcinoma with adjacent incidental amyloid. 
The presentations of the remaining 2 patients were unknown. Amyloid deposition was found in stroma, periductal (Figure, A), and 
perivascular locations. Calcifications typically occurred in stromal amyloid. Congo Red confirmed the presence of amyloid in 8/8 cases 
tested showing characteristic apple green birefringence (Figure, B). Seven cases submitted for LCMS showed amyloid to be of the AL type

Background: Circulating free DNA was first described over 60 years ago. Since then, its potential use to help clinical management of 
patients with breast cancer (BC) has been proven. In patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), analysis of circulating tumor 
DNA (ctDNA) has been shown to be useful for the monitoring of minimal residual disease. In the present work we study the variation of 
ctDNA throughout the neoadjuvant treatment as well as its correlation with the pathological response in the resected specimen and its 
potential ability to predict pathological complete response. 
Design: 18 patients with triple negative (TN) or HER2 positive BC who underwent NAC were analyzed in order to evaluate TP53 (exons 5-
9) and PI3KCA (exons 9 and 20) mutations by sanger sequencing in primary FFPE samples. Plasma samples at diagnosis, 1st cycle, 
middle treatment and at surgery where obtained. For each patient, a mutation in PIK3CA or TP53 identified in the tumor tissue was 
assessed in the plasma at multiple time points throughout neoadjuvant treatment, using Sysmex Inostics’ SafeSEQ technology.  SafeSEQ 
is a next-generation sequencing method which employs Safe-SeqS target enrichment technology (Kinde et al. 2011) and unique molecular 
identifiers to provide ultra-high sensitivity detection of low frequency mutations present in circulating tumor DNA with maximum specificity. 
All patients underwent a surgical excision after NAC. 
Results: 6 patients (33%) showed TP53 and 2 (11%) PI3KCA mutations in the primary tumor. Both PI3KCA mutations were observed in 
HER2 positive tumors while TP53 mutations were mainly observed in TNBC (88%). After the 1st cycle of NAC, no mutations were detected 
 
 
124 
in 6 (75%) patients while the 2 remaining (25%) were no further detected since the middle of the treatment. Interestingly, one patient 
showed a TP53 baseline mutation (TP53 p.R273L) that was no longer detected after the 1st cycle of NAC but a new mutation was revealed 
at the time of surgery (TP53 p.R267W), even there was no evidence of malignancy in the resected specimen. 7 (88%) patients reached a 
pathological complete response (pCR). 
Conclusions: ctDNA detected in plasma of patients with TN or HER2 positive BC showed a sharp decrease from the first cycle of NAC 
reaching undetectable levels until the time of surgery, correlating with pCR. However, new mutations not previously present appeared, 
even if no residual disease was observed in the surgical specimen, reflecting the adaptation of the tumor to treatment.

Background: Pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAT) has prognostic implications, and data on 
correlation of response between breast and regional lymph nodes (RLNs) is limited. Documentation of retrieval of a previously biopsied 
positive RLN is important for assessment of response and further management. This may be accomplished through biopsy clip placement 
at time of biopsy followed by radioactive seed-localization (RSL) prior to definitive surgery. Pathologists document retrieval of biopsy clip, 
radioactive seed, and histologic biopsy site changes. This study explores the correlation between chemotherapy response in breast and 
RLNs and evaluates the accuracy of RSL of RLNs. 
Design: Copath Natural Language search was used to identify 155 post-neoadjuvant surgical specimens from 153 patients. Cases were 
segregated based on pre-therapy lymph node status. Pre-and post-therapy pathology data, including tumor type, biomarker status, 
response to therapy, evidence of biopsy site changes, and clip retrieval were recorded. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate impact of 
hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status. 
Results: In 109 cases, pre-NAT biopsy of RLN was performed: 106 core biopsy and 3 fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA). Following NAT, 
RSL of RLN was performed in 63/74 cases with positive RLN biopsy, 7/35(20%) cases with negative RLN biopsy, and 0/46 cases with no 
pre-NAT RLN biopsy. Overall pCR rate was 33%. Breast and RLN correlation and post-NAT RLN evaluation results shown in Table 1. HR 
and HER2 status did not impact correlation rates (Figure 1). Retrieval of biopsied RLN in 6/74 cases could not be confirmed due to: RSL 
failure (1), clip placement failure (1), possible insufficient pathology evaluation (1), no biopsy clip placed (2), indeterminate (1).  
Six of 35 (17%) cases with negative pre-therapy RLN biopsy had residual RLN involvement, and 7/46 (15%) cases without pre-therapy 
RLN biopsy had residual RLN involvement, with all cases also showing residual disease in the breast.

Conclusions: Correlation between breast and RLN response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is high, with < 2% cases overall showing 
complete response in the breast but residual RLN disease. Pathology documentation of previously biopsied RLN is important for accurate 
staging and determination of response to NAT. Additional patient or specimen imaging, deeper H&E levels, and radiology-pathology 
correlation may be needed when retrieval of previously involved RLN cannot be confirmed.

Background: 15-25% of patients diagnosed with ADH on CNB will have an upgrade to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive breast 
cancer (IBC) at surgical excision (SE). Reliable identification of patients at low risk for upgrade who can be spared SE remains an 
important clinical goal. 
Design: 427 patients with ADH on CNB who underwent subsequent SE from Jan 2000- March 2018 were identified. After excluding 
patients for whom slides were not available, those with a prior or current history of ipsilateral breast cancer, those in which the ADH 
involved another lesion, and MRI biopsies there were 286 patients available for analysis. Clinical and radiographic features and histologic 
sections of the CNB were reviewed blinded to outcome. 
Results: CNB was performed for microcalcifications in 91%; 8 - 11G needles and vacuum assistance were used in 93% of cases. 46 
patients (16%) had an upgrade to DCIS (n= 39; 14%) or IBC (n=7; 2%) at SE. Upgrade was not significantly related to any clinical features 
(age, race, menopausal status, family history of breast cancer, Gail risk score). There was no association between risk of upgrade and the 
nature of the imaging target, imaging guidance method, or needle gauge. Pathologic features significantly associated with upgrade were 
the number of terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) involved by ADH (mean 4.6 in patients with upgrade vs 2.7 in patients without upgrade; 
p= 0.0001) and severity of atypia (upgrade rate 33% for cases categorized as severely atypical bordering on DCIS  vs 7% for other cases; 
p=0.0001).  Among 24 cases with both >3 involved TDLUs and severe atypia bordering on DCIS, the upgrade rate was 54%. Conversely, 
among the 150 cases with <2 involved TDLUs and without severe atypia bordering on DCIS, the upgrade rate was 10%. Among 83 cases 
where ADH involved only 1 TDLU without severe atypia bordering on DCIS, the upgrade rate was 7.2 % (5 cases of DCIS and 1 case of 
DCIS + IBC). 
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the largest study of ADH on CNB with central pathology review of all cases. Our results indicate 
that a more limited extent of ADH and absence of severe atypia bordering on DCIS were associated with lower upgrade rates. However, 
the upgrade rate among this low risk group is still ~7%.  We are currently evaluating whether a machine learning model combining clinical, 
imaging and pathologic features can improve the identification of patients with ADH on CNB who can be spared surgical excision.

Background: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive subtype of breast cancer that poses significant diagnostic and 
treatment challenges. Particularly little is known about patients with a secondary IBC arising in a breast previously treated for non-
inflammatory breast cancer. In this study, we sought to characterize the clinical and pathologic features of secondary IBC compared with 
de novo or primary IBC. 
Design: Retrospective analysis of clinical and pathologic data was performed for a cohort of 406 patients with clinically confirmed IBC who 
were enrolled on an IRB approved IBC registry between July 1991 and Oct 2018. 
Results: Of the 406 IBC pts in this cohort, 38 (9.4%) had a personal history of prior ipsilateral non-inflammatory breast cancer, with a 
median interval of 108 months (mo) between the diagnosis of historical breast cancer and the secondary IBC (range 6-297 mo). 80% 
(28/35) of the historical breast cancers were invasive carcinomas; the majority (22/28=79%) being invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC). Most 
(15/23=65%) were poorly differentiated, and either estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative (15/31=48%) or triple negative (TN, 
9/29=31%). Similarly, the majority of tumors in both the secondary IBC and primary IBC groups were poorly differentiated IDC (26/37=70% 
vs 229/355=65%). However, when secondary IBC was compared with primary IBC, there was a significant difference in receptor profiles 
(p=0.009462):  secondary IBC had a higher proportion of TN disease compared with primary IBC (14/36=39% vs 92/359=26%), while 
primary IBC had a higher proportion of HER2-positive disease (151/353=43% vs 5/39=13%). 
Secondary IBC tended to arise in older women compared with primary IBC (50.8 vs 60.6 yrs p=0.0001) . Both secondary and primary IBC 
pts had similar rates of de novo metastatic disease (12/36=33% vs 107/361=30%). While outcomes were generally poor for both groups, 
there was a striking decrease in overall survival (OS) for secondary IBC compared with primary IBC (median OS=75 mo vs 49 mo, 
p=0.0148).  
Figure 1 - 141 
 
Conclusions: Secondary IBC demonstrates distinct clinical and pathologic features and follows a more aggressive clinical course 
compared with primary IBC. These results shed light on a very rare, previously poorly characterized, subset of breast cancer that warrants 
increased investigation.

Background: There is evidence implicating WNT/β-catenin signaling in the pathogenesis of breast cancer.  IHC studies have 
demonstrated nuclear expression of β-catenin in tumor samples, indicating activation of the pathway, while normal samples showed a 
membranous, or inactive, staining pattern.  Elevated protein levels of β-catenin have also been detected by Western blotting of breast 
tumor lysates.  Additionally, a correlation was detected between beta-catenin and cyclinD1 (known oncogene) activation.  Therefore, it is 
currently accepted that activation of the canonical WNT signaling pathway contributes to tumorigenesis in many breast cancers.  Most of 
the studies thus far have focused on its role as a predictor of poor outcome in Basal-like cancers.  Here we look at the potential role of 
WNT/β-catenin signaling as a predictive marker in Luminal A breast cancers. 
Design: Using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) data from the TCGA breast invasive carcinoma dataset (USCS Cancer Genome 
Browser), primary tumor samples that had PAM50 subtyping were isolated.  Beta-catenin protein levels were examined and compared 
across the dataset by PAM50 subtype and compared with other protein values. 
Survival curve analyses were performed using the KMPlotter software based on microarray-based RNA expression data for the indicated 
genes. 
Results: A TCGA analysis (Zhang, Borcherding et al, 2016) showed that protein expression correlating with β-catenin differs in Luminal A 
vs. Basal-like cancers.  In Luminal A breast cancers, β-catenin expression is associated with ER pathway proteins.  In basal-like cancers, it 
is associated with WNT signaling pathway proteins (Fig 1). 
Here we found that improved overall survival in Luminal A breast cancers was significantly correlated with high RNA expression of multiple 
WNT/β-catenin pathway markers (β-catenin, LEF1, TCF4, FZD1, WNT1 and DVL3).  For GSK3B, which is part of the inhibitory complex 
that blocks WNT signaling, RNA levels did not correlate with survival (Fig 2). 
When a correlation was observed in Luminal B and Basal-like cancers for any of the genes, expression correlated both with improved and 
decreased survival, depending on the specific gene (Fig 2). 
Figure 1 - 142 
 
 
128 
Figure 2 - 142 
Conclusions: Activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling is associated with improved survival in Luminal A breast cancers.  This supports prior 
evidence that WNT/β-catenin signaling activates the ER pathway in ER positive cancers.

Background: Deep learning is an essential component in advancing the efforts of digital pathology to improve diagnostic accuracy and 
patient care. It can encompass algorithms that can be trained and tested for image classification and diagnostic purposes. Although many 
breakthroughs in pathology have been developed through this technology, deep learning algorithms can be complex to generate and 
difficult to interpret. Here, we demonstrate the utility and validation of a coding-free deep learning image classifier using histologic variants 
of high grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast, which represent a well classified and commonly encountered breast pathology 
entity suitable for validation and adjunct classification by machine learning algorithms. 
Design: A total of 334 high-resolution images of variants of DCIS (comedo-type: 97, cribriform: 72, micropapillary: 69, and solid: 96) were 
obtained from our departmental archives. The images were used to train two deep learning algorithms including the well-studied ResNet-50 
model and a coding-free custom image classifier and visual recognition model created with the IBM Watson Visual Recognition platform. A 
total of 80 high resolution images from our institutional archives were used to test both algorithms (Figure 1). 31 images from outside cases 
were used to assess the accuracy of the coding-free image classifier, to test for generalizability. 
Results: Our results highlight that the ResNet-50 model and the coding-free image classifier have a comparable accuracy of 88% and 
90%, respectively (Table 1). Both models predicted correct outcomes with an average confidence score of > 0.80. Outside image cases 
were correctly classified by the coding-free image classifier with an accuracy of 90%, thus highlighting its generalizability.

having to embark into coding architecturally complex deep learning algorithms.

Background: Fibroepithelial lesions (FELs) of the breast include a spectrum of neoplasms ranging from fibroadenomas (FAs) and variants 
of phyllodes tumors (PTs). It is well known that the classification of FELs can represent a challenge in core needle biopsies (CNBs), when 
overlapping features between these lesions may be present. In those instances, a diagnosis of FEL is often rendered thus leading to 
surgical excision for definitive characterization. Here, we demonstrate how the use of two custom deep learning and visual recognition 
models aids in the classification of challenging FELs in CNBs of the breast.  
Design: 92 cases diagnosed as FEL on CNB, but with a corroborating diagnosis of FA or benign PT on excision were retrieved from our 
departmental archives. 590 high resolution images were obtained from whole slide imaging of the CNBs (FA: 373, PT: 217). The well-
studied deep learning ResNet-50 model was trained using 472 images, and then tested for classification of 118 images (FA: 68, PT: 
50). We also used a coding-free custom image classifier and visual recognition model created with the IBM Watson Visual Recognition 
platform, that was trained with 437 images and tested for an additional 153 images (FA: 81, PT: 72).  
Results: The average confidence score for both models and FA and PT categories was of > 0.8. The coding-free image classifier showed 
an overall increased accuracy, failing to correctly predict 7% of the images compared with 17% by the ResNet-50 model (Table 1). Both 
 
 
130 
models performed comparably for FA identification. However, the coding-free image classifier showed greater specificity than the ResNet-
50 for PT classification.

Conclusions: Both visual recognition models tested show high accuracy in the classification of challenging FELs of the breast. In our 
cohort, the coding-free image classification model has increased specificity for PTs when compared with the ResNet-50. The results 
showcase that the coding-free model is an accessible, easy to interpret tool that shows a comparable performance to the established 
ResNet-50 model and highlight the importance of incorporating deep learning in our pathology practice as an adjunct tool for the evaluation 
of complex cases.

Background: Breast carcinomas (Ca) with osteoclast-like giant cells (COGC) are very rare. They show distinct stromal features, but their 
molecular characteristics remain insufficiently known. We report clinical and pathology data for 16 CCGO, and whole exome sequencing 
(WES) and RNA-seq results for a subset of cases. 
Design: All cases diagnosed at our institution in 2000-2019 were included. Clinical and pathology data were retrospectively reviewed. IHC 
for CD34, CD68, CD163 and Perls’ stain were done on 11 COGC and 10 matched non-COCG Ca. WES (8 COGC tumor/normal pairs) and 
RNA-seq (7 COGC and 7 matched non-COCG Ca) were performed on nucleic acids extracted from fresh frozen tissue (NovaSeq6000, 
PE100). 
Results: Histology subtypes of COGC were: 11 (69%) non-specific type Ca (NST), four (25%) metaplastic Ca (MC) and one mixed 
NST/lobular Ca with focal COGC. Median age at diagnosis (years) was 46 (33-68) for COGC-NST and 72.5 (53-84) for COGC-MC. Median 
tumor size was 18mm (6-32) for COCG-NST and 30mm (21-35) for COCG-MC. Elston-Ellis grade was 1 (n=4), 2 (n=6) or 3 (n=1) for 
COCG-NST and 3 for all COCG-MC. All COGC-NST were ER+, PR+, HER2-, Ki67 was <14% in 5 (45%) cases. All COGC-MC were triple-
negative with Ki67>20%. Two COGC-NST and the mixed case had axillary lymph node metastases. All COGC-TNS patients were alive 
disease-free at median follow-up of 71 months (21-128) for COCG-TNS and one COCG-MC patient had inoperable recurrence, median 
follow-up 27 months (10-74). The patient with mixed Ca died of disease (metastases were non-COGC). 
There was evidence of recent or past stromal hemorrhage in all COGC cases and only one control. CD68+ infiltrate and CD34+ vessels 
were significantly more abundant in COGC than in controls, while CD163+ infiltrate and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were not. WES 
revealed mutations in PIK3CA (n=2), MAP3K1 (n=1), MAP2K4 (n=1), AKT1 (n=1) and BRAF (n=1), but not TP53. Most cases (n=6) had 
simplex genomic profiles; 11p gain/16q loss (n=2), 8p loss (n=2), 16q loss (n=2) were seen. 
Transcriptomic profiles of COGC differed strikingly from controls. Upregulated pathways included osteoclast maturation and function. There 
was significant upregulation of RANK, RANKL and downregulation of OPG. 
Conclusions: Most COCG are luminal A or B IC-NST in young patients, and a subset are MC. Their genomics are somewhat similar to 
non-COCG luminal IC-NST except for absence of TP53 mutations, but gene expression profiles are strikingly different. Exploring the 
RANK/RANKL/OPG axis appears warranted.

146 Breast Sentinel Lymph Node Frozen Section Practice: An Enterprise Audit as a Guide for Moving 
Forward 
Rebecca Czaja1, Julie Jorns1

Disclosures: Rebecca Czaja: None; Julie Jorns: None 
Background: It is standard of care to process sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) by slicing at 2 mm intervals, with the goal of detecting 
macrometastatic disease (≥2 mm). CAP protocols outline that at least one H&E level per SLN be evaluated, with one level deemed 
adequate, given appropriate sectioning, in recent publications. However, we, like many other practices perform multiple levels and/or 
immunohistochemistry (IHC). We sought to evaluate our practice and outcomes, with focus on more challenging SLN frozen section (FS) 
cases, in consideration of institutional protocol changes. 
Design: We conducted a retrospective database search (8/17-7/18) for cases of breast SLN FS from our enterprise (1 academic institution 
(AI) and 2 community sites (CS)). Clinicopathological features were assessed by chart and slide review. Cases were reviewed for grossing 
technique and discordance between FS and permanent section (PS) (i.e. false negatives (FN) due to sampling (SE) or interpretive error 
(IE)). 
Results: Of 216 patients, 99.1% were female, avg 57.2 yrs, with 29.6% having undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy. (Table 1) 189 
(87.5%) cases were from the AI and 27 (12.5%) from CS. 
Adherence to the 2 mm sectioning protocol was higher at the AI (157/189, 83.1%) vs CS (4/27, 12.5%) , where SLN were more frequently 
bisected, regardless of size. 
11/216 (5.1%) had FN FS results, with 4 (1.85%) having micrometastatic, 3 (1.4%) pN1 and 4 (1.85%) pN2 disease, with median 
metastatic size of  0.2 cm (range 0.1-0.9 cm). FN were due to SE for 9 (81.8%) and IE for 2 (18.2%). Two patients (0.9%) with FN FS later 
went axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Most (8/9, 88.9%) with FN FS due to SE had metastasis identified on the 1st PS level (of 3) 
and the other was identified on the 2nd PS level. 
Higher FN was seen at CS (2/27, 7.4%) vs AI (9/189, 4.8%). 
Of 7 patients with FN FS and macrometastic disease, 3 (42.9%) were not serially sectioned; the other 4 (57.1%) underwent neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy. (Figure 1) (Figure 2)

1 pT stage X was due to the presence of lymphatic involvement only following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 2pN stage X was due to the 
presence of metastases to contralateral axilla SLN only (ipsilateral SLN not assessed); this case represents one of two with M1 status).

Conclusions: Review of SLN FS cases highlighted gaps in awareness of institutional protocol (an educational opportunity), especially at 
CS. Most discordant cases were small metastases, due to SE and did not elicit ALND. Additionally, most FN FS due to SE were identified 
on the first PS level, supporting decreasing PS levels going forward. We plan to increase the timeframe of this study to further support this 
practice change.

Background: Metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) is a rare histologic subtype of triple-negative breast cancer. MBCs are characterized by the 
differentiation neoplastic epithelium into squamous, spindle, chondroid or osseous components. MBCs commonly harbor TP53 mutations, 
which are less frequent in MBCs with a predominant spindle cell component. TERT promoter mutations, reported in up to 52% of phyllodes 
tumors of the breast, are thought to be absent or extremely rare in breast carcinomas. Here, we sought to determine the frequency 
of TERT promoter hotspot mutations in MBCs. 
Design: Forty-three MBCs were centrally reviewed according to the criteria put forward by the World Health Organization. Estrogen 
receptor (ER) and HER2 status were defined according to the ASCO/CAP guidelines. All MBCs were subjected to Sanger sequencing 
for TERT promoter hotspot loci. TP53 mutation status was available in 22/43 cases. In addition, 8 MBCs previously subjected to targeted 
sequencing were interrogated for TERT promoter and TP53 mutations. 
Results: Our series was comprised of 43 MBCs classified into MBCs with predominant chondroid (46%, 20/43), spindle cell (26%; 11/43), 
osseous (7%; 3/43),) and squamous (21%; 9/43) components. 91% (39/43) and 9% (4/43) of MBCs were of histologic grades 2 and 3, 
respectively. The vast majority of MBCs (95%; 41/43) were ER- /HER2- and 5% (2/43) were ER- /HER2+. TERT promoter C228T 
mutations were identified in 14% (6/43) of cases interrogated, including MBCs with a predominant spindle (n=3), squamous (n=2) and 
osseous (n=1) components. Of note, the TERT mutated MBC with a predominant osseous component (80%) also exhibited a minor spindle 
cell component (20%). One case from the additional cohort (11%, 1/8) of MBCs harbored TERT C228T promoter mutation. Interestingly, 
63% (19/30) of the MBCs analyzed harbored TP53 mutations; of the 3 cases harboring TERT promoter hotspot mutations, 66.7% (2/3) 
were TP53 wild-type. 
Conclusions: A subset of MBCs harbor TERT promoter hotspot mutations and appear to be enriched for tumors with predominant spindle 
or squamous cell differentiation. TERT promoter hotspot mutations appear to predominantly affect TP53 wild-type MBCs. Our findings 
suggest that the assessment of TERT promoter mutation might not be suitable for the differential diagnosis of spindle cell MBCs and 
phyllodes tumors. 
148 Deep Learning Applied to the Highly Subjective Nuclear Grading of Breast Cancer: Correlation with 
Patient Outcome 
Leslie Dalton, St. David's South Austin Medical Center, West Lake Hills, TX 
Disclosures: Leslie Dalton: None 
Background: Nuclear grading (NG) of breast cancer has been shown to provide significant ability in risk stratification of patients with 
invasive breast cancer. But, NG is not regarded as an acceptable biomarker given subjectivity in assessment. The presumed objectivity of 
deep learning (DL) might provide a remedy, but first a DL method must show ability in predicting patient outcome (PO). 
Design: Used were H&E stained tissue microarrays (TMAs) originally prepared by USA National Cancer Institute and currently 
administered by Univ. Virginia. Obtained were whole slide images of each TMA. The so-called progressive TMAs served for training a 
model and the test set was comprised of 797 tumors from the prognostic TMAs. To train the model, a single pathologist separated 
thousands of image panels into high, and low grades as well as stroma. Intermediate grade was assigned by borderline results between 
the extremes. The algorithm, a convolutional neural network, was coded in python with use of functions from open source keras/tensorflow. 
Results: By Kaplan-Meier, deep-learning grade (DLG) corresponded to  p < 0.00001 across all cancers in patients <=70 yo. P-values were 
also < 0.00001 by the original full tissue section pleomorphism score (PS) and the grade assessed by examining only the TMA sample 
(TMA-NG). Time-dependent receiver operator curves revealed area under curves (AUCs): DLG=0.63.8; TMA-NG= 64.9; PS=60.4; and 
Nottingham score (NS) 65.7. After DLG was substituted for PS in summation of NS, AUC = 67.7. The sum of TMA-NG, PS and DLG 
corresponded to AUC=66.7. No significant difference was seen in delta AUC between DLG versus PS, or DLG versus TMA-NG.  
Conclusions: In the brief space allowed for reporting results, survival statistics were emphasized since patient outcome (PO) is the optimal 
endpoint to judge merit as compared to a nebulous kappa threshold (and kappa statistic results were not impressive). In predicting PO, 
DLG was comparable with pathologist assigned grade, but not an improvement. An advantage of DLG, is a model can be validated at level 
of PO, and then widely deployed. The AUC of the sum of DLG, PS, and TMA-NG was higher than the separate evaluations of each. This 
would not occur with complete redundancy in evaluations. This suggests that discordance among several opinions added value. At this 
juncture, DLG shows promise at being a source for an additional opinion. DLG is not ready for daily practice.

Background: Despite the advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) continues to 
carry a worse prognosis and disproportionately affects African American women (AAW). Deciphering the immune microenvironment can 
improve the diagnostic yield of pathological specimens. 
Design: We analyzed H&E slides from two different cohorts. The first cohort included women with invasive breast cancer (n=117 black, 
n=102 white). The second was a cohort of black women with invasive TNBC between 2007 and 2013, who did not undergo neoadjuvant 
therapy (n=155). Clinical and demographic data in both phases were obtained. Two pathologists blinded to the clinical, molecular, and 
demographic characteristics associated with the tumors, examined and quantified the extent and pattern of lymphocyte distribution within 
the tumor and native surrounding tissue. Lymphocyte aggregates configured as clusters of cells surrounding a high endothelial venule or 
capillary were designated as organized lymphoid structures (OLS). Immune cell subtypes were estimated from expression data of the 
TNBC cohort using CIBERSORT. Associations were evaluated using logistic regression while survival was evaluated using Cox regression. 
Results: Within the first cohort, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were present in 60.4% of the tumors and women with TNBC were 3.6-
fold more likely to have TILs present (p=0.004). Race was not associated with TILs. Tumors with TILs were 4.4-fold more likely to have 
OLS present (p<0.001), regardless of the percent of TILs. Presence of OLS was independently predicted by both race and subtype, where 
black women were 2.4-fold more likely (p=0.009) and TNBC were 2.3-fold more likely to have OLS (p=0.035). Given this racial and subtype 
associations with OLS, we evaluated relationships between OLS, its composition and survival in a cohort of black women with TNBC. OLS 
were present in 51.3% of tumors, similar to TNBC of black women in the first cohort (58.3%). OLS was not associated with survival in AAW 
with TNBC when adjusting for TNM stage, age, chemotherapy, and TILs. Immune cell subtypes in OLS were enriched for naïve B cells 
(p=0.008) and surprisingly a T cell polarization toward follicular helper T cells signature (p=0.003). 
Conclusions: OLS can be sites of de-novo adaptive immune response or a mechanism for cancer immune evasion. An integrative 
histopathological and molecular characterization is a convenient and fast platform for hypothesis generation and validation.

Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is used to treat patients with high-risk breast cancer and enables pathological 
assessment of the tumor response. The tumor response can be classified as either a pathological partial response (pPR) or pathological 
complete response (pCR), with pCR defined as eradication of invasive tumor in breast and lymph nodes and associated with significantly 
better survival. Given that only 35% of patients achieve a pCR, predicting the response to NAC remains a significant clinical challenge. The 
objective of this proof of principle study was to determine if automatic tumor nuclei detection using a digital pathology platform and artificial 
intelligence (AI) could predict response to NAC. 
Design: From a retrospective cohort of breast cancer patients receiving NAC between 2010-2017 at our institution, pre-NAC H&E-stained 
breast core biopsies were selected from 22 pCR cases and 21 pPR cases. A breast pathologist manually annotated invasive carcinoma on 
scanned whole slide images to serve as the ground truth to train an AI algorithm (Figure 1A). Convolutional neural networks, with a U-Net 
architecture, were used to decompose images into tumour components including tumour nuclei (Figure 1B). 
Results: Confusion matrix assessment showed 96% accuracy in detection of tumor nuclei, confirming the validity of our AI 
algorithm. Between the pCR and pPR groups, there were no significant differences in age, menopausal status, tumor size, multifocality, 
grade, proportion of triple negative tumors, type of chemotherapy or number of cycles received. However, the pCR group had significantly 
fewer ER/PR+ tumors (46% vs. 76%) and more HER2+ tumors (77% vs. 48%). The average tumor nuclei count assessed by our AI 
 
 
135 
algorithm was significantly higher in the pCR group (6.08 ± 1.77 vs. 5.10 ± 1.16, p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression was then 
performed to control for identified confounders including ER/PR status and HER2 status. Overall the model was significant (χ2=18.446, p < 
0.001) and correctly classified 77% of cases. For each additional tumor nucleus detected, the likelihood of achieving pCR was 
approximately doubled (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.01 – 3.76). 
Figure 1 - 150 
 
Conclusions: Automated tumor nuclei detection using digital pathology and AI can successfully predict pCR post-NAC in patients with 
breast cancer. Future research taking into account additional tumor and micro-environmental features will allow for development of 
increasingly accurate tools to predict tumor response.

Background: Micropapillary carcinoma (MPC) is a rare, morphologically distinctive breast tumor composed of small clusters that display 
inverted polarity and loss of stromal adhesion. Patients with MPC present with high rates of lymph node metastasis (LNM) and poor 
prognosis. While aberrant WNT signaling has been widely implicated in tumor progression, its role in MPC is unclear. We explored WNT 
activity in MPC by examining the signaling components beta-catenin (CTNNB1) and lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1). 
Design: We assessed CTNNB1 and LEF1 nuclear expression by IHC in 50 breast carcinomas using a tissue microarray (TMA) enriched 
for MPC, and in resection specimens from 15 cases of MPC ranging in pT (pT1, n=7; pT2, n=4; pT3, n=4) and N stage (N0/N1(mi), n=7, 
N1, n=5, N2/N3, n=3). CTNNB1 and LEF1 staining in MPC and in adjacent invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) were evaluated by H-score 
(H=intensity score 0-3 x % cells staining=0-300). For comparison we assessed expression of MYC, EMA, and E-cadherin. 
Results: LEF1 nuclear expression was observed in the majority of MPC in the TMA (20/28, 71%, H-score: 87, range 5-200) and in 
resections (11/15, 73%, H-score: 59, range 5-200) but only rarely in IDC (TMA: 1/22, 4%, H-score: 80, p<.005; IDC[adjacent] in resections: 
1/11, 9%, H-score: 10, p<.005). In resections, LEF1 expression was associated with increased tumor size (LEF1+ tumors had average size 
of 4.8 cm vs. LEF1- tumors avg. 1.35 cm; p<.05), increased lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (10/11 LEF1+ tumors displayed LVI vs. 0/4 LEF- 
tumors, p<.05), and increased LNM (9/11 LEF1+ tumors displayed LNM vs. 1/4 LEF- tumors, p<.05). LEF1 expression was also observed 
in MPC-LVI foci from all ten tumors displaying MPC-LVI, as well as in MPC-LNM deposits from 4/5 positive N1 lymph nodes (H avg=137.5). 
No MPC tumors displayed nuclear accumulation of CTNNB1 in TMA or resections (staining was membranous). The beta-catenin/LEF1 
complex promotes transcription of growth regulators such as MYC; we observed no MYC expression in MPC. E-Cadherin levels (at 
 
 
136 
intercellular membranes and in cytoplasmic vesicles) were reduced (while EMA staining was unchanged) in LEF1+ MPC (n=41/50 tumor 
clusters) vs. LEF1- MPC (n=5/50, p<.005), suggesting reduced cellular adhesion. 
Conclusions: Our study shows increased nuclear expression of LEF1, but not CTNNB1, in MPC. Upregulation of LEF1 correlates with 
increased tumor size, LVI, and LNM in MPC. We suggest that LEF1 may be a useful ancillary test for predicting LVI and LNM in MPC.

Background: Pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ (PLCIS) is a variant of lobular carcinoma in situ, with an inadequately characterized 
immunophenotype, behavior, and management. The expression of hormone receptors ER, PR, and HER2 are powerful prognostic and 
predictive markers in breast cancer.  The expression of tumor suppressor p53 in breast cancer cells and the expression of transcription 
factor FOXP3 in both tumor cells and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are features associated with aggressive behavior.  We 
investigated the expression of these markers in PLCIS to gain a better understanding of the clinical and biological behaviors of this 
disease. 
Design: The pathology database was searched to identify PLCIS cases diagnosed between 2014 and 2019, along with clinicopathologic 
characteristics. Expression of ER, PR, p53, and FOXP3 were assessed by IHC. HER2 equivocal (score 2+) cases were evaluated by 
FISH.  ER, PR, and HER2 were graded using ACSO-CAP guidelines. p53 was positive when >10% of tumor cells had nuclear 
immunoreactivity, and FOXP3 was positive when ≥ 1% of tumor cells or TILs had nuclear immunoreactivity. 
Results: Thirty-one cases were identified in female patients ages 38 to 89 (median age = 63). Twenty-seven cases (27/31, 87%) were 
positive for ER, 20/31 (65%) were positive for PR, 4/30 (13%) had overexpression of HER2 (score 3+), 5/30 were HER2 negative (score 1+ 
or 0), and 21/30 (70%) were HER2 equivocal (score 2+) by IHC.  Of the equivocal cases, 10% were HER2 FISH positive (2/21) and 90% 
were HER2 FISH negative (90%). p53 was positive in 16/29 cases (55%). FOXP3 was positive in TILs in 12/29 cases (41%), but was 
negative in all cases of PLCIS (<1%). Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) was present in 13/31 cases (42%) and DCIS was present in 3/31 
cases (10%). Eight of the PLCIS with ILC cases were FOXP3 TIL positive (8/12, 67%) and all were negative in the tumor cells (<1%). Of 
these ILCs, two cases were positive for p53, one case was positive for HER2, and the remainder were HER2 negative

Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that PLCIS has an unfavorable IHC profile (decreased PR expression, overexpression of HER2, 
and increased expression of p53). Notably, FOXP3 expression in TILs correlated with more aggressive behavior and the presence of ILC. 
In PLCIS, treatment targetable markers associated with a poorer prognosis (HER2, p53, and FOXP3) are overexpressed and should be 
considered as primary markers to assist with treatment decisions

Background: De-escalation strategies are a focus of current breast cancer research. The IBCSG trial questioned the significance of 
micrometastases and the Z0011 trial suggested women with <3 positive SN having BCS and whole breast irradiation may avoid axillary 
lymph node dissection. Considering the favourable biology of screen-detected breast cancer, our aim is to determine pre-operative factors 
that identify cohorts who may safely avoid axillary surgery. 
Design: After IRB approval, we searched our database for invasive breast cancers detected by population based mammographic 
screening. A range of demographic, imaging, histologic and biomarker data were assessed to predict nodal involvement with conventional 
statistics and machine learning techniques of XGBoost, CART and logistic regression software.  
Results: Between Jan 2012-Feb 2017, 374 women, mean age 63.0 years, 96% asymptomatic, are included. Imaging size was ≤15mm in 
242 (65.1%). Axillary ultrasound (AUS), performed in 262 (70.1%) was abnormal in 53 (14.4%). Axillary FNA, performed after abnormal 
AUS, was abnormal in 30 (11.4%) women. Histology grade was G1: 88 (23.5%); G2: 163 (43.6%) & G3: 118 (31.6%). Overall, 272 (73.9%) 
cancers were N0; 96 (26.1%) had ≥1 positive node.   
Univariate log binomial regression analysis revealed significant associations between nodal disease and age, breast symptoms, imaging 
morphology, location, imaging size (binary, 15mm threshold), AUS, grade, ER, PR, Ki-67, HER2, molecular subtype and histology subtype. 
Multivariable models retained axillary assessment and imaging size as predictive of nodal involvement. For machine learning models, the 
data were split randomly into a training set (n=284) and a test set (n=47). The ‘boosted tree’ model outperformed other machine learning 
techniques with an overall accuracy of 80.3%. The most significant factors were again identified as imaging size and axillary assessment. 
On the basis of this combined analysis, we have identified women with grade 1 cancers, ≤15mm on imaging, with normal AUS or biopsy 
negative axillary assessment, as having a 4.17% chance of nodal disease. This group comprises 18.3% of women with available axillary 
assessment data.

Conclusions: The chances of nodal involvement in women with grade 1 screen-detected breast cancers, ≤15mm on imaging and negative 
axillary ultrasound/FNA assessment is less than the commonly accepted 5% false negative rate of sentinel node biopsy. Avoidance of 
routine axillary surgery may be plausible for these women.

Background: The role of androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor therapy in AR-positive breast cancer (BC) is evolving. AR splicing variant-7 (AR-
V7) is a truncated variant of AR, previously described in prostate cancer, which leads to constitutive activation of AR signaling and 
resistance to AR inhibitor therapy. AR-V7 has also been identified in hormone-receptor positive and negative BCs (primary and metastatic). 
Use of aromatase inhibitors (AI) in ER-positive BC, which halts the production of estrogen from androgen, may upregulate AR signaling 
and lead to increased AR-V7. We assess the clinicopathologic features of AR-V7 in BC to evaluate if screening certain BC prior to trial 
enrollment is warranted.  
Design: BC with AR and ER immunohistochemistry and clinical DNA and/or RNA sequencing results were screened for fusions. After DNA 
sequencing, BC reflexed to RNA sequencing during the period studied (9/2018-6/2019) included triple-negative tumors with no driver and 
ER-positive/ESR1 wildtype tumors progressing on therapy. All BC with AR-V7 identified by RNA sequencing were included, as well as a 
subset of AR-V7 negative specimens with various receptor profiles. 
Results: Among 52 FFPE cases (52 with RNA sequencing, 51 with DNA sequencing and 51 with IHC), 35% (18/52) were AR-V7 positive 
and 65% (34/52) AR-V7 negative. AR-V7 did not alter AR IHC expression, as all AR-V7 positive cases were AR IHC positive. Table 1 lists 
cohort histology and receptor profiles. AR-V7-positive BC were more likely to have mutations in AKT1 (p = 0.03) and FANCA (p = 0.03). Of 
18 AR-V7 positive BC, 50% (3/6) of primary and 42% (5/12) of metastatic/recurrent tumors had prior exposure to AI for treatment of same 
or a prior hormone-positive BC. Apocrine morphology was observed in 39% (7/18) of AR-V7 positive BC and 3% (1/34) of AR-V7 negative 
BC (p = 0.002). In all, only 28% (5/12 metastatic/recurrent; 0/6 primary) AR-V7 tumors were both negative for apocrine morphology and AI 
naïve at the time of AR-V7 detection (Figure 1).

Conclusions: AR-V7 is present in a high proportion of BC with apocrine morphology and from patients with prior AI therapy. Screening for 
AR-V7 in patients with AR IHC positive BC, apocrine morphology and/or prior AI therapy may be prudent prior to treatment with AR 
inhibitors.

Background: Mucocele-like lesions (MLL) of the breast are characterized by extravasated acellular mucin pools adjacent to mucin filled 
dilated ducts. They usually present as mammographic calcifications. The incidence of MLL in core needle biopsies (CNB) is low and 
optimal management is not standardized, with the literature showing varying rates of upgrade on excision. The purpose of this study is to 
help determine optimal management of patients diagnosed with MLL on core biopsy. 
Design: After institutional review board approval, the databases of two different hospitals were searched for MLL for the period of 2008-
2018. All core biopsies showing MLL were identified; any MLL with ADH or carcinoma (ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive 
carcinoma) were excluded. Data that was collected included the reason for CNB (calcifications versus mass), the method of biopsy 
(ultrasound, stereotactic, MRI), needle gauge, and number of cores taken. Patient data, including demographics, subsequent excisions, 
length of follow up, and whether the patient developed subsequent breast cancer was also recorded. 
Results: 46 CNB with MLL were identified. 38 cases were biopsied for calcifications and 8 were biopsied for a mass, with or without 
calcifications. Of the 46 cases, 21 underwent excision with no upgrades to DCIS or invasive carcinoma. 22 of the 24 patients (one patient 
had two CNBs) who did not undergo excision had follow up ranging from 9-95 months (median=42 months) and none developed breast 
carcinoma (neither DCIS nor invasive carcinoma). 
Conclusions: This study shows no upgrade of MLL diagnosed on CNB to breast carcinoma (DCIS and invasive carcinoma). Of the 
patients with follow up who did not undergo excision of MLL, none developed breast carcinoma. While the number of cases in this study is 
small, this study argues against routine excision of MLL found on CNB.

156 Androgen Receptor Expression and Tumor Immune Microenvironment in Ductal Carcinoma in Situ 
(DCIS) of the Breast

Disclosures: Brian Finkelman: None; Julianne Ubago: None; Luis Blanco: None; K. P. Siziopikou: None 
Background: The androgen receptor (AR) pathway has emerged as a potential therapeutic target of interest in breast cancer. Overall, 60-
80% of breast carcinomas are AR+, with heterogeneous expression in different molecular subtypes. Recent studies also suggest that AR 
overexpression may be inversely correlated with both tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) levels and PD-L1 expression in TILs in HER2+ 
breast carcinoma. AR expression in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), however, is poorly understood. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no 
data are available on how AR expression in DCIS may interact with the tumor immune microenvironment. 
Design: Our population consisted of patients with pure DCIS, treated with definitive surgical therapy at our institution (2008-12). DCIS 
Molecular subtypes were defined as: Luminal A (ER+/HER2-), Luminal B (ER+/HER2+), HER2-enriched (ER-/HER2+), and basal-like (ER-
/HER2-). Tissue microarrays were constructed with 3 cores/case to account for tumor heterogeneity. HER2 equivocal (score 2+) cases or 
with insufficient material to test AR were excluded. AR positivity was defined as ≥10% staining in tumor cells. TIL levels were graded 
semiquantitatively as absent, mild (<10%), moderate (10-50%) and severe (>50%). PD-L1 was considered positive if ≥1% of TILs showed 
staining. Associations between variables of interest were assessed via Fisher’s exact test. 
Results: 96 patients with pure DCIS were identified (mean age 56 years, range 39-85). Nuclear grade 3 was seen in 57%, grade 2 in 34%, 
and grade 1 in 8% of lesions. The large majority of lesions were AR+ (89/96, 93%). AR positivity was seen in 48/51 (94%) Luminal A 
lesions, 18/19 (95%) Luminal B lesions, 14/15 (93%) HER2-enriched lesions, and 4/6 (67%) basal-like lesions. Of interest, 23/96 lesions 
(24%) were ER-/AR+. No significant difference between AR+ vs AR- lesions was seen in either the level of TILs (40/83, 48%, vs 5/6, 83%, 
P = 0.11) or PD-L1 positivity by TILs (54% vs 50% P > 0.99). 
Conclusions: 1) AR was expressed in the majority of DCIS cases, comparable to that seen in invasive carcinoma. 2) Nearly one fourth of 
patients were AR+/ER-; this group could potentially be expected to benefit from anti-androgen therapy. 3) While we did not observe a 
significant effect of AR expression on either TIL levels or PD-L1 expression, more data are needed to definitively assess the impact of AR 
expression on the immune microenvironment in DCIS, particularly in HER2+ cases.

Background: Luminal-B breast cancers are characterized by worse prognosis and, more frequently carry TP53 mutations as compared to 
Luminal-A tumors. Aberrant p53 (ABp53) protein expression like a diffuse and strong nuclear expression, is predictive for 
pathogenic TP53 mutations. We studied the utility of p53 immunostaining in predicting the results of 3 commercially available multi gene 
signatures (MGS) frequently used to assess the risk of recurrence of Luminal early breast cancers.  
Design: This retrospective study included 179 primary operable ERPos/HER2Neg breast cancers diagnosed at University Hospitals Leuven 
between June 2013 and May 2019, that were analyzed either by MammaPrint®&BluePrint®(MP/BP; n=78), OncotypeDX® (ODX; n=44) or 
Prosigna/PAM50® (PAM50; n=57) MGS. Negative MP-index, RS score ≥26 and recurrence risk ≥11% were considered as high risk (HiR) 
categories in MP, ODX and PAM50, respectively. Intrinsic molecular breast cancer subtypes were provided by the combination MP/BP and 
the PAM50 assay. Whole-slide sections of the same paraffine block used for MGS testing were stained with anti-human p53 antibody 
(DAKO; clone DO-7). Patterns of ABp53 expression are shown in Figure 1. Statistics was by Fisher’s exact test 
Results: Twenty samples were excluded for insufficient residual tissue or poor-quality internal control (MP=9, ODX=4, PAM50=5). The 
remaining 159 showed an ABp53 pattern in 13% (n= 20) of the cases; with aberrant nuclear pattern in the majority (n=16). MGS HiR was 
observed in 34% (n=23/67), 28% (n=11/40) and 61% (n=32/52) of patients tested with MP, ODX and PAM50 respectively. Only MP HiR 
 
 
143 
showed a significant positive association with ABp53 (p<0,01). The BP/MP assay classified 44 (66%), 22 (33%) and 1 (1%) tumors 
respectively as luminal-A, B and Basal subtype. The PAM50 classified 32 (61%), 17 (33%), 1 (2%) and 2 (4%) tumors respectively as 
luminal-A, B, HER2 and Basal subtype. We found significant positive association between ABp53 and BP/MPLumB (p<0,01). No significant 
associations were found between ABp53 and ODX or PAM50 (Table 1)

Table1: Patterns of p53 expression in relation to risk categories and intrinsic molecular subtypes as assessed by commercially available 
multi gene signatures. The association between aberrant p53 and high-risk category was significant only in MP tested tumors (p<0,03 and 
for Prosigna and OncotypeDx respectively p=1 and p=0,660). In Prosigna tested tumors luminal-B subtype and non-luminal tumors were 
more frequently associated with high-risk category independent of p53 status. Aberrant p53 status was significantly associated with 
luminal-B subtype only in MammaPrint/BluePrint tested tumors. Due to the small number of cases the association between aberrant p53 
and non-luminal tumors was not assessed.  Abbreviations: MGS= multi gene signature; IHC= immunohistochemistry; mol. = molecular; 
RR= recurrence risk; RS= recurrence score; LA= luminal A; LB= luminal B; H2= HER2 enriched; BA= basal. No Normal-like tumors were 
found with Prosigna. 
Figure 1: Patterns of p53 expression by immunohistochemistry. A) wild type pattern was characterized by a variable p53 nuclear 
expression at various intensities; B) the aberrant-positive pattern was characterized by strong and intense nuclear staining in >95% of the 
tumor cells; C) the aberrant null pattern was characterized by complete lack of nuclear p53 expression in >95% of the tumor cells against a 
background of sparse positive stromal cells; D) aberrant cytoplasmic pattern was defined as cytoplasm expression in >95% of the tumor 
cells without clear nuclear expression.

Conclusions: Aberrant p53 staining patterns are significantly associated with MP high risk category and luminal-B BP/MP subtyping. 
Integration of p53 immunostaining in multiple pathologic parameters aiming at predicting MGS results warrants further study.

Background: Inherited mutations in the CDH1 gene increase the risk of developing hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) and lobular 
breast cancer (Lob Br CA).The lifetime risk of developing Lob Br CA in patients (pts) with CDH1 mutation is estimated at 39-52% but given 
the rarity of these mutations, Br lesions from this population have not been well characterized. In this study, we describe the 
clinicopathologic features of pts with CDH1 mutations. 
Design: All pts with deleterious CDH1 mutations and Br pathology, identified from an institutional registry, were included. Clinical and 
pathologic features were evaluated. 
Results: Nine pts with Br pathology were identified from a total of 41 pts known to have a deleterious CDH1 mutation. All pts were female, 
ages 34 to 61. None were of Ashkenazi descent, 6 (67%) were Caucasian, 2 (22%) were Asian, and 1 (11%) was of African descent. Eight 
(89%) pts came to medical attention due to Br masses and were subsequently diagnosed with Br CA that prompted multi-gene panel 
testing. The 9th pt underwent panel testing due to a strong family history (FH) of Br CA. Seven distinct CDH1 mutations are represented in 
these 9 pts (Table). None of the pts presented with gastrointestinal issues or prior gastric cancer (GC). Two (22%) had a FH of GC, while 7 
(78%) had a FH of Br CA. Five (56%) have subsequently undergone gastrectomy; 3 (33%) had pT1a GC of signet ring cell type and 
2 (22%) had negative gastrectomies. The remaining 4 (44%) have had only negative gastric biopsies. Eight (89%) had invasive Br 
CA diagnosed with morphologies including classic Lob (n=4), pleomorphic Lob (n=2), and ductal (n=2). One pt had only atypical 
Lob hyperplasia on Br biopsy. pT ranged from pT1b-pT2 with 4 pts being pN1a. All cancers were ER and PgR positive, with only one being 
HER2 positive. IHC for E-cadherin was negative in the classic Lob and pleomorphic Lob, while the ductal morphology was positive.

Conclusions: Although small, our study raises the possibility that some CDH1 mutations lead to Br CA as the initial and dominant clinical 
presentation. This is also reflected in the pts' FHs, where Br CA was more common than GC. While the majority of Br CA arising in pts 
with CDH1 mutations are of Lob phenotype, E-cadherin intact invasive ductal carcinoma was also seen, pointing out that Br lesions may 
also be true true and unrelated in this pt population. Moreover, these pts' germline mutations were identified on multi-gene panel testing, 
supporting the broadening use of these assays.

Background: Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors using PD-L1 targets on tumor cells (TC) and infiltrating immune cells (IC) offers 
potential new treatment strategies for triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). However, TNBC are a heterogeneous group of tumors 
with diverse histologic subtypes and varying IC in the tumor microenvironment.  Identifying the subset of TNBC that will most benefit from 
immune modulation will be required for appropriate patient selection. TNBC include infiltrating ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified 
(IDC-NOS), and special subtypes such as metaplastic carcinoma (MET), medullary carcinoma (MED), apocrine carcinoma (APC), and 
“salivary-like” carcinoma, among others.  In this study, we sought to evaluate the expression of PD-L1 in the TC and IC of the special 
TNBC histologic subtypes.  
Design: From 2017 to 2019, there were 103 patients with TNBC in our database, of which special histologic subtypes included 15 MET, 9 
MED, and 7 APC. Two pathologists evaluated one representative H&E stained slide for IC density and its corresponding PD-L1 (22C3) 
stained slide for PD-L1 expression in the TC and IC. Partial or complete circumferential membrane staining for PD-L1 of any intensity was 
scored as positive in the TC.  Fine punctate membrane or diffuse granular staining for PD-L1 was scored as positive in the IC.  IC density 
and PD-L1 staining of IC and TC were scored as follows: <1% (negative), 1-50% (low positive, LP), >50% (high positive, HP).   
Results: As expected, the MED had the highest IC density with all cases (9/9) scored as HP. All MET and APC were scored as LP for IC 
density.  For PD-L1 expression, all of the MED demonstrated positive staining of TC and IC, with PD-L1 expression localized primarily in 
the interface of the TC with the IC. The majority of the MET demonstrated PD-L1 staining of the TC (10/15) and IC (11/15), with most cases 
scored as LP. None of the APC (0/7) expressed PD-L1 in the TC or IC. 
Conclusions: Immune cell density varies considerably among the special histologic subtypes of TNBC. PD-L1 expression in the tumor 
cells and the immune cells also varies among the special histologic subtypes of TNBC. The apocrine carcinoma subtype of TNBC does not 
express PD-L1 in the tumor cells or the immune cells. This study underscores the importance of determining the histologic subtype of 
TNBC before the possibility of immunotherapy is entertained.

Background: Approximately 70% of breast carcinomas (BC) express estrogen receptor (ER). This is a critical attribute analyzed to 
determine usage of endocrine therapies for treatment of BCs. ER is encoded by ESR1, and genetic alterations, especially activating 
 
 
146 
mutations, in this gene are associated with resistance to endocrine therapies. Herein, we analyzed an institutional cohort of BCs 
harboring ESR1 genetic alterations (mutations and amplifications) and associated clinicopathologic characteristics. 
Design: The study included 223 BCs diagnosed between 2013 and 2018 that had undergone FoundationOne CDx testing. 
Clinicopathologic characteristics were collected and associations were analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. 
Results: Of the 223 cases of BC (136 ER+ and 87 ER-) analyzed, 13.9% (n=31) had ESR1 genetic alterations, including 26 mutations and 
5 amplifications. All 26 ESR1-mutated BCs were ER-positive and its prevalence in ER-positive BCs was 19.1% (26/136).  The prevalence 
of ESR1 mutations was significantly higher in metastatic ER+ BCs (23%, 23/100) than in primary ER+ BCs (8.3%, 3/36) (p=0.0275). Four 
cases were HER2 positive with 3 cases in the ESR1-amplified group and 1 in the ESR1-mutated group (60.0% vs 3.8%, p=0.0006). 
All mutations occurred in ESR1 ligand-binding domain, including Y537S (42.3%; n=11), D538G (38.5%; n=10), L536H (n=2), L536Q (n=2), 
Y537C (n=2), V534E (n=1) and Y537N (n=1). Three cases had double mutations (D538G/L536Q, D538G/Y537N, and D538G/Y537S). 
The most common gene mutations other than ESR1 in these 31 BCs 
included PIK3CA (35.5%), FGF3/4/19 (35.5%), FGFR1/3 (29%), ZNF703 (29%) and TP53 (25.8%), with no significant difference from BCs 
without ESR1 genetic alterations. However, p53 mutations occurred more frequently in ESR1-amplified BCs than in ESR1-mutated BCs 
(80% vs 15.4%, p=0.0025). All patients in this cohort received hormonal therapy (aromatase inhibitors and/or tamoxifen) except one ESR1-
amplified patient (ER-negative).

Conclusions: In this study, 19.1% of ER+ BCs showed ESR1 activating mutations, suggesting the necessity of developing specific drugs 
targeting these mutants. Our data also demonstrate ESR1 mutations occur more frequently in metastatic ER+ BCs than in primary ER+ 
BCs, and that there are clinicopathologic differences between ESR1-mutated and ESR1-amplified BCs.

Review from a Single Institution

Background: Histomorphologic and clinical evidence of skin involvement by breast carcinoma (BC) dramatically upstages patients to pT4b 
(skin ulceration and/or ipsilateral macroscopic satellite nodules) or cT4d (clinical findings of erythema and edema involving at least one-
third or more of the skin of the breast, inflammatory breast carcinoma). However, few studies extrapolate the significance of skin 
involvement and ulceration (SU) outside of the setting of inflammatory breast carcinoma (IBC). Khoury et al. suggest that SU may not be an 
adverse factor (Khoury, 2018); and, Güth et al. suggest pT4a-c categories “should be eliminated” altogether, and to classify tumors based 
on size (Güth, 2007). In the current study, we investigate the significance of skin involvement in BC based on tumor size and compare it 
with IBC. 
Design: Our institutional pathology database was searched for diagnoses of (1) “breast carcinoma” with (2) “skin” “ulceration”, “extension”, 
and “erosion”, and (3) the designation "pT4”. The cohort includes cT4d inflammatory breast carcinomas (IBC) and other pT4b BC that did 
not meet the criteria for IBC. A total of 59 cases met the search criteria (both biopsy and excision specimens), constituting 48 patients 
from 2001 to 2019. All cases that were pT4b were reclassified by tumor size into pT1c, pT2 or pT3. 
Results: Of the 48 patients, original pT classifications included 29 pT4b, 13 IBC, and 6 incompletely staged cases. Reclassifying the pT4b 
tumors into T1c (n=5), T2 (n=14), and T3 (n=11), did not yield any statistically significant associations (p < 0.05) with respect to (1) 
parameters such as lymphovascular invasion (LVI) or lymph node (LN) positivity, or (2) difference in overall survival between pT1c, pT2 
and pT3 with SU, originally denoted as pT4b. However, when comparing IBC versus pT4b, statistically significant associations were noted 
in the frequency of LVI (p=0.0195) and LN positivity with IBC (p=0.0358), Table 1. Length of follow up ranged from 4 to 133 months.

Conclusions: This series shows that patients with AJCC-defined pT4b BC did not have an association with LVI or LN positivity while IBC 
did have with both. Although our follow-up is limited by short duration for a subset of patients, if the observed trend for pT4b tumors to 
behave less aggressively is confirmed, consideration for a change in staging assignment may be warranted.

Background: Inhibitor of Differentiation (ID) proteins are a family of four (ID1-4) bHLH transcription factors that lack the DNA binding 
domain and act by negatively regulating transcription. Their action is essential for embryonic development, whereas later in the adulthood 
their expression is mostly restricted to a few populations of stem cells. In the last decades, many authors have described their role in the 
pathogenesis of different neoplasias. However, in breast cancer (BC) the pathogenic role and the clinical significance of ID genes are not 
fully elucidated. 
Design: We included 307 non-consecutive breast carcinomas (19.9% Luminal A, 19.2% Luminal B/HER2-, 15.6% Luminal B/HER2+, 
13.4% HER2-enriched and 31.9% TNBL), and 6 BC cell lines representative of all intrinsic subtypes (T47-D, MCF-7, BT-474, SKBR3, 
MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB-468). The mRNA expression of ID1-4 was analyzed by qRT-PCR using TaqMan® primers and probes. PUM1 
and β-actin were used as reference genes and a pool of healthy breast tissue or the non-tumor cell line 184A1 served as control samples. 
Relative changes in expression were calculated by the 2-ΔΔCT and the results were correlated with clinicopathological factors (age, tumor 
size and grade, vascular invasion, necrosis, immunophenotype, and lymph-node status) and patients’ outcome. Significant associations 
between variables were calculated with χ2 and Student-T test and differences in Kaplan-Meier survival plots were compared using the log-
rank test. 
Results: Overexpression of at least one ID gene was found in 50.5% of the samples. ID1 and ID4 were overexpressed mostly in TNBL and 
HER2-enriched subtypes, whereas overexpression of ID2 and ID3 was more frequently found in luminal tumors. High ID1 and ID4 
expression was associated with larger tumor size, histological grade 3, presence of necrosis and vascular invasion, and poorer patients’ 
outcome. In vitro studies showed high expression of the four ID genes in all cell lines, including the normal breast 184A1. However, the 
expression of ID4 was markedly higher in cancer cell lines than in 184A1. 
Conclusions: These data support that ID1 and ID4 may act as biomarkers of tumor aggressiveness and worse prognosis in patients with 
breast cancer. Therefore, they seem potential targets for the development of novel drugs.

Background: At our institution, most breast biopsy results are reported within a 24 hour turn-around time (TAT). However, in cases of 
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with suspected microinvasion (MI), examination of additional tissue levels and confirmatory stains for 
myoepithelial markers most often lead to extension of TAT. To this end, we proposed to investigate whether a well-trained deep learning 
based image classifier may aid as a diagnostic tool to distinguish DCIS from DCIS with MI on routinely stained H&E images. 
Design: 92 archival cases of DCIS and 17 cases diagnosed as DCIS with MI were identified. Whole slide imaging was performed on H&E 
stained slides using a NanoZoomer 2.0HT, at 40x magnification. A total of 561 images (458 DCIS, 104 DCIS with MI) measuring 154x154 
pixels were created and randomly divided into a 449 training image subset and a 112 testing image subset. The images were then used to 
create an image classification model using the ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architecture that would identify MI versus DCIS. 
Results: After model training, 112 images (91 DCIS, 21 DCIS with MI) were tested for correct classification. All 91 (100%) images of DCIS 
only were correctly identified, importantly with no false positives for an invasive component. MI was detected in 14 of 21 (66.7%) images, 
with an overall accuracy of 93.8%. The lack of MI detection in 7 images may be in part due to more limited training given the low image 
sample size of DCIS with MI compared to the sample training size of DCIS (104 vs 458). In addition, identifying MI is very challenging on 
routinely stained H&E slides, even with the help of myoepithelial markers. Therefore, the low image sample size combined with the very 
challenging diagnosis could explain the low detection rate of MI by the algorithm. 
Conclusions: Our results show there is potential for the use of a deep learning based decision support tool to assist in rapidly identifying 
DCIS with MI on routine H&E stained slides. In our cohort, detection of DCIS is highly accurate; with further model training, we also 
 
 
149 
anticipate an improvement in the accuracy of the image classifier for identification of MI. Significantly, no false positives for MI 
were recorded. Future development of the image classifier may ultimately reach sensitivity levels that will limit the number of cases in need 
of confirmatory stains for myoepithelial markers, leading to TAT improvement and decreased costs.

Disclosures: Iskender Genco: None; Deniz Gur: None; Sabina Hajiyeva: None 
Background: Breast lymphoma (BL) is a rare entity that represents 1-2% of breast malignancies while being the most common extra-
mammary cancer involving the breast. It occurs either as primary extranodal lymphoma or as secondary involvement by systemic disease. 
We aimed to report a single health care system experience in BL. 
Design: We conducted a review of primary and secondary BL seen at our health care system between 2010 and 2019. Clinical and 
pathological characteristics were assessed retrospectively. Primary lymphoma was defined as involvement of breast as the first clinical 
presentation with or without synchronous axillary lymph node involvement, and absence of systemic disease. Fifty-three BL from 47 
patients was identified and included in the study. 31 of 53 (58%) BL were categorized as primary and 22 (42%) of them were secondary. 
Results: The median age was 71 and 73 years for PBL and SBL. Two patients in each category were male. Nine of 31 (29%) patients with 
PBL and 6 of 22 (27%) patients with SBL had a history of breast cancer in either breast. Approximately two-thirds of PBL occurred in the 
right breast whereas SBL effected both breasts equally. Three patients in each category had bilateral breast involvement by lymphoma. 
Most common lymphoma was diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in PBL category and MALT lymphoma in SBL category (Table 1). 
One patient had synchronous primary anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and secondary follicular lymphoma (FL) in the same breast. 
Among 6 patients with bilateral BL, 3 patients (1 PBL, 2 SBL) had peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL, NOS), 1 patient (PBL) had DLBCL, 1 
had (PBL) chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) and 1 (SBL) had MALT lymphoma. Six (19%) patients with PBL and 1 (5%) with SBL had 
ipsilateral axillary lymph node involvement. One patient with primary CLL recurred after 8 years and 2 patients with secondary MALT 
lymphoma recurred after 3 and 7 years.

Conclusions: The most common PBL was DLBCL at our healthcare system; however, the frequency was lower than seen in the previous 
series. Overall the most common BL and SBL was MALT lymphoma. The significant number of patients (28%) had a history of breast 
cancer, and ipsilateral axillary LN involvement was observed mainly in patients with PBL in our series. Lastly, compare to the published 
literature, we report a higher frequency of male patients, PTCL (NOS) and MALT lymphoma, and lower frequency of DLBCL as well as FL.

Background: Local recurrence (LR) has been an important issue for patients with breast phyllodes tumors (PTs). More studies are needed 
to investigate whether different treatment strategies could be applied to different grades of PTs. In this study, the risk factors for recurrence 
of benign PT (BePT) and borderline PTs (BoPT) were analyzed. 
Design: Our pathology database was searched for breast surgical excision specimens with a diagnosis of BePT and BoPT from 2008 to 
2018. Patients with follow-up information at least 6 months after surgery were included in the study. Clinical features for all cases (112) 
were evaluated. Slide review was performed for 69 cases. Margin status was defined as; positive, ≤ 1 mm and negative. Cases were 
considered as “recurrence” when a new PT was identified in the same quadrant of ipsilateral breast. 
Results: A total of 171 cases (158 BePT, 13 BoPT) were surgically excised in our institution between 2008 and 2018. Of these, 112 cases 
(105 BePT, 7 BoPT) from 98 patients had follow-up information. 90 patients had one PT, 6 patients had 2 PTs, and 1 had 4 and 1 had 6 
PTs. The mean and median age of the patients was 39 and 49 years. Tumors ranged from 5 mm to 69 mm in size with a median size of 12 
mm. Surgical margin was positive in 67 (60%) cases, ≤ 1 mm in 21 (19%) cases and negative in 24 (21%) cases. 10 of 21 (48%) cases 
with ≤ 1 mm margin and 56 of 67 (84%) cases with positive margin were re-excised and had a final negative margin. The final margin 
status was positive in 11 (10%), ≤ 1 mm in 11 (10%) and negative in 90 (80%) cases (Table1). The median follow-up period was 30 
months, ranging from 6 months to 132 months. Three of 112 (2.7%) PTs recurred during follow-up. The time interval to recurrence was 7, 
42 and 62 months. All were BePT in original and recurrence site. None of BoPTs recurred during follow-up. There was no statistically 
significant difference in any clinical or histological features between patients with recurrence and no recurrence.

statistically significant. 
166 High EZH2 Expression in DCIS on Needle Core Biopsy is an Independent Predictive Factor for 
Upgrade on Surgical Excision

Disclosures: Iskender Genco: None; Buminhan Ozgultekin: None; Eugene Santagada: None; Sabina Hajiyeva: None 
Background: Approximately 25% of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) diagnosed on breast core biopsy is upgraded to invasive carcinoma 
on surgical excision. Risks factors to predict upgrade on excision are not well established which leads many patients to be over or under-
treated. Enhancer of zest homolog 2 (EZH2) was shown to be associated with aggressive behavior of cancer from many sites, including 
breast cancer. It was also described in relation to high-risk features in DCIS. We aimed to analyze EZH2 expression in DCIS as a predictor 
factor for an upgrade on excision. 
Design: Our pathology database was searched for DCIS diagnosed on core biopsy. We identified 23 patients who underwent subsequent 
surgical excision after the diagnosis of DCIS on core biopsy and were upgraded to invasive carcinoma on excision. For the majority of 
 
 
152 
patients with an upgrade, a control patient with biopsy-proven DCIS who did not show upgrade on excision was identified and matched 
based on nuclear grade and presence of necrosis. Immunohistochemical stain for EZH2 (11, Cell Marque) was performed on core biopsy 
specimens and its expression was compared with clinic-pathological features of the patients. EZH2 expression was evaluated in the nuclei 
of DCIS cells. As described in prior studies, a staining score (range 0-12) was obtained by multiplying the staining intensity (0 - no staining, 
1 - weak, 2 - moderate, 3 - strong) and proportion of positive cells (0 - < 1%, 1 – 1-25%, 2 - 25-50%, 3 - 50-75%, 4 - >75%). Nuclear EZH2 
expression was considered as ‘high expression’ if the score was ≥6. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to 
compare the variables in SPSS and p value <0.05 was considered as significant. 
Results: 25 of 45 (56%) DCIS showed high EZH2 nuclear expression. High EZH2 expression was significantly correlated with ER and PR 
negativity but not with the other clinico-pathological characteristics (Table 1). When we compared upgraded and non-upgraded cases by 
using univariate logistic regression analysis, ER and PR negativity, as well as high EZH2 expression were significantly correlated with an 
upgrade on excision. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed high EZH2 expression as the only independent predictor factor for 
an upgrade on excision.

are needed to explore the role of EZH2 expression in DCIS for diagnostic, treatment and prognostic purposes.

Background: Histologic grading is an important prognostic feature in breast carcinoma evaluation which has been incorporated into the 
8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual. For prognostic markers such as grade to be robust, there must be high reproducibility and 
low interobserver variability. We sought to evaluate interobserver variability amongst a multi-institutional group of academic breast 
pathologists using whole slide scanned images. 
Design: 150 consecutive invasive breast carcinomas were identified from a single participating institution. A representative slide was 
selected and scanned into a digital slide platform. The scanned slides were independently reviewed by 6 pathologists and assigned grades 
(1, 2, or 3) based on established criteria for tubule formation (TF), nuclear pleomorphism (NP), and mitotic count (MC). Fleiss’ k for overall 
agreement amongst all observers was calculated for overall grade and individual components. The most common grade (statistical mode) 
was taken as the gold standard, and interobserver concordance was evaluated based on this grade, as well as histopathologic type. 
Results: All patients were female with a mean age of 63 years (range; 29-98). 113 cases (75.3%) were invasive ductal (no special type), 
25 (16.7%) were invasive lobular, and 12 (8.0%) were other special types. Overall, interobserver agreement for grade was moderate 
(k=0.501), with the best agreement amongst grade 1 (k=0.694), followed by grade 3 (k=0.503), and only fair agreement for grade 2 
(k=0.375). Perfect agreement was observed in 46 cases. 4 cases demonstrated a two-step discrepancy, 3 of which also showed two-step 
discrepancy in mitotic rate. In 14 cases, there was an even split between pathologists in terms of grade. Excluding the 14 cases with an 
even split between grades, complete concordance amongst all pathologists was observed in 59%, 21%, and 38% of tumors with a modal 
grade 1, 2, and 3, respectively (p=0.006). Interobserver agreement was fair to moderate for the individual components (Table 1). 
Interobserver agreement was better for patients with invasive ductal (k=0.501) than invasive lobular carcinomas (k=0.104).

Conclusions: Pathologists have reasonable (but imperfect) agreement in grading breast carcinomas on digitally scanned slides, 
particularly those that are ductal in histology and/or at the extremes of grade.  How the residual variability affects stage and treatment 
decisions as well as the impact of evaluating mitotic rate on digitized images remains to be elucidated.

Background: Oncotype Dx recurrence score (ODX-RS) is used to predict recurrence in breast cancer, however, recent studies show that 
the modified Magee equations (MME) provides an equitable estimate of the actual ODX-RS in distinct cohorts. The aim of this study is to 
compare ODX-RS and the MME-RS using TAILORx cutoffs and to apply and assess the correlation of the recently proposed algorithmic 
approach to distinct cohort using MME-2. 
Design: All cases of newly diagnosed breast cancer were identified with available ODX RS and the MME-2 was calculated. Cases were 
stratified in distinct cohorts based on the recently described algorithmic approach with different combinations of MME-2 RS and ODX-RS to 
assess correlation and to find the cohort in which ODX testing can be safely omitted. 
Results: A total of 579 patients were identified in our cohort from 2012-2017. There was significant correlation between MME-2 and ODX-
RS (Pearson correlation coefficient=0.635 (p<0.0001)). The overall agreement between ODX and MME-2 using traditional cutoffs was 
 
 
154 
64.4% (373/579) with agreements of 71.4%, 52.2% and 84.2% for low, intermediate and high-risk categories, respectively (Table 1). Using 
TAILORx cutoffs, the overall agreement was 64.2% (372/579) with agreements of 28.9%, 66.4%, and 74.1% for low, intermediate and high-
risk categories, respectively (Table 1). When the patients were further stratified based on the known algorithm, the correlation between the 
cohort of MME-2 RS with cutoff 18 and ODX-RS<25 was 70.3% (407/579). In addition, using <25 as the ODX-RS cutoff and MME-2 RS<18 
there was a correlation of 96.1% (323/336) and when the cohort of MME-2 RS >30 compared with ODX-RS>25, the correlation was 89.5% 
(17/19). However, the correlation was 94.4% (238/252) when patients were further stratified based on mitotic score, MME-2 RS 18-25 and 
mitotic score of 1 and compared with ODX-RS<25.

Conclusions: There is a significant correlation between MME-2 and ODX-RS. The overall agreement between MME-2 and ODX-RS were 
similar for both TAILORx and traditional cutoffs. The highest correlation was identified between the cohort of MME-2 RS >30 compared 
with ODX-RS>25 (89.5%). However, when further stratified based on mitotic score, the cohort of MME-2 RS 18-25 with mitotic score of 1 
and ODX-RS<25 showed the highest correlation (94.4%). Further studies are required to confirm the clinical application of MME-2.

Background: Ductal carcinoma in situ, the most common type of pre-invasive lesion, is being detected with increasing frequency with the 
advent of mammographic screening. Race/ethnicity is an emerging factor in the risk of DCIS recurrence or progression to invasive breast 
 
 
155 
cancer (IBC). In particular, an increased risk of recurrence has been observed in Asian women with DCIS. The underlying biology and 
molecular markers that drive the recurrence of DCIS associated in Asian populations need to be elucidated. 
Design: Transcriptomic profiling (Human Clariom D Assay) was performed in de-identified 74 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cases 
obtained from the archives at Singapore General Hospital. Of the 67 cases that passed quality control, 39 cases were mastectomies (28 
ERpos; 11 ERneg; 19 recurrences). 16 ERpos cases recurred after mastectomy (MR) and 12 cases did not recur (MNR).  Similarly there 
were 3MR and 8MNR in the 11 ERneg cases. Clinical information on the samples included age at diagnosis, size (mm) of ductal 
carcinoma in situ and follow-up for recurrence. Principal component analysis (PCA), ANOVA, and pathway analysis were performed to 
identify genes and pathways associated with recurrences. 
Results: The PCA showed considerable degree of overlap in the MR versus MNR analysis, however the cases were better distinguished 
when ERpos and ERneg cases were separately analyzed. Comparison of MR versus MNR in ERpos and ERneg subgroups revealed 80 
genes were significantly altered in both groups, whereas 39 and 194 genes were unique to ERpos and ERneg, respectively  (P<0.05; -22). 
The DAVID Functional Annotation Clustering Analysis showed enrichment of ribosome, RNA binding and cell adhesion networks in 
recurrent (ERpos and ERneg) cases; additionally ERneg recurrent cases were also enriched of mitochondrial electron transport pathways. 
Conclusions: This study, to our knowledge, provides the first comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of pure DCIS cases with recurrence 
that characterizes the underlying biological networks in a cohort of Singapore Asian women being the majority from the Chinese ethnicity. 
As these patients had undergone mastectomy, the impact of other treatment parameters such as margin status, radiation did not impact 
our data providing a clearer picture of transcriptomic features associated with recurrence. Validation of these markers will determine their 
diagnostic and therapeutic utility.

Background: Although it has been two decades since the first HER2-targeted therapy became available, standardizing HER2 testing and 
defining HER2 amplification have been challenging. ASCO/CAP guidelines were revised in 2018 to create five algorithmic groups. While 
groups 1 and 5 represent unambiguous amplified and non-amplified cases, groups 2-4 require time consuming and costly additional testing 
and constitute >20% of all HER2 FISH testing in the reference lab setting.  ddPCR has many advantages over traditional FISH and IHC 
testing, including its highly quantitative, inexpensive, rapid, and far less labor-intensive methodology. It has been shown to be sensitive and 
specific for breast cancer HER2 testing and to have good concordance with traditional methods. We now evaluate HER2 ddPCR in group 
2-4 equivocal cases by 2018 guidelines compared to FISH/IHC and assess clinical outcome. 
Design: We designed a 2-well multi-amplitude ddPCR assay to test for amplification of three HER2 regions against three reference 
locations. FFPE breast tissue from non-neoplastic controls (N=16) determined the normal distribution of HER2/Reference ratios 
by ddPCR. Group 5 (N=10) and group 1 (N=20) cases by 2018 guidelines were used to determine sensitivity and specificity of the ddPCR 
assay. Using these defined cutoffs, 30 group 2-4 equivocal cases were tested by ddPCR.  Results were compared to FISH/IHC and 
response to HER2-targeted treatment. 
Results: HER2 ddPCR amplification sensitivity was 95% and specificity 90%, showing high concordance with FISH in groups 1 and 
5.  Equivocal groups 2-4 by FISH/IHC agreed with ddPCR in only 16/30 cases (53%) and 13 were reclassified to amplified by 
ddPCR.  Considering only the equivocal group 2-4 patients, 12 received treatment including HER2-targeted therapy with 11 clinical 
responses (mean follow-up 47 mon; SD 30 mon). Only 2 of the 11 (18%) responders would have qualified for HER2 therapy under 2018 
guidelines, whereas 8 (73%) would have qualified by ddPCR. 
Conclusions: In conclusion, ddPCR is a robust method for HER2 amplification in FFPE breast cancer. It reveals strong concordance with 
traditional FISH testing in unambiguous cases. Preliminary results for HER2 amplification by quantitative ddPCR in FISH/IHC equivocal 
cases show significant discordance (53%).  ddPCR compared to FISH/IHC yielded improved prediction of response (73% vs 18%) to 
treatment regimens that include HER2-targeted therapy.

Should be Considered in ASCO/CAP Guideline Revision

Background: It is recommended that estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor status be determined on all newly diagnosed breast 
cancers. ASCO/CAP guidelines control pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical variables to decrease erroneous results especially 
false negative testing. The upcoming revision emphasizes presence and staining of internal controls (IC) as another step in quality 
assurance. We have noticed that many hormone receptor negative cancers do not have an IC in diagnostic biopsies-when we needed it the 
most. The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a correlation between the hormone receptor status of tumor and likelihood of 
finding IC in the test tissue-which will be critical in assuring a negative test is valid. 
Design: All ER and PR tests on breast cancer submitted to our national reference laboratory between 1/2014-4/2019 were identified. Our 
lab reports intensity and percent staining for cancer and presence/absence of IC for ER and PR separately. Cases signed out by one 
attending who doesn’t report presence of IC when the carcinoma is hormone receptor positive were excluded. Age adjusted logistic 
regression was performed to determine factors associated with presence of IC. 
Results: 663 breast cancer samples were submitted for ER/PR testing in which the presence/absence of IC were recorded. 153 (23.1%) of 
the cancers were ER negative (<1%), 31 (4.7%) had 1-10% ER expression, 479 (72.2%) showed > 10% ER expression.  253 of the 
cancers (38.2%) were PR negative (<1%), 51 (7.7%) had 1-10% PR expression, 358 (54.1%) showed > 10% PR expression.  In one, no 
tumor was present in PR slide. 551 (82.3%) of the cases were ER and/or PR positive whereas 112 (17.7%) were negative for both ER and 
PR. We found about 50% decrease in probability of finding IC for ER and PR in hormone negative cancers (Table 1). Compared to high 
(≥90) hormone expressors, which is the majority of tumors, the likelihood of hormone receptor negative tumors having IC for ER and PR 
was significantly decreased (p<.001) (Table 1).

Conclusions: Presence of IC for ER/PR in the tested tissue is dependent on the tumor subtype, is 50% less likely in hormone negative 
cancers, and should be taken into consideration when revising ASCO/CAP guidelines.  Larger size of hormone negative tumors leaving no

normal epithelium and percolating nature of some hormone positive tumors with “trapped” normal ducts/acini may be contributing factors to 
this difference.

Background: GATA3 is an essential transcription factor which is linked to the ER signalling pathway in breast cancer. Genomic alterations 
(GAs) in GATA3 gene have recently been described in approximately 10% of breast tumors. The aim of this study was to identify breast 
tumors with GATA3 GAs and delineate clinicopathologic and molecular features of GATA3 mutated (GATA3mut) tumors. 
Design: Thirty six samples of advanced stage, treatment resistant breast carcinoma were assayed by hybrid capture-based 
comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) including 324 cancer-related genes and introns from 28 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. 
GAs were correlated with clinicopathologic data. IHC for GATA3 (clone L50-823, Biocare Medical) was performed in all GATA3mut cases. 
Results: Nine (25%) breast carcinomas featured GATA3 genomic alterations (Table). Six GATA3mut samples used for CGP were 
metastatic biopsies and 3 were primary breast tumors. The majority of GAs (7/9) were frameshift mutations, one case harbored a missense 
mutation, and another had a nonsense mutation. Three GATA3 mutations were in the second zinc finger (ZnFn2) domain, responsible for 
DNA binding, two mutations were between ZnFn1 and ZnFn2 domains, and the rest were towards the C-terminus. Interestingly, 
all GATA3mut cases were positive for GATA3 by IHC. All GATA3mut cases were ER+ and 2 of them (22%) were HER2+. Of the 
27 GATA3 wild type (GATA3WT) cases, 15 were ER+ and one of the 15 (6.6%) was HER2+. GATA3 GAs were present in 38% of all ER+ 
tumor cases (24 in total). The GATA3mut group had fewer GAs per tumor as compared to the GATA3WT ER+ group (6.1 versus 8.7). The 
most common GAs in both groups were PIK3CA, CCND1, FGF3, FGF4, and FGF19 with similar frequencies.  In contrast, TP53 mutations 
were disproportionally associated with GATA3WT ER+ group (53.3%) as opposed to 11.1% in GATA3mut group (p = 0.038). Similarly, 
33% of GATA3WT ER+ tumors featured MYC GAs, while no (0%) MYC GAs were present in GATA3mut group. In addition to potentially 
targetable PIK3CA GAs, rare targetable mutations were identified in ESR1 gene, with higher frequency in GATA3WT ER+ group.

Conclusions: GATA3 mutations are present in significant proportion of advanced breast cancer. All GATA3mut cases are ER+, and in 
some cases may be HER2+. The fact that all GATA3mut cases were immunolabelled by a commonly used GATA3 antibody argues against 
an IHC approach to exclude a GATA3mut. TP53 GAs are rare among the GATA3mut cases and GAs in GATA3 and MYC are mutually 
exclusive.

Background: MBC is an aggressive, usually triple negative (TN), histologic subtype. Previous study of PD-L1 in MBC scored tumor cells 
(TC), different from the current scoring method. In this study, we assessed PD-L1 expression in MBC using the FDA-approved SP142 
assay to evaluate the potential eligibility of MBC for recently FDA-approved anti-PD-L1 therapy. We also evaluated the concordance of two 
IHC assays.  
Design: Primary, treatment-naïve MBC treated at our Center from 1998-2019 were identified. Clinicopathologic features were reviewed. 
PD-L1 expression was assessed using SP142 (Ventana) and novel anti-PD-L1 mAb 73-10 (Abcam). PD-L1 scoring followed criteria in the 
IMpassion130 trial: PD-L1 expression on tumor infiltrating immune cells (IC) as a percentage of tumor area (<1% negative vs ≥1% 
positive). 
Results: A total of 44 MBCs were identified. Histologic subtypes included: 48% (21/44) matrix-producing (MP), 34% (15/44) spindle cell 
(SP) and 18% (8/44) squamous cell (SCC). The majority (81%) were TN (Table 1). Using SP142, PD-L1 IC positivity was seen in 91% 
(40/44) MBCs, with similar rates in MBCs with MP (90%, 19/21), SP (87%, 13/15), and SCC (100%, 8/8). We also observed PD-L1 
expression ≥1% in TC in 23% (10/44) MBCs: 19% (4/21) MP, 30% (5/15) SP, and 13% (1/8) SCC. Using 73-10, 93% (41/44) MBC IC were 
positive. The 73-10 assay showed more positivity in TC than SP142 (43% vs 23%, p=0.67). The overall concordance for IC scoring 
between the assays was 93%. Discrepant scoring on IC was seen in 7% (3/44) of cases: 2 negative with SP142 were positive with 73-10, 
and 1 positive with SP142 was negative with 73-10. Discrepant scoring on TC was seen in 20% (9/44) of cases: 9 negative by SP142 were 
positive with 73-10. The SP142 assay showed a distinct difference in staining between IC (granular, dot-like) and TC (membranous) while, 
73-10 showed membranous +/- cytoplasmic staining in both IC and TC.

Conclusions: The majority of MBC in our cohort were positive for PD-L1 (≥1% IC staining) with both assays (91% vs 93%). This suggests 
that anti-PD-L1 therapy could be advantageous in MBC. TCs displayed more positive staining on the 73-10 assay. No criteria exist for TC 
staining and the significance of TC staining in breast cancer has not been fully elucidated. Despite good concordance, the staining patterns 
were less distinctive using the 73-10 assay. Further study on correlation of PD-L1 positivity with the mutational profiles and clinical 
outcomes of this aggressive breast cancer subtype is ongoing.

174 Morphologic and Immunohistochemical (IHC) Features of Carcinoma Involving Microglandular 
Adenosis (MGA) of the Breast Following Neoadjuvant Therapy (NAT)

1Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 2Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Weill Cornell Medical College, 
New York, NY 
Disclosures: Anne Grabenstetter: None; Timothy D'Alfonso: None; Hannah Wen: None; Edi Brogi: None; Lee Tan: None 
Background: MGA is a benign breast lesion with infiltrative growth that lacks a myoepithelial cell layer. MGA can exhibit atypia (AMGA) or 
be involved by carcinoma (CMGA). Since CMGA does not express hormone receptors or HER2 it can be misdiagnosed as invasive triple 
negative breast cancer (TNBC) on core needle biopsy (CNB) and thus would be more likely to be selected for treatment with NAT. This 
study examines the morphologic and IHC features of CMGA following NAT. 
Design: Post-NAT excisions (EXC) showing AMGA and/or CMGA were identified following a search of our pathology database. Only cases 
with slides of both the EXC and corresponding CNB available for review were included. Clinicopathologic features and all available slides 
were reviewed.  
Results: Eleven cases from 11 women were identified which met the above criteria. The pathologic features of the cohort are summarized 
in Table 1. All 11 CNBs were initially diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC); MGA was originally identified in 1 CNB. On 
morphologic review, 8 CNBs were confirmed to contain AMGA/CMGA, 2 had no evidence of and 1 showed no definite AMGA/CMGA. 
Definite IDC could not be confirmed in 4 CNBs. At EXC, all 11 cases showed AMGA/CMGA. The 4 cases with no IDC on CNB showed no 
IDC at EXC and all had persistent AMGA/CMGA. No residual IDC was present in 4 of 7 CNBs with IDC; residual AMGA/CMGA was 
identified in all 7 EXC. Where IHC was performed on CNB and/or EXC, AMGA/CMGA were positive for S-100, laminin and collagen IV and 
were negative for calponin and p63. Areas of IDC did not stain with laminin and collagen IV. Following NAT, AMGA/CMGA acquired 
morphologic alterations that included nuclear pleomorphism, prominent eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules, reduced size of glands, and 6 
EXC showed areas of single cell growth pattern which still demonstrated typical staining of MGA (Figure 1).

Conclusions: This study is the first to examine the effects of NAT on CMGA. Our data showed no response of the CMGA after NAT in 
contrast to the high response rate of conventional TNBC to NAT. Notably, the infiltrative single cell pattern of residual CMGA could be 
misdiagnosed for residual IDC. The persistence of CMGA following NAT supports the theory that CMGA is not equivalent to TNBC despite 
its lack of myoepithelial cells. Our findings also highlighted the challenges in recognizing CMGA in CNBs, and its triple negative phenotype 
may lead to unwarranted treatment with NAT in the absence of conventional TNBC.

Background: Hormone receptor ( ER and PR) and HER-2 status of breast carcinoma forms the cornerstone for the management of breast 
carcinoma as it has both prognostic and therapeutic implications in patient care both in the adjuvant and metastatic setting. 
In our institution we currently routinely perform concurrent testing for ER, PgR and HER-2 on every newly diagnosed pre-adjuvant primary 
breast cancer and the synchronous axillary lymph node metastases as many studies have shown the hormone receptor and HER-2 status 
may change throughout tumour progression from the primary tumour to the synchronous axillary metastases. 
The aim of our study was to compare the hormone receptor profiles and HER-2 status of primary invasive breast carcinoma in the breast 
core biopsy with the concurrent metastases within ipsilateral axillary lymph node core biopsy. If we can demonstrate high concordance; this 
would justify performing the immunohistochemistry (IHC) on the breast core biopsy only thus reducing the cost for the patient as well as the 
laboratory. 
Design: We had a total of 1140 cases of invasive breast carcinoma diagnosed in our institution with concurrent ipsilateral axillary lymph 
node metastases over a period of 4 years (2015-2018). ER and PR were scored using the recommended ASCO/CAP guidelines from 2010 
and HER-2 from 2013. For all HER-2 cases if the result was equivocal on either specimen the HER-2 FISH result was taken for final 
comparison.

Conclusions: The results of the study revealed that there was very good concordance between the results of hormone receptor and HER-
2 status performed on the breast core biopsy and the synchronous ipsilateral axillary lymph node metastases. This high concordance rates 
differs from other studies in the literature where the concordance rates, ranged from 80 -85% for ER, 70 – 85% for PR1,3,4,5 In contrast most 
studies have demonstrated a high HER-2 concordance rates3 of more than 90%. Our results compare well with the study by Zhao S et 
all 2 with good concordance between the breast core biopsy and axillary lymph node biopsy. 
Based on these observations it may be justified not to repeat the hormone receptors and HER-2 stains on the primary beast core and 
axillary lymph node metastases. This would amount to cost savings both for the patients who in many institutions pay IHC performed per b

Background: Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a transcriptional downstream regulatory target in the Hippo signaling pathway. This pathway 
plays an important role in tumor suppression by restricting proliferation and promoting apoptosis. Activation of YAP results in its 
translocation to the nucleus thereby promoting a carcinogenic effect. The role of YAP, in breast cancer has been very controversial. The 
present study aimed to investigate the expression of YAP in different molecular subtypes of breast cancer and its association with 
expression of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in the tumors. 
Design: YAP mRNA and protein expression was characterized in 23 cases of breast carcinomas and 5 normal breast tissue, using RT-
PCR and immunohistochemistry. The study also investigated the expression of stem cell markers (SOX-2, NANOG and OCT4). YAP 
expression was characterized in breast cancer cell lines and the growth and viability of MCF-7 breast cancer cells was studied using MTT 
assay with and without the YAP inhibitor Verteporfin. 
Results: In this study, we report that YAP mRNA expression is significantly higher in breast cancer tissue compared to normal 
(P=0.040).  A statistically significant difference in YAP expression was also found between Luminal B and TNBC (P=0.029). mRNA 
expression levels of OCT4 and NANOG were significantly increased in breast cancer. Both OCT4 and NANOG expression showed a 
significant positive association with YAP expression (P= 0.030 and P=0.035) and were also associated with a higher ki-67 (P= 0.010) and 
with lymphovascular invasion (P= 0.005). On the other hand, the mRNA and protein expression of YAP did not show any statistically 
significant difference between the two cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231). Similarly, YAP expression did not show positive association with 
tumor grade, stage, Ki-67 expression, perinodal fat or lympho-vascular invasion nor with patient outcome as shown by the response to 
treatment after 5 years of follow up. An MTT viability assay showed that Verteporfin at 2 different concentrations sensitized MCF7 cells to 
tamoxifen at low doses. 
Conclusions: The significant association found between YAP and stem cell markers points to a possible oncogenic role of YAP in breast 
cancer. This role is particularly important in luminal tumors where YAP showed a significantly higher expression than TNBC tumors. 
However, this link between YAP and stemness needs further elucidation of the underlying mechanistic pathways in order to identify 
possible new therapeutic targets.

Background: Nonlinear microscopy (NLM) is an emerging imaging technique that generates images similar to hematoxylin and eosin 
(H&E) from freshly excised tissue. NLM has been used to examine breast carcinoma (Cahill et al. 2018). However, the ability of NLM to 
characterize benign breast lesions has not been fully demonstrated. 
 
 
165 
Design: Sections of freshly excised, unsectioned breast tissue were stained with fluorescent nuclear (acridine orange) and 
stromal/cytoplasmic (sulforhodamine) dyes for 2 minutes, rinsed with saline for ~30 seconds, placed onto a specimen holder with a glass 
window, and then evaluated in real-time using a custom-designed NLM instrument at magnifications ranging from 5X to 20X, analogous to 
standard light microscope. The real-time evaluation was recorded and subsequently compared with standard paraffin-embedded H&E 
histology. 
Results: We evaluated 81 breast specimens to characterize benign breast tissue types. Normal ducts and lobules with two distinctive cell 
types were identified in all cases. Distinctive eosinophilic cytoplasm, round nuclei, and prominent nucleoli, consistent with apocrine 
metaplasia were visualized. An intraductal proliferation of haphazardly oriented cells was seen in usual ductal hyperplasia. Multinucleated 
giant cells were identified at biopsy sites. Well-circumscribed fibroepithelial lesions including fibroadenoma and phyllodes tumor were 
distinguished. Cystic spaces lined by single or multiple columnar cells with elongated nuclei were identified corresponding to columnar cell 
changes/columnar cell hyperplasia. Papillary fronds projections were seen in intraductal papillomas. Entrapped glands with usual ductal 
hyperplasia moving away from a central nidus were seen in the radial scar. Slit-like spaces lined by stromal myofibroblasts consistent with 
pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia were identified. The cytological and architectural features of benign breast lesions visualized by 
NLM were confirmed when compared to the respective H&E slides. Examples of NLM images and corresponding H&E slides are shown in 
the Figure 1. 
Figure 1 - 177 
 
Conclusions: NLM facilitates the rapid histological evaluation of freshly excised tissue and visualization of histological features necessary 
to characterize benign breast lesions without introducing processing artifacts.

Background: Nonlinear microscopy (NLM) is a laser-based imaging technique that allows real time evaluation of freshly excised tissue. 
NLM produces images similar to formalin fixed, paraffin embedded H&E histology, but without the need for freezing, fixation, embedding or 
slide preparation. In a prior study, we demonstrated high sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (93.3%) for detecting breast carcinoma from 
benign breast tissue (Tao et al. 2014). However, the ability of NLM to further characterize invasive carcinoma subtypes has not been 
adequately examined. Here we aim to demonstrate the ability of NLM to assess histologic details of invasive breast cancer subtypes.  
Design: Freshly excised breast tissue was serially sliced, and representative slices of tumors were selected for evaluation. The tissue was 
stained with fluorescent nuclear (acridine orange) and stromal/cytoplasmic (sulforhodamine) dyes for 2 minutes, followed by a ~30-second 
saline rinse. Tissue slices were evaluated in real-time using a custom-designed NLM instrument at magnifications ranging from 5X to 20X. 
NLM generates images by scanning a femtosecond laser that excites the nuclear/cytoplasmic fluorescent dyes only at the laser focus. This 
produces an optical sectioning effect that visualizes a thin tissue layer within a thick specimen without requiring physical sectioning with a 
microtome. The NLM images were displayed in an H&E-like colormap using fluorescent signals from the nuclear and cytoplasmic channels, 
minimizing the training required to evaluate them. The real-time evaluation was recorded and subsequently compared with standard H&E. 
Results: We evaluated 20 partial mastectomy specimens with known invasive carcinoma on biopsy to further characterize the histologic 
subtypes of invasive carcinoma. Histological features of invasive ductal carcinoma, ranging from well-formed glands to solid sheets of cells 
without glands formation were identified. Single cells invading the stroma were visualized on invasive lobular carcinoma. Clusters of cells 
within pools of extracellular mucin was identified on mucinous carcinoma. Cytological features including nuclear pleomorphism and nuclear 
atypia were identified. The ability of NLM to visualize cytological and architectural features of invasive carcinoma of the breast was 
confirmed when compared to respective H&E slides (Figure 1).  
Figure 1 - 178 
 
Conclusions: NLM enables rapid assessment of breast tissue for the presence of invasive carcinoma and identification of histologic 
subtypes.

Background: The number of transgender (TG) individuals pursuing testosterone therapy (TT) to enhance masculinization is increasing. 
Although TT is generally considered safe, the impact of long-term, high-dose testosterone (T) on breast biology remains unclear. While 
previous studies provided insight into the complex interplay of exogenous T and endogenous female hormones in the breast, they were 
descriptive and did not evaluate the association of histologic features with duration of TT. This study aims to identify histologic features 
associated with long-term TT. 
Design: We reviewed H&E slides from 318 TG individuals who underwent chest-contouring surgery at our institution (January 2013-
December 2018) for various histologic findings including degree of lobular atrophy as well as atypical and non-atypical proliferations. 
Patient data were retrieved from medical records. Information about the duration of TT was available for 298 cases. Thus, the association 
between histologic features and length of TT was only assessed in 298 cases using non-parametric tests. 
Results:  The mean duration of TT was 22.8 months among 249 (84%) TG individuals taking T; 49 (16%) did not use T prior to surgery. 
Longer TT was associated with increasing degrees of lobular atrophy— median durations of TT were 10.0 months for the minimal category, 
14.5 for mild, 15.3 for moderate, and 24.8 for marked (p<0.001). Duration of TT in cases without fibroadenomatous change, cysts, 
secretory change, or pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia were significantly longer by 6.5%, 17.2%, 87.9%, and 48.5% months, 
respectively, compared to cases with these features (p<0.05). Five out of 318 cases (1.6%) had atypical hyperplasia (atypical ductal 
hyperplasia [ADH] in 2, atypical lobular hyperplasia [ALH] in 2, and both ADH and ALH in 1). The duration of TT in 3 of these individuals 
was 12.1, 25.6, and 64.1 months (TT duration was unavailable for the other 2); 2/5 have a family history of breast cancer and none of these 
patients had genetic testing conducted. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) was identified in 1 individual who was on TT for 61.4 months. 
Although this patient has a family history of male breast cancers, no germline mutation was identified upon genetic testing. 
Conclusions: TT modulates hormone-related breast histopathologic features. The finding of DCIS warrants the establishment of culturally 
sensitive breast cancer screening protocols for TG individuals, especially for those not undergoing chest-contouring surgery.

Background: Brain metastasis from breast carcinoma is increasing.  There is need to evaluate tumor prognostic markers, histological 
subtypes, and clinical outcome to better understand this dismal complication. Recently, SOX10 expression has been reported positive in 
both benign breast myoepithelial cells and primary breast carcinomas (PBC), especially basal-like, triple-negative breast carcinoma 
(TNBC). However, there is limited literature on the utility of SOX10 expression in brain metastatic breast carcinomas (BMBC).  
Design: In this study, we evaluated SOX10 expression in surgically resected BMBC and PBC from 121 specimens of 76 patients sampled 
on tissue microarrays. There were a total 99 specimens from brain metastases including 83 BMBC and 16 from other sites.  
Results: SOX10 expression was seen in 10/99 (10.1%) cases of all metastatic breast carcinomas, all were grade II/III, TNBC, metastatic to 
the brain (n=7) or skin (n=3) (Table 1). Overall, 10/39 (25.6%) of TNBC metastases were SOX10+, compared to 0% of estrogen receptor 
(ER)+ or human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER-2)+ metastases (P<.001). In patients with matched PBC and BMBC tissue (n=22), SOX10 
expression was present in 13.6% (3/22) of all evaluated PBC and seen only in TNBC subgroup (fig 1). The time to BMBC was shorter with 
SOX10+ tumors (Log rank, P<0.014). Overall survival after BM was shorter in patients with Sox10+ tumors(fig 2).

Background: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive form of breast cancer (BC) characterized by breast erythema and edema 
secondary to tumor emboli within skin lymphatics. Due to the rarity of IBC and challenges in its diagnosis, much remains to be determined 
regarding its molecular pathogenesis. We investigated the genomic profile of tumors from IBC patients (pts) seen at the IBC Program at 
DFCI.  
Design: Pts who consented to NGS-based tumor profiling (OncoPanel,OP) from 2013-2019 were identified from an IRB approved IBC 
registry. OP v1-v3.1 interrogated full coding sequences of 275-447 genes for mutations (muts) and copy number variations. Alterations 
common to all OP versions were compared between subgroups using Fisher's exact test (p<0.05) with FDR adjustment (q<0.25). Cox 
proportional-hazards models controlling for BC subtype were employed for overall survival (OS) analysis. 
Results: 101 IBC pts had OP performed on a single tumor sample. Samples tested were primary (57) or metastatic (44) and HR+/HER2- 
(34), HER2+ (35) or triple negative (TN) (31). IBC tumors harbored several recurrent muts (see Figure 1) including likely oncogenic muts 
in TP53 (53%), PIK3CA (20%), GATA3 (6%), PTEN (5%), ARID1A (4%), RB1 (4%), CDH1 (3%), MAP2K4 (3%), MAP3K1 (3%), ATM (2%),
 CREBBP (2%), ESR1 (2%) and NF1 (2%). Recurrent gene amplifications (amps) 
involved ERBB2 (33%), CCND1 (12%), FGFR1 (6%), MYC (6%), RARA (5%), RAD21 (4%) and NOTCH2 (3%). HER2+ and TN tumors 
were enriched for TP53 muts compared to HR+/HER2- (71.4% and 61.3% vs 29.4%;p=0.001,q=0.067). Tumors from pts who had 
secondary IBC in an ipsilateral breast previously treated for BC were enriched for PIK3CA muts (57% vs 22%;p=0.01) and those from pts 
who were stage IV at presentation were enriched for ERBB2 amp (48% vs 19%;p=0.003), although findings lost significance after FDR 
correction. No other significant correlations were found between mutation burden or alterations and clinicopathologic features such as age, 
menopausal status, sample type tested, tumor histology, LVI or site of metastasis. ERBB2 amp was the only alteration associated with 
longer OS, while FBXW7 mut was associated with shorter OS.  
Figure 1 - 181

Conclusions: IBC features a diverse repertoire of genomic alterations that overlaps with those previously implicated in BC with a high 
frequency of TP53 muts suggesting a more aggressive biologic phenotype. Future analysis will compare IBC and non-IBC tumors profiled 
at our institution to further investigate a potential IBC-specific phenotype.

Background: Oncotype DX is a 21 gene RT-PCR based assay commonly used for prognosis and predicting the benefit of chemotherapy 
treatments in ER+, HER2- breast cancer with either node negative or 1-3 node-positive (LN+ 1-3) disease. The purpose of this study 
focuses on investigating the trend of IHC4 (ER, PR, HER2 and Ki-67) profile in Oncotype low risk (RS 1-10) and intermediate risk (RS 11-
25) groups and if the IHC4 profile can help predict an Oncotype RS of 10 or less. 
Design: 654 newly diagnosed breast cancers were retrieved from the 2018 tumor archives. 54 of them were sent for Oncotype and 51 
cases had sufficient tumor for analysis. The 51 cases were divided into clinical low (c-low: grade 1 ≤ 3 cm, grade 2 ≤ 2 cm, grade 3 ≤ 1 cm, 
grade 1 ≤ 2 cm with LN+ 1-3) and clinical high risk (c-high: grade 1 > 3 cm, grade 2 > 2 cm, grade 3 > 1 cm, grade 1 > 2 cm with LN+ 1-3 
and grade 2-3 with LN+ 1-3) groups. The results of immunohistochemical testing of ER, PR, HER2 and Ki-67 and Oncotype recurrence 
score were recorded for each case. 
Results: Among 51 cases, 25 cases had low risk RS (1-10), 23 cases had intermediate RS (11-25) and 3 cases had high risk RS (26-100). 
19 (76%) low risk RS cases are c-low with 18 (95%) cases showing ER ≥ 90%, HER2- and Ki-67 ≤ 14%. 6 (24%) low risk RS cases are c-
high with 4 (67%) cases showing ER ≥ 90%, HER2- and Ki-67 ≤ 14%. 18 (78%) intermediate risk cases are c-low with 11 (61%) cases 
showing ER ≥ 90%, HER2- and Ki-67 ≤ 14%. 5 (22%) intermediate risk cases are c-high with 3 (60%) cases showing ER ≥ 90%, HER2- 
and Ki-67 ≤ 14%. None of the high risk RS cases are c-low in this study or show a combination IHC profile of ER ≥ 90%, HER2- and Ki-67 
≤ 14%.

Conclusions: 96% of breast carcinomas with Oncotype RS ≤10 in this study have either low or intermediate histologic grade, size ≤ 2 cm 
with IHC profile of ER ≥ 90%, HER2- and Ki-67 ≤ 14%. While the same IHC profile is also observed in 61% of c-low cases in Oncotype 
RS11-25 group, the TAILORx trial published in August, 2018 concluded that no statistically significant benefit was found in patients with 
intermediate RS treated with chemotherapy although some benefit of chemotherapy was found in women 50 years or younger. 
Based on our small study and the TAILORx conclusion, females above age 50 with grade 1-2, T1 N0 breast carcinomas with ER ≥ 90%, 
HER2- and Ki-67 ≤ 14% may possibly avoid costly molecular studies as Oncotype RS results may not change the overall management.

Background: The 2018 ASCO/CAP HER2 guidelines eliminate the equivocal category for in situ hybridization (ISH) and emphasize 
concurrent interpretation of immunohistochemistry (IHC) with ISH. Evaluation of HER2 IHC using sections from the same sample used for 
ISH is recommended to guide the selection of areas for ISH scoring. The utility of IHC intensity for selecting areas for ISH scoring was 
evaluated in a series of IHC equivocal (2+) breast cancers. 
Design: A total of 86 cases with equivocal HER2 IHC (2+) that were reflexed to FISH were prospectively collected from 8/22/2018 to 
6/26/2019. Tumor grade, histology, hormone receptor status and variability in HER2 IHC staining intensity were recorded. The areas of 
most and least intense HER2 IHC staining were separately identified and scored by FISH. The mean HER2:CEP17 ratio and mean HER2 
signals:tumor cell were calculated for both populations and statistical significance was evaluated using the Wilcoxon Ranked Sum test. 
Results: The distribution of the high and low intensity groups is reported in Table 1. Overall, 83 of 86 (95.5%) cases sorted into the same 
ISH group, 7 (9.3%) sorted into different ISH groups and 3 (3.5%) had different final ISH categorizations in the high and low intensity areas. 
These 3 cases were ISH Group 1 (amplified) in the high intensity area and ISH group 2, 4 or 5 (not amplified in the absence of 3+ IHC) in 
the low intensity area. The other 4 cases with different ISH groups did not have different final HER2 categorizations. While most cases 
(88%) showed some degree of variability in HER2 stain intensity, all 3 discordant cases showed significant variability in the HER2 staining 
intensity. The mean HER2:CEP17 ratios for the high and low intensity areas were 1.48 and 1.37 (p=0.017) with no statistically significant 
difference in HER2 copy number (p=0.65).

Conclusions: When areas with high and low HER2 IHC intensity were compared, there was a small difference in the mean HER2:CEP17 
ratio and a minority of cases (3.5%) showed discordant final HER2 categorization.  However, the discordant cases account for 33% of the 
amplified cases. Cases with discordant HER2 categorization showed readily identifiable high and low intensity areas and were amplified in 
the IHC high intensity area and not amplified in the low intensity area. The data suggests that using HER2 IHC to guide selection of areas 
for ISH testing may identify amplified tumors (or clones) in a minority of cases.

Background: The PD-L1 (SP142) immunohistochemical assay (Ventana, Tucson, AZ) has been recently approved by the FDA as a 
companion diagnostic assay to determine eligibility of patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) for 
immunotherapy with atezolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1. Thus, treatment selection rests on reliable assay interpretation; 
however, studies on interobserver variability among pathologists with the PD-L1 (SP142) assay remain limited. The objective of this study 
is to determine the interobserver variability in PD-L1 (SP142) immunohistochemistry (IHC) interpretation in breast carcinoma. 
Design: The institutional database of a single large, academic cancer center was interrogated for all patients diagnosed with primary or 
metastatic breast cancer cases on which PD-L1 SP142 IHC was performed from 2018 to 2019. 79 of 127 retrieved cases (62%) were 
randomly selected for evaluation. Assessment of PD-L1 IHC in stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was evaluated on whole slide 
images by 8 staff pathologists with breast pathology expertise (Figure 1). PD-L1 was scored according to the criteria in the Impassion 130 
 
 
174 
trial, as negative, where staining of TILs occupies <1% of the tumor area, or positive, where staining of TILs occupies 1% or greater of the 
tumor area. Interobserver variability was calculated using unweighted kappa, whereby a value of 0.01-0.20 indicated slight agreement, 
0.21-0.40 fair agreement, 0.41-0.60 moderate agreement, 0.61-0.80 substantial agreement, and 0.81-0.99 near-perfect agreement. 
Results: PD-L1 IHC was performed on 79 breast cancer cases. Clinical and pathologic features of the study cohort are summarized in 
Table 1. The kappa score for interobserver agreement was 0.727. There was complete agreement among all 8 pathologists in 49 cases 
(62%), among at least 7 pathologists in 66 cases (84%) and among at least 6 pathologists in 73 cases (92%). In 3 cases (4%), 
pathologists’ scores were divided equally, with half of the participants scoring the case as positive and negative (Figure 2; arrowheads 
indicate areas of PD-L1 staining). These discrepant cases included 2 core needle biopsies [one primary (Figure 2A-B), one metastasis to 
liver (Figure 2C-D)] and 1 excision [metastasis to cecum (Figure 2E-F)].

Background: Accurate HER2 status assessment is integral to patients with breast carcinoma (BC). ASCO/CAP updated the testing 
guideline in 2018 to address issues from uncommon HER2 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results. This study evaluates BCs with 
equivocal HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) results (2+,1+ to 2+) with HER2 FISH and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to 
assess ERBB2 amplification status, focusing on Group 4 (HER2/CEP17 Ratio<2.0;Average HER2 Signals/cell >=4.0 and <6.0). 
Design: BCs with equivocal HER2 IHC results from 2009-2019 were retrieved from a single institution's database. Cases were included if 
HER2 FISH and NGS by a hybridization capture-based assay (targeting up to 468 genes, previously validated for ERBB2 amplification 
calls) were performed on the same sample. Clinical, pathologic, HER2 FISH and NGS data were reviewed. Cases were reclassified into 
2018 ASCO/CAP ISH groups, and all Groups 2, 3 and 4 BCs were included. Groups 1 and 5 BCs were selected from the prior validation 
group. NGS results of ISH Groups 2, 3 and 4 BCs were compared to those of Groups 1 and 5. Following criteria was used to determine 
significance of whole-gene gain events by NGS: fold change (FC) >=2.0 (amplification), FC >=1.5 but <2 (copy number gain/borderline 
amplification) with P<.05. Copy number gains were interpreted with overall copy number profile and tumor purity. 
Results: 86 BCs were reviewed, including 11 Group 1 cases (13%), 4 Group 2 (4%), 6 Group 3 (7%), 29 Group 4 (34%) and 36 Group 5 
(42%). Clinical, pathologic and molecular findings are shown in Table 1. Comparison of FISH and NGS ERBB2 amplification calls is shown 
in Fig.1. HER2 FISH and NGS showed complete concordance in Groups 1 and 5. Groups 2 and 3 show varied NGS results but limited by 
case numbers. Group 4 had 97% concordance with HER2 FISH and NGS ERBB2 results. 1 case in Group 4 (HER2/CEP17 
ratio:1.6; HER2 signals/cell:5.2) showed amplification by NGS (FC:1.98, P=.001); FISH testing on an alternate sample of this cases 
revealed amplification (HER2/CEP17 ratio:2.4;HER2 signals/cell:5.3). NGS showed no significant differences in genetic mutations 
in Groups 4 and 5 cases (Fig.2). Despite most Group 4 patients (n=21;72%) not receiving HER2-targeted therapy, 86% were alive at 
follow-up.

Background: Following approval of atezolizumab for patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with 
PD-L1-positive immune cells, PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessment with SP142 assay has been widely implemented. 
The Ventana SP142 assay is the FDA-approved companion diagnostic for atezolizumab therapy selection. We aim to elucidate clinical, 
pathologic and molecular findings associated with PD-L1 expression in breast cancer (BC). 
Design: We validated PD-L1 SP142 assay at our center in 11/2018 and assess PD-L1 expression in primary, recurrent or metastatic BCs 
as requested by treating physicians. We identified BCs with SP142 IHC performed between 11/2018-7/2019. Clinical and pathologic data 
and available molecular results were reviewed. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were evaluated per International TILs Working Group 
recommendations. PD-L1 scoring followed the IMpassion 130 trial criteria, with >=1% considered positive. 
Results: 128 BC samples (121 patients) were evaluated with PD-L1 SP142, including 81 TNBCs, 3 ER-/HER2+ and 34 ER+/HER2- cases. 
Overall 32% were PD-L1 positive. PD-L1 positivity was seen more frequently in TNBCs than non-TNBCs but was not statistically significant 
(39% vs 20%;P=.063). PD-L1 expression was significantly more frequent in primary BCs than in metastases (43% vs 25%;P=.04). No 
significant difference was observed in PD-L1 expression among metastatic sites. 2 patients had paired primary and metastatic 
samples; PD-L1 was negative in both pairs. Among 81 TNBCs (27 primary BCs,56 recurrences/metastases), PD-L1 was positive in 40% 
and not associated with androgen receptor status (P=.17), metastatic site (P=.75) or genetic alterations (Fig.2). Among 45 primary BCs of 
all receptor subtypes (Table 1), PD-L1 expression was associated with high TIL percentage (P=.002) and metaplastic histology 
(P=.03;Fig.1A-B). 3 invasive lobular carcinomas were tested and were all PD-L1 negative (Fig.1C-D). PD-L1 expression was not 
significantly associated with patient age, tumor size, nodal status, histologic grade and TNBC status.

Conclusions: In our study cohort, 32% of primary and metastatic BCs were PD-L1 positive using the SP142 assay. PD-L1 expression was 
more frequent in primary BCs than in metastatic lesions, reflecting potential differences in immune microenvironment. Histologic features 
associated with PD-L1 expression in primary BCs included metaplastic carcinoma and increased TILs. Further studies are needed to 
identify other features.

Numbers of HER2-CISH and Treatment Outcomes of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in HER2-Positive 
Invasive Breast Cancer Patients

Disclosures: Yinan Hua: None; Arundhati Rao: None; Bing Leng: None 
Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is extensively adopted to treat HER2-positive invasive breast cancer, resulting in a high rate of 
pathologic complete response (pCR). Whereas, a portion of patients still have residual tumors after neoadjuvant therapy. The aim of the 
study is to investigate the factors contributing to the varied outcomes of neoadjuvant therapy, with a focus on intratumoral heterogeneity 
(ITH) and signal numbers of HER2. 
Design: HER2 chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) on biopsies from twenty-five HER2-positive invasive breast cancer patients 
receiving neoadjuvant therapy with Taxotere, Carboplatin and Herceptin (TCH), or TCH plus Perjeta (TCHP) are reviewed in the study. 
ITH-HER2 is defined as one area of tumor that is HER2 negative, or HER2 positivity in >5% and <50% of tumor cells. Residual cancer 
burden (RCB) on the breast excision specimens are calculated. 
 
 
180 
Results: Among 25 patients, 11 patients have pCR (44%), 6 patients are classified as RCB-I (24%), 6 patients are classified as RCB-II 
(24%), and 2 patients RCB-III (8%). ITH-HER2 is identified in 7 patients (7/25, 28%). In ITH-HER2 group, 3 patients achieve pCR (42.9%), 
2 patients have RCB-I (28.6%), 2 patients with RCB-II (28.6%) and none with RCB-III (0%). For 17 patients with high HER2 signal (>6), 
58.8% (10/17) of them achieve pCR. For 8 patients with low HER2 signal (4-6), 12.5% (1/8) of them have pCR. In the pCR group, 9.1% 
(1/11) of patients has low HER2 signal and 90.9% (10/11) of patients have high HER2 signal (P<0.05). In RCB-I group, 2 patients have low 
HER2 signal (33.3%), and 4 have high HER2 signal (66.7%). In RCB-III group, 2 patients have low HER2 signal (100%), and none has 
high HER2 signal. In patients with low HER2 signal, 37.5%  (3/8) of them display ITH-HER2, and for high HER2 signal patients, 23.5% 
(4/17) of them display ITH-HER2 (p>0.05). There is no significant difference in preoperative tumor size for patients with or without ITH-
HER2, and for patients with low or high HER2 signal. 
Conclusions: There is no significant relationship between ITH-HER2 and neoadjuvant outcomes. Interestingly, patients with high HER2-
CISH signal show significant better response to neoadjuvant therapy compared to patients with low HER2-CISH signal. In addition, the 
ITH-HER2 ratios in low and high HER2 signal groups are not significantly different.

Background: Compared with invasive ductal carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is larger, more common in older patients, and 
tends to be more commonly bilateral and multicentric. Up to 95% of ILCs express estrogen receptor (ER), 60-70% express progesterone 
receptor (PR) and very few express HER2. 
Design: We identified women diagnosed with HER2-positive ILC between 2015 and 2019 from our pathology database. Patients’ medical 
records were reviewed to obtain data on demographic and pathologic characteristics, including age, menopausal status, non-breast 
malignancy history, contralateral and concurrent ipsilateral breast lesions, disease site, clinical and pathological stage, imaging study 
findings, lymph node metastasis, Nottingham histological grade, histological type, HER2 immunohistochemistry, HER2 FISH results, Ki67 
index, pre-surgical neoadjuvant therapy, post-surgical adjuvant therapy, metastatic disease, and genetic testing. 
Results: We identified 16 women with HER2-positive ILC; their characteristics are given in the table. The patients’ mean age was 62 years 
(range, 49-75 years); all 16 patients were postmenopausal. Of the 16 patients, 4 (25%) had breast cancer history and 3 (18.8%) had atypia 
or malignancy in the contralateral breast. Among patients for whom the pertinent data were available, 12 of 15 (80.0%) had concurrent 
atypia or malignancy in the ipsilateral breast; 10 of 14 (71.5%) presented with clinical stage I or II disease; and 10 of 11 (90.9%) had a 
pathological disease stage of pT2 or lower. Of the 16 patients, 16 (100%) had Nottingham histological grade 1 or 2 disease; 15 (93.8) had 
ER-positive disease, and 7 (43.8%) had PR-positive disease. Of the 15 patients for whom HER2 IHC scores were available, 8 (53.3%) had 
a score of 2+, and 7 (46.7%) had a score of 3+; all 16 patients were positive for HER2 amplification by FISH (HER2:CEP 17 signal ratio 
ranges from 2.8 to 11.63; HER2 gene copy number arranges from 6.7 to 13.7). Ten of 15 patients (66.7%) received neoadjuvant chemo 
and anti-HER2 therapy, and 4 of 6 patients (66.7%) had a partial or complete response (2 partial and 2 complete).

Conclusions: HER2 positivity rarely occurs in classic ILC. Because histological and clinical features are not predictive of HER2 positivity, 
the evaluation of HER2 status should not be skipped based on histological features such as low nuclear grade. HER2-positive ILCs have 
high response rates to neoadjuvant systemic therapy. 
189 Comparison of Three FDA Approved PD-L1 Immunohistochemistry Assays in Triple Negative Breast 
Carcinoma

Disclosures: Xiao Huang: None; Qingqing Ding: None; Hua Guo: None; Dawen Sui: None; Yun Gong: None; Yun Wu: None; Hui Chen: 
None; Wei-Lien Billy Wang: None; Lei Huo: None 
Background: Several PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays have been approved by the FDA as companion or complementary 
diagnostics in different cancer types. The scoring methods of PD-L1 staining vary depending on the assay and the tumor type. Data on the 
comparison of PD-L1 assays in triple negative breast cancer are scant. Here, we compare the 28-8 Dako assay, 22C3 Dako assay and 
SP142 Ventana assay in triple negative breast cancer.   
Design: IHC staining for PD-L1 was performed on tissue microarrays constructed from primary triple negative breast cancer resection 
specimens of 101 patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2016 and treated in our institution. All patients received standard therapy without 
PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Percent PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC) was assessed as the proportion of tumor area 
occupied by PD-L1-positive immune cells of any intensity. Percent PD-L1 expression in invasive carcinoma cells (TC) was calculated as 
the number of viable invasive carcinoma cells showing membranous staining of any intensity divided by the total number of viable invasive 
carcinoma cells.  Percent PD-L1 expression in immune cells and invasive carcinoma cells (ICTC) was calculated as the number of PD-L1 
staining cells divided by the total number of viable invasive tumor cells. 1% or greater was considered positive. Cohen’s kappa coefficient 
(κ) was assessed for agreement between the assays. 
Results: Results of staining using 1% as cutoff are shown in Figure 1. Shown in Table 1, between 28-8 and 22C3, there was almost 
perfect agreement for IC, and substantial agreement for TC and ICTC. SP142 showed substantial agreement with 22C3 for ICTC and IC, 
and moderate agreement with 22C3 for TC and with 28-8 for all three scores. When all three assays were considered, disagreement was 
found in 15% (15/101) of case for TC, 24% (24/99) for ICTC and 22.4% (22/98) for IC. After the negative cases by all assays were 
excluded, there appeared to be some differences in the extent of staining with the assays, with SP142 showing a tendency to stain less 
than the others, especially when tumor cells were included in the scores (Figure 2).

Conclusions: 28-8, 22C3 and SP142 showed descending order of sensitivity for detecting PD-L1 expression in triple negative breast 
cancer. There were better agreements between 28-8 and 22C3 than between SP142 and another assay.  The clinical significance of 
different staining results generated from these assays requires further investigation in large clinical trials.

Background: The role of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in malignancy has been studied extensively and there is robust evidence 
that the levels of TILs is associated with better prognosis in certain types of malignancies. The levels of TILs have been associated with 
better prognosis in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients irrespective of treatment with chemotherapy. The methodology for 
evaluating TILs, however, is still evolving. 
Design: We retrospectively reviewed the density of stromal TILs in 41 TNBCs, all treated with primary surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. 
TILs were quantified by a pathologist blinded to the clinical outcome according to the guidelines of the International TILs Working Group 
2014. We calculated the TILs volume (TILV) using an existing formula: TILV = % tumor stroma × % stromal TILs. We classified cases as 
TILs poor (<50%) or rich (>50%), and TILV as low (<1300) or high (>1300). We also noted the presence of any lymphoid follicles. The 
difference between rates of overall survival was determined using the log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier survival plots. 
Results: The median overall survival (OS) for the cohort was 86 months (range, 7-152 months). The TIL-rich group had significantly better 
OS rates than those with TIL-poor tumors (p= 0.007). A TILV of more than 1300 correlated with better overall survival (p= 0.048). Although 
the presence of lymphoid follicles were more frequent in patients who had better OS, it was not statistically significant. In multivariate 
analysis, only the density of TILs was associated with better OS (p=0.02). TILV volume did not show a strong association with OS 
(p=0.051). Patients age, lymph node status, and tumor size did not show any statistical difference. 
Figure 1 - 190 
 
Conclusions: In this cohort of TNBC treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, the density of TILs emerged as a strong predictor of overall 
survival. We did not find any additional benefit of estimating TIL volume. This study highlights the importance of quantifying TILs routinely in 
pretreatment core biopsy specimens of TNBC.

Disclosures: Sarah Hugar: None; Rohit Bhargava: None; Beth Clark: None 
Background: Fibromatosis of the breast is uncommon and may be locally aggressive. Evaluation for nuclear expression of beta-catenin 
may aid in distinguishing fibromatosis from entities in the differential diagnosis and in evaluating resection margins, however systematic 
studies of beta-catenin expression in other entities in the differential have not been done. Our aim was to evaluate the staining pattern of 
beta-catenin in scars (both recent and remote) and myofibroblastomas, and to compare this to fibromatosis of the breast.  
Design: Following IRB approval, 28 cases of fibromatosis from 22 patients, 29 remote mastectomy scars from 16 patients, 21 recent core 
biopsy scars from 20 patients undergoing excision of flat epithelial atypia, and 14 myofibroblastomas were retrieved from the Anatomic 
Pathology information system (CoPath) and selected based on slide availability. Immunohistochemistry for beta-catenin was performed on 
representative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections (B-Catenin-1, 1:250 dilution, Dako). Cases were reviewed by two 
pathologists (BZC, SBH) for diagnosis and beta-catenin staining. The percent of lesional cells and stain intensity (0=absent, 1=weak, 
2=strong) for nuclear, cytoplasmic, and membranous staining was recorded. Presence of granular peri-nuclear staining was noted as 
present or absent. 
Results: In 28 cases of fibromatosis, nuclear beta-catenin staining was observed in all cases and was typically strong (27/28) and diffuse 
(mean 85% of lesional cells). Most remote scars (20/29), recent scars (20/21), and myofibroblastomas (13/14) were negative for nuclear 
beta-catenin staining. 10 of 50 scar cases showed some nuclear beta-catenin staining, but it was typically weak (8/10) and focal (less than 
or = 10% in 9/10). 1 myofibroblastoma showed weak and focal (10%) nuclear beta-catenin staining (Figure 1). For all diagnoses, a minority 
of cases showed granular cytoplasmic and peri-nuclear staining that can be misinterpreted as nuclear staining. 
Figure 1 - 191 
 
Conclusions: Evaluation of nuclear beta-catenin staining is a useful tool in the differential diagnosis of fibromatosis, and in determining 
margin status following re-excisions. In our study, although nuclear beta-catenin was seen in a minority of scars and myofibroblastomas, it 
was typically focal and weak. Granular cytoplasmic and peri-nuclear staining was seen in a minority of scar, re-excision, 
and myofibroblastoma cases; care must be taken to avoid over-interpreting this as true nuclear staining.

Background: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has an aggressive biology and hence poor prognosis. To date, there are no reliable 
molecular markers which can reliably predict TNBC outcome. We investigated whether carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), a hypoxia-inducible 
protein can predict progression and survival in TNBC. 
Design: Immunohistochemical analysis using a CAIX monoclonal antibody was performed on tissue micro-arrays constructed from FFPE 
tissue from TNBC patients (n=220). CAIX mRNA was extracted from FFPE tissue and digital mRNA quantification was performed by 
NanoString assays. CAIX protein and mRNA levels were correlated with clinicopathologic factors and survival. 
Results: CAIX protein was present in 40% of TNBCs and demonstrated significant association with both DFS (p<0.0004) and OS 
(p<0.0001) on univariate analysis. Increased CAIX protein levels showed strong association with  tumor size (p=0.0041) and histologic 
grade (p=0.0003). Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with CAIX-positive TNBCs had significantly worse disease-free survival 
(DFS) (HR = 2.95; 95% CI 1.746–4.995; p= 0.0001) and overall survival (OS) (HR = 2.43; 95% CI 1.34–4.411; p = 0.0035), after adjusting 
for the effects of known prognostic factors. Comparative analysis of gene expression profiles between CAIX-low and CAIX-high groups 
showed that seven genes were significant in these two groups of patients: ARL1, CAIX, DDIT4, IL6ST, SETX, TUBA4A and WAS. Three 
genes (WAS, SETX and DDIT4) were related to DNA repair. 
Conclusions: Based on our results CAIX appears to be a significant hypoxia-inducible molecular marker regulating tumor progression in 
TNBC. Increased CAIX protein levels are independently associated with poor survival in TNBC. CAIX expression reflects significant 
aggressive biological behaviour in TNBC which may be used to predict clinical outcome and identify patients in need for selective CAIX-
targeted therapy.

Background: Triple negative breast carcinomas (TNBC) are aggressive neoplasms where the immune microenvironment plays a pivotal 
role in influencing the disease course. Approved immuno-oncology agents are now available for immune check point-based treatments in 
TNBCs and identifying the immune environment of tumors can be a key to more effective utilization of the same. The aim of this study is to 
assess the differences between the gene expression patterns as defined by the modified version of the previously published tumor 
inflammatory signature (TIS) between the Caucasian (CA) and African American (AA) ethnic groups with an emphasis on defining the 
antigen presenting regulatory pathways. 
Design: The database was searched and 84 patients (42 AA and 42CA) with TNBC were identified. Total mRNA was extracted from the 84 
TNBC specimens (Qiagen, MD). mRNA expressions of 785 breast cancer-related genes in 42 CA and 42 AA individuals were quantitated 
and analyzed using nSolver Analysis Software (V2.5). Of these, 18 genes including 5 antigen presenting cell abundance genes, 2 T cell/NK 
cell abundance genes, 6 interferon activity genes and 5 T cell exhaustion genes as well as 3 housekeeping genes were studied. Statistical 
analysis was performed. 
Results:  All analyzed TIS genes showed higher levels of mRNA expression in the AA subset (Table 1, Figures 1 & 2). PSMB10, HLA-
DRB3, HLA-E, CCL5, CD27, CXCR6, IDO1, STAT1, TIGIT, LAG3, CD274 (PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2), showed statistically 
significant difference in expression between the two ethnic groups with p <= 0.05 (Table 1). The genes studied under the interferon activity 
and T cell exhaustion related TIS groups showed prominently increased mRNA expression in the AA subset in comparison to the CA 
subset.  The differential expression of these genes correlated with an increased rate of tumor metastasis (P = 0.04) and recurrences (P = 
0.003) in the AA subset. The housekeeping genes showed no differential expression as expected and served as controls.

Conclusions: Our study identified statistically significant differential expression of TIS genes which correlates with unfavorable outcomes. 
These upregulated genes could serve as useful biomarkers of outcome as well as therapeutic targets in the AA subset of TNBCs.

Background: Fibroepithelial lesions (FEL) of the breast comprise a spectrum of neoplasms spanning from fibroadenomas (FA), through 
benign fibroepithelial neoplasms (FEN), to phyllodes tumors (PT). Definitive categorization of cellular FELs on core needle biopsy (CNB) is 
challenging due to morphologic overlap. The distinction between FAs and PTs is clinically significant due to the risk of local and distant 
recurrence of the latter, which are currently treated with excision (EXC) with wide surgical margins. FAs are followed or enucleated. When 
there is histologic concern for a PT on CNB, it is our practice to call these “cellular FELs” and recommend excision. In this study, we 
analyzed the individual histologic and radiologic features of FELs on CNB that were upgraded to FENs and PTs on EXC as well as which 
combination of features was most predictive of upgrade to PTs. 
Design: FELs on CNBs between 1/2012-2/2019 were identified; cases without EXC were excluded. All imaging and CNB slides were re-
reviewed. Imaging and histologic features evaluated are recorded in Table 1. Spearman rank correlation and Mann-Whitney test were used 
to evaluate association of features with PTs. Logistic regression was used to predict upgrade to PT. Variables with association level p<0.1 
on a multivariable logistic regression model including all variables were included in the final model. 
Results: 172 cellular FELs diagnosed on CNB were identified; 111 received EXC. 72 FAs (64.8%), 14 FENs (12.6%), 18 benign PTs 
(16.2%), and 7 borderline PTs (6.3%) were identified. Features that were statistically significant for upgrade to PTs are bolded in Table 1. A 
model including lesion size, stromal cellularity, and fragmentation was able to predict upgrade to PT with area under the ROC curve of 
0.88.

Conclusions: On EXC, 35.1% of FELs on CNB were upgraded to FENs and PTs (12.6% FENs, 22.5% PTs). In our cohort, features that 
were independently predictive of upgrade to PTs included lesion size, stromal cellularity, stromal cell nuclear pleomorphism, heterogeneity, 
and fragmentation. A combination of stromal cellularity, fragmentation, and lesion size on US was highly predictive of upgrade to PTs. In 
our experience, a subset of each category had indistinct histologic margins which likely contributed to some FAs being categorized as 
cellular FEL on CNB. FELs are challenging to categorize on CNB and this study suggests that certain features and combination of features 
are most useful when evaluating CNB of these lesions.

Background: Breast papillary lesions consist of various and heterogenous diseases ranging from benign to malignant lesions, and they 
have overlapping pathologic features and several different classifications, making it the most difficult diagnostic challenges in breast 
pathology. We aim to investigate the diagnostic agreement of papillary lesions in breast core needle biopsy specimens. 
Design: Sixty papillary lesions diagnosed on breast core needle biopsy were reviewed by twenty breast pathologists from twenty 
institutions in Korea. The same pathologists also reviewed immunohistochemical (IHC) stains for CK5 and p63 performed in the same 
cases. The diagnostic agreement with or without IHC was analyzed with 2012 WHO classification and then compared to other classification 
systems like four-tier, three-tier, and two-tier classifications. 
Results: The overall kappa coefficient was 0.20, 0.31, 0.40, 0.43 by H&E slides alone and 0.28, 0.38, 0.37, 0.63 by additional IHC stains 
with WHO, four-tier, three-tier, and two-tier classification systems, respectively. The interobserver agreement improved with the use of IHC 
in most classifications except for three-tier classification system. WHO classification increased interobserver variability in comparison with 
any other classifications by both H&E (k=0.20) and IHC (k=0.28) stains. The highest agreement was seen in two-tier classification by IHC 
stains (k=0.63). In spite of IHC stains, encapsulated/solid papillary carcinoma (E/SPC) subgroup (k=0.16) showed lower agreement than 
non-E/SPC subgroup (k=0.35) with WHO classification, which was similar to the results with any other classifications. 
Conclusions: Although the use of IHC for CK5 and p63 increases the diagnostic agreement of papillary lesions in breast core needle 
biopsy specimens, WHO classification shows higher discordance rate than any other classifications. Therefore, more intensive consensus 
studies are imperative to improve the diagnostic agreement and categorization of these lesions with WHO classification.

Background: The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) recommends the use of the largest tumor size for pathologic staging of 
multifocal breast cancer (MBC). However, the recently updated AJCC 8th edition now takes biologic factors such as grade, biomarker 
profile, and genomic panels into account for breast cancer prognostication. We sought to study MBCs at our institution and track their path 
to metastasis in an attempt to gain further insight into variables of aggressiveness other than traditional size. 
Design: We searched for MBC cases within our database from 2010 through 2017. Age, procedure type, laterality, size, histologic grade 
(G), presence of metastasis (axillary or distant) and biomarker profile of the primary and metastases were recorded. The biomarker profiles 
 
 
191 
were classified as hormone receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor 2 positive (Her2+) or triple negative (TN), and deemed 
concordant (C) if similar or discordant (D) if dissimilar. 
Results: Of 473 MBCs, 260 had at least two biomarker profiles reported. The majority of the latter patients underwent total mastectomy 
(67%) while 33% had partial mastectomy. Of 554 total tumor foci, 462 (93% C, 7% D) were HR+ (17% G1, 62% G2, 21% G3), 65 (66% C, 
34% D) were Her2+ (34% G2, 66% G3) and 27 (74% C, 26% D) were TN (19% G2, 81% G3). There were 233 (90%) concordant cases 
and 27 (10%) discordant. Of the 260 cases, 12 (4.6%) discordant cases had tumor foci with the same morphology and G.  Twelve of the 
discordant cases had axillary and/or distant metastases, 4 of which with a biomarker profile available for the metastatic tumor (Table).  The 
metastatic biomarker profiles of these 4 cases indicate that, of the two primary foci, the focus with the largest tumor size, equal or higher G, 
and Her2+ status metastasized in 75%, 75% and 50% of cases, respectively.

Conclusions: Our data show that about 90% of patients with MBC can be expected to have the same biomarker profile in all tumor foci. 
However, 4.6% of cases with multiple biomarker profiles showed discordant profiles despite similar morphology and G. It can be concluded 
then, that a similar percentage of cases on which only one set of biomarkers were performed, actually had discordant profiles. These 
patients may have had additional treatment options than otherwise indicated by the single biomarker profile. In addition, our data shows 
that tumor G, size and biomarker profile all contribute to predicting tumor behavior, supporting the updated AJCC 8th edition. 
197 Impact of the Updated American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists

Recommendations

Background: HER2 status is an important prognostic and predictive factor in breast cancer, and it should be evaluated for every invasive 
breast cancer (IBC) patient in current clinical practice. Since the ASCO/CAP established HER2 testing guideline in 2007, two major 
updates were made in 2013 and 2018. We assessed the clinical impact of the updated ASCO/CAP guidelines by comparing categorization 
according to the 2007, 2013, and 2018 ISH classification criteria. 
Design: We collected 1183 IBC cases with both IHC and silver-enhanced ISH (SISH) results for HER2 from January 2010 to October 
2013. Specimens consisted of primary breast carcinomas resected by surgical excision. Recently, in South Korea, immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) is the primary test for HER2, and ISH could be performed in only IHC 2+ cases. For a while, all IBC cases were referred to both IHC 
and ISH until October 2013. Initial HER2 status were interpreted according to 2007 guidelines by a senior breast pathologist at the time of 
diagnosis. The average HER2 and CEP17 signals per cell, and HER2/CEP17 ratio were obtained from pathology reports. The cases were 
grouped under each 2007, 2013, and 2018 ASCO/CAP criteria and compared the results each other. 
Results: Compared to 2007 recommendations, 25 (2.1%) and 14 (1.2%) cases were recategorized under 2013 and 2018 updates, 
respectively (Figures 1 and 2). The 2013 guidelines increased positive cases (5 from equivocal, and 3 from negative) in comparison to 
2007. Any specific tendency was not observed in comparison between 2007 and 2018 criteria (Figure 2). Seventeen (1.4%) cases were 
recategorized from 2013 to 2018 guidelines (Figure 1). Most of equivocal cases (13/14) in 2013 criteria became negative according to 2018 
guidelines, and most of them (12/13) were negative according to 2007 guidelines. Among 1183 cases, 26 (2.2%) were affected by 2013 
and 2018 guideline updates.

Conclusions: Our results showed that positive and equivocal cases were increased under 2013 guidelines, compared to 2007 guidelines. 
On the other hand, noticeable change in 2018 guideline is elimination of ambiguous cases by reclassification of them into HER2-negative 
group. We are expecting the 2018 ASCO/CAP guideline may give precise option to patients’ treatment. Further studies are needed for 
clinical outcome of new criteria.

Disclosures: Kristina-Ana Klaric: None; Sarah Strickland: None; Tadros Atalla: None; Zuzana Kos: None 
Background: Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast is a rare but aggressive cancer. A diagnostic challenge, particularly in small biopsies, is 
differentiating spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma from other benign and malignant spindle cell lesions of the breast. SOX10 is expressed in 
a subset of breast cancers, particularly triple-negative and basal-like breast cancers. We evaluated SOX10 staining in metaplastic 
carcinomas and other spindle cell lesions of the breast. 
Design: SOX10 staining was performed on cases of metaplastic carcinoma and other spindle cell lesions of the breast (malignant 
phyllodes, primary breast sarcoma, fibromatosis, nodular fasciitis, myofibroblastoma, solitary fibrous tumour and inflammatory 
myofibroblastic tumour) identified from our institution’s pathology archives from 2003–2018. Staining in ≥1% of cells was considered 
positive. 
Results: A total of 76 cases of metaplastic carcinoma were identified, including 20 spindled, 8 mixed spindle and other mesenchymal 
components, 25 squamous, 18 chondroid and 5 showing other morphologies. Of the 28 cases with a spindle cell component, 10 showed 
low/intermediate-grade monotonous spindle cells and 18 showed frankly malignant high-grade sarcomatous cells. SOX10 was positive in 
34 (45%) metaplastic carcinomas with differing frequency across subtypes – staining 96% of chondroid and 26% of squamous cases. Only 
14% (4/28) of spindle cell metaplastic carcinomas stained positive with SOX10, all 4 cases showing high-grade sarcomatous spindle cells 
(22%). No SOX10 staining was seen in malignant phyllodes tumours (0/11) or primary breast sarcomas (0/13). None of the lower grade 
spindle cell metaplastic carcinomas stained for SOX10, while a small proportion of nodular fasciitis (1/4) and fibromatosis (3/25) cases 
showed weak focal positivity (1% staining). SOX10 was negative in all cases of myofibroblastoma (0/11), solitary fibrous tumour (0/3), and 
inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (0/2).  
Conclusions: SOX10 stains most metaplastic carcinomas with chondroid (matrix-producing) features but shows minimal expression in 
carcinomas with spindle-cell morphology. SOX10 expression in a high-grade sarcomatous lesion supports metaplastic carcinoma over 
malignant phyllodes tumour or primary sarcoma, but is expressed in only a minority of cases. There is no role for SOX10 in differentiating 
metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma from the other spindle cell lesions of the breast.

upgrade rate at excision (EXC) of variant LCIS diagnosed on core needle biopsy (CNB) at our center. 
Design: We searched our pathology database for inhouse CNBs obtained 1/2000-6/2019 with a diagnosis of “carcinoma in situ with ductal 
and lobular features”, or LCIS and “pleomorphic”, “massive acinar expansion” and/or “necrosis”. Patients (pts) with concurrent ipsilateral 
(micro)invasive carcinoma, DCIS, ADH, no excision, or no available slides were excluded. Upon slide review we recorded CLCIS, PLCIS 
(nuclear atypia akin to high grade DCIS), FLCIS (classic LCIS cytomorphology with little/no intervening stroma between markedly 
distended acini and/or >40 cells in diameter), LCIS with pleomorphic features (LCIS-PF; cytomorphology between CLCIS type B cells and 
PLCIS), apocrine features, necrosis, and calcifications. A radiologist reviewed all pertinent imaging studies. Upgrade was defined as 
(micro)invasive carcinoma or DCIS at EXC. The IRB approved the study. 
Results: The patient cohort consisted of 33 women (median age 61 years, range 45-79); 15 (45%) pts had history of breast cancer (BC), 
and 3 of CLCIS. There were a total of 34 CNBs: 8 (23%) had PLCIS, 22 (65%) FLCIS and 4 (12%) LCIS-PF. Apocrine features were seen 
in 63% PLCIS and 23% FLCIS. Table 1 summarizes clinicopathologic features and findings at EXC. All cases were radiologic-pathologic 
concordant except one (imaging: irregular mass; CNB: apocrine FLCIS; EXC: no upgrade). The upgrade rate of PLCIS and FLCIS 
combined was 20%. The CNBs with upgrade had 2 PLCIS+necrosis, and 4 FLCIS+necrosis. Menopausal status, BC history, calcifications, 
and apocrine features did not correlate with upgrade, but necrosis showed a positive trend (p=0.06, x2 test). At follow-up one pt (CNB 
FLCIS, EXC no upgrade, no radiation or hormonal therapy) recurred with microinvasion 24 months (mo) later. Another pt (CNB PLCIS, 
EXC microinvasion, no radiation or hormonal therapy) recurred with invasive carcinoma at 41 mo.

200 The Impact of MYC Amplification on Clinicopathologic Features and Prognosis of Radiation-
Associated Angiosarcomas of the Breast

Disclosures: M Gabriela Kuba: None; Bin Xu: None; Cristina Antonescu: None 
Background: Radiation-associated angiosarcomas of the breast (RT-AS) are rare tumors with overall poor prognosis. MYC amplification 
represents the genetic hallmark of these tumors and is often used as a diagnostic marker to distinguish from an atypical vascular lesion. 
However, a small subset of RT-AS lacks MYC amplifications, which might be difficult to diagnose and might be associated with a distinct 
pathogenesis. In this study we sought to examine the impact of MYC gene amplification as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH) and/or next generation sequencing (NGS) on clinicopathologic features and outcome in a large cohort of RT-AS managed at our 
institution. 
Design: The pathology database was searched for cases of RT-AS diagnosed between 1/1998 and 8/2019. All patients had been 
previously treated with radiotherapy for breast cancer (BC). All cases were tested for MYC amplification by FISH or NGS. Clinicopathologic 
and follow-up data were obtained from the medical records. Fisher’s exact test was used for comparison of MYC amplified and not 
amplified groups. Log rank test and Cox proportional hazard model were used for outcome analysis. 
Results: 81 women were selected, with a median age at diagnosis of 69 years (range 48-95) and a median interval from BC to RT-AS 
diagnosis of 7.5 years (range 3-25). Clinical presentation included skin erythema/bruising +/- thickening (61%), palpable masses (34%) or 
papules (3%). Initial surgery consisted of mastectomy for all patients status-post lumpectomy for BC (n=71), and wide local excision in 
those with prior mastectomy (n=6). Two patients had extensive breast involvement at diagnosis and did not undergo surgery. All except 2 
RT-AS (97%) were high grade, 12 of 65 (19%) showed epithelioid features, 19 of 64 (30%) tumor >5 cm, and 7 of 73 (10%) had positive 
margins at initial surgery. Eight (10%) cases lacked MYC amplification. Median follow up was 22 months (range 0-231); 5-year overall 
survival (OS) 51%. On univariate analysis, positive margin (p=0.002) and MYC amplification (p=0.026) was associated with decreased OS. 
On multivariate analysis positive margin was the only independent adverse factor associated with worse OS (HR 3.72, 95% CI 1.38-10.02, 
p=0.009). 
Conclusions: Lack of MYC amplification is seen in 10% of RT-AS and does not exclude a diagnosis of malignancy. RT-AS have an overall 
poor OS, with positive margin status and MYC amplification being adverse factors. Histologically low grade RT-AS were only seen in MYC-
non-amplified group.

Carcinoma

Background: Histologic grade measured by the Nottingham Histologic Grading System (NHGS) is a strong prognostic predictor in patients 
with breast carcinoma.  Mitotic activity, one of the components of the NHGS, is scored based on the number of mitoses seen in ten 
contiguous high-power fields (HPFs).  A common pitfall encountered in limited biopsy specimens is the inability to find ten HPFs of the 
tumor at the tumor edge.  Therefore, we have developed a method to grade mitotic activity in core biopsies by counting the highest number 
of mitoses in one HPF at the tumor edge where the mitotic activity is the highest.  We propose a score of 1, 2, or 3, if we find 0-1, 2, or >= 3 
mitoses in one HPF, respectively.   
Design: A total of 133 cases of breast core biopsy, followed by a partial or complete mastectomy with a diagnosis of invasive breast 
carcinoma were reviewed.  Cases with tumors less than ten HPFs, microinvasive carcinoma, and with neoadjuvant treatment were 
excluded.  Each investigator, utilizing a microscope with field diameter of 0.55 mm, performed a blinded mitotic count in one and ten HPFs 
in each core biopsy and ten HPFs in each accompanying resection specimen and then converted to mitotic scores.  For the ten HPF 
counts, we followed the College of American Pathologists (CAP) recommendations: 0-8 mitoses 1 point, 9-17 mitoses 2 points, and >= 18 
mitoses 3 points.  The correlation between the scores in the biopsy and excision specimen was measured by the Pearson correlation 
coefficient (r). 
Results: The r was calculated as follows: mitotic score in one and ten HPFs in each core biopsy; r=0.705, mitotic score in ten HPFs in 
each core biopsy and ten HPFs in the accompanying resection specimen; r=0.678, and mitotic score in one HPF in each core biopsy and 
ten HPFs in the accompanying resection specimen; r=0.642.  The concordance rates between each group were 84.2%, 83.5%, and 80.5% 
respectively.  All r values exhibited a significant correlation with p-value <0.01. 
 
 
196 
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate significant correlation and concordance rate between one HPF and ten HPFs mitotic score in each 
core biopsy.  The correlation and concordance rate of the mitotic score between one HPF in the core biopsy and ten HPFs in the excision 
is comparable to that of ten HPFs in the core biopsy and excision.  These results show our proposed method may be utilized in conjunction 
with conventional mitotic scoring methodologies, especially when a small amount of tissue is available for grading in core biopsies.

Background: Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 are important markers of breast carcinoma. Differences of 
immunohistochemical (IHC) markers among primary breast carcinoma (PBC) specimens before chemotherapy and metastatic carcinoma 
specimens to the lung (MCL) can affect the treatment plans and prognoses of patients. 
Design: One hundred and six cases, 34 neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and 72 adjuvant chemotherapy (ADCT), were selected in 
which paraffin blocks of PBC and MCL were available. NACT and ADCT were consisted of docetaxel and doxorubicin, and hormone and/or 
trastuzumab therapy were done according to expression profiles of PBC. Expression of ER, PR, and HER2 was assayed in PBC and MCL. 
Cutoff values of ER and PR positivity were both 10% and strong membranous staining by immunohistochemistry and/or amplification by 
fluorescence in situ hybridization was considered as positive for HER2. McNemar test was used for the changes of the markers. The 
analyses were also compared between two groups. 
Results: Changes of ER, PR, and HER2 expression were shown in 5, 20, and 5 cases, respectively. No cases which two or more markers 
were changed simultaneously were found. There was a significant loss of PR expression between PBC and MCL in all cases (p=0.0008) 
whereas there was a tendency of gain of ER expression (p=0.0736). Loss of PR expression was prominent in ADCT group (p=0.0060) but 
not in NACT group (p=0.1336). Changes of HER2 were not statically significant (p=0.3711). Subtype was changed in seven of 98 cases 
(7.14%) between PBC and MCL and the changes were not statistically significant (p=0.2276). Four out of 16 HER2-positive subtype 
cancers in PBC were changed into two luminal and two triple-negative cancers after chemotherapy, which was due to loss of HER2 
expression after trastuzumab treatment. 
Conclusions: IHC studies for ER, PR, HER2 should not only be assessed in the biopsy specimens of PBC, but also in the MCL specimen 
after NACT or ADCT for establishing the further treatment plans. Especially, HER2 expression and/or amplification should be assayed 
because the expression can be lost after trastuzumab therapy.

Background: HER2/neu aberrations represent an established negative prognostic factor in invasive breast cancer; however, its prognostic 
significance in DCIS is not known. Here, we examined HER2/neu status in DCIS to assess its clinicopathologic associations and prognostic 
value. 
Design: HER2/neu status was evaluated in 380 patients with a diagnosis of pure DCIS on core biopsy who subsequently underwent 
excision at our institution. HER2/neu status was assessed using immunohistochemical staining and was scored using ASCO/CAP criteria. 
Results: For the entire 380-case cohort, 10%, 32.2%, and 47.8% were low grade, intermediate grade, and high grade, respectively. The 
extent of disease ranged from 0.1 cm to 14 cm (mean: 2.5 cm). The subsequent excisions revealed microinvasion in 21 (5.5%) of the 380 
cases, 10 (47.6%) of which were HER2/neu-positive. Nodal metastasis were identified in 2.5% of the 155 cases in which lymph node 
sampling was performed and 50% of the node-positive cases were HER2/neu-positive.  HER2/neu protein was over-expressed at the 3+ 
level in 31.5% of all cases. HER2/neu positive DCIS was associated with higher nuclear grade (p<0.0001), presence of comedonecrosis 
(p<0.0001), larger extent of disease, and the presence of microinvasion in subsequent resection (p<0.0001). On follow-up, 32.8% of 
HER2/neu-positive cases were associated with a recurrence as compared with 30.1% of HER2-negative cases (p=.80). 
 
 
197 
Conclusions: In our study cohort, the frequency of HER2/neu positivity in DCIS (31.5%)  was higher than historically reported data for 
invasive carcinomas. HER2/neu positive DCIS was associated with features of poor prognosis including higher nuclear grade, more 
extensive disease, and the presence of microinvasion. No statistically significant increase in risk of recurrence was identified in HER2/neu 
positive DCIS.  
204 miR-454 Reduces Sensitivity of ER-Positive Breast Cancer Cells to Tamoxifen by Simultaneously 
Targeting at RUNX3 and ERα 
Hui Liu1, Chenxi Xiang1, Dongshen Ma1

Disclosures: Chenxi Xiang: None 
Background: Tamoxifen is a widely used endocrine therapy agent for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer. However, tamoxifen 
resistance developed despite the initial response of patients. Activation of multiple cancer-promoting signaling pathways, the acquisition of 
estrogent independent ER signaling and also breast cancer cells gaining stem-cell like traits can all lead to tamoxifen resistance. miR-454 
is a miRNA that is highly expressed in a variety of tumors, but its functional studies in breast cancer remains few. This study aimes at 
investigating whether miR-454 could regulate tamoxifen sensitivity of ER-positive breast cancer cells and the mechanisms underpinning the 
phenomenon. 
Design: The expression levels of miR-454 were studied by qPCR in normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A, ER positive breast cancer 
cell line MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-231 and BT-474. The effect of miR-454 on cell survival and apoptosis after tamoxifen treatment was 
studied using CCK8 method and flow cytometry. We predicted the targets of miR-454 on miRanda, Targetsacn and miRDB. A GO analysis 
was performed based on the target genes shared. The combining of miR-454 to its targets was verified using the luciferase reporter assay 
and WB assay. The regulation of Wnt signaling pathway by miR-454 was studied using TOP-Flash system, immunofluorescence and WB 
assay. The regulation of miR-454 on the stem-like traits of breast cancer cells was studied using 3D tumor sphere formation assay, flow 
cytometry and WB assay. 
Results: miR-454 was high expressed in ER-positive breast cancer cells, but low expressed in MCF-10A and ER-negative breast cancer 
cells (1A). miR-454 significantly reduced the sensitivity to tamoxifen of ER-positive breast cancer cells and reduced tamoxifen-induced 
apoptosis in ER-positive breast cancer cells (1B, 1C). The targets of miR-454 were mainly enriched in the Wnt signaling pathway (2A). 
Luciferase reporter assay and Western blotting assay confirmed that miR-454 could target at RUNX3 and ERα (2B, 2C). TOP-Flash assay 
revealed that miR-454 could regulate Wnt signaling (2D). At last, miR-454 could significantly promote the stem-like traits of breast cancer 
cells (2E).

Figure 2 - 204 
 
Conclusions: miR-454 is mainly expressed in ER-positive breast cancer cells. And miR-454 can target at RUNX3 to activate Wnt signaling 
pathway and promote stem-cell like traits of breast cancer cells. At the same time, it can directly target at ER to suppress its expression 
and inhibit the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen.

Disclosures: Xulei Liu: None; Lanjing Zhang: Employee, Celgene; Stock Ownership, Celgene 
Background: Accurate modelling of invasive breast cancer (IBC) survival helps improve treatment and prognostication. Commonly used 
Cox survival model is valid only when the assumption of constant hazard ratio (HR) is met (i.e. HR does not change as followup time 
changes). But it is rarely studied in prior works. Therefore, we examined the assumption of constant HR in common prognostic factors of 
IBC. 
Design: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-18 database to select women aged 20+ years with the 
diagnosis of primary IBC in 2004, who were followed up for at least 2 months and until 2014. Cox proportional hazards models were 
performed and the constant HR assumptions were examined. 
Results: We included 34,013 patients, 64% of whom had ER+PR+ IBC, 73.7% had invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), 95% had surgery, 
46% had chemotherapy, 55% had radiotherapy, and 73% with menopause. Approximately 33% (11388/34013) of patients died from any 
causes, and 16% (5412/34013) from IBC. 
In both all-cause and IBC-specific mortality analyses, menopause, black, histologic grade 3, pT3 or pT4, pN+, pM+, and ER+PR- were 
associated with a constant higher risk of mortality throughout the study period compared to their reference groups, respectively; other race, 
surgery, and chemotherapy were associated with a constant lower risk of mortality (Table). Interestingly, the effects of ER-PR- and 
radiotherapy on mortalities changed over time, which did not comply with the constant-HR assumption. At the time of diagnosis and 
treatment, the ER-PR- patients were more likely to die compared to the patients with ER+PR+; however, the likelihood of death decreased 
over time, and after around 66 months, having ER-PR- IBC became less likely to die compared to the patients with ER+PR+ (Figure). The 
patients with radiotherapy were less likely to die compared to the patients without it at the beginning, then this protective effect diminished 
 
 
199 
over time, and after around 36 months, it stayed plateau throughout the rest of the study period (Figure). Surprisingly, there was no 
difference in all-cause mortality among different histologic types. In the IBC-specific mortality analysis, the patients with mixed ductal and 
lobular carcinoma had a slightly higher risk compared to the patients with IDC (Table)

Conclusions: Hormone status and radiotherapy are time-dependent prognostic factors for IBC, which needs to be adjusted in modelling 
IBC survival. More studies on the mechanism of time-varying predictors are needed.

Background: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women, and its incidence is increasing worldwide. There is currently no 
effective therapy to control the recurrence and metastasis of breast cancer. The fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13) was shown to be up-
regulated in various cancers and associated with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis. However, the role of 
FGF13 in breast cancer (BC) progression and metastasis remains incompletely understood. In the present study, we investigated the 
effects of FGF13 on BC metastasis and proliferation, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms.  
Design: 13 ductal invasive carcinoma tissues and 8 ductal carcinoma in situ tissues were collected between January 2019 and August 
2019 in the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University .The expression of FGF13 mRNA levels was compared by real-time quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction（RT-qPCR）.Then we analyzed the role of FGF13 in breast cancers based on database. Overexpression 
of FGF13 in two BC cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, MTS assays and clone formation assays were used to detect breast proliferation, 
wound healing Assay and transwell test were used for observing breast cancer migration. Next, we used RT-qPCR and Western blot to 
detect the expression of EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) markers mRNA and protein levels. 
Results:  Bioinformatics database analysis indicated that the high expression of FGF13 was closely associated with good survival in BC. 
Clinical results showed that FGF13 expression was higher in ductal carcinoma in situ than that in invasive carcinoma (p<0.05). Then we 
found that FGF13 inhibited the proliferation of BC cells in MTS and clone formation experiments. (p<0.05). Transwell assay demonstrated 
that FGF13 diminished cell migration of BC cells(p<0.05). Additionally, the overexpression of FGF13 in BC cell line resulted in the induction 
of increase in E-cadherin(CDH1).

Conclusions: Taken together, our results suggest that FGF13 acts as a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates BC cell 
proliferation and migration, and the effect on breast cancer migration may be linked to the EMT process.

Background: Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) is a rare clonal proliferation of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts. DTF are locally aggressive and 
have the potential for local recurrence (LR) but do not metastasize. Mammary DTF (MDTF) is similar to DTF elsewhere and represents 
approximately 0.2% of all breast tumors. The etiology is unknown; however, there is an association with prior trauma and genetic factors 
 
 
202 
(e.g. Gardner-type familial adenomatous polyposis [GTFAP]). Treatment paradigms are shifting toward observation rather than excision for 
DTF, as such we sought to review our institutional experience with this rare neoplasm. 
Design: MDTF diagnosed between 2004-2019 were retrospectively identified. Clinical and pathology data were reviewed. 
Results: 31 patients with MDTF were identified, 28 of whom underwent surgical excision with a mean follow-up of 3.5 years (0 to 10 
years); 3 patients were lost to follow-up. 29 (94%) were women. The median age was 41 years (range 19-84). 18 (58%) presented with a 
palpable mass. Average size on imaging was 1.9 cm (range 0.5-10.5). Prior history of potential trauma was noted for 10 (32%) patients, 
including 9 with prior biopsies or surgery. 2 patients had additional DTF: 1 with an abdominal wall DTF and 1 (with GTFAP) had multiple 
DTF and Gardner fibromas. B-catenin IHC was performed on all cases; 26 (84%) had positive nuclear staining. Of 19 patients with positive 
surgical margins, 8 were re-excised. At last follow-up, 30 patients had not experienced a LR. None of 10 patients with positive margins 
experienced LR (1 was lost to follow-up). One patient with negative margins recurred 13 months after surgery; 15 months after excision for 
the LR the patient remained disease free. The patient with GTFAP was treated with Sundilac for a subsequent abdominal DTF. 2 patients 
declined excision and had no progression 1 and 2 years later. 
Conclusions: The treatment for DTF is evolving with contemporary literature suggesting active surveillance, however, data are limited. In 
our cohort, the 2 patients who declined excision experienced no change and a slight decrease in tumor size at 1 and 2 years, respectively. 
Ten cases with final positive margins did not experience a LR. LR occurred in 1 patient with negative resection margins of the initial MDTF. 
Our data support a conservative approach for the management of MDTF. Further investigation of factors related to risk for LR/progression 
in MDTF, including chromosomal alterations and CTNNB1-mutation is needed. 
208 Evaluation of Subareolar Tissue Biopsies in Predicting Occult Nipple Involvement in Nipple-Sparing 
Mastectomies

Disclosures: Lucy Ma: None; Paula Ginter: None 
Background: Nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) is an increasingly utilized oncologic surgical procedure; however, there is risk of residual 
malignancy lingering in the preserved nipple areolar complex (NAC). To minimize this risk, routine subareolar tissue sampling for 
pathologic evaluation is performed. Malignant diagnoses typically warrant excision of the nipple/NAC.  The rate of residual malignancy in 
nipple/NAC excisions following a positive subareolar biopsy has not been widely studied. We sought to determine the rate of residual 
carcinoma in nipple/NAC excisions following a positive subareolar biopsy and assess the value of intraoperative frozen section (IOF) of 
subareolar biopsies. 
Design: We identified 1026 consecutive NSMs with separately submitted subareolar biopsies between 12/2013 and 05/2019. Biopsies 
containing invasive carcinoma and/or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) were considered positive. Concordance rates between subareolar 
biopsies and subsequent excisions were examined as well as IOF and permanent diagnoses. Clinicopathologic data were reviewed and 
statistical analyses were performed using chi-square test. 
Results: Of the 1026 NSMs, 575 (56 %) were therapeutic and 451 (44 %) were prophylactic [Figure 1]. Only 5% (51/1026) of subareolar 
biopsies were positive [Table 1]. Of the positive subareolar biopsies, 78% (40/51) underwent subsequent excision with 50% (20/40) 
showing residual malignancy. Positive biopsies were significantly associated with multifocal/multicentric disease when compared to 
negative biopsies (p=0.002). There was no statistically significant difference in likelihood of biopsy positivity between tumors ≤2 cm vs. >2 
cm from the nipple (p>0.05). IOF was performed in 273 cases (27%), of which 4 (1.5%) demonstrated a discrepancy between frozen and 
permanent diagnoses. In 3 discrepant cases, malignancy was only present on permanent section. In 1 case, the IOF was interpreted as 
malignant; however, on the permanent slide, the focus was shown to be benign (i.e. true false positive).

Conclusions: While the rate of positive subareolar biopsies in NSM is low, positive subareolar biopsy predicts the presence of residual 
occult carcinoma in half of nipple/NAC excisions. Positive subareolar biopsies were more frequently seen in patients with 
multifocal/multicentric disease. Additionally, IOF is accurate and reliable for subareolar biopsy diagnosis. 
209 Patients with Benign Papilloma Diagnosed on Core Biopsies and Concordant Pathology-Radiology

Background: Although there is a national trend to spare patients from surgery when a benign papilloma is diagnosed on image-guided 
core biopsy, the data remain controversial. 
Design: Based on the results of published retrospective studies and our own experiences, we prospectively reviewed the clinical history, 
imaging, and pathology of all contemporaneous papilloma cases in a multispecialty conference attended by breast pathologists, imagers, 
and surgeons to develop a consensus management recommendation to either excise the papilloma or to follow with imaging and clinical 
evaluation at 6 month intervals for a minimum of two years. 
Results: A total of 150 core biopsy-diagnosed papilloma cases were prospectively reviewed. Of the 150 cases, 148 were determined to 
have concordant radiologic-pathologic features. 118 of these 148 were benign papillomas of which 39 were excised with no upgrades to 
invasive carcinoma or DCIS. Reasons for surgical excision included patient preference or symptomatic relief (ex: nipple discharge). Of the 
remaining 79 benign papillomas which were not excised, there were no cases of malignancy during follow-up (39-1279 days, mean 531 
days).  Two patients were lost to follow-up within one month of the core biopsy.  Eleven cases revealed atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) 
or atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) adjacent to, but separate from, a benign papilloma. Of these, 6 were excised with 2 upgrades to 
invasive carcinoma or DCIS. In both upgraded cases, ADH bordering on DCIS was noted on the core biopsy; the remaining 5 patients did 
not have evidence of malignancy during follow-up (181-325 days except for one patient was lost to follow-up within 1 month).  The 
remaining 19 of the 150 core biopsies were 17 atypical papillomas (i.e. papillomas containing ADH) and 2 papilloma involved by ALH.  Of 
these, 15 atypical papilloma were surgically excised with 4 upgraded to invasive carcinoma or DCIS; the remaining 4 patients (2 atypical 
papilloma and 2 papilloma involved by ALH) did not show evidence of malignancy during follow-up (105-993 days).  Finally, 2 cases were 
determined rad-path discordant with no upgrade to malignancy at subsequent surgical excision. 
Conclusions: Our data confirm that rad-path concordant benign papillomas diagnosed on image-guided core biopsy can be spared from 
surgery. It also supports the value of a formal multispecialty review of all core biopsy-diagnosed papilloma cases to derive a prospective 
consensus management plan for each case.

Background: Managing high-risk breast lesions following their diagnosis on imaging-guided core biopsy remains controversial. 
Design: Based on more recent publications and our own retrospective data, we developed a high-risk breast conference attended by 
breast pathologists, breast surgeons, and breast imagers to prospectively review each case to arrive at a consensus recommendation to 
either surgically excise or follow on imaging at 6 month intervals for a minimum of two years. 
Results: Between 2015 and 2019, 128 high-risk lesions were discussed. Of these 128 cases, 120 had concordant pathology-radiology 
findings. The remaining 8 patients with discordant pathology-radiology findings underwent excision and 2 were upgraded to carcinoma. Of 
the 120 concordant cases, there were 45 with ADH (3 with concurrent LCIS and 1 with ALH), 13 with LCIS, 23 with ALH, 36 with RS, 2 with 
FEA and 1 with a mucocele-like lesion. Surgical excision was recommended for cases of ADH when there were >2 ADH foci or <90% of 
the calcifications were removed at core biopsy or there was severe nuclear atypia or punctate necrosis. Surgical excision of ALH and LCIS 
was recommended when there were >2 foci or calcifications were present within the ALH or LCIS. For cases of RS, excision was 
recommended when it was estimated less than half of the lesion was sampled. Based on these criteria, we recommended to excise 27 of 
the 45 ADH cases and of these, 9 were upgraded to carcinoma.  Seven of the 13 with LCIS were recommended for surgery with one 
 
 
205 
upgrade to invasive lobular carcinoma. Three of 23 with ALH and 9 of 36 with RS were recommended for excision with none upgraded. An 
additional 4 patients with ADH, 1 with LCIS, 1 with ALH, and 4 with RS underwent voluntary surgery and none were upgraded. All other 
patients (14 with ADH, 5 LCIS, 4 ALH, 23 RS, 2FEA and 1 mucocele –like lesion) were followed with imaging every 6 months and none 
have had any evidence of malignancy (32-1389 days, mean 624 days). 
Conclusions: This prospective study indicates that high risk lesions can be successfully triaged to surgery versus observation if rigorous 
radiologic-pathologic correlation is performed with establishment of pre-defined firm guidelines. High-risk case conference attended by 
breast pathologists, surgeons, and radiologists is an effective means of reaching consensus on the management of all high-risk lesions 
sampled in our institution.

Background: Although microglandular adenosis (MGA) of the breast is regarded as a benign lesion, a few studies investigating the genetic 
landscape of MGA and associated invasive carcinomas have provided evidence into its neoplastic potential.  Identical somatic mutations, 
most frequently in TP53, and similar patterns of chromosomal alterations have been reported in MGA and associated invasive carcinomas. 
In addition, mutations in PI3K pathway-related genes (PTEN, PIK3CA, and INPP4B) and tyrosine kinase receptor signaling-related genes 
(ERBB3 and FGFR2) have been implicated in TP53 wild-type MGA. We report the clinicopathological and genomic features of four 
additional cases of MGA with associated invasive carcinoma. 
Design: A pathology database search for MGA revealed four cases; three cases had associated invasive carcinoma. Areas of MGA and 
invasive carcinoma from each case were dissected and subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) for somatic mutations on the 50-
gene AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 on the Ion Torrent PGM (318 chip) and single nucleotide polymorphism-based chromosomal 
microarray analysis (CMA) using the Oncoscan FFPE Assay Kit (Affymetrix, ThermoFisher) to assess the tissue for copy number changes 
and copy neutral loss of heterozygosity across the entire genome. 
Results: Results are presented in table 1. Two cases (1 and 2) of MGA were intimately associated with high grade, triple-negative invasive 
carcinomas with matrix production. CMA of these tumors revealed similar profiles with high levels of genomic instability across the entire 
genome in the MGA and invasive carcinoma components. NGS revealed co-occurring somatic mutations in TP53 and PI3K pathway-
related genes in the invasive carcinoma in case 1. Case 2 had identical TP53 stopgain mutations in the MGA and invasive components. In 
contrast, the low-grade, triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma and associated MGA in case 3 were significantly less complex and more 
genomically stable. Case 4 contained a microscopic focus of MGA discovered incidentally in reduction tissue removed from a patient with 
an ER-positive invasive lobular carcinoma in a different quadrant; the MGA showed a normal CMA profile and a single somatic mutation 
in PIK3CA.

Background: MET encodes for the receptor tyrosine kinase c-MET. MET gene amplification and exon 14 skipping mutations are found in a 
small subset of human cancers, and have been shown to constitute useful therapeutic targets in non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell 
carcinoma. Here we sought to determine the frequency of potentially targetable MET genetic alterations in breast cancers (BCs) and 
characterize the clinicopathologic features of BCs with MET alterations. 
Design: We retrospectively queried 5,575 BCs previously analyzed by clinical MSK-IMPACT targeted sequencing and investigated the 
presence of MET gene amplification and exon 14 skipping mutations. A central histopathologic review of BCs found to harbor the 
aforementioned genetic alterations was conducted. Clinical characteristics and estrogen receptor (ER)/HER2 status determined as per the 
ASCO/CAP guidelines were retrieved from the clinical records. 
 
 
207 
Results: Of the BCs interrogated, 0.2% (n=10) harbored MET gene amplification including 3 primary BCs (p-BCs) and 7 metastatic BCs 
(m-BCs). No BCs harboring MET exon 14 skipping mutations were identified. The median age of the patients was 53 years (range, 38-72). 
The p-BCs included two invasive ductal carcinomas of no special type (IDC-NSTs) and 1 metaplastic breast cancer with predominant 
chondroid component, all of histologic grade 3. Two p-BCs were ER-negative/HER2-negative and one was ER-positive/HER2-negative, 
and all of them harbored TP53 somatic mutations. The MET-amplified m-BCs included 5 IDC-NSTs (67%), one metaplastic breast cancer 
with a predominant chondroid component and one pleomorphic lobular carcinoma. All m-BCs were poorly differentiated, 3/7 were ER-
negative/HER2-negative (43%), 2/7 were ER-positive/HER2-negative (29%), 1/7 was ER-positive/HER2-positive and 1/7 was ER-
negative/HER2-positive. Metastatic sites included pleura (2/7), liver (2/7), lymph node (1/7), skin (1/7) and bone (1/7). Consistent with the 
findings in MET-amplified p-BCs, the only gene recurrently mutated in MET-amplified m-BCs was TP53. 
Conclusions: MET gene amplification is remarkably rare in BCs. MET-amplified BC is phenotypically heterogeneous, but appears to be 
enriched in high-grade ER-negative/HER2-negative phenotype harboring TP53 mutations. 
213 Duct vs. Lobule: Is Location a Useful Feature in Breast Cores with Low Grade Ductal Proliferations?

Disclosures: Kiran Manjee: None; Megan Sullivan: None 
Background: Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and grade 1 ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) share many architectural and cytologic 
features and differentiating the two can be challenging on core biopsy (CB). When either is diagnosed on CB, the next step is surgical 
excision (EX). However, patients with DCIS often undergo radiotherapy and hormonal therapy, regardless of the excision findings. This 
difference in treatment makes interpretation of the CB especially important. In this study we examined whether the location of atypia could 
be a useful diagnostic feature. 
Design: The database was searched for CB diagnosis (DX) of ADH or DCIS. Patients with ipsilateral breast cancer, MRI or US guided CB 
and unavailable EX were excluded. A pathologist blind to the EX DX reviewed slides for 138 CB. 16 cases were excluded for not meeting 
criteria for ADH/DCIS or unavailable slides. 122 patients’ CB were classified into 3 categories based on the original and reviewed DX. 
Category 1 is concordant ADH (both DX ADH). Three types of CB fall into category 2: CB DX as “ADH bordering DCIS”, CB with different 
original and review DX and patients with 2 ADH CB in one breast.  Category 3 is concordant DCIS (both DX DCIS). Features 
evaluated included location [ductal (D), lobular (L) or mixed (DL)], # of foci and architectural patterns. The results were correlated with the 
EX; DCIS or invasion is considered an upgrade. 
Results: While the average # of foci was similar, the L predominant pattern was seen most often in category 1 while all category 3 CB 
were D predominant (Table 1).  Regardless of category, 8/56 L predominant CB were upgraded (14%) while 9/30 D predominant CB were 
upgraded (30%). The majority of upgrades had a cribriform component (22/27; 81%). Of 8 L predominant upgrades, 7 (87%) had a 
cribriform pattern; only one was micropapillary. Category 2 encompassed the challenging cases. Of 15 borderline CBs, 1 upgrade was L 
predominant. 10 CB were discordant (original and reviewed DX differed) and no upgrades were L predominant.

Conclusions: ADH vs. DCIS is a common dilemma and location may be a helpful feature. CB with a consensus DX of ADH were more 
likely to be L predominant and had a lower upgrade rate. The upgrade rate for D predominant ADH was twice than that of L predominant 
ADH. L predominant cases with cribriforming were more likely to be upgraded.  In discordant CB, none of the L predominant cases were 
upgraded. Our data suggests that CB with L predominant atypia are best classified as ADH.

Background: Approximately, 25% of the female cancer cases in India are breast cancer (BC). Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the 
most aggressive form. The evaluation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in BC is gaining importance. High levels of Tregs in the tumor 
microenvironment are associated with poor prognosis in many cancers. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a protein that inhibits the 
immune response through interaction with receptor PD-1 expressed on T cells. Thes aims of this study were to assess the influence of 
TILs, Tregs and PDL1 expression in TNBCs and correlate these with known prognostic markers and survival.  
Design: 100 cases of TNBC were used. Follow up data of these patients with regards to distant metastasis, recurrence or death were 
retrieved from records to obtain survival & outcome parameters. H&E slides were evaluated for stromal TILs. Immunohistochemistry for 
PDL1 & Foxp3 were performed in all cases. Correlations of Clinico-pathological parameters were done with TILs, PDL-1, and FOXP3 
expression. Survival data were also correlated with TILs, PDL-1 and FOXP3. Correlations were done with the response to chemotherapy. 
Kaplan-Meier time to event survival analysis was carried out to see the effect of subtypes on survival and recurrence of death among 
patients. 
Results: 93% were invasive ductal carcinomas NST. 48% of cases were early BC, 24% were locally advanced BC and 28% were 
metastatic BC. 36% had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy the path-CR rate of 22.22%. There was a significant correlation between the 
level of TILs and tumor size, lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, anatomic staging, and prognostic staging. High level of TILs 
(>40%) were associated with improved overall survival (OS). There was a significant correction between FOXP3 on TILs and anatomic and 
prognostic staging. Higher FOXP3 level was associated with reduced overall survival. PDL-1 positivity on tumor cell was associated with 
higher anatomic and prognostic staging. There was a significant correlation between PDL-1 on lymphocytes and anatomic staging, 
prognostic staging, tumor size & OS.

Figure 2 - 214 
 
Conclusions: A higher level of TILs was associated with lower stage, lower tumor size, absence of lymph node metastases, decreased 
distant metastasis & improved OS. Higher FOXP3 T regs were also associated with higher anatomic and prognostic staging. PDL-1 
expression on both tumor cells and lymphocytes was associated with higher stage, decreased OS and poor clinical outcome.

Background: Patients with metastatic breast carcinoma (MBC) who fail first line therapies may have limited options. Molecular sequencing 
can provide information to guide salvage therapies. Our study aim was to describe the whole-exome sequencing (WES) profile of MBC 
from patients enrolled in our Precision Oncology program, with an emphasis in alterations on pathways that may have therapeutic 
ramifications. 
Design: WES was performed on tumor/matched germline DNA pairs from patients with MBC. Our WES test allows for assessment of 
>21,000 genes through the development and implementation of established computational pipelines for simultaneous detection of somatic 
point/indel mutations and copy-number alterations (CNAs). 
Results: The cohort was 27 cases of MBC from 24 patients including 12 cases of regional or axillary lymph node metastases and 15 cases 
of distant metastases (liver, bone, brain, pleura, skin, soft tissue). The biomarker tumor profile by IHC was 18 (67%) ER+, 17 (63%) PR+, 5 
(19%) HER2+ and 4 (15%) were triple negative. 25 (93%) were ductal, 1 (4%) lobular and 1 (4%) was metaplastic carcinoma. 12 patients 
(50%) had somatic alterations in 10 clinically relevant genes including BRCA1, FGFR1, FGFR2, PIK3CA, FGFR2, ERBB2, KIT, PTEN, 
AURKA, SMO and AKT1. (Fig. 1). 2 patients were considered extreme responders. 
The most frequent alterations were TP53 (9/24, 39%) and PIK3CA (4/24, 17%).  Other frequent alterations involved ERBB2 (5/22, 3 
amplifications, 2 activating mutations). 2 (8%) cases had high tumor mutational burden (>12 mutations per Mb). Based on inclusion criteria, 
10 (42%) patients would be eligible for enrollment in molecularly driven clinical trials. Further analysis showed that 9 (38%) MBC had 
alterations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (17 genes), 11 (46%) in the cell cycle control (34 genes), 7 (29%) in the Notch signaling 
pathway (55 genes), 2 (8%) in the AR signaling pathway (10 genes), 1 (4%) in folate transport (5 genes), and 4 (17%) in DNA damage 
response (12 genes). 3 of the latter were germline variants (two BRCA2 and one ATM) (Fig. 2). Overall, 19 (79%) patients had molecular 
 
 
210 
profiles with potential therapeutic ramifications, including tumor susceptibility to PARP inhibitors or immunotherapy. No cases with 
microsatellite instability (MSI) were detected by MSI Sensor. 
Figure 1 - 215 
 
Figure 2 - 215 
 
Conclusions: While targeted panels are paramount, routine WES including TMB and MSI scores, and somatic and germline analysis, may 
be informative on pathway alterations that could provide clinical benefit.

Background: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype with an aggressive behavior and with no available molecular targets. It 
occurs most often in pre-menopausal African American and Hispanic/Latino women. In Colombia its prevalence has been reported in 
20.6%. Androgen Receptor (AR) belongs to the steroid nuclear receptor family and has been recently considered a potential biomarker for 
breast cancer. Considering the high prevalence of TNBC in Colombian women and the lack of knowledge of AR expression in our patients, 
our aim was to determine the frequency of AR expression and its association with clinic-pathological variables in women diagnosed with 
TNBC at the Colombian National Cancer Institute (INC). 
Design: This study included 149 women diagnosed with TNBC between 2011 and 2014 at the INC. Clinical and pathological data were 
extracted from medical records and pathology reports. Information on hormone receptor status (ER and PR), Ki67 expression and HER2 
was obtained from previous pathology reports, if available. AR expression was considered positive when it exceeded 1% of nuclear 
staining in tumor cells. 
Results: Androgen receptor (AR) expression was detected in 41.6% of the samples using a 1% cutoff. We explored differences in clinic-
pathological variables according to the AR expression (Table 1). We found statistically significant differences in the mean age at diagnosis 
and histology. Patients that expressed AR between 1% and 50% of the receptor were older than patients negative for AR expression 
(60.78 yo vs. 53.78 yo, p = 0.043). A higher number of apocrine carcinomas were found in the group with the highest expression of AR 
compared to the group negative for the expression of the receptor (7.7% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.019). We did not find statistically significant 
differences in Ki67 expression, tumor size, metastasis at diagnosis, nodal stage, surgery, type of surgery, radiotherapy, recurrences and 
 
 
211 
death. The median of overall survival was 2.45 years (Figure 1). We did not find statistically significant differences in overall survival 
according to AR expression (Figure 2).

Conclusions: We found a high expression of AR in our samples from Colombian patients with TNBC (41.6%). We found statistically 
significant differences in AR expression by age at diagnosis and histology and no differences other clinic-pathological variables and

217   Discordance between Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and In Situ Hybridization (ISH) to Detect HER2 
Overexpression/Gene Amplification in Breast Cancer (BC) in the Modern Age

Disclosures: Raima Memon: None; Carlos Prieto-Granada: None; Shuko Harada: None; Thomas Winokur: None; Vishnu Reddy: None; 
Gene Siegal: None; Shi Wei: None 
Background: HER2 gene amplification and/or protein overexpression reportedly occurs in 15-20% of BCs. Accurate detection of HER2 
alteration is critical in predicting response to HER2-targeted therapy. Both IHC and ISH are FDA-approved methods for detecting HER2 
status in BC, as HER2 protein overexpression is largely attributable to gene amplification. IHC is widely used and is the preferred method 
for screening while ISH is typically used as a reflex test on IHC-equivocal (2+) cases. Early studies have indicated that the discordant rates 
between IHC and ISH are up to 9%. In this study, we sought to determine the frequency of HER2 IHC–/ISH+ and IHC+/ISH- BCs in the 
modern age and to investigate the response to HER2-targeted therapy in these patients. 
Design: All consecutive primary and metastatic BCs diagnosed between 01/2015-08/2019 with successful detection of HER2 by both IHC 
and Dual ISH at the authors’ institution were included after IRB approval. Both IHC and ISH were interpreted by breast and molecular 
pathologists based on the 2013 ASCO/CAP HER2 testing guidelines. 
Results: Of the 599 cases included in the study period, 75 (12.5%) were IHC-(2+), of which 11% (8) were ISH+. In the remaining cases, 
there was an overall 97.5% concordance rate between IHC and ISH, including 447 IHC-/ISH- and 64 IHC+/ISH+, respectively. Of the 13 
(2.5%) BCs with discordant IHC/ISH, 5 were IHC-/ISH+ (including 1 metastatic BC) and 8 were IHC+/ISH-, respectively. Five patients (2 
IHC-/ISH+ and 3 IHC+/ISH-) received HER2-targeted therapy at the authors’ institution. Interestingly, one of these patients developed a 
HER2 IHC-/ISH+ distant metastasis from a primary BC with an IHC+/ISH+ phenotype 3 years after a pathologic complete response to 
neoadjuvant cytotoxic and HER2-targeted therapy. The remaining 4 patients were disease free. 
Conclusions: A small subset of BCs show discordant HER2 IHC and ISH results, including IHC-/ISH+ and IHC+/ISH-. Thus, IHC scores of 
3+ and 0/1+ should not be always regarded as positive and negative for HER2, respectively. A complementary test (ISH) is often needed. 
The potential biologic mechanisms driving these findings include nonfunctional amplifications or activating mutations which give rise to 
protein overexpression, while the phenotypic conversion from IHC+/ISH+ to IHC-/ISH+ may reflect tumor heterogeneity or a treatment 
effect. HER2 mutation analysis may provide further insights into the tumor biology of this highly diverse malignancy in the pursuit of 
precision medicine.

Background: Intraductal papillomas (IDPs) comprise 3-6% of breast biopsies diagnoses. IDPs can range from benign to atypical to 
harboring in-situ or invasive carcinoma. Management of benign IDP is controversial and different studies show varying results regarding 
surgical excision versus clinical observation. Our study aims to evaluate risk of malignancy in cases diagnosed as benign IDP on core 
biopsies, risk factors associated with increased risk of malignancy and determine if surgical excision is warranted. 
Design: Our pathology database was searched for IDPs diagnosed on core biopsies (2010-june 2019). Total of 286 cases were identified, 
of which, 178 underwent excision. All patients were females (21-79 years). Clinical/radiologic data was reviewed. 
Results: 202/286 cases were diagnosed benign IDPs on core biopsies. 109/202 underwent excision. 14/109(13%) were upgraded to high-
risk lesions (atypical ductal/lobular hyperplasia). Imaging was available in 13/14; 8/13(61%) of these lesions were found in the central 
breast; 5/13(39%) peripheral. All of these lesions were detected on screening mammography except one which was detected as palpable 
mass. 7/109(6%) were associated with malignancy (ductal/lobular carcinoma in-situ and invasive carcinoma). In 4/7, there was a history 
of(h/o) contralateral(C/L) in-situ or invasive carcinoma; in 2/7, there was a strong clinical suspicion of malignancy; one case with ductal 
carcinoma in-situ was detected on screening mammogram. All these lesions were present either within or adjacent to the papilloma. 84/286 
were diagnosed either as IDP with atypia or had coexisting in-situ/invasive carcinoma in the ipsilateral breast. 65/84 underwent excision at 
our institution. 56/65(86%) showed high-risk/malignant lesions on excision. 
Conclusions: Our study shows that among lesions yielding a benign diagnosis of IDP, excision revealed high-risk lesions in 13% and 
malignancy in 6%. 61% of IDPs that were upgraded to high-risk lesions were located centrally. The likelihood of finding malignant lesion 
was significantly higher in women who presented with suspicious radiologic findings and/or had a h/o C/L breast cancer. We conclude that 
in cases of benign IDPs; personal history of C/L breast cancer, central location and highly suspicious imaging findings may be used as 
 
 
214 
criteria advocating surgical management. In patients diagnosed with peripherally located benign IDPs with no prior personal history of 
cancer, close clinical and radiological surveillance may be appropriate management.

Disclosures: Mitul Modi: None; Ira Bleiweiss: None; Ronald Grenko: None; Shabnam Jaffer: None; Erik Toorens: None; Tapan Ganguly: 
None; Anupma Nayak: None 
Background: SAN, LGASCA and MAC are extremely rare entities that share similar histologic and immunophenotypic features. They differ 
predominantly based on their location and biologic behavior. SAN is a benign tumor with superficial location and no propensity for 
metastasize, whereas LGASCA arises in the breast parenchyma, and is considered a variant of metaplastic carcinoma with potential to 
metastasize to axilla nodes and distantly. MAC is a locally aggressive cutaneous tumor and can metastasize. Given their rarity and 
histologic similarities they impose a diagnostic challenge to a pathologist and hence, we sought to uncover molecular underpinnings of 
these entities. 
Design: A total of 16 cases, including SAN (5), LGASCA (9) & MAC (2) were identified in database (2000-2019). H&E slides and paraffin 
blocks of 7 cases with sufficient tumor [SAN (3), LGASCA (3) and MAC (1)] were retrieved. Diagnosis was confirmed by 2 pathologists. 
Tumor tissue was macrodissected, sequenced & analyzed using AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 covering ∼2800 COSMIC mutations 
across 50 cancer-related genes. 
Results: Molecular findings are summarized in table 1. Variant (VAR) calls were annotated with Annovar and filtered with a custom script 
on several VAR metrics and annotation results. Minimum (MIN) depth of coverage for a VAR was set at 100x, MIN allele frequency at 5%, 
& MIN VAR quality at 20 for SNPs and 30 for indels. VAR occurring in introns/splice sites, synonymous VAR & VAR with a population 
frequency >1% were removed. 1/3 LGASCA samples failed extraction. Of the remaining 2 cases, 1 case showed nonsynonymous SNV 
in PIK3CA (exon21:c.A3140G:p.H1047R). None of 3 SAN cases exhibited genetic alterations. Interestingly, MAC case harbored multiple 
pathogenic genetic aberrations, in KDR, FBXW7, JAK2, CDKN2A, TP53. Of note, this patient died due to multiple other comorbidities. The 
remaining 6 patients of LGASCA and SAN are alive.

Conclusions: One case of LGASCA showed PIK3CA gene mutation, while none of the SAN cases showed any genetic alterations. This 
subtle finding could be very helpful & in turn can help delineating LGASCA from SAN, rather diagnosing them based on their location. 
Furthermore, MAC harbored multiple genetic aberrations (KDR, FBXW7, JAK2, CDKN2A, TP53) conforming with its aggressive behavior. 
Molecular analysis on these rare tumors with identical histomorphology can help predicting biological behavior and can potentially assist in 
defining these lesions.

Disclosures: Ioana Moisini: None; Huina Zhang: None; David Hicks: None; Bradley Turner: None 
Background: L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) is a 200-220 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily, 
involved in neurogenesis, cell-cell interaction, synaptogenesis, myelination, and neuron survival. L1CAM is associated with poor prognosis 
in many carcinomas and has been proposed to be a strong prognostic factor in endometrial carcinoma; however, little is known about its 
expression and prognostic value in breast cancer. Triple-negative breast carcinomas have been suggested to overexpress L1CAM, 
associated with shorter disease-free and overall survival. Our goal is to evaluate the role of L1CAM in recurrence and metastasis of ER 
positive/Her-2 negative breast carcinomas.  
Design: A retrospective search of the pathology database at the University of Rochester Medical Center between January 2008-December 
2015 was performed to identify patients with recurrent ER positive/Her-2 negative breast carcinomas. 152 cases fulfilling these criteria were 
eligible. The control group included 152 cases of ER positive/Her-2 negative breast carcinomas that did not recur. Ki-67 was available in 
115 cases. 36 cases (31.5%) were luminal A subtype (Ki-67 <14%), and 79 cases (68.5%) were luminal B subtype (Ki-67 ≥ 14%). Time of 
recurrence ranged from 1-14 years, with the predominant sites including ipsilateral or contralateral breast, chest wall, liver, lung, and bone. 
Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues using the L1 mAb clone. Based on previous 
literature, L1CAM expression of ≥10% is considered positive. All L1CAM positive cases received adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal 
therapy, with negative surgical margins. 
Results: L1CAM expression was found to be highly specific for recurrence (Table 1), with significant expression of L1CAM in patients that 
recurred compared to the control group (RR 2.048, p < 0.05). None of the 152 cases in the control group had positive L1CAM expression. 
Seven of the 152 cases that recurred had positive L1CAM expression; all of them were luminal B subtypes, with a Ki-67 proliferation index 
between 30% and 80%. Luminal B subtypes with positive L1CAM expression were more likely to have a higher Ki-67 expression than 
luminal B subtypes negative for L1CAM.

those with higher Ki-67 expression. Additional studies with larger populations are needed to further validate these results.

Disclosures: Maria Niveiro: None; Elena Castellon-Molla: None; Gloria Peiro: None 
Background: B7 immune checkpoints are transmembrane proteins that regulate T cells via co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory signals. The 
best-known co-inhibitory molecules are PD1, PDL1, PDL2, CD276 and CTLA4, whose deregulation in neoplastic cells can lead to the 
evasion of the immune response. In fact, recent studies have related these molecules to tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis in 
different neoplasias. In breast carcinoma (BC) the correlation of these genes expression levels with clinicopathological features has not 
been studied extensively. 
Design: We analyzed the mRNA expression of PD1, PDL1, PDL2, CD276 and CTLA-4 genes in a series of non-consecutive BC (n=150) 
including: Luminal A (25%), Luminal B/HER2- (23%), Luminal B/HER2+ (25%), HER2-enriched (8%) and Triple-Negative/Buasal-like 
(TN/BL) (19%). Analysis was performed by qRT-PCR using TaqMan® probes, using PUM1 and β-actin as reference genes, and a pool of 
mRNA from healthy breast tissue as reference calibrator. Relative changes in gene expression were calculated as the fold-change by the 
 
 
217 
2–ΔΔCt method. Results were correlated with clinicopathological factors (age, tumor size, histological grade, lymph-vascular invasion, 
necrosis, immunophenotype, lymph-node and estrogen receptor –ER- status) using the χ2 test. 
Results: Patients’ age average was 57 years old (range 32-94 years). Tumors showed predominantly histological grade 3 (51.3%), no 
necrosis (80%) or vascular invasion (64%), and lymph-node positive status (60%). Satisfactory expression in all genes was observed in 
142 (94.7%) tumors. A positive correlation was found between the gene expression (p<0.02), except for CD276-PD1 and CD276-
CTLA4 (p=0.47 and p=0.62, respectively). High PD1 mRNA levels correlated with lymph-node positive status (p=0.017), 
whereas PDL2 and CD276 with no vascular invasion (both p<0.018), and CTLA4 expression r in ER-negative tumors (p=0.001). Grade 3 
tumors showed increased levels of PDL2 and CTLA4 (p=0.05 and p=0.001, respectively). However, there was no association 
between PDL1 expression and clinicopathological factors (all p>0.05). 
Conclusions: Our results in a clinical series of patients with BC show that PD1 and CTLA4 are associated with poor prognostic 
parameters, consistent with their co-inhibitory function of the immune response. Conversely, high CD276 and PDL2 mRNA expression may 
act as good prognostic biomarkers, specifically PDL2 in a subset of high grade tumors.

Background: Cystic hypersecretory carcinoma in situ (CHCis) is a rare form of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) involving cystically dilated 
ducts with luminal eosinophilic colloid-like secretions. Molecular characterization of CHCis has not been reported and it is not clear if this 
distinct histology has characteristic genetic drivers. We profiled 8 CHCis cases, including 1 which recurred 2 years later with 
morphologically similar invasive carcinoma, by capture-based next generation sequencing (NGS) to determine whether these tumors have 
shared genomic alterations. 
Design: Clinicopathologic data was collected for 8 patients. DNA was separately extracted for sequencing from 8 CHCis, matched normal 
tissue for 7 cases, and 1 recurrent invasive carcinoma. NGS targeted exons of 479 cancer genes, 40 introns and 
the TERT promoter. Single nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions and copy number alterations (CNA) were evaluated. 
Results: Seven patients were female and one was male; the average age was 56 years old (range 37-69). One-half presented with an 
abnormality on screening mammogram (4/8 including 2 for calcifications and 2 for masses), followed by palpable mass (3/8), and bloody 
nipple discharge with palpable mass (1/8). CHCis size ranged from 1.9 to 12 cm (mean 4.6). Nuclear grade was intermediate (6/8) or high 
(2/8) with comedonecrosis (4/8) or single cell necrosis (1/8). Six cases were ER positive. Pathogenic genomic alterations were detected in 
all cases. Alterations were identified in the ERBB2/ERBB3/PIK3CA/AKT1 pathway (5/8), chromatin modifiers (4/8), GATA3 (2/8) 
and TP53 (2/8). TP53 mutations were exclusive to cases with high nuclear grade. ER-negative CHCis had 
either ERBB2 or ERBB3 mutation. Recurrent CNA included gains of chromosome 1q (5/8) and distal 17q (4/8), as reported in conventional 
DCIS. The in situ and recurrent invasive carcinoma harbored shared aberrations.

223 Inter-Observer Variability in the Reporting of Extranodal Extension in Metastatic Breast Carcinoma: 
Results of an International Survey of Breast Pathologists

Disclosures: Michael Moravek: None; Gabriela Oprea-Ilies: None; Stefan Pambuccian: None 
Background: Lymph node metastasis is the single most important prognostic factor for breast cancer patients. In addition to the number of 
positive nodes and the size of the largest metastatic focus, the presence of extranodal extension has been added to the pathology report 
template in many institutions. Extranodal extension (ENE) is defined as tumor cells penetrating through the lymph node capsule into the 
peri-nodal tissue. 
In the 2016 AJCC staging manual and the August 2019 version of the CAP staging synoptic reporting template, the reporting of the 
presence but not of the extent of extranodal extension is a required component. Recently, clinicians in an increasing number of institutions 
require pathologists report the extent of ENE to guide their management decision. The CAP protocol lists the extent of ENE as an optional 
data element; however, there is currently no consensus guideline specifying how to measure ENE for axillary nodes involved by breast 
cancer, and studies reported in the literature have used various ways of measuring ENE. 
Design: A web-based survey containing 21 questions, 8 of which regarded microphotographs depicting lymph node sections, was 
distributed to an international group of breast pathologists that had published breast cancer associated research during last 10 years. 
Questions regarding the presence/absence of ENE, the reporting of micrometastasis versus macrometastasis in the presence of ENE, the 
method of measuring ENE, and demographical questions were included. 
 
 
219 
Results: A total of 65 responses were received. Responses showed that 71% of respondents had been practicing breast pathology for at 
least 10 years. The majority of respondents (62%) reported signing out breast pathology exclusively or almost exclusively. Overall, the 
results of the survey demonstrated marked interobserver variability regarding the presence of ENE and the method of reporting the extent 
of ENE. The questions that had most disagreement were related to the distinction between afferent lymphatic invasion and ENE, and the 
method of measuring ENE extent and the diagnosis of micrometastasis with ENE. Responses to selected questions are shown in figures 1 
and 2. 
Figure 1 - 223 
 
Figure 2 - 223 
 
Conclusions: The results of this survey uncovered marked variability in the diagnosis of ENE and the reporting of its extent. Since the 
different methods of measuring ENE may result in differences in extent considered clinically significant (>2mm or <2mm), our findings 
demonstrate the urgent need for standardization of ENE reporting.

224 Unveiling the Histopathologic Spectrum of MRI-Guided Breast Biopsies: An Institutional 
Pathological-Radiological Correlation

Disclosures: Gustavo Moreno: None; Julie Jorns: None 
Background: MRI-guided breast biopsy has become a common adjunct in pre-surgical breast cancer work-up, is a preferred radiological 
technique for evaluation of indeterminate/suspicious breast abnormalities not readily visualized by conventional imaging and may be used 
in screening of high-risk women. No specific MRI radiologic finding definitively separates benign and malignant breast lesions; however, 
regional non-mass enhancement (NME) is suggestive of benign (NPV, 92%) and regional mass enhancement (ME) of malignant (PPV, 
81%) etiology. Pathological-radiological MRI concordance literature is scant and inconsistent. Our goal was to evaluate the correlation 
between pathology proven benign and malignant lesions and MRI NME/ME lesions. 
Design: Retrospective database search (1/18-12/18) was used to identify breast core biopsies from 3 hospitals that comprise our 
institution. Clinicopathologic features were assessed by chart and slide review. Biopsies were categorized by radiological finding (NME or 
ME) and into 9 benign, 1 atypical and 2 malignant pathologic groups. 
Results: 2909 breast biopsies were reviewed, 232 (8%) of which were MRI-guided (figure 1). The majority of MRI biopsies were done for 
concurrent cancer or in evaluation of a suspicious lesion (184, 79.3%) and 48 (20.7%) for screening. Mean age was younger for MRI (52 
yrs vs overall mean age of 56 yrs) and youngest for the subgroup undergoing MRI for screening (mean age 45 yrs). MRI finding was: 121 
(52.2%) NME and 111 (47.8%) ME. Pathology was: 171 (73.7%) benign, 34 (14.6%) malignant and 27 (11.6%) atypia. The most common 
lesion seen as NME was clustered cysts with papillary apocrine metaplasia (23, 9.9%) and the most common ME lesion was fibrocystic 
changes NOS (29, 12.5%); however, a spectrum of pathology was seen for both NME and ME (table 1, figure 1). NME correlated with 
benign pathology, with a negative predictive value of 82.57% (similar to available literature). However, ME correlated poorly with malignant 
pathology, with a positive predictive value of 15.62%.

Disclosures: Sarah Morgan: None; Jessie Wu: None; James Cotton: None; Gulisa Turashvili: None 
Background: Solid papillary carcinoma (SPC) and encapsulated papillary carcinoma (EPC) are rare and poorly understood subtypes of 
papillary carcinoma with distinct features and diagnostic challenges. Despite the lack of myoepithelial cells similar to invasive, EPC and 
SPC are considered in situ lesions based on favorable clinical outcomes. We aimed to describe clinical-pathological features including 
basement membrane (BM) studies in these tumors. 
Design: We retrospectively identified specimens with diagnosis of SPC or EPC in 2000-2019. Histology slides were reviewed and clinical-
pathologic variables were recorded. Immunohistochemical stains for BM (collagen IV) and myoepithelial (p63, SMM) markers were 
performed.  
 
 
222 
Results: The cohort consists of 23 SPCs and 27 EPCs. Surgical procedures included 5 total mastectomies (TM) and 18 breast-conserving 
surgeries (BCS) for SPC, and 4 TM and 23 BCS for EPC. All patients were female except 1 male patient with SPC. The median age was 
71 years (49-93). Clinical presentations included mass in 19 cases and nipple retraction/discharge in 5 cases. Of 23 SPCs, 2 (21.7%) were 
pure SPC, 4(17.4%) associated with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 6 (26.1%) with invasive carcinoma (5 invasive ductal carcinoma no 
special type (IDC NST), 1 mucinous carcinoma), while 8 (34.8%) were considered invasive due to infiltrative growth. Of 27 EPC patients, 9 
(33.3%) were pure EPC, 12 (44.4%) associated with DCIS, and 6 (22.3%) with IDC. The median tumor size was 1.4 cm (0.1-16) and 2.2 
cm (0.7-5.9) for invasive and in situ lesions, respectively. All tumors were positive for hormone receptors and negative for HER2. 
Myoepithelial cells were absent in 20 cases and focally present in 30 cases. Collagen IV was absent in all invasive lesions but present in all 
EPCs and 20 SPCs, including invasive SPC. Of 26 patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, 1 patient with EPC+IDC had a 
positive node. Of 31 patients with available follow-up (median 35 months, 1-85), 1 SPC (4.3%) and 1 EPC (3.7%), both associated with 
IDC, developed local recurrence. No distant recurrence or deaths were observed.  
Conclusions: Our study confirms that SPC and EPC are special types of breast cancer with low (4%) recurrence rates. SPC is more 
commonly associated with invasive carcinoma or considered invasive compared to EPC (61% vs 22%). The presence of BM material in 
most cases indicates that these tumors may represent in situ lesions evolving into low-grade invasive malignancy.

Background: Positive surgical resection margins has been a long-standing issue in breast-conserving surgery and is the leading cause for 
re-excision procedures. Currently, faxitron imaging is the most commonly employed method of intra-operative surgical margin assessment. 
However, this method of assessment is subject to limitations such as workflow interruption or suboptimal sensitivity for positive margin 
detection.  3D imaging experiments with lumpectomy specimens show that invasive carcinoma as well is microcalcifications can be clearly 
visualized. In this study we use volumetric tomographic images to assess tumor dimensions and surgical margin status and correlate the 
findings with the final histopathology. 
Design: We performed high resolution tomographic images of 17 lumpectomy specimens before the specimens were grossed or triaged. A 
breast radiologist reviewed the images without knowledge of the pathologic findings. The distance of the tumor or microcalcifications was 
assessed and recorded. A surgical margin was considered positive if microcalcifications or tumor were present within 1.0 mm from any 
surgical margin. Each of the six surgical margins was assessed separately. The results were than correlated with the histopathologic 
findings. 
Results: Results show that with the volumetric images, the radiologist was able to achieve 100% sensitivity and 92% specificity for 
identifying positive margins. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the volumetric imaging device can yield high-resolution 3D images of 
lumpectomy specimens within a clinically acceptable timeframe, thus can potentially be used for intra-operative margin assessment. 
There were a total of 102 surgical margins assessed (6x17). 
3D imaging identified 13/13 positive surgical margins. 
3D imaging identified 86/95 negative surgical margins. 
Conclusions: We demonstrated that the volumetric imaging shows high correlation with histopathology in terms of surgical margin 
assessment and may potentially be useful in the gross room or surgical site for intra-operative assessment of surgical margins.

Disclosures: Patrick Mullane: None; Marina Mosunjac: None; George Birdsong: None; Uma Krishnamurti: None 
Background: Oncotype DX (ODX) is a commercial genetic assay used to predict the risk of breast cancer (BC) recurrence. However, its 
cost is a financial burden for patients and hospitals with limited financial resources. “Magee equation 2” (ME2) is a linear regression 
analysis designed as a free alternative tool to ODX using only standard histopathologic factors and predictive markers routinely reported in 
 
 
223 
BC pathology reports (tumor size, Nottingham score, ER, PR, and HER2 status). Here, we compare ODX with ME2 recurrence scores in 
patients at an urban public hospital. 
Design: 106 patients with ER positive BC with available ODX reports and prerequisite histopathologic data were reviewed. ME2 results 
were calculated using the UPMC calculation https://path.upmc.edu/onlineTools/mageeequations.html. Scores were grouped into three risk 
categories: 0<18 (low), 18 to < 31 (intermediate), and > 31 (high). Concordance and Pearson correlation calculations were performed for 
comparisons. 
Results: Overall concordance between ODX and ME2 was 51.5% with a correlation of 0.58. The concordance for low, intermediate, and 
high risk groups was 72%, 37%, and 22%, respectively. There was no two-step discordance between ME2 and ODX. All ME2 high risk 
scores were also ODX high risk. ME2 had a higher proportion of intermediate score cases (51 vs. 33).  ME2 scores were lower than ODX 
in cases of ER/PR discordance and grade 1 tumors, while they were higher in larger T2/T3 tumors and in smaller grade 3 
tumors.  Concordance of ODX and IHC/FISH analysis for ER, PR, and HER2 status was 96%, 86%, and 93%, respectively. 4 ER 
discrepant cases were only IHC+; of 15 PR discrepant cases, 12 were only IHC+ and 3 were only ODX+. Of 7 HER2 discrepant cases, 4 
were IHC+ and 3 were IHC and FISH equivocal. 
Conclusions: Our cohort demonstrated good correlation between ODX and ME2 scores. Concordance was highest in low risk groups, and 
all ME2 high risk cases were ODX concordant. Although infrequent, IHC was more sensitive for ER/PR status and disagreement on this 
was associated with discordant risk group classification. These findings demonstrate ME2 intermediate risk score cases can be selectively 
sent for additional ODX testing. Such a practice would be cost saving without compromising clinical care. 
228 Utility of HER2 Immunohistochemistry in Clarifying HER2 Status in Breast Cancer with HER2:CEP17 
Ratio <2 and Average >/= 4.0 and <6.0 HER2 Signals per Tumor Cell by Fluorescence in-situ 
Hybridization (Focused Update Group 4)

Disclosures: Kristen Muller: None; Jonathan Marotti: None; Laura Tafe: None 
Background: In May 2018, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) published a clinical 
practice guideline focused update on Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) testing in breast cancer (PMID: 29846104). 
Prior to this update, breast cancers with an average of >4.0 and <6.0 HER2 signals per tumor cell and a HER2/CEP17 ratio <2.0 were 
classified as ISH “Equivocal” for HER2. Per the 2018 guideline update, additional workup with HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) is 
recommended to arrive at a definitive HER2 status for tumors falling within this category (“group 4”). 
Design: The aim of our study was to investigate the utility of HER2 IHC in the evaluation of breast tumors with group 4 HER2 ISH results: 
tumors with an average of >4.0 and <6.0 HER2 signals per tumor cell and a HER2/CEP17 ratio <2.0. Our lab uses dual-probe FISH as the 
primary method for determining HER2 status on all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. All invasive breast cancers that underwent 
HER2 FISH testing from 5/2018 - 9/2019 were included. HER2 FISH and IHC was interpreted according to the ASCO/CAP 2018 
guidelines. 
Results: Of 613 breast tumors tested with HER2 FISH, 26 (4.2%) were categorized as group 4 (mean HER2 ratio = 1.5 ± 0.2 with 4.6 ± 0.5 
average HER2 signals per cell). The majority of cancers were intermediate and high grade (96%), ER-positive (88%) invasive ductal 
carcinomas (88%). The subsequent HER2 IHC result were as follows: equivocal (IHC 2+) in the majority (n=24) and negative (IHC 1+) in 
one single case. The remaining case showed HER2 heterogeneity on the biopsy with <10% HER2-positive cells; repeat HER2 on the 
excision specimen confirmed positive HER2 status. Per guidelines, cases with 2+ HER2 IHC were reported as “Negative” with a comment. 
None of the patients received treatment with an anti-HER2 agent. Oncotype DX was performed on 12 cases, per oncologist request: HER2 
was reported as “Negative” in 11 and “Equivocal” in one. HER2 FISH and IHC was repeated on nine subsequent excision specimens; 
however, this did not reclassify HER2 status, except in the single aforementioned case with heterogeneity. 
Conclusions: Unless HER2 heterogeneity was present, the HER2 IHC was equivocal in all group 4 cases. These results suggest that 
adding IHC likely doesn’t contribute to the HER2 classification of group 4 breast tumors, and perhaps such cases should be considered 
“Negative” based on the initial FISH results.

Background: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a main component of deep learning modules, and have been widely employed to 
analyze visual imagery. They have achieved physician-level accuracy at a broad variety of diagnostic tasks. The distinction between 
cellular fibroadenoma and phyllodes tumor frequently poses a diagnostic challenge to practicing surgical pathologists.  In this study we aim 
to investigate the use of CNNs to classify fibroepithelial lesions with a focus on cellular fibroadenomas. 
Design: Whole slide image scanning was done on all glass slides of 180 fibroepithelial lesion cases (46 benign phyllodes tumors, 27 
borderline phyllodes tumors, 24 malignant phyllodes tumors, 31 fibroadenomas with high cellularity, 43 fibroadenomas with moderate 
cellularity and 9 fibroadenomas with low cellularity). 20 images from each case were taken.  Eighty percent of the cases from each 
category were used to train the model using transfer learning on Inception V3 through TensorFlow.  Twenty percent of the cases from each 
category were separated as a test group, and not used in the training process: 50 images each from 5 cases per category (benign, 
borderline and malignant phyllodes tumor and fibroadenoma with high cellularity), and 50 images from 8 cases of fibroadenomas with 
moderate cellularity. The test-set images were subsequently classified by the trained model in a binary fashion (fibroadenoma vs. phyllodes 
tumor). Sensitivity and specificity were used to quantify the performance of the CNN as diagnostic test differentiating cellular 
fibroadenomas vs other categories. 
Results: The model had a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 62% in recognizing malignant phyllodes tumors vs. fibroadenomas with high 
cellularity. Comparing borderline phyllodes tumors vs. fibroadenomas with high cellularity, sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 62%. 
Lastly, benign phyllodes tumors vs. fibroadenomas with high cellularity resulted in a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 62%. 
Conclusions: The CNN was able to differentiate malignant and borderline phyllodes tumors from cellular fibroadenomas with high 
sensitivity. Sensitivity was; however, moderate in differentiating benign phyllodes tumors from cellular fibroadenomas. Additionally, the 
specificity achieved in differentiating cellular fibroadenomas from all phyllodes tumor categories was moderate. 
230 Overexpression of α-Methylacyl-CoA Racemase (AMACR) in Apocrine Carcinomas of Breast 
Harumi Nakamura, Osaka International Cancer Institute, Osaka, Japan 
Disclosures: Harumi Nakamura: None 
Background: α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), also known as P504S, plays an important role in mitochondorial and peroxisomal 
beta-oxidation of branched-chain fatty acid. Overexpression of AMACR is highly sensitive and specific marker for prostatic carcinoma and 
the antibody of AMACR is widely used. In apocrine carcinoma of the breast, increase in mitochondria and overexpression of the genes 
related to lipid metabolism are known. We investigated the utility of AMACR antibody for differential diagnosis of apocrine carcinoma and 
the condition of mRNA level of AMACR in apocrine carcinoma for therapeutic application. 
Design: In this study, we investigated expression of AMACR protein in 67 breast carcinomas (23 apocrine carcinomas, 10 apocrine ductal 
carcinomas in situ (DCIS), and 34 non-apocrine carcinomas) and 5 apocrine metaplasia of normal breast tissue by immunohistochemical 
analysis. Conveniently, the scoring used Allred score: Total score (TS) = Proportion score (PS) + Intensity score (IS). mRNA levels of 
AMACR in 5 apocrine carcinomas showing high expression of AMACR protein (TS8) and 5 non-apocrine carcinomas showing no 
expression of AMACAR protein (TS0) were assessed by microdissection and real time PCR (RT-PCR). 
Results: Immunohistochemical analysis using a monoclonal antibody for AMACR (P504S) demonstrated that high TS (7 or 8) of AMACR 
was present in 12 of 23 (52.2%) of apocrine carcinomas and in 7 of 10 (70.0%) of apocrine DCISs, and there was no AMACR negative 
case. In addition, benign apocrine metaplasia was also positive for AMACR. No expressing AMACR was in normal ducts and lobules. 
Twenty seven of 34 (79.4%) of non-apocrine carcinomas were negative for AMACR and none of them showed TS8. We are analyzing the 
mRNA levels of AMACR at present.

Disclosures: Gahie Nam: None; Mikhail Gorbounov: None; Linda Donegan: None; Robert Ward: None; Evgeny Yakirevich: None; Yihong 
Wang: None 
Background: Fibroadenoma (FA) is common benign breast tumor which is often conservatively followed with imaging modalities. In cases 
of growth of lesions, core needle biopsies (CNB) are often performed to rule out the possibilities of phyllodes tumor (PT) or mimics such as 
tumors with “circumscribed growth”. The study is to identify features of those “growing FAs” that are re-classified as PT (false negative core 
biopsy). 
Design: Twenty-one tumors in twenty patients with radiologic documentation of “growing FA” and pathology diagnosis of “FA” or “favoring 
FA” between 2012 and 2019 were identified. H&E slides for CNB and follow up re-biopsy or excision were reviewed. Various 
histopathologic, radiologic and clinical parameters were recorded. 
Results: All patients were female with mean age of 33.3 (range: 17-52) and average BMI of 28.6kg/m2 (range: 20.7-45.8). 15/21 cases had 
pathologic diagnosis of FA on CNB. In 5/21 cases CNB were called fibroepithelial lesions (FEL) favoring FA. Most cases had follow up 
excision (16/21). There were 7/16 excisions upgraded to benign PT and 8/16 remained FA. One FEL was juvenile papillomatosis on 
excision. No borderline or malignant PT was found on excision. The average size of the mass was 3.9cm (range: 1-10). There was no 
difference in the size between FA versus PT on excision (t test p=0.42). The average size increase of the mass was 0.9mm/month and 
there was no difference between FA versus PT (p=0.92). However, among 11 patients with age <=30, only 1 upgraded to PT; in contrast, 6 
of 10 patients aged >30 were upgraded to PT.  The average mitotic rate for PT including false negative cases was higher (2.7/HPF) than 
that of FA (0.8/HPF), p=0.028. All lesions including PT had circumscribed borders. Four PTs were initially called FA on CNB (false negative 
cases). Comparison of the biopsy and excision found all cases were due to the variable cellularity of the tumor, which is a feature of PT but 
can be a sampling issue on CNB. There were no statistical differences in the mass size and size increase rate between the false negative 
cases and the rest (p>0.05). 
Conclusions: The false negative rate (pertaining to FA on CNB and PT on excisions) is 4/16 (25%) on clinico-radiologic impression of a 
“growing FA”. Older age is the most significant factor for “growing FA” to be upgraded. Mitotic rate appears to a superior indicator of PT 
compared to circumscription, stromal cellularity, radiology mass size and size increase rate in our study. 
232 Extramammary Metastases to the Breast: A Series of 17 Cases with Clinicopathologic 
Characterization

Background: Metastasis of extramammary malignancy to the breast is rare (0.3-2.7%). The major problem is to differentiate primary from 
metastatic extramammary neoplasms. Misdiagnosis as a primary breast cancer even in cases with a medical history of another primary 
cancer is common. The purpose of the study was to review the clinicopathologic and radiologic characteristics of extramammary 
metastases to the breast. 
 
 
226 
Design: Pathology databases were searched for breast biopsies or excisions with extramammary metastasis to the breast from 2001 to 
2019 excluding primary breast skin lesions and lymphomas. Seventeen patients with metastatic breast lesions were retrieved. Clinical, 
radiologic and follow-up data were recorded. 
Results: Sixteen patients were females and 1 male with mean age of 57 (range: 25-83). The diagnosis was established on core needle 
biopsies in 15/17 cases, 1 excisional biopsy and 1 lumpectomy. The average size of the metastases was 1.9 cm (range: 0.2-5.7). The most 
common tumor type that metastasized to the breast was melanoma (24%) (Table). Median time interval from the initial diagnosis of 
extramammary tumor to breast metastasis was 2.5 years (range:  1-40). 16/17 patients had known history of primary extramammary 
cancer prior to the breast lesion. In one case, breast neuroendocrine tumor was the initial manifestation which led to clinical workup with 
CT finding of a terminal ileum mass with additional metastatic sites including liver, peritoneum and lymph nodes. 9 of 16 patients (56%) had 
evidence of metastases outside the breast which was known before the breast biopsy. In remaining 4 of 16 patients the metastatic disease 
was first identified by biopsy of a “breast mass” and after confirmation of the metastatic disease with breast involvement, additional 
metastatic sites were identified. Only one patient had an isolated metastasis from ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma. Eight patients with 
follow-up information showed persistent metastatic disease and one patient passed away with residual disease.

Conclusions: Pathologic examination and clinical history are the most helpful guide to differentiate the primary breast cancer from 
metastatic spread. Metastasis to the breast from an extramammary neoplasm usually indicates disseminated metastatic disease and a 
poor prognosis. Breast metastasis can be initial presentation of extramammary primary and an accurate diagnosis of breast metastases, 
differentiating primary from metastatic breast carcinoma is important for proper management.

Background: Pre-operative sampling of abnormal or suspicious axillary lymph nodes provides valuable prognostic information and guides 
treatment planning in breast cancer.  Such lymph nodes are typically sampled by core needle biopsy (CNB) performed under manual or 
radiologic guidance.  The reported sensitivity of axillary lymph node biopsies in this context has varied widely (27-94%) because of different 
radiologic criteria used. Few studies have looked at the negative predictive value of such biopsies.  The purpose of this study is to analyze 
the sensitivity and negative predictive value of biopsies in this setting in order to better inform clinical decisions made on the basis of these 
diagnoses.  
Design: We retrospectively identified all core needle biopsies (CNB) of axillary lymph nodes performed at our institution as part of the 
preoperative evaluation for breast cancer from 2015 to 2019.  Cases were included only if follow-up mastectomies with lymph node 
sampling were available.  Electronic medical records were reviewed to collect epidemiologic information, clinical findings, radiologic 
findings, biopsy diagnosis, and resection findings.  These data were statistically analyzed. 
Results: A total of 105 cases were included in the study, of which 77 cases (73%) showed metastatic carcinoma and 28 cases (27%) were 
negative for tumor. 13 cases (12%) were false negative on CNB and showed metastatic carcinoma on excision. The sensitivity and 
negative predictive value of preoperative axillary CNB in our study are 86% and 54% respectively. On further analyzing the true positive 
(TP) and false negative (FN) CNB categories, the average size of metastatic focus on excision is 16.7 mm in TPs and 7.3 mm in FNs 
(p<0.05). The average number of lymph nodes involved by tumor on excision is 6 in TPs and 2 in FNs (p<0.05). The key pathologic 
characteristics of the TP and FN categories are listed in Table 1.

Conclusions: Pre-operative axillary lymph node CNBs have good sensitivity but low negative predictive value. Although the negative 
predictive value is low, the false negative CNB cases show smaller and low volume axillary nodal disease compared to the biopsy positive 
cases. In the current era, axillary lymph node dissection may not be indicated in many of these false negative cases with low volume 
disease. Additional radiologic findings that may improve negative predictive value requires further study.

Background: Histopathological grading in invasive breast cancer provides valuable prognostic and predictive information.  The Nottingham 
score is widely used, but the mitotic rate score is somewhat problematic, having demonstrated the lowest level of inter-observer agreement 
 
 
228 
among the three scores and the highest susceptibility to sampling error.  Furthermore, various authors have noted threshold effects at 
lower mitotic counts and suggested re-assessment of the cut-off points.  In this study we sought to evaluate the rate of discordance 
between mitotic score, as compared to differentiation and pleomorphism scores, particularly in cases with a histologic score of 5 (grade 1) 
or 7 (grade 2) whose overall grade might be affected by a change in mitotic score.    
Design: We retrospectively identified all invasive breast carcinomas diagnosed over a 7-year period, 2008 to 2014, at two separate 
institutions.  We excluded cases with the diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma or invasive carcinoma with lobular features, as well as 
grade 3 and multifocal tumors.  We defined discordant cases as those in which (1) mitotic score was lower than one or both other scores 
and (2) if mitoses had been scored differently, a higher overall grade would be assessed (table 1).  We collected follow-up clinical data, 
multigene predictive scores, and Ki67 indices in order to statistically analyze correlation with original and altered tumor grades.  Lastly, to 
validate the accuracy of the original mitotic scores, a correlation study was performed with both Ki67 and PHH3 immunohistochemical 
stains.  
Results: We identified 1230 breast core biopsies positive for carcinoma during the study period; after exclusion criteria were applied, 633 
cases remained.  Of these, 232 fulfilled criteria for discordance as defined above. Thus the overall discordant rate was 23.7% of all 
malignancies diagnosed by breast core biopsy and 47.5% of all grade 1/2 unifocal invasive ductal carcinomas.  Correlation with PHH3 
immunohistochemical staining was strong, with Spearman coefficient (ρ) of 0.79 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.89).  Furthermore, cases given a mitosis 
score of 1 had mean Ki67 of 18%, and cases given mitosis score of 2 had mean 27% (p=0.0001).

Conclusions: Mitotic rate scores are discordant with scores for tubular differentiation and nuclear pleomorphism in a significant proportion 
of grade 1/2 invasive ductal carcinomas.  The effect of this tendency on accurate prognostication, and the propriety of current thresholds, 
requires further study.

Background: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) and adenomyoepithelioma (AME) of the breast are both rare epithelial-myoepithelial 
tumors. ACC is genetically characterized by MYB-NFIB or MYBL1-NFIB gene fusions, while AME is characterized by HRAS Q61 mutations 
for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative cases. Although ACC and AME are histologically and genetically distinct tumors, "hybrid carcinomas" 
that show mixed patterns of ACC and epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma, a counterpart of AME, have been reported in salivary gland 
tumors. We aimed to elucidate occurrence of hybrid tumors of ACC and AME of the breast and their genetic underpinnings. 
Design: To identify the hybrid tumors of ACC and AME, we reviewed histology of 15 and 14 cases originally diagnosed as ACC and AME, 
respectively, resected at the Cancer Institute Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) between 1961 and 2018. Split fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH) assay for MYB, MYBL1, and NFIB and fusion FISH assay for MYB-NFIB and MYBL1-NFIB were performed using a representative 
section of the tumors. Direct sequencing of HRAS Q61 mutations of the PCR-amplified DNA from the macrodissected tumors were also 
performed. ER status was determined by immunohistochemical staining. 
Results: Of the 15 originally-diagnosed ACC, 3 tumors showed both ACC and AME histology and transitional and intermediate histology 
between ACC and AME. Of the 14 originally-diagnosed AME, all tumors had only AME histology. 
Of the 12 pure ACC cases, 11 (92%) harbored MYB/MYBL1 aberrations. Of the 14 pure AME, 2 (50%) of the 4 ER-negative AME (no PCR 
amplification in 1 cases), and 1 (11%) of the 9 ER-positive AME showed HRAS Q61 mutations, but none 
harbored MYB/MYBL1 aberrations. 
In 2 of the 3 hybrid tumors, MYB-NFIB or MYBL1-NFIB fusions were detected in both ACC and AME parts, while no HRAS Q61 mutations 
were detected in both parts. The remaining 1 case showed no MYB/MYBL1 aberrations and no HRAS Q61 mutations in both parts.

Conclusions: We confirmed that hybrid tumor of ACC and AME also occurs in the breast. At least, a part of the hybrid tumors of the breast 
should be classified as a morphological variant of ACC, because in the present study 2 of the 3 hybrid tumors were evidenced to 
harbor MYB/MYBL1-NFIB fusions in both ACC and AME parts. Meanwhile, further genetic analysis is needed to elucidate genetic 
underpinnings for the hybrid tumors that lack MYB/MYBL1 aberrations and HRAS Q61 mutations.

Background: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a non-obligate precursor of invasive breast cancer, and synchronously identified invasive 
ductal carcinoma of no special type (IDC-NST) are often clonally related. In this proof-of-principle study, we sought to define whether 
different foci of DCIS would be uniformly clonally related to the synchronously diagnosed IDC-NST. 
Design: A central histopathologic review was conducted and estrogen receptor (ER)/HER2 status was determined as per the ASCO/CAP 
guidelines. Synchronous DCIS (n=4) and IDC-NSTs (n=3) from 2 patients with multifocal DCIS were separately microdissected and 
subjected to whole exome sequencing. Somatic genetic alterations, mutational signatures and clonal decomposition were conducted using 
validated bioinformatics methods. 
Results: Multifocal DCIS ‘Case 2’ arose in a BRCA1 (E23Vfs*17) germline carrier, and included 2 DCIS (2DCISA and 2DCISB) and 2 IDC-
NSTs (2IDCA and 2IDCB) in the same breast quadrant, all ER-/HER2- and of grade 3. The 2 DCIS and the 2 IDC-NSTs showed loss of 
heterozygosity (LOH) of BRCA1, a dominant signature 3 (HRD) and were clonally related. The 4 lesions shared a 
hotspot PIK3CA (H1047L) and a frameshift TP53 mutation with LOH. A minor subclone of 2DCISA harboring a KDM5C mutation became 
dominant in 2DCISB, suggesting that 2DCISB stemmed from 2DCISA. 2IDCA and 2IDCB harbored private mutations in GNAS and SOX2. 
Multifocal DCIS ‘Case 5’ included a grade 2 DCIS (5DCISA) and IDC-NST (5IDC) in the same quadrant, and a grade 3 DCIS (5DCISB) in a 
different quadrant, all ER+/HER2-. 5DCISB was genetically unrelated to the other lesions and had a GATA3 P424Afs*82 frameshift 
mutation and a TP53 splice site mutation with LOH. 5DCISA and 5IDC were clonally related and shared a GATA3 P408Afs*99 frameshift 
and XPO1 splice site mutations. 5IDC harbored a private SPEN mutation and a 15q11.1-q26.1 amplification (NUTM1 and IDH2). All 3 
lesions displayed a dominant mutational signature 1 ascribed to aging. No evidence of clonal selection in the progression of DCIS to IDC-
NST was observed in either multifocal DCIS case. 
Conclusions: Multifocal DCIS and synchronous IDC-NSTs are genetically heterogeneous. Our data indicate that DCIS can give rise to 
another DCIS focus via clonal selection, and that genetically unrelated DCIS and IDC-NST may co-exist in the same breast and display 
similar histologic grade, and ER and HER2 status.

Background: Senescent tumor cells can modulate their microenvironment by secreting cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and matrix 
metalloproteinases. Recent studies reported that SASP has tumor suppressive effects by immune surveillance, but paradoxically, can 
promote tumor cell growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. 
Design: To investigate clinicopathologic response to SASP, we examined immunohistochemical expression of senescence markers, p16, 
high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), and decoy receptor 2 (Dcr2), in tumor cells of invasive breast carcinoma (IBC) and correlated the 
results with tumor characteristics including immune cell infiltration and clinical outcome. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed in 
tissue microarrays of 1518 IBC samples. Positivity for senescence markers was defined as moderate or intense nuclear (p16), cytoplasmic 
(HMGB1), or cytoplasmic and membranous (Dcr2) staining in ≥5% of tumor cells. Immune cell infiltration was evaluated by stromal tumor-
infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) density and the number of CD103-positive intratumoral TILs (CD103+ iTILs) per unit area (mm2). 
Results: Positive staining for p16, HMGB1, and Dcr2 was observed in 20.1% (270/1342), 7.2% (96/1337), and 8.6% (120/1402) of cases, 
respectively. For 1201 cases with IHC results for three senescence markers, 372 (31%) cases were positive for one or more senescent 
markers (senescence phenotype, SP). SP was significantly associated with an age of < 50 (p=0.023), absence of lymph node (LN) 
metastasis (p=0.002), absence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (p<0.001), histologic grade 3 (p<0.001), high Ki-67 index (p<0.001), and 
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (p<0.001). IBCs with SP had significantly higher number of CD103+ iTILs (63.9±123.1 vs 20.1±72.5, 
p<0.001) and higher density of sTILs (16±21% vs 7±12%, p<0.001) than those without SP. SP was not associated with overall survival 
(OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in all patients, however it predicted better OS (p=0.036) and DFS (p=0.028) in triple-negative subtype 
of IBC. In multivariate analysis, prognostic significance of SP disappeared. LN status and CD103+ iTILs were independent prognostic 
factors for OS, and LVI and CD103+ iTILs were for DFS. 
Conclusions: In conclusion, SP was frequently observed in TNBC and predicted better survival. Our results support that SP involves in 
immunologic modulation of tumor microenvironment by inducing stromal and intratumoral infiltration of immune cells.

Background: TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in breast cancer and mutations in this gene can be pathogenically classified as 
inactivating, stop-gain (i.e. nonsense, frameshift and splice-site)(class 1, C1) versus missense mutations with dominant-negative activity 
(class 2, C2). Although TP53 alterations are associated with high-grade disease, there is limited information on the clinical significance of 
mutation class. 
Design: The Cancer Genome Atlas (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov) was searched for TP53 single nucleotide variants and small 
insertions/deletions in 1,098 primary breast cancers and supplemented with 68 institutional metastatic ER+/HER- breast cancer cases. Chi-
square test was used for categorical values. Overall survival was estimated and tested using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. 
Results: 370 TP53 mutations were detected in 358 breast cancer cases, including 136 cases harboring C1 (median age=55 yrs., stage 1-2 
N=104, median follow up=29 mo.) and 220 with C2 (medial age=56 yrs., stage 1-2 N=160, median follow up=27 mo.) mutations; 2 cases 
had mutations in inter-domains and were excluded. C2 mutations prevailed in ER+/HER2- (C1, N=30, 28% v. C2, N=76, 72%) and ER-
/HER2+ (C1, N=10, 32% v. C2, N=21, 68%) cases. Class distribution was more similar in ER-/HER2- cases (C1, N=64, 46% v. C2, N=75, 
54%)(P=0.033). 5-year overall survival rates were 100% and 62% among patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancers harboring a C1 (N=64) 
versus C2 (N=75) mutations, respectively (P=0.022; Fig. 1), with comparable overall disease stage distribution (P=0.457). Overall survival 
rates were similar between mutation classes in ER-/HER2+ (P=0.280) and ER-/HER2- (P=0.401) cases. Alterations in ESR1, GATA3, NF1, 
EGFR, ERBB3 and KRAS were more prevalent in metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer cases harboring C2 mutations compared to cases 
with C1 mutations (OR=4.250; P=0.008; Fig. 2). 
 
 
232 
Figure 1 - 238 
 
Figure 2 - 238 
 
Conclusions: Patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancers harboring a TP53 C1 mutation had a more favorable prognosis than those with C2 
mutations. Changes associated with endocrine therapy resistance, including mutations in the estrogen machinery, inactivation of NF1, and 
alterations in MAPK signaling (EGFR, ERBB3 and KRAS), were 4-fold more common in ER+/HER2- breast cancers with C2 compared to 
C1 mutations. These results suggest that assessment of TP53 mutation class may be predictive in ER+/HER2- breast cancer.

Background: The rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) varies by breast cancer subtype, with 
the highest rates in triple negative (TNBC) and HER2-positive (HER2+) subtypes. For those not experiencing a pCR, the effect of breast 
cancer subtype on pattern of residual disease or histologic alterations in the tumor cells/tumor bed has not been studied in detail. 
Design: Patients with stage I-III breast cancer treated with NAC and breast conservation (BCT) from 2002-2014 were identified from 
institutional databases. Histologic sections of the post-treatment surgical specimens were reviewed blinded to tumor subtype. The pattern 
of tumor regression, treatment-related changes in the tumor cells, and histologic features of the tumor bed were evaluated. 
 
 
233 
Results: Among 359 patients, slides were available for 269 (75%) cases. Histologic review is complete for 148 (54%) randomly selected 
cases evaluated in this analysis, including 54 TNBC, 46 HER2+ and 48 estrogen receptor-positive/HER2-negative (ER+/HER2-) cases. An 
anthracycline and/or taxane based NAC regimen was used in 95.7% of all patients. Among HER2+ cases, 91.3% received neoadjuvant 
anti-HER2 therapy. pCR (no residual invasive disease in the breast and nodes) was achieved in 44.4%, 43.5%, and 18.8% of TNBC, 
HER2+, and ER+/HER2- cancers, respectively (p=0.01). For patients with residual disease, there was a significant association between 
tumor subtype and pattern of response. A relatively circumscribed, concentric pattern of response was seen in 62.5% of TNBCs, 27.3% of 
HER2+ and 26.7% of ER+/HER2- tumors (p=0.01). Conversely, a scattered pattern of response composed of single cells and small nests 
in a haphazard pattern was seen in 73.3% of ER+/HER2- tumors and 72.7% of HER2+ cancers but in only 37.5% of TNBC (p=0.01). 
Stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and several treatment-related changes in the residual invasive cancer cells were significantly 
more frequent in TNBC (Table 1).

Conclusions: Among patients treated with NAC and BCT, the likelihood of pCR, pattern of residual disease and changes in residual tumor 
cells and/or surrounding stroma varies with breast cancer subtype. The prognostic implications of these observations including both local-
regional and distant disease-free outcomes require further study.

Background: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare, biphasic neoplasms, classified into clinically relevant subtypes (benign (BPT), borderline 
(BLPT) and malignant) based on a combination of histological features. NCCN guidelines recommend wide local excision (EXC) with 
surgical margins (SM) of ≥1cm for all subtypes of PTs to minimize the risk of local recurrence (LR). However, recent studies have 
questioned whether the LR rate of BPTs and BLPTs is dependent of SM status. We sought to correlate SM status as well as histologic 
features with LR in a series of BPTs and BLPTs. 
Design: We searched our pathology records for BPT and BLPT treated with EXC between 1990-2015. Clinical information was retrieved 
from the e-medical records. Three study pathologists reviewed all available slides and classified the PTs according to WHO 2012 criteria. 
IRB approved the study. 
Results: We identified 60 women with 64 PTs including 47 (73.4%) BPTs and 17 (26.6%) BLPTs. Patient median age was 43 years (range 
16-77). One woman had 2 PTs, another 4, all in the ipsilateral breast. Mean tumor size was 2.5 ± 1.6 cm (range 0.5-9.5). Twenty-eight 
(44%) PTs had positive SM at first EXC (21 BPTs, 7 BLPTs), only 11 (7 BPTs, 4 BLPTs) underwent re-excision and all yielded negative 
SM. Seventeen (25%) PTs had final positive SM (14 BPTs, 3 BLPTs). Four (6.3%) PTs recurred locally: 2 (1 BPT, 1 BLPT) of 17 PTs 
(11.8%) with positive SM recurred and 2 (1 BPT, 1 BLPT) of 48 PTs (4.2%) with negative SM also recurred. Overall rate of LR was 11.8% 
 
 
234 
(2/17) for BLPTs and 4.3% (2/47) for BPTs. LR rate was 33% (1/3) in the BLPT group and 7% (1/14) in the BPT group with positive SM. 
Overall median F/U time was 61 months (range 6-328) and 59 months (range 6-285) for PT with positive SM that did not recur. Three 
recurrent PTs (1 BPT, 2 BLPTs) showed no grade progression and 1 BPT recurred as a BLPT and had negative SM status. No patient 
developed metastases. Clinicopathological features such as tumor size and stromal atypia are associated with LR on univariate analysis 
(Table 1). SM status of the index PT did not show statistically significant correlation with LR.

Conclusions: In our cohort, larger tumor size and moderate stromal atypia were associated with LR. LR rate was 7% in the BPT group 
with positive SM and 33% in the BLPT group with positive SM. These data suggest that a more conservative surgical approach can be 
considered and re-excision of BPTs with positive SM may not be required in absence of other worrisome clinicopathological features. 
241 HER2 Immunohistochemistry in Invasive Micropapillary Breast Carcinoma: Complete Assessment 
of an Incomplete Pattern

Disclosures: Marjorie Perron: None; Hannah Wen: None; Matthew Hanna: None; Edi Brogi: None; Dara Ross: None 
Background: Invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) is a rare variant of breast carcinoma, composed of avascular morula-like clusters 
of tumor surrounded by stromal spaces. This morphology can affect the HER2 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining pattern and the 2013 
ASCO/CAP HER2 Guidelines suggest moderate to intense but incomplete (basolateral) staining be considered equivocal. We perform a 
detailed assessment of HER2 IHC staining patterns in IMPC. 
Design: We searched our surgical pathology database for primary IMPC with available HER2 IHC stains diagnosed from 1/2017-9/2019. 
Clinical details, pathologic diagnoses, hormone receptors (HR) and HER2 IHC and FISH results (if available) were retrieved from e-medical 
records. H&E and HER2 IHC slides were reviewed by 2 authors to assess the MP component of invasive cancer and HER2 IHC 
characteristics, including staining intensity, distribution and pattern. The 2018 ASCO/CAP HER2 guidelines were applied. 
Results: The cohort consisted of 187 IMPC from 180 women and 2 men with median age 58 years (range 30-95). Procedure was 33% 
(61) biopsy and 67% (126) excision. Table 1 details histopathology and HER2 IHC patterns. Homogeneous (>90%) MP component was in 
40% (75) of cases. Receptor profile was: 75% (141) HR+HER2-, 20% (38) HR+HER2+, 3% (5) HR-HER2+ and 2% (3) HR-HER2-. Of 26 
cases with HER2 3+ results, 23% (6) showed complete staining pattern, 46% (12) basolateral and 31% (8) mixed complete and 
basolateral. HER2 FISH was performed in 36% (68) of cases, including 1 HER2 IHC negative, 66 equivocal and 1 positive (Table 1). FISH 
was amplified in 26% (17/66) of HER2 IHC equivocal cases, with MP component <60% in 3/17 cases, 60-89% in 5/17 cases, >90% in 9/17 
cases. 14/17 (82%) IHC equivocal/FISH amplified cases showed basolateral staining (7 basolateral, 6 complete and basolateral, and 1 
basolateral and incomplete) and 3 cases had complete staining (1 complete, 2 complete and incomplete) with weak-moderate intensity in 2 
cases, moderate in 14 cases and moderate-strong in 1 case.

Conclusions: Our results show that staining pattern and intensity are key features in the assessment of HER2 IHC in IMPC. The most 
frequent staining pattern in this large cohort was basolateral, seen in 53% of cases, including 77% HER2 IHC positive and 82% HER2 IHC 
equivocal/FISH positive. All HER2 IHC 3+ cases showed strong intensity. If a basolateral pattern and weak to moderate staining is 
observed in IMPC, alternative testing should be performed to confirm the HER2 status.

Background: The FDA approval of atezo for clinical use in TNBCs following IMpassion130 trial has placed pathologists in a challenging 
role as they are often required to optimize and validate companion dx assays in labs and gain proficiency in reading these test results. At 
present, there is confusion amongst pathologists and treating oncologists regarding the type of tissue (primary vs. metastasis) to be tested, 
type of antibody to be used and type of scoring methods to apply. Herein, we present our experience with PD-L1 staining in pts with 
metastatic TNBCs.  
Design: 48 tumors from 40 pts. underwent PD-L1 staining between March - July 2019 using SP142 antibody.  Factors of interest included- 
tumor tested (primary or metastatic), % of tumor infiltrating immune cells (IC), patient follow up, and Tx side effects, if any. PD-L1 scoring 
was based on PD-L1 expressing ICs as % of tumor area: IC1 ≥1% as positive while IC0 <1% as negative.  
Results: Of 48 tumors, 28 were primary and 20 metastatic (6 axillary LNs, 5 liver, 3 lung, 2 brain, 2 skin, 1 abdominal wall & 1 
supraclavicular soft tissue). Six were tested on both primary and metastatic tumors and 2 on 2 primaries. 16/48 tumors were negative, 2 
indeterminate because of lack of ICs, and 30 positives (score 1 - 30%). Of the 6 pts. with both primary and metastatic tumors tested, PDL-1 
results were concordant in all, with both sites being positive. 22 pts (55%) had positive IC score and were thus eligible for Tx, of which 5 
were LFU, 9 received atezo, 4 were recommended for atezo but have not yet started, 1 pt. was deemed ineligible for Tx and 3 pts. expired 
without any Tx. 2/9 pts. expired within 1 month of Tx. One of the 2 deceased pts. developed PD-L1 pneumonitis; however, the brain 
metastasis had decreased in size.  Of the remaining 7 pts. undergoing Tx, 1 developed a rash but showed shrinkage of liver nodules, 1 
reported fatigue and arthralgias, 1 had an enlarged supraclavicular LN but improvement of symptoms elsewhere, 1 had no improvement in 
carcinomatosis and presented with symptoms of pulmonary embolism.  The remaining 3 pts did not report any AEs.  
 
 
238 
Conclusions: In this study, 55% of pts. with metastatic TNBCs had PD-L1 positivity by current criteria in either primary carcinoma, 
metastasis, or both.  When feasible, staining of primary tumor is preferable because of the relatively small size of most metastatic tissue 
samples, the paucity of ICs in most metastases, and the inability to perform testing on bone metastases or cytology specimens.

Background: Mammography is currently being utilized as a screening tool to detect early breast cancers using low dose x-rays.  Digital 
mammography allows for higher quality images with less radiation.  Breast tomosynthesis (3D mammography)/digital breast tomosynthesis 
takes multiple images of the breast from different angles and then creates a 3D image.  We investigated if there is a difference between 
breast cancers detected by 3-D tomography. 
Design: 200 breast cancer patients were selected, 100 who were screened via tomography (T) and one hundred who were not (NT) from 
September 2010 to April 2013.   The patients ranged in age from 34 to 78 (T group) and 36 to 79 (NT group).  We noted histologic subtype 
and grade, radiologic size, radiologic presentation (including mass, calcifications, architectural distortion and density), whether the lesion 
was associated with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) or other lesions (including atypical duct hyperplasia, 
radial scar, intraductal papilloma, mucocele-like lesion and fibroadenoma) and predictive marker status (estrogen receptor (ER), 
progesterone receptor (PR) and Her2). 
Results: Approx. 2/3 thirds of the patients (NT group) had invasive carcinoma (IC) (54 ductal, 4 lobular, 3 mixed ductal and lobular 
features, 3 with separate ductal and DCIS, 1 invasive mammary, undesignated, 1 microinvasive), and 1/3 had DCIS.  Similarly approx. 2/3 
thirds of the T group patients had invasive carcinoma (45 ductal, 7 lobular, 2 invasive mammary, unspecified, 3 mixed ductal and lobular 
features, 2 with separate ductal and DCIS, 2 microinvasive), and 1/3  had DCIS. For NT, roughly 50% of the IC presented as a mass, 10% 
with calcifications, 2% with distortion, 1% with a lesion and the remainder are unknown.  The smallest size of IC detected was 4 mm.  The 
grade distribution of invasive duct carcinomas in both groups was nearly identical (NT-21% grade I, 62% grade II, 17% grade III) versus (T-
25% grade I, 57% grade II, 18% grade III).  Average size of invasive tumors, predictive marker status, and type of DCIS showed similar 
distributions between the two groups. 
Conclusions: No significant differences can be identified between NT and T screened carcinomas of the breast although further studies 
with larger patient cohorts are necessary.

Background: Programmed death-1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors have been approved for use in a range of tumor 
types. PD-L1 expression, as assessed using FDA-approved immunohistochemistry (IHC) diagnostic assays such as the Dako PD-L1 IHC 
28-8 and 22C3 pharmDx assays or the Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay, is associated with improved outcomes following PD-1/PD-L1 
inhibitor treatment in some tumor types. Atezolizumab, in combination with nab-paclitaxel, was approved for the treatment of patients with 
PD-L1+ advanced triple-negative breast cancer in Mar 2019, with SP142 approved as a companion diagnostic assay. Here, we 
investigated the prevalence of PD-L1 expression, test utilization, and analytical concordance in real-world breast cancer (BC) samples. 
Design: NeoGenomics Laboratories Inc (Fort Myers, FL, USA), a US national reference laboratory, provided results for PD-L1 tests 
performed between Oct 2015 and Dec 2018. Clinical characteristics of patients were provided by Symphony Healthcare Solutions and 
matched to test results using unique identifiers. PD-L1 expression was determined by trained pathologists using the 28-8 or 22C3 assays 
(Agilent Technologies), or the SP142 assay (Ventana Medical Systems), according to the manufacturers’ protocols at the time. PD-L1 
expression was reported as the percentage of tumor cells (TCs) with PD-L1 staining for the 28-8 and 22C3 assays only. Statistical analysis 
was performed by BioStat Solutions Inc. 
 
 
239 
Results: 623 PD-L1 tests were performed on samples from 577 patients with BC. The volume of PD-L1 tests on BC samples increased 
~20-fold over the period evaluated. Mean turnaround time (TAT) was <5 days. Prevalence of PD-L1 expression on TCs in patients with a 
28-8 or 22C3 test result (n=549) is shown in the table. Concordance between the 28-8 and 22C3 assays in matched samples from 26 
patients with BC was high (Kendall’s tau=0.997 [95% CI, 0.889–1.000]) (Figure). Overall (OPA), positive, and negative percentage 
agreement between the 28-8 and 22C3 assays were 100% (Cohen’s kappa 1.00) at all cutoffs evaluated. Assessment of PD-L1 expression 
by biopsy location is ongoing.

Conclusions: Mean PD-L1 test TAT for BC samples remained <5 days despite a large increase in test volume. Tumor PD-L1 expression 
was ≥1% in 35% of samples. Despite a small sample size, analytical concordance between the 28-8 and 22C3 assays in matched samples 
was high (OPA=100%). These data provide real-world context for PD-L1 testing in BC.

Background: Breast cancer (BC) mortality is the final sequelae of distant relapse in the majority of such cases. Estrogen receptor 
(ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 status provide clinical utility in guiding therapeutic decision-making in metastatic BC. 
Endocrine or HER2-targeted therapies are mainly directed at the receptor status of the primary tumors. However, increasing data have 
shown substantial differences between the receptor profiles of primary BCs and their paired metastases. In this study, we sought to assess 
the frequency of receptor conversion in a large single center cohort. 
 
 
240 
Design: The receptor statuses of primary BCs and their paired metastases diagnosed at the authors' institution between 01/2000 and 
08/2019 were retrospectively collected following IRB approval. Those from regional lymph nodes were excluded. A total of 241, 222 and 
214 paired cases were available in the study period for ER, PR and HER2 analyses, respectively.  Semiquantitative analyses of ER and PR 
using H-score were also performed, when available. 
Results: The highest conversion rate was seen for PR (41.4%), including 72 (32.4%) positive to negative (+/-) and 20 (9%) negative to 
positive (-/+). The mean PR H-scores of the primary BCs and their paired metastases were 84.4 and 36.5, respectively (P<.0001). The 
conversion rate for ER was 17.4%, including 35 (14.5%) +/- and 7 (2.9%) -/+, while the mean H-scores of the primary and metastatic BCs 
were 190.7 and 155.4, respectively (P=.01). HER2 conversion rate was 11.7%, including 14 (6.5%) +/- and 11 (5.2%) -/+. The discordant 
rate was significantly higher for PR when compared to ER and HER2 (both P<.0001), while no significant difference was found for the latter 
two. When the sites of metastasis were analyzed separately, PR conversion rate was significantly higher in bone relapse (56.5%) when 
compared to those metastasized to the liver (P=.046) or lung/pleura (P=.02), but not brain. No significant conversation rate for the sites of 
relapse was found for ER or HER2. 
Conclusions: Receptor discordance is a frequent event in the course of BC progression, and can be a +/- or -/+ conversion. Over 40% of 
patients receptor status was converted in metastatic tumors. The findings may reflect tumor heterogeneity, sampling or treatment effect, 
and may indicate alteration in tumor biology. Thus, repeat biomarker studies are warranted in making appropriate treatment plans in the era 
of precision medicine.

Background: Checkpoint therapy shows promise for breast cancer treatment; however, uncertainty exists regarding the best immuno-
oncology (IO) biomarkers for personalizing breast cancer treatment. In this work, we characterize breast cancer immune biomarker 
expression using mRNA expression and protein immunohistochemistry (IHC).  
Design: We analyzed tumor samples from a retrospective cohort of 120 breast cancer patients (49% ER+, 32% HER2+, and 19% triple 
negative), with recorded clinicopathologic (CP) variables and 5 year survival outcomes. Tumor samples were analyzed by a custom 
Nanostring gene expression assay of immune/stromal genes and the PAM50 classifier. Immunohistochemistry on whole tumor sections 
was performed for: PDL1, PD1, CTLA4, CD8, and CD68. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were assessed on H&E. Statistics were 
performed with logistic or proportional odds regression, ANOVA, or Fisher’s exact test. 
Results: Increased PD1 and CTLA4 mRNA levels were associated with lymph node (LN) positive status (p=0.01, 0.02 respectively) and 
CTLA4 was associated with higher Nottingham grade (p<0.001). CTLA4 expression varied by PAM50 subtype, and was highest in basal 
and HER2-enriched groups (p=0.003). PDL1 mRNA expression was not significantly associated with CP variables. Unsupervised clustering 
using all immune/stromal genes segmented cases strongly based on grade, LN status, and PAM50 subtype (Fig.1). Preliminary IHC 
scoring for PDL1, PD1, and CTLA4 (Table 1) demonstrated expression more frequently in immune cells than in tumor cells. IHC scoring 
and mRNA expression were not strongly correlated. In contrast to mRNA data, PDL1 and PD1 expression by IHC were associated with 
positive LN status (both p=0.02); but CTLA4 expression by IHC showed no association. TILs ranged from 1-80, with a mean of 17. The 
mean proportion of CD8+ lymphocytes was 35%.

Conclusions: Our data suggest caution is needed in the comparison of mRNA to IHC data for IO biomarkers in breast cancer samples. 
Nonetheless, both techniques identify significant associations of IO biomarkers with LN metastasis. After completing IHC scoring for the 
entire cohort, we will further explore correlations between individual IO biomarkers, and further test associations with all CP variables.

Background: Adjuvant chemotherapy is still the major treatment for triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) after surgical resection. 
However, the prognosis is quiet different among TNBC patients receiving similar chemotherapeutical regimens. 
Design:  To observe how intrinsic subtypes and immune status within the tumor affect the prognosis of TNBCs after adjuvant 
chemotherapies. A total of 111 retrospective tumor samples of TNBC were studied including 47 cases of relapse and 64 cases of non-
relapses with a median follow-up time of 92 months. RNA was extracted from FFPE tumor samples and target gene expression profiles 
were tested by Next generation of sequencing (NGS). Intrinsic subtypes were analyzed using PAM50 and a group of 17 immune genes 
was used for immunity evaluation within the tumors.  
Results:  PAM50 analysis showed all intrinsic subtypes existed in TNBCs, including luminal A（13，12%）, luminal B（1, 1%）, HER2-
enriched（11, 10%） and  Basal-like（86，77%）. The intrinsic subtypes showed a significant impact on prognosis for relapse-free 
survival in the TNBC patients. While Basal-like showed an expected outcome as reported before, HER2-eriched and Lumina A both had 
 
 
242 
worse outcome than Basal-like. Among the patients with Luminal A subtype, 10 of 13 were ER or/and PR positive detected at RNA level, 
and risk of recurrence (ROR) showed 5 were in low risk and 8 were in medium risk. For HER2-enriched patients, 3 of 11 were HER-2 
positive at RNA level. Immunity score was calculated with expression of 17 immune-related genes and divided patients into immune-strong 
and immune-weak groups. Immunity score had significant impact on prognosis only in late stage patients (IIB and above) and was 
significantly correlated with the amount of tumor infiltrated lymphocytes. 
Conclusions:  Intrinsic subtype-dependent impact on prognosis of TNBC patients after adjuvant chemotherapies was found in current 
study.  Patients with intrinsic subtypes other than Basal-like may need different therapeutic strategies, such as endocrine or target 
therapies, to improve their prognosis. Immunity score is a good predictor for prognosis of TNBC in late stage. A larger scale of perspective 
study is needed to confirm findings in current study.

Disclosures: Cynthia Reyes Barron: None; Maricarmen Planas-Silva: None; David Hicks: None; Bradley Turner: None 
Background: Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women worldwide. Women with distant metastases have poor outcomes with 
frequent development of resistance to available hormonal and chemotherapeutic agents and worse overall survival. According to the 
Centers for Disease Control, the national average body mass index (BMI) for adult women in the U.S. in 2015 was 28.6 kg/m2, which is 
considered overweight.  Conflicting evidence exists regarding the association of BMI with disease progression free survival and overall 
survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer. 
Design: A single institution retrospective study of women with metastatic breast cancer was conducted. Pathology reports and medical 
records from 2011 to 2015 were searched to identify cases with biopsy proven breast metastases to any distant organ site. Several factors 
were considered including breast cancer histologic type and stage at diagnosis, estrogen receptor (ER)status , progesterone receptor 
status, HER2-neu amplification status, the type of metastatic disease, metastatic site, patient age, ethnicity, BMI (kg/m2) at the time 
of  metastases, and outcome to include survival after metastases. 
Results: 127 cases of metastatic breast cancer were identified. 118 of these had BMI data at the time of the first metastatic diagnosis. 
Ages ranged from 32 to 91 years of age (mean 63.4). BMI ranged from 17.4 kg/m2 to 52.9 kg/m2 (mean 29.3). 73% of patients were 
overweight or obese. More patients were obese in all categories with metastatic disease (liver, bone only, other, ER+, and triple negative) 
except HER2+, where most patients were overweight. Only one patient was underweight. Outcome data was available for 111 cases. 74 
(67%) patients were deceased at the time of the study with an average survival of 863.4 days after first metastasis diagnosis. 22 patients 
survived greater than 2000 days (Table).

Conclusions: Obesity is a well-known cause of co-morbidities, and has been suggested to negatively impact the prognosis in breast 
cancer. In our study population, BMI did not significantly impact the site of metastasis, and there was no significant correlation between 
overall mean survival and BMI; however, there was a noticeable trend for decreased survival with increasing BMI in triple negative patients 
(Fig1), and a noticeable trend for increased survival with increasing BMI in patients with liver metastases (Fig 2). Further investigation into 
tumor hormonal status, site of metastatic disease, and BMI are warranted in larger cohorts.

Background: Several carcinomas of the breast are histologically and genetically identical to their salivary gland counterparts (e.g., adenoid 
cystic carcinoma: MYB-NFIB; secretory carcinoma: ETV6-NTRK3; mucoepidermoid carcinoma: CRTC1-MAML2). Acinic cell carcinoma 
(AciCC) is yet another tumor that occurs in both the breast and salivary glands. Recently, a recurrent genomic rearrangement, 
t(4;9)(q13;q31), was identified in salivary AciCC which results in constitutive upregulation of the nuclear transcription factor NR4A3 that can 
be detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Nuclear NR4A3 staining has been found to be a sensitive and specific marker of AciCC of the 
salivary gland, but its expression in AciCC of the breast has not yet been studied. 
 
 
245 
Design: To address this issue, NR4A3 IHC was performed on whole-tissue sections of 13 cases of AciCC of the breast from 11 unique 
patients. Nuclear staining was considered a positive result. 
Results: The median patient age was 48 years (range, 32-74) and the median tumor size was 2.5 cm (range, 0.6-10.5). 8 cases had 
axillary lymph nodes sampled; one patient had 10/17 positive lymph nodes, one patient had isolated tumor cells in one lymph node, and the 
remainder were node-negative. 6 tumors showed mixed histologic patterns, most commonly AciCC admixed with invasive ductal carcinoma 
of no special type (4 cases) followed by AciCC admixed with metaplastic carcinoma (2 cases). All tumors showed the characteristic 
histologic features (haphazardly distributed small glands and solid nests with eosinophilic luminal secretions in the glands, cells with finely 
to coarsely granular cytoplasm) and immunophenotype (e.g. positive for S100, lysozyme, and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, and negative for 
ER, PR, and HER2) of AciCC. For tumors with mixed histologic patterns, the areas of AciCC were analyzed for NR4A3 staining. All 13 
breast AciCC were negative for NR4A3. 
Conclusions: We report that breast AciCC are consistently negative for NR4A3 by IHC, despite this marker being expressed in most 
salivary AciCC. Despite the morphologic similarities, our findings suggest that the molecular underpinnings of salivary gland and breast 
AciCC are different. This study complements prior work and provides further evidence that a tumor type that occurs in both the breast and 
salivary glands may have different underlying genetic abnormalities in each organ. Further studies are needed to determine the molecular 
drivers of AciCC in the breast.

Background: With the advancement of screening practices along with molecular assays that require increasingly smaller amounts of 
tissue, there is a drive to improve the patient experience when evaluating enhancing and non-enhancing mass lesions of the breast by 
utilizing less invasive methods. Widespread adoption of MRI guided vacuum-assisted core needle biopsies is a modality suited to 
evaluating non-palpable breast lesions discovered on routine screening in order to provide earlier detection of clinically significant lesions. 
Design: A retrospective natural language search for MRI guided breast biopsies reviewed within a single institutional database between 
01/01/2010 and 06/14/2019 yielded 329 cases and 414 unique specimens from 322 patients (age range: 21-79 years old). The final 
diagnosis for each case was stratified into the following diagnostic findings: invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), invasive lobular carcinoma 
(ILC), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), atypical lobular hyperplasia 
(ALH), intraductal papilloma (IP), treatment effect (RX), surgical/biopsy effect (SURG), flat epithelial atypia (FEA), columnar cell change 
(CCC), fibroadenoma/fibroadenomatous change (FA), and apocrine metaplasia (APO). All remaining entities were considered benign. The 
results were further categorized into the following: invasive (IDC, ILC), DCIS, high-risk atypical (ADH), non-high-risk atypical (LCIS, ALH, 
IP, FEA), and benign (RX, SURG, CCC, FA, APO). Chi-square analysis was performed. 
Results: Of the 414 MRI guided biopsies evaluated, 266 (64.3%) were benign, 49 (11.8%) were non-high risk atypical, 22 (5.3%) were 
ADH, 36 (8.7%) were DCIS, and 41 (9.9%) showed invasive carcinoma. The most common diagnosis was apocrine metaplasia (124; 
30.0%) (Table 1). Benign diagnoses were most frequently identified in women, 30-39 years old (25/30; 83.3%). Malignant diagnoses 
(invasive carcinoma or DCIS) were most frequently identified in women, 60-69 years old (20/58; 34.4%) (Figure 1). The majority of cases 
were from Caucasian women, 40-49 years old (95/322; 29.5%) (Figure 2). There was no statistical significance in women from other 
ethnicities.

Conclusions: Based off of the current cohort, the overall diagnostic yield of malignancy and high-risk epithelial atypia in MRI guided 
biopsies of non-palpable breast lesions is marginal. While the potential exists to detect lesions much earlier than conventional techniques, 
benign findings are routinely biopsied.

251 An Appraisal of Clinicopathologic Parameters Associated with Response to Neoadjuvant Treatment 
in HER2 Positive Breast Cancer

Disclosures: Juan Rong: None; Farnaz Hasteh: None; Oluwole Fadare: None; Somaye Zare: None 
Background: Neoadjuvant HER2 targeted therapies have shown significant effectiveness in patients with HER2 amplified breast cancers; 
however, response to treatment may vary among patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate any possible correlation that may exist 
between routinely evaluable clinicopathologic parameters and response to neoadjuvant HER2 targeted therapy. 
Design: Clinicopathologic data were reviewed on 118 patients with HER2 positive breast cancers that underwent neoadjuvant HER2 
targeted therapy and surgical excision from 2014 to 2018 at a single institution. Treatment responses were evaluated on the excisional 
specimens using the MD Anderson residual cancer burden (RCB) classification. Cancers with pathologic complete response (PCR) or 
residual cancer burden-I (RCB-I) were classified as “responder”, and others as “non-responders”. The two groups were compared 
regarding a variety of clinicopathologic parameters, including patient age, tumor Nottingham grade (1/2+ vs 3+), HER2 IHC status (3+ vs 
others), HER2 copy numbers, HER2/CEP17 ratio, ER and PR status. 
Results: Of the 118 cases, 41 (34.75%) were responders and 77 (65.25%) were non-responders. Responders and non-responders were 
similar in age (mean 53.5 years vs 51 years, p=.28).  92.6% of the responders showed HER2 3+ expression by IHC, compared with 54.5% 
of the non-responders (p<.001). In the responders group, 48.8% were ER positive and 29.2% were PR positive (p=0.003); in the non-
responders group, 75.3% were ER positive and 61% were PR positive (p=0.001). The responders and non-responders showed 
comparable rates of grade 3 tumors. 97.5% of the responders had a HER2 copy number of >6, versus 65% of the non-responders 
(p<0.001). Only one patient had a HER2/CEP17 ratio of <2 in the responders group versus 12 in the non-responders group (p=0.029). The 
median HER2 signals/cell was >20 copies and the median HER2/CEP17 FISH ratio was 7.2 in the responders group. Corresponding 
values for the non-responders group were 7.1 HER2 signals/cell and a HER2/CEP17 FISH ratio of 3. 
Conclusions: 3+ HER2 protein overexpression, high HER2 copy number, and ER/PR negativity are the primary predictors of response to 
neoadjuvant HER2 targeted treatment.  Clinicopathologic features may help to predict response to neoadjuvant therapy in HER2 positive 
patients.

Disclosures: Tricia Rood: None; Prasad Koduru: None; Sunati Sahoo: None; Helena Hwang: None; Yan Peng: None; Yisheng Fang: 
None; Venetia Sarode: None 
Background: Pathologic complete response (pCR) is a marker for improved survival in HER2 positive breast cancer patients. Factors 
associated with pCR have not been well defined, especially in relation to level of HER2 overexpression and clinical outcome. 
The purpose of this study was to identify factors that predict pCR among patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and to determine if 
there was an association between level of HER2 overexpression and survival. 
Design: We retrospectively reviewed HER2+ breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant anti-HER2 and standard chemotherapy. 
Biomarkers (ER, PR, HER2, Ki67) were performed on all core biopsies using immunohistochemistry. HER2 FISH was performed on all IHC 
2+ and most IHC 3+ cases. Scoring of biomarkers was performed according to ASCO/CAP guidelines. Pathologic response was evaluated 
after definitive surgery using standard gross and microscopic evaluation. pCR was defined as ypT0/is pN0. Follow-up information was 
obtained from electronic chart review. Survival was determined by log rank test. 
Results: We identified 257 HER2 positive breast cancer patients; 99 (38.5%) achieved pCR and 158 (61.4%) had partial response. In 
univariate analyses, pCR was strongly associated with HER2 IHC 3+ (87%) vs HER2 IHC 0, 1+, and 2+ that were amplified by FISH (12%), 
(p<0.001), higher HER2 gene copy number (p=0.001) and HER2/CEP17 ratio (p=0.004), ER negative status (p<0.001), lower ER 
expression (p=0.002), PR negative status (p<0.001) and higher KI67 (p=0.033). Patients treated with Herceptin and Perjeta achieved pCR 
in 44% vs 34.7% with Herceptin alone (p=0.250). In multivariate analyses, HER2 IHC 3+ (p<0.001) and negative hormone receptor (HR) (p 
<0.001) status were independently associated with pCR. 
The median follow-up was 36.3 months (9.5-198 months). Although the DFS (p=0.054) and RFS (p=0.055) was better in the pCR group, no 
significant difference was observed in the OS between the pCR and non-pCR groups (p=0.37). When pCR group was stratified by low 
HER2/CEP17 ratio (<6) versus high (≥6), the former had significantly better OS (p=0.045), DFS (p=0.0037) and RFS (p=0.0037).

Conclusions: Although high HER2 expression was a predictor of pCR, the long term outcome was significantly better for patients with 
lower HER2 ratio who achieved pCR compared to those with higher ratio. This suggests that high HER2 expression could be a poor 
prognostic factor even though it was associated with initial high sensitivity to anti-HER2 therapy.

Background: Diagnosis of microinvasion (MI) in breast core needle biopsy (CNB) can be challenging particularly in a background of 
carcinoma in situ (CIS) involving sclerosing lesion with periductal fibrosis and lymphocytic infiltrate. Immunohistochemical stains (IHC) for 
myoepithelial cells aid in confirming MI. Surgical management of MI deviates from CIS as the former includes sentinel lymph node biopsy 
(SLNB) while the latter typically includes SLNB only when total mastectomy (TM) is planned. We investigated the utility of IHC in 
diagnosing MI in our CNBs and its impact on final histopathology on surgical excision. 
Design: We conducted a search for cases of CIS with foci suspicious for MI, in which IHC for calponin and p63 was used to confirm MI 
(defined as invasive carcinoma ≤1 mm) between January 2010 and June 2019. CIS included ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and lobular 
carcinoma in situ (LCIS). MI cases diagnosed based on routine histology were also collected for the same time period. Only cases with 
follow up excision data were included. Cases with synchronous invasive carcinoma were excluded. Clinicopathologic data including age, 
size, laterality, resection type, SLNB status and biomarker profiles were compared. Graphpad Prism software was used for statistical 
analysis. 
Results: We identified 106 cases of CIS (102 DCIS, 4 LCIS), where IHC was used to confirm MI (MI-IHC hereafter). Mean age was 58 
years. Of the 106 cases MI-IHC was identified in 24 cases (23%). See table. All 24 MI-IHC cases had SLNB (100%). Of the 82 CIS cases, 
39 had SLNB (48%). Relative risk of finding invasive carcinoma/MI on resection in MI-IHC was 1.8 (p=0.03) compared to CIS. There was 
no correlation between the biomarker profile with the resection outcome in either CIS (p=0.5, Fisher's exact test) or MI-IHC cases (p=3.4, 
Chi-square test). We identified 7 cases of MI, diagnosed on routine histology without IHC, of which 5 (71%) had invasive carcinoma/MI and 
2 (29%) had CIS or no residual carcinoma on resection. Mean size of invasive carcinoma and CIS on resection in this group was 11 mm 
and 25 mm, respectively. The resection outcome between MI-IHC and MI based on routine histology was not significant (p=0.6).

Conclusions: IHC helped diagnose MI in CNB for CIS in 23% of cases. Compared to CIS, the diagnosis of MI-IHC carried a relative risk of 
1.8 in finding invasive carcinoma/MI on resection. There was no difference in the significance of the method used for the diagnosis of MI.  
254 Utility of E-cadherin and p120 Stains in Evaluating Lobular Lesions: Should We Do One Stain or 
Both?

Background: While the distinction between ductal and lobular lesions can often be made on H&E, E-cadherin and p120 immunostains are 
frequently used as a diagnostic aid. This is most critical for in situ carcinomas, since the clinical management of DCIS and LCIS is very 
different. However, the most cost effective and timely staining algorithm has not been established. Should both of these stains be routinely 
used as a panel, or should one be ordered first (and if so which one)?  
 
 
251 
Design: 144 cases on 2 tissue microarrays (TMA) containing ductal and lobular lesions were stained with both p120 and E-cadherin. 
Cases were semiquantitatively scored for their cytoplasmic (C) and membranous (M) staining (negative (0), equivocal/uninterpretable (1), 
weak positive (2), strong positive(3)), special patterns (e.g., granular, crush, dot-like or incomplete membranous) and internal controls. On 
the basis of single stain evaluation, the pathologist was asked to make a diagnosis (ductal v lobular v indeterminate), score their confidence 
level, and report whether they would require the other stain for diagnosis.  
Results: 92 cases of invasive carcinoma, 28 cases of CIS and 5 cases of normal breast were evaluated. In 65% of cases a diagnosis of 
ductal vs lobular could be made (confidence 2-3) for E-cadherin alone and 48% for p120. In 52% of cases it was indicated that the other 
stain should be reviewed for p120 and 36% for E-cadherin. For the 64 cases that were indeterminate on p120, E-cadherin would have been 
definitive 45% of the time. Conversely, for the 45 cases that were indeterminate on E-cadherin, the p120 stain would have been definitive 
11% of the time. However, in 88% of cases of CIS only, a ductal vs lobular diagnosis could be made (with confidence 2-3) for p120 alone 
and 82% for E-cadherin alone. In 12% of cases it was indicated that the other stain should be reviewed for p120 and 19% for E-cadherin. 
Scores of C0M0 for E-cadherin and C3M0 were associated with high confidence using one stain alone. Scores of C0M1, C1M1, C2M1, 
C2M2 and C3M2 as well as variable and incomplete staining patterns were associated with low confidence.  
Conclusions: Our data support starting with either p120 or E-cadherin for cases of CIS where morphologic features are ambiguous; both 
are not usually necessary. Invasive carcinomas with indeterminate features on TMA often remain indeterminate after dual staining. Data 
using whole stained sections will also be analyzed for confirmation of these initial TMA-based results.

Background: The PAM50 ROR score and the OncotypeDX recurrence score (RS) were shown to be of  prognostic and predictive 
significance for adjuvant therapy in ER/PR-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. Both tests contain sub-signatures with proliferation- 
and hormone receptor-related genes, but also apoptosis-related and other signatures. We studied the power of gene expression 
signatures in the pre-treatment core biopsy for prediction of pathologic complete response (pCR) defined as no invasive tumor residues in 
the specimens collected at surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (ypTis/0 ypN0). 
Design: A cohort of patients who had received a NACT for unilateral primary breast cancer at a single institution (time period: 2003 - 2012) 
were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 163 samples were selected which met the selection criteria of estrogen-receptor positive and 
HER2-negative disease, sufficiency of RNA in the core biopsy and passed RNA quality control criteria. RNA analysis was performed by 
measuring a custom panel of 269 breast cancer related genes and 11 housekeeping genes using the nCounter platform (Nanostring® 
Technologies, Seattle CA). Data normalization and statistical calculations were done using R Version 3.6.1. 
Results: ROC cutpoint analysis revealed similar predictive scores for the ROR-score (cutpoint: 50.4, PPV: 0.23, RR=2.00) and the RS 
(cutpoint: 52.0, PPV: 0.25, RR=2.12). The proliferation signature of the ROR-score had a similar significance as the ROR-score itself (PPV: 
0.25, RR=2.20). With the OncotypeDX, also its proliferation signature was predictive for pCR (PPV:  0.22, RR=1.88). Other sub-signatures 
of the ROR- or RS-scores were not significant for prediction of pCR. Differential gene expression analysis for the whole data set of 269 
genes was significant for 36 upregulated genes in a logistic model for pCR vs. non-pCR (adjusted p-value < 0.05). Here, the most 
significantly predictive genes for pCR were two checkpoint kinases, CHEK1 (PPV: 0.33, RR=2.8) and PIM2 (PPV: 0.39, RR= 3.38), both 
involved in DNA damage response pathway and regulation of mitosis. Another 34 genes in the core biopsy were significantly repressed 
with regards to pCR, among them several genes of the estrogen-pathway such as ANKRD30A (PPV: 0.36, RR= 3.13) and TFF3 (PPV: 
0.35, RR=3.02).

Conclusions: Gene expression analysis may significantly improve prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in pretreatment core biopsies, 
with proliferation and estrogen-pathway associated genes playing the major roles.

Background: Encapsulated papillary carcinomas (EPC) of the breast is a variant of papillary carcinoma that are confined to a cystic space, 
surrounded by a fibrous capsule and lack the myoepithelial coat. Despite the latter finding, it is recommended that EPC be staged as pTis 
due to its indolent course. Concurrent frank invasive carcinomas are staged commensurate with their size. We sought to investigate the 
 
 
253 
molecular pathways differentially expressed in pure EPC and EPC with frank invasion at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In addition, 
we compared EPC with its corresponding invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) at the transcriptomic level.    
Design: We selected 3 cases of pure EPC (C1-C3) and 3 cases of EPC (C4e-C6e) with corresponding IDC (C4i-C6i).We performed whole 
transcriptome analysis on laser-capture microdissected samples from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. We used CloneTech 
Mammalian stranded pico kit for sequencing RNA. KEGG pathway analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed using the 
cluster Profiler R package (v3.0.0) and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. DNA analysis was performed 
using our in-house next generation sequencing hybrid capture covering 580 genes on C1-C3 and C4e-C6e.   
Results: There were 5 female and 1 male patients. The mean age was 73 years (range 62-90). All cases were hormone receptor positive. 
C4e-C6e showed upregulation of NTRK2 and MAGI2 (lg2FC= 3.14 and lg2FC = 3.0 fold, respectively) and downregulation 
of PRKACB (lg2FC= -4.4) compared to C1-C3 on RNAseq. C4i-C6i showed upregulation of collagen-related genes (COL10A1, COL11A1, 
COL14A1, COL16A1, COL1A1, COL3A1, COL8A1) (lg2FC range: 6.28 fold change) and ADAM12/ADAMTS2 (lg2FC=6.2 and lg2FC= 6.9 
fold change) compared to C4e-C6e (FDR =0.014). Pathway analysis showed upregulation of collagen fibril organization and extracellular 
matrix organization pathways in C4i-C6i compared to C4e-C6e and upregulation of kinase activity pathway (GO: 0016301) in C4e-C6e 
compared to C1-C3.Recurrent PIK3CA hotspot non-synonymous mutation was identified in C3, C4e, C5e and C6e (c.G1633A in C5 and 
c.A3140G in C3, C4 and C6). 
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that kinase and matrix metalloproteinase pathways contribute to EPC with invasion compared to pure 
EPC cases. Furthermore, enrichment of collagen-related genes in IDCs compared to their corresponding EPC suggest a synergistic 
potential with the aforementioned pathways. Mechanistic studies are warranted to validate the findings.

Filho: None; Hannah Wen: None 
Background: Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast (AdCC) is a rare histologic subtype of breast cancer (BC) that is usually of triple-
negative (TN) phenotype, but has favorable prognosis, unlike most TNBC. A solid variant of AdCC with basaloid features (AdCC-SB) has 
been described and features a higher rate of lymph node metastases than conventional AdCC (AdCC-C). The long-term outcome of AdCC-
SB patients has not been fully characterized.  
Design: A search of our pathology database identified patients with AdCC of the breast diagnosed between 1988-2019 at our Center. We 
compared clinicopathologic features and outcomes of AdCC-C and AdCC-SB, classified based on pathology reports. Statistical analysis 
was performed using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and t-test for continuous variables. Recurrence free survival (RFS) was 
analyzed using log rank test.   
Results: A total of 104 AdCCs (79 AdCC-C; 25 AdCC-SB) were identified (Table 1).  69 cases were triple negative (87%), 10 cases had 
low ER expression (13%). Patients with AdCC-SB were significantly older than AdCC-C (mean age at diagnosis 64 years vs 58 years, 
respectively; p=0.048), and had larger tumors (size 2.3 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively; p=0.290). AdCC-SB had higher tumor grade (grade 3; 
66% vs 17%, p=.007), and more frequent lymphovascular invasion (20% vs 3.8%, p=0.02). The reported rate of axillary lymph node 
metastases was higher in AdCC-SB, but not significant (8% vs 2.5%, p=0.243). There were no significant differences in treatment between 
AdCC-SB and C-AdCC groups in terms of surgery (breast conserving surgery (BCS, 81% vs. 73%) vs. total mastectomy (TM, 19% vs. 
27%, p=0.573) , radiation treatment (RT, 79% vs. 65%, p=.393), chemotherapy (28% vs 42%, p=.269) or endocrine treatment (1.8% vs 0, 
p=1). Follow-up data were available for 57 AdCC-C (median follow up, 61.5 months) and 19 AdCC-SB (median follow up, 42 
months).  Patients with AdCC-SB had a markedly reduced RFS compared to AdCC-C (median RFS, 4.1 months vs. 14 months, p<0.0001,

Conclusions: Compared to conventional AdCC, AdCC-SB has higher Nottingham grade and more frequent lymphovascular invasion, a 
higher rate of lymph node metastases at diagnosis and distant metastasis at follow-up, with significantly worse outcome. Histologic 
subtyping of AdCCs should be considered for treatment decision-making. A molecular analysis of these cases is ongoing.

Background: Patients with estrogen receptor (ER) positive/HER2 negative breast cancer with high recurrence risk can benefit from 
adjuvant chemotherapy. Oncotype DX (ODX) assists in predicting high risk cancers, reporting a recurrence risk score (RS) and scores for 
ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2. This study examines the discordance of biomarker status between ODX and routine 
immunohistochemistry (IHC)/in situ hybridization (ISH) and evaluates clinicopathologic features of discordant cases. 
Design: A total of 591 cases were reviewed to compare ER, PR, and HER2 status between IHC/ISH and ODX. RS and clinicopathologic 
features including chemotherapy, recurrence, and metastasis were compared between concordant and discordant cases. H&E slides from 
ER discordant cases were reexamined. 
Results: Concordance rate was high between ODX and IHC for ER status (580/591, 98.1% concordant) and moderate for PR status 
(512/591, 86.6% concordant). There were 11 ER discordant cases which were all ER+ by IHC but ER- by ODX. All ER discordant cases 
were high risk by ODX as ER status influences overall RS. Histologically, all of these cases were grade III invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), 
except one case diagnosed as grade I IDC with apocrine features. Although this case was grade I and ER/PR positive by IHC, this patient 
received chemotherapy due to the high RS. Of 79 PR discordant cases, 60 were PR+ by IHC but PR- by ODX. 584 cases had HER2 
results, with high negative agreement (580/582, 99.7% concordant). Two cases were HER2- by IHC/ISH but equivocal by ODX. Two cases 
were HER2+ by ISH but HER2- by ODX, one case testing HER2- by repeat ISH on excision. Mean RS for ER discordant cases was higher 
than for ER concordant cases (48.0 versus 17.1, p value<0.0001). Similarly, mean RS for PR discordant cases (IHC+/ODX-) was higher 
than for PR concordant cases (27.2 versus 16.7, p value<0.0001). However, there was no significant difference in recurrence or metastasis 
between ER/PR concordant and discordant cases.

metastasis). P value <0.0001* indicates a statistically significant difference in mean Oncotype score between PR concordant and 
IHC+/ODX- PR discordant cases by Bonferroni post hoc analysis. 
Conclusions: ODX and IHC displayed high ER concordance and moderate PR concordance, with more sensitive detection by IHC. HER2 
concordance between ODX and IHC/ISH was high for HER2- cases, while the HER2+ case by ISH was reported as HER2- by ODX, 
suggesting more sensitive detection by ISH. High RS of discordant cases suggest possible risk overestimation. Therefore, therapeutic 
decisions for discordant cases should be based on clinical and pathological correlation and not Oncotype score alone.

Background: Intraoperative evaluation of the nipple/subareolar tissue (N/SAT) has been used by surgeons to assess for occult nipple 
involvement by malignancy and guide the decision-making process for nipple preservation during nipple sparing mastectomies (NSM). The 
aim of our study is to evaluate significance and accuracy of frozen section (FS) results compared to final pathology/permanent sections.  
Design: We retrospectively reviewed records of patients that underwent NSM with FS of the N/SAT from 2014 to 2018. Positive FS or final 
pathology results include atypical hyperplasia, in situ and invasive carcinoma.   
Results: Over a 5-year period a total of 339 NSM cases utilized FS to evaluate the N/SAT. Of the total 339 cases, 85(25%) were 
prophylactic and 254(75%) were therapeutic mastectomies. All 85 prophylactic mastectomies were negative (benign) on FS and final 
diagnosis. Among 254 therapeutic mastectomies, 217(85.4%) showed negative (benign) intraoperative FS with concordant benign final 
pathology; 22(8.7%) showed positive intraoperative FS with concordant positive final pathology; 15(5.9%) were false negative (benign) on 
FS and positive on final permanent sections (figure 1). Positive results consisted of atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia (5, 27.8%), in situ 
ductal or lobular carcinoma (11, 61.1%) and invasive carcinoma (1, 5.6%). One false positive case showed “atypical intraductal 
proliferation” at FS and was diagnosed as intraductal papilloma on final pathology; the nipple was not removed at the time of surgery. Of 
the 37 cases with positive final nipple pathology, 14(37.8%) had intraoperative resection of the nipple/areola complex (NAC), 9(24.3%) 
required an additional surgery for removal of NAC and 13(35.1%) had no additional procedures performed. Residual pathology was 
identified in 9(39.1%) of the resected NAC. In our patient cohort frozen section diagnosis has a sensitivity of 58.3%, specificity of 99.5%, 
positive predictive value (PPV) of 95.5% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 93.5%.  
Figure 1 - 259 
 
Conclusions: Intraoperative evaluation of the N/SAT is highly accurate (93.7%) and specific (99.5%) test that prevented additional surgical 
intervention in 8.7% of therapeutic mastectomies. At the same time, surgeons should be aware of the low/moderate sensitivity of 
intraoperative FS, which may be explained by processing artifacts, sampling or cautious approach not to overcall the FS findings.

Disclosures: Eliah Shamir: None; Yunn-Yi Chen: None; Gregory Bean: None; Poonam Vohra: None; Melinda Sanders: None; Gregor 
Krings: None 
Background: Metaplastic carcinomas of the breast (MC) are rare tumors with differentiation of neoplastic epithelium into squamous or 
mesenchymal-like elements. MC are usually triple negative (TNBC) but are morphologically and molecularly heterogeneous, and histotype 
may correlate with outcome. Whereas squamous (SqCC) and spindle cell carcinomas (SpCC) have frequent PI-3 kinase(K) 
and TERT promoter mutations, chondroid matrix-producing MC (CMPC) lack these aberrations. Mixed MC with multiple lineages often 
have chondroid differentiation (MMCD), but whether CMPC are biologically distinct from other MC with chondroid differentiation is 
unknown. We profiled CMPC and MMCD using capture-based next generation sequencing (NGS) and compared subtypes. 
Design: DNA was extracted from 9 MMCD, 10 CMPC and matched normal tissue. MMCD included tumors with at least 3 lineages in 7/9 
cases: chondroid (100%), spindle (100%), osseous (44%), squamous (44%) and rhabdomyoid (11%). CMPC were defined by accepted 
histologic criteria. NGS was performed targeting exons of 479 cancer genes, 40 introns and TERT promoter. Duplicate reads were 
removed computationally for allele frequency determination and copy number alteration (CNA) calling. Single nucleotide variants, 
insertions/deletions and CNA were evaluated. Genetics and clinicopathologic features were compared between groups and genetics were 
compared with TCGA TNBC (n=81). 
Results: PI-3K pathway aberrations were identified in 89% MMCD, including PIK3CA (3/9), PIK3R1 (3/9), PTEN (3/9), and AKT1 (1/9), but 
were absent in CMPC (0%, p<.001). The single MMCD lacking PI-3K aberrations had a driver germline BRCA1 mutation. TERT promoter 
mutations were present only in MMCD (33%) not CMPC (0%, p=.08). There was no difference in TP53 mutation status (89% MMCD, 90% 
CMPC). Both subtypes were genomically unstable. Frequency of PIK3CA/PIK3R1 (56% vs 20%), PTEN (33% vs 7%) and RB1 (44% vs 
12%) aberrations were higher in MMCD than TCGA TNBC (p=.01, p=.04, and p=.04, respectively) and similar to other non-CPMC MC 
subtypes. MMCD mean tumor size (8.6±6.3cm) was larger than CMPC (2.7±1.4cm, p=.01); other clinicopathologic features and outcomes 
were statistically similar. 
Conclusions: CMPC are genetically distinct from MMCD. Along with published data, the results support classification of CMPC as a 
distinct MC subtype, and these tumors should be distinguished from other MC with chondroid differentiation. MMCD with spindle elements 
share PI-3K and/or TERT promoter aberrations with SpCC and SqCC.

Disclosures: Eliah Shamir: None; Charles Zaloudek: None; Miriam Post: None; Yunn-Yi Chen: None; Gregor Krings: None 
Background: Rare invasive breast carcinomas have serous-like morphologic features mimicking gynecologic serous carcinomas (SLBC). 
A recent study suggested SLBC are triple negative (TN) and clinically aggressive (Mod Pathol 2019;32:52-54). However, histopathologic 
and genetic characterization of SLBC is lacking, and it is unknown if these tumors represent a distinct subtype. We used capture-based 
next generation sequencing (NGS) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine if SLBC have characteristic features. 
Design: Nine SLBC were analyzed. DNA was extracted from 7 SLBC and matched normal tissue. NGS was performed targeting exons of 
479 cancer genes, 40 introns, and TERT promoter. Duplicate reads were removed computationally for allele frequency determination and 
copy number alteration (CNA) calling. Single nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions and CNA were evaluated. IHC was performed on 8 
SLBC for ER, PR, HER2, GATA3, mammaglobin, GCDFP-15, SOX10, PAX8, WT1, and p53. 
Results: Mean age was 48 (range 27-67). Mean tumor size was 4.6±3.4 cm and 56% had ductal carcinoma in situ. No patients had 
gynecologic tumors. SLBC were histologically distinct, with anastomosing branched glands ± tufts or micropapillae in desmoplastic stroma. 
Eight had high nuclear grade (HNG) and were modified SBR grade 2 (4/8) or 3 (4/8); of these, 7 were TN and 1 was ER-/HER2+. All HNG 
SLBC had TP53 mutations. Other aberrations included amplification of CCNE1 (2/7), CCND3/VEGFA, NOTCH2, and ERBB2 (1 each) 
and CDK12 rearrangement (1/7). HNG SLBC had numerous CNA, including recurrent gains of 1q and distal 17q and loss of 5q, 8p and 14q 
(3 cases each). One SLBC was SBR grade 1/low nuclear grade and weakly ER+/HER2-. This tumor lacked TP53 mutation and 
had KRAS hotspot mutation with inactivating mutations in KDM6A, CREBBP, ARID1A and DNMT3A. CNA analysis showed only 1q gain. 
All SLBC were GATA3+ and negative for GCDFP15, PAX8, and WT1. SOX10 was positive in 7/8 and negative in the HER2+ tumor. 
Mammaglobin was negative (6/8) or focally positive (2/8). P53 IHC correlated with TP53 mutation status. Of 8 patients with follow-up (mean 
48 months), 4 had nodal metastasis, 2 had local recurrence, 1 had distant metastasis and 2 died of disease.

Conclusions: SLBC comprise a unique histotype of breast cancers that are morphologically and genetically indistinguishable from 
gynecologic serous carcinomas. IHC, especially GATA3, PAX8, and WT1, is useful in the differential diagnosis. TN SLBC are genetically 
similar to other TN breast cancers. 
262 HER2 Intratumoral Heterogeneity is Associated with Distal Metastasis in HER2-positive Breast 
Carcinoma

University, Columbus, OH 
Disclosures: Tiansheng Shen: None; Hiro Nitta: Employee, Roche Tissue Diagnostics; Anil Parwani: None; Zaibo Li: None 
Background: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) occurs with variable frequencies in 
breast cancers and has been reported as an independent predictive factor for the response to anti-HER2 neoadjuvant therapy. However, 
there have been few studies of its association with distal metastasis. 
Design: Assessment of HER2 ITH was performed on whole tissue sections of pretreatment primary breast tumors from a cohort of 158 
HER2-positive invasive breast carcinomas treated with anti-HER2 chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and surgery. Both HER2 gene 
signal and protein expression were simultaneously evaluated by means of a single-slide dual assay, designated as a HER2 gene-protein 
 
 
259 
assay (GPA). HER2 ITH was categorized into genetic (mixture of HER2-positive tumor cells with both HER2 gene amplification and HER2 
protein overexpression and HER2-negative tumor cells with negativity at both levels) and non-genetic ITH (only protein heterogeneity 
caused by discordant gene amplification and protein overexpression). Figure 1 shows representative images from cases with HER2 
homogeneity, genetic heterogeneity, and non-genetic heterogeneity. 
Results: The cohort was composed of 158 HER2-positive invasive breast carcinomas including 44 with and 114 without distal metastasis. 
Statistical analysis revealed distal metastasis was associated with higher Nottingham grade, larger tumor size, positive lymph node and 
negative estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR), but not age, neoadjuvant therapy, nuclear grade, HER2 immunohistochemistry 
(IHC), HER2 copy number or ratio. Fifty-seven cases (36%) showed HER2 ITH including 19 with genetic, 8 with both genetic and non-
genetic, and 30 with non-genetic ITH. The presence of ITH or genetic ITH was associated with increased frequency of distal metastasis, 
but not non-genetic ITH (Table 1).

Disclosures: Mingxia Shi: None; Shu Yang: None; Siyuan Cheng: None; Liurka Lopez: None; Xiuping Yu: None 
Background: Forkhead box A1 (FOXA1), is receiving considerable attention because it controls downstream transcription of estrogen 
receptor (ER)-regulated genes. The enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a transcriptional repressor involved in cell cycle regulation and 
has been linked to aggressive breast cancer. The aim of this study was to elucidate the correlation of FOXA1 and EZH2 expression, and 
evaluate their association with clinicopathological parameters and molecular pathways in breast cancer. 
Design: The expression of FOXA1 and EZH2 was analyzed immunohistochemically in 143 patients with invasive breast carcinoma, and 
correlated with various clinicopathologic features and molecular subtypes. The mRNA expression of FOXA1 and EZH2 as well as 
mutations of P53 and RB1 were extracted from cBioportal-Breast Cancer METABRIC dataset, which contains microarray data and targeted 
sequencing data from primary breast tumors of 1904 patients. A bioinformatics analysis was performed. 
Results: FOXA1 protein expression was inversely correlated with EZH2 protein expression (P =0.031). FOXA1 expression was 
demonstrated in 59% of invasive breast cancers. It correlated positively with expression of ER, PR, AR, luminal A subtype (p<0.001), and 
inversely correlated with tumor grade, Ki67 index (p< 0.001), p53 expression (p=0.013) and triple negative subtype (p <0.001). EZH2 
expression was seen in 54% of invasive breast cancers. High EZH2 expression was significantly associated with high tumor grade, high 
Ki67 index, positive p53 expression, ER negativity, PR negativity, AR negativity, HER-2 enriched and triple negative breast cancer 
(p<0.001). Our bioinformatics analysis confirmed the inverse correlation between FOXA1 and EZH2 expression (p<0.001) in triple negative 
breast cancer. Our analysis has revealed that reduced FOXA1 expression or increased EZH2 expression correlates with basal and claudin-
low subtypes of breast cancer. A strong association between expression of EZH2 and the percentage of tumors with alterations in TP53, 
RB1, or both (p<0.001) was demonstrated. Decreased FOXA1 expression was also associated with increasing percentage of tumors that 
have alterations in TP53, RB1, or both (p<0.01). 
Conclusions: Our results show that FOXA1 expression is associated with favorable tumor characteristics and prognostic factors, while 
EZH2 expression is strongly associated with features of aggressive breast cancer and TNBC. Expression of both biomarkers is associated 
with alterations of TP53/RB1 pathways.

Disclosures: Yukiko Shibahara: None; Vivianne Freitas: None; Anna Marie Mulligan: None 
Background: Mucocele-like lesions (MLL) are uncommon in breast biopsies. Although upgrade rates to carcinoma are reportedly low, 
excision is often performed to permit definitive diagnosis and exclude malignancy. We reviewed the spectrum of findings associated with 
MLLs identified on core biopsy in a major tertiary referral cancer center over a 19 year period and correlated these with excision diagnoses. 
Design: All patients who had a biopsy diagnosis of MLL from Jan 1, 2000 to March 31, 2019 were identified. MLLs were classified as (i) 
MLL without atypia, (ii) MLL with atypia, (iii) MLL with suspicious (i.e. detached epithelium within mucin raising the possibility of invasive 
carcinoma) but non-definitive findings, (iv) MLL with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Patient age, imaging findings, method/gauge of 
biopsy, clinical history and follow-up were recorded. 
Results: Sixty biopsies from 59 patients were identified (age range: 39 to 76 (mean 54) years). Stereotactic (n=50) or ultrasound 
(n=10) guided biopsies were performed targeting calcifications (n=56) or a mass (n=4). Excision was not performed in 10 patients. Table 1 
summarizes the core biopsy and corresponding excisional diagnoses. Of 24 MLL without atypia on biopsy, 11 showed atypia in the 
excision (4 with flat epithelial atypia (FEA), 5 with atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), 2 with lobular neoplasia (LN)) and one patient, with 
increasing calcifications, had low grade DCIS with microinvasion on excision (upgrade to malignancy rate 4%). Of 22 patients with MLL 
with atypia (FEA n=3, ADH n=18, LN n=1), 4 (18%) had either invasive (n=1) or in situ (n=3) carcinoma on excision. In 3 patient’s cores, 
detached epithelium within mucin was identified raising the suspicion for invasion. All 3 were confirmed to have invasive carcinoma on 
excision. Of 6 patients with invasion on excision, the radiologic findings were: mass (n=2), asymmetric density (n=1), cluster of cysts (n=1), 
suspicious calcifications (n=1) and indeterminate calcifications (n=1).

Conclusions: MLL are exceptionally rare, even in high volume breast centers; however, they are associated with atypical hyperplasia in a 
high proportion of cases. In the absence of atypia, the rate of upgrade to malignancy is low which may obviate the need for routine 
excision, provided radiologic correlation is achieved. MLL with atypia on core biopsy require excision in view of the significant rate of 
malignant upgrade. The presence of a mass lesion on imaging may predict for malignancy in this setting.

Background: Deleterious germline mutations in CHEK2, ATM, PALB2 & PTEN genes confer an increased breast cancer (BC) risk. Clinical 
features and family history based algorithms are employed to select BC patients for germline mutation testing. Immunohistochemical (IHC) 
expression of protein products of mutated high-risk genes has not been investigated in BC. We hypothesized that mutations in these 4 
genes may lead to an abnormal IHC expression pattern of corresponding protein products in the tumor cells.  
Design: BC patients with deleterious germline mutations in CHEK2, ATM, PALB2 & PTEN were identified. The H&E stained slides were 
reviewed to identify tumor-containing formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks. Immunohistochemistry was performed using Dako 
staining platform. Primary antibodies for PALB2 (ab202970), ATM (2C1[1A10]), CHK2 (EPR4325), and PTEN (138G6) proteins were used 
for BCs with respective deleterious mutations. IHC expression was assessed in tumor cells and adjacent benign breast tissue.

Results: Total 26 BCs with 10 CHEK2, 9 ATM, 6 PALB2 & 1 PTEN deleterious germline mutations were identified. One PTEN mutated 
case with ADH was included in the study. IHC staining was performed on 8 CHEK2, 7 ATM, 6 PALB2 & 2 PTEN cases. Abnormal CHK2 
IHC staining was identified in 7/8 (88%) BCs. Three distinct CHK2 IHC patterns were noted: 1) Strong diffuse nuclear positivity (Fig 1A) 
in 5/8 cases, 2) Null-pattern with no staining (Fig 1B) in 2/8 cases, & 3) Normal breast–like staining (Fig 1C) in 1 case. Four of 5 (80%) 
strong CHK2 staining tumors had missense mutations. Null-pattern was present with in 1 case each with a missense & a frameshift 
mutations. Mild to moderate diffuse nuclear IHC staining, similar to normal breast CHK2 IHC staining pattern was present in 1 case with 
frameshift mutation. Loss of nuclear/cytoplasmic PTEN IHC expression was noted in 2 PTEN mutated cases. In carcinoma case, PTEN 
loss was noted in high grade DCIS (Fig. 2A) as well as in ADH foci (Fig. 2B). ATM and PALB2 IHC expression pattern was similar in tumor 
cells and benign breast epithelium. Both ATM and PALB2 showed diffuse mild to moderate nuclear and cytoplasmic staining.

Conclusions: We report abnormal CHK2 IHC expression in 88% of BCs with germline CHEK2 mutations. With PTEN germline mutations, 
IHC PTEN loss is seen as early as ADH, as well as in carcinoma. Abnormal CHK2 & PTEN IHC pattern can be used as a quick and cost-
effective surrogate marker for identifying CHEK2 & PTEN mutated BCs.

Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) excision is a standard procedure for surgical staging of early breast cancer (BC). Traditionally, 
histological evaluation of SLNs includes multiple H&E serial section examination, and keratin immunostaining. Impact of special histological 
processing of SLN on TNM staging has not been studied. Variation in metastatic tumor size and tumor foci in SLN level sections has not 
been studied systematically. Aim of this study is to analyze the impact of serial H&E examination of SLNs on metastatic tumor size 
measurements, pN staging and anatomic TNM staging of BC. 
Design: Patients with BC who underwent primary breast surgery and SLN sampling during 2010-2015 were identified. Positive SLN that 
underwent H&E examination of 3 serial level sections and showed metastasis (mets) <20 mm were included in the study. Neoadjuvant 
cases were excluded. The SLN H&E slides were reviewed. SLN mets size and number of mets foci were recorded. Clinical, histological 
and follow up information was retrieved from cancer registry.   
Results: Total 236 positive SLNs, from173 patients, were included in the study. There were 12 (5%) SLNs with isolated tumor cells, 73 
(31%) with micromets and 151 (64%) with macromets. Multiple non-contiguous mets foci were identified in 30% SLNs. Mets were present 
in only 1 section in 23 (10%) SLNs, 2/3 sections in 30 (13%) SLNs and all 3 sections in 183 (77%) SLNs. Sections containing mets size of 
different pN categories were present in 84 (36%) SLNs. Ductal tumors showed significantly higher variation in mets size between levels 
than lobular tumors (40% versus 10%; p=.001). Variation in mets size did not correlate with presence of non-contiguous mulitple mets foci. 
Examining only first H&E section lowered pN staging in 30 (17%) patients and altered overall TNM staging in 27 (16%) patients. The most 
frequent alteration in pN staging with 1 H&E section was under staging of pNmi as pN0, in 18 (10%) patients. Using 2 H&E serial sections 
down staged pN and TNM staging in 7 (4%) patients (p<0.001; Vs. 1 H&E). Kaplan –Meier survival curves plotted similar progression free 
and overall survival estimates using AJCC staging with 2 and 3 H&E sections.  
Conclusions: Examination of only 1 H&E section on axillary SLN misses up to 25% of microscopic metastasis and underestimates 
the anatomic AJCC staging in up to 16% breast cancer patients. Two H&E section evaluation performs almost as well as 3 H& E levels in 
identifying SLN metastases.

Background: Although clear cell morphology may be seen in various subtypes of breast cancer, a pure variant of clear cell carcinoma 
(usually glycogen-rich) is a very rare primary breast malignancy. It is characterized by the neoplastic cells with abundant and clear 
cytoplasm that contains glycogen. A recent SEER study highlighted the aggressive clinical behavior of this rare cancer. Apart from steroid 
receptors profile (ER positive in 33-75%, PR positive in 30-43% and HER2 positive in 0-44%) status, no information is available regarding 
its molecular features and targetable biomarkers. 
Design: Nine pure (>90% clear cell morphology) clear cell carcinomas of the breast were comprehensively profiled using massively 
parallel DNA and RNA sequencing (NGS), in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. 
Results: Steroid receptors ER and AR were positive in 8/9 and 7/9 cases, respectively. AR was positive in 6/7 cases without the presence 
of ARv7 splice variant. None of the cases was HER2 positive. Pathogenic mutations were found in PIK3R1 and BRCA2 (#1), TP53, 
PTEN and CDKN2A (#2), TP53 and BCOR1 (#3). PTEN protein loss was confirmed by IHC in PTEN mutated cases as well as in two 
additional cases without detectable PTEN gene mutation. No gene fusion was seen in any of the cases. Low PD-L1 expression (1-10%) 
was exclusively seen in immune cells (n=3/8). All tested cases (n=8) were MSI stable and had low TMB (3-7 mutations/mb) (n=3). 
Conclusions: Clear cell carcinomas are predominantly ER and AR positive and consequently amenable for endocrine treatment regimes. 
Frequent AR over-expression without ARv7 may support trials with anti-AR therapies. A proportion of clear cell carcinomas harbors 
alterations in the PIK3CA/PTEN pathway indicating a potential benefit of PI3K/Akt/mTor inhibitors while the presence of PD-L1 on immune 
cells warrants the trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Background: The category of mammary spindle cell proliferations (SCP) is heterogeneous and encompasses a wide range of lesions from 
benign to malignant. While historically most if not all SCP diagnosed on core needle biopsy (CNB) would be excised for definitive 
diagnosis, in modern era of minimally invasive treatment some of them may be followed with conservative approach. The aim of this study 
was to examine the spectrum of SCP and to evaluate if excision of benign / indeterminate SCP is required. 
Design: We performed a retrospective review of all CNB with spindle cell proliferation or lesion or neoplasm or tumor diagnosis between 
2001 and 2019. Clinical, pathological and follow up data were reviewed. 
Results: We identified 71 CNB from 64 patients (5 with multiple biopsies of progressing/recurrent SCP; 3 male patients). Mean age was 52 
years. Based on CNB 38 (53.5%) SCP were benign (differential diagnosis [ddx] included fibromatosis, myofibroblastoma, fat necrosis, 
schwannoma, leiomyoma, scar, hamartoma, benign fibroepithelial lesion, and/or reactive changes, regardless whether excision for 
definitive classification was recommended), 16 (22.5%) indeterminate (benign and malignant entities in ddx or excision for definitive 
classification recommended without ddx including benign entities only) and 17 (24%) were malignant (metaplastic carcinoma, borderline / 
malignant phyllodes or sarcoma favored). Clinico-radiologic findings and follow up (FU) are summarized in table 1. Benign SCP were more 
likely to occur in younger patients with no prior/concurrent breast cancer and be of smaller size. All male patients had benign SCP 
(schwannoma, myofibroblastoma, fibromatosis) that were not excised (FU 3-26 months).  Among 18 benign SCP that were not excised 17 
were stable, smaller or no longer present at median 42 months (range 6-193m; one lost to FU). All 3 indeterminate SCP on CNB that 
ended up being malignant on excision were highly suspicious radiologically (BIRADS at least 4c). All malignant SCP presented with either 
a new mass or within 6 months from the onset of symptoms.

Conclusions: Most SCP were benign (72%). All malignant SCP were diagnostic on CNB. None of the benign SCP on CNB resulted in an 
upgrade to malignancy on excision. Indeterminate SCP on CNB are highly unlikely to be malignant if clinico-radiological correlation is 
ensured. Many SCP can be spared surgery provided good correlation with radiological and clinical data.

Disclosures: Malvika Solanki: None; Asha Nair: None; Jaime Davila: None; Daniel Visscher: None; Jodi Carter: None 
Background: The transcriptome of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers (BC) has been widely studied. In contrast, tumor-
adjacent benign breast is not well-characterized despite its frequent use as “normal” tissue.  We compared the coding and long non-coding 
transcriptomes of “tumor-adjacent” benign breast to paired ER+ BC, and benign breast without BC, to gain insight into tumor-associated 
alterations in the benign microenvironment and at-risk benign breast. 
Design: Methods: RNA from cryobanked, histologically-verified “tumor-adjacent” benign breast (benign ER+BC) with matched ER+ BC 
(N=10), and benign breast from age-matched premenopausal patients with no BC (benign NoBC, N=10) was sequenced (Illumina TruSeq 
Stranded mRNA kit). Differential expression (DE) analysis (edgeR 2.6.2) identified DE genes from normalized RPKM reads (absolute log2 
fold change (FC) > 1 and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.10), with intra-group bias correction. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), Ingenuity® 
Systems] and gene set enrichment analysis (GeneTrail) were performed. 
Results: In benign ER+BC vs paired ER+BC, 2284 DE genes included coding RNAs (84%), antisense (AS) RNAs (4%) and lncRNAs 
(4%).  In the benign ER+BC vs benign NoBC set, 484 DE genes included coding RNAs (84%), AS RNAs (2%) and lncRNAs (5%). Among 243 
overlapping DE genes, the top RNAs included Kruppel-like factors (e.g. KLF15, KLF2), FAM proteins (FAM107A; FAM13C) and heat shock 
proteins (HSPB6, HSPB7) (p<0.001).  Top DE genes up-regulated only in benign ER+BC included PDK4, PER1, 
ZBTB16 KLF15, PCOLCE2,HIF3A, AQP7, LEP, (p<0.001)  Top canonical pathways altered in benign ER+BC vs. benignNoBC  included polo-
like kinase signaling, CXCL signaling and cell cycle control/cyclin-dependent kinases (p<0.001). DE non-coding RNAs altered in 
benign ER+BC (N=30) included several lncRNA implicated in carcinogenesis or BC progression (e.g.  AC083843, LINC00961,LINC001354 
and RMRP).  
Conclusions: Tumor-adjacent benign breast in ER+BC has coding and long noncoding RNA profiles that are distinct from both concurrent 
tumor and benign breast from age-matched patients without BC.  We observed significant alterations in chemokine signaling, cell cycle 
control and many genes implicated in BC development and progression. These data provide insight into functional alterations of the peri-
tumoral benign breast environment and at-risk benign breast. 
270 Comparison and Assessment of Pathobiologic Indices to Predict Oncotype DX Recurrence Scores

Disclosures: Thing Rinda Soong: None; Joseph Geradts: None 
Background: The Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS) is used clinically to estimate the risk of distant recurrence for patients with ER-
positive, lymph node-negative breast cancer and to help with decision-making about chemotherapy. One major drawback of the assay is its 
high cost. Composite indices based on tumor parameters have been proposed to be a no-cost alternative to the Oncotype DX assay. We 
aimed to validate the correlation of RS with 3 published pathobiologic composite indices that do not include Ki67 and to explore subset(s) 
of human breast carcinomas that may not need Oncotype Dx testing if RS can be predicted by other pathobiologic indices with high 
accuracy. 
Design: Two hundred and twenty-nine breast cancer resections with data on RS were included (Table 1). Cases were reviewed for 
histology, overall grade, tubule score, nuclear grade, mitotic activity, and hormone receptor status. Pathobiologic predictive scores were 
calculated based on pathologic data and 3 published equations (Equation 1 per Klein et al 2013; Equation 2 per Geradts et al 2010; 
Equation 3 per Flanagan et al 2008)(Table 2; footnotes). Using RS as the gold standard, the predictive scores were evaluated for 
correlation and concordance with RS risk categories. 
Results: All cases were ER-positive with 90% being PR-positive. The majority were moderately differentiated (69%) and of pT1 stage 
(70%). Based on RS,  62%, 31% and 7% of the cases were classified as having low, intermediate and high risk of recurrence respectively 
(Table 1).  The 3 pathobiologic indices yielded comparable correlations with RS (Pearson correlation coefficients in overall population: 
Equation 1: 0.60; Equation 2: 0.59; Equation 3: 0.55). Equation 2 provided slightly better observed concordance with RS risk categories 
(66%) compared to equation 1 (concordance: 63%) and equation 3 (concordance: 59%), but the difference was not statistically significant 
(P=0.3). Agreement was best seen within the low-risk group, with equation 2 showing the greatest concordance (81%) (Table 2A). Among 
the 3 models, equation 1 achieved the highest specificity (84%) in distinguishing low-risk recurrence group from the rest of the cases (Table 
2B). 
 
 
266 
Figure 1 - 270 
 
Figure 2 - 270 
 
Conclusions: The 3 pathobiologic indices demonstrate comparable performance in predicting RS, with equation 2 showing slightly 
higher observed categorical concordance. The indices are better applied to predicting low-risk status but misclassification ranging from 20-
30% for low-risk cases can occur as observed in our cohort.

Machiraju: None; Anil Parwani: None 
Background: The Oncotype DX assay assesses the expression of 21 genes to generate a recurrence score between 0-100, predicting 
possibility of recurrence and consequently, chemotherapy benefit in patients with estrogen receptor-positive invasive breast carcinoma. 
Patients with low recurrence scores (<18) do not benefit from chemotherapy whereas patients with high scores (>30) do. However, 
Oncotype DX is an expensive test with a cost of about 4000$. This work aims at building a deep learning model with histology images to 
identify pathology structures that may serve as a proxy for the Oncotype DX recurrence score, hence lowering the cost of predicting 
recurrence risk and chemotherapy benefit. 
Design: A dataset of 94 breast invasive carcinoma cases (288 whole slide images) with available Oncotype DX scores was utilized to build 
a recurrence prediction model using a neural network, inspired by the existing state-of-the-art VGG19 architecture.  This model was trained 
to focus on regions relevant to breast carcinoma histologic grade by automatically evaluating mitotic activity, tubule formation and nuclear 
grade, which are the main pathology indicators used to diagnose grade of breast cancer via the Nottingham score. We visualized the 
various layers of the trained neural network to identify structures and areas of interest to the model. With the aid of subject matter experts 
and existing literature, we can associate the now identified structures to the gene set for Oncotype DX and build a histological marker proxy 
for the Oncotype DX. 
Results: The current model is successfully able to classify tumor cells, mitotic cells and tubule formation within a test compendium of 
histology image patches (>90%, >80% and >70% accuracy respectively). Additionally, a framework to visualize the regions of interest to 
the neural network has been built and validated by pathologists. Currently scanning of tissue blocks and annotation of whole slide histology 
images are underway for model training and recurrence score prediction.

Conclusions: In summary, we have developed a deep learning model to grade breast carcinoma histologically by automatically evaluating 
several histological parameters, which can be used to build a recurrence prediction model to serve as a proxy for Oncotype DX assay. A 
successful predictive model will not only address the need for a cost-effective solution for assessing chemotherapy benefit to patients, it will 
further establish understanding between genetic and histological biomarkers. 
272 Diagnosing Breast Cancer Brain Metastases: What Immunohistochemical Panel Should I Choose? 
Eric Statz1, Julie Jorns1

Disclosures: Eric Statz: None; Julie Jorns: None 
Background: Following lung cancer, breast cancer is the second most common metastatic tumor to the brain, of which triple negative 
breast cancers (TNBC) and HER2+ breast cancers are the most common subtypes. TNBC do not have standard immunoprofiles and can 
be difficult to distinguish from brain metastases from other primaries. A recent paper found SOX-10 to be a sensitive and specific marker 
for TNBC in a differential with TTF-1 negative lung adenocarcinoma. In light of this new data, we sought to identify the optimal panel for 
diagnosis. 
Design: Clinicopathologic features including subtype, grade, biomarker status, presence of other distant metastases, genetic risk, age at 
original and brain metastasis diagnoses, and living/deceased status were assessed by chart and slide review.  
A tissue microarray (TMA) was created from 47 female patients with breast cancer metastases to the brain and 15 paired breast primaries. 
Original blocks were used if TMA material had inadequate tumor for interpretation. Immunohistochemistry was performed for CK7, GATA3, 
SOX-10, Mammaglobin, and GCDFP-15. A result was considered positive if at least moderate staining was seen in ≥1% of tumor cells. 
Results: Patients were predominantly Caucasian (38/47, 80.9%) with mean age at diagnosis of 48.8 yrs (range 22-77). Most were grade 3 
(42/47, 89.4%) and ductal (40/47, 85.1%). Most (38/47, 80.9%) had died of disease, with mean time to death of 1.5 yrs (range 0.2-5.6).  
Of brain metastases, 24 (51.1%) were HER2+, 14 (29.8%) TNBC and 9 (19.1%) luminal. Forty-five (95.7%) were CK7 positive, 36 (76.6%) 
GATA3 positive, 7 (14.9%) SOX-10 positive, 20 (42.6%) mammaglobin positive and 19 (40.4%) GCDFP-15 positive. At least one of CK7, 
GATA3, or SOX-10 was positive in all TNBC metastases. Amongst the 7 SOX-10+ cases, CK7 was positive in 6, and GATA3 was positive 
in one and rare weak in another. Figure 1 highlights three representative cases. 
Of the 15 cases with paired breast primaries there was relatively good IHC correlation, with highest variability in mammaglobin expression 
(3/15, 20%) between metastatic and primary tumor. 
SOX-10 was positive in background glial cells as seen in Figures 1 and 2, occasionally complicating interpretation.

Conclusions: A panel of CK7, GATA3 and SOX-10 appears complementary in the diagnosis of breast cancer brain metastasis as at least 
one marker was positive in all cases. SOX-10 appears to be specific, but, like mammaglobin and GCDFP-15, is not a particularly sensitive 
marker in this context.

273 A Novel Case of Mammary-Type Myofibroblastoma with Sarcomatous Features and Underlying 
Identical MET Mutations

Disclosures: Alexander Strait: None; Konstantinos Linos: None; Kristen Muller: None 
Background: Myofibroblastoma (MFB) is a rare benign spindle cell tumor of the breast and soft tissue exhibiting a wide morphologic 
spectrum. The majority of these tumors harbor 13q14 deletions leading to loss of Rb1 protein expression, a feature shared among several 
soft tissue tumors with morphologic similarities (i.e., spindle cell lipoma and cellular angiofibroma). Recently, cellular angiofibroma with 
atypia and sarcomatous transformation has been described; despite the alarming histology, these tumors appear to follow an indolent 
course. Although degenerative-type atypia can occur in MFB, sarcomatous-like transformation has never been described. 
Design: We present a novel case of a 70-year-old man who underwent excision of a 2.3 cm left breast mass. Microscopic and 
immunohistochemical analysis revealed a MFB with distinct areas of sarcomatous-like morphology (Fig1A). Two expert soft tissue 
pathologists reviewed the case and confirmed the diagnosis. Both regions of classic MFB and sarcomatous-like areas were dissected and 
subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) and single nucleotide polymorphism-based chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). 
Results: Microscopically, the tumor was comprised of uniform spindle cells with fascicular architecture, associated stromal ropey collagen 
bundles and inconspicuous mitotic activity (Fig1B). There was an abrupt transition to a morphologically distinct component with 
sarcomatous morphology in which tumor cells exhibited significant pleomorphism and increased mitotic activity (Fig1C). By 
immunohistochemistry, both components were diffusely positive for smooth muscle actin, desmin, progesterone receptor, and BCL2, 
whereas both showed loss of Rb1 expression. CD34 was positive in the classic MFB, but negative in sarcomatous-like cells. In addition, 
the sarcomatous-like component showed an overexpression of p16 and absence of p53 by IHC. CMA revealed similar copy number 
alterations in both profiles including a single copy loss of 13q14 (Fig2). The sarcomatous morphology had an additional loss of 
chromosome 17p. Both components showed identical MET mutations (c.504G>T, p.E168D); an additional TP53 deletion (c.836_861del, 
p.G279fs) was found in the sarcomatous component. NGS did not reveal mutations in the RB1 gene, despite an absence of Rb1 protein 
expression, possibly due to a SNV or point mutation not covered by our hotspot NGS panel.

Background: Pure mucinous carcinoma (PMC) is a rare histologic form of breast carcinoma characterized by clusters of tumor cells 
floating in large amounts of extracellular mucin. Micropapillary pattern (MP) may occur in PMC named micropapillary variant of mucinous 
carcinoma (MPMC), which may associate with a higher rate of nodal metastasis and lymphovascular invasion than conventional PMC 
(cPMC). Increasing studies have been conducted to characterize the difference of morphology and prognostic significance between 
MPMCs and cPMCs, however, whether they harbored specific or overlapping genomic alteration has yet to be characterized. 
Design: FFPE samples of tumors and adjacent normal tissues from 10 MPMCs (MP%>50%) and 11 cPMC were subjected to whole-
exome sequencing with a coverage of 200 ×. Somatic mutations, copy number alterations and mutational signatures were determined with 
strictly integrated bioinformatics workflow. 
Results: We identified 938 somatic mutations including 782 missense, 81 frameshift, 49 nonsense and 26 in-frame InDel in 21 cases of 
PMC. TTN (19.1%, 4/21), GATA3 (14.3%, 3/21), SF3B1 (14.3%, 3/21) and TP53 (14.3%, 3/21) were the most frequently mutated genes. 
Notably, PMCs tend to display a significantly lower mutation frequency of TP53 (14.3% vs. 46.2%, p=0.003) and PIK3CA (9.5% vs. 35.2%, 
p=0.017) than invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs, NOS) from TCGA. Moreover, MPMC and cPMC harbored specific genomic alterations, in 
which PIK3CA (18.2%) were frequently found in cPMC, while GATA-3(20%), TP53 (20%) and SF3B1 (20%) recurrently mutated in MPMC. 
PIK3CA hotpot mutations (E545K, M1043I) were exclusively detected in cPMCs. The signature 3 (homologous recombination) and 
signature 13 (AID/APOBEC family) were prominent in MPMCs. Signature 1 and 2 displayed a dominate which have been linked to aging 
and activity of the AID/APOBEC family were identified in cPMCs. Copy number variation analysis revealed that MPMCs harbored 
significant arm-level alterations including chromosomal gains at 8q, 17q and 20q, as well as chromosomal loss at 6q, 17p. Meanwhile, 
significant gains at 6p, 8q as well as deleted regions at 6q were examined in cPMC. Besides, PI3K-Akt pathway, mTOR signaling pathway 
and AMPK signaling pathway were more recurrently deregulated in MPMCs than in cPMCs.

Figure 1 - 274 
 
Conclusions: PMCs show a pattern of somatic genetic alterations different from IDCs dramatically. MPMCs, which may be noted as a 
distinct subtype of breast carcinoma, also harbored unique genetic alterations other than PMCs.

Background: Invasive apocrine carcinoma (IAC) is a rare type of primary breast cancer, constituting approximately 1% of all breast 
cancers. Most pure IACs are triple negative, while the rest are HER2-enriched. The lack of targeted therapies with TNBC has fostered 
efforts to discover actionable molecular targets in these tumors. To this end, we analyzed the clinicopathologic characteristics and 
comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) in 18 pure triple negative apocrine carcinomas (TNACs) to elucidate the potentially actionable 
genomic alterations in this population. 
Design: 18 pure TNAC patients who underwent breast surgery at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center were collected. 
Clinicopathologic characteristics were analyzed. All 18 specimens were sequenced by DIAN (Hangzhou Lab) using a 324-gene platform 
(FoundationOne CDx) with licensed technologies. In this study, we focused on clinical relevant genomic alterations (CRGAs) which were 
known or likely pathogenic alterations. 
Results: The median age of these TNACs was 55.5 years, and postmenopausal status ratio was 77.8%. 83.3% of cases were diagnosed 
as histological grade II, and 16.7% as grade III. 50% of patients had nodal metastases at diagnosis. The majority of patients presented at 
low stage (I:38.9%; II:50.0%; and III:11.1%). Mean Ki-67 index was 9.7%. All cases exhibited diffusely nuclear staining for AR. PD-L1 
positivity was 11.7%. With a median follow-up period of 76.5 months, one patient died and two experienced distant metastases. There were 
61 CRGAs for all 18 pure TNACs, and mean tumor mutation burden was 3 Muts/Mb. The top ranked altered genes were PIK3CA (72%), 
PTEN (33%) and TP53 (28%). All the mutations in PIK3CA were known pathogenic mutations, while three novel frameshift mutations found 
in PTEN have not been reported before. Moreover, an actionable rearrangement involving the FGFR2-TACC2 was detected, which has not 
 
 
273 
been reported in breast cancer. In total, 88.9%, 50%, 44.4% and 16.7% of TNACs had at least one CRGA in PI3K/mTOR, cell cycle, 
RAS/RAF/MEK and growth factor receptors related pathways, respectively (Fig.1). All cases had at least one CRGA and 94.4% had at 
least one actionable alteration. 
Figure 1 - 275 
 
Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the largest sequenced cohort for pure TNACs. We demonstrated that most pure 
TNACs had at least one actionable alteration. Incorporating CGP into TNACs might shed light on the potential therapeutic opportunities for 
both targeted drugs and immunological checkpoint inhibitors.

Background: Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has become a topic of interest as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in triple 
negative breast cancer (TNBC). Immunotherapy is a rapidly evolving field for the treatments on TNBC. In the IMpassion130 Trial, advanced 
TNBC patients treated with Atezolizumab plus nab-Paclitaxel had a better PRS and OS compared with patients treated by nab-Paclitaxel if 
the tumor infiltrating immune cells (ICs) were PD-L1 positive. To improve the understanding of tumor immune microenvironment, we 
investigated PD-L1 expressing tumor infiltrating ICs and phenotyping of TILs in TNBC by multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF).   
Design: We studied 157 surgical resected breast cancer tissue placed in a tissue microarray with three 1-mm2 cores per tumor, including 
102 TNBCs (ER/PR <1%), 41  ER/PR low expression cases (ER/PR 1~9%), and 14 luminal types as control. The FFPE sections were 
stained by mIF for two panels, including Panel 1 (PD-L1, PD-1, CD3, CD8, CD68 and panCK) and Panel 2 (FOXP3, Granzyme B, 
CD45RO, CD3, CD8 and panCK), using Opal™ 7-color Kit on Leica BOND RX. After scanning in the Vectra system (Akoya/Perkin Elmer), 
PD-L1 expressing ICs and other immune phenotypes were analyzed via InForm software (Akoya/Perkin Elmer).  
Results: PD-L1 expression was firstly evaluated using a standard microscopy approach. PD-L1 positive was defined as either ≥1% of 
malignant cells with membrane staining or ≥1% of ICs (Fig 1). PD-L1 protein was expressed in 35.3% (36/102) of TNBCs and 29.3% 
(12/41) of ER/PR low expression cases. Only 14.3% (2/14) luminal type cases were PD-L1 positive. After co-localizing PD-L1 with other 
immune markers, PD-L1 expressing ICs were identified, including PD-L1+ macrophages and PD-L1+ lymphocytes (Fig 2A). We are 
quantifying the cell subtypes and will provide density and/or percentage of the immune cells based on co-localization of all markers. It 
 
 
274 
includes macrophages PD-L1+ (CD68+/PD-L1+), cytotoxic T cells PD-L1+ (CD3+/CD8+/PD-L1+), antigen-experienced T cells (CD3+/PD-
1+), activated cytotoxic T cells (CD3+/CD8+/GranzymeB+), memory/regulatory T cells (CD3+/CD45RO+/FoxP3+), and so on (Fig 2A/B). 
Spatial distribution of the phenotypes will be generated as well.

Figure 2 - 276 
 
Conclusions: Phenotyping tumor immune cells in the study is highly informative to understand the immune microenvironment in TNBC. 
Characterizing PD-L1 expressing immune cells in TNBC might be helpful to predict the immunotherapy of PD-L1/PD-1 blockade.

Disclosures: Bindu TG: None; Unni Pillai: None 
Background: Triple assessment comprising of clinical examination,mammogram and pathological analysis is the gold standard in 
diagnosis of any breast swelling. Pathological evaluation includes Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology(FNAC) or Trucut Biopsy;FNAC is 
usually performed by pathologists with far superior yield, while Trucut Biopsy is the domain of Interventional Radiologist and Surgeon. 
Trucut biopsy has distinct advantage over FNAC in assessment of tumor grade, hormonal evaluation and other ancillary studies. A skilled 
Pathologist can perform Trucut Biopsy sans difficulty with added advantage of Rapid Onsite Evaluation(ROSE) to confirm adequacy of 
material. 
Design: 154 patients between August 2017 and December 2018, attended Surgery OP with palpable breast lumps, radiologically 
suspicious of malignancy (BIRADS IV and V) were included in the study. Both FNAC and Trucut biopsy were done by the same operator 
(First Author) at a single sitting. Location of the tumor and tumor heterogenisity were assessed correlating clinical and Radiological 
features. Minimum of 3 smears and clot for proceing were obtained after FNAC (Using 24 G needle and 10 ml syringe) and 4-6 tissue cores 
of minimum 1 cm long by Trucut biopsy (using 14 G needle) for Hematoxylin&Eosin(H&E) staining, Receptor study and molecular analysis. 
Results: Trucut biopsy was positive in 146 cases and negative in 8 cases. Among the negative cases,3 were positive on FNAC. 
Remaining 5 patients needed image guided biopsy. FNAC was positive in 127 cases and negative in 27 cases. Negative cases could be 
corelated with Trucut Biopsy. Trucut Biopsy was less productive in skin and chest wall adherant tumors and schirrous tumors within loose 
breast tissue where FNAC fared better. In the present study Trucut Biopsy had a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 100%.FNAC had a 
sensitivity of 82%.All the 154 cases had Excision Biopsy. 123 cases had primary surgery and 31 had Neoajduvant Chemotherapy. 
Conclusions: Trucut Biopsy is the better tool for the initial assessment of palpable breast lump. It is an easy and simple technique which 
can be mastered by a Pathologist who have adequate skill to perform FNAC. The advantage of Pathologist is that, better assessment of 
adequacy of the material, by naked eye examination of the tissue cores and Rapid On Site Evaluation by imprint smears or crush 
preparation, which will improve  the patient management.

Background: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a predictive and prognostic marker in breast cancer, and it is routinely 
assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), a highly accurate 
method to quantify DNA copy number, is potentially a robust alternative for HER2 diagnostics. When compared to HER2 IHC and FISH 
testing ddPCR shows 79.3% to 100% sensitivity and 88.5% to 100% specificity. Most importantly, ddPCR allows interrogation of multiple 
regions on chromosome 17 as references for HER2 quantification. Given this advantage, ddPCR may be a better choice to detect HER2 
copy number changes in cases with polysomy, which present a constant challenge in HER2 FISH testing. We sought to determine the 
concordance of ddPCR with IHC and FISH testing at our institution. 
Design: ddPCR was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from 35 cases of invasive breast carcinoma. HER2 IHC status 
for all cases was based on the 2013 and/or 2018 ASCO/CAP HER2 guidelines and were as follows: 9 positive, 9 negative, and 17 
equivocal (2+). Of IHC equivocal cases: 6 were FISH positive, 7 were negative, and 4 were equivocal by 2013 guidelines. By the 2018 
guidelines, all four equivocal cases were negative. ddPCR involved a probe-based PCR reaction mixture comparing the ERBB2 gene with 
four unique reference gene probes on chromosome 17 (RARA, TP53, YWHAR, and B3GNTL1). A cutoff of 4.0 HER2 copy number variants 
(CNV) was used to determine positivity. Clinical-pathologic characteristics were also examined. 
Results: Of the four reference probes examined, all probes showed good (≥80%) sensitivity and specificity, with the exception 
of RARA which showed a sensitivity of 60% (Table 1). When the results from the other three probes (TP53, YWHAR, and B3GNTL1) were 
analyzed in combination, HER2 amplification was concordant in all but one case (34/35; 97.1%). This case was 3+ by IHC and negative by 
ddPCR. HER2 FISH was subsequently performed on this case and was negative, suggesting an alternative mechanism of HER2 protein 
overexpression.

Conclusions: Concordance of ddPCR with standard methods for determination of HER2 status was excellent. The genes YWHAR, TP53, 
and B3GNTL1 were all good reference probes, particularly when analyzed together. ddPCR using a combination of reference probes may 
be a useful addition or alternative method for determination of HER2 status in breast cancer.

Background: SiNK index is a simple mathematical formula devised at our institution during the evaluation of Prosigna® breast cancer 
assay and its correlation to tumor clinical-pathologic features. The index is calculated by adding tumor Size (in mm) to the pathologic Nodal 
stage (N-stage multiplied by a factor of 10) plus the Ki-67 labeling index. The score is categorized similar to Prosigna scores and risk 
categories. For lymph node-negative cases, the risk categories are low-risk (score 0-40), intermediate-risk (scores 41-60), and high-risk of 
recurrence (scores 61 or more). For lymph node-positive cases, the risk categories are low-risk (score 0-40) and high risk (score 41 or 
more). During index development, the concordance between Prosigna and SiNK score categories was 70% and the concordance between 
Prosigna risk categories and SiNK risk categories was 77%. 
Design: This study was undertaken to further evaluate the clinical significance of SiNK index. A well-characterized in-house data set of 121 
ER+/HER2-negative invasive breast carcinomas with relatively long-term follow up (average follow up of 98 months) was used for 
validation. SiNK indices were calculated and divided into scores 0-40, scores 41-60, and scores 61 or higher. The low, intermediate and 
high-risk categories were assigned based on lymph node status. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall 
survival (OS) were analyzed with respect to SiNK risk categories. P-values were obtained using the log-rank test. 
 
 
277 
Results: The recurrence rate was 5%, 11%, 33% for low, intermediate, and high-risk SiNK categories respectively. The overall survival 
was 67-71% for intermediate/high-risk SiNK categories and 89% for low-risk SiNK category (see figure 1).

Background: KIT maps to 4q12 and encodes for the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) KIT (CD117). KIT, when affected by activating 
somatic mutations, may result in a constitutively active RTK. KIT activating mutations constitute key therapeutic target in gastrointestinal 
stromal tumors (GISTs), melanoma and thymic tumors. We sought to investigate the presence of KIT activating somatic mutations in breast 
cancer (BCs) and to describe the clinicopathologic features of these tumors. 
Design: We conducted the retrospective query of 5,575 BCs previously subjected to clinical MSK-IMPACT targeted sequencing to identify 
BCs harboring oncogenic/likely oncogenic somatic mutations in KIT. The histopathologic features of BCs harboring KIT oncogenic/likely 
oncogenic mutations were centrally reviewed. Estrogen receptor (ER)/HER2 status were retrieved from the clinical records. 
Results: Seven BCs (0.13%), including 2 primary BCs (p-BCs) and 5 metastatic BCs (m-BCs), were found to harbor KIT oncogenic/likely 
oncogenic somatic mutations. These included a V559G hotspot missense mutation, 2 hotspot in-frame deletions (M552_570del and 
V560_578del) and four likely oncogenic missense mutations (R804W, R634Q, L793S and D792E). One p-BC was an ER+/HER2- 
pleomorphic lobular carcinoma of histologic grade 3, the other p-BC was an ER+/HER2+ invasive ductal carcinoma of not special type 
(IDC-NST) of histologic grade 3. All m-BCs harboring KIT activating mutations were poorly differentiated and encompassed two 
pleomorphic lobular carcinomas (2/5; 40%), two IDC-NSTs (2/5; 40%) and one micropapillary carcinoma (1/5; 20%). Most m-BCs 4/5 
(80%) were ER+/HER2- and 1/5 (20%) was ER-/HER2-. Metastases affected liver (2/5), lymph node (1/5), skin (1/5) and chest wall (1/5). 
No ESR1 mutations were identified in any of the cases. In two m-BC patients, where both the primary and metastatic BC samples were 
subjected to MSK-IMPACT, KIT activating mutations were only detected in the metastatic samples. 
Conclusions: BCs harboring KIT activating mutations are exceedingly uncommon. These BCs are phenotypically heterogeneous, but 
appear to be enriched for ER+ tumors. The presence of somatic KIT mutations restricted to metastasis in cases for which paired p-BC and 
m-BC were interrogated suggests that genetic alterations in KIT might be late events in the evolution and/or progression in BC or might 
represent a mechanism of resistance in ER+ relapsed cases lacking ESR1 mutations.

Disclosures: Theodore Vougiouklakis: None; Brendan Belovarac: None; Andrew Lytle: None; Luis Chiriboga: None; Ugur Ozerdem: None 
Background: In diagnostic breast pathology, there is no reliable immunostain that can discern benign apocrine lesions from atypical and in 
situ apocrine lesions. Diagnosis of non-invasive apocrine proliferations is challenging, with current diagnoses rendered based on 
morphology on hematoxylin and eosin staining. Interobserver variability is significant even among subspecialists. Adjunct diagnostic 
immunohistochemical stains, such as high molecular weight cytokeratins which are typically useful in non-apocrine atypical or in situ 
lesions are not beneficial in their apocrine counterparts. Here, we set out to elucidate the diagnostic utility of EZH2 and Ki-67 immunostains 
as tangible tools in non-invasive apocrine proliferations. 
Design: Non-invasive apocrine proliferations were subjected to EZH2 (n=38) and Ki-67 (n=25) immunostaining. Apocrine breast lesions 
were catalogued as follows: benign apocrine hyperplasia (BAH), atypical apocrine hyperplasia (AAH), and apocrine ductal carcinoma in situ 
(ADCIS). EZH2 expression was analyzed by H-scoring of nuclear EZH2 immunoexpression. Ki-67 index was quantified by calculating 
percentage of positive nuclei. 
Results: H-scores for EZH2 ranged from 7.4-50.8 (mean: 23.5) in BAH, 4.2-99.8 (mean: 47.4) in AAH, and 112.4-288 (mean: 196.4) in 
ADCIS. Statistical analysis utilizing the Kruskal-Wallis test showed a significant difference (p<0.0001). Dunn’s multiple comparison test 
demonstrated a significant difference between BAH and ADCIS (p<0.0001), and AAH and ADCIS (p=0.0003), however didn’t reach a level 
of significance when comparing BAH and AAH. The latter association reached a statistically significant difference (p=0.0309) by applying 
the Mann-Whitney test. Interestingly, we observed that the basally located epithelial cells showed more robust nuclear staining when 
compared to adluminal cells in our pilot cohort. The average Ki-67 index was 1.6%, 4.7%, 24.7% in BAH, AAH, and ADCIS, respectively 
(p<0001, Kruskal-Wallis test). Dunn’s multiple comparison test demonstrated a significant difference between BAH and ADCIS (p<0.0001), 
AAH and ADCIS (p=0.0199), and BAH and AAH (p=0.0434). 
 
 
279 
Conclusions: We demonstrate incremental EZH2 expression and Ki-67 index from BAH to AAH and robust positivity in ADCIS, suggesting 
EZH2 upregulation and increased Ki-67 index in atypical and in situ apocrine breast lesions compared to benign apocrine lesions. These 
findings suggest a diagnostic utility for EZH2 and Ki-67 indices in non-invasive apocrine mammary lesions.

Background: Oncotype DX (DX) is a 21-gene expression profiling test that generates a recurrence score (RS) which is used to determine 
the efficacy of chemotherapy. The DX test has become standard of care in the management of ER-positive, lymph node-negative (ER+/LN-
) breast cancer (BC). However, in ER+/LN- patients with bilateral BCs and unilateral multifocal BCs, it is not well defined when testing of 
these different foci is necessary to inform use of chemotherapy. Our goals were: 1. to evaluate the concordance of DX results in bilateral 
BCs and in unilateral multifocal BCs; and 2. to characterize pathological predictors of discordant DX RS. 
Design: 1321 ER+, HER2- primary invasive BC female patients with DX performed between 2011 and 2018 were reviewed. 18 bilateral 
BCs patients (36 tumors) and 13 multifocal BCs patients (27 tumors) with DX testing in all tumor foci were included. Hormone receptor 
expression positivity was defined as ≥1% nuclear staining. HER2 level was re-evaluated according to the 2018 guideline. RS were 
analyzed as low risk group (RS<18), intermediate (RS 18–30), and high group (RS>30). Discordance or discrepancy was present when 
tumor foci for a particular patient had different RS score, histology (ductal, lobular), grade (low, intermediate, high), Ki67 index or PR 
staining (positive, negative). 
Results: All tumors were ER+ by IHC/DX and HER2- by IHC/FISH/DX. DX RS were discordant in 50% of bilateral BCs and 54% of 
multifocal BCs. However, bilateral BCs were present in significantly older (p<0.01) patients and have more discordant histologic type 
(p<0.05) compared to multifocal BCs. Other histologic parameters were not significantly different between bilateral BCs and multifocal BCs, 
as both groups exhibited similar histologic grade, Ki67 and PR between foci. Interestingly, concordant DX RS were more likely to be 
associated with similar histologic grade and Ki67 in 89% (8/9) of bilateral BCs and 100% (6/6) of multifocal BCs. In contrast, discordant DX 
RS were more variable having similar histology grade in only 56% (5/9) and 57% (4/7) and similar Ki67 in 44% (4/9) and 43% (3/7) of 
bilateral and unilateral multifocal BCs, respectively.

Conclusions: Discordance of DX recurrence scores is common in both bilateral BC and unilateral multifocal BC. The cases with 
discordant DX RS are more likely to have variable and discrepant histologic grade and Ki67. Therefore, testing multiple foci should be 
considered particularly when histopathologic features are discrepant.

Background: Breast cancer is one of the essential diseases that pose a severe threat to women's. RAS mutations and overexpression of 
the p21Ras protein is the leading causes of cancer development and progression, which has made the RAS gene and p21Ras as essential 
targets for therapy of RAS-driven cancers. Previously, we constructed KGHV300, which carries the anti-p21Ras single-chain variable 
fragment (scFv) and two tumor-speciﬁc promoters, the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and hypoxia response element 
(HRE) promoters, and it exhibited signiﬁcant antitumor activity in several tumors including breast cancer. However, it has low targeting and 
toxic side effects on healthy tissues. It has been reported that cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells can be used as a cell carrier to carry 
poxviruses, successfully evading the body's immune surveillance and passing the vascular endothelium and tumor tissue barriers. Thus, 
the use of CIK as a carrier for adenovirus maybe solve the shortcomings of the KGHV300. 
Design: Firstly, to make the recombinant adenovirus infect CIK cells, we replaced the Fiber5 gene of skeleton virus plasmid pBHGE3 with 
Fiber35 gene of the plasmid pUC-F35 and formed a new skeleton virus plasmid pBHGE3-F35. Secondly, The plasmids pBHGE3-F35 and 
the shuttle virus plasmid pXC2p-scFv (Previously constructed) were co-transfected into HEK293 cells. The recombinant adenovirus was 
purified by Cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation and was called KGHV500. Thirdly, in vitro, the human breast cancer cell line 
MDA-MB-231 was employed to investigate the anti-tumor activity of KGHV500 using MTT, wound healing, and transwell invasion assays. 
Finally, in vivo, MDA-MB-231-transplanted tumors in nude mice were constructed and utilized to evaluate the treatment effect of the 
combination of CIK cells with KGHV500. 
Results: KGHV500 was successfully constructed and purified. In vitro, KGHV500 could signiﬁcantly inhibit proliferation, migration, and 
invasiveness and promote cell apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. In vivo, CIK combined with KGHV500 not only enhanced the anti-tumor 
effect on MDA-MB-231 cell transplanted tumor but also reduced the toxic side effects of KGHV500 on various organs.

Conclusions: CIK combined with KGHV500 could enhance the anti-breast cancer effect and safety, and it can be used as a strategy for 
the treatment of RAS-driven breast cancer in the future.

Background: Breast cancer (BC) is a hormone related cancer, among which 80% are ER+, 70% PR+ and up to 90% AR+. Aromatase 
inhibitor (AI), which inhibits conversion of androgens to estrogen at tissue level, has been shown to prolong survival of women with early 
stage or metastatic ER+ BC. PR and AR expressions seem to provide good prognosis to ER+ BC, but predictive value of AR and PR in 
ER+ metastatic BC in the setting of aromatase inhibition are not well established. 
Design: Imunohistochemical stain for AR was performed on the archival metastatic breast cancer (MBC) samples. Only women with 
biopsy proven ER+HER2- MBC, who have received AI +/- CDK4/6 inhibitors in the first line were included.  AR staining result was 
recorded as negative (<1% of tumor cells stained) orpositive (=/> 1% tumor cells stained) according to the standard for evaluation of ER. 
PR status was recorded from the original pathology report. Chart review was performed to obtain clinical data. Progress-free survival (PFS) 
was defined as the time (months) between first AI and either progression or death, or right censored at last follow-up.  Unadjusted PFS was 
estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Median PFS is reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI).  The log-rank test compared PFS over 
the follow up period.  
Results: Eighty-five cases met the eligibility criteria and had sufficient clinical follow up information. Thirty-eight (44.7%) had received 
chemotherapy and 50 (58.8%) had received anti-estrogen therapy in the perioperative settings of BC. Thirty-six (42.4%) patients received a 
CDK4/6 inhibitor combined with AI. Valid AR staining was obtained on 68 cases (56AR+, 12 AR- cases) and valid PR information 
was available on 79 cases (46 PR+, 33 PR- cases). Median PFS on AIs as the first line therapy was 14.8 (10.7, 24.5) months in AR+ BC 
vs. 13.4 (4.9, Not evaluable) months in AR- BC (p=0.68) and was 18.8 (14.8, Not evaluable) months in PR+ BC vs. 12.9 (9.0, 20.6) months 
in PR- BC (p=0.0145).  Among sixty-four cases with both valid AR and PR status, there was no evidence of an association of these two 
receptors (p=0.21).  
Conclusions: There was no significant difference between the clinical outcomes of AR+ ER+ MBC as compared to AR- ER+ MBC 
on AI as first line treatment. However, PR+ ER+ MBC was associated with better PFS as compared to PR- ER+ MBC on first line AI 
treatment suggesting a predictive value of PR with aromatase inhibition. A larger study is needed to confirm these findings.

Disclosures: Yani Wei: None; Menglan Zhang: None; Xue-Xuan Ke: None; Qiuyang Jing: None; Jiaxiu Yu: None; Bing Wei: None 
Background: Invasive breast carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation (BCND) is defined as the primary mammary neoplasm with 
expression of chromogranin (CgA) proteins and/or synaptophysin (Syn) to a greater or a lesser degree, accounting for approximately 2% to 
5% of breast cancer. Compared with invasive breast carcinomas of no special type (NST), it is more aggressive and has a worse 
prognosis. At present, molecular genetic research on BCND is limited and the molecular mechanism of BCND development needs to be 
further clarified. 
Design: We reviewed 652 invasive breast cancers with fresh tissue samples from 2013-2018 and 38 cases with BCND diagnosed in 2018. 
Then, we collected cases with ≥50% tumor cells expressing CgA and/or Syn. Finally, the whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed 
on 14 pairs (28 fresh samples) and 3 paraffin samples of BCND to identify key mutations in this unusual neoplasm. 
Results: The clean reads of 28 fresh and 3 paraffin samples accounted for more than 90% of the original testing data, the average 
sequencing error rate was less than 0.1%, and the quality of the sequencing data was more than Q30 (≥80%). Genetic analysis related to 
the characteristics of BCND shows that the most frequent mutation type (14/14) is C>T/G>A and the high frequency mutant genes 
are GATA3 (14.3%), UFL1 (14.3%), KRT32 (14.3%). High-frequency CNV analysis shows that BCND has amplification of 11q, 8q, 17q, 
19q and deletion of 17q and 11q. In addition, genetic analysis related to tumorigenesis shows that BCND has the following specific genes: 
(1) tumor susceptibility genes: PIK3CB, CARS, TSHR, EPHB2, GAS7, TNPO1; (2) tumor-driven genes: PLEC, CHD3, TP53, DNMT1, 
TRRAP, TRIO, STAT3; (3) heterozygous deletion gene: ZIC1, KDM3B, UFL1, NKX3-1. The mutated genes related to drug resistance in the 
BCND samples are: PIK3CA, ABCC6, CAT, AKT1, TP53. The sequencing results in BCND show that there are high frequency mutant 
genes with targeted drugs in other types of tumors: G6PD, CACNA1G, PDE3A, G6PD, ACE, CBFB, PIK3CA.

Conclusions: According to literature review, the current molecular studies of BCND are few and the number of cases included in each 
study is small. In this study, we showed a relatively large number of WES results of BCND. The WES results indicate that BCND has more 
specific gene changes, supporting BCND as an independent invasive breast cancer subtype. Higher throughput, massively parallel 
sequencing on larger cohorts are further needed to investigate the molecular characteristics of BCND.

Background: Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a rare subtype of breast cancer characterized by the presence of squamous, spindle 
or mesenchymal differentiation.  Most MBCs are triple negative and patients with MBCs frequently undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
(NAC). However, response to NAC has not been well studied and reported response rates have been variable.  The aim of this study was 
to evaluate response to NAC in a retrospective series of MBC. 
Design: MBCs treated with NAC at our center from 2003-2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The association between clinico-pathologic 
features and response to NAC was analyzed by Fisher’s Exact test. Survival outcomes were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. 
Results: 38 patients with MBC treated with NAC were identified. Of cases with reported subtype, 17 (45%) were matrix-producing, 8 (21%) 
squamous cell, 6 (16%) spindle cell, and 5 (13%) with mixed metaplastic components. No low-grade variants of MBC were included. Mean 
age was 50 years, 84% were clinical stage II-III, and 42% were clinically node positive. 76% (29/38) were triple negative or with low (<10%) 
hormonal receptor expression and HER2 negative on pre-NAC biopsy. 76% patients received a doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and taxol 
NAC regimen. Of 33 cases with documented responses, 49% showed clinico-radiological progression or no clinical response on NAC, and 
51% showed partial response. Two patients were downstaged from initially inoperable to lumpectomy. 74% of patients underwent 
mastectomy post NAC. 
No patients achieved pathologic complete response (pCR). One patient (matrix-producing type) had breast pCR but had residual nodal 
disease. Among patients with biopsy-proven node positive disease pre-NAC, 19% (3/16) had nodal pCR. High nuclear grade (p = 0.021) 
and matrix-producing subtype (p = 0.032) were associated with clinico-radiological response. Residual cancer burden (RCB) was assessed 
in 20 cases, 5% had RCB I, 80% had RCB II, and 15% had RCB III. Median follow-up was 19 months. 11 patients had recurrence (2 local, 
10 distant). RCB was the only factor significantly associated with recurrence-free, distant recurrence-free, overall and disease-specific 
survival.

Conclusions: Patients with metaplastic carcinoma had poor clinical and pathological response to NAC with some patients with progression 
while on NAC.  Most patients ultimately underwent mastectomy.  Metaplastic histology should be taken in consideration in the initial 
treatment planning and RCB was an important prognostic factor.

Background: HER2 gene amplification is seen in up to 20% of breast cancers (BC). HER2 is a predictive and prognostic biomarker in BC 
and accurate assessment of the HER2 status is essential. Advantages of CISH compared to FISH include use of a light microscope, 
appreciation of morphology and lower cost; however, manual evaluation is labor intensive and time consuming. We aim to study the 
practicality of automated quantification of HER2 CISH on whole slide images (WSI). 
Design: Thirty-five cases of invasive or metastatic BC with prior IHC and/or FISH testing were randomly selected to include Groups 1 and 
5 FISH cases categorized by the 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines. Subsequent manual assessment by dual-probe CISH was performed and 
categorized as Groups 1 to 5. CISH slides were scanned at 40x (0.13 um/pixel) by P250 and P1000 3DHistech (Hungary). Regions of 
interest (ROI) containing invasive cells were manually annotated and analyzed with SHIMARIS PACQ V1.2 (in-house application) for 
automated enumeration of CISH probes and HER2 status classification. The manual CISH results were compared to the automated CISH 
results. 
Results: Automated evaluation was performed on 35 cases, including 26 (74%) excisions/mastectomies, and 9 (25%) biopsies. 28 cases 
were primary diagnoses, and 7 were metastases/recurrences. The mean age was 55 years old (range 30-83). Histologic subtype was: 28 
(80%) ductal, 6 (17%) mammary, and 1 (3%) classic lobular. Of 27 cases with a documented grade, 15 were poorly, 1 moderate-poorly, 10 
moderately, and 1 was well differentiated. 
Automated CISH was concordant with manual CISH in 33/35 (94%) cases (Table 1). One case had a HER2/CEP17 ratio of 2.00 and HER2 
copy number (CN) per nuclei of 4.92 by manual, representing a borderline case for Group 1 or 4, and 1.72 ratio and 4.21 HER2 CN (Group 
4) by automated CISH. Another case showed a 3.46 ratio and 7.95 HER2 CN by manual (Group 1), and 3.19 ratio and 3.87 HER2 CN by 
automated CISH (Group 2). This case showed overlapping of nuclei, occasional tissue section folding, and weak CEP17 signal.

Conclusions: We have demonstrated the feasibility of automated HER2 CISH evaluation. Automated HER2 CISH has excellent 
concordance with manual CISH. Careful assessment of ROI, tissue processing, and signal intensity is necessary and emphasizes the 
importance of morphologic correlation in CISH. Further study in the automated platform could provide clinical efficiencies and may enable 
automated analysis in other tumors (i.e. gastric) using HER2 prognostication.

Background: The updated 2018 ASCO/CAP (the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists) clinical practice 
guidelines on HER2 testing in breast cancer recommend using more rigorous criteria by integrating immunohistochemical (IHC) and 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results and recounting FISH, aiming to eliminate the “equivocal” category. We set out to examine 
the impact of these guidelines on HER2 FISH testing at our institution. 
Design: HER2 FISH tests requiring a second count from 1/5/2015 to 31/8/2019 were identified. Tests performed after 1/7/2018 followed 
the 2018 guidelines, while tests performed prior to this date followed the 2013 guidelines as well as in- house algorithm recommending a 
second read if the HER2/CEP17 ratio is near a decision threshold or if the mean HER2 signal is ≥5 and <6. Additionally, equivocal cases 
based on a single read were also reclassified.    
Results: A total of 429 cases were identified and divided into 3 cohorts: 1) 76 cases after the introduction of the 2018 guidelines, requiring 
a second observer to recount at least 20 cells. The second read altered the FISH group designation in 14 cases (18%). However, when the 
results of the first and second counts were combined, the final group designation only changed in 2 cases (3%). Most cases (73/76, 96%) 
were considered negative; 2) 111 cases that followed the 2013 guidelines and were read by two observers according to in-house policy, 
including 106/111 (95%) equivocal, 3/111 (3%) positive and 2/111 (2%) negative cases. The 2018 guidelines reclassified all 106 equivocal 
cases as negative. The 2 negative and 3 positive cases per the 2013 guidelines remained unchanged under the 2018 guidelines; 3) 242 
cases that were classified as equivocal based on the 2013 guidelines with 2+ IHC and FISH scores by a single observer. The 2018 
guidelines reclassified 1 case as positive and 5 cases as negative. The positive case had a biphasic pattern with both amplified and non-
amplified areas. Overall, a significant number of the cases (236, 98%) required a FISH recount to establish the final HER2 status.

Conclusions: Our study suggests that the implementation of the 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines causes a significant increase in the number 
of HER2-negative cases that were previously designated as equivocal. With the altered testing algorithms, the equivocal category is 
effectively eliminated and the assessment of HER2 status is simplified, especially in cases with non-classical amplification patterns. 
290 HER2 FISH Signal Degradation: A Ten Year Retrospective Study

Disclosures: Jessie Wu: None; Gulisa Turashvili: None; Gulisa Turashvili: None; Gulisa Turashvili: None; Gulisa Turashvili: None 
Background: Approximately 25% of invasive breast carcinomas are positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). 
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis is recommended for equivocal cases via immunohistochemistry. However, there is a 
dearth of literature on the retention and storage requirements for HER2 FISH slides. Existing guidelines vary widely among countries and 
laboratories with no supportive evidence. This study aims to determine the degradation of HER2 FISH signals in an effort to determine 
optimal retention time and storage conditions.  
Design: Dual-probe HER2 FISH slides from March 2009 to June 2019 were retrieved to assess the presence, intensity and quantity of the 
signals under dual and single Chroma Filters (PathVysion HER2 DNA Probe Kit; CEP17 probe - Vysis CEP17 SpectrumGreen Vysis, 
HER2 probe - LSI HER2/neu Spectrum Orange). At our institution, FISH slides are placed in slideboxes and stored in -80C freezers for at 
least 4 years. Older slides are stored at room temperature. 
Results: After excluding HER2 FISH slides that were deemed uninterpretable due to technical issues, a total of 6255 slides were 
assessed. Slides from 2009 to 2014 were stored at room temperature, while slides from 2015 to 2019 were stored in -80C freezers. Slides 
stored in freezers showed retention of both the green and the orange signals. Slide stored at room temperature demonstrated significant 
decrease in the signal retention rate and the loss of signal did not progress in a linear fashion. The green CEP17 signal was quenched 
much faster than the orange HER2 signal.

Conclusions: Our study is the first to demonstrate HER2 FISH signal degradation with time and slide storage conditions. Storing HER2 
FISH slides in -80C freezer allows for retention of both HER2 and CEP17 signals. At room temperature, the signals start to degrade with 
CEP17 signals lost at a faster rate. The results of the study may be used in official guidelines for retention time and storage conditions for 
HER2 FISH slides.

Disclosures: Libo Yang: None; Madhuchhanda Roy: None; Constance Albarracin: None; Lei Huo: None; Isabelle Bedrosian: None; Hong 
Bu: None; Yun Wu: None 
Background: A uniform classification framework for neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) in all the organ systems has been recently 
proposed by an International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel. This 
classification framework will also be applied to NENs of the breast in the upcoming new WHO classification of the tumors of the breast. 
Based on the new classification system, the NENs of the breast will be divided into well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and 
poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), which would include large cell NEC and small cell carcinoma. NETs will be 
furthered graded as G1, G2 or G3 based on the mitotic count and/or Ki-67 proliferation index.  
Design: The surveillance, epidemiology and end results (SEER) database released on November 2018 was used for this study. Between 
2003 and 2016, 296 NENs (NET=180, NEC=116) of the breast and 462,055 of invasive carcinoma, NST were identified. Survival analysis 
was performed for disease specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS). Survival for NET, NEC and NST were compared with different 
histology, grade and clinical stage. 
Results: NET and NEC of the breast had significantly worse disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) than invasive 
carcinoma, NST (p<0.001) (Figures 1A and 1B). Within the NETs of the breast, the grade I, II, III NETs had worse DSS and OS than 
corresponding grade I, II, III invasive carcinoma, NST (all p<0.001) (Figures 1A and 1B). Within the same clinical stage, stage I, II, III NETs 
and NECs of the breast had worse DSS and OS than corresponding stage I, II, III invasive carcinoma, NST (p<0.001) (Figures 2A -2F). 
Figure 1 - 291

Figure 2 - 291 
 
Conclusions: The universal classification framework for NEN allowed us to further refine the breast carcinoma with neuroendocrine 
differentiation as a unique pathologic and clinical entity, which has worse clinical outcome compared to invasive carcinoma, NST. 
292 Active Surveillance Clinical Trial for Mammary Low Risk DCIS: The Implication of the Degree of 
Central Necrosis

Disclosures: Haiying Zhan: None; Marie Quinn: None; Xuan Peng: None; Li Yan: None; Thaer Khoury: None 
Background: In the current active surveillance clinical trial for low risk DCIS, specifically COMET trial, comedo necrosis was recently 
omitted as an exclusion criterion. The purpose of this study is to investigate the consequences of this change by correlating the degree of 
DCIS central necrosis (CN) and the rate of upgrade on the excisional biopsy (EB). 
Design: We applied the clinical inclusion criteria of the COMET clinical trial on our patients who were mammographically screened 
between 2007 and 2017.  Histologic findings on the core needle biopsy (CNB) were recorded. For the degree of CN, we measured the 
diameter and the area size for both the CN and the ductal space. Then we calculated the ratio diameter of the CN/the ductal space, and the 
ratio area size of CN/ ductal space. The span of calcifications was measured on the mammography images. Upgrade to high risk residual 
disease was identified when invasive carcinoma (IC) and/or high grade DCIS was identified on the EB. We defined comedo necrosis using 
30% cutoff. We correlated the recorded variables with the upgrade, first including all cases (n=129), and then excluding cases with comedo 
necrosis (n=76). We also correlated the pathologic and radiologic variables with the IC and with no residual disease separately. 
Results: In 129 DCIS cases, 26 (20.2%) had upgrade, 12 (9.3%) to IC, and 14 (10.9%) to high grade DCIS.  The rate of upgrade including 
cases with no comedo necrosis was 13 of 76 (17.1%). When all cases were included in the analysis, larger calcification span correlated 
with upgrade with median and range of 1.7 (0.1 to 3.3) for upgrade vs. 0.9 (0.1 to 5.6) for no upgrade (p=0.02). The best cutoff of 
 
 
291 
calcification span on mammography to predict upgrade was 1.1-cm with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.648. However, when we excluded 
cases with comedo necrosis, none of the variables was statistically significant. The following variables predicted IC including number of 
spaces with CN (p=0.047) and diameter ratio of CN (p=0.041) but not the area size ratio (p=0.074). The following variables predicted no 
residual disease including less number of spaces with CN (p=0.006), smaller CN diameter ratio (p=0.004), and smaller calcification span 
(p<0.001). 
Conclusions: Changing the inclusion criteria in the COMET trial to include any degree of necrosis did not affect on the rate of upgrade. 
However, the criteria of the span of calcifications may need to be reviewed. We recommend conducting a larger multi-institutional study to 
evaluate our results. 
293 Touching Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Low Risk Ductal Carcinoma In Situ Detected in a 
Setting Resembling Active Surveillance Clinical Trials for Low Risk DCIS Correlates with Upgrade to 
High Grade DCIS

Background: Active surveillance clinical trials for low risk DCIS have been recently initiated. It is important to identify ways to predict cases 
with high risk residual disease. Dense touching tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has been shown to correlate with the nuclear grade. 
We hypothesize that higher number of touching TILs in a low risk DCIS detected in a core needle biopsy (CNB) could predict a high grade 
(HG) DCIS in the excisional biopsy (EB). 
Design: We applied the clinical inclusion criteria of the COMET clinical trial on our patients who were mammographically screened 
between 2007 and 2017. Histologic findings on the CNB were recorded. Touching TILs were assessed by counting the number of TILs 
touching the ductal basement membrane or away from it by one lymphocyte cell thickness. TILs density was calculated as average number 
of TILs per DCIS ducts. We also counted the highest TILs around a single duct. The degree of circumferential TILs was estimated on a 
scale from 0 to 3 with the later showing complete cuffing of TILs around the ductal space. The mammographic images were reviewed and 
the span of calcifications was measured. The EB was reviewed and DCIS was graded from low to high. The pathologic and radiologic 
variables were correlated with HG-DCIS vs. others [no residual disease, invasive carcinoma (IC) or non-HG-DCIS]. 
Results: In a total of 129 DCIS cases, 26 (20.2%) had upgrade, 12 (9.3%) to IC, and 14 (10.9%) to HG DCIS. All cases with DCIS 
accompanying IC were low to intermediate grade. The median and range of the average number of TILs in cases which were upgraded to 
HG-DCIS was 4.5 (0 to 20) vs. 2 (0 to 16) for those without upgrade (p=0.004). The best cutoff was 3 cells with AUC of 0.732. The median 
and range of the highest number of TILs around a single duct in cases which were upgraded to HG-DCIS was 12 (1 to 118) vs. 6 (0 to 95) 
for those without HG-DCIS (p=0.016). The best cutoff was 9 cells with AUC of 0.699. All other variables did not correlate with upgrade. 
Circumferential and touching (average or highest number) TILs did not correlate with the overall upgrade to HG-DCIS and/or IC. 
Conclusions: Touching TILs detected in low risk DCIS correlates with upgrade to HG-DCIS, but not with upgrade to IC. More studies with 
larger number of cases are warranted to examine our findings. 
294 Significance of HER2 in Microinvasive Carcinoma of Breast: A Single Academic Institution 
Experience

Disclosures: Huina Zhang: None; Ioana Moisini: None; Bradley Turner: None; Xi Wang: None; David Hicks: None 
Background: It has been reported that HER2 overexpression/amplification is highly prevalent in the microinvasive carcinoma of breast 
compared with both invasive carcinoma (pT1a and above) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). However, the significance of HER2 in the 
microinvasive carcinoma has rarely been addressed. The aim of this study was to investigate whether HER2 positivity is associated with 
any specific clinicopathologic features and follow-up outcomes, in comparison to the HER2 negative counterparts. 
Design: Cases with diagnosis of microinvasive carcinoma of breast were retrospectively identified between 2007 and 2019. The 
clinicopathologic characteristics (age, lymph node status, DCIS component, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), hormonal receptors (HR), 
HER2 status and Ki-67) and follow-up information were collected and analyzed. 
Results: Forty-two cases of microinvasive carcinoma with available HR and HER2 status were identified including 14 HER2 positive and 
28 HER2 negative cases (23 HR+/HER2- and 5 HR-/HER2-). Neither patient age at diagnosis nor number of microinvasive carcinoma foci 
 
 
292 
showed significant difference between HER2 positive and negative groups (Table 1). The majority of microinvasive carcinoma cases were 
associated with a large volume of intermediate to high grade, solid and/or cribriform type of DCIS with central necrosis, regardless of HER2 
status (Table 1). The presence of moderate to abundant amount of TILs and the Ki-67 expression were significantly increased in the HER2 
positive cases (Table 1). Nodal metastasis was found in two cases (4.7%) and none of the HER2 positive cases had nodal metastasis. 
Clinical follow-up showed that the majority of patients with HER2 positive disease (78%, 11/14) did not receive HER2 targeted therapy. All 
42 patients were alive without disease recurrence/distant metastasis, with an average follow up of 42 months.

Conclusions: Similar to larger HER2 positive invasive breast carcinomas, HER2 positivity in microinvasive carcinoma is associated with 
triggering a host immune response and increased tumor cell proliferation. In contrast to HER2-positive invasive carcinomas of higher stage, 
HER2 overexpression in microinvasive carcinomas appears to not be associated with metastasis/recurrence compared to HER2 negative 
microinvasive disease in our series. Whether or not HER2-targeted therapy is warranted in this clinical setting merits additional study.   
295 Immune Cells Subpopulations in Tumor Microenvironment and their Prognostic Value in Triple 
Negative Breast Cancer

Disclosures: Lin Zhang: None; Xiaohong Iris Wang: None; Songlin Zhang: None 
Background: Immune response mediates tumor progression and response to treatment, and the immune cell composition in tumor 
microenvironment is diverse including lymphocytes, macrophages, and other cell types. We have shown that tumor infiltrating lymphocytes 
(TILs), tumor infiltrating lymphocytes volume (TILV), and regulatory T cells (Tregs) have positive prognostic value in triple negative breast 
cancer (TNBC). In this study, we further evaluate the prognostic significance of B lymphocytes, plasma cells, tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAM), and CD4/CD8 ratio in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). 
Design: Tissue microarrays from fifty-eight TNBC patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy (NACT) were prepared. 
Immunohistochemistry was performed to study the immune cell subpopulations. The statistic and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were 
performed. 
Results: CD163+ TAM, but not CD68+ TAM, are associated with smaller tumor size (p=0.02), higher pathologic complete response (pCR) 
rate (p=0.009), and better overall survival (p=0.03). CD20+ B lymphocytes correlate with smaller tumor size (p=0.007) and higher pCR rate 
(p=0.04). CD20+ B lymphocytes also correlate with lower stage and better overall survival but with no statistical significance (p=0.1 
and p=0.07, respectively). CD4/CD8 ratio reversely correlates with pCR rate, but it has no association with tumor size, stage, or overall 
survival. High CD138+ plasma cells are associated with high pCR rate. TNBC cases with two or more favored parameters (TILV and/or 
TILs, CD163, Tregs or CD20) have much better overall survival (p=0.02). 
Conclusions: TILV and/or TILs, Tregs, B lymphocytes, and CD163 TAM are predictive and prognostic biomarkers in TNBC 
microenvironment and can be used to predict the pCR rate and overall survival. Evaluation of these parameters will optimize risk 
stratification and therapeutic efficacy for TNBC patients. Large-scale studies are undergoing to validate these findings.

Background: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a common form of non-invasive breast cancer. With the widespread adoption of 
population-based breast cancer screening, it represents approximately 20-25% of all new breast neoplastic lesions diagnosed. The natural 
history of DCIS is poorly understood and risk of DCIS progress to invasive carcinoma is remain unknown. The goal of this study is to 
determine the invasive cancer upstaging rates at excision for women diagnosed with DCIS on biopsy. 
Design: Cases of DCIS diagnosed from 2010 to 2012 in out institution were respectively reviewed. Patients diagnosed with DCIS with 
synchronous invasive ductal carcinoma, DCIS with microinvasion or patient with no surgical excision were excluded. Patient demographic 
information including age, race, family history and imaging results were recorded. Surgical pathology reports were reviewed for upstaging 
to invasive disease. 
Results: The study group included 258 patients with DCIS diagnosed by core needle biopsy. The median age at diagnosis of DCIS was 
58.1 years (range, 29-90 years).  62.8% were Caucasian women and 16.7% were African American. Histologically, 45.3% of the case were 
high grade, 75.5% containing comedonecrosis, 82.1% were ER positive and 71.2% were PR positive. 16.7% patients underwent 
lumpectomy and 83.3% patients underwent mastectomy. The total upstage rate from DCIS to invasive disease was 15.5% 
(40/258):  histologically 6.5% for low grade, 38.7% for intermediate grade and 54.8% for high grade DCIS. 24 patients had recurrent 
disease, among them 9 patients had recurrence of invasive carcinoma and 10 patients had recurrence of DCIS. There were 36 patients 
eligible for the COMET Trial, 34 for the LORIS Trial and 8 for the LORD Trial. The upgrade rate to an invasive carcinoma was 5.5% (2/36) 
for COMET, 5.8% (2/34) for LORIS and 0% (0/8) for LORD eligible cases (Table 1).

Conclusions: The upgrade rate of the whole study is low (15.5%). Patients selected according to the criteria of COMET, LORIS and LORD 
showed significant decrease of the upgrade rate to invasive carcinoma. The result of this study may suggest that careful patient selection 
for DCIS active surveillance trails carries a low risk of missing occult invasive carcinoma.

Short Hills, NJ, 4Weill Cornell, New York, NY 
Disclosures: Elaine Zhong: None; James Solomon: None; Esther Cheng: None; Jordan Baum: None; Wei Song: None; Syed Hoda: None 
Background: AP-LCIS is distinguished by “pleomorphic” discohesive cells with (w/) abundant granular eosinophilic (“apocrine”) cytoplasm 
& prominent nucleoli; & is usually accompanied by necrosis & calcifications (calcs). Although some features have been recently described 
(Am J Surg Pathol 2019;43:399-408, others), the entity is yet to be fully characterized.  
Design: The departmental data were searched for AP-LCIS (excluding concomitant ductal carcinoma [ca]), over 10-years (7/2010-6/2019). 
All were E-cadherin (-) & p120 cytoplasmic (+). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for ER, PR, HER2, Ki67, AR, & aurora kinase A (AURKA, a 
key regulator of cell cycle) was performed. AURKA was assessed for nuclear staining. Key slides were macrodissected & tested by the 
Oncomine Comprehensive Assay v2 (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). 
Results: 11 cases of pure AP-LCIS, all females & none bilateral, were evaluated (Figure 1). Mean age: 64 (range 46-76). 9/11 (82%) 
presented w/ calcs on screening. 5 (45%) had necrosis, 9 (82%) had calcs. 7 (64%) had concomitant classic LCIS & 5 (45%) florid 
LCIS. Table 1 & Figure 1 show other IHC results. 9 (82%) were sequenced (Figure 2). Mean number of variants: 2.4. 8 had local excision, 
1 mastectomy, 1 radiation, & 0 chemotherapy. In a mean followup of 57 mo, 2 AP-LCIS recurred & 1 had invasive (inv) lobular ca. AURKA 
showed 1-5% nuclear (+) in 3 (27%) of AP-LCIS & was not significantly associated w/ invasion or recurrence (Pearson correlation). 
23 AP-LCIS w/ concurrent inv lobular ca (13 pleomorphic, 13 classic), all females & none bilateral, were also evaluated. Mean age: 66 
(range: 49-83). 15 (65%) presented w/ calcs. 18 (78%) were sequenced. Mean number of variants: 3.3. 2 patients had known germline 
mutation present in tumor: 1 BRCA1 & 1 ATM. There was no significant difference in IHC or mean number of variants of AP-LCIS w/ & w/o 
inv ca (Chi-square test, Student’s t-test). AURKA(+) in 9 (43%) in this set of AP-LCIS was not significantly associated w/ nodal positivity 
(seen in 3 cases) (Pearson correlation). No patient had distant metastasis or died of disease.

Background: Metaplastic breast carcinomas (MBCs) are a rare and histologically heterogenous group of breast cancers. Although most 
MBCs are triple negative, the clinicopathological features diverse among different subtypes. The histological diversity of MBC may be 
related to different genetic background of each subtype. To improve the understanding of biological characteristics of MBC, four histological 
subtypes of MBCs were analyzed. 
Design: 22 MBCs, including ten squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), three matrix-producing carcinomas (MPCs), four low grade 
fibromatosis-like spindle cell carcinomas (FLSCCs) and five moderate to high grade spindle cell carcinomas (SpCCs) were sequenced by 
DIAN (Hangzhou Lab) using a 324-gene platform (FoundationOneCDx) with licensed technologies. The results were compared with other 
triple-negative breast cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. 
Results: The results showed that SCCs had the highest mutation load among four subtypes(9-29 mutations/case, mean 14.7/case). Genes 
with high frequency mutations were TP53 (9/10,90%),PIK3CA (7/10,70%),MLL2、PTCH1、TSC1、STK11、SPEN、PTEN(each 
gene3/10,30%) and FGF3 amplification(3/10,30%). MPCs had high frequency mutations of TP53(3/3,100%), BRCA1(2/3,67%) 
and CDKN2A deletion(2/3,67%), RAD21 amplification(2/3,67%). Hotspot mutations in PIK3CA(SpCCs4/5,80%, FLSCCs 3/4,75%) 
and TERT promoter (SpCCs4/5,80%, FLSCCs 3/4,75%) were found in spindle cell carcinoma including both SpCCs and FLSCCs. 
However, SpCCs also had a pathogenic mutation of HRAS(3/5,60%) and copy number variation 
of MTAP deletion(4/5,80%),CDKN2B deletion(4/5,80%)and CDKN2A deletion(4/5,80%), suggesting that the unique genetic alteration of 
SpCCs may lead to higher degree of malignancy than FLSCCs. Compared with the common mutated genes of triple-negative breast 
cancer in TCGA database(TP53153/171,89%, PIK3CA12/171,7%), mutation frequency of TP53 in SpCCs(1/5,20%) and FLSCCs (0%) was 
much lower,while there was no PIK3CA mutation in MPCs. SpCCs(4/5,80%) and FLSCCs(3/4,75%) had more TERT promoter mutations 
than other triple-negative breast cancers.

Figure 2 - 297 
 
Conclusions: Our study reveals that the genetic changes of MBCs are significantly different from those of other triple-negative breast 
cancers. Different histological subtypes of MBCs have their own characteristics of genetic mutation. The histological and biological diversity 
may be related to its genetic heterogeneity.

Background: Platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) improves pathologic complete response (pCR) in triple-negative breast 
cancer (TNBC). It would be helpful to personalize the use of platinum agents if a predictive biomarker for platinum sensitivity could be 
developed. However, these data are limited. Previous studies showed DNA homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) was a potential 
biomarker predicting pCR in ER-negative breast cancer. Therefore, we try to develop a HRD gene expression score to predict the tumor 
sensitivity to platinum-based NACT in TNBC.  
Design: A retrospective cohort of 127 TNBC patients from 2012 to 2017 were included in this study. All of them were diagnosed and 
received platinum-based NACT in Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. Clinical data and pathological data of the patients were 
collected and reviewed. By using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), the HRD associated gene 
expression level, e.g. RAD51, XRCC5, RIF1, PARPBP, PARP1, BRCA1 etc, were analyzed from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 
core needle biopsy samples which obtained before NACT. A random forest model was built to estimate the weight of each gene expression 
level and clinical-pathological factors. Samples were randomized into the training set and validation set with different splitting percentage 
from 50%:50% to 90%:10%. The training set was used to modulate parameters and select the best model using 5-fold cross validation. The 
performance of the final model was evaluated in the validation set. 
Results: A 4-gene (BRCA1, XRCC5, PARP1, RAD51) expression signature scoring system was developed. Higher score TNBC had 
nearly quadruple likelihood to achieve pCR to platinum-based NACT compared with a lower score [odds ratio(OR)=3.878; P<0.001]. At the 
cut-off value of -2.644, the 4-gene score system showed high sensitivity for predicting pCR in breast (93.0%) and pCR in both 
breast/axilla (91.8%), while, at the cut-off value of -1.969, the 4-gene score system showed high specificity for predicting pCR in 
breast (85.7%) and pCR in both breast/axilla (80.8%) (Table 1). Additionally, Ki-67≥40% (OR=4.569; P=0.028) and N stage(OR=2.279; 
P=0.009) were also independent predictors of pCR. The 4-gene score was positively correlated with Ki-67≥40% (P=0.002), but negatively 
correlated with positive lymph nodes counts (P=0.003) .
