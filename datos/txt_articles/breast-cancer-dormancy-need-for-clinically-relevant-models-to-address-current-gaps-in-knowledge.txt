Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the USA. Although advances in treatment over the past several decades
have signiﬁcantly improved the outlook for this disease, most women who are diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive disease
remain at risk of metastatic relapse for the remainder of their life. The cellular source of late relapse in these patients is thought to
be disseminated tumor cells that reactivate after a long period of dormancy. The biology of these dormant cells and their natural
history over a patient’s lifetime is largely unclear. We posit that research on tumor dormancy has been signiﬁcantly limited by the
lack of clinically relevant models. This review will discuss existing dormancy models, gaps in biological understanding, and propose
criteria for future models to enhance their clinical relevance.

THE CLINICAL PROBLEM OF BREAST CANCER DORMANCY
Nearly 300,000 new breast cancer cases are diagnosed each year
in the USA1. Although breast cancer affects many women, those
diagnosed with disease localized to the breast have a very
favorable prognosis, with a ten-year survival rate above 95%1.
However, the ten-year survival rate does not fully capture the
long-term outcomes for these women. In particular, in women
whose breast cancers that express the estrogen receptor (ER+),
late relapses are common. This contrasts with those with estrogen
receptor negative (ER-) cancer where the risk of recurrence peaks
in year 2 post diagnosis (Fig. 1a). Late relapse in women with ER+
breast cancer is thought to result from the activation of dormant
tumor cells at metastatic sites such as the bone marrow2; and
about 20% of women with ER+ disease have a recurrence 15
years or more after initial diagnosis3. Even more striking is that
the relative risk of recurrence is constant over at least 20 years,
and this risk is proportional to the initial nodal status (Fig. 1b).
These data indicate that women with ER+ breast cancer face a
lifelong risk of recurrence. The central role of tumor dormancy in
mediating these late recurrences highlights the importance of
developing effective approaches to target dormant tumor cells.
The development of such approaches will depend on a more
thorough understanding of the biology of dormancy, including
cell-intrinsic
and
microenvironmental
factors
that
maintain
dormancy or that facilitate escape from dormancy. Research
focused on tumor dormancy has been limited by the lack of
clinically relevant models. This article will review existing in vitro
and mouse models of breast cancer dormancy, highlight their
advantages and limitations, identify gaps in the current knowl-
edge, and suggest criteria to enhance clinical relevance for future
studies.
Disseminated tumor cells: Clinical samples and systems
biology
At present, there is no widely used method to monitor the
dormant state (also called minimal residual disease) or to predict
the probability of late recurrence in women with newly diagnosed
breast cancer. Several multigene expression signatures (Oncotype
DX, MammaPrint, Genomic Grade Index) are used clinically to
stratify patients based on the risk of recurrence and to inform the
use of chemotherapy in early-stage breast cancer4,5. Although
intrinsic molecular subtypes identiﬁed by these assays are
predictive of proliferative potential, the risk of early recurrence,
and treatment efﬁcacy, they cannot discern the risk of late
recurrence. There have been reports that certain molecular
signatures of primary tumors can distinguish between early and
late recurrence risk, but these have yet to enter clinical practice6–8.
Furthermore, the minimal overlap between these gene lists,
suggests the possibility of overﬁtting and lack of universal
biological relevance9.
A more direct assay predictive of tumor recurrence involves the
serial monitoring of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or cell-free DNA
in serum samples. CTCs are shed from the primary tumor and/or
occult metastatic sites into the bloodstream and can be identiﬁed
in a simple blood draw. The persistence or appearance of CTCs
following adjuvant therapy is associated with signiﬁcantly lower
disease-free and overall survival. The 4-year disease-free survival
rate for CTC-negative patients was 92.9%, whereas those with
more than 5 CTCs in 30 mL of blood had a 71.9% 4-year disease-
free survival10. CTCs have also been found in patients who were
disease free up to 22 years after mastectomy11. This implies that
there is a source of tumor cells that are shed into the circulation
even when a patient is asymptomatic. Similarly, circulating cell-
free DNA with copy number variations associated with the
primary tumor have been detected 12 years after diagnosis
despite no other evidence of disease12. As with CTCs, detection of
cell-free DNA is predictive of overall survival and progression-free
survival13.
Another clinically accessible source of tumor cells in patients
with minimal residual disease is the bone marrow. Tumor cells that
have disseminated to an organ such as bone marrow are known
as disseminated tumor cells (DTCs). DTCs can be detected in bone

marrow biopsies or bone marrow aspirates by virtue of their
expression of epithelial markers such as EpCAM and pan-
cytokeratin. Approximately 60% of ER+ patients with metastatic
relapse exhibit bone metastasis as the ﬁrst site of disease
recurrence14. The propensity of patients with ER+ disease to
suffer bone metastasis, as well as the presence of DTCs in the
bone marrow of breast cancer patients, suggests that DTCs in the
bone may be the major source of CTCs and cell-free DNA
shedding and may cause late relapse. When one considers the
sampling error inherent in taking 1–4 mL of an organ of
approximately 3 L total volume15 (0.03–0.12%), it is likely that a
much higher percentage of patients with ER+ breast cancer harbor
DTCs in the bone marrow.
Approximately 30% of patients with ductal carcinoma in situ
(DCIS) harbor detectable DTCs in the bone marrow16, and these
patients have a much higher risk of mortality than the general
population which persists for at least 15 years following DCIS
diagnosis17. The number of DTCs and their mutational burden are
very similar between patients with ductal carcinoma in situ and
with invasive breast cancer18. These observations suggest that
bone marrow dissemination is an early event in breast carcino-
genesis, a ﬁnding with important implications for early detection
and screening. Although detection of DTCs is associated with an
increased risk of recurrence, these cells may remain dormant for
long periods: In one study, 30% of patients with detectable DTCs
at diagnosis did not suffer cancer recurrence within 15 years19.
There are two hypothesized types of cancer dormancy. The
cellular dormancy model posits that tumor cells exit the cell cycle
and remain in a growth-arrested state. An alternative hypothesis,
referred to as tumor mass dormancy, holds that dormancy occurs
when the proliferation rate of DTCs is countered by an equivalent
rate of cell loss that results in a stable microscopic tumor mass.
Support for the ﬁrst model is provided by several studies that
have demonstrated the quiescent nature of DTCs20. In contrast,
there is little clinical evidence for tumor mass dormancy. Deﬁning
the underlying characteristics of tumor dormancy in patients is
critical to developing pre-clinical models that accurately reﬂect
this biology.
From a systems biology perspective, dormancy is a phenotypic
choice. In order to become dormant and survive in the foreign
microenvironment of the metastatic niche, cells must have
plasticity;
they
cannot
be
irreversibly
wedded
to
a
given
physiological state but instead must undergo dynamic transitions.
Such plastic cells, including cancer stem cells (CSCs), exist in primary
tumors21 and may arise via de-differentiation during the epithelial-
mesenchymal transition (EMT)22. Recent work, utilizing computa-
tional modeling and direct experimentation, has demonstrated a
nuanced connection between EMT status and plasticity. Cells that
exhibit hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) features23 have a
higher probability of attaining stemness24–27, relative to cells
exhibiting pronounced mesenchymal features.
p38 kinase and p21 function have been implicated in the
cellular dormancy program, p21 is required to maintain relevant
classes of stem cells, and mathematical models of the cell cycle
predict that inhibitors such as p21 can block proliferation28,29.
There is also signiﬁcant literature on the analysis of circuits that
control stemness versus differentiation30. Various investigators
have formulated network models of drug resistance, for example,
to PI3K inhibitors in breast cancer31. Finally, there have been major
advances in the computational modeling of EMT and how it
couples to factors that control stemness24,32. Somewhat surpris-
ingly, there has been little effort to put these pieces together to
create a quantitative picture of how these circuits interact and
how they collectively respond to the chemical and mechanical
microenvironment. Thus, to date, computational studies have not
adequately addressed the most critical questions facing the
dormancy ﬁeld, such as the key differences between cell
autonomous processes and key microenvironmental signals that
distinguish between early metastasis or long-term dormancy with
the possibility of recurrence. This is a key area for further research
that will complement and inform experimental approaches to
understand dormancy.
Dormancy, cancer stem cells, and metabolic plasticity
The functional deﬁnition of a CSC is a cell capable of tumor
initiation and generation of functional heterogeneous cell
populations. There is substantial evidence that breast cancers
display a hierarchical cellular organization driven by CSCs33. CSCs
also
drive
tumor
metastasis
and
contribute
to
treatment
resistance33. Just as normal tissue stem cells are tightly regulated
by their microenvironment or “niche”, CSCs that are dissemi-
nated in distant tissues may be regulated by signals originating
from their niche. This suggests that CSCs entering into or exiting
from dormancy may be dependent on the crosstalk between
tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental factors including stro-
mal cells, the vascular system (angiogenic dormancy), and
immune cells (immunologic dormancy) as described in the
review by Clements et al.34.
EMT is a likely contributor to tumor cell dissemination from the
primary site, though there has been some debate in the literature
as to whether it is absolutely necessary35. There is, however, a
well-established connection between EMT and the acquisition of
stem-like properties22,24. Two different subsets of breast CSCs

(BCSC) have been identiﬁed by our group. Mesenchymal BCSCs
(M-BCSC, CD44+/CD24-) have a slow proliferating, quiescent
phenotype, whereas the epithelial BCSCs (E-BCSC, ALDH+) are
more proliferative36. This is consistent with the observation that
DTCs in patients have the M-BCSC phenotype indicative of
quiescence37. We note in passing that whether EMT states are best
described as forming a continuum or just a rich spectrum of
hybrid versus fully differentiated phenotypes is still uncertain; this
does not affect our assertion that as stem-like cells move towards
the epithelial end of the spectrum, they adapt their metabolic
strategy in well-deﬁned manners. Interestingly, recent evidence
suggests these different subsets have different metabolic proﬁles
and differential sensitivity to glycolysis or redox metabolism
inhibition38. Speciﬁcally, M-BCSCs have low levels of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and enhanced glycolytic regulatory enzyme
expression, whereas E-BCSCs harbor signiﬁcantly elevated levels of
ROS and enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and
deploy NRF2-mediated antioxidant defense mechanisms. More-
over, oxidant stressors (i.e., 2-DG, H2O2, hypoxia) or antioxidants
(i.e., N-acetyl cysteine) are able to induce a transition between
M-BCSCs and E-BCSCs. These redox-regulated CSC state transitions
are closely linked to the expression or stabilization of key redox-
regulated proteins including AMPK, HIF-1, and NRF2.
Computational studies have contributed to our understanding
of basic metabolic processes in cancer cells. The most common
approach, known as Flux Balance Analysis39, aims to solve the
ﬂuxes traversing comprehensive networks of metabolic reactions
under the assumption that the cell optimizes some predetermined
quantity such as biomass production rate. One of the goals of
these models has been to explain the Warburg effect, which is the
observation that cancer cells are characterized by aerobic
glycolysis40. These efforts have been only partially satisfactory41
as the models need to be augmented by additional somewhat
arbitrary assumptions before agreeing with results of experimental
efforts42. Importantly, computational frameworks are insufﬁcient
for addressing some of the most relevant questions that arise in
the context of dormant cells. That is, cancer metabolism is
adaptive in response to external conditions and changes in cell
phenotype. Thus, altering the metabolic state is a crucial part of
enabling survival in the dormant stem-like state (as has been
readily established in the context of drug resistance43,44) and
subsequently enabling transitions back to growth and differentia-
tion under speciﬁc additional stimuli.
Studying the plasticity of CSCs and DTCs requires the coupling
of genetic decision-making circuits to metabolic processes. A
mathematical formalism to enable such modeling has recently
been proposed with an initial focus on the interplay between the
master regulators AMPK and HIF1 in controlling the balance
between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)45
(Fig. 2). One of the outcomes of the study was the recognition that
cells need not have a binary choice but can mix and match
processes to generate needed energy and biomolecular building
blocks as they react to local conditions. This model predicted the
existence of a metabolically inactive phenotype that is character-
ized by low levels of HIF-1 and AMPK and low activity of glycolysis
and OXPHOS, termed low-low, that was subsequently veriﬁed in
the context of drug-tolerant melanoma cells43. The model also
predicts the existence of a hybrid metabolic state in which cells
exhibit high levels of HIF-1 and AMPK and high activity of
glycolysis and OXPHOS. This hybrid metabolic state has been
associated with the hybrid E/M phenotype. Whether the low-low
phenotype corresponds to M-BCSCs entry into dormancy in vivo
remains to be clariﬁed. Interestingly, the model’s prediction that
the antioxidant protein NRF2 is highly expressed in the hybrid E/M
phenotype46 is consistent with the observation that the levels of
NRF2 are high in the proliferative E-BCSCs that effectively uses
OXPHOS.

Abundant data have established relationships between EMT
and metabolism. For example, the EMT transcription factor SNAIL
directly represses expression of the gene encoding the fructose
bisphosphatase FBP147. FBP1 repression leads to reduced oxygen
consumption and ROS production and to increased glycolysis and
biomass synthesis. The fact that EMT can lead to an increased
reliance on glycolysis is consistent with ﬁndings that partial EMT
can lead to stem-like behaviors. The genetic circuits encoding
dormancy, stemness, and EMT need to be integrated with
metabolism models. Unfortunately, unlike the relative maturity
of single-cell transcriptomics, single-cell metabolomics is still in its
infancy, and data to build these models will have to be inferred
from less direct measurements. It is clear that metabolic switches
play important roles in EMT and production of CSCs, that therefore
constitutes an area of research crucial for both understanding and
targeting dormancy.
The role of the microenvironment
The microenvironment at the metastatic site plays a critical role in
the establishment and maintenance of dormancy as well as exit
from the dormant state. There is evidence that DTCs occupy
various niches in the bone marrow including those generally
occupied
by
developing
hematopoietic
stem
cells48,
bone
endosteal surfaces49,50, and perivascular regions51,52 (Fig. 3).
Evidence for immune regulation of tumor dormancy has been
recently reported and summarized in a review authored by
Ombrato et al.53. It is clear that immune cells provide both
stimulatory and inhibitory cues to DTCs, which in turn interact
with immune-regulatory cells54. From a conceptual perspective,
there are two different but connected issues: First, tumor cells are
identiﬁed as foreign by the effector arms of the immune
response55 and, second, a complex web of tumor cells of various
phenotypes and different immune cells establish the tumor-
immune interplay56.
Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells can recognize cancer cells via MHC-I-
dependent presentation of antigens that can arise via mutational
events (cancer neoantigens) or over-expression57. The recognition
of over-expressed factors relies on the lack of perfect negative
selection in the thymus58. It is likely that both different clones and
different phenotypes within a given clone vary in their degree of
visibility. For example, it has been established that non-small cell
lung cancer cells down-regulate antigen presentation when
undergoing EMT59. Dormant cells in ER+ breast cancer may evade
immune recognition, which could be crucial for maintaining a
dormant cell population. Various algorithms (the best known is
NetMHCpan60) based on machine-learning approaches exist that
can reasonably predict the binding of peptides to MHC. Also,
attempts are underway to devise computational approaches to
determine binding speciﬁcities between displayed peptides and T
cell receptors61. To date, none of these new methods have been
applied in the context of the differential recognition of dormant
versus proliferative cells.
The dynamics of cancer cell recognition by the immune system
can be modeled as a population-level competition between the
tumor and the immune system. This process has typically been
studied using coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that
govern the temporal evolution between the populations62–64.
These models predict a transition between an equilibrium state,
where tumor cell proliferation is balanced by immune cell killing
(analogous to bulk dormancy), and immune escape where
immunity fails. Effects such as T cell exhaustion and therapeutic

attempts to counter it can be studied within this context. But there
are many limitations. These models typically cannot consider
complete cancer cell extinction, requiring attention to effects
absent in the ODE treatment. Extensions of the basic model
include mixed populations of growing and non-growing cells65,
but these models neglect the possibility that dormant cells can
transition back to a proliferative state. These models also do not
consider any spatial aspects of the problem and hence are only
applicable to cases where T cell inﬁltration is not limiting66,67.
Finally, these models are also highly phenomenological and do
not attempt to connect the proposed interaction terms with
speciﬁc molecular pathways.
When one takes into account the mutual interactions of
components of the immune system (the full immune “ecology”),
it becomes clear that there can be a large-scale switch in
operating mode from “attack” to “recover”, which, in the context
of cancer, corresponds to a switch from “anti-tumor” to “pro-
tumor” mode. For example, the well-known polarization transition
of macrophages from M1 to M2 plays a key role in this
functionality switch68. Some modeling efforts have attempted to
consider this extra level of complexity56,69, but these have not
been coupled to the phenotypic degrees of freedom relevant in
the dormancy problem. Given experimental evidence regarding
the role of regulatory T cells as well as myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (MDSCs) in setting the immune balance in the metastatic
bone niche, this is an important direction for future work. These
efforts will be complicated by the inﬂuence of systemic factors on
the immune interaction with cancer cells. For example, modiﬁca-
tions to the immune cells of the bone marrow in patients with
untreated breast cancer as well as those undergoing chemother-
apy or hormone therapy have been described70,71. This suggests
that metastases may be inﬂuenced by distant primary disease.
One such mechanism is the induction of MDSCs72 by primary
breast tumors. Systemic effects associated with psychological and
physiological stress73 have also been associated with increased
risk of breast cancer relapse74. Thus, there is a clear need to extend
this modeling framework to address these important aspects.
In vivo models of breast cancer dormancy
When developing models of tumor dormancy in breast cancer, it is
important to critically evaluate their clinical relevance. Bone
marrow samples obtained from women with ER+ breast cancer
provide the most clinically relevant source of DTCs. The use of
biopsies that maintain tissue architecture rather than aspirates will
facilitate study of both DTCs and their regulatory microenviron-
ment. To maximize their clinical relevance, in vitro and mouse
models of dormancy should attempt to recapitulate the biology of
the DTC in patients. This includes utilizing ER+ models, simulation
of a bone marrow microenvironment, and incorporation of an
intact immune system. As described below, there are no current
breast cancer dormancy models that fulﬁll all of these require-
ments. Despite much interest in studying tumor dormancy, the
lack of clinically relevant models has limited progress in the ﬁeld.
To gain insight into tumor dormancy a variety of in vivo mouse
models, including genetically engineered mouse models, ortho-
topic
tumor
models,
tumor
resection
models,
as
well
as
experimental metastasis mouse models have been used75,76. For
instance, experimental metastasis mouse models have revealed
the existence of a dormant state in cancer cells delivered to a
metastatic organ site in vivo77,78. Upon transplantation into virgin
female mice, pregnancy-dependent tumors induced by insertional
mutations of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) remain
dormant for at least 300 days79. Tumor cell dormancy has also
been described in transgenic mouse models for breast cancer, in
which polyoma middle-T antigen or ERBB2 signaling was studied
in mammary gland tissue that was devoid of β1 integrin80. The
MMTV-based, doxycycline-inducible mouse model (MMTV–rTA;
TetO–NEU-NT mice) is a valuable model to study dormancy as
well. This model permits the loss of NEU (ERBB2) expression in a
pre-established
NEU-driven
mammary
tumor,
and
therefore
provides researchers with a unique tool for study of the molecular
mechanisms that control tumor dormancy and re-emergence
from the dormant state81.
ER+ models of breast cancer dormancy.
Until recently, most
studies of hormonal regulation of metastasis have utilized human
breast cancer cell lines such as MCF7 or T47D that are implanted
into immune-deﬁcient mice (Table 1). These systems have
generated important information on hormone-dependent pro-
cesses, but the necessity of utilizing immunodeﬁcient mice means
that these models cannot be used to study the immune system’s
role in dormancy. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models may
recapitulate greater intra- and inter-patient heterogeneity than
human cell lines82,83, however, these also must be studied in an
immunocompromised host34. Humanized mice are an emerging
technology that may provide a route to better study human
cancer in the context of a human immune system84, but these
have yet to be utilized to investigate metastatic dormancy. In
order to circumvent this limitation, mouse models involving
syngeneic immunocompetent mice have been developed. The
vast majority of these syngeneic mouse breast cancer cell lines
have been reported to be ER-. However, there is evidence that
some of these cell lines have a PAM50 subtype that is Luminal A/B.
This is the case for the 4T1 line, which is commonly described as a
model of triple-negative breast cancer85. It is important to
underscore that human breast cancers may be classiﬁed as ER+
when as few as 1% of cells express ER86, though most ER+ tumors
display >90% positivity87. Despite the low expression of ER in
tumors with 1% positivity, molecular proﬁling demonstrates that
some display a luminal phenotype and are sensitive to hormone
therapy86. The same criteria have not been routinely applied to
murine breast cancers. To our knowledge only one murine cell
line, E0771, has been reported in the literature to have sensitivity
to hormone therapy (fulvestrant)88. The ﬁrst ER+ mouse mammary
carcinoma models that spontaneously and consistently metasta-
size to the bone were reported using the SSM2 and SSM3 cell lines
derived from spontaneous tumors formed in STAT1-knockout
mice. These models represent a signiﬁcant advance, since there is
a latency period of up to 7 weeks before overt metastases are
detected89. Dormancy has not been explicitly studied using this
model, however. There are conﬂicting reports in the literature
regarding hormone status of murine breast cancer cell lines, which
may be due to the use of different methods (immunostaining,
PCR, or RNA-seq), lack of expected cross-reactivity between
antibodies for ER that are primarily used on human samples, or
simply the absence of a standardized cutoff for positivity. We
believe this is a crucial problem in the use of murine breast cancer
cell lines and suggest it be solved by the following methods. First,
two or more methods should be used to identify hormone status
(e.g. immunostaining and PCR for ER/PR). Second, appropriate
positive and negative controls should be used and reported in
these assays (e.g. MCF-7 and 231 cells for a human/mouse cross-
reactive antibody, or healthy murine mammary gland tissue).
Finally, any murine cell line that is found to be ER+/PR+ should be
tested for responsiveness to estrogen/progesterone in vitro and
in vivo via appropriate administration of hormones or hormone
therapy.
Sites of breast cancer dormancy.
A number of mouse models of
dormancy involve the study of DTCs in the lung. Lung metastasis
is readily studied due to the ease of delivery of tumor cells to the
lung via tail vein injection as compared to the delivery of tumor
cells to the bone marrow via intracardiac or intratibial injection.
Although the clinical relevance of the lung as a site of tumor
dormancy is unclear, dormancy models in the lung have provided
G.G. Bushnell et al.

important evidence for immune regulation of dormancy. For
example, De Lara et al. demonstrated that the CD39+PD-1+
subtype of CD8+ T cells mediated metastatic dormancy in breast
cancer using the syngeneic mouse lines 4T07 (dormant) and 4T1
(non-dormant)90.

exception of MCF7 and T47D which are shown to illustrate ER +

these murine breast cancer cell lines, 8 of 22 demonstrate
metastasis to bone while 19 of 22 demonstrate metastasis to the
lung. Of those 19 that metastasize to lung, 4 have demonstrated
dormancy in the lung. Interestingly each cell line (67NR, 4T07,
EMT6, and D2.OR) has demonstrated some degree of immune
dependence for the mechanism of lung dormancy. Speciﬁcally,

marrow in an immunocompetent host using chemotherapy
treatment of 4T07 cells and identiﬁed the role of the perivascular
niche in DTC chemotherapy resistance52. These ﬁndings highlight
the importance of the immune system and use of immunocompe-
tent models in the study of breast cancer dormancy.
Challenges for in vivo models of tumor dormancy moving
forward
Although mouse models have provided valuable information on
the regulation of tumor dormancy, all the existing models have
limitations. There are currently no in vivo models that faithfully
replicate the clinical situation of dormant breast cancer cells
residing in the bone marrow of a fully immunocompetent host.
The development of models that are ER+, immunocompetent, and
dormant in bone marrow are of the utmost importance for the
ﬁeld moving forward.
In vitro models of breast cancer dormancy
Understanding how DTCs remain dormant and how environ-
mental cues awaken them is essential for developing novel
treatment approaches. Study of DTCs has been hampered, in part,
by the lack of in vitro experimental models that recapitulate the
bidirectional interactions of DTCs and their complex, dynamic

microenvironment. Some of the in vitro experimental models
widely used to study tumor dormancy and strategies to increase
the complexities of these in vitro models to more faithfully mimic
clinical dormancy are discussed in this section (Fig. 4).
2D and 3D monoculture models.
A simple model of tumor cell
dormancy in vitro can be generated using mitogen (i.e., serum)
deprivation of 2D cultures for an extended period (up to 14 days),
which selects for a quiescent population. With this model, Barney
et al. recently demonstrated a role of TGFβ-mediated ﬁbronectin
deposition in the promotion of the FAK-ERK survival signaling axis
and maintenance of a dormant state95. In another study, Tivari et al.
developed a 2D in vitro dormancy model of ER+ MCF7 cells by
plating at clonogenic density on ﬁbronectin-coated surfaces to
select for a quiescent population in the presence of FGF-296. In
addition to ﬁbronectin and FGF-2, chronic hypoxia or cobalt
chloride treatment of metastatic breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 or
ER+ MCF7 cells has been reported to induce reversible quiescence
or dormancy97,98. Although these models are useful for investigat-
ing the molecular mechanisms that result in the establishment and
survival of dormant cells, 2D culture models often do not
recapitulate in vivo ﬁndings due to the lack of relevant cell–cell
and cell–matrix interactions that only occur in 3D. 3D Cultrex®
basement membrane extract has been employed to model in vivo
growth characteristics of cells that exhibit either dormant or
proliferative metastatic behavior in vivo in more biologically
relevant 3D culture94,99. Models using transglutaminase crosslinked
collagen gels100, ﬁbrin hydrogels101, tunable PEG hydrogels102, and
engineered poly(ε-caprolactone) scaffolds with aligned or random
ﬁbers103 have also been developed to model breast cancer
dormancy in 3D culture. The selection of speciﬁc subtypes of
tumor cells is another method for studying dormancy in vitro. For
example, M-BCSCs have been shown to represent a more quiescent
subpopulation of tumor cells than E-BCSCs or bulk tumor cells36.
Multicellular co-culture models
To model tumor dormancy in the metastatic bone niche, Marlow
and colleagues reported a multicellular co-culture model. Their
models are based on co-cultures of breast cancer cell lines in 3D
collagen biomatrix with HS-5 human bone marrow stromal cells,
which generate a supportive niche, or multicellular stromal cells
consisting of HUVEC, fetal osteoblasts, and HS-5, which generate an
inhibitory niche104. Similarly, by creating organotypic models of
lung or bone marrow microvascular niches consisting of lung
ﬁbroblasts or mesenchymal stem cells along with HUVEC, Ghajar
et al. showed that stable microvasculature constitutes a dormant
niche, whereas sprouting neovasculature sparks micro-metastatic
outgrowth of breast cancer cells51. Although these 3D co-culture
systems support quiescent breast cancer cells, the assay format
used in these models precludes large-scale screening of com-
pounds that selectively inhibit growth of dormant tumor cells. To
overcome this issue, Cavnar et al. reported the development of a
384-well 3D spheroid model in which cancer cells are reversibly
arrested in the G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle due to co-culture with
bone marrow stromal cells; this system was used to model selective
elimination of dormant tumor cells from bone marrow105.

with co-culture of multiple types of tissue stromal cells and cancer
cells have led to a better understanding of how the bone, liver,
and lung alveolar microenvironments regulate breast cancer
dormancy and reactivation. This emerging area of research is
the focus of a thorough literature review from Montagner et al.106.
For instance, using metastasis-indolent MDA-MB-231BRMS1 cells
co-cultured in osteoblast bioreactors that generate a multilayered
bone-like structure, Sosnoski et al. showed that cancer cells
attached to the bone matrix produced by MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts
are
dormant
until
addition
of
bone-remodeling
mediators
including TNFα, IL1-β, IL6, and PGE2, which stimulated cell
proliferation50. Using lung alveolar type 1 and type 2 cells and
ﬁbroblasts co-cultured with the metastatic indolent D2.OR mouse
mammary tumor cells on a gas-permeable substrate in mitogen-
low glucose-low medium, Montagner et al. demonstrated that the
indolent behavior of D2.OR cells in the lung is determined by their
interaction with alveolar epithelial cells, in particular the type
1 cells. The indolent behavior is mediated by frizzled-related
protein SFRP2, which is secreted by alveolar epithelial cells. SFRP2
promotes the formation of ﬁbronectin ﬁbrils by indolent cells to
drive integrin-dependent pro-survival signals107. Similarly, a 3D
hepatic
micro-physiological
system
that
reproduces
several
features of liver physiology results in spontaneous dormancy in
a subpopulation of breast cancer cells108,109. These ex vivo models
of breast cancer dormancy allow investigators to mimic the
pathophysiology of metastatic breast cancer cells more reliably
than standard 2D cell culture systems. Notably, due to physiolo-
gically relevant cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix interactions
that occur in the ex vivo systems, cells in these models exhibit
several different phenotypes of tumors generally not observed in
cells cultured in 2D or 3D.
Challenges for in vitro models of tumor dormancy.
Dormant breast
cancer cells usually reside in speciﬁc microenvironments such as
the bone endosteal surfaces49,50 and perivascular regions in the
bone marrow, lung, and brain that are inﬁltrated by immune
cells51,52. However, despite the progress made in the development
of complex, multicellular, or tissue-engineered systems to model
tumor dormancy, none of these models have incorporated
immune cells. Given the importance of immune surveillance in
regulating tumor behaviors, future studies will need to incorporate
immune cells into organotypic or organoid cultures110. Such co-
culture systems have been recently developed111, although not
yet utilized to study tumor dormancy. The integration of immune
cells into organoid models will be of great interest and utility for
the study of dormancy in both the primary tumor microenviron-
ment and various metastatic microenvironments that may be able
to be recapitulated with organoid systems in vitro.
Breast cancer dormancy models that bridge the gap between
in vitro and in vivo systems
Successful integration of in vitro and in vivo systems remains a
challenge for tumor dormancy research. Three models have been
described that incorporate features of both in vitro and in vivo
dormancy models. The ﬁrst was developed by the Dontu lab and
combines human osteoblasts, endothelial cells, and tumor cells in
a 3D collagen scaffold as mentioned above104,112. Crucially, the 3D
scaffold facilitates the implantation of these dormant microenvir-
onments into the subcutaneous space of mice, resulting in
development of an inhibitory (i.e., dormant) or a supportive niche
in vivo. The second of these models was developed by the Shea
lab and utilized a microporous polymer scaffold and implantation
into tumor-bearing mice to generate a niche in vivo to which
metastatic tumor cells home113–115. This approach facilitates the
development and study of the metastatic niche in vivo and can be
expanded
via
explantation
of
the
engineered
niche
and
subsequent culture in vitro116,117. The third model developed by
the Lee lab utilizes a combination of the approaches118. In this
model, pre-seeded human bone marrow stromal cells form a
vascularized niche after implantation to which both human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells and prostate cancer cells
home in vivo. These engineered niches can be explanted and
monitored for tumor cell growth or dormancy ex vivo. Taken
together, these models bridge the gap between in vivo and
in vitro microenvironments and provide unique opportunities to
study how systemic cues resulting from primary tumor develop-
ment, aging, or immune dysfunction promote or inhibit dormancy
on a whole organism scale.
Future directions
Tumor dormancy is a major clinical problem particularly relevant
to ER + breast cancer. Most current therapies do not kill non-
dividing dormant cancer cells. One therapeutic alternative is to
force dormant cancer cells to exit dormancy and then target them
as they proliferate. However, this approach depends on the ability
to kill all cells as they escape dormancy. Failure to accomplish this
may increase the likelihood of metastasis. Theoretically, treat-
ments that maintain the dormant state could be developed. This
was the rationale for extending the period of adjuvant hormonal
therapy from 5 to 10 years119. Although this extended therapy
may delay recurrence in some patients, it is often associated with
side effects. The development of effective strategies to target
dormant cancer cells raise additional issues: First, it is not clear
how to identify patients who require such treatment after
completion of adjuvant therapy as well as how to monitor
therapeutic efﬁcacy. Future studies need to evaluate the utility of
non-invasive assays such as those that detect CTCs or cell-free
DNA for identiﬁcation of women with dormant cancer cells.
Second, DTC assessment requires invasive and painful biopsies

dormancy research moving forward. The successful study of breast
cancer dormancy relies on the interplay between in vivo models of
dormancy, in vitro manipulation, and patient samples in order to
identify mechanisms of dormancy, generate new hypotheses, and
develop therapies with the ultimate goal of new clinical trials to
study breast cancer dormancy and to assess treatments.

but may provide sufﬁciently worthwhile information to justify use.
It remains to be determined whether women with pure ductal
carcinoma in situ are more likely to harbor dormant cells than
women without cancer cells in the ducts. Finally, methods to
assess elimination of DTCs must be developed. The complexity of
tumor dormancy and the difﬁculty of conducting clinical trials
over two or more decades highlights the need for continued pre-
clinical model development (Fig. 5). As highlighted in this review,
current models, although valuable, all have limitations. Future
development of more clinically relevant models will help elucidate
the biology underlying breast cancer dormancy and develop
strategies to overcome the clinical challenge of breast cancer
relapse.
