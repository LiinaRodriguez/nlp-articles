Abstract
Cancer-intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms and pleiotropy are a barrier to cancer immunotherapy. This is apparent in 
certain highly fatal cancers, including high-grade gliomas and glioblastomas (GBM). In this study, we evaluated two murine 
syngeneic glioma models (GL261 and CT2A) as preclinical models for human GBM using functional genetic screens, 
single-cell transcriptomics and machine learning approaches. Through CRISPR genome-wide co-culture killing screens with 
various immune cells (cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages), we identified three key cancer-intrinsic eva-
sion mechanisms: NFκB signaling, autophagy/endosome machinery, and chromatin remodeling. Additional fitness screens 
identified dependencies in murine gliomas that partially recapitulated those seen in human GBM (e.g., UFMylation). Our 
single-cell analyses showed that different glioma models exhibited distinct immune infiltration patterns and recapitulated 
key immune gene programs observed in human GBM, including hypoxia, interferon, and TNF signaling. Moreover, in vivo 
orthotopic tumor engraftment was associated with phenotypic shifts and changes in proliferative capacity, with murine 
tumors recapitulating the intratumoral heterogeneity observed in human GBM, exhibiting propensities for developmental- 
and mesenchymal-like phenotypes. Notably, we observed common transcription factors and cofactors shared with human 
GBM, including developmental (Nfia and Tcf4), mesenchymal (Prrx1 and Wwtr1), as well as cycling-associated genes 
(Bub3, Cenpa, Bard1, Brca1, and Mis18bp1). Perturbation of these genes led to reciprocal phenotypic shifts suggesting 
intrinsic feedback mechanisms that balance in vivo cellular states. Finally, we used a machine-learning approach to iden-
tify two distinct immune evasion gene programs, one of which represents a clinically-relevant phenotype and delineates 
a subpopulation of stem-like glioma cells that predict response to immune checkpoint inhibition in human patients. This 
comprehensive characterization helps bridge the gap between murine glioma models and human GBM, providing valuable 
insights for future therapeutic development.

Introduction
Pre-clinical models of cancer that recapitulate the com-
plexity of cancer cells and their interactions with the tumor 
microenvironment are essential for developing therapeutic 
strategies. Current in vitro approaches, including 2D cell 
culture and 3D organoids, fail to adequately model the 
intricate tumor microenvironment, particularly in complex 
organs like the brain [42]. Gliomas are the most common 
primary brain tumor in adults and vary in severity and 
aggressiveness with subtypes that include astrocytomas, 
oligodendrogliomas and glioblastomas (GBMs) [33, 59]. 
GBMs are malignant grade 4 gliomas that arise without 
evidence of lower-grade precursors and are predomi-
nantly made up of abnormal, highly infiltrative astrocytic 
cells [33, 58, 59]. Drug development efforts for GBM are 
largely impeded by substantial financial risks associated 
with historical translational failures [101], and the lack 
of preclinical models that recapitulate the complexity 
and heterogeneity of the disease in patients [102]. Inten-
tional functional discovery and drug development efforts 
are vital for GBM given its unique therapy challenges 
including heterogeneity, an immunosuppressive tumor 
micro-environment, and the presence of the blood–brain 
or blood-tumor barrier [102].
Murine syngeneic GL261 and CT2A glioma models 
are commonly used to study glioma biology in immuno-
competent C57BL/6 mice [91]. Both models recapitulate 
various hallmarks of GBMs, and their unique mutational 
[37, 40, 45, 66, 68, 89, 107] and transcriptomic [37] pro-
files result in distinct responses to immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICI) [37, 57, 107, 112], radiation [71, 73], 
and chemotherapy [71, 73, 116] (Table 1). Histologically, 
both tumors have characteristic pseudopalisading necrotic 
cores, along with extensive angiogenesis. Unlike GL261 
tumors, CT2A tumors are known to resemble a mesenchy-
mal phenotype that correlates with its immune-suppressive 
tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME) and resistance 
to immunotherapies. Given that preclinical findings in 
GL261 and CT2A models often fail to correlate with clini-
cal findings, it behoves us to better understand how these 
syngeneic glioma cell lines deviate from each other and 
from human GBM.
In the current study, we used experimental and computa-
tional approaches and evaluated murine glioma models using 
genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens to identify cancer-
intrinsic immune evasion genes to cytotoxic T cells, natural 
killer cells and macrophages, cancer gene dependencies, and 
single-cell transcriptomics to evaluate the TIME. We also 
compared murine glioma models using public single-cell 
RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and CRISPR data to deter-
mine how these models recapitulate what is known about

Animal studies
Animal studies
Animal use and studies were performed in accordance 
with guidelines outlined by Animal Use Protocols within 
the Division of Comparative Medicine at the University 
of Toronto and the McMaster University Central Animal 
Facility. Intracranial injections were conducted in 6–8-week-
old male C57BL/6 mice as previously described using ­106 
cells per mouse [13]. Briefly, a small burr hole was drilled 
2 mm behind the coronal suture and 3 mm to the right of 
the sagittal suture. Cells suspended in 10 µL PBS were 
injected intracranially using a Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, 
#7635-01) into the right frontal lobes. Animals were sacri-
ficed at humane endpoint, defined loss of 15-20% of body-
weight from date of tumor engraftment, and a combination 
of hunched posture, decreased response when picked up, 
lack of grooming and loss of skin elasticity. Brains were 
removed, and right frontal pieces were snap frozen for sci-
RNA-seq3 processing.
Cell lines
CT2A and GL261 glioma cells
CT2A cells were purchased from Millipore/Sigma-Aldrich 
(#SCC194) and GL261 cells were purchased from DSMZ 
(#ACC802). These lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s 
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Wisent, #319-005-en) 
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, 
#12483020) and 0.1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco, 
#15140122). Cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% ­CO2. Myco-
plasma testing was routinely performed. To generate Cas9 
knock-in CT2A and GL261 cell lines, cells were transduced 
with Lenti-Cas9-2A-Blast (Addgene, #73310) and selected 
with Blasticidin S HCl (Gibco, #A1113903) as previously 
described [52]. CT2A-Ova cell lines were generated via 
transduction with lenti-Ova, and sorted for high expression.
NK and CTL primary cells
Primary NK and CTL cells were isolated from OT-1 
(C57BL/6-Tg(TcraTcrb)1100Mjb/J mice (Jackson Labora-
tory). Spleens were harvested, minced, and strained to obtain 
splenocytes. NK cells were then isolated through negative 
selection using the NK Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, 
#130–115-818). NK cells were cultured in 10% RPMI with 
1% penicillin–streptomycin, 100 ng/mL IL-2 and 55 µM 
2-mercaptoethanol. Primary CTL cells were isolated, cul-
tured, and activated as described previously [52]. In short, 
OT-1 CD8 + T cells were isolated using an antibody-based 
magnetic separation kit (Miltenyi, #130-096-543) and 
activated and expanded with CD3/CD28 beads (Miltenyi, 
#130-093-627).
Myeloid cell lines
RAW264.7 cells were purchased from MilliporeSigma, 
BV-2 cells from AcceGen Biotech, and J774A.1 cells from 
ATCC. RAW264.1 and J774A.1 were cultured in DMEM

(Wisent, #319-005-CL) supplemented with 10% FBS 
(Gibco, #12483020). BV-2 cells were cultured in RPMI-
1640 (Wisent, #350-000-CL) supplemented with 10% FBS. 
Cell lines were maintained in humidified incubators at 37 °C 
and 5% ­CO2 and were routinely tested for mycoplasma 
contamination.
CRISPR‑Cas9‑edited cell lines
CRISPR-mediated gene knockouts in CT2A cell lines were 
generated by electroporation using the Neon Transfection 
System (Invitrogen, MPK10096) following the manu-
facturer’s instructions. In brief, Cas9 ribonucleoproteins 
(RNP) were prepared by combining 20 pmol single-guide 
(sg) RNA (Synthego) consisting of 3 sgRNAs targeting the 
same gene with 20 pmol spCas9 nuclease (IDT #1081059) 
in 5 μL buffer R (Invitrogen) for 15 min at room tempera-
ture. sgRNA sequences are listed in Table S2. CT2A cells 
were lifted with trypsin (Gibco) and washed twice with 
Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS, Wisent) and 
resuspended with buffer R. 200,000 cells were combined 
with 20 pmol Cas9 RNP in 12 μL buffer R and electropo-
rated at 1200 V, for 2 pulses of 30 ms with 10 μL tips. 72 h 
after electroporation, cells were subjected to limiting dilu-
tion and single-cell clonal expansion. Genomic DNA from 
selected clones was extracted using the DNA Fast Extract 
kit (Wisent, #801-200-DR) and sgRNA target regions were 
PCR amplified with DNA 2X HS-Red Taq PCR mastermix 
(Wisent, #801-200-DM). Primer sequences are provided 
in Table S3. The PCR product was sequenced by Sanger 
sequencing. Confirmation of gene knockout was performed 
using ICE (https://​ice.​synth​ego.​com/) to identify out-of-
frame insertion and deletion mutations. CRISPR-mediated 
gene knockouts were also verified by western blot. Antibod-
ies used are listed in Table S4.
Immunoblot analysis
To confirm gene knockouts in CT2A cells, cells were cul-
tured to 90% confluency in 10-cm dishes. The cells were 
washed with DPBS and lysed with RIPA buffer (Thermo 
Scientific, #89901) supplemented with 1X protease inhibi-
tor (Thermo Scientific, #78420) at 4 °C. Protein quantifica-
tion was done by Pierce BCA Assay (Life Technologies, 
#23225). Lysates were loaded on precast SDS-PAGE gels 
(Invitrogen, NP0321PK2) and subsequently transferred onto 
nitrocellulose membrane for detection. All primary antibod-
ies were probed overnight at 4 °C, and membranes were 
washed with Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 (TBST; 
Cell Signaling Technology, #9997) and incubated with 
appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. 
Subsequently membranes were washed with TBS-T and 
the signal was detected with chemiluminescent substrate 
(Thermo Scientific, #34579) on an iBright Imaging system 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Cell proliferation assay
Single cells were plated in a 96-well plate at a density of 
1000 or 200 cells/200 μL per well and incubated at 37 °C 
and 5% CO2 for 5 days. 20 μL of Presto Blue (ThermoFisher, 
Cat.A13262), a fluorescent cell metabolism indicator, was 
added to each well four hours prior to reading out the assy. 
Fluorescence was measured using a FLUOstar Omega 
Fluorescence 556 Microplate reader (BMG LABTECH) 
with excitation and emission wavelengths of 544 nm and 
590 nm, respectively. Readings were then analyzed using 
Omega analysis software. Proliferation was calculated for 
each well by subtracting the average RFI of blank wells from 
the RFI of individual wells. Normalized RFI was plotted 
for each well being tested as a side-by-side comparison of 
proliferation.
Immune‑cell killing assays
The killing efficiency of immune cells co-cultured with 
CT2A cells was assessed across a range of effector-to-tumor 
ratios (E:T) and quantified as percentage killing relative to 
untreated conditions. Twenty-four h prior to killing assay, 
CT2A cells were incubated in 1 µM carboxyfluorescein suc-
cinimidyl ester (CFSE) dye (37 °C × 10–20 min) and then 
cultured in complete medium overnight. On day of killing 
assay, CT2A cells were re-plated with immune cells at vari-
ous E:T ratios. At 24 h endpoint, immune cells and dead 
CT2A cells were removed by gentle PBS wash. The remain-
ing viable and adherent CT2A cells were assessed visually 
and by counting using a Coulter counter. For ADCP-medi-
ated killing assays, killing efficiency was assessed by flow 
cytometry as before [52]. CFSE and anti-CD11a were used 
as CT2A and J774.1 cell markers, and double-positive cells 
were interpreted as phagocytosed CT2A cells. E:T ratios that 
achieved between 20–50% killing efficiency were selected 
for screening conditions.
Single‑cell transcriptomic analysis using 
sci‑RNA‑seq3
Sample processing, sci‑RNA‑seq3 library generation, 
and sequencing
Cells were harvested with 0.25% typsin-EDTA [9]. Cell pel-
lets were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and 
then stored at -80 °C for sci-RNA-seq3 based single-nucleus 
RNA-Seq processing. Samples from all genotypes were pro-
cessed together to minimize batch effects. Nuclei extraction 
and fixation were performed as previously described [9],

except for the use of a modified CST lysis buffer [103] plus 
1% of SUPERase-In RNase Inhibitor (AM2696). Nuclei 
quality was checked with DAPI and Wheat Germ Aggluti-
nin staining. Sci-RNA-seq3 libraries were generated as pre-
viously described using three-level combinatorial indexing 
[9]. The final libraries were sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 
as follows: read 1: 34bp, read 2: 69bp, index 1: 10bp, index 
2: 10bp.
Demultiplexing and read alignments
Raw sequencing reads were first demultiplexed based on i5/
i7 PCR barcodes. FASTQ files were then processed using 
the sci-RNA-Seq3 pipeline [9]. After barcodes and unique 
molecular identifiers (UMIs) were extracted from the read1 
of FASTQ files, read alignment was performed using STAR 
short-read aligner (v2.5.2b) with the mouse genome (mm10) 
and Gencode vM12 gene annotations. After removing dupli-
cate reads based on UMI, barcode, chromosome and align-
ment position, reads were summarized into a count matrix 
of M genes × N nuclei.
Filtering
Raw count matrices were loaded into a Seurat object (ver-
sion 4.0.1) and filtered to retain cells with (i) 200–9000 
recovered genes per cell, (ii) less than 60% mitochondrial 
content, and (iii) unmatched rate between 0.11 and 0.27 
(median ± 3 median absolute deviations).
Normalization
To normalize expression values, we adopted the mode-
ling framework previously described and implemented in 
sctransform (R Package, version 0.3.2) [29]. In brief, count 
data were modeled by regularized negative binomial regres-
sion, using sequencing depth as a model covariate to regress 
out the influence of technical effects, and Pearson residuals 
were used as the normalized and variance stabilized biologi-
cal signal for downstream analysis.
Integration
Data from each timepoint and replicate were integrated with 
the reciprocal PCA method (Seurat) using the top 2000 vari-
able features.
Dimensional reduction
PCA was performed on the integrated dataset, and 
the top N components that accounted for 90% of the 
observed variance were used for UMAP embedding, 
RunUMAP(max_components = 2, n_neighbours = 50, min_
dist = 01, metric = cosine).
Clustering and annotation
To identify cellular sub-populations, we performed clus-
tering using the Louvain algorithm implemented in Seurat 
(resolution = 1.5). Clusters were assigned numerical iden-
tifiers that were ranked in descending order according to 
cluster size, such that the smallest identifier (i.e., 0) cor-
responded to the largest cluster size, and vice versa. Clus-
tered populations were then annotated using spatial and 
scRNA-seq reference atlases. Using Seurat’s label transfer 
pipeline, we identified transfer anchors for each query-refer-
ence pair using FindTransferAnchors(normalization.
method = ‘‘SCT’’, reference.reudction = ‘‘pca’’, dims = 1:50) 
and then mapped the query samples onto the reference atlas 
using MapQuery(reference.reduction = ‘‘pca’’, reduction.
model = ‘‘umap’’). The resulting prediction scores were 
cross-validated with cluster-specific markers obtained from 
differential-expression analyses to inform cluster annotation.
Differential expression analysis
Differential expression analyses were performed using the 
Wilcoxon [wilcoxauc(…) function, (presto R package, 
v 1.0.0)] and co-dependency index (CDI) methods [Find-
CDIMarkers(…) function, (scMiko R package, v. 1.0.0)] 
[78]. Differentially expressed genes (thresholded at 5% 
FDR) were ranked by area under receiver operating charac-
teristic curve (AUROC) or normalized CDI (nCDI) scores 
and the top 2–4 markers for each cell type cluster were used 
for visualization.
NMF gene program discovery
For each sample, NMF was performed across multiple 
rank parameters and gene programs that were consistently 
resolved within and between tumors across multiple ranks 
were retained as robust NMF programs. NMF workflow 
parameters are summarized in Table S5. The workflow 
described here was modified from work by Gavish and col-
leagues [26]:
1.	 Expression matrix preparation: For each sample, genes 
expressed in 0.5–5% of cells were used for NMF analy-
sis. Expression matrices were normalized and scaled 
using the sctransform workflow (see above), and nega-
tive values were truncated at zero to obtain a non-nega-
tive scaled expression matrix (NSM).
2.	 Run NMF analysis: NMF analysis was performed for 
each NSM using nnmf(…, k = c(2,…,15), loss = “mse”, 
rel.tol = 1e-4, max.iter = 50) (NNLM R package, v 0.4.4). 
	
Acta Neuropathologica          (2024) 148:74 
   74  
Page 6 of 27
NMF was performed for rank parameters between 
k = 2–15 (Table S5). For each NMF run, we defined 
the resulting gene programs as the top 70–150 genes, 
ordered by factor loading.
3.	 Identify component programs: We reasoned that certain 
NMF runs will yield non-informative decompositions, 
and that only a subset of NMF programs will be repro-
ducible within and between samples. To ensure within-
sample robustness, the Jaccard similarity between 
NMF programs was computed across all intra-sample 
ranks, and programs with similarities exceeding 0.2–
0.7 across more than 2 ranks were retained. Next, to 
ensure between-sample robustness, the Jaccard similari-
ties between the remaining NMF programs were com-
puted between samples, and programs with similarities 
exceeding 0.15–0.5 in at least 2 samples were retained. 
The resulting NMF programs that passed the intra- and 
inter-sample filtering steps were termed component pro-
grams.
4.	 Identify consensus programs: To obtain a non-redundant 
set of gene programs from the component programs, a 
Jaccard similarity matrix was computed for the remain-
ing component programs, and hierarchically clustered 
using Pearson correlation as the distance metric. Clus-
tering parameters that separated the component pro-
grams were determined by visual inspection of the 
hierarchically clustered Jaccard similarity heatmap. For 
each cluster, the consensus program was defined as the 
set of genes that were represented in at least 25–50% of 
component programs (Table S5).
Gene set enrichment analysis
To functionally-annotated gene sets, we performed hyper-
geometric overrepresentation analysis using the fora(…) 
(fgsea R package, v 1.14.0). Annotated gene sets used for 
enrichment analyses included GO ontology (biological pro-
cesses, cellular components, molecular function) and those 
curated by the Bader Lab (http://​bader​lab.​org/​GeneS​ets).
Enrichment network
Jaccard similarity between enriched pathways was used to 
account for gene set redundancies. Functional enrichment 
co-similarities were visualized using emapplot(…, edge.
params = list(min = 0.2)) (enrichplot R package, v1.18.1).
Gene program activity
For each gene set, cell-level gene program activities were 
calculated using AddModuleScore(…) in Seurat. 
Where indicated, the programs were classified as “on” 
or “off” states by performing gaussian decomposition of 
gene program activity values. This was implemented using 
MClust(…, G = 1:5) (mclust R package, v 6.0.0) where 
parameterised finite gaussian mixture models were fit to 
a numeric vector of activity values and models were esti-
mated by expectation–maximization algorithm initialized 
by hierarchical model-based agglomerative clustering. For 
each program, the optimal model was selected according to 
Bayesian information criterion (BIC).
Glioma‑associated transcriptomic regulators
For each GBM scRNAseq dataset (overview of datasets in 
Table S1), cell-level gene program activities were calcu-
lated using (i) a curated list of GBM- and tumor-associated 
gene panels and (ii) TF-specific target gene sets consoli-
dated from TRRUST v2 [30] and AnimalTFDB 3.0 [34]. 
Machine-learning-based random forest regression models 
were then trained to identify which transcription regulators 
were associated with each GBM subtype. This was repeated 
across each GBM dataset, and the top transcription factors 
that were consistently associated with a GBM subtype were 
nominated as GBM glioma-associated transcription regula-
tors (GTRs, 5% FDR). For each GBM transcriptomic pheno-
type, the top regulatory transcription factors were visualized 
in a bipartite network, where one layer of nodes represented 
GBM-specific gene programs and the other layer of nodes 
represented associated GTRs.
Relative abundance analysis
To compare the relative abundance of each cell type across 
conditions, counts for each cell type were tallied within each 
condition, and divided by the total number of cells profiled.
Differential abundance analysis
To evaluate regional differential abundances of cells in 
UMAP space across genotypes, we adopted the Milo 
method [16]. In brief, for each comparison between 
the CT2A and GL261-engrafted mouse samples, cells 
were first resampled to normalize cell counts, and then 
a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph representing higher-
dimensional relationships between single cells was con-
structed. The KNN graph was then used to define neigh-
borhoods of cells using the refined sampling scheme [16]. 
Finally, the number of cells belonging to each condition 
within each neighborhood was counted and the differential 
abundance was computed using a negative binomial gener-
alized linear model. The differential abundance estimates 
for each neighborhood were visualized in UMAP space, 
with each node representing a given neighborhood (com-
prised of 20–80 cells each), and the color representing

the differential abundance expressed as log fold-change 
between GL261 and CT2A samples. Non-significant dif-
ferentials (FDR > 0.1) were truncated at zero.
Transcriptomic similarity
To evaluate the relative transcriptomic similarity of various 
human gliomas to murine gliomas, we adopted the transfer 
learning approach implemented in Seurat [106]. Specifically, 
murine glioma cells were mapped onto human GBM tran-
scriptomic space by projecting the query (murine glioma 
cells) PCA structure onto the reference (human GBM) PCA 
structure. This enabled identification of corresponding cells 
(i.e., anchors), thereby allowing the mapping of murine gli-
omas cells onto the human GBM space and inference of 
the corresponding human glioma label in murine cells. The 
transfer scores computed using the FindTransferAn-
chor(…, normalization.method = “SCT”, k.anchor = 5, n.
trees = 100, npcs = 40) and TransferData(…) functions 
in Seurat were used as surrogate measures of transcriptomic 
similarity.
Survival analyses
Murine glioma programs survival associations
The prognostic value of NMF gene programs identified in 
murine glioma cells was assessed by performing survival 
analyses using TCGA RNA-seq profiles of GBM patient 
samples (N = 162). For each sample, NMF program activity 
was calculated by ssGSEA, and survival associations were 
assessed constructing Kaplan–Meier curves (survminer R 
package, v 0.4.9) in which samples were stratified into 
Low (score < 0) and High (score ≥ 0) groups, split based 
on median score. Corresponding hazard ratios (HRs) were 
estimated by fitting proportional hazards regression mod-
els using the coxph(…) function (survival R package, v 
3.4–0).
Meta‑analysis of E1 and E2 survival associations
Using RNA-seq data from each GBM cohort, E1 and E2 
program activities were scored using ssGSEA. Then, E1 and 
E2 HR were calculated using proportional hazards regres-
sion. Meta-analytic HR estimates were estimated by fitting a 
random effects model using the rma(…, method = “REML”) 
function (metafor R package, v 4.0) and forest plots were 
generated using forest.rma(…). I2, a measure of het-
erogeneity, was quantified to estimate the percentage of total 
variance that is attributed to interstudy variance.
Genome‑wide CRISPR screens
Pooled genome‑wide CRISPR screens in CT2A and GL261 
cells
CRISPR screens in CT2A-Cas9 and GL261-Cas9 cells were 
performed as previously described. In brief, 1.5 × ­108 cells 
were infected with the mTKO lentiviral library (Addgene 
#159393) at an MOI of around 0.3. 24 h after infection, 
culture medium was changed to puromycin-supplemented 
medium (5 µg/mL). 72 h after infection, 1 × ­108 cells were 
cryo-banked whereas 9 × ­107 cells were split into three repli-
cates of 3 × ­107 cells and further passaged every 3–4 d while 
maintaining 200-fold library representation. 3 × ­107 cells 
were collected for genomic DNA extraction at day 0 ­(T0) 
post-selection and at every subsequent passage until days 
19 (T19, CT2A) or 15 (T15, GL261) post-selection. Genomic 
DNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing were 
performed as described below.
CD29‑sort screen in CT2A cells
Infection, selection and passaging of CT2A-Cas9 cells for 
the CD29 sort screen was performed as described above. 
At T19, cells were stained with anti-CD29-FITC antibody 
(20 µg/1000 µL) and FACS sorting was performed as before 
[64]. The unsorted T19 sample was used as a reference. 
Genomic DNA extraction, library preparation, sequencing, 
and data processing were performed as described below.
Genome‑wide CRISPR loss‑of‑function immune killing 
screens
Cas9-expressing CT2A-Ova cells were infected with the 
mTKO lentiviral library at a multiplicity of infection of 0.3 
and maintained at 200-fold representation for each gRNA 
in the library. Infected cells were selected with 5 µg/mL 
of puromycin for 48 h. After selection cells were split in 
technical triplicates and maintained in culture for 72 h. For 
myeloid killing screens, CT2A cells (3 × ­106) were harvested 
and co-cultured with LPS-polarized (100 ng/mL LPS × 24 h) 
RAW264.7 (1.5 × ­105; 0.05 E:T), J774A.1 (3 × ­105; 0.1 
E:T), and BV-2 (6 × ­105; 0.2 E:T) myeloid cell lines for 
24 h to achieve killing efficiencies ranging between 22.9% 
to 44.1% (Fig. S1a). For the J774A.1 co-culture screen, an 
additional treatment arm was included in which CT2A cells 
were opsonized with anti-CD29 antibody (37ºC × 20 min) 
followed by anti-Armenian Hamster IgG2b antibody 
(37ºC × 20 min, then room temperature × 40 min) prior to 
co-culturing with J774A.1 cells to facilitate ADCP. Anti-
CD29 antibody was confirmed to not affect CT2A viability 
(Fig. S1b). ADCP-dependent killing efficiency was 33.7% 
across replicates (Fig. S1c). After 24 h of selective pressure,

myeloid cells were eliminated using puromycin (8 µg/
mL × 48 h) and confirmed by CD11b staining. For CTL kill-
ing screens, CT2A cells were co-cultured with preactivated 
CD8 + T cells at a 0.2 E:T ratio to achieve 46.2% killing 
efficiency (Fig. S1d, see Lawson et al. for further details 
[52]). For NK killing screens, a 0.5 E:T ratio was used to 
achieve 43.8% killing efficiency (Fig. S1e). Untreated CT2A 
cells were kept in parallel as a control. Across all conditions, 
killing efficiencies were calculated as the number of CT2A 
cells in co-culture relative to the number of unchallenged 
cells. Cell pellets at 200-fold library coverage were collected 
for genomic DNA extraction at the end of screen. Genomic 
DNA extraction, library preparation, sequencing, and data 
processing were performed as described below.
Genomic DNA extraction, library preparation, sequencing, 
and data processing
For all screens, genomic DNA was extracted using the Wiz-
ard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, #A1120) [83]. 
Sequencing libraries were prepared, sequenced using Illu-
mina HiSeq2500, and processed as before [11, 52]. Bayes 
factor (BF) scores were calculated using BAGEL for CT2A 
and GL261 dropout screens, such that genes with a BF > 5 
were classified as essential genes [32]. Scaled BF was calcu-
lated as scaled BF = BF—5. For immune co-culture screens, 
fold-changes between immune-cell-treated and untreated 
CT2A cells were calculated using limma [94].
Human fitness scores
Processed CRIPSR-Cas9 genome screen data was retrieved 
from Project Score database for 41 human GBM cell-lines 
and 1031 human non-CNS cell lines [21, 87]. For each cell-
line, gene-level fitness was represented as a scaled BF, which 
corresponded to BAGEL2-derived BF subtracted by the BF 
at the 5% FDR threshold [51]. Scaled BFs were then pooled 
as averages for GBM and non-CNS cell lines and genes with 
BF > 0 were classified as essential within each respective 
group. If genes were essential in both groups, they were 
in addition termed common essentials, and if genes were 
essential in one group but not the other, they were termed 
either GBM-specific or non-CNS-specific. All other genes 
were non-essentials.
Data visualization and statistics
Data visualization
Unless otherwise specified, the ggplot2 R package (v 3.3.5) 
was used for data visualization. scRNA-seq gene expression 
was visualized using FeaturePlot function (Seurat) or 
DotPlot function (Seurat). Venn diagrams were generated 
using either ssvFeatureEuler (seqsetvis R package, v 
1.8.0) or ggVennDiagram (ggVennDiagram R package, 
v 1.1.4).
Statistics and reproducibility
All pairwise comparisons were performed using the signed 
Wilcoxon rank sum test, and p values were adjusted for 
multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg pro-
cedure, as indicated. In cases where methods were compared 
across a common set of data, paired Wilcoxon tests were 
performed.

Results
Autophagy mediates cancer intrinsic pan‑immune 
evasion
To identify the underlying genes regulating glioma-intrinsic 
immune evasion across a spectrum of immune cell pres-
sures, we performed genome-scale pooled CRISPR loss-
of-function screens in a murine glioma model using the 
mTKO library [52]. CRISPR-mutagenized CT2A cells 
were propagated in the presence or absence of various 
immune cell lines [microglia; BV-2, non-phagocytic mac-
rophages; Raw 264.7 and J774.1, phagocytic macrophages; 
J774.1 with anti-CD29-opsonized CT2A cells, cytotoxic 
T-lymphocytes (CTLs), or natural killer (NK) cells] (see 
Methods for details). Following a period of co-culture (i.e., 
selective pressure; Fig. S1), CT2A cells were subjected to 
deep sequencing of gRNA barcodes to identify genes that 
were enriched or depleted, i.e., genetic perturbations that 
conferred resistance or sensitivity to immune cell killing, 
respectively (Fig. 1a, b; Table S6).
CT2A-intrinsic non-phagocytic myeloid-evasion genes 
were defined as sensitizer or resister genes significant (5% 
FDR) across at least two myeloid cell lines (BV-2, Raw 
264.7, or J774.1). This yielded 54 sensitizer and 8 resister 
hits (Fig. 1c, Table S6). In addition, we identified 69 sen-
sitizers and 13 resisters involved in antibody-dependent 
cellular phagocytosis (ADCP; J774.1 + CT2A opsonized 
with anti-CD29). NFκB signaling (e.g., Traf2/3/6, 
Tnfaip3, Bcl2l1, Ikbkg and Ikbkb) and autophagy (e.g., 
Wipi2, Atg12) were shared sensitizing hits in phagocytic

and non-phagocytic myeloid cells (Fig. 1c), likely due to 
residual non-phagocytic effects in the ADCP conditions 
(Fig. S1c). To clarify which genes were directly involved 
in ADCP evasion, we performed a CD29 sort screen in 
CT2A cells to identify regulators of the antibody target 
CD29 (encoded by Itgb1, Fig. S2a-b). Among the ADCP 
evasion genes not involved in regulating CD29 expression 
were Apmap and Cd47, both known inhibitors of phagocy-
tosis (Fig. S2c), and several cytoskeletal (Mbtd1, Rab11a 
and Itgb5) and mediator complex (Cdk8) genes (Fig. S2d). 
Gene perturbations conferring resistance to myeloid-medi-
ated killing were sparse, but included Tnfrsf1a, indicat-
ing the role of TNF in non-phagocytic myeloid-mediated 
cytotoxicity (Fig. 2e).

Like the myeloid screens, lymphoid screens revealed 
that perturbation of NFκB signaling and autophagy sensi-
tized CT2A cells to CTL and NK killing (Fig. 1d, Fig. S3, 
Table S6). Furthermore, components of the chromatin 
remodeling pathway, including those seen in non-phago-
cytic myeloid evasion (i.e., Hdac2, Eed, and Dot1l) sensi-
tized against CTL but not NK cells. CTL and NK cells had 
distinct resisters which reflected the unique mechanisms of 
anti-tumor immunity by each effector cell. Perturbation of 
GPI-anchor components (e.g., Pigu, Pigk, Dpm1, Dpm3, 
etc.) and Raet1e, which encodes the UL16-binding protein 
that serves as a NKG2D ligand [10], conferred resistance 
to NK-mediated cytotoxicity. Conversely, interferon (Ifngr1 
and Ifngr2) and TNF (Tnfrsf1a and Tnfrsf1b) were required 
for CTL-mediated cytotoxicity (Fig. 1e).
We previously performed CTL coculture screens across 
six diverse syngeneic murine cancer cell models [colon; 
CT26 and MC38, kidney; Renca, breast; 4T1 and EMT6, 
melanoma; B16] to identify 182 core CTL evasion genes 
[52]. In CT2A cells, we found that these core CTL sen-
sitizers, including genes involved in NFκB signaling and 
autophagy, were recovered with an AUROC of 0.81 and 
AUPRC of 0.30 (Fig. 1f). In contrast to other cancer cell 
lines, UFMylation, gene silencing, and GPI-anchored path-
ways were not involved in CT2A CTL evasion (Fig. 1g). 
Next, we found that core CTL resister genes were recov-
ered in CT2A cells with an AUROC of 0.70 and AUPRC 
of 0.13, suggesting some contextual divergence in CT2A 
cells (Fig. 1f).
Given that autophagy was involved in pan-immune eva-
sion including in CT2A cells, we sought to characterize 
the survival effect on mice engrafted intracranially with 
CT2A cells that have been genetically engineering with 
the autophagy pathway perturbed. Thus, clonal ΔAtg12 
CT2A cell lines were engineered and engrafted orthotopi-
cally (Fig. S4). Single-cell transcriptome profiling of the 
engrafted ΔAtg12 CT2A tumors revealed significant down-
regulation of the autophagy pathway compared to parental 
controls (Fig. 1h). Decreased autophagy was associated with 
significant increases in apoptotic and TNFα/NFκB signal-
ing, but not IFNγ signaling (Fig. 1h). Indeed, this also cor-
responded with a significant survival advantage (p < 0.01, 
Fig. 1i). Given that Atg12 was not an essential gene, we 
attributed this survival benefit to immune sensitization, 
rather than intrinsic impairment of tumor growth.
Taken together, the immune-glioma co-culture screens 
establish NFκB signaling, autophagy/endosome machinery, 
and chromatin remodeling as the predominant mechanisms 
of CT2A-intrinsic immune evasion.
Murine glioma cells partially recapitulate human 
genetic dependencies
In addition to identifying intrinsic immune evasion genes, we 
also defined fitness genes in CT2A cells and another murine 
glioma model GL261, then compared the results to similar 
screens performed in human GBM models. Pooled loss-
of-function genetic screens were performed in CT2A and 
GL261 cells and essential fitness genes were identified using 
BAGEL (Fig. 2a, b, Table S7; BF > 5 threshold) and 1392 
genes were deemed essential by this criterion (i.e., BF > 5) in 
both murine models, while 408 genes were GL261-specific 
and 250 were CT2A-specific (Fig. 2c). Notably, among the 
GL261-specific hits, Kras and Sox6 were top differential 
fitness genes, consistent with Kras being a known GL261 
oncogene and Sox6 being a transcriptional regulator of the 
OPC-like GBM phenotype (Fig. 2d). Functional annotation 
of CT2A- and GL261-specific fitness genes further revealed 
that CT2A-specific fitness genes were enriched for processes 
involved in cell division and epigenetic and post-transla-
tional regulation of gene expression (e.g., RNA processing, 
spliceosome, cell division, histone modification) whereas 
GL261-specific genes were associated with metabolic pro-
cesses (e.g., TCA cycle/ETC, nucleotide/flavin/cholesterol 
biosynthesis) (Fig. 2e).
We next evaluated the fitness landscape in human GBM 
cells. Comparison of gene essentiality profiles from 41 
human GBM cell lines and 1031 human non-central nerv-
ous system (CNS) cell lines (Project Score database) identi-
fied 1625 common essential genes and 124 GBM-specific 
genes; notable GBM-specific human fitness genes included 
JUN, FERTM2, FGFR1, WWTR1 and ADAR (Fig. 2f, g). 
Of the 124 GBM-specific fitness genes identified in human 
cell lines, 44 (35%) and 54 (44%) genes were essential in 
CT2A and GL261 cells, respectively (Fig. 2h). However,

by comparison, 51/123 (41%) and 68/123 (55%) of non-
CNS-specific fitness genes were also essential in CT2A 
and GL261 cells. This suggests that CT2A and GL261 have 
unique genetic dependency profiles that resemble GBM in 
some ways, but not others. These findings were consistent 
across different essentiality thresholds and supported by pre-
cision-recall analysis (Fig. 2i, Fig. S5a). Among the human 
GBM-specific fitness genes that were recovered by GL261 
were UFMylation-related genes, including Ufc1, Ube2g2 
and Ufl1; these are known essential regulators of cell stress 
in human glioma stem cells [63]. Conversely, CT2A shared 
dependencies with human GBM cells related to epige-
netic regulation (Dnmt1, Ttf1) and DNA damage response 
(Brat1, Rnf8) (Fig. 2j, Fig. S5b). Together our analyses pro-
vide insight into the genetic fitness landscape in CT2A and 
GL261 glioma models and highlight dependencies that are 
uniquely shared with human GBM.
Unbiased transcriptomic profiling of murine brain 
tumors
To further characterize CT2A and GL261 murine glioma 
models, each cell line was orthotopically engrafted into the 
right frontal hemisphere of immunocompetent C57BL/6 
mice (Fig. 3a). PBS-injected mice were included as sham 
controls. Brain samples were collected at humane endpoint 
for sci-RNA-seq3 profiling [67]. We profiled 159,270 single 
cells with a median of 1786 UMI/cell and 1055 gene/cells 
(Fig. 3b, Fig. S6). Glioma and resident brain cells were iden-
tified using a combination of differential-expression analyses 
(Fig. S7, Table S8) and label-transfers from reference atlases 
(Fig. S8) [31, 51, 85, 123]. Anatomic information was also 
assigned by means of label-transfer of the spatially-resolved 
brain atlas (10 × Genomics, Adult Mouse Brain FFPE data-
set; Fig. S9).
Owing to the lack of enrichment sorting prior to sci-
RNA-seq3 analysis, our sci-RNA-seq3 profiles represent 
an unbiased snapshot of the intracranial milieu. This was 
reflected by the diverse representation of cells, includ-
ing excitatory and inhibitory neurons, oligodendrocytes, 
astrocytes, lymphoid and myeloid cells, ependymal and 
meningeal cells, and CT2A or GL261 glioma cells (Fig. 3b, 
Fig. S7a, b, Fig. S8d). Inferred anatomic labels further reaf-
firm this diversity, with cell types arising from the cortex 
(CTX), cerebral nuclei (CNU), cerebellum (CB), hippocam-
pus (HIP), hypothalamus (HY), thalamus (TH) and ventri-
cles (VEN) (Fig. 3b, Fig. S9d).
Several markers distinguished GL261 and CT2A from 
non-malignant populations, including Hmga2, Piezo2, and 
B2m (Fig. S7a). In designing our experiments, we had inten-
tionally used male mice, hypothesizing that sex-specific 
markers would discriminate the female-derived glioma lines 
from male host cells. Contrary to expectations, we found 
that Xist, a female-specific transcript, was only upregulated 
in CT2A and not GL261 cells (Fig. S7a). Bnc2 and Moxd1 
were among the most sensitive and selective CT2A and 
GL261 markers, respectively, thereby representing gene 
markers than can be used to differentiate tumor cells from 
the surrounding microenvironment (Fig. S7a, b).
Glioma cells in vitro and in vivo have distinct 
transcriptomic signatures
We next assessed how the in vivo environment affects murine 
glioma biology (Fig. 4a). In vivo glioma cell engraftment 
led to increased transcriptomic dissimilarity (Fig. S10a) and 
decreased population purity (ROGUE score [56]; Fig. 4b) 
compared to in vitro conditions. Differential gene expression 
analysis revealed significant differences between in vitro 
and in vivo conditions in both glioma lines. Tcf4, a basic 
helix–loop–helix transcription factor that binds to specific 
DNA regulatory sequences (CANNTG) known as Ephrussi 
boxes (E-boxes) [114, 118], was the top up-regulated tran-
script in in vivo GL261 and CT2A cells, whereas Vim, a 
mesenchymal marker, was the top down-regulated transcript 
in vivo (Fig. 4c, Fig. S10b, Table S9). These transcriptomic 
changes were associated with a relative decrease (but not 
complete loss) of the mesenchymal-like phenotype and 
acquisition of oligodendrocyte progenitor-like (OPC) and 
neural progenitor-like (NPC) phenotype in both glioma mod-
els (Fig. 4d, e, Fig. S10c). Moreover, in vivo engraftment 
was associated with down-regulation of cell cycle, hypoxia 
and MYC-associated signaling (Fig. 4d, Fig. S10d–g).
We evaluated whether the differences acquired in vivo 
could be explained by Tcf4. We generated a clonal Tcf4 
knockout CT2A cell line (ΔTcf4) using CRISPR-Cas9 and 
orthotopically engrafted these ΔTcf4 cells into the right 
frontal hemisphere of immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. 
Tcf4 knockout led to upregulation of mesenchymal mark-
ers, including Col1a1, Col3a1, and Vim (Fig. 4f), and 
pathway analyses demonstrated significant enrichment for 
mesenchymal and MYC-related signaling (Fig. 4g). The 
ΔTcf4-associated signature effectively mimicked the gene 
expression profile in Tcf4-low in vitro glioma cells and was 
significantly depleted among the genes that were upregulated

in the in vivo setting (Fig. 4h, i). Consistent with the high 
cell cycle signature observed in Tcf4-low in vitro glioma 
cells and previous reports [77] (Fig. 4d, Fig. S10g), ΔTcf4 
CT2A cells proliferated significantly faster than parental 
cells (Fig. 4j).
Together these data demonstrated that GL261 and CT2A 
biology are influenced by environmental factors. Specifi-
cally, (i) in vivo glioma cells are more phenotypically het-
erogeneous than in vitro cells, (ii) in vivo engraftment of 
glioma cells impacts up-regulation of the NPC/OPC-like 
phenotype, and down-regulation of the mesenchymal-like 
phenotype, and (iii) in vitro cultures are more proliferative 
than in vivo glioma cells. Mechanistically, we found that the 
in vivo environment induces Tcf4 upregulation (or alleviates 
in vitro suppression), which in turn mediates these transcrip-
tomic changes.
GL261 and CT2A tumors recapitulate canonical GBM 
transcriptomic phenotypes
The extent to which CT2A and GL261 tumors recapitulate 
human gliomas was next examined at the transcriptomic 
level. Using a transfer-learning-based approach (see Meth-
ods), we found that in vivo CT2A and GL261 tumor cells 
(Fig. 5a) had a higher degree of transcriptomic similarity 
to human Grade 4 primary GBM tumors than Grade 1 
(low grade glioma; LGG) and recurrent Grade 4 recur-
rent GBMs (Fig. S11) [1, 120]. Given the resemblance

to human GBM, we sought to determine whether murine 
gliomas recapitulate canonical GBM expression programs 
[82, 111]. We performed unsupervised gene program dis-
covery using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in 
in vivo CT2A and GL261 cells (Fig. 5b, c, Table S10) and 
compared each program to established GBM and tumor-
associated gene signatures (Fig. 5d). For each program 
we compared activity levels between CT2A and GL261 
tumors (Fig. 5e, f), and evaluated the prognostic value 
using human survival data from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) program (Fig. S12).
Altogether, we identified 8 gene programs, G1-G8, 
representing CT2A and GL261 intrinsic processes; three 
were GL261-biased (G5, G7, G8), four were CT2A-
biased (G2, G3, G4, G6) and one was non-specific (G1; 
cell-cycle, 75 genes, e.g., Top2a) (Fig. 5c–e). G7 and G8 
were associated with favorable survival in human glioma 
patients. G7 (87 genes, e.g., Sox6 and Ptprz1) represented

a developmental-like program whereas G8 (99 genes, e.g., 
Met) had sparse functional annotations and was interpreted 
to be a GL261-specific signature. G5 [100 genes, e.g., 
Cd274 (encodes PD-L1), Irf1-2, Jak2, Tap1-2 and Stat1-
3] was a GL261-biased inflammatory program associated 
with unfavorable survival outcomes in human gliomas (Fig. 
S12). Among the CT2A-biased programs, 3 of 4 were asso-
ciated with mesenchymal processes. G4 (MES1; 88 genes, 
e.g., Fos/Fosb, Cd44, Nfkbiz and Vim) was associated with 
TNFα/NFκB signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal tran-
sition (EMT). G6 (MES2; 88 genes, e.g., Hk2 and Mxi1) was 
associated with glycolytic and hypoxic signaling. Finally, 
G2 (MES3; 79 genes, e.g., Prrx1, Pdgfra/Pdgfrb, Tfgb2 
and Col1a1) was associated with angiogenesis, EMT and 
invasion. Among these only G4 was associated with unfa-
vorable survival in glioma patients (Fig. S12). Finally, G3 
(93 genes, e.g., Mast4) was a CT2A-enriched program with 
no known functional associations, and was interpreted as 
a CT2A-specific signature, akin to its GL261 counterpart 
G8. CT2A-specific G3 and GL261-specific G8 likely repre-
sent cell-line intrinsic programs with uncertain relevance to 
human GBM biology.
CT2A-enriched G4 and G6 programs directly mapped 
to the mesenchymal MES1 and MES2 GBM programs 
described by Neftel et al., whereas GL261-enriched G7 pro-
gram mapped to Neftel’s OPC- and AC-like GBM programs 
[82]. Differential expression and pathway analysis corrobo-
rated these findings (Fig. S13).
In summary, CT2A and GL261 murine models reca-
pitulate the canonical transcriptomic phenotypes of human 
GBM, and position GL261 and CT2A as developmental- and 
mesenchymal-like glioma models, respectively.
Human and murine gliomas have common 
transcriptional regulators
GBM is a notoriously heterogeneous and plastic tumor so 
understanding the transcriptomic regulators that govern dif-
ferent states may expose opportunities to bias tumors toward 
more therapeutically vulnerable states. Having established 
that GL261 and CT2A recapitulate canonical GBM phe-
notypes, we sought to define the transcription regulators 
responsible for these states. We bioinformatically identi-
fied GBM-associated transcriptional regulators (GTRs, 
Table S11) using a random forest machine-learning based 
strategy implemented across seven independent human 
GBM cohorts (N = 146 tumors, Fig. S14a). Three pheno-
typic axes were identified encompassing developmental 
(23 GTRs), mesenchymal (12 GTRs), and cycling-related 
processes (22 GTRs, Fig. 6a, Fig. S14b–d). In addition to 
Tcf4, which was identified as a developmental transcrip-
tion factor, we selected 3 additional GTFs for experimental 
validation, including mesenchymal Wwtr1 and Prrx1, and 
developmental Nfia. For each candidate GTF, clonal GTR-
perturbed CT2A lines were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 
and engrafted into murine brains (Fig. S14e–h). At humane 
end point, mice were sacrificed, and brain tissue was sam-
pled and subject to sci-RNA-seq3 profiling to evaluate the 
effect of each GTF perturbation on glioma biology (Fig. 
S14i–l, Table S12).
As predicted bioinformatically, perturbation of mesen-
chymal GTRs Wwtr1 and Prrx1 resulted in developmental 
phenotypic shifts (Fig. 6b), whereas perturbation of develop-
mental GTRs Nfia and Tcf4 resulted in mesenchymal shifts 
(Fig. 4g, Fig. S14i–l). GTR perturbations also resulted in the 
differential expression of other GTRs in patterns expected 
based on their inferred phenotypes (Fig. S14i–l). Finally, 
Sox6, although not interrogated here, was abundantly 
expressed in GL261—but not CT2A—thereby supporting 
its role as a developmental GTR (Fig. S13b, c).
Lastly, to validate the cycling-related GTRs, we ana-
lyzed pooled loss-of-function genetic screens in CT2A and 
GL261 cells (Fig. 2, Table S7), as well as human GBM 
(Project Score database) [21, 87]. We reasoned that GTRs 
implicated in the cycling-related phenotypic axis could be 
associated with glioma fitness in vitro. Of the 22 predicted 
cycling GTRs, 9, 8, and 11 were essential genes in CT2A, 
GL261 and human GBM cell lines, respectively, and five 
were essential across all models (i.e., Bub3, Cenpa, Bard1, 
Brca1, and Mis18bp1; Fig. 6c). By contrast, developmental 
and mesenchymal GTRs were overwhelmingly non-essential 
for cellular fitness, except for mesenchymal Eno1 in GL261 
and CT2A, developmental Sox2/4/6 in GL261, and mes-
enchymal WWTR1 in human GBM lines (Fig. 4c). Among 
these off-target hits, Eno1 and Sox2/4/6 were inferred to have 
some cycling activity, thereby explaining their essentiality 
(Fig. S14b, Table S11).
These data represent a catalog of high-yield candidate 
GTRs and showcase the utility of CT2A in modeling GTR-
associated phenotypic shifts. Furthermore, we provide 
experimental evidence supporting Wwtr1 and Prrx1 as mes-
enchymal GTRs, Nfia and Tcf4 as developmental GTRs, and 
Bub3, Cenpa, Bard1, Brca1, and Mis18bp1 as cycling GTRs.
Myeloid recruitment and cytokine signaling 
patterns distinguish the CT2A and GL261 tumor 
immune microenvironments
Human GBM is regarded as an immunosuppressive tumor, 
and as immunotherapies emerge to address this challenge, 
it is beneficial to understand the TIME in preclinical CT2A 
and GL261 models that partly served as the basis for these 
clinical trials [70, 84]. Thus, we characterized the immune 
microenvironment in CT2A and GL261 glioma models. We 
digitally sorted lymphoid and myeloid immune populations 
from sham, CT2A- and GL261-engrafted mice brains, and

resolved 4 main types of immune cells with several distinct 
subpopulations observed at higher clustering resolutions: 
Macrophages (Mp; 7 subtypes), microglia (Mg; 2 subtypes), 
dendritic cells (DC; 2 subtypes), and T cells (TC; 3 sub-
types) (Fig. 7a, b).
To functionally annotate the immune populations, 
we performed NMF-based gene program discovery and 
resolved nine murine immune programs (denoted IM1-9; 
Fig. S15a–c; Table S13). The macrophage population was 
the most abundant and heterogeneous, consisting of distinct 
subpopulations involved in TNFα signaling (Mp-4 cells; 
IM3 program), IFN signaling (Mp-9 cells; IM5 program) 
and antigen presentation (Mp-8, Mp-9 and Mp-14 cells; 
IM9 program) (Fig. 7a, top heatmap). There were also mac-
rophages under hypoxic stress (Mp-4, Mp-5 and Mp-14 
cells; IM8 program). Among dendritic cells (DC), DC-12 
was associated with higher MHC class II-mediated antigen 
presentation (Cd74, H2-Ab1; IM9 program) whereas DC-15 
was more pro-inflammatory, consisting of higher TNFα 
(IM3) and IFN (IM5) signaling. Unlike the other myeloid 
lineages, microglial cells (P2ry12) were relatively homog-
enous. T cells varied in processes related to cell cycle (IM6)

and differentiation (IM1) and included a T-regulatory sub-
population (TC-11; Ctla4).
To determine the relevance of the TIME in GL261 and 
CT2A gliomas to human GBM, we evaluated the TIME 
across three human GBM cohorts [1, 82, 120]. Notably, 
biased sampling of immune cells from human samples 
(enrichment sorting) precluded direct compositional com-
parison of the murine and human TIMEs. Instead, we per-
formed unsupervised gene program discovery and annota-
tion using digitally sorted immune cells from human GBM 
samples and resolved ten human immune programs (denoted 
IH1-10; Fig. S15d, e, Table S13). We found that all murine 
immune programs were recapitulated in the human TIME 
(Fig. 7c, Fig. S15f), suggesting that the TIME in glioma-
engrafted mice recapitulates hallmark features of the human 
immune response in GBM.
To elucidate the cytokines driving these diverse immune 
gene programs, we leveraged a scRNA-seq-derived cytokine 
response dictionary to calculate immune response enrich-
ment scores (IRES) for each gene program (Fig. 7d, e) [15]. 
Select cytokines were non-specifically linked to multiple 
immune programs, like IL1a/b in the DC-specific response 
(IM4), T-cell differentiation (IM1), hypoxia (IM8), and 
antigen-presentation (IM9), suggesting pleiotropic and 
cell-type-specific cytokine responses. Conversely, other 
programs, like the microglial-specific response, were linked 
to multiple cytokines, including SCF, Noggin, and IL30. 
Notably, inflammatory TNFα (IM3) and Interferon (IM5) 
programs mapped to their cognate cytokines. Of the inferred 
cytokines, many were significantly enriched in CSF sam-
pled from glioma patients [22] including IFNγ (p = 0.015), 
TNFα (p = 0.052), EGF (p = 0.082), IL1b (p = 0.022), but not 
IL1a (p = 0.84), thereby linking the extracellular presence 
of select cytokines to the downstream responses observed 
in the TIME.
Earlier we reported distinct inflammatory responses in 
CT2A and GL261 tumor cells; CT2A tumors were asso-
ciated with TNFα/NFκB signaling (G4 program) whereas 
GL261 tumors had higher levels of IFN signaling (G7 pro-
gram) (Fig. 5d–f). This led us to hypothesize that CT2A 
and GL261 have distinct intrinsic sensitivities to different 
cytokines. To test this, we performed cell viability assays 
in CT2A and GL261 cells treated with IFNγ and TNFα 
(Fig. 7g). GL261 cells ­(IC50IFNγ < 5 ng/mL) were > 20-fold 
more sensitive to IFNγ than CT2A cells ­(IC50IFNγ = 120 ng/
mL), whereas the inverse was observed in TNFα treated 
GL261 ­(IC50TNFα = 85 ng/mL) and CT2A ­(IC50TNFα < 5 ng/
mL) cells.
Finally, we evaluated the composition of the TIME in 
CT2A and GL261-engrafted mice. The relative abundance 
of immune cells in CT2A (5.3%) and GL261 (2.1%) was 
significantly higher than sham (1.1%) (Fig. 7h). Regardless 
of glioma model, tumor engraftment was associated with 
significant infiltration of pro-inflammatory (IFN-signaling) 
macrophages (Mp-9), cycling T-cells [TC-6 and TC-11 
(Ctla-positive T regulatory cells)], and antigen-presenting 
(DC-12) and pro-inflammatory (DC-15) dendritic cells 
(Fig. 7i). Comparison of CT2A and GL261 immune infil-
trates showed that Mp-4 and Mp-8 macrophage popula-
tions were unique to CT2A tumors, and otherwise absent 
in sham control and GL261-engrafted mice (Fig. 7i, j). In 
contrast, Mg-3 and to a lesser extent Mg-2 microglia were 
over-represented in the GL261 TIME compared to CT2A. 
T-cells and dendritic cells were equally represented in both 
tumor models.
To summarize, here we characterized the TIME in GL261 
and CT2A tumors, including the active immune programs 
and their associated cytokines, and TIME composition.
Intrinsic immune evasion of stem‑like glioma cells
Given the prevalent heterogeneity in GBM, we hypothesized 
there to be intra-tumoral variation in immune evasion activ-
ity. We performed NMF to identify evasion genes with com-
mon patterns of expression in CT2A tumors (Fig. 8a). Of the 
265 evasion genes identified (Fig. 1, Table S6), 114 genes 
reproducibly clustered into two gene programs, denoted as 
evasion phenotype E1 (57 genes) and E2 (57 genes) (Fig. 8b, 
Table S14). E1 and E2 activities were negatively correlated 
(r = − 0.33) and delineated two mutually exclusive glioma 
subpopulations (Fig. 8c). Interestingly, each evasion pheno-
type was comprised of a mixture of resister and sensitizer 
hits (Fig. 8d), with little overlap with Lawson’s core eva-
sion genes (Fig. 8e) [52], possibly reflecting glioma speci-
ficity. E1 was associated with sensitizer genes implicated in 
Toll-like receptor signaling, and resister genes implicated 
in TGFβ/SMAD signaling and Runx1/Chromatin regula-
tion resisters (Fig. 8f). Alternatively, E2 was associated 
with sensitizer genes involved in chromatin remodeling and 
resister genes involved in apoptosis and GPI anchor activity 
(Fig. 8f). We also explored which glioma state each eva-
sion phenotype was associated with. Using a curated list 
of tumor/glioma-associated gene programs, intratumoral 
correlations were calculated and pooled across 69 human 
tumors from three independent human cohorts [1, 113]. This 
revealed that the E1 and E2 phenotype activities were cor-
related with neurodevelopmental and stem-like GBM states, 
respectively (Fig. 8g, h).
We next evaluated clinical correlates for each eva-
sion phenotype. Meta-analysis of survival data from sev-
eral human glioma cohorts (973 LGG patients across two 
cohorts and 638 GBM patients across five cohorts) revealed 
that high E2 activity was associated with worse survival 
outcomes in LGG [HR (95% CI) = 4954 (577, 42,498); 
p < 0.0001, I2 = 0%] and GBM [HR (95% CI) = 10.9 (1.7, 
71.5); p = 0.013, I2 = 64%] (Fig. 8i). In other words, this

corresponded to a 50.4-month and 5.4-month survival differ-
ence in LGG and GBM patients, respectively, when stratified 
by E2 activity levels (Fig. 8j). E2 activity was also positively 
associated with WHO grade gliomas in the TCGA (Fig. 8k, 
p = 1.65 × ­10–29) and CCGA (Fig.  8l, p = 1.23 × ­10–14) 
cohorts, and with GBM recurrence across three additional 
cohorts profiled by scRNA-seq (Fig. 8m, p = 0.046). Unlike 
E2, the E1 phenotype had no significant clinical correlates 
(data not shown). Finally, we hypothesized that tumor-intrin-
sic evasion phenotypes can be leveraged to predict response 
to ICIs. Using RNA-seq profiles obtained from patients at 
baseline (i.e., prior to immunotherapy) [125], we found 
that E2 was significantly upregulated in ICI (PD-1 inhibi-
tor) responders (Fig. 8n, p = 0.024). We benchmarked the 
evasion phenotype signatures against other immunotherapy 
response indices that have been proposed, including CD274

formed all, with an AUROC of 0.74 (Fig. 8o, p).
Overall, these findings show that intrinsic immune eva-
sion genes have distinct patterns of expression, E1 and E2. 
E2 represents the more clinically relevant phenotype and 
delineates a subpopulation of stem-like GBM cells that are 
associated with worse prognosis, higher WHO grade and 
tumor recurrence. Importantly, high E2 activity is predictive 
of ICI response, and outperforms all other predictive indices.
Discussion
In the current study we evaluated data from single-cell RNA 
sequencing and genome-wide pooled CRISPR screening 
approaches to compare and contrast functional dependen-
cies present in two syngeneic murine models of glioma. Not 
surprisingly, comparison of in vitro and in vivo snRNA-seq 
profiles demonstrated a profound influence of the in vivo 
microenvironment on cell state, resulting in increased tumor 
heterogeneity, downregulation of the mesenchymal state and 
stress response, and lower proliferative capacity secondary 
to Tcf4 upregulation. Unsupervised gene program discov-
ery in in vivo tumor cells further revealed that CT2A and 
GL261 cells are mesenchymal- and developmental-like 
tumors, respectively. The gene programs in human GBM 
and murine glioma were regulated by common GTFs, and 
we experimentally validated several developmental (Nfia, 
Tcf4), mesenchymal (Prrx1 and Wwtr1) and cycling-asso-
ciated (Bub3, Cenpa, Bard1, Brca1, and Mis18bp1) GTFs 
in CT2A glioma cells. Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens 
revealed distinct genetic dependencies in CT2A (epigenetic 
and post-translational regulation) and GL261 (metabolic) 
cells and demonstrated that murine gliomas recapitulate 
various GBM-specific genetic dependencies (e.g., UFMyla-
tion in GL261). Moreover, the murine TIME was found to 
be macrophage-dominant in CT2A tumors, and microglial-
dominant in GL261 tumors. Immune-glioma co-culture 
screens established NFκB signaling, autophagy/endosome 
machinery, and chromatin remodeling as the predominant 
mechanisms of CT2A-intrinsic immune evasion. Lastly, we 
discovered that cancer intrinsic immune evasion genes have 
heterogeneous patterns of expression. Specifically, the E2 
evasion phenotype was associated with a stem-like GBM 
subpopulation that was correlated with prognosis, WHO 
grade and recurrence, and predicted response to ICI.
Glioma cells engrafted orthotopically are subject to 
selective in vivo pressures that include nutrient limitations, 
hypoxia (21% oxygen in vitro versus 0.3–7.4% in vivo 
[74]), and immune cell interactions, while in vitro cells are 
exposed to artificial culture substrates and media. The tran-
scriptomic changes observed upon in vivo CT2A and GL261 
tumor engraftment revealed significant downregulation of 
proliferation and mesenchymal programs, thereby confirm-
ing reports by others in GL261 and 4T1 murine mammary 
carcinoma cells [25, 35]. Notably, 13% of genes in the mes-
enchymal signature (Neftel MES2 [82]) overlapped with 
the in vitro stress signature [26] (including DDIT3, HSPA5 
and HSPA9), and these were downregulated upon in vivo 
engraftment. This raises the distinct possibility that the mes-
enchymal state in vitro is an artifact of in vitro stress, as sug-
gested by others [49]. However, the TCF4 gene product has 
also been proposed as a metabolic sensor that is upregulated 
in response to metabolic demands [7]. High glucose concen-
trations in DMEM have been associated with epithelial-to-
mesenchymal (EMT; e.g., Vim, Cd44) upregulation in MDA-
MB-231 breast cancer cells [48]. Similarly, hyperglycemia 
has induced EMT and HIF1a/hypoxia signaling in other cell 
lines [36, 95, 108]. While this supports a model in which 
limited in vivo glucose availability induces mesenchymal 
downregulation in a Tcf4-dependent manner, further experi-
mental investigations were out of the scope of the current 
study. Instead, we found that perturbation of Tcf4, which was 
upregulated in vivo, was able to revert many of the in vivo-
induced changes back to an in vitro-like state, specifically 
leading to increased cell cycle and mesenchymal-like pro-
gram activities. TCF4:TCF12 dimer activity in a primary 
GBM line was previously shown to inhibit cellular prolifera-
tion and suppress POSTN expression, while TCF4 knock-
down led to increased POSTN expression, similar to that 
seen in our experiments [77]. Periostin, encoded by Postn, 
promotes EMT, invasion and integrin-mediated adhesion in 
glioma cells [76], and its negative regulation by Tcf4 may 
in part explain the mesenchymal shift observed in vitro and 
in Tcf4-perturbed glioma cells.
Intratumoral heterogeneity is a hallmark feature of human 
GBMs, and the subtypes of GBM have been exhaustively 
characterized and include the Verhaak subtypes (classical, 
mesenchymal, proneural and neural) [111], Neftel subtypes 
(MES; mesenchymal, OPC; oligodendrocyte progenitor-like 
cells, NPC; neural progenitor-like cells, and AC; astrocyte-
like cells) [82], and Richards subtypes (developmental and 
injury-response) [92]. Our unsupervised gene program 
discovery revealed that CT2A and GL261 gliomas are pre-
dominantly mesenchymal- and developmental like tumors, 
respectfully, as suggested by others [37]. Importantly, per-
turbation of developmental (Nfia, Tcf4) and mesenchymal 
(Wwtr1, Prrx1) GTRs led to reciprocal phenotypic shifts. 
Many of the GTRs predicted here have been implicated in 
GBM by others in shaping GBM identity, including EZH2 
[62, 124], FOXM1 [28, 54], NFIA/B [12, 27, 53, 69, 121], 
OLIG1/2 [3, 80, 86, 93], SOX2 [5, 8, 104], SOX4 [55, 61,

115], SOX6 [109], SOX8 [39, 96], TCF4 [24, 77], TCF12 
[88, 127], and ZEB1 [12, 41].
 CT2A and GL261 engraftment resulted in significant 
immune recruitment. Among the myeloid compartment, 
macrophages were overrepresented in CT2A tumors whereas 
microglia were overrepresented in GL261 tumors, thereby 
confirming earlier reports [45, 57]. Although tumor-associ-
ated dendritic cell infiltrates were similar in both models, 
they were still higher than that observed in human GBM 
[45]. CT2A cells secrete significantly higher levels of mye-
loid chemokines (including CCL-2, CCL-5 and CCL-22) 
than GL261s [37], possibly contributing to the differen-
tial pattern of myeloid recruitment. Owing to the limited 
recovery of rare cell types by sci-RNA-seq3 [18], we were 
unable to detect NK, NKT, and B-cells, which are known 
to be present in GL261 and CT2A TIMEs [45, 50, 72, 85]. 
Using mass cytometry, Khalsa et al. reported no significant 
differences in the abundance of T cell, NK, NKT or B cell 
fractions between GL261 and CT2A tumors [45]. We also 
observed no differences in the T cell populations infiltrating 
the two models; however, Khan et al. showed that CT2A 
tumors were enriched for exhausted CD8+ and regula-
tor CD4+ T cells, whereas GL261 tumors were enriched 
for progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells [46]. Although the 
TIME composition in GL261 more closely resembles human 
GBMs than CT2A [45], the murine TIME shares key gene 
programs that are characteristic of human GBMs, including 
TNF, IFN, and hypoxia.
Gene perturbations conferring resistance to immune cell 
killing revealed common and distinct anti-tumor mecha-
nisms in different immune populations. CTLs mediated 
CT2A killing via TNF (Tnfrsf1a and Tnfrsf1b) and IFN 
(Ifngr1 and Ifngr2), whereas non-phagocytic myeloid cells 
predominantly relied on TNF (Tnfrsf1a). Notably, NK-medi-
ated cytotoxicity was dependent on GPI anchor-mediated 
signaling (e.g., Piga, Pigh, Pigm, etc.) and UL16-binding 
protein (Raet1e). GPI anchors are essential for the surface 
expression of UL16-binding proteins (i.e., ligands for the 
activating NK cell receptor NKG2D [19]) and subsequent 
secretion of cytolytic granzyme and perforin from NK cells 
[75]. Although other NK screens have implicated TNF, IFN 
or antigen-presentation in NK-mediated cytotoxicity, we 
were unable to reproduce these findings. However, there 
was a report that impaired TNF-mediated signaling (e.g., 
TNFRSF10A, TNFRSF10B) conferred resistance to NK 
killing in GPI-deficient HAP1 cells thereby suggesting that 
GPI anchor resistance may mask the effects of other anti-
tumor mediators [6, 44, 100]. Phagocytic myeloid evasion 
was dependent on known phagocytosis inhibitors Cd47 and 
Apmap [43].
Our sci-RNA-seq3 analyses supported the abundance of 
TNF and IFN in the TIME, albeit with noteworthy differ-
ences between CT2A and GL261. CT2A tumors (G4-MES1 
program) and macrophages (Mp-4 population) had higher 
levels of TNF signaling compared to GL261. Conversely, 
IFN signaling was similar among macrophages (Mp-9 
population) infiltrating CT2A and GL261 tumors, but only 
observed in GL261 tumor cells (G5-Inflammatory pro-
gram). The attenuated IFN response in CT2A tumor cells, 
confirmed by our IFN dose–response experiment, was due 
to intrinsic resistance of CT2A to IFN secondary to known 
single-copy deletions of chromosomal regions encompassing 
type I IFN genes, and Stat2, Stat6, and Ifng [37]. However, 
despite this reduced sensitivity, impaired IFN signaling still 
conferred resistance to CTL killing in CT2A cells. Defects 
in IFN response have been associated with resistance to 
checkpoint immunotherapy [17, 20], thus positioning the 
CT2A line as a relevant preclinical model for optimizing 
immunotherapies.
The autophagy-NFκB axis has previously been implicated 
in the immune evasion of various cancers to CTLs [117]. 
Our work expands this to encompass additional immune 
cells, including myeloid and NK cells, thereby establishing 
the autophagy-NFκB axis as pan-immune evasion pathway. 
NFκB signaling deficits are known to sensitize tumor cells to 
immune cell killing by promoting Caspase 8-mediated apop-
tosis downstream of TNF signaling (e.g., Rnf31) [23, 52] and 
upregulating expression of MHC1 (e.g., Tnip) [105]. Simi-
larly, autophagy mediates tumor immune evasion through 
multiple mechanisms, including granzyme clearance (e.g., 
Vps4bi, Atg5) [23] and TNF resistance (e.g., Atg12) [52]. 
Consistent with this, we showed that autophagy-deficient 
CT2A tumors (ΔAtg12) were associated with elevated TNFα 
and apoptotic signaling, and favorable survival outcomes.
 Contrary to other tumors [52], we found that CTL-medi-
ated cytotoxicity in CT2A cells was independent of MHC1 
antigen presentation (e.g., B2m, H2-K1, Psmb9, Tap2). 
Iorgulescu et al. reported that CT2A cells harbor multiple 
mutations in antigen presentation machinery (e.g., Tap1 
p.Y488C, Psmb8 p.A275P), although the defect in MHC1 
expression could be overcome with IFNγ treatment [37]. 
Consistent with this, we found that perturbation of Ptpn2, a 
protein tyrosine phosphatase that negatively regulates IFNγ-
mediated effects on antigen presentation [65], sensitized 
CT2A cells to CTL killing. Human GBMs are among the 
most common tumors associated with loss of MHC1 expres-
sion (e.g., HLA, β2M), and MHC1 loss is independently 
associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes [17]. In some 
1p/19q intact IDH-mutant gliomas, recurrence is associ-
ated with loss of heterozygosity in HLA genes [110]. These 
findings position CT2A as a relevant preclinical model of 
MHC1-deficiency in which to study immunotherapies.
We showed that immune evasion genes were heterogene-
ously expressed, with a subset (E2) enriched among stem-
like GBM cells. This goes to suggest that mechanisms of 
immune evasion can vary even within individual tumors.

Moreover, it has been hypothesized that immunosuppressive 
factors are enriched among stem-like tumor cells to establish 
an immune-privileged microenvironment in which clonal 
diversification and expansion can occur [79]. Perturba-
tion of Sox2, a known stemness marker, sensitized CT2A 
cells to J774- and CTL-mediated cytotoxicity (Table S6). 
Others have also shown that glioma stem cells escape 
immune surveillance by downregulating antigen presenta-
tion [98]. Notable evasion mechanisms captured in the E2 
signature included the phagocytic inhibition (Apmap), TNF 
(Tnfrsf1a) and interferon (Ifngr2) signaling, GPI anchorage 
(Pigt, Gpaa1, Dpm3), and NFκB signaling (Nfkb2), thereby 
reflecting a multimodal evasion phenotype. The E2 signature 
outperformed other immune indices in predicting response 
to immune checkpoint inhibitors in GBM patients with a 
competitive AUROC of 0.74. This highlights the transla-
tional capacity of CT2A gliomas in identifying mechanisms 
of immune evasion, with direct implications for identifying 
patients that will response to ICI therapy.
This study was not without limitations: (i) We were una-
ble to recover rare cell populations using sci-RNA-seq3. 
Furthermore, sci-RNA-seq3 experiments involving Atg12 
and GTR-perturbed CT2A cells did not recover any immune 
cells, thereby precluding the evaluation of the TIME in these 
tumors. (ii) Immune co-culture screens were only performed 
in CT2A cells. (iii) While our GTR inference was able to 
reliably identify GBM phenotype-associated GTRs, the 
direction of regulation at times could not always be reliably 
inferred by our approach. For example, Tcf12 and Zeb1 were 
predicted to promote a developmental phenotype, where in 
fact the associations are negative [41, 88].
Our study offers relevant insights into the biology of 
GL261 and CT2A and serves to bridge the gap between 
murine models and human GBM.
