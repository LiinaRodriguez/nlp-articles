Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a critical lipid raft protein playing dual roles as both a tumor suppressor and promoter. While its role in
tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis has been recognized, the explicit contribution of Cav-1 to the onset of lung metastasis
from primary breast malignancies remains unclear. Here, we present the ﬁrst evidence that Cav-1 knockout in mammary epithelial
cells signiﬁcantly reduces lung metastasis in syngeneic breast cancer mouse models. In vitro, Cav-1 knockout in 4T1 cells
suppressed extracellular vesicle secretion, cellular motility, and MMP secretion compared to controls. Complementing this, in vivo
analyses demonstrated a marked reduction in lung metastatic foci in mice injected with Cav-1 knockout 4T1 cells as compared to
wild-type cells, which was further corroborated by mRNA proﬁling of the primary tumor. We identiﬁed 21 epithelial cell migration
genes exhibiting varied expression in tumors derived from Cav-1 knockout and wild-type 4T1 cells. Correlation analysis and
immunoblotting further revealed that Cav-1 might regulate metastasis via integrin α3 (ITGα3). In silico protein docking predicted an
interaction between Cav-1 and ITGα3, which was conﬁrmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, Cav-1 and ITGα3 knockdown
corroborated its role in metastasis in the cell migration assay.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer (BC) remains the most prevalent malignancy among
women worldwide, and as of 2022, it is the second leading cause
of cancer-related death [1]. The majority of fatalities in BC are
caused by metastasis, which accounts for nearly 90% of deaths
associated with the disease [2–7]. Despite early detection and
treatment advances, metastatic BC remains a signiﬁcant clinical
challenge.
The metastatic spread of BC is enabled by complex interactions
between tumor cells and the microenvironment of distant organs
[8]. A key step is the formation of a premetastatic niche in target
organs, which is facilitated by tumor-secreted
factors and
signaling pathways [9]. The complexity of these interactions is
highlighted by recent studies revealing the role of Toll-like
receptor 4 (TLR4) in creating premetastatic niches for metastatic
cancer stem cells [10]. Critical regulators of metastasis via tumor
microenvironmental effects include the CXCR7 signaling axis,
which
promotes
the
growth
and
progression
of
BC
[11].
Furthermore, the importance of the tumor microenvironment
and metastatic niche in cancer progression is underscored by their
ability to suppress metastases [9, 12, 13]. These ﬁndings indicate
that the metastatic journey of BC cells is shaped by crosstalk
between the tumor and its microenvironment at distant sites,
which requires the formation of a premetastatic niche.
Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a protein associated with lipid rafts, plays
various roles in cellular processes such as signal transduction and
angiogenesis. Its role in cancer is complex, acting both as a tumor
suppressor and as an oncogene, depending on the type and stage
of cancer [14–20]. Aberrant Cav-1 expression in BC suggests its
involvement in disease progression [14, 21–23]. This is particularly
evident in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype
characterized by the absence of estrogen, progesterone, and
HER2 receptors, and is associated with a poor prognosis and high
recurrence rates [24, 25]. Studies have shown that downregulation
of Cav-1 in TNBC cells hampers the formation of invadopodia and
lung colonization upon intravenous injection into the tail vein of
BALB/c mice, highlighting its potential role in metastasis [25, 26].
Furthermore, Cav-1 polymorphisms have been associated with an
increased risk of recurrence and contralateral BC [27].
Despite considerable research, the speciﬁc contribution of Cav-1
to BC metastasis is not fully understood. Sloan et al. highlighted
the prognostic importance of stromal Cav-1 expression, noting that
its loss in tumors is strongly related to increased metastasis and
poorer outcomes [28]. Furthermore, Burrows et al. suggested that
Cav-1 expression in mammary ﬁbroblasts could suppress BC cell
growth and migration, indicating its potential tumor suppressor
role [29]. Their research revealed a regulatory effect of Cav-1 on
cytokine secretion, such as IL-6, from stromal cells, which could

inﬂuence the metastatic processes. Wang et al. explored how
tumor-derived Cav-1 contributes to lung metastasis and discov-
ered that it can be transported via exosomes to metastatic sites,
where it modulates gene expression related to premetastatic niche
formation and secretion of inﬂammatory chemokines in lung
epithelial cells. Additionally, Cav-1 promotes the deposition of the
extracellular matrix by lung ﬁbroblasts and facilitates angiogenesis
by inducing M2 macrophage polarization [25].
Integrin-α3 (ITGα3), a subunit of integrin receptors and key
facilitator of cell adhesion and migration, is highly expressed in
malignant cancers. It is important to note that Cav-1 and ITGα3
play signiﬁcant roles in various cellular processes, including cell
adhesion, migration, and signaling pathways, which are crucial in
both normal physiology and disease states. Silencing ITGα3
expression in pancreatic cancer cells signiﬁcantly inhibits cell
viability and migration, indicating its role in cancer aggressiveness
[30]. Similarly, in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), ITGα3
overexpression is associated with adverse clinicopathological
features and poor survival outcomes, further underscoring its
oncogenic potential [31]. Notably, in hepatocellular carcinoma,
Cav-1 enhances invasion and metastasis by upregulating Pofut1
expression [32], suggesting a broader oncogenic role. Collectively,
these insights underscore Cav-1’s multifaceted involvement in the
promotion of metastasis in different types of cancers. However,
the reliance on in vitro systems and intravenous injection models
in these studies, although informative, may not fully capture
intricate biological interactions occurring in vivo [33, 34]. These
ﬁndings indicate that Cav-1 and ITGα3 are integral to the
regulation of cellular processes and might contribute to lung
metastasis in the BC model.
In this study, we aimed to elucidate how Cav-1 inﬂuences the
molecular mechanisms underlying TNBC metastasis. We employed
the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool to generate Cav-1 deﬁcient 4T1
murine mammary carcinoma cells. By implanting Cav-1 KO and
WT 4T1 cells into female BALB/c mice, we examined the effect of
Cav-1 ablation on TNBC progression and lung metastasis in
primary tumors. In-depth gene expression analysis after Cav-1
knockout provided further insights into the molecular under-
pinnings of its role in facilitating metastasis. A signiﬁcant
component of our study was the examination of the interaction
between Cav-1 and ITGα3. Our principal goal was to decipher the
complex mechanisms by which Cav-1 promotes the dissemination
of BC cells, emphasizing its effects on the premetastatic signaling
pathways.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and development of Cav-1 genetic knockout cells
4T1 carcinoma cells, derived from the mammary gland tissues of BALB/c
mice (ATCC, Cat No# CRL-2539™), were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium
(ATCC, Cat#30-2001™) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS,
Thermoﬁsher
Cat#
10438026)
and
1%
v/v
Penicillin-Streptomycin
(Cat#2020-06-30). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.
Cav-1 gene deletion was performed using a pre-designed and validated
Mouse CAV1 Gene Knockout Kit (OriGene Technologies, Cat#: KN502589),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, 0.3 × 106 cells were
seeded in a 6-well plate and incubated for 24 h in a CO2 incubator. Upon
reaching 70–80% conﬂuency, cells were transfected with a plasmid
harboring gRNA targeting Cav-1 (KN502589G1 or KN502589G2) and a GFP-
tagged donor vector using TurboFectin 8.0 Transfection Reagent (CAT#:
TF81001). Following a 48-h incubation, the cells were diluted in a 1:10 ratio
and grown for 3 days. Cells were seeded at an extremely low density in
6-well plates to obtain single-cell colonies and were allowed to grow for
5 days. Subsequently, individual cells were selected under a microscope
using a 20 μL pipette tip and cultivated into colonies. Each resulting colony
was split into two groups in the following week: one for further expansion
and the other for veriﬁcation of Cav-1 KO by immunoblotting. Multiple
single-cell Cav-1 KO and WT cells were isolated after the same number of
passages. Puriﬁed Cav-1 KO and WT 4T1 cells were used for subsequent
in vitro and in vivo experiments.
MTT assay
To assess the impact of Cav-1 KO on cell growth, we performed an MTT
assay using the Vybrant® MTT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (V-13154)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Brieﬂy, 5000 WT and Cav-1
KO 4T1 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and allowed to grow for 48 h.
After this period, 10 µL of MTT solution (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-
diphenyltetrazolium bromide) from a 12 mM stock was added to each well
containing 100 µL of cell culture medium, followed by incubation at 37 °C
for 2 h. Subsequently, 100 µL of 100 mg/mL SDS solution in 0.01 M HCl was
added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for an additional
2 h. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm, and a standard curve
(absorbance vs. cell number) was generated to evaluate the effect of
Cav-1 KO on cell growth in KO cells relative to the WT control.
Immunoblotting
The peripheral zone of the tumor tissue was lysed in 1X RIPA buffer
containing 1x protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (ab201119,
Abcam). The insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000×g
for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein quantiﬁcation was performed using a Pierce™
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc™, Cat#23225) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Equal amounts of protein were mixed to make
a ﬁnal 1X Laemmli Sample Buffer (Cat# 161-0747) (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA) containing 2-mercaptoethanol and heated for 7–10 min at 95 °C.
Approximately 15 mg of protein was loaded into each well and separated
using SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred onto a PVDF membrane
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and blocked with 5% skimmed milk for
45–90 min. After blocking, membranes were incubated overnight with
primary antibodies against Cav-1 (Cat # sc-3238S, Santa Cruz Biotechnol-
ogy), ITGα3 (Cat # sc-374242, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and ITGβ4 (Cat #
sc-514426, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). GAPDH from CST (Cat# 5174, Cell
Signaling Technology) served as the loading control for the assay. HRP-
labeled secondary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:2000. Blots were
developed using ProSignal® Dura ECL Reagent (Cat# 20-301B, Prometheus
Protein Biology Products) and visualized using a ChemiDoc Imaging
System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Band intensity was quantiﬁed using
Image Lab software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
Mitochondrial stress assay
Approximately 2.5 × 104 4T1 cells were seeded in RPMI-1640 medium (Cat
# 30-2001TM) supplemented with 10% FBS (Cat# 10438026) and 1% v/v
penicillin-streptomycin (Cat # 2020-06-30) in Agilent Seahorse XF24 cell
culture
microplates
(Cat#
100777-004),
excluding
four
background
temperature correction wells. The cells were incubated for 12–18 h at
37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Sensor cartridges were hydrated with 200 μL
of Seahorse XF calibrant and placed in a 37 °C humidiﬁed incubator
without CO2 for 12–18 h. Fresh Seahorse assay medium was prepared and
prewarmed at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were gently washed three
times with assay medium and then incubated in fresh assay medium for
1 h in a non-CO2, humidiﬁed 37 °C incubator. Oligomycin, FCCP (carbonyl
cyanide 4-(triﬂuoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone), and rotenone/antimycin
were diluted in assay medium to ﬁnal working concentrations of 2.0 μM
(oligomycin), 1.0 μM (FCCP), and 0.5 μM (rotenone/antimycin), respectively.
Assay protocols were established as follows: baseline, 3 cycles; injection
port A (oligomycin), 3 cycles; injection port B (FCCP), 3 cycles; and injection
port C (Rotenone/antimycin A), 3 cycles. Each cycle consisted of an initial
mix for 3 min, followed by a measurement of 3 min. After the cycles, data
were acquired and normalized to the protein concentration. Wave
software was used for data analysis, and normalization was performed
based on protein concentration.
Cell cycle assay
Approximately 0.5 × 106 4T1 cells were seeded in Corning™Costar™6-well
Clear TC-treated plates (Cat# 07-200-83) using RPMI-1640 (Cat#30-2001)
complete medium and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.
After incubation, the cells were synchronized by replacing the complete
medium with RPMI without FBS and incubating for 24 h. After the
synchronization period, the FBS-free RPMI medium was replaced with a
complete medium, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. The
cell cycle assay was performed using propidium iodide (PI) ﬂow cytometry
kit (ab139418) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were
rinsed with 1X PBS, trypsinized, and collected in a complete medium. Cells
were ﬁxed in 66% ice-cold ethanol for 2 h at 4 °C and stained with 1X PI. PI
ﬂuorescence data were collected using ﬂow cytometry with 488 nm laser

illumination, utilizing appropriate forward and side scatter (FSC vs. SSC)
settings.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
Polymethyl pentene plastic coverslips were used for cell growth in
preparation for SEM analysis. Sterilized plastic coverslips were placed in a
6-well plate, and 0.5 × 106 WT and Cav-1 KO 4T1 cells were seeded in
complete media, followed by incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.
After 24 h, once the cells reached full conﬂuence, they were washed with
1X PBS and ﬁxed in a solution containing 1.25% glutaraldehyde and 2%
formaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (CAC) buffer for 2 h at room
temperature. The ﬁxation buffer was replaced with a fresh ﬁxation buffer
and incubated at 4 °C. Subsequently, cells were washed with wash buffer
(0.1 M CAC buffer with 5% sucrose), and post-ﬁxation was performed using
1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M CAC buffer for 1 h. After ﬁxation, cells were
dehydrated using a series of ethanol concentration gradients. Following
dehydration, the specimens were dried, mounted on a stub for metal
coating, and subsequently analyzed using a JSM-6610 LV scanning
electron microscope for membrane characterization.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
WT and Cav-1 KO 4T1 cells were grown and ﬁxed using the same protocol
as described in the SEM section. After ﬁxation, the cells were washed and
stained en bloc with 2% uranyl acetate in water at room temperature for
1 h. After en bloc staining, cells were dehydrated using a series of
concentrations of ethanol (EtOH). Subsequently, the cells were inﬁltrated
with epoxy resin and incubated at 60 °C for polymerization, which took
24–48 h. After polymerization, ultrathin sections of the specimens were
obtained using a microtome. These sections were then observed under a
JEM-1400
TEM
optimized
for
high-contrast
imaging
at
various
magniﬁcations.
Exosome quantiﬁcation
To quantify exosome secretion, equal numbers of 4T1, WT, and Cav-1 KO
cells were plated in 6-well plates and allowed to grow for 24 h. After this
initial growth period, the cells were cultured in a fresh medium devoid of
fetal bovine serum (FBS) to eliminate potential exosome contamination
from the serum. After an additional 24 h, exosomes were isolated from
1 mL of the conditioned media, and immunoblotting for exosome markers,
Annexin-V, and Alix was performed.
Tumor development in a syngeneic mouse model
Six-week-old female BALB/c mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory
and housed in the Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine of the LSU
School of Veterinary Medicine for 4 weeks. At 10 weeks of age, the animals
were weighed and randomly assigned to the WT group (mice that received
WT-4T1 cells) or the Cav-1 KO group (mice that received Cav-1 KO-
4T1 cells). Mice were anesthetized, and equal numbers of 4T1 cells (either
WT or Cav-1 KO) were resuspended in Corning® Matrigel® basement
membrane matrix (Corning, Cat#356237) and injected into the mammary
fat pads of the mice. Tumor growth was monitored for four weeks after
injection. Tumor and lung tissues were harvested at the end of weeks 2, 3,
and 4. In a temporally controlled manner, peripheral tumor regions were
excised at designated time points (weeks 2 and 3) to exclude centrally
located necrotic tissue. The excised tissues were then subjected to mRNA
expression proﬁling.
The lungs were perfused with 1% low-melting agarose and ﬁxed with
paraformaldehyde (PFA). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was
performed to examine lung metastasis in BC. Furthermore, to quantify
the lung metastasis, single cell suspension was prepared using the fresh
lungs from WT and Cav-1 KO, 4T1 injected mice after 3 weeks. These
single-cell suspensions were allowed to grow in complete media contain-
ing 6-thioguanine (6-TG). After a week, the total number of growing cells
was counted.
RNA isolation, characterization, and sequencing
Total mRNA was isolated from the peripheral zone of the tumor using
the Direct-zol RNA Kit (Cat# R2072) (Zymo Research, Irwin, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA concentration was measured
using a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc
Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA) at a wavelength of 260/280 nm. RNA quality
and integrity were conﬁrmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and
fragment
analyzer
(Agilent
2100
Bioanalyzer).
Samples with RNA
Integrity Numbers (RIN) ranging from 6.7 to 9.3 were used for the
preparation of the cDNA library and the sequencing of mRNA. Total RNA
quality was veriﬁed at the Novogene Next-Generation Sequencing
Facility. RNA samples with RIN values greater than six were selected, and
mRNA enrichment was performed using poly T oligo-attached magnetic
beads. After
enrichment
and fragmentation, cDNA libraries were
prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina,
following the manufacturer’s protocol. The cDNA library was quantiﬁed
using Qubit and real-time PCR, and a bioanalyzer was used for size
distribution analysis. Index-coded samples were clustered according to
the manufacturer’s instructions, the library was sequenced on an
Illumina platform (Illumina NovaSeq PE150), and paired-end reads were
generated. Raw sequencing data could be found on NCBI SRA accession
number PRJNA1098697.
Sequencing data analysis
Illumina sequencing reads (fastq ﬁles) were initially processed using Perl
scripts to remove reads containing adapters, poly-N sequences, and low-
quality reads from raw data. Q20, Q30, and the GC content were also
calculated. All downstream analyses were conducted using clean high-
quality sequencing data. The reference genome and gene annotation
models were obtained from the genome website, and the genome index
was built using Hisat2 v2.0.5. Clean reads at the paired end were aligned
with the reference genome using Hisat2 v2.0.5. Gene expression was
quantiﬁed using featureCounts v1.5.0-p3, which counts the number of
reads assigned to each gene. The FPKM values for each gene were
calculated on the basis of the gene length and read counts. Sequenced
library read counts were adjusted using the edgeR program package
(version 3.22.5) with a single-scale normalized factor. Differential expres-
sion analysis between Cav-1 KO and WT tumors was performed using the
DESeq2 R package (1.20.0). DESeq2 provided statistical routines for
determining differential expression in digital gene expression data, and
the obtained P-values were adjusted using Benjamini and Hochberg’s
approach for controlling the false discovery rate. Gene length bias was
corrected during Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using the
clusterProﬁler R package. GO terms with corrected P-values less than 0.05
were considered signiﬁcantly enriched by differentially expressed genes.
The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was used
to identify high-level functions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
The statistical enrichment of DEGs in KEGG pathways was assessed using
the clusterProﬁler R package.
Human BC data correlation analysis
The correlation between signiﬁcant DEGs and Cav-1 was analyzed using
the BC Gene-Expression Miner v4.8 (bc-GenExMiner), a disease-associated
web portal that includes a BC DNA microarray, RNA sequencing, and
clinicopathological databases. In the present study, targeted gene
correlation analyses were performed on TNBC (IHC)/basal-like (PAM50)
samples, focusing on the relationship between Cav-1 and 21 genes (Itgα3,
Foxc2, Fermt1, Efnb2, Ptprm, Rhob, Card10, Ccbe1, Sox9, Cdh13, Plxnd1,
Met, Flt4, Epha2, Rhoa, Kdr, Emp2, Ephb4, Mmrn2, Hdac5, and Epb41l4b).
The gene expression correlations between Cav-1 and these 21 genes were
analyzed in a cohort of 4,421 TNBC patients, and correlation graphs were
generated using the same database.
Prediction of in silico interaction between Cav-1 and ITGα3
The proximity of Cav-1 and ITGα3 to the membrane prompted us to
investigate any potential interactions between these two proteins. The
structural coordinates for Cav-1 and ITGα3 in Mus musculus were obtained
using the AlphaFold deep-learning-based protein structure prediction
program
(https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/)
[35].

conﬁdence for 90% of the amino acids, except near the N-terminus.
Furthermore, due to the availability of ITGα3 crystal structures of ITG-3 in
RCSB-PDB, the structural coordinates for ITGα3 exhibited very high
conﬁdence for more than 95% of the residues, despite the large size of
the protein. The quality of the structural coordinates obtained using
AlphaFold was further assessed using PDBsum [36, 37]. Cav-1 structural
prediction showed that 100% of the residues were in feasible regions in
the most favorable or additional allowed regions, and 98% of the ITGα3

protein residues were predicted to be in the most favored or additional
allowed regions. Protein-protein interactions between Cav-1 and ITGα3
were predicted using the ZDOCK server (https://zdock.umassmed.edu/)
and visualized using PyMOL [38, 39]. The ZDOCK server employs an
algorithm to generate hard-docking results, also known as rigid-body
search, which identiﬁes potential interaction surfaces between proteins
based on the surface charge and structural compatibility. The results with
the highest predicted interaction values and feasibility were exported in a
suitable image format.
Coimmunoprecipitation
To validate the physical interactions between Cav-1 and ITGα3, as
predicted by in silico observations, a coimmunoprecipitation experiment
was conducted using a Pierce Coimmunoprecipitation Kit (Cat# 26149;
Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Approximately 3 × 106 4T1 WT cells were
seeded in T-75 ﬂasks and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2
incubator. The next day, the medium was replaced, and the cells were
allowed to grow for 24 h in an incubator. Cells were then lysed in IP lysis
buffer, and insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at
13,000×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The clear supernatant was carefully collected,
and protein estimation was performed using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay
Kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA), following the manufacturer’s protocol,
with some modiﬁcations [40]. For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of protein
per sample in a 200 μL volume was used. Pre-cleaning was performed
using a control agarose resin slurry. An equal volume of precleared protein
lysate was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube, and 2 μg of
Caveolin-1 antibody (Cat# 3238, Cell Signaling Technology) and normal
rabbit IgG (Cat# 2729, Cell Signaling Technology) were added, followed by
slow end-to-end mixing on a rotator at 4 °C overnight. The Amino Link Plus
coupling resin was equilibrated at room temperature and washed three
times in IP lysis buffer. The lysate (with antibody) was transferred to the
Amino Link with coupling beads and incubated for slow end-to-end mixing
on a rotator at 4 °C for 4 h. After incubation, the beads were separated by
centrifugation and washed thrice. Immunoblotting samples were prepared
by adding 1x loading dye to the beads and heating them at 95 °C for
6–8 min. The samples were probed with mouse anti-Cav-1 (Cat# sc-53564;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mouse anti-ITGα3 (Cat# sc-374242; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies.
Cav1/ITGα3 gene knockdown
A gene-silencing experiment was conducted in 4T1 cells to conﬁrm the
role of Cav1/ITGα3 in epithelial cell migration. Cav-1 (Cat# sc-29942),
integrin α3/ITGA3/CD49c (sc-63320), and scrambled control siRNA (sc-
37007) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Dallas, Texas,
USA). The TransIT-X2® Dynamic Delivery System (Cat# MIR 6004) (Mirus Bio
LLC) was used for siRNA transfection following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Brieﬂy, 0.15 × 106 4T1 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and
incubated overnight at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After 16–24 h, the siRNA
and TransIT-X2® Dynamic Delivery System complex was prepared in Opti-
MEM™reduced serum medium and incubated for 15–30 min. Following
complex formation, siRNA complex was added to the cells and incubated
for 48 h. After this period, 4T1 cells were synchronized in FBS-free media
for 24 h. After synchronization, a wound was scratched in each well using a
200 µL pipette tip. The complete medium was replaced with a fresh
medium, and images were captured at a magniﬁcation of 4x at 0, 24, and
48 h. These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed in the MDA-MB-231 human cell line
using human siRNA for Cav1 (Cat#sc-29241) and integrin α3/ITGA3/CD49c
(Cat#sc-63319) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc). Control siRNA-A (sc-37007)
was used as control. The wound healing area was determined using
ImageJ software. After 48 h, the cells were lysed, and immunoblotting was
performed to conﬁrm cell protein and gene silencing.
RESULTS
Generation and characterization of Cav-1 knockout 4T1
4T1 is a triple-negative murine mammary BC cell line that
emulates the characteristics of advanced stage IV cancer in
humans. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate Cav-1 knockout
4T1 cells, and several colonies were puriﬁed and conﬁrmed by
immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). Cav-1 protein expression was undetect-
able by immunoblotting, which was further conﬁrmed by the
insertion of GFP into Cav-1 KO cells. Furthermore, Cav-1 KO did
not have signiﬁcant effects on cell growth (Fig. 1B), the cell cycle
(Fig. 1C), or mitochondrial stress compared to WT 4T1 cells
(Fig. 1D). However, SEM showed that the membrane phenotype of
Cav-1 KO cells differed from that of WT 4T1 cells (Fig. 1E), which

may be associated with their tumorigenic and metastatic potential
[41]. Furthermore, TEM revealed fewer vacuoles in Cav-1 KO cells
than in the control (Fig. 1F). We also observed more extracellular
vesicles protruding from WT cells than from Cav-1 KO 4T1 cells.
This observation was further conﬁrmed by immunoblotting for the
exosome markers Annexin V and Alix (Fig. 1G), and densitometric
quantiﬁcation was performed (Fig. 1H). In vitro scratch cell
migration assays demonstrated signiﬁcantly higher migration
and wound closure in WT 4T1 cells at 24 h, which was not
observed in Cav-1 KO 4T1 cells (Fig. 1I). Furthermore, epithelial cell
migration and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation are vital
for metastasis [42, 43]. The MMP ﬂuorometric assay revealed
higher secretion of MMP in WT cells than in Cav-1 KO-conditioned
medium (Fig. 1J). These characteristics of Cav-1 KO cells suggest
that Cav-1 plays a role in promoting metastasis.
Cav-1 knockout affects lung metastasis
Equal numbers of WT and Cav-1 KO 4T1 cells were injected into
the mammary fat pads of female BALB/c mice, and tumor growth
was observed over time. Five animals per group were used to
study metastases from the primary tumor site. One week after
injection (week 1), small tumors were detected in mice injected
with WT 4T1 (controls), which were even smaller in mice injected
with Cav-1 KO cells (Fig. 2A). To understand the molecular
mechanisms and kinetics of tumor growth, the animals were
sacriﬁced at the end of weeks 2, 3, and 4. Unlike our observations
from week 1, the size of the tumors harvested from both control
and Cav-1 KO 4T1 cell-injected mice did not show signiﬁcant
differences at the end of weeks 2 and 3. The tumor areas and
masses in both groups were comparable (Fig. 2B, C). At the end of
week 4, clear metastatic tumor lesions were visible in the lungs of
the WT control group but not in the Cav-1 KO group (Fig. 2D).
Additionally, Dr. M. E. White, a pathologist, evaluated the H&E-
stained lungs of the animals to detect lung metastases. At the end
of week 2, multiple metastatic foci (0–7 per lobe) were observed in
the lungs of the control animals. Several of these metastatic foci
were 50–108 μm in size, with the widest ranging from 57 to
150 μm. Indistinct lesions, including lymphocytic inﬂammation,
hemorrhage, and edema, were also identiﬁed in the lungs of WT
and Cav-1 KO mice. At the end of week 3, more prominent
metastatic foci (1–5 per lobe) were detected, ranging from 225 μm
to 728 μm in controls which was further supported by signiﬁcantly
high number of 4T1 cells in the lungs of WT as compared to Cav-1
KO, 4T1 injected mice (Supplementary Fig. 3). At the end of week
4, the number of metastatic foci was 2–10 per lobe, ranging from
1.12 mm to 2.79 mm in controls. However, no metastatic foci were
observed in Cav-1 KO 4T1 injected mice at the end of weeks 2, 3,
and 4 (Fig. 2E). Taken together, our data suggest that the absence
of Cav-1 expression limits the metastatic potential of tumors from
the primary mammary site to the lungs.
Cav-1 deﬁciency affected the expression of genes involved in
epithelial cell migration
IHC data revealed reduced lung metastasis in mice injected with
Cav-1 KO cells compared to WT controls. To better understand
the molecular mechanisms and gene expression patterns, we
performed mRNA sequencing of primary tumors obtained from
WT control and Cav-1 KO 4T1 injected mice. Gene expression
levels were estimated using quality sequence counts assigned to
the genome. FPKM (expected number of fragments per kilogram
of transcript sequence per million base pairs sequenced)
considers both sequencing depth and gene length when
counting fragments, making it the most widely used method
for gene expression analysis. Following gene expression analysis,

the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between samples was found
to be very close to 1, conﬁrming the reliability of the data
(Supplementary Fig. 1A). Principal component analysis (PCA) of
FPKM obtained from the Cav-1 KO and WT 4T1 groups
demonstrated differences between groups and duplication of
intragroup samples, indicating that the Cav-1 KO and WT groups
were separated; however, samples from the same groups
clustered together (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Once gene expres-
sion was quantiﬁed, statistical analysis was performed using
DESeq at a threshold DESeq2 P-value of ≤0.05. The number of
DEGs among all groups and pairs is shown in a Venn diagram
(Supplementary Fig. 2A, B). Statistical data analysis revealed
5118 DEG between Cav-1 KO and WT mice at the end of week 2,
2496 of which were upregulated and 2622 were downregulated.
Similarly, at the end of week 3, 4145 genes were differentially
expressed, with 2101 up-regulated and 2044 down-regulated.
We also identiﬁed DEGs within the same group (WT vs. WT and
Cav1 KO vs. Cav1 KO) at different time points (Fig. 3B). Cluster
analysis was performed using hierarchical main grouping of
different gene sets, in which similar expression patterns could
be grouped together. Cluster analysis showed that the DEGs in
Cav-1 KO and WT 4T1 cells could be grouped into two clusters
(Fig. 3A). Enrichment analysis was conducted to determine the
biological signiﬁcance of DEGs. ClusterProﬁler [44] software was
used for enrichment analysis. GO term enrichment showed that
DEGs (padj < 0.05) were involved in the major categories of
cellular components, molecular functions, and biological pro-
cesses (Fig. 3C).
To understand the functions, biological pathways, and disease
information associated with the DEG, KEGG enrichment analysis
was performed using padj < 0.05, and 20 KEGG pathways were
selected for display. The primary focus of this study was to
understand the role of Cav-1 in lung metastasis by identifying 91
genes at week 2 and 89 genes at week 3 that were signiﬁcantly
differentially expressed between Cav-1 KO vs. WT 4T1 injected
tumors known to be involved in epithelial cell migration. Of these,
53 of 91 genes at week 2 and 49 of 89 genes at week 3 were
signiﬁcantly different after P-value adjustment (Fig. 4A).

To
elucidate
the
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
the
observed lung metastasis from the primary tumor in WT mice as
compared to Cav-1 KO at weeks 2 and 3, as revealed by our IHC
data, we conducted differential gene expression analysis in the
primary tumor. We found 31 genes in week 2 and 28 in week 3
that were signiﬁcantly differentially expressed at individual time
points (Fig. 4B), while 21 genes were differentially expressed at
both time points at week 2 and week 3 (Fig. 5A), which are
graphically represented in Fig. 5B (Week-2) and 5C (Week-3).
Correlation data analysis of 4421 human TNBC patients (BC
gene expression miner database) revealed a signiﬁcant correlation
between Cav-1 and many of the 21 commonly expressed genes,
including ITGα3, CDH13, MMRN2, KDR, and PECAM1 (Fig. 6A, B).
The reduced expression of ITGα3 in Cav-1 KO 4T1-induced tumors
and its localization to the plasma membrane led us to speculate

that ITGα3 plays an essential role in Cav-1-mediated lung
metastasis. To support the mRNA data, we performed immuno-
blotting of ITGα3, which showed signiﬁcantly reduced expression
in Cav-1 KO tumors compared to WT (Fig. 6C). Further computa-
tional
in
silico
modeling
and
coimmunoprecipitation
were
performed to understand the possible interactions between Cav-
1 and ITGα3.
In
silico
modeling
and
coimmunoprecipitation
analysis
revealed a possible interaction between Cav-1 and ITGα3, which
are both membrane proteins that play crucial roles in cancer
progression. AlphaFold was used to predict the structures of
Cav-1 and ITGα3. The ZDOCK server was used to examine their
interaction with AutoDock VINA in the background (Fig. 7A). We
discovered an interaction between Cav-1 and ITGα3 via a
hydrophobic patch on Cav-1. Coimmunoprecipitation experi-
ments using an anti-Cav-1 antibody supported the coupling
results, showing ITGα3 co-precipitation with Cav-1, demonstrat-
ing the physical interaction between Cav-1 and ITGα3 (Fig. 7B).
Furthermore, the roles of ITGα3 and Cav-1 in cell migration and
invasion were veriﬁed using a cell migration assay (wound
healing assay) after knocking down ITGα3 and Cav-1 expression
using siRNA.
Knocking down Cav-1 and ITGα3 inhibits the migration of 4T1
and MDA-MB-231 cells
Knockdown of Cav-1 and ITGα3 expression hampers migration of
4T1 cells. The cell migration assay is a standard method used to
study the in vitro migration and invasion capabilities [45]. Cav-1
silencing inhibited cell migration, as evidenced by signiﬁcantly
fewer wound closures than in WT 4T1 cells 24 h after wound
creation (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, after 48 h, the wound gap was
completely sealed in the culture plate containing WT 4T1 cells, but
scratches were still visible in Cav-1 silenced 4T1 cells. However,
compared to Cav-1 KO 4T1 cells, Cav-1 silenced cells exhibited
wound healing capability (Fig. 7C), potentially due to a smaller
reduction in Cav-1 expression resulting from its silencing (knock-
down) rather than a knockout, which eliminated Cav-1 expression.
Similarly,
ITGα3
knockdown
resulted
in
reduced
migratory
potential compared to that of WT 4T1 cells (Fig. 7C). These
ﬁndings were further conﬁrmed in human MDA-MB-231 Cells
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Like Cav-1 knockdown, ITGα3 knockdown
also resulted in reduced migratory potential compared to WT
4T1 cells, demonstrating the potential role of Cav-1 interaction
with ITG-a3 in lung metastasis.
DISCUSSION
The role of Cav-1 in the metastasis to the lungs remains unclear,
despite links between Cav-1 dysregulation, poor prognosis, and
increased metastatic potential in BC. This study elucidated several
key aspects of the BC metastatic cascade, focusing on Cav-1-
mediated BC metastasis to the lungs. Cav-1 KO 4T1 cells and a
syngeneic mouse model of advanced BC were used to study Cav-1
function in BC progression and metastasis in a physiologically
relevant system. The effects of Cav-1 deﬁciency on cellular
behaviors, including migration, wound closure, MMP secretion,
and gene expression, were also examined.
Our results provide the ﬁrst in vivo evidence that Cav-1 KO
reduces the migratory abilities of BC cells. Importantly, Cav-1
deﬁciency did not signiﬁcantly affect primary tumor growth
in vivo but markedly decreased lung metastasis in mice bearing
Cav-1 KO 4T1 cells compared to WT 4T1 cells. Lung pathology
analysis showed the progression of lung metastasis over time in
WT mice, with metastatic foci present at weeks 2 and 3, whereas
no foci were detected in mice with Cav-1 KO cells which was
further conﬁrmed by growing single-cell suspension of the lungs
in 6GT supplemented complete growth media at the end of week-
3. Visible lung lesions were observed at week 4 in WT mice but not
in
KO
mice.
Transmission
electron
microscopy
revealed
a
signiﬁcant reduction in vesicle budding in Cav-1 KO 4T1 murine
BC cells compared to WT controls. Since cav-1 is an essential
structural component of caveolae plasma membrane invagina-
tions involved in endocytosis and transcytosis [46, 47]. These
results suggest that Cav-1 regulates vesicular transport in BC cells,
and through modulation of vesicle formation, it enhances the
metastatic potential of BC cells.
Previous studies have implicated Cav-1 and lipid rafts in cancer
metastasis by promoting cellular behaviors involved in metastatic
cascades. Yamaguchi et al. showed that decreasing Cav-1
expression or disrupting lipid rafts attenuated MMP expression
and
invadopodia
formation
in
cultured
cancer
cells
[48].
Furthermore, Gupta et al. demonstrated that targeted disruption
of lipid rafts/Cav-1 or the mevalonic acid pathway reduced the
invasiveness and metastatic potential of pancreatic cancer cells

[49]. Cav-1 overexpression has also been associated with increased
MMP production and invasiveness in hepatocellular and ovarian
carcinoma models [50, 51]. Our current ﬁndings provide further
validation of the functional importance of Cav-1 and lipid rafts in
cancer metastasis. Speciﬁcally, we revealed that genetic ablation
of Cav-1 expression in murine 4T1 BC cells induced changes in cell
membrane phenotypes and reduced extracellular vesicle secre-
tion. Critically, Cav-1 knockdown also suppressed cell migration
via wound closure, in vitro. Overall, the results of our study and
those of previous studies established that Cav-1 and lipid rafts
enable metastatic cascades.
It is important to highlight the contrasting ﬁndings between our
study, which shows that Cav-1 knockout reduces lung metastasis
in breast cancer models, and the ﬁndings of Sloan et al. [28], which
links Cav-1 much lower expression with increased metastasis,
highlighting Cav-1’s context-dependent role in cancer. Differences
in experimental approaches, cell lines, and speciﬁc contexts may
contribute to the contradictory results regarding the role of Cav-1
in breast cancer metastasis.
To further understand the molecular mechanisms underlying
Cav-1’s premetastatic effects, we performed transcriptomic proﬁl-
ing of tumors from Cav-1 KO and wild-type mice. It is well
established that heritable morphological traits associated with
genomic and transcriptomic phenotypes correlate with distinct
tumorigenic and metastatic potential in vivo [41]. Our transcrip-
tomic analysis of BC tumors in Cav-1 KO and WT 4T1 cell-
conditioned mice revealed signiﬁcant alterations in the expression
of genes involved in epithelial cell migration, suggesting a
possible mechanism by which Cav-1 modulates the metastatic
potential. Our analysis also revealed several DEGs between Cav-1
KO and WT 4T1 tumors. Overall, 5118 and 4145 genes were
differentially expressed between Cav-1 KO and WT mice at the
end of weeks 2 and 3, respectively. Using GO term enrichment
analysis, we identiﬁed a subset of 21 genes that consistently
showed differential expression in lung metastasis at two different
time points. Correlation analysis revealed a signiﬁcant association
between Cav-1 and DEG, including CDH13, FLT4, KDR, MMRN2,
PECAM1, and ITGα3.
Our study also investigated the correlation between Cav-1
expression and patient outcomes, including mortality, in TNBC
patients. By employing data mining analysis of the human BC
gene expression miner database, we observed a signiﬁcant
association between Cav-1 expression and genes involved in cell
migration, including CDH13, KDR, MMRN2, and PECAM-1 [52, 53].
This ﬁnding substantiates the role of Cav-1 in regulating BC cell
migration. A notable observation from our mRNA data was the
elevated expression of VEGF-C/Flt-4 axis genes, such as VEGFR-2
(KDR) and PECAM-1, in Cav-1 knockout (KO) tumors. Intriguingly,
lung metastasis was reduced in Cav-1 KO tumors, suggesting that
Cav-1 may govern lung metastasis through alternative signaling
pathways. Notably, previous studies have associated CDH13 and
MMRN2 with cell invasion and proliferation inhibition [54–56].
Another critical ﬁnding of our study is the interaction between
Cav-1 and ITGα3, a membrane protein that plays a pivotal role in
cell adhesion and migration. ITGα3 has emerged as a promising
candidate for further investigation because of its signiﬁcant
correlation with Cav-1 expression in human TNBC samples and its
localization to the plasma membrane. In silico modeling and
coimmunoprecipitation experiments conﬁrmed this interaction,
and subsequent knockdown of ITGα3 expression resulted in
impaired migration and invasion of 4T1 cells, similar to the effects
observed in Cav-1 KO cells. Therefore, our results suggest that the
interaction between Cav-1 and ITGα3 is a key factor in promoting
BC metastasis. Supporting the role of ITGα3 in epithelial migration
and tumor growth, Kurozumi et al. demonstrated that ITGα3
targets tumor suppressor microRNAs such as miR-223, miR-124-3p
and the miR-199 family [57]. Restoring miR-223 expression or
knocking down ITGα3 and ITGβ1 signiﬁcantly prevented cancer
cell migration and invasion. Similarly, Idichi et al. showed that
ectopic expression of miR-124-3p or siRNA-mediated knockdown
of ITGα3 and ITGβ1 reduced the migration and invasion of PDAC
cells [58]. Moreover, ITGα3 expression is regulated by the miR-199
family in HNSCC cells, and the knockdown of ITGα3 inhibits the
migration and invasion of HNSCC cells. Notably, overexpression of
ITGα3 has been predicted to be associated with poor patient
survival [59].
Our study has several implications for understanding the
molecular mechanisms underlying BC metastasis and developing
novel therapeutic strategies. First, identifying Cav-1 as a critical
player in promoting metastasis highlights the potential of
targeting Cav-1 to prevent or reduce metastasis in BC patients
[60, 61]. Notably, several small-molecule inhibitors and mono-
clonal antibodies targeting Cav-1 have been developed and are
currently under investigation in preclinical and clinical studies
[62, 63]. Second, the discovery of a possible interaction between
Cav-1 and ITGα3 suggests that simultaneously targeting both
proteins could represent a more effective strategy for inhibiting
metastasis. Integrins have long been recognized to be essential for
cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. ITGα3, in particular, has
been implicated in promoting metastasis in various types of
cancers, including BC [32, 64]. Given the interaction observed
between Cav-1 and ITGα3 in our study, it is possible that a
combination of Cav-1- and ITGα3-targeted therapies could exert a
synergistic effect on inhibiting metastasis. However, further
studies are needed to investigate this possibility and optimize
therapeutic strategies targeting Cav-1 and ITGα3.
Although our study provides valuable insights, several limita-
tions remain that reveal avenues for additional research. Elucidat-
ing the precise molecular mechanisms governing Cav-1 and ITG-
α3 interactions represents a key challenge. Techniques such as
coimmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays can help
identify post-translational modiﬁcations or protein-binding part-
ners that regulate complex formation [65]. Additionally, Cav1
binding assays with ITG-α3 mutants would delineate key residues
involved. Mapping downstream signaling pathways using phos-
phoproteomics and genetic approaches is also warranted, given
the known effects of Cav-1 on MAPK, PI3K/AKT, Rho GTPases, and
transcriptional networks. Although we have conﬁrmed migration
assay invitro in human MDA-MB231 cells, a further detailed study
is warranted in different human cell lines to understand the
intricate cellular mechanism of Cav-1 and ITG-α3 in lung
metastasis in humans. Expanding into more clinically relevant
models, such as patient-derived xenografts or organoids that
capture inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity, will better
approximate the complexity of human BC. In addition, studies on
the potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties of Cav-1
and ITGα3 inhibitors will enable their clinical translation.
CONCLUSIONS
This study revealed the role of Cav-1 in BC metastasis, particularly
in lung metastasis, without affecting primary tumor growth.
Sequencing data from the primary tumor shows that knocking out
Cav-1 affects the expression of several epithelial migration genes,
which might contribute to lung metastasis. Reduced expression in
the
primary
tumor
and
interaction
between
Cav-1
and
ITGα3 suggest a mechanism for metastatic enhancement. These
ﬁndings offer new insights into the molecular dynamics of breast
cancer metastasis and underscore the potential of targeting Cav-1
and ITGα3 in therapeutic strategies.
Limitations and future direction
In this study, we used a 4T1/BALB/c syngeneic TNBC mouse
model, focusing on the association between Cav-1 and ITGα3.
Most of our ﬁndings are from 4T1 cells in the BALB/c syngeneic
breast cancer model. Our strategy involves utilizing the 4T1 TNBC

mouse cell line to induce tumor development in mice rather than
relying on a xenograft model. However, ongoing investigations in
our laboratory include the use of different TNBC human and mice
cell lines, including Cav-1 and ITGα3 knockout 4T1 cells, MDA-MB-
231, and other xenograft models to elucidate the intricate
mechanisms underlying the Cav-1/ITGα3 axis in the context of
lung metastasis.
