Osteopontin (OPN) is a matrix protein involved in tumour initiation and progression. In human me-
ningioma, OPN has been correlated with World Health Organization (WHO) grade, brain invasion and
recurrence. The aim of this study was to investigate OPN as a possible malignancy marker in canine
meningioma by correlating its expression to WHO grade and proliferative activity as measured by the Ki-
67 labelling index (LI). Thirty-ﬁve formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded canine meningioma samples were
classiﬁed according to the current human WHO classiﬁcation. Evaluation of OPN expression was per-
formed by immunohistochemical (IHC) labelling and calculation of the OPN intensity score (IS), OPN IHC
score and Allred score. The scores were compared with WHO grades, Ki-67 LI, location and invasiveness.
Nineteen meningiomas were graded as WHO grade I (54.3%), nine as grade II (25.7%) and seven as grade
III (20.0%). Twenty-six tumours were located intracranially, four were retrobulbar and ﬁve were spinal
meningiomas. In all specimens OPN expression was detected in moderate to high degrees. Neither the
OPN scores nor the Ki-67 LIs were correlated with WHO grades. However, the OPN IS and OPN IHC score
were signiﬁcantly higher in WHO grade I samples compared with grade II samples (P <0.05). The OPN IS
and OPN IHC score were signiﬁcantly lower in meningioma samples that invaded surrounding tissues
(P ¼ 0.01 and 0.019, respectively). The results indicate a generally high expression of OPN in canine
meningioma independent of WHO grade. Further research into the role of OPN as a possible therapeutic
target or predictor of recurrence is warranted.

1. Introduction
Canine meningiomas are extra-axial tumours that originate
from arachnoid cap cells of the dura within the cranial cavity and
vertebral canal. The meninges develop by contributions of the
mesoderm and neural crest, which may explain the diversity of
histopathological appearance of meningiomas. Due to their dual
provenance, arachnoid cells have the ability to undergo epithelial
and mesenchymal differentiation [1,2].
The estimated incidence of central nervous system tumours in
dogs is approximately 26 per 100,000 [3] with meningioma being
the most common primary intracranial neoplasia, accounting for
40.0e50.9% of canine intracranial tumours [4e6].
The latest World Health Organization (WHO) histological
classiﬁcation system of canine meningiomas was published in
1999 and categorizes them into two main groups: benign and
anaplastic tumours [7]. This classiﬁcation system has not been
updated since then. More recent studies rely on the human WHO
classiﬁcation system for categorization of canine meningiomas
[8e10]. Using the human classiﬁcation, approximately 47e63% of
canine intracranial meningiomas are benign (grade I), 23e45% are
atypical (grade II) and 1e9% are malignant (grade III) [11e14]. The
high incidence of higher-grade meningioma in dogs, compared
with human meningioma, makes this species especially inter-
esting for research into its malignant behaviour and recurrence
[15,16].

It is unclear if classifying canine meningioma according to the
human classiﬁcation is comparable when predicting clinical out-
comes. Therefore, additional parameters to assess malignancy are
warranted. Immunohistochemical (IHC) labelling is a valuable tool
for histopathological decision making. Ki-67 is an established
proliferation marker for various types of cancer and is commonly
used to estimate the malignancy of human meningiomas. Expres-
sion of Ki-67, a nuclear non-histone protein and proliferation
marker, correlates with WHO grade, brain invasion, recurrence and
poor outcome of human meningioma [17e19]. Data on Ki-67 in
canine meningioma are few and contradictory with some authors
having identiﬁed a correlation with grade, while others not ﬁnding
any association of Ki-67 expression and survival [20e25].
More recently, research has been directed to osteopontin (OPN),
an integrin-binding matrix protein, which is involved in many
processes. Apart from regulating physiological bone mineralization,
it is a proinﬂammatory cytokine and participates in neoplastic
processes. In cancer, it acts as a signalling agent and is involved in
apoptosis, proliferation, migration, adhesion, invasion, metastasis
and angiogenesis and, therefore, tumour progression [26,27]. In
meningioma, OPN has been related to the formation of psammoma
bodies, a typical feature of a common meningioma subtype [28].
OPN is also referred to as secreted phosphoprotein 1, as it can be
detected in blood plasma and cerebrospinal ﬂuid and may serve as
a marker for early cancer detection and monitoring [29]. Addi-
tionally, its role as a proinﬂammatory cytokine renders it a valuable
biomarker in inﬂammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis or
for use as a monitoring marker in Duchenne muscular dystrophy
[30e32].
Studies of human meningiomas found a high correlation be-
tween OPN score and Ki-67 labelling index (LI), as well as with
WHO grade and recurrence [33,34]. Additionally, higher OPN
expression was reported in meningiomas invading the brain and
bone [18,35]. Aside from its potential as a malignancy marker,
research is directed towards OPN as a therapeutic target. Strategies
include RNA silencing and blocking OPN activity by use of small-
molecule inhibitors or speciﬁc antibodies [36].
To the authors' knowledge, there are no published studies on
the role of OPN in canine meningioma. As the dog is a suitable
model for various types of neoplasia common in humans, there are
data on other neoplasms. Recent studies on canine osteosarcoma,
canine mammary tumours and thyroid neoplasia investigated OPN
as a possible malignancy marker and future therapeutic target
[37e39].
The aim of this study was to investigate OPN expression as a
possible malignancy marker in canine meningioma, with a special
focus on correlation with WHO grading and proliferation, as
measured by the Ki-67 LI. It was hypothesized that OPN measure-
ments would positively correlate with WHO grades, Ki-67 LI and
invasive growth.
2. Material and methods
The electronic database of the Institute of Pathology at the
University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Austria, was searched for
canine meningioma cases recorded from 2001 to 2018. Included
specimens were harvested via surgery, biopsy or post-mortem
examination. Samples of insufﬁcient quality or very small size
were excluded. Clinical data were retrieved from cases that had
been treated at the Clinic for Small Animals. Data collected included
age at presentation, sex, breed and bodyweight. Anatomical loca-
tion of the tumour was recorded as intracranial, spinal or
retrobulbar.
Formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded sections (FFPE), cut at 4 mm
and layered on glass slides, were used for haematoxylin and eosin
(HE) staining and IHC labelling. The HE-stained meningioma sam-
ples were reviewed by a board certiﬁed pathologist and classiﬁed
according to the WHO classiﬁcation for human meningioma [9].
Subtypes were set according to the dominant cell type and brain
invasion was recorded if discernible.
2.1. Immunohistochemical labelling
IHC labelling for Ki-67 was performed with a mouse monoclonal
anti-Ki-67 antibody (clone MIB-1; Dako, www.agilent.com). OPN
immunolabelling was performed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-OPN
antibody (PA5-16821; Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, www.
thermoﬁsher.com) with proven immunoreactivity for canine OPN
[40]. Ki-67 and OPN IHC runs were performed the same day to
guarantee similar immunolabelling conditions.
Sections (2.5 mm) were cut from each parafﬁn block and placed
on glass slides coated with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES;
Carl Roth GmbH þ Co. KG, www.carlroth.com). FFPE sections of
canine tonsil tissue served as positive control for Ki-67. FFPE sec-
tions of osteosarcoma were used as positive control for OPN.
Negative controls consisted of omission of primary antibody or
substitution of primary antibody by isotype-matched antibody
(rabbit IgG 3,900; Cell Signalling Technology, www.cellsignal.co.uk)
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Western blotting was carried out to verify
the speciﬁcity of the applied anti-OPN antibody for canine tissue.
For this purpose, canine kidney tissue was lysed, separated on a 10%
SDS PAGE gel and blotted on PVDF membrane (Supplementary
Fig. 2).
Endogenous
peroxidase
activity
was
blocked
with
0.6%
hydrogen peroxide in 80% methanol. The sections immunolabelled
for Ki-67 underwent an epitope retrieval step in 0.01M citrate
buffer at pH 6 in a steamer for 30 min. Sections were then incubated
with primary anti-Ki-67 (diluted 1:1000 in phosphate buffer) or
anti-OPN (diluted 1:300 in phosphate buffer) antibodies. As sec-
ondary antibody the respective BrightVision Poly-HRP Anti-Mouse
or Anti-Rabbit antibody (ImmunoLogic, www.immunologic.nl) was
used. Diaminobenzidine (DAB Quanto; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc)
was used as chromogen to visualize the signal. Slides were coun-
terstained with haematoxylin and mounted with dibutylphthalate
polystyrene xylene (DPX; SigmaeAldrich, www.sigmaaldrich.com).
2.2. Image analysis
For digitization, the Pannoramic Scan II slide scanner was used
(3DHISTECH Ltd, www.3dhistotech.com), equipped with a 20
objective. Image analysis was performed with self-made scripts, as
published (Ki67 [ [41]] and osteopontin [ [42]]), using FIJI (https://
imagej.net/software/ﬁji) [43] and machine learning algorithms
using the ilastik interactive learning and segmentation toolkit
(https://www.ilastik.org) [44]. Tumour tissue on the digitized
slides was outlined by a trained veterinarian (JJ), using a lasso cut-
out tool. This ensured that only areas of neoplastic tissue under-
went image analysis.
2.2.1. Ki-67
The scanned slides were digitally analysed for Ki-67 labelling
with FIJI. After separating the Ki-67-positive signal and Ki-67-
negative (counterstained) nuclei by colour deconvolution with
preset values for haematoxylin and DAB, the background was
automatically reduced with a rolling ball radius of 50 and contrast
was enhanced to obtain a normalized signal with similar maximum
intensities. Both positive and negative nuclei were segmented and
analysed,
excluding
very
small
(<13
mm2)
and
very
large
(>130 mm2) particles to remove staining-sprinkles and other arte-
facts. These ﬁltered particles were counted and set into relation,

42
and the Ki-67 LI was expressed as a percentage. After processing
the images with FIJI, the resulting labels were assessed visually as a
check on accuracy.
2.2.2. Osteopontin
For OPN analysis, a combination of machine learning algorithms
with the ilastik program and image analysis with the FIJI program
was used. First, ilastik was trained to differentiate between back-
ground around the tissue, background within the tissue (eg, vessels
and other spaces), OPN-positive areas and OPN-negative areas. The
data were then analysed using the FIJI program and the percentage
area of OPN labelling (percentage of immunopositive to immuno-
negative areas) calculated with exclusion of background area. To
assess cytoplasmic immunoreactivity, the intensity and the extent
of OPN labelling intensity were evaluated [33]. Two methods of
evaluation combining these values were used for deﬁnition of OPN
expression: the OPN IHC score and the Allred score.
2.2.2.1. OPN IHC score. OPN labelling intensity was scored visually
by one of the authors (JJ) as OPN intensity score (OPN IS) on a scale
of 0e3. Completely negative cases were scored 0. Scores 1, 2 and 3
were attributed to weak, moderate and strong labelling, respec-
tively (Supplementary Fig. 3). Additionally, the extent of labelling
was calculated, with the aid of ilastik, as the percentage of the
immunolabelled area for each case. For calculation of the OPN IHC
score, the OPN IS was multiplied by the percentage of immunola-
belled areas. This score had a possible range of 0e300.
2.2.2.2. OPN Allred score. The Allred evaluation system was used as
a second method for evaluation of immunoreactivity, as used in
previous
studies
for
assessment
of
OPN
immunolabelling
[33,45,46]. The slides were grouped according to their OPN posi-
tivity percentage, as determined by ilastik, into an OPN percentage
score (no staining ¼ 0, staining of 1% of cells ¼ 1, 1e10% ¼ 2,
11e33% ¼ 3, 34e67% ¼ 4, 68e100% ¼ 5). The Allred score was then
calculated as the sum of the OPN percentage score and the OPN IS.
Possible scores were 0 and 2e8.
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS software (version
27 for windows; IBM, www.ibm.com). Quantitative data were
expressed
as
means,
standard
deviation
and
ranges
(low-
estehighest). Correlation was tested via Pearson test. Statistical
comparison among subgroups was performed by use of ANOVA.
Statistical signiﬁcance was set as P ¼ <0.05.
3. Results
Of the 68 archival meningiomas, 35 were entered into the
study after the exclusion process. The cases and corresponding
data are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Twenty-six tumours were
located intracranially, four were retrobulbar and ﬁve were spinal
meningiomas.
Nineteen meningiomas were graded as WHO grade I (54.3%),
nine as grade II (25.7%) and seven as grade III (20.0%). Subtypes of
grade I tumours were microcystic (n ¼ 8), transitional (n ¼ 5),
psammomatous (n ¼ 3) and meningothelial (n ¼ 3). Grade II tu-
mours were either atypical (n ¼ 6) or chordoid (n ¼ 3). Grade III
tumours were rhabdoid (n ¼ 6) or papillary (n ¼ 1). All four ret-
robulbar meningiomas were grade III rhabdoid tumours. All the
spinal meningiomas were histopathological grades I and II.
Seventy-eight percent (7/9) of WHO grade II meningiomas had
evidence of brain invasion, while one of seven grade III tumours
had invaded the brain or surrounding tissues. However, for two of
the seven grade III samples, invasiveness could not be determined
due to inadequate sample size.
The female:male ratio of meningioma bearing patients was
48:52%. The average age at presentation was 10 years (range 4e16)
and the average bodyweight was 25 kg (range 2.6e46 kg). While
dogs with intracranial and spinal meningiomas presented with a
similar mean age of 10 years, dogs with retrobulbar meningiomas
presented at an average age of 7 years. Breeds represented in this
study were German Shepherd Dog (n ¼ 6), Golden Retriever (n ¼ 4),
Maltese (n ¼ 2) and one case each of Bavarian Mountain Hound,
Bearded Collie, Belgian Shepherd Dog, Boston Terrier, Boxer,
German
Wirehaired
Pointer,
Havanese,
Rottweiler,
Shetland
Sheepdog, Spaniel, Tervueren and Yorkshire Terrier. Eleven cases
originated from non-pedigree dogs.
Results of statistical analysis of OPN scores, immunolabelling
percentages and Ki-67 indices are summarized in Table 3. Repre-
sentative examples of OPN and Ki-67 expression in meningiomas of
different WHO grades are presented in Fig. 1.

percentage,
as
determined
by
the ilastik program, was 66.6 ± 26.5 (range 7.4e92.6). The

in
all
meningioma
samples,
while visually, two samples were graded as OPN IS negative due
to very weak immunolabelling (both WHO grade II). The mean
visual OPN IS was 1.9 ± 0.9 (range 0e3). The mean OPN IHC score
was 142 ± 93 (range 0e278) and the mean OPN Allred score was
4 ± 1 (range 2e5). The mean Ki-67 LI was 4.5 ± 2.9 (range
0.8e13.1).
Ki-67 expression ranged from 0 to 13.1 (mean 4.5) and varied
markedly in relation to tumour location without reaching statistical
signiﬁcance (Fig. 2). While intracranial meningioma expressed a
lower mean Ki-67 LI of 3.93 (±3.02), retrobulbar and spinal

meningioma expressed a higher mean of 6.23 (±2.27) and 5.88
(±2.28), respectively.
OPN scores and Ki-67 LIs did not consistently increase with
WHO grade. However, differences among groups were observed.
Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the OPN IHC score according to
meningioma grade. The OPN IHC score and OPN IS were signiﬁ-
cantly lower in WHO grade II meningiomas than in grade I me-
ningiomas
(P
¼
0.021
and
0.041,
respectively).
All
OPN
measurements had a similar tendency of equally high levels in
grades I and III meningiomas and lower levels in grade II. For OPN
labelling percentage and OPN Allred score, these trends did not
reach statistical signiﬁcance.
A similar trend could also be observed in the levels of Ki-67 LI in
relation to WHO grades (Fig. 4). While grade I meningiomas
expressed a mean Ki-67 LI of 4.6, grade II tumours expressed a
mean of 4.1 and grade III tumours a mean Ki-67 LI of 4.5. However,
these values were not signiﬁcantly different (P ¼ 0.931). Addi-
tionally, Ki-67 LIs and OPN scores were not signiﬁcantly correlated,
although they had similar tendencies in relation to WHO grading.
As depicted in Fig. 5, OPN IS and OPN IHC scores were negatively
correlated with brain invasion (P ¼ 0.01 and P ¼ 0.019, respec-
tively). Samples without brain invasion had signiﬁcantly higher
mean OPN ISs and OPN IHC scores of 2 and 155.5, respectively,
compared with mean scores of 1.1 and 70, respectively, for samples
that had evidence of invasion. Examples of OPN immunolabelling in
samples of invasive and non-invasive neoplasms are depicted in
Supplementary Fig. 4.
4. Discussion
OPN is a cytokine-like protein that exerts multiple functions in
tumour
initiation
and
progression.
To
our
knowledge,
OPN
expression has not been studied in canine meningioma. In this
study we aimed to investigate the expression of OPN in relation to
meningioma grading and Ki-67 labelling in order to assess the
value of OPN as a possible malignancy marker and therapeutic
target.
The ilastik program detected OPN labelling in all meningioma
samples, most of which had a high percentage area of labelled
tissue (mean 66.6 ± 26.5). Irrespective of tumour grade, some
samples reached values of 93% labelling. OPN expression in human

meningioma, as reported by Arik€ok et al [33]; was comparably high
with a mean of 35.6% in WHO grade I, 80.0% in grade II and 64.6% in
grade III tumours.
The generally high proportion of OPN expression, as detected in
this study, renders this protein an attractive target for possible
therapeutic approaches. Currently, human research is directed at
blocking OPN with its speciﬁc aptamer, a single stranded RNA
(ssRNA) that blocks surface binding of OPN to its receptor, CD44 and
integrin [47]. Other therapeutic approaches include OPN suppres-
sion via speciﬁc antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors or small
RNAs [48].
Ki-67 expression was detected in all samples in this study. The
increase in proliferation, as indicated by an elevated Ki-67 LI, is a
key event in the progression of tumours and can occur early during
tumour development. This may explain why some WHO grade I
tumours had a relatively high Ki-67 LI. The range of KI-67 LIs, from
0.8 to 13.1, is consistent with other studies of canine meningioma
[20,25]. Ki-67 labelling did not correlate signiﬁcantly with WHO
grading and there was a relatively small variation in mean Ki-67 LI
when comparing WHO grades, as grades I, II and III had means of
4.6, 4.1 and 4.5, respectively. Matiasek et al [25] found that the
majority of their canine meningioma samples expressed a Ki-67 LI
of <4, and there was no correlation between Ki-67 LI and survival.
In their samples, 9% were Ki-67 negative. Mandara et al [23] found
no Ki-67 labelling in 10/51 cases, even though four were malignant
meningiomas. This overall low correlation of Ki-67 expression in
canine meningioma with negative prognostic factors may be an
indicator that proliferation is not as important for canine menin-
gioma malignancy and recurrence as it is in human meningioma
[18,19]. However, as all the studies investigating Ki-67 expression in
canine meningioma have been conducted on relatively small case
numbers, larger and multicentre studies are warranted.

Neither the Ki-67 indices nor the OPN scores signiﬁcantly
increased with WHO grade. Consequently, we had to reject our
hypothesis. However, among tumour grades, marked but not sig-
niﬁcant differences in OPN expression were observed. While WHO
grade I and grade III tumours had comparably high mean OPN IHC
scores of 168 and 151, respectively, grade II tumours had lower
mean OPN IHC scores of 71. Between WHO grades I and II tumours,
this difference was signiﬁcant for OPN IHC score (P ¼ 0.041) and
OPN IS (P ¼ 0.021). Positive correlations between OPN immuno-
staining and WHO grades have been found in human meningioma
[26,33,34,49]. Additionally, two studies found signiﬁcantly higher
OPN IHC scores in recurring meningioma compared with non-
recurring meningioma [33,34]. A possible explanation for the
differing results between our study and the human studies is that
OPN may in fact be differently expressed in canine meningioma.
Another possibility is that the WHO grades in this study, as deter-
mined with the aid of the 2016 human WHO classiﬁcation, cannot
be entirely applied to canine meningioma.
The human WHO classiﬁcation system for central nervous sys-
tem tumours released in 2016 made only one, but major, change to
the former guidelines. This was to automatically grade invasive
meningiomas as grade II tumours, even though they might other-
wise exhibit benign features. In this study, 19 tumours were grade I
(54.2 %), nine were grade II (25.7 %) and seven were grade III (20.0
%). This allocation of cases among WHO grades concurs with pre-
vious studies on canine meningioma [12e14]. Aggressive behaviour
and recurrence of meningiomas are more commonly observed in
dogs than in humans [12,14], which is reﬂected in the distribution
of human meningiomas, in which 80% are grade I tumours, 10e15%
are grade II and 2e5% are grade III [50].
Although most human meningiomas are considered benign, the
unpredictable behaviours of malignant variants result in ongoing
efforts to improve the WHO grading scheme. The demand to
include other than solely histopathological criteria in the decision-
making process is increasing. Many human institutions take IHC
labelling (eg, for Ki-67) into consideration when predicting future
meningioma behaviour and likelihood of recurrence [15]. Recently,
a new edition of the WHO classiﬁcation for tumours of the central
nervous system has been released. Regarding meningioma, no
changes at the histopathological level have been made, but
morphological subtypes are no longer strictly linked to a speciﬁc
WHO class. Hence, the advice is to give more importance to criteria
of aggressiveness than to cell morphology. A major change in the
new WHO classiﬁcation edition is the addition of acknowledged
biomarkers and methylome proﬁling for decision making in difﬁ-
cult cases [10].
In our data, the OPN IS and OPN IHC score were negatively
correlated with brain invasion (P ¼ 0.01 and P ¼ 0.019, respec-
tively). This contrasts with studies on humans, which found a
positive correlation between OPN expression and tumour inva-
siveness [35,49]. Seven out of nine WHO grade II meningiomas had
histopathological evidence of tissue invasion, while only one in
seven WHO grade III tumours was invasive. The negative correla-
tion of invasive growth with OPN expression might be an expla-
nation as to why OPN IHC scores were signiﬁcantly lower in WHO
grade II meningiomas. Based on the results in this study, OPN may
not be critically involved in facilitating tissue invasion in canine
meningioma, or tumours containing higher levels of OPN may even
be less likely to become invasive. However, the generally high levels
of OPN expression indicate that it has an important role in the
development of this tumour.
There are no reports on OPN expression in canine meningioma
and only a few on other canine neoplasms. Guim et al [37] reported
OPN immunolabelling in canine osteosarcoma and found mild to
marked intensities but no correlation with survival. However, they
observed a tendency to increased OPN expression in higher tumour
grades. Klopﬂeisch et al [38] investigated OPN mRNA expression in
canine mammary tumours. They reported increased expression in
carcinomas compared with adenomas, but statistical signiﬁcance
was not reached. These results indicate a relationship between OPN
expression and malignancy, but a concrete inﬂuence on canine
tumours has yet to be determined.
The relatively high proportion of WHO grade III meningiomas in
the present series can partly be attributed to the high proportion of
retrobulbar meningiomas in our study population. All four speci-
mens originating from the orbital region in this study were clas-
siﬁed as rhabdoid meningiomas. This is an uncommon tumour
variant at the intracranial location, histologically deﬁned by plump
rhabdoid cells with open chromatin and other features of malig-
nancy [8]. Canine meningiomas with rhabdoid features have rarely
been described [51,52]. Interestingly, the most common histo-
pathological types of retrobulbar meningioma identiﬁed in other
studies were meningothelial, followed by ﬁbrous and transitional.
Larger case series frequently included areas of myxomatous, carti-
laginous or osseous metaplasia [53e55]. Based on these ﬁndings,
Montoliou et al [55] regarded canine orbital meningioma as a

grade II meningiomas compared with WHO grades I and III meningiomas, but not
statistically signiﬁcant.

totally separate meningioma entity. Mauldin et al [53] mentioned a
recurrence in six of 22 canine retrobulbar meningiomas, which may
indicate a more aggressive behaviour at this location. Studies of
retrobulbar meningiomas in dogs utilized the domestic animal
classiﬁcation scheme, for which the rhabdoid type is not deﬁned. It
is therefore unknown if certain samples in these studies would
have been categorized as rhabdoid tumours had they been classi-
ﬁed according to the human classiﬁcation scheme.
All spinal meningioma in our investigation were histopatho-
logical grade I or II. This is in accordance with previous studies,
although reports on spinal meningioma are scarce [56,57]. Petersen
et al [57] did not have any grade III spinal meningiomas in their
study population of 34 dogs and neither did Jose-Lopez et al [58]
when investigating eight cases. In the study by Lacassange et al
[56], survival time for post-resection meningiomas ranged from 66
to 881 days (2.2e29.0 months) with a median survival time of 306
days (10.1 months). Post-surgery survival times for spinal menin-
giomas in the study by Petersen et al [57] ranged from 4 to 47
months, which is within the range of post-surgical survival times of
1.5e3 years for intracranial meningioma and does not indicate a
more benign behaviour for spinal tumours in the context of the
tendency of a lower tumour grade. However, it must be considered
that the ability of nervous system tissue to compensate for tumour
growth in the vertebral canal is considerably more limited than in
the calvarium, and clinical deterioration must be expected at an
earlier stage [13]. Mandara et al [24] found that spinal meningiomas
had much higher Ki-67 expression compared with intracranial
meningiomas, but investigated only two spinal specimens, one of
which was malignant according to the canine WHO classiﬁcation
system. Nevertheless, this ﬁnding is supported by our data, as a
higher Ki-67 LI is expressed in spinal and retrobulbar meningiomas
compared with the intracranial type.
One limitation of this study is the retrospective collection of
data, which does not allow for reasonable evaluation of clinical
outcome. Secondly, the limited case numbers might be one reason
why some results were not statistically signiﬁcant. The study
population, however, was similar to those used in previous canine
meningioma studies. Mean age and bodyweight, male to female
ratio and predominantly dolichocephalic breeds were similar to
those of other studies [6,13].
As the samples were collected over 17 years, differences in
sample preparation and storage may have inﬂuenced our results.
Due to the retrospective nature of the study, the duration of
formalin ﬁxation before embedding in parafﬁn was not standard-
ized. Therefore, we cannot verify if this aspect has inﬂuenced our
IHC results. However, as no statistical correlation between sample
age and immunolabelling percentage or intensity was found, there
appears to be no relevant inﬂuence of sample age on IHC labelling
afﬁnity.
Another limiting factor of the study may be the availability of
canine-speciﬁc anti-OPN antibodies. The antibodies used in this
study have been used previously in canine studies and were
robustly tested with appropriate controls to ensure binding speci-
ﬁcity [40]. However, inﬂuences of sample processing or storage
time on the immunolabelling cannot be excluded. The MIB-1
antibody used for Ki-67 immunolabelling has long been estab-
lished for application to FFPE tissues [59,60]. Yet another limitation
may be the use of a human grading scheme for canine meningioma,
although this has commonly been applied in recent studies, as the
canine grading scheme has not been updated since 1999 [7,11].
5. Conclusion
Firstly, although OPN and Ki-67 LI immunolabelling did not
correlate with WHO grades in our study population, generally high
OPN expression was found, indicating that OPN may be a valuable
therapeutic target in canine meningioma. Secondly, OPN may be
used as a post-surgical predictor of recurrence, as a negative cor-
relation of OPN labelling with tissue invasion was found in this
population. However, prospective studies with larger case numbers
are warranted to establish the role of OPN in canine meningioma.
