1. Introduction
In cellular biology, cysteine cathepsins are enigmatic gate-
keepers that orchestrate a symphony of proteolytic events crucial
for cellular homeostasis, immune responses, and myriad physio-
logical processes. The narrative of cysteine cathepsins dates back to
the ﬁrst half of the 20th century [1], with pioneering efforts paving
the
way
for
understanding
these
proteolytic
enzymes.
The
groundbreaking discovery of papain, an enzyme extracted from
papayas, marked the advent of cysteine protease research. This
seminal ﬁnding, coupled with subsequent lysosomal enzyme-
related investigations [2,3], laid the groundwork for the recogni-
tion of cysteine cathepsins as integral components of cellular
degradation and turnover [4e6]. The realisation that they play
pivotal roles in the immune response, apoptosis, and tissue
remodelling unfolded gradually, whereas their involvement in
health and disease became increasingly apparent, sparking a surge
of research interest [6].
1.1. Cysteine cathepsins overview
According to the MEROPS database, bioinformatic analysis [7]
conﬁrmed the existence of 11 human cysteine cathepsins at the
sequence level: cathepsins B, C (or J), F, H, K (or O2), L, O, S, V (or L2),
W, and X (Z or P) [8]. They constitute the largest family of ca-
thepsins within the C1a family of the CA clan and are characterised
by a distinctive papain-like fold. They comprise the left and right
domains harbouring a cysteine-histidine catalytic dyad positioned
in the middle. The active protease features a catalytic Cys-His thi-
olate-imidazolium ion pair (Cys25-His159, papain numbering)
located on opposite sides of the active site cleft [9], resembling a
molecular scissor that facilitates substrate recognition and cleav-
age. Cysteine cathepsins typically exist as monomeric entities
within the mass range of 20e35 kDa, depending on post-
translational modiﬁcations. An exception to this monomeric
pattern is tetrameric cathepsin C, which has a molecular weight of
approximately 200 kDa [6].
Cathepsins B, C, F, H, L, O, and X are ubiquitously expressed in a
spectrum of human tissues and cells, indicating their widespread
presence and involvement in fundamental physiological processes.
In contrast, cathepsins K, S, V, and W exhibit a more deﬁned
localisation, aligning with their speciﬁc functions and implying a
more specialised role within distinct cellular compartments or
processes (Table 1) [6,10].
Most cysteine cathepsins exhibit endopeptidase activity by
which they cleave peptide bonds within the interior of a poly-
peptide chain. Cathepsins B and H possess molecular features that
enable them to act as endo- and exopeptidases, whereas cathepsins
C and X function strictly as exopeptidases. More precisely,
cathepsin C is an aminodipeptidase and cathepsin X is a carbox-
ymonopeptidase [6].
Highly
efﬁcient
proteolytic
cysteine
cathepsins
generally
possess broad substrate speciﬁcity for the efﬁcient degradation of a
wide range of proteins. This allows them to function in several
cellular processes, such as protein turnover and degradation, anti-
gen processing and presentation, and cellular signalling. As sup-
ported by several studies, multiple cathepsins share common
cleavage sites on their protein substrates. However, there are cases
reported where certain substrates (collagen, osteocalcin, cytokines,
and chemokines) are selectively targeted by only a subset of ca-
thepsins [6,11e13]. The observed parallels in substrate preferences
across cathepsins contribute to the perception of moderate speci-
ﬁcity within this enzyme family. However, it is essential to
acknowledge the diversity within the cathepsin family, as indi-
vidual members may demonstrate distinctive substrate prefer-
ences. The substrate binding site known as S2 is arguably the most
accurately characterised among its counterparts and uniquely
qualiﬁes as a ‘pocket.’ In conjunction with the S1 and S10 sites, the
S2 constitutes the Substrate Recognition Site (SRS). In terms of
substrate speciﬁcity, most cysteine cathepsins exhibit a strong
preference for small hydrophobic (Ala, Leu, Val and Ile) and aro-
matic amino acid residues (Phe and Tyr) at the P2 position. How-
ever,
there
are
some
differences
observed
among
different
cathepsins concerning P2 position speciﬁcities. For instance,
cathepsin K displays a unique tolerance for proline in the P2 posi-
tion, which is pivotal for its collagenolytic activity. Our previous
study revealed that cathepsin L exhibits a higher preference for
aromatic residues (Tyr and Phe) at the P2 position, whereas
cathepsin S exhibits a higher preference for lysine. Furthermore,
cathepsin B, which features a glutamic acid residue at position 245
(Glu245), displays a high speciﬁcity for arginine at the P2 position
[6,9,14e16].
1.2. Activation, regulation, and physiological role of cysteine
cathepsins
To avoid premature activation and potential cellular damage,
cysteine cathepsins are initially synthesised as inactive zymogens
or preprocathepsins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These zy-
mogens comprise a signal peptide, propeptide, and catalytic
domain. The N-terminal signal peptide of 20e25 amino acids
guides zymogens to the ER lumen, where the glycosylation with
mannose occurs after signal peptide removal. Following mannose
residue phosphorylation, procathepsins are directed to the trans-
Golgi network by mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptors and are
subsequently transported to lysosomes [17]. Within lysosomes, at
acidic pH, the ultimate activation of procathepsins occurs through
proteolytic cleavage of their N-terminal propeptides, leading to the
formation of mature and active cysteine cathepsins. This activation
occurs autocatalytically as a combination of unimolecular and
bimolecular processes [18,19].
Following the activation, the enzymatic activity of cysteine ca-
thepsins is meticulously regulated through multiple mechanisms
including pH, compartmentalization, and endogenous protein
inhibitors.
Cysteine cathepsins, predominantly found within the endo-
lysosomal system, display optimal activity in slightly acidic,
reducing environments, with an optimal pH range of 4.5e6.5 [6].
Most cysteine cathepsins function optimally under these condi-
tions and are less stable at neutral pH [20,21]. It was observed that
some cysteine cathepsin members exhibit additional catalytic ac-
tivity at physiological pH and redox conditions although these are
not favorable for their optimal activity. These properties of cysteine
cathepsins suggest, that they might have alternative subcellular

locations, outside of the endo-lysosomal system [4,22]. To improve
cysteine cathepsin activity under unfavourable conditions, re-
searchers use various polysaccharides [23] or substrates [20].
Various polysaccharides speciﬁcally modulate the activity of
cysteine cathepsins. For example, the collagenolytic activity of
cathepsin K is augmented by chondroitin-4 sulphate, chondroitin-6
sulphate and keratan sulphate, whereas it is inhibited by dermatan
sulphate, heparan sulphate, and heparin. Interestingly, the colla-
genolytic activity of cathepsins S and L is reduced by chondroitin-4
sulphate [24e26], although the latter's effect may not be signiﬁcant
in vivo. Moreover, chondroitin sulphate inhibits the elastolytic ac-
tivity of cathepsins V and K, but not that of cathepsin S [27].
Furthermore, the autocatalytic activation of cathepsins B, L, and S
may occur even at neutral pH and is facilitated by several glycos-
aminoglycans and negatively charged surfaces [28e31].
Cysteine cathepsin's retained proteolytic activity outside the
optimal pH range is associated with re-localisation to other com-
partments, such as the nucleus [32], cytosol [33] and extracellular
compartment [34,35], thereby contributing to the expanding
repertoire of cellular regions where these proteases may exert their
inﬂuence [36].
The most simplistic mechanism of their translocation into other
cellular regions is by leaking outside of lysosomes or by lysosomal
membrane permeabilization (LMP), induced by a variety of stimuli
including oxidative stress and lysosomotropic agents. The reason
for this localisation can be found in their escape from standard
trafficking routes into membranous intracellular vesicles or their
leakage from these organelles. Two other escape routes are mRNA
transcript variants, generated through the utilization of alternative
promoters and/or alternative splicing translation that utilizes
downstream in-frame start codons and secondly a phenomenon
known as leaky scanning [37]. In these neutral-pH-compartments,
cysteine cathepsins preserve their activity by binding to charged
molecules or surfaces, such as glycosaminoglycans and even DNA,
as well as by acidiﬁcation [38].
An additional tier of regulatory mechanisms governing cysteine
cathepsin activity involves the inﬂuence of endogenous inhibitors,
including cystatins, steﬁns, kininogens, thyropins, and serpins. In-
hibitors can be categorised into two groups: emergency and regu-
latory. Emergency inhibitors such as cystatins are typically located
in cellular compartments separate from the enzyme. They swiftly
trap proteases to form stable complexes that prevent undesired
activity. By contrast, regulatory inhibitors modulate protease ac-
tivity under normal physiological conditions and are often found in
close proximity to their targets [39,40]. Among the extensively
studied inhibitors are cystatins [family I25], which are further
classiﬁed into the steﬁn [I25A] cystatin [I25B] and kininogen [I25C]
subfamilies [8]. These inhibitors are characterised as competitive,
reversible, and tight-binding and display the ability to differentiate
between endo- and exopeptidases [6,40].
The predominant localisation of cysteine cathepsins in endoly-
sosomal compartments aligns well with their recognised physio-
logical roles in intracellular proteolysis, which is crucial for
maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating cellular differen-
tiation [41,42]. Although cathepsins generally degrade all proteins
non-speciﬁcally during autophagy following the merging of lyso-
somes and autophagosomes, they also have more speciﬁc regula-
tory roles. One such example is cathepsin B, which cleaves the
MCOLN1/TRPML1 calcium channel in the lysosomes during auto-
phagy. This cleavage leads to the suppression of transcription factor
EB (TFEB), the main transcription factor for cysteine cathepsins,
thereby reducing the expression of lysosomal and autophagy-
related proteins and serving as a feedback regulatory loop [43e45].
In addition, cysteine cathepsins play pivotal roles in the immune
response, antigen processing and presentation, the processing and
activation of various proteins and hormones, lysosomal death
pathway,
apoptosis,
autophagy,
ageing
and
other
processes
[12,42,46]. Their roles in both the innate and adaptive immune
responses are especially important. In the context of innate im-
munity, lysosomal cathepsins have been demonstrated to cleave
the ectodomains of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), leading to the
recruitment of the adaptor protein MyD88 and the subsequent
activation of TLR signalling pathways [47]. In adaptive immunity,
various cathepsins participate in the proteolytic processing of an-
tigens into short peptides and the degradation of the invariant
chain, thereby facilitating adaptive immune responses [38]. The key
enzymes in invariant chain processing are cathepsins L and S, with
the latter playing a major role in the majority of organs and cell
types [48], whereas cathepsin L is likely replaced by cathepsin V in
humans [49,50]. However, cathepsins play redundant roles in
antigen-processing for presentation to major histocompatibility
complex II (MHC II) molecules.
Another physiological process in which cathepsins play a crucial
role is bone remodelling. Thus, cathepsin K was found to be critical
for the degradation of the extracellular matrix within bone, carti-
lage, and vascular tissues [14,35]. Regulated by the receptor acti-
vator of nuclear factor kB ligand (RANKL)-RANK signalling, its
expression is predominantly associated with the degradation of
collagen and other matrix proteins during osteoclast-mediated
bone resorption, thereby ensuring the continuous turnover and
maintenance of skeletal tissues [14,51,52].
On the other hand, nuclear cathepsin L has been recognised for
its role in regulating the cell cycle by cleaving the CDP/Cux tran-
scription factor, thereby inﬂuencing the G1/S transition [32]. In
addition, during mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation, murine
cathepsin L demonstrates the ability to cleave the N-terminal tail of

H3 histone, impacting gene regulation [53]. Notably, in humans,
this regulatory role is likely mediated by cathepsin V [12,54] which
is further supported by the fact that human cathepsin V, but not L,
binds to DNA [55].
Several cysteine cathepsins (B, H, L, and S) were found to be
involved in the regulation of apoptosis by targeting and activating
the pro-apoptotic protein Bid and/or degrading prosurvival Bcl-2
homologues, thereby triggering the pro-apoptotic activity of Bak
(BCL2 antagonist/killer) and Bax (BCL2 associated X, apoptosis
regulator) [33,56e58]. The activation of Bak and Bax contributes to
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), facili-
tating the release of pro-apoptotic factors and initiating the
apoptotic cascade. Additionally, an X-chromosome-linked inhibitor
of apoptosis (XIAP) has been identiﬁed as a target of cathepsins,
indicating its potential role in mitochondrial caspase-dependent
apoptosis [33].
In addition, cathepsins B, L, and K have important functions in
the maintenance of constant hormone levels in the blood, for
example, that of thyroid hormones [59].
In conclusion, cysteine cathepsins, with cathepsin B as a notable
example, make valuable contributions to the wound healing pro-
cess. Their involvement in extracellular matrix remodelling, as
observed in scratch-wounding in vitro experiments [60], un-
derscores their signiﬁcance in promoting keratinocyte migration
during wound repair.
2. Cysteine cathepsins in pathologies
Improper functioning and/or regulation of cathepsin activity can
disrupt the delicate functional equilibrium, contributing to several
pathologies including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative
disorders, obesity, bone disorders, arthritis, cystic ﬁbrosis, infec-
tious diseases, and cancer [46]. The aberrant activity of cysteine
cathepsins in pathologies can arise from either excessive activity,
often a consequence of dysregulated inhibition or expression
leading to improper proteolytic processing, or the absence of ac-
tivity, typically resulting from genetic abnormalities such as pyc-
nodysostosis. Their increased activity is often associated with
altered localisation, and in most pathologies, they are found in the
extracellular milieu. However, most of these have been extensively
discussed elsewhere [12,34,61,62], and we have focused primarily
on cancer.
2.1. Cysteine cathepsins and cancer
The historical association of cysteine cathepsins with extracel-
lular proteolysis in cancer dates back to more than four decades and
was initially demonstrated for cathepsin B [63]. However, the
precise roles of individual cysteine cathepsins in the extracellular
milieu remain incompletely understood, given their intricate
landscape. This complexity arises from several contributing factors,
including broad substrate speciﬁcity, the presence of endogenous
inhibitors, tumour-suppressive potential compensatory mecha-
nisms, diverse cellular compositions within tumours, and effects
unrelated to proteolytic function [62,64,65]. Aberrant cysteine
cathepsin activity is commonly observed in cancers of both
epithelial and mesenchymal origin, including several brain, lung,
breast, colorectal, gastrointestinal, and melanoma cancers. Unfor-
tunately, the upregulated expression of cysteine cathepsins in
numerous cancer types is correlated with poor patient prognosis
[62,66e68] (Fig. 1).
How is cathepsin overexpression regulated? It appears that the
major pathways involved are transcriptional activation of TFEB or
signalling pathways mediated by signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT) proteins, speciﬁcally STAT3 and STAT6 [69,70].
Additionally, the expression and secretion of cysteine cathepsins
can increase in response to stimulation by cytokines and in-
terleukins (IL). Pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, including tumour ne-
crosis factor (TNF), IL-1a, IL-1b, and interferon-gamma (IFNg), have
been shown to elevate the secretion of active cathepsin S from
human chondrocytes, human smooth muscle cells, and mouse
macrophages [71,72]. Cathepsins are actively released into the
tumour microenvironment by diverse cell types, including tumour
stromal cells, endothelial cells, tumour-associated macrophages
(TAM),
myoepithelial
cells,
ﬁbroblasts,
and
other
inﬁltrating
cellular components at the tumour site [62,64]. The secretion of
cysteine cathepsins in tumours is often accompanied by acidiﬁca-
tion of the extracellular milieu, a phenomenon that is particularly
pronounced in the tumour microenvironment. Tumour-associated
cells secrete large amounts of cathepsins into a mildly acidic
environment, which is conducive to enzyme activity.
Cysteine cathepsins play important roles in many processes
linked to tumourigenesis, including extracellular matrix degrada-
tion, angiogenesis, autophagy, apoptosis regulation, cancer inva-
sion, metastasis, and disruption of cell-cell contacts. All of these
have been well documented based on in vivo animal studies, in vitro
studies
involving
cellular
models,
and
clinical
data
[35,62,64e66,73e76]. However, the molecular signalling pathways
involved in these processes are not well understood. Perhaps the
most explored is the role of cysteine cathepsins in extracellular
matrix (ECM) degradation, a signiﬁcant contributor to cancer pro-
gression. Cathepsins have been found to degrade numerous ECM
proteins including collagen, elastin, nidogen, ﬁbronectin, laminin,
osteonectin, and tenascin [35]. The degradation of ECM barriers
facilitates the invasion of cancer cells into the surrounding tissues,
fostering
cancer dissemination.
Therefore, increased
cysteine
cathepsin expression and the extracellular presence of these en-
zymes are associated with more aggressive cancer phenotypes and
increased inﬂammation [34,62,64].
An important role of cathepsins was also discovered in the
disruption of cell-cell contacts. This was primarily linked to the
cathepsin sheddase function, wherein cathepsins L and S have been
found to shed several cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and junction
adhesion molecules (JAMs) from the cell surface, including ALCAM,
MCAM, and JAM-B, further contributing to tumourigenesis [77,78].
In addition, cathepsins have been found to shed several trans-
membrane receptors, such as transferrin receptors, neuropilins,
ephrin-type receptors, and plexin B2, as well as for various cyto-
kines, chemokines, and growth factors, all of which contribute to
cancer growth and metastasis [34,79]. For instance, cathepsins B
and L have been shown to alter the cell response to insulin-like
growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a polypeptide that mediates somatic
growth and can be dysregulated in various pathologies [80,81].
Cathepsin B also plays regulatory roles in cancer cell proliferation
by inﬂuencing ERK/MAPK signalling in pancreatic [82] and colo-
rectal cancers [83]. Similarly, Cathepsin L plays a signiﬁcant role in
cancer cell cycle regulation through its involvement in ERK/MAPK
signalling [84] and the activation of the CDP/Cux transcription
factor [32]. Notably, the loss of cathepsin B expression or cathepsin
L activity leads to diminished cancer cell proliferation.
Several cathepsins, including B, L, and S, signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
angiogenesis. Speciﬁcally, cathepsin B has been identiﬁed as a
regulator of angiogenesis in gliomas and colon cancer, potentially
through its modulation of pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the activity of matrix
metalloproteinase-9
(MMP-9)
[85,86].
Cathepsin
L
facilitates
angiogenesis directly by activating the angiogenesis-associated
function of endothelial cells [87], or indirectly by modulating the
CDP/Cux/VEGF-D pathway [88]. However, cathepsins L and, S, were
also found to generate endostatin, a potent anti-angiogenic factor

14
from collagen XVIII, possibly having dual roles [13,89]. Antibody-
mediated inhibition of cathepsin S effectively impedes both
angiogenesis and invasiveness in colorectal tumours [90].
In addition to their extracellular roles, cysteine cathepsins also
play important intracellular roles in cancer. They serve as the pri-
mary effectors of protein catabolism and autophagy. This is crucial
for the increased metabolic demands of proliferating cancer cells.
Increased metabolic needs are supported by the activation of the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway [91].
Another intracellular function is their potential involvement in the
resistance to or triggering of apoptosis in cancer cells. Cathepsins
were found to activate the BH3-only molecule Bid and degrade
several anti-apoptotic proteins from the Bcl-2 family, thereby
promoting apoptosis [33,56,58]. In addition, they have been sug-
gested to be involved in other apoptotic signalling pathways [79];
however, it is not clear whether their pro-apoptotic functions could
be used for therapeutic purposes without triggering signiﬁcant side
effects [92].
In many studies, cysteine cathepsins have exhibited contrasting
roles depending on the tissue or cell type, as observed in several
animal cancer models. In general, most cathepsins have potent
tumour-promoting
functions
[62,73,75,93e97].

other models, the same cathepsin may not contribute signiﬁcantly
to cancer progression, or may even have the opposite effect. The
most pronounced effect was demonstrated for the loss of cathepsin
L, exhibiting cancer promotion in Ctsl-deﬁcient mice, which
showed enhanced susceptibility to skin carcinogenesis compared
to the wild-type, and in HPV16/Ctsl deﬁcient mice, where it has
been demonstrated that cathepsin L acts as an epidermal tumour
suppressor [98,99]. Oppositely, in the pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumour (PanNET) mouse model RIP1-Tag2, which was Ctsl deﬁ-
cient, it was shown that there is a decrease in cell proliferation in
parallel with increased apoptosis [73]. In the same study of PanNET,
they also conﬁrmed a reduction in tumour burden, an increase in
apoptosis, a reduction in proliferation and a decrease in angio-
genesis when the mice model was deﬁcient in Catb gene. Moreover,
the loss of cathepsin B activity resulted in delayed progression and
decreased proliferation of both the pancreatic intraepithelial
neoplasia (PanIN) and the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA)
which signiﬁcantly improved survival in mice [82]. Similarly, the
knock-out of the cathepsin B gene in mouse mammary cancer
model MMTV-PyMT resulted in reduced cell proliferation in
mammary carcinomas and their lung metastases [100]. Moreover,
the loss of cathepsin B activity also contributes to cancer progres-
sion in the breast cancer model due to the compensatory increase
in cathepsin X activity [101]. This highlights the critical need to
consider speciﬁc cellular and tissue environments when investi-
gating the role of cysteine cathepsins in tumour development.
However, there have been numerous reviews on the role of ca-
thepsins in cancer, and we do not discuss them in detail
[62,64,95,96,102,103]. For a comprehensive overview of the asso-
ciation between individual cathepsins and various cancer types,
please refer to Table 1 and the references within.
2.2. Cathepsins as diagnostic markers in cancer
Cathepsin-speciﬁc measurements in cancer diagnostics enhance
the accuracy of identifying high-risk individuals and monitoring
tumour progression, which are instrumental in the creation of
personalised treatment plans. Numerous studies have demon-
strated the changes in the levels of various cathepsins in biological
samples [180], highlighting their immense clinical potential as
biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis, which could enhance sur-
vival rates and improve prognosis. Recent ﬁndings using enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have shown that in patients
with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the levels of salivary
cathepsin B are signiﬁcantly elevated compared to those in a con-
trol group. This increase was closely correlated with both histo-
logical grades and tumour sizes in patients with OSCC, suggesting
that cathepsin B is an effective salivary biomarker for early cancer
detection [117]. Serum cathepsin B concentrations were signiﬁ-
cantly elevated in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)
compared to healthy controls [181]. Additionally, it has been re-
ported that serum cathepsin B levels are diagnostic markers of
oesophageal cancer, showing higher concentrations in patient sera
than in controls [182]. Elevated levels of cathepsin F in the serum
and tissues were found to be signiﬁcantly upregulated in patients
with non-small cell lung cancer brain metastasis (NSCLC BM),
making it a promising biomarker for early diagnosis. Changes in
serum cathepsin F levels effectively reﬂected the therapeutic
response in these patients, indicating its potential as a valuable tool
for monitoring treatment efﬁcacy [183]. Notably, cathepsin K is
recognised as an immunohistochemical marker for categorising
primary renal neoplasms, following the guidelines set by the In-
ternational Society of Urological Pathology [184,185]. Under normal
conditions, cathepsin K is prominently expressed in osteoclasts
within the bone and exhibits low expression levels in other organs
[186]. However, its expression is elevated in various cancer tissues.
This overexpression is associated with metastatic cancer, under-
scoring its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker [187].
Recent immunoblotting experiments have revealed signiﬁcant
upregulation of urinary fucosylated glycoproteins, particularly
cathepsin C and transferrin, in patients with small-cell lung cancer
(SCLC). Moreover, the synthesis of cathepsin C in glioma cells was
signiﬁcantly greater than that in non-cancerous cells, with higher
protein expression observed in high-grade gliomas, indicating that
cathepsin C may serve as an efﬁcient molecular target for diag-
nosing patients with brain tumours [123]. ELISA revealed the po-
tential of serum cathepsin S as a promising biomarker for gastric
cancer; elevated levels demonstrate diagnostic value correlating
with tumour characteristics and serve as a prognostic indicator of
overall survival [188]. Collectively, these ﬁndings indicate the po-
tential of cathepsins as biomarkers of multiple cancer types.
2.3. Cathepsins as prognostic markers in cancer
Monitoring the overexpression of cathepsins in patients with
cancer is crucial for predicting disease progression because it is
typically associated with poor prognosis. However, in rare cases,
cathepsin overexpression may be associated with a better prog-
nosis, indicating a nuanced role of cathepsins in different cancer
types [189]. This complexity is exempliﬁed by cathepsin B, which is
associated with tumour progression in various cancers including
colorectal, breast, lung, pancreatic, and gastric cancers [65].
Recently, cathepsin B has been identiﬁed as a negative prognostic
biomarker and therapeutic target in gliomas, where it is associated
with immune cell inﬁltration and immunosuppression [190,191].
Moreover, it has been revealed that cathepsin B is overexpressed in
the invasive front of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC)
compared to the tumour centre, showing a correlation with poor
patient prognosis. Overexpression of cathepsin B, particularly in
leader cells, is crucial for collective cell invasion, inﬂuencing
extracellular matrix remodelling, and potentially deﬁning its role as
a key regulator in SACC progression [121]. The potential of
cathepsin B as a prognostic marker for cancer can be enhanced by
combining it with other biomarkers of interest. The ratio of serum
cystatin C to cathepsin B offers signiﬁcant prognostic value for
predicting survival in patients with oesophageal carcinoma, with
notably higher levels than normal indicating a more severe con-
dition [182]. Furthermore, cathepsin K overexpression has been
linked to a poor prognosis and increased lymph node metastasis in
gastric cancer [192]. Similarly, in sarcomas, such as myxoﬁ-
brosarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, its over-
expression is associated with a higher risk of local recurrence and
disease-speciﬁc mortality [193]. In salivary gland carcinomas
(SGCs), their signiﬁcant overexpression correlates with high-grade
tumours, metastasis, and recurrence, reinforcing the potential of
cathepsin K as a valuable prognostic biomarker across these diverse
cancer types [194]. Additionally, using ELISA, it was observed that
patients with metastatic lung cancer had an overexpression of
cathepsin V in their serum compared to the control group, indi-
cating a worse prognosis, further suggesting that cathepsin V could
serve as a prognostic biomarker for lung cancer [173,195]. More-
over, recent research utilising the Cancer Genome Atlas-Liver He-
patocellular Carcinoma database identiﬁed cathepsin V as a gene of
prognostic signiﬁcance in liver cancer, where high cathepsin V
expression correlates with poor prognosis, underscoring its po-
tential as a biomarker for predicting outcomes in this cancer [196].
Similarly, in breast cancer, especially within the ER-positive luminal
A subtype, cathepsin V expression has been linked to poor prog-
nosis, highlighting its signiﬁcance as a prognostic marker for this
speciﬁc cancer subtype [172,197]. In contrast, a recent study

analysed the expression of cathepsin S across multiple human
cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas, demonstrating its
potential as a prognostic biomarker in various cancers. The study
showed signiﬁcant differential expression of cathepsin S across
various
cancers,
with
overexpression
signiﬁcantly
linked
to
improved overall survival outcomes in colorectal, renal, melanoma,
bladder, lung, lymphoma, sarcoma, and ovarian cancers, but worse
outcomes in glioma and uveal cancer [160]. Using machine learning
to identify biomarkers, it has been found that cathepsin W is
signiﬁcantly downregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,
correlating with poor prognosis [175]. Field experts strongly
advocate the use of machine learning to identify biomarkers in
various cancers, highlighting its potential to signiﬁcantly improve
diagnostic accuracy in oncology. Consequently, close monitoring of
both increases and decreases in cathepsin expression and under-
standing how these variations affect cancer prognosis are critical
for accurately predicting the course of the disease.
3. Cathepsin imaging probes
Although the diagnostic approaches discussed above, including
ELISA immunodetection, are highly speciﬁc, the use of cathepsin
imaging probes potentially has additional diagnostic value. These
probes speciﬁcally target the active protease form, allowing for a
more detailed evaluation of their functional state and activity in
biological systems, which enhances their diagnostic capabilities
compared to traditional methods.
3.1. Molecular probes for cathepsin detection
In the ﬁeld of probes and diagnostics, two primary categories are
used to proﬁle protease activity under in vitro and in vivo condi-
tions:
substrate-
and
inhibitor-based
probes
(activity-based
probes; ABPs) [198,199]. Substrate-based probes generally require
enzyme cleavage or activation for signal generation. They are often
named based on their signal generation mechanisms, such as ﬂu-
orogenic or F€orster resonance energy-transfer (FRET) probes [200].
In contrast, ABPs, which originate from activity-based protein
proﬁling [201], are designed to form covalent bonds at the catalytic
site of the enzyme upon activation. These ABPs interact directly
with the enzyme, offering a more precise measurement of their
activity in various biological contexts (Fig. 2) [200,202].
Luminescent substrate-based imaging probes are widely used to
detect cancer-associated proteins and their binding partners. In
general, such probes are constructed using a molecular framework
that includes a quenching group to suppress luminescence. Upon
interaction with a speciﬁc cathepsin, the removal of the quenching
group leads to a detectable light signal [202]. In 1999, Weissleder
et al. pioneered the development of substrate-based probes acti-
vated by various lysosomal cathepsins. One of the ﬁrst polymer
probes developed was (Cy5.5)11-PL-methoxypolyethyleneglycol92
(CPGC), a graft copolymer designed for cathepsin B detection con-
sisting of poly-L-lysine, methoxypolyethylene glycol succinate, and
Cy5.5 dye. It showed low ﬂuorescence because of the auto-
quenching of ﬂuorophores whereas processing by cathepsins
restored the majority of the quenched ﬂuorescence [203,204].
Subsequently, the pan-cathepsin probe Z-FR-HMRG was designed
using hydroxymethyl rhodamine green (HMRG) as a reporter. It
provides a high tumour-to-background ﬂuorescence ratio, which
makes it particularly useful for real-time in vivo imaging of ca-
thepsins using ﬂuorescence endoscopy, proving to be especially
effective in visualising intraperitoneally disseminated tumours
[205]. Additionally, a luciferin-based bioluminescence probe, Val-
Cit-AL,
was
developed
for
monitoring
cathepsin
B
activity,
demonstrating a “turn-on” of bioluminescence intensity at 590 nm
with an excellent limit of detection (27 mU/L) in vitro. Time-course
bioluminescence imaging of mouse breast cancer models indicated
that Val-Cit-AL was sufﬁciently stable for short-term in vivo imag-
ing [206]. According to recent data, the Val-Cit linker previously
associated with cathepsin B can also be cleaved by other cysteine
cathepsins
[207].
Furthermore,
two
novel
ﬂuorescent/photo-
acoustic (FL/PA) probes, HCy-Cit-Val and HCy-Gly-Leu-Phe-Gly,
were developed for in vivo imaging of cathepsin B. These probes
demonstrated high sensitivity and selectivity and successfully
monitored cathepsin activity in vivo, with HCy-Cit-Val showing
superior properties owing to its higher catalytic efﬁciency, paving
the way for its potential clinical use in early cancer diagnosis [208].
Although advances have been made in ﬂuorogenic substrate-
based probes for cathepsin detection, their use is often limited by
background signal issues owing to incomplete quenching. To
overcome this problem, FRET-based probes that utilise F€orster
resonance energy transfer have been developed. These probes
enhance the signal-to-noise ratio through their efﬁcient energy-
transfer mechanism, leading to more precise and accurate detec-
tion of cathepsins [209]. Additionally, these probes can be modiﬁed
to enhance certain features, such as increasing their uptake by cells
or improving their ability to target tumours. In addition, the
cathepsin S-selective FRET probe was modiﬁed by attaching pal-
mitoic acid to the reporter. The lipid-modiﬁed probe showed a
prolonged and more intense ﬂuorescent signal in tumours than a
similar probe without lipidation. This indicates the potential of
non-invasive in vivo tumour detection using such modiﬁed probes
[210,211].
Furthermore, the ﬁeld of clinical diagnostics has notable con-
tributions from activity-based diagnostics. ABPs with a classic ar-
chitecture are built to include a reporter tag, a linker (or spacer),
and an electrophilic warhead. This chemical moiety forms an irre-
versible covalent bond with the active enzyme in a mechanism-
based manner [202]. In 2005, Blum et al. were the ﬁrst to
develop an ABP for cysteine cathepsins by introducing the concept
of quenched ﬂuorescent activity-based probes. These probes are
initially non-ﬂuorescent, but become ﬂuorescent upon interacting
with their target enzymes because of the displacement of the
quencher group. They incorporated ﬂuorophores into a peptide
coupled with an acyloxymethyl ketone (AOMK) warhead and
quencher to design cathepsin B- and L-selective GB111 probes
[212]. In addition, the probe selectivity can vary with the recogni-
tion sequence. New substrates with high speciﬁcity for cathepsin L
were identiﬁed using a positional scanning substrate approach
with a hybrid combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) containing
many unnatural amino acids [100]. This work resulted in the dis-
covery of the His-DThr-Phe(F5)-Cys (Bzl) sequence, which was
modiﬁed with Cy5 dye through a 6-aminohexanoic acid spacer at
the N-terminus and an (AOMK) warhead. This probe, named MP-
cL3, distinguishes the activity of cathepsin L from that of other
cathepsins [213]. A selective ABP for cathepsin B, MP-cB-2, was
developed using a similar strategy. This probe was designed with a
Cy5 dye at the N-terminus and an AOMK warhead at the C-terminus
connected to a Cha-Leu-Glu (Bzl)-Arg sequence. The probe was
employed to selectively label cathepsin B in eighteen tested cancer
cell lines, establishing that this probe is highly suitable for various
biological setups [214]. An example of this is qABP BMV083, which
is composed of a triazole-based inhibitor, Cy5 dye, and a 2,6-
dimethyl benzoic AOMK warhead with a QSY21 quencher. This
probe, which exhibited selectivity for cathepsin S, enabled the
visualisation of cancer in vivo in several murine models [215]. Later,
the same probe was altered by introducing 2,3,5,6-tetraﬂuoro-
substituted phenoxymethyl ketones (PMK) as electrophilic war-
heads alongside a sulfonated QSY21 dark quencher to improve pan-
cathepsin labelling. This BMV109 probe was successfully employed

17
for in vivo imaging of breast cancer in mice, verifying the role of
cathepsins
in
CD68þ
tumour-associated
macrophages
[216].
Notably, a switch in the reactive group on a particular scaffold can
signiﬁcantly alter the speciﬁcity of the probe, underscoring the
importance of strategic design in achieving target selectivity.
In addition, Kramer et al. developed designed ankyrin repeat
protein (DARPin) 8h6, a small antibody mimetic that is highly se-
lective for cathepsin B and is characterised by its high afﬁnity and
ﬂuorescent labelling. DARPin was effective in monitoring tumour-
associated protein binding and was successfully used for mini-
mally invasive in vivo imaging in two mouse models of breast
cancer [217]. Recently, a nanoprobe based on cathepsin B and
ﬁbronectin overexpression was developed to provide a way to
image and treat triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and treat it
through photodynamic therapy. The probe binds to ﬁbronectin-rich
areas and is cleaved by cathepsin B, thereby releasing a photosen-
sitive agent. This therapeutic agent allows for simultaneous ﬂuo-
rescence imaging, MR imaging, and photodynamic therapy at the
same time [218]. Another activity-based photodynamic probe for
the treatment and imaging of cancers was developed based on a
carrier probe with a cathepsin-recognizing sequence that uses a
QC-1 quencher to further reduce toxicity to nearby tissues. The
quencher is released upon contact with overexpressed cathepsins
in the tumour tissue, and the bacteriochlorin-based photosensitiser
is activated [219]. Recently, a dual-modality theranostic agent,
68Ga/90Y-BMX2, targeting cathepsin B, was developed for cancer
imaging and therapy, showing high afﬁnity and speciﬁcity for
binding to cathepsin B across various cancer cell lines. The probe
demonstrated effective tumour imaging using PET and ﬂuorescence
and signiﬁcant tumour growth inhibition in HeLa xenografts,
highlighting its potential for clinical translation in cancer thera-
nostics [220]. To utilise another imaging modality, functional CT
imaging,
gold
nanoparticles
were
combined
with
cysteine
cathepsin-targeted ABPs, resulting in high concentrations of
contrast agents in the tumour microenvironment [221]. Similarly,
iodinated probes targeting cysteine cathepsins have been devel-
oped. These probes included a targeting peptide speciﬁc to ca-
thepsins, an electrophilic group for activity-dependent covalent
binding, and dendrimer tags containing up to 48 iodine atoms. A
variant with 48 iodine atoms was particularly effective for tumour
imaging, demonstrating enhanced uptake and precise localisation
in the tumour tissue [222].
3.2. Image-guided surgery
Solid tumours are still difﬁcult to treat using non-invasive
methods, requiring treatment by invasive surgical removal. The
disadvantage of surgical removal is the uncertainty regarding the
complete excision of tumour tissue while trying to preserve as
much healthy tissue as possible. To resolve this problem, probes for

image-guided surgery have been developed [194]. Currently, a few
probes used in mice have shown promising results, with one probe
already being tested in humans. The activity-based VGT-309 probe
is activated upon binding to tumour-speciﬁc- enzymes, including
cysteine cathepsins. The ﬁrst tests were performed on surgically
removing breast cancer tumours in mice and improving the tumour
removal accuracy (Fig. 2) [223]. Subsequently, the VGT-309 probe
was tested for pulmonary tumour removal in humans and showed
no toxicity at any of the studied doses and a high tumour-to-
background signal ratio. Recent studies have shown promising re-
sults, for use in other tumour types [224]. There are also FDA-
approved dyes that can be activated in the near-infrared (NIR)
ﬁeld. One of them is indocyanine green (ICG), which binds to a
tumour-targeting- peptide named p28. ICG-p28 complex was used
in vitro breast cancer model to evaluate its effectiveness. The probe
was also tested in xenograft tumours expressing red ﬂorescent
protein (RFP). The dye showed signiﬁcant co-localisation with RFP,
proving that it could speciﬁcally differentiate into tumour cells. The
success of ICG-p28 has shown that operative tumour removal can
be signiﬁcantly improved [225]. In addition, the pan-cathepsin
FRET probe, LUM015, was designed as a PEGylated cathepsin sub-
strate that emitted ﬂuorescence in the NIR range. It has shown
promise for the intraoperative detection of microscopic residual
cancer in solid tumours, effectively labelling tumours in both
mouse models [226] and human clinical trials. Currently, the probe
LUM015 is in the early stages of clinical trials (NCT04440982), for
evaluation of the use of the LUM Imaging System in patients with
breast cancer for intraoperative residual tumour detection. How-
ever, one of the main bottlenecks is the tissue penetration depth of
NIR imaging techniques which currently measures approximately
10 mm. An increase in the viewing depth of NIR imaging techniques
would greatly improve the efﬁciency and accuracy of surgical
removal of cancerous tissues [223].
4. Development and clinical testing of cysteine cathepsin-
based anticancer therapies
Advancements in drug development and medical research have
led to a diverse array of cancer therapies, ranging from traditional
treatments
such
as
chemotherapy
and
surgical
removal
of
cancerous tissue to more innovative approaches that utilise new
markers overexpressed in the tumour microenvironment. Several
innovative approaches for cancer treatment target cysteine ca-
thepsins, as they are known to play a signiﬁcant role in the devel-
opment
of
cancerous
tumours
[62,64,103].
Their
apparent
importance has prompted the initiation of several preclinical and
clinical trials exploring various therapies and diagnostic techniques
based on cysteine cathepsins. Still, the transfer of results from basic
research and preclinical testing to clinics has proven difﬁcult. It is
important to note that, to date, the majority of discovered com-
pounds have only been tested in cell lines and animal models and
have never been brought to clinical trials or the market for use in
clinical therapies. This is partially due to inadequate efﬁcacy or the
occurrence of on- and off-target adverse effects [12,46]. In addition,
preclinical data with cathepsin inhibitors [227e229] or gene abla-
tion experiments in animal cancer models [62] have shown that
blocking cathepsins in general only diminished or delayed tumour
growth but did not clear the tumours, arguing against using in-
hibitors as monotherapies for cancer treatment. Currently, the most
promising strategies for cancer treatment include mechanisms
based on cysteine cathepsin inhibition using selective inhibitors,
targeted drug delivery, and pro-drug activation that utilise cysteine
cathepsin overexpression in the cancerous microenvironment [46].
4.1. Cysteine cathepsin inhibitors
The ﬁrst endeavours to develop selective cysteine cathepsin
inhibitors date back to the early 1980s and continue to be an
important area of research for cancer treatment. Synthetic cysteine
cathepsin inhibitors typically contain an electrophilic reactive
group termed “warhead”, which enables a reaction with the
nucleophilic thiolate part of the cysteine cathepsin active site and a
peptide or nonpeptide moiety [230]. Depending on the type of
reaction between the electrophilic warhead and cysteine cathepsin,
we distinguish between reversible and irreversible mechanisms of
inhibition [231]. The category of irreversible inhibitors includes
compounds based on epoxysuccinates, epoxides and vinylsulfones,
aziridines, azomethyl-, halomethyl- or acyloxymethyl ketones,
azapeptides, hydroxamates, b-lactams, and a, b-unsaturated car-
bonyls. The most commonly used chemical groups as reversible
inhibitors are aldehydes, methyl ketones, diketones, and nitriles
[12,34,230].
One of the main warheads that provides useful information in
the ﬁeld of cathepsin is the epoxide. In 1978 Hanada et al. [232]
isolated E64 from Aspergillus japonicus. This epoxide is a non-
selective inhibitor of all cysteine cathepsins, which greatly con-
tributes to the research on these proteases. Based on the scaffold of
E64, the ﬁrst selective inhibitors of cathepsin B, CA-030 and CA-
074, were designed [233,234]. In vivo studies of human metastatic
melanomas in a mouse lung cancer model showed that CA-074
signiﬁcantly reduced tumour weight, delayed tumour growth,
and signiﬁcantly reduced lung metastasis [235]. In addition,
Withana et al. [236] conﬁrmed the cathepsin B inhibition potential
of CA-074 in a mouse breast tumour model, where it signiﬁcantly
reduced bone metastasis, which was not observed with another
epoxysuccinyl-based
irreversible
broad-spectrum
cysteine
cathepsin inhibitor, JPM-OEt. However, the use of irreversible in-
hibitors poses a concern owing to their potential side effects,
especially in connection with the immune system. This has led to
greater emphasis on the development of reversible inhibitors.
Some of the reversible cathepsin B inhibitors that have been tested
are nitroxoline and its derivatives. They bind to cathepsin B and
reversibly inhibit its enzymatic activity [237]. Cathepsin B inhibi-
tion results in a notable reduction in ECM degradation, which in
turn impairs tumour progression [238]. Another compelling in-
hibitor of cathepsin B is VBY-825. In the preclinical model of
pancreatic islet cancer, it was found to signiﬁcantly reduce the
number of tumours and tumour growth, which was explained by
the observed decrease in proliferation and increase in apoptosis of
the treated tumour cells [228]. Despite the promising results ob-
tained for VBY-825, research was discontinued when the devel-
oping company Virobay closed.
Selective inhibitors of cathepsin S also exhibit anticancer ac-
tivity. In a preclinical in vivo study, Sevenich et al. [78] conﬁrmed
that the selective cathepsin S inhibitor VBY-999 reduced the
tumour burden in the early progression of brain metastasis, but not
in later stages. However, a similar fate was observed for VBY-999,
which was produced by the same company as VBY-825. Prom-
ising inhibitory results were also obtained by a speciﬁc cathepsin S
antibody Fsn0503 in combination with CPT-11 (irinotecan) when
treating HCT116 colorectal carcinoma. Fsn0503 blocked cancer cell
invasion,
resulting
in
attenuated
tumour
growth
[239].
4-
Morpholineurea-Leu-HomoPhe-vinylsulphone (LHVS) and Z-FL-
COCHO (ZFL) have been used in preclinical trials of investigating the
effect of cathepsin S inhibition on autophagy and apoptosis in
glioblastoma.
These
ﬁndings
indicate
that
the
inhibition
of
cathepsin S by LHVS and ZFL induces autophagy, which is a pre-
requisite for the apoptosis of glioblastoma cells [240,241].
In addition to cathepsins B and S, the most pharmacologically

interesting cysteine cathepsin is cathepsin K, which is crucial for
normal bone turnover, although this has not been extensively
explored in cancer. However, in bone metastasis, cathepsin K is
essential for the resorption of the protein matrix, and its inhibition
could potentially result in an increase in bone mass and strength.
This has garnered signiﬁcant attention for the development of
cathepsin K inhibitors with the potential to treat bone remodelling
pathologies, including cancer [231,242]. A handful of cathepsin K
inhibitors have entered clinical trials for osteoporosis and osteo-
arthritis; however, to date, only a few have addressed bone me-
tastases [12,231]. The most extensively tested cathepsin K inhibitor
is the covalent nitrile-based compound, odanacatib (MK-0822)
[243]. Initially, odanacatib gained popularity as it rapidly advanced
through phases 1 and 2 of clinical trials, showing promising results
in reducing bone resorption markers in women with osteoporosis
[242,244]. Further ﬁndings from the Long-term Odanacatib Frac-
ture Trial (LOFT) and LOFT Extension study indicated that odana-
catib may have severe cardiovascular side effects, including stroke,
resulting in its discontinuation [242]. The research and develop-
ment of odanacatib have highlighted the challenging nature of
discovering new cysteine cathepsin-targeting therapies. Typically,
the
primary
issues
associated
with
all
cysteine
cathepsins,
including cathepsin K inhibitors, involve unintended off-target ef-
fects on other cysteine cathepsins as well as on-target toxicity that
inﬂuences many other physiological processes where cathepsin K is
involved and is unrelated to bone resorption [12,46]. Simulta-
neously with the development of odanacatib, a few other cathepsin
K inhibitors targeting bone metastases have been developed. These
inhibitors are AFG-495 and L-235. A preclinical study conducted by,
Le Gall et al. [245] showed that AFG-495 reduces breast cancer-
induced osteolysis and skeletal tumour burden; similarly, Duong
et al. [246] determined that L-235 has the capability to treat bone
metastasis in breast cancer.
Another potential target for cancer treatment is cathepsin C,
owing to its role in the activation of neutrophil serine proteases and
inﬂammation. Although no direct studies have been conducted on
cancer, the most advanced cathepsin C inhibitor, brensocatib, is
currently in phase 3 clinical trials, and strategies for its use in
cancer have been discussed elsewhere [247].
However, the use of cathepsin inhibitors in combined therapy
with other established anticancer drugs such as demonstrated in
combination with paclitaxel (Taxol) in a mammary gland cancer
model substantially enhanced drug efﬁcacy against primary and
metastatic tumours [248], suggesting that cathepsin inhibition may
be used in combination therapies.
5. Targeted delivery systems based on cathepsins
One way to minimise adverse effects and increase the efﬁciency
of cysteine cathepsin-targeted therapies is to use nanoscale de-
livery systems that enable tissue-speciﬁc delivery and drug release.
The most prominent systems include polymers, micelles, liposome
carriers, protease-activatable prodrugs (PAPs), and antibody-drug
conjugates (ADCs) (Fig. 3).
5.1. Polymer carriers
Polymer carriers are a method of drug delivery that uses poly-
mers to increase the bioavailability of therapeutic substances or
degradable polymers and linkers to attach therapeutic molecules.
When the polymer encounters the correct enzyme, it is degraded
and the therapeutic molecule is released into the surrounding
environment. To inhibit cysteine cathepsin, cystatin was bound to a
polymer carrier to increase its uptake by the tumour cells; this
method resulted in increased intracellular cathepsin B inhibition
[249,250].
N-(2-Hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide (HPMA) polymers have
been investigated as base molecules in therapeutics. The main
concern was the accumulation of HPMA in different phagocyte
system-associated tissues. The size of the polymer molecules
directly affects the retention time and off-target effects. Smaller
polymer blocks have a faster clearance time and still exhibit anti-
tumour activity and longer retention times in tumour tissues.
Polymers containing smaller blocks are more readily digested in the
liver than in the spleen [251].
By attaching small molecules to polymers through cleavable
linkers, toxic side effects are reduced and the speciﬁc release of
small molecules can be achieved. HPMA is a polymeric base to
which paclitaxel and gemcitabine can be attached. The efﬁcacies of
different polymer lengths and combinations of attached small
molecules were tested [252]. Polyglutamate can be used as a
biodegradable carrier polymer. Different therapeutic molecules
that are activated or readily absorbed by cells, upon digestion of the
polymer structure by cathepsins, can be attached to polyglutamate.
Initial experiments used an NIR-photosensitive cytotoxic agent. It
has also been proposed that multiple cytotoxic agents can be
attached to achieve a multipronged therapeutic effect. Another
strategy involves the attachment of large cytotoxic molecules that
can enter cells only through endocytosis [253].
5.2. Micelle carriers
Another method for delivering cysteine-targeted drugs involves
the use of micelle carriers. One of their most important advantages
for drug delivery is their small size, which allows them to penetrate
deeper into the tissues. Additionally, their hydrophobic cores allow
for better delivery of certain therapeutics. In recent years, the focus
has shifted to increasing their stability when administered, which is
achieved by decreasing the critical micelle concentration [254]. Gao
et al. [255] developed a self-assembling micelle carrier with an
outer PEG shell and loaded with doxorubicin (DOX), a chemother-
apeutic drug that inhibits cancer cell replication by inhibiting
topoisomerase 2. Upon contact with cathepsin B, the outer PEG
shell is cleaved, and hydrophobic therapeutics are released from
the hydrophobic micelle core to attack the cancerous tissue.
Another delivery method based on micelle carriers involves the
direct crosslinking of small molecules into the micelle system. Us-
ing this method, improved drug loading (up to 58 %) and higher
micelle purity can be achieved. Since the therapeutic is a part of the
amphiphilic molecule, the micelle loading process and micelle as-
sembly happen simultaneously. The main drawback of these small-
molecule micellar systems is their short lifespan [256].
5.3. Liposome carriers
Compared to micelles, liposomes exhibit larger structures.
Synthetic liposomes are composed of amphiphilic molecules
organised into a lipid bilayer, mimicking the conﬁguration of nat-
ural cellular structures. Liposomal carriers can encapsulate mole-
cules within the interior space, integrate them into the lipid bilayer,
or anchor them onto the surface of the bilayer [257]. The ﬁrst
cathepsin inhibitor-carrying liposomes were magnetoliposomes
based on iron oxide-based nanoparticles, which enabled simulta-
neous monitoring by MRI and magnetic targeting, thereby serving
as theranostic agents. This system was successfully used to improve
the low bioavailability of JPM epoxide inhibitors in a mouse

20
mammary gland cancer model [258]. Targeting was further
improved when a lipidated epoxide-based selective cathepsin B
inhibitor was inserted into the liposomal membrane to achieve
active targeting. The liposomes also contained the MRI contrast
agent. Thus, liposomal localisation can be monitored during drug
delivery. Moreover, this system successfully delivered DOX to the
targeted cells and was much more efﬁcient than the classical,
clinically approved doxyl system based on the liposomal delivery of
DOX without targeting. In addition, this is the ﬁrst study in which
cathepsin was used as a target for targeted drug delivery and not as
a therapeutic target [229]. Another example is steﬁn-A, an endog-
enous
cathepsin
inhibitor
successfully
used
as
a
liposome-
conjugated cathepsin-targeting ligand [259]. Another strategy is
to create liposomes that are degraded by cathepsins to release
therapeutic drugs into target cells. The GLFG peptide sequence can
be used to create cathepsin-activating liposomes. The liposomes

conjugates (ADCs), peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs), and probodies that enable tissue-speciﬁc delivery and drug release. Nano-carriers are endocytosed by cancer cells and
degraded in lysosomes, which release the cytotoxic payload, leading to apoptotic cells.

can then be loaded with an anticancer therapeutic agent such as
DOX [260].
5.4. Antibody-based therapies and drug conjugates
In addition to cysteine cathepsin inhibitors, other approaches
utilise the activity of cysteine cathepsins and have gained signiﬁ-
cant attention for the clinical treatment of several tumours. Upre-
gulation of cysteine cathepsins in several cancers has been used to
develop protease-activating prodrugs (PAPs) [261]. PAPs are con-
structed
by
binding
selected
drugs
to
compatible
carriers
(mentioned above) using a speciﬁc linker that is recognised and
cleaved by proteases, including cysteine cathepsins. As a result,
PAPs facilitate targeted drug delivery to cancer sites which lowers
negative side effects [262]. One of the fastest-growing classes of
PAPs is antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), wherein target-speciﬁc
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used as carriers of cytotoxic
drugs [263]. Antibody-based immunotherapies are already an
established ﬁeld in cancer therapy with the promise of fewer side
effects
than
traditional
non-target-speciﬁc
chemotherapy
or
radiotherapy. mAbs bind to speciﬁc antigens on the surface of
cancerous cells, and the ADC is internalised via receptor-mediated
endocytosis. Inside the cancer cell, the ADC is engulfed into a
phagosome,
where
cysteine
cathepsins
cleave
a
speciﬁcally
designed acid-labile linker and release the cytotoxic drug payload.
This results in apoptosis of the cancerous cells. A recognised
adverse outcome associated with ADCs is the bystander effect.
Following apoptosis of a targeted cell, potent cancer-killing mole-
cules are released into the neighbouring environment and are
subsequently absorbed by nearby healthy cells. This leads to the
unintended apoptosis of healthy cells [264,265]. To address the
challenge of treating heterogeneous drug-resistant breast cancer,
researchers developed a cleavable ADC with a dual payload. The
ﬁndings from this study indicate that the efﬁcacy of the dual-
payload approach surpasses that of a combined antibody therapy
in which the payloads are carried by separate antibodies [266].
Similar to drug-resistant breast cancer, pancreatic cancer is also
difﬁcult to treat. To determine a solution, Xu et al. [267] developed
an ADC targeting TROP-2 positive pancreatic cancer cells carrying
the potent antimitotic agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE).
This study showed that the nanobody-drug conjugate exhibited
powerful antitumour activity, providing a novel way to battle TROP-
2 positive pancreatic cancer cells [267].
Currently, there are 15 ADCs in the clinics (Table 2), of which 13
have successfully completed clinical trials and have been accepted
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or European
Medicines Agency (EMA) as efﬁcient drugs to combat cancer. The
remaining two are yet to be approved by the FDA or EMA, but are
already available in the Japanese and Chinese markets. Eight of the
15 ADCs contain linkers that are recognised by proteases, three are
pH-sensitive, two are non-cleavable, one is cleaved by glutathione,
and the last has an undisclosed linker structure [264,268].
Valineecitrullineep-aminobenzyl carbamate (ValCitPABC) is the
most widely established linker used in clinical ADCs, that is cleav-
able by cysteine cathepsins. This peptide linker is recognised
mainly by cysteine cathepsins B and L [269], which initiate the
cleavage of the amide bond between citrulline and PABC, resulting
in the release of the drug from the antibody. However, it was later
shown that the ValCitPABC linker is also cleaved by cysteine ca-
thepsins S and F [207]. Later, efforts were made to discover new
linkers with better properties than those of ValCitPABC. Salomon
et al. [265] designed and tested multiple newly designed linkers
against the clinically established linkers. They discovered that the
linkers Val-Gln (valine-glutamine), Leu-Gln (leucine-glutamine),
and Phe-Gln (phenylalanine-glutamine) were cleaved at a faster
rate by cysteine cathepsins than by ValCitPABC. At the same time,
they also show high stability in plasma. However, this has not
progressed beyond the scope of preclinical studies.

One of the main obstacles in the development of anticancer
drugs is their ability to penetrate solid tumours. Because of their
size, antibodies have a limited ability to penetrate solid tumours;
thus, new approaches for treating solid malignancies are being
developed. In addition to cysteine cathepsin-cleavable linkers in
ADCs, they are also used in peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs). They
represent an important class of therapeutic agents for effective
prodrug-targeted delivery. PDCs are constructed by binding a
cytotoxic drug to a carrier through a cleavable linker. However,
PDCs utilise speciﬁc peptides instead of mAbs for the active tar-
geting of a speciﬁc receptor on the surface of tumour cells. Peptides
allow PDCs to penetrate the cancer cell membrane and release
cytotoxic drugs inside the tumour cells [270,271]. The two main
subclasses of peptides used in PDC research are cell-penetrating
peptides (CPPs) and tumour-penetrating peptides (a class of
tumour-homing peptides). CPPs can be non-selectively internalised
by all cells, limiting their use in cancer research. In contrast,
tumour-penetrating peptides are more interesting for cancer
research because they can efﬁciently bind to speciﬁc tumour re-
ceptors and penetrate deep into cancerous tissues [272,273]. Small

size of PDCs convey low immunogenicity but at the same time, they
are limited by short half-life in blood [262,274].
Protease-activated antibody prodrugs, also termed probodies,
have been developed to overcome the ﬂaws in the treatment of
solid tumours. They address the unwanted binding of antibody
carriers to the target antigens in healthy tissues which causes un-
desirable side effects. Probody therapeutics contain a masking
peptide bound to the N-terminus of the light chain of the antibody
through a protease-cleavable linker that physically prevents the
antibody binding. In the cancerous microenvironment, overex-
pressed cysteine cathepsins recognise and cleave speciﬁcally
designed probody linkers, resulting in fully active antibodies
[262,275,276]. The effectiveness of this method in clinical settings
is evident in completed phase 1 clinical trials of probodies CX-2009
and CX-2029; however, the details of the mechanisms have not yet
been disclosed [277,278].
6. Conclusions
In conclusion, cysteine cathepsins are major players in cancer
progression. Therefore, they are considered as potential target
molecules in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Although cathepsins
are considered valuable diagnostic and prognostic markers for
various cancers, they have never progressed beyond the preclinical
evaluation stage. Approaches based on cathepsin targeting have
recently attracted considerable attention. It seems that the classical
inhibition of cathepsins is unlikely to succeed as a monotherapy;
however, there is more hope for combination therapy, although it is
not clear whether broad-spectrum inhibition or selective inhibition
of an individual cathepsin would be more successful. Diagnostic
imaging based on cathepsin-targeting has entered clinical trials
and can be complemented with image-guided surgery. The most
extensively exploited areas are antibody-drug conjugates and
activatable prodrugs with several drugs, that use cysteine cathep-
sins activity, being approved for clinical use. Finally, the develop-
ment of targeted drug delivery systems based on cathepsin-
targeting is an emerging area of research. However, none of these
studies has progressed beyond preclinical testing. Continued ad-
vancements in this ﬁeld offer hope for new insights in cancer
research.
