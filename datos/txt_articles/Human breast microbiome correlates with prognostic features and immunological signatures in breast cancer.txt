Abstract
Background: Currently, over half of breast cancer cases are unrelated to known risk factors, highlighting the
importance of discovering other cancer-promoting factors. Since crosstalk between gut microbes and host
immunity contributes to many diseases, we hypothesized that similar interactions could occur between the recently
described breast microbiome and local immune responses to influence breast cancer pathogenesis.
Methods: Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we characterized the microbiome of human breast tissue in a total of
221 patients with breast cancer, 18 individuals predisposed to breast cancer, and 69 controls. We performed
bioinformatic analyses using a DADA2-based pipeline and applied linear models with White’s t or Kruskal–Wallis H-
tests with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction to identify taxonomic groups associated with prognostic
clinicopathologic features. We then used network analysis based on Spearman coefficients to correlate specific
bacterial taxa with immunological data from NanoString gene expression and 65-plex cytokine assays.
Results: Multiple bacterial genera exhibited significant differences in relative abundance when stratifying by breast
tissue type (tumor, tumor adjacent normal, high-risk, healthy control), cancer stage, grade, histologic subtype,
receptor status, lymphovascular invasion, or node-positive status, even after adjusting for confounding variables.
Microbiome–immune networks within the breast tended to be bacteria-centric, with sparse structure in tumors and
more interconnected structure in benign tissues. Notably, Anaerococcus, Caulobacter, and Streptococcus, which were
major bacterial hubs in benign tissue networks, were absent from cancer-associated tissue networks. In addition,
Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus, which were depleted in tumors, showed negative associations with
oncogenic immune features; Streptococcus and Propionibacterium also correlated positively with T-cell activation-
related genes.

Conclusions: This study, the largest to date comparing healthy versus cancer-associated breast microbiomes using
fresh-frozen surgical specimens and immune correlates, provides insight into microbial profiles that correspond
with prognostic clinicopathologic features in breast cancer. It additionally presents evidence for local microbial–
immune interplay in breast cancer that merits further investigation and has preventative, diagnostic, and
therapeutic potential.

Background
Despite the prevalence of breast cancer, many cases are
unrelated to known risk factors. Furthermore, not all in-
dividuals with genetic predisposition or exposure to doc-
umented environmental factors develop disease [1],
indicating an urgent need to identify additional determi-
nants of breast carcinogenesis. Increasing evidence sug-
gests that the gut microbiome plays a significant role in
immunity and other essential host processes and that
microbial perturbation (dysbiosis) contributes to disease
states, including malignancy [2]. Recently, tissue-resident
microbes at other sites such as the skin, oral cavity, and
respiratory tracts have been discovered [3]. While several
groups, including ours, have found that the breast har-
bors a diverse microbiome that differs significantly in
patients with and without breast cancer [4–9], the func-
tion of microbiota at extra-intestinal tissues remains
poorly understood.
Immune homeostasis in the gut relies on constant
crosstalk between the microbiota and host immune cells.
By influencing metabolism, inflammation, and immune
responses, the microbiome can regulate cancer initiation
and progression at both local and distant sites [10]. Intri-
guingly, recent work using mouse models demonstrated
that gut microbial composition can determine suscepti-
bility to mammary carcinoma [11]. In humans, a large
case–control study showed that increasing cumulative
antibiotic use corresponded with increased breast cancer
risk [12]. With major efforts focused on examining re-
gional and systemic effects of the gut microbiome, much
less consideration has been given to putative interactions
between extra-intestinal microbial populations and local
immunity, especially as they relate to carcinogenesis.
Though bacterial 16S rRNA and lipopolysaccharides can
associate with immune cells in breast tumors, their im-
pact on immune function remains unclear [13]. Conceiv-
ably, the breast microbiota may influence breast cancer
development and growth not only by modulating local
estrogen levels [14], but also by shaping inflammatory
responses
and
immune
trafficking
in
the
tumor
microenvironment.
To better understand the role of regional micro-
biome–immune system interplay in breast tumorigen-
esis, we compared the breast microbiota and immune
signatures of patients with breast cancer to those of
healthy individuals, focusing on microbial and immuno-
logical differences that co-varied with one another and
with clinicopathologic factors. We thereby sought to ad-
dress the hypothesis that patients with versus without
breast cancer have distinct microbial and immunological
profiles and associations, which highlight potential con-
nections between the breast microbiome and local
cancer-related immune responses.
Methods
Patient enrollment and tissue collection
Fresh-frozen breast tissues were requested from three
tissue biorepositories (Cleveland Clinic Breast Center
Microbiome Biorepository, Cooperative Human Tissue
Network, and Case Comprehensive Cancer Center Hu-
man Tissue Procurement Facility). Specimens were ob-
tained
using
standard
biorepository
protocols
from
female patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer, re-
duction mammoplasty, or prophylactic mammoplasty
who provided written informed consent. If available,
breast cancer (tumor) and adjacent normal breast tissue
(tumor adjacent normal) pairs from the same donor
were included. Tissue from patients without breast can-
cer (healthy control) was verified by a pathologist to be
free of malignant cells. Patients with genetic predispos-
ition (pathogenic gene carrier or first-degree relative
with breast cancer) or past personal history of breast
cancer were considered at high risk for breast cancer.
Histopathological data were compiled from pathology
reports. For patients recruited at the Cleveland Clinic,
additional clinical history and information regarding
breast cancer risk factors were acquired through a com-
bination of patient interview and standardized question-
naire. Breast cancer staging was standardized using
American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for Inter-
national Cancer Control 8th edition TNM pathologic
stage criteria. Specimens were flash frozen and stored at
−80 °C until further processing. This study was ap-
proved by the Cleveland Clinic institutional review board
(IRB #14-774 and 17-791).
To control for possible environmental microbial con-
tamination, a specimen container filled with 5 ml of ster-
ile saline or water was left open in the operating room

during breast surgery at each institution from which
specimens were collected (Cleveland Clinic, Hospital of
the University of Pennsylvania, The Ohio State Univer-
sity Wexner Medical Center, University Hospitals Cleve-
land Medical Center, University of Virginia Medical
Center). These environmental controls were also stored
at
−80 °C
and
processed
in
parallel
with
tissue
specimens.
RNA extraction
Total RNA was extracted from frozen breast tissue using
the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) with the following modification. Samples were
homogenized in 2-ml tubes with Lysing Matrix A (MP
Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA) and 1 ml QIAzol Lysis
Reagent using a FastPrep-24 5G instrument (MP Bio-
medicals) with 3 runs of 30 s at 6 m/s. Subsequently,
RNA preparation was performed according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol, including the optional on-column
DNase digestion step. RNA concentrations and quality
(A260/280, A260/230) were determined by spectropho-
tometry (Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 1000, Waltham,
MA, USA), and samples were stored at −80 °C until fur-
ther analysis.
NanoString gene expression analysis
Total RNA was hybridized to the Human Immunology
v2 Panel CodeSet and processed on an nCounter GEN2
Digital Analyzer (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA,
USA) per manufacturer’s instructions. Normalization,
background
subtraction,
and
hybridization/binding
intensity correction were performed using nCounter Ad-
vanced Analysis 2.0 software (NanoString Technologies),
and resulting values were log2-transformed for down-
stream analysis. K-means clustering of normalized gene
expression based on one minus the Pearson correlation
was performed using Morpheus (Broad Institute, Cam-
bridge, MA, USA). Differential pathway analysis, KEGG
pathway overlay, and immune cell type profiling were
also conducted using Advanced Analysis software. False
discovery rates (FDR) for differential gene expression
were adjusted using the Benjamini–Yekutieli method.
Multiplex cytokine assay
Frozen breast
tissue was placed into chilled
2-ml
homogenization
tubes
containing
3.0 mm zirconium
beads (Benchmark Scientific, Edison, NJ, USA). Cold
PBS
with
2X
complete
protease
inhibitor
cocktail
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was added in a ratio of 4 μl/
mg (tumor) or 3 μl/mg (non-tumor) tissue, and samples
were homogenized using a FastPrep-24 5G instrument
(MP Biomedicals) with 3 runs of 30 s at 6 m/s. After se-
quential centrifugation (14,000×g for 15 min at 4 °C,
transfer to a new tube, then 14,000×g for 10 min at 4 °C),
supernatant aliquots were taken for protein quantifica-
tion using a BCA assay kit (Thermo Scientific) in ac-
cordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. PBS with
protease inhibitor was added to normalize the protein
concentrations of all supernatant samples to 1.5 mg/ml,
and samples were stored at −80 °C until analysis. Cyto-
kine expression was evaluated using the Human Cyto-
kine/Chemokine Array 65-Plex Assay performed by Eve
Technologies (Calgary, AB, Canada). Background fluor-
escence was subtracted from all samples, and data were
log10-transformed prior to further analysis.
DNA extraction
Bacterial genomic DNA was isolated from frozen breast
tissue and environmental controls using the QIAamp
PowerFecal Pro DNA Kit (Qiagen) with minor modifica-
tions as follows. To minimize contamination from envir-
onmental microbial DNA, all pipettes, pipette tips, and
non-enzymatic kit components were UV-irradiated for
at least 1 h prior to use, and extraction was performed in
a dedicated laminar flow hood (AirClean 600 PCR
Workstation,
Creedmoor,
NC,
USA)
[15].
For
homogenization, samples were placed into 2-ml tubes
with Lysing Matrix A (MP Biomedicals) along with
800 μl Solution CD1 and processed with 4 runs of 45 s
at 6 m/s in a FastPrep-24 5G instrument (MP Biomedi-
cals). The rest of the protocol proceeded per the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Buffer-only negative controls and
extraction positive controls (ZymoBIOMICS Microbial
Community Standard; Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA)
were processed identically in parallel. DNA concentra-
tions and quality (A260/280, A260/230) were deter-
mined
by
spectrophotometry
(Thermo
Scientific
NanoDrop 1000), and samples were stored at −20 °C
until 16S rRNA gene library preparation.
16S rRNA gene sequencing
Bacterial 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 and V7-V9 regions were
PCR-amplified using the QIAseq 16S Region Panel (Qia-
gen) according to kit instructions for amplification of
samples with low bacterial content followed by PCR
cleanup. Pipettes and plasticware were UV-irradiated be-
fore use, and PCR reactions were set up in a dedicated
laminar flow hood. For negative controls, nuclease-free
water was substituted for the DNA template. The QIA-
seq 16S/ITS 96-Index Kit (Qiagen) was used to complete
library construction. After cleanup (Ampure XP beads;
Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) and quantification
(Qubit dsDNA broad-range assay; Thermo Scientific), li-
braries were normalized to 2 nM, pooled, denatured, and
diluted to a final concentration of 10 pM. Libraries were
validated on a Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and sequenced
with an Illumina MiSeq (San Diego, CA, USA) using the

ern Reserve University Genomics Core.
Bioinformatic analysis
Demultiplexed fastq files were processed with a Divisive
Amplicon Denoising Algorithm (DADA) 2-based pipe-
line [16] as follows. After dereplication was conducted,
the output, a feature table containing amplicon se-
quence variants (ASVs) and associated abundances, was
generated based on forward reads. Chimeric and shifted
sequences were removed through DADA2, and ASVs
present in the environmental and negative controls
were subtracted from all samples as previously de-
scribed [17, 18] using R (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
For this purpose, ASVs have an advantage over trad-
itional
operating
taxonomic
units
(OTUs)
because
while OTU-based approaches consolidate similar se-
quences into consensus units, the ASV approach treats
exact sequences as unique units, thereby enabling the
removal of contaminating sequences without signifi-
cantly affecting relevant reads [16]. A total of 11,000
ASVs were present in environmental and negative con-
trols; however, > 99% of these ASVs were assigned to
the domain Eukaryota by the DADA2 taxonomy classi-
fier and were thus excluded in downstream analyses.
Sequences were then classified against Silva [19]. After
removing eukaryotic sequences and trimming ASVs
with < 3 total reads, α-diversity indices within group
categories were calculated using phyloseq [20] and plot-
ted using ggpubr (https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/)
in R. The metagenomeSeq R package was used to apply
cumulative sum scaling normalization followed by lin-
ear modeling to identify differentially abundant taxa
across groups after correcting for specimen collection
site (hospital), age, and race [21].
Using the psych R package [22], microbiome–immune
networks were constructed based on pairwise Spearman
correlations between genus-level bacterial relative abun-
dances and either NanoString gene expression or multi-
plex
cytokine
assay
data.
To
enrich
for
putative
biologically relevant associations, only taxa detected in
at least 2 samples were included, and analyses focused
on immune data that were significantly different in
tumor versus healthy control tissue (FDR < 0.05). Fur-
thermore, a filter was applied to select only associations
with Spearman coefficient |r| > 0.2 and p < 0.05. Net-
works were visualized using a default force-directed lay-
out algorithm in igraph [23].
16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR
Total bacterial load was measured by qPCR using the
following universal 16S rRNA gene primers: Uni340F
(ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT) and Uni514R (AT
TACCGCGGCTGCTGGC) [24, 25]. Each 50-μl PCR
reaction contained 4 μl of DNA template or environ-
mental/negative
control,
25 μl
of
QuantiTect
SYBR
Green Master Mix (Qiagen), 1.5 μl each of 10 μM for-
ward and reverse primers, and 18 μl of nuclease-free
water. The following thermal cycling program was per-
formed on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR
System (Foster City, CA, USA): initial 15-min denatur-
ation step at 95 °C; 40 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for
30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR product size was 197
bp, and product purity was verified by melting curve
analysis. Absolute quantification of bacterial DNA was
then performed using standard curves constructed with
Escherichia coli reference genomic DNA (ATCC, Manas-
sas, VA, USA). Although qPCR measures 16S rRNA
gene copies per sample instead of actual bacterial num-
bers or colony-forming units, these values are directly
related, showing considerable correlation [24, 26]. All
standards and controls were run in duplicate; all samples
were run in triplicate.
Immunohistochemistry and image analysis
For a random subset of cases from the Cleveland Clinic
(19 breast cancer cases; 6 prophylactic mastectomy
cases; 5 reduction mammoplasty cases), corresponding
archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was
sectioned at 5 μm. The immunohistochemistry double
stain was completed using a DISCOVERY ULTRA auto-
mated stainer (Roche). In brief, antigen retrieval was
performed using a tris/borate/EDTA buffer (DISCOV-
ERY CC1; Roche #950-500), pH 8.0 to 8.5, for 64 min at
95 °C. Slides were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of
anti-FOXP3 antibody (clone 236A/E7; Abcam, Cam-
bridge, UK) for 40 min at 37 °C. FOXP3 was visualized
using the OmniMap anti-mouse HRP secondary anti-
body (Roche #760-4310) and the ChromoMap DAB de-
tection kit (Roche #760-159). Slides were then double-
labeled with a pre-diluted anti-CD8 antibody solution
(clone SP57; Roche #790-4460) for 40 min at 37 °C. CD8
was visualized using UltraMap anti-rabbit AP (Roche
#760-4314) and the DISCOVERY Red AP detection kit
(Roche #760-228). Lastly, the slides were counterstained
with hematoxylin and bluing.
Immunostained slides were scanned with an Aperio
AT2 automated slide scanner (Leica Biosystems, Wet-
zlar, Germany). The resulting SVS image files were
viewed and manually annotated by a pathologist using
Aperio ImageScope software 12.3.3 (Leica Biosystems) to
delineate tumor regions. Subsequently, images were ana-
lyzed using CaloPix software (TRIBVN Healthcare, Paris,
France) with the Tissue Recognition 4.0.0 and Cell Rec-
ognition 4.1.0 macros as follows. Using a selection of
pathologist-annotated images, the machine-learning soft-
ware was trained to create a decision model based on
color,
texture,
and
edge
criteria
on

deconvolved channels DAB and eosin that assigned a
probability of belonging to the “tumor,” “stroma,” or
“background” classes to each image pixel. Each pixel was
then classified with the label scoring the highest prob-
ability. Similarly, a machine-learning decision model
based on color, texture, and edge criteria was created to
assign a probability of belonging to the “cell” class to
each image pixel. The maxima of the resulting probabil-
ity map generated a point centered on each cell, and de-
tected cells were classified into CD8+ or FOXP3+ cells
using the point neighborhood on the color-deconvolved
channels DAB and eosin. Cell densities were quantified
in the normal breast and intratumoral compartments
using CaloPix as previously described [27].
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.4.3 (San
Diego, CA, USA) and R v4.0.2. Statistical tests were
based on two-sided comparisons with significance set at
p < 0.05 unless otherwise specified. A sample size of ≥
200 patients with breast cancer was chosen to enable the
assessment of up to 20 clinical variables using multivari-
able regression by the rule of 10 [28]. To compare pa-
tient characteristics, the Kruskal–Wallis test was used
for continuous data and Fisher’s exact test for categor-
ical data. Pairwise bacterial α-diversity comparisons were
made using one-way ANOVA. White’s t or Kruskal–
Wallis H-tests with Benjamini–Hochberg FDR correc-
tion for multiple comparisons were conducted to iden-
tify
differentially
abundant
bacterial
taxa
when
stratifying by clinical variables. When evaluating differ-
ential abundance based on tumor-specific variables,
FDR-corrected values < 0.1 were considered significant
in order to avoid overlooking important taxa with vari-
able presence [13, 29, 30]. Comparisons of total bacterial
load and of immune cell densities were performed using
the Mann–Whitney test or Kruskal–Wallis test with
posthoc Dunn test. Cytokine multiplex assay data were
analyzed using two-way ANOVA with posthoc Tukey
test. Finally, Spearman rank-order correlation was used
to evaluate associations between genus-level bacterial
relative abundances and immune cell type scores (esti-
mated abundances).
Results
Patient characteristics
Our study included fresh-frozen breast specimens from
221 patients with breast cancer and 87 patients without
breast cancer. Of the patients without breast cancer, 18
were categorized as being at high risk for breast cancer
based on genetic predisposition or patient history; speci-
mens from these patients were nonetheless verified as
histologically free of malignant cells by a pathologist. Pa-
tient demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics
are shown in Table 1. Since significant differences in age
and race were present among patient groups, these vari-
ables, along with specimen collection site (hospital),
were treated as confounders (covariates) in subsequent
statistical analyses. For the 66 patients recruited at the
Cleveland
Clinic,
additional
information
on
known
breast cancer risk factors and oral antibiotic use was
available, which showed no significant differences among
the patient groups aside from breast cancer family his-
tory (Table 2).
Breast tumor tissue exhibits distinct microbiome
composition
Since the breast tissue microbiome has a relatively low
biomass, we took extensive precautions to minimize the
potential impact of bacterial contaminants as described
in the “Methods” section, including collecting and ana-
lyzing multiple environmental and negative controls
alongside the tissue samples [15]. Furthermore, amplicon
sequence variants detected in the environmental and
negative controls were computationally removed from
subsequent analyses (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Abso-
lute quantification of total bacterial load using qPCR
with universal 16S rRNA gene primers revealed signifi-
cantly greater bacterial abundance in all breast tissue
types versus environmental and negative controls (Add-
itional file 1: Figure S2a). Moreover, the total bacterial
load was similar across tissue types (Additional file 1:
Figure S2b) and, as expected, was several orders of mag-
nitude lower in comparison to that found in high-
biomass sites such as the gut and stool [25, 31, 32].
To quantify overall differences in breast microbial di-
versity between tissue types, we applied two measures of
α-diversity, defined as within-group taxonomic richness
and evenness, and found that tumor tissue exhibited sig-
nificantly decreased α-diversity compared to tumor adja-
cent
normal
or
healthy
control
tissue
(Fig.
1a).
Interestingly, high-risk tissue also demonstrated a trend
toward reduced α-diversity, particularly in comparison
to tumor adjacent normal tissue. We next sought to
characterize breast microbial differences at various taxo-
nomic levels. In all tissue types, the top bacterial phylum
was Proteobacteria, with either Firmicutes or Actinobac-
teria being the next most abundant (Fig. 1b). Differences
between tissue types were more apparent at lower taxo-
nomic levels: for example, compared to other tissues,
tumor tissue contained a much higher percentage of the
families Pseudomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae (Fig.
1c). At the genus level, Pseudomonas constituted a
greater proportion of the breast microbiome in tumor
versus other tissues, and Proteus, the second most abun-
dant genus in tumor tissue, was largely absent from
non-tumor tissues (Fig. 1d). Porphyromonas and Azomo-
nas also had a higher abundance in tumor compared

with other tissues. Conversely, Propionibacterium and
Staphylococcus were prominent constituents of healthy
control, high-risk, and tumor adjacent normal tissues
but were scarce in tumor tissue. Healthy control tissue
was further characterized by the marked presence of Ste-
notrophomonas and Caulobacter, genera that were not
detected above the 3% abundance threshold in other
tissues.
Subsequently, we identified 48 bacterial genera that
were differentially abundant after stratifying by tissue
type
and
adjusting
for
known
confounders
and
microbiome-influencing factors (patient age, race, hos-
pital) [9, 33, 34]. Benign tissue samples (healthy control,
high-risk) displayed similar microbiome composition
and were characterized by greater mean relative abun-
dances of 11 genera (Propionibacterium, Finegoldia,
Granulicatella, Streptococcus, Anaerococcus, Ruminococ-
caceae UCG-002, Corynebacterium 1, Alicyclobacillus,
Odoribacter,
Lactococcus,
Esherichica/Shigella)
com-
pared to cancer-associated samples (tumor, tumor adja-
cent normal) (Fig. 2a, Additional file 2: Table S1).
Nonetheless, there were subtle differences between the
microbial profiles of healthy control and high-risk tis-
sues, including certain genera that were present in
healthy control yet absent from high-risk samples (e.g.,
Vibrionimonas, Amphibacillus) and vice versa. Of the
genera present in both types of cancer-associated tissue,
the majority (17/22) were enriched in tumor adjacent
normal versus tumor tissue, emphasizing that the micro-
biome of breast tumors is distinct not only from that of
healthy control tissue, but also from that of adjacent
normal tissue.

Multiple bacterial genera are significantly associated with
prognostic breast tumor features
While previous studies have described associations be-
tween specific breast microbial taxa and prognostic
breast cancer features such as stage [9], histologic grade
[8], receptor status [4, 7, 9, 13, 35], and lymphovascular
invasion [4], none has examined these associations to-
gether in the same study. Our comparatively large sam-
ple size enabled us to use multivariate regression to
identify bacterial genera with statistically different abun-
dances when stratifying by cancer stage, grade, histologic
subtype, receptor status, lymphovascular invasion, or
lymph node status and adjusting for patient age, race,
and hospital. In particular, Porphyromonas, Lacibacter,
Ezakiella, and Fusobacterium were more abundant in
higher versus lower stage tumors, and 13 genera were
present only in stage 3 tumors (Fig. 2b, Additional file 2:
Table S1). Similarly, multiple genera were significantly
associated with histologic grade, with a number of gen-
era present only in grade 1 tumors (Fig. 2c, Additional
file 2: Table S1). Distinct microbial profiles also corre-
lated with each histologic tumor subtype: for instance,
invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) was characterized by
the presence of Tepidiphilus, Alkanindiges, and Stenotro-
phomonas, while invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) sam-
ples
contained
Peptostreptococcus,
Micromonospora,
Faecalibacterium, and Stenotrophomonas (Fig. 2d, Add-
itional file 2: Table S1).
Upon stratifying samples by tumor receptor status, we
noted that estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors consist-
ently had lower abundances of 7 genera (Alkanindiges,
Micrococcus, Caulobacter, Proteus, Brevibacillus, Kocuria,
Parasediminibacterium) compared to ER-negative tumors
(Fig. 3a). In contrast, 6 genera (Pelomonas, Ralstonia,
Oblitimonas, Lactobacillus, Methylophilus, Achromobac-
ter) showed associations with progesterone receptor (PR)-
positive status (Fig. 3b). Human epidermal growth factor 2
(HER2)-positive tumors had significantly higher abun-
dances
of
7
genera
(Cloacibacterium,
PRD01a011B,
Alloprevotella, Stakelama, Filibacter, Blastomonas, Anae-
rostipes) compared to HER2-negative tumors (Fig. 3c).
Meanwhile, 6 of 7 genera that were relatively decreased in
ER-positive tumors, along with the genus Azomonas, were
enriched in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumors
(Fig. 3d). We also identified taxonomic associations with
markers of tumor metastatic potential. Lymphovascular
invasion and node-positive status correlated with reduced
abundance of Oblitimonas (Fig. 3e, f). Lymphovascular in-
vasion further associated positively with Lactobacillus and
negatively with Alkanindiges, while node-positive status
associated positively with Acinetobacter and Bacteroides
and negatively with Achromobacter. Collectively, these
findings of shared as well as distinct bacterial profiles asso-
ciated with prognostic breast tumor features suggest that
breast microbiome–tumor interactions are complex and
likely involve multiple factors.

measured the expression of 579 immune-related genes
in 443 breast tissue samples (196 tumor, 175 tumor ad-
jacent normal, 17 high-risk, 55 healthy control) using
NanoString. We applied an unsupervised learning algo-
rithm to the most differentially expressed genes in
tumor versus healthy control tissue (Additional file 3:
Table S2) to separate samples into 3 clusters. Cluster 1
contained 91% (179/196) of total tumor samples, and
95% of samples in this cluster were tumor tissue (Fig. 4a).
In contrast, tumor adjacent normal, high-risk, and
healthy control samples were distributed between clus-
ters 2 and 3. Gene set analysis demonstrated that tumor
tissue also clustered separately from tumor adjacent nor-
mal and high-risk tissues based on cellular pathway al-
terations relative to healthy control tissue (Fig. 4b).
Interestingly, the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling path-
way, best known for its microbial sensing role [36], was
one of the top 10 most altered pathways in tumor tissue,
with significant downregulation of TLR4 and upregula-
tion of MYD88, IRAK1, and other downstream genes
compared to healthy control tissue (Additional file 1:
Figure S3).
The NanoString gene panel further allowed us to esti-
mate tissue immune cell abundance using cell type-
specific gene signatures [37]. While similar numbers of
CD45+ cells were present in all tissue types, total T-cells,
CD8+ T-cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and neutrophils
were enriched in tumor versus tumor adjacent normal,
high-risk, and healthy control tissues (Fig. 4c). Conversely,
dendritic cells and macrophages were decreased in tumor
relative to non-malignant tissues. We also evaluated tissue
immune infiltrates using duplex immunohistochemistry,
which showed much greater densities of CD8+ and
FOXP3+ cells in tumor compared to high-risk and healthy
control tissues, concordant with the NanoString-based cell
abundance estimates (Additional file 1: Figure S4a, b).
When assessing functional immune status via a 65-plex
cytokine assay, we detected significantly elevated expres-
sion of many inflammation-associated cytokines, including
VEGF-A, IP-10, and IL-1RA, in tumor compared to non-
tumor breast tissues (Fig. 4d).
We then employed network analysis to identify associ-
ations between the breast microbiome and immune-
related gene expression or cytokine concentrations. Our

analyses focused on genes and cytokines that were dif-
ferentially expressed in tumors (Fig. 4a, d). In total, 38
associations between 15 bacterial genera and 34 immune
features (17 immune-related genes, 17 cytokines) were
revealed in breast tumor tissue (Fig. 5). Breast tumor
microbiome–immune networks
consisted largely
of
isolated modules with bacterial nodes more likely to
be connected to multiple immune nodes than vice
versa; this network structure was present in tumor
adjacent normal tissue as well (Additional file 1:
Figure
S5).
In
contrast,
microbiome–immune
net-
works in healthy control and high-risk breast tissues,
while also organized around bacterial rather than im-
mune nodes, contained modules that tended to be
larger and more interconnected (Fig. 5, Additional file 1:
Figure S5).

Within otherwise sparse tumor networks, 5 of the 15
bacterial genera had putative interactions with 2 or more
immune features in the same network (Fig. 5). Of these
5 genera, 3 (Methylibium, Pelomonas, Propionibacter-
ium) were identified as nodes in both microbiome–im-
mune
gene
and
microbiome–cytokine
networks,
highlighting them as top candidates for potentially influ-
encing the intratumoral immune milieu. Atopostipes and
Cloacibacterium were also present as nodes in both
tumor networks, though they formed fewer connections
with immune features. Meanwhile, major bacterial hubs
in benign tissue networks, including Anaerococcus, Cau-
lobacter, and Streptococcus, were notably missing from
cancer-associated tissue networks (Fig. 5, Additional file
1: Figure S5). The genus Methylibium, a prominent node
in healthy control networks, exhibited much lower con-
nectivity in tumor networks.
At the pathway level, while several genes involved in
TLR signaling (TLR3, TLR4, IRAK1) [36] co-varied posi-
tively with Methylibium and Enhydrobacter in healthy
control networks, these associations were not identified
in tumor networks (Fig. 5a). However, effector molecules
produced downstream of TLR activation (Additional file
1: Figure S3), such as IP-10, MIP-1B, and RANTES, were
significantly associated with Propionibacterium and Rey-
ranella in tumor tissue (Fig. 5b). Multiple genes related
to T-cell activation and differentiation (e.g., CD6, DPP4,
ICOS, IFNGR1, NFATC2, SH2D1A, TBX21) [38], as well
as T-cell estimated abundances, also correlated positively
or negatively with bacterial genera in the breast (Fig. 5,
Additional file 1: Figures S4c, S5). For instance, Strepto-
coccus associated positively with CD6, LAG3, SH2D1A,
and TIGIT expression and with T-cell abundance in
healthy control tissue. In both healthy control and tumor
tissues, Acinetobacter correlated positively with CD8+ T-
cell abundance. In tumor tissue, Methylibium demon-
strated significant negative correlations with ICOS and
TBX21 expression and with T-cell abundance. Finally,
significant associations existed between immune features
with strong ties to breast carcinogenesis and specific mi-
crobial taxa found in tumors (Fig. 5): for example, the
oncogene
TRAF4
[39]
co-varied
negatively
with
Staphylococcus, and the proangiogenic factor VEGF-A
[40] co-varied positively with Pelomonas and negatively
with Bradyrhizobium. PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB, markers
of poor prognosis in breast cancer [41], both co-varied
negatively with Propionibacterium. Taken together, these
results provide early evidence for potential tissue micro-
biome–immune interactions in breast cancer.
Discussion
Only recently has the breast microbiome come to light,
and despite data highlighting microbial differences in tis-
sue from patients with versus without breast cancer [4–
9, 35, 42], the role of tissue-resident bacteria in breast
carcinogenesis remains unclear. Our results showed that
multiple bacterial taxa correlate strongly with prognostic
clinicopathologic features in breast cancer and that some
of these taxa exhibit significant associations with immu-
nomodulatory genes, immune cell infiltrates, and soluble
factors, providing a putative basis for how microbial–im-
mune crosstalk may influence the tumor microenviron-
ment. Although this is the first study to identify
relationships between specific breast microbial taxa and
local immunity, our findings are consistent with prior
work in colorectal and pancreatic cancer demonstrating
that intratumoral bacteria can alter regional immune cell
activation and recruitment, thereby affecting tumor
development and progression [43, 44].
Numerous potential biological pathways exist through
which the breast microbiota may modulate immune
function and thus affect tumorigenesis. Decreased mi-
crobial diversity (Fig. 1a) or loss of keystone taxa (Fig.
2a) in breast tumors could disrupt homeostatic micro-
biome–immune interactions (Fig. 5), leading to immune
dysregulation and carcinogenesis [2, 44]. Moreover, the
low
interconnectivity
of
tumor
microbial–immune
networks may reduce robustness and allow small pertur-
bations to trigger oncogenic inflammation [2]. Connec-
tions
between
specific
bacterial
taxa
and
immune
features may further contribute to breast cancer patho-
genesis. For instance, we found that Propionibacterium,
which includes common commensal species as well as
opportunistic pathogens [45], was depleted in breast tu-
mors (Figs. 1d and 2a); it was also positively associated
with several genes related to T-cell activation and nega-
tively associated with oncogenic growth factors (Fig. 5),
suggesting that loss of this genus could promote tumor
growth by downregulating adaptive antitumor responses
and generating a pro-tumorigenic environment. In a
similar fashion, Staphylococcus, another genus with re-
duced abundance in tumors, co-varied negatively with
the expression of the known oncogene TRAF4 (Fig. 5a).
Streptococcus likewise demonstrated positive correlations
with multiple T-cell activation genes, yet showed de-
creased abundance in cancer-associated samples. We
postulate that deficient T-cell activation due to missing
microbe-associated signals could contribute to the his-
torically poor T-cell responses observed in breast cancer,
despite the fact that we and others have noted increased
lymphocyte infiltration in breast tumors compared with
healthy breast tissue (Fig. 4c, Additional file 1: Figure
S4b) [46, 47].
Additionally, we observed perturbations in the expres-
sion of TLR cascade members, which are canonically in-
volved in microbial recognition (Additional file 1: Figure
S3). Concurrent downregulation of several TLR genes
and upregulation of downstream genes such as MYD88

in breast tumor versus non-tumor tissues may signify
negative regulatory feedback subsequent to stimulation
by tumor-associated microbial products [36]. While we
did not pinpoint significant associations between TLR
pathway genes and specific bacteria taxa in tumors, we
identified mixed relationships between various genera
and TLR-induced effector molecules (Fig. 5b). Notably, a
previous small study showed similar decreased expres-
sion of TLR genes in conjunction with reduced bacterial
load in ER+ breast tumors compared to healthy control
tissue [48], while prior analysis of the pancreatic tumor
microbiome
implicated
selective
TLR
activation
in
microbiota-induced immunosuppression and oncogen-
esis [49], underscoring this pathway’s central role as a
nexus between the microbiota, host immunity, and
tumorigenesis. Further work is needed to evaluate pre-
cisely how microbe-associated immune alterations im-
pact breast carcinogenesis and progression.
Aside from directly influencing host immune re-
sponses, the breast microbiome may produce metabo-
lites that affect cancer and immune cells. Although an
agnostic comprehensive metabolomic survey was outside
the scope of this study, many bacterial genera that we
identified are known to generate bioactive compounds.
For example, species of the Streptococcus genus, which
was present at much higher abundance in tissue from
patients without breast cancer (Fig. 2a), synthesize ca-
daverine, a lysine derivative that inhibits breast tumor
invasion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition [14,
50]. Odoribacter, which was present only in non-tumor
tissues, includes species known to mediate antitumor
activity
through
production
of
butyrate,
an
anti-
inflammatory and tumoristatic short-chain fatty acid [14,
51]. In addition, microbiota-derived bile acids accumu-
late in breast tumors and correlate with decreased prolif-
eration [52], presenting a compelling avenue for future
exploration in relation to the breast microbiome.
This study is the most extensive to date using fresh-
frozen surgical specimens to compare the breast micro-
biome in patients with versus without breast cancer [53].
For microbiome studies, particularly in low-biomass tis-
sues, fresh-frozen samples are superior to formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples because the latter
suffer from DNA degradation and greater risk of micro-
bial contamination during formalin fixation and archival
storage [13, 54]. Interestingly, while studies using fresh-
frozen breast samples have found reduced or similar
bacterial α-diversity in tumor versus non-tumor tissues
(Fig. 1a) [4, 8, 9, 55], recent work based on FFPE sam-
ples showed the opposite trend [13]. Our large sample
size provided sufficient power to examine microbial as-
sociations with multiple covariates, including histologic
subtype and node-positive status (never previously inves-
tigated), and detect taxa-level differences in relative
abundances even after correcting for multiple compari-
sons. Unlike previous studies, we performed the add-
itional step of adjusting our comparisons for known
confounders (e.g., age, race) that were significantly dif-
ferent between patients with and without cancer, de-
creasing the false positive rate. Due to the challenges of
working with low-biomass tissue such as the breast [15],
we implemented numerous other measures to exclude
false positives (contaminants), including (1) working
with UV-irradiated pipettes and disposables in a dedi-
cated laminar flow hood and (2) procuring operating
room controls from each institution from which we re-
quested tissue and computationally removing ASVs
found in these controls, or in DNA extraction and li-
brary preparation negative controls, from all samples
(Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Consistent with previous reports [13, 42, 55], we found
that the dominant bacterial phylum in breast tissues was
Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes and Actinobac-
teria (Fig. 1b). We also measured lower abundance of
Enterobacteriaceae and higher abundances of Coryne-
bacterium, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus in breast tis-
sue from healthy patients compared to those with cancer
(Figs. 1c and 2a), in accordance with prior work [5].
However, the same study describes a positive association
between Staphylococcus and adjacent normal versus
healthy control tissue [5], whereas we note the opposite
relationship. Another group observed that the abun-
dance of Alkanindiges correlated with ER−tumors [13],
which agrees with our findings (Fig. 3a). Although we
identified other bacterial profiles corresponding with
breast tumor receptor status (Fig. 3a–d), these profiles
were distinct from though not contradictory to those de-
scribed previously [4, 7, 9, 13, 35]. Overall, it remains
difficult to directly compare breast microbiome data
from individual studies for myriad reasons, including dif-
ferences in tissue source (fresh-frozen vs FFPE, surgery
vs biopsy, geography), experimental protocols (tissue
collection, DNA extraction, library preparation, sequen-
cing), bioinformatic pipelines, and statistical methods
that influence results [33]. Ideally, a standardized proto-
col for breast microbiome studies should be developed
and universally adopted. Future work should also inves-
tigate associations between the breast microbiome and
other clinical factors known to correlate with breast can-
cer risk, including patient body mass index and race [9],
to determine whether these factors may additionally
influence breast microbial composition.
Like other cross-sectional patient-based microbiome
studies, our findings are limited by the inability to deter-
mine causality. For instance, the negative relationship
between Propionibacterium and IP-10 (Fig. 5b) could in-
dicate that the microbe inhibits cytokine production, the
cytokine hinders microbe growth, or both. We intended
Tzeng et al. Genome Medicine           (2021) 13:60 
Page 14 of 17
instead to provide detailed characterization of breast mi-
crobial and immune signatures that co-varied and corre-
lated with clinicopathologic data as a springboard for
future preclinical and clinical work. Even if certain mi-
crobial patterns result from, rather than drive, pro- or
anti-tumorigenic immune alterations, this knowledge
could potentially be applied as a biomarker for breast
cancer susceptibility or prognosis. In this context, our
identification of subtle microbial differences between
histologically normal breast tissues from patients at nor-
mal versus high risk for breast cancer (Fig. 2a) merits
replication in larger studies. The high-risk patient group,
consisting of individuals with well-documented breast
cancer risk factors who were nonetheless histologically
cancer-free at the time of the study, represents particu-
larly fertile ground for future investigation: correlating
differences between healthy control and high-risk tissues
with longitudinal outcomes (e.g., cancer development)
could increase our understanding of factors associated
with cancer initiation and facilitate the development of
better approaches for cancer detection and prevention.
Our results also encourage further examination of
routes through which microbes may colonize the breast
tissue, including translocation from the gut and passage
via the nipple. Specifically, dendritic cells have been
shown to carry live commensal bacteria and may facili-
tate bacterial transport from the gut lumen to the breast,
especially during pregnancy and lactation [56, 57]. Fur-
ther supporting the existence of a gut–breast axis are
observations that probiotic Lactobacillus strains can be
found in the mammary gland after oral ingestion [58]
and that dietary changes can influence breast micro-
biome profiles [59]. Meanwhile, skin and oral bacteria
may travel through nipple–areolar orifices to populate
the breast tissue, with the latter contacting the nipple
during breastfeeding or sexual activity [6]. Although
some compositional overlap is present, previous work
indicates that the breast microbiome is distinct from
that of the gut, oral cavity, and overlying skin, suggesting
that environmental factors such as pH, available nutri-
ents, and oxygen levels may select for certain dominant
taxa following initial colonization [4, 6, 42, 53]. Add-
itional preclinical and clinical studies that concurrently
characterize the microbiome at multiple sites in the
same individuals are essential for clarifying these poten-
tial bacterial entry routes and may pave the way for
breast microbial manipulation as a potential therapeutic
modality or adjunct.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we provide evidence supporting a novel
role for local microbiome–immune crosstalk in breast
cancer and delineate breast microbial profiles associated
with multiple prognostic clinical variables. This work
sets the stage for further studies assessing causative
mechanisms whereby microbial–immune interactions
influence breast cancer development and progression.
As our understanding of the breast microbiome in-
creases, it may become possible to use diet [59], probio-
tics [60], selective antibiotics [49], or fecal microbiota
transplant [2, 61] as well as topical, injected, or surgically
applied agents to establish a more anti-tumorigenic
breast microbiome to treat or, better yet, prevent breast
cancer.
