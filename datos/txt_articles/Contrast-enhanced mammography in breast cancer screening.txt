Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is a promising vascular-based breast imaging technique with high 
diagnostic performance in detecting breast cancer. Dual-energy acquisition using low and high energy x-ray 
spectra following intravenous iodinated contrast injection provides both anatomic and functional information in 
the same examination. The low-energy images are equivalent to standard digital mammography and the post- 
processed recombined images depict enhancement analogous to contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI). Thus, CEM has the potential to detect abnormal morphologic features as well as neovascularity 
associated with breast cancer. Since its emergence in 2011, CEM has consistently demonstrated superior per­
formance compared with standard mammography and mammography plus ultrasound, particularly in women 
with dense breasts, with high sensitivity approaching that of MRI, supporting its use as a cost-effective diagnostic 
and screening tool. CEM has been primarily used in the diagnostic setting to evaluate patients with screening 
abnormalities or with symptomatic breasts, to perform preoperative staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer, 
and to evaluate response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. More recently, CEM has been performed to screen 
women who have an intermediate to high lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. In addition to its high 
diagnostic performance, CEM is less expensive and more accessible than MRI and potentially better tolerated by 
patients. Minor drawbacks to CEM include a slightly increased radiation dose compared with standard 
mammography and a low risk for contrast allergy reaction. The aim of this study is to review the background, 
current literature, and future applications of CEM in breast cancer screening.   
1. Introduction 
Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is a novel vascular-based 
breast imaging technique which, like breast magnetic resonance imag­
ing (MRI), utilizes contrast media to depict neovascularity. Angiogen­
esis, which drives breast cancer, recruits blood vessels that are more 
permeable to contrast, resulting in enhancement on imaging, sometimes 
before a discrete mass can be detected. A CEM study uses iodinated 
contrast media and is comprised of paired enhanced and unenhanced 
images for each of the four standard mammographic views and depicts 
both anatomic and functional changes in the breast. 
Mammography is a morphology-based modality limited by the 
masking effect of dense tissue, which can obscure an underlying cancer. 
Early studies in film screen mammography show that its sensitivity de­
creases as breast density increases, to as low as 62.9% in women with 
extremely dense breasts [1,2]. In comparison, MRI is the most sensitive 
modality for detecting breast cancer, with a sensitivity of 100% when 
screening women at average and high risk for breast cancer [3,4]. Due to 
its high cost and limited availability, however, MRI is reserved for 
screening women at a greater than 20% lifetime risk for developing 
breast cancer. 
Since its emergence a decade ago, CEM has consistently demon­
strated superior performance to standard mammography, with a high 
sensitivity approaching that of MRI [5-8]. Potential advantages of CEM 
over MRI include lower costs, increased availability, and faster acqui­
sition. In a 2017 study analyzing the potential cost savings of CEM, the 
cost of screening MRI in the United States was estimated to be four times 
that of CEM based on Medicare rates ($775 for MRI vs $196 for CEM) 
[9]. CEM can be a one-stop shop exam since both the anatomic and 
physiologic exams can be performed in a single appointment. Further­
more, CEM can be performed in patients who have contraindications to 
MRI. Thus, CEM may be a safe and affordable vascular-based alternative

to MRI. 
This review will encompass the fundamentals of CEM technique, 
interpretation, and clinical performance in breast cancer screening. 
2. Imaging technique 
CEM employs a dual energy technique that capitalizes on the dif­
ference in X-ray attenuation between breast tissue and iodine when low 
and high energy spectra are used. CEM examinations are comprised of 
paired low-energy and high-energy images obtained from utilizing X-ray 
energies below and above iodine’s k-edge (33 keV), respectively. From 
these paired exposures acquired in the same compression, a recombined 
image is generated using a post-processing algorithm that isolates the 
iodine concentration only. 
Commercially available CEM systems are currently offered by four 
vendors (Table 1). Existing mammography units may be upgraded with 
CEM systems at a lower cost [9]. 
Before imaging, an intravenous line is placed by either a nurse or 
technologist. A non-ionic low-osmolar iodinated contrast agent is then 
injected with the breast out of compression to facilitate greatest blood 
flow. Iodine concentration varies from 300 mg/mL to 370 mg/mL. 
Although standardized imaging parameters for CEM have not yet been 
published, it is generally accepted to administer a volume of 1.5 ml/kg 
body weight (maximum of 150 ml) at a rate of 2–3 ml/sec preferably 
using a power injector. Fig. 1 illustrates a CEM imaging acquisition 
sequence. Around 2–3 min after contrast is injected, paired low-energy 
and high-energy images are acquired with the breast in compression for 
the four standard craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique views. Addi­
tional views may be performed if they can be obtained within 10 min of 
injection. Recombined images for each acquired view are generated 
using post-processing. 
CEM does not provide dynamic contrast enhancement kinetics. 
However, a few recent studies that included a delayed acquisition ob­
tained around 6–8 min after contrast injection demonstrated an 
improvement in CEM specificity from 83% to 89% among women un­
dergoing CEM to assess response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [10] and 
from 80% to 92% among women with dense breasts and suspicious mass 
lesions [11]. 
3. Interpretation 
Since a CEM examination includes low-energy and recombined im­
ages, a finding may be seen on the low-energy images only, on the 
recombined images only, or on both. The low-energy images are anal­
ogous to a standard digital mammogram and interpreted in an identical 
fashion using the mammogram lexicon outlined in the 2013 American 
College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI- 
RADS) atlas [12]. The recombined images are interpreted to identify any 
abnormal enhancement that may or may not have a correlate on the low- 
energy images. A recently published supplement to the 2013 ACR BI-

RADS atlas specific for CEM findings is summarized in Table 2 [13]. Two 
new BI-RADS terms introduced in the CEM lexicon include enhancing 
asymmetry and lesion conspicuity. An enhancing asymmetry is a one-view 
finding seen either on the recombined images only or on both the 
recombined and low-energy images. Lesion conspicuity refers to the 
degree of lesion enhancement relative to background parenchymal 
enhancement (BPE). This CEM BI-RADS lexicon will ensure reporting 
standardization and consistency that is essential for the implementation 
of CEM as a screening tool on a larger scale. 
As with MRI, categories for both breast density and BPE should also 
be reported when interpreting a CEM study. BPE describes the physio­
logic enhancement of normal breast tissue after intravenous contrast 
administration. Sogani et al demonstrated a substantial intra-reader 
agreement for BPE assessment on CEM and MRI [14]. Of note, BPE 
has been shown to significantly increase with higher breast density and 
younger patient age, although no association has been shown between 
BPE and the last menstrual period in pre-menopausal women, suggesting 
that CEM need not be timed with the menstrual cycle [15-17]. In another 
study, Sorin et al found that BPE on CEM was significantly predictive of 
breast cancer (odds ratio (OR) of 2.24), particularly in the screening 
population (OR of 6.27). 
Since CEM provides anatomic and vascular information in the same 
examination, the final assessment should be based on the interpretation 
of both low-energy and recombined images. A recent meta-analysis in­
clusive of 60 studies found that the pooled sensitivity and specificity of 
CEM was significantly improved when interpreting both low-energy and 
recombined images compared with recombined images alone [18]. Any 
suspicious finding seen only on the low-energy and/or recombined im­
ages warrants further evaluation with imaging or biopsy. Like MRI, 
malignant calcifications may not enhance, and therefore the lack of 
enhancement should not preclude biopsy of suspicious appearing cal­
cifications on the low-energy images. In two retrospective studies, a 
total of 146 women recalled from screening for calcifications underwent 
CEM prior to biopsy. Five (9.8%) of 51 cancers detected in both studies 
did not enhance (2/22 and 3/27), all of which were ductal carcinoma in 
situ [19,20]. A later retrospective study of 147 women with screen- 
detected calcifications found that 11/65 cancers (17%) demonstrated 
no enhancement on the recombined images, with no difference between 
invasive and in situ disease [21]. Compared with the low-energy images 
only, the addition of the recombined views did not significantly alter 
surgical management for the 65 patients who had cancer. 
Conversely, any abnormal enhancement on the recombined images 
without a low-energy correlate may be further evaluated with ultra­
sound (US) and possibly MRI for additional characterization and iden­
tification of a biopsy target. In a retrospective study of 153 enhancing 
lesions on CEM, the likelihood of malignancy was greater among those 
with a correlate on US, which occurred in 47/153 (31%) enhancing 
lesions [22]. A more recent study similarly found that a CEM lesion was 
4.87 times and 10.5 times more likely to be malignant if a correlate was 
identified on US and MRI, respectively [23]. If a biopsy is performed 
using US or MRI guidance, it is imperative to confirm the biopsy marker 
correlates with the location of the original enhancement on the post- 
procedure mammogram (Fig. 2). 
Until recently, there was not a mechanism for biopsy using CEM 
guidance. Thus, MRI has been performed to further evaluate enhancing 
CEM lesions not identified on the low-energy images or on US (Fig. 3). If 
the MRI shows no suspicious finding, a short-term follow-up CEM may 
not be necessary given the high negative predictive value of MRI. In a 
recent meta-analysis of 7 studies, MRI demonstrated a higher maximum 
pretest probability for ruling out cancer compared with CEM (33% vs 
14%) [24]. Additionally, preliminary data from our institution found 
that of 81 CEM lesions that had a subsequent negative MRI, only one 
(1.2%) cancer was detected at the 6-month interval, suggesting that a 1- 
year follow-up CEM may be sufficient [25]. 
CEM-guided biopsy capability recently became commercially avail­
able and has the potential to streamline the workflow by obviating the 
need to perform MRI when the low-energy images and US are negative. 
In 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approved a GE Healthcare biopsy system (Pristina Serena Bright) which 
enables standard upright stereotactic and tomosynthesis-guided biopsies 
as well as CEM-guided biopsies. Technical success has already been re­
ported with a total biopsy time under 10 min [26]. Alternatively, biopsy 
may also be accomplished using Hologic’s latest software (I-View) to 
localize an enhancing target within a combined 2D CEM and tomosyn­
thesis acquisition and to perform a tomosynthesis-guided biopsy. 
4. Performance in screening 
Women who are at increased risk for developing breast cancer 
benefit from supplemental screening with either US or MRI. MRI is the 
most sensitive screening tool but is currently only recommended for 
women who have a high (greater than 20%) lifetime risk of developing 
breast cancer due to its high cost and limited availability. Women who 
have an intermediate (15–20%) lifetime risk include those with a family 
history of breast cancer, personal history of breast cancer, prior biopsy- 
proven high-risk lesion, and dense breasts. These women have the op­
tion to undergo supplemental screening with US that may detect addi­
tional mammographically occult cancers. Increasing data suggest that 
screening CEM in women with elevated breast cancer risk further

improves the sensitivity and specificity of detecting breast cancer 
compared to digital mammography alone and to mammography plus 
US, with a diagnostic performance approaching that of MRI (Table 3, 
Figs. 4–6) [23,27-31]. 
The first prospective pilot study comparing CEM to MRI as a 
screening tool included 307 women with intermediate and high lifetime 
risk [31]. All patients underwent CEM and MRI and were followed for 2 
years. Three cancers were detected during the first round of screening, of 
which two invasive cancers were seen on both CEM and MRI, one ductal 
carcinoma in situ was seen on MRI only, and none were seen on low- 
energy mammogram. Specificity was comparable between CEM and 
MRI (94.7% and 94.1%, respectively) and no palpable interval cancers 
were detected. 
In a retrospective study of 953 women who underwent CEM and 
concurrent screening US, CEM had a higher sensitivity and specificity of 
97.3% and 40.0% respectively, compared to a sensitivity of 91.9% and

views show an enhancing focal asymmetry at the 9:00 axis in the region of the reduction scar on spot compression tomosynthesis (C). Targeted ultrasound (D) shows 
a corresponding 0.6 cm irregular mass in the 9:00 axis. Ultrasound-guided biopsy yielded benign fat necrosis and foreign body giant cell reaction consistent with prior 
procedure. Biopsy marker corresponds to site of enhancement on the post-biopsy mammogram (E).

enhancing asymmetry at the lumpectomy site extending to the skin on low-energy and recombined mediolateral oblique views (A), including spot compression 
recombined view (B). As no corresponding abnormality was identified on targeted ultrasound, enhancement was probably benign post-treatment change. 
Enhancement resolved on follow-up contrast-enhanced mammography performed at six months (C) and at one year (D), confirming the benign etiology.

specificity of 8.0% with US [27]. None of the 37 cancers detected were 
benign-appearing on CEM whereas 3 cancers were benign-appearing on 
US. The authors concluded that routine screening US following a normal 
CEM study may only result in unnecessary biopsies. 
When used as a screening tool among intermediate-risk women with 
dense breasts, CEM was significantly more sensitive than standard dig­
ital mammography in a retrospective study of 611 women (90.5% vs 
52.4%, p = 0.0008). However, CEM was less specific (76.1% vs 90.5%, 
p = 0.001) [28]. The incremental cancer detection rate for CEM was 
13.1 per 1000 women. Adjunct US further reduced specificity by 
detecting 73 false positives and no additional cancer, again suggesting 
that US may not be necessary after a negative CEM examination. Similar 
results were reported in a subsequent larger retrospective study that 
included 904 women with higher-than-average risk for breast cancer, 
78% of whom had dense breasts, who underwent a baseline screening 
CEM examination [29]. CEM improved the sensitivity of standard 2D 
mammography (87.5% vs 50.0%, p = 0.03) with an incremental cancer 
detection rate of 6.6 per 1000 women. The overall cancer detection rate 
was 15.5 per 1000 women, which is similar to MRI. Follow-up data for 
these patients are currently pending. 
Among a small cohort of 132 women who had elevated risk due to a 
personal history of lobular neoplasia, screening CEM demonstrated a 
sensitivity of 100% in detecting 6 cancers that were all occult on stan­
dard digital mammography [30]. Specificity was 88%. 
A recent retrospective study of 157 patients with intermediate or 
high breast cancer risk who underwent baseline screening CEM found 26 
cancers, of which 12 (46%) were evident on both the low-energy and 
recombined images, 13 (50%) were contrast-only findings, and one (4%) 
was evident on the low-energy images only [23]. Lesions seen on both 
low-energy and recombined images were significantly more likely to be

malignant if the finding was an asymmetry or calcifications (p < 0.001). 
Four of 5 (80%) malignant calcifications had corresponding enhance­
ment while 24/25 (96%) benign calcifications had no enhancement. 
In addition to being potentially more cost-effective and accessible 
than MRI, CEM has other benefits in the screening setting. Women with 
elevated risk for breast cancer who cannot undergo MRI due to claus­
trophobia, metallic implants, or gadolinium-based contrast allergies can 
safely undergo CEM. If given the choice, most patients prefer having 
CEM examination instead of MRI [32,33]. In a study of 49 patients who 
underwent both CEM and MRI, Hobbs et al. found that patients signif­
icantly preferred the overall experience of CEM (p < 0.001) due to faster 
acquisition, less noise, and greater comfort, and reported significantly 
lower rates of anxiety (p = 0.009) [33]. 
5. Limitations 
The main drawbacks of CEM compared to standard mammography 
are workflow issues and the potential for contrast reactions. Since 
contrast is being administered, patients require intravenous placement 
prior to the CEM examination, which may lead to prolonged appoint­
ment times. A physician must also be on site to evaluate and treat any 
potential adverse contrast reaction. Allergic reactions to low-osmolar 
iodinated contrast are infrequent, with rates from 0.2 to 0.7% re­
ported in contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) studies [34].

Severe allergic reactions are rare, occurring in 0.04% of CT studies. In a 
meta-analysis of CEM studies, the pooled reaction rate was similar at 
0.8% [35]. Preliminary data at our institution found that of 2419 pa­
tients who underwent CEM from 2014 to 2021, 23 patients (0.95%) had 
a documented reaction (0.48% of 5235 examinations), of which none 
were severe and most were mild [36]. Although a recent meta-analysis 
showed that higher iodine concentration significantly increased sensi­
tivity of CEM (P = 0.04), specificity was reduced (P < 0.001), and would 
likely lead to more adverse effects [24]. Renal insufficiency is relatively 
uncommon in the healthy population but must be considered in patients 
who may be at increased risk. 
Since at least eight exposures are acquired for a four-view exam, CEM 
has a slightly increased radiation dose compared with standard digital 
mammography, although the dose remains below the regulatory dose 
limit according to the Mammography Quality Standards Act guidelines. 
The estimated dose increase varies between 20% and 80%, as it depends 
on breast thickness, breast density, and vendor [37]. This slightly 
increased radiation dose may be clinically significant among young 
high-risk patients such as BRCA1 gene mutation carriers in whom 
studies have shown enhanced chromosomal radiosensitivity and higher 
breast cancer risk from radiation exposure [38-40]. 
Compared with MRI, CEM has a more limited field of view of the 
posterior breast, chest wall, and axilla. Furthermore, CEM lacks three- 
dimensional and kinetic information provided by dynamic contrast- 
enhanced MRI. 
6. Future directions 
While data are promising for screening CEM, most studies to date 
have been retrospective, single-institution investigations with a small 
number of patients. Further prospective and multicenter trials are 
needed to compare the performance of screening CEM with conven­
tional imaging on a larger scale. The American College of Radiology 
Contrast-Enhanced Mammographic Screening Trial (CMIST) is a pro­
spective multisite study that will compare screening outcomes between 
digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and CEM in intermediate risk women 
with dense breasts. All patients will undergo two screening rounds with 
DBT and CEM with 1 year follow-up. Approximately 2023 participants 
are anticipated, and enrollment is expected to begin at the end of 2022. 
Contrast-enhanced tomosynthesis (CET) is another emerging tech­
nique that has shown promising results in feasibility studies utilizing 
temporal subtraction, dual energy, and photon-counting techniques [41- 
43]. In 2015, a reader study performed of 185 patients with BI-RADS 4 
and 5 lesions concluded that CEM and CET were comparable to MRI, and 
all contrast studies (CEM, CET, MRI) were superior to non-contrast 
studies (standard mammography, DBT) without showing a significant 
advantage of CET over CEM [44]. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to CEM has led to the development 
of computer-aided detection systems designed to characterize breast 
masses as benign or malignant using machine learning algorithms and 
radiomic analysis of morphology and textural features [45,46]. These AI 
models have also showed promise in determining histoprognostic fac­
tors of cancers from CEM, such as invasive disease, hormone receptor 
status, and tumor grade [47,48]. 
7. Conclusion 
Growing literature supports the use of CEM as a screening tool that is 
more sensitive than standard digital mammography in detecting breast 
cancer due to its depiction of both anatomic and vascular tumoral 
changes. CEM is a safe procedure with a low frequency of reported 
allergic reactions which are predominantly mild in severity. Although 
more data are needed to compare the diagnostic performance of CEM to 
MRI in the screening setting, CEM is a promising technique that may be 
an affordable alternative to MRI where MRI is not readily available. 
Larger prospective multisite clinical trials are ongoing to confirm the 
future role of CEM in breast cancer screening.
