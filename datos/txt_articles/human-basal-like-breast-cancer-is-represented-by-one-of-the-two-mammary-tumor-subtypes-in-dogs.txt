Abstract 
Background  About 20% of breast cancers in humans are basal-like, a subtype that is often triple-negative and dif‑
ficult to treat. An effective translational model for basal-like breast cancer is currently lacking and urgently needed. To 
determine whether spontaneous mammary tumors in pet dogs could meet this need, we subtyped canine mammary 
tumors and evaluated the dog–human molecular homology at the subtype level.
Methods  We subtyped 236 canine mammary tumors from 3 studies by applying various subtyping strategies 
on their RNA-seq data. We then performed PAM50 classification with canine tumors alone, as well as with canine 
tumors combined with human breast tumors. We identified feature genes for human BLBC and luminal A subtypes 
via machine learning and used these genes to repeat canine-alone and cross-species tumor classifications. We inves‑
tigated differential gene expression, signature gene set enrichment, expression association, mutational landscape, 
and other features for dog–human subtype comparison.
Results  Our independent genome-wide subtyping consistently identified two molecularly distinct subtypes 
among the canine tumors. One subtype is mostly basal-like and clusters with human BLBC in cross-species PAM50 
and feature gene classifications, while the other subtype does not cluster with any human breast cancer subtype. 
Furthermore, the canine basal-like subtype recaptures key molecular features (e.g., cell cycle gene upregulation, 
TP53 mutation) and gene expression patterns that characterize human BLBC. It is enriched in histological subtypes 
that match human breast cancer, unlike the other canine subtype. However, about 33% of canine basal-like tumors 
are estrogen receptor negative (ER−) and progesterone receptor positive (PR+), which is rare in human breast cancer. 
Further analysis reveals that these ER−PR+ canine tumors harbor additional basal-like features, including upregulation 
of genes of interferon-γ response and of the Wnt-pluripotency pathway. Interestingly, we observed an association 
of PGR expression with gene silencing in all canine tumors and with the expression of T cell exhaustion markers (e.g., 
PDCD1) in ER−PR+ canine tumors.
Conclusions  We identify a canine mammary tumor subtype that molecularly resembles human BLBC overall 
and thus could serve as a vital translational model of this devastating breast cancer subtype. Our study also sheds 
light on the dog–human difference in the mammary tumor histology and the hormonal cycle.

Background
Human breast cancer is heterogeneous, consisting of 
well-established molecularly distinct subtypes [1–10]. 
One of these subtypes is basal-like breast cancer (BLBC; 
human BLBC will be referred to as hBLBC hereafter), 
which makes up roughly 15–20% of human breast can-
cers and has the worst prognosis of all subtypes [1–10]. 
About 70% of hBLBCs are triple negative, expressing 
neither estrogen receptor (ER) nor progesterone recep-
tor (PR) and without HER2 amplification or overexpres-
sion [1–10]. These cancers also tend to have increased 
rates of cell proliferation and metastasis [1–10]. All these 
highlight the need for an effective translational model for 
hBLBC, which is critically missing at present [11–13].
Mammary cancers in pet dogs naturally occur in ani-
mals with an intact immune system [13, 14], overcoming 
many limitations of traditional cancer models such as 
cell lines and genetically modified rodent models. These 
canine cancers more accurately emulate human breast 
cancers in etiology, complexity, heterogeneity, behavior, 
treatment, and outcome [13–16]. They are also common 
in bitches, with an annual incidence rate estimated at 
198 per 100,000 [17], which is comparable to the rate of 
125 per 100,000 for breast cancer in women in the USA 
[18]. Mammary cancer is especially common in bitches 
that are not spayed or are spayed after the second estrus, 
with the risk of malignant tumor development expected 
at 26% [17]. Thus, canine mammary tumors have the 
potential to serve as a much-needed translational model 
of hBLBC, effectively bridging a current gap between 
preclinical models and human clinical trials to accelerate 
bench-to-bedside translation.
The effective use of the canine model is, however, com-
plicated by issues including the dog–human hormonal 
cycle difference, e.g., the luteal phase lasts ~ 14 days for 
humans but ~ 2  months for dogs. Another difference is 
histology. About 50% of canine mammary tumors are 
complex or mixed, with multiple cell lineages (e.g., epi-
thelial and myoepithelial cells) proliferating [14, 19, 20]. 
These histologies (e.g., adenomyoepithelioma) are, how-
ever, are very rare (< 1%) in human breast cancers [14, 21, 
22]. It remains unknown how these differences shape the 
molecular homology and difference between canine and 
human mammary tumors.
The same as human breast cancers, spontaneous 
canine mammary cancers are heterogeneous and con-
sist of distinct subtypes [19, 20]. Thus, subtype-level 
dog–human comparison is needed to evaluate the dog–
human homology. Canine mammary cancers have been 
histopathologically and clinically subtyped, as well as 
molecularly subtyped with immunohistochemical mark-
ers established for human breast cancer (anti-ER, PR, 
HER2, -CK 5/6 and -CK14) [19, 20, 23, 24]. However, to 
our knowledge, canine mammary tumors have not been 
independently subtyped by genome-wide molecular 
studies.
For dog–human comparison, our previous study indi-
cates that one histological subtype, simple carcinoma, 
molecularly resembles hBLBC in cross-species PAM50 
classification with human and canine tumors [14]. 
However, this study is limited by its small sample size. 
Another group has performed PAM50 classification 
on the RNA-seq data recently published for 154 canine 
mammary tumors [25] and reported a higher homol-
ogy between canine and human luminal A tumors than 
between canine and human basal-like tumors [26]. This 
study, however, did not perform cross-species PAM50 
or other classifications to directly compare human and 
canine tumors. Moreover, many of the canine luminal A 
tumors are complex and mixed tumors, histologically dif-
fering from the vast majority of human luminal A tumors 
[14, 21, 22].
To address these discrepancies and deficiencies, we set 
out to independently subtype canine mammary tumors 
using RNA-seq data of 236 tumors [14, 25, 27] and then 
perform dog–human comparison at the subtype level, as 
described below.
Materials and methods
Data collection
Canine RNA-seq data were downloaded from the 
Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database, including data 
of 154 mammary tumors from PRJNA489087 (exclud-
ing 4 metastatic osteosarcomas and fibrosarcomas) [25] 
and of 63 mammary tumors from PRJNA561580 [27]. 
RNA-seq data of 25 mammary tumor samples sequenced 
in house [14] were also included (PRJNA203086 and 
PRJNA912710). Human breast cancer RNA-seq data 
were downloaded from the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) database, and 
the PAM50 classification of these cancers was obtained 
from the cBioportal database [28]. Gene expression 
microarray data of two canine mammary tumor studies

(GSE20685) were downloaded from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) database [29–31] and processed with 
affyPackage [32]. Other information was obtained from 
relevant publications of these studies. Canine genome 
canFam3.1 and gene annotation canFam3 1.99 GTF were 
downloaded from the Ensembl database. Canine genome 
canFam4 (GSD 1.0) and the NCBI RefSeq gene annota-
tion (NCBI RefSeq Curated and Predicted subsets from 
the NCBI Canis lupus familiaris Annotation Release 
106, 2021-01-11) were obtained from the UCSC Genome 
Brower site. Canine mutation data and tumor mutation 
burden (TMB) values from whole exome sequencing 
analysis were obtained from a previous publication [33].
Canine sample collection and RNA‑seq
Fresh-frozen (FF) canine tissues and spontaneous tumors 
were obtained from the canine tissue archive bank at 
Ohio State University, as previously described [34]. Sam-
ples were collected from client-owned dogs that devel-
oped the disease spontaneously, under the guidelines of 
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee for 
use of residual diagnostic specimens and with owner 
informed consent. The case information was provided 
by the tissue bank. The research received the ethical 
approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee.
Cryosectioning of FF tissues, H&E staining, and cry-
omicrodissection was performed as described [34] to 
enrich tumor cells for tumor samples. Genomic DNA 
and RNA were extracted from the dissected tissues using 
the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (cat. no. 80204) from 
QIAGEN (Germantown, MD, USA). Only samples with 
a 260/280 ratio of ~ 2.0 (RNA) and showing no degrada-
tion and other contaminations were subjected to further 
quality control with qRT-PCR analysis with a panel of 
genes as previously described [34, 35]. RNA-seq libraries 
were constructed using KAPA Stranded mRNA- Seq Kit. 
The samples were subjected to 75- or 125-bp paired-end 
sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500 or NextSeq 500 at 
Georgia Genomics Facility.
Canine RNA‑seq data quality control (QC) and processing
Canine RNA-seq data were processed as described [34–
36]. Briefly, RNA-seq read pairs were mapped to the 
canine reference genome canFam3 using HISAT2 (ver-
sion 2.21) [37]. Concordantly (for paired-end RNA-seq 
data only) and uniquely mapped pairs were identified and 
were used to calculate the mapping rate of each sample. 
Such pairs with at least one read with ≥ 1 bp overlapping 
a coding sequence (CDS) region of the canFam3 1.99 
GTF annotation were used to calculate the CDS-target-
ing rate.
Quality control of canine RNA-seq data was performed 
as described [36]. First, MultiQC [38] (version 1.5) was 
used to examine GC content and duplicate level. Base 
quality distribution before and after Trimmomatic trim-
ming was also examined. Second, the distributions of 
per sample read-pair total amount, mapping quality, 
and CDS-targeting rate were examined to identify and 
exclude samples that fail to meet the cutoffs. A total of 6 
canine RNA-seq samples from PRJNA561580 failed the 
QC and were excluded from further analysis (Additional 
file 1: Fig. S1A–E).
For each sample that passed QC measures, Subread 
(version 2.0.0) [39] was used to identify read pairs that 
are uniquely and, for paired-end RNA-seq, concord-
antly mapped to the CDS regions of the canFam3 1.99 
GTF annotation, the sum of which yields raw RNA-seq 
counts. Cufflinks version 2.2.0 [40] was used to calculate 
the FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million 
mapped) value of each gene in each sample, which was 
then converted to TPM (transcript per million). For stud-
ies that combine RNA-seq data from multiple sources, 
comBat [41] was applied to correct batch effect for TPM 
values, and ComBat-seq [42] was used to correct batch 
effect for mapped RNA-seq read count values.
RNA-seq reads were also mapped to the canFam4 
genome using HISAT2 (version 2.21), and the FPKM 
and TPM value of each gene was then calculated using 
Cufflinks version 2.2.0 and the NCBI RefSeq annotation 
described previously.
ER, PR, and HER2 status
Samples with an ESR1 or PGR expression level of 
FPKM ≤1 and FPKM > 1 were classified as ER or PR 
negative and positive, respectively. Samples with an 
ERBB2 expression level of FPKM ≤35 and FPKM > 35 
were classified as HER2 not enriched and enriched, 
respectively.
Canine mammary tumor subtyping
A gene was selected if it has an official gene name associ-
ated with its Ensembl gene ID in the canFam3 1.99 GTF 
annotation and is expressed (with FPKM ≥1 in at least 
one sample across a cohort or study). This yields 13,416 
genes in the discovery set (paired-end RNA-seq data) 
[14, 25] and 13,608 genes in the validation set (single-end 
RNA-seq data) [27] (see Results). The NMF R package 
[43] was then applied on all of these selected genes, as 
well as on the top 5000, 2000, 1000, and 500 most vari-
able genes among them, with 30 runs for the rank deter-
mination. These analyses consistently divided 143 out 
of 179 samples of the discovery set into two subtypes. 
For validation, K-means clustering, consensus cluster-
ing, and hierarchical clustering via R packages stats, 
Page 4 of 18
Watson et al. Breast Cancer Research          (2023) 25:114 
ConsensusClusterPlus, and pvclust, respectively [44–46], 
were used to subtype the 143 samples using the top 10% 
most variable genes. The same process was repeated to 
subtype the samples in the validation set.
PAM50 classification of canine and human tumors
A total of 43 canine homologues of the 50 PAM50 
genes were identified in the canFam3 1.99 annotation 
file. These 43 genes were then used to perform PAM50 
classification with canine samples alone, as well as with 
canine and human combined samples, for RNA-seq stud-
ies [14, 25, 27]. For microarray studies [30, 31], 40 of the 
PAM50 genes were identified based on the probes and 
used to classify canine samples alone and canine-human 
combined samples. The PAM50 subtypes of human 
breast cancer samples were downloaded from the cBio-
portal database or relevant publications. For canine and 
human combined sample PAM50 clustering for RNA-
seq studies, 60 human tumors were randomly sampled 
from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer 
study for each of the luminal A, luminal B, hBLBC, and 
HER2-enriched subtypes. These samples, along with all 
27 human normal-like tumors, were merged with all 143 
subtyped canine tumors for PAM50 classification analy-
sis. The clustering dendrogram was then cut at the mini-
mum number of clusters that maximally separate hBLBC 
tumors from hLumA tumors using the R package den-
dextend [47]. The number of tumors of each canine or 
human subtype in each cluster was counted. If a cluster 
contains the majority of tumors of a human subtype as 
well as the majority of a canine subtype, the human and 
canine subtypes were considered matched. This process 
was repeated 100 times to ensure each human tumor was 
sampled at least once.
Multidimensional scaling on the Euclidean distance 
matrix was performed for each of the 100 random sam-
plings, from which the Mahalanobis distance between 
the centers of any two subtypes was calculated using the 
R package ‘GenAlgo’ v2.2.0 [46].
The above process was repeated with the 49 PAM50 
genes identified in the canFam4 NCBI RefSeq annotation 
described previously.
The above process was repeated for microarray studies 
[29–31], except that only 40 canine homologues of the 50 
PAM50 genes were identified, and 30 tumors per subtype 
were randomly sampled from the human dataset [29].
Differentially expressed (DE) genes and gene set 
enrichment analysis (GSEA)
DESeq2 [48] was used to identify DE genes between 
subtypes or subgroups. Genes with ≥2 fold change in 
read count and the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH)-adjusted 
p ≤0.05 were considered differentially expressed. 
Enriched functions of DE genes were investigated with 
the GSEA [49] and DAVID [50] web tools. Pathway and 
signature gene sets were acquired from previous publica-
tions [34, 35, 51]. Single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA v. 10.1.0) 
was performed using GenePattern [52].
Machine learning for feature gene selection
The analysis was performed using R version 4.2.2 as fol-
lows. First, TCGA human breast cancers and canine 
mammary tumors were combined, and batch effect cor-
rection was applied using Combat [53] on the expression 
values ( log2(TPM + 1)) of the entire gene set. Second, 
with the batch-corrected human breast cancer data, DE 
genes were identified between hBLBC or hLumA and 
another PAM50 subtype with adjusted p ≤0.05 . This 
yielded 8034, 6958, and 4783 DE genes between hBLBC 
and each subtype of hLumA, Luminal B, and HER2-
enriched, respectively, as well as 5843 and 5697 DE genes 
between hLumA and each subtype of luminal B and 
HER2-enriched, respectively. Third, human breast can-
cer samples were divided into an 80% training set, used 
for model development and feature selection, and a 20% 
test set, used for model evaluation. Lastly, Boruta [54] 
(a wrapper built around the random forest classification 
algorithm) was applied on the training set iteratively 50 
times to identify the most relevant genes among each 
DE gene set that separates the two subtypes compared, 
with a frequency cutoff of 50 times. Combining identi-
fied genes from all subtype comparisons yielded 115 fea-
ture genes for hBLBC and 130 feature genes for hLumA. 
These genes were used to classify canine tumor samples 
alone, as well as canine and human combined samples, as 
described in PAM50 classification.
Correlation and other statistical analyses
Genes with FPKM > 1 in at least 10% of the samples of 
a subtype were chosen for ESR1,PGR, or PRLR (encod-
ing the prolactin receptor) correlation analysis. PGR 
was excluded from hBLBC as < 10% of samples have an 
FPKM > 1 . Positively or negatively correlated genes were 
defined as those with BH-adjusted p < 0.05 and correla-
tion coefficient |R| > 0.3 for both Pearson and Spearman 
correlation analysis. The software enrichR [55] was used 
to identify transcription factors targeting each group of 
significantly correlated genes. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests 
were used for statistical comparison between subtypes or 
subgroups.
Results
Canine mammary tumors consist of two distinct subtypes
We first performed nonnegative matrix factorization 
(NMF) [43], a widely used subtyping strategy, to sub-
type 179 canine mammary tumors with paired-end

RNA-seq data (the discovery set), after combining 154 
tumors sequenced by Kim et  al. [25], and 25 tumors 
sequenced by us [14] followed by batch correction. 
NMF subtyping was repeated with all 13,416 genes 
that are expressed in at least one tumor, as well as 
with the top 5000, 2000, 1000, and 500 most variable 
genes among the 13,416 expressed genes. The analysis 
consistently clustered 143 of 179 tumors into two sub-
types (Fig.  1; Additional file  2: Table  S1). To validate 
this, we also subtyped these tumors using other popu-
lar strategies, including K-means, consensus clustering, 
and hierarchical clustering via multiscale bootstrap res-
ampling [44, 45] (Additional file 1: Fig. S2A–C). These 
Fig. 1  Two molecularly distinct subtypes of canine mammary tumors were identified. Heatmap of the row scaled ­log2(TPM) values of 1387 
metagenes from 143 canine mammary tumors (columns), ordered from left to right by subtypes, PAM50 classification, and the ESR1 expression 
level from high to low. The metagenes (rows), identified from the NMF analysis (see Methods), are ordered by hierarchical clustering. Lymph 
invasion is defined as having tumor cells in peritumoral lymphatic vessels and/or regional lymph nodes. Tumor mutation burden (TMB), defined 
as the number of somatic base substitutions and small indels per megabase (Mb) of callable coding sequence, is obtained from a previous 
publication [33]. For ER/PR status, a tumor is considered “negative” or “positive” if its ESR1/PGR has a FPKM value of ≤ 1 or > 1, respectively. For HER2 
enrichment, a sample is considered “not enriched” or “enriched” if its ERBB2 has a FPKM value of ≤ 35 or > 35, respectively. “Other PIK3CA” represents 
all non-H1047 coding mutations in PIK3CA. “No data” represents samples with no mutation data. Annotation row titles marked with a “*” indicate 
a significant ( p ≤0.05) difference in enrichment between the subtypes

strategies consistently identified the same two subtypes 
as the NMF approach (Additional file 1: Fig. S2D).
We then performed the same subtyping analyses 
on the other large study of canine mammary tumors 
(n = 57) (the validation set), whose RNA-seq data are 
single-end [27], differing from the discovery set. These 
tumors also clustered into two subtypes, consistent 
with the discovery set (Additional file 1: Fig. S2E–F).
The two subtypes differ in tumor histology and inva-
siveness. One subtype is significantly ( p = 0.007) 
enriched in simple adenomas/carcinomas (where only 
one cell lineage proliferates prominently), while the 
other subtype is enriched in complex or mixed adeno-
mas/carcinomas ( p < 0.001 ) (where more than one cell 
lineages are proliferating prominently) (Fig.  1; Addi-
tional file 2: Table S1) [14, 19, 25]. Moreover, the simple 
adenomas/carcinomas-enriched subtype contains sig-
nificantly ( p < 10−6) more cases with lymph node inva-
sion (Fig.  1; Additional file  2: Table  S1). Interestingly, 
the other subtype contains significantly ( p = 0.0014 ) 
more Maltese dogs (Fig. 1; Additional file 2: Table S1).
The two subtypes display distinct molecular features. 
Among the top most mutated genes in this cohort [33], 
one subtype is enriched in PIK3CA hotspot muta-
tion H1047R/L ( p = 0.0034 ) and KAT6B mutation 
( p = 0.036 ), while the other subtype (simple adeno-
mas/carcinomas-enriched and with more lymph node 
invasion) is enriched in TP53 mutation ( p = 0.043 ) 
(Fig. 1; Additional file 2: Table S1). However, we did not 
observe any significant difference in KRAS mutation 
and TMB between the two subtypes (Fig. 1; Additional 
file 2: Table S1). For pathways, the two subtypes differ 
in mutations and copy number alterations of genes in 
PI3K signaling ( p = 0.0039 ) (Fig.  1; Additional file  2: 
Table  S1), the most altered pathway in canine mam-
mary tumors [33].
Other molecular differences between the two subtypes 
include PAM50 classification, ER and PR expression sta-
tus, and others, and will be described in more details 
below.
Canine and human basal‑like tumors cluster together 
in PAM50 classification
We performed PAM50 classification [56, 57] on the 179 
canine tumors from the discovery set. About 74% of the 
tumors were classified as either basal-like (n = 62, 35%) 
or luminal A (n = 71, 39%) (Fig.  2A; Table  1). Impor-
tantly, 90% of the basal-like tumors belong to one of the 
two subtypes shown in Fig. 1, while 90% of the luminal 
A tumors belong to the other subtype. For this reason 
and reasons described below, the two subtypes shown 
in Fig.  1 are named canine basal-like mammary tumor 
(cBLMT) and canine non-basal-like mammary tumor 
(cNBLMT), respectively.
To quantitatively assess the canine-human homology 
at the subtype level, we performed cross-species PAM50 
classification as described [14]. Briefly, we randomly 
sampled 60 human tumors from each of the luminal A, 
luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like subtypes from 
the TCGA RNA-seq study [2, 3]. These, along with all 
27 normal-like tumors in TCGA, amount to 267 human 
tumors covering all five intrinsic subtypes. We then 
performed PAM50 clustering on these human tumors 
together with all 143 subtyped canine tumors shown in 
Fig. 1. This analysis was repeated 100 times, ensuring that 
each TCGA tumor was sampled at least once.
In 66 of 100 random sampling analyses, cBLMTs and 
hBLBCs clustered together and away from tumors of 
any other canine or human subtype (Fig.  2B–C). To 
the contrary, in 87 of 100 random sampling analyses, 
cNBLMTs, the other canine subtype, did not cluster 
with tumors of any human subtype (Fig. 2B–C). These 
Fig. 2  PAM50 and feature gene classifications group canine and human basal-like tumors together, but separates canine non-basal-like 
tumors from human tumors. A. PAM50 classification of 143 subtyped canine mammary tumors. The heatmap shows hierarchical clustering 
of the canine tumors using the row-scaled ­log2(TPM) values of 43 out of the 50 PAM50 genes. The bars indicate the canine subtype from Fig. 1, 
as well as the PAM50 subtype and confidence score of each tumor. B. An example of cross-species PAM50 classification. All 143 subtyped canine 
tumors, together with 267 human tumors (60 tumors per subtype of luminal A (LumA), luminal B (LumB), basal-like, or HER2-enriched randomly 
sampled from TCGA database, along with all 27 normal-like tumors from TCGA), were subjected to PAM50 classification. The dendrogram 
is colored to indicate the minimum number of clusters that maximally separate the hLumA tumors from hBLBC tumors. This cross-species PAM50 
classification was repeated 100 times. C. Bar plot showing the number of random samplings in which human and canine basal-like tumors

observations are supported by multidimensional scal-
ing of each cross-species PAM50 classification, as 
shown by the example provided in Fig.  2D. We then 
calculated the Mahalanobis distance [46] between the 
centers of canine and/or human subtypes for each of 
the 100 random sampling analyses. The distributions 
clearly indicate that the Mahalanobis distances between 
hBLBC and cBLMT are significantly shorter than those 
between hBLBC and human luminal A (hLumA) or 
cNBLMT, as well as those between hLumA and cBLMT 
or cNBLMT (Fig. 2E; Additional file 3: Table S2). These 
results support that cBLMT molecularly resembles 
hBLBC, but cNBLMT molecularly differs from hLumA.
The PAM50 classification analysis described above 
was performed with canFam3, for which we were able 
to identify only 43 PAM50 genes (see Methods). To 
determine whether the missing genes compromise the 
conclusions, we repeated the canine-only and cross-
species PAM50 classifications by using canFam4, for 
which we identified 49 PAM50 genes (Additional file 3: 
Table  S2). For canine-only classification, the subtype 
assignment between canFam3 and canFam4 agrees at 
87% for luminal A and HER2-enriched, 78% for luminal 
B, and 71% for basal-like and normal-like (Additional 
file  3: Table  S2). Importantly, cross-species classifica-
tion with canFam 4 also reveals a significantly higher 
homology between cBLMT and hBLBC than between 
cNBLMT and hLumA (Additional file  1: Fig. S3A–E), 
consistent with the canFam3 analysis (Figs. 2A–E).
To validate this finding, we attempted to conduct the 
same analyses on the 57 tumors from the validation 
set [27]. PAM50 analysis of these canine tumors alone 
indeed classified a majority of the tumors as basal-
like (n = 21) or luminal A (n = 17) (Additional file  1: 
Fig. S3F), consistent with the discovery set (Fig.  2A). 
Moreover, many of the basal-like canine tumors have 
a PAM50 gene expression pattern that closely matches 
hBLBCs (Additional file  1: Fig. S3G). However, likely 
due to having single-end RNA-seq data, these canine 
tumors could not co-cluster with human breast tumors 
(whose RNA-seq data are paired-end) in cross-species 
PAM50 classification even after batch correction.
We next performed the same analyses on the gene 
expression microarray data of two canine studies 
(n = 27; n = 13) and of one human study (n = 327) [29–
31]. Consistent with the RNA-seq analysis described 
above, canine-only PAM50 clustering classified most 
of these canine tumors as either basal-like or luminal 
A (Additional file 1: Fig. S3H). Moreover, cross-species 
PAM50 classification clustered cBLMTs and hBLBCs 
together in a majority of random sampling analyses 
(Additional file  1: Fig. S3H–I), further supporting the 
molecular homology between cBLMT and hBLBC.

Feature genes identified by machine learning support 
cross‑species PAM50 classification results
The PAM50 genes used in our cross-species classifi-
cation (Figs.  2A–E) were established in the past using 
human breast cancer studies [56, 57]. To avoid any 
biases from using this predefined gene set, we relied on 
machine learning to objectively identify genes whose 
expression patterns characterize the hBLBC or hLumA 
subtype. Briefly, among thousands of DE genes found 
between hBLBC/hLumA and other PAM50 subtypes, the 
machine learning model consistently picks up 115 genes 
for hBLBC and 130 genes for hLumA that differentiate 
the subtype from other PAM50 subtypes (Additional 
file  1: Fig. S3J–O; Additional file  3: Table  S2). Impor-
tantly, the 115 hBLBC genes place cBLMTs significantly 
closer to hBLBCs, compared to cNBLMTs with hLumA 
tumors grouped by the 130 hLumA genes (Figs. 2F–G). 
This indicates a significantly closer homology between 
cBLMT and hBLBC, compared to between cNBLMT and 
hLumA, consistent with cross-species PAM50 analysis 
(Figs. 2A–E).
The cBLMT subtype captures key molecular features 
of hBLBC
We identified differentially expressed (DE) genes between 
cBLMT and cNBLMT. The 1123 genes upregulated 
in cBLMT are significantly enriched in cell cycle (e.g., 
DREAM targets, G2M checkpoint) and other functions 
that characterize hBLBC [3], as well as in genes that are 
known to be upregulated in hBLBC [51] (Fig. 3A; Table 1; 
Additional file  4: Table  S3). Conversely, the 497 genes 
downregulated in cBLMT are significantly enriched in 
genes that are known to be downregulated in hBLBC 
[51], as well as in functions including ion transport and 
ESR1 targets (Fig. 3A; Table 1; Additional file 4: Table S3). 
We conducted the same analysis with the validation set 
and observed similar findings (Additional file 1: Fig. S4A).

We then performed single-sample gene set enrich-
ment analysis (ssGSEA) with the signature gene sets 
activated in hBLBC and gene sets known to be up- or 
downregulated in each human breast cancer subtype 
[3, 51, 52]. This analysis indicates cell cycle, cell prolif-
eration, MYC targets, β-catenin-TCF targets, and epi-
thelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes are all 
significantly more upregulated in cBLMTs, compared to 
cNBLMTs (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the gene set known to be 
highly expressed in hBLBC is significantly upregulated in 
cBLMTs, while the gene set known to be lowly expressed 
in hBLBC is significantly downregulated in cBLMTs 
[51] (Fig. 3C). This pattern is, however, not observed in 
cNBLMTs, as the gene set known to highly expressed in 
hLumA tumors [51] does not show significant upregula-
tion in cNBLMTs (Fig. 3C). These results are largely sup-
ported by findings with the validation set (Additional 
file  1: Figs. S4B–C). The analyses indicate that cBLMT 
captures key molecular features of hBLBC examined, 
while cNBLMT fails to do so with those of hLumA.
The cBLMT subtype contains ER−PR−, ER−PR+ , 
and ER+ PR+ tumors
hBLBCs consist of approximately 70% ER-PR- (express-
ing neither ER nor PR) and 30% ER+PR− tumors, with 
ER−PR+ and ER+PR+ tumors being extremely rare, 
based on the ESR1 and PGR transcript abundance levels 
(Figs.  4A–B). However, among cBLMTs, ER−PR + and 
ER+PR+ tumors 
are 
significantly 
more 
frequent, 
accounting for 33% and 29%, respectively, while ER−
PR− and ER+PR− tumors only make up 29% and 9%, 
respectively (Fig. 4C–D; Table 1). Notably, about 78% of 
ER−PR + cBLMTs were classified as basal-like in PAM50 
analysis, similar to the percentage for ER−PR− cBLMT 
Fig. 4  cBLMT contains more ER-PR + tumors than hBLBC. Scatter plots show the ­log2(FPKM) values of ESR1 and PGR for all TCGA human breast 
cancers with a PAM50 subtype (n = 827) A, hBLBCs (n = 140) B, both cBLMTs and cNBLMTs (n = 143) C, as well as cBLMTs (n = 69) with the PAM50 
subtype D, PIK3CA mutation status E, dog’s spayed status F indicated

(85%) (Table 1; Additional file 5: Table S4). PAM50 clas-
sification also categorized 30% of ER+PR+ cBLMTs 
as basal-like, a proportion significantly higher than in 
cNBLMTs (7%) (96% of cNBLMTs are ER+PR+) (Table 1; 
Additional file  5: Table  S4). The observation of higher 
PGR expression in cBLMTs and canine tumors than in 
human breast tumors (Fig. 4A–D) is supported by anal-
ysis using canFam4 (Additional file  1: Fig. S5A–B), as 
well as by other canine and human studies [27, 30, 31, 
58] (Additional file 1: Fig. S5C–F). We noted no signifi-
cant differences in the dog’s spayed status or the PIK3CA 
mutation status among the ER±PR±cBLMT subgroups 
(Fig. 4E–F), indicating that the higher PGR expression is 
unlikely to be associated with either factor.
All cBLMT subgroups capture key molecular features 
of hBLBC
We compared each of ER−PR−, ER−PR+ , and 
ER+PR+cBLMT subgroups to cNBLMT (the ER+PR− 
subgroup contains only 6 samples and was thus excluded 
from the analysis; see Table  1). We found that the DE 
genes are enriched in functions that characterize hBLBC 
[3, 7, 59] (Figs. 5A–C; Table 1). Briefly, cell cycle and Wnt 
signaling are enriched among upregulated genes in each 
cBLMT subgroup, and the enrichment is especially sig-
nificant in ER−PR− and ER−PR+cBLMTs (Figs. 5A–C; 
Additional file  6: Table  S5). Signatures for impaired 
BRCA2 function and p53 signaling, both known features 
of hBLBC [3], are also enriched among upregulated genes 
in ER−PR− and ER−PR+cBLMTs (Figs. 5A–C; Table 1; 
Additional file 6: Table S5).
Metabolic reprogramming is frequent in cancers, 
and we investigated 44 reprogrammed metabolic path-
ways reported in human cancers [60] (Additional file 6: 
Table  S5). The analysis indicates that retinol metabo-
lism is downregulated, while keratan sulfate synthesis is 
upregulated in all cBLMT, cNBLMT, hBLBC and hLumA 
(Additional file  1: Fig. S6). Notably, serine synthesis 
and purine de novo synthesis, two pathways known to 
increase stemness (hence basal-like features) in breast 
cancer cells [61, 62], are upregulated in both hBLBCs and 
cBLMTs (no significant difference was observed among 
the subgroups) (Additional file  1: Fig. S6). The analysis 
provides another piece of data supporting the cBLMT-
hBLBC homology.
ER−PR+ cBLMTs harbor upregulated INF‑γ response genes 
but downregulated IFNG
We performed DE analysis between cBLMT subgroups 
and found additional hBLBC characteristics [2, 3, 7, 63, 
64] specific to each subgroup (Figs. 5D–F; Table 1). Com-
pared to ER+PR+and ER−PR+cBLMTs, upregulated 
genes in ER−PR− cBLMTs are significantly enriched 
in functions such as EMT (Fig.  5D–E). Meanwhile, 
upregulated genes in ER+PR+and ER−PR+cBLMTs are 
enriched in functions including interferon-gamma (INF-
γ) response (Fig. 5D–E). Other notable findings include 
that Wnt-signaling-initiated pluripotency genes and IL6/
JAK/STAT3 signaling genes are significantly upregu-
lated in ER−PR+cBLMTs, compared to ER-PR- cBLMTs 
(Fig.  5D–E). Hedgehog signaling genes are significantly 
upregulated in both ER−PR− and ER+PR+cBLMTs, 
compared to ER−PR+cBLMTs (Fig. 5D–E).
Interestingly, while the INF-γ response genes are 
upregulated in both ER+PR+and ER−PR+cBLMTs 
(Fig.  5D–E), the INF-γ gene (IFNG) itself is signifi-
cantly downregulated in ER−PR+cBLMTs than in 
ER+PR+cBLMTs (Fig.  6A). This indicates that T cell 
exhaustion may occur in ER−PR+cBLMTs [63]. To 
investigate this possibility, we examined the expression 
of 8 known T cell exhaustion markers [65], but did not 
find a significant difference among the three subgroups 
(Fig. 6A).
As 6 out of 8  T cell exhaustion markers, including 
PDCD1 (encoding PD-1), express higher in ER−PR+ and/
or ER+PR+cBLMTs (Fig. 6A), we examined the associa-
tion of each marker with PGR or ESR1 in expression. We 
found that four markers, including PDCD1, HAVCR2, 
CTLA4, and TIGIT, have a significant positive associa-
tion with PGR in ER−PR + cBLMTs (Fig. 6B; Additional 
file 1: Fig. S7A). No such associations were found for PGR 
in other cBLMT subgroups or the cNBLMT subtype, or 
for ESR1 in any cBLMT subgroup or cNBLMT (Figs. 6B–
C; Additional file 1: Fig. S7A–B).
PGR expression is associated with gene silencing
To further understand PR in canine tumors, we inves-
tigated genes that correlate with PGR or ESR1 in tran-
script abundance in both human and canine tumors. 
The same as in hLumA tumors, over 1000 genes were 
found to be positively correlated with ESR1 in cNBLMTs 
(Fig. 7A). Importantly, both sets of genes are enriched in 
the same functions, including cell cycle (Fig. 7A; Addi-
tional file 7: Table S6). For PGR, about 2.7 times as many 
(776 versus 289) positively correlated genes were iden-
tified for cNBLMT than hLumA (Fig.  7A). Moreover, 
while the PGR-correlated 289 genes in hLumA tumors 
are enriched in largely the same functions as those of the 
ESR1-correlated genes, the 776 PGR-correlated genes in 
cNBLMTs are enriched in interferon-γ response (Fig. 7A; 
Additional file 7: Table S6).
Fewer positively correlated genes with ESR1 or PGR 
were identified in basal-like tumors in both species. For 
ESR1, we found about 400 genes in cBLMTs, which are 
enriched in functions including fatty acid metabolisms, 
oxidative phosphorylation, and SUZ12 targets, and 82 
Page 12 of 18
Watson et al. Breast Cancer Research          (2023) 25:114 
genes in hBLBCs, which are not enriched in any specific 
functions (Fig. 7A; Additional file 7: Table S6). For PGR, 
while no genes were found in hBLBC, about 300 genes in 
cBLMT were identified and are enriched in interferon-γ 
response and GATA1 targets (Fig. 7A; Additional file 7: 
Table S6).
Negatively correlated genes show a larger dog–human 
difference, especially for the basal-like subtype and PGR. 
For ESR1 in non-basal-like subtypes, 394 genes in hLumA 
tumors, enriched in functions including EMT, KRAS 
signaling, and SUZ12 targets, and 38 genes in cNBLMTs, 
enriched in functions such as oxidative phosphorylation, 
were identified (Fig. 7B; Additional file 7: Table S6). How-
ever, in basal-like subtypes, only 2 genes were negatively 
correlated with ESR1 in hBLBCs, compared to 58 in 
cBLMTs that are enriched in cell cycle-related functions 
such as mitotic spindle and G2M checkpoints (Fig.  7B; 
Additional file 7: Table S6). For PGR, while no genes were

identified in either hLumA or hBLBC tumors, 142 genes 
in cNBLMT, enriched in functions such as hypoxia and 
glycolysis, and 71 genes in cBLMT, not enriched in any 
specific functions, were found (Fig. 7B; Additional file 7: 
Table S6).
PRLR has different features from PGR
Prolactin (also called luteotropin) is described as 
the third hormone in breast cancer [66]. We hence 
examined the expression of the prolactin gene PRL 
and the prolactin receptor gene PRLR. We found 
that PRL is essentially not expressed in any canine 
tumors ( FPKM < 1) (Additional file  1: Fig. S7D). 
PRLR, however, is expressed in many canine tumors 
( 1 < FPKM < 60 ) (Additional file 1: Fig. S7E). Among 
the canine subgroups/subtypes, the expression level 
of PRLR is the lowest in ER−PR− cBLMT tumors 
and increases by approximately 3-, 24-, and 44-fold

in ER−PR+cBLMT, ER+PR+cBLMT, and cNBLMT 
(> 90% of which are ER+PR+) samples, respectively 
(Additional file 1: Fig. S7E). Accordingly, PRLR expres-
sion is significantly positively correlated with ESR1 
and PGR expression in these canine tumors (Addi-
tional file 1: Fig. S7F).
Resembling canine mammary tumors, PRL is largely 
not expressed while PRLR is expressed in human 
breast cancers (Additional file  1: Fig. S7D–E). How-
ever, for the matched subtypes and subgroups, PRLR 
is expressed higher in human tumors than in canine 
tumors (Additional file 1: Fig. S7D–E). PRLR has lower 
positive correlation with ESR1 and PGR in human 
tumors compared to canine tumors (Additional file 1: 
Fig. S7G).
To determine whether PRLR is correlated with T 
cell exhaustion markers, we repeated the same analy-
sis with ESR1 and PGR as shown in Figs.  6B–C. We 
found no significant correlations for PRLR, unlike PGR 
(Fig.  6D; Additional file  1: Fig. S7C). Furthermore, 
we observed no clear association of PRLR with gene 
silencing in cBLMT, differing from PGR (Additional 
file 1: Fig. S8).
Discussion
Taking advantage of the recently published RNA-seq 
data for hundreds of canine mammary tumor cases, we 
performed, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide and 
independent (not using any known biomarkers) subtyp-
ing of this cancer common in bitches that are intact or 
spayed late. The study identifies two subtypes and further 
shows that one subtype molecularly resembles hBLBC, 
while the other subtype appears not to match any human 
breast cancer subtypes. This conclusion is consistent with 
our previous study [14], but differs from a recent publica-
tion reporting that canine and human luminal A tumors 
have more molecular homology than canine and human 
basal-like tumors [26]. While our canine-only PAM50 
analysis also classifies most tumors of one canine subtype 
as luminal A, the same as the study by Bergholtz et al. 
[26], our cross-species PAM50 analysis clearly separates 
canine luminal A tumors from hLumA tumors, unlike 
basal-like tumors (as such, we named the two canine 
subtypes as basal-like, cBLMT, and non-basal-like, 
cNBLMT) (note that Bergholtz et  al. [26] did not per-
form cross-species PAM50 classification). Importantly, 
our conclusion is supported by PAM50-independent

classification using hBLBC and hLumA feature genes 
identified by machine learning. We further show that 
cBLMTs capture key molecular features and expression 
patterns of hBLBCs, whereas cNBLMTs fail to do the 
same with hLumA tumors. Our results are supported 
by the histology of the canine subtypes. cBLMTs are 
enriched in simple carcinomas and simple adenomas, 
where only one cell lineage prominently proliferates. 
cNBLMTs, however, are enriched in complex or mixed 
carcinomas and adenomas, where multiple cell lineages 
(e.g., epithelial cells and myoepithelial cells) proliferate 
[14, 19, 20]. Complex or mixed tumors (e.g., adenomy-
oepithelioma) are very rare in human breast cancer [14, 
21, 22]; thus, cNBLMTs do not match hLumA tumors 
histologically.
Our findings have significant biological implications. 
The strong molecular homology between hBLBC and 
cBLMT revealed by this study provides the fundamental 
justification to use our powerful dog–human comparison 
strategy [67] for cancer driver—passenger discrimination, 
a central aim of cancer research [68], for hBLBC. Briefly, 
hBLBCs are characterized with extensive copy number 
alterations, and harbor thousands of amplified or deleted 
genes [3, 4], some being drivers (cancer-causative) and 
many others being passengers (not cancer-causative). 
Studies by us [33] and others [69] have also detected hun-
dreds of amplified or deleted genes in canine mammary 
tumors. In our dog–human comparison strategy [67], 
drivers are those genes amplified/deleted in both hBLBC 
and cBLMT, while passengers are those genes amplified/
deleted only in hBLBC and located near a dog–human 
genomic rearrangement breakpoint. Our strategy has 
been successfully applied to colorectal cancer [67], and 
its application to hBLBC will equally yield new insights 
into hBLBC carcinogenesis.
Our findings have significant clinical implications. 
About 70% of hBLBCs are triple negative (ER-, PR-, and 
HER2 not enriched). Thus, hormone therapy and anti-
HER2 drugs are often not applicable, and hBLBC tends 
to have the poorest prognosis among the PAM50 sub-
types. Effective treatments of hBLBCs are hence urgently 
needed. Our study shows that cBLMTs can serve as 
a much-needed translational model to speed up anti-
hBLBC drug discovery. Due to the large dog population 
(> 80 million pet dogs in the US alone), more similar body 
size between humans and dogs, more relaxed FDA regu-
lation, and, most importantly, the strong dog–human 
molecular homology, cBLMTs can be a stepping stone to 
bridge a current gap between preclinical research (mostly 
using cell lines and rodents) and human clinical trials, 
accelerating bench-to-bedside translation. The hBLBC 
driver discovery, as described above, can also yield tar-
gets for hBLBC intervention.
Although cBLMT co-clusters with hBLBC in PAM50 
classification and captures the key molecular features 
and gene expression patterns of hBLBC, cBLMT con-
tains ER−PR+ and ER+PR+tumors, which are rare in 
hBLBC. Moreover, while ER+PR− tumors are com-
mon in hBLBC and other breast cancer subtypes, ER−
PR+ tumors are nearly nonexistent in any human breast 
cancer subtype. This is because that in human breast 
cells, PR is induced by ER [70, 71], and thus, without 
ER, PR will not be expressed. One notable difference 
between the estrous cycle in bitches and the menstrual 
cycle in women is the luteal phase, which lasts 14 days 
for humans but 2 months for dogs. As the canine mam-
mary glands are constantly exposed to a high level of 
progesterone during the luteal phase [72, 73], it is pos-
sible that the PGR gene is still actively transcribed after 
the ESR1 gene is silenced in dogs, resulting in the ER−
PR+ tumors. More studies are needed to investigate 
this possibility.
Despite the difference in the PR expression status, 
ER+PR+ and ER−PR+ cBLMTs capture key molecular 
features of hBLBCs, the same as ER−PR− cBLMTs. These 
include upregulation of cell cycle genes and Wnt signal-
ing. Upregulation of cell cycle genes could lead to high 
cell proliferation, a molecular characteristic of hBLBC 
[3]. Activated Wnt signaling is also a well-known feature 
of hBLBC [7, 59]. For example, WNT5B, one of the major 
Wnt signaling molecules, is known to drive the hBLBC 
phenotype, both in vitro and in vivo, by activating both 
canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling [74]. WNT5B 
is upregulated in both ER−PR+ and ER+PR+cBLMTs. 
Wnt signaling-driving pluripotency genes are upregu-
lated in ER-PR+cBLMTs, which likely further drives the 
basal-like features of these tumors [59].
One notable finding from our study is that in ER−
PR+cBLMTs, interferon-γ response genes are upreg-
ulated, but the interferon-γ gene (IFNG) itself is 
downregulated. Moreover, ER-PR+cBLMTs appear to 
express more of the immune checkpoint genes PDCD1 
(encoding PD-1) and CTLA4, and only in these tumors, 
PGR is positively correlated with PDCD1 and CTLA4. 
These results are consistent with T cell exhaustion, where 
T cells are hypofunctional [75]. T cell exhaustion occurs 
in many human cancers, including hBLBCs [63] and 
presents challenges and opportunities in cancer immu-
notherapy [75]. Due to the small sample size, we cannot 
conclude definitively that T cell exhaustion indeed occurs 
in cBLMTs. Once this possibility is validated with further 
studies, cBLMTs could be a valuable model to investi-
gate the relationship among progesterone, PR, and T cell 
exhaustion. Importantly, cBLMTs may be good models to 
test novel immunotherapies targeting T cell exhaustion 
[75].

Our study reveals that unlike ESR1, PGR is associ-
ated with gene silencing in canine mammary tumors. 
However, the silenced genes appear to be random and 
not enriched in any particular functions, especially in 
ER−PR+ cBLMTs. Interestingly, we find that many of 
the ESR1 or PGR-correlated genes are targets of SUZ12, 
a component of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) 
that primarily methylates lysine 27 of histone H3 (e.g., 
H3K27me3, a marker of transcriptionally silent chroma-
tin). Further studies are needed to determine whether 
PRC2 is responsible for PGR-associated gene silencing.
PRLR, encoding the receptor for prolactin (which is 
also called luteotropin, and has been described as the 
third hormone in breast cancer [66]) resembles ESR1 
more than PGR in our study. For example, PRLR is not 
associated with T cell exhaustion markers and gene 
silencing. However, more studies are needed to under-
stand the role of PRLR and prolactin in canine mammary 
tumors, including their protein expression levels among 
the subtypes and subgroups.
Conclusions
We identify two molecular subtypes in spontaneous 
canine mammary tumors. One subtype, cBLMT, molecu-
larly and histologically resembles hBLBC, a breast can-
cer subtype that lacks an effective treatment and has the 
worst clinical outcomes. The other subtype, cNBLMT, 
appears not to match any human breast cancer sub-
type molecularly and histologically. While cBLMTs also 
consist of ER−PR+and ER+PR+ tumors (which may 
be related to the long luteal phase of the estrous cycle 
in dogs), a difference from hBLBC, we note that these 
tumors capture the key molecular features of hBLBCs, 
the same as ER−PR− cBLMTs. Thus, cBLMTs could 
serve as a much-needed spontaneous animal model for 
hBLBC, filling a critical gap in breast cancer research. 
Moreover, while much more studies are needed, ER−
PR+cBLMTs may provide a valuable system to study T 
cell exhaustion, as well as estrogen/ER-independent roles 
of progesterone and PR in gene silencing.
