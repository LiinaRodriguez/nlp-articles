Recent technological developments have resulted in the availability of miniaturised spectral imaging sen- 
sors capable of operating in the multi- (MSI) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) regimes. Simultaneous 
advances in image-processing techniques and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), especially in machine learning 
and deep learning, have made these data-rich modalities highly attractive as a means of extracting bio- 
logical information non-destructively. Surgery in particular is poised to beneﬁt from this, as spectrally- 
resolved tissue optical properties can offer enhanced contrast as well as diagnostic and guidance infor- 
mation during interventions. This is particularly relevant for procedures where inherent contrast is low 
under standard white light visualisation. This review summarises recent work in surgical spectral imag- 
ing (SSI) techniques, taken from Pubmed, Google Scholar and arXiv searches spanning the period 2013–
2019. New hardware, optimised for use in both open and minimally-invasive surgery (MIS), is described, 
and recent commercial activity is summarised. Computational approaches to extract spectral information 
from conventional colour images are reviewed, as tip-mounted cameras become more commonplace in 
MIS. Model-based and machine learning methods of data analysis are discussed in addition to simula- 
tion, phantom and clinical validation experiments. A wide variety of surgical pilot studies are reported 
but it is apparent that further work is needed to quantify the clinical value of MSI/HSI. The current trend 
toward data-driven analysis emphasises the importance of widely-available, standardised spectral imag- 
ing datasets, which will aid understanding of variability across organs and patients, and drive clinical 
translation.

1. Introduction 
Advances in interventional and surgical techniques have been 
driven by technological developments in instrumentation and 
imaging that have enhanced the surgeon’s ability to diagnose and 
treat patients with greater precision. Continuous advances in illu- 
mination, detection and display technology are beginning to ad- 
dress limitations and enhance the information available to the 
clinician beyond that naturally observable by the human eye or 
under conventional white light visualisation. Spectrally-resolved 
measurements of reﬂected light offer a particular opportunity to 
explore and exploit inherent contrast between different tissues 
and pathologies during both open and minimally-invasive surgery 
(MIS). This review summarises the clinical context for this technol- 
ogy, recent hardware and software advances, and discusses how it 
may be translated into practice.

Fig. 1. (a) Light propagation in a multi-layered tissue such as the bowel. Some light is regularly reﬂected, with the rest penetrating the surface where it may be scattered and 
absorbed (indicated by the shift in colour of the arrows). Autoﬂuorescence emission may also occur. After suﬃcient scattering a fraction may re-emerge from the tissue and 
be detected. Red wavelengths penetrate the tissue signiﬁcantly deeper, due to lower absorption by haemoglobin, than blue or green. (b) Optical properties of major absorbers 
in surgical imaging applications (absorption data taken from compilation by Prahl (2018) ). Haemoglobin (molar concentration 2.33 mM) is the overwhelming chromophore, 
while the water contribution (55 M) is negligible in the visible range. Bilirubin (20.5 μM) has a peak in the blue but normal physiological concentrations are low. The main 
lipid (molar concentration unknown, see van Veen et al. (2004) for details) absorption peaks are found at blue and NIR wavelengths. The scattering curve shown, with values 
indicated on the secondary axis, is constructed using Eq. (2) and typical values for bowel tissue from Jacques (2013) . Shaded areas represent typical RGB ﬁlter coverage in 
the visible range. (c) Eight-band MSI datacube of a segment of porcine bowel tissue. The same information is collected by colour cameras in three 100 nm-wide red, green 
and blue bands (RGB) which, when combined, produce a colour image. 
1.1. Biophotonics and surgery 
When light penetrates the surface of tissue it may be ab- 
sorbed, scattered or transmitted. Additionally, after absorption, 
some molecules may reradiate ﬂuorescent light of longer wave- 
length ( Fig. 1 (a)). Therefore, when light is reﬂected from tissue it 
carries the ﬁngerprint of the molecular make-up and constituents 
of that tissue. Other weaker interactions, such as inelastic scatter- 
ing ( Lin et al., 2018a ), and non-linear processes may offer addi- 
tional contrast ( Palero et al., 2011 ), but are not considered here. 
Fig. 1 (b) shows the chief attenuators of light in surgically-exposed 
tissue, i.e., under the skin. Absorption by oxygenated and deoxy- 
genated haemoglobin (HbO 2 and Hb, respectively) is dominant, 
while fat (lipids) has a small peak in the visible range. Water 
has a much weaker effect, that increases beyond NIR wavelengths. 
Yellow pigments like bilirubin have an appreciable peak in the 
blue-green region of the spectrum ( Jacques, 2013 ) but, outside 
of areas with high concentrations of bile (e.g., the gall bladder 
( Wirkert et al., 2017 ) or in cases of bilirubinaemia ( Halder et al., 
2019 )), the volume fraction is low. Elastic scattering occurs due to 
refractive index discontinuities at a range of length scales from 
nanometres (cell membrane) to hundreds of microns (fat cells) 
( Tuchin, 2015a ). The strength of these interactions varies with 
wavelength, meaning that spectrally-resolved measurements may 
be used to unmix and quantify the individual contributors. The 
ﬁeld of biophotonics seeks to accomplish this disentanglement 
through controlled illumination and detection hardware in tandem 
with mathematical modelling, simulation and data-driven analysis 
of the light-tissue interaction. 
1.2. Optical imaging in surgery 
Colour digital cameras are the primary sensing tools used to 
guide surgeons during MIS ( Mirota et al., 2011 ). These mimic the 
sensitivity of the human eye by detecting visible wavelengths of 
light in the red, green and blue (RGB) spectral regions. These 
are mounted on the proximal end of rigid endoscopes ( Fig. 2 (e)), 
which relay images of the tissue via a system of Hopkins rod 
lenses, while illumination is provided by a high-brightness white 
light source ( Cockett and Cockett, 1998 ). Flexible endoscopes (and, 
recently, some rigid endoscopes) have distal tip-mounted sensors 
to provide high deﬁnition images. These allow detection and in- 
spection of lesions within luminal structures, such as the gastroin- 
testinal (GI) tract and bronchus, enabling complex interventions 
to be performed ( Shen et al., 2019 ). Some specialist procedures, 
such as inspection of the pancreatic and bile ducts, are carried 
out using a ﬁbre optic imaging bundle ( Fig. 2 (f)) that transmits 
a low resolution image to a camera at the instrument’s proxi- 
mal end ( Voaklander et al., 2016 ). The most common surgical op- 
tical imaging device outside of MIS is the operating microscope 
( Fig. 2 (g)), and variations on its design are used for microsurgical 
tasks in neurosurgery, otolaryngology, ophthalmology, gynaecology, 
dentistry and plastic surgery ( Kriss and Kriss, 1998 ; Uluç et al., 
2009 ). Although primarily used by the surgeon for direct, magni- 
ﬁed, vision of the operating ﬁeld, many systems have additional 
ports that can be used to mount cameras or additional eyepieces 
( Hoerenz, 1980 ). 
Standard colour cameras are chieﬂy used to relay images of 
the operating ﬁeld to the surgeon, particularly in MIS or micro- 
surgery. Therefore, beyond improvements in resolution, magniﬁca- 
tion and access to challenging anatomical sites, enhancement of 
the surgeon’s ability to assess the viability of a tissue or charac- 
terise the extent of disease is limited to what would be observable 
under direct vision. As a result many decisions are still subjective 
( de Cunha et al., 2004 ) and heavily dependant on the experience of 
the operator ( Ignjatovic et al., 2009 ). Surgery has increasingly been 
looking to advanced optical instrumentation to improve this by 
providing objective assessments of tissue health in real time. Some 
optical imaging modalities have gained clinical adoption, such as 
narrowband imaging (NBI), which uses a narrow range of green 
and blue wavelengths to generate high contrast images of blood 
vessels. This technology has had limited success in delivering on 
its diagnostic potential as subjective human interpretation is still 
required ( Ignjatovic et al., 2009 ; Rees et al., 2016 ). Exogenous ﬂu- 
orescent contrast agents are also capable of identifying blood ves- 
sels and recent trials have indicated potential for detection of can- 
cer ( DSouza et al., 2016 ). Although several specialised agents with 
molecular speciﬁcity are undergoing in vivo trials ( Nagaya et al., 
2017 ), routine imaging capabilities are still restricted to a small 
number of clinically-approved dyes. 
1.3. Spectral imaging 
Spectral imaging techniques capture the reﬂectance spectrum of 
the tissue over an entire surface, assembling a datacube consist- 
ing of one spectral and two spatial dimensions ( Fig. 1 (c)). Depend- 
ing on the number of bands acquired the imaging system may be 
termed multispectral (MSI; up to 10 s) or hyperspectral (HSI; up 
N.T. Clancy, G. Jones and L. Maier-Hein et al. / Medical Image Analysis 63 (2020) 101699 
3 
to 100 s). Lu and Fei (2014) describe the main approaches used 
to assemble the datacube, which may be broken down into scan- 
ning (either in the spatial or spectral dimensions) and snapshot 
(acquiring spatial and spectral information simultaneously) modal- 
ities. These spectral data can then be used to generate maps of 
tissue function ( Tetschke et al., 2016 ; Kawauchi et al., 2019 ), struc- 
tural abnormalities ( Bedard et al., 2013 ) or enhanced contrast be- 
tween different organs and structures ( Akbari et al., 20 08a , 20 08b ). 
There are a variety of surgical imaging techniques with spectral 
sensitivity, each bringing particular advantages in depth penetra- 
tion (photoacoustic tomography; ( Zhu et al., 2018 )), separation of 
absorption and scattering effects (spatial frequency domain imag- 
ing (SFDI); ( Gioux et al., 2011 )) and speciﬁcity (ﬂuorescence guid- 
ance; ( Zhou and El-Deiry, 2009 )). Despite their advantages, these 
methods inevitably come with caveats related to hardware com- 
plexity, motion artefacts or the need for exogenous contrast agents. 
Although some of the demand for spectral imaging technology has 
been motivated by the increasing availability of ﬂuorophores for 
diagnostics and guidance ( Debie and Hernot, 2019 ), a detailed dis- 
cussion of this ﬁeld is outside the scope of this paper and rele- 
vant reviews may be found elsewhere ( DSouza et al., 2016 ). In this 
review we concentrate on purely reﬂectance-based MSI and HSI 
implementations due to their increasing availability, compatibility 
with other clinical instruments, and the growing range and power 
of data processing tools. 
A review by Lu and Fei (2014) summarised the principal hard- 
ware designs and general medical applications of spectral imaging. 
Other relevant reviews have also been published, focussing on spe- 
ciﬁc medical applications such as neuroimaging ( Giannoni et al., 
2018 ), wound assessment ( Thatcher et al., 2016 ) and gastroenterol- 
ogy ( Ortega et al., 2019 ). However, the ongoing growth of this re- 
search ﬁeld, coupled with increasing commercial interest, has pro- 
vided the motivation to write this review. In this article we aim 
to: 
• Focus on surgical applications with particular emphasis on MIS 
and MIS-compatible approaches 
• Describe current clinically-approved commercial systems 
• Discuss new computational methods including estimation of 
spectral detail from conventional colour images 
• Discuss methods and data for training and validating imaging 
systems as well as for understanding fundamental variability 
across organs and patients. 
Papers for this review were drawn from the Pubmed database, 
Google Scholar and arXiv with an emphasis on those published 
after spring 2013, which was the end of the period covered by 
Lu and Fei (2014) . The search terms used were spectral imaging 
(including multi/hyperspectral), surgery (including minimally inva- 
sive, minimal access, and open) and in vivo . 
In this paper we ﬁrst outline the major developments in imag- 
ing hardware designs, separated by acquisition method, discussing 
their relative merits with reference to speciﬁc clinical applica- 
tions. Commercial spectral imaging cameras are highlighted, in- 
cluding complete systems optimised for clinical use. Data analysis 
is covered in Section 3 , beginning with a brief overview of light- 
tissue interaction theory and modelling before progressing to re- 
gression methods, classiﬁcation problems and machine learning. 
Section 4 discusses methods of validating SSI systems, including 
computer simulations, tissue phantoms and real tissue ( ex vivo and 
in vivo ), and their ability to quantify performance. The discussion 
in Section 5 identiﬁes the major challenges facing SSI technology 
in its push toward routine clinical use, and proposes ways the re- 
search community may focus their efforts to overcome them. 
2. Surgical spectral imaging (SSI) hardware 
The continued growth in spectral imaging activity has seen fur- 
ther increases in the application and scope of SSI methods, as ev- 
idenced by Table 1 . Detailed descriptions of datacube acquisition 
mechanisms are described in other reviews, therefore we sum- 
marise the main types relevant to SSI ( Sections 2.1 to 2.3 ), along 
with a discussion of practical and application-speciﬁc constraints. 
2.1. Spectral scanning 
Spectral scanning methods sequentially acquire images at dif- 
ferent wavelengths. One common approach is to ﬂood the scene 
with broadband illumination and include a bandpass ﬁlter in front 
of a monochrome camera to image the reﬂected light. A differ- 
ent wavelength is acquired by mechanically switching using a 
ﬁlter wheel ( Fig. 2 (a)) ( King et al., 2015 ; Wirkert et al., 2016 ; 
Clancy et al., 2018 ), or by using an electronically-tuneable de- 
vice such as a liquid crystal tuneable ﬁlter (LCTF) or acousto- 
optical tuneable ﬁlter (AOTF). This has the advantage of being com- 
patible with currently-used high-brightness xenon surgical light 
sources, while the relatively simple detection hardware can be 
connected directly to clinical optical imaging instruments as the 
transmission ﬁlter is the only addition to the beam path. There- 
fore, with minimal modiﬁcation, ﬁlter-based SSI devices can be at- 
tached to rigid endoscopes ( Arnold et al., 2011 ; Kavvadias et al., 
2013 ; Clancy et al., 2015 ) and operating microscopes ( Ma et al., 
2016a ), or positioned on an articulated arm for open or external 
imaging procedures ( Orfanoudaki et al., 2005 ; Holmer et al., 2018 ; 
Kulcke et al., 2018 ). Relative tissue-camera motion may cause arte- 
facts in the datacube, particularly during long sequences, although 
this may be rectiﬁed post-acquisition using registration techniques 
( Clancy et al., 2012b ; Du et al., 2015 ). 
Scanning may also be implemented in illumination, using a 
white light source and monochromator ( Regeling et al., 2016 ), ﬁl- 
ter wheel ( Gu et al., 2016 ; Han et al., 2016 ; Wisotzky et al., 
2018 ), variable optical ﬁlter (VOF) ( Kavvadias et al., 2013 ), AOTF 
( Hohmann et al., 2017 ) or digital micromirror device (DMD; 
Fig. 2 (b)) ( Koh et al., 2009 ; Zuzak et al., 2011 ). Triple bandpass 
illumination ﬁlters overlapping with RGB detection can be used 
to achieve a degree of parallelisation and higher acquisition rates 
( Fawzy et al., 2015 ). The increasing availability of high-power light- 
emitting diodes (LEDs) at multiple wavelengths has enabled cre- 
ation of light-eﬃcient MSI sources capable of switching at high 
speed ( Guevara et al., 2013 ; Bélanger et al., 2016 ) and at low- 
cost ( Bolton et al., 2018 ). With a high quantum eﬃciency sen- 
sor, such as an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EM- 
CCD) or scientiﬁc complementary metal oxide semiconductor (sC- 
MOS), a strobed LED source can also incorporate ﬂuorescence exci- 
tation along with reﬂectance measurements, as demonstrated by 
Ma et al. (2016a) . This allows quantiﬁcation of haemodynamic 
events, which can further be used to correct the observed ﬂuores- 
cence signal ( Ma et al., 2016b ). The disadvantages of LEDs are in- 
eﬃcient ﬁbre-coupling, which is problematic for MIS applications, 
and inconsistent spectral resolution across the visible and near- 
infrared range. Low-loss multiplexing using light guides is possible 
( Clancy et al., 2012a ) but is diﬃcult to scale to a large number of 
wavelengths. The challenge for practical implementation of tune- 
able light source-enabled SSI is the need to achieve fast electronic 
or software-enabled synchronisation with the camera, which re- 
quires interfaces that are not typically available on standard clini- 
cal MIS or tip-mounted endoscopic cameras. In open surgery cases, 
ambient light is an added complication as there is no rejection of 
the out-of-band signal, nor can the spectrum of the background be 
measured. This reduces the overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to a 
greater degree than in systems where scanning is accomplished on

attached directly onto the sensor (for other ﬁeld-splitting arrangements see Section 2.3 ). Commonly-used clinical imaging devices, excluding chip-on-tip instruments, are 
shown, with cross-sections illustrating imaging mechanisms: (e) laparoscope with rod lens image relay and optical ﬁbres running inside the shaft to carry illumination 
light; (f) ﬁbrescope with ﬂexible ﬁbre image guide and ﬁbre optic illumination; (g) operating microscope with co-axial illumination; (h) externally-mounted imager for open 
surgery using camera lens and ring light illumination. The lenses at the eyepiece/camera port must be chosen to form a suitably-magniﬁed image on the sensor, if employing 
SSI types (a, d), or to produce parallel rays, if using an additional scanning mechanism as in (c). 
the detection side and ambient light may be accounted for during 
system spectral correction. 
2.2. Spatial scanning 
Spatial scanning involves acquiring the spectral information 
from a single point (whisk-broom ( Qiu et al., 2010 )) or line (push- 
broom, Fig. 2 (c); ( Khoobehi et al., 2004 ; Clancy et al., 2016b ; 
Tetschke et al., 2016 )) and scanning across the ﬁeld-of-view us- 
ing galvanometer (galvo) mirrors or robotic actuation mechanisms 
( Avila-Rencoret et al., 2015 ). Spectrometers and imaging spectro- 
graphs enable high spectral resolution (a few nm, band full-width 
at half-maximum (FWHM)) at hundreds of wavelengths. Spatial 
resolution is limited to the number of scan lines acquired and 
the constraints imposed by any motion in the target tissue. The 
necessity to house multiple dispersive optical elements, particu- 
larly in the case of pushbroom imagers, has made miniaturisa- 
tion of these systems a challenge. However, developments such as 
sensor-mounted Fabry-Pérot interference ﬁlters, have enabled the 
manufacture of hyperspectral devices with spectral sensitivity in- 
tegrated along one dimension of the sensor ( Pichette et al., 2017 ). 
This means that the system footprint is limited by the scanning 
mechanism employed. 
The main limitation to surgical application of this method 
is its sensitivity to motion artefacts and the diﬃculty in align- 
ing the spatial slices post acquisition. In vivo imaging of inter- 
nal anatomy using ﬂexible endoscopes has been demonstrated 
with this technique ( Clancy et al., 2016b ), with scan times min- 
imised to limit the effect of motion and deformation during 
data capture ( Kumashiro et al., 2016 ). Alternatively, simultane- 
ous wide-ﬁeld imaging using a second camera can allow motion- 
correction ( Yoon et al., 2019a ). External anatomy and more rigid 
internal organs, less prone to gross motion and deformation have 
yielded high resolution results in wound-healing ( Calin et al., 2015 ; 
Holmer et al., 2016 ), neuroimaging ( Mori et al., 2014 ; Fabelo et al., 
2018 ) and ﬂap transplantation monitoring ( Kulcke et al., 2018 ). 
2.3. Snapshot acquisition 
Snapshot imagers capture all three dimensions of the datacube 
simultaneously. This is usually done by distributing both spatial 
and spectral information across a single image sensor. A compre- 
hensive review of snapshot spectral imaging devices and a detailed 
treatment of their operating principles is presented by Hagen and 
Kudenov (2013) . Their principal disadvantage is that fast acquisi- 
tion is achieved by compromising on spatial resolution. Depend- 
ing on the mechanism used, this effectively limits the number of 
wavebands to the MSI domain. For example, for a 9-band snap- 
shot imager based on a 2048 × 1088 sensor, the ﬁnal spatial res- 
olution will be 0.25 MP, but for 25 bands this drops to 0.09 MP. 
This approach has found particular use in applications where the 
sensor size is not the limiting factor for spatial resolution, such as 
ﬁbrescopes. ( Shadfan et al., 2017 ). Improved spectral performance 
can be achieved using ﬁbre bundles to map spatial locations to in- 
puts on a spectrograph ( Khoobehi et al., 2012 ), while spatial res- 
olution can be improved through combination with simultaneous 
RGB imaging ( Lin et al., 2018b ). 
Snapshot detectors using multiple optical elements, such as 
prisms and image-slicing mirrors, may add signiﬁcant weight 
through glass components and metal enclosures, which constrains 
their use. Their complex bespoke design further limits the range of 
applications in which they can be used. For these reasons snapshot 
imagers have remained relatively inaccessible for general research 
applications until recently, with the advent of spectral imaging 
sensors. A number of companies now offer products in this area, 
with spectral ﬁlters positioned directly onto the sensor. These are 
conﬁgured as tiled , consisting of an array of relatively large ﬁlters 
covering 10 0 0s of pixels, and mosaic , having a repeating pixel-level 
pattern over the entire sensor, designs ( Fig. 2 (d)). They are cur- 
6 
N.T. Clancy, G. Jones and L. Maier-Hein et al. / Medical Image Analysis 63 (2020) 101699 
rently available both in OEM form and as part of a complete cam- 
era package ( Pichette et al., 2016 ). Like the spectral scanning sys- 
tems, discussed in Section 2.1 , these cameras can be placed directly 
in place of existing clinical digital cameras on rigid endoscopes 
( Wirkert et al., 2018 ), ﬁbrescopes ( Luthman et al., 2018 ), and op- 
erating microscopes. 
2.4. Applications and system choice 
The hardware conﬁguration to be used for a particular SSI ap- 
plication must be made with an appreciation of the advantages 
and disadvantages of each approach and is a question that can- 
not be answered by a single metric. Variable ﬁlters such as the 
LCTF and AOTF offer the advantages of being free from mov- 
ing parts, having electronic control and ﬂexibility in wavelength 
choice. However, the devices are optically ineﬃcient: for exam- 
ple, LCTFs optical transmittance ranges from 5% at 420 nm to ap- 
proximately 35% at 700 nm ( CRi, 2019 ; Thorlabs, 2019 ), necessitat- 
ing long camera integration times or sophisticated high-sensitivity 
sensors to collect enough light. Cameras employing sCMOS, inten- 
siﬁers or EMCCDs ( Martin et al., 2006 ; Arnold et al., 2010 ) have 
been used in these systems to operate at speeds approaching video 
rates. Due to the sequential nature of the acquisition process, the 
datacube may be subject to artefacts induced by cardiac, peri- 
staltic or respiratory motion. This can cause signiﬁcant misalign- 
ment in the image stack, particularly if a large number of wave- 
lengths are required, resulting in errors in the spectra recorded 
at particular spatial points. These errors can be corrected using 
a separate colour camera to track motion and apply correspond- 
ing adjustments to the spectral channel via photogrammetry tech- 
niques ( Clancy et al., 2012b ). Alternatively, computer vision tools 
for non-rigid registration can be used to align the spectral images 
using contrast and intensity-based features ( Stoyanov et al., 2012 ; 
Du et al., 2015 ). 
Pushbroom hyperspectral sensors are desirable for applications 
where high spectral resolution is required. For example, to achieve 
spectral unmixing of multiple absorbers and scattering contribu- 
tors ( Randeberg et al., 2010 ) or classify lesions ( Kumashiro et al., 
2016 ). Pushbroom HSI cameras offer great application versatility 
as they provide high resolution data at hundreds of wavelengths. 
One of the main practical drawbacks of these devices for surgical 
use is that they are much more sensitive to motion, lacking spatial 
cues in individual scan lines, rendering vision-based registration 
techniques unsuitable. There are practical limitations to mount- 
ing these cameras on surgical imaging equipment. Scanning mech- 
anisms need to be mounted with imaging spectrographs, adding 
weight, complexity and the potential for misalignment. Further- 
more, even the most compact spectrograph designs are relatively 
large even without the imaging sensor, which would prevent their 
use in hand-held devices such as laparoscopes (typical MIS cam- 
eras weigh < 100 g). New systems, such as the Snapscan (IMEC, 
Belgium) aim to counter these limitations by integrating scanning, 
spectral dispersion and detection in a single unit. Although a much 
more robust design, its weight (~500 g) remains a factor when 
considering mechanical constraints. 
The footprint of snapshot devices, particularly sensors of the 
type shown in Fig. 2 (d), is comparable to conventional cameras 
already used clinically and the design is mechanically robust. 
The strength of this method in surgery is that it is immune to 
motion-induced misalignments, thus enabling capture of fast pro- 
cesses and delivery of functional information to the clinician in 
real-time. These devices have been demonstrated in neurosurgery 
( Pichette et al., 2016 ), ﬂexible endoscopy ( Luthman et al., 2018 ; 
Wang et al., 2018 ), and retinal imaging ( Firn and Khoobehi, 2015 ). 
Nevertheless, there remains some important considerations when 
considering a sensor of this type. Snapshot acquisition requires 
the 3D datacube to be distributed on a 2D sensor, meaning that 
capture speed comes at the expense of spatial resolution and/or 
the number of available wavebands. The type of ﬁlter used by the 
sensor should also be considered when choosing an application- 
speciﬁc imager. Signal cross-talk between adjacent pixels may be- 
come signiﬁcant in mosaic-type sensors, where pixel-level ﬁlters 
are used, leading to further degradation of spatial resolution. In 
the case of interference ﬁlters, the transmission bandwidth and 
centre wavelength is dependant on the distribution of angles of 
incoming light ( Frey et al., 2015 ). Therefore, careful characterisa- 
tion of the imaging optics is needed, with the ﬁnal spectral reso- 
lution determined by the ratio of the camera focal length to the 
diameter of the entrance pupil (the system’s F-number). This may 
vary signiﬁcantly between surgical scenarios and the optical instru- 
ments shown in Fig. 2 (e–h). Interpretation of signals from these 
pixel-level sensors is also complicated by the spectral response of 
the ﬁlters themselves, with some containing prominent side-lobes 
and secondary passbands, which result in signiﬁcant cross-talk be- 
tween the blue and red ends of the spectrum ( Wirkert et al., 2018 ; 
Wisotzky et al., 2019 ). 
Recognising the trade-offs that must be made between spa- 
tial, spectral and temporal resolution, and bound by experimental 
constraints, many researchers have adopted a two-stage develop- 
ment process, using high spectral resolution HSI scanning devices 
for initial exploratory work and then proceeding to more stream- 
lined and eﬃcient MSI systems. This necessitates data reduction 
techniques to isolate the spectral bands in HSI datacubes that 
contain the most clinically-signiﬁcant information without com- 
promising on speciﬁcity or sensitivity. Wirkert et al. (2014) anal- 
ysed surgical datacubes comprised of 30 wavelengths, captured 
using an LCTF-based system, and used an information theory- 
based approach to identify eight optimal bands for oxygen sat- 
uration estimation. This meant that the imaging hardware could 
be switched to a fast ﬁlter-wheel platform. A similar approach 
was taken by ( Kiyotoki et al., 2013 ) to identify ﬁve bands that 
would optimally discriminate between adenomatous and normal 
tissue in the colon. Reducing the number of wavebands brings sev- 
eral advantages, including reducing the data storage burden, en- 
abling use of high throughput transmission ﬁlters, and limiting 
the impact of tissue motion through faster datacube acquisition 
time. 
Given the dynamic nature of the operating theatre, speed re- 
mains an important performance metric of surgical imaging sys- 
tems in general. Of the SSI systems surveyed here and listed in 
Table 1 it is unsurprising that the snapshot methods boast the 
highest acquisition rates. Those based on RGB camera hardware 
can typically operate at 30 fps while more recently-developed 
tiled/mosaic sensors can acquire at up to 90 fps. Both spatial 
and spectral scanning methods are considerably slower, with most 
achieving framerates of less than 0.5 fps. Just one of the cases 
reported speeds approaching video rate, using an optimised ﬁl- 
ter wheel setup running at 15 fps ( Fawzy et al., 2015 ). The next 
closest to this used fast-switching light sources ( Hohmann et al., 
2011 ; Olweny et al., 2013 ; Ma et al., 2016a ) and ﬁlter wheels 
( Wirkert et al., 2016 ). The most signiﬁcant remaining bottleneck 
though, is the processing method used. The computation times as- 
sociated with each of the techniques is less than 1 fps in most 
cases, with the 133 fps convolutional neural network (CNN)-based 
method quoted by Wirkert et al. (2018) standing alone as a truly 
videorate/realtime example. Even allowing for the wide variety of 
processing techniques, datacube sizes, computer hardware and im- 
plementation it seems clear that handling these datasets remains 
a challenge. With this in mind it is worth considering what ‘real- 
time’ means in the context of the surgical application before pur- 
suing speed over other performance metrics. For example, a single 
processed image showing a map of oxygenation or perfusion, pro-

7 
cessed in a couple of seconds, may be just as clinically valuable 
as a continuous, realtime measure of the same scene. Conversely, 
an SSI-supported vision system to identify early-stage precancer- 
ous lesions during exploratory procedures would have much higher 
temporal demands. 
2.5. Commercial systems and clinical translation 
Commercial activity in spectral imaging devices has increased 
steadily over the past decade and there are now several options 
from OEM-scale sensors to complete systems spanning a range 
of application areas. Table 2 summarises the range of currently- 
available systems, along with references to research articles in 
which they have been cited. Perhaps the most notable recent de- 
velopment is the continued reﬁnement of snapshot sensors, which 
have dramatically reduced the hardware footprint and increased 
acquisition speed, both prerequisites for surgical use. As this tech- 
nology begins the mature the variety of sensors has grown. The 
Ocean Insight (formerly Ocean Optics/Pixelteq) PixelCam can de- 
liver six bands in the visible range, while IMEC have a range of 
tiled and mosaic sensors available from different camera manu- 
facturers (Ximea, PhotonFocus) spanning visible and near-infrared 
wavelengths. The CMS range from Silios Technologies includes mo- 
saic sensors comprising eight ﬁltered and one monochrome (i.e., 
unﬁltered) channel. 
Commercial spectral scanning devices using tuneable light 
sources are available from Optronic Laboratories (OL-490), but 
scanning in detection is more common, with LCTF (Perkin Elmer 
Nuance/Maestro) and ﬁlter wheel options (Ocean Insight Spec- 
troCam). Pushbroom scanning imagers, like the Hyspex (Norsk 
Elektro-Optikk), have been most commonly-used in skin imaging, 
where there is a greater degree of control over potential tissue- 
camera motion. 
Clinical translation remains limited, with few systems on the 
market for human use. The hyperspectral TIVITA series imagers 
(Diaspective Vision GmbH, Germany) have options for general 
tissue imaging, wound-healing and surgery, and have demon- 
strated potential utility in gastric anastomoses ( Köhler et al., 2019 ) 
and colorectal transection margins ( Jansen-Winkeln et al., 2019 ) 
( Fig. 3 ). The multispectral HyperView (Hypermed Imaging, Inc., 
USA) and Snapshot NIR (Kent Imaging, Inc., Canada) are hand- 
held devices for perfusion and oximetry ( Hartwig et al., 2016 ). An 
earlier iteration of the HyperView system, the OxyVu, was also 
used to characterise burn depth in animal models ( Chin et al., 
2016 ). Both can generate maps of relative haemoglobin concen- 
tration and oxygen saturation, while the TIVITA system provides 
additional indices relating to perfusion and water content. Com- 
plete systems for small animal imaging in vivo , such as the Maestro 
(Perkin Elmer, Inc., USA), have been used to collect spectral imag- 
ing data from head-and-neck cancer xenografts ( Lu et al., 2015 ; 
Halicek et al., 2019 ). 
3. Spectral image analysis 
After acquisition, the most fundamental processing step that is 
carried out on the datacube is to convert the reﬂected intensity 
measurements to reﬂectance spectra by correcting for the system’s 
spectral sensitivity, normally achieved using a reference reﬂectance 
standard measurement ( Lu and Fei, 2014 ). These spectra can be 
further converted to absorbence by taking the negative logarithm 
of reﬂectance. Interpretation of these results and quantiﬁcation of 
tissue properties can then be achieved using light-tissue interac- 
tion models ( Section 3.1 ) or data science techniques ( Section 3.2 ).

perfused tissue after separation of the marginal artery. The location of this bor-

lowing inspection. See Table 2 for acquisition details. Image taken from Jansen-

3.1. Light propagation models for surgery 
If it is assumed that the forward process of light propagation 
is well-described by mathematical models or simulations then the 
inverse problem may yield the tissue properties of interest from 
spectral measurements. An approximation of the total absorption 
coeﬃcient of a tissue ( μa,tissue ) under investigation can be calcu- 
lated, using Eq. (1) , as a linear sum of the contributors described 
in Section 1.1 : 
μa,tissue = ε Hb c Hb + ε Hb O 2 c Hb O 2 + ε water c water + ε fat c fat + ε bili c bili 
(1) 
where c [M or mol cm −3 ] and ε [ M −1 cm −1 ] represent the con- 
centration and speciﬁc molar extinction coeﬃcient, respectively, of 
deoxyhaemoglobin ( Hb ), oxyhaemoglobin ( HbO 2 ), water, lipids ( fat ) 
and bilirubin ( bili ). Jacques (2013) has compiled a set of numeri- 
cal values and typical volume fractions for various organs that can 
be used with Eq. (1) to generate a realistic tissue absorption spec- 
trum. Losses due to scattering from the continuum of particle sizes 
may be described by Mie scattering theory, which assumes spher- 
ical scatterers and generally predicts a smooth decrease with in- 
creasing wavelength. Subcellular particles having diameters smaller 
than the wavelength of light are subject to the Rayleigh limit 
( Tuchin, 2015b ). Therefore, the observed reduced scattering coeﬃ- 
cient ( μs ’ ) is a combination of both regimes and is often described 
by the empirical model shown in Eq. (2) ( Hidovi ´c-Rowe and Clar- 
idge, 2005 ; Jacques, 2013 ; Mourant et al., 2014 ; Pichette et al., 
2016 ): 
μ′ 
s = a λ−b 
(2) 
where λ is wavelength, a is a scaling factor and b is termed the 
scattering power , indicating the strength of the effect. 
A common method to obtain the absorption and scattering 
coeﬃcients from reﬂectance data is to perform iterative ﬁtting

on a forward model based on diffusion theory ( Spott et al., 
1998 ). This has been used successfully with point probes 
in the pancreas to identify adenocarcinomas and pancreatitis 
( Wilson et al., 2009 ). This was expanded to HSI of the skin by 
Randeberg et al. (2010) and allows calculation of relative concen- 
trations of absorbers, scatterer size and distribution, and estima- 
tion of blood vessel density ( Randeberg et al., 2005 ). This is a 
computationally-expensive process for imaging, given the complex- 
ity of the model and number of free variables, to solve the inverse 
problem iteratively and requires more advanced parallel computing 
methods ( Bjorgan and Randeberg, 2015 ). 
A simpler approach uses the modiﬁed Beer-Lambert law 
( Villringer and Chance, 1997 ), which states that absorbence ( A ) is 
proportional to the concentration ( c ) of the light-absorbing com- 
pound and the distance that the light travels through the tissue 
( L ). The constant of proportionality is the extinction coeﬃcient ( ε) 
and there is an offset term ( G ) to account for scattering losses, ap- 
proximated as being wavelength-independent ( Eq. (3) ): 
A ( λ) = Lcε ( λ) + G ;μa = cε 
(3) 
A differential pathlength correction factor ( DPF ), determined 
experimentally ( Pichette et al., 2016 ), or using computer simula- 
tions ( Hillman, 2007 ), may also be included to correct wavelength- 
dependant variations in L . To simplify calculations for SSI an ‘equal 
pathlength’ assumption can be made, and the DPF and L incorpo- 
rated with c , which becomes a relative concentration . 
If A is measured using the SSI device, and ε is known a pri- 
ori , then Eq. (3) can be solved using linear least squares regres- 
sion to compute the relative concentrations and G . Subsequent 
calculation of total haemoglobin ( THb = c HbO2 + c Hb ) and oxy- 
gen saturation ( SO 2 = c HbO2 / THb ), can then be easily achieved. 
Eq. (3) can be solved analytically, making it attractive for fast 
processing over an entire image, and has been used to quan- 
tify haemoglobin and perfusion-related variables in the heart 
( Nighswander-Rempel et al., 2003 ), bowel ( Clancy et al., 2015 ), 
uterus ( Clancy et al., 2016a ), skin ( Zuzak et al., 2002 ) and mam- 
mary carcinomas ( Sorg et al., 2005 ). Calculations can also be sig- 
niﬁcantly simpliﬁed if some experimental constraints are applied. 
If temporal changes are relevant, in a study of brain activity to var- 
ious stimuli, for example, then SSI data acquired from the same 
stationary tissue area can be analysed to calculate changes in 
chromophore concentration, as the pathlength terms cancel out 
( Bouchard et al., 2009 ). 
Computer simulations of photon propagation in tissue can be 
used to form a forward model, avoiding some of the assumptions 
made by diffusion theory and Beer-Lambert. Claridge and Hidovi ´c- 
Rowe (2014) have developed an image analysis method based on 
a multilayer Monte Carlo (MC) model for examining pathologi- 
cal changes in the mucosa of bowel tissue ex vivo . The model is 
used to simulate reﬂectance spectra for ranges of tissue optical 
properties. These spectra are ﬁtted to experimental results in a 
fast iterative process that uses the Kubelka-Munk approximation 
of diffuse reﬂectance as part of the optimisation process ( Hidovi ´c 
and Rowe, 2004 ; Hidovi ´c-Rowe and Claridge, 2005 ; Claridge et al., 
2007 ). Wirkert et al. (2016) also employed a forward Monte Carlo 
model to estimate the tissue properties. In this case, multiple sim- 
ulations for varying tissue oxygenation and blood volume condi- 
tions were used to train a random forest regressor and achieve 
rapid processing of high-resolution multispectral images during 
MIS (imaging and regression times of 400 ms and 180 ms, respec- 
tively). 
3.2. Multivariate regression and classiﬁcation algorithms 
The previous section included an outline of analytical and lin- 
ear regression methods used to unmix individual spectral contrib- 
utors to the observed reﬂectance signal based on some assump- 
tions and a priori knowledge of the principal chromophores. How- 
ever, a purely data-driven method using a statistical model treating 
spectral data as predictors can avoid the assumptions of physical 
models. These are well-suited for imaging applications due to their 
computational eﬃciency and ability to detect subtle differences be- 
tween classes. This is an attractive proposition in surgical segmen- 
tation problems, where lesions or anatomical structures of interest 
may have broadly similar reﬂectance characteristics to background 
tissue. 
The review by Lu and Fei (2014) contains an overview of many 
of the most commonly-used statistical analysis methods applied to 
medical spectral images in general. For HSI this can include an ini- 
tial dimensionality-reduction step, achieved using principal com- 
ponent analysis (PCA), minimum noise fraction (MNF) or indepen- 
dent component analysis (ICA), to extract the most information- 
rich spectral features and reduce redundancy in the data. These 
techniques transform the data into a subspace where it is arranged 
according to the amount of variance, thus enabling separation of 
different contributors to the signal, such as tumourous and healthy 
tissue ( Lu et al., 2014 ; Chung et al., 2016 ). In addition to identi- 
ﬁcation of diagnostic signals, this type of approach can also be 
used to reduce noise in the datacube by keeping only the trans- 
formed bands with high signal-to-noise ratio ( Bjorgan and Ran- 
deberg, 2015 ). Dimensionality reduction helps to avoid overﬁtting 
problems associated with unsupervised methods such as k-means 
clustering, when used as a pre-processing step ( Torti et al., 2018 ). 
K-means, which iteratively assigns pixels to ‘cluster centres’ by 
minimising their Euclidian distance, has been used to identify can- 
cer of the breast ( Khouj et al., 2018 ), colon ( Baltussen et al., 2019 ) 
and brain ( Torti et al., 2018 ), as well as hyperplasia in the en- 
dometrium ( Kavvadias et al., 2013 ). 
Examples of supervised classiﬁers that have been used with SSI 
data are support vector machines (SVM) and spectral angle map- 
ping (SAM). An advantage of SVMs is that they are robust to noisy, 
high-dimensional data, thus not requiring a feature selection step 
( Camps-Valls and Bruzzone, 2005 ). Akbari et al. (2012) used an 
SVM to classify cancerous and normal tissue in lung and lymph 
tissue histology slides, achieving 93–96% sensitivity and 98% speci- 
ﬁcity, while Hohmann et al. (2017) reported 57–66% sensitivity 
and 52–62% speciﬁcity for fresh tissue samples of gastric adeno- 
mas. Han et al. (2016) conducted an in vivo colonoscopy study 
with a ﬁve-band MSI system and classiﬁed adenomas with 95% 
sensitivity and 89% speciﬁcity. Spectral features can also be com- 
bined with measures of local texture to improve classiﬁcation ac- 
curacy of SVM ( Zhang et al., 2016 ). Intrinsic measures of uncer- 
tainty, using the Gini coeﬃcient, have demonstrated further im- 
provements in performance ( Fig. 4 ) by identifying and excluding 
low accuracy superpixel subregions ( Moccia et al., 2018 ). This al- 
lows automatic tagging of tissues in vivo with 96% accuracy when 
used with an 8-band multispectral datacube. SAM treats individual 
spectra as high-dimensional vectors, differentiating regions or tis- 
sue types using the angle between them. This has the advantage 
of being robust to variations in illumination strength or shadows 
( Martin et al., 2012 ). 
Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) and, more speciﬁcally, deep 
learning with CNNs have recently seen growth in detection, classi- 
ﬁcation and segmentation problems in a variety of medical imag- 
ing modalities due to their eﬃcient architecture and use of local 
context ( Shen et al., 2017 ). Recent applications in spectral imag- 
ing analysis include use of CNNs to differentiate abdominal organs 
( Akbari et al., 2008b ), and detect gastric ( Hu et al., 2019 ) and head- 
and-neck cancers ( Halicek et al., 2017 , 2019 ). Reported accuracy in 
these studies is high ( > 95%) and a recent comparative study also 
suggests that CNNs may out-perform competing supervised clas- 
siﬁcation methods, such as SVMs ( Halicek et al., 2017 ). CNNs can

incorporate multiple processing steps within the overall network 
architecture, including pre-processing calibration steps, within the 
network, which optimises speed when compared to other regres- 
sors such as random forests ( Ayala et al., 2019 ). By avoiding more 
tailored regression approaches, CNNs may capture subtle signal 
variations that support interpretation or classiﬁcation much more 
effectively. This would be logical given the performance increases 
demonstrated through deep learning in general computer vision 
and signal analysis problems. 
The main limitation of these machine learning methods in gen- 
eral is that accuracy depends on the available labelled training 
data. This is a problem in surgical imaging, where a well-deﬁned 
gold standard is lacking, and inter and intrapatient variability is 
large but the quantity of datasets is extremely limited. Common 
solutions used to boost training data are to use transformations 
(e.g., rotation, translation), pretrained networks and to use image 
patches ( Shen et al., 2017 ). Previous work in other medical imaging 
modalities has also combined separate datasets in an effort to bet- 
ter represent variability across patients ( Shin et al., 2016 ). Trans- 
fer learning, where a pre-trained network is adapted for use in a 
new setting, is a potential solution, and has already seen use in 
other medical image analysis problems, where available training 
data are insuﬃcient ( Signoroni et al., 2019 ). Wirkert et al. (2017) 
have recently demonstrated the potential of using this technique 
to adapt a network, trained on a generic simulated tissue, to unla- 
belled in vivo datasets. Recent efforts in developing unsupervised 
learning may translate to SSI problems and additional potential 
could be explored by training on phantom or controlled environ- 
ments prior to ﬁne tuning networks using small datasets of clinical 
data. In histopathology some recent effort s have shown that net- 
works could capture information typically extracted through con- 
trast agents and staining ( Pei et al., 2019 ; Talo, 2019 ) and a similar 
methodology could be pursued in SSI. 
Another challenge related to variability, and inherent in the 
ambiguous nature of the problem, is the fact that the map- 
ping between measured optical signals and estimated physiolog- 
ical variables may not be one-to-one. To address this problem 
Ardizzone et al. (2019) has proposed invertible neural networks 
(INNs), which aim to learn the posterior probability distribution 
and represent ambiguity in the solution. This has recently been ap- 
plied to MSI imaging of the brain ( Adler et al., 2019 ). 
3.3. Estimating spectral information from RGB 
Deducing the underlying spectral properties of tissue using 
standard colour cameras would be a convenient way to realise 
an SSI system. The challenge here is that the inverse problem is 
ill-posed, with many different combinations of component spec- 
tra capable of producing a given RGB response. Regression mod- 
els between MC-simulated spectra and observed RGB values en- 
able calculation of relative concentrations of HbO 2 , Hb and melanin 
( Nishidate et al., 2008 , 2011 ). Their accuracy, however, is subject 
to the MC model being a good match to reality. Variation in tis- 
sue layer thickness and/or scattering properties are not accounted 
for and contribute to errors in the estimated concentration val- 
ues. Wiener estimation, alternatively, predicts the reﬂectance spec- 
trum of an object using a priori knowledge of the camera’s spec- 
tral sensitivity and the reﬂectance spectrum of the object un- 
der test ( Stigell et al., 2007 ). This has been used to estimate 
melanin and haemoglobin concentrations in skin ( Nishidate et al., 
2013 ), scattering variables in the brain ( Yoshida et al., 2015 ; 
Hasnat et al., 2016 ) and bowel oxygen saturation ( Jones et al., 
2016 ). Lin et al. (2017) demonstrated that a CNN could be used to 
estimate ﬁne spectral data from RGB laparoscopic images. Strong 
qualitative agreement with reference MSI data was shown, al- 
though large errors at some wavelengths were noted. Subsequent 
work improved accuracy by adding sparsely-sampled high spectral 
resolution data to update and reﬁne the CNN result ( Lin et al., 
2018b ). Li et al., 2019 has modiﬁed this approach using a condi- 
tional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to bypass the spectral 
estimation step and generate maps of oxygen saturation directly. 
4. Data assessment and validation 
A clear validation process is necessary to understand the ca- 
pabilities of a given SSI system, quantify its accuracy and under- 
stand variability across different hardware conﬁgurations and clin- 
ical settings. Validation data may be obtained from experiments 
using computer simulation, tissue phantoms, resected tissue, or in 
vivo measurements. 
4.1. In silico 
Monte Carlo models have become the gold standard for pho- 
ton transport simulations in tissue. Their ﬂexible conﬁguration al- 
lows for modelling of simple semi-inﬁnite homogeneous media to 
complex multi-layered tissue ( Prahl et al., 1989 ; Wang et al., 1995 ) 
with inclusions simulating blood vessels ( Jones et al., 2017b ) or le- 
sions ( de Jode, 20 0 0 ). This offers advantages in accuracy over com- 
peting simulation and mathematical modelling techniques such as 
those based on diffusion theory ( Flock et al., 1989 ) and it has 
been widely applied in biomedical photon propagation simulation 
problems ( Zhu and Liu, 2013 ; Periyasamy and Pramanik, 2017 ). In 
spectrally-resolved imaging studies MC modelling has shown par- 
ticular utility in estimating the wavelength dependence of the DPF 
( Ma et al., 2016a ; Thatcher et al., 2016 ) and in generating inverse 
models to extract quantitative tissue optical properties via error 
minimisation ( Saccomandi et al., 2016 ; Wirkert et al., 2016 ). 
More recently, Wirkert et al. (2016) and Ayala et al. (2019) have 
used MC simulation to quantify the performance of a random for- 
est estimator using varying noise and SNR conditions, and demon- 
strated improved accuracy data compared to least-squares re- 
gression. They were also able to optimise the computationally- 
expensive training step by demonstrating that the absolute error

11 
stabilised after 10 4 training samples. Jones et al. (2017b) used a 
mesh-based Monte Carlo model, based on blood and submucosa 
optical properties, to generate a synthetic reﬂectance dataset. This 
allowed comparison of an RGB-based oxygen saturation estimation 
algorithm with a multispectral Beer-Lambert-based regression. The 
simulation results were convolved with known spectral sensitiv- 
ity curves of a standard colour camera and an LCTF MSI system 
to generate digital datacubes, demonstrating an improvement in 
prediction accuracy of 10% in the RGB result when using Tikhonov 
regularisation. 
It is essential that these MC models are capable of encap- 
sulating the full range of real, physical, variability in tissue if 
accurate measures of physiological properties can be inferred. 
Principal component analysis provides a useful measure of as- 
sessing how well real data can be explained by the model. 
Wirkert et al. (2017) were able to demonstrate that 97% of the 
variance in their in vivo data lay on the simulated data’s ﬁrst 
three principal components. It was also illustrative to see that 
one particular organ, the gallbladder, was an exception and fell 
outside this, indicating a limitation in the MC simulation (pos- 
sibly consideration of bile as a signiﬁcant absorber). Similarly, 
Styles et al. (2006) showed that simulation results did not encom- 
pass the space occupied by in vivo data from fundus imaging ex- 
periments, but a correction in the form of an empirical scaling fac- 
tor could correct the problem. 
4.2. Phantom and in vitro 
A common ﬁrst step in validation of spectral measurement ac- 
curacy is to test the imaging system against a set of standard- 
ised targets with varying spectral properties, such as a Macbeth- 
type colour-checker card ( Clancy et al., 2016b , 2018 ; Wang et al., 
2018 ). These provide a set of calibrated colour tiles with smoothly- 
varying reﬂectance spectra. A mean spectrum for a small region- 
of-interest within each tile is calculated and compared to a gold 
standard spectrum obtained with a high-resolution spectrometer. 
This allows researchers to assess the performance of the SSI system 
across the spectral range. These targets are useful for establishing 
device baseline spectral accuracy and SNR, although the broad na- 
ture of the reﬂectance features make them unsuitable for quanti- 
fying spectral resolution or evaluating spectral unmixing. An esti- 
mate of an SSI system’s ability to recover chromophore concentra- 
tions on a diverse background of optical loss mechanisms can only 
be achieved with more realistic tissue models. 
In vitro models with tuneable optical properties provide an op- 
portunity to test more complex functionality of the imaging sys- 
tem under more realistic, but still controlled, conditions ( Fig. 5 (a)). 
These so-called phantoms can, in their simplest form, be dye solu- 
tions to test spectral unmixing methods ( Pichette et al., 2016 ) and 
the ability of the system to resolve the spatial location of differ- 
ent chromophores. More complex and physiologically-realistic op- 
tical properties can be achieved with multi-layer agar-based phan- 
toms, with absorption and scattering properties set using India ink 
and intralipid, respectively ( Nishidate et al., 2011 , 2013 ). More rele- 
vant phantoms incorporate blood or haemoglobin, and include ref- 
erence gas probes in tandem with temperature, pH, ﬂow and oxy- 
genation control ( Saito and Yamaguchi, 2015 ; Sakota et al., 2015 ; 
Tetschke et al., 2016 ; Gehrung et al., 2019 ). Realistic models include 
both solid and liquid elements, with simulated vessels running 
through an agarose tissue ( Luthman et al., 2018 ). The simulated 
vessels can further be formed into complex patterns, using rapid 
prototyping techniques, based on images of real vascular networks 
( Ghassemi et al., 2015 ). The phantom material’s temporal stability 
must be considered if repeat measurements are needed, as agar 
and gelatine are vulnerable to decay and bacterial growth without 
specialist storage and treatment ( Pogue and Patterson, 2006 ). Al- 
ternative materials such as gelwax ( Maneas et al., 2018 ), polyvinyl 
chloride plastisol ( Fonseca et al., 2016 ), silicone ( de Bruin et al., 
2010 ) and polymer gels ( Cabrelli et al., 2017 ) are capable of offer- 
ing long-term stability. The complexity of these models does not 
typically extend to include confounding absorbers, such as biliru- 
bin, or complex structures, such as colonic crypts, that may affect 
measured spectra. Apart from ﬂow, dynamic effects such as peri- 
stalsis or inﬂammatory response are also diﬃcult to replicate. 
4.3. Ex vivo 
Spectral imaging systems are increasingly being looked to as 
potential tools for optical biopsy . That is, to obtain quantitative di- 
agnostic information which is currently the preserve of histological 
analysis. Diagnosis of disease in its early stages or separation of le- 
sions depending on their malignant potential are examples of such 
problems. In these cases the lesions may be small and superﬁcial, 
and their appearance may be indistinguishable from surrounding 
normal tissue under white light illumination. Investigation of po- 
tential optical sensitivity to these pathologies, with their myriad 
biochemical differences, is outside the scope of synthetic models 
and can only be accomplished in real tissue. The initial step is to 
form a picture of the optical properties of each tissue type of inter- 
est. Assuming there is no a priori knowledge this means acquiring 
high resolution spectral data at as many wavelengths as possible. 
These data can then be analysed to determine where spectral dif- 
ferences may lie. 
However, depending on the tissue in question, the ability to ob- 
tain in vivo data may be limited due to challenging experimen- 
tal conditions. In these cases exploratory data is usually acquired 
from tissue after it has been resected. The advantages of this are 
that data collection has minimal impact on the surgical work- 
ﬂow, imaging can be performed in a controlled, motion-free, en- 
vironment, and the sample will subsequently proceed to pathology 
for ground truth histological conﬁrmation. This approach has been 
used to study the spectral characteristics of cancers in head & neck 
( Akbari et al., 2012 ), colon ( Leavesley et al., 2016 ) and pancreas 
( Kiris et al., 2015 ). The major limitation is that the blood supply 
is immediately cut off once the tissue is excised. Given the inﬂu- 
ence of haemoglobin on tissue reﬂectance, the effect on the optical 
properties may be signiﬁcant and unpredictable. Disease-speciﬁc 
signatures based on oxygenation become less distinct. A complex 
series of events characterise tissue degradation and drift in tissue 
optical properties in the ﬁrst few hours post excision, including 
osmosis, shrinkage and ischaemia-induced scattering changes, de- 
pending on how the sample is stored ( Hsiung et al., 2005 ). 
Machine perfusion techniques, developed to preserve harvested 
organs for transplantation, may offer a potential solution to some 
of the challenges associated with validation of SSI in physiolog- 
ically realistic scenarios ( Fig. 5 (b)). These machines pump blood 
through the organ’s vessels while maintaining normothermic con- 
ditions and can allow oxygenation control ( Tetschke et al., 2016 ). 
Careful preparation of the organ in question is required, using sim- 
ilar protocols to transplantation retrieval, to ensure minimal dam- 
age to the tissue. 
4.4. In vivo 
Intraoperative validation remains a challenging task due to the 
limited control over physiological variables and multiple sources 
of measurement noise from both biological signals and motion- 
induced artefacts. Nevertheless this is an essential testbed in the 
developmental cycle of a surgical imaging system, providing in- 
sight into its future clinical utility. One approach to mitigating 
the inﬂuence of the aforementioned complications is to tempo- 
rally measure relative changes in response to a stimulus, such as a

vessel occlusion, and monitor the instrument’s response. This has 
been reported in imaging experiments, following mechanical oc- 
clusion, on the skin ( Nishidate et al., 2013 ), bowel ( Clancy et al., 
2015 ) and kidney ( Best et al., 2011 ). Similar induction of hypoxia 
has also been achieved in rodents by restricting the fraction of in- 
spired oxygen ( Akter et al., 2017 ; Nishidate et al., 2018 ). Estima- 
tion of in-band noise and camera signal-to-noise ratio were made 
by Wirkert et al. (2016) during vascular occlusion of a pig bowel 
segment and correlated to in silico experiments. 
Absolute quantiﬁcation of tissue constituents in vivo is more 
diﬃcult due to the lack of gold standard measurement modali- 
ties that are directly comparable to optical imaging results. Per- 
haps the most recognisable clinical oxygen saturation device, the 
pulse oximeter, provides measurements of systemic arterial, rather 
than local tissue, oxygenation. Machines for biochemical analysis of 
blood, such as the co-oximeter, are another frequently used clini- 
cal tool, and can provide detailed biochemical information. This in- 
cludes gas partial pressures, haemoglobin concentrations and lac- 
tate levels, which is a surrogate marker of oxygenation. Imaging 
results have been validated using blood gas analysis from locally- 
drawn samples ( Clancy et al., 2015 ) and, in an SFDI study, cal- 
ibrated optical oxygenation probes ( Gioux et al., 2011 ). Interpre- 
tation of these types of single-point validation measurements is 
inevitably complicated by the fact that each technique probes a 
different volume of tissue, leading to some deviation in absolute 
values, although temporal trends agree. The problem is especially 
acute for blood gas analysis, where even microlitre-scale samples 
must be drawn from a comparatively large vessel that is not nec- 
essarily representative of the mixture of arterial and venous mi- 
crovessels running through the organ-of-interest. 
Models for delineating tumour boundaries have been evalu- 
ated in terms of accuracy ( Panasyuk et al., 2007 ), and true and 
false positive rates when compared to histological gold standard 
and manually-segmented images ( Panasyuk et al., 2007 ; Han et al., 
2016 ). In vivo classiﬁcation accuracy has also been assessed, using 
leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), for an SVM-based algo- 
rithm to identify atherosclerotic plaques ( Chihara et al., 2016 ) and 
deep neural network methods to predict tissue reﬂectance spectra 
( Lin et al., 2018b ). While diagnostic accuracy in a single lesion can 
be evaluated in this way, there is still a question over the accuracy 
of the margin delineation. This is due to the small sample size of 
the gold standard, which ultimately is derived from a biopsy sec- 
tion a few millimetres in diameter. 
Despite the diﬃculties associated with in vivo validation of 
optical properties, intraoperative MSI and HSI datasets are well- 
suited to testing the performance of computational RGB-to-SSI ap- 
proaches. In these cases the spectral datacubes themselves can be 
treated as the ground truth ( Fig. 5 (c)). Jones et al. (2017a) derived a 
test set of RGB images from an intraoperative MSI dataset using the 
spectral sensitivity curves of a standard colour camera. The pro- 
posed computational method predicted SO 2 with mean error less 
than 10%, compared to the MSI result. A similar approach was used 
by Lin et al. (2018b) to test the accuracy of a deep neural network 
spectral reconstruction algorithm, showing that mean relative er- 
rors as low as 0.63% between predicted and reference spectra could 
be achieved. Nishidate et al. (2013) incorporated a beam-splitter 
in the set-up to obtain reﬂectance spectra from the surface of the 
skin in parallel with RGB measurements, enabling them to demon- 
strate qualitative similarity between the spectra with an average 
relative SO 2 estimation error of 54.5%.

There are some well-known resources for established med- 
ical imaging modalities such as CT/MRI where researchers 
may access annotated image data. Examples include The Can- 
cer Imaging Archive (TCIA; https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/ ) 
( Clark et al., 2013 ), open-CAS ( http://opencas.webarchiv.kit.edu ), 
the EndoVIS challenge ( https://endovis.grand-challenge.org ) and 
DeepLesion ( https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/DeepLesion ) ( Yan et al., 
2018 ). The largest of these databases is still 3–4 orders of magni- 
tude smaller than natural image datasets such as ImageNET ( http: 
//www.image-net.org ). SSI is lagging much further behind still and 
there are very few publicly-available datasets. As an initial step re- 
searchers in the ﬁeld should make their data available on insti- 
tutional servers, following the example of groups working in en- 
doscopy ( Yoon et al., 2019a , 2019b ), neuroimaging ( Fabelo et al., 
2019b , 2019a ), ophthalmology ( A. Gebejes et al., 2016 , 2016 ) and 
histology ( Awan et al., 2018b , 2018a ). When published, these data 
should be accompanied by a readme ﬁle containing a brief descrip- 
tion of the study and associated protocol, links to related publica- 
tions and a clear statement on any usage restrictions. The key aim 
is to enable an external researcher to reproduce the results of the 
original team using the information supplied. 
While a DICOM-equivalent standard for SSI may still be some 
way off, metadata, either embedded or stored as a separate ﬁle, 
should be included with each acquisition. A suggested format 
is to include Patient/Subject ID (anonymised), timestamp, spec- 
tral channel information (e.g., central wavelength, band FWHM, 
pixel-to-wavelength calibration data [for push/whiskbroom sys- 
tems]), camera/detector settings (exposure time, gain, bit depth), 
reference reﬂectance spectrum and background intensity measure- 
ments. For SSI systems where the spectral characteristic of a par- 
ticular channel is not easily described by a Gaussian shape, the 
ﬁlter/illumination spectrum data or a link to manufacturer speci- 
ﬁcations should be provided. A second layer of related information 
could include image annotations, either in the form of regions- 
of-interest with deﬁned co-ordinates or binary masks to delin- 
eate separate organs, tissues or lesions. Labels linked to these spa- 
tial data would identify the feature in question and/or the results 
of histological evaluation. Beyond this, future large-scale curated 
imaging databases will require national or international initiatives 
with dedicated funding and resources to maintain submissions and 
ensure quality control. Following the TCIA template this would al- 
low for rigorous validation, version control and accommodation of 
corroborating data such as histology slides, clinical information or 
other medical imaging modalities. 
5. Discussion 
Spectral imaging has become recognised as a valuable method 
of obtaining functional and structural information on tissue non- 
invasively. It has gained widespread uptake in clinical research, 
with the list of applications now spanning dermatology, gas- 
troenterology, gynaecology, otolaryngology, cardiology, haematol- 
ogy, neurology, ophthalmology, bronchoscopy, nephrology and hep- 
atology ( Table 1 ). Strong contrast due to haemoglobin has en- 
abled imaging of blood volume and oxygenation, both important 
variables in the assessment of tissue perfusion and its ability 
to recover from injury. Physiological processes, such as tumour- 
associated angiogenesis or the proliferation of dysplastic cells, can 
be detected through their impact on the absorption and scatter- 
ing components of the tissue’s reﬂectance spectrum. Selection of 
wavelengths that maximise the spectral difference between organs 
or pathologies can be used to optimise SSI device design, and 
solve image segmentation and classiﬁcation problems. Statistical 
and computational tools have allowed this process to be optimised, 
increasing robustness and resolving differences not appreciable un- 
der standard white-light illumination, for example, differentiating 
the thyroid and parathyroid ( Barberio et al., 2018 ). Its usefulness 
as a collaborative tool has also been demonstrated, providing valu- 
able context for other imaging modalities and showing potential in 
assisting guidance and clinical decision-making. 
Spectral imaging has reached something of a crossroads in 
the surgical ﬁeld. Although the principles of the technique have 
long been established the number of attempted clinical stud- 
ies has recently increased rapidly. Fuelled by growing indus- 
trial and remote-sensing demand, readily-available computational 
power and newly-developed software techniques, truly useful SSI 
devices may soon be ready to make the leap into clinical practice. 
The main factors for translation of a new imaging modality in- 
clude three interconnected problems: clinical validation, usability 
and ease-of-interpretation. While SSI has certainly demonstrated 
utility across a wide range of specialties and is clearly sensitive 
to a variety to relevant biological variables ( Table 1 ), it has yet to 
address the crucial question of whether or not it can improve out- 
comes for the patient. This is the diﬃcult next step for the ﬁeld 
as it requires collection of a large amount of data in carefully- 
designed clinical studies. Despite the number of publications on 
the subject very few in vivo studies have been conducted ( Shapey 
et al., 2019 ), most have small sample sizes and are not correlated 
with surgical outcomes. For example, while many studies show 
sensitivity to tissue perfusion and oxygenation none can conclu- 
sively estimate the range of SSI values that represents a ‘healthy’ 
blood supply. Similarly, there is undoubted applicability in tissue 
classiﬁcation and disease detection, but no study that proves that 
SSI can have a signiﬁcant impact on tumour recurrence rates. Clin- 
ical eﬃcacy studies are needed to answer these questions. 
Collection of data to answer clinical eﬃcacy questions requires 
studies on a larger scale than are currently being attempted. This 
places demands on hardware performance and robustness, and 
connects to the second of the aforementioned problems, which in- 
cludes device resolution, speed and mechanical properties. That is, 
a new technology should not compromise the surgeon’s vision of 
the tissue, or their ability to navigate the internal anatomy safely, 
and should have equivalent handling characteristics, i.e., weight, 
size, rigidity, to standard tools. Acquisition and processing speed 
are important, to avoid delays to the normal delivery of care to the 
patient. This problem may be on the cusp of being solved, as the 
gap between high resolution and high-speed systems is becoming 
less distinct. Table 2 shows that commercially-available snapshot 
sensors can now capture MSI datacubes comprising 6–25 spectral 
bands at up to 90 fps. There are also cameras, such as IMEC’s Snap- 
scan , that sacriﬁce some speed to achieve hyperspectral detection 
at megapixel spatial resolution. These devices are monolithic in de- 
sign, with single sensor snapshot cameras in particular offering a 
light weight option. This means that they can be integrated in ex- 
isting surgical optical imaging devices, such as laparoscopes and 
operating microscopes, in an equivalent manner to standard colour 
cameras. 
The third problem emphasises that the processing results 
should be displayed in a concise and eﬃcient manner. i.e., SSI 
should not increase the cognitive burden on the surgeon. The solu- 
tion to this lies in eﬃcient and accurate computation of physiolog- 
ical variables, delineation of diseased tissue and intuitive display of 
the information to the clinician. The question of the optimal way to 
relay this information to the surgeon remains open. Existing scopes 
with enhanced imaging facilities typically allowing the user to tog- 
gle between different modes or to choose an overlay. Augmented 
reality systems ( Bernhardt et al., 2017 ) may be one platform to de- 
liver this information, allowing the surgeon to seamlessly switch 
to SSI or another imaging modality overlay during a procedure. 
The range of acquisition systems summarised in Table 1 and the 
nuances of their individual characteristics illustrates the full range 
of complexity open to a researcher in acquiring data for a speciﬁc

need. Unfortunately, it has resulted in a disparate dataset, lacking 
standardisation, that has hindered development of eﬃcient compu- 
tational algorithms and independent validation and benchmarking. 
The robustness of processing algorithms based on learning will de- 
pend on the reliability of the training data available. This is espe- 
cially important as the reﬂectance spectral signatures of tissue con- 
stituents are broad, and the ability of SSI devices to identify ‘ﬁn- 
gerprints’ of speciﬁc compounds is limited. A well-documented SSI 
dataset is essential in understanding the applicability and limits of 
any newly-developed algorithm. Furthermore, built-in algorithmic 
awareness of variance and uncertainty in a particular model’s per- 
formance will help to ease safety concerns, by restricting diagnos- 
tic decisions to those based on ‘high conﬁdence’ measurements. 
Computational spectral estimation methods using RGB data are 
an exciting proposition as they have the potential to bridge the gap 
between high resolution and high-speed devices, and introduce 
the possibility of software-enabled SSI from conventional cam- 
eras. Accuracy remains a challenge due to the inherent low spec- 
tral resolution of RGB which, at ~100 nm, washes out ﬁne spec- 
tral features that distinguish, for example, oxygenated and deoxy- 
genated haemoglobin. Model and AI-based approaches will need 
to be tested across a wider variety of image data to avoid over- 
ﬁtting to a narrow range of physiological properties. An SSI imag- 
ing database, from which RGB images can also be synthesised, of 
multiple test subjects, organs and pathologies matched with histol- 
ogy is needed. This is a ﬁeld that may become more important as 
rigid endoscopes begin to transition from rod lenses to chip-on-tip. 
Some of the major endoscope manufacturers already have products 
in this area, such as Karl Storz (TIPCAM, C-MAC VS) and Olympus 
(Endoﬂex 3D), and more can be expected as sensor miniaturisation 
continues. 
Idealised databases are challenging to create, requiring mone- 
tary and resource investment in a multi-centre collaboration. The 
time taken to design, set up and conduct the required measure- 
ments is signiﬁcant. However, previous medical imaging work us- 
ing transfer learning ( Litjens et al., 2017 ) has shown that this task 
can be simpliﬁed by using networks trained for other tasks or on 
different sam ples ( Lin et al., 2017 ). This ﬁeld includes methods that 
can be trained on synthetic data and, with minimal retraining, be 
reconﬁgured to work on real data or a completely different sce- 
nario. Thus SSI results could be generalised more easily and each 
new clinical application would not require a separate large-scale 
study to obtain suﬃcient annotated training data ( Wirkert et al., 
2017 ). 
SSI could also take some inspiration from ﬂuorescence image- 
guided surgery (FIGS), which has recently enjoyed an explosion of 
interest, particularly using near-infrared light which does not in- 
terfere with the standard colour imaging. Despite its relative com- 
plexity, which requires exogenous agents and use of a specialised 
camera system, there are now several general systems available 
for use in open, MIS and robotic-assisted MIS. These clinically- 
approved devices are being used in several studies to explore the 
full utility of the technique and determine its eﬃcacy in improv- 
ing surgical procedures. While clinical spectral imaging systems do 
exist, aimed principally at dermatology, a MIS-compatible camera 
is not currently available. This will be needed to instigate long- 
term clinical studies, especially for applications where the problem 
is signiﬁcant but the incidence is low. 
Health economics will play a signiﬁcant role in whether or not 
SSI devices are widely adopted in practice. Ultimately the new 
technology will have to demonstrate that its cost can be recov- 
ered. Miniaturised spectral imaging sensors, although increasingly 
available, are still approximately ﬁve orders of magnitude more 
expensive that standard colour sensors. Given the scale of ex- 
pense associated with some of the clinical problems mentioned 
here, such as management of patients following anastomotic leaks, 
transplant failure, or unnecessary removal of hyperplastic lesions, 
a convincing ﬁnancial case for spectral imaging devices might still 
be formed despite the high initial outlay. Furthermore, SSI meth- 
ods can point to a major advantage over current surgical imaging 
competitors, ﬂuorescence-guidance, in that running costs related to 
purchase of dyes do not apply. Thus, while SSI devices are unlikely 
to become similarly priced to RGB hardware due to the economy of 
scale of manufacturing, they may at least become a realistic com- 
petitor to FIGS. This remains an open question, and one that re- 
quires appropriately-structured clinical trials to yield an answer. 
The above challenges are echoed by recent attempts to 
formalise the translational route for new optical technologies 
( Waterhouse et al., 2019 ). This notes, in addition to the points al- 
ready discussed here, that there is a general problem with a lack 
of standardisation in optical techniques, including metrics of expo- 
sure safety limits. 
6. Conclusions 
Interest in spectral imaging for clinical applications continues 
to grow along with the variety and performance of the technology. 
Potential uses have been found in guidance, viability monitoring 
and disease-detection, exploiting endogenous contrast in the visi- 
ble and near-infrared wavelength range. Increased commercial in- 
terest has seen the development of lightweight, snapshot devices 
equivalent in size to standard cameras that can now be mounted 
on endoscopes or operating microscopes, while high-resolution hy- 
perspectral devices can be mounted on articulated arms. Advances 
in computational modelling, including the use of statistical tech- 
niques and deep learning, has augmented the hardware to increase 
speed and accuracy. Nevertheless, some signiﬁcant challenges re- 
main. 
While SSI has seen increased use in research, most studies are 
small or at proof-of-concept stage and there is still no clinical ap- 
plication where the technique is used routinely. Clinical trials are 
required to establish correlations between SSI signals and surgical 
outcomes. Demonstrating the potential health and economic im- 
pact of the technology will not be possible without this. 
To reach this milestone some hardware reﬁnements are still 
needed to provide seamless switching between real-time colour 
visualisation and spectral acquisition, avoiding the need for ex- 
pert set-up and maximising clinical uptake. The system must pro- 
vide equivalent white light imaging performance to currently-used 
medical cameras to avoid disruption of the clinical workﬂow and 
patient care. Current surgical imaging conﬁgurations, particularly 
in MIS, vary widely, are highly application-speciﬁc and commercial 
systems are not yet optimised for this task. 
Creation of standardised databases of SSI sequences, with ac- 
companying acquisition and calibration metadata, will be essential 
to allow benchmarking of processing algorithms, development of 
computational techniques and independent validation of spectral 
measurements. This will become increasingly important with the 
growing trend toward data-driven processing. This will help to es- 
tablish validation of the measurement technique in vivo in addition 
to any in silico and ex vivo experiments. Computational spectral- 
from-RGB estimation imaging techniques, which are still in their 
infancy, would beneﬁt from these databases, allowing researchers 
to increase their robustness and applicability. 
These challenges must be met in collaboration with both indus- 
trial and clinical partners. A consistent and robust hardware set-up 
will allow reliable data acquisition across multiple hospital depart- 
ments and sites, maximising the impact of any study that is con- 
ducted.
