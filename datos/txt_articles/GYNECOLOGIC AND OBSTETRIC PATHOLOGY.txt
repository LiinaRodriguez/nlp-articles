Background: Prior studies have shown significant differences in disease specific and overall survival between FIGO 1/2 & FIGO 3 
endometrioid carcinomas. The HER2 protein has emerged as a potential anti-tumor target in carcinomas of the breast, 
gastrointestinal tract, and endometrial serous carcinomas, with combinations of the anti-HER2 agent, trastuzumab significantly 
improving outcomes for these patients. HER2 expression has been scarcely studied in high-grade endometrial endometrioid 
adenocarcinoma, and its potential as a possible therapeutic target is currently unknown. We, therefore, aimed to study the 
expression of HER2 in FIGO3 endometrioid carcinomas and to correlate our findings with the clinicopathologic characteristics of 
this tumor. 
Design: All high-grade endometrial carcinomas diagnosed between 2016 & 2021 were reviewed. Cases diagnosed as FIGO2 
endometrioid carcinoma, high-grade serous carcinoma, clear cell & carcinosarcomas were excluded. Only cases diagnosed as 
FIGO3 endometrioid carcinomas were included. HER2 expression by IHC was performed on 10% formalin-fixed paraffin embedded 
tissue and subjected to routine processing. Four micrometer sections of tissue were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and 
eosin (R; Polyclonal, c-erbB-2, Dako). Adequate positive and negative controls were employed. HER2 expression was interpreted 
as negative (0), low (1+ and 2+) or positive (3+) using the current ASCO/CAP guidelines as in the breast. Additional clinical 
information was obtained from the electronic medical records after IRB approval. 
Results: Seventy-five cases of FIGO3 endometrioid carcinomas (Fig 1) were identified. HER2 was negative in 23 (30.7%) cases, 
low in 50 (66.7%) cases and positive in 2 (2.7%) cases (Fig 2). p53 by IHC was performed in 28 cases, with 78.6% of those 
showing a wild-type pattern of expression. p53 wild-type tumors were less likely to be HER2 low and more likely to be HER2 
negative (p=0.047). There was no association between HER2 expression and Endometrial Intraepithelial Neoplasia (EIN), FIGO 
stage, microcystic, elongated and fragmented (MELF) pattern of invasion, mismatch repair (MMR) status or other endometrial 
pathology (Table 1). During a mean follow-up of 28 months (range:1-68), there was one reported death (1.3%).

Background: Reclassification of HER2 negative breast cancers to HER2 low-level expression (defined as immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) 1+ or 2+/Fluorescent in situ (FISH) non-amplified) allowed targeted treatment with trastuzumab- deruxtecan, anti-HER2 
therapy (DESTINY-Breast04 Trail) in about 60% of patients improving their progression-free and overall survival. The high 
recurrence rates, ranging from 10-95% depending on the stage, unresectability, metastasis, and dismal outcomes with current 
therapies of high-grade Mullerian adenocarcinomas, has made it imperative to explore the utility of trastuzumab-dependent therapy 
for these patients. We, therefore, aimed to describe the expression of HER2 in high-grade Mullerian carcinomas, with a particular 
emphasis on HER2 low expression as currently defined in breast carcinomas. 
Design: We searched our institution's database from January 2016 to December 2021 to identify all high-grade gynecologic 
cancers in which HER2 by IHC and/or FISH tests were previously performed. Additional clinical information was obtained from the 
electronic medical records after Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 
27). 
Results: We identified 81 high-grade gynecologic cancers during the study time frame with previous HER2 and FISH reports. The 
patient demographics, type of tumor, disease stage, site of the primary tumor, clinical management, Mismatch Repair (MMR) status 
when appropriate, Her2 immunohistochemistry, FISH status, and follow-up data are presented in Table 1. In brief, the cohort 
consists of seventy (86.4%) cases that were high-grade serous carcinomas, eight (9.9%) carcinosarcomas, and three (3.7%) high-
grade endometrioid carcinomas. Thirty-one (38.3%) cases were HER2 low, 17 (21%) were HER2 positive, 3 (3.7%) were HER2 2+ 
on IHC but had no FISH performed, and 30 (37%) were HER2 negative. HER2 expression had a significant association with 
primary tumor location (p=0.002) but had no significant association with the type of cancer, race, MMR expression, FIGO stage, or 
deceased status. During a mean follow-up of 13.1 months (range: 1-34), 5% of the patients were deceased. Figure 1 represents 
Her2 score 1+, 2+, and 3+ levels of expression.

Background: Previous work has shown that features derived from the architecture of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (ArcTIL) are 
prognostic in three gynecologic cancer types (ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer) and across three treatment 
types (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy). However, whether ArcTIL features suggest predictive benefit of adjuvant 
chemotherapy (AC) in early-stage endometrial cancer (EC) patients is not yet studied. In this work, we use ArcTIL features from 
H&E slides of early-stage EC and evaluate its predictive role in determining the added benefit of AC in women undergoing surgical-
resection. 
Design: Whole-Slide-Images (WSIs) of H&E surgically-resected samples from early-stage EC patients were obtained from TCGA 
(N=261) and University Hospitals (N=58). For training, samples from TCGA treated with AC following surgery were used (St, 
N=261). The added benefit of AC using ArcTIL features was validated on samples from UH by comparing patients who received 
AC following surgery (Sv1, N=32) against patients who underwent surgery alone (Sv2, N=26). The ArcTIL model previously 
developed by our group, was used for this study and a prognostic subset having 7 features was selected using the LASSO method. 
ArcTIL features were derived from cell cluster graphs of nuclei (epithelial TILs, epithelial non-TILs, stromal TILs and stromal non-
TILs). Using these features, a Random survival forest model was trained to assign a risk of death to each patient in St. The mean 
risk score obtained in St was used to stratify patients as low or high-risk in Sv1 and Sv2. 
 
  
 
S850 
Results: ArcTIL features were found to be associated with OS (Hazard-Ratio= 3.44 (1.14-10.4), p= 0.004 for Sv1 and Hazard-
Ratio= 3.43 (1.02-12), p= 0.03 for Sv2). The high-risk patients in Sv1 and Sv2 were observed to have significantly longer survival 
with AC than patients who underwent surgery alone (Hazard-Ratio= 0.38 (0.08-0.98), p= 0.04 for Sv1+Sv2). 
Conclusions: Our results found that ArcTIL features are predictive in determining the added benefit of AC in early-stage EC 
patients undergoing surgical-resection. Independent multi-site validation should allow for deployment of ArcTIL as a predictive 
decision support tool.

Background: The significance of SARS-CoV-2 infection timing during pregnancy on placental pathology is not well known. We 
reviewed placental pathology and clinical outcomes with reference to timing of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Design: 500 placenta pathology reports from August 2021 – June 2022 with a clinical history of COVID-19 infection were reviewed 
and corresponding clinical data was collected. 
Results: Of the 500 cases,150 (30%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 before the 3rd trimester, and 284 (57%) were positive in the 
3rd trimester. Infection timing for the remaining cases was unknown. 97 (19%) patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive at delivery, all 
infected in the 3rd trimester. 55 (11%) patients were unvaccinated at the time of delivery. The average gestational age at delivery 
(39 weeks) did not differ with timing of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The rate of preterm (32-37 weeks) and very preterm (<=32 weeks) 
births was not significantly different between SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during the 3rd trimester (p=0.439 & 0.663, 
respectively). The prevalence of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) or villous infarction (VI) was slightly higher in placentas of 
patients infected before the 3rd trimester, which showed a trend toward statistical significance (p=0.054). The prevalence of 
ischemic vascular changes (IVC) not diagnostic of MVM was higher in placentas of patients infected in the 3rd trimester (p=0.029); 
the proportion of unvaccinated patients was not significantly higher in this group (p=0.487). The proportion of patients infected in 
the 3rd trimester who were positive at delivery was not significantly different in placentas with IVC compared to MVM or VI 
(p=0.685). The incidence of other placental pathology was not affected by the timing of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Conclusions: Timing of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy does not appear to affect the rate of preterm or very preterm 
delivery. SARS-CoV-2 infection earlier in pregnancy may slightly increase the risk of more severe maternal vascular abnormality 
(MVM or VI) over infection in the 3rd trimester. SARS-CoV-2 infection later in pregnancy appears to result in more non-specific mild 
maternal vascular abnormality (IVC). Neither the proportion of unvaccinated patients nor the proportion of active infection at 
delivery explained why mild and severe maternal vascular abnormalities were associated with different timing of SARS-CoV-2 
infection during pregnancy. 
 
858    Gastric-Type Carcinoma of the Endometrium: Clinicopathologic and Molecular 
Characteristics in a Series of Eight Cases

Disclosures: Douglas Allison: None; Britta Weigelt: None; Amir Momeni Boroujeni: None; Kay Park: None 
Background: Endometrial gastric-type carcinoma (EGC) is a rare histotype of endometrial carcinoma, with fewer than a dozen 
cases reported to date. We describe the clinicopathologic and molecular profiles of 8 cases to gain better understanding of this rare 
tumor. 
Design: Cases were identified from in-house surgical specimens and consults. Pathology reports and select slides were reviewed 
and clinical data was retrieved from the electronic medical record. Several cases underwent molecular testing with an in-house next 
generation sequencing (NGS) platform as part of clinical care, for which the results were reviewed. 
Results: Of the 8 cases, patients ranged from 43 to 80 years of age (mean 65) with follow-up of 3-40 months (Table 1). Six of 8 
(75%) were stage I at the time of hysterectomy (4 IA, 2 IB), while one had nodal and adnexal metastasis at the time of surgery 
(IIIC1). One patient had lung metastases at presentation and did not undergo surgical treatment (IVB). One stage IA case recurred 
within a month and the patient died 6 months after diagnosis. The other 5 stage I patients remain alive with no evidence of disease 
at last follow up (6-40 months). Histologically, the cases exhibited at least some classic gastric-type differentiation, characterized by 
cells with clear to pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and distinct cell borders with well-formed glandular architecture, though features of 
low grade endometrioid carcinoma were also often present and posed diagnostic challenges. The background endometrium was 
variable, but frequently contained endometrial polyps, atypical hyperplasia, and mucinous metaplasia. Immunohistochemically, the 
tumors were consistently positive for CK7 and CEA, but otherwise showed variable expression of CK20, PAX8, ER, and PR. All 
cases tested were p53 aberrant (6/6) and proficient for DNA mismatch repair proteins (6/6). All four cases (50%) with available 
NGS data showed pathogenic mutations in TP53. Other common alterations included KRAS hotspot (3/4) and STK11 mutations 
(2/4), while one case was notable for HER2 amplification (confirmed by FISH).

Conclusions: EGC is a distinct type of endometrial carcinoma morphologically and molecularly similar to the cervical counterpart, 
including TP53 and KRAS mutations, which has histologic overlap with endometrioid carcinoma. While the follow up period in our 
series is short, the rapid recurrence and death in a stage I patient suggests these may also behave more aggressively than 
conventional endometrioid carcinomas.

Background: Squamous carcinoma of the cervix (SCC) is among the most common gynecologic cancers worldwide. While the 
vast majority of cases can be attributed to infection with high-risk subtypes of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), HPV-independent 
(HPVI) cases are known to occur. We aimed to determine the incidence of HPVI SCC and describe the clinicopathologic 
characteristics of these tumors. 
Design: Drawing on a previously established multi-institutional cohort of 670 patients with surgically treated SCC, we identified 376 
cases with readily available tissue to construct tissue microarrays.  These were studied by in situ hybridization for high-risk HPV 
RNA and immunohistochemistry for p16 and p53. Cases were considered HPVI if they were both negative by HPV ISH and failed 
to show diffuse p16 positivity by IHC and considered HPV-associated (HPVA) if they were positive by HPV ISH. All other cases 
were considered equivocal. 
 
  
 
S853 
Results: A total of 6 HPVI SCCs and 361 HPVA SCCs were identified; another 9 cases were equivocal excluded from the current 
analysis. Despite the small numbers, patients with HPVI SCC showed important differences, being significantly older (mean age 72 
vs 50, p<0.001) and with higher stage (33%, 17%, 33%, and 17% for stage I, II, III, and IV respectively vs. 69%, 13%, 17%, and 
1%, p=0.031). While the overall rate of HPVI SCC was low (1.6%) the incidence was increased among older patients, accounting 
for 6.3% of patients over 60. Expression of p53 was varied, with 2 cases showing null expression, 2 cases showing wild-type 
expression, and 2 cases being equivocal. Histologically, HPVI SCCs were heterogenous, with both keratinizing and non-
keratinizing morphologies seen. Notably, several cases showed an apparent precursor lesion reminiscent of differentiated vulvar 
intraepithelial neoplasia, with prominent basal atypia and hypereosinophilia (Fig. 1). Of the 6 patients with HPVI SCC, 2 had distant 
recurrences within 12 months and 2 died within the follow up period. However, the small number of HPVI tumors precluded 
meaningful comparison of progression free and overall survival.

Conclusions: HPVI SCCs are rare tumors, but with important clinical and histologic differences from their HPVA counterparts. 
Their predilection for older patients with higher stage disease suggests the need for increased awareness and testing within these 
populations. We posit that the true frequency of HPVI tumors may be even higher, as they may be underrepresented in this cohort 
of surgically treated patients.

Background: Fusions in uterine mesenchymal tumors (UMT) can be detected by targeted RNA sequencing (RNAseq), aiding 
diagnosis. However, high cost and application of RNAseq only after immunohistochemistry (IHC) are common preconceptions. We 
review our institution's experience with RNAseq and IHC to identify cost-effective approaches in evaluating UMT. 
Design: We reviewed 130 UMT profiled by RNAseq as part of clinical work up to identify 1) classifiable cases where a definitive 
diagnosis was reached by IHC and 2) initially unclassifiable cases where the diagnosis was descriptive or deferred until RNAseq 
results were obtained. Final diagnosis incorporating RNAseq results and number of IHC stains performed were recorded. The total 
cost to achieve a diagnosis was calculated for each case (costs at time of study: RNAseq=$2309; IHC=$647 initial, $607 each 
additional). Cost-effectiveness of 2 diagnostic approaches was determined by calculating total and per-case cost of the normal 
workflow (IHC with reflex to RNAseq if inconclusive) and comparing it with total and per-case cost of an alternative workflow 
(RNAseq with reflex to IHC if inconclusive). 
Results: IHC alone classified 76 (58%) UMT. Fusions were detected in 38 (50%) classifiable cases, of which 35 were disease-
defining and 5 resulting in a change in diagnosis (Fig. 1). Among 54 initially unclassifiable UMT, 31 (57%) were classified after 
RNAseq (Fig. 2), including 11 (35%) found to have a disease-defining fusion and 20 (65%) where a negative RNAseq result 
excluded differential diagnoses. After IHC and RNAseq, 23 UMT (43%) remained unclassifiable. The total cost of RNAseq and IHC 
in 130 UMT was $1,251,563 ($9627/case) resulting in classification of 82% of UMT ($117.40/% accuracy/case) (Table 1). RNAseq 
with reflex to IHC if inconclusive would achieve the same rate of classification and cost $999,759 ($7,690/case; $93.78/% 
accuracy/case), which is an overestimation if fusion-specific IHC was excluded. IHC only testing would have similarly cost 
$951,313 ($7,318/case), but correctly classifying only 55% of UMT ($133.05/% accuracy/case).

Conclusions: RNAseq is helpful in diagnosing UMT, providing utility even with a negative result. Performing RNAseq followed by 
IHC in inconclusive cases is a cost-effective strategy with savings of >20%, while still maximizing tumor classification. IHC only 
testing is the least efficient diagnostic approach.

Background: Carcinosarcoma (CS) is a biphasic tumor with epithelial and mesenchymal components. Overall survival rates did 
not improve in decades despite combined treatment modalities. PReferentially Expressed Antigen in MElanoma (PRAME) is a 
member of cancer testis antigens and a promising immunotherapy target. We explored PRAME protein expression in uterine and 
ovarian CS cases by immunohistochemistry. 
Design: Histologically confirmed archival uterine (n=17) and pelvic (n=12) CS cases (n=29) were queried at our institutional files. 
Following slide review and selection of representative tissue blocks, immunostained slides with PRAME antibody was scored in 
epithelial and mesenchymal components of CS separately by H-score (percent of positively stained tissue multiplied by staining 
intensity). The mean H-scores from components of CS were compared with each other by paired t-test for the entire cohort and 
then results from uterine and pelvic CS cases with each other by two sample pooled paired t-test. In addition, mean H-scores of 
epithelial component of CS and low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma (LGEC) (n=13), and mean H-scores of mesenchymal 
component of CS and uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS) cases (n=14) were compared in a separate analysis. Finally, MLH-1 promoter 
hypermethylation status was tested against marker expression in LGEC group. 
Results: The mean H-scores for carcinomatous and sarcomatous components were 156 and 160 respectively without any 
significant difference (p=0.81) (Figure 1 and 2). There was also no PRAME expression difference between uterine and pelvic CS 
cases (p=0.087).  All CS cases had high-grade carcinomatous components. The mean H-score of LGEC was not significantly 
different from the mean H-score of carcinomatous component of CS group (p=0.572). The median PRAME expression was only 10 
in LMS and it was significantly different from the sarcomatous component of CS (p < 0.001).  There was no PRAME expression 
difference among 6 LGEC with MLH-1 promoter hypermethylation against 7 LGEC with intact MLH-1 (p = 0.466).

Conclusions: PRAME is a promising target for the treatment of uterine and pelvic CS. The protein expression levels are similar in 
carcinomatous and sarcomatous components of CS supporting single cell origin. There is no PRAME expression difference 
between high-grade and low-grade carcinomas in this small cohort. Uterine LMS has overall low-PRAME protein expression levels. 
PRAME protein overexpression seems to be not associated with MLH-1 methylation status.

Background: The most common high-grade ovarian carcinomas (HGOCs) consist of high-grade serous (oSC), grade 3 
endometrioid (oEC3), and clear cell (oCCC) carcinomas. These tumors share overlapping histologic, immunophenotypic and 
genetic features with high-grade endometrial carcinomas (HGECs) of serous (eSC), endometrioid (eEC3), and clear cell (eCCC) 
histotypes. Here we sought to define the methylation profiles of HGOCs and epigenetic differences between HGOCs and HGECs. 
Design: DNA methylation status of 850K CpG sites in 20 HGOCs (8 oSC, 4 oEC3, 8 oCCC) and 24 HGECs (9 eSC, 7 eEC3, 8 
eCCC) were analyzed. DNA was extracted from microdissected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue and profiled using 
the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. Methylation data were analyzed with R package minfi. Raw idats were quantile normalized and 
most variable probes were used for downstream analysis. 
Results: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering, which groups samples based on their similarity/differences in methylation patterns, 
separated HGOCs into 2 major groups (Fig. 1). HGOC cluster 1 consisted of 2/4 oEC3 (50%), with all the remaining cases in 
HGOC cluster 2. Within HGOC cluster 2 were three subclusters, with i) the remaining oEC3 (2/4, 50%), ii) all oCCC (8/8, 100%) 
and 1 oSC (1/8, 12%), and iii) oSC (7/8, 88%). The comparison of HGOC and HGEC showed 2 major clusters, with oEC3 (1/4, 
25%) in HGOC/EC cluster 1 (Fig. 2). HGOC/EC cluster 2 separated into two HGOC/EC subclusters, with 1) oCCC (6/8, 75%) and 
eCCC (7/8, 87%), and 2) three further sub-subcluster, including 2a) eEC3 (3/7, 43%), oEC3 (2/4, 50%) and eSC (1/9, 11%), 2b) 
only eSC (1/9, 11%), and 2c) oEC3 (1/4, 25%), eEC3 (4/7, 57%), eCCC (1/8, 12%), eSC (7/9, 78%), oSC (8/8, 100%) and oCCC 
(2/8, 25%). 
Figure 1 - 862 
 
Figure 2 - 862 
 
Conclusions: DNA methylation analysis of HGOC revealed that oCCC and oSC are distinct epigenetic subgroups, and that a 
subset of oEC3 appears to be epigenetically related to oCCC and oSC. Comparison of high-grade ovarian and endometrial lesions 
further showed that most oCCC and eCCC share similar methylation patterns, and that a small subset of oCCC is epigenetically 
related to oSC.

Background: Growth-Based Grade (GBG): low-grade (GBG-LG, confluent/expansile growth, or ≤10% infiltrative invasion) or high-
grade (GBG-HG, infiltrative growth in >10% of tumor is recently recommended and validated the prognostic value for both disease-
free survival and disease-specific survival in primary mucinous ovarian cancer (MOC), which outperformed Silverberg and FIGO 
grades in multivariate analysis. Around 80% of mucinous carcinomas of the ovary are metastatic. The main objective of the present 
study is to identify the morphological characteristics and their prognostic value for patients with surgically confirmed ovarian

metastatic mucinous carcinomas and if microscopic morphology in metastatic ovary carcinoma can serve as an independent 
validation as a predictor of outcome. 
Design: The medical records of patients who received ovary surgery were reviewed and a postoperative pathological evaluation of 
the morphological feathers (tumor gross features, proportion of tumor cells, the proportion of mucus, histologic grade, nuclear 
grade, the pattern of invasion(GBG), necrosis, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)) and their relationship with prognosis were 
evaluated. 
Results: 111 metastatic ovarian mucinous carcinomas diagnosed between 2010 and 2020 were included at our center. The 
median age was 50 years old. The median OS of all patients with ovarian metastases was 28.5 months. Metastases were found 
before the primary tumor in 35 (31.5%) patients. 76(68.5%) cases were diagnosed synchronously or after the primary tumor. 
Ovarian tumors in 60(54.1%) of 111 women are unilateral. The most frequent primary sites were gastrointestinal tract (80.2%) and 
female reproductive organs (16.2%). Log-rank analysis showed high tumor density (proportion of tumor cells≥40%), poor 
differentiation, high-grade nucleus, and infiltrative invasion predicted more shorter overall survival (p=0.002, 0.026, 0.008, and 
0.015, respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that high tumor density (HR,2.280;95% CI,1.029-5.052, p=0.042) and 
GGB-HG (HR,3.759;95%CI,1.122-12.591, p=0.032) were independent prognostic factors of overall survival.

864    Prognostic Indicators of Tubal Free-Floating Intraluminal Cells for Patients with Endometrial 
Cancer

Background: Free-floating intraluminal cancer cells (FFICC) have been recently reported to be associated with lower survival in 
high risk endometrial cancer (EC). The mechanism of action proposed involves exfoliation through the fallopian tubes (FT) and 
spillage into the peritoneal cavity leading to widespread metastatic potential. Although the significance of peritoneal cytology has 
historically been called into question and has since been removed from surgical staging, a positive correlation has been noted 
among patients who have FFICC with positive washings. Our study aims to determine the incidence of FFICC, risk factors, and 
their prognostic significance.  
Design: Retrospective analysis was performed including all patients with a diagnosis of EC who underwent surgical management 
between 2015-2018. Demographic and histopathologic variables were collected including stage, grade, lesion size, histologic 
subtype, and fluid cytology. Slides of the EC and FT were reviewed by a gynecological pathologist. 
Results: A total of 576 patients were included. FFICCs were detected in 12.5% of patients with EC (endometrioid, n=54 vs non-
endometrioid histologies, n=18). Robotic hysterectomy was performed in 81.9% of patients with FFICC versus 18.1% of patients 
who underwent abdominal hysterectomy with an odds ratio of 2.85. Grade 1 tumors were associated with 39.4% of positive FFICC, 
while grades 2 and 3 were associated with 36.6% and 23.9% respectively (p=0.012). Among patients with positive cytology, 23.7% 
were associated with presence of FFICC (p<0.001). A statistically significant decrease in overall survival was noted with patients 
with FFICC (p = 0.066), however progression free survival in 1st and 2nd recurrence was not found to be statistically significant. 
We did not observe a statistically significant difference in presence of FFICC among histologic subtype or FIGO stage.  
Conclusions: The presence of FFICC may provide important prognostic information specifically with regard to determining 
adjuvant treatment in those with positive cytology and/or high risk histology. Our findings suggest that FFICC are associated with 
age, tumor grade, positive peritoneal cytology, and surgical approach. The higher incidence of FFICC among robotic 
hysterectomies suggests a potential role of mode of uterine manipulation. Lack of difference in progression free survival with 
statistical significance in overall survival suggests a difference in the pattern of recurrence or possibly in postoperative adjuvant 
therapy.

Background: Ovarian cancers with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), specifically mutations in BRCA1/2, have 
increased sensitivity to poly-ADP ribose inhibitors (PARPi). Recently, PARPi has been found to be efficacious in BRCA wild-type 
carcinomas with high genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or other mutations in HR genes. Thus, the goal of this study was 
to investigate tumor mutations in HR genes in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). 
Design: Patients diagnosed with EOC at our institution (2013 - 2021) having targeted next-generation sequencing analysis 
(NGS) were identified. Pathological genomic alterations and LOH score were collected. The cohort was divided into three 
groups: BRCA1/2, BRCA wild-type HR-mutated (BRCAwt-HRmt), and HR wild-type (HRwt). A LOH score of ≥ 16% was defined as 
LOH-high. 
Results: Of the 138 EOC identified, 46(33%) had HR mutations, including 13(28%) in BRCA1, 9(20%) in BRCA2, and 24(52%) in 
BRCAwt-HRmt. HR gene mutation rates by histological subtypes are shown in figure 1A. HR mutations were present in all 
subtypes of EOC besides mucinous carcinoma. 35 of 92(38%) high grade serous carcinoma (HCSC) showed HR mutation, as 
compared to 11 of 46(24%) non-high grade serous carcinoma (NHGSC) (p=0.185) (figure 1B). Among HR mutations in NHGSC, 
64%(7/11) were in BRCAwt- HR, compared to 49%(17/35) in HGSC (p=0.032) (figure 1C). LOH data was available for 87 cases; 28 
were LOH-high. 42%(24/57) of HGSC were LOH-high, while 14% (4/24) of NHGSC (p=0.00002) were LOH-high. 27 of 87(31%) 
had a HR mutation, including 7(8%) in BRCA1, 5(6%) in BRCA2, and 15(17%) in BRCAwt-HRmt.  Of the 28 LOH-high cases, 
12(43%) showed HR mutation, including 10 (36%) in BRCA1/2 and 2(7%) in BRCAwt-HRmt; 15 of 59(25%) LOH-low cases 
showed a HR mutation, including 2 (3%) in BRCA1/2 and 13(22%) in BRCAwt-HRmt (p=0.000146) (figure 2A). In LOH-high cases 
 
  
 
S860 
with HR mutations, 83% (10/12) were in BRCA1/2, compared to 13% (2/15) in LOH-low cases (p<0.00001) (figure 2B). LOH-low 
cases showed wider distribution of mutation in BRCAwt-HR genes, including ATRX, C11ORF30, CDK12, MLH1, 
MUTYH, and RAD54Lthat were not seen in LOH-high cases. 
Figure 1 – 865 
 
 
Figure 2 – 865 
 
 
Conclusions: HGSC cases showed a higher rate of LOH positivity; however, NHGSC cases showed a higher rate of mutations 
in BRCAwt-HR genes. LOH-high cases showed a higher rate of BRCA mutation and LOH-low cases showed a higher rate of HR 
gene mutations other than BRCA. NGS with HRD analysis in EOC should be considered to help guide treatment options.

866    Punctate Pattern Nuclear MLH1 Immunoexpression Without Classic Nuclear MLH1 Staining is 
an Artifact in MMR Deficient Endometrial Cancer that Merits MLH1 Promoter Methylation 
Testing

Disclosures: Swati Bhardwaj: None; Joseph Rabban: None 
Background: Punctate pattern nuclear MLH1 immunohistochemical staining (punctate MLH1), accompanied by complete loss of 
PMS2 IHC, has been reported as a putative antibody clone-related technical artifact in rare MLH1/PMS2 deficient endometrial 
cancers with MLH1 promoter methylation.  Punctate MLH1 may be misinterpreted as intact, leading to misclassification of the 
apparent isolated PMS2 loss as evidence of probable PMS2 germline mutation.   Herein we present morphologic and molecular 
correlation of the largest series to date of punctate MLH1 in endometrial cancer and highlight features to mitigate against 
misinterpretation. 
Design: Punctate MLH1 was defined as discrete dot-like staining in the nucleus (one or more dots) of tumor cells.  MLH1 IHC was 
otherwise interpreted using current ISGyP recommendations.  21 biopsy cases were collected from the practice of one of us (JTR) 
(Jan 2020-Aug 2022).  For outside cases, MLH1 IHC was repeated inhouse on the biopsy for comparison (Cell Marque clone 
G168-728) and also performed on subsequent hysterectomy when available. MLH1 promoter methylation and a 500+ gene next 
generation sequencing panel (NGS) with MSI Sensor testing were performed in selected cases.  
Results: Punctate MLH1 without classic nuclear MLH1 occurred in 13/21 patients (all PMS2 deficient), while classical nuclear 
MLH1 co-existed in 8/21 (all PMS2 intact).  Repeat inhouse IHC was concordant with outside biopsy IHC in all cases tested but 
IHC on hysterectomy showed completely negative MLH1 in 5/6 tested cases.  In 11/13 biopsies without classic nuclear MLH1, 
punctate staining occurred in at least 80% of tumor cells.  12/13 were low grade endometrioid carcinoma, 1 was dedifferentiated 
carcinoma, all of which were MSI-high by NGS.  Two somatic MLH1 mutations were present in 1/13; the other 12 
were MLH1/PMS2 wild type by NGS and showed MLH1 promoter methylation in all tested cases.  Classic nuclear MLH1 co-existed 
in 8/21; 4 were p53 aberrant, CN-high grade 3 carcinoma; 3 were low grade CN-low endometrioid carcinoma and 1 grade 3 
endometrioid carcinoma. 
Conclusions: MLH1 promoter methylation testing.  If classic nuclear staining is also present, MLH1 should be reported as intact, 
as supported by intact PMS2.  The etiology of punctate MLH1 is unclear but may be a clone-related artifact and/or related to biopsy 
processing since this pattern was infrequently observed in the subsequent hysterectomy.

Background: In 2021, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) made several adaptions in the definitions 
of the FIGO staging system of vulvar cancer. One important adaptation is the altered recommendation on depth of invasion (DOI) 
measurement. Following the new FIGO 2021, this study was initiated by the Dutch Working Group Gynecological Pathology 
(NWGP) in order to study current practice variability among gynecopathologists concerning the used DOI method in vulvar cancer. 
Design: In this explorative study, a series of 26 vulvar cancers were selected by 3 gynecopathologists during the day-to-day work 
between March 2022 and June 2022. The selection of cases was made when DOI was expected to change from >1 mm to ≤ 1 mm 
when applying the different DOI measurement methods (DOI-FIGO 2009 versus 2021) and/or when DOI measurement was 
challenging. For each case, DOI measurements were annotated for the distinct methods via a digital platform. Subsequently, one 
gynecopathologist from each gynecologic oncology center in the Netherlands (n=9) and one from Belgium were asked i) to indicate 
the feasibility of DOI-FIGO 2009 and DOI-FIGO 2021 and ii) to indicate the preferred DOI method (i.e. FIGO 2009, FIGO 2021, 
tumor thickness or no invasion) for each cancer case via the digital platform. 
Results: As 26 vulvar cancer cases were assessed by 10 pathologists, 260 assessments were available for each study question. 
The feasibility of applying the DOI-FIGO 2009 method was found to be ‘easy/reasonable’ in 225 (86.5%) assessments, 
‘moderate’ in 17 (6.5%) and ‘difficult/not possible’ in 18 (6.9%). For the DOI-FIGO 2021 method, these figures were respectively 
 
  
 
S862 
138 (53.0%), 66 (25.4%) and 56 (21.5%). Figure 1 The DOI-FIGO 2009 method was preferred in 134 (51.5%) assessments, the 
DOI-FIGO 2021 in 95 (36.5%), tumor thickness in 19 (7.3%), no invasion in 8 (3.1%) and no preferred method in 4 (1.5%). Of the 
26 vulvar cancer cases, a high agreement (> 80%) on the preferred method was present for 6 cases (4 FIGO 2009; 2 FIGO 2021), 
a moderate agreement (60-70%) was present in 8 cases (4 FIGO 2009; 4 FIGO 2021) and no agreement (≤50%) in 12 
cases. Figure 2

Figure 2 – 867 
 
 
Conclusions: The introduction of the FIGO 2021 depth of invasion measurement is difficult to apply in a subset of vulvar cancers. 
The FIGO 2009 DOI measurement was intuitively the preferred method in selected vulvar cancer cases. We may need to rethink 
this as “one method does not appear to fit all' vulvar cancers.

Background: Cytologic atypia and brisk mitoses including atypical forms are well-known features of juvenile granulosa cell tumors 
(JGCT), and in the largest study to date, Young et al. noted these features to be associated with decreased survival in JGCTs with 
extra-ovarian spread. In addition to these features, tumors also showing loss of the typical orderly architecture have been 
designated “anaplastic” JGCTs. Similar features have been described in adult granulosa cell tumors, which were shown to 
harbor TP53 mutations. Herein, we report the first series of anaplastic JGCTs focusing on their morphology, molecular profile, and 
clinical behavior. 
Design: 7 anaplastic JGCTs were identified from consultation files. An average of 26 H&E slides were reviewed (range 18-40). All 
tumors underwent next-generation sequencing on a 168 gene panel. p53 and MYC IHC were performed in selected tumors.  
Results: Patients ranged from 9 to 22 (mean 13.7) years. Tumors ranged from 15.5 to 28 (mean 21.1) cm; they were solid and 
cystic with necrosis seen in 2. Conventional JGCT with diffuse/nodular, follicular, and/or papillary growths were seen in all and 
anaplastic areas constituted 10 to 90% (mean 42%). The components were vaguely demarcated from each other in 6 while 
admixed in 1 tumor. In the conventional areas, cytologic atypia was typically 2+ (with 3 showing foci of 3+) and mitoses ranged 
from 7-18 (mean 12.4)/10 HPFs. Anaplastic areas showed 4+ atypia and 19-41 (mean 30.8) mitoses/10 HPFs. Multinucleated 
(non-bizarre) tumor cells were identified in all (extensive in 3, rare in 1), tumor cell necrosis in 5, and lymphovascular invasion in 1. 
Sequencing was successful in 5 tumors and all harbored TP53 mutations, with aberrant p53 expression noted in the remaining 2 by 
IHC. Other recurring alterations included MYC amplification (n=3, all patients dead of disease) and AKT1 in-frame duplications 
(n=3). FIGO stage was IA (n=1), IC3 (n=2), II (n=1), IIIA (n=2), and unknown (n=1). Follow-up was available for 6 patients (mean 30 
months); 3 died of disease and 3 were alive and well (range: 10-108 months, all stage I). Clinicopathological and molecular 
features summarized in Table and Figure.

S864 
Figure 1 - 868 
 
Conclusions: Anaplastic JGCTs are characterized by recurrent TP53 mutations, often with concurrent MYC amplifications. These 
novel findings may have prognostic and therapeutic implications as tumors with MYC amplifications are associated with poor 
outcome but patients may benefit from MYC inhibitors.

Background: Endometrial stromal tumors are morphologically heterogenous and their diagnosis may especially be difficult when 
they show variant morphology and lack typical areas of endometrial stromal neoplasia. We identified three endometrial/oid stromal 
tumors with identical and previously undescribed histologic features and herein report their morphologic, immunohistochemical, and 
molecular profile. 
Design: Clinical and gross characteristics were obtained from the consultation correspondence. An average of 16 (range 12-20) 
H&E slides was examined. CD10, β-catenin, calretinin, WT1, SMA, desmin and ER immunostains were performed. All 3 cases 
were subjected to RNA sequencing and CTNNB1 split-apart FISH. Whole genome DNA methylation analysis was performed using 
Illumina EPIC array and data were analyzed by the DKFZ sarcoma classifier. Copy number analysis was performed using the 
conumee package. 
Results: Patients were 53-, 62-, and 79-year-old. Tumors were completely resected, well-circumscribed, tan-yellow solid masses 
measuring 10.0, 11.0 and 18.7 cm, and were intramyometrial (n=2) or arose from the broad ligament (n=1). All showed a 
fibroblastic background with small and tight whorls of epithelioid to slightly spindled tumor cells with minimal cytoplasm and 
negligible mitosis, multifocally associated with hyalinization and myxoid changes and small, delicate vessels. This morphology was 
seen throughout in two and in ~20% of the other with the remaining areas showing cords, hollow tubules, and nests of tumor 
cells. CD10 (3/3, 1 focal), calretinin (3/3 diffuse), WT1 (3/3 diffuse), ER (1/1, diffuse) were positive while SMA (0/3), desmin (0/1), 
SF1 (0/1) and inhibin (0/2) were negative in the tumor cells. RNA sequencing was successful in one, and revealed a GREB1-
CTNNB1 in-frame fusion with a driver probability of 99%. All three tumors showed a CTNNB1 translocation by FISH correlating with 
nuclear β-catenin positivity. All tumors fell under the low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma reference class by methylation 
analysis with flat copy number profiles. One patient (79-year-old) died of unrelated causes two months after surgery and the other 
two were alive without disease after 9 and 72 months. 
 
  
 
S865 
Figure 1 - 869 
 
Conclusions: We have identified a rare subset of endometrial/oid stromal nodules/tumor with extensive whorling 
and CTNNB1 translocation, a genetic alteration previously not described, expanding the morphologic and molecular spectrum of 
these neoplasms.

Background: Uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord tumors (UTROSCTs) are rare and most have been molecularly defined 
by ESR1::NCOA1/2/3 fusions with only a minor subset harboring GREB1 fusions. Despite these molecular findings, it has not yet 
been fully investigated whether different molecular alterations underlie tumors with different behavior. Five malignant UTROSCTs 
have been reported in a large cohort with >3 of 5 of the following features predictive of aggressive behavior: size >5 cm, infiltrative 
borders, at least moderate cytologic atypia, mitotic rate >3/10HPF, and tumor cell necrosis. Herein we study the molecular 
landscape of 13 UTROSCTs. 
Design: 10 benign and 3 malignant UTROSCTs were identified. An average of 4 (range 2-11) H&E slides were examined. All 
tumors were submitted for solid fusion assay (SFA; 59 genes including ESR1, JAZF1) and 1 underwent RNA sequencing. 
Results: Patients ranged from 32 to 73 (mean 52), and tumors from 1 to 11.5 (mean 5.2) cm. 10 were well-circumscribed, 3 
minimally infiltrative. Predominant patterns (>50%) included diffuse (4), nests (2) and cords (1), and were intermixed with other 
patterns. 10/13 had smooth muscle pseudoinfiltration (range 10-60%, 3 extensive). Cytologic atypia was mild (8), moderate (3), 
moderate to severe (2) and 1 showed extensive rhabdoid morphology. Mitoses were negligible in 7, and 2-9 /10HPF in the others. 
1 tumor showed necrosis. Follow-up was available for all, ranged from 10 to 144 (mean 60) months. 3 patients 
developed metastasis at 30-144 months and tumors showed 4/5 described features. Benign tumors showed 0 (n=7), 1 (n=1; size), 
2 (n=1; size and borders), 3 (n=1; atypia, mitosis, necrosis; tumor with rhabdoid morphology) features. SFA only 
detected ESR1::NCOA3 in 5/10 benign tumors (4 with 0 features, 1 with 3; 3/5 with extensive smooth muscle) but in none of 
the malignant tumors. No morphologic differences were identified between fusion-positive and negative benign tumors, and 
architectural patterns were similar between benign and malignant UTROSCTs. JAZF1 fusion was not identified in any tumors. RNA 
sequencing revealed GREB1::NCOA1 fusion in one malignant UTROSCT.  
 
  
 
S866 
Conclusions: ESR1::NCOA3 fusion was identified only in a subset of UTROSCTs (5/13) all being benign. However, in this very 
limited cohort, all 3 malignant tumors lack this fusion and likely show different genetic alterations as highlighted by GREB1 fusion in 
one. Further molecular studies are in progress.

Background: SARS-CoV2 placentitis features the triad of histiocytic and neutrophilic intervillositis, perivillous fibrin deposition, and 
trophoblast necrosis. We have also noticed features of fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM) in such cases. The CD34 
immunohistochemical stain is a sensitive detector of recent/on-going FVM. Its utility has not been explored in COVID-infected 
placentas, however. Consequently, this study analyzes the rate of FVM in a cohort of cases with placentas positive for SARS-CoV2 
by immunohistochemistry and a comparative group of women prenatally positive for SARS-CoV2 by serology but without placental 
evidence of SARS-CoV2 infection by immunohistochemistry. 
Design: This is a retrospective analysis of cases of our institution from years 2020-2022. Group 1 contained 15 cases with SARS-
CoV2 placentitis and Group 2 contained 18 mothers, positive prenatally for SARS-CoV2 by serology, but placentas negative by 
immunohistochemistry. All cases were stained by hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV2 and CD34 (for 
recent FVM featuring villous endothelial fragmentation). 23 independent clinical and 55 placental phenotypes were compared by 
Chi-square or analysis of variance where appropriate. 
Results: Histologic features are shown in figures 1 and 2. Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were found in gestational 
age (28.9±7.7 vs 36.0 weeks), perinatal mortality (80% vs 11%), macerated stillbirth (80% vs 6%), cesarean section rate (0% vs 
28%), congenital malformations (0% vs 72%), placental weight (224 vs 446 gm), and increased extravillous trophoblasts in 
chorionic disc (0% vs 28%), in Group 1 and 2 respectively. Although not statistically significant, distal villous FVM was 80% and 
89% in Group 1 and 2, respectively.  In particular, the recent/on-going FVM with temporal heterogeneity was particularly high in 
Group 1 (47% vs 33%).  Large vessel/proximal FVM was higher in Group 2 (7% vs 28%). 
Figure 1 - 871 
 
 
  
 
S867 
Figure 2 - 871 
 
Conclusions: FVM was higher in SARS-CoV2 positive placentas than in any other clinically defined placental populations known 
to us, and much higher than the incidence of FVM in other perinatal infections. The high incidence of FVM in the comparative group 
may be explained by the high percentage of fetal congenital malformations in Group 2. Therefore, the high stillbirth rate in Group 1 
may be explained by an additive effect of FVM resulting from massive perivillous fibrin deposition, intervillositis, and trophoblastic 
necrosis.

Background: Chromatin remodeling is essential for a multitude of pathobiological processes including tumor initiation and 
progression. Modification in histone either by methylation or acetylation drives the remodeling. The updated paradigm in the 
genesis of ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSCs) posits that most of HGSCs originate from the precursor lesions on the 
fallopian tube epithelium. Serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs) represent the earliest morphologically recognizable 
lesions in the development of HGSCs. How histone modifications alter in STICs remains an important question to be answered. In 
this study, we applied H3K27me3 immunohistochemistry on fallopian tubes containing STICs and HGSCs to compare their 
expression patterns. 
Design: A total of 30 STICs and 26 HGSCs from 31 women were analyzed for H3K27me3 immunoreactivity. A rabbit monoclonal 
antibody against H3K27me3 was used. In addition, 3 normal fallopian tube epithelial (NFTE) samples, one NFTE cell line, 2 HGSC 
cell lines and one HGSC tissue were studied for H3K27me3 expression by immunoblotting using the same antibody. We employed 
a semi-quantitative H-score system for staining and the Kruskal-Wallis test for statistical analysis. This study was approved by the 
institutional review board. 
Results: By comparing STIC, NFTE, and HGSC groups, we found that the H-scores of the STICs were lower than NFTEs, but 
higher than HGSCs (P-value < 0.0001). Among the same patients, we found 21 (70%) of 30 cases showing progressive decrease 
in the H-score from NFTE, STIC and HGSC. There was no correlation between the H-scores of the STICs and the following 
features: ages of patients, Ki-67 proliferation index, and papillary vs. flat STICs. Based on the Western blot analysis, we detected a 
single 17 kDa band corresponding to H3K27me3, indicating the high specificity of the antibody. In the Western blot analysis, we 
also observed that the 4 NFTE samples expressed significantly higher levels of H3K27me3 protein than HGSC samples.

Figure 2 – 872 
 
 
Conclusions: Our results show a progressive decrease in H3K27me3 from NFTE, STIC to HGSC, suggesting that a decrease of 
this histone repressor mark occurs in HGSC precursors. These findings provide new insights into a possible role of chromatin 
configuration in the development of HGSC.

S869 
Background: The current paradigm implicates a fallopian tube precursor as the origin for most ovarian high-grade serous 
carcinomas (HGSC). However, a rare subset of HGSCs develop via a distinct pathway from low-grade serous ovarian neoplasms, 
specifically low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) or serous borderline tumor (SBT). The molecular pathogenesis and evolutionary 
trajectory of this low-grade to high-grade transformation is unclear. 
Design: Histomorphologic review was performed on 7 cases of SBT or LGSC associated with a synchronous or metachronous 
high-grade carcinoma (HGSC or poorly-differentiated carcinoma). Whole exome sequencing analyses was performed on 
microdissected low-grade and high-grade components from individual cases. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from single 
nucleotide variants and LOH events. 
Results: Low-grade tumor components were morphologically indistinguishable from conventional SBTs/LGSCs. The degree of 
nuclear pleomorphism in high-grade tumors from the 7 patients was variable (grade 2 nuclear atypia, n=2, and up to grade 3, n=5). 
Notably, 1 patient initially presented with ovarian LGSC, which progressed to HGSC (nuclear grade 2, 23 mitoses per 10 HPF), 
followed by a subsequent LGSC recurrence. Truncal mutations, present across all tumor samples from a given patient, included 
known drivers of low-grade serous neoplasms: KRAS (n=4), BRAF (G469A, n=1), NF2 (n=1), and USP9X (n=1). High-grade 
transformation was associated with a TP53 mutation in 3 cases, all with grade 3 nuclear atypia and genome-wide allelic 
imbalances. Interestingly, a heterozygous TP53 mutation was detected in an SBT, with loss-of-heterozygosity upon progression to 
HGSC. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed aberrant p53 expression only with bi-allelic inactivation of TP53 and confirmed 
ATRX and p16/CDKN2A loss in tumors harboring these genetic alterations. Phylogenetic analyses revealed relatively few shared 
mutations between matched low-grade and high-grade tumors compared to private mutations specific to each component (i.e. trees 
with short trunks and long branches). 
Figure 1 - 873 
 
Figure 2 - 873 
 
 
  
 
S870 
Conclusions: Synchronous and metachronous low-grade serous neoplasms and high-grade carcinomas are clonally related but 
show early genetic divergence, suggesting that high-grade transformation may be a relatively early molecular event. TP53 wild-type 
HGSCs are morphologically and molecularly distinct from conventional TP53-mutated HGSCs. 
 
874    Mixed Ovarian Neoplasms with Gastrointestinal-Type Mucinous and Müllerian Epithelial 
Components: A Rare Group of Tumors Demonstrating the Phenotypic Plasticity of the 
Müllerian Epithelial Cell 
M. Herman Chui1, Lora Ellenson1

Disclosures: M. Herman Chui: None; Lora Ellenson: None 
Background: Primary mucinous ovarian neoplasms, gastrointestinal-type (GI-type), are composed of mucin-producing tumor cells 
resembling intestinal goblet cells or gastric foveolar epithelium. In contrast to seromucinous tumors, which exhibit endocervical-type 
mucinous differentiation and thought to be derived from endometriosis, the cell/tissue-of-origin of most GI-type mucinous ovarian 
tumors is unknown. 
Design: We identified 7 GI-type mucinous ovarian tumors (cystadenomas, n=3; borderline tumor/carcinoma, n=4) with spatially 
distinct areas showing morphologic features of Müllerian-type epithelial differentiation (ciliated cells or endometrioid-type glands). 
Immunohistochemistry for cell lineage markers and PAS/Alcian Blue staining were performed. Morphologically distinct components 
were isolated by microdissection, from which extracted DNA was analyzed by targeted next generation sequencing. 
Results: In all cases, immunohistochemistry demonstrated mucin-producing cells to be positive for at least one GI marker (CK20 
or CDX2), while areas with morphologic features of Müllerian differentiation were positive for PAX8, ER and/or PR, and lacked 
expression of CK20 and CDX2; CK7 was strongly and diffusely positive in all tumor cells. Tumor cells with a gastric-type phenotype 
produced neutral mucin, while acidic mucin was present within intestinal-type goblet cells. Targeted sequencing 
revealed ARID1A mutations in all mixed borderline/malignant tumors (n=4); other recurrent genetic alterations included KRAS (n=2) 
and TP53 mutations (n=2). Shared mutations were present in paired Müllerian and GI-type mucinous tumor components, 
consistent with their derivation from a common ancestor, with more shared mutations between components than private mutations 
specific to each component.  All mixed borderline/malignant tumors were associated with endometriosis (n=3) or Müllerian inclusion 
cysts (n=1), and mutation or loss of ARID1A expression was seen in these putative precursor lesions in 2 cases. 
Figure 1 – 874 
 
 
 
  
 
S871 
Figure 2 – 874 
 
 
Conclusions: Ovarian neoplasms composed of clonally related GI-type mucinous and Müllerian-type epithelial components 
harbor ARID1A mutations and are frequently associated with endometriosis. The existence of a Müllerian stem/progenitor cell with 
the capacity to differentiate towards cell lineages within the GI-tract may be involved in the pathogenesis of at least a subset of GI-
type mucinous ovarian neoplasms.

Background: HRD status has recently emerged as a predictive factor for response to PARP inhibitors in patients with ovarian 
carcinoma. This molecular parameter has been studied in high-grade serous carcinomas, but little is known in rare histotypes of 
ovarian carcinoma. The aim of the study is to investigate HRD status in rare histotypes of ovarian carcinoma such as so-called 
Indeterminate-Grade Serous Carcinomas (IGSCs)/serous carcinoma with mixed morphologic features of high-grade and low-grade 
and Mesonephric-Like Carcinomas (MLCs) and to correlate it with clinicopathologic features. 
Design: Clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical (IHC) characteristics were evaluated in 323 consecutive cases of ovarian 
carcinoma between 2019 and 2022. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis including BRCA1/2 status was evaluated in all 
histotypes excluding mucinous carcinoma. The molecular analysis was expanded in 90 cases with evaluation of HRD status by 
using MyChoice HRD Plus assay. HRD status was considered positive if deleterious mutations in BRCA1/2 were detected and/or 
Genomic Instability Score (GIS) was positive (GIS ≥ 42). 
Results: Histotypes distribution: 203 (62.8%) high-grade serous (HGSC) carcinomas, 45 (13.9%) endometrioid carcinomas, 24 
(7.4%) mucinous carcinomas, 17 (5.2%) low-grade serous ovarian carcinomas, 11 (3.4%) carcinosarcomas, 10 (3.1%) clear cells 
carcinomas, 9 (2.9%) MLCs, 7 (2%) IGSCs, 1 (0.3%) undifferentiated carcinoma. HRD status was positive in 33/90 cases: 24 
HGSC, 3 CS, and 6 IGSC. As regards IGSC, NGS analysis identified TP53 mutation in 3/7 (42.8%) cases, PIK3CA and NRAS in 2 
cases. Within HRD positive IGSC cases, 1 case was mutated in BRCA2, and 1 showed concomitant mutations in BRCA1 and 
 
  
 
S872 
ERBB2. The only IGSC HRD negative case featured NRAS and TP53 concomitant mutations. 2 HRD positive IGSCs presented 
with disease recurrence and, after the treatment with PARPi, showed an indolent clinical course. Conversely, all the MLCs were 
HRD and BRCA1/2 negative, revealing pathogenic variants of KRAS in 8 cases (8/9) and BRAF in 1 case (1/9). Mutations in TP53, 
POLE and MMR deficiency were not identified in MLCs. 7 MLCs cases had early disease recurrence with lung metastases and 
aggressive clinical behaviour. 
Conclusions: In our cohort, rare histotypes of ovarian carcinomas are characterized by morphological and molecular 
heterogeneity resulting in different clinical behaviour. The evaluation of molecular markers could improve potential novel target 
therapy for these uncommon tumors.

Background: The term verruciform acanthotic Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia (vaVIN) has been recently coined to describe 
Human Papillomavirus-independent (HPVi), p53 wildtype lesions with characteristic clinical and morphologic correlates. Currently, 
p16 and p53 stains have little role beyond excluding other VIN types. Our aim is to expand the pathologic and molecular landscape 
of vaVIN and to explore the use of CK17, a marker expressed by HPVi lesions, in its diagnosis. 
Design: Cases with Vulvar Acanthosis with Altered Differentiation, Differentiated Exophytic Vulvar Intraepithelial Lesion, and other 
verruciform atypias were retrieved; vaVIN diagnosis was confirmed by slide review. Clinical and pathologic features were 
documented. Immunohistochemistry for p16, p53 and CK17 was performed. Sequencing using a panel with 447-gene coverage 
was used to survey for single-nucleotide variants (SNV), copy number alterations and structural variants. 
Results: Sixteen vaVIN samples from 12 patients were included (Table 1); 3 had a concurrent vSCC. Median patient age was 69 
(range 56-85) years. All lesions were positive for CK17 (9 with full-thickness, 3 with middle-superficial staining). Adjacent 
uninvolved mucosa was present in 9 cases; all showed negative or discontinuous CK17 (Fig 1). Genomic aberrations were noted in 
11 cases (92%). These included SNVs involving PIK3CA (n=6, 50%), NOTCH1-2 and FAT1 (each n=5, 42%), HRAS (n=3, 
25%), ARID2 and KRAS (each n=1, 8%). CDKN2A alterations were also noted (n=4, 33%; 2 with biallelic 9p21.3 loss and 2 with 
SNVs). Follow-up information was found in 9 patients (mean period 28 [range 6-50] months). Seven patients were alive free of 
disease (2 had concurrent vSCC). One patient with vaVIN and vSCC had recurrence and is alive with disease at 6 months after 
diagnosis. Remaining vaVIN patient presented 22 months later with vSCC and died of disease 6 months later.

Conclusions: Our study shows a wider molecular spectrum in vaVIN, beyond known alterations in PIK3CA, HRAS and ARID2 to 
now include NOTCH1, FAT1 and CDKN2A, which are characteristic of HPVi vSCC (PMID 34650187). Strong, continuous CK17 
staining, either full-thickness or mid-superficial, is consistently seen in vaVIN. Since uninvolved mucosa is usually negative, CK17 
can serve in assessing lesion extent and margin status. vaVIN can occur with concurrent or subsequent vSCC, sometimes with 
fatal outcome. These findings support the concept of vaVIN as a neoplastic process within the family of HPVi vulvar neoplasia.

Background: Atypical Hyperplasia is difficult to manage, thus interest exists in identifying factors that may improve pre-operative 
risk prediction of EC, triaging of patients and providing necessary treatment. Data exists regarding molecular signatures that can 
predict the presence of concurrent EC in patients with AH on biopsy. We aim to characterize molecular landscapes of endometrial 
samples diagnosed with AH with EC on final hysterectomy. 
Design: Our database was queried for patients with AH on endometrial curettage or biopsy who had a hysterectomy within 6 
months. 59 tissue samples from 34 patients were included: 15 AH biopsy samples, 18 AH final hysterectomy samples (13 matched 
pairs), 13 EC biopsies and 13 samples that were EC on final hysterectomy samples (12 matched pairs) that were analyzed by WES 
or WTS (NovaSeq). Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was measured by totaling somatic mutations found per tumor (High: >10 
mt/MB). Immune cell infiltrates were estimated by Quantiseq. Significance was determined by Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney U 
test and adjusted for multiple comparisons: p<0.05 but q>0.05 was considered a trend. 
Results: 15/34 patients with AH initially had EC on final hysterectomy. 2 of 15 patients were > stage II at time of 
surgery. Decreased PTEN mutations were seen between AH (n=7/10) and EC (n=7/8) on biopsy (70% vs 88%, p=0.03). Samples 
of EC origin were MSI-H by NGS-MSI (n=3/18) and had no mutations in PPP2R1A (n=0/16) (Fig1a; Table 1). In hysterectomy 
samples, AH samples were all TMB low (Fig 1b). EC samples had trends of increased CTLA4 (FC: 6.97-fold) expression and 
immune cell infiltration of Macrophage M1 (+1.19%), NK (+2.13%), CD8+ T (+1.27%), regulatory T (+2.17%) and Dendritic 
(+2.87%) cells compared to AH samples (all p<0.05). Similarly, when comparing biopsies, EC samples had trends toward 
increased expression of CTLA4 (12.6-fold), HAVCR2 (FC: 2.59-fold) and IFNG (FC: 17.8-fold) and increased immune cell 
infiltration of Neutrophils (+11.7%), CD8+ T (+2.39%) and regulatory T (+2.43%) cells compared to AH samples (all p<0.05) (Fig 
2a-b).

Disclosures: Emanuela D'Angelo: None; Iñigo Espinosa: None; Jaime Prat: None 
Background: Thirteen years ago we pointed out that ovarian transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) and conventional high-grade serous 
carcinoma (HGSC) had similar genetic alterations and clinical behavior. Consequently, ovarian TCC is now classified as a 
morphologic variant of HGSCs. Defective homologous recombination, resulting from genetic or epigenetic inactivation of DNA 
damage repair genes, such as BRCA1/2, occurs in approximately 50% of the HGSCs. However, little is known about the role of 
these genes in HGSCs with transitional-like morphology. 
 
  
 
S876 
Design: By next-generation sequencing, we study mutations of DNA damage repair genes 
including BRCA1/BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1, ESMY, ATR, PTEN, CHEK1/2, and other genes involved in the 
ovarian carcinogenesis, in 6 HGSCs with transitional-like morphology, 1 typical HGSC, and 1 malignant Brenner tumor. 
Results: One case of HGSC with transitional-like morphology developed as a component of a recurrent serous borderline tumor. 
All HGSCs had p53 mutations and 3 HGSCs with transitional-like morphology also showed BRCA1/2 mutations. No genomic 
aberrations in other homologous genes were found. Interestingly, in the case of HGSC with transitional-like morphology that arose 
from a recurrent serous borderline tumor, p53 and BRCA1/2 mutations were encountered in the HGSC component but were not 
identified in the serous borderline tumor. Also, one HGSC with transitional-like morphology and signet-ring cells had APC mutation. 
In contrast, the malignant Brenner tumor had PIK3CA mutation and neither p53 nor BRCA1/2 mutations were detected. 
Conclusions: Our results show that many HGSCs with transitional-like morphology are homologous recombination deficiency 
tumors secondary to BRCA1/2 mutations and confirm that HGSCs and malignant Brenner tumor follow different tumorigenic 
pathways.

Background: SIG help to shape tumor genomes and can be used as predictive markers as well as to inform patient eligibility for 
targeted therapies. Understanding and gaining more experience on handling the biological traits of EC, especially when correlated 
with traditional histological findings, is fundamental in the precision medicine era. We aimed to identify SIG of primary EC using a 
WGS approach correlating with histological subtypes (HS) and FIGO grading while attempting to stratify the tumors into the four 
TCGA molecular categories (TCGAmol). 
Design: WGS analysis was performed in 32 primary non-treated EC by using state-of-the-art Isabl GxT platform. Through manual 
curation, total single nucleotide variants (SNVs), tumor mutational burden (TMB) and SIG were annotated. Driver gene mutations 
(mut) and copy number (CN) plots were manually reviewed to identify defining alterations and to establish the CN status as low or 
high, following TCGA classifiers. Clinical-pathologic features were reviewed and correlated with molecular findings (MOL). 
Results: Median age was 68 years (range 30-82). HS comprised 23 endometrioid carcinomas (EMCA); 2 mesonephric-like 
carcinomas (MLC); 2 serous, 4 mixed (MC) and 1 clear cell (CCC). Figures 1 and 2 show HS and MOL. The average number of 
SIG was 5.2/case. Within relevant mutational signatures, MMR was the most prevalent (31%). APOBEC SIG, rarely described in 
EC, was seen in 46% of high- grade EC. 5 EC could not be placed into TCGAmol due to ambiguous features. CN high cases 
showed CDK12 alterations (50% of cases) and enriched tandem duplications. No significant HRD SIG nor BRCA mut were 
identified. Table 1 reveals additional MOL with corresponding clinical outcomes.

Conclusions: The mutational processes in EC vary among tumor types and distinct SIG are observed. Using WGS, the cases 
were easily placed in the TCGA categories, including POLE and MSI-H which can be targetable by immune-checkpoint blockers. 
We observed that APOBEC SIG, although uncommon, was seeing in high-grade tumors and might represent a distinct category. It 
is important to note that APOBEC SIG are not exclusive of cervical uterine cancers and might represent a pitfall for primary site 
definition. Targeting CDK12 alterations is an emerging therapeutic tool and could be of significance in CN high tumors. No relevant 
HRD SIG or BRCA mut were identified thus, potential for PARP inhibitor therapy in EC still needs to be explored.

Background: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) of Bartholin’s gland (AdCC-BG) is a rare gynecologic vulvar malignancy. Although 
AdCC-BGs are slow growing, they are locally aggressive and associated with high recurrence rates. Here we sought to 
characterize the molecular landscape of AdCC-BGs and define whether AdCC-BGs harbor MYB and MYBL1 alterations akin 
to AdCCs of the breast and salivary glands. 
Design: We subjected six AdCC-BGs to a combination of RNA-sequencing, targeted DNA-sequencing, fluorescence in 
situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse-transcription PCR. Somatic mutations, copy number alterations and chimeric transcripts were 
defined using validated bioinformatics methods. AdCC-BGs were also subjected to MYB immunohistochemistry. 
Results: Of the six AdCC-BGs assessed, three were underpinned by the MYB-NFIB fusion gene with varying breakpoints and 
displayed high levels of MYB expression by immunohistochemistry. Two AdCC-BGs harbored MYBL1 fusion genes with different 
gene partners, including MYBL1-RAD51B and MYBL1-EWSR1 gene fusions. By immunohistochemistry, MYB protein expression 
was high in one, and focal and weak in the other MYBL1-rearranged AdCC-BG. The last case showed MYB protein overexpression 
and transcriptional MYB pathway activation based on RNA-sequencing analysis, however no gene fusion was detected, likely due 
to poor nucleic acid quality. 
Conclusions: Akin to salivary and breast AdCCs, AdCC-BGs are underpinned by MYB and MYBL1 chimeric fusions. Our data 
demonstrate that AdCCs, irrespective of organ site, provide an example of genotypic–phenotypic correlation and a convergent 
phenotype, whereby activation of MYB and MYBL1 can be driven by the MYB–NFIB fusion gene, MYBL1 rearrangements, and 
 
  
 
S879 
likely other mechanisms. Assessment of MYB or MYBL1 rearrangements, or potentially MYB overexpression, may be used as an 
ancillary marker for the diagnosis of AdCC-BGs.

Background: The histologic criteria for categorizing struma ovarii is the same as their thyroid counterparts. However, classifying 
cases with follicular architecture can be challenging. Recent advances in molecular diagnostics have allowed for greater 
characterization of pathologic mutations in thyroid tumors. However, no large-scale studies investigating the molecular landscape 
of struma ovarii have been published. This study aims to examine the spectrum of molecular aberrations in struma ovarii that can 
provide diagnostic and prognostic information. 
Design: After a retrospective search of our archival database, 22 cases of struma ovarii (20 benign and 2 malignant) diagnosed 
from 2003-2022 were identified. Cases were reviewed and a representative area was marked on a representative slide from each 
case. Sections from the corresponding paraffin embedded block were then subjected to mutational analysis using next generation 
sequencing with a panel of 61 genes. Molecular results were correlated with clinicopathologic features. 
Results: Of the 22 cases, 5 (23%) had detectable pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations (Table 1). PTEN mutations were seen 
in 3 cases (14%) while RAS mutations were seen in 2 of 22 cases (9%). One case had a likely pathogenic EIF1AX mutation. One 
case of malignant struma ovarii with microfollicular architecture exhibited two mutations, PTEN and HRAS in a patient who 
presented with advanced disease. One case of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) did not reveal any mutations. One case 
diagnosed as benign revealed an NRAS mutation and, on further review, had focal papillary architecture and cytologic features of 
PTC. Excluding the malignant case at presentation, none of the remaining 4 cases with mutations demonstrated evidence of 
disease progression on follow up.

Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a significant proportion of struma ovarii cases that appear benign on histology carry 
pathogenic mutations. Molecular testing can provide valuable information that can be used to more accurately diagnose and 
potentially better manage these cases. We suggest considering molecular testing on all struma ovarii cases irrespective of 
histologic diagnosis.

Background: Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is the most common uterine sarcoma (40-50%), comprising 1-2% of all uterine 
malignancies. Gynecologic LMS (GYN-LMS) is a highly aggressive tumor typically occurring in patients older than 50 years 
with incremental age-associated risk and carries an overall poor prognosis. The molecular landscape of GYN-LMS is complex and 
data regarding young patients is sparse. Current data focused on post-menopausal GYN-LMS implicates mutations 
in p53, ATRX, RB1, ATM, PTEN, CHEK2 and MED12, often with widespread chromosomal structural instability. Generally, tumors 
occurring in older patients show a more significant genomic complexity in contrast to their younger counterparts. We sought to 
explore molecular and clinicopathologic features of GYN-LMS in a well-annotated cohort of young premenopausal patients. 
 
  
 
S880 
Design: Institutional pathology archive was searched for GYN-LMS including uterus, adnexa, broad ligament and lower GYN tract. 
Clinicopathologic data was retrieved from clinical charts, pathology reports and comprehensive slide review: age, menopausal 
status, tumor site and size, histologic features and follow up data. DNA and RNA was extracted from FFPE blocks 
for sequencing (OCAPlus, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and data was compared to a cohort of 6 postmenopausal GYN-
LMS tumors. 
Results: Upon rereview 20 tumors were classified as LMS (n=20), while 4 tumors were excluded: 3 reclassified as smooth muscle 
tumor of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP) and 1 cervical tumor with TPM3::NTRK1 fusion. The age range was 29-49 years 
(median 41yo, average 40.1yo). Tumors occurred in uterus (n=18, 90%) and ovary (n=2, 10%), with size range of 1.8 -25cm 
(median 8.5cm). Follow up information was available in 17 cases (range 6-18 months, median 48 months). 13 patients experienced 
locoregional recurrence and/or distant metastasis (76%) and 4 patients died of disease (23%). Sequencing was successful in 17 
cases (85%) (Table1). Widespread chromosomal structural changes were seen in 8 tumors (47%).

Conclusions: TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene (10 tumors, 58%), followed by Rb1 (8 tumors, 47%) 
and ATRX1 (4 tumors, 23%). Most tumors had complex genetic makeup and numerous copy number changes. Our data highlights 
alterations in tumor suppressor genes and suggests significant overlap with molecular alterations often seen in post-menopausal 
GYN-LMS. This is in contrast to most other non-fusion driven tumors, which show incremental genomic complexity with age.

Background: The Amsterdam Consensus Statement introduced the term maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) to group a 
constellation of findings associated with impaired maternal-placental circulation. There remains uncertainty on how many, and 
which, findings are required for a pathologic diagnosis of MVM, and the diagnostic criteria are variably applied in practice. We aim 
to establish correlations between lesions associated with MVM and obstetric outcomes in a modern, well-characterized series of 
placentas, in order to determine criteria essential for the diagnosis of MVM. 
Design: Placentas reviewed at our institution within a 5-year period were retrieved. All material was reviewed to document MVM 
features including placental weight, accelerated villous maturation (AVM), decidual arteriopathy (DA), retroplacental hematoma 
(RPH), placental infarcts (PI) and distal villous hypoplasia (DVH). Obstetric outcomes in the current pregnancy were recorded 
included chronic hypertension, pre-eclampsia with or without severe features, gestational diabetes, prematurity, fetal growth 
 
  
 
S881 
restriction, and intrauterine fetal demise. Correlation between pathologic features (and their combination) and any obstetric / fetal 
outcome was obtained. 
Results: 200 cases were included (100 with a reported diagnosis of MVM, and 100 controls matched by maternal age and GPA-
status). On univariate logistic regression analysis, adverse maternal or fetal outcome was associated low placental weight (LPW, 
<10% percentile for gestational age), DA, PI, PI volume, AVM, and DVH (all p<0.01). In a multivariable model, DA, PI, and AVM 
were significantly associated with adverse fetal and/or maternal outcomes (Fig 1 shows odds ratio for each variable in multivariate 
model). A ROC curve including LPW, DA, PI and AVM showed good predictive ability (AUC 0.8256). A nomogram was used to 
calculate the probability of adverse outcome based on these pathologic features (Table 1).

Conclusions: In our series DA, AVM, PI, and LPW had the strongest association with obstetric or fetal outcomes in the index 
gestation. Based on our analysis, we recommend consistent reporting of these features, summarizing them as “diagnostic of MVM” 
if there is DA or AVM plus any other of these features (yielding a probability of 65-97% for adverse obstetric outcomes) and 
“suggestive of MVM” if only one feature, or PI + LPW only (probability of up to 52%). Other features such as DVH and RPH can 
also be reported, although their correlation with MVM-related outcomes is less certain.

Background: Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignant neoplasm of the female genital tract. Despite a good overall 
prognosis, it has a significant morbidity associated with treatment and a dismal prognosis when the disease recurs. Tumor budding, 
a common finding in colorectal cancer, can be associated with prognosis and can aid the multidisciplinary team in making better 
decisions regarding the patient’s treatment. 
Design: In this project a total of 143 patients with endometrial cancer who underwent hysterectomy with or without lymph node 
evaluation were selected, and their surgical specimens were evaluated for tumor budding. Buddings were defined as groups of at 
least 5 neoplastic cells. The most common prognostic features were evaluated in relation to the presence or absence of tumor 
buddings. 
Results: Median follow-up for the population was 36 months; the presence of tumor budding was associated with higher 
histological grade, angiolymphatic invasion, and lymph node spread (p = 0.011, p < 0.001, and p = 0.040, respectively). There was 
no difference in the overall survival between the groups (p = 0.610).

Background: Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is classified by the Bokhman system in types I (low grade) and II (high grade). Many 
biomarkers are necessary to improve prognostic evaluation, such as L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), a membrane glycoprotein 
frequently detected in solid tumors. L1CAM performs an essential role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition in tumor cells. EC with 
high L1CAM expression displays a more aggressive phenotype. 
Design: Retrospective cohort study evaluating 356 EC cases from Jan/2007 to Dec/2017. Tissue Microarray (TMA) blocks were 
prepared with and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for L1CAM and p53 was performed. L1CAM expression was considered negative 
 
  
 
S884 
(completely negative membrane staining) or positive (at least 10% of positive membrane staining). p53 expression was also 
evaluated by IHC, and considered aberrant (null, strong and diffuse positivity or cytoplasmatic expression) or non-aberrant. DNA 
mismatch-repair protein expression was evaluated by IHC for PMS2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6. Statistical analysis was performed by 
parametric tests (chi-square teste for categorical variables) to determine relation between L1CAM expression and clinico-
pathological factors. Survival analyses were performed by the Kaplan Meier method using the logrank test. 
Results: Final sample consisted of 295 cases. 282 (95.5%) were negative and 13 (4.5%) positive (staining 10-90%). L1CAM 
expression associated with non-endometrioid histology (n=11 – 84.6% – p value < 0.0001). FIGO stage 3 was predominant (n=10 – 
76.9% – p value < 0.0001). Other parameters (myometrial invasion, angiolymphatic invasion, MELF pattern and lymph node 
metastasis) are listed on table 1, and albeit with numerical difference, did not demonstrate statistical significance for the interaction. 
L1CAM expression was evaluated in 44 p53 aberrant cases and 9 (20.5%) were L1CAM positive – p value < 0.0001. 8 (61.5%) 
L1CAM positive cases were mismatch-repair proficient (p value = 0.414). There was no difference in overall survival (OS) and 
progression free survival (PFS) among L1CAM positive and negative patients.

Conclusions: L1CAM expression is associated with factors of worse prognosis that are intrinsic to the tumor. It is a simple 
biomarker, evaluated by IHC, and a potentially valuable tool in the clinical setting. However, there was no correlation between 
L1CAM expression and survival, and further studies are necessary to demonstrate what is the factual role of L1CAM as a 
biomarker in EC.

Background: Human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules play an important role in regulating immune response. Loss of 
HLA-I expression results in tumor immune escape from cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The aim of the study is to investigate HLA-I

pathologic features, and prognosis. 
 
  
 
S885 
Design: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) are used to assign TCGA molecular EC subgroups: 
POLE mutant (POLE), mismatch repair deficient (MMRd), p53 mutant (p53abn), and no specific molecular profile (NSMP). IHC 
expression of HLA-I, CD20, CD3, CD8, PD-1, PD-L1, CD68 has been assessed and quantified by digital image analysis on whole 
tumor tissue sections. 
Results: 199 ECs have been stratified into 4 molecular subtypes: 16 (8.4%) POLE, 66 (33.2%) MMRd, 39 (19.6%) p53abn and 78 
NSMP (39.2%). Loss of HLA-I expression is associated with several pathologic features such as high grade (p=0.01), extensive 
tumor necrosis (p<0.001), high mitotic activity (p<0.001), substantial lymphovascular invasion (p<0.001), budding (p=0.029), 
absence of tumoral PD-L1 expression (p=0.001), and high peri-tumoral expression of CD68 (p<0.001), PD-L1(p=0.001) and CD20 
(p=0.001). The percentage of cases with HLA-I loss is different in the four molecular subgroups: 12 (75%) POLE, 29 (43.9%) 
MMRd, 9 p53abn (23.1%), 13 NSMP (20%) subtypes. In our cohort, EC molecular subtypes are statistically associated with 
different clinical outcomes (see Figure 1). In addition, the integration of pathologic features, HLA-I expression and immune markers 
distribution has improved prognostic stratification of NSMP tumors (see Figure 2). Specifically, high grade, substantial 
lymphovascular invasion and HLA-I loss revealed a strong correlation with disease recurrence (p<0.001). Loss of HLA-I expression 
is associated with aggressive pathologic features in EC. In particular, evaluation of HLA-I may represent an additional prognostic 
parameter in identifying disease recurrence in the NSMP subgroup. Our findings highlight the role of HLA-I alterations in the 
immune evasion mechanisms and in the progression of endometrial carcinoma.

Background: STK11 adnexal tumor is a rare recently described entity, which is important to recognize because of its strong 
association with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. However, it is challenging to correctly diagnose because it shows significant 
morphologic variability, has a non-specific immunoprofile, and currently requires molecular studies for diagnosis. We sought to 
investigate the diagnostic utility of STK11 immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a cohort of STK11 adnexal tumors and its morphologic 
mimics. 
Design: STK11 adnexal tumors [n=7] and potential mimics were retrospectively identified from the files of 4 institutions. Molecular 
profiling of tumors was performed when possible. IHC was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue using an anti-
STK11 monoclonal antibody (clone D60C5F10; 1:1000 dilution). STK11 staining was scored as either positive/intact (positive 
cytoplasmic staining in all tumor cells) or negative/lost (complete loss of cytoplasmic staining in tumor cells with intact staining in 
internal controls). 
Results: The clinicopathologic, IHC and molecular findings are summarized in Table 1, and representative cases are illustrated in 
Figure 1. All 7 STK11 adnexal tumors showed complete loss of expression of STK11. All 50 mimics of STK11 adnexal tumor 
showed retained expression of STK11 (adult granulosa cell tumor [n=10], ovarian endometrioid carcinoma [n=8], tubo-ovarian high 
grade serous carcinoma [n=8], female adnexal tumor of Wolffian origin [FATWO, n=7], sex-cord tumor with annular tubules 
[SCTAT, n=7], Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor [n=4], steroid cell tumor [n=1], extraovarian sex-cord stromal tumor [n=2], ovarian clear cell 
carcinoma [n=1], microscopic extraovarian sex-cord proliferation [n=1], and periovarian plexiform leiomyoma [n=1]). Molecular 
testing was performed on 24 non-STK11 adnexal tumors, and none showed STK11 alterations.

Conclusions: STK11 IHC is a sensitive and specific marker for STK11 adnexal tumor. Compared to STK11 sequencing, 
STK11 IHC is more cost-effective and is potentially more sensitive since there is loss of expression in tumors with copy number 
loss, and this alteration is not assessed/reported on all molecular assays. Loss of expression of STK11 appears to be a reliable 
surrogate for molecular studies to differentiate STK11 adnexal tumor from its morphologic mimics, and our data suggests that 
sequencing is no longer required for the diagnosis of STK11 adnexal tumor if STK11 IHC is supportive of the diagnosis in the 
appropriate morphologic context.

Background: Uterine inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT) are rare mesenchymal neoplasms with a relatively low risk of 
malignancy. Although tumor size > 7 cm, moderate to severe atypia, frequent mitoses, necrosis, and LVI are associated with 
malignancy, even histologically banal IMTs may recur. A recent study noted a correlation among complete loss of p16 
immunohistochemistry, CDKN2A deletions, and malignancy, independent of tumor morphology. Herein, we evaluate the 
morphology, p16 status, and genomic profile of a cohort of malignant IMTs (mIMT). 
Design: 10 mIMTs, all with ALK fusions and metastases at diagnosis (n=5) or recurrences (n=5), as well as 3 benign IMTs (bIMT, 
median follow-up: 53 months) were retrospectively evaluated. For 2 mIMTs, only the recurrence was available for review. p16 was 
performed on all tumors, with aberrant expression defined by positivity in < 1% or > 90% of tumor cells. Next-generation 
sequencing using a 1004-gene panel or comparative genomic hybridization was performed on IMTs with available tissue (n=11). 
Results: Patients with mIMTs ranged from 8–65 (median: 53) years and tumors from 3.5–20 (median: 13.8) cm. In the primary 
mIMTs (n=8), 6 were predominantly spindled and 2 epithelioid, with at least moderate atypia in 6. Necrosis was noted in 5, LVI in 4, 
and mitoses ranged from 0–18 (median 5.5) per 10 HPFs. In contrast, all bIMTs had mild atypia, < 3 mitoses/10 HPFs, lacked 
 
  
 
S888 
necrosis and LVI, and only 1 was > 7 cm. Clinicopathological features are summarized in table. Aberrant p16 expression was noted 
in all mIMTs, with < 1% positivity seen in 7 and > 90% in 3; all bIMTs had non-specific staining (30%, 40%, 50%) (Figure 
1). CDKN2A deletions were detected in 6 mIMTs, all characterized by < 1% p16 expression. Two also harbored 
concurrent CDKN2B deletions. No alterations were detected in mIMTs with > 90% p16 expression as well as all bIMTs. Molecular 
findings are highlighted in Figure 2. 
 
 
  
 
S889 
Figure 1 - 888 
 
Figure 2 - 888 
 
Conclusions: mIMTs are associated with aberrant p16 expression and commonly CDKN2A deletions, independent of tumor 
morphology. Use of p16 immunohistochemistry is recommended in all uterine IMTs for risk stratification and management. Further 
studies are warranted to explore the pathobiology of mIMTs with diffuse (> 90%) p16 expression.

Background: Uterine epithelioid leiomyosarcoma is a morphologic variant of malignant smooth muscle tumors. Due to the rarity of 
epithelioid leiomyosarcomas, genetic abnormalities are seldom reported until the recent discovery of progesterone receptor (PGR) 
rearrangements. So far, NR4A3 and UBR5 are prime partners of PGR rearrangements in epithelioid leiomyosarcomas. 
Design: In this report, we described a unique case of epithelioid leiomyosarcoma harboring a novel PGR:: NR4A2 (nuclear 
receptor subfamily 4 group A member 2) fusion, which occurred in a 42-year-old woman who had a mass in the myometrium. The 
patient underwent hysterectomy and then relapsed 29 months later with a large mass in the pelvic cavity. 
Results: Histologically, the relapsed pelvic neoplasm was solid-cystic. The tumor was composed of round/polygonal or rhabdoid 
cells, spindle cells and large amount of myxoid matrix. Immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse staining of ER, PR, and Desmin and 
focal staining of h-caldesmon in tumor cells. CD10, ALK, and BCOR were all negative. Furthermore, next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) revealed PGR:: NR4A2 rearrangement that fused PGR exon 2 to NR4A2 exon 1.

Conclusions: In conclusion, we report a case of uterus epithelioid leiomyosarcoma showing a large amount of myxoid matrix and 
harboring PGR::NR4A2 rearrangement. PGR::NR4A rearrangement expands the molecular spectrum of PGR-rearranged 
epithelioid leiomyosarcomas.

Disclosures: Rawda Elshennawy: None; Jason Yap: None; Raji Ganesan: None; Andrew Turnell: None 
Background: More than 96% of tubo-ovarian high grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) will harbor a Tp53 mutation which can be 
detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). About 66% of these are missense mutations affecting the DNA binding domain resulting 
in p53 overexpression by IHC. Another 25% are nonsense or frameshift mutations that result in complete absence of p53 
expression in the tumor. Less common mutations include those affecting the nuclear localization signal resulting in cytoplasmic p53 
expression and truncating mutations affecting the C-terminal domain resulting in wild type like staining. Mosaic or heterogeneous 
p53 expression has been reported in endometrial carcinoma but not in HGSC. We report 9 cases of HGSC with mosaic p53 
expression by IHC and correlate with survival and clinicopathological parameters. 
Design: Tissue blocks of 100 HGSC females were collected from a large Gynecologic Oncology tertiary referral centre in the 
United Kingdom. The DO-1 clone of p53 was applied on tissue sections after proper optimization and validation in an automated 
IHC platform. Clinicopathological data collected included age, FIGO stage, type of surgery, volume of residual disease after 
surgery, lymph node status, chemotherapy response score, platinum resistance, BRCA mutation, progression-free (PFS) and 
Overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare survival differences between the p53 expression groups and 
clinicopathological parameters were compared for any prognostic significance. 
Results: P53 overexpression was seen in 65 cases, null pattern in 23 cases, cytoplasmic in 3 and 9 showed a combination of 
overexpression and wild type like staining. (Figure 1) When comparing OS, the mosaic p53 cases exhibited the shortest median 
 
  
 
S891 
OS (28.2 months) followed by the null cases (37.4 months). The p53 overexpressing cases had an intermediate median OS (51.8 
months), while the cytoplasmic showed the longest (80.5 months). The difference was not statistically significant (Log 
rank X2=2.073, p=0.557). (Figure 2) PFS was not significantly different between the four groups (Log rank X2=0.602, p=0.896). For 
statistical reasons, the null and cytoplasmic p53 cases were omitted. Clinicopathological parameters were compared in the mosaic 
and overexpression groups. (Table 1)

Background: Tubo-ovarian high grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common ovarian cancer whose genetic profile is 
marked by early Tp53 mutation. It is the 5th leading cause of cancer-related deaths in females & a significant contributor to female 
morbidity worldwide. Despite advances in our understanding of the molecular pathology of HGSC, treatment modalities remain at a 
standstill & have not improved patient survival. Therefore, we continue to investigate the biological mechanisms that underpin the 
aggressive behaviour of these tumours to identify new molecular targets. UbcH10 is an E2-conjugating enzyme for the Anaphase-
Promoting Complex/Cyclosome that regulates cell-cycle progression, by promoting the degradation of mitotic regulators through 
ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. UbcH10 is also a proto-oncogene whose aberrant expression has been reported in numerous 
cancers, making it a potential cancer biomarker for the prognosis of HGSC. 
Design: Multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to investigate the expression of UbcH10 & p53 in HGSC. IHC was 
performed on three main HGSC cohorts: the 1st consisted of 100 cases of whole tumour sections; the 2nd of 81 cases of 
tumour constructed on tissue microarrays(TMA) for validation. The 3rd cohort included 24 cases with matched serous tubal 
intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) samples to measure disease progression. In these cohorts, we investigated the relative protein 
expression of UbcH10, its relation to p53 mutation & Ki67 index, as well as its effect on patient outcome. We used 2 scoring 
systems for UbcH10 (IRS and H-score} & divided our patients into low and high UbcH10 expressors based on cut-off values 
generated by the bioinformatics tool X-tile; the data was analyzed & modelled using the Cox proportional hazards model. 
Results: UbcH10 overexpression did not significantly impact survival nor correlate with p53 mutation & prognostic parameters in 
the 1st cohort (Table 1). In the TMA cohort, Ubch10 negatively impacted OS {HR=1.1, 95%C.I(1.008, 1.223), p=0.032} (Figure 1) 
The trend was maintained in PFS but was not significant (Log rank X2=1.591, p=0.163). UbcH10 expression in STICs were 
comparable to their matched HGSC (U=233, p=0.261). A significant positive correlation was detected between UbcH10 and Ki67 
index (ρ=0.48,p=0.021) (Figure 2)

892    Many Faces of Cellular Angiofibroma: Variable Morphology of Rare Sarcomatous 
Transformation

1Emory University, Atlanta, GA 
Disclosures: Anna Sarah Erem: None; Sandra Gjorgova Gjeorgjievski: None; Krisztina Hanley: None; Gulisa Turashvili: None 
Background: Cellular angiofibromas (CAFs) are benign mesenchymal neoplasms of the vulva and lower genitourinary tract. 
Recurrences, cytologic atypia, and sarcomatous transformation are extremely uncommon. We aimed to describe detailed 
clinicopathologic features of CAF with and without sarcomatous transformation in a female population. 
Design: We are presenting complete resection specimens of CAFs, retrieved from our institution's surgical and consultation files 
between 2010 and 2022. Clinical data was obtained from the electronic medical records, and microscopic slides were reviewed. 
Results: A total of 17 CAFs were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 49 years (32-68). All tumors were located within the 
subcutis, and ranged in size from 0.5 to 5 cm (median 3 cm). CAF were histologically characterized by bland spindle cell 
proliferation, variable amounts of adipose tissue, mast cells and numerous medium-sized thick-walled vessels. Infiltrative borders 
were seen in 4, fascicular growth in 9, and chronic perivascular or stromal inflammation in 15 cases. Stromal edema (8) and fat 
entrapment (9) were common. Rare histologic features included myxoid changes (3), vascular thrombosis (1) and 
hemangiopericytoma-like vasculature (4). Cytologic atypia was seen in 3 cases, presenting as scattered multinucleated cells. CD34 
and desmin were positive in 12 and 2 tumors, respectively, while Rb-1 was lost in 2 cases. Six CAFs had sarcomatous 
transformation, ranging from 10-80% of overall tumor volume. Abrupt transition between sarcoma and CAF was seen in 4 cases, 
gradual transition in 2 cases, and 1 CAF had multiple sarcomatous foci. Three of 6 cases showed increased mitotic activity (up to 
28 per 10 HPF), whereas the remaining 3 had ≤3 mitoses per 10 HPF. Diffuse p16 expression was present in 2 cases with 
sarcomatous transformation, which was not seen in any of the CAFs lacking sarcomatous transformation. Only 1 case of CAF with 
sarcomatous transformation recurred upon re-excision. 
Conclusions: Common histologic features of CAF include fascicular growth, stromal edema, and myxoid changes. Infiltrative 
borders are uncommon, while perivascular and stromal inflammation is frequently present. A subset of CAFs in female patients is 
associated with sarcomatous transformation (seen in 35% of our cases) with rare local recurrences but no distant metastases. 
Diffuse expression of p16 may have diagnostic significance in CAFs with sarcomatous transformation.

893    Malignant Rhabdoid Tumors of the Vulva: “In the Dark, Everything Looks Alike”: A 
Clinicopathologic, Immunohistochemical, and Molecular Genetics Study

Disclosures: Iñigo Espinosa: None; Emanuela D'Angelo: None; Louise De Brot: None; Jaime Prat: None 
Background: It has been suggested that most, if not all, extrarenal rhabdoid tumors of the vulva represent “proximal-type” 
epithelioid sarcomas. 
Design: To better understand rhabdoid tumors of the vulva, we studied the clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical (IHC), and 
molecular features of 5 of these tumors and 6 extragenital epithelioid sarcomas. IHC analysis for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, EMA, S100, 
CD34, smooth muscle actin, desmin, and SMARCB1 (INI1) was performed. Ultrastructural study was done in one rhabdoid tumor. 
Next generation sequencing of the SMARCB1 gene was performed in all cases. 
Results: The 5 vulvar tumors occurred in adult women (mean age 52). They were poorly differentiated neoplasms with a rhabdoid 
morphology. The ultrastructural study showed large amounts of intermediate filaments (10 nm). All cases had loss of expression of 
INI1 and were negative for CD34. No SMARCB1 mutations were found. Follow-up revealed that 3 patients died of disease, 1 was 
alive with disease, and 1 was alive without evidence of disease. The epithelioid sarcomas occurred in young adults (mean age 33). 
Three cases arose in the distal extremities and the other three had a proximal location. They showed the characteristic 
“granulomatous” arrangement of the neoplastic cells. The recurrent tumors were more proximal and often showed a rhabdoid 
morphology. All cases had loss of expression of INI1. CD34 was expressed by 3 of 6 cases. No SMARCB1 mutations were 
encountered. Follow-up revealed that 2 patients died of disease, 1 was alive with disease, and 3 were alive without evidence of 
disease. 
Conclusions: Based on their different morphology and biologic behavior, we conclude that rhabdoid tumors of the vulva and 
epithelioid sarcomas are different diseases with distinct clinicopathologic features. Undifferentiated vulvar tumors with rhabdoid 
morphology should be classified as malignant rhabdoid tumors, rather than “proximal-type” epithelioid sarcomas. The term 
“proximal-type” epithelioid sarcoma is artificial even if malignant rhabdoid tumors of the vulva may overlap morphologically with 
recurrent epithelioid sarcomas exhibiting a rhabdoid phenotype.

Background: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network identified four molecular subgroups of endometrial 
carcinomas with different prognosis: ultramutated (POLE mut); hypermutated (MMRd); low degree of copy-number (NSMP); and 
high degree of copy-number (p53abn). The aim of this study is to know the incidence of the molecular subgroups in a Spanish 
population and evaluate the utility of TCGA classification in the diagnosis and management of the patients. 
Design: We studied 220 consecutive endometrial carcinomas diagnosed between 2015-2022 at the Sant Pau Hospital and Taulí 
Hospital (Barcelona). IHC for p53 and the mismatch repair proteins was performed. All patients were also tested for POLE-EDM by 
Sanger sequencing. 
Results: Patient age ranged from 33 to 99 (median 69) years. 184 cases (84%) were endometrioid and 36 cases (16%) non-
endometrioid. Grade distribution of the endometrioid carcinomas included 79 (43%) G1, 66 (36%) G2, and 39 (21%) G3 tumors. 
Molecular classification yielded 11 (5%) POLE mut, 56 (26%) MMRd, 117 (53%) NSMP, and 36 (16%) p53abn. POLE mut cases 
included 1 DDC, 2 G1 EECs, 4 G2 EECs, and 4 G3 EECs. 5 patients had stage IA disease and 5 patients had stage IB. Four 
tumors had also p53 aberrant expression and two cases had loss of MLH1 and PMS2 proteins. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given 
to one patient while the rest of the patients did not receive adjuvant treatment. Follow-up revealed that all patients were alive 
without evidence of disease. MMRd cases included 53 EECs, 2 DDC, and 1 CS. Four cases of Lynch Syndrome were detected. 
NSMP cases included 115 EECs, 1 MC (EEC+CCC), and 1 CCC. p53 mut cases comprised 15 SCs, 6 G3 EECs, 11 CSs, 2 UCs,

Conclusions: The only novel and exclusive contribution of the TCGA classification is the discovery of the POLE mut ECs. These 
patients, if they carry pathogenic mutations, have a very good prognosis and could benefit from a de-escalating adjuvant

treatment. However, the incidence of these tumors is low. Multiple classifier endometrial carcinomas having both POLE-mutated 
tumors and abnormal p53 expression or MMRd, should be classified as POLE. Grade 1 and 2 EECs with aberrant expression of 
p53 are extremely rare. Our results show that morphology (H&E) is still the best method for the diagnosis/classification of 
endometrial carcinomas and even provides valuable prognostic information.

Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping targets LNs most likely to harbor metastases (MT) providing staging information 
in endometrial carcinoma (ECa) without the morbidities associated with LN dissection. We present the results of LN pathology in 
ECa since SLN mapping became routine at our institution 10 years ago.  
Design: We identified ECa with at least one mapped SLN (n=1073; 2013 to 2022); for comparison we retrieved consecutive ECa 
with LN dissection (LND) (n=695; 2002-2012). SLNs negative by initial hematoxylin&eosin (H&E) exam underwent ultrastaging 
(US) by one of two methods: 5 sets of 1 H&E + 2 unstained slides (USS) at 250 μm intervals with pankeratin immunohistochemistry 
(ICH) on level 1 (2013-2014) or 1 H&E + 2 USS cut 250 μm into the block and pankeratin IHC (2015-2022). We recorded tumor 
histotype, SLN status, MT size, if MT detected by US, and presence of MT in unmapped LN with negative SLNs. For LND cases we 
recorded presence and size of largest LN MT. 
Results: ECa with SLN MT had the following histotypes: endometrioid FIGO 1-2, 86; endometrioid FIGO 3, 13; clear cell, 4; 
serous, 24; carcinosarcoma, 22; high grade mixed, 20; high grade NOS, 9; undifferentiated, 6; mesonephric-like, 3. 187(17%) ECa 
with SLN mapping and 142(20%) with LND had LN MTs. Table 1 shows the MT size distribution for SLN and LN dissection 
cases. In SLN cases, 98(52%) cases had MTs detected by routine H&E; 78(42%) by US; and 11(6%) had negative SLN with LN 
MTs in an unmapped LN. 8 SLNs with microMT or ITC had a positive nonSLN: 6 at the same ipsi- or contralateral level; 2 had ITC 
in aortic LNs. 6 ECa (4 serous, 1 carcinosarcoma, 1 endometrioid FIGO 2) without myometrial invasion had SLN MT (4 on initial 
H&E; 2 by US).

Conclusions: MT rate in ECa is similar between SLN mapping (17%) and LND (21%). Low or ultralow volume MTs were more 
common in SLN (69% vs 23% for LND) possibly due to utilization of US. US increased LN MT detection by just over 1.5 times 
above that detected by routine H&E examination emphasizing the need to incorporate US into routine practice. Much of 
the increase is due to detection of low and ultralow volume MTs. The significance of ITCs requires further study; but 8 SLNs with 
ITCs had tumor in nonSLN, including 2 cases with positive para-aortic LNs. Six (3%) ECa had a SLN MT in the absence of 
myometrial invasion with 2 cases detected by US. These findings underscore the need for US as a part of SLN examination even in 
the absence of myoinvasive ECa.

Background: Leiomyoma with bizarre nuclei (LMBN) is a rare variant of leiomyoma with a benign clinical course. In contrast, 
leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a malignant neoplasm with poor survival. While LMBN and LMS show distinct histology, they show 
similar immunophenotype and molecular features. Rare cases of LMBN associated with LMS have been reported, however the 
relationship between them is unclear. We analyzed 10 cases of LMS arising in conjunction with LMBN to elucidate clinical, 
histologic, digital, and molecular characteristics. 
 
  
 
S897 
Design: Ten cases of LMS arising in conjunction with LMBN were included. Select slides were examined by IHC to confirm LMS 
and LMBN components and scanned by whole slide imaging. Virtual images were analyzed by automated intelligence with aid of 
QuPath software for cyto-histologic and distribution patterns of LMS, LMBN, and myometrium. DNA from LMS and adjacent LMBN 
was isolated from FFPE tissue for molecular analysis on Affymetrix OncoScan® CNA arrays (Table 1). Additionally, 10 LMS cases 
and 13 LMBN sporadic cases were selected as controls for CNA analysis.  
Results: The 10 cases displayed presence of both LMBN and LMS areas.  IHC and digital image analysis demonstrated that 
LMBN and LMS were physically separated in three growth patterns: adjacent, circumferential, and separate nodules (Figure 1A-C). 
Digital analysis of these lesions revealed LMBN had significantly increased nuclear hyperchromasia in comparison to LMS and 
myometrium (p=0.004, p<0.001). Higher nuclear: cytoplasmic ratios were seen in LMS (p<0.0001) (Figure 1D). Both components 
had similar p16 and p53 IHC patterns, but LMS had higher Ki-67 index and lower ER/PR expression. Clonal analysis revealed 9 
cases of LMS were from existing LMBN due to their identical genomic CNA and LOH. Common genomic losses 
of TP53, RB1, PTEN and CDKN2A/B were identified in LMS. In sporadic cases of LMS and LMBN, frequent CNA in 42 genomic 
regions were identified and 37 of them shared by both tumor types (Figure 2A-B).

Conclusions: We present 10 cases of LMS arising in conjunction with LMBN. Molecular analysis demonstrated the same clonal 
origin of both tumor types in a majority of cases, with shared IHC and genomic alterations, suggesting that some LMS arise from 
existing LMBN. AI imaging analysis further reveals spatial relationships between LMS and LMBN, and digital image analysis 
demonstrates significant differences in nuclear size, shape, and chromatin patterns between LMBN and LMS, confirming their 
different tumor nature.

Background: Uterine leiomyosarcomas (LMS) are a rare malignancy with an overall poor survival. While conventional LMS can be 
graded low or high grade on a two-tier system, the adoption of such systems and application for clinical outcome produces mixed 
results. Global methylation profile (GMP) is a useful tool for tumor classification with most success in brain tumors. GMP in 
sarcomas is currently being explored, and its value in classification and diagnosis remains to be determined. We aimed to explore 
the clinical utility of GMP in LMS and explore its associations with histology and clinical outcomes. 
Design: 47 LMS cases were selected. Select slides for each case were reviewed to define histologic findings, and the patient’s 
clinical information was reviewed. Tumor DNA was prepared, and GMP was conducted using 850k probes with the Illumina 
Infinium Methylation EPIC array. Unsupervised clustering analysis was performed with t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor 
Embedding (tSNE) using ? values from the 10k and 32k most variable probes. Differential methylation analysis was performed, and 
the probes identified were visualized using a heatmap. Statistical analysis was calculated utilizing the one-way ANOVA or Chi-
square.  
Results: Among 47 LMS, 41 cases yielded high quality GMP data for analysis. The clinical and histologic features of the cases are 
summarized in Table 1.  t-SNE plot analysis showed LMS presented 3-4 aggregates of subclusters defined as clusters 1-3, 
separated from most reference sarcomas (Figure 1A). Further analysis revealed that LMS subclusters had significant differences in 
association with histologic and clinical characters (Table 1).  Cluster 1 showed higher numbers of low grade cases (p=0.0332) and 
stage I tumor (p=0.0218), higher p53 (26%) and MED12 (17%) mutations, lower Ki-67 index (25%), and lower recurrence rates 
(47%).   Both 10K and 32K CpG probes demonstrated the distinct clusters of low and high-grade LMS (Figure 1B). Additionally, 
different methylation patterns were seen in different tumor stages (Figure 1C). 
 
 
  
 
S900 
Figure 1 – 897 
 
 
Conclusions: GMP is emerging as a powerful tool for tumor classification, with Mullerian LMS readily classified in distinct clusters. 
While methylation can clearly distinguish and classify low and high grade LMS and FIGO stage, the power to classify histologic 
subtype and survival is currently limited. Additionally, the genetic heterogeneity of LMS can lead to methylation mapping 
differences, most commonly to undifferentiated sarcomas.

Background: The Proactive Molecular Risk Classifier for Endometrial Cancer (ProMisE) was developed as a practical method to 
improve patient prognostication over conventional histologic classification alone. Our institution, which provides hybrid academic-
community care, was one of the first to develop and integrate a local ProMisE protocol (Figure 1) into our daily practice, which went 
live 10/01/2021. This study aimed to assess its initial performance and identify areas for process improvement. 
Design: We conducted a retrospective search of all patients who underwent primary resection for an endometrial carcinoma in our 
institution from 10/01/2021-09/15/2022 and compared the distribution of molecular and traditional staging factors to available 
literature. Clinical risk stratification was designated using GOG-99 criteria. 
Results: We identified 259 patients who underwent primary resection for endometrial cancer from 10/01/2021-09/15/2022, of which 
136 (52.5%) were clinically classified as low risk (LR). Overall, 30.9% (80/259) of tumors were MMR-deficient, 13.1% (34/259) were 
TP53-mutated, 2.3% (6/259) were POLE-mutated, 27.8% (72/259) had no specific molecular profile (NSMP) and 25.9% (67/259) 
failed to receive full ProMisE protocol testing and were therefore classified as endometrioid, NOS (not otherwise specified). Of the 
72 NSMP cases, 13 (18.1%) were beta-catenin-mutated and 9 (12.5%) were L1CAM positive, although only 52 (72.2%) NSMP 
cases received L1CAM testing. Ten and three LR patients were found to have beta-catenin-mutated and L1CAM positive NSMP 
tumors, respectively. In addition, seven endometrioid tumors were found to harbor TP53 mutations on NGS, two of which were LR. 
 
  
 
S901 
Figure 1 - 898 
 
Conclusions: Our ProMisE protocol identified 15 of 136 (11.0%) clinically low risk tumors following conventional histologic 
classification that are harboring incipient high risk molecular aberrations in beta-catenin, L1CAM, and TP53. After accounting for 
protocol non-adherence, the molecular distribution of our cohort is compatible with TCGA (The Cancer Genome Altas) statistics. 
Initiating L1CAM studies earlier in the protocol and improving protocol compliance, especially in the community setting, would 
increase detection of LR tumors with incipient high risk molecular aberrations. Overall, initial review of our protocol is encouraging; 
however, longterm survival data and results of ongoing trials assessing the role of molecular-based adjuvant therapy are required 
to confirm the protocol’s clinical utility.

Background: Grading of neuroendocrine tumors (NET) varies by anatomic site. However, markers of cell proliferation are common 
to most, as they are associated with patient outcome. Currently, there is no formal grading system for primary ovarian carcinoid 
tumors (pOCT). There is also limited data on prognosis and expected immunophenotype of these tumors. This study aims to 
provide a detailed clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical analysis of pOCTs and document the role of mitotic count and Ki67 
proliferation index in prognosis and classification. 
Design: Twenty-one pOCTs were retrieved from the archives of 2 institutions. Clinical, pathologic and follow-up data were 
obtained. Histologic sections were reviewed and pOCT subtype and mitotic index (per 2mm2) were recorded. A panel of 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) including Ki67, Chromogranin, Synaptophysin, TTF1, PAX8, CDX2, p53, MSH6, PMS2, ATRX, PTEN 
and PDL1 was performed. Ki67 index was determined by counting 500 cells in areas of increased labelling. 
Results: Clinicopathologic and IHC findings are summarized in Table 1. The mean mitotic rate was 3.1 (range 0-23). The mitotic 
rate was <2 in 57.1% of cases (12/21), between 2 and 20 in 38.1% of cases (8/21) and >20 in 4.8% of cases (1/21). The mean 
Ki67 index was 9.6% (range 1-59%). The Ki67 index was <3% in 47.6% of cases (10/21), between 3 and 20% in 38.1% of cases 
(8/21) and >20% in 14.3% of cases (3/21). Most pOCTs presented as Stage IA disease (13/21; 61.9%), of which 5 had Ki67 
indexes >3%. The overall range of Ki67 for Stage IA cases was 1-20%. There were 5 cases of Stage IC disease (23.8%), which 
 
  
 
S902 
showed a wide variation in Ki67 index (range 1-36%); of which none had disease recurrence. Extraovarian spread was noted in 3 
cases (14.3%), all of which had Ki67 indexes >3% (range 4-59%). Local recurrence occurred in 1 case (4.8%), which had pelvic 
sidewall involvement at the time of diagnosis and a Ki67 index of 59%. Follow-up, ranging from 1.5 to 149 months (mean 67.5), 
showed no disease-related deaths.

Conclusions: Most pOCTs behave in an indolent fashion; however, extraovarian spread and recurrence can be observed. 
Although local recurrence occurred in one case, disease-related death or distant metastases did not occur. Frequent staining with 
TTF1 and CDX2 was also observed, limiting their utility in the distinction between pOCT and metastatic NET. Our findings support 
the notion that most pOCTs behave as low grade neoplasms with excellent prognosis and show that Ki67 is highly variable and can 
be increased even in pOCTs with indolent follow-up.

Background: With the evolution of genomic tumor characterization of endometrial carcinoma (EC), universal molecular subtyping 
has been proposed to better define its prognostic subgroups. This is, however, a resource-intensive practice for a publicly funded 
healthcare system. This study’s aim was to summarize our Canadian laboratory experience with reflex molecular subtyping of EC 
and to examine its impact on clinical management. 
Design: POLE sequencing was performed on 135 biopsy or resection EC specimens from September 2021-present.  All cases 
were initially tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMR and p53, as per our universal reflex EC testing policy. POLE testing 
criteria included: High grade (HG) EC; Low grade (LG) ECs (endometrioid gr1 or 2) with an abnormal MMR and/or p53 result; 
Clinician request; Pathologist discretion. 
Results: Pathogenic POLE mutations and EC molecular classification were designated as per current literature. Table 1 shows 
ECs categorized by histologic vs. molecular subtype. In 5 cases, p53 IHC was equivocal and presence of TP53 pathogenic 
mutations was used to classify them. The pathogenic POLEmut rate in our cohort was 5.2% (7/135). 6 cases with POLE variant of 
uncertain significance were considered POLEwt when assigning the molecular subtype.  Among the 118 HGEC, 58 (49.1%) were 
not further subclassified histologically (HGEC unclassified). 35(60.0%) of these were diagnosed on biopsy. POLE testing on LGECs 
was requested by radiation oncology in at least 6 cases with Stage ≥ 1b and/or extensive lymphovascular invasion (LVI); in 4 of 
these cases with POLEwt adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) was administered. In one endometrioid gr 1, stage 2, case with 
extensive LVI and POLEmut, ART was given but chemotherapy was withheld.  Only 4 HGEC cases (1 serous, 3 HGEC 
unclassified) with pathogenic POLEmut were identified. In one case (HGEC unclassified, stage 1a), ART was withheld. 2 cases are 
recent and clinical management is pending.

Conclusions: Judicious resource utilization in a publicly funded healthcare system is key to its sustainability. For LGEC cases 
without p53 or MMR IHC abnormalities, it may be appropriate to withhold POLE testing from reflex testing, as radiation oncology 
will identify cases under ART consideration. For management of HGECs, more information is still needed. Interestingly, with 
molecular subtyping, a strong pathologist trend emerged to not further histologically subclassify HGEC, particularly on endometrial 
biopsies.

Background: High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSO) is the deadliest form of ovarian cancer. While cancers such as 
cervical cancer have clearly mapped developmental stages, the development of HGSO is not well understood. Recent theories 
suggest HGSO may develop from serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs), precursor lesions in the fallopian tubes which 
migrate to and colonize the ovaries. STICs are believed to stem from fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells (FTSECs), one of two 
major classes of epithelial cell in the fallopian tubes. The spatial distribution, prevalence and change with age of FTSECs is yet not 
fully understood. While 3D microscopy has made great strides in mapping of soft organs such as the brain and lungs, tissue 
clearing techniques are not easily applied to study of STIC development in the large (cm3), fibrous structure of human fallopian 
tubes. Recent advances in 2D and 3D pathology approaches (including tissue clearing, immunofluorescence, and deep learning 
(DL) applications to standard histological slides) allow micrometer resolution visualization of tissue anatomy. Here, we present 
novel reconstruction of whole human fallopian tubes at single cell resolution and present the utility of this technique for spatial 
mapping of FTSECs. 
Design: Two whole surgically removed human fallopian tube samples were cut to a length of ~3cm, formalin-fixed, paraffin 
embedded, and serially sectioned to a depth of ~3mm, collecting the fimbriated end. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and 
eosin and scanned at high resolution. A 3D rendering software named CODA was used to register the images, and DL was used to 
label at 1-micron resolution the fallopian epithelium (subdividing the epithelium into FTSECs and ciliated epithelial cells), nerves, 
vasculature and stroma. 
Results: Using the CODA workflow, the serially sectioned tissue images transformed into a labelled, registered tissue volume (Fig 
1). In visualizations of the fallopian tube, the distinct regions of the fimbriae and the ampulla are clear (Fig 2). Quantification reveals 
striking cellularity, with expectedly higher cell density in the epithelial layer than in the surrounding stroma (Table 1).

Conclusions: This project represents the first mapping of a whole human fallopian tube. We show feasibility of distinguishing in 
H&E FTSECs from ciliated epithelial cells, important for study of STIC development. By further mapping FTSECs, 3D projects have 
the potential to increase our knowledge of ovarian cancer development. 
 
902    Molar and Nonmolar Hydropic Conceptions with Divergent p57 Expression: A 
Clinicopathologic Study of 29 Cases 
Masaharu Fukunaga, Shin-Yurigaoka General Hospital, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan 
Disclosures: Masaharu Fukunaga: None 
Background: A divergent p57 staining pattern is characterized by two populations of villi; each may have different morphologies 
and different staining patterns of p57. Conception with divergent p57 expression is very rare and always poses clinical and 
diagnostic challenges. 
Design: Twenty-nine cases of molar and nonmolar hydropic conceptions with divergent p57 expression, all of which in the first 
trimester, were retrieved from 1025 cases with hydropic placental tissue, and clinicopathologically analyzed with immunostaining of 
p57 (Kip2) (p57), which is a product of paternally imprinted, maternally expressed genes. 
Results: p57 divergent expression was detected in 13 cases twin gestation comprised of a p57-negative complete mole (CM) and 
p57-positive nonmolar villi and in six cases of early stage placental mesenchymal dysplasia (PMD) and in five cases of CM with 
PMD, in which p57 positive cytotrophoblasts and p57 negative villous stromal cells were observed (Fig 1 and 2). PMD villi were 
histologically characterized by the presence of normal villi and enlarged villi, stromal cell hyperplasia and the absence of 
trophoblastic hyperplasia. Remaining five cases were nonmolar hydropic conceptions with normal villi and enlarged villi with focal 
trophoblastic hyperplasia showing focal p57 positive cytotrophoblasts and p57 positive/negative villous stromal cells. Two of 13 
patients with twin with CM and one of 5 patients of CM with PMD had persistent trophoblastic disease and two patients of twin with 
CM developed lung metastasis.

Figure 1 - 902 
 
Figure 2 - 902 
 
Conclusions: This study showed hydropic placenta with divergent p57 expression is a diagnostic challenge for pathologists, and 
that most were associated with CM or PMD. The presence of two distinct populations of villi is a clue to clarifying divergent p57 
expression. A thorough morphological examination with careful interpretation of p57 immunostaining is required to reach a definite 
diagnosis, and the presence or absence of an under-diagnosed early stage CM or PMD should be considered. These conceptions 
may be good candidates for genotyping analysis. Patients with twin with CM and those with CM and PMD components carry a risk 
for persistent trophoblastic disease, and require appropriate treatment and follow-up as with conventional CM patients.

Background: Recent studies have shown that African American (AA) women have a higher prevalence of uterine carcinomas with 
worse prognoses. Current literature proves that uterine carcinoma in AA patients differ from non-AA on socioeconomic factors and 
histologic grade and features, but genomic studies have been limited. In this study, we analyze the molecular profile of our cohort 
of uterine cancer patients and compare the results with published data. 
Design: A preliminary cohort of 135 patients with uterine cancer were analyzed, 96 of which were AA and 49 were non-AA. 66 
patients have type 1 cancers including 54 low grade endometrioid carcinomas (LGEC) and 12 high grade endometrioid carcinomas 
(HGEC). The remaining 69 patients have type 2 cancers including 40 serous carcinomas (SC), 7 clear cell carcinomas (CCC) and 
22 carcinosarcomas (MMMT). Next-generation sequencing comprehensive tumor profiling by Caris Molecular Intelligence (MI) was 
performed on representative sections of the paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed tumors. The data were analyzed to assess the tumor 
genetic differences between the AA and non-AA patients. 
Results: The AA patients, who made up the bulk of the cohort, were found to have more type 2 than type 1 cancers (54 vs 42/135). 
Non-AA patients were more often diagnosed with type 1 than type 2 cancers (24 vs 14/135)(figure 1). 47.4% of non-AA patients 
were diagnosed at <60 years of age, compared to 30.9% of AA patients. 93 total pathogenic mutations were identified across all 
cancer types. Type 1 cancers harbored more mutations in PTEN (58/66), PIK3CA (40/66), ARID1A (36/66), CTNNB1 (29/66), 
PIK3R1 (19/66), and RNF43 (15/66)(table 1). AA patients exhibited a greater frequency of ARID1A (35/66) and PIK3CA (27/66) 
mutations. Almost all of the type 2 carcinomas had TP53 mutations (63/69). Another mutation associated with higher grade tumors 
was FBXW7 (18/135), which was more frequent in type 2 cancers (11/69) than in type 1 cancers (7/66).

Figure 1 - 903 
 
Conclusions: Endometrial cancers in AA patients are diagnosed at an older age as compared to non-AA. Their molecular profile 
show more frequent targetable mutations like ARID1A, FBXW7, PIK3CA and PIK3R1 across all cancer types, suggesting a role for 
a multi-faceted approach to immunotherapy. Alterations in CTNNB1 in LGEC of AA patients are a poor prognostic indicator. Further 
studies investigating genomic disparities between endometrial cancers of AA and non-AA patients are needed to improve and tailor 
clinical management strategies for AA patients.

904    Aberrant p53 Staining is Seen Only in a Minority of FIGO Grade 2 Endometrioid Carcinomas 
but Correlates with Adverse Clinical Outcomes

Disclosures: Georgi Galev: None; Amy Joehlin-Price: None; Brian Rubin: None; Kepeng Che: None; Michelle Kuznicki: None;

Background: Endometrial endometrioid carcinoma (EEC), FIGO grade 2 (G2), is a heterogeneous group of tumors with variable 
clinical outcome. Binary classification of EEC into low versus high-grade has been proposed which would eliminate the EEC G2 
category.  The distribution and impact of molecular classification on G2 tumors has not been systematically evaluated. 
Design: After obtaining IRB approval, FIGO grade 2 EEC were identified.  A panel of IHC stains (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6, 
p53, PTEN, PAX8, ER, PR) was performed on TMAs or while sections. POLE mutation analysis was performed by Sanger 
sequencing. 
Results: 157 EECG2 were identified for inclusion. Patients had a median age of 64 (range 22-91) and most presented with low 
stage disease (129 FIGO stage I, 6 II, 19 stage III and 3 stage IV). MMR IHC data was available in 155 patients: 69 were MMR 
deficient 61 with MLH1/PMS2 and 8 with MSH2/MSH6 loss.  Three of 155 tumors showed aberrant p53 (ab-p53). Three EC 
showed MMR loss and clonal ab-p53.  PTEN was frequently lost (117/157 lost, 26/157 retained, 14/157 equivocal) and PAX8 was 
negative in 1 EC (100/141 diffuse, 36/141 patchy, 4/141 focal, 1/141 negative). ER was at least focal in all cases (87/128 diffuse, 
33/128 patchy, 9/128 focal), and 4 were PR negative (86/153 diffuse, 49/153 patchy, 14/153 focal, 4/153 
negative). POLE sequencing data was available for 25 EC (POLE mutation analysis underway in the remaining cases) and no 
pathogenic mutations were identified (2 EC with V360V and P476S each and 1 with P356S). Median follow up time was 63 months 
(range 1-150) and most patients (122/157, 78%) showed no evidence of disease (NED), 5 (3%) were alive with disease (AWD) and 
11 (7%) dead of disease (DOD). The rest were dead of unknown or unrelated causes. Although the numbers are limited, 2 out of 3 
(67%) MMR proficient, p53-aberrant patients recurred and were AWD (n=1) or DOD (n=1) compared to 20/148 (14%) p53 wild-type 
patients with recurrences. Logrank testing of recurrence free survival by p53 and MMR status are shown in Figure 1. Overall 
survival was not significant due to low numbers of deaths from disease.

Conclusions: In our cohort of FIGO grade 2 EEC, almost half of the cases showed MMR deficiency and a small subset (2%) were 
p53-aberrant.  Although the numbers are small, the presence of aberrant p53 staining showed significant correlation with 
recurrence free survival. This data could support the use of universal p53 IHC in EEC G2 to identify potentially aggressive tumors.

905    Comparison of the Conventional and Alternative Method of Measuring Depth of Invasion of 
Vulvar Squamous Cell Carcinoma Using Whole Slide Digital Pathology Images

1University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 
Disclosures: Cynthia Gasper: None; Peyman Samghabadi: None; Nikka Khorsandi: None 
Background: When vulvar squamous cell carcinoma is present at a depth > 1 mm, the tumor is upstaged from FIGO stage IA to 
IB. In the conventional method, depth of invasion is defined as the distance in millimeters from the epithelial-stromal junction of the 
adjacent, most superficial dermal papilla to the deepest point of invasion. An alternative method measures depth from the most 
adjacent dysplastic rete ridge to the deepest point of invasion. Using the alternative method of invasion may downstage a 
significant proportion of patients. 
Design: Patients with a diagnosis of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva were identified. 40 patients with H&E slides 
were reviewed and measurements using the conventional and alternative method were documented using a measuring ocular. Of 
those,19 patients also had whole slide images and measurements were documented using both a measuring ocular and the 
measurement ruler tool on the digital image.  
Results: Depth of invasion changed in 36/40 patients (90%) with the alternative method. The median depth of invasion with the 
conventional method was 3.1 mm (range 0.7-18 mm) and with the alternative method it was 1.8 mm (range 0.5-6.5 mm). 8/40 
patients (20%) were given a new FIGO stage due to change in depth of invasion. For the 19 patients with both H&E and digital 
images, the conventional method with ocular showed a median depth of invasion of 3.5 mm (range 0.4-9 mm) and using the digital 
ruler tool was 3.3 mm (range 0.5-8mm). For the alternative method the median depth of invasion using an ocular was 2.1 mm 
(range 0.3-6.5 mm) and using the digital ruler tool was 2 mm (range 0.3-6.6 mm). 4/19 patients in this group were given a new 
FIGO stage as a result of a change in depth of invasion. When using the conventional method or alternative method and comparing 
the measuring ocular to the digital ruler tool, 0 patients (0%) were given a new FIGO stage.  Follow-up data was available for 19 
patients with a median of 12 months (range 1-168 months). For patients who were down staged using the alternative method from 
FIGO IB to IA 0/6 (0%) recurred while for those who remained FIGO IB using the alternative method 3/19 (16%) recurred. 
Figure 1 - 905 
 
Conclusions: Measuring depth of invasion using an alternative method versus the conventional method will downstage a portion 
of patients with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. Using a measuring ocular versus a digital ruler yields similar results. If the 
alternative method is adopted less patients might be treated with groin surgery.

906    Poorly Differentiated Clusters and Tumor Budding in Uterine Endometrioid Carcinoma are 
Morphological Findings Associated with Decreased Recurrence Free Survival

Disclosures: Mariam Ghafoor: None; Daniel Christensen: None; Allison Goldberg: None; Joanna Chan: None 
Background: Tumor budding (TB), and poorly differentiated clusters (PDCs) are associated with a poor prognostic outcome in 
many carcinomas. However, the association has rarely been investigated in uterine endometrioid carcinoma (UEC). Here, we 
evaluate TB and PDCs in UEC and correlate these findings with morphological features known to be associated with a poor clinical 
outcome and with recurrence free survival (RFS). 
Design: We performed a 5-year retrospective search of our institution’s EMR for cases of hysterectomy for UEC. We collected 
clinical data including disease recurrence and death as well as data associated with patient outcomes including lymphovascular 
invasion (LVI), lymph node status (LNS), depth of invasion (DI), FIGO grade, and surgical stage. Cases were evaluated for TB and 
PDCs by two pathologists.  TB was defined as the presence of isolated single clusters of up to 4 cells at the invasive front and was 
graded as present or absent. PDCs were defined as solid nests of ≥5 cells at invasive front region. Ten 20x fields were examined. 
Of those 10 fields, the one with the most PDCs was graded as follows: grade 1=0 to 4 PDCs; grade 2= ≥5 PDCs. (Figure 1). 
Categorical data were evaluated using chi-squared tests; LogRank test was performed on the Kaplan Meier curves to evaluate 
RFS. P value was set at 0.05. 
Results: 113 cases were evaluated. Presence of TB was associated with LVI (68% vs 41%, p=0.01), positive LNS (36% vs 5%, 
p<0.001), DI >50% (65% vs 24%, p<0.001), higher FIGO grade (p<0.001) and worse stage (p<0.001). Grade 2 PDCs was 
associated with LVI (87% vs 23%, p<0.001), positive LNS (42% vs 9%, p<0.001), DI >50% (69% vs 29%, p<0.001), higher FIGO 
grade (p<0.001) and worse stage (p<0.001) (Table 1). Kaplan Meier curves show decreased RFS for patients with TB present 
(p=0.03) and grade 2 PDCs (p=0.01) (Figure 2).

Conclusions: We show a statistically significant association between TB presence and >5 PDCs and decreased RFS in UEC. We 
also show an association between TB presence and >5 PDCs and known poor prognostic factors such as LVI, positive LNS, 
increased DI, higher FIGO grade, and worse stage at presentation. We conclude that TB and PDCs are strong independent 
prognostic indicators in UEC and provide additional value to the currently used morphological assessment of UEC. 
 
907    Evaluation of Intratumoral HER2 Heterogeneity in Endometrial Serous Carcinoma and 
Carcinosarcoma 
Manisha Goel1, Jennifer Bennett2 
1University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, 2University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 
Disclosures: Manisha Goel: None; Jennifer Bennett: None 
Background: HER2 overexpression and/or amplification has been reported in 25-30% of endometrial serous carcinomas (ESC) 
and 15% of endometrial carcinosarcomas (ECS). Although intratumoral HER2 heterogeneity is well-recognized, it is unclear 
whether multiple tumor sections should be evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to avoid missing a HER2-overexpressed 
subclone. 
 
  
 
S912 
Design: Institutional archives were searched for all ESC and ECS diagnosed on hysterectomy within a 1-year period. HER2 IHC 
was performed on all tumor blocks and scored from 0 to 3+ based on the Fader et al recommendations. HER2 FISH results were 
documented if available. 
Results: The study cohort included 15 tumors (10 ESC, 5 ECS). Patients ranged from 55 to 79 (median 66) years and tumors from 
0.3 to 8.5 (median 4.2) cm. Recurrences occurred in 6 patients (median 8.4 months) and at last follow-up (median 23 months), 11 
were alive and well, 2 were dead of disease, and 2 were alive with disease. Heterogeneous HER2 expression was identified in 9 
(60%) tumors with a two-degree difference observed in 2. Among all tumors evaluated, no recurrent morphological features 
(architecture, degree of atypia, cytoplasmic features) were predictive of HER2 expression. However, occasionally within an 
individual tumor, specific appearances did show distinct HER2 scores. In one tumor, the solid component was consistently 1+, the 
corded areas 2+, and glands/papillae 3+. Another tumor showed decreased HER2 expression (0-1+) in the deeply invasive 
component, while the superficial areas were 3+. All ECS showed a lower HER2 score in the sarcoma compared to the carcinoma. 
For cases where HER2 was performed on a single slide during the original diagnostic work-up (n=12), heterogeneity was noted in 3 
(25%) tumors (all ESC). All 3 received a score of 1+ and FISH was not performed. However, staining of additional slides yielded 
scores of 2+ and 3+. HER2 FISH is pending in these 3 tumors. 
Figure 1 - 907 
 
Conclusions: Intratumoral HER2 heterogeneity is frequent in ESC and ECS, which in a subset of patients may result in 
therapeutic implications if only 1 slide is evaluated. While it is not feasible to stain every tumor section for HER2, the results of this 
study suggest additional evaluation of 1-2 slides in the setting of a score of 0-1+ or not amplified 2+, has the potential to alter 
management. Furthermore, as clinical trials evaluating novel agents in patients with HER2 1+ and not amplified 2+ tumors are 
currently accruing, precise assessment of the HER2 score is crucial.

Background: Since The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) established four molecular subclasses for endometrial carcinoma (EC), 
there has been increasing interest in determining the molecular subtype in the context of the histologic subtype. ECs with 
undifferentiated, spindled and/or sarcomatous components represent a diagnostically challenging subset of uterine tumors with 
overlapping clinical and histologic features. The prognostic differences among this group of aggressive ECs are not well 
established. We examined the morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of these tumors. 
Design: High-grade ECs were identified in our institution’s pathology database. Patient age, BMI, histologic diagnosis, tumor size, 
stage, and lymph node status were recorded, and immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins, p53, β-catenin, estrogen 
receptor, and progesterone receptor was performed. We analyzed morphologic features, including nuclear grade, tumor 
heterogeneity, and presence of heterologous differentiation. TCGA subgroups were assigned when possible. Overall survival (OS) 
and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and log rank test. 
Results: The key clinicopathologic features are summarized in Table 1. The tumors occurred in adult women (median 67 years) 
and included carcinosarcomas (UCS) (n=75), de-differentiated (n=22), and undifferentiated (n=18) carcinomas, endometrioid 
carcinomas with spindled growth (n=16) and other high-grade ECs (n=4). All showed similar clinical characteristics. OS and PFS 
plots by histotype showed no difference in OS (p=0.664) or PFS (p=0.708) (Figure 1, a,b). However, prognostic differences in both 
OS (p=0.011) and PFS (p=0.0005) were seen when divided by TCGA subgroup (Figure 1, c,d). There was no difference in OS or 
PFS between UCS with heterologous or homologous differentiation. We also enriched for p53 wild type UCS (n=17), which showed 
a difference in PFS (p= 0.043) compared to p53 aberrant UCS (Figure 2); there was no difference in OS (p= 0.378).

Conclusions: There was no prognostic difference when stratified by histotype among UCS, dedifferentiated/undifferentiated 
carcinomas, and grade 3 endometrioid carcinomas with spindled growth. However, TCGA molecular subgroups showed prognostic 
differences similar to that seen in wider studies of EC.   
 
909    Concordant Glandular PTEN and Progesterone Receptor Down-Regulation or Loss is a

Disclosures: Elham Hatami: None; Omonigho Aisagbonhi: None 
Background: Loss of PTEN immunoreactivity is recommended by the WHO as a diagnostic adjunct for atypical endometrial 
hyperplasia despite a 2019 meta-analysis that showed low diagnostic usefulness of PTEN in differentiating benign from pre-
malignant endometrial hyperplasia. The reported low diagnostic usefulness of PTEN may be because PTEN loss/down-regulation 
physiologically occurs in the mid-to-late secretory phase of the normal menstrual cycle and can confound interpretation of PTEN 
immunohistochemical stain.  
 
  
 
S915 
Design: Following approval by our Institutional Review Board, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from endometrial 
biopsies diagnosed as secretory endometrium or atypical hyperplasia with secretory change or in a secretory background were 
chosen and re-reviewed and further classification was performed as early secretory endometrium, day 17-18 endometrium, mid-to-
late secretory endometrium or atypical hyperplasia with secretory change. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for PTEN 
and Progesterone Receptor. PTEN immunohistochemistry was interpreted according to the following patterns as recently described 
by Wang et al:  1. Retained: moderate glandular cytoplasmic expression 2. Reduced: weak glandular cytoplasmic expression 3. 
Loss: completely absent staining in glands with positive staining in stromal cells as internal control. 
Results: We evaluated the IHC expression pattern of PTEN and progesterone receptor in secretory endometrium: early (9 cases), 
day 17-18 (4 cases) mid-to-late (11 cases) and atypical hyperplasia with secretory change (6 cases). PTEN and PR expression 
patterns were generally concordant in normal endometrial glands, with retained cytoplasmic PTEN and positive nuclear PR in early 
secretory phase, and reduced to absent PTEN and PR in mid-to-late secretory phase.  A discordant glandular PTEN and PR 
pattern – PTEN reduction/loss but moderate to strong PR – was observed within the atypical foci in all the cases of atypical 
hyperplasia. 
Conclusions: In summary, in evaluating secretory endometrium and atypical hyperplasia with secretory change, our study shows 
that concordant PTEN and PR expression pattern is physiologic and can be reassuring in rendering a diagnosis of benign secretory 
endometrium, whereas, discordant PTEN and PR is more nuanced; though observed in all our cases of atypical hyperplasia, 
isolated benign glands also sporadically showed the discordant pattern.  
 
910    Digital Spatial Profiling of Adenomyosis: A Proof of Concept Examination of Differentially 
Expressed Genes in Immune Cells and Epithelial Cells

Disclosures: Tahyna Hernandez: None; Ie-Ming Shih: None 
Background: Adenomyosis affects a significant number of women and is defined by presence of ectopic endometrial tissue within 
the myometrium that causes abnormal uterine bleeding, dysmenorrhea and subfertility and often co-occurs with endometriosis. The 
role of immune cells in adenomyosis is unclear. Digital spacial expression profiling is a powerful method of quantifying gene 
expression patterns in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue across specific areas of interest. The objective of this study was to 
characterize the expression profile of immune-related genes and genes pertaining to common cancer signaling pathways in 
adenomyosis lesions compared to matched eutopic endometrium. 
Design: Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded archival tissues were retrieved from 21 patients undergoing hysterectomy for 
abnormal uterine bleeding.  The sample size consisted of 22 adenomyosis lesions and 32 eutopic endometrial samples. Areas of 
interest were selected for analyzing 77 protein markers.  The NanoString GeoMx ™ Digital Spatial Profiling platform was used to 
profile the protein expressions in different spatial locations. We analyzed epithelial cells (Pan-Ck+) and associated immune cells 
(CD45+) surrounding the endometrial glands, separately.  Housekeeping targets or IgG negative controls were used for 
normalization to account for sample variability and targets not detected above background noise were filtered out from downstream 
analysis. 
Results: Ten markers were upregulated in immune cells in adenomyosis compared to eutopic endometrium (p<0.05).  OX40L, a 
ligand that is present on many antigen-presenting cells such macrophages, and activated B lymphocytes, was increased 2.3-
fold. The Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related (GITR) protein found on T cells, natural killer cells and some myeloid cells was 
increased 2-fold. CD66b was increased 2.3-fold. We did not observe any statistically significant difference in expression profiles of 
epithelial cells between adenomyosis and eutopic endometrium.

Figure 1 - 910 
 
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that immune cells in adenomyosis lesions have distinct immune profiles compared to 
eutopic endometrium, and suggest that the immune microenvironment may contribute to the pathogenesis of adenomyosis. CD66b, 
GITR, and OX40L, have not been previously described in adenomyosis and further spacial characterization of genes around 
regions of higher expression could offer potential novel immune-based interventions.  
 
911    Immunohistochemical Biomarker Evaluation of Thyroid Proliferations and Neoplasms Arising 
in Ovarian Teratomas

Disclosures: Anjelica Hodgson: None; Ozgur Mete: None 
Background: Immunohistochemical biomarkers are not infrequently employed in the evaluation of native thyroid lesions when 
there is a morphological concern for a subtle malignant process.  The finding of thyroid tissue in ovarian teratomas is not 
uncommon and definite classification and determination of malignancy is known to be, at times, notoriously difficult.  In this study, 
we sought to retrospectively assess the performance of immunohistochemical biomarkers in thyroid proliferations and neoplasms 
arising in ovarian teratomas. 
Design: Our institutional database was searched from the beginning of 2018 until present day, to identify cases of ovarian 
teratomas with thyroid proliferations and neoplasms which had been evaluated with an immunohistochemical biomarker work up 
including CK19, HBME1, galectin-3, CD56, Cyclin D1, p27, BRAF p.V600E-mutation specific VE1 and MIB1.  CK19, HBME1, 
galectin-3 and VE1 were assessed for the presence of expression while CD56, cyclin D1 and p27 were assessed based on the 
amount of expression (decreased/loss or increased amount), depending on the marker. MIB-1 was assessed in hot spots using a 
digital nuclear counting algorithm. All of the cases were originally reviewed by a pathologist with subspecialist expertise in 
pathology of the thyroid.  Data was taken from the pathology reports. 
Results: A total of 16 cases were identified of which 3 were ultimately assigned a benign diagnosis (reactive atypia or follicular 
nodular disease, cases 1-3) while the remaining 13 were all assigned a malignant diagnosis (differentiated thyroid carcinoma, 
cases 4-16). The profiles of each case are shown in the Table.  Proliferations ultimately classified as benign showed positivity for 
CK19 in 2/3 cases but otherwise showed no concerning immunohistochemical expression patterns.  Cases with a malignant 
diagnosis, however, showed abnormal expression patterns of multiple markers simultaneously.  In particular, CK19 was always 
positive while CD56 and p27 always showed abnormal reduced or loss of expression (in cases which were assessed).

Conclusions: In this study, we have shown that immunohistochemical biomarkers used in workup of native thyroid lesions can be 
applied to thyroid proliferations and neoplasms in ovarian teratomas, and that their expression patterns differ among lesions 
classified as benign vs. malignant (differentiated thyroid carcinoma).

912    EPM2AIP1 Immunohistochemistry is Not a Sensitive Surrogate for MLH1 Promoter 
Methylation in Endometrial Carcinoma

Disclosures: Robert Humble: None; Andrew Bellizzi: None; Jacob Kaplan: None 
Background: Mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) endometrial carcinoma (EC) is a distinct molecular subtype in the 5th Edition of the 
WHO Classification of Female Genital Tumors. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMR proteins (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6) is 
essential in identifying these tumors in addition to screening for Lynch syndrome. Most sporadic MLH1/PMS2-deficient ECs 
demonstrate MLH1 promoter methylation (PM), which suggests a tumor is not associated with Lynch syndrome. Recently 
EPM2AIP1 IHC has been proposed as a surrogate for MLH1 PM in EC (PMID: 34772843). 
Design: MLH1 (clone ES05), PMS2 (clone EP51), MSH2 (clone FE11), MSH6 (clone EP49) and EPM2AIP1 (clone OTI2G3) IHC 
was performed on tissue microarrays (TMAs) constructed from consecutive EC resections (n=322) taking place between 
September 2019 and June 2021. Charts were reviewed for results of clinically performed MMR IHC and send out MLH1 PM testing 
(ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT) by real time PCR with methylation levels >=10% reported as positive. EPM2AIP1 IHC was 
assessed as intact, lost, or lost with cytoplasmic staining. EPM2AIP1 IHC was correlated with MMR IHC and MLH1 PM status. 
Results: MMR results were interpretable in 319 cases (99.1%), 22% of which were MLH1-deficient (n=71). 80.3% of MLH1-
deficient ECs received MLH1 PM testing (n=57); just two of the tested cases were negative for methylation (3.5%). Loss of nuclear 
EPM2AIP1 expression with or without cytoplasmic staining was seen in 58% (n=32) of MLH1-deficient methylated ECs. In ECs with 
other patterns of MMRd (n=15), 13.3% demonstrated loss of nuclear EPM2AIP1 expression without cytoplasmic staining (n=2). 
Among MMR intact ECs (n=233), 5.2% of cases demonstrated loss of nuclear EPM2AIP1 expression with or without cytoplasmic 
staining (n=12); Among MLH1-deficient ECs, EMP2AIP1 loss was 58.2% sensitive (and 100% specific) for MLH1 PM (though only 
two MLH1-deficient ECs were not methylated in the cohort). Detailed data are presented in the Table below.

Conclusions: In our study, EPM2AIP1 IHC as a surrogate for MLH1 PM was less sensitive than in a previous studies (58.2% vs 
94.5%). Additionally, loss of EPM2AIP1 was not specific to MLH1-deficient ECs with PM (ie, loss was occasionally seen with other 
patterns of MMRd and rarely in ECs with intact MMR). This diagnostic adjunct should be carefully optimized and validated before 
being placed into clinical service as a surrogate for MLH1 PM.

Background: Neuroendocrine markers are used in clinical practice to confirm the diagnosis of neuroendocrine neoplasm when the 
morphology shows “typical” features, or to demonstrate neuroendocrine differentiation in a poorly differentiated neoplasm. 
Neuroendocrine tumors in gynecological tract are rare, however, many carcinomas express neuroendocrine markers. Our aim was 
to assess the frequency of neuroendocrine marker expression in a large series of molecularly subtyped endometrial carcinomas 
and evaluate their diagnostic and prognostic significance.  
Design: Tumor tissue from1221 ECs identified across 29 centers and arranged on TMAs were immunohistochemically stained for 
chromogranin and synaptophysin. The staining was successful in 1051 and 1055 cases respectively and were scored using h-
score and grouped into three groups: ≤10%, >10 – 50% and >50%. Over >10% staining was considered positive.  
Results: Synaptophysin and chromogranin staining results and association with pathological features is presented in table 1. Only 
one tumor (a p53abn carcinosarcoma) showed positivity for both markers. Chromogranin positivity was more common, and most 
frequently seen in low-grade endometrioid tumors of NSMP subtype, whereas synaptophysin positive tumors were most often high-
grade p53abn tumors. Chromogranin positivity was associated with better disease specific survival and synaptophysin with adverse 
survival across the whole cohort (figure 1), but not within the molecular subtypes, indicating that this association is due to 
correlation with clinicopathological factors.

Conclusions: Neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and chromogranin show strikingly different and virtually non-overlapping 
expression profiles in endometrial carcinomas, with variable positivity. Chromogranin positivity was associated with low-grade 
NSMP tumors whereas synaptophysin was associated with high-grade histology and p53abn subtype. In conclusion, 
neuroendocrine markers do not add to the prognostic assessment of endometrial carcinomas and positivity for these markers 
without a neuroendocrine histology should not warrant the diagnosis of neuroendocrine carcinoma.

914    Placental Pathology in the Setting of Maternal Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy

1Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, 2Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 
Disclosures: Anh Huynh: None; Lauren Ray: None; Drucilla Roberts: None; Jaclyn Watkins: None 
Background: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is characterized by the onset of pruritus and elevated serum bile acid 
levels in the second or third trimester. In the United States, ICP affects up to 5.6% of all pregnancies. While ICP poses little risk to 
maternal health, it has been associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, including intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD), respiratory 
distress syndrome, and preterm delivery, due to the accumulation of bile acids in the placenta and amniotic fluid. However, there is 
limited knowledge of associated histopathologic features in the placentas of ICP patients, particularly in those with poor fetal 
outcomes. 
Design: All placentas (from 2017-2021) from patients with a history of ICP were retrieved from the archives of the Massachusetts 
General Hospital. All H&E slides were reviewed with a particular focus on features of fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM) and 
possible bile pigment deposition. Clinical and laboratory data, including maternal serum bile acid levels, were obtained from the 
electronic medical record. 
Results: 45 placentas (including 3 twins and one IUFD) were identified and reviewed. In 31 (69%, including the IUFD), pigment 
most compatible with bilirubin was found within macrophages of at least one intravillous vascular space or loose within the villous 
stroma. Two of these cases were notable for extensive bilirubin-laden macrophages (iron stain largely negative) within the vascular 
spaces of the terminal and stem villi (Figure 1).  In 11 cases (24%), at least one feature of FVM was identified. Interestingly, 
developmental concerns were noted in childhood in 31% of cases. Average bile acid levels were calculated for the entire cohort, 
cases with identifiable pigment, and cases with childhood developmental concerns, averaging 30.5, 27.3, and 28.6 µmol/L, 
respectively. 
Figure 1 - 914 
 
Conclusions: Our results suggest distinct histomorphologic features of ICP including loose pigment deposition and/or bilirubin-
laden macrophages in the villous vascular space as well as possible associated FVM. As these findings may be subtle and focal, 
additional stains, such as a Hall stain, may be useful for further characterization and quantification of these pigments. Future steps 
include cohort expansion, Hall stain in all cases, and correlation between histologic findings, maternal serum bile, and outcomes.

Background: Ever since the seminal Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) paper on genomic profiling of endometrial carcinoma (EC) 
came out, there has been increasing integration of morphology and molecular characteristics to stratify EC, predict prognosis and 
guide treatment. However, there is disparity on practice trend and molecular resource utilization even among gynecologic 
pathologists. This prompted us to conduct a multi-institutional survey to understand the global practice patterns of gynecologic 
pathologists and to evaluate the frequency of adoption of genomic profiling as well as recently recommended changes in 
morphologic assessments. 
Design: A survey questionnaire was shared among 75 gynecologic pathologists using Survey Monkey software. Deidentified and 
anonymized respondent data was analysed (Figure 1). 
Results: 56 of 75 participants completed the survey (75%). Morphologic assessment of EC: Most respondents routinely report 
lymphovascular invasion as focal or extensive (69%) and use a binary grading (low grade and high grade) for endometrioid subtype 
(51%). Only a minority always report exact percentages in mixed carcinoma or carcinosarcoma (42%), or a MELF pattern of 
invasion (25%). Intraoperative Assessment: Over 70% participants agreed that intraoperative assessment of depth of myometrial 
invasion is at least somewhat reliable. Ultrastaging for sentinel lymph nodes: 31% respondents always evaluate sentinel lymph 
nodes using ultrastaging. Molecular classification: About half (51%) are not performing complete molecular characterization of EC; 
combination of MMR and p53 IHC are done by 51% vs combined MMR, p53 and POLE testing by 24%. Low grade EC do not 
undergo POLE testing by majority (60%). Biomarker Studies: Universal MMR testing for ECs is done by just over half (54%) 
respondents, HER2 testing is performed by 49% for endometrial serous carcinoma and for all TP53 mutated tumors by additional 
7%. Most respondents do not get requests for TMB, HRD or PD-L1 testing for ECs from their oncologists. The differences in 
practice patterns amongst pathologists in Asia vs. North America/ Europe are summarized in Table 1.

Conclusions: Despite clinically validated molecular algorithms, there is absence of well formulated testing guidelines for EC. The 
responses to survey represent a wide variation that is present in the practice patterns amongst gynecologic pathologists for EC and 
most of it is clinician-driven. Some variations are also regional and based on availability of resources.

916    H3K27 Trimethylation in Malignant and Benign Smooth Muscle Tumors of the Uterus: A 
Clinicopathologic and Immunohistochemical Study of 106 Cases

Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 
Disclosures: Terri Jones: None; Rohit Bhargava: None; Mirka Jones: None 
Background: The trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is an epigenetic regulation in normal and neoplastic tissue 
leading to decreased expression of downstream genes.  In some neoplasms, decreased expression of H3K27me3 by IHC has 
been associated with poorer survival and with decreased response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. To our knowledge, 
expression of H3K27me3 has not been investigated in uterine smooth muscle tumors (uSMTs).  
Design: Representative sections of 60 leiomyosarcomas (LMS), 11 smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential 
(STUMPs), 13 leiomyomas with bizarre nuclei (LBN), and 22 usual leiomyomas underwent immunostaining with H3K27me3. 
Expression was calculated and reported as a tiered H-score (low: 1-99; intermediate: 100-199; high: 200-300) and correlated with 
clinicopathologic features.  
Results: Most LMS (40/60; 67%) showed low or absent reactivity for H3K27me3, with 48% showing complete loss of staining. The 
average H-score for LMS was 60 (range: 0-240). H3K27me3 expression in STUMPs was low for all positive cases (8/11; 73%) with 
an average H-score of 17 (range: 0-50). In cases of LBN, most cases were positive (10/13; 77%), with mostly low expression (7/10; 
70%) and an average H-score of 37 (range: 0-180). Only 3/22 (14%) LMs were focally and weakly positive for H3K27me3 with an 
average H-score of <1 (range: 0-10). There did not appear to be correlations between survival, recurrence, tumor stage, tumor 
characteristics and expression of H3K27me3.  
Conclusions: Complete loss of H3K27me3 expression was seen in a minority of LMS, STUMPs, and LBN (48%, 27%, and 23%, 
respectively). Most LMS and LBN showed low to intermediate H3K27me3 expression (87% and 100%, respectively), whereas all 
STUMPs with expression showed only low reactivity. Of the uSMTs subtypes in our cohort, only LMS cases showed high 
H3K27me3 reactivity. In a case where a diagnosis of LMS is challenging histologically, the presence of high H3K27me3 expression 
could be useful. Most (86%) of leiomyomas demonstrated complete loss of H3K27me3 expression as compared to the other uSMT 
subtypes. This suggests that H3K27me3 may play a role in tumorigenesis of this benign neoplasm and that LMs may have distinct 
epigenetic regulation compared with other uSMTs.

Background: Serous endometrial carcinomas have a poor prognosis, with the majority of them having extrauterine metastases at 
presentation. Recent advances in molecular drivers of serous carcinomas have led to the use of targeted therapeutics such as the 
anti-HER2 therapy, trastuzumab, which when added with conventional chemotherapy is associated with improved survival. With the 
recent FDA approval of antibody drug conjugates (ADC) targeting HER2 in breast cancer, new targeted therapies exist for patients 
with HER2-low status disease (defined as IHC score 1+ or 2+ with negative FISH). As such, we sought to further elucidate HER2 
categories in patients with high-grade serous endometrial carcinomas (HGSEC) to determine what proportion of patients might be 
eligible if treatment options for HER2-low become available for HGSEC.   
Design: The pathology database at our institution was queried for cases of endometrial carcinomas where HER2 IHC was 
performed between 2013-2022. H&E and HER2-stained slides of endometrial biopsies and resection specimens were retrieved and 
evaluated. HER2 IHC was scored using the Fader et al Clinical Trial criteria for (HGSEC) and the ASCO/CAP 2018 breast criteria.   
Results: 42 cases of HGSEC were identified; 9 biopsies (21%) and 33 resections (79%). The cohort was composed of 34 pure 
HGSEC (81%) and 8 carcinosarcomas with a HGSEC component (19%) (Table 1). By the Fader et al Clinical Trial criteria, the 
HER2 IHC score distribution was: score 0 (8 cases, 19%), 1+ (12 cases, 29%), 2+ (13 cases, 31%), and 3+ (9 cases, 21%). 5 
cases (12%) were discrepant between the Fader et al Clinical Trial and ASCO/CAP 2018 cutoffs for HER2 positive tumors with 25 
cases (60%) and 27 cases (64%) falling into the category of HER2-low tumors, respectively. HER2 FISH was performed in 17 
cases where the IHC was equivocal; 2 cases (5%) were HER2-amplified and 15 cases (36%) were negative for HER2 
amplification.

Conclusions: A majority of (HGSEC) at our institution (60%) would be classified as HER2-low by the Fader et al criteria. Currently 
at our institution, HER2 testing is performed when requested by the oncology team. With the approval of an ADC for treatment of 
HER2-low breast cancer, the routine identification of HER2-low (HGSEC) may be important as to recruit candidates for targeted 
therapy in combination with conventional chemotherapy. As the cutoff for positive HER2 is higher in the Fader et al criteria versus 
breast, a greater number of patients would potentially qualify.

Background: It has been reported that PIK3CA mutations are present in cervical cancers with the prevalence varying from 13% to 
36%, suggesting their important role in cervical cancer development and progression. While several studies have investigated the 
impact of PIK3CA on tumor characteristics and patient survival of cervical cancer patients, there is no convincing data on the 
clinical utility of this biomarker in these patients. In a recent meta-analysis which comprised of 12 articles and 2,196 women with 
cervical cancer, the study concluded that current evidence concerning the impact of PIK3CA mutations on survival outcomes of 
patients with cervical cancer is inconclusive. 
Design: To explore the role of PIK3CA in the development and prognosis of HPV-related cervical squamous cell carcinoma with 
minimal confounding factors, we planned to investigate the prevalence of PIK3CA hotspot mutations in these cancers at our 
institution. We collected 182 genomic DNA samples from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors which were 
pathologically confirmed as cervical squamous cell carcinoma. We performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based Sanger 
sequencing to assess exons 9 and 20 hotspot mutations in the PIK3CA gene. The patients’ age, clinical presentations, procedures, 
and specimen gross descriptions including tumor site and size were also retrieved and reviewed. 
Results: Sequencing of the purified PCR products detected exon 9 PIK3CA mutations in 22 (16%) of 138 tested samples, 
including 17 cases with E545K mutation, 4 with E542K, and 1 with T544I. No somatic mutations were detected in exon 20 which 
harbors H1047R hotspot mutation. The patients with the mutations ranged in age from 27 to 79 years-old (mean, 54 years; median, 
55 years). In the hysterectomy (10 cases) and conization (1 case) specimens, the tumors ranged in size from 0.4 to 8.5 cm (mean, 
3.1 cm; median, 2.3 cm). Distant metastasis was present in 6 cases. Follow-up information was available in 20 cases 
with PIK3CA mutation, of which, 10 patients died (median follow-up, 29 months) and 10 patients were still alive at the time of study 
(median follow-up, 25 months). 
Conclusions: Our study further demonstrates frequent activation of PIK3CA pathway in the oncogenesis of cervical squamous cell 
carcinoma, indicating a therapeutic potential by directly targeting PI3K. The impact of PIK3CA mutation on survival outcomes of 
patients with cervical cancer in our institution is under investigation.

Background: World Health Organization (WHO) classification 2020 divides endocervical adenocarcinomas (ECAs) into two major 
categories, i.e., human papilloma virus (HPV)–associated and HPV-independent primarily based on morphology. However, in case 
of biopsy limited sampling can be challenging, and thus necessitates application of the algorithmic approach employing ancillary 
studies as proposed by the international group in 2018 (Stolnicu et al.). Aim of this study was: 1) demonstration of the real-world 
practice in Japan; and 2) validation of WHO2020 definition and criteria and utility of ancillary studies for biopsy diagnosis of ECAs. 
Design: We retrieved a total of 217 cases of ECAs (patient age: 47.9±0.8) diagnosed according to WHO 4th (2014) and 5th (2020), 
with slides of both biopsy and resection specimens available (17 conizations and 200 hysterectomies) in 6 academic institutions in 
Japan between 2014 and 2021. The diagnoses according to WHO 4th were converted to the corresponding diagnostic categories in 
the WHO 5th for analysis. Concordance rate between the biopsy diagnosis and the resection specimen diagnosis was 
calculated. Cases with discordant diagnosis (discordant cases) were critically reviewed, and HPV in situ hybridization (ISH) and 
p16, ER, and GATA3 immunohistochemistry were performed on biopsy samples. 
Results: Biopsy diagnosis matched the resected specimen diagnosis in 197 cases (concordance rate of 91%; kappa=0.75). The 
concordance for HPV-associated ECAs was significantly higher, compared with HPV-independent carcinoma (95% vs 81%, p value 
=0.001, Table). Ancillary studies for algorithmic approach proposed by Stolnicu et al. was applied to a total of 19 discordant cases 
with unstained sections available. All 19 cases could be correctly re-categorized as HPV-associated or HPV-independent using 
HPV ISH. On the other hand, p16 immunohistochemistry was positive in 3 of 9 HPV ISH-negative cases with intracytoplasmic 
mucin. Further subclassification of HPV-associated (mucinous and usual-type) and HPV-independent (gastric, clear cell, and 
endometrioid-type) ECAs was failed in 3 of 19 cases (16%) (Fig.), presumably due to: limited tissue sampling, marked intratumoral 
heterogeneity, or absence of appropriate clinical information provided by clinicians.

Conclusions: Most of the ECAs can be correctly diagnosed by the morphology-based WHO 5th criteria in cases of small biopsy, 
although a subset of challenging cases need HPV-ISH as a substitute for conforming association with HPV.

Background: Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes carry independent prognostic significance in endometrial carcinoma (EC) and have 
potential in predicting immunotherapy benefit. However, clinical implementation is hampered by the lack of a simple, reproducible 
scoring method. Here, we developed a pattern-based immune scoring method and studied its reproducibility, correlation with 
molecular EC classes and clinical outcome. 
Design: In total, 245 (histologically defined) high-risk EC from a prospective clinical cohort were included. DNA-sequencing and 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to molecularly classify EC in POLE-ultramutated (POLEmut), mismatch repair 
deficient (MMRd), no specific molecular profile (NSMP) and p53-abnormal (p53abn) EC. Whole slides were stained for hematoxylin 
and eosin (H&E) and CD8 IHC and scored according to a predefined immune scoring method; no/few CD8+ T cells (desert), CD8+ 
T cells present but excluded from the tumor epithelium (excluded-inflamed) or CD8+ T cells included in the epithelium (included-
inflamed) (Figure 1). Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used for analysis of recurrence-free survival (RFS). For 60 
randomly selected cases reproducibility of the method was tested by 3 gynaecopathologists. Agreement was calculated by Fleiss' 
kappa. 
Results: Overall, 112 EC (46%) were assigned desert, 55 (22%) excluded-inflamed and 78 (32%) included-inflamed. The included-
inflamed pattern was significantly more prevalent in POLEmut and MMRd EC compared to NSMP and p53abn EC, 55% versus 
20% (p <0.001), respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, the excluded-inflamed pattern was predominantly (29%) found in MMRd EC. 
The 10-year RFS of included-inflamed EC was 80% versus 51% for excluded-inflamed and 55% for desert EC (p <0.01, Figure 2). 
Across molecular EC classes, a significant survival benefit for the included-inflamed pattern was observed in NSMP EC (p <0.001), 
and a similar non-significant trend in MMRd and p53abn EC. The Fleiss’ kappa was 0.68 for the 3-tiered immune scoring method, 
which improved when using a 2-tiered immune scoring method; 0.79 when tiered to desert versus inflamed, and 0.83 when tiered 
to included-inflamed versus others.

Conclusions: Using a practical and good reproducible immune scoring method, we show that the included-inflamed pattern is 
associated with hypermutant molecular EC classes and improved RFS. Our novel approach is readily implementable in routine 
clinical use, and may be a helpful tool to inform therapeutic strategies in EC. 
 
921    High Tumor Mutational Burden Predicts Recurrence in Copy Number Low Early Stage 
Endometrial Cancer and is Associated with ARID1A and TP53 Mutations: Practical 
Implications for ARID1A and P53 Immunostaining as a Triage Tool

Background: Checkpoint inhibitors are promising treatment options for patients with endometrial cancer (EC) harboring high tumor 
mutational burden (TMB). Copy number low (CN-L) tumors are the most heterogenous group of EC with variable prognosis and 
degree of TMB. Predicting recurrence in CN-L EC, especially in low grade and early stage disease, remains enigmatic and the 
significance of TMB in this group is unknown.  This study employed next generation sequencing (NGS) to assess the prognostic 
significance of TMB in low grade, early stage, CN-L EC and further characterized the clinical and molecular features associated 
with high TMB. 
 
  
 
S928 
Design: The primary tumors of 21 recurrent low grade (grade 1-2), early stage (stage I-II) and CN-L EEC from a single institution 
were retrospectively analyzed using a clinically validated NGS panel that includes 529 cancer-related genes, quantitation of TMB 
and MSI Sensor evaluation. TMB was compared to non-recurrent low grade, low stage, CN-L EEC identified from the TCGA 
database with at least 24 months follow up (n=29). In a second cohort, EC from 263 patients were prospectively analyzed by NGS. 
Patients with CN-L tumors are identified and among them, molecular and clinical features of TMB-high (TMB-H, ≥10 mutations/Mb) 
cases are described in comparison with TMB-low (TMB-L, <10 mutations/Mb). 
Results: TMB was significantly higher in recurrent low grade, early stage, CN-L EC when compared to their non-recurrent 
counterparts (p<0.001, Figure 1). Within the prospective patient cohort, 102 CN-L EC were identified; among those, 23% were 
TMB-H and 77% were TMB-L (Table 1).  The average age was similar (63 vs 58, p>0.05). No significant difference is observed in 
tumor histotype, grade and stage. Lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) was slightly more common in TMB-H (p=0.05). Both 
groups had similar and low MSI Sensor scores (1.5% vs 1%, p>0.05). PTEN mutations were the most common molecular alteration 
in both groups (87% vs 78%, p>0.05). ARID1A, TP53 and PIK3R1 mutation frequency were significantly higher in the TMB-H group 
whereas CTNNB1 mutations were less frequent (p<0.05).

Conclusions: High TMB is present in 23% of CN-L EC, associated with ARID1A and TP53 mutations and recurrence in low grade, 
early stage disease. These results identify ARID1A and p53 immunohistochemistry as potential prognostic markers or triage tools 
for TMB testing via NGS in early stage endometrioid carcinoma. 
 
922    Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) and Tertiary Lymphoid Structures (TLS) as a Predictor 
of Immunotherapy Response in Endometrial Cancer

Public Health, Madison, WI

Background: Response rate to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is highly variable in endometrial cancer (EC) despite relatively 
high PD-1 and PD-L1 expression. Mismatch repair status is currently regarded as a biomarker of response to ICI due to overall 
good response to therapy, however, a subset of the tumors in this group has poor response to ICI therapy. Currently, there are no 
reliable biomarkers to predict ICI response in EC. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) have 
been shown to modulate response to ICI in various malignancies. In this study, we investigate the role of TILs and TLS in predicting 
ICI response among ICI-treated EC. 
Design: Patients with advanced stage or recurrent EC who were treated ICI are included in this study. Clinical data was obtained 
from the medical records including the molecular classification of the tumors. All available diagnostic slides were evaluated for 
presence of TILs, the quantity and maturity of the TLS. Clinical outcomes were investigator-assessed with at least one post-
treatment scan or evidence of clinical progression after treatment initiation. Objective response rate (ORR) was evaluated based on 
best documented response to ICI. Correlation between the presence of TLS and clinical outcomes was assessed using Fischer's 
exact test. 
Results: We identified 10 cases of primary EC treated with Pembrolizumab (Table 1). The histologic types included endometrioid 
(n=4), serous (n=4), clear cell (n=1) and dedifferentiated carcinoma (n=1). ORR (40%, 4/10) in our cohort was associated with the 
presence of TLS (p=0.024) and the presence of both TILs and TLS (p=0.005), but not TILs only. Four of six (66%; 4/6) MSS 
(serous, dedifferentiated, or CCC) had either no TILs and/or TLS, and a lack of response to ICI (3 with progressive disease, 1 with 
stable disease). Two of these six EC (33%; 2/6) had both TILs and TLS, and a partial response to ICI. Of the MMRd endometrioid 
cases, all had TILs; the two of four cases with TILs and TLS showed response (complete or partial) to ICI, while those without TLS 
(2/4) showed lack of response (progressive or stable disease) to ICI.

Conclusions: The presence of TLS alone or with TILs was associated with objective response in our cohort. Our findings suggest

expanded cohort will be reported as part of our poster.

Background: Mutations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer. However, improved 
survival has been observed among these patients, particularly among those with BRCA2 mutations. Our objective is to identify 
differentially regulated pathways that may confer the improved survival. 
Design: RNA sequencing and Pathway Analysis were performed on ovarian tumors from BRCA1 mutant (n=15), BRCA2 mutant 
(n=16) and homologous recombination wild type (HRwt; n= 626) patients. Signaling pathways were validated in vitro and in 
vivo using the isogenic mouse ovarian cancer cell lines ID8 p53-/-, ID8 p53-/-BRCA1-/- and ID8 p53-/- BRCA2-/- . 
Results: The Wnt/ β -catenin pathway was one of the six differentially regulated pathways in BRCA2 patients compared to BRCA1 
and HRP (p=0.004), as determined by meta-analysis of transcriptome data. Eight Wnt inhibitors (NOTUM, SFRP5, RNF43, ZNRF3, 
DKK1, DKK4, NKD1 and AXIN2) were upregulated in patient tumors with BRCA2 mutation. In ID8 p53-/- cells treated in vitro with 
Wnt3A, canonical Wnt target genes (Enpp2, Tcf7, Tcf4, Fgf9, Fst, Klf5, Id2 and Pitx2) were also upregulated. These genes were 
not upregulated in the ID8 p53-/- BRCA1-/- cell line. Instead, Wnt3A treatment led to a significant increase in only Antxr1 in these 
cells. In ID8p53-/-BRCA2-/- cell line, Wnt3A did significantly alter any of tested genes. Immunohistochemistry staining for β-catenin, 
a downstream Wnt target, in untreated intra-peritoneal tumors revealed 15% positivity for cytoplasmic staining in ID8 p53-/- tumors, 
3% positivity for membrane staining with in ID8 p53-/-BRCA1-/- tumors, and 33% positivity for membrane staining in ID8 p53-/-
BRCA2-/-- tumors.  
Conclusions: Our findings indicate that specific loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 show in ovarian cancer cells results in a differential 
response to Wnt signaling, which may be associated with difference in Wnt localization.  This may contribute to the observed 
differences in the clinical outcome.

Background: The last few years have witnessed the description of several “new” uterine sarcoma types, including rare tumors with 
novel gene-rearrangements. Here we analyze DNA methylation profiles in a cohort of uterine mesenchymal neoplasm with novel 
gene-rearrangements, in the context of established tumor types, to study their classification and gain insight into their biology. 
Design: We collected a multicenter cohort including uterine mesenchymal tumors with KAT6B::KANSL1 (n=5) 
and MEIS1::NCOA2 (n=2) gene fusions, as well as GREB1- (n=6) and PLAG1-rearrangements (myxoid leimomysarcoma, 
n=5). Whole genome DNA-methylation analysis was performed using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC 850k BeadChip kit. 
Data were analyzed by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding analysis (t-SNE). 
Results: T-SNE analysis of array-based DNA methylation data together with a previously generated methylation data set including 
8 samples of non-neoplastic muscle (control), 6 SMARCA4-deficient uterine sarcomas (SDUS), 18 low- (LGESS) and 31 high-
grade endometrial stromal sarcomas (HGESS), 22 embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas (eRMS), 27 leiomyomas (LMO) and 37 
leiomyosarcomas (LMS), as well as 15 uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex-cord tumors (UTROSCT) revealed multiple distinct 
methylation clusters (Figure 1). In detail, we identified a distinct cluster for UTROSCT (including two tumors with 
ESR1::NCOA3 gene fusion), that clustered with GREB1-rearranged tumors. KAT6B::KANSL1 tumors and PLAG1-rearranged 
tumors formed two distinct clusters near UTROSCT and HGESS, respectively, with few outliers distributed among other clusters. 
Both MEIS1::NCOA2 tumors clustered near eRMS. Interestingly, we observed two distinct clusters of smooth muscle tumors, both 
of which included LMO and LMS.

Figure 1 - 924 
 
Conclusions: Our study shows that GREB1-rearranged tumors closely resemble conventional UTROSCT based on DNA 
methylation analysis. Mesenchymal tumors with KAT6B::KANSL1, MEIS1::NCOA2 and PLAG1-rearragnement may represent 
molecularly distinct tumor entities, however larger cohorts of these rare neoplasms will have to be analyzed to expand on our 
findings. Furthermore, our study identifies two novel DNA methylation clusters of uterine smooth muscle tumors, which warrants 
further investigation.

Background: LMS presents in a wide range of anatomic locations. Little is known about the immune microenvironments and 
sensitivities to immune checkpoint (IC) inhibitors across tumor sites. We aimed to characterize and compare the immune 
landscapes in uterine LMS (uLMS) and non-uterine/soft tissue LMS (stLMS) to identify prognostic immune markers. 
Design: Immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1, TIM-3, Gal-9, LAG-3, CTLA4, MHCI, T cells and macrophages was evaluated 
by digital quantification in 41 uLMS and 37 stLMS. Cross-sectional analyses were performed with Fisher’s exact tests and logistic 
regression. Log-rank tests and Cox proportional regression models with adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were used to assess overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Sixty-three cases yielded sufficient 
RNA for whole exome sequencing to study expression profiles of 12,000 genes. 
Results: Median age was 58 years. More stLMS presented at higher stage than uLMS at diagnosis, and more uLMS (49%) 
exhibited PD-L1+ expression compared with stLMS (26%)(Fig.1). Expression of PD-L1, TIM-3, Gal-9 was associated with high 
MHCI expression, as well as elevated CD8+ T cells and macrophages (Fig.1). PD-L1 CPS+ status also correlated with increased 
FOXP3+ T regulatory cells. Median follow-up time was 37 months (range:1-246 months), with 41 deaths and 51 recurrences 
observed. Independent indicators for worse RFS included PD-L1 CPS≥5 (aHR:3.0; CI:1.1-8.1)(Fig.2A), high MHCI expression 
(aHR:5.0; CI:1.9-13.2)(Fig.2B) and stage III/IV disease (aHR:3.1; CI:1.3-7.6) after adjusting for tumor site and confounders. PD-L1 
CPS≥5 also predicted shorter OS (aHR:3.3; CI:1.1-10.4) after controlling for tumor features and adjuvant treatments. Upregulation 
of genes involved in IC-related functions and antigen processing was noted in LMS with PD-L1 CPS≥5 (Fig.2C). Differential 
expression of a subset of genes involved in DNA damage and repair (DDR) pathways was seen by different PD-L1 status (Fig.2D). 
 
  
 
S932 
Figure 1 - 925 
 
 
Figure 2 - 925 
 
Conclusions: PD-L1 CPS≥5 was a poor prognostic indicator of LMS regardless of uterine or non-uterine tumor site. Our findings 
highlight differences of PD-L1 positivity in uLMS and stLMS with gene expression correlation. Differential expression of DDR genes 
was associated with PD-L1 status, supporting IC ligand expression and its possible interaction with the DDR pathways, suggesting 
a potential opportunity of combined DDR and IC targeting therapies for LMS to achieve greater treatment efficacy.

Background: Recent immune checkpoint blockade therapies such as PD-1/PD-L1 have shown a low response in patients with 
ovarian carcinomas. It is still unclear if these therapies' advantages are related to the histology characterization or their tumor 
microenvironment(TME). This study aims to stratify a cohort of ovarian cancer according to their TME based on the cytotoxic T-
cells (CTLs) densities and PD-L1 expression by malignant cells (MCs) and correlate with pathologic characteristics in patients with 
ovarian carcinomas (OC). 
 
  
 
S933 
Design: The TME was analyzed in 53 OC tissue samples from patients with high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC,n=39) and clear 
cell carcinoma(CCC,n=14) using two multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF)panels(Figure 1). The cell phenotype's densities were 
dichotomized in > than the median as positive expression and ≤ than the median as negative expression. CTLs CD3+CD8+ and 
MCs PD-L1 expression were used to characterize four TMEs as adaptive immune resistance(Type I=CTL+PDL1+), immunological 
ignorance (Type II=CTL-PDL1-), intrinsic induction(Type III=CTL-PDL1+), and tolerance(Type IV=CTL+PDL1-)(Figure 2). 
Results: Thirty-eight out of 53 cases were metastatic tumors and 15 primary tumors. Type II(45.28%)group was the predominant 
group in the patient cohort. HGSC cases were grouped mainly in Type II TME, and the CCC cases were mostly distributed in TME 
Type I and III. We identified that the T-cell antigen-experienced CD3+PD-1+ had significantly higher densities(> median value as 
cutoff)in TME Type IV (median,25.2 cells/mm2,respectively)compared with the other three groups(median,10.5 
cells/mm2 P=0.0003)(Table 1).Similar, higher densities of CTLs PD-L1+(median,3.05 cells/mm2)and regulatory T-cells CD3+CD8-
FOXP3+(33.35 cells/mm2)were observed in the TME Type IV than in the other groups (median,2.2 cells/mm2 and 11.2 
cells/mm2,P=0.004 and P<0.0001,respectively).Macrophages were significantly higher in the TME Type I (median,118 
cells/mm2)when compared with the other groups(median,55 cells/mm2,P<0.0001).Higher densities of DC macrophages(median,5.4 
cells/mm2) were observed in Type I and total granulocytic cells(median 2.5cells/mm2) were observed in TME Type III than in the 
other groups (median,1.5cells/mm2 and 0 cells/mm2,respectively);no statistical significance was obtained.

Conclusions: We found that HGSC was predominantly an immunological ignorance TME (CTL-PD-L1-) and probably will not 
benefit from anti-PD-L1 not only for the lack of this expression but also for the lack of low CT. This TME classification could drive a 
better approach to personalized immunotherapy in patients with OC. 
 
927    Molecular Analysis of High-Grade Serous Carcinoma Simultaneously Involving the 
Endometrium and Adnexa are Clonal and Molecular Analysis May Help Determine Site of 
Origin

Disclosures: Nicholas Ladwig: None; Karuna Garg: None 
Background: Pelvic high-grade serous carcinoma (pHGSC) and uterine serous carcinoma (USC) show near-identical morphologic 
features and can be difficult to distinguish, although separation of these entities has implications for tumor staging, considerations 
for targeted therapy (i.e. HER2 for USC and homologous repair deficiency pathway for pHGSC), as well as for germline mutational 
testing for BCRA1/2 mutations. Patient age, tumor distribution, and WT1 staining patterns are traditionally used to help separate 
these entities but there can be significant overlap. We previously demonstrated that USC and pHGSC show distinct molecular 
profiles. USC harbor frequent alterations in PIK3CA, PPP2R1A, FBXW7, SPOP, PIK3R1, FGFR2, and HER2 compared to pHGSC 
(p-value < 0.01), and pHGSC showing exclusive or more frequent alterations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and NF1 (p-value = 0.03). We 
now sought to use paired sequencing of HGSC involving both the endometrium and adnexa to determine the utility of the proposed 
genes above versus clinicopathologic variables / WT1 staining in assigning a primary site. 
Design: Eight cases of HGSC involving both the endometrium and adnexa were identified (5 USC and 3 pHGSC), from which 
genomic DNA was purified from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue and capture based next-generation sequencing 
targeting 479 cancer genes was performed. Staining results for WT1 and HER2 (and HER2 FISH) were available for a subset of 
cases. 
Results: All sites tested from each case showed molecular clonality. No cases showed molecular alterations discordant with the 
original primary site designation. Cases of USC harbored either USC-associated alterations only (3/5); both USC (x2) and pHGSC-
associated (x1) alterations (1/5); or no USC or pHGSC-associated alterations (1/5). None of the pHGSC cases showed USC or 
pHGSC-associated alterations. USC showed negative or patchy WT1 staining, while all three pHGSC showed diffuse WT1 
labeling. 
 
  
 
S935 
Figure 1 - 927 
 
Conclusions: Molecular analysis of HGSC involving the endometrium and adnexa showed universal clonality; there was no 
evidence of synchronous primary tumors. Although not all cases showed specific molecular alterations associated with a particular 
primary site, there were no cases with alterations discordant with the assigned primary site. Our data also shows that USC often 
display patchy WT1 staining while pHGSC are typically diffusely WT1 positive.

Background: Placental site nodule is a trophoblastic lesion typically diagnosed in patients with a recent pregnancy presenting with 
persistent uterine bleeding or retained products of conception. When cytologic atypia or an elevated Ki-67 index is present, current 
diagnostic criteria recommend assigning a diagnosis of atypical placental site nodule (APSN). This entity presents a dilemma to 
treating gynecologists because there is little data on the outcome of APSN. Most patients receive curettage only and show 
uneventful follow up, but some patients have experienced recurrence of trophoblastic neoplasia or progression to malignancy. The 
aim of the study is to further document the clinical significance of APSN. 
Design: The study received institutional review board approval. Cases receiving primary diagnosis at a single institution from 2011 
to 2022 were identified.  The initial natural language search retrieved all cases containing the term “placental site nodule”. Results 
were manually curated to retain only cases classified as “atypical” or in which such classification was seriously entertained.  Glass 
slides were reviewed by two pathologists for confirmation. Required diagnostic features included large atypical trophoblastic cells, 
cohesive nests/cords, Ki-67 index, and/or necrosis. 
Results: The search identified 20 cases (15 primary; 5 residual/recurrent) of APSN in 15 women. Clinical data, management and 
outcome are summarized in Table 1. Three patients had persistently elevated serum HCG at presentation or follow-up. Ki-67 was 
used in diagnostic workup for 18 cases and was approximately 10% for all cases but two. In these, the index was <10% but 
abundant necrosis was present. Ten patients underwent immediate repeat uterine sampling, including four who had hysterectomy. 
Residual disease was identified in 0/10. Two patients received adjuvant methotrexate. All patients had some form of subsequent 
follow-up sampling. Within a mean follow-up interval of 4.6 months (range 1–12 months), four patients (27%) experienced locally 
recurrent disease which was managed with D&C or hysterectomy. No patients had distant recurrence or died of disease.

General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 
Disclosures: Natthawadee Laokulrath: None; Robert Young: None; Esther Oliva: None; Melinda Lerwill: None 
Background: Mammary-like lesions of the vulva (MLLV) are rare with only a limited number of cases reported in the literature. 
Herein, we describe a wide spectrum of MLLV, including benign glandular lesions, fibroepithelial tumors and carcinomas, some 
subtypes of which have not been previously reported. 
Design: 31 MLLV were retrieved from the files of two large academic hospitals. Hidradenoma papilliferum and Paget disease were 
excluded. An average of 3 H&E slides (range 1 to 16) and available immunohistochemical stains were reviewed. Tumors were 
classified based on the 2019 WHO Classification of Breast Tumours. 
Results: Patients ranged from 17 to 77 years and presented with a vulvar mass (n=11), cyst (n=6), or ulcer (n=1); in 1 case, the 
lesion was an incidental finding. Two patients had bilateral lesions, and two patients were pregnant. Benign glandular lesions 
included 6 nodular adenosis and 1 each of adenosis, galactocele, complex sclerosing lesion with collagenous spherulosis, nipple 
adenoma-like lesion, proliferative fibrocystic change, and periglandular stromal fibrosis. There were 11 fibroepithelial 
tumors including 6 fibroadenomas (1 with lactational change) and 5 phyllodes tumors (4 benign, 1 borderline). Two in-situ ductal 
 
  
 
S937 
carcinomas, 1 arising in a recurrent fibroadenoma and 1 within a complex sclerosing lesion, were identified. There were 6 invasive 
ductal carcinomas, 5 of no special type and 1 with papillary features, and associated in-situ carcinoma was seen in 4 cases. Of the 
invasive carcinomas, 3 were ER/PR+HER2-, 1 ER/PR/HER2+, 1 ER/PR/HER2-, and 1 ER/PR+ with unknown HER2. Background 
mammary-type glands and/or lesions were present in 7/8 carcinoma cases. Follow-up was available for all carcinoma patients 
(range 36-108 months, mean 60 months; and 1 patient only recently diagnosed). 4 patients were alive and well at 7 to 9 years 
(including both in-situ cases), 2 were alive with disease at 1 and 60 months, and 1 died of other causes at 8 years. 1 patient died 
and with liver, brain and bone metastases at 3 years after chemoradiation. 
Conclusions: We describe 31 MLLV, including several unique lesions such as galactocele, complex sclerosing lesion with 
collagenous spherulosis, nipple adenoma-like lesion, and carcinoma with papillary features that have not been previously reported 
to our knowledge. We also highlight the potentially aggressive behavior of invasive ductal carcinoma in this location, 
an uncommon progression only occasionally documented in the literature. 
 
930    Artificial Intelligence-Guided Spatial Transcriptomics in High Grade Serous Carcinoma: 
Toward Image Analysis Based Precision Oncology

Disclosures: Anna Laury: None; Omar Youssef: None; Carpen Olli: None 
Background: H&E images of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) may contain prognostic information currently 
detectable only by artificial intelligence (AI). We hypothesise that AI can identify regions with prognostic value, and that the biology 
of these regions can be revealed with spatial transcriptomics. 
Design: The initial cohort included 55 stage III-IV patients who underwent standard treatment (debulking surgery and platinum-
based therapy) but experienced distinct platinum-free intervals (PFI) (<6 vs >18 months). Previously, a deep learning neural 
network tool identified tumour regions most indicative of outcome within whole slide images (high confidence regions). Tissue 
microarrays were created containing both these high confidence (HC) tumor regions and background (BG) tumor regions from 16 
patients (8 with a PFI <6 months; S-PFI, and 8 with a PFI >18 months; L-PFI). The HC and BG regions were probed with the 
nanoString GeoMX for FFPE system, using pankeratin as the marker for region of interest selection, and analysed using the 
GeoMX Digital Spatial Profiler. 
Results: Analysis of the transcriptomics results reveal that 461 of the 10774 detected targets (4.2%) show significant (p = <0.05) 
differential expression between the S-PFI and L-PFI in the HC regions. Of these, 295 (2.7%) also showed no significant differential 
expression within the BG tissue regions. Among these 295 are several targets of interest, including: JUNB (p=0.004), ITGB8 
(p=0.035) and LPAR3 (p=0.040). Interestingly, cytokeratin 7 (p=0.011) expression was also significantly higher in S-PFI outcome 
group. 
Conclusions: Artificial intelligence-based image-analysis (AI-IA) of diagnostic HGSC slides can identify morphologic patterns 
invisible to the human eye and guide selection of biologically meaningful regions. Transcriptomics reveal several transcripts 
separating S-PFI and L-PFI tumors, specifically within the HC regions identified by AI-IA. In conclusion, AI-IA together with spatial 
transcriptomics offers a promising toolkit to identify biological features associated with cancer behaviour, making AI-based 
diagnoses more interpretable and clinically relevant.

1The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 
Disclosures: Barrett Lawson: None; Anais Malpica: None 
Background: Borderline (BBT) and malignant Brenner tumors (MBT) are rare, with limited clinicopathologic data, including 
immunohistochemical (IHC) and molecular characteristics. In this study, we present our experience with 43 of such cases. 
Design: A retrospective search of our laboratory information system using the term “Brenner” was conducted. This search covered 
the time period between 1/1/1985 and 7/31/2022. All cases had been diagnosed by gynecologic pathologists at our institution. The 
following information was recorded: patient’s (pt’s) age, diagnosis, tumor (Tu) size, IHC and molecular findings, FIGO stage, 
treatment and follow-up (f/u). 
Results: A total of 441 Brenner tumors were identified: MBT, 27 cases, and BBT, 16. Median age: pts with MBT, 62 yrs (34-80); 
pts with BBT, 70 yrs (38-81). Two MBT also had associated teratoma, and 1 had intraepithelial carcinoma (IEC). FIGO stage (18 
 
  
 
S938 
cases): stage 1A (11), stage 1B (1), stage 1C (3), and stage 3 (3). Median Tu size was 17.5 cm (12-25 cm). Treatment known in 16 
cases: 13 received adjuvant chemotherapy and 3 had surveillance only. On f/u, 2 died without disease, 1 alive with disease (AWD), 
1 dead of disease, and 11 were alive with no evidence of disease (NED); median f/u 48 months (m) (1-291 m). Of 16 cases with 
data for recurrence, 4 had progression/recurrence (median: 1.5 yrs, 0.75 to 5.3 yrs). 1 case had molecular data, with 
a TP53 mutation. 12 cases had IHC (Table 1).  One BBT had IEC, 1 with focal microinvasion (MI), and 2 with mucinous borderline 
tumors. FIGO stage (9 cases), all stage 1A. Median Tu size was 12.25 cm (5-32.5 cm). Treatment was known for 9 cases: 7 had 
BSO or TAH/BSO with peritoneum/omental sampling (of which 3 also had lymph node sampling), while 2 cases had only BSO or 
TAH/BSO; all of which had surveillance only. F/u (8 cases): 5 alive NED, 2 died without disease, and 1 AWD; median f/u 33 m (1-
147 m). 1 of 8 cases had recurrence: a case with MI, 8 yrs after diagnosis, with metastatic disease to a cervical LN. No cases had 
molecular or IHC data.

932    Clinical, Pathologic and Genomic Characterization of Rare Forms of Trophoblastic Disease: 
Placental Site Trophoblastic Tumor and Atypical Placental Site Nodule

Disclosures: Adam Lechner: None; Neal Lindeman: None; Carlos Parra-Herran: None 
Background: LPCAT1-TERT fusions have been recently described in epithelioid trophoblastic tumor. Other non-molar 
trophoblastic lesions, including placental Site Trophoblastic Tumor (PSTT) and atypical placental site nodule (APSN), are still 
poorly understood from a molecular perspective. Our aim is to document the prevalence of genomic alterations in well-annotated 
cohorts of PSTTs and APSNs. 
Design: Institutional specimens diagnosed as PSTT and APSN were retrieved, and diagnosis was confirmed by review of the 
available histologic material. Clinical and pathologic features were documented. Sequencing using a panel with 447-gene coverage 
was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumoral tissue. Tumor mutational burden (TMB), single-nucleotide variants 
and copy number alterations were evaluated. 
Results: Six patients with PSTT were included. Patient age ranged from 23 to 38 (median 33) years. All patients underwent simple 
hysterectomy. Tumor was confined to the uterus (FIGO stage I) in all cases. Myometrial invasion was 50% or greater in 5 of 6 
cases. Follow-up information was available in 4 patients (median 71 months, range 12-156); all were alive with no evidence of 
disease. Sequencing was successful in 4 tumors. TMB ranged from 3 to 10.6 mutations/mb. Chromosomal gain of 17q21, 
involving ETV4, was identified in 2 cases; in one, this change was seen as part of broader copy number gain in 17q21, whereas the 
gain was focal in the second tumor. ZNF217 missense variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were identified in 2 cases. Other 
alterations included a missense MUTYH pathogenic variant and a RAD51D VUS, as well as GNA11 and PVRL4 amplification (each 
seen in one case). Of 20 APSNs, 4 with the largest size (range 2.5-7.5 cm) were selected for sequencing. Median patient age was 
41 years (range 36-44). Three underwent hysterectomy, one curettage only. All had indolent outcome. TMB ranged from 2.3 to 6.1 
mutations/mb. MGA VUS and 21q22.12 gain involving RUNX1 were identified in 2 cases each. One APSN had 
a BRCA1 pathogenic frameshift variant. 
Conclusions: In this limited series, PSTT affects reproductive age women and, despite being often deeply myo-invasive, is 
confined to the uterus at time of presentation and followed by indolent outcome. PSTT and APSN are both characterized by a 
 
  
 
S939 
relatively low mutational burden and scarce genomic alterations. The finding of ETV4 copy gain and ZNF217 mutations in PSTT, 
and RUNX1 gain and MGA mutations in APSN, merits further study. 
 
933    Amount of Residual Disease Predicts Treatment outcome in Patients with Endometrioid 
Precancers after Progestin Therapy

Disclosures: Yan Li: None; Naijia Liu: None; Hao Chen: None; Elena Lucas: None; Wenxin Zheng: None 
Background: Conservative management with progestin is a treatment option for atypical hyperplasia or endometrioid intraepithelial 
neoplasia (AH/EIN). However, diagnosis of residual disease (RD) is often problematic because of the profound morphologic 
changes induced by progestin and lack of established diagnostic criteria. We have recently demonstrated that RD can be reliably 
identified by using biomarkers PTEN, PAX2, and β-catenin (PPB) in such setting. It is, however, currently unclear if the amount of 
RD in follow-up (F/U) samples has a predictive value for treatment outcome.  The study aimed to address this question by 
quantifying the RD and the amount of RD changes in a cohort with series F/Us. 
Design: 128 AH/EIN patients in the last 5 years were studied.  A total of 452 F/U endometrial samples with each patient having at 
least 2 F/Us studied.  The patients were divided into two outcome groups with successfully treated as responders and failure as 
non-responders.  The criteria for the former were defined by no RD in the 4th or the last F/U identified in those measurable 
endometrial biopsies.  RD diagnosis was based on morphologically none or poor responses after progestin therapy.  Biomarkers 
PPB were applied when morphologic diagnosis was uncertain (partial responses), where RD was defined when aberrancy of any 
PPB marker was found (as previously described).  The amount of RD was quantitated by using percentage against the total 
amount of evaluable endometria. Statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS software. 
Results: The progestin resistant rate of this study was 22.6% with 29 non-responders and 99 responders. Among 99 responders, 
44 patients had no RD in all F/Us and 53 patients showed RD decrease, while only 2 patients had an increased the amount of RD 
during F/Us.  In contrast, all non-responders had RD with 14 decreases, 12 increases and 3 no changes during F/Us 
(p<0.0001).  We have noticed that the more RD amount in the first 2 F/Us was more associated with non-responders.  Other 
selective data is listed in the following table.

Conclusions: The amount of RD in progestin treated F/U endometrial samples predicts outcome.  Failure of progestin therapy is 
associated with 20% or more RD in initial F/U biopsies, decrease less than 50% of RD amount or no significant changes in 
subsequent F/Us.  In contrast, successful therapy typically shows less than 20% of RD in initial F/U and 50% or more drop the 
amount of RD in subsequent F/Us.  It is important to document the amount of RD when evaluating F/U endometrial biopsies for 
patients with progestin therapy.

Background: According to the integrated multi-omics analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Uterine Corpus Endometrial 
Carcinoma (UCEC) can be divided into four subtypes including POLE/ultramutated, microsatellite instability-high/hypermutated, 
somatic copy-number alteration high/serous-like, and somatic copy-number alteration low. Besides single molecular classes 
 
  
 
S940 
(“single-classifier” ECs), there are some EC samples, with more than one molecular classifying feature (“multiple-classifier” ECs), of 
which the molecular genetic characteristics were unclear and deserved further investigations. 
Design: From January 2019 to August 2022, Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analyses were performed in 269 Chinese EC 
patients’ samples at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center using a 41-gene panel assay. On the basis of POLE mutations 
(POLEmut), microsatellite instability-high (MSI_H), and TP53 mutations (TP53mut), these patients were divided into “single-
classifier” ECs and “multiple-classifier” ECs. Mutations of “multiple-classifier” ECs were analyzed and then compared with “single-
classifier” ECs. The mutation and clinical parameters of TCGA-UCEC patients were downloaded from public dataset. Then, we 
reclassified TCGA-UCEC patients according to the above “single or multiple-classifier” rule to compare the prognosis of different 
subtypes. 
Results: Within the cohort of 269 Chinese patients with ECs, 29 patients were “multiple-classifier” (3 POLEmut+MSI_H, 14 
POLEmut+TP53mut, 2 POLEmut+MSI_H+TP53mut, and 10 MSI_H+TP53mut). In “multiple-classifier” ECs, the top ranked mutated 
genes were PTEN(93%), TP53(90%), and PIK3CA(83%). When compared with single POLEmut ECs, the “multiple-classifier” ECs 
with POLEmut underwent a higher frequency of TP53 mutations (p<0.05). When compared with single MSI_H ECs, the “multiple-
classifier” ECs with MSI_H underwent higher frequencies of TP53, EGFR, and AKT1 mutations (p<0.05). When compared with 
single TP53mut ECs, a total of 28 genes with higher mutation frequencies were detected in the “multiple-classifier” ECs with 
TP53mut (p<0.05). In terms of survival of UCEC patients, survival curves based on TCGA-UCEC dataset revealed that there was 
no statistic difference between POLEmut and “multiple-classifier” with POLEmut, nor statistic difference between MSI_H and 
MSI+TP53. 
Figure 1 - 934 
 
Conclusions: Some ECs have the characteristics of "multiple-classifier", and further understanding of this will provide new insight 
into the diagnosis and treatment strategy of "multiple-classifier" EC patients.

Copaciu: None 
Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to primarily infect human genital and oropharyngeal mucosa and persistent 
infections may lead to dysplasia and invasive carcinoma. The HPV L1 viral capsid protein is highly expressed during active viral 
 
  
 
S941 
replication. In transient HPV infections, or those that regress, HPV DNA is episomal and there is active viral replication, while in 
lesions that progress to severe dysplasia and carcinoma, the viral genome is integrated into the human genome and there is no 
viral replication.  Several studies have shown that immunohistochemistry for the HPV L1 protein, widely used within the European 
Union, labels cervical dysplasia that is transient in nature.1-4 The aim of this study was to assess the performance of HPV L1 IHC in 
a control group and in a set of normal and dysplastic cervical tissues, to establish that the test performs similarly to the published 
literature. 
Design: Immunohistochemistry for the HPV L1 protein was performed on 15 cervical biopsies and 25 cervical cytology cases with 
mild to moderate dysplasia (CIN 1 and 2) and verified HPV L1 protein expression and 15 negative cervical biopsies and 25 
negative cervical cytology cases. The presence of HPV DNA was confirmed by PCR in all the positive cases. HPV L1 IHC was also 
evaluated in non-neoplastic cervix (3), CIN 1 (17), CIN 3 (39), and cervical squamous cell carcinoma (2). Strong nuclear staining in 
at least one cell was considered positive. 
Results: For the positive control group, HPV L1 IHC was positive in 38/40 (95%) cases and for the negative group, 1/40 cases 
showed L1 expression in a single cell (2%). For the additional tissue samples, HPV L1 IHC was positive in 8/17 (47%) CIN 1 cases, 
3/39 (8%) CIN 3 cases, and in no (0%) cervical squamous cell carcinoma and non-neoplastic cervix. This IHC test showed less 
background staining compared with the reference method. 
Figure 1 - 935 
 
Figure 2 - 935 
 
Conclusions: This study successfully validates the performance of HPV L1 IHC for identification of HPV L1 capsid protein in 
cervical dysplasia. In the control group, HPV L1 IHC showed a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 98%. In the cervical tissue 
evaluation, HPV L1 IHC was frequently positive in CIN 1 lesions and only rarely positive in CIN 3 lesions, consistent with published 
literature.1-4 These findings indicate that the HPV L1 antibody is a highly sensitive and specific marker for the HPV L1 capsid 
protein, which correlates with active viral replication and regression in cervical dysplasia.

Background: Uterine sarcomas resembling fibrosarcoma or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a group of 
tumors with predilection for the uterus and cervix that may harbor tyrosine kinase fusions (i.e. NTRK1/2/3, COL1A1-
PDGFB, FGFR1 or RET).  Within this group, distinguishing S100-positive uterine sarcomas resembling MPNST from spindle cell 
melanomas may be difficult.  We sought to determine whether alterations in ERBB2, encoding a tyrosine kinase, may be a driver 
event in a subset of these tumors. 
 
  
 
S942 
Design: A retrospective search of a reference molecular laboratory (Foundation Medicine) was performed for ERBB2-mutated 
uterine and cervical sarcomas that had previously undergone hybrid capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) during 
the course of clinical care.  Clinicopathological and genomic data were centrally re-reviewed. 
Results: We report recurrent activating ERBB2 V777L point mutation in 7 uterine spindle cell neoplasms originally diagnosed as 
sarcomas (n=6) or malignant spindle cell tumor most consistent with MPNST (n=1).  Tumors were primarily located in the cervix or 
in the uterine corpus with extensive cervical involvement extending into the vagina.  Key pathological features included (1) a 
preponderance of spindle cells in a fascicular pattern, (2) irregular tumor borders with spindle cells infiltrating between muscle 
fibers of uterine or endocervical wall, (3) high-grade nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, and multifocal epithelioid morphology, (4) diffuse 
positivity for S100 and SOX10, (5) retained H3K27me3 expression and (6) negative expression of CD34, CD10 and caldesmon by 
immunohistochemistry. In addition to ERRB2 V777L, 43% (3/7) of tumors harbored co-occurring ERBB2 amplification, while 29% 
(2/7) had a co-occurring ERRB3 point mutation, further enhancing ERRB2/HER2 pathway activation.  Other recurrent molecular 
alterations included CDKN2A loss (86%, 6/7), inactivating mutations of ATRX (71%, 5/7), TP53 (29%, 2/7), and all tumors were 
negative for NTRK1/2/3, COL1A1-PDGFB, FGFR1, RET fusions. 
Conclusions: ERBB2 V777L defines a subset of uterine spindle cell neoplasms that, in current practice, may best be tentatively 
classified as melanomas based on diffuse S100 and SOX10 positivity and retained H3K27me3 expression, although MPNSTs 
cannot be entirely excluded. Identification of ERBB2-mutated uterine spindle cell neoplasms may be of potential diagnostic 
significance in difficult-to-classify tumors and of therapeutic value with FDA-approved, anti-HER2 inhibitors.

Background: Endocervical adenocarcinoma (ECA) is increasingly reported in young women and aggressive disease that lacks 
effective methods of targeted therapy. Since mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/high microsatellite instable (MSI-H) are important 
biomarkers for predicting responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies, it is important to investigate the clinical, 
histopathological and immune microenvironment of dMMR ECAs. 
Design: We assessed 701 ECAs on representative tissue microarray sections, gathered clinicopathologic information, review 
histological characteristics and performed immunohistochemical staining for MMR, programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and tumor-
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) markers. 
Results: Of the 701 ECA samples, 27 (3.9%) had dMMR. Among them, loss of MMR protein expression was observed in 14/638 
(2.2%) HPV-associated adenocarcinoma (HPVA) and 13/63 (23.6%) non-HPV-associated adenocarcinoma (NHPVA). In NHPVA 
cohort, dMMR status was observed in 8/27 (29.6%), 2/27 (7.40%), 3.7% (1/27) and 7.4% (2/27) patients with clear cell type, 
gastric-type, endometrioid type and unclassified type, respectively. Loss of MMR expression in tumors with pattern C was 
significantly higher than in those with pattern A and B in HPVA (P=0.03). Moreover, dMMR ECAs is association with histological 
types(P<0.001), larger tumor size (P=0.009), P16 negative (P<0.001) and higher stromal TILs (P=0.031) compared with pMMR 
ECAs. Among the morphologic variables evaluated, TILs and peritumoal lymphocytes are easily recognized in the dMMR ECAs. In 
addition, positive PD-L1 expression was seen in 369 of the 701 patients (52.6%) with an average combined positive score (CPS) of 
15.3%. A relative high prevalence of PD-L1 expression was observed in dMMR ECAs (85.1% by CPS, 74.0% by immune cell score 
[ICS] and37.0% by tumour proportion score [TPS]). dMMR ECAs had higher CD3+ TILs (557.2/mm2 vs. 393.8/mm2), CD8+ TILs 
(678.2/mm2 vs. 262.8/mm2) and CD68+ TILs (96.4/mm2 vs. 49.1/mm2) phenotypes compared with the pMMR ECAs. PD-L1-
positive expression was identified in 94.1% of TILs-high cases in the dMMR group, while only 67.8% of TILs-high cases were PD-
L1-positive in the pMMR group. 
Conclusions: The dMMR ECAs were found significantly more often in NHPVA, especially in patients with clear cell type. 
Compared with the pMMR ECAs, the dMMR ECAs was more likely to present with a TIL-high/PD-L1-positive status, which may 
contribute to the improved response to ICI therapies.

938     β-catenin and PTEN as Predictive Biomarkers of Response to Progestin Therapy for Patients 
with Endometrioid Precancers

Disclosures: Naijia Liu: None; Yan Wang: None; Wanrun Lin: None; Wenxin Zheng: None 
Background: Biomarkers PTEN, PAX2, and β-catenin (PPB) have played a major role in the diagnosis of pre- and post-progestin 
treated atypical hyperplasia or endometrioid intraepithelial neoplasia (AH/EIN). However, their predictive significance remains 
undefined. We aimed to assess if aberrancy of PPB has a predictive value in response to progestin therapy. 
Design: 128 AH/EIN patients in the last 5 yrs were studied, covering a total of 452 follow-up (F/U) endometrial biopsies. Each 
patient had at least 2 and up to 4 F/Us in the cohort. Among initial and 4 F/Us, 351 samples were available for analyses. Patients 
had two outcome categories: responders and non-responders, which were defined by absence or presence of residual diseases 
(RD) in the 4th or the last F/U identified in those measurable samples.  AH/EIN or RD was diagnosed if morphologically 
diagnosable. Biomarkers PPB were applied when ambiguous morphology encountered. RD was defined when aberrancy of any 
PPB marker was found (PMID: 32931681; 34545858). Statistical analyses were performed by using Fisher’s exact test.  
Results: Among all 351 samples examined, the 3 PPB biomarkers showed the following results: 91 (26%) all negative, 140 (40%) 
1 marker positive, 102 (29%) 2 markers positive, and 18 (5%) all positive. Compared to responders, the frequency of aberrant PPB 
at the initial AH/EIN diagnosis of non-responders had a significantly higher PTEN loss (75.86% vs 39.79%, p<0.01), more β-catenin 
aberrancy (41.18% vs 33.93%, p<0.05), but no significant differences for Pax2 (64.62% vs 66.33%, p=0.685). This trend of 
aberrancy remained the same in F/U samples with PTEN (64.28% vs 26.27%, p<0.01), β-catenin (60% vs 31.58%, p<0.001), and 
Pax2 (64.28% vs 62.16%, p=0.703). We also observed that the PPB marker expression changed from non-aberrancy to aberrant 
expression (Table 1).

Note: p values were obtained by using Fisher exact test.  
Conclusions: Significantly more aberrancy of PTEN and β-catenin in non-responders indicates that these two may be associated 
with poor outcome of progestin therapy, while Pax2 is not. Among the 3 PPB markers, newly emerged β-catenin aberrancy in any 
F/U biopsies may be indicative of progestin resistance.  Studies with a larger sample size are needed to confirm the findings.

Disclosures: Haiyan Lu: None; Wencheng Li: None; Yanjun Hou: None 
Background: Endometrial stromal tumor (EST) is rare uterine mesenchymal lesions, including endometrial stromal nodule (ESN) 
and low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LGESS). Nuclear expression of β-catenin, an indication of activated Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling pathway, was described in over 60% of LGESS. β-catenin interacts with the T-cell factor/LEF family, specifically LEF-1, in 
the nucleus to form a transcription complex which regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway downstream mediators in cell cycle 
control and oncogenesis. In the present study, we evaluated the expression of LEF-1 in ESTs and compared the utility of β-catenin 
and LEF-1 immunostaining for the characterization of ESTs. 
Design: A pathology archive database search was performed for cases with a diagnosis of ESN and LGESS at our institution from 
01/2002 to 08/2022. The corresponding clinicopathological features were collected. Immunohistochemistry for β-catenin and LEF-1 
were performed on whole slide sections. Only nuclear staining pattern of β-catenin and LEF-1 were considered as positive. The 
degree of immunoreactivity for β-catenin and LEF-1 was evaluated semiquantitatively on the basis of staining intensity and the 
percentage of positive cells. For evaluating β-catenin, 30% of stained tumor cells was considered as positive. 
 
  
 
S944 
Results: A total of 20 cases from 19 patients were identified, including 2 ESN and 18 LGESS. Among the 18 LGESS, 10 were 
primary from the uterus and 8 were metastases/recurrence. The average age was of 48.7 (ranges 22-77) years for LGESS. 90% 
(18/20) of the cases was positive for β-catenin. 80% (16/20) of cases was LEF-1 positive if any tumor nuclear staining was 
considered as positive. 70% (14/20) was LEF-1 positive if 30% was used as the cut-off value (Figure 1/Table 1). There is no 
significant difference of the performance of β-catenin and LEF-1 in primary or metastatic/recurrent settings (p=0.12 and 0.42, 
respectively). The staining pattern of LEF-1 in cellular leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma is ongoing to evaluate its sensitivity and 
specificity for diagnosis of LGESS. 
Figure 1 - 939 
 
Conclusions: Our study showed high positivity of LEF-1 staining in LGESS in both primary and metastatic/recurrent settings. β-
catenin has strong background cytoplasmic and membranous staining and can be challenging to interpret. In contrast, LEF-1 
shows a clear nuclear staining pattern. In conjunction with β-catenin, LEF-1 can be a potential useful immunohistochemical marker 
for diagnosis of LGESS. 
 
940    Prostatic Metaplasia of the Vaginal Epithelium in Female-To-Male Transgender Patients 
Occurs More Commonly in Younger Patients Irrespective of Hormonal Influences

Disclosures: Miranda Machacek: None; Kristine Cornejo: None; Jaclyn Watkins: None; Esther Oliva: None 
Background: Prostatic metaplasia of the vaginal epithelium is an established phenomenon in female-to-male (FtM) transgender 
patients on hormonal testosterone therapy.  However, etiologic factors influencing the development of prostatic metaplasia (i.e., 
years or dose of hormonal therapy and estrogenic effects from increased body mass index (BMI)) are unknown.  Additionally, it is 
unclear if premalignant or malignant transformation may occur.  Assessing the natural course of prostatic metaplasia is thus 
important to understand potential health risks and need for screening for FtM patients on long-term hormonal therapy. 
Design: We collected 41 vaginal excision specimens from 37 FtM patients from December 2019 to June 2022. The presence or 
absence of prostatic metaplasia was correlated to dose and duration of testosterone therapy as well as BMI, which were obtained 
from the electronic medical record. One to four H&E slides (mean=2.19) were examined per patient. 
Results: Twenty-two patients had prostatic metaplasia (22/37=59%), while 15 did not (41%). The development of prostatic 
metaplasia in vaginal epithelium was not significantly associated with dose of testosterone (range = 25-420 mg/week, t-test, p=.55, 
 
  
 
S945 
Fig. 1A) or BMI (range=18.79-46, χ2=0.16, p=.69, Fig. 1B).  However, the length of time on testosterone therapy (range=2-33 
years) was significantly different between those with (median=4) and without (median=11.5) prostatic metaplasia (t-test, p=.014, 
Fig. 2A). Interestingly, a shorter—rather than longer—duration of hormonal therapy was associated with the finding of prostatic 
metaplasia (Fig. 2A). When patients were stratified based on age (range = 19-61 years), those <50 years old were significantly 
more likely to have prostatic metaplasia compared to those >50 years old (Fisher’s exact test, p=.042, Fig. 2B).  Premalignant or 
malignant changes were not identified. 
Figure 1 - 940 
 
Figure 2 - 940 
 
Conclusions: At the time of surgery, younger individuals (<50 years) are more likely to have prostatic metaplasia than older 
individuals (>50 years) irrespective of dose of testosterone therapy or BMI, suggesting a different inherent response of the 
squamous epithelium to testosterone in younger individuals.  Importantly, none of the patients developed premalignant or malignant 
changes, which suggests that long-term hormonal therapy can be a safe alternative for patients choosing not to undergo surgical 
intervention.

941    Somatic Tumor Sequencing and Microsatellite Instability Results in Mismatch Repair-
Deficient Endometrial Carcinomas from Patients without Lynch Syndrome: Implications for 
Immunotherapeutic Biomarkers

Disclosures: Ngome Makia: None; Kari Ring: None; Anne Mills: None 
Background: Checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis are FDA-approved for patients with solid tumors showing 
mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd), including endometrial carcinomas. The College of American Pathologists recently released 
guidelines recommending MMR IHC as the first-line biomarker for these immunotherapies, though abnormalities detected on next-
generation sequencing (NGS) or microsatellite instability (MSI) testing can also qualify patients. While most MMRd ECAs are 
attributable to either MLH1 hypermethylation (MLH1hm) or Lynch syndrome (LS), somatic mutations are increasingly recognized 
contributors.  It important to understand how frequently non-LS-associated, non-MLH1hm ECAs with MMR IHC loss have somatic 
MMR pathogenic variants identified on NGS and/or are MSI-high in order to optimize immunotherapeutic biomarker selection in this 
population.  
Design: Tumor NGS +/- MSI testing was performed on 18 ECAs with IHC loss of MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, or MSH6 but negative 
MMR germline results, as well as negative MLH1hm where relevant (all MLH1/PMS2-deficient tumors). 
Results: Average patient age was 60.5 (Range: 21-85).  The majority (16/18) of tumors were endometrioid (FIGO 1: 12, FIGO 2: 2, 
FIGO 3: 3); the 2 remaining cases were dedifferentiated.  Somatic tumor NGS was successful in 94% (17/18) and provided a 
molecular correlate for the IHC loss pattern in 94% (16/17) with available results. MSI testing was successful in 94% (15/16) and 
was MSI-H in 80% (12/15) and MSI-low in 20% (3/15). One case showed MSH2/MSH6 IHC loss, but failed somatic NGS and MSI 
testing due to the paucity of tumor present.  Another case showed loss of MSH6 by IHC, but showed no tumoral pathogenic 
variants on somatic NGS analysis; MSI testing was MSI-low.  
Conclusions: Somatic tumor NGS and MSI testing were successful in the majority of non-LS, non-MLH1hm ECAs with MMR 
deficiency by IHC, however each failed in one instance. While tumor NGS and MSI testing identified an expected MMR gene 
pathogenic variant and high-level MSI in most cases when successful, a subset were MSI-low and one showed no pathogenic 
variants on NGS. These occasional discrepant results underscore the fact that these tests are not entirely interchangeable as 
biomarkers of immunotherapeutic vulnerability, and that both MSI testing and tumor NGS may miss rare checkpoint inhibitor 
candidates based on IHC. This is particularly relevant as some institutions consider replacing MMR IHC entirely with molecular 
methods. 
 
942    Targetable HER2 Mutations in Gynecologic Malignancies: Clinicopathological,

Background: HER2 (ErbB2) is a well-established therapeutic target not only in breast and gastric cancer, but also in endometrial 
carcinoma (EC). Current treatment eligibility requires HER2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or gene 
amplification. Recent evidence supports the efficacy of HER2-inhibitors against activating mutations in breast, lung, and other solid 
cancers. However, comprehensive studies on HER2 mutations in gynecologic tumors are lacking. 
Design: Our institutional database was searched for HER2 mutations in gynecologic specimens. Clinicopathological information 
and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) results were retrieved from medical records. HER2 IHC (Abcam EP3, 1:250) was 
performed on a representative slide of all tumors. The proposed scoring system for serous EC, requiring strong, complete or 
lateral/basolateral staining in >30% of tumor cells (3+ score) was used for IHC interpretation. The cBioportal database was queried 
for HER2-mutant gynecologic tumors and the OncoKB™ database to extract information about specific alterations. 
Results: We identified 12 gynecologic tumors with HER2 mutations: 10 (83%) endometrial (4 clear cell EC, 3 mixed EC, 1 
endometrioid EC, 1 carcinosarcoma, and 1 low grade stromal sarcoma), 1 ovarian mucinous adenocarcinoma, and 1 HPV-
associated endocervical adenocarcinoma. HER2 IHC was negative (0 or 1+) in 8 tumors (67%) and 2+ in 4 (33%). We identified 9 
discrete HER2 mutations (Table 1). The most frequent was R678Q (n=5, 41.7%), 5 were in the active region of the tyrosine kinase 
domain (D769Y, V777L, L755S, T733I, and T862A), 2 in the extracellular domain (L313V and G152A), and 2 
harbored HER2 rearrangements. No tumors had coexisting HER2 amplification. cBioportal revealed 155 of 4569 (3.4%) 
gynecologic tumors (114 endometrial, 24 ovarian, 17 cervical) with 83 discrete ERBB2 mutations (Figure 1). Of the 114 
endometrial, 18 (16%) harbored T862A (c.2524G>A), 15 (13%) R678Q (c.2033G>A), and 5 (4%) L755S (c.2264T>C).

Conclusions: HER2 mutations are most common in EC among gynecologic cancers, with R678Q most frequent in our cohort, and 
T862A in cBioportal. While no HER2-mutated tumors had a 3+ IHC score, increased HER2 expression (2+) was seen in tumors 
with L313V, R678Q, and T862A mutations, and HER2 rearrangement. Targeted therapy has already been applied in other tumor 
types with these HER2 mutations; however, further studies are necessary to explore the prognostic and therapeutic implications of 
these findings in gynecologic cancers.

Background: Squamous morules can be seen in a variety of gynecologic lesions ranging from benign entities such as 
endometriosis and endometrial polyp to endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EEC). Previous 
studies have established an association between squamous morules and EEC and a recent study showed CTNNB1 (Beta-catenin) 
mutations in squamous morules associated with EEC. In this study we explore the utility of Beta-catenin immunohistochemistry 
(IHC), specifically aberrant nuclear Beta-catenin expression, as a surrogate for CTNNB1 mutation, in predicting the behavior of 
squamous morules across the spectrum of various gynecologic lesions. 
Design: A total of 38 women with diagnostic findings of squamous morules on endometrial biopsy/curettage were identified, with 
median follow-up of 22 months (Table 1). Patients were chosen such that a spectrum of benign and malignant entities were present 
in the cohort to include benign (endometriosis, polyp, etc.), simple hyperplasia without atypia (SH), progestin treated hyperplasia 
without residual disease (xSH), and complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH) or EEC. Beta-catenin immunostain was performed on a 
representative slide from each patient and aberrant staining was defined as strong nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. 
Results: Our cohort consisted of patients with biopsies reported as benign (n=12), SH (n=12), xSH (n=6), CAH/EEC (n=8). All 
squamous morules were focally distributed in the 12 benign biopsies. Diffuse distribution of squamous morules was seen in one 
biopsy with xSH and two cases of CAH/EEC. Aberrant Beta-catenin expression was observed in 8 (75%) of benign, 10 (83%) SH, 6 
(100%) xSH and 8 (100%) CAH/EEC biopsies (Figure 1). Aberrant expression of Beta-catenin was more common in biopsies from 
patients with a diagnosis of CAH/EEC than benign or SH (100 % vs 75%, p = 0.02). 14 patients presenting with benign or SH (+/- 
treatment) on initial biopsy had either CAH or EEC at 22 month follow-up (4 benign, 6 SH, 4 xSH). All of these patients had 
aberrant Beta-catenin expression of squamous morules on initial biopsy (sensitivity = 100%; specificity = 37.5%).

Conclusions: Our data show that aberrant Beta-catenin staining of squamous morules in benign endometrial biopsies is sensitive 
for CAH/EEC on subsequent sampling while normal (membranous) Beta-catenin is associated with benign lesions at follow-up. 
Larger prospective cohort validation is warranted to fully explore potential negative predictive value of Beta-catenin IHC.

Background: Endometrial Complex Mucinous Change (CMC) is a spectrum of mucinous epithelial alterations (epithelial 
stratification, intraglandular papillation to architecturally more complex proliferation without confluent growth, and simple mucinous 
change with cytological atypia). CMC may harbor KRAS mutations and is associated with subsequent or concurrent endometrial 
atypical hyperplasia (AH) or endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EC). We investigated clinicopathologic outcomes of KRAS mutation in 
CMC in a large prospective cohort. 
Design: Consecutive endometrial biopsy/curettage specimens of CMC were retrieved, excluding those with coexisting AH or EC. 
Cytological atypia, a component of the original diagnosis albeit not retrospectively reviewed, was defined by variably enlarged 
nuclei, hyperchromatic chromatin, and presence of prominent nucleoli. KRAS mutation analysis was performed by single strand 
conformation polymorphism and Sanger sequencing. Statistical analyses included student t-tests, Pearson chi-squared tests, and 
Kaplan–Meier statistic/Cox-Mantel Log-Rank tests (a=0.05). Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured from CMC diagnosis to 
the date of subsequent disease (AH or EC) or last known alive without progression. 
Results: Among 110 CMC study cases (Table 1), KRAS mutation was found in 49 (45%) cases. Cytological atypia was seen in 
33% (16/49) of KRAS mutants vs 23% (14/61) of cases without the mutation (p=0.26). Subsequent disease (AH or EC) was seen in 
43% (21/49) of cases with KRAS mutation vs 23% (14/61) of cases without the mutation (p=0.026). Of 8 ECs, KRAS mutation was 
detected in 7 (87.5%) corresponding CMCs. When stratified by cytological atypia, progression occurred in 63% (19/30) with 
cytological atypia, compared to 20% (16/80) without (p<0.001). Half (4/8) of CMC cases that progressed to EC had cytological 
atypia. KRAS mutation predicted adverse PFS (56% at 60 months) compared to wt KRAS (76%, p=0.041; Fig A). The presence of 
cytological atypia also predicted worse PFS (35% at 60 months) compared to its absence (79%, p<0.001; Fig B). The presence of 
both KRAS mutation and cytological atypia better stratified patients for worse PFS (25% at 60 months) compared to the absence 
of KRAS mutation with or without cytological atypia (75%, p<0.001; Fig C).

Background: HER2/neu (HER2) amplification in cervical cancers ranges from 1-12% and has been associated with worse clinical 
prognosis. Pre-clinical studies have shown efficacy of various HER2 inhibitors in HER2-amplified cervical cancers. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for HER2 receptor has been a universally accepted surrogate test for HER2 amplification, however 
there is no standardized immunohistochemistry scoring system for cervical carcinomas. In this study, we investigated HER2 
 
  
 
S951 
overexpression in cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and correlated it with HER2 amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization 
(FISH) and molecular methods. 
Design: 72 cases of cervical squamous cell carcinoma were retrospectively reviewed and two representative tumor sections were 
retrieved and stained for HER2. HER2 scoring was performed using the breast criteria, and cases with moderate (2+) to strong (3+) 
expression were analyzed for HER2 amplification by FISH, followed by molecular analysis using a 168-gene next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) panel on HER2-amplified cases. DNA extraction, DNA quantification, library preparation and sequencing were 
performed as described (Kadri S. et al, 2017). 
Results: The average age at diagnosis was 50 years (range 27-85), and most patients were African American (73.6%) and 
diagnosed at FIGO stage I (65.3%) (Table 1). 19 cases (26.4%) had 2+ HER2 expression and 4 (5.5%) had 3+ expression. 
Three of 4 cases with 3+ expression had enough tumor for FISH and all 3 were amplified (Figure 1). Three cases with moderate 
expression showed HER2 polysomy on FISH, and 12 did not show any amplification. Higher tumor grade and regional lymph node 
metastasis had significant correlation with both HER2 overexpression (p=0.023 and 0.010, respectively) and HER2 FISH 
amplification (p=0.027 and <0.001, respectively). Increased depth of invasion and higher tumor stage were associated 
with HER2 amplification (p=0.047 and 0.004, respectively). HER2 amplification trended towards significance for survival. NGS of 
the HER2-amplified tumors showed amplification of CD274, JAK2, BIRC3, and ERBB2 (equivocal), and PIK3CA missense 
mutation. All tested positive for HPV (two HPV 16, one HPV 18). 
 
 
  
 
S952 
Figure 1 - 945 
 
Conclusions: HER2 immunohistochemistry is a reliable predictive marker of HER2 gene amplification in squamous cell carcinoma 
of the cervix. HER2 overexpression and/or HER2 amplification are associated with poor prognostic factors, such as increased 
tumor grade, size, and depth of invasion, as well as nodal metastasis.

Background: LVSI is known to be associated with an unfavourable outcome in EC. Recent studies have shown that distinguishing 
cases with “negative or focal” LVSI from cases with “substantial” LVSI is one of the strongest prognosticators of local as well as 
distant recurrence after primary therapy. Therefore, modern risk-assessment algorithms will have to include thorough LVSI 
quantification during routine histopathological workup. It was the aim of this study to investigate impact and interobserver variability 
of LVSI quantification in a consecutive series of EC in which LVSI had been reported to be positive after routine pathology 
assessment. 
Design: EC patients (n=770) treated at the Tuebingen University Women’s Hospital between 2003 and 2016 were identified. All 
cases in which LVSI had been reported as being “positive” after routine pathology assessment of hysterectomy specimens were 
independently reviewed by four experienced gynecopathologists according to current clinical practice (review of all tumor-
containing H&E stained slides). A subset of cases was additionally submitted for D2-40 and CD31 immunohistochemistry (IHC). A 
final LVSI score was reached by majority vote of the expert panel.  
Results: A total of 95 cases was available for this study. Interobserver variability after initial H&E scoring was high, with a total 
agreement reached in 47 of 95 (49.5%) cases. Additional IHC contributed to reaching total agreement. According to the final 
majority vote, LVSI was called substantial in 50/95 (53%) cases. In the latter subset of cases, 5-yr disease-specific survival (DSS) 
was 42%, in contrast to 74% in LVSI focal/negative cases. While established clinicopathological parameters were shown to be of 
 
  
 
S953 
prognostic significance after univariate analyses, LVSI quantification was shown to be the only independent prognosticator after 
multivariate analyses in this cohort (HR 2,24; p=0,04). 
Conclusions: The results of our study strongly support LVSI quantification in EC as a means to guide adjuvant treatment. IHC 
staining of vascular markers might help reduce interobserver variability in the assessment of LVSI. Further studies are warranted 
and may change future surgical pathology practice.

Background: A recent molecular study of myxoid uterine leiomyosarcomas (M-LMS) reported that almost 1/3 of cases 
harbor PLAG1 fusions. A single additional report described M-LMS with PLAG1 fusion and osteosarcomatous and liposarcomatous 
(LPS) differentiation. Triggered by a case of PLAG1-rearranged uterine sarcoma (PLAG1-US) lacking convincing expression of 
smooth muscle markers (SMM), we decided to study a larger cohort of these tumors. 
Design: Cases of PLAG1-US irrespective of their histology were collected from 4 different institutions and reviewed with a 
particular focus on their morphology and the presence of convincing smooth muscle immunophenotype (SMI) defined by the 
expression of at least 2 SMM. 
Results: Eight cases of PLAG1-US were collected; their features are summarized in Table. Patients ranged in age from 38-67 
years (mean: 54.4). All tumors were centered to the uterine corpus and ranged in size from 6.5-32 cm (mean: 17.8). Most were 
treated by hysterectomy with salpingectomy/adnexectomy. All 4 cases with follow-up behaved aggressively 
(recurred/metastasized). Morphologically, the tumors showed a high intertumoral but also intratumoral heterogeneity which was 
also noted between primary lesions and recurrences/metastases. M-LMS-like morphology was present in only 2 of the primaries; 
cases 1 and 7 showed such areas in the metastases. Most tumors consisted of variably ovoid/spindled to epithelioid cells growing 
predominantly in solid sheets. In some cases, the stroma was prominently hyalinized or partially myxoid. High-rade myxoid LPS-
like areas were present in the metastasis in case 7; case 8 showed myxoid LPS-like (both low and high-grade) and 
chondrosarcomatous (CHS) areas. Metastasis in case 1 also exhibited foci of ambiguous adipocytic differentiation (with focal S100 
expression). Immunohistochemically, cases 1, 2, and 4 did not exhibit a convincing SMI. The metastasis in case 7 showed diffuse 
S100 protein expression while lacking SMI. All 6 different fusion partners detected were novel in this tumor type. In case 8, only 
PLAG1 FISH was performed. Tumor mutation burden was assessed in 2 cases, being high (12.3 mut/MB) in one case and low (4 
mut/MB) in the other.

Conclusions: PLAG1-US tend to present as large uterine masses and frequently behave aggressively. Their heterogeneous 
morphology encompasses a much broader spectrum than previously reported, and also includes heterologous CHS or 
adipocytic/LPS differentiation. Many cases lack convincing SMI or expression of SMM altogether.

Background: The anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab is FDA-approved for the treatment of cervical carcinoma with a 
PD-L1 Combined Positive Score (CPS) of ≥1. We aimed to evaluate PD-L1 expression in the most common histologic types of 
cervical carcinoma, and assess interobserver agreement in CPS to identify whether it may impact patient selection for 
immunotherapeutic candidacy. 
Design: 29 cervical carcinomas (18 squamous cell carcinomas [SCC], 6 HPV-associated adenocarcinomas [HPVA], 3 
adenosquamous carcinomas [ASC], 1 mixed squamous and small cell carcinoma, and 1 small cell carcinoma) represented on 
cervical biopsy/endocervical curettage (7), cone/LEEP (10), hysterectomy (11), and lung biopsy (1) were stained for PD-L1 (Dako 
22C3). Glass slides corresponding to whole-tissue sections were interpreted by 5 subspecialty-trained gynecologic pathologists 
with experience reading PD-L1 immunohistochemistry. Expression was scored using the CPS and read out as positive (≥1) or 
negative (<1); in positive cases, a final score was assigned (0-100). 
Results: There was consensus agreement across all five pathologists for 90% (26/29) of cases (Light's Kappa interobserver 
agreement: 0.799). Of the 26 with consensus, 88% (23/26) were positive and 12% (3/26) were negative. 100% (16/16) of SCC with 
consensus were interpreted as positive, whereas tumors with glandular components (HPVA, ASC) were commonly consensus 
negative (33%, 3/9); this difference was significant (p=0.037). Biopsy cases more often had a consensus negative read than 
LEEP/cones or resections, however this trend was not significant (29%, 2/7 versus 5%, 1/19, p=0.167). The three cases with 
disagreement were comprised of two SCC and one small cell carcinoma. One case was called negative by three readers, while the 
other two were called negative by a single reader. Disagreements were attributable to low CPS versus negative reads (2 cases) 
and difficulty discerning glandular involvement from pushing invasion (1 case).    
Conclusions: Experienced gynecologic pathologists show substantial interobserver agreement in the interpretation of PD-L1 CPS 
at the FDA-approved treatment threshold, with the majority of tumors interpreted as positive. Pure squamous histology was strongly 
associated with a consensus positive read, whereas a subset of tumors with glandular differentiation were negative by all readers. 
Disagreements occurred in tumors with low versus negative CPS values and in the setting of limited invasion.

Background: Immunohistochemistry expression of HIK1083, a component of pyloric-type mucin, has been used as a specific 
marker of gastric-type endocervical carcinoma in the context of gynecologic malignancies.  HIK1083 immunohistochemical 
expression in primary ovarian epithelial malignant tumors was previously evaluated only in limited case series.   Our aim was to 
comprehensively analyze HIK1083 immunohistochemical expression in a large cohort of ovarian epithelial malignant tumors. As a 
secondary objective, we examined HIK1083 expression in metastasis to the ovary from colonic and appendiceal primaries.   
Design: Tissue microarrays consisting of two 2mm tissue cores of each of the ovarian epithelial malignant tumors including high 
grade serous (HGSC), low grade serous (LGSC), high grade endometrioid (HGEC), low-grade endometrioid (LGEC), clear cell 
(CCC), mucinous (MC) carcinomas, as well as appendiceal/colonic metastatic carcinomas secondarily involving the ovary were 
stained for HIK1083.  Cytoplasmic staining intensity (weak, moderate, strong) and percentage of tumor cells staining was 
recorded.  Any staining in ≥1% of cells was considered positive.    
Results: A total of 699 primary ovarian epithelial malignant tumors including 434 HGSC, 34 LGSC, 55 HGEC, 43 LGEC, 89 CCC, 
36 MC, and 8 carcinosarcoma and 91 metastatic carcinomas to the ovary (47 colonic and 44 appendiceal) were evaluated. Overall 
3/699 (0.4%) of primary ovarian cases and none of the metastatic cases demonstrated HIK103 expression.  There were only 3 
positive cases, all in the primary mucinous carcinoma category (3 of 36, 8%).  All three cases exhibited strong apical and focal 
cytoplasmic staining in 5, 40, and 70% of the cells, respectively.  All three of these cases had tumor limited to the ovary (T1a 
 
  
 
S957 
stage); two patients had hysterectomy demonstrating benign cervix and one patient had been followed for 9 years with no evidence 
of cervical cancer.   
Conclusions: HIK1083 is rarely expressed in primary ovarian epithelial malignancies (only 0.4% of the overall cases, limited to 
mucinous carcinomas).  However, 8% of primary mucinous carcinomas in our cohort showed HIK1083 expression.  Therefore, 
even though HIK1083 expression is highly correlated with gastric-type cervical carcinoma in the literature, in the work up of 
carcinoma involving the ovary, our results show that it is not an unequivocal marker of metastatic carcinoma with gastric-type 
differentiation.

Background: The classification of the neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) has undergone a monumental change for ease of 
applicability and site-agnostic uniformity of terminology. Thus, the present classification, based on Pancreatic NEN, classifies NENs 
of cervix as neuroendocrine tumors (NET; G1,2 or 3), neuroendocrine carcinomas, NECs (Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, 
SCNEC and Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, LCNEC), and mixed neuroendocrine non-neuroendocrine carcinomas 
(MiNENs). 
Design: A retrospective observational study with a detailed review of clinical and histological parameters of Cervix NEN cases 
diagnosed from Jan 2018 till date (55 months) was undertaken. 
Results: A cohort of 40 women, mean age of 51.1years, were diagnosed with NET/NEC. Bleeding per vaginum was the most 
common symptom. On imaging, tumor size ranged from 2.5-13 cm (mean size: 6.15cm) with lower uterine segment, vaginal and 
parametrial involvement in 58.1%, 61.8%, and 81.25% respectively. On histopathology, 50% were SCNEC, 25% LCNEC, NET G3 
in 5%(2/40), mixed carcinomas in 17.5% (7/40), and MiNEN in 2.5%(1/40) cases. Of the mixed carcinomas, 5 were mixed (not 
separate) adenocarcinoma and NEC, and 2 were mixed SCNEC and LCNEC. Lymphoepithelial histology was seen in 2 LCNEC, a 
hitherto unreported finding. Necrosis (90%) and mitoses>10/10hpf (100%)were frequent findings. On immunohistochemistry (IHC), 
all (100%) cases were positive for keratins, 92.1% for synaptophysin, 91.7% for INSM1, 80% for chromogranin, and 72.7% for p16. 
NKX2.2 was positive in both the cases tested. Ki-67 positivity ranged from 35-90% tumor cells. Only 15.1% were FIGO stage 1. 
Lymph node and distant metastases (DM) were seen in 65.2% and 60.9% cases; lung (57.1%) being the most common site. 
Trimodality therapy with curative intent was completed in 4, 2 of whom developed recurrences within 6 months of therapy 
completion.

Conclusions: NENs in cervix are uncommon; a vast majority comprising of NECs. NETs, though described are exceedingly rare, 
are almost always NET, G3 in type; either pure or mixed with NECs. Majority of the mixed carcinomas are characterized by an 
admixture of the various areas, thus defying the rules of classification as MiNEN in the current classification system. A panel of 
immunohistochemical markers are required for diagnoses. LCNEC is frequently misdiagnosed due to variant histologies. Despite 
multimodality treatment, the outcomes are uniformly dismal, necessitating a larger, multicentric evaluation of NENs of the cervix.

Background: Uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) is a rare, aggressive tumor, comprising only 3% of uterine corpus malignancies. 
According to the current WHO classification, these tumors are further subdivided into epithelioid (eLMS), myxoid (mLMS) and 
spindle (sLMS) subtypes, based entirely on morphologic criteria. Due to their rarity, the molecular underpinnings of eLMS and 
mLMS are almost entirely unknown. The goal of this project was to identify molecular similarities and differences at the RNA and 
protein level, in order to identify potential biomarkers that could aid in diagnosis. 
Design: Fresh frozen samples of normal myometrium (MM) and uLMS subtypes (31 MM, 17 sLMS, 3 eLMS, and 1 mLMS) 
underwent RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis. Expression values were calculated as Transcripts Per Million (TPM) using 
scater (R package). Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were analyzed with Qiagen Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. 
Proteomics analysis was performed using Proteome Discoverer and MSstatsTMT (R package).  
Results: Transcriptomic analysis revealed a shared role for the Kinetochore Metaphase Signaling pathway, as well as upregulation 
of amphiregulin (AREG) in all uLMS subtypes. Amphiregulin (AREG) is an upstream regulator of the EGFR pathway overexpressed 
in advanced gynecological malignancies. Transcriptomic analysis further revealed that sLMS and eLMS were more similar to each 
other than mLMS. Furthermore, NF Kappa Beta presented as a common upregulated pathway for the sLMS and eLMS and PI3 
 
  
 
S959 
Kinase pathway was upregulated in the mLMS. Distinct, putative, diagnostic biomarkers were identified for each uLMS subtypes (p-
values < 0.01). For eLMS, S1007A1 (log2FC: 12.0) and HOXB13 (log2FC: 12.6); for sLMS, ANKRD1(log2FC: 11.2) 
and PAX6 (log2FC: 11.3); and for mLMS, SCUBE1 (log2FC: 8.2) and IGFN1 (log2FC: 7.0) were identified.  Proteomics analysis 
directly supports the SCUBE1 RNA-seq mLMS findings. 
Conclusions: These results are the first transcriptomic analysis of eLMS and mLMS, and serve to identify biomarkers between 
and within uLMS subtypes. AREG inhibitors have been studied for treatment of endometrial and ovarian malignancies, and may 
have a role in uLMS therapy, independent of subtype. The identification of candidate biomarkers may help with diagnosis of these 
tumors. Future studies will utilize these candidate biomarkers in development of immunohistochemical assays. 
 
952    4-Gene Circulating Tumor Panel as a Potential Pre-operative Identification of Uterine 
Leiomyosarcoma

Background: Uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS) has a dismal prognosis and is nearly always unsuspected prior to resection for 
presumed leiomyoma (LM). Occult LMS is reported in 0.2% (1 in 500) women having surgery for fibroids. The major problem is that 
there is no reliable preoperative method to distinguish LMS from a LM or STUMP (smooth muscle tumor of uncertain malignant 
potential), and patient prognosis for LMS is even poorer if the tumor is transected, which occurs in procedures performed for LM. 
Our prior study demonstrated the feasibility of testing preoperative blood and identifying pathogenic variants of TP53 and matching 
those with LMS samples. TP53 alterations are reportedly associated with uterine LMS in 60-80% of cases, thus, the addition of a 
small set of genes would be required to increase sensitivity of testing while also increasing specificity by ruling out low level 
pathogenic TP53 due to other conditions such as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential. 
Design: We previously evaluated TP53 circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in both plasma and 
formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. We screened plasma for TP53 variants with pathologically confirmed LMS. FFPE samples 
were matched with plasma samples taken before surgery (when available). A retrospective analysis of LMS tissue was performed 
in our case list (n=13) and compared to LMS in COSMIC (n=254) and uterine LMS in TCGA (n=71) to identify a small panel that to 
potentially increase accurate detection of LMS by ctDNA. 
Results: Most commonly co-mutated genes with TP53 are ATRX, RB1, and MED12, and while some cases overlap, these create 
three district subclasses or TP53-mutated LMS. When no TP53 was identified, ATRX and RB1 loss were the second and third most 
common alteration, respectively. The addition of ATRX, RB1, and MED12 would potentially increase the number of LMS detected 
by 20-40% and increase sensitivity to 80-90%. The detection of copy number loss would increase total cases by approximately 5-
8%, although this can be technically demanding. 
Conclusions: While detection of pathogenic TP53 variants by ctDNA is feasible, a panel including TP53, ATRX, RB1 and MED12 
could potentially increase the sensitivity from 60-80% to over 90%. MED12 alterations are commonly identified in benign LM, but 
coupled with TP53, combinations of the 4 target genes would greatly reduce the potential for a TP53-associated lowl-level CHIP, 
which was a potential confounder for a single gene screening test.

Background: Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) is an aggressive uterine carcinoma with few treatment options. Clinical trial results 
have demonstrated USC with HER2 overexpression/amplification may benefit from HER2-targeted therapy. However, there is no 
formal HER2 testing guidelines in USC. Few studies have evaluated USC HER2 gene amplification by in-situ hybridization (FISH), 
but they were limited to those cases with HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) 2+/3+. In this study, we compared the performance of 
two FDA-approved HER2 IHC stains, DAKO HercepTest and Ventana 4B5 clones and their correlation with Fluorescent ISH (FISH) 
for detection of HER2 gene amplification in USC. 
 
  
 
S960 
Design: Forty cases of USC were selected including 25 pure USC, 10 mixed tumors and 5 carcinosarcomas with a serous 
epithelial component.  The cases were stained for DAKO HercepTest and Ventana 4B5 clones. HER2 IHC stained sections were 
interpreted based on the USC testing algorithm proposed by Buza et al., and the interpretation received consensus by 8 
subspecialized breast and gynecological pathologists.  HER2 FISH was performed in all cases by HER2 IQFISH 
pharmDxTM (DAKO) and were interpreted using 2018 HER2 testing guidelines in breast cancers. 
Results: The correlation between IHC testing and FISH is illustrated in Table 1. All HER2 3+ positive cases with HercepTest and 
4B5 were amplified by FISH. Interestingly, in HER2 IHC 0-1+ cases, 1 of 22 HER2 (5%) by HercepTest and 3 of 26 (11.5%) by 4B5 
showed amplified FISH results. HER2 4B5 and HercepTest had great specificity (both 100%). The sensitivity for HercepTest and 
4B5 were 64% and 40% by using the cut-off of IHC 3+, and 90% and 70% by using the cut-off IHC 2+. The overall agreement 
between HercepTest and 4B5 was moderate with weighted Kappa=0.418. 
 
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first to compare the performance of the two most commonly-used HER2 IHC 
methods to HER2 gene amplification by FISH. Both HercepTest and 4B5 HER2 IHC had 100% specificity for detecting HER2 gene 
amplification in USC, while HercepTest has superior sensitivity. Therapeutic targeting of HER2 is among the most significant 
advancements in this disease in decades, specifically for patients with HER2 positive advanced stage and recurrent USC. Our 
findings contribute to the knowledge of HER2 testing methodologies in USC and may aid in developing guidelines for selecting 
suitable patients for HER2-targeted therapy in USC.

Background: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis has aided in the classification of neoplasms such as those of the central 
nervous system. In the uterus, it has been shown that benign and malignant mesenchymal tumors cluster in distinct methylation 
signatures. It is unknown whether the same applies to vulvovaginal mesenchymal neoplasms, a diverse group that includes 
indolent, locally aggressive, and malignant entities, which are often difficult to classify using conventional histomorphology and 
immunohistochemistry. 
Design: Primary vulvar and vaginal mesenchymal lesions were collected from 4 institutions. DNA was extracted from archival 
formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue, and analyzed using next generation sequencing of the methylome. Overall, there were 
668,000 markers with more than 10X coverage across all samples. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using t-distributed 
stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) dimensionality reduction was performed on the top 1,000 markers with the highest median 
absolute deviation across beta values. 
Results: Of 49 samples, copy number analysis was successful in 47. Methylation analysis was carried in the top 34 samples with 
coverage of CpG sites above 10. Based on rendered pathologic diagnoses, the methylation cohort included fibroepithelial stromal 
polyp (FESP, n=13), angiomyofibroblastoma (AMFB, n=5), cellular angiofibroma (CEAF, n=4), superficial angiomyxoma (SAMX, 
n=1), deep angiomyxoma (DAMX, n=8), prepubertal vulvar fibroma (PPVF, n=1), smooth muscle tumor (SMT, n=1) and 
dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP, n=1). t-NSE analysis (Fig 1) revealed two major distinct clusters: one including most 
FESPs and a second including most DAMX, both with a few outliers including CEAF and AMFB. Most AMFB, however, grouped 
centrally in a separate cluster, close to a second FESP cluster (with one DAMX outlier) and a cluster with two CEAF as well as 
FESP, SAMX, PPVF and DFSP. Most cases had no detectable copy number changes, except 3/3 SMT (1p loss, among others) 
and 2/2 DFSP (17q gain). 
 
  
 
S961 
Figure 1 - 954 
 
Conclusions: Certain types of vulvovaginal mesenchymal neoplasia, including frequent lesions such as FESP and clinically 
relevant tumors like DAMX, have unique DNA methylation signatures compared to other primary lesions in this location. More 
infrequent lesions such as AMFB and CEAF also appear to have discrete methylation profiles. The presence of outliers in each 
methylation cluster may represent morphologic misclassification or molecular heterogeneity in these groups of lesions. 
 
955    Placenta Accreta Spectrum Disorder: Review of Risk Factors, Pathology in Former Gestations 
and Associated Placental and Uterine Pathology in Hysterectomy

Disclosures: Grace Neville: None; Carlos Parra-Herran: None 
Background: Placenta accreta spectrum disorders (PAS) are increasing in incidence and are associated with significant maternal 
and fetal morbidity and mortality. They are typically seen in the setting of previous cesarean section (CS); however, not all cases 
have such antecedent. We report the associated placental and uterine pathology seen in a cohort of 62 gravid hysterectomy 
specimens with confirmed PAS. 
Design: Cases of gravid hysterectomy for PAS at a single referral institution were reviewed. Demographic details, prior and 
metachronous pathology findings were documented. 
Results: The cohort had a mean age of 36 (range 29–47) years and mean gestation at delivery of 35.3 (range 23.6–39.4) 
weeks. Prior history of CS was documented in 47 patients (76%). 34 patients had other forms of uterine instrumentation. 
Remarkably, 15 patients (24%) lacked history of prior CS; of these, 14 had other forms of uterine instrumentation. One patient had 
history of neither CS or uterine instrumentation. In 18 patients, 19 placentas from previous gestations were available. Among these, 
8/18 (44%) had BPMF, disrupted parenchyma and/or RPOC in previous pregnancies (Table 1). Examination of the gravid 
hysterectomy specimen revealed leiomyomata in 9 cases (14%), adenomyosis in 6 (10%) and chronic endometritis in one (1.5%). 
Most placentas in the index (PAS) gestation were morphologically normal (n=30, 48.4%). However, a subset of patients had 
diverse placental lesions. Evidence of maternal vascular malperfusion included infarcts (n=11), retroplacental hemorrhage (n=6) 
and decidual arteriopathy (n=1). 
 
  
 
S962 
Villitis of unknown etiology (n=3), chorioamnionitis (n=1), chorangiosis (n=2) and intervillous thrombi (n=16) were also seen. 
Cord abnormalities including velamentous (n=1), membranous (n=1), vas previa (n=1) and a single umbilical artery were observed.

Conclusions: In this large institutional cohort, previous CS is seen most patients with PAS. However, a quarter of patients lack 
such antecedent, and careful review of the clinical history is needed to identify other forms of uterine instrumentation that can lead 
to deficient decidua and PAS pathogenesis. Equally important is the review of pathology in placentas from former gestations, since 
44% show findings alerting to the possibility of previous PAS, not only BPMF but also disrupted parenchyma and RPOC. The 
breath of pathologic conditions seen is reflective of the older and more medically complex cohort in which this condition typically 
occurs.   
 
956    Polarization of Endothelial and Epithelial Cell States Predicts Recurrence in Endometrial 
Endometrioid Carcinoma

Disclosures: Corrine Nief: None; Phoebe Hammer: None; Aihui Wang: None; Andrew Gentles: None; Brooke Howitt: None 
Background: Endometrial endometrioid carcinomas (EEC) are the 4th most common cancer in females and the most common 
gynecologic malignancy in developed countries. EEC has 5-year survival rate of 95%; however, there is a population of patients 
that have aggressive disease. Accurate prognostic markers for EEC could inform treatment of high-risk patients while reducing 
overtreatment of low-risk patients. 
Design: The machine learning framework “EcoTyper” was used to identify patterns of cell state co-occurrences in 117 EECs to 
classify low- and high-risk EEC patients based on bulk RNA gene expression data. Targeted DNA (exonic regions of 648 genes) 
and whole transcriptomic RNA sequencing was performed on a cohort of EECs that recurred less than 5 years after resection 
(n=50) and EECs that did not recur (n=67) as a control group. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecular subgroups were 
established based on DNA sequencing. CIBERSORTx was used to deconvolve cell fractions from a previously validated carcinoma 
signature matrix. Cellular ecotypes (CEs) were identified from co-associated cell states with distinct expression profiles. 
Results: All 117 samples were blinded to search for cell states present and significant CEs. Of the four CEs identified (CE1, CE2, 
CE3, CE4), only CE3 and CE4 demonstrated significantly different expression between the case and control group (Table 1). 
Samples 15% more abundant in CE3 than CE4 were designated as “CE3 high”, and vice versa. CE3 and CE4 were made of 
unique endothelial and epithelial cell states (Figure 1). CE3 was correlated with recurrence, abnormal CTNNB1 staining, and low 
grade. CE4 was correlated with no recurrence and high grade. There was no association with ecotype and age, race, ethnicity, 
LVSI status, or molecular subtype. The CE3 ecosystem has high levels of immunosuppressive genes (CCR7, CD200, EGFL8) with 
constituents from the NF-κB (FKBP4, RNF25), RAS (RAB31), and Hedgehog (STK36) pathways as well as several genes 
implicated in chemotherapy resistance (IFI16, SLC31A2, EIF3G). Conversely, the CE4 ecotype has high levels genes associated 
with tumor suppression (EAF2, NOL7, AL358852.1), apoptosis (APOPT1, BNIP3), PD1 pathway (PDCD1), and DNA repair 
mechanisms (ORC6, DDI2).

Conclusions: We identified two ecotypes that correlate with EEC prognosis, with CE3 (endothelial cell immunosuppression,

lower rates of recurrence. 
 
957    Morphological Features are Neither Sensitive Nor Specific for the Diagnosis of Fumarate 
Hydratase Deficient Leiomyoma: A Clinicopathologic Study of 99 Uterine Leiomyomas with 
Atypical Nuclei

Medicine, New Haven, CT 
Disclosures: Na Niu: None; Natalia Buza: None; Pei Hui: None; Tong Sun: None 
Background: Atypical nuclei can be seen in leiomyoma with bizarre nuclei (LBN), fumarate hydratase (FH) deficient leiomyoma, 
and leiomyosarcoma. Distinguishing between these entities is critical for clinical management. Though certain morphological 
features have been proposed for identifying FH deficient leiomyoma, including prominent eosinophilic nucleoli with perinucleolar 
halo, cytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions, staghorn vessels, and alveolar type edema, the sensitivity, and specificity of these 
features have not been fully validated in large cohorts. 
Design: Total 112 hysterectomy or myomectomy specimens from 99 women with diagnoses of “atypical leiomyoma”, “symplastic 
leiomyoma” or “leiomyoma with bizarre nuclei” from our institutional pathology archives during 2000 to 2021 were reviewed. Clinical 
history and a median of 56 months of clinical and pathological follow-up were obtained. FH immunohistochemistry was performed 
on selected sections in 60 cases with available tissue blocks. Comparing clinical and pathomorphological features were made 
between FH deficient leiomyoma and leiomyoma with bizarre nuclei. 
 
  
 
S964 
Results: Two cases with increased mitotic figures (>5/10HFP) and/or ki-67 (>10%) were diagnosed as leiomyosarcoma during 
clinical follow-up and excluded from further analysis. A total of 24 leiomyomas (40%) demonstrated FH expression loss. Patients 
with FH deficient leiomyoma tended to be younger (mean age: 45 years vs. 50 years) and had larger tumors (mean size: 7.4 cm vs. 
5.6 cm), although the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). FH deficient leiomyomas were also more likely to have 
diffuse, high-density bizarre cell distribution, nuclear pseudoinclusions, cytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions, staghorn vessels, or 
alveolar type edema (Table 1). However, these previously reported features can also be seen in non-FH deficient leiomyomas, and 
none of them are sensitive or specific (p > 0.05)

Conclusions: FH deficient leiomyoma is an important clue for identifying patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell 
cancer (HLRCC) syndrome. Our data showed that FH-deficiency is relatively prevalent in leiomyomas with nuclei atypia.  Reported 
morphologic features of FH deficient leiomyoma are neither sensitive nor specific. Younger age and larger leiomyomas are 
associated with a higher possibility of FH deficient leiomyomas, although the difference can be subtle. In routine practice, the 
threshold for performing FH IHC in leiomyomas with atypical nuclei should be low

Background: Epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT) is the rarest form of gestational trophoblastic neoplasms with histological 
presentations frequently simulating a somatic carcinoma. While ETT primarily arises from the uterus, cases have been documented 
to occur at extrauterine sites including the fallopian tube, ovary, and broad ligament in association with ectopic pregnancy, or as 
metastatic tumors to various organs. Moreover, somatic carcinomas may show trophoblastic differentiation histologically and 
immunohistochemically simulating ETT. Thus, a precise diagnosis of an extrauterine tumor with epithelioid trophoblastic cell 
differentiation of either gestational or somatic origin is highly relevant and crucial for patient management and prognosis. 
Design: We present four challenging epithelioid tumors that had various initial interpretations with ETT as the main differential 
diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry and STR genotyping of tumor samples were performed. 
Results: Patients’ ages ranged from 38 to 65 years. All four cases presented as extrauterine lesions (Table 1) and showed 
overlapping histologic and immunohistochemical features between somatic carcinoma and ETT (Figures 1 and 2). Serum hCG 
elevation was documented in one patient (case #3, 1,800 mIU/ml).  Surgical excision of the tumor was performed in two patients 
(#2 and #4), and core biopsy was performed in two cases (#3 and #4). Clinical and imaging studies were inconclusive in all four 
cases.  One patient (case #3) received chemotherapy without response as a result of the initial diagnosis of ETT. STR genotyping 
was informative in all cases. Matching genetic profile with the patient’s normal tissues was seen in two tumors (both initially 
considered as ETT), confirming that they were somatic carcinomas with trophoblastic differentiation (case #3 metastatic triple 
negative breast carcinoma and case #4 lung primary carcinoma). Another two cases, initially suspected as somatic carcinoma 
(case #1) and mixed trophoblastic tumor (case #2), demonstrated distinct paternal alleles (not present in the patient’s normal 
tissues) at multiple STR loci in the tumor, confirming the diagnosis of ETT in both cases (Table 1).

Conclusions: Diagnostic separation of ETT presenting at an extrauterine site from somatic carcinoma is frequently difficult at the 
histological and immunohistochemical levels. STR genotyping is a robust ancillary tool that precisely separates ETT from a somatic 
carcinoma with trophoblastic differentiation.

Background: Ovarian cancer (OC) is the second most common gynecological malignancy among Nigerian women after cervical 
cancer. A precise histopathologic diagnosis can be extremely challenging in low resource countries where ancillary tools such as 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and molecular techniques are not widely available. The massive exodus of specialists due to 
insecurity, poor infrastructure and low remuneration has further overstretched the few available anatomic pathologists. The 
objective of this initiative was to evaluate a large cohort of OC tumor from Nigeria to assess for tumor histology and estimated 
diagnostic accuracy, with the aim of identifying opportunities to improve OC diagnosis.  
Design: FFPE tissue blocks of OC samples from 3 consecutive years (2017-2019) were obtained from 19 tertiary health institutions 
in the 6 geo-political regions of Nigeria. Whole-tissue sections were prepared and reviewed by two pathologists in the United 
States. Mislabeled, extremely poorly fixed tissue and repeated blocks were excluded from further processing. Selected IHC stains 
were performed on a subset of cases in which morphologic features were not diagnostic. Tumors were classified as having a 
“change in diagnosis” when there was any discrepancy regarding histologic subtype, site of origin (primary vs. metastasis) or 
biologic behavior (malignant to benign) between the original and revised diagnoses. 
Results: 282 cases met the inclusion criteria, 90 of which (31.9%) required IHC for final diagnosis. For 231 cases (81.9%), the 
original pathologic diagnosis was made available. A change in diagnosis occurred in 104/231 (45%), mostly due to erroneous 
assignment of primary site (49/104, 47.1%), followed by incorrect histologic type (29/104, 27.8%), overdiagnosis of malignancy 
(16/104, 15.3%) and wrong line of differentiation (10/104, 9.6%). When accounting for the 163 reclassified primary malignant 
cases, most tumors were of epithelial origin (101/163 [61.9%], predominantly HGSC [65/101; 64.3%]). Tumors in the sex cord-
stromal category were 41/163 (25.1%), followed by 21/163 (12.8%) germ cell malignancies.   
Conclusions: OC in Nigerian women differs from the US population by demonstrating less incidence of HGSC and higher 
frequency of malignant sex cord-stromal tumors. The utilization of secondary histopathological review paired with ancillary studies 
from a subspecialized center can markedly improve diagnostic accuracy, with potential change in patient’s management.

Background: Uterine leiomyoma (LM) is the most common gynecologic tumor while its malignant counterpart, leiomyosarcoma 
(LMS) is rare. They typically harbor distinct molecular profiles, LM being characterized by MED12, FH, or HMGA2, and LMS 
by TP53, RB1, ATRX, and PTEN alterations as well as complex genomic architecture. Although rare LMS arising from LM have 
been reported, no comprehensive molecular study analyzing each component has been undertaken. 
Design: We macrodissected LM and LMS components from 11 tumors and performed next-generation sequencing on a 1004-gene 
panel. 
Results: Patients ranged from 38 to 79 (mean 55) years. Tumors ranged from 8.5 to 20 (mean 13) cm. Ten patients had stage I 
tumors and 1 stage III with peritoneal disease. Follow-up was available for 7; 3 alive and well, 3 dead of disease, and 1 dead from 
unrelated causes. The LM was conventional in 5, with bizarre nuclei (BN) in 4, both conventional and BN in 1, and a lipoleiomyoma 
in 1. Nine LMS were spindled, 1 myxoid, and 1 had both. None tested (n=6) showed HMGA2 overexpression by 
immunohistochemistry. Cases 1-2 harbored MED12 mutations in both components, with LMS acquiring TP53 or CDKN2A 
alterations (Figure). Cases 3-5 lacked alterations in LM, but LMS harbored TP53 mutations, with concurrent RB1 in 2. In cases 6-9, 
near identical alterations in both LMBN and LMS were present, involving TP53 (3 of 4) and RB1 (3 of 3). Case 7 also had a 
conventional LM area that lacked the TP53 mutation seen in the LMBN and LMS but shared the RB1 and SLX4 mutations. Cases 
10-11 did not show significant gene level alterations in either component. Overall, MED12 mutations were present in 2 conventional 
LMs and all 4 TP53-altered LMs had BN. Both alterations were shared with LMS, except case 9 where the LMS lacked 
the TP53 mutation. Evaluation of chromosome arm level copy number alterations (CNA) in 10 tumors revealed 7 LMS (including 
cases 10-11) to have more CNAs than LM (5 conventional, 2 LMBN), were comparable in 2 LMS arising from LMBNs, while 1 LMS 
had more CNAs than the conventional LM but similar to the LMBN. 
 
  
 
S968 
Figure 1 - 960 
 
Conclusions: This is the first comprehensive genomic study showing shared clonal origin between LM and LMS, particularly in the 
setting of MED12-mutated LM and TP53-altered LMBN. Although it has been previously suggested that LMS represents an 
independent tumor both at clinical and genomic levels, there appears to be a subset of LM and LMS that are spatially and 
molecularly related.

Background: Gastric-type endocervical adenocarcinoma (GAS) is well known for its aggressive clinical behavior and the absence 
of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), but gross and microscopic findings of ovarian metastasis from GAS has not been well 
described. We report 15 such cases to describe their gross and microscopic characteristics. 
Design: We describe gross and microscopic characteristics of 15 GAS metastasized to the ovary.  
Results: The ovarian tumors ranged from 1.5cm to 37cm in greatest dimension (average,13.5cm). Nine cases involved unilateral 
ovary (6 right, and 3 left), and six were bilateral. Grossly, seven of 15 ovarian tumors formed unilocular or oligolocular cysts with 
thin septae with a smooth external surface, which resembled benign cystic lesions of the ovary. Four cases were mostly composed 
of solid and firm masses and the remaining four had cystic mass with thick septae and ragged ovarian surface adhesion. 
Microscopically, grossly benign-appearing masses were lined by single-layered mucinous epithelium, but with significant cytologic 
atypia at higher magnification, which resembled pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastasized to the ovary. Signet ring cells were 
identified in 6 cases, and papillary features in 8 cases. 
Conclusions: It should be kept in mind that histologic features of metastatic GAS to the ovary share common features with 
metastatic carcinoma of pancreatic origin and often resembled primary benign or borderline mucinous neoplasms of the ovary, and 
it could commonly be misdiagnosed as such by radiologic findings.

Background: RT is a fundamental component of vulvar SCCA treatment. There has been growing appreciation on the potential of 
synchronizing RT and immune checkpoint (IC) inhibitors for greater treatment efficacy. We aimed to study the post-RT prognostic 
significance of IC molecules in vulvar SCCA, which has remained largely undefined. 
Design: Immunohistochemical expression of TIM-3, PD-L1, Gal-9, MHC class I (MHCI), and extent of CD8+ tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs) were evaluated in 90 vulvectomy specimens from patients who received RT. TIM-3, PD-L1 and Gal-9 
expression was assessed via Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) and Combined Positive Score (CPS). Cross-sectional analyses were 
performed with Fisher’s exact tests. Post-RT overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were examined via log-rank 
tests and Cox proportional regression models with adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Results: Median age was 70 years. Over half were of FIGO stage 3 or 4 disease, with 43% being p16+ and 22% having lymph 
node metastases. TIM-3 TPS≥1, PDL-1 TPS≥1, and Gal-9 TPS≥1 status was seen in 65%, 52% and 52% of cases. TIM-3 CPS ≥5 
was observed in 68% of tumors, and was significantly correlated with larger (>2 cm) tumor size, high expression of PD-L1, Gal-9 
and MHCI, as well as extent of CD8+ TILs (Figure 1). No significant associations of PD-L1 or Gal-9 with characteristics other than 
MHCI expression or TIL density were seen. Most (62%) received RTs for adjuvant therapy, while others were treated for 
neoadjuvant (20%), definitive (12%), and palliative (6%) purposes. Median post-RT follow-up time was 26 months (range: 4-130 
months). TIM-3 CPS ≥5 and age≤60 years were correlated with improved post-RT OS and RFS, while p16+ status showed 
borderline associations (Figure 2). Only TIM-3 CPS≥5 independently predicted better post-RT OS after confounding adjustment. 
Statistically significant predictors for improved post-RT RFS included TIM-3 CPS ≥5 (aHR: 0.2; CI:0.1-0.5) and receipt of 
chemotherapy (aHR: 0.2; CI:0.1-0.7); while FIGO stage ≥3 (aHR: 3.0; CI:1.2-7.4) and age>60 years (aHR: 3.3; CI:1.2-9.0) 
predicted worse post-RT RFS after controlling for other tumor features. 
Figure 1 - 962 
 
 
  
 
S970 
Figure 2 - 962 
 
Conclusions: TIM-3 CPS≥5 is an independent indicator of improved post-RT prognosis and is expressed by a significant 
proportion of vulvar SCCA. The findings warrant further assessment of TIM-3 as an alternative IC therapeutic target in combination 
with RT in patients who attain only partial response to RT.

Background: Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) is a rare cancer. Two different pathways have been described for this 
cancer, one associated with human papillomavirus (HPV), and the other independent of HPV. Genomic landscape of VSCC 
remains poorly explored. 
Design: 64 VSCC with matched normal tissue underwent whole exome sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq6000. HPV testing and 
p16 immunohistochemistry were performed. Tumors with positive p16 and/or positivity for high-risk HPV were classified as HPV-
associated. 
Results: 12 VSCC (18.8%) were classified as HPV-associated and 52 (81.2%) as HPV-independent. HPV-associated VSCC 
showed predominantly TTN mutations (11/12; 92%), followed by OBSCN and MUC16 (8/12 each; 
67%), DCHS1, DNAH11, DNHD1, HMCN1, MDN1, RYR1 and UBR4 (6/12 each; 50%). HPV-independent VSCC showed 
frequently TP53 mutations (39/52; 75%), followed by TTN (32/52; 62%), OBSCN (28/52; 54%), PLEC (25/52; 
48%), FAT1 and MUC16 (22/52 each; 42%), HSPG2 (19; 37%), MACF1 (18; 35%), HECTD4 and RYR1 (17 each; 33%) 
Only TP53 mutations correlated strongly with HPV-negative status (p=0.015). The same top-10 pathways were identified in HPV-
associated and -independent VSCC but in different proportions (Figure 1 and 2, respectively). HPV-associated VSCC showed 
enrichment for RTK-RAS pathway (12; 100%), followed by WNT and NOTCH (10 each; 83%), Hippo and PI3K pathway (9 each; 
75%). HPV-independent VSCC showed involvement of NOTCH pathway (43; 83%), TP53 and Hippo (42 each; 81%), RTK-RAS 
and WNT (38 each; 73%). Mutational signatures were present in 61 out of 64 VSCC (95%). Two different patterns of mutations 
were inferred. Both patterns were enriched in C>T. The pattern 1 also showed an enrichment of C>A and C>G, and was more 
frequently associated with oncogenic activity of AID/APOBEC. The pattern 2 was related to defective DNA mismatch repair and 
microsatellite instability. The pattern 1 was identified in 49% of tumors (30/61), and pattern 2 in the remaining 51% (31/61). No 
association between the patterns and HPV status was identified (p=0.74 for each pattern). 
 
  
 
S971 
Figure 1 - 963 
 
Figure 2 - 963 
 
Conclusions: HPV-associated and HPV-independent VSCC are similar in the somatic mutation landscape, with the same top-10 
pathways involved in different degrees. Only TP53 mutations strongly correlated with HPV-independent status. At least half of the 
VSCC develop in association with defective DNA mismatch repair and microsatellite instability and other half in presence of 
AID/APOBEC oncogenic activity. 
 
964    Differences in Placental Pathologic Features by Trimester of Infection with SARS-CoV-2

Background: SARS-CoV-2 (SV2) infection is associated with maternal illness and adverse perinatal outcomes, including stillbirth 
and preterm birth. Placental pathologies such as increased perivillous fibrin deposition, fibrin thrombi, villitis, villous infarct, and 
chorangiosis have been described in infected mothers. However, a meta-analysis failed to show a significant association between 
SV2 infection and placental pathology. This study aims to describe placental histological findings following SV2 infection in 
pregnancy and examine the association between the trimester (TRI) of infection and placental pathology. 
Design: In this retrospective study, we included 314 pregnant women≥ 18 years old who tested positive for SV2 during their 
pregnancy, delivered after ≥ 14 weeks of gestation, and had their placenta sent for pathology examination. Cases were classified 
into first (1st), second (2nd), and third (3rd) TRI cohorts based on the gestational age at the time of infection. The 3rd TRI cohort 
was divided into infection ≤ 10 days and >10 days before delivery. Pathology reports were reviewed to collect placental findings. 
Placental lesions were categorized into acute inflammation (AI), chronic inflammation (CI), maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), 
fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM), and other significant pathology. AI, CI, MVM, and FVM were divided into none, low grade (LG), 
and high-grade (HG). Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare the prevalence of placental pathology by TRI of 
infection. 
Results: Among those who tested positive <37 weeks (at risk of preterm birth), 31.9% delivered preterm. There was no difference 
by TRI of infection (1st TRI: 32.5%; 2nd TRI: 28.4%; 3rd TRI: 34.5%; p-value=0.72). The prevalence of AI, CI, FVM, and MVM also 
did not differ by TRI of SV2 infection (see table). However, the prevalence of HG inflammatory and/or HG vascular placental 
pathology was most common in 1st TRI (27/40, 67.5%), followed by 2nd TRI (37/67, 55.2%), and 3rd TRI infection (82/207, 39.6%, 
 
  
 
S972 
p<0.01). In the 3rd TRI cohort, SV2 infection ≤ 10 days before delivery was associated with a higher prevalence of FVM compared 
to infection more remote from delivery (46/134, 34.3% vs. 14/73, 19.2%; p<0.02).

Background: Acute SARS-CoV-2 placentitis is the triad of chronic histiocytic intervillositis, massive perivillous fibrin deposition, 
and trophoblast necrosis.  Recovered COVID-19 infections show placental pathologic sequelae including maternal, and probably 
fetal, vascular malperfusion. As the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 placental pathology continues to evolve, we present a new 
pathology seen in two placentas with maternal infections during the Omicron wave. 
Design: Two cases of atypical placentitis in the setting of recovered maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection were reviewed at 
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in June and July 2022. Given the gross and histopathologic findings, we performed special 
stains for bacteria, fungi, AFB, and spirochetes as well as RNA in-situ hybridization for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, 
immunohistochemistry was performed for CMV and spirochetes, and a representative formalin fixed paraffin embedded block was 
sent from each case to the Infectious Diseases Pathology Branch of the CDC for more complete studies (Table 1). 
Results: Clinical histories were provided by the referring pathologists (Table 1). The timing of positive maternal SARS-CoV-2 
testing was remote from delivery and both tested negative at delivery. Both neonates were liveborn, not tested for SARS-CoV-2, 
and remain healthy. Placental pathology for each case showed multifocal “abscess”-like lesions with negative infectious workups, 
 
  
 
S973 
including for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1, Figure 1). The only documented infectious association for each patient, after evaluating history 
and an exhaustive infectious work up (Table 1), is the antepartum SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Table 1: Clinical histories provided by referring pathologists. Infectious work up with pan-negative results.

Figure 1 - 965 
 
Conclusions: We describe two placentas with unique and striking pathology associated with recovered gestational SARS-CoV-2 
infection. At this time, there are no apparent adverse neonatal outcomes. The absence of any positive result from the vast array of 
infectious studies performed (including SARS-CoV-2 RNA-ISH and IHC) suggest the cause of these abscess-like placental lesions 
may not be infectious. As this pathology is otherwise rare, and the two cases had only maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in common, 
we propose this pathology to be related to COVID-19 but not caused by direct placental SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Background: Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 (TRPS1) is a new sensitive and reportedly specific marker for carcinomas of 
breast origin, including triple negative tumors. We have observed in our practice a subset of cases of non-mammary carcinomas 
that stained positive for TRPS1, with higher frequency in cytology effusion samples with gynecologic malignancies. The goal of this 
study was to evaluate the expression of TRPS1 in a large cohort of Müllerian carcinomas. 
Design: 105 cases of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) gynecologic tumors were retrospectively retrieved from our 
surgical pathology archives.  Cases corresponded to tumors of tubo-ovarian (17 HGSC, 3 LGSC, 2 clear cell, 8 endometrioid), 
endometrial (25 endometrioid [16 low-grade, 9 high-grade], 8 serous, 6 clear cell, 12 carcinosarcoma, 1 dedifferentiated, 1 
mesonephric-like), cervical (6 SCC, 11 HPVA, 2 gastric-type) and vulvar (3 SCC) origins. Whole tissue sections were stained by 
TRPS1 IHC and slides were assessed for positivity (≥ 5% of nuclear labeling), distribution (focal: 5-49%, diffuse: 50-100%) and 
intensity (1+, 2+, 3+). Positive and negative controls were appropriately used. 
Results: Positive staining was observed in 54/ 105 (51.4%) tumors. Most tumors demonstrated diffuse labeling (64.8%), while focal 
in (35.2%). Among positive cases, immunoreactivity was mostly 1+ (57.4%), followed by 2+ (33.3%) and 3+ (9.2%). Tumors with 
high percentage of positive cases consisted of tubo-ovarian origin (70%), followed by endometrial origin (58.4%). All LGSC, 
cervical adenocarcinomas and vulvar carcinomas were negative. 
See Table 1. 
 
  
 
S975 
 
Figure 1 - 966 
 
Conclusions: Our results indicate that a significant subset (approximately half) of Müllerian carcinomas can be positive for TRPS1, 
in particular endometrial and tubo-ovarian malignancies. These findings should be considered when evaluating carcinomas of 
unknown origin, to avoid misclassification of the primary site.

967    Does the Presence of Plasma Cells in Infertility Evaluation Endometrial Biopsies Influence 
Clinical Fertility Outcomes?

Disclosures: Jason Scapa: None; Sean Lau: None 
Background: Chronic endometritis and the presence of plasma cells (PCs) on endometrial biopsy (EMB) has been implicated as a 
cause of poor reproductive outcomes. Criteria for the histopathologic diagnosis of chronic endometritis is not well defined. In the 
context of infertile patients, there is variability on how many PCs are considered clinically significant to constitute treatment with 
antibiotics. 
Design: Retrospective review of all EMBs in patients presenting for infertility evaluation at our institution accessioned from 
February to September 2021 was performed. Endometrial histomorphology and presence of PCs on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) 
stain slides and immunohistochemical stains for CD138 and MUM1 were assessed. Findings were correlated with clinical and 
treatment parameters, with clinical outcome follow-up data being available for at least one year after biopsy for all patients. 
Results: There were 93 EMBs from 86 unique patients presenting for infertility workup during the study period. Of the initial EMB 
cases, 47 (55%) showed the presence of at least one immunohistochemically confirmed PC per mm2, while 39 (45%) showed no 
PCs. Only 7 of the 47 cases (15%) with immunohistochemically confirmed PCs had the PCs readily identified on H&E stained 
material.  23 patients (49%) who had PCs on the initial biopsy had a viable pregnancy at time of follow-up versus 12 patients (30%) 
with no PCs on their initial biopsy having a subsequent pregnancy. 17 of the patients with at least one PC per mm2 received 
antibiotic treatment with 8 (47%) having a pregnancy at follow-up. This is compared to 15 of the 30 patients (50%) with PCs on 
biopsy but not receiving antibiotics having a pregnancy at follow-up. In the 27 cases with greater than five immunohistochemically 
confirmed PCs per mm2, 5 of the 13 patients (38%) who received antibiotics had a viable pregnancy at follow-up contrasted with 7 
of 14 (50%) in those not receiving antibiotics. Six patients had a “test of cure” follow-up biopsy for PCs after receiving antibiotics. 
Three of these patients (50%) had no PCs on repeat biopsy. 
Conclusions: In our practice setting, many patients with PCs on their EMB for infertility evaluation, even those who do not receive 
subsequent antibiotics, were able to have a viable pregnancy at follow-up. Thus, the clinical significance of PC counts and routine 
utilization of CD138 and MUM1 immunohistochemistry to facilitate identification of PCs in EMBs performed for the assessment of 
female infertility is controversial. 
 
968    Conventional Versus Alternative (FIGO) Methods for Depth of Invasion and Tumor Size 
Estimation in Vulvar Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Outcome-Based Validation Underscoring the 
Potential for Under-Staging

Background: Current staging of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VS) is complicated by shifting definitions. The 2021 FIGO 
staging changed the landmark for depth of invasion (DOI) measurement from the most superficial papillary plate (DOIp) to the 
closest rete peg (DOIr) (Fig 1). This shift was based on cohorts that showed no compromise in survival when reclassifying from 
stage IB to IA based on DOIr. Moreover, per AJCC staging, tumor size measurement should incorporate in situ disease (GS, 
conventional), and not solely the span of invasive disease (IS). Herein, we aim to evaluate the performance of these diverse 
metrics with respect to patient outcomes. 
Design: Primary resections for VS were identified retrospectively. DOIr, DOIp, GS and IS metrics were obtained after evaluation of 
all tumor-containing slides. Clinicopathologic data was collected from the chart. Primary endpoints were recurrence-free survival 
(RFS) and lymph node involvement (LNI) at time of resection. 
Results: A total of 79 cases were identified. Of these, 4 (5%) patients were staged IA per convention and 75 (95%) IB. Significant 
disparities were observed between average IS (13mm) and average GS (17mm, p*<0.006) and between average DOIr (4.5mm) 
and average DOIp (5.2mm, p*<0.0005) on paired t-tests. Clinicopathologic features are summarized in Table 1. Overall, 17 (22%) 
patients recurred after a median of 33 months. Fig 2 illustrates RFS for patients staged using conventional DOIp and alternative 
DOIr. While 100% of patients staged as IA by conventional DOIp measurement remain disease-free after resection, 3/12 (25%) that 
were ‘downstaged’ by DOIr measurement recurred after an average of 47 months.  Of the ‘downstaged’ 11 with follow-up, 8 are 
alive without disease, 1 is alive with disease, and 2 are deceased of unknown causes. Of the 65 patients who underwent groin 
dissection, 13 (20%) showed LNI (all of which were stage IB regardless of measurement used). Logistic regression demonstrated 
all of DOIp (p*=0.03), DOIr (p*=0.02), and GS (p*=0.049) to be significantly associated with LNI.

Conclusions: In contrast to prior studies, we document adverse events in patients downstaged from IB to IA using the new FIGO 
DOI method, a finding that merits study in large-scale, cross-institutional cohorts. Meanwhile, reporting DOIp is prudent for clinical 
management. While estimations of tumor size vary from AJCC recommendations (GS) when only the invasive span is measured 
(IS), their impact on outcome appears superseded by the DOI metric. 
 
969    Vascular Neoplasms of the Distal Female Genital Tract: A Clinicopathologic Analysis of 48 
Cases Illustrating Their Unusual and Diverse Presentations

Nucci: None 
Background: Scarce literature exists regarding the spectrum of vascular neoplasms of the vulvovaginal area. Herein, we describe 
the clinicopathologic features of a cohort of endothelial and myopericytic neoplasms of the vulva and vagina. 
Design: Benign, intermediate, and malignant vascular proliferations were identified retrospectively from in-house and consultation 
files at our institution. Clinicopathologic data was obtained from review of the chart and available histologic material. 
Results: A total of 49 cases were identified (Table 1). Lobular capillary hemangioma (LCH, n=35) presented with a symptomatic 
bleeding nodule, and - in contrast to extragenital sites - infrequently in association with ulceration (10/33, 30%), prior 
chemoradiation (1/35, 3%), or pregnancy (1/35, 3%). Myopericytic neoplasms encompassed myofibroma (MF, n=1), 
myopericytoma (MP, n=2), and glomus tumor (GT, n=1). These showed a spectrum of fasciculated spindle (MP, MF) to epithelioid 
cells (GT) with interspersed branching vasculature. All were positive for SMA (Fig 1). Kaposi sarcoma (KS, n=2) were of the 
enigmatic ‘sporadic’ form in elderly non-HIV females. KS and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KHE, n=1) both showed 
compressed vascular spaces resembling spindled fascicles, with up to moderate atypia and average mitoses 8/10 high-power 
fields. The single KHE presented at an older (rather than pediatric) age and was negative for HHV-8 by IHC; both KS were positive. 
 
  
 
S979 
The single pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma in an elderly female (rather than young male) showed bundles of myoid-
appearing cells in the superficial dermis with positivity for FOSB and AE1/3. Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE, n=4) had 
infiltrative borders, nests to cords of atypical epithelioid calls in variably well-developed chondromyxoid matrix (2/4, 50%) and 
CAMTA1 positivity (3/3, 100%). Epithelioid angiosarcoma (n=1) presented at the remarkably young age of 14 years and showed 
nodules of frankly anaplastic EMA and CD31-positive cells infiltrating through the deep dermis and subcutis (Fig 2).

Figure 2 - 969 
 
Conclusions: This series of 48 cases is the largest to characterize these rare vulvovaginal vascular tumors. While many 
morphologic features of vascular lesions at this site overlap with those of extragenital soft tissues, pathologists must be aware that 
these tumors may occur in the vulvovaginal area and display unconventional clinical profiles. As such, a broad differential for 
epithelioid and spindle cell neoplasms at this site is prudent.  
 
970    Vulvovaginal Vascular Malformations: A Clinicopathologic Analysis of 90 Cases Illustrating 
Their Diverse Morphologic Spectrum and Limited Risk of Recurrence

Background: Routine clinical surveillance of vulvovaginal tissues for squamous dysplasia can reveal tumefactive but non-
neoplastic vascular lesions that may be misconstrued as malignancy. Herein, we characterize a cohort of vascular malformations of 
the vulva and vagina to better understand their morphologic spectrum and risk of recurrence. 
Design: Vulvovaginal vascular malformations were identified retrospectively from in-house and consultation files at our institution. 
Clinicopathologic data was obtained from chart and slide review. 
Results: 90 cases from 85 patients were collected, including angiokeratoma (AK, n=53), lymphangioma circumscriptum (LC, n=8), 
hemangioma (HM, n=15), lymphangioma (LM, n=3), and ‘venous’ lake (VL, n=11). Mean patient age was 50 (range 22-85 years), 
with 80 cases in the vulva and 10 in the vagina (Table 1). None manifested syndromic stigmata, save for 2 LC patients with 
hidradenitis suppurativa. AK and LC showed epidermal interruption by ectatic, thrombosed superficial dermal capillaries and 
lymphatics. 5/56 (9%) were associated with prior pelvic radiation, 4/56 (7%) were incidentally discovered during pregnancy, and 
 
  
 
S981 
8/56 (14%) recurred after 0.4-13 years. In contrast, VL consisted of a single ectatic, thrombosed superficial dermal vessel lacking 
an epidermal response, with peripheral fibroblastic stromal reaction (Fig 1). None recurred or were associated with prior radiation or 
pregnancy. While criteria for distinction between benign vascular ‘neoplasm’ and ‘malformation’ are not well-established in 
otherwise nonspecific vascular proliferations, LM and HM were considered best classified as the latter, due to morphologic features 
including poorly defined, haphazardly arranged vascular channels in the deeper dermis with variable investment of medial smooth 
muscle and degrees of ectasia (Fig 2). These presented as large masses (up to 9.5 cm); 3/16 recurred after 1-23 years, and 1/16 
(6%) was associated with fatal Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon. Notably, features suggestive of endothelial malignancy (nuclear 
atypia, hobnailing, mitoses, bridging, multilayering), when present, were limited and interpreted as reactive within the 
clinicopathologic context.

Conclusions: This series of 92 cases is the largest to date characterizing non-neoplastic mass-forming vascular lesions of the 
vulvovaginal region. Recognition of clinical and morphologic hallmarks should aid in accurate diagnosis to limit overtreatment and 
stratify risk of recurrence.

971    PD-L1, IDO, and CD8 Expression in High-Grade Ovarian Carcinomas Treated with Checkpoint 
Inhibition: Current Barriers to Immunotherapeutic Response and Future Opportunities for 
Multimodal Therapy

Background: PD-1/PD-L1-based checkpoint inhibitor therapy has been utilized successfully in many solid tumors, including some 
gynecologic cancers. Responses in ovarian carcinoma, however, have been limited even in the context of PD-L1 
expression.  Indoleamine dioxygenase 2,3 (IDO) is a targetable immunosuppressive enzyme which may contribute to 
immunotherapeutic resistance, but which has not been studied in ovarian carcinomas treated with checkpoint inhibition.  Moreover, 
the relationship between overall cytotoxic T cell infiltration and immunotherapeutic response has not been well investigated in this 
setting. 
Design: PD-L1, IDO, and CD8 immunostaining was performed on pre-treatment whole tissue sections from 30 high-grade ovarian 
carcinoma patients, including 17 who received immunotherapy in the setting of platinum-resistant recurrence. PD-L1 and IDO were 
each given a Combined Positive Score (CPS), with a score of greater than 1 considered positive.  CD8-positive tumor-associated 
lymphocytes were manually enumerated and averaged across 10 high-power fields (HPF).  In patients who received 
immunotherapy, drug response was assessed using RECIST criteria and final response status at the time of last follow-up was 
recorded. 
Results: The tumors consisted of high-grade serous carcinomas (24), carcinosarcomas (2), clear cell carcinomas (2), small cell 
hypercalcemic-type carcinoma (1), and endometrioid carcinoma (1). PD-L1 and IDO were positive in 87% (26/30, CPS range 1-
100) and 77% (23/30, CPS Range 1-60) of tumors, respectively, with 81% (21/26) of PD-L1-positve cases co-expressing IDO. 
Tumors showed an average of 10 CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells per HPF (range: 1-58); 67% (20/30) had ?10 HPF, and there was 
no significant relationship between CD8 counts and IDO or PD-L1 expression. Only one of 17 patients who received 
immunotherapy in the setting of a platinum-resistant recurrence showed a partial response to the addition of immunotherapy; no 
tumors showed a complete response, and all 17 ultimately died of disease. 
Conclusions: The majority of high-grade ovarian carcinomas show IDO and PD-L1 co-expression with low (greater than 10 per 
HPF) levels of CD8-positve cytotoxic T cell infiltration.  Multimodal immunotherapeutic approaches that target IDO and enhance 
tumor lymphocytic recognition (such as radiotherapy or focused ultrasound treatment) may be of value in improving checkpoint 
inhibitor responses in this patient population. 
 
972    Fumarate-Hydratase Deficient Leiomyoma of the Uterine Corpus: Comparative Morphologic

Somaye Zare: None; Oluwole Fadare: None 
Background: Deficiency of fumarate hydratase (FH) protein expression in uterine corpus leiomyomas (uLM) may be attributable to 
either germline or somatic/epigenetic mutations of the FH gene, the former being definitional for the Hereditary leiomyomatosis and 
renal cell cancer (HLRCC) syndrome. We present our experience with FH-deficient (FH-d) leiomyomas, encompassing a period 
during which morphologic indicators that may suggest FH deficiency have become more widely applied in our group, and 
immunohistochemical analyses for FH expression in such tumors have become routine. 
Design: Reports for all uLM diagnosed during a 5 year period were reviewed. Cases had been designated for 
FH immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing based on the presence therein of one or more morphologic features suggestive of FH 
deficiency ("FH-like features": table 1), in accordance with published literature. For patients that had consented to FH germline 
testing subsequent to their pathologic diagnoses, the resultant reports were reviewed. Morphologic and other clinicopathologic 
features were compared between cases with and without pathogenic mutations in the FH gene. 
Results: From 2418 uLM that were diagnosed during the study period, 37 (1.5%) had been classified as displaying at least one 
"FH-like" morphological feature, and 29 (1.19%) had been classified as displaying such morphologic feature(s) and tested for FH 
expression by IHC. Compared to a control group of 370 uLM cases that were devoid of FH-like features, the 29 patients whose 
tumors showed FH like morphology were significantly younger (42 vs 47.86 years, p=0.009) and had substantially larger tumors 
 
  
 
S984 
(means 11.06 cm vs 6.37 cm, p<0.01). 14 (48.27%) of the 29 cases showed FH protein deficiency by IHC (FH-d). 12 of these 14 
patients elected to undergo germline testing; pathogenic FH mutations were present in 8 (66.67%) and were absent in 4 (33.33%). 
A comparison of morphologic features between the latter 2 groups is shown in table 1. 
Table 1: Comparison of Fumarate Hydratase-Deficient uLM with and without pathogenic FH mutations 
 
Conclusions: Our findings affirm that FH-d uLM with germline FH mutations are not morphologically distinguishable from FH-d 
uLM with somatic FH mutations. Although the former more frequently show alveolar-type edema and 
prominent eosinophilic/fibrillary cytoplasm, no single morphologic feature, or combination of features, was found to be 
completely specific in making this distinction. Morphology and FH IHC based screening of uLM does facilitate the identification of 
a very minute subset of patients that harbor germline FH mutations.

Background: Early-stage EMACA generally carries a favorable prognosis but recurrences have been seen in a subset of 
cases. TRPS1 was suggested as a candidate driver gene in EMACA and has been shown to have varying prognostic implications 
in breast and non-breast cancers. We evaluated the impact of TRPS1 protein expression on the prognosis of low-stage (FIGO I) 
EMACA focusing on grade 3 (G3) endometrioid adenocarcinoma. 
 
  
 
S985 
Design: TRPS1 immunohistochemical expression was examined in 184 hysterectomy specimens with FIGO stage I EMACA 
showing unequivocal G3 endometrioid histology. Cross-sectional analyses were tested with Fisher’s exact tests. Log-rank tests and 
Cox proportional regression models with adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to examine 
disease-specific survival (DSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). 
Results: Median age was 65 years. Over 50% were FIGO IA disease, with 29% showing aberrant p53 expression. Two patients 
had isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes at the time of surgery. Most (78%) received adjuvant radiation therapy (RT), and 29% 
received chemotherapy. A subset (8%) harbored strong TRPS1 expression in more than 75% of tumor cells (TRPS1-high) (Fig. 1A-
D). No statistically significant correlation was detected between TRPS1-high and other clinicopathologic features (Fig. 2). Median 
follow-up time was 35 months (up to 134 months). Deaths were reported in 33 women with 20 due to EMACA. Recurrences were 
seen in 30 women (distant: 22; local: 7; regional: 1). TRPS1-high was an independent poor distant RFS predictor (aHR: 4.4; CI: 
1.4-14.1) after confounding adjustment (Fig. 1E). TRPS1-high and p53-aberrant status were associated with worse 3-year RFS 
(Fig. 1F-G) but only abnormal p53 expression was an independent predictor (aHR: 1.6; CI: 1.1-2.5). RT predicted better 3 year-
RFS (Fig. 1H), improved long-term RFS (aHR: 0.4; CI: 0.1-0.9), and longer DSS (aHR: 0.1; CI: 0.04-0.5) in a multivariable model. 
No significant association was seen between TRPS1 expression, adjuvant chemotherapy, or other pathologic features with DSS or 
long-term RFS. 
Figure 1 - 973 
 
 
  
 
S986 
Figure 2 - 973 
 
Conclusions: TRPS1-high status was present in a non-trivial subset of early-stage G3 endometrioid EMACA and independently 
predicted distant RFS in patients after controlling for adjuvant therapy exposure and dosage as well as other clinicopathologic 
features. Findings warrant further molecular studies to examine the potential role of TRPS1 in modulating tumor biology and 
treatment responsiveness in early EMACA.

Background: Ovarian germ cell tumors (OGCTs) are heterogeneous neoplasms. OGCTs derive from primordial germ cells 
deviating from normal developmental path or primary oocytes that have escaped meiotic arrest. Rare mutation had been observed 
in OGCTs, while a high percentage of OGCTs are characterized by the appearance of isochromosome 12p [i(12p)] or 12p gain. 
Chromosome 12 abnormalities are genetic hallmarks in testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) of adolescents and adults. Little is 
known about these genetic changes in OGCTS. 
Design: Here we performed fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), using KRAS/CEN12 dual color probe DNA set of 
chromosome12, to interrogate the overrepresentation of 12p sequence of paraffin slides of 132 OGCTs, including 
32dysgerminomas, 31 immature teratomas, 51yolksac tumors, 13ovarian carcinoids and 5 somatic-type tumors arising from 
dermoid cyst. To compare with ovarian carcinoid, 16 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs)were also 
subjected to FISH. 
Results: All the dysgerminomas had abnormal 12 chromosome signal using KRAS/CEN12 dual color probe (Figure 1, Table 1). 
i12p was found in 78% of dysgerminomas (25/32) and was significantly higher than that of other OGCTs (P<0.01). Other 7 
dysgerminomas had KRAS amplification (3 cases) or 12 polysomy (4 cases). In primitive OGCTs, immature teratomas has 
significantly lower frequency (6/31, 19%) of i12p than dysgerminomas (25/32, 78%) and yolk sac tumors (25/51, 49%) (P<0.01), 
indicating their different initiating cells and pathogenic mechanisms. Notably, i12p was found in 49% of ovarian carcinoids (6/13), 
while no NENs had i12p. Furthermore, the proportions of 12p gain (KRAS amplification) of each OGCT histological subtype were 
 
  
 
S987 
similar (38-50%), as well as close to NENs (50%), indicating the KRAS amplification was a late and common molecular event in 
OGCTs.

Figure 1 - 974 
 
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that among the primitive OGCTs, immature teratomas have more stable genome than 
dysgerminomas and yolk sac tumors, indicating a divergent histogenesis pathway. Furthermore, i12p was firstly reported in ovarian 
carcinoids with a similar frequency of yolk sac tumor. Different from NENs, ovarian carcinoids have the same molecular genetic 
characteristics as germ cell tumors. The i12p was a more specific molecular event than KRAS amplification for OGCTs. 
Additionally, rare mutations were reported in OGCTs, KRAS amplification rather than mutation may contribute to the tumor 
progression.

Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules which function in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional 
regulation of gene expression. We analyzed the expression of miRNAs in endometrial carcinomas, measuring their expression 
 
  
 
S988 
between histological subtypes, molecular subtypes, in tumours with CTNNB1 mutations, and also correlated their expression with 
various prognostic factors. 
Design: 119 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer between 2008 and 
2018 were recruited. Tumours were subdivided into histological and molecular subtypes as defined by The Cancer Genome Atlas, 
and prognostic data was obtained from the pathology reports. The expression levels of 352 miRNAs were quantified using the 
panoramiR panel. 
Results: We identified differential expression of miRNAs between histological subtypes. For each miRNA, student’s t-test was 
performed between cases of one subtype, versus the other subtypes. Permutated p-values were obtained by shuffling the case and 
control labels and repeating the t-test 1000 times. Mir-449a, mir-449b-5p, and mir-449c-5p were the top three miRNAs showing 
increased expression in both endometrioid and de-differentiated carcinomas, but were not significantly increased in serous and 
clear cell carcinomas (permutated p-values <0.05). The miRNAs with the most increased expression in serous and clear cell 
carcinomas were miR-9-3p and miR-375 respectively (permutated p-values <0.05). We also identified 62 differentially expressed 
miRNAs amongst molecular subtypes. Using sequential forward selection, we built subtype classification models for some 
molecular subtypes of endometrial cancer, comprising 5 miRNAs for MMR-deficient tumours, 10 miRNAs for p53 mutated tumours, 
and 3 miRNAs for CTNNB1 mutated tumours, with area under curves of 0.75, 0.85, and 0.78 respectively. Correlating miRNAs with 
histological prognostic factors, we identified miRNAs which showed differential expression with the presence of lymphovascular 
invasion, lymph node metastasis, myometrial invasion, and cervical invasion. 
Conclusions: We have identified microRNAs that show differential expression between histological, molecular, and prognostic 
variables in endometrial carcinoma. These findings may potentially aid in the development of diagnostic and prognostic tools.

Disclosures: Basile Tessier-Cloutier: None; Clarissa Lam: None; Robert Soslow: None; Amir Momeni Boroujeni: None 
Background: Within the endometrial carcinoma (EC) molecular classification the NSMP/p53wt group is defined by the exclusion 
of POLE mutation, mismatch repair (MMR) protein loss and aberrant p53 protein expression. Unlike the other three molecular 
groups, NSMP/p53wt EC show a wide range of clinical outcome profiles from indolent to “serous-like”. As we lean further into the 
molecular classification for the diagnosis of EC, the NSMP/p53wt group should be better characterized clinically and molecularly. 
We set to study clinicopathological features of NSMP/p53wt EC with AKT1 mutations. 
Design: We searched a clinically annotated cohort for EC previously characterized by a targeted sequencing panel. We included 
EC NSMP/p53wt type with pathogenic mutations in AKT1. Morphological review was performed for each case. Finally, a statistical 
analysis was performed to correlate both molecular and clinicopathological features. 
Results: We identified 51 cases with pathogenic AKT1 mutation. The median age was 63-year-old with most tumors being low 
stage (90%) and low FIGO grade (94%). Sixteen cases (31%) developed lung metastasis, of which 10 (63%) had associated 
lymphovascular invasion (LVI) within the hysterectomy specimen (p<0.0001). Fraction of genome altered (FGA) and advanced 
FIGO stage were also correlated with lung metastases (p=0.008 and 0.012 respectively). Disease progression was associated with 
LVI (p=0.005), desmoplastic reaction (p=0.005), FGA (0.017) and depth of invasion (p=0.024). The co-existence 
of PTEN and AKT1 mutations were seen in 11 patients (22%), none of which died, and was associated with a higher rate of 
disease-free status compared to PTEN wild-type cases (82% vs. 40%, p=0.044). The other mutations co-occurring 
with AKT1 included CTNNB1 (69%), ARID1A (35%), MTOR (24%), PIK3CA (24%) and KRAS (14%). Forty-nine showed an 
endometrioid morphology (four showing mesonephric features), while the other two cases were diagnosed as mesonephric-like 
carcinosarcoma and high-grade endometrial carcinoma.

Figure 1 - 976 
 
Conclusions: AKT1 mutations in EC NSMP/p53wt type was associated with high rate of lung metastasis along with other poor 
prognostic factors. Interestingly the clinicopathological features were worst when the AKT1 mutation accompanied a wild-
type PTEN. Most had a conventional endometrioid appearance although rare cases showed mesonephric features. Our data 
support that NSMP/p53wt EC will benefit from clinically relevant molecular stratification to help guide management in these 
patients.

Background: Dedifferentiated ovarian carcinomas (DDOC), similar to their more common uterine corpus counterparts, are defined 
by the presence of an undifferentiated carcinoma component lacking evidence of specific line of differentiation and a differentiated 
component (typically a low-grade endometrioid carcinoma). In this study, we evaluated the expression of core SWItch/Sucrose 
Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex proteins and mismatch repair (MMR) proteins on a series of DDOC and compared their 
global methylation profile to that of other core SWI/SNF-deficient gynecologic tract tumors, namely small cell carcinoma of ovary 
hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) and undifferentiated endometrial carcinoma (UDEC).   
Design: We collected a multi-institutional cohort of 17 DDOC and performed immunohistochemistry for ARID1A, ARID1B, 
SMARCA4, SMARCB1, p53, MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 on whole tissue sections. Whole genome DNA-methylation analysis 
was performed using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC 850k BeadChip kit on 3 DDOC with comparison made to a previously 
reported cohort of SCCOHT (all SMARCA4-inactivated) and UDEC. Data were analyzed by t-distributed stochastic neighbor 
embedding analysis (t-SNE). 
Results: The 17 patients with DDOC ranged from 32 to 71 years old (average of 53). Two presented with FIGO stage IA disease, 
while the remaining showed extra-ovarian tumor involvement (7 stage II, 4 stage III and 4 stage IV). With the exception of the 2 with 
stage IA disease, all patients died from their disease with a median survival of 4 months (Figure 1).  The differentiated component 
 
  
 
S990 
was endometrioid in type in all cases and all cases showed wild-type p53 expression in both the differentiated and undifferentiated 
components. By immunohistochemistry, 14 of 15 cases with interpretable results showed loss of expression of core SWI/SNF 
complex proteins, with 9 showing co-loss of ARID1A and ARID1B and 5 showing loss of SMARCA4 confined to the undifferentiated 
component.  3 of 17 cases were MMR-deficient (all ARID1A and ARID1B co-inactivated). t-SNE analysis of the DNA methylation 
profiles of 3 cases of DDOC (1 SMARCA4-deficient and 2 ARID1A/ARID1B co-deficient) showed clustering with UDEC that was 
distinct from SCCOHT (Figure 2).   
Figure 1 - 977 
 
Figure 2 - 977 
 
Conclusions: Our results show that DDOC is a highly aggressive and molecularly unique type of ovarian carcinoma characterized 
by frequent inactivation of core SWI/SNF complex proteins.  It displays a methylation profile that overlaps with UDEC but is distinct 
from SCCOHT.

Background: Gynecologic malignancies are the leading causes of death for women in the United States, and they are fifth and 
sixth for ovarian cancer (OC) and endometrial cancer (EC), respectively. Nearly 75% of OC patients achieve clinical remission 
following surgery and chemotherapy, but most tumors recur within 24 months. We employed cutting-edge whole genome 
sequencing (WGS) analysis to study a group of gynecologic malignancies to further elucidate their molecular underpinnings and 
formulate a novel approach to detect potential targets. 
Design: WGS was performed on 80 tumor/normal pairs from 74 female patients with different gynecological malignancies (Table 
1), age range 17-91 years old. We employed the Isabl GxT analytic platform and manually curated single base substitution (SBS) 
molecular signatures and structural variants (SV) that involved tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. Clinico-pathologic and 
molecular findings were correlated. 
Results: Most cases (90%) had >20% tumor purity. In addition to known genomic alterations in gynecological malignancies, 
uncommon oncogenic mutations were detected in endometrial cancer, e.g., FGFR2, AKT1, TSC1 and CDK12, and in high-grade 
serous carcinoma of ovary/fallopian tube (PM1852), e.g., TSC2 and RAD51B. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline events 
included BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, and FANCL. In addition, genomic signatures associated with homologous recombination 
 
  
 
S991 
deficiency (HRD) were detected in 15% of cases, CDK12-type genomic instability in 18% (Figure 1), and mismatch repair 
deficiency (MMR) in 21% (Table 1 and Figure 2). Remarkably, our genomic signature-based approach and manual data curation 
nominated potential targets in 12 cases that did not have treatment options per OncoKB.

Background: Accurate classification of ovarian mucinous neoplasms (OMNs) is crucial for optimal clinical management. Mucinous 
borderline tumors (MBT) are architecturally complex non-invasive neoplasms with gastrointestinal differentiation. MBTs may display 
foci of intraepithelial carcinoma (IEC) or mucinous carcinoma (MC), consisting of expansile and/or infiltrative growth patterns. 
Histologic criteria for IEC and expansile MC are not well-defined and appear subjective. To date there have been no reproducibility 
studies addressing this diagnostic challenge. We aimed to assess interobserver agreement for diagnosing OMNs. 
Design: Archival microscopic slides from OMNs diagnosed as MBT, MBT with IEC and MC were digitized. Whole slide images 
were uploaded to an online digital slide archive and reviewed by 8 subspecialized gynecologic pathologists. Interobserver 
agreement was assessed using Fleiss' kappa in SPSS 28.0.1.0. 
Results: A total of 109 OMNs were included in the study. The median number of slides reviewed was 3 (range 1-4). Fleiss' kappa 
showed that interobserver agreement was moderate for infiltrative MC (κ=0.405, 95% CI, 0.370-0.441, p<0.0005) and MBT 
(κ=0.402, 95% CI, 0.366-0.437, p<0.0005), and only fair for expansile MC (κ=0.366, 95% CI, 0.331-0.402, p<0.0005) and IEC 
(κ=0.217, 95% CI, 0.181-0.252, p<0.0005). Comparison of the diagnoses rendered by the 8 observers with the original diagnoses 
demonstrated fair agreement (κ=0.336, 95% CI, 0.318-0.355, p<0.0005). Overall agreement among the 8 observers was fair 
(κ=0.335, 95% CI, 0.313-0.356, p<0.0005), and a subset of OMNs were categorized by some observers as mucinous cystadenoma 
(MCA) not meeting criteria for MBTs. Comparison of individual kappa values indicated that observers were in better (moderate) 
agreement when categorizing OMNs as MBT vs other (κ=0.402, 95% CI, 0.366-0.437, p<0.0005), but far less agreement over other 
categories (fair for expansile MC with or without IEC, infiltrative MC and MCA, poor for IEC in MBT; κ=0.345, 0.309-0.381; κ=0.330, 
0.294-0.366; κ=0.334, 0.298-0.369; κ=0.179, 0.144-0.215, respectively; all 95% CI, p<0.0005). 
Conclusions: This multi-institutional interobserver study addresses the diagnostic challenges of OMNs. Overall agreement among 
subspecialized gynecologic pathologists is only fair and ranges from poor to moderate for different categories of OMNs. The study 
suggests that recalibration of the diagnostic criteria for IEC, expansile and infiltrative MC is needed to ensure accurate 
classification of OMNs.

Background: Ascertaining if a subset leiomyomas (LM) can differentiate to become leiomyosarcomas (LMS) has been an area of 
interest and contention. Mediator complex subunit 12, encoded by MED12, has hotspot loss-of-function alterations in both intronic 
and exonic regions 1 and 2 that are identified in approximately 80-90% of LM and 15-20% of LMS, as well as a majority of both 
fibroadenomas and phyllodes tumors. 
Design: The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was explored for uterine LMS regarding race and OS. 
Leiomyosarcomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were explored to see most altered genes, with possible co-
alterations and overall survival assessment. MED12 or PTEN was assessed in all uterine cancers in the TCGA database and 
compared by overall survival (OS) and race. To assess for racial associations, MED12 mRNA expression analysis was reviewed in 
uterine cancers in TCGA data accessed through The Human Protein Atlas. 
 
  
 
S994 
Results: In uterine cancers overall, MED12-altered tumors (n=222) had a significantly worse overall survival than MED12 wild-type 
(WT) (N=996) (p=0.05). Notably, MED12 alterations were most enriched in Black or African American (B/AA) women (q<10-10). 
Expression data (mRNA and IHC) indicated MED12 was not prognostic in women with uterine cancers overall (n=1063 and 
p=0.18). However, when MED12 expression results were separated by race, B/AA women made up 19.5% of highest expression 
tumors (top 5%) and 41.4% in tumors with lowest expression (bottom 5%) (p=0.02). 5104 cases of LMS of the uterus of were 
identified in the SEER database. Black women in the US were overrepresented with 1035 (20.3%) cases, while making up only 12-
14% of the US population. Black women had the worst OS, this a median OS in White was 21.96 months (mo) vs Black 14.98 (mo). 
Conclusions: In B/AA women with uterine LMS have significantly worse OS than other races, and suffer significantly more burden 
of disease, relative to population percentage. MED12 is altered in a subset of LMS, and in uterine cancers MED12-altered cancers 
are significantly more aggressive and significantly more enriched in B/AA women (p/q-value<10-10). Discrepancies in studies linking 
LM to LMS may be due to the subset of MED12-altered LMS being enriched in historically underrepresented and understudied 
populations. Future studies of MED12 in LMS must include underrepresented population to accurately reflect the role of MED12 in 
LMS.

Background: GATA3 expression has recently been reported to be a prognostic factor in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC) and urothelial carcinoma. Herein, we assess the prognostic significance and patterns of GATA3 expression in a cohort of 
vulvar SCC. 
Design: 86 cases of vulvar SCC diagnosed at a single institution constituted our study cohort. Immunohistochemical studies for 
GATA3, p16 and p53 were performed on each case. p16 (block vs non-block) and p53 (mutation pattern vs wild type pattern) were 
scored by standard criteria. Given that the observed GATA3 expression pattern in normal vulva was strong basal staining with 
uniform upward extension until at least the mid epidermal layers, SCCs were scored using the tri-pattern criteria of Goyal et al 
[PMID: 29434343]:  Pattern 0 (no loss of basal staining in nests), Pattern 1 (25-75% basal staining) and Pattern 2 (<25% basal 
staining). p16 status was used to classify the cohort into HPV associated (HPVA) if p16 block positive, or HPV independent (HPVI) 
if p16 block negative. We investigated any potential relationships between GATA3 expression and p53 status, p16/HPV status, 
stage and patient outcomes. 
Results: The mean patient age for the entire cohort was 65.9 years (range 29-94). 52 (60.5%) cases were HPVA, and 34 (39.5%) 
were HPVI. 30 (34.9%) cases showed a p53 mutation pattern and 55 (64%) a p53 wild-type pattern. GATA3 expression patterns in 
relation to p53 mutation and p16 status are summarized in Table 1. Clear differences in GATA3 expression frequencies were 
discernible between p53 mutated versus p53 wild-type tumors as well as between HPVA and HPVI tumors (p<.001). The cases 
that showed significant loss of GATA3 expression (Pattern 2, <25% basal staining) had significantly worse overall and disease-free 
survival in comparison to cases with Pattern 0 or 1 staining (>25% retained basal expression), (p=0.011 and 0.024 respectively, 
see Figure 1). However, the significance of this finding was not independent of stage and p53 status on multivariate analysis 
(MVA). Within the p53 wild-type subset of the whole study cohort, however, Pattern 2 expression of GATA3 was associated 
with significantly worse overall survival (OS; p=0 .002), independent of stage and p16 expression (p= 0.009, HR:8.2) on MVA.

Conclusions: In our study, basal loss of GATA3 was seen in both HPVA and HPVI vulvar SCCs but was significantly more 
common in HPVI SCCs. Loss or substantial diminution of GATA3 expression (Pattern 2) is a negative prognostic factor in vulvar 
SCCs, but only in the p53 wild type subset, where its negative prognostic significance appears to be independent of p16 status and 
stage.

Background: The clinical significance of applying the TCGA molecular classification in stage I low-grade endometrial endometrioid 
carcinoma (EEC) is under debate as these patients generally have an excellent clinical outcome. However, a small subset of stage 
I low-grade EEC are p53-abnormal (p53abn) and may have a poor prognosis, although their existence is questioned. Here, we 
aimed to pathologically review and characterize stage I low-grade p53abn EEC previously identified in our databases. 
Design: Tumor material from the PORTEC-1 and -2 trials (n=881) and retrospectively collected Canadian historic cohorts (n=2506) 
was available for analysis. All patients with previously reported stage I p53abn EEC were selected; none of these exhibited 
pathogenic POLE mutations or mismatch repair-deficiency. Abnormal p53 status was confirmed by p53 immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) and TP53 mutation analysis. Review of histotype and FIGO grading was performed by six expert gynecological pathologists, 
blinded to the molecular subgroup and study aim, using one H&E-stained section per case. Low-grade NSMP EEC (n=10) and 
p53abn serous carcinomas (n=13) were included as controls. The mutational landscape was assessed with next generation 
sequencing. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for the assessment of recurrence-free survival (RFS). 
Results: In total, 55 p53abn stage I low-grade EEC were identified. Following pathology review, 17 (30.9%) cases were assigned 
as not low-grade EEC by all of the expert pathologists, while 38 (69.1%) and 26 (47.3%) were assigned low-grade EEC by ≥1 
 
  
 
S996 
and ≥3 pathologists, respectively. Two representative cases are illustrated in figure 1. Clustering cases by agreement on low-grade 
EEC histology showed no significant differences in mutational landscape, with a low prevalence of PTEN and PIK3CA mutations in 
all cases (figure 2). 5-year RFS was higher with increasing agreement on low-grade EEC histology, with a 5-year RFS of 61.9%, 
72.8% and 76.5% for cases assigned as low-grade EEC by none, ≥1 and ≥3 pathologists, respectively. 
Figure 1 - 982 
 
Figure 2 - 982 
 
Conclusions: A subset of p53abn endometrial carcinomas are morphologically low-grade endometrioid with a molecular 
landscape that is similar to prototypical p53abn endometrial carcinomas. The risk of recurrence for patients with stage I low-grade 
p53abn EEC is higher compared to the risk of recurrence of stage I low-grade EEC in literature. Our results may support 
performing molecular classification on all endometrial carcinomas.

Background: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase protein that has been reported to be 
overexpressed in a subset of ovarian cancers. This protein not only offers a promising target for targeted therapy and but also may 
offer a new target for immunotherapy because of its membranous location. We analyzed the association between EGFR 
expression and clinical and pathologic parameters in ovarian cancer to determine the prognostic significance and guide future 
immunotherapy. 
Design: We created tissue microarrays of high-grade ovarian epithelial tumors from patients diagnosed at The University of Texas 
MD Anderson Cancer Center. EGFR expression was examined in the microarrays by immunohistochemistry analysis using the 
EGFR antibody clone 31G7 (Abnova). Results were categorized as either negative (no staining or nonspecific staining) or positive 
(weak to strong membranous staining). For each patient, we collected age, AJCC stage, ascites, and family history of cancer; these 
data were summarized using descriptive statistics and compared by EGFR status using chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier analysis was 
used to analyze overall survival by EGFR status. GraphPad Prism v.8.4.3 was used for all statistical analysis. 
Results: Patient data were analyzed in two cohorts. Cohort 1 contained 234 patients: 43 (18%) were positive for EGFR and 191 
(82%) were negative. EGFR-negative status was associated with better overall survival (p<0.0001). Cohort 2 contained 249 
patients, with a similar pattern of EGFR positivity (18 [7%] were positive and 231 [93%] were negative) and a similar overall survival 
benefit for EGFR-negative status (p=0.0153). A family history of cancer was associated with EGFR-positive status (p=0.01). Other 
clinical factors, including age (>51 years vs ≤51 years), AJCC stage (stage I/II vs stage III/IV), and ascites (present vs not present), 
were not associated with EGFR status (p>0.05). 
Figure 1 - 983 
 
Figure 2 - 983 
 
Conclusions: Our data indicate that overexpression of EGFR is associated with poor overall survival in patients with high-grade 
serous ovarian cancer. The data also provide a strong rationale for the development of EGFR inhibitors and offer a new potential 
target for immunotherapy. 
 
984    Evidence-Based Strategies for Tissue Sampling to Detect Occult STIC/HGSC in Salpingo-

Background: Evidence-based guidelines remain to be defined for tissue sampling to detect occult serous tubal intraepithelial 
carcinoma (STIC) / high grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) in bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) performed for hormone 
suppression of estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer.  In concept, examination of the entire ovaries and fallopian tubes 
(SEE-Fim protocol) is merited for patients with a pathogenic variant in any hereditary ovarian cancer gene (HOC-PV); otherwise 
representative sectioning of the ovaries and non-fimbriated tube is appropriate, along with complete examination of the 
fimbriae.  This study evaluated tissue sampling, genetic risks, occult cancer and post BSO outcome in order to develop tissue 
sampling guidelines in this setting. 
Design: 166 consecutive cases of BSO for hormone suppression of ER positive breast cancer were identified in our pathology 
archives. Germline genetic test results for HOC genes (as defined by the 2022 NCCN guidelines) were obtained from our genetic 
 
  
 
S998 
counseling division.  The prevalence of post-BSO pelvic HGSC was determined from outcome surveillance data from our 
institutional Cancer Registry. 
Results: Tissue sampling was complete in 78% (129/166) specimens, resulting in a 2.5 x higher number of tissue cassettes than 
for representatively sampled specimens, as expected (Table 1).  No cases contained STIC or HGSC but 10% (16/166) had ovarian 
metastasis of breast cancer and a higher prevalence of benign alterations was reported in cases completely submitted. Genetic test 
status was not documented in the medical records of 38% (63/166) patients. Among 103 patients with documented testing, none 
had a HOC-PV but 7% (7/103) had a HOC variant of unknown significance (VUS) (2 BRCA1/2, 2 RAD51C/D, 2 ATM, 1 MSH2).  No 
patients developed post-BSO pelvic HGSC.

Conclusions: Representative sampling of grossly normal ovaries is reasonable in ER positive breast cancer patients undergoing 
surgical hormone suppression with confirmed negative testing for HOC-PV.  However, in our institution there are significant 
communication gaps regarding genetic test results, leading to higher lab resource utilization than necessary.  Although we did not 
identify any patients with a HOC-PV in this cohort, a more robust risk estimate requires a larger study size.  Specimen 
management in patients with HOC-VUS remains to be defined.

Background: Patients with high grade ovarian epithelial carcinoma (HGOvCa) have poor prognosis, especially at advance stages 
(stage III and IV). TROP2 is a cell-surface glycoprotein and has been reported to be overexpressed in 
various adenocarcinomas.  As TROP2 expression is located on the membrane surface and thus represent an ideal target for 
immunotherapy. Here we examined the expression TROP2 in HGOvCa and its correlation with the survival and other clinical data.  
Design: Tissue microarrays of 234 cases of HGOvCa diagnosed at MD Anderson Cancer Center were immunohistochemical 
stained for TROP2.  TROP2 expression was scored using the HER2 reporting criteria. Recorded information included age, 
histotype, AJCC stage, surgical treatment, chemotherapy, clinical response, disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). 
Descriptive statistics, Kaplan Meier curves, and survival analysis were performed in GraphPad Prism v.8.4.3 (La Jolla, CA).   
Results: Histotypes were as follows: high grade serous carcinoma, high grade endometroid adenocarcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, 
carcinosarcoma, mixed high grade carcinoma, and undifferentiated carcinoma.  TROP2 expression was scored into four 
groups: positive (Score 3+) in 24 patients (10.2%), equivocal (Score 2+) in 55 patients (23.5%), negative (Score 1+) in 84 patients 
 
  
 
S999 
(35.9%), and negative (Score 0) in 71 patients (30.3%). We found a significant overall survival benefit in patients with positive 
TROP2 expression versus equivocal (p=0.0367), negative (Score 1+) (p=0.031), and negative (Score 0) (p=0.0102). Meanwhile, 
tumors with TROP2 expression (combined score 1+, 2+, and 3+) showed a trend towards better clinical response as compared to 
TROP2 negative (Score 0) (p=0.0502). However, there is no significant difference in disease free survival among the groups.  A 
significant overall survival benefit in stage III-IV high-grade serous carcinoma patients with positive TROP2 expression versus 
equivocal (p=0.0084), negative (Score 1+) (p=0.0462), and negative (Score 0) (p=0.0270) was also illustrated.  
Conclusions: Our study showed that HGOvCa with positive TROP2 expression had a significant better overall survival as 
compared to patients with equivocal or negative TROP2 expression. This overall survival benefit may be due to better clinical 
response. These results indicate that TROP2 may be a prognostic marker for better survival and potential targets for 
immunotherapy.

Background: Gynecologic (GYN) primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) consist of central (cPNET) and peripheral/Ewing 
sarcoma (ES) types. GYN ES frequently harbor EWSR1 fusion like its bone and soft tissue counterpart. GYN cPNET resemble 
primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors. By DNA methylation profiling, CNS tumors previously considered PNET are now 
reclassified as common CNS neoplasms or embryonal tumors with specific genotypes. The utility of methylation profiling in 
classifying on GYN PNET is unknown. 
Design: DNA methylation profiling was performed on 16 GYN PNET that were histologically confirmed and classified as cPNET or 
ES based on morphology, immunohistochemistry, and EWSR1 FISH. Primary site and associated tumor were noted. Whole 
genome DNA methylation was analyzed using EPIC array (Illumina, CA). DNA methylation data were analyzed and tumors 
classified using clinically validated CNS tumor and sarcoma Random Forest classifiers. Copy numbers were analyzed using 
conumee package. 
Results: GYN PNET included 13 cPNET and 3 ES arising in the ovary (n=8), uterus (n=7) and vulva (n=1). Only cPNET (n=8/13, 
61%) was associated with another tumor, including teratoma (n=4), endometrioid carcinoma (n=1), adenosarcoma (n=1) and 
carcinosarcoma (n=2). The CNS tumor classifier matched 87% of GYN PNET (n=14/16) with a CNS tumor, including 
medulloblastoma (n=6), embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR, n=3), ES (n=2), intraocular medulloepithelioma (n=1), 
pediatric-type diffuse high grade glioma (n=1) and ependymoma (n=1). The sarcoma classifier confirmed both ES (n=2) and 
identified high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (HGESS, n=1).  Only 1 GYN PNET remained unclassified by both classifiers. 
Conclusions: DNA methylation profiling successfully classified >90% GYN PNET as known CNS tumor or sarcoma entities, 
supporting the utility of methylation-based tumor classification in the diagnostic evaluation of these rare lesions. These findings 
raise consideration of CNS tumor-specific treatment modalities in GYN cPNET. Given reclassification of most GYN cPNET as 
distinct CNS tumor and sarcoma entities, modification of PNET terminology in GYN tumors should be considered.

Background: Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is caused by germline variants of fumarate 
hydratase (FH) and presents with multiple uterine leiomyomas, multiple cutaneous leiomyomas, and renal cell carcinoma. Uterine 
and cutaneous leiomyomas are considered as sentinel tumors in HLRCC patients. Uterine leiomyomas caused by somatic variants 
of FH can also present with severe symptoms. Although many studies have analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics of FH-
deficient uterine leiomyoma, there are few reports on how to integrate them with FH immunohistochemistry and FH gene 
 
  
 
S1000 
sequencing. We aimed to analyze the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of FH-deficient uterine leiomyoma, so as to 
explore the pathological diagnosis strategy. 
Design: 85 cases of FH-deficient uterine leiomyoma were diagnosed from April 2018 to September 2022. Whole exons (exon 1-10) 
Sanger sequencing of FH gene were performed on tumor tissues of all cases and matched non tumor tissues/peripheral blood, and 
FH immunohistochemistry were performed in 79 cases. 
Results: Patients’ age ranged from 18 to 54 (36.1±7.3) years, more than 60% of them had clinical symptoms, exhibiting multiple 
and large leiomyomas (average maximum diameter was 7.68cm). Four or more of the seven histological features, including 
staghorn vasculature, alveolar-pattern oedema, bizarre nuclei, oval nuclei arranged in chains, prominent eosinophilic nucleoli with 
perinucleolar haloes and eosinophilic intracytoplasmic globules were observed in 95.9% (70/73) patients. The sensitivity of FH 
immunohistochemistry was 82.3% (65/79). According to the results of Sanger sequencing of FH, the cases were divided into 
germline variant group (31 cases, of which 5 cases had variants of unknown significance), somatic variant group (34 cases) and no 
pathogenic variant group (20 cases). Only 69.0% (20/29) of the patients with FH germline variant had clear family history. 
Conclusions: Clinical features, histological morphology, FH immunohistochemistry and FH Sanger sequencing have their own 
significance and limitations in differentiating FH-deficient uterine leiomyoma. In order to ensure the accurate pathological diagnosis 
and timely selection of patients with HLRCC, detailed clinicopathological features, FH immunohistochemistry and FH gene 
sequencing results should be fully integrated in clinical practice.

Background: Progestin is a treatment option for atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH). Presence or absence of residual disease 
(RD) is a common challenging question for pathologists. This is because progestin induces a spectrum of morphologic changes in 
AEH samples. Based on morphologic classifications (PMIDs: 32931681, 34782217) by the gynecologic pathology group at UTSW 
medical center, the morphologic changes can be largely divided into three groups: none or poor response (NR), partial response 
(PR), and complete response (CR). The relationship between progestin induced morphologic changes and RD status remains 
clarified. It is known that the biomarkers, PTEN, Pax2, and β-catenin (PPB), are useful to aid AEH diagnosis in both pre- and post-
progestin treated samples.  The study aimed to correlate the biomarker aberrancy with different morphologic responses in those 
post-treated samples in order to better define RD.  
Design: 120 patients from 2018 to 2021 were studied. IHC staining using antibody against PTEN, Pax2, and β-catenin was 
performed on 120 post-progestin treated samples at either the first 3-month or the second 6-month F/U. Each sample contained 
more than 1 responding area. After reviewing all samples, different morphologic responses were recorded and summarized. 
Aberrant expression of either of the 3 PPB markers in any F/U sample was considered as RD. The marker aberrancy was 
individually calculated from different responsive areas. Results of the stain were analyzed by using Fisher exact test. 
Results: Among 120 post progestin-treated cases with at least 2 F/Us, RD was identified in 58 (48.3%) samples.  Morphologic 
responses were 76 NR, 132 PR, and 140 CR. Aberrant markers were expressed in 68 (89.4%) NR, 60 (48.5%) PR, and 0 (0%) CR. 
Detailed data is summarized in Table 1. Within the PR areas, more complex architecture and less stromal decidualization was 
associated with more marker aberrancy. Interesting to note that higher association of aberrant β-catenin was associated with 
glands showing morules.

Note: The p values listed represented the comparisons between NR and PR.  All comparisons, either NR or PR vs CR, were 
statistically significant with p < 0.001.  
Conclusions: Morphologically NRs mostly represent RD in progestin treated samples, while PRs contain a mixture of residual and 
non-residual diseases. The more NR areas or more complex architecture in PRs, the more likely the residual diseases. CR areas 
represent optimally treated without any RD. It is recommended to quantify different progestin induced different responses in the 
pathology report, particularly when biomarkers are not available to aid diagnosis.

Background: Uterine leiomyoma (LM) is the most common benign neoplasm in reproductive age women with a prevalence of over 
70% in women. About 25% patients with LM show symptoms and many are subject to surgical treatment and histologically 
evaluated by pathologist. Recent advantages of molecular biology uncover the specific gene mutations/alterations in LM, but 
molecular changes in association with LM variants remain to be fully elucidated. 
Design: A total 716 leiomyomas from 496 patients were collected at Northwestern Prentice Hospital with either consented patients 
or waivered by IRB exemption. Cases included 526 usual type LM (ULM), 22 cellular LM (CLM), 52 cellular leiomyoma with 
sclerosis (CLMS), 24 hydropic LM (HLM), 9 lipoleiomyoma (LLM), 3 intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVLM), 40 fumarate hydratase 
deficient LM (FH-BN), and 37 leiomyoma with bizarre nuclei (LM-BN) (Figure 1). MED12 mutations were performed by Sanger 
sequencing, HMGA2 overexpression and FH deficiency were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). 
Results: In a total of 716 LM and variants, MED12 mutations were detected in 56%, HMGA2 overexpression in 22% and FH 
deficiency in 6%. About 16% of LM and variants did not detect any mutation/alteration (Table 1). MED12 mutations were detected 
in 74% of ULM, and none in other variants except for CLM and LM-BN. HMGA2 overexpression was enriched in CLMS, HLM, LLM, 
and IVLM in a range of 75-100%. LM variants with HMGA2 overexpression showed some similar cytohistologic features, 
including small round-oval nuclei, hypercellularity with sclerotic matrix, increased vessels, and organized growth patterns. FH 
deficiency LM were selected based on the characteristic histologic features and they are frequently associated remarkable nuclear 
atypia. As high as 78% of LMBN and 68% of CLM did not harbor mutations of these three genes (Table 1). HMGA2, MED12 and 
FH alterations are mutually exclusive in all examined LM (Table 1).

Conclusions: Overall, >85% of examined leiomyomas harbor one of three known gene mutations. HMGA2 overexpression is 
common in several LM variants, including CLMS, HLM, LLM and IVLM. These variants show some overlapping cytohistologic 
features. Immunostains for HMGA2 and FH can be used in aid of differential diagnosis of certain LM variants. More molecular 
studies on CLM and LMBN are needed to explore the associated genetic alterations.  
 
990    A Comprehensive Population-Based Study of Malignant Ovarian Tumors, including Histologic 
and Immunohistochemical Review, in Girls 0-19 Years in Sweden between 1970 and 2014

Background: Ovarian tumors in the pediatric population are very rare. The overall incidence and frequency of subtypes differs 
between children and adults, as well as between different age groups within the pediatric population. Although not all tumors are 
aggressive, they may still lead to morbidity secondary to therapy. Some entities, for example, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, are 
associated with cancer predisposition syndromes. A deepened knowledge of what tumor types to expect in the pediatric population 
and in different age groups within this population, may aid when diagnosing these tumors. The goal of this study was a 
comprehensive review of malignant ovarian tumors in children. 
Design: Individuals were identified through a search in the Swedish cancer registry using appropriate ICD-10 codes, limited for 
ages 0-19 between 1970 and 2014. Clinical data, such as original diagnosis, year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, region etc. was 
extracted from the registry. Regional biobanks were contacted and stored material, either FFPE blocks or microscopy slides, were 
collected and reviewed. 
Results: A total of 345 individuals were included. The majority were between 15-19 years old at time of diagnosis (70.7%). Median 
age at diagnosis was 16 years. No differences in incidence over time or geographic location were identified. The mean follow up 
time was 21.1 years. A total of 51 patients (14.8%) died during follow up, 45 (13%) due to their malignant ovarian tumor. New 
cases per year ranged from 2 to 13.  260 cases were available for slide review, resulting in 85 epithelial tumors, 121 germ cell 
tumors, 47 sex cord-stromal tumors and 7 other. For age 0-4 years sex cord-stromal tumors dominated, for 5-9 as well as 10-14 
years germ cell tumors was the dominating category, and for the oldest age group 15-19 years epithelial tumors dominated. Kaplan 
Meier curves for overall survival are shown in Figure 1. The original diagnoses were known in 225 cases. Review diagnosis and 
original diagnosis had a complete correspondence in 182 cases (80.8%). Statistical analyses indicated that there was a strong 
agreement between review diagnose and original diagnose (Cohen´s k 0,944). Differentiating between entities within the sex cord-
stromal group posed the biggest diagnostic challenge.

Conclusions: Pediatric ovarian tumors are rare and distinct from their adult counterparts. There was a strong concurrence 
between original and review diagnosis. The greatest diagnostic difficulty was within the sex cord-stromal group.

Background: Uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) frequently harbors mutations in TP53, ATRX, RB1, and PTEN. Rarely, uLMS shows 
focal heterologous (“divergent”) differentiation, including rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), chondrosarcoma (CS) and osteosarcoma 
(OS) - the underlying molecular aberrations of these tumors are not well characterized. This study analyzes the genomics of a 
cohort of uLMS with heterologous features. 
Design: Two index cases of uLMS with RMS differentiation were retrospectively identified at our institution, and each component 
was microdissected for independent molecular characterization using a pan-cancer capture-based next generation sequencing 
assay with a total footprint of 2.8 Mb (479 cancer genes and select introns of 47 genes). Subsequently, the FoundationOne Heme® 
database was searched for uLMS samples showing divergent differentiation (both components analyzed in the same test). The 
molecular findings, pathology reports, and archived histopathology images were reviewed for each case. 
Results: Four additional cases from a cohort of 1354 uLMS (0.3%) contained heterologous differentiation with supportive 
immunohistochemical findings, present in at least 10% of each sequenced sample. The final cohort consisted of tumors with RMS 
(4), CS (1) and OS (1) components. In 2/6 recurrent tumors, the metastatic focus demonstrated non-LMS elements only (1 CS, 1 
OS). No carcinoma component was identified in any of the tumors- this helped exclude carcinosarcoma. Tumors were 
microsatellite stable and exhibited low tumor mutational burden. The two index cases displayed shared alterations between the 
LMS and RMS components, with the first harboring a shared ATRX alteration in the LMS and RMS components, and the second 
displaying a shared TP53 and two RB1 alterations in both components. The most frequently and recurrently mutated genes for the 
four cases from the F1H database included TP53 (100%), RB1 (50%), ATRX (100%), and PTEN (25%), at prevalence rates 
generally similar to the remainder of the uLMS cohort (70% TP53, 54% RB1, 29% ATRX, and 18% PTEN-mutant; p=0.33, 1.0, 
0.007, 0.55, respectively). PAX3 fusions or IDH1 mutations, indicative of pure rhabdomyosarcoma or chondrosarcoma, were not 
identified in any of the six tumors. 
Conclusions: uLMS with heterologous differentiation shows genomic overlap with conventional uLMS with similar driver 
alterations. Comprehensive genomic profiling of uLMS with aberrant differentiation can help diagnose and improve tumor 
classification.

992    Detection of Incidental Serous Tubal Intraepithelial Carcinoma (STIC) in Women Without 
Known Risk for Hereditary Ovarian Cancer Undergoing Surgery Unrelated to Tubo-ovarian

Background: Pathologic detection of STIC has been reported in rare women without known risk of a germline pathogenic variant 
of a hereditary ovarian cancer gene (HOC-PV) who are undergoing surgery unrelated to tubo-ovarian cancer.  While it is well-
established that complete examination of the fimbriae and non-fimbriated fallopian tube is required to detect occult STIC in women 
with HOC-PV, this is a time and resource-intensive protocol.  Whether this protocol is justified in women without HOC-PV remains 
to be defined but is relevant to laboratory resource utilization.  We hypothesize that patient age could serve to triage which 
specimens merit complete versus representative examination of the fimbriae.  We report the largest series of incidental STIC in 
women without HOC-PV undergoing surgery unrelated to tubo-ovarian cancer and, integrating similar cases in the literature, 
provide practical guidelines for resource-limited practices. 
Design: Cases of incidental STIC in women at presumed low risk for HOC-PV undergoing surgery unrelated to tubo-ovarian 
cancer were collected from 3 academic cancer-referral centers.  Diagnostic confirmation by aberrant p53 immunohistochemistry 
was established in each case.  A PubMed search was conducted for similar cases. 
Results: 54 cases were identified in the 3 academic centers.  Median age was 64.5 years. Only 1.8% (1/54) were under age 40; 
22% (12/54) were under age 50.  The youngest was 36 years, undergoing salpingectomy for ectopic pregnancy and found to have 
STIC and tubal high grade serous carcinoma (HGSC).  Overall, pure STIC was present in 65% (35/54).  Tubal HGSC was present 
in 24% (13/54).  Ovarian HGSC accompanied STIC/tubal HGSC in 11% (6/54).  The major surgical indications were a.) 
hysterectomy for endometrioid carcinoma (24%), atypical hyperplasia (5%), uterine prolapse (13%) menorrhagia (7%) or 
leiomyomas 5%) and b.) oophorectomy for serous cystadenoma/borderline tumor (11%) or mucinous cystadenoma (9%).  No 
cases were identified in salpingectomy for sterilization.  Among 84 similar cases published as case reports/series (Table 1), the 
youngest was 38 years, none involving salpingectomy for sterilization.

Conclusions: Complete examination of the fallopian tube fimbriae is the ideal method to maximize detection of occult STIC in 
women without known genetic risk for tubo-ovarian cancer.  However, in resource-limited practices, young patient age could serve 
as a triage tool for representative sampling as occult STIC has not been reported below age 35.

Background: The diagnosis of Endometrial Intraepithelial Neoplasia (EIN) is primarily morphologic. However, it has been 
demonstrated that aberrant PAX2, PTEN and/or beta-catenin (BCAT) staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is 92% sensitive in 
identifying bona fide EIN lesions. In practice, areas of endometrial gland crowding (GC), suspicious but not definitive for EIN are 
 
  
 
S1005 
often encountered. Our aim is to explore the outcome predictive value of the above markers in patients with GC in endometrial 
biopsy. 
Design: Samples with GC between 2001 and 2021 with at least one follow-up biopsy and no prior history of endometrial neoplasia 
were retrieved. In our institution, diagnosis of GC is followed by a note recommending repeated biopsy in 3 to 6 months. Diagnosis 
at follow-up biopsy was categorized as benign vs neoplastic (EIN or endometrioid carcinoma). IHC for PAX2, PTEN and BCAT was 
performed on biopsies from patients with a neoplastic outcome and a representative selection of age-matched patients with benign 
outcome. Loss of PAX2 or PTEN staining and nuclear BCAT staining were scored as aberrant. IHC review was blinded to outcome. 
Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of aberrant staining results for a neoplastic outcome 
were calculated. 
Results: A total of 430 patients diagnosed with GC and follow-up biopsy were identified. Of these, 70 had a subsequent diagnosis 
of neoplasia (16%). Median interval between GC and neoplasia was 8 months. Median follow-up for patients with benign outcome 
was 53 months. IHC was successfully applied to 52 cases with neoplastic, and 63 cases with benign outcome. Individual marker 
performance was suboptimal, as all were frequently aberrant in both groups (Table 1). Normal staining for all markers in GC areas 
was seen in 46% of patients with benign vs 15% with neoplastic outcome, corresponding to 85% sensitivity and 94% NPV for 
neoplasia when ≥1 aberrant marker is considered positive.

Conclusions: Endometrial GC, worrisome but sub-diagnostic for EIN, is associated with subsequent neoplasia in 16% of patients, 
justifying a clinical recommendation for follow-up sampling. Aberrant expression of PAX2, PTEN and/or BCAT has limited predictive 
value since it is seen in a significant number of cases with benign follow-up. However, IHC may help inform management decisions 
as normal staining identifies women with a low (6%) likelihood of neoplastic outcome.

Background: Mirena IUD is an alternative treatment for endometrial endometrioid carcinoma (EEC) in some clinical scenarios, 
especially for patients with fertility demand. However, the efficacy is limited and differs from patient to patient. Hypoxia plays a role 
in endocrine therapy resistance in some cancers, and crosstalk between hormone and hypoxia pathways has been reported. PD-
L1 has been found to correlate with hypoxia markers in other cancers. The role of hypoxia and PD-L1 in endocrine therapy 
resistance in EEC has not been well studied, and this study aims to examine the effect of PD-L1 and hypoxia related markers 
(HIF1α, CAIX) expression on Mirena IUD treatment outcome. 
Design: A retrospective study of 62 patients (26 hyperplasia and 36 EEC) with 166 specimens were included. Tissue microarray 
blocks were made and stained for PD-L1, HIF1α, ER, PR, and CAIX. PD-L1 IHC expression was evaluated by combined positive 
score (CPS) with 1% positive as cut off. Clinicopathological data was collected and analyzed. The efficacy of IUD therapy was 
evaluated based on pathological examination and classified as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), no response, and 
progression (hyperplasia to atypia/carcinoma and/or tumor upgrade). Chi square and Fisher's exact tests were used for statistics (p 
< 0.05 is significant). 
Results: The response rate (CR+PR) is 23/26 (88%) in hyperplasia and 15/36 (42%) in EEC (p=0.01). ER is expressed in 86/92 
(93%) EEC biopsies while positive in 71/71 (100%) hyperplasia biopsies (p=0.03). PR is expressed in 70/92 (76%) EEC biopsies 
while positive in 55/72 (76%) hyperplasia biopsies (p=0.88). HIF1a expression in EEC biopsies (42/88, 48%) is higher than it in the 
hyperplasia (23/67, 34%) (p= 0.1). The CAIX expression in ECC biopsies (25/89, 28%) is higher than it in hyperplasia (8/69, 12%) 
(p=0.02). PD-L1 expression showed no difference between hyperplasia (5/70, 7%) and EEC biopsies (11/93, 12%) (p=0.4). EEC 
(hyperplasia excluded) with response (CR+ PR) are classified as group 1 while with no response or progression are classified as 
group 2. Table 1 summarizes the expression of HIF1a, CAIX and PD-L1 in the two groups on the follow up.

Background: High-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC) presumably arise via clonal TP53 mutations in fallopian tube (FT) epithelial 
cells. Excluding incidentally discovered serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs) in risk reduction specimens, most HGSCs 
are typically advanced when discovered, many without a recognizable FT precursor. Such scenarios challenge the traditional step-
wise model of carcinogenesis and frustrate efforts at early detection.  Chromothripsis, which defines a presumed single 
catastrophic event with extensive genomic chromosomal rearrangement, contrasts with the step-wise model and has been reported 
in ovarian cancer. This study determined the frequency of chromothripsis in HGSC and its relationship to clinical-pathologic 
parameters.  
Design: DNAs from FFPE tumors obtained locally were analyzed by the Affymetrix Oncoscan Array, a whole genome SNP 
microarray with 217,611 probes. Chromothripsis was defined as a minimum of 10 continuous segments/copies along the length of 
the chromosome, presumably altered in tandem. Retrospective analysis of a subset of TCGA cases, including CNV 
assessment, was performed using CNViz. 
Results: 55 cases (17 local and 38 TCGA) included 7 FIGO stage I/II, and 48 stage III/IV cases. Chromothripsis was identified in 
11/17 (65%) local cases by microarray, and 22/38 (58%) TCGA cases by DNA sequencing. Frequency of chromothripsis in stages 
I/II (4/7) and III/IV (26/48) was similar. Acrocentric chromosomes (13, 14, 15, 21, 22) were less frequently involved vs. metacentric 
and sub-metacentric chromosomes. Among the non-acrocentric chromosomes, chromosome 9 (6% of 33 cases) was 
least involved, followed by chromosomes 17 (9%) and 20 (9%). Among the local cases, STIC was present in 6/17 (35%); STIC or 
tumor distribution favored a FT primary in 12/17 (71%). Frequency of chromothripsis was similar irrespective of tumor primary (8/12 
tubal 5/7 non-tubal). 
Conclusions: The distal FT remains the principal host for the "cell of origin" for HGSC, but catastrophic chromosomal 
rearrangements could accelerate HGSC development in vulnerable cells, either in the tube or following escape into the peritoneal 
cavity. The potential for rapid onset underscores the importance of 1) timing salpingectomy to maximize HGSC prevention, 2) 
thorough pathologic exam of FTs to assess recurrence risk following salpingectomy (SEE-FIM dissection protocol) and 3) 
developing management strategies to mitigate recurrence risk when a STIC has been discovered. 
 
996    Challenges in Evaluating Post-Neoadjuvant Specimens of Endometrial Cancer: Histotype

Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is now used more frequently in advanced stage endometrial carcinoma. In the 
presence of residual tumor, post treatment changes might affect histotype and grade (G) designation. Here, we investigated 
histotype and grade concordance rates between preoperative biopsies and post-NACT specimens; and association between 
chemotherapy response score (CRS) and p53 molecular phenotype. 
 
  
 
S1007 
Design: Cases were identified from institutional electronic medical database (2015 to 2022). Clinicopathologic parameters were 
recorded as well as ancillary studies, if available. CRS was assigned to omental and adnexal metastases, and categorized as 
no/minimal (CRS1), partial (CRS2), and complete/near-complete (CRS3). 
Results: 23 cases were identified, mean age at diagnosis was 55 years. 16 (70%) patients were clinically staged as FIGO III, and 
7(30%) FIGO IV. The rationale for NACT was: locally advanced disease (26%), carcinomatosis (22%), extensive nodal involvement 
(22%), distant metastasis (30%). Preoperative histotype / grade were: endometrioid G1 (3, 13%), G2 (3, 13%), G3 (2, 9%), serous 
(5, 22%), clear cell (4, 17%), carcinosarcoma (1, 4%), poorly differentiated (3, 13%), and mixed histologies (2, 9%). 17 (74%) 
patients received carboplatin/paclitaxel as regimen of NACT. Preoperative diagnosis was based on endometrial biopsies in 22 
(95%) cases, and pleural fluid in 1 case (5%). Overall concordance between pre-op biopsies and resection specimen was 70% 
(Table 1). Clear-cell features led to ambiguity in histotype determination and were discordant in 2 cases (1 G1 endometrioid and 1 
serous); other major discordance was in pre-op and final grading of endometrioid carcinoma. CRS1 was noted in 4 cases, CRS2 in 
3 cases and CRS3 in 13 cases (3 were not available for review). p53 IHC was available in 14 cases, lower response to NACT 
(CRS1/2) was more frequent in p53mut tumors (4/5, 80%), and CRS3 was seen in 3/9 p53 mut tumors (33%).

Red highlights concordance in grade and histotype. 
Conclusions: NACT did not affect the histotype and grade designation. Poorly differentiated tumors, especially those with clear 
cell features showed poor diagnostic correlation between pretreatment biopsy and resection. p53mut tumors showed minimal 
response to NACT irrespective of histologic subtype. Molecular genetic analysis may improve diagnostic accuracy and 
prognostically relevant classification of these tumors.

Background: GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) immunohistochemistry (IHC) has recently been reported to be of utility in the 
pathologic classification of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia and in their distinction from inflammatory dermatoses (ID). The purpose 
of the current study is to assess the expression patterns of GATA3 in a large cohort of vulvar ID, putative dysplasias, and pre-
malignant 
Design: IHC studies for GATA3, p16 and p53 were performed on 128 vulvar tissues classified as differentiated VIN [dVIN] (n=25), 
vulvar altered maturation (VAM; n=11), HSIL (VINIII; n=44), and 49 ID [25 lichen sclerosus (LS), 13 spongiotic dermatitis (SD), 6 
lichen simplex chronicus (LSC), 2 lichen planus (LP), 3 non-specific interface dermatitis (NSID)], GATA3 expression was assessed

using the criteria of Goyal et al [PMID: 29434343]: Pattern 0 (no basal loss), Pattern 1 (25-75% basal staining) and Pattern 2 
(<25% basal expression). Parabasal expression was also reviewed and documented separately 
Results: The consistently observed pattern of GATA3 expression in normal vulvar epidermis was strong staining in the basal and 
parabasal layers, extending to at least the mid stratum spinosum. In the dermatoses cohort, moderate to strong GATA3 expression 
similar to non-neoplastic epidermis was observed in all cases of SD, LSC, LP, and NSID. Only one case of LS showed pattern 2 of 
GATA3 expression. dVIN cases showed partial/complete loss of GATA3 expression in the basal layer (with or without loss in the 
suprabasal layers) in 23 of 25 (92%) of cases, with the majority of these cases showing a significant loss of expression (Pattern 2 in 
19 cases, 76%). Ninety percent of VAM cases (9 cases) also showed some degree of GATA3 basal loss, of which 2 (20%) showed 
a significant loss (Pattern 2) and 7 demonstrated moderate loss of expression (70%). In the VINIII cohort, some degree of GATA-3 
loss was observed in 15.9% (1 pattern 1 and 6 pattern 2), but all other cases were Pattern 0. (Table 1)

Conclusions: GATA3 expression is diagnostically useful in the distinction of dVIN (76% Pattern 2) from ID such as lichen 
sclerosus (96% Pattern 0: no basal loss). The putative dysplastic lesion VAM, which is definitionally p53-wild type and HPV 
independent, also frequently displays loss of GATA3 expression. VINIII generally shows intact GATA3 expression; however, it is 
notable that some cases (15.9%) show basal loss. Our findings supports the theory that GATA3 basal loss is an early event in the 
malignant transformation of vulvar epithelium 
 
998    High-Grade Transformation of Ovarian Serous Borderline Tumors: A Series and Literature 
Review, Emphasizing Distinctive Morphology with Abundant Dense Eosinophilic Cytoplasm, 
Driver Mutations, and Extremely Dismal Prognosis

Disclosures: Xiaoming Zhang: None; Kelly Devereaux: None; Emily Ryan: None; Fei Fei: None; Christian Kunder: None; Teri 
Longacre: None 
Background: Ovarian serous borderline tumors (SBT) generally have a favorable prognosis but rare cases associated with a high-
grade (HG) component have been reported. Here we report the features of 6 SBTs with the presence of a morphologically unique 
HG component with an associated extremely dismal prognosis. 
Design: The 6 cases were collected from our pathology archives (1992-2022). Targeted gene panel was performed in 4 cases. A 
comprehensive literature review was conducted and a total of 26 cases with the development of HG carcinoma from SBT/low-grade 
serous carcinoma (LGSC) were identified (Table). To compare survival, the follow-up data for 45 conventional high-grade serous 
carcinomas (HGSC) from TCGA and 16 advanced/recurrent SBTs from a previously published study were utilized.   
Results: The HG component of all 6 cases demonstrated a proliferation of epithelioid cells with abundant dense eosinophilic 
cytoplasm (AEC) and variable pleomorphism ‒ each of which presented a challenging differential diagnosis that included clear cell 
carcinoma, mesothelioma, microinvasive SBT or LGSC, epithelioid sarcoma, and a histiocytic proliferative process (Fig. 1). 
Identical driver mutations were identified in both HG and SBT components in 3 cases (BRAF in 2, KRAS in 1), confirming clonality 
(Fig. 2). The remaining case showed KRAS mutation in SBT (sequencing failed in HG due to inadequate DNA). Additionally, both 
HG and SBT in one case harbored TERT promoter mutation, which has been previously reported in a case of carcinosarcoma 
arising from LGSC. All patients in our series with available follow-up data died within 1-9 months of diagnosis. Integrated survival 
analysis showed that patients with HG transformation of SBT/LGSC (n=21) had a significantly worse prognosis than conventional 
HGSCs or advanced/recurrent SBTs (P <0.05), with cases showing unique AEC morphology being the worst (Fig. 2).

Conclusions: Our study confirmed that ovarian SBT may occasionally undergo transformation to a high-grade tumor, which tends 
to be more clinically aggressive than conventional HGSCs. In particular, cases with unique AEC morphology, some of which may 
be deceptively bland looking, exhibited an extremely dismal prognosis. Importantly, we found BRAF as well as KRAS mutations 
were enriched in these high-grade transformed SBTs with AEC morphology, which questions the notion that BRAF is associated 
with improved outcome in SBTs. In addition, the role of TERT promoter mutation deserves further investigation in these tumors. 
 
999    Limited ER Expression and Mixed Sarcomatous Histology are not Uncommon in 
Mesonephric-type Malignancy of the Gynecologic Tract: A Clinicopathological Review of 22 
Cases

Disclosures: Zitong Zhao: None; Yen Yeo: None; Sangeeta Mantoo: None 
Background: Mesonephric adenocarcinoma (MA) and mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma (MLA) are uncommon neoplasms of the 
gynecologic tract, share similar morphology and immunoprofiles, usually ER negative and p53 wild type. MAs originate from 
mesonephric remnants, while MLAs are from Mullerian epithelium with mesonephric transdifferentiation and maybe associated with 
endometriosis-related pathology. Mixed sarcomatous component is rarely reported. 
Design: A search of the laboratory information system for MA/MLAs in two local institutions between January 2010 and July 2022 
was performed. Clinicopathological characteristics and available molecular results were reviewed (Table 1). 
Results: A total of 10 biopsies and 23 resection specimens from 22 patients were identified. The mean age was 57.5 years (range: 
39 - 73 years). Most common primary sites include ovary, endometrium and cervix. One case had lung metastasis and 2 cases had 
tumor recurrence. Macroscopically, MA/MLAs often showed greyish fleshy appearance with focal hemorrhage and necrosis. In the 
ovary, focal cystic component was a common finding and the average tumor size was 12.9cm (range: 4 - 23cm), with frequent 
ovarian capsular disruption (9/11, 81.8%). Microscopically, they generally displayed admixed tubules with eosinophilic secretions, 
solid and papillary patterns, featuring mild to moderate cytologic atypia. Lymphovascular invasion (6/22), nodal (3/15) and 
peritoneal (7/22) disease were sometimes seen. Associated endometriosis and/or adenomyosis were frequently present (16/22, 
72.7%).  Mixed carcinomatous component, such as clear cell and endometrioid carcinomas, was identified in 5 cases. Interestingly, 
one MLA derived from ovarian high grade adenosarcoma (Figure 1), and one MLA was a component of endometrial 
carcinosarcoma (Figure 2). Variable TTF1, GATA3 and CD10 positivity was present in 72.7% (16/22), 100% (21/21) and 81.0% 
(17/21) cases. ER expression was observed in 33.3% (7/21) cases, mostly focal and weak. Immunohistochemistry of DNA

mismatch repair proteins was performed in 9 cases and all showed normal expression, confirmed with microsatellite stability in 5 
cases. KRAS or NRAS mutations were identified in 3 cases by next generation sequencing.

Background: Inflammatory myofibroblasic tumor of the female genital tract (FGT-IMT) is extremely rare. Herein, we reported the 
largest series of FGT-IMT to further investigate its clinicopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular features. 
Design: We collected 47 cases of FGT-IMT diagnosed in the Department of Pathology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center 
since 2015. Clinical and follow-up data were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and 
RNA-sequencing were performed. 
Results: The median age at diagnosis was 43 years (range,23-65y). 39 cases occurred in the uterine corpus, 5 cases in the 
uterine cervix and 3 cases in the abdominal and pelvic cavity. 44 cases were consultation cases and 3 cases were diagnosed and 
treated in our center. The original pathological diagnosis for consultation was mainly confused with myxoid smooth muscle tumors 
and endometrial stromal tumors. Histologically, the tumors mainly showed loose myxoid and/or fascicular pattern. Tumor cells were 
spindled with mild nuclear atypia and variable mitotic figures were found. Epithelioid cells were present in some areas. The density 
and distribution of the inflammatory cells varied among cases, even could be inconspicuous. Tumor cells were positive for desmin, 
SMA, ALK, ER, PR and Ki-67(median,10%). 87.9% (29/33) of cases showed ALK rearrangement by FISH tests. RNA-seq was 
performed in 16 cases. The gene fusion pattern included IGFBP5-ALK(n=6), FN1-ALK(n=2), TIMP3-ALK(n=2), THBS1-ALK(n=2), 
TNS1-ALK(n=1), ROS1-TFG(n=1) and ROS1-FN1(n=1). Interestingly, 1 case harbored 3 different fusions (IGFBP5-ALK, TWIST2-
COL6A3 and ACTN4-AKT2). 41 patients had follow-up information (range,1.2-86.5mo.; median,30.97mo.). 6 patients experienced 
local recurrence and 3 of them received Crizotinib as subsequential treatment, 2 patients died of the disease and 1 patient died due 
to high grade serous carcinoma.

Conclusions: IMT in the female genital tract has been increasingly recognized in recent years. ALK IHC or FISH test can help to 
distinguish them from those morphologically similar tumors. A small number of uterine IMT have ROS1 translocation, and our study 
reported a new ROS1-TFG gene fusion in uterine IMT. For ALK negative tumors, it is important to perform ROS1 IHC and/or 
molecular analysis. Since aggressive behavior can be presented in some IMTs, recognition of this rare mesenchymal neoplasm is 
crucial.
