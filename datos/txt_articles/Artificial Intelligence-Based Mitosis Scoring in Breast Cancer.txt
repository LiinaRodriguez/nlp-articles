In recent years, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated exceptional performance in mitosis
identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation. However, the implementation of AI in clinical practice needs to be
evaluated against the existing methods. This study is aimed at assessing the optimal method of
using AI-based mitotic ﬁgure scoring in breast cancer (BC). We utilized whole slide images from a
large cohort of BC with extended follow-up comprising a discovery (n ¼ 1715) and a validation (n ¼
859) set (Nottingham cohort). The Cancer Genome Atlas of breast invasive carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA)
cohort (n ¼ 757) was used as an external test set. Employing automated mitosis detection, the
mitotic count was assessed using 3 different methods, the mitotic count per tumor area (MCT;
calculated by dividing the number of mitotic ﬁgures by the total tumor area), the mitotic index (MI;
deﬁned as the average number of mitotic ﬁgures per 1000 malignant cells), and the mitotic activity
index (MAI; deﬁned as the number of mitotic ﬁgures in 3 mm2 area within the mitotic hotspot).
These automated metrics were evaluated and compared based on their correlation with the well-
established visual scoring method of the Nottingham grading system and Ki67 score, clinicopath-
ologic parameters, and patient outcomes. AI-based mitotic scores derived from the 3 methods (MCT,
MI, and MAI) were signiﬁcantly correlated with the clinicopathologic characteristics and patient
survival (P < .001). However, the mitotic counts and the derived cutoffs varied signiﬁcantly between
the 3 methods. Only MAI and MCT were positively correlated with the gold standard visual scoring
method used in Nottingham grading system (r ¼ 0.8 and r ¼ 0.7, respectively) and Ki67 scores (r ¼
0.69 and r ¼ 0.55, respectively), and MAI was the only independent predictor of survival (P < .05) in
multivariate Cox regression analysis. For clinical applications, the optimum method of scoring
mitosis using AI needs to be considered. MAI can provide reliable and reproducible results and can
accurately quantify mitotic ﬁgures in BC.

Introduction
Tumor proliferation has proven to be one of the most powerful
prognostic factors, and it is essential for determining a patient’s
prognostic risk.1-3 In breast cancer (BC), proliferation is assessed
by counting mitotic ﬁgures in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-
stained sections, which is a critical component of the Nottingham
grading system and a well-recognized histomorphologic predictor
of outcome.4-6
The introduction of digital pathology allowed the use of auto-
mated tools for quantifying mitotic ﬁgures in scanned slides, which
can provide an aid to pathologists in routine practice.7,8 In recent
years, the performance of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) algorithms has
shown marked improvement, which is comparable to that of expert
pathologists, adding more consistency in detecting mitotic ﬁgures.9,10
However, to validate the use of such algorithms in routine
practice, not only the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of detecting
mitotic ﬁgures are essential but also the method of scoring has to
be established and validated to best represent the proliferative
activity of the tumor. The identiﬁcation of the most prognostically
relevant mitosis scoring technique is an area that requires further
study and investigation.
Different techniques have been proposed to visually estimate
mitotic counts, and these include mitotic index (MI), mitotic activity
index (MAI), and mitotic count per tumor (MCT).8However, MI is
commonly deﬁned as the ratio of mitotic cells to nonmitotic cells of
a tumor and is reported as a percentage or the number of mitoses
per 1000 neoplastic cells.11 Because it is not region-speciﬁc, it
overcomes challenges associated with differences in tumoral
cellularity, intratumoral stroma, and cell size; however, its useful-
ness in routine practice is less well studied and is restricted by the
fact that it is exceedingly laborious and time-consuming.8 MAI, on
the other hand, is described as the number of mitotic ﬁgures in a
speciﬁed area of a tumor, chosen as having the highest number of
mitotic ﬁgures (hotspot),12 and it is provided as an index (mitotic
count/area).3,11,13 In BC, using conventional light microscopes, the
optimal area size is that of 10 high-power ﬁelds (HPF), but it varies
based on the diameter of the microscope ﬁeld.12 Most modern
microscopes have a ﬁeld diameter of approximately 0.055 mm,
with 10 HPF covering an area of 2.37 mm2.8 In a previous study to
deﬁne the area of mitoses counting, 3 mm2 was reported as the
optimal area associated with high reproducibility and outcome
correlation.14 This method is time efﬁcient and often reﬂects the
most replicative capacity of the tumor,12 despite the interobserver
variation in the selection of these areas.15 Finally, MCT is often
expressed as the number of mitoses per area occupied by invasive
tumor cells, rather than the number of mitoses per speciﬁc area or
HPF, which could alleviate the subjectivity of area selection.16,17
Nevertheless, none of these methods has been proven to outper-
form the others in a large-scale study.
This study aimed to determine the optimal mitosis scoring
method in BC and evaluate the performance of the automated
mitotic score for survival prediction compared with visual scores.
We provide an insight into the feasibility of using automated
mitosis counting in clinical practice and its potential advantages
over visual scoring.
Material and Methods
Study Cohorts
This study includes 2 separate cohortsdone for discovery and
internal validation and the other one for external multicentric
validation.
Nottingham Cohort
This is a large cohort of primary invasive estrogen receptor-
positive (ERþ)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-
negative (HER2) BC (n ¼ 2574) cases that were diagnosed and
treated at the Nottingham City Hospital, Nottingham, United
Kingdom. Ninety-three percent of the patients received endocrine
therapy. Classical treatment of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate,
and 5-ﬂuorouracil was used as a therapy for patients clinically ﬁt
to receive chemotherapy. None of the patients in the current study
cohort received neoadjuvant therapy.
Clinical information and tumor characteristics, including pa-
tient’s age at diagnosis, histologic tumor type, grade, tumor size,
lymph node status, Nottingham prognostic index, and lympho-
vascular invasion were available.18 Data for ER, progesterone re-
ceptor, HER2, and Ki67 were available as previously published.19-
22 Hormonal and HER2 statuses were assessed according to the
American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American
Pathologists guidelines.23 The Ki-67 scoring was evaluated visu-
ally using the global (average) method, following the recom-
mendations of the International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working
Group. A minimum of 3 high-power (40 objective) ﬁelds that
represented the staining spectrum observed in the entire section
were selected, with a particular focus on scoring the invasive tu-
mor edge. Data from hotspots were incorporated into the overall
score, and only nuclear staining was considered positive, with
staining intensity not taken into account. Ideally, at least 1000
malignant invasive cells were considered for scoring24 and were
deﬁned as high when 14% of tumor cells showed nuclear
positivity.25
The outcome data collected for the study included BC-speciﬁc
survival (BCSS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and
recurrence-free survival (RFS), all measured in months. BCSS was
deﬁned as the time from the date of primary surgical treatment
until the time of death due to BC, DMFS was deﬁned as the time
from surgery until the ﬁrst event of distant metastasis, and RFS
was deﬁned as the time from surgical resection until disease
recurrence.
Pseudonymized patient tissue samples were provided. One
representative
tissue
block
(formalin-ﬁxed
and
parafﬁn-
embedded), with adequate tumor tissue, was chosen per case.
Four-micrometer-thick, full-face tumor sections were cut and
stained with H&E. The slides were scanned with a Philips UFS
scanner with 0.25 mm/pixels at 40 and Pannoramic 250 Flash III:
3DHistech (0.19 mm/pixel), generating high-quality whole slide
images (WSIs).
The Nottingham cases were divided into a discovery set
(n ¼ 1715) and a validation set (n ¼ 859), based on stratiﬁed
random distribution of events (Supplementary Fig. S1). In the
discovery cohort, the median survival duration was 89 months
(IQR, 37.3-179), whereas in the validation group, the median
survival duration was 71.3 months (IQR, 51.9-124.9). The cutoff
values generated in the discovery set were applied to the
internal validation and external test sets.
The Cancer Genomic Atlas Breast Cancer Cohort
In this study, the BC cohort of 757 cases from the Cancer
Genomic Atlas (https://www.cancer.gov/tcga) was used as an
external test set The Cancer Genome Atlas of breast invasive car-
cinoma (TCGA-BRCA).26 H&E images were obtained from excision
specimens and scanned using various scanners from different
institutions across the United States. To ensure the reliability of
our analysis, we implemented a quality control measure and
excluded images with very low quality, we carefully selected 757
cases, speciﬁcally focusing on those with the best available image

quality. WSIs were downloaded from the genomic data commons
(GDC) data portal https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/.27 Clinical data
were available from the https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/, https://
www.cbioportal.org/,
https://ucsc-xena.gitbook.io/project/.27-30
Comprehensive clinical data including age, tumor size, grade
and its components, histologic tumor subtypes, pathological
stage, ER/progesterone receptor status, lymphovascular invasion,
and Ki67 score were extracted from the TCGA cohort. Overall
survival and RFS data were also included in the analysis where
median survival time was 31 months (IQR, 17-60 months).
Algorithm Development
Annotations
In order to create machine learning (ML) models for mitosis
detection, cell-level annotations were made. A group of 6
certiﬁed pathologists from Nottingham were provided with an
online annotation software, called WASABI.31 This application
offers specialized modes that are designed to facilitate the
annotation of WSIs. Pathologists were responsible for per-
forming the primary annotations of various phases and mor-
phologies of mitotic ﬁgures (prophase, metaphase, anaphase,
and telophase, as well as atypical mitotic ﬁgures), in addition to
identifying mimickers such as lymphocytes, stromal cells, and
artifacts.
Two pathologists were assigned to independently annotate
mitotic ﬁgures for each WSI in a blinded manner, (A.I. and A.K.) as
previously described.31-33 Any ambiguous cases or disagreements
were re-evaluated by another pathologist to establish a consensus
label. Through this approach (as depicted in Fig.1A), a total of 7916
mitotic ﬁgures were manually annotated.
Mitosis Detection Algorithm
The method used for mitosis detection follows a well-
established 2-stage framework developed by Jahanifar et al.34
The framework consists of mitosis candidate segmentation and
candidate reﬁnement stages (Fig. 1B). The ﬁrst stage uses a fast
and accurate convolutional neural network to segment mitotic
candidates. To train the segmentation network, a mitosis mask
was generated based on pathologist point annotations and an
interactive annotation tool called NuClick.35 In the second stage,
the candidate reﬁnement is performed using a deeper classiﬁer
network. Both stages are domain-invariant, making the frame-
work robust against domain shift.
The algorithm used in this study has been validated extensively
for the task of mitosis detection from various cancer images
(ranked ﬁrst in Mitosis Domain Generalization Challenges 2021-
20229,10). We have also evaluated the performance of the mitosis
detection algorithm on a data set of 9200 tile images (512  512
pixels in size) as an initial part of the study. This data set was
curated based on visual mitosis and mimicker annotations. Hu-
man correction has also been implemented, where pathologists
with experience in the ﬁeld (A.I., M.T., A.K., and A.L.) reviewed,
corrected, and conﬁrmed the mitotic ﬁgures identiﬁed by the al-
gorithm in a subset of cases. In cross-validation experiments, the
utilized algorithm achieved an F1-score of 0.93, sensitivity of 0.89,
and precision of 0.97, demonstrating high performance in the
mitosis detection task.
Artiﬁcial Intelligence-Assisted Identiﬁcation of Mitotic Hotspot
Regions
A computational framework was developed to objectively
identify regions of mitotic hotspots using a greedy search
algorithm (Fig. 1C). First, the algorithm identiﬁes the tissue region
within each WSI by employing a tissue segmentation convolu-
tional neural network from TIAToolbox.36 Next, it extracts 512 
512 tiles from the tissue region, each with a 50-pixel overlap, at a
resolution of 0.25 microns-per-pixel (equivalent to a 40 objec-
tive magniﬁcation). Then, the method described in the previous
section is applied to detect mitoses in the extracted patches. Once
the detection of mitosis is complete, the algorithm performs an
overlapping window search within the WSI to identify the mitotic
hotspot region, which is deﬁned as the window containing the
highest number of mitoses. The heatmap overlay shown in
Figure 1C indicates windows with high- and low-mitotic counts
with red and blue colors, respectively. Finally, the mitotic score for
the hotspot is calculated according to the method outlined in the
next section.
Mitosis Scoring Approaches
In order to establish the best mitosis scoring approach, the
mitosis detection algorithm was run on the discovery cohort (1725
WSIs), and the number of detected mitotic ﬁgures in each digital
slide was recorded. MCT was determined by dividing the number
of mitotic ﬁgures by the whole tumor size in mm2. Additionally,
MI was computed by ﬁrst utilizing a deep learning-based nuclei
instance identiﬁcation model called HoVer-Net37 to quantify the
number of malignant tumor cells present in the entire slide, fol-
lowed by calculating the average number of mitotic ﬁgures per
1000 malignant cells. Finally, MAI was calculated by counting the
number of mitotic ﬁgures within a 3 mm2 hotspot region of the
slide. The 3 mm2 area was carefully chosen to capture the invasive
carcinoma cells avoiding the inclusion of noninvasive stromal
tissue or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). However, if the hotspot
was near the leading edge, multiple separate annotated areas
collectively measuring 3 mm2 were used.14
The study deliberately used the same mitosis detection algo-
rithm for all 3 scoring systems to ensure an unbiased comparison;
therefore,
we
did
not
detect
systematic
differences
when
comparing different mitosis scoring approaches. The mitosis
scoring techniques were evaluated and compared based on their
correlation with clinicopathologic parameters, the established gold
standard visual scoring method used in clinical practice, Ki67 score,
patient outcome, and chemotherapy prediction.
Measuring the Correlation Between Visual and Automated Mitosis
Detection
To conﬁrm the reliability and reproducibility of automated
mitosis detection, a well-trained pathologist visually counted
mitotic ﬁgures within 3 mm2 in 400 cases from the Nottingham
validation set and 757 from the external validation set as
continuous counts following the proposed scoring method.38
Scoring was carried out blindly. The visual counts were corre-
lated with their parallel automatically generated mitotic counts.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v26 for
Microsoft Windows. The degree of interobserver agreement was
assessed by use of the intraclass correlation coefﬁcient for
continuous data. Cohen’s statistics were used to assess the
concordance between 2 observers for categorical variables,

whereas Fleiss Kappa was used for more than 2 variables/scores.
The correlations between categorical variables were analyzed
using the c2 test. Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient was used to
measure the strength of a linear association between 2 contin-
uous variables. Association with mitosis count and BCSS was
performed after classiﬁcation of expression into high, interme-
diate, and low groups based on the cutoff point obtained from
the
x-tile.39
Survival

determined
using
the
KaplaneMeier method and compared by the log-rank test.
Multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model determined
the inﬂuence of each mitosis scoring technique on survival when
compared with one another. All tests were 2-tailed, and a P value
of <.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Finally, the
automated MAI scores were incorporated with the other 2
components of the Nottingham grading system (tubule forma-
tion and pleomorphism) to develop a grade based on the auto-
mated MAI score.
Results
Evaluating Mitosis Scoring Techniques
Automatically derived mitotic counts using the 3 methods
(MCT, MI, and MAI) were different, and all showed unimodal
distribution. These distributions showed signiﬁcant varia-
tions in the mitotic count of individual cases. The median

for
each
method
is

scores with different cutoff values based on BCSS, using

Correlation With Clinicopathologic Parameters
As reported in Supplementary Tables S2-S4, high values of all
automatically derived mitotic scores (MAI, MCT, and MI) were
signiﬁcantly associated with characteristics of aggressive tumor
behavior including less tubule formation, high nuclear pleomor-
phism, large tumor size, and high Nottingham prognostic index
scores (P < .001).
The same results were observed in the validation cohort when
the same cutoff values (derived from the discovery cohort) were
applied.
Correlation With Ki67 Score
A signiﬁcant positive linear correlation was observed between
the Ki-67 score and both MAI (r ¼ 0.69; P < .001) and MCT (r ¼
0.55; P < .001), but no such correlation was found with MI. Similar
results were observed in the internal validation cohort and
external validation set (Fig. 2).
Correlation With the Well-Established Visual Scoring Method Used
in Clinical Practice (Gold Standard)
As shown in Figure 3A and B, statistically signiﬁcant correla-
tions were observed between pathologist mitotic counts (visual
MAI used in clinical practice) and automated MAI for both the
Nottingham cohort and the TCGA-BRCA cohort (r ¼ 0.8; P < .001),
respectively.
Furthermore, automated MCT showed a signiﬁcant corre-
lation with pathologist mitoses counts (visual MAI, derived
from visually identiﬁed hotspots in clinical practice) with a
Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient of 0.7 (P < .001). This implies
that the automated mitosis detection algorithm performed
reliably on the WSI level as the number of detected mitoses
correlates with the visual mitosis count in the mitotic hotspot
(which is an indicator of mitotic activity in the whole tumor)
(Fig. 3C). On the other hand, there was no signiﬁcant corre-
lation between pathologist mitoses counts and automated MI
(as seen in Fig. 3D)
Prediction of Patient Outcome
Univariate survival analysis revealed that high MCT, MAI, and
MI scores were signiﬁcantly associated with worse BCSS and
shorter DMFS (Supplementary Table S5).
However, high MAI and MCT scores were predictive of BC
recurrence, whereas MI was not (P ¼.07). Detailed results and
Kaplan-Meier survival plots for mitosis scoring methods across
different survival analyses can be found in Figure 4.
Furthermore, a multivariate Cox regression model adjusted for
other prognostic covariates (nuclear pleomorphism, tubule for-
mation, nodal stage, and Ki67 score) revealed that MAI, MCT, and
MI scores were independent predictors of survival as reported in
Table 1, highlighting the signiﬁcance of mitosis score in predicting
the tumor behavior and patient survival.
A multivariate analysis that included all 3 mitosis-related
scores as continuous variables was also conducted. The results
are reported in Table 2, which showed that MAI was an inde-
pendent predictor of survival in terms of BCSS, DMFS, and RFS,
whereas the other 2 scores (MCT and MI) were not.
When various AI-based mitosis scoring methods were evalu-
ated for predicting outcomes in the context of adjuvant chemo-
therapy, all 3 methods were strongly associated with outcomes in
chemotherapy-naive patients. In patients who were given adju-
vant chemotherapy, only MAI remained associated with outcome
(HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.88-2.93; P < .001), whereas MCT and MI lost
their signiﬁcance (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Additionally, as seen from the survival curve, patients with a MAI
score of 2 who received chemotherapy demonstrated improved
outcomes compared with those with a score of 1, whereas patients
with a score of 3 continued to show the worst prognosis.
The results suggest that MAI would be an effective approach in
scoring mitosis during routine diagnosis. Therefore, the following
sections will focus on the use of MAI for clinicopathologic pa-
rameters correlation and survival prediction.
Visual Versus Automated Mitotic Activity Index for
Clinicopathologic Correlation and Survival Prediction
The results from the external test set (Table 3) and the
Nottingham cohort (Supplementary Table S6) revealed a sig-
niﬁcant correlation between aggressive tumor characteristics
and high visual and automated MAI values. Regarding asso-
ciation with the outcome, both automated and visual MAI
were predictors of survival in the Nottingham and TCGA co-
horts,
as

Automated Mitotic Activity Index and Nottingham Grading System
The addition of automated MAI to the tubule formation and
pleomorphism scores in the Nottingham grade was found to have a
signiﬁcant association with BCSS, exhibiting a slightly higher
hazard ratio (HR, 3.305; 95% CI, 2.59-4.21; P < .001) than the
original grade with visual MAI score (HR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.29-3.64; P
< .001) as shown in Figure 5. A cross-comparison between new
grade and conventional grade was conducted using c2 tests, and
we found that they were strongly correlated (c2 ¼ 2990; P < .001).
These results highlight the reliability of using AI-assisted mitosis
scores in clinical practice.
Discussion
Digital pathology (DP) is an emerging ﬁeld that involves
scanning glass slides used for diagnosis into digital images in
clinical settings. Whole slide scanners are used to generate high-
resolution images that can be navigated and analyzed using
specialized software and automated algorithms. DP has the po-
tential to improve the accuracy and efﬁciency of diagnostic pro-
cesses and is being increasingly adopted in medical practice.7 The
introduction of these algorithms has led to numerous attempts by
researchers to enhance and integrate this new technology into
diagnostic processes. As this ﬁeld advances, AI is gradually moving
from a research tool to a clinical application.40 The laborious task
of visually counting mitotic ﬁgures during grading, coupled with
the low level of agreement among pathologists has made it a
suitable target for computer-assisted detection algorithms.41
These detection methods are continually improving at a rapid
pace. However, the ﬁrst priority should be the adoption of
evidence-based and clinically approved protocols. In BC histopa-
thology, mitosis detection on H&E slides has been extensively
researched due to the prognostic value of mitotic density.22
Because it is an essential part of the grading system, accurate
detection of mitotic ﬁgures is crucial for patient care. Several
studies have shown that AI can count mitoses with great preci-
sion,42 which makes it a promising solution to overcome the
challenges of the labor-intensive and subjective nature of visual
mitosis counting. Despite several ways to count mitosis have been
offered in clinical settings, their challenging applicability has
limited their use.8 The adoption of AI-assisted mitosis counting
can improve diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility and facilitate
the incorporation of mitotic density into the grading system.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst large-scale study
that has evaluated different mitosis scoring methods with the help

of an AI mitosis detection algorithm in a clinical setting including 2
separate large BC cohorts. The current study, conducted on a large
cohort of patients, demonstrates that the automated MAI has the
same and, in some cases, greater ability to measure BC proliferative
capacity compared with conventional mitotic count (MCT) and MI.
This ﬁnding is consistent with the results of several other studies,
including those conducted by Diest et al,13 Bostock,43 Wilcock and
Peiffer,44 Baak et al,6 and Jannink et al,45 which have established
mitotic count as a reliable predictor of tumor behavior.
The visual counting of mitotic ﬁgures throughout the whole
tumor has been challenging to implement in practice. As an alter-
native, the MAI has been proposed as a more feasible parameter.45
MAI represents the total number of mitotic ﬁgures counted within a
speciﬁed area, enabling rapid and accurate assessment of tumor
mitotic activity, without considering cellularity. Moreover, in uni-
variate and multivariate analyses of human breast tumors, MAI was
found to be signiﬁcantly associated with prognosis.45
Previous studies concluded that MAI is the preferred index due
to its ease of application, time efﬁciency, and its prognostic value
compared with other indices.
The challenges associated with the manual counting of mitotic
ﬁgures in histopathology have recently come to light as AI tools
are being used to count mitoses in digital WSI.16,19,46
Our results were similar to those of Jannink et al,45 where both
mitotic count and mitoses per area were signiﬁcantly associated in
linear regression with the other proliferation parameters.
The only parameter that takes cellularity into account is MI,
which expresses the number of mitoses as a percentage or
referenced to a speciﬁc number (1000) of cells.47-51 However, it
has been widely criticized for supposed irreproducibility.52
Another drawback of MI is the time-consuming task of counting
cells in each ﬁeld.53 Although there are quicker alternatives such
as speciﬁc formulas54 or image analysis techniques,55 these still
have limitations in their application. With the aid of AI, counting
mitotic ﬁgures can be more easily and accurately performed on a
large number of cases, as demonstrated in our study. However,
tumors with similar values of cellularity do not necessarily need
correction because equal areas may contain similar numbers of
cells, and mitotic activity is only due to the proliferative state, not
cell content. Other studies suggest that correcting the mitotic
count is otherwise unnecessary.45 On the contrary, a correction
might be helpful for those tumors characterized by a high degree
of variability in cellularity.
Our study found that MCT, MI, and MAI scores were all corre-
lated with survival. However, the multivariate Cox regression
analysis revealed that MAI was an independent predictor of sur-
vival. Moreover, only MAI was capable of predicting the outcome
in patients receiving chemotherapy in ERþ/HER2 patients.
Furthermore, the visual evaluation of pathologists was highly
correlated with the mitotic ﬁgure counts obtained by the auto-
mated algorithm.
The 3 parameters expressing mitotic activity were compared
with Ki67, which is a widely accepted proliferation marker, to
assess their performance. The Ki67 score was strongly correlated

high level of agreement. These ﬁndings highlight the reliability
and consistency of these modalities for mitotic counting and BC
grading in clinical practice.56
The use of AI technology for evaluating BC poses the challenge of
standardizing the method for mitosis scoring, which requires
evidence-based studies to determine the best strategy. As AI-based
algorithms for counting mitosis in WSI continue to evolve, they
have the potential to revolutionize the assessment of mitotic ﬁgures
and grading in BC and other diagnostic pathology ﬁelds. To ensure
the effectiveness and reliability of these algorithms, developers
must be familiar with established scoring methods used in BC and
adjust their techniques accordingly to provide the same prognostic
value when incorporated into the ﬁnal histologic grade.
The decision to train AI to produce results similar to human vi-
sual assessment could be perceived as a potential limitation of the
approach taken in this study and that the algorithm never will be
better than human visual assessment. However, the current study
evaluated AI algorithms for mitosis counting not only to achieve
automation and consistency but also the AI algorithm does not
replicate the pathologist error. The algorithm has been trained on a
data set of mitosis annotations that are obtained from the consensus
of multiple pathologists and has demonstrated strong generaliza-
tion to data from different sources. This has been investigated in
Aubreville et al,9 where the proposed mitosis detection algorithm
performed better than 5 individual pathologists in the detection
task. The similarity of AI and visual assessment of mitoses counts is
only an indicator of reliability of using AI-assisted MAI scores in
clinical practice to the same level of pathologist-driven scores.
In the current study, we evaluated the optimal method of
mitosis detection in BC using AI as one of the well-known prog-
nostic markers and is a component of BC grade. DP is increasingly
used and AI algorithms for assessing several morphologic features
including mitosis will become commonplace soon. Our proposed
mitosis scoring pipeline can be encapsulated into a single software
package, and we have implemented a toolbox that accepts the
input from the WSI and runs the whole pipeline on it to detect
mitotic hotspots and estimate MAI. At this stage, MAI can be
combined with visual assessment of tubule formation and pleo-
morphism to form the new grade. However, there is ongoing work
on automated assessment of tubule formation and nuclear pleo-
morphism as well, which can be combined with MAI in our score
(digital grade), but this still needs further reﬁning and validation.

Based on our study, it can be concluded that the application of
ML algorithms in the quantiﬁcation of mitotic ﬁgures is a prom-
ising approach that provides a practical and efﬁcient method for
mitosis scoring in BC patients. The use of these algorithms not
only overcomes the limitations of visual counting, such as inter-
observer variability, but also offers the potential for high-
throughput and automated analysis of large data sets.
In addition, we have found that the updated algorithms pro-
vide valid measures of scoring in BC patients. The performance of
the ML algorithms in the validation cohort demonstrated their
ability to accurately detect mitotic ﬁgures in a manner that is
consistent with visual counting by expert pathologists. This con-
ﬁrms the potential for the use of ML algorithms as a reliable
alternative to visual counting for mitotic scoring in BC.
