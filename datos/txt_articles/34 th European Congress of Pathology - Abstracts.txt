Background & objectives: Chronic atrophic gastritis may con-
tribute to the phenotype of gastric polyps in familial adenomatous 
polyposis (FAP). As the prevalence of Helicobacter-pylori infection 
in Portugal is up to 90%, we aim to characterize gastric polyps in 
a series of Portuguese patients.
Methods: Fifty-six FAP patients followed up at our hospital in 
High-Risk Consultation of Digestive Tumours, from 1992 to 2021 
were retrospectively selected. Thirty-two patients were males 
(57.1%), and the medium age was 52 (range: 26-87). Clinico-
pathological features, with particular emphasis on periodic upper 
endoscopic examinations, were studied. IBM SPSS (Release 27.0) 
was used for statistical analysis.
Results: Our series encompassed 95 gastric polyps, includ-
ing 53 (55.8%) fundic gland polyps (FGPs) without dysplasia 
(n=34) or with dysplasia (n=19) and 42 (44.2%) intestinal-
type adenomas. Half of FAP patients (n=28, 50.0%) devel-
oped endoscopically visible gastric polyps, including FGPs 
in 12 patients (21.4%) and adenomas with or without FGPs 
in 16 patients (28.6%). Foveolar-type adenomas and pyloric 
gland adenomas were not identified in this series. Intestinal-
type adenomas occurred predominantly in the distal stomach 
(62.5%, p=0.031), were larger than 7mm in 9/16 cases (56.3%, 
p=0.03), and were more frequently associated with duodenal 
adenomas (87.5%, p<0.001). Chronic atrophic gastritis and 
intestinal metaplasia was observed in the background mucosa 
in most cases (75.0%, p=0.009).
Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first Western series 
showing high prevalence of intestinal-type adenomas in FAP 
patients, comparable to Asian studies. Chronic atrophic gastri-
tis/intestinal metaplasia are likely responsible for this differ-
ence, with risk of neoplastic transformation and management 
implications. Endoscopists should have a high degree of sus-
picion in FAP patients and low threshold to biopsy/excision of 
gastric polyps, particularly in patients with chronic atrophic 
gastritis/intestinal metaplasia, in those with distal gastric pol-
yps with worrisome features (namely >7mm) and/or duodenal 
adenomas.

*Ankara University School of Med., Turkey
Background & objectives: Uneven distribution of gastric intes-
tinal metaplasia (GIM) may require mapping biopsies rather than 
random biopsies which may fail to reflect the extent of the lesions. 
We, hereby, evaluated the value of mapping in determining the 
extent and severity of IM.
Methods: Random biopsies (RB) obtained according to updated 
Sydney protocol and mapping biopsies (MB) taken from 6 differ-
ent sites of corpus and antrum during surveillance were evaluated 
for the severity and extent of histologic parameters of gastritis, 
mainly focusing on GIM with atrophy in a cohort of 202 patients. 
Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon test on SPSS 
version 22.
Results: Mean age of 202 patients (104 females, 86 males) was 
61.78±11,5 years. Average time interval between RB and MB was 
18 months. There were 98 cases with isolated antral IM and 75 cases 
with isolated corpus IM in RB while MB revealed IM in the cor-
pus in 13 of 98 cases (13.26%) and antral IM in 23 of 75 (30.66%) 
cases. IM at both sites was observed in 17 (8.9%) RB and 31 (16.4%) 
MB which yielded a significant increase by an increment of 1.84 
(p<0.05). Severity of antral IM significantly increased in MB in 28% 
of cases (p<0.05) while no such difference was found for corpus IM.
Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that mapping 
with multiple biopsies improves the detection rate of IM both in the 
corpus and antrum, providing information for the extent and sever-
ity of the lesions. This approach also seems to be useful in cases 
with isolated antral IM in monitoring severity of IM as already dem-
onstrated by MB taken from the antrum in our study. However, large 
prospective, randomized, multicentre studies comparing different 
follow-up strategies are necessary for a better roadmap.

Myths and facts: reflux oesophagitis vs eosinophilic 
oesophagitis
E.K. Çagdas*, N. Aras, C. Ersöz, Ş. Ersöz, Z. Kuloglu, A. Kansu 
Tanca, B. Savaş, A. Ensari
*Ankara University School of Med., Turkey
Background & objectives: Basal cell hyperplasia and papilloma-
tosis are non- discriminatory for eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoO) 
or reflux oesophagitis (RO). The aim here is to clarify the true 
incidence of these features in RO and EoO using morphometry to 
highlight their diagnostic significance.

Methods: A total of 543 RO and 59 EoO cases were re-evaluated 
for basal cell hyperplasia and papillomatosis using an ocular grid 
and basal cell thickness (BCT) and papillary height (PH) were 
measured on H&E stained sections of biopsies with the most severe 
histology. Data were evaluated using one sample t test on SPSS 
version 22. A p<0.05 was considered significant.
Results: EoO group (41 females, 17 males) had a significantly 
younger mean age of 15.25±13.9 (p<0.001) compared to RO (297 
females, 246 males) with a mean age of 37.65±23.6. Papilloma-
tosis was significantly more common in RO (85%) compared to 
EoO (55%) which showed basal cell hyperplasia (12.7% vs 100%) 
significantly more frequently. Morphometrically, BCT was 284 
(25-250) and 153 (25-250) microns, PH was 209.75 (25-975) and 
118.75 (0-325) in RO and EoO, respectively. The ratio of PH/epi-
thelial thickness was significantly (p<0.05) higher (57%) in RO 
than EoO (39%). Although BCT was higher in RO the ratio was 
lower compared to EoO due to epithelial thickness which was much 
higher in RO.
Conclusion: Morphometric analysis allowed more accurate inter-
pretation of papillomatosis and basal cell hyperplasia measured 
as BCT and PH with respect to epithelial thickness. Indeed, pro-
portioning yielded better results in distinguishing RO from EoO. 
The results also showed that basal cell hyperplasia proved to be 
a constant feature of EoO besides eosinophilia. Papillomatosis on 
the other hand is less discriminatory as it can be present in both 
conditions, though more common in RO.

Aherne, E. Ryan, C.J. van de Velde, C.A. Marijnen, G.A. Hospers,

*Radboud university medical centre, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Tumour regression grading (TRG) 
and tumour downstaging are standard methods for examination of 
pathological response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT). 
However, different response patterns can be observed. We investigate 
these response patterns and their clinical relevance in rectal cancer.
Methods: The study included a test and a validation cohort 
consisting of post-CRT rectal cancer patients with adenocarcinoma 
n.o.s and response to the therapy. TRG was established according 
to both CAP and Dworak. Response patterns were scored based 
on the three-step flowchart by two independent observers and 
correlated with pathological features and outcome.
Results: The test and validation cohorts included 236 and 103 
patients respectively. In both cohorts, the predominant response 
pattern was fragmentation (74% vs 66%) and the interobserver 
agreement was excellent (k=0.85). The fragmented pattern pre-
sented with a significantly higher pathological stage (TNM III/
IV: 31% vs 20%; p<0.001), less tumour regression (p=0.001), a 
tendency towards less downstaging (downstaging: 45% vs 65%; 
p=0.06). The shrinkage pattern presented better overall survival 
(OS) (p=0.049) in the test cohort and longer recurrence-free sur-
vival (RFS) (HR 2.85, 95% CI 1.09-7.49, p=0.033) in the vali-
dation cohort. In the regression analysis of combined cohorts, 
pathological stage and Dworak TRG were independent prognostic 
factors of survival.
Conclusion: The heterogeneous nature of tumour response fol-
lowing CRT is reflected in different response patterns, which can 
be scored reproducibly. Fragmentation and shrinkage are the main 
response patterns in rectal cancer with a predominancy of the frag-
mented pattern. This pattern is associated with deeper invasion and 
positive lymph nodes. While not independently associated with 
outcome, knowledge of response pattern can guide future treatment 
decisions, in particular concerning local treatment.

Consultation rate and pathologist diagnostic rate in 6,020 
oesophageal biopsy specimens
R. Cheng, A. Naqvi, C. Finley, M. Bonert*
*Pathology, McMaster University, Canada
Background & objectives: Institution level data analyses can 
supplement case reviews for quality assessment. The objective of 
this project was to characterize the pathology in all institutional 
oesophageal biopsies and assess consultation rate and variation of 
the pathologist diagnostic rate (PDR).
Methods: All in house oesophageal biopsy specimens (EBS) acces-
sion 2011-2020 were extracted, diagnostically categorized with a 
hierarchical string-matching algorithm (HSMA) and tabulated by 
pathologist with documented (informal and/or formal) consulta-
tions. HSMA categorizations were audited by reviewing 200 EBS 
reports. PDR was compared using funnel plots with 95%(p<0.05) 
and 99.9%(p<0.001) confidence intervals (CI) centred on the group 
median diagnostic rate.
Results: The cohort contained 6,020 EBS and the HSMA was 
99% (198/200) accurate. These were 524(8.7%) malignant/tumour, 
34(0.6%) suspicious (SUSP), 72(1.2%) high-grade dysplasia 
(HGD), 78(1.3%) low-grade dysplasia (LGD), 65(1.1%) indefinite 
for dysplasia (IFD). The malignant/tumour were 339(5.6%) ade-
nocarcinoma (ADN), 162(2.7%) squamous carcinoma(SCC), and 
23(0.4%) other tumour(OTH). The consultation rates were 22.7%, 
15.4%, 34.8%, 61.8%, 56.9%, 25.6%, 24.6% for ADN/SCC/OTH/
SUSP/HGD/LGD/IFD respectively, and 5.6% (339/6,020) for all 
EBS. Thirteen pathologists interpreted >150 EBS each (158-626) 
and together saw 5,243. The number of 95%/99.9% CI outliers were 
3/1, 2/0, 1/0, 4/2, 4/4, 1/0, 5/4 for ADN/SCC/OTH/SUSP/HGD/
LGD/IFD respectively. Intestinal metaplasia (IM) (818), eosino-
philic esophagitis (EE)(293) and gastroesophageal reflux (GERD)
(897) had 9/4, 3/1 and 12/7 outliers respectively.
Conclusion: The funnel plots demonstrated moderate to poor PDR 
similarity on malignant, pre-malignant and benign diagnoses. 
Reviews are most frequent at the benign-malignant interface. The 
relative rarity, and PDR variation support the recommendation 
for reviewing all HGD. Concordance for benign diagnoses 
(with the exception of EE) likely can be improved significantly. 
Observational data can be useful for quality assessment and for 
helping guide quality improvement efforts.

Endoscopic biopsies in the diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma 
– is it quantity or quality?
K. Teo*, M. Elgoweini
*University Hospital Crosshouse, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Endoscopic biopsy is required not only 
for definitive diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma (CRC), but also for 
additional molecular tests. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship 
between the number of biopsies taken and diagnostic accuracy in 
our hospital.
Methods: A search was performed on the departmental database 
for colonic biopsies obtained for suspected CRC between March 
and October 2021. Data was then retrieved from both endoscopy 
and pathology reports.
Results: In total 135 cases were identified and 68% of them had 
≥6 biopsies taken. Initial biopsies were reported as invasive 
malignancy in 101(74.8%) and the remaining 34(29.4%) reported as

suspicious of malignancy (19), dysplasia (12) and normal/other(3). 
Of the 101 cases with confirmed CRC, 73.7% had ≥6 biopsies 
and 26.3% had <6 biopsies. Of the 34 cases without a definite 
diagnosis, 55.9% had ≥6 biopsies. Repeat procedure was required 
for diagnostic purposes in 10 cases, 4 of which already had ≥6 
initial biopsies taken. For molecular testing, estimated tumour 
content was provided in 57% of confirmed cases. Cases with <6 
or ≥6 biopsies had comparable tumour content of 37% and 38% 
respectively.
Conclusion: In the majority of cases, the number of biopsies taken 
for suspected CRC at our hospital is in line with ESGE recommen-
dations. Our findings suggest that the quality of targeted biopsies 
is also relevant, as a definite diagnosis was achieved in more than 
quarter of cases with less than 6 initial biopsies. Furthermore, more 
than half of initial unconfirmed cases met the recommended num-
ber of 6. In addition, the number of biopsies taken does not appear 
to affect tumour content.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition and α-SMA expression 
in the tumour microenvironment: role in tumour stroma 
composition and association with prognosis in colorectal cancer
R. Souza da Silva*, F.F.N. Gomes, J.P. Andrade, L.E.d.M. Barbosa, 
D.S.G. Silva
*Universidade Federal da Paraíba, Brazil
Background & objectives: The epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
is characterized by increased expression of mesenchymal markers 
and 
plays an essential role in promoting tumour invasion and metas-
tasis. We analysed the association between overall survival and 
α-SMA expression in colorectal cancer (CRC).
Methods: The TSR in colorectal adenocarcinoma was cat-
egorized into 2 groups: ≤50%- low stroma and >50%- high 
stroma. The immunohistochemical expression of α-SMA 
was observed in cancer cells (CCs) and cancer-associated 
fibroblasts (CAFs) present in different tumour areas: estima-
tive stromal (ES), invasion front and desmoplastic stroma. 
α-SMa immunostaining >10% was defined as positive. The 
association between α-SMA expression and overall survival 
was evaluated.
Results: A total of 158 cases were analysed, with 54% of the 
tumours presenting stroma high. Positive immunostaining of 
α-SMA was detected, in CCs and CAFs, in 80.3% of cases. Stroma-
high tumours showed increased expression of α-SMA. Cancer cells 
with expression of α-SMA were observed in 59.6% of cases. CAFs 
expressing α-SMA were found in 87.2% of the cases, higher posi-
tivity was observed predominantly in the ES and invasion front 
areas: 88.9% and 86.7% of cases, respectively. The positive immu-
nostaining observed in CCs and CAFs present in the area of stro-
mal estimation showed correspondence with death outcome. The 
high expression of α-SMA, in CAFs present in the invasion front 
and in the desmoplastic stroma, was associated with lower overall 
survival.
Conclusion: The α-SMA is a mesenchymal biomarker related to 
the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and is highly expressed in 
different tumour areas of the CRC, which are associated with a 
worse prognosis. Cancer cells and CAFs show high expression 
of α-SMA. The immunoexpression of this biomarker showed cor-
respondence with the death outcome. In CRC, high expression of 
α-SMA in CAFs is associated with shorter overall survival.

Digital spatial profiling and proteomics identifies differences 
in biological phenotypes of tumour deposits and lymph node 
metastases in colorectal cancer
N. Brouwer*, L. Webbink, S. van Lent-van Vliet, P. Jansen, R. 
Geene, I. Nijman, F. Simmer, D. Tauriello, M. Vermeulen, I. 
Nagtegaal
*Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Centre, 
The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Both lymph node metastases (LNM) 
and tumour deposits (TD) are currently included in nodal staging 
of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, knowledge regarding the 
biological background of these biomarkers is lacking, which is 
essential in understanding their role in CRC spread.
Methods: Spatial profiling was performed on TD and LNM from 
10 CRC patients using 1,800 RNA targets, and segmentation for 
tumour and tumour microenvironment (TME). From 10 other CRC 
patients, one TD and LNM were included for filter aided shotgun 
proteomics, identifying 5,578 differentially expressed proteins. 
Differences in RNA and protein expression were visualized using 
heatmaps, volcano plots, and enrichment analyses.
Results: Digital spatial profiling showed distinct transcriptome 
profiles between TD and LNM. The most significant results were 
found for the TME where TD showed a more tumour support-
ive environment (e.g., overexpression of SFRP2, COMP, THBS1, 
COL11A1, FN1) compared to LNM. Enrichment analyses showed 
enrichment of focal adhesion, proteoglycans in cancer, and ECM-
receptor interaction in the TD (p<0.05), using the KEGG pathways, 
and the hallmark of epithelial mesenchymal transition (p<0.05), 
using the Molecular Signatures Databases (MSigDB). The prot-
eomics analyses of 10 other CRC patients validated the transcrip-
tome results from the digital spatial profiling, with largely over-
lapping expression profiles as well as similar enriched pathways.
Conclusion: This study shows that TD have a distinct and more 
invasive phenotype compared to LNM on both the RNA and protein 
level. The most pronounced differences were found in the TME, 
which was more pro-tumorigenic in TD. Furthermore, the hallmark 
of epithelial mesenchymal transition was enriched in TD compared 
to LNM. These results show that TD are biologically distinct from 
LNM and give insight into the heterogeneity of different modes of 
locoregional spread in CRC.

Extraappendiceal goblet cell carcinoid like amphicrine tumours 
of GI tract: a long known, not routinely used entity, associated 
with aggressive behaviour
Z.B. Erdem*, H.E. Pasaoglu, E. Yarikkaya, M. Cin, T.B. Özcan, H. 
Dincer, H. Bektas, N. Dursun Kepkep
*Basaksehir Cam and Sakura City Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Amphicrine tumours are a rare group 
of tumours in which single tumour cells coexist both epithelial and 
neuroendocrine differentiation. This entity is included in the 5th 
WHO classification of appendiceal tumours, but it is not included 
in other organ classifications.
Methods: Total of 24 gastrointestinal (GI) carcinomas showing 
amphicrine features reported between January,2016 and Febru-
ary,2022 were retrieved from pathology files. Cases that didn’t 
express at least two neuroendocrine markers and whose appendix 
weren’t examined for the primary tumour presence (histopatho-
logically or radiologically) were excluded from the study. Twenty 
non-amphicrine GI-carcinomas reported at the same time interval 
were randomly selected to compare tumour stages.
Results: Of the 24 patients 13 were female and 11 were male; 
mean age was 59 (22 to 72 years). Tumour localizations were

as follows: 8 gastric-antrum, 2 gastric-cardia, 2 ampullary-
duodenum, 10 ascending colon, 2 transvers colon. On micro-
scopic examination of tumours the most prominent feature that 
attracted our attention was that majority of the cases (20 out 
of 24) formed at least focal crypt-like structures formed by 
signet ring-like cells in either myxoid(mostly) or desmoplas-
tic stroma. Remaining 4 cases showed conventional intestinal 
carcinoma morphology with amphicrine immunophenotype. 
Another significant finding was the presence of multiple lymph 
node metastases and advanced stage disease in all of the cases, 
except for four cases.
Conclusion: Despite the fact that this entity is not included in the 
current WHO classification of GI organs other than appendix, they 
usually present in advanced stages and exhibit aggressive behav-
iour. In most, if not all, amphicrine tumours have characteristic 
morphologic clues (crypt-like structures formed by signet-ring-like 
cells) and clinical features(83% of the lower-GI cases on ascending 
colon). These clues can be defined clearly, and the terminology 
should be used in daily practice in order to assure an adequate 
therapy in a timely manner.

Mismatch repair protein and microsatellite instability status 
in gastric cancer: a comparative study between endoscopic 
biopsies and surgical specimens

*Department of Pathology, Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São 
João; Faculty of Medicine of University of Porto (FMUP); i3S - 
Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde da Universidade do 
Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Evaluation of mismatch repair protein 
(MMR) and microsatellite instability (MSI) status is of utmost 
importance for the management of gastric cancer (GC) patients. 
Aim: to assess if MMR/MSI-status in surgical specimens (SSs) may 
be predicted accurately in endoscopic biopsies (EBs).
Methods: One-hundred GC cases with EBs and respective SSs 
were selected retrospectively from two institutions between 2004 
and 2015. Both EBs and SSs were evaluated for MMR-status by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and classified as MMR-proficient 
(MMRp) or deficient (MMRd). Cases were also classified for MSI-
status by ­IdyllaTM and Bethesda panel (five mononucleotide mark-
ers) as microsatellite stable (MSS) or unstable (MSI-high).
Results: Sixty-three patients were submitted to surgery alone, 
while 37 patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In SSs, 
64/100 cases (64%) were MMRp and 36/100 (36%) were MMRd 
by IHC; 72/100 (72%) were MSS and 28/100 (28%) were MSI-high 
by ­IdyllaTM. In SSs, no cases classified as MMRp were MSI-high, 
but 21/100 cases (21%) were reported as MMRd by IHC and MSS 
by ­IdyllaTM. MSI-status, evaluated by ­IdyllaTM, was concordant 
to the gold-standard Bethesda panel in 64/65 SSs (98.5%). When 
comparing EBs and SSs, only 5/100 cases (5%) were discordant 
by IHC (k=0.889%, sensitivity=88.9%, specificity=98.4%), while 
14/100 cases (14%) were discordant by ­IdyllaTM (k=0.620, sensitiv-
ity=60.1%, specificity=95.8%).
Conclusion: High concordance rate was found when comparing 
EBs and SSs for MMR-status by IHC, suggesting that we can rely 
on the immunohistochemical evaluation of EBs when assessing GC 
cases before surgery/neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The few discord-
ant cases (n=5) may be explained by insufficient tumour sampling 
to account for GC heterogeneity (4/5 had ≤2 EBs), and/or neo-
adjuvant chemotherapy (used in 3/5 patients). Although ­IdyllaTM 
reliably evaluated MSI-status in SSs, as compared to gold-standard, 
it doesn’t seem to accurately identify MSI-status in EBs.

Which is which? Autoimmune (H. pylori) gastritis
N. Aras*, E.K. Çagdas, S. Kurt, B. Savas, A. Ensari
*Ankara University Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Pyloric metaplasia(PM) and neuroen-
docrine-cell hyperplasia(NCH) are common features of autoim-
mune gastritis(AIG), but are also seen in HP-gastritis leading to 
diagnostic difficulty. Co-ocurrence of two complicates their dis-
tinction. We aimed to evaluate features useful in the differential 
diagnosis when overlaps occur.
Methods: Total of 123 cases of gastritis comprising 77 AIG 
cases(group1) with normal/reactive antrum, 30 cases of HP-gas-
tritis with concurrent atrophy and metaplasia in the corpus and 
antrum(group 2), and 16 cases with AIG-like changes in the cor-
pus, and atrophy and/or IM in the antrum(group 3) were reevalu-
ated for updated Sydney parameters, PM and NCH. Chi-square test 
was used for statistics.
Results: Though all cases in group1 and 3 had inflamed cor-
pus, severe chronic inflammation was significantly (p=0.03) 
higher in group 1(71.4%) compared to group3(37%) while activ-
ity of group3(43.7%) was significantly higher (p<0.001) than 
group1(25,8%). Atrophy was significantly (p=0.026) higher 
in group2(86.6%) than group3 (50%) similar to IM (100% and 
93,75 in groups 2 and 3, %, respectively). NCH was present in 
80,5% of all cases and was significantly more common (p<0.001) 
in group3(100%) than group2(23.3%). PM, on the other hand, 
was seen in %77 of all cases and its frequency was significantly 
higher(p=0.002) in group1 (%85.7) compared to groups 2 and 3 
(56.6%, 75%, respectively).
Conclusion: Inflammation, both active and chronic, not differing 
between HP-gastritis with(group3) or without(group2) features of 
AIG, suggest that overlaps do indeed exist. As expected, IM and 
atrophy were more severe in HP-gastritis compared to HP-gastritis 
with features of AIG in contrast to NCH and PM which were more 
predominantly observed in AIG or HP-gastritis with such features. 
These, taken together, support the idea of incorporating PM and/
or NCH into the Sydney system of gastritis for accurate diagnosis, 
treatment of overlapping cases.

Systemic neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in colorectal cancer: 
differences in systemic cytokine profile and immune effector 
cell populations

*Pathology and Data Analytics, Leeds Institute of Medi-
cal Research, School of Medicine, University of Leeds, United 
Kingdom
Background & objectives: A raised pre-operative neutrophil-
to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is correlated with poorer outcomes in 
colorectal cancer (CRC). We assessed the plasma cytokine pro-
files and immune effector cell populations of NLR<5 and NLR>5 
groups in operable CRC to establish a mechanism for this.
Methods: Patients undergoing elective bowel resection for CRC 
were prospectively recruited. Preoperative plasma from 47 patients 
underwent cytokine analysis by multiplex fluid-phase immu-
noassay. A second group of 33 patients was recruited for flow

cytometric evaluation of full blood count for immune cell popula-
tion assessment.
Results: The NLR>/=5 group showed significant depression of 
some T -cell subgroups, activated natural killer cells and eosino-
phils and significant elevation of memory B cells and neutrophils. 
Significant depression of the cytokines IL-2, IL-1β, IL-7, IL-13, 
basic FGF, IFN-γ and MIP-1α occurred in the NLR>/=5 group
Conclusion: The down regulation of IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL7, involved 
in immunoregulation in the NLR>5 group suggests the failure of 
a coherent, T-cell driven, Th1-polarised response to cancer. The 
pan-T cell lymphocytopaenia seen in the NLR>5 group dem-
onstrates an inappropriate T-cell driven immune response to 
tumour. The increased neutrophilia seen in the NLR≥5 group 
may relate to tumour microenvironmental factors that make them 
pro-tumourigenic.

An innovative artificial intelligence based application 
for the differentiation of invasive adenocarcinoma from 
pseudoinvasion in colorectal polyps

*Department of Laboratory Medicine and Molecular Diagnostics, 
Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Canada
Background & objectives: Dysplastic glands misplaced in the 
submucosa (pseudoinvasion) of colorectal polyps sometimes can-
not be differentiated from invasive adenocarcinoma, even by expert 
pathologists. We are developing an innovative application to dif-
ferentiate invasive adenocarcinoma from pseudoinvasion on whole-
slide images (WSI).
Methods: Under low power (x2) magnification, we trained the 
algorithm to identify areas of interest (dysplastic glands) on WSI. 
Using our images and NCT-CRC-HE-100K datasets, we developed 
a combined non-patch and patch-based algorithm to identify 12 
morphological categories in differentiating pseudoinvasion from 
invasive adenocarcinoma (true invasion). We used two models 
to aggregate the per-patch/area classification results into a final 
classification.
Results: Slides from 130 colon polyps (70 pseudoinvasion and 60 
true invasion) were digitized. Low power detection successfully 
identified all areas of interest. The convolutional neural network 
(CNN) model achieved an overall accuracy of 98% in recognizing 
and classifying each area/patch into categories. Based on the 9 
categories currently completed, the linear model and the 3-layer 
CNN model show accuracy rates of 83% and 88% respectively in 
the final classification (true versus pseudoinvasion).
Conclusion: Our AI based application mimics how pathologists 
work and has achieved reliable results with 9 of 12 categories 
used. We are confident that with the other 3 categories added into 
the algorithm, reliability will be increased. The algorithm will be 
validated using another 60 cases and diagnostic accuracy will be 
compared with expert GI pathologists blinded to the results. The 
application will be available on our website for pathologists to 
access worldwide (http://ai4path.ca/).

Background & objectives: The diagnosis of Lynch syndrome 
(LS) is challenging. We investigated whether the detection of 
MMR-deficient non-neoplastic intestinal crypts could be helpful 
in patients with inconclusive germline mutation studies of MMR 
genes (Lynch-like syndrome; LLS) or variants of uncertain sig-
nificance (VUS).
Methods: We evaluated the expression of MMR proteins in non-neo-
plastic mucosa of colorectal cancers from patients with LS (n=15), 
including 7 with multiple CRCs (mRCCs), LLS (n=7) and VUS (n=7). 
Ten immunohistochemistry (IHC) slides were performed on 1 or 2 
blocks of both adjacent (adj-muc) and distant (dist-muc) mucosa. A 
crypt ratio (number of dMMR crypts/total number of crypts) was 
determined.
Results: dMMR crypts were identified in 12/15 patients with LS 
(80%). dMMR crypts tended to be more frequently observed in 
dist-muc [11/15 (73%) vs 8/14 (57%), p=0.157], and in mRCC [7/7 
(100%) vs 5/8 (63%), p=0.244]. The ratio of dMMR crypts was 
significantly higher in patients with mCRC [mCRC-ratio = 0.00337 
vs non-mCRC-ratio = 0.0005 (p=0.003)]. A minimum number of 
n=8 IHC slides analysed in adj-muc and n=6 slides in dist-muc 
identified all patients with dMMR crypts and 66.7% and 91.7% 
respectively of all patients with LS. dMMR crypts were identified 
in 1/7 patients with LLS (14%) and in 4/7 patients with VUS (57%).
Conclusion: The detection of dMMR crypts, with a minimum 
number of 6 IHC slides in dist-muc, could be an integral part of 
the decision-making algorithm for the diagnosis of LS in patients 
with LLS or VUS.

of Pathology, France
Background & objectives: Tumour budding (Bd) is an emerging 
prognostic biomarker in colon cancer (CC). We explored further 
the significance of Bd for risk stratification by evaluating survival 
of stage III CC patients included in the IDEA-France phase III trial.
Methods: Bd was assessed on scanned HE-stained slides and 
scored by central review by the Bd criteria of the 2016 Interna-
tional Tumour Budding Consensus Conference (ITBCC2016) and 
classified as Bd1 (0-4 buds/0.785 mm2), Bd2 (5-9 buds), and Bd3 
(≥10 buds) categories. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall 
survival (OS) were analysed by log-rank test. Clinicopathologic 
features and Immunoscore® were correlated with Bd.
Results: Samples of 1048 CC patients were analysed. Overall, Bd1, 
Bd2, and Bd3 were observed in 39%, 28%, and 33% of CC, respec-
tively. Bd2 and Bd3 were associated with vascular (P = .002) and

perineural invasions (P =.0009). The 3-year DFS and the 5-year OS 
rates for Bd (1 versus 2-3) was of 79.4% versus 67.2% (P=.001) and 
89.2% versus 80.8% (P=.001), respectively. This was confirmed 
after adjustment for relevant clinicopathological features for DFS 
(HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.77; P =.003) and OS (HR, 1.65; 
95% CI 1.22 to 2.22; P = .001). When combined with pTN stage 
and Immunoscore subgroups, Bd significantly improved disease 
prognostication.
Conclusion: Bd demonstrated its independent prognostic value for 
DFS and OS. Given these findings, Bd per the ITBCC 2016 should 
be mandatory in every pathology report in stage III CC patients. Bd 
and Immunoscore could play a complementary role in personalized 
healthcare in this setting.

Consensus based recommendations for the diagnosis of Serous 
Tubal Intraepithelial Carcinoma; an international Delphi study

Hullu, J. van der Laak, M. Simons
*Radboud University Medical Centre, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Diagnosis of Serous Tubal Intraepi-
thelial Carcinoma (STIC), a precursor lesion to high-grade serous 
carcinoma, has moderate reproducibility. We aim to inventory cri-
teria for STIC diagnosis among gynaecopathologists and formulate 
consensus based recommendations.
Methods: We invited 70 gynaecopathologists to a 3 round Delphi 
study. The first round consisted of open ended questions concern-
ing their diagnostic process. The answers of round 1 were used to 
formulate 64 statements. In the subsequent rounds, participants were 
asked to rate their level of agreement with these statements, using 
a 9-point Likert-scale, ranging from fully disagree to fully agree.
Results: Gynaecopathologists participating in this study (n=34, 49%) 
scored 64 statements, subdivided in topics: tissue handling, morphologi-
cal criteria, immunohistochemical staining and reporting recommenda-
tions. Consensus was reached for 27/64 (42%) statements, such as: each 
fallopian tube has to have the fimbriated end fully embedded; nuclear 
pleomorphism, nuclear enlargement, high nuclear to cytoplasmatic ratio 
and nuclear hyperchromasia are morphological criteria that need to be 
present for diagnosing STIC; P53 and Ki67 staining only have to be 
performed in case a STIC is considered based on morphology; WT1, 
CyclinE, STMN1 and p16 have no added value in diagnosing STIC.
Conclusion: We describe current practices concerning STIC diag-
nostics among 34 gynaecopathologists and present a list of 27 rec-
ommendations based on consensus vote. Consistent and reproduc-
ible STIC diagnostics is important, as it holds prognostic value for 
individual patients. Moreover, it is a prerequisite to safely offer 
alternative risk reducing surgical interventions to women who are 
at an increased risk of ovarian carcinoma within the protection of 
a clinical trial. The recommendations from this study contribute to 
further standardization of the diagnostic process.

Endocervical endometrioid adenocarcinoma: clinicopathologic 
characterisation of a rare human papillomavirus-independent 
tumour type

*Toronto General Hospital, Canada
Background & objectives: Endocervical endometrioid 
adenocarcinoma (EEA) is a rare human papillomavirus (HPV)-
independent tumour type included in the 2020 World Health 
Organization Classification of cervical adenocarcinoma. Due 
to its apparent rarity, this entity has been poorly characterised 
in the literature to date.
Methods: EEAs that fulfilled the following strict criteria were col-
lected from multiple institutions: presence of confirmatory endo-
metrioid features; surgically treated; exclusion of endometrial or 
ovarian origin; negative high risk HPV by in situ hybridization or 
polymerase chain reaction. Demographic, pathologic and follow up 
information, if available, was recorded for each case.
Results: There were 14 patients with a median age of 56 years 
(range 30-74 years). Endometriosis and areas of mesonephric(-like) 
differentiation were seen each in 2 cases (one tumour had both). 
4/14 tumours demonstrated evident squamous differentiation/meta-
plasia. The median tumour size was 3.6 cm (4 tumours 2-3.9 cm 
and 6 tumours ≥ 4 cm, range 0.8 to 8.6 cm). All were at least 
stage IB1 (FIGO 2018). Initial nodal involvement was seen in 2/13 
patients and recurrence (14 months, liver; 60 months, paraaortic 
nodes) in 2/11 patients (follow up median 46 months, range 2-192 
months). Oestrogen receptor expression was at least focal in 13/14 
tumours while all showed non-diffuse p16 expression.
Conclusion: This endeavour represents the largest reported series 
of EEA. Diligent sampling, comprehensive microscopic examina-
tion and ancillary studies for detection of HPV are essential to 
establish the correct diagnosis. Additional studies are needed to 
determine the molecular pathogenesis and optimal management for 
these neoplasms and to compare their clinicopathologic behaviour 
with other endocervical adenocarcinoma types.

Netherlands
Background & objectives: Detection of pathogenic POLE-muta-
tions in endometrial cancer is of prognostic and therapeutic impor-
tance. Currently, POLE-status is determined by DNA-sequencing, 
which is time-consuming, not widely available and expensive. We 
validated a rapid, low-cost quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction 
(qPCR) assay for pathogenic POLE-mutations; QPOLE.
Methods: Primer and fluorescence-labelled 5’-nuclease probe-
sequences of pathogenic POLE-mutations within the POLE exo-
nuclease domain were designed. Two multiplex mixes, QPOLE-
frequent for the most occurring mutations (P286R, V411L, A456P, 
S459F) and QPOLE-rare for the rare variants (M295R, F367S, 
D368Y, L424I, P436R, M444K) were developed using DNA 
extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour tissues 
from our extensive EC tumour tissue repository.
Results: Cut offs for POLE-wild type, -mutant and failed results 
were predefined based on 50 POLE-wild types and 7 POLE-mutant 
cases. For cases with values in the equivocal range between wild 
type and mutant, additional DNA-sequencing (i.e. Next Generation 
Sequencing (NGS)) is recommended. In our testing set of 227 cases

1 3
(71 POLE-mutated, 156 POLE-wild type), 20 samples (8.8%) fell 
in the equivocal range (10 POLE-mutant, 10 POLE-wildtype). Sen-
sitivity and specificity for the combined QPOLE assays were 93.4% 
(95%CI 90.1-96.7%) and 100%. QPOLE combined with NGS for 
equivocal cases yields a final sensitivity of 94.4% (95%CI 91.6-
97.2%), while maintaining a 100% specificity.
Conclusion: With this qPCR assay, QPOLE, we have developed a 
simple, faster, reliable and sensitive alternative for targeted NGS 
of all pathogenic somatic variants in the exonuclease domain of 
the POLE-gene. The simplicity of the design enables assessment 
of POLE-status within 4 hours, and will make universal low-cost 
POLE-testing available for all EC patients. An interlaboratory vali-
dation study to determine the assay’s practical feasibility is ongo-
ing; results are available at the time of the conference.

Yébenes, A. Peláez-García, M. Mendiola, D. Hardisson
*Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Spain
Background & objectives: Molecular classification of endome-
trial carcinoma (EC) has been recently incorporated into prognostic 
risk classification of endometrial carcinoma and should be inte-
grated into conventional pathologic diagnosis.
Methods: We included EC cases diagnosed in our Department 
between September 2019 and March 2022. Clinicopathological 
features were retrieved from the electronic medical records of the 
patients. Molecular classification was performed by the TCGA sur-
rogate testing immunohistochemical markers (p53, MLH1, PMS2, 
MSH2 and MSH6) and somatic mutation analysis of POLE. Prog-
nostic risk group stratification was established according to ESGO-
ESTRO-ESP 2021 guidelines.
Results: We found 92 patients with EC, 80 of which underwent 
surgery. Most cases were low-grade early stage endometrioid car-
cinomas (85%). According to the molecular classification, 25% EC 
showed mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd), 15% were p53abn (all 
high-grade, mostly at advanced stages), 6.5% showed a pathogenic 
POLE mutation, and 50% were of no specific molecular profile 
(NSMP). Three cases displayed more than one alteration (“multiple 
classifiers”). According to clinicopathological features, 38 cases 
were low-risk, 12 intermediate, 9 intermediate-high, 18 high-risk, 
and 2 advanced metastatic. After integrating molecular classifica-
tion, a risk-group shift occurred in 3 patients (one p53abn from 
low to intermediate risk, and 2 POLEmut from high-intermediate 
to low-risk).
Conclusion: There is good correlation between molecular classi-
fication and histological subtypes: all p53abn tumours were high-
grade carcinomas (43% presented at advanced stage), whereas 
POLEmut cases were mostly low-grade endometrioid carcinomas. 
Inclusion of this surrogate marker approach to the molecular-based 
classification is prognostically informative in low-, intermediate-, 
and high-risk endometrial carcinoma. Changes in prognostic risk 
group classification occur mainly in p53abn and POLEmut cases. 
According to current guidelines, molecular classification is encour-
aged in all endometrial carcinomas, especially high-grade tumours.

Comparison of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes between endo-
metrial carcinoma primary tumours and matched metastases

Bartosch
*Pathology Department , Centro Hospitalar São João, Porto; Medi-
cal Faculty, University of Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Tumour infiltrating lymphocytes 
(TILs) in endometrial carcinoma can stimulate anti-tumour immune 
response and have been shown to impact survival. In some tumour 
models decreased TILs in metastases was shown, but in metastatic/
recurrent endometrial carcinoma limited data is available.
Methods: We studied a cohort of 39 primary endometrial 
endometrioid carcinomas and matched metastases, diagnosed 
between 2000 and 2013, at two Portuguese tertiary centers. 
Patient’s clinical files and histological slides were retrospec-
tively reviewed. The number of TILs per square millimeters 
was automatically determine using QuPath in 6 (primary) and 
3 (metastasis) random fields for each case.
Results: The number of TILs in metastases had a significant, but 
weak, correlation with the number of TILs in primary tumours 
(rs=0.40, p=0.01). Metastases had a median of 238 TILs/mm2 
(range:4,1871), with no difference between distant versus regional 
metastases, nor between lymph-node versus other sites (perito-
neum, lung, bone). Primary tumours had a median of 262 TILs/
mm2 (range:0,1013). Twenty metastases showed a decrease in the 
number of TILS compared to matched primary tumours, and 18 
showed an increase. Variations in TILs numbers do not correlate 
with metastases site, grade or mitotic count. Even though not sta-
tistically significant, patients with higher number of TILs in metas-
tasis had a better overall survival (HR:0.43, p=0.11).
Conclusion: The immune microenvironment in endometrial car-
cinoma metastases seems to be variable, either with an increase 
or decrease in TILs compared to primary tumours. Further studies 
with larger series are needed to confirm our findings and determine 
the factors underlying this variation.

*Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, USA
Background & objectives: DNA methylation analysis is an emerg-
ing approach with great potential to further our understanding of 
oncogenic mechanisms and assisting with tumour classification. In 
this study we set to characterize a group of endometrial carcinomas 
using their methylation profile.
Methods: We collected a series of molecularly profiled (using 
ProMisE) and clinically annotated endometrial carcinomas. 
Methylation analysis was done using the Illumina Infinium EPIC 
(850k) BeadChip with subsequent unsupervised clustering of the 
differentially methylated regions. Statistical analyses including 
two-tailed T-Tests, Chi-Squared tests, and Kaplan Meier sur-
vival analysis were done across various clinical and molecular 
variables.
Results: Our cohort (n=50) included 10 POLE mutated (POL-
Emut), 10 MMR-deficient (MMRd), 10 p53 abnormal (p53abn), 
and 20 with no specific molecular profile (NSMP). The unsuper-
vised clustering analysis identified two major methylation groups 
(A and B), each with two subgroups (A1/2 and B1/2). Clusters 
A and B differed significantly in terms of molecular subtypes 
(p<0.001): cluster A only included NSMP and p53abn cases, 
while cluster B had high representation of MMR-deficient and 
POLEmut tumours. Deep myometrial invasion (stage IB), lower 
BMI, and beta-catenin expression were associated with cluster 
B (p=0.040, 0.009, and 0.037 respectively). Survival analysis

of sub-cluster B2 showed significantly better overall survival 
compared to the others three subgroups (p=0.040).
Conclusion: Endometrial carcinoma is a complex disease with a 
spectrum of different genomic and epigenetic alteration profiles. 
Our findings support that methylation analysis has the potential 
to predict molecular and clinical variables. Further analysis of 
the impact of specific differentially methylated regions on clin-
icopathologic variables is ongoing.

*Pathology Unit, University of Bologna Medical Center, Italy
Background & objectives: The ESGO/ESTRO/ESP committee 
has been recently proposed a new risk stratification system for 
endometrial cancer (EC) patients incorporating both clinico-
pathological and molecular characteristics. The study aims to 
compare the ESGO/ESTRO/ESP risk classification system with 
the previous 2016 risk classification.
Methods: The cohort included 187 consecutive patients with endo-
metrial carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Next-Gen-
eration Sequencing (NGS) were used to assign TCGA molecular 
EC subgroups: POLE mutant (POLE), mismatch repair deficient 
(MMRd), p53 mutant (p53abn), and no specific molecular profile 
(NSMP).
Results: TCGA class assignment of EC cohort: 7% POLE group, 
31% MMRd group, 23.5% p53abn group, 38.5% NSMP group. In 
the 2020 risk classification system, 39.1% of patients were allo-
cated to low risk compared with 22.6% in the 2016 risk classifica-
tion system, mainly due to reclassification of patients previously 
classified especially as high-intermediate risk. The recent 2020 
guidelines revealed a total of 61 patients (32,6%) with a change in 
risk group in relation to the 2016 classification system: the shift 
was due to p53abn, POLE alterations and lymph vascular inva-
sion. The application of the 2020 risk stratification system shows 
Kaplan-Meier curves with a more significant difference between 
the groups throughout survival.
Conclusion: In our cohort, the application of the new 2020 risk 
classification integrating clinicopathological and molecular param-
eters provided a more accurate identification of low-risk and high-
risk patients, potentially allowing a more specific selection for 
post-operative adjuvant therapy. Integrated molecular classification 
is a promising tool for a better therapeutic management of patients.

CCND1 amplification and cyclin D1 overexpression correlate 
with adverse outcome in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma

*Hospital Clínic Barcelona, Spain
Background & objectives: There is scarce evidence regarding the 
role of CCND1 amplification and protein overexpression in vulvar 
squamous cell carcinomas (VSCC). We aimed to 1) correlate cyclin 
D1 DNA amplification with protein overexpression and 2) correlate 
cyclin D1 overexpression with clinical prognosis.
Methods: Whole exome sequencing and cyclin D1 immunohis-
tochemistry (IHC) were performed in 65 VSCC. Copy number 
alterations were predicted for the tumour-control pairs using Con-
trolfreeC. The prognostic significance of cyclin D1 IHC overex-
pression and its correlation with clinical-pathological features was 
further assessed in a subset of 90 VSCC. Cyclin D1 was considered 
overexpressed when >50% of the tumour cells stained positive.
Results: A total of 18/65 (27.6%) VSCC showed amplifications in 
CCND1 and 26/65 (40.0%) showed strong cyclin D1 overexpres-
sion. A strong positive correlation between CCND1 amplification 
and cyclin D1 overexpression was found (p<0.001). Both CCND1 
gains and cyclin D1 overexpression strongly correlated with worse 
disease-free survival (p<0.001 for each). Only cyclin D1 IHC over-
expression had significant association with worse disease-specific 
survival (p<0.01).
In the cohort of 90 VSCC, tumours overexpressing cyclin D1 
showed worse disease-specific and disease-free survival than cyclin 
D1-negative tumours (p<0.001 for each). Cyclin D1 overexpression 
correlated also with HPV-negative status (p<0.001), presence of 
p53 abnormalities (p<0.001) and advanced FIGO stage [III-IV vs. 
I-II] (p=0.02).
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that CCND1 is amplified and 
overexpressed in a significant proportion of VSCC, mostly in HPV-
independent tumours. Cyclin D1 overexpression is strongly asso-
ciated with adverse patient outcome (worse disease-specific and 
disease-free survival) and could be a useful tool for prognostic 
stratification. Innovative targeted therapies could be explored based 
on these findings.

*Hospital Clínic Barcelona, Spain
Background & objectives: A number of new precursors of Human 
Papillomavirus (HPV)-independent vulvar squamous cell carcino-
mas (VSCC) have been recently defined: vulvar acanthosis with 
altered differentiation (VAAD), differentiated exophytic intraepi-
thelial lesions (DEVIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial 
(HSIL)-like lesions.
Methods: We assessed whether patients with HPV-independent 
VSCC had any clinico-pathological differences depending on the 
associated adjacent precursor. The study comprised 157 patients 
with HPV-independent VSCC surgically treated between 1975 and 
2021. The skin adjacent to the tumour was histologically reviewed. 
The median follow-up was 69 months. Correlations with outcome 
were analysed using multivariable Cox regression and log-rank 
analysis.
Results: 50 patients (31.8%) showed differentiated VIN 
(dVIN), 49 patients (31.2%) showed adjacent inflammatory 
dermatosis, 25 (15.9%) had HSIL-like lesions, 9 (5.7%) showed

lesion was identified. Patients with HSIL-like and VAAD/
DEVIL lesions showed impaired disease-free survival (higher

rates of relapse and/or persistence of disease) compared with 
other groups (p<0.001). In addition, despite no statistically 
significant, the tumour size of VSCC associated to HSIL-like 
lesions was smaller than of other groups (p=0.17). No differ-
ences in overall or disease-specific survival were identified 
among the six groups (p=0.15). None of the women with VAAD 
or DEVIL died of disease.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate higher risk of relapse or per-
sistence of disease in patients with VSCC arising on HSIL-like or 
VAAD/DEVIL lesions. Closer surveillance after surgical resection 
of VSCC may be indicated for these cases.

G. Mehmet, D. Fanni, J. Bennett, E. Unti, J. Cheville, A. Larish
*Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA
Background & objectives: Lymph node (LN) assessment is criti-
cal for staging of endometrial cancer (EC). Low volume metastasis 
(LVM), upstages patients, but early data suggests
some of these patients can be spared adjuvant treatment. So, accu-
rate pathologic determination of LVM is critical.
Methods: Whole slide images (WSI) (3 H&E levels, 40 μm apart 
and 1 CK AE1/AE3 slide) of 11 pelvic sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) 
involved by LVM were reviewed by 9 pathologists from multiple 
institutions. Various parameters were assessed: number of foci, size 
of the largest focus, clusters versus scattered cell, site of involve-
ment in the LN and extra-nodal extension.
Results: An international consortium of 9 pathologists were 
participated in this study. 9 out of 11 cases, ≥8 pathologists had 
complete agreement determining the type of involvement (MM 
vs ITC). In the remaining 2 cases, there was an even split in the 
designation of the involvement type. These two cases showed 
multiple scattered tumour foci with dispersed cells, making 
the accurate measurement and determination of the involve-
ment type challenging. The largest focus measurements showed 
some disagreement in both micro-metastasis and ITC cases, 
with slightly higher variability in the ITC sub-group. Agree-
ment in #foci/plane, pattern, and site of involvement were high.
Conclusion: Our study indicates an excellent interobserver agree-
ment for the separation of ITCs and MM amongst an international 
group of gynaecologic pathologists using WSI. Problematic cases 
arise when tumour foci extend along a distance within a lymph 
node. Additional studies are needed to determine the impact of 
these findings and to formulate recommendations to address.

Evaluation of the implementation and diagnostic accuracy of 
the Paris classification for reporting urinary cytology in voided 
urine specimens: a cyto-histological correlation study in a high-
volume cancer centre
J. Lobo*, C. Lobo, L. Leça, Â. Rodrigues, R. Henrique, P. Monteiro
*IPO Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: The Paris classification was introduced 
for reporting urinary cytology, highlighting the need to focus on 
accurately identifying high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC), 
and aiming to improve criteria, terminology and ultimately improv-
ing patient management.
Methods: To assess the overall implementation and diagnos-
tic performance of the Paris classification for reporting urinary 
cytology. All urinary cytology reports from July 2018-December 
2019 were collected (n=1240). Only voided urine samples were 
included (n=1180), of which 9.9% had histological confirmation. 
Risk of malignancy (ROM) was calculated. Diagnostic perfor-
mance of urinary cytology was assessed, including sensitivity, 
specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy.
Results: The median age of the study population was 69 years, and 
71.2% were male. The Paris system categories were widely used (in 
99.7% of reports). The distribution of categories was: 0.3% unsat-
isfactory, 90.5% negative for HGUC, 5.6% atypical urothelial cells 
(AUC), 1.6% suspicious for HGUC, 1.9% HGUC and 0.1% other 
malignancies. No diagnosis of low-grade urothelial neoplasia was 
given. ROM was 21.4% for negative for HGUC, 66.7% for AUC, 
91.7% for suspicious for HGUC and 100% for HGUC. When using 
suspicious for HGUC as a cut-off, the diagnostic performance of 
urinary cytology in identifying HGUC was 46% sensitivity, 98% 
specificity, 96% PPV, 68% NPV and 74% accuracy.
Conclusion: Specificity of urinary cytology is very high. ROM 
for each category was in accordance with literature, except for 
AUC where ROM was slightly higher (66.7%). Sensitivity of 
voided urine specimens is known to be lower than that of instru-
mented specimens, explaining the lower sensitivity in our study. 
Study population characteristics (high-volume cancer centre 
with many patients treated with intra-vesical therapies) may 
explain part of our results. This pilot study motivated an inter-
observer variability study among three Cytopathologists, which 
is ongoing.

Application of a standardised terminology and nomenclature 
for respiratory cytology: experience from a large tertiary res-
piratory cancer centre
D. O’Connor*, A. Fabre, M. Mc Nally, D. Gibbons
*St Vincent’s University Hospital, Ireland
Background & objectives: International cytopathology coding 
systems have a valuable role in facilitating report standardisation. 
A new international respiratory cytopathology coding system is 
currently being developed. Our institution has been coding all res-
piratory cytology specimens in a similar manner for over 10 years.
Methods: Specimens are coded as non-diagnostic (C1), benign 
(C2), atypical, favour reactive (C3), suspicious for malignancy (C4) 
or malignant (C5).
We calculated rates of diagnostic categories on our cohort over a 
two-year period by evaluating all endobronchial ultrasound-guided 
transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA), bronchial wash-
ing, bronchial brushing, bronchial lavage and sputum specimens 
performed at our institution using the laboratory information 
system.
Results: We assessed all aforementioned respiratory cytological 
specimens received at our institution in the years 2020 and 2021. 
In total, 1433 cytological specimens fulfilled the inclusion crite-
ria and were analysed. Of these, 15.8 % (n=226) were coded as 
malignant (C5) and 1.47% (n=21) were coded as suspicious for 
malignancy (C4).
The calculated rates of diagnostic categories, bases on cytological 
findings, were as follows:

2. Bronchial brushings (n=96): C1=1.0%, C2=49.0%, C3=8.3%, 
C4=3.1%, C5=38.5%.
3. Bronchial washings (n=486): C1=3.1%, C2=75.7%, C3=8.4%, 
C4=2.3%, C5=10.5%.
4. Bronchial lavages (n=429): C1=1.9%, C2=97.0%, C3=0.5%, 
C4=0.2%, C5=0.5%.
5. Sputum (n=7): C1=14.3%, C2=85.7%, C3=0.0%, C4=0.0%, 
C5=0.0%.
Conclusion: Coding systems are widely utilised in other areas of 
cytopathology, such as in thyroid and salivary gland specimens. 
The consistency and standardisation of reporting achieved from 
such systems provides greater clarity for the treating physician and 
facilitates clear communication of essential information.
We have been using a classification system analogous to the pro-
posed new respiratory cytology classification system for approxi-
mately 10 years. This data provides indicative rates of cytological 
outcomes in a tertiary referral lung oncology centre.

A retrospective report-based review of 4,155 consecutive 
patients undergoing minimally invasive thoracic lymph node 
sampling

A. Naqvi
*Pathology, McMaster University, Canada
Background & objectives: Endoscopic bronchial ultrasound 
(EBUS) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are minimally invasive 
strategies to assess thoracic lymph nodes. This project examined 
the pathology of patients from a regional thoracic surgery cen-
tre that underwent EBUS/EUS and (if applicable) lung cancer 
resection.
Methods: All EBUS/EUS specimens accessioned 2011-2020 
were retrieved and linked via anonymized patient identifier to 
lung cancer resections with synoptic reports. Cases were auto-
matically classified and grouped into mutually exclusive catego-
ries (malignant(MAL), suspicious(SUSP), insufficient(INSUF), 
benign(BEN)), based on the most recent specimens using a 
previously validated program. Data was stratified by location 
(station(ST)7, ST4R, ST4L, all other N2 ST(STN2others), all N1 
ST(STN1all)).
Results: The cohort contained 4,155 patients with 10,922 EBUS/
EUS specimens. Patients had 1 to 13 specimens and median 
number of specimens per patient was three. Patients with station 
MAL/number of patients(% MAL) was: ST7 750/3,407(22%), 
ST4R 816/2,844(29%), ST4L 293/1,504(20%), STN2others 
283/668(42%), STN1all 381/1,264(30%). Overall, N2 MAL sta-
tus/number of patients(%) was 1,399/3,992(35%) and multiple N2 
stations/STN2others were involved in 604 of 1,399(43%) patients. 
829(20%) patients went for lung cancer resection; 47 had two sur-
geries and two had three surgeries. Nodal stage by most recent 
surgical specimen was 20 (patients) pNX, 563 pN0, 175 pN1 and 
71 pN2. 469 of 4,155 patients (11%) had granulomatous inflam-
mation in 838 EBUS/EUS specimens.
Conclusion: EBUS/EUS is used for lung cancer staging, sarcoido-
sis and other indications. Patients with N2 positivity frequently 
have multiple positive stations. The low pN2 rate on resection in 
our environment confirms EBUS/EUS is effective at selecting lung 
cancer patients for surgery. The assessment of pathologic cate-
gorizations can provide insights in thoracic surgery and tumour 
biology.

The Paris System for reporting urinary cytology: 5 years of 
institutional experience in a tertiary hospital
M. Pinho*, R. Moiteiro da Cruz, J. Boavida, R. Luís
*Department of Pathology - Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN; 
Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal
Background & objectives: The Paris System for Reporting 
Urinary Cytology (TPS) standardizes the triage criteria for high-
grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC) in urine specimens. Our 
aim was to assess the TPS accuracy through cytohistological 
correlation, stratified by both cytological category and histological 
grade.
Methods: The reports of urinary tract histological diagnoses 
and pertaining retrospective cytological specimens, examined in 
2016-2021, were retrieved from our Department software data-
base; non-satisfactory/non-diagnostic samples were unaccounted 
for. The TPS categories were divided into negative and positive 
tiers (suspicious and HGUC combined); the risk of malignancy 
(ROM) and performance parameters were then calculated, follow-
ing histological correlation.
Results: A total of 1261 cytological and 638 histological samples 
were assessed. Each biopsy/surgical diagnosis correlated with an 
average of 2 urinary (voided/instrumented) specimens (ranging from 
1 to 12), sampled either simultaneously or up to 52 months before-
hand. The ROM ranged from 17.4% in negative samples to 71.5% 
in positive categories; the performance analysis revealed a sensitiv-
ity of 46.7%, a specificity of 91.8%, a positive predictive value of 
78.4% and a negative predictive value of 72.7%. Atypical urothelial 
cells were independently analysed and revealed mixed results.
Conclusion: We present a heterogeneous series, encompassing 
the learning curve following TPS implementation and clustering 
both “de novo” diagnoses and urothelial neoplasm follow-ups. 
The large volume of these samples impacts its diagnostic yield 
and hence a low sensitivity was expected, contrasting with a high 
specificity that translates the atypia of even scarce shed tumour 
cells. On the other hand, although pathologists are not blinded 
to clinical information and previous diagnosis, histological false 
negatives due to undersampling must not be overlooked.

Fine needle aspiration biopsy of orbital masses: a review of 
36 cases
H. Domanski*, J. Köster
*Department of Genetics and Pathology, Division of Laboratory 
Medicine Region Skåne, Lund, Sweden
Background & objectives: Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) 
is a useful tool to triage orbital lesions in cases where a diagnosis 
cannot be made by clinical and imaging findings alone. FNAB 
can provide crucial information before a surgical and oncologic 
procedure is undertaken.
Methods: Over a period of 5 years, 2017-2021, 36 patients under-
went FNAB of orbital masses. Twenty-nine lesions were sampled 
by FNAB using a transcutaneous or transconjunctival approach 
and 7 patients underwent CT guided FNAB with the assistance of a 
cytopathologist. Thirteen patients had a prior history of malignan-
cies. Flow cytometry was performed in 16 cases and immunocyto-
chemical examination in one.
Results: Diagnostic material was obtained in 28 lesions. 
Malignant haematolymphoid lesions represented most of the 
malignancies: 6 primary and 4 recurrences of non-Hodgkins 
lymphomas and acute myeloid leukaemia. There were 8 
metastatic malignancies: 3 breast, 1 lung, 1 adrenal and 2 
neuroendocrine carcinomas, and 1 metastasis of glioblastoma.

One patient with history of pleomorphic adenoma in the orbit 
was diagnosed with carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. In 
2 patients FNAB disclosed primary salivary duct carcinoma 
and recurrence of basal cell carcinoma respectively. The 
remaining cases included 3 cases of lymphoid hyperplasia, 
3 cases of inflammatory pseudotumour and 1 haemangioma. 
With exception for minor hematomas in some patients, no severe 
complications were observed.
Conclusion: FNAB may be considered a useful technique in the 
diagnostic approach to orbital masses according to strictly defined 
indications. This technique allows a confident diagnosis with a low 
risk of complications and is particularly useful in the evaluation of 
malignant, unresectable and retrobulbar orbital lesions.

Histopathological tumour response scoring in resected pan-
creatic cancer following neoadjuvant therapy (ISGPP-1): an 
international interobserver study
B. Janssen*, S. van Roessel, S. van Dieren, O. de Boer, M. Bes-
selink, J. Verheij, H. Wang, C. Verbeke, A. Farina, for the Interna-
tional Study Group of Pancreatic Pathologists (ISGPP)
*Amsterdam UMC, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: This study investigated whether gastro-
intestinal/pancreatic pathologists can reliably identify neoadjuvant 
treatment effects in pancreatic tumours based on histomorphol-
ogy. Moreover, it aimed to determine the interobserver agreement 
for current (internationally used) tumour response scoring (TRS) 
systems.
Methods: Overall, 23 gastrointestinal/pancreatic pathologists 
reviewed whole H&E-slides of neoadjuvantly treated or treatment-
naive resection specimens of pancreatic cancer. The accuracy in 
identifying treatment effect was investigated in 60 patients (30 
treatment-naïve, 30 after NAT). Interobserver agreement for the 
College of American Pathologists (CAP) and MD Anderson Cancer 
Center (MDACC) TRS systems was assessed in 50 patients using 
intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC).
Results: The sensitivity and specificity for identifying NAT effect 
were 76.2% and 49.0%, respectively. The histological features: 
reduced cancer cell density, mucin pools, and cell degeneration 
were most frequently stated to allow distinction between treated 
and treatment-naïve cases. In 50 patients after NAT, the ICC val-
ues for both TRS systems were ‘moderate’; 0.66 CAP and 0.71 
MDACC. The ICC values of <0.50, ≥0.50 and <0.75, ≥0.75 and 
<0.90, and >0.90 indicate poor, moderate, good, and excellent 
reliability, respectively. None of the cases scored as a complete 
response by at least one pathologist had 100% concordance.
Conclusion: Identification of the effect of NAT in resected pan-
creatic cancer proved unreliable. The interobserver agreement for 
the current TRS systems was suboptimal. These findings support 
the recently published ISGPP recommendations to score residual 
tumour burden rather than tumour regression following NAT, 
which will require a new TRS system.

Two step- progression of non-functioning pancreatic neuroen-
docrine tumours (PanNET)
I. Marinoni*, A. Di Domenico, P. Kirchner, K. Bräutigam, R. 
Maire, C. Thirlwell, C. Kim-Fuchs, A. Perren
*Institute of Pathology, Switzerland
Background & objectives: PanNETs with mutations in ATRX, 
DAXX and MEN1 (ADM) originate from α-cells. Alpha-like Pan-
NETs, small and indolent, progress into intermediate (ADM), larger 
and with high relapse risk. We dissected epigenetic changes and 
activation of related pathways, occurring during such progression.
Methods: We combined DNA methylation profiles of 155 and 
RNA sequencing of 45 PanNET samples. DNA methylation analy-
sis was performed using the ChAMP pipeline. Consensus cluster-
ing was performed following the ConsensusClusterPlus (v1.54.0) 
pipeline. Spearman correlation between expression values and cor-
respondent beta or M values of methylation was used to identify 
genes which changes in both DNA methylation and expression.
Results: Combining RNAseq and DNAme data, we delineated 
three groups of PanNET originating from alpha cells: alpha-
like PanNET, intermediate-ADM and intermediate-ADM3. We 
compared DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles of the 
three groups. We found that alpha-like PanNETs develop first into 
intermediate-ADM and then into intermediated-ADM3 following 
a two steps progression. Notably, alpha-like tumours develop into 
intermediate-ADM upon DAXX/ATRX mutations and changes in 
DNA methylation mainly at heterochromatin regions increasing 
Chromosomal Instability. Interestingly, only genes regulating cell 
proliferation were found differently expressed between alpha-like 
and intermediate-ADM tumours. Intermediate-ADM develop into 
intermediated-ADM3 acquiring changes in DNA methylation at 
regulatory regions, resulting in an altered expression of genes 
involved in cell differentiation and metabolism.
Conclusion: We described pathways of progression dependent on 
DAXX and ATRX and subsequent epigenetic changes, characterized 
by increased cellular dedifferentiation and metabolic adaptation. Addi-
tionally, our study confirmed the high relevance of DNA methylation 
in stratifying and classifying PanNETs with different molecular and 
clinical characteristics.

tions for tumour progression and recurrence

M. Ravaioli, A. D’Errico, F. Vasuri
*Department of Pathology, IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Univer-
sitaria di Bologna, Italy
Background & objectives: The aims of the present study are to 
confirm the prognostic role of microscopic portal vein invasion 
(MPVI) in resected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to cor-
relate MPVI with the mutational status to create risk categories 
based on NGS data.
Methods: Out of 400 retrospective resected HCCs we selected all 
cases with a diagnosis of microvascular invasion (MVI). Then we 
reviewed the histopathology, subclassifying each case according 
to the presence of MVI vs MPVI. Survival data for each patient 
was then obtained. We then performed NGS analysis with a custom 
panel on a perspective cohort of recent resected HCCs.
Results: Kaplan-Mayer survival analysis was performed on the retro-
spective cohort which showed a statistically significant better Overall 
Survival (OS) for HCCs without MPVI (p=0.007). NGS analysis found 
that TERT(65%) TP53(26%), and CTNNB1(22%) were the most fre-
quently observed mutations. NGS results and MVI were studied using 
a Chi-Square test and found that TP53-mut and MPVI were positively 
correlated (p=0.039), while TERT-promoter mutation correlates with 
the presence of any MVI (p=0.038). Although MPVI and CTNNB1-
mut correlation was not significant (p=0.076), none of the 5 CTNNB1-
mut cases had MPVI. TP53-mut HCCs were characterized by a higher

histological grade (p=0.005) and a solid/macrotrabecular architecture 
(p=0.017).
Conclusion: Our retrospective data confirmed the literature on 
resected HCCs, showing a worse OS in patients exhibiting MPVI vs 
MVI. The perspective phase of our study is still in progress, but our 
preliminary data on NGS results suggest a progression from TERT-
mutated HCCs, which develop MVI, to TP53 mutation, which can 
predict MPVI, besides a more aggressive behaviour.

Hong, L.A. Brosens, V. Adsay, A. Scarpa, C. Luchini
*Department of Diagnostics and Public Health, Section of Pathol-
ogy, University of Verona, Verona, Italy
Background & objectives: Acinar cystic transformation (ACT) of 
the pancreas is a poorly understood and rare entity among pancre-
atic cystic lesions. This study aims at clarifying their real nature.
Methods: The study cohort includes 25 pancreatic ACT, represent-
ing the largest series of ACT in the literature. Here we provide their 
clinicopathological characterization along with molecular profiling 
by next-generation sequencing (NGS).
Results: ACT were more common in female patients, frequently 
in body-tail region. At follow-up, all patients were alive and free 
of disease. Histologically, all cysts were lined by typical acinar 
epithelium, sometimes intermingled with columnar or ductal-like 
epithelium. Cell atypia, necrosis, mitoses, and invasive carcinoma 
were absent. Three cases showed a patchy distribution, and two 
cases were associated to ductuloinsular complexes with centroaci-
nar microcysts. Two ACT showed peculiar histologic features: one 
showed a distinctive microcystic pattern, and another harboured 
foci of low-grade dysplasia in the areas lined by ductal-like epi-
thelium. NGS detected the presence of two pathogenic / likely-
pathogenic mutations in two different cases: KRAS, c.34G>C, 
p.G12R, and SMO, c.1685G>A, p.R562Q.
Conclusion: Overall considered, our findings indicate that ACT 
is as a heterogeneous entity. It seems to encompass lesions with 
different possible pathogenesis, which includes the evolution from 
a centroacinar microcyst, and malformative, obstructive, or neo-
plastic origins. The potential presence of driver mutations call 
for a careful management of ACT patients, taking into account 
also surgical resection and active imaging surveillance / life-long 
follow-up.

Spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of 
pancreatic cancer reveals distinct profiles which correlate with 
site of recurrence
A.S. Wenning*, B. Gloor, P. Aeschbacher, A. Perren, E. 
Karamitopoulou-Diamantis
*Department of Visceral Surgery, University Hospital Bern, 
Switzerland
Background & objectives: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC) remains a highly lethal neoplasm. The majority of 
patients with localized disease will eventually develop tumour 
recurrence after complete surgical resection. Here we investigate 
tumour- and immune cell determinants of PDAC recurrence.
Methods: PDACs (n=284) were classified according to 
recurrence site as liver (n=93/33%), lung (n=49/17%), local 
(n=31/11%), peritoneal recurrences (n=38/13%) and no-recur-
rence (n=73/26%). Four regions of interest per tumour were 
selected. Spatial compartments were identified with fluorescent 
imaging followed by transcriptomic (pancytokeratin+tumour 
cell compartment) and proteomic (CD45+leukocyte compart-
ment) analysis for immune pathway associated targets by using 
a digital spatial profiling platform.
Results: Median overall-survival for the PDAC-groups 
was 16months (liver), 27months (lung), 26months (local), 
12.5months (peritoneal) and 64months (no-recurrence). The 
tumour cell-compartment of 60% of the non-recurrent PDACs, 
as well as 45%, 40% and 31% of the lung, local and peritoneal 
recurrences respectively, showed significant upregulation of 
pathways involved in T cell activation, immune cell adhesion/
migration, antigen presentation and cytokine signalling, as 
compared to only 20% of liver recurrences. CD66b (granu-
locyte-marker) and STING (mediator of immunosuppressive 
microenvironment and feature of the basal-like subtype) were 
strongly up-regulated in the liver leukocyte-compartment. The 
non-recurrent leukocyte-compartment revealed significant 
up-regulation of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, GZMB, HLA-DR, 
checkpoint molecules and beta-2-microglobulin compared to 
all recurrent tumours.
Conclusion: We found distinct spatial and microenvironmen-
tal profiles on gene and protein level in each recurrence group, 
which differed from each other as well as from the no-recurrence 
group, underlining the heterogeneity of PDAC. Tumours with 
liver recurrence display poor prognosis associated with unfavour-
able immune signalling and features of the basal-like molecular 
subtype.

A comparative analysis of CPA1, BCL10 and chymotrypsin 
for the distinction of pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas

Gorbokon, G. Sauter, F. Jacobsen, T.S. Clauditz*
*University Medical Center Hamburg, Germany
Background & objectives: Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma 
(PACC) is a rare tumour of the pancreas with an interme-
diate prognosis as compared to pancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumours (PNE) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC) from which it may be difficult to distinguish by 
morphology alone.
Methods: To study was the efficiency of immunohistochemical 
markers, 18 PACCs, 531 PDACs, 64 PNEs, 117 extrapancreatic 
neuroendocrine neoplasms (EPNN), 826 colorectal carcinomas 
(CRC) and 252 gastric carcinomas (GC) were analysed with anti-
bodies for CPA1 (MSVA-601M), bcl10 (Santa Cruz sc5273), and 
chymotrypsin (Biorad 2100-0657) in a tissue microarray format.
Results: CPA1 was positive in 18 of 18 (100%) of PACCs, 0 
of 49 (0%) of PNEs, 0 of 88 (0%) of EPNNs, 10 of 404 (2.5%) 
of CRCs, and 0 of 178 (0%) of GCs. Chymotrypsin was posi-
tive in 16 (87,5%) PACCs, 1 (2%) PNEs, 2 (2.3%) EPNNs, 10 
(2.5%) CRCs, and 1 (0.6%) GCs. Bcl10 was positive in 18 (100%) 
PACCs, 2 (4.1%) PNEs, 5 (1%) EPNNs, 109 (27%) CRCs, and 18 
(10%) GCs. These data resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 
100%/99.2% for CPA1, 100%/88.4% for bcl10, and 94.4%/98.6% 
for chymotrypsin.
Conclusion: CPA1 and chymotrypsin are both highly specific 
and sensitive for ACC while bcl10 is sensitive but has markedly 
lower specificity. Because all “false positive” cases identified 
by CPA1 were CRCs that only showed a positive staining in 
goblet cells and an identical staining pattern was observed in all 
these cases for chymotrypsin and bcl10, a pancreatic origin of 
the mucus in these goblet cells is concluded.

*Department of Pathology Rigshospitalet, Denmark
Background & objectives: Endoscopic sampling of pancreatic 
cystic lesions (PCLs) with through-the-needle-biopsies (TTNBs) 
has been introduced in clinical management. The aim of this study 
was to evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of additional 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) of TTNBs as a diagnostic tool.
Methods: We prospectively included patients with PCLs > 15 mm 
in cross-section for endoscopic ultrasound and TTNB-sampling. 
The TTNBs were microscopically evaluated and classified accord-
ing to the WHO classification, using up to 12 slides from each 
TTNB with a 3 μm thickness. Secondly, additional 10 slides of 
each TTNB were analysed by NGS using a 51 gene customized 
hotspot panel.
Results: We included 101 patients of which 95 had sufficient tissue 
for microscopic evaluation. The TTNBs were evaluated accord-
ing to the WHO classification for pancreatic neoplasms includ-
ing appropriate immunohistochemical staining. Subsequently, 
91 patients had available tissue for NGS. We identified genetic 
aberrations in 49 patients, mostly alterations in KRAS and GNAS, 
diagnostic for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). 
Sensitivity and specificity of the NGS analysis were calculated 
with TTNB histology as the gold standard. A sensitivity and speci-
ficity of 83.7 % (70.3-92.7 %) and 81.8 % (48.2-97.7 %), respec-
tively, were demonstrated for a mucinous cyst diagnosis, and 87.2 
% (74.2-95.2 %) and 84.6 % (54.5-98.1 %), respectively, for an 
IPMN diagnosis.
Conclusion: We have demonstrated that TTNBs can be used for 
both microscopic evaluation, immunohistochemical classifica-
tion, and additional targeted NGS in the majority of patients 
in a large prospective cohort. TTNBs offer the possibility of 
assessment of an intact piece of the cyst wall with correlation to 
genetic aberrations. NGS has high sensitivity and specificity for 
the diagnosis of mucinous cysts including IPMNs. We propose 
TTNBs as a potential alternative to cyst fluid cytology in the 
diagnostic management of patients with PCLs.

EUS FNA vs. EUS FNB of pancreatic lesions: a comparative 
study
T. Pasupati Meenakshi*, A. Narayanan, D. Shalini
*Gribbles Pathology M Sdn Bhd, Malaysia
Background & objectives: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided 
fine-needle biopsy (FNB) is replacing EUSFNA in the diagnosis 
and management of pancreatic lesions in Malaysia. The aim is to 
document and compare the diagnostic precision, accuracy and IHC 
studies of EUS-FNB and EUSFNA of pancreatic lesions.
Methods: This is a cross sectional, comparative study of EUS FNA 
and EUS FNB samples of pancreas received in Gribbles Pathology 
in the year 2021, with clinical, CT scan and endoscopy correlation. 
A total number of 341 EUS FNA and 68 EUS FNB samples of pan-
creatic lesions were documented for cytological and histological 
evaluation, respectively, along with IHC analysis.
Results: A wide range of pancreatic lesions, mostly primary 
adenocarcinomas, along with a small number of neuroendocrine 
tumours were documented. Spindle cell tumours, mucinous cystic 
neoplasms, serous papillary lesions, lymphomas, and cases of 
chronic pancreatitis were also seen. Metastatic lesions from 
the lung and kidney were also noted. Correlation with clinical 
picture, tumour markers and CT scan findings were undertaken 
in all cases. EUS FNA cytology had shown fruitful results in 
majority of the cases and cell block with good yield helped 
in IHC outcome. However, EUS FNB was found to be easier, 
advantageous, precise, and had an additional advantage of more 
material for IHC and further molecular studies.
Conclusion: EUSFNB is emerging as the most safe, precise and 
reliable diagnostic procedure replacing the conventional EUS-
FNA and cell block of pancreatic lesions in Malaysia. The pre-
cision of the procedure and accuracy of the results of EUSFNB 
samples have considerably increased in the year 2021. This ini-
tial, first-time comparative study carried out in Gribbles Pathol-
ogy, Malaysia is to document the increasing and accurate diag-
nostic precision of EUSFNB in the management of pancreatic 
lesions.

Expression and prognostic significance of HMGA2 in pancre-
atic ductal adenocarcinoma and ampullary adenocarcinoma
D. Oflas*, F. Canaz, L. Demir, İ. Özer, E. Çolak
*Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Turkey
Background & objectives: High mobility group protein 2 
(HMGA2) is a structural transcriptional protein involved in 
tumourigenesis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). 
We evaluated the expression and clinical prognostic value of 
HMGA2 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and amp-
ullary adenocarcinoma (AAC).
Methods: HMGA2 expression was immunohistochemically 
assessed in normal pancreatic tissue (n=57), chronic pancreati-
tis (n=86), low-grade PanIN (n=80), high-grade PanIN (n=30), 
PDAC (n=57) and AAC (n=30). Immunochemical staining of 
EMT markers (E-cadherin and vimentin) were applied in PDAC 
and AAC. The relationship between HMGA2 expression and 
clinicopathological characteristics in the PDAC, AAC, and the 
neoplasia cohort (n=87) including these groups was evaluated.
Results: HMGA2 expression was not observed in normal pan-
creatic tissue, chronic pancreatitis, and low-grade PanIN. 
High expression was detected in high-grade PanIN and PDAC 
(P<0.001). Between HMGA2 expression and age, gender, tumour 
location, size, differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, perineural 
invasion, pT, and pN status in the PDAC, AAC, and the neoplasia 
cohort significant relationship was not found (P>0.05). A signifi-
cant correlation was observed between loss of E-cadherin expres-
sion and vimentin positivity and HMGA2 expression (P<0.05). 
HMGA2 expression increased the risk of disease-related death 
and decreased overall survival in AAC and the neoplasia cohort 
(P=0.002, P=0.016, respectively). HMGA2 was not related to 
overall survival and risk of death in PDAC (P>0.05).
Conclusion: Our results suggest that HMGA2 is an effective 
immunohistochemical marker in detecting benign and malignant 
lesions in the pancreas, as well as a potential new prognostic 
marker and therapeutic target in periampullary tumours, especially

AAC. The statistically significant correlation between HMGA2 
protein expression, loss of E-cadherin expression, and vimentin 
positivity support the role of HMGA2 in EMT.

Detection of perineural invasion in pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
using artificial intelligence
S. Borsekofsky*, R. Hagege, D. Hershkovitz
*Pathology Department of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, 
Israel
Background & objectives: Perineural invasion (PNI) refers to 
invasion of cancerous cells around/in nerve. PNI is associated with 
a worse prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) 
with therapeutic target potential. We aimed to build an algorithm 
to identify PNI in PDAC more reliably/efficiently.
Methods: Training the algorithm involved manual segmentation 
of nerve and tumour using 260 slide images from 6 scanned PDAC 
cases. Analytical validation used 168 additional images. Clinical 
validation had the algorithm applied to 59 cases of previously diag-
nosed PDAC, presenting images of areas tumour and nerve were 
in closest proximity. A pathologist then determined presence or 
absence of PNI per case.
Results: In the analytical validation, the algorithm showed sensi-
tivity of 86%, 55% and specificity of 78% and 83% for the detec-
tion of nerve and tumour, respectively. After incorporation of the 
tumour-nerve distance into the algorithm, PNI was identified in an 
additional 18 previously misclassified cases increasing the rate of 
detection from 52.5 to 81.4%. Interestingly, this required an aver-
age of only 24 seconds per case.
Conclusion: This algorithm was shown to be a very useful and 
time efficient tool to assist pathologists to more accurately and 
reliably identify PNI in PDAC. Of interest, training the algorithm 
to imitate pathologist thought processes (measuring the distance 
between tumour and nerve) allows development of a robust algo-
rithm even based on a small cohort.

Pre-invasive lesions of pancreatobiliary cancer: immunohisto-
chemical signatures defining biological behaviour
R. Vesce*, A. Yavas, L.J. Häberle, I. Esposito
*Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Düsseldorf, Germany
Background & objectives: We investigated the immunohisto-
chemical expression profile of pre-invasive lesions of pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) 
to detect staining patterns predicting risk of tumour-progression 
at early stages.
Methods: We analysed 33 PanIN, 28 gastric (gIPMN) and 20 intes-
tinal (iIPMN) IPMN, 18 BilIN and their associated invasive can-
cers, when present (PDAC, n=23; CCA, n=6). We investigated the 
expression of markers associated with subtyping (MUC1, MUC2, 
MUC5AC, MUC6, CDX2), tumour biology (p16, p53, GATA6, 
Smad4, ki67), along with recently identified markers (TFF3, 
MUCL3).
Results: PanINs, gIPMNs and BilINs displayed simi-
lar phenotypes with MUC stains; however, MUCL3 was 
increased in gIPMNs(p=0.03) and BilINs(p=0.01) com-
pared to PanINs. TFF3 was increased in BilINs, compared 
to PanINs(p=0.03). BilINs revealed focal MUC2(17%) and 
CDX2(38%) expressions. iIPMNs showed higher expression of 
MUC2,CDX2,TFF3, and higher Ki67-index than PanINs and 
gIPMNs(p<0.001). MUC1 was overexpressed in high-grade 
PanIN(p=0.02) and PDAC(p<0.001) compared to low-grade 
PanIN and in CCA compared to BilIN(p=0.001). MUC5AC 
was decreased in IPMNs and BilINs with associated invasive 
tumours compared to cases without invasive tumours(p=0.03 
and p=0.03, respectively). MUC6 was decreased in PDAC 
compared to PanIN and gIPMN(p<0.001). Altered expression 
of GATA6,p53,p16 and SMAD4 was observed in high-grade 
lesions and/or cancers.
Conclusion: iIPMNs display peculiar marker expression and 
higher proliferation rates compared to gIPMNs and PanINs, which 
are very similar to each other apart from the expression of MUCL3. 
BilINs and PanINs also show overall similar immunophenotypes. 
However, BilINs often present aberrant marker expression, differ-
ent TFF3 and MUCL3 expression and higher proliferation rate. 
Altered expression of differentiation markers, such as MUC1, 
MUC5AC, MUC6 and GATA6 and of tumour-suppressors is asso-
ciated with high-grade precursors and invasive cancers.

Whole-exome sequencing of chordoma with special emphasis 
on chromatin regulatory genes and recurrences

M. Röpke, D. Jechorek, S. Franke
*OvGU Magdeburg Department of Pathology, Germany
Background & objectives: More insight into molecular genetics 
of chordoma is desired for defining new therapeutic strategies. We 
investigated 9 primary chordomas including one case with four 
recurrences. Special emphasis was put on chromatin regulatory 
genes and differences between recurrences and primary tumours.
Methods: DNA was extracted from formalin- fixed, paraffin-
embedded tissue samples of sacrococcygeal chordomas from 
patients between 39 and 78 years of age. After thorough qual-
ity checking, the DNA was analysed by whole- exome sequencing 
with a NextSeq Illumina sequencer. In addition to histopathologi-
cal tumour examination the expression of brachyury p53, Ki-
67,SMARCB and H3K36me3 was investigated by immunohisto-
chemical techniques.
Results: Consistent with our immunohistochemical findings and cur-
rent literature our study revealed a pattern of typical molecular altera-
tions including brachyury, p53, APC, BRCA, CDKN, and PI3K-sign-
aling, in both recurrences and primary tumours. Interestingly our study 
found an increase in quantity of mutations over time in the recurrences, 
most of all in chromatin regulatory genes but also in rarer Genes like 
LYST and HYDIN. In all cases histone modifiers (KMT, KDM) and 
CRC-family members especially coding for the SWI/SNF- and ISWI-
complexes (SMARC, ARID, PBRM) had a high number and variety 
of mutations.
The number of SNVs and InDels did not show significant differ-
ences between the primary and recurrent tumours.
Conclusion: The increasing number of alterations in chromatin-
regulatory genes in recurrences compared to primary tumours 
could point to a possible importance of these alterations in recur-
rence development and be the basis for new targeted therapy strat-
egies of chordoma. The progress in tumour mutation burden as 
well as copy number variations in recurrences were more limited 
compared to the genetic evolution of carcinomas with long time

recurrences. Further studies focusing on chromatin regulators 
could elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of chordoma.

Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma: a morphological, 
immunohistochemical and molecular analysis of 31 cases
A. Llombart-Bosch*, F. Giner, i. Machado, S. Navarro, A. 
Ferrandez Izquierdo
*Dep Pathology Univ. Valencia, Spain
Background & objectives: Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma 
(EMC) is a rare malignant tumour. Their spectrum is wide but 
a diagnosis based on histology can be difficult. NR4A3 gene 
rearrangement is the hallmark in these tumours but still lack 
specific immunohistochemical profile for this neoplasm.
Methods: We collected 31 cases diagnosed as EMC between 1999 
and 2018 from two institutions. Corresponding clinical data were 
recorded. We performed a histopathological and molecular study 
with a wide immunohistochemical panel.
Results: The mean age of our patients was 50 years with a range 
between 22 and 86 years. We found a slight predominance for 
males. The majority of EMCs showed a typical architectural pat-
tern. EMCs expressed (focal or positive) the following markers: 
FLI-1 (100%), CDK4 (100%), TRK-A (96.8%), STAT-6 (90.3%), 
CD99 (90.3%), CD117 (83.9%), HNK-1 (80.6%), SATB2 (67.7%) 
and S-100 (58.1%). Neuroendocrine markers chromogranin, synap-
tophysin and INSM1 showed intense and focal expression in 22.6%, 
22.6% and 38.7% of cases respectively. The EWSR1-NR4A3 rear-
rangement was found in 19 cases and 7 patients presented the TAF-
15-NR4A3 fusion. The TAF15-NRA43 rearrangement correlated 
with a non-typical histology (more cellular with solid pattern).
Conclusion: EMCs express some immunohistochemical markers 
which are used in diagnosis for other neoplasms that can also be 
positive for EMC and can cause extra difficulty for differential 
diagnosis in EMCs with non-typical histology and where molecu-
lar rearrangement is not informative. Some immunohistochemical 
markers such as CD99, CDK4, FLI-1, SATB2 and STAT6 may be 
considered positive in EMCs suggesting the possibility of incor-
porating these markers in the differential diagnosis with other 
entities.

A single-institution experience with 11 cases of extraskeletal 
myxoid chondrosarcoma: rare fusions, unusual morphology 
and the utility of INSM1 immunohistochemistry
N. Klubickova*, J. Lenz, M. Michal, M. Michal
*Bioptical Laboratory Ltd., Czech Republic
Background & objectives: Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma 
(EMC) is a rare soft tissue sarcoma of uncertain differentiation, 
most commonly driven by fusion of EWSR1 and NR4A3 genes. A 
recent report identified INSM1 as a useful immunohistochemical 
marker, being positive in 90% of EMC cases.
Methods: 11 cases of EMC from our institutional files where 
molecular genetic results were available were included in the study. 
Immunohistochemistry for INSM1 was performed in 10 cases. 
Targeted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using customized Archer 
FusionPlex Kits or FISH with EWSR1 and NR4A3 break-apart 
probes were carried out in 5 and 6 cases, respectively.
Results: 8/10 cases were positive for INSM1. However, only 4 
cases showed strong expression in more than 50% of tumour cells. 
Using FISH or targeted RNA-seq, the classic EWSR1::NR4A3 
fusion was detected in 7/11 cases. Less common TAF15::NR4A3 
and distinctly rare TCF12::NR4A3 fusions were detected in 1 case 
each. In 1 case, FISH was positive for NR4A3 but negative for 
EWSR1 rearrangement. 10 cases displayed typical morphology i.e., 
anastomosing cords of round/oval tumour cells situated in abun-
dant myxoid stroma, while the case with the TCF12::NR4A3 fusion 
showed a highly unusual morphology consisting of a solid cellular 
proliferation of bland monomorphic ovoid/spindled cells with only 
small foci of myxoid stroma.
Conclusion: Our analysis confirms that most cases of EMC are 
positive for INSM1. However, the diagnostic utility of this marker 
is limited by the fact that only 50% of cases show a strong INSM1 
expression in most tumour cells. Furthermore, our study highlights 
that EMC with alternative gene partners may present with unusual 
morphology. As illustrated by the case with the TCF12::NR4A3 
fusion, some of these cases can be confidently diagnosed only with 
the use of high throughput sequencing methods.

Differential Cyclin-E1 expression in CIC-rearranged sarcoma 
and Ewing sarcoma

F. Ardıc Yukruk
*Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Department 
of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: CIC-rearranged sarcomas(CRS) - one 
of EWSR1-negative undifferentiated round cell sarcoma(URS)- 
show more aggressive behaviour than Ewing Sarcoma(ES). 
As CCNE1 expression is associated with tumour growth in 
CIC::DUX4-rearranged CRS, we aimed to demonstrate the value 
of CyclinE1 expression in CRS.
Methods: CyclinE1 immunohistochemistry (Abcam, 1/50, EDTA) 
and break-apart FISH for EWSR1 and CIC gene rearrangements 
(ZytoLight, Zytovision) were performed on 3-mm tissue microar-
rays composed of 40 small round cell tumours. CyclinE1 expres-
sion was evaluated as low and high similar to the previous study 
by Wei et al (J Orthop Res. 2020;38(9):1952-1964).
Results: By morphology and FISH, 5 cases were CRS, and 22 
cases were ES, while 13 cases were regarded as URS. Among all 
three diagnostic groups, Cyclin E1 expression was higher in CRS 
(4/5,80%) and URS (8/13,62%) groups compared to ES (1/22,5%; 
p<0.001). Higher mean age at diagnosis, presence of atypical his-
tological findings (such as nuclear aberrations and myxoid stroma), 
lack of CD99 expression, and presence of metastasis at diagnosis 
were significantly associated with high CyclinE1 expression. The 
sensitivity and specificity of the high expression of CyclinE1 in 
detecting EWSR1(-) cases were 66.7% and 95.5%, respectively. 
However, the correlation between CyclinE1 expression level and 
survival was not statistically significant.
Conclusion: CyclinE1 expression is significantly lower in ES com-
pared to CRS and URS suggesting that it can be used as an adjunct 
in the diagnostic immune panel of small round cell sarcomas.

Background & objectives: Osteosarcoma is the most common 
primary malignant bone tumour in children and young adults. Not 
much work has been done to explore immunotherapy targeting 
PD1-PDL1 axis in osteosarcoma. This study shows correlation 
between PDL1 expression and TILs in high-grade osteosarcoma.
Methods: PDL1 expression by immunohistochemistry and 
TILs were evaluated in 40 resection specimens of high-grade 
osteosarcoma. A score of 0-3 was given for PDL1 expression. TILs 
were calculated under 400X (in 10 fields) and a score of 0-3 was 
given based on intensity. Clinical data was collected from record 
section.
Results: The mean age of presentation was 16 years with male to 
female ratio 1.6:1. The most common bone involved was femur 
followed by tibia. The most common site of metastasis was lung. 
PDL1 was positive in 82.5% cases (33/40). 17.5% (7/40) did not 
show PDL1 expression. 15% (6/40) showed a score of +1, 27.5% 
a score of +2 and 40% (16/40) a score of +3. It was observed that 
PDL1 expression correlated with TILs scoring (p=0.029). How-
ever, PDL1 expression and TILs did not correlate with any param-
eter like age; sex; histologic type; tumour size, site and necrosis; 
metastasis; progression and relapse; duration of chemotherapy; 
radiotherapy; follow up and survival data.
Conclusion: Our research shows that PDL1 is an independent 
marker in high-grade osteosarcoma and cannot be taken as a basis 
for judging progression of the disease. However, since in our study 
it correlated directly with the TILs density, it can be regarded as a 
potential therapeutic target for tumour immunotherapy.

Osteoblastoma-like osteosarcoma: a case series and literature 
review

Kaygusuz
*Ankara University Medical School, Pathology Department, 
Turkey
Background & objectives: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most com-
mon primary bone tumour in young adults and children. Osteoblas-
toma-like osteosarcoma (OBLOS) is a rare subtype that accounts 
approximately 1% of all OSs. In this study, we present three cases 
of OBLOS with clinicopathological correlation.
Methods: Gross materials were fixed with 10% buffered forma-
lin. After decalcification process, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) 
sections of 4-5 microns were obtained. The cases (n=3) were ana-
lysed according to their histopathological, radiological and clini-
cal features. In one case (talus localized lesion), beta-catenin was 
performed immunohistochemically.
Results: Two of the three cases were male and one female, and the 
mean age was 43.33 years. The tumours were located in the iliac 
bone, 4th finger of the hand, and talus. The cross-sectional surface 
of the tumours was solid and heterogeneous, and haemorrhagic 
areas were also observed. The tumours had infiltrative borders and 
were composed of oval-spindle shaped cells with vesicular nuclei 
and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Osteoclastic giant cells and mitoses 
were observed. Nuclear beta-catenin staining was not observed in 
the talus localized lesion. Two patients had a history of neoadju-
vant therapy and, the other patient died due to lung metastasis.
Conclusion: Two histological features are helpful in differential 
diagnosis of osteoblastoma, OBLOS. Permeation around host bone 
and loss of peripheral maturation of the lesion favours OBLOS, 
whereas osteoblastoma is well-defined and there is peripheral 
maturation. These lesions may be radiolucent/radiodense, and 
OBLOS can contain features of osteoblastoma and OS. Some 
studies revealed that COX2, FOS, beta-catenin immunoprofile dif-
fers between osteoblastoma-OBLOS. We consider that excisional 
biopsy is important to support this distinction, especially if radio-
logical findings cannot rule out or support malignancy.

Tommaso, F. Cananzi
*Humanitas Clinical and Research Center – IRCCS, Humanitas 
University, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Rozzano, Italy
Background & objectives: How sarcoma metastasize is unknown. 
VETC has been described as an epithelial-to-mesenchymal-tran-
sition independent process of metastasis: endothelium covers neo-
plastic clusters allowing tumour dissemination. Our aims are to 
assess the presence of VETC in sarcoma, and to model its prog-
nostic role.
Methods: The study was retrospective. We selected 54 cases of 
sarcomas (6_DDLPS, 10_GIST, 6_LMS, 9_MLPS, 8_MPNST, 10_
SFT, 5_UPS); of them 31 were metastatic (M1 group), 23 were not 
(M0 group, defined as least 5 years of negative follow-up). VETC 
was assessed with CD31 immunohistochemistry and defined as 
a continuous endothelial lining around tumour clusters. We used 
probabilistic modelling for the analysis.
Results: Within each histology, the two groups (M0 & M1) 
were substantially homogeneous: most (89%CI) of posterior 
probability(PP) difference –i.e. the contrast CPP– included 0 
for sex, age, size, and grade. VETC in SFT was basically only 
expressed in M1, with almost all the CPP mass above the 0. Also, 
in UPS and GIST, VETC was more probable to be in metastatic 
diseases with 79% and 78% respectively of the CPP mass above 0. 
VETC was prognostic of metastasis free survival in SFT and UPS 
with a coefficient of 2.42(CI_0.73–4.65) and 1.94(CI_0.16–3.67); 
only UPS reached median survival of 65 months(mo)(standard 
deviation, SD:74_mo) for VETC- Vs 11 mo (SD:14_mo) for 
VETC+.
Conclusion: VETC was present in all the investigated histotypes but 
two (MLPS, MPNST). VETC was prognostic of disease free survival in 
UPS and SFT. These findings warrants confirmations on a larger series. 
Moreover, in some carcinomas VETC has been shown to be predic-
tive of tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors (TKI) response; our results prompt 
us to to verify if this is also true for SFT, where TKI are often used in 
clinical practice.

tumour of bone(GCTB) from its various mimics. Lately, Histone 
3.3G34W has been identified as a useful immunohistochemical 
marker.
To evaluate H3.3G34W immunohistochemical staining in 67 
GCTBs.
Methods: Immunohistochemical staining for H3.3G34W 
(monoclonal, RM263, 1:100 dilution) was graded in terms of 
staining intensity(1+to 3+) and the percentage of tumour cells 
showing crisp nuclear staining. Seventy-one(65.7 %) GCTBs

occurred in patients 15-66 years old (average=32, median=9), 
in femur (26,36.6%), proximal tibia (11,15.5%), distal radius 
(9,12.6%), pelvis, including sacrum (8,11.2%) and other bones 
(17,23.9% ), including a single multicentric case.
Results: Out of 67 GCTBs, wherein H3F3G34W immunostaining 
worked, 55(82.1%) cases showed positive staining in the mononu-
clear cells, including tumours with fibrous histiocytoma-like areas, 
sparing the osteoclast-like giant cells. The average percentage of 
tumour cells showing positive immunostaining was 69%, with 
3+ staining intensity in 42/55(76.4%) cases and 2+ in 13(23.6%) 
GCTBs. All 4/4(100%) malignant GCTBs showed positive staining, 
including the mononuclear and pleomorphic/sarcomatous cells. 
Three(4.3%) cases developed metastasis(axillary nodes, mediasti-
num and lung). All 3/3(100%) metastatic GCTBs showed positive 
immunostaining in the metastatic lesions. Out of seven post-den-
osumab treated GCTBs, four showed no residual giant cells and 
lacked H3.3G34W immunostaining. None of the other 37 “giant 
cell-rich” lesions displayed H3.3G34W immunostaining.
Conclusion: The diagnostic sensitivity of H3.3G34W for GCTB 
was 82.1% and specificity was 100%. The present study, constitut-
ing one of the first reports from our country, further validates the 
value of H3.3G34W in differentiating GCTB, including metastatic 
and malignant type from its diagnostic mimics. Its utility in iden-
tifying residual tumour cells in post-denosumab treated GCTBs is 
worth exploring.

COVID-19 placentitis in pregnant women may be complicated 
by foetal death

P. Janega
*Institute of Pathological Anatomy, Comenius University, Brati-
slava, Slovakia
Background & objectives: Dominant clinical manifestations of 
the SARS-CoV-2 infection are in the lungs, however, pathological 
consequences of COVID-19 in different organs have been docu-
mented in multiple studies. Only limited data are available about 
the outcome of this infection in pregnant women.
Methods: Two cases of intrauterine death of the foetus in mothers 
after overcoming COVID-19 with mild symptoms were studied in 
detail. Placentas hebd. 38 and 35, respectively, were nodular, hard-
elastic, with whitish to dark pink areas affecting 70 – 80%. Autopsy 
of the babies was performed. No pathological abnormalities were 
grossly identified in either case.
Results: Microscopic evaluation of the placental tissue revealed 
broad intervillous and perivillous deposits of fibrin with marked 
histiocytic infiltration, scant lymphocytes and focally with neutro-
phils, especially in areas of forming infarctions. Inflammation of 
villi was not prominent. Immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridi-
zation proved the ongoing presence of syncytiotrophoblast infec-
tion by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This finding was also confirmed by 
the +PCR test from placental tissue samples. Histological evalu-
ation of tissues of the foetuses showed only mild interstitial lym-
phocytic infiltration in lungs and sporadic immunohistochemical 
and in-situ hybridization positivity of SARS-CoV-2 in individual 
cells in lungs and kidneys, which was also confirmed by the +PCR 
test in lung tissue samples.
Conclusion: The two presented cases documented the development 
of placentitis caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection after uncomplicated 
COVID-19. This process is associated with massive deposition 
of intervillous fibrin and placental infarctions with consequent 
ischemia and death of the foetus. Although the vertical transfer 
of the infection was documented, the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection 
did not contribute to the foetal demise in the presented cases. This 
rare complication of pregnancy appears to be independent of the 
seriousness of COVID-19 clinical course in the mother.

Histological and molecular features of placental and foetal 
tissues in pregnancies with SARS-CoV-2- positive mothers 
during second and third trimester: the Bergamo experience 
in vertical transmission

Arosio, L. Goisis, G. Massazza, E. Rigoli, P. Tebaldi, A. Gianatti
*Department of Pathology, Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Italy
Background & objectives: Intrauterine transplacental 
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to the foetus is rare but possible in 
infected pregnant women. According to WHO 2021 classification 
criteria, both stillborn and liveborn neonates appear to have the 
possibility to acquire transplacental COVID-19 infection prior 
to delivery.
Methods: During the first pandemic wave, two Covid-19 posi-
tive women delivered two positive babies at third trimester. In 
September 2021 a case of second trimester twin stillbirth have 
found positives to SarS-Cov-2 from an asymptomatic infected 
mother. All specimens collected were analysed by real time PCR, 
immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization RNA in order to 
detect and to localize SARS-CoV-2.
Results: All placentas showed unusual pathology abnormalities 
that include chronic histiocytic intervillositis with presence of 
CD68+ macrophages, syncytiotrophoblast necrosis and positiv-
ity of the syncytiotrophoblast for SARS-CoV-2 antigen or RNA. 
Notably, Hofbauer cells do not resulted infected by viral particles 
as outlined by double staining for CD163+(marker for Hofbauer 
cells) and ISH for SARS-CoV-2 (spike protein) RNA. Foetal 
autopsies didn’t show any malformations. The lung of the first 
foetus only showed interstitial pneumonia features with vascular 
congestion and neutrophilic infiltrate. Viral genome sequenc-
ing identified the lineage B.1.1 in two women who delivered 
in March 2020, while in the third positive woman, who aborted 
during the third pandemic wave, was detected B.1.36 lineage.
Conclusion: We gave evidence that SARS-CoV-2 vertical trans-
mission mother-foetus is possible also in second trimester of 
pregnancy and in asymptomatic pregnant women and can lead 
to severe morbidity. We found a specific histologic pattern in 
all infected placentas and our studies ruled out the pathogenic 
involvement of Hofbauer cells. Furthermore, as far as we know, it 
does not appear that different genetic variants of the virus affect 
its possible transplacental vertical transmission.

Diagnostic value of ITS sequencing in mucormycosis – a retro-
spective single-centre study

sity of Graz, Austria
Background & objectives: Mucormycosis is a fast-progressing 
disease with a high mortality rate. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is 
of utmost importance, but microbiological culture may lack sen-
sitivity. Molecular techniques are therefore increasingly recom-
mended; however, real-world data about their value are still sparse.
Methods: Between 2015 and 2022, we performed internal 
transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing in 491 tissue and body

fluid samples from 432 patients. Clinical, pathological, and 
microbiological data were extracted from medical records and 
correlated with sequencing results.
Results: Taxa from the order Mucorales could be detected in 
11/432 patients. 7 of these 11 patients were male, and the median 
age was 54 years (range 5-74 years). All 11 patients had severe 
comorbidities (9 with hematological cancers and 2 with other can-
cers; 1 had additionally COVID-19). Specimen sites included lung 
(6x), upper respiratory tract (2x), myocardium (2x), and soft tissue 
(1x). The most commonly detected Mucor species was Rhizopus 
microsporus (5x), followed by Lichtheimia corymbifera (2x), Rhiz-
opus oryzae (1x), Actinomucor elegans (1x), Rhizomucor pusillus 
(1x), and Rhizomucor miehei (1x). Microbiological culture was 
performed in 7 cases, always yielding negative results.
Conclusion: The rising incidence of mucormycosis in patients 
with COVID-19 has raised awareness of this rare but lethal 
fungal infection. Due to the fast-progressing clinical course of 
mucormycosis, early diagnosis is key. Our study demonstrates that 
ITS sequencing is a reliable tool in diagnosing this devastating 
disease with a much higher sensitivity than microbiological 
culture. Thus, especially when combined with histopathology, 
ITS sequencing enables a rapid and accurate diagnosis of 
mucormycosis, with important implications for clinical practice.

*Spitalul Clinic de Boli Infecțioase și Pneumoftiziologie Dr.Victor 
Babeș Timișoara, Romania
Background & objectives: A few and inconclusive data are 
reported about the broad analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), 
a demonstrated safe procedure in COVID-19 patients. We aim to 
report the comprehensive cytological, microbiological, and molec-
ular analysis of BAL from critically ill COVID-19 patients.
Methods: BAL fluid was obtained from 12 COVID-19 patients 
admitted in the intensive care unit in the second wave (February 
2021 - May 2021). BAL from lung transplant recipients (n=12), 
and lung donors (n=12), represented the ‘fragile’ and ‘healthy’ 
control groups, respectively. Cytological analysis, microbiologi-
cal investigation (culture and molecular determination), and wide 
cytokine expression analysis using Real-Time PCR were performed.
Results: SARS-CoV-2 (mainly A variant) was positive only in 
severe COVID-19 patients. Microbiological analysis showed 
bacterial coinfections with K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and 
S. aureus in COVID-19 and transplant patients. Fungal coinfec-
tions were found only in COVID-19 patients (C. albicans and A. 
fumigatus). Molecular analysis identified the viral coexistence 
of Epstein Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex 
virus type-1 in both COVID-19 and lung transplant groups; lung 
donors were negative for all microorganisms. The molecular 
cytokine profile in the COVID-19 group was remarkable for a 
low expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and significantly 
overexpression of interleukins (IL) IL-1β, and IL-9.
Conclusion: The full comprehensive analysis of BAL is crucial 
to specifically detect frequent coinfections in patients with severe 
COVID19 pneumonia. IL-1β, and IL-9 overexpression could represent 
a possible therapeutic target. Although confirmation is required on 
larger case series, the obtained results underline a complex and overall 
different inflammatory profile in COVID-19 BAL in comparison to 
blood or upper airways as reported in the literature.

Background & objectives: The molecular subtypes of 
urothelial carcinoma may impact the outcomes after neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy in muscle invasive bladder cancer. Our aim was 
to assess the 3-year progression free survival according to the 
consensus molecular subtypes within the prospective Vesper 
clinical trial.
Methods: 493 patients received dd-MVAC or GC after randomi-
zation in the VESPER trial (NCT01812369). This ancillary study 
was restricted to neoadjuvant treated patients. To take into account 
intra-tumoural heterogeneity, we performed 3’ mRNA sequenc-
ing of distinct tumour areas when morphology and/or multiplexed 
GATA3 Cytokeratin 5/6 TUBB2a immunostaining highlighted 
distinct pattern. Consensus molecular subtype was determined for 
each area from transcriptomic profile.
Results: Out of 296 cases, 97 with heterogeneous immunostain-
ing were selected for multiple sampling. For 251 cases, one single 
subtype was detected per tumour (i.e. pure): 37 luminal papillary, 
60 luminal unstable, 17 luminal non specified, 53 stroma-rich, 81 
basal/squamous and 3 neuroendocrine-like. 45 cases were mixed 
with 2 or more subtypes (27 with basal/squamous component). 
Pathological response was not different between pure subtypes but 
was decreased for mixed cases (OR adjusted for randomization 
arm: 0.43, 95% CI 0.19-0.96, p=0.040). Compared with luminal 
and stroma rich, the 3yr PFS was decreased for basal/squamous, 
either pure or admixed with another subtype (HR adjusted for ran-
domization arm: 2.16, 95% CI 1.46-3.20, p<1e-3).
Conclusion: In the VESPER trial, the basal/squamous molecular 
subtype (pure or mixed) is associated with a decreased 3 yr PFS 
after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Further studies will investigate 
the molecular basis associated with this adverse feature and explore 
new systemic treatments for the basal/squamous subtype.

Background & objectives: Testicular neoplasms of sex-cord or 
stromal derivation that cannot be definitively classified into a spe-
cific tumour subtype are designated "unclassified sex-cord stromal 
tumours" (USCSTs). Given the rarity of USCSTs, their clinico-
pathologic and molecular features remain largely unexplored.
Methods: This study evaluated a multi-institutional series of tes-
ticular USCSTs to better define the spectrum of tumours comprised 
in this diagnostic category. Twenty-six USCSTs from 25 patients

diagnosed between 1996 and 2021 were evaluated by review of 
histology slides, review of clinicopathologic data and massively 
parallel DNA sequencing. Further evaluation by comparative meth-
ylation profiling was conducted on a subset of tumours.
Results: Cytomorphologic patterns included monophasic spindled 
(5/26), monophasic epithelioid (10/26), and biphasic or mixed 
(11/23). Histopathologic features suggestive of malignancy (size 
>5 cm, invasive growth, necrosis or prominent mitotic activity) 
were seen in 11 cases. DNA sequencing was successful in 19 
tumours. Two molecular patterns emerged, including recurrent 
whole-chromosome gains of 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 17 and 20. 
(5/23), and pathogenic mutations in the WNT signalling pathway 
(8/19). A subset of WNT-altered tumours showed methylation 
profiles consistent with Sertoli cell tumours, NOS. Follow-up for 
fifteen cases included 9 patients alive without disease (median 9 
mo), 4 alive with disease (median 7 mo), and 2 dead of disease.
Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that USCSTs 
comprise tumours with variable clinicopathologic features and 
molecular alterations. Two major trends emerged in the cytologic 
and molecular analysis that facilitated re-classification of ~40% 
tumours into distinct sex cord stromal tumour entities, including 
a significant proportion driven by mutations of WNT pathway 
genes (CTNNB1, APC), some of which could be reclassified as 
Sertoli Cell tumours, NOS. The remaining unclassified tumours 
were enriched for aggressive pathological features and malignant 
clinical behaviour.

son Cancer Center, USA
Background & objectives: Combined alterations in TP53 with 
RB1 and/or PTEN characterize aggressive variant prostate cancers 
(AVPC) and are associated with androgen indifference and lineage 
plasticity. A measurable definition of lineage plasticity is needed to 
enable the development of ‘plasticity-inhibiting’ therapies.
Methods: MDA PCa-177-B (AR-negative, basal expression pro-
file) and MDA PCa-189-1 (AR-positive, luminal expression pro-
file) are AVPC PDX models derived from one patient’s prostate 
tumour, before and after chemotherapy respectively. They share a 
p.Y163N Tp53 mutation, suggesting a common clonal origin. We 
performed scRNAseq, DNA methylation profiling and H3K27me3, 
H3K27ac and H3K4me3 ChIPseq to identify a shared candidate 
signature of lineage plasticity.
Results: scRNAseq analysis revealed clusters with a “high-plastic-
ity cell state” (HPCS), in each PDX, characterized by a diversity 
of lineage identities, similar to that associated with aggressive fea-
tures and progression in lung cancer mouse models (Marjanovic 
et al., 2020). ChIPseq of histone markers (H3K27ac, H3K27me3, 
H3K4me3) and DNA methylation profiling showed shared chro-
matin profiles at enhancer and super-enhancer regions linked to 
lineage plasticity events. Taken together, these results suggest that 
lineage plasticity events drive the evolution of lethal PCa and iden-
tified a cell plasticity signature for AVPC.
Conclusion: We identified shared HPCS clusters and chromatin 
profiles in phenotypically distinct PDX, which may serve as 
candidate signatures of lineage plasticity. Ongoing analyses are 
determining the association between the chromatin profiles and 
the HPCS clusters to arrive at clinically applicable markers. 
Future studies will determine the effect of drugs presumed to 
target plasticity on these candidate signatures. These markers 
will be tested as prognostic indicators and may help identify 
tumours destined to follow the aggressive variant pathway of PCa 
progression.

*Institut Curie, Pathology department, Saint-Cloud, France
Background & objectives: Extensive analyses of transcriptomic 
data in large datasets of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) 
have resulted in a consensus molecular classification. Our objective 
was to determine the relevance of the consensus classification in 
≥pT1 upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).
Methods: We constituted a novel cohort of ≥pT1 UTUC patients 
with clinico-pathological data. We evaluated GATA3-CK5/6-
TUBB2B in multiplex, CK20, p16, MMR proteins and PD-L1 
expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Heterogeneity was 
assessed morphologically and/or with subtype marker IHC expres-
sion. FGFR3 mutational status was determined using pyrosequenc-
ing. Gene expression was profiled using 3’ RNA-seq for each 
tumour, including multiple samples in heterogeneous cases.
Results: In our cohort of 66 patients with ≥pT1 UTUC, the 
majority were men (77.3%) with pT1 (35.4%) or pT3 (46.2%) 
stage disease. FGFR3 mutations and MSI-H status were identi-
fied in 41.5% and 4.7% of patients, respectively. The consen-
sus classifier was robustly applicable to UTUC samples and 
reflected intrinsic subtypes, determined by unsupervised clus-
tering. The proportion of LumP samples (68.4% in ≥pT1, 57.2% 
in ≥pT2 UTUC) was significantly higher than in MIBC. Ten 
patients (15.2%) harboured areas of distinct consensus classes. 
Consensus classes were associated with FGFR3 mutational sta-
tus, pT stage, morphology and subtype IHC. The majority of 
LumP tumours were characterized by low immune infiltration 
and low PD-L1 IHC expression.
Conclusion: We characterized a novel cohort of 66 patients 
with ≥pT1 UTUC based on morphology, immunohistochemistry, 
FGFR3 mutation status and transcriptomics. The consensus clas-
sification of MIBC efficiently classified UTUC samples, and 
highlighted intratumoural molecular heterogeneity. In contrast 
to MIBCs, the majority of ≥pT1 UTUC patients harboured a 
LumP tumour, a class mostly characterized by low immune infil-
tration, low PD-L1 expression and a high proportion of FGFR3 
mutations. These findings may suggest differential response to 
novel therapies between UTUC and MIBC patients.

Background & objectives: A combination of different immune-
checkpoint-inhibitors (ICIs) have shown remarkable success in sev-
eral tumour entities. However, the likelihood of positive response 
to ICIs is poor in most tumour entities. Little is known about the 
spatial orchestration between immune checkpoint+ cells.
Methods: To study the spatial interplay between TIM3, PD-L1, 
PD-1, and CTLA-4 expression on lymphocyte-, macrophage 
subsets, dendritic cells, in relation to panCK+ malignant 
cells, and other structural tumour compartments, a 18 marker 
BLEACH&STAIN multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry 
approach was used to analyse >5000 carcinoma samples from 40 
different carcinoma entities. A deep learning-based framework for 
image analysis was used.
Results: TIM3, PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 expression was 
successfully quantified on tumour cells (panCK+), cytotoxic 
T-cells (CD3+CD8+), T-helper cells (CD3+CD4+), regulatory 
T-cells (CD3+CD4+FOXP3+), M1 and M2 macrophages 
(CD68+CD163+/ CD68+ CD163-) and dendritic cells (CD11c+). 
TIM3 as well as CTLA-4 expression on CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic 
T-cells and CD3+CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T-cells showed a 
spatially more diverse expression pattern – particularly in bladder 
cancer – compared to PD-1 expression on all analysed T-cells 
subsets that was consistently accompanied by PD-L1 expression 
on immune and tumour cells (p<0.001). A high density of immune 
checkpoint positive T-cells, macrophages and dendritic cells was 
linked to low pT stage (p≤0.014 each).
Conclusion: BLEACH&STAIN facilitates deep profiling of 18 bio-
markers in more than 40 different carcinoma entities and revealed 
complex changes in the spatial orchestration of a wide range of 
immune cell subsets that were driven by the expression profile and 
composition of TIM3, PD-L1, PD-1 and CTLA-4.

Background & objectives: This study aimed to prospectively 
evaluate the performance and clinical utility of the AI-based Galen 
Second Read Prostate workflow solution on detection of prostate 
adenocarcinoma in real world clinical routine use.
Methods: A prospective, single-centre observational diagnostic 
study including digitized histopathology slides of all consecutive 
prostate core needle biopsies (CNBs), TRUS and MRI-targeted, 
was performed. Slides were blindly processed by the AI solu-
tion, while, in parallel, pathologists reviewed the cases. Alerts 
were triggered in case of discrepancies between the AI results 
and initial pathologist’s diagnosis, prompting a second review 
by the pathologist.
Results: Five senior pathologists participated in the study 
and reported on 109 prostate CNBs comprising 2,684 H&E 
slides, 60% of which were MRI-targeted biopsies that had up 
to 66 H&E slides/case. Analysis was performed at block level, 
109 cases comprised 986 blocks, 190 (19.3%) were reported 
as adenocarcinoma, 2 (0.2%) as ASAP and 794 (80.5%) were 
benign. The AI solution demonstrated extremely high perfor-
mance for detection of cancer with AUC = 0.994 (95% CI: 
0.991-0.997), sensitivity of 96.9%, specificity of 94.96% and 
NPV of 99.21%. Moreover, following the second review by 
the pathologists, five alerted cases were revised from benign 
to cancer, leading to 4.6% decrease in diagnostic error rate.
Conclusion: This prospective study reports the successful 
deployment of the Galen Prostate diagnostic support solution, in 
routine clinical practice. The AI solution enabled 100% Quality 
Control on prostate biopsies and increased diagnostic accuracy 
and patient safety, decreasing diagnostic errors by 4.6% and pre-
venting missed cancers. Thus, AI solutions could be used as sig-
nificant aiding tools for pathologists in clinical decision-making 
in routine pathology practice.

Research Hospital, Rozzano, Italy
Background & objectives: Low-grade oncocytic and eosinophilic 
vacuolated tumours (LOT and EVT) have been proposed as dis-
tinct entities with low malignant potential in the spectrum of renal 
oncocytic neoplasms. We report 16 further cases of these rare and 
controversial categories with clinico-pathological description.
Methods: Oncocytomas (RO), Hybrid Tumours (HT), and Chromo-
phobe carcinomas (ChRCC) diagnosed in our Institution from 2015 
to 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. On all selected cases, we 
performed immunohistochemical analysis for CD117 and CK7 to 
identify LOTs and EVTs. Histological features, phenotype, molecu-
lar profile, and clinical data were recorded.
Results: From 431 tumours, 7 LOTs and 9 EVTs were identified. 
Male/female ratio was 1:1,3 and 2:1, with median age of 67 and 58 
yrs, and median size of 2,7 and 4,2 cm, respectively. LOTs over-
lapped RO/ChRCC with eosinophilic cytoplasm and perinuclear 
halos; EVTs showed intracytoplasmic vacuoles and atypical nuclei. 
LOTs were positive for CK7, CKpan, CD63, AMACR, CD15 (but 
CD117 negative overlapping ChRCC). EVT were positive for 
CD117, AMACR, CKpan, and CD10 (but CK7 negative/focally+, 
opposed to LOT/ChRCC). Interestingly, EVTs CKpan immunoreac-
tivity often reflected a biphasic cellularity (6/9 cases). Rearranged 
genes in mTOR pathway were occasionally found in both tumours. 
Both LOTs and EVTs behaved indolently (follow-up 9-72 months).
Conclusion: Here, we described a further group of LOTs and EVTs 
from a retrospective cohort analysis. Our data confirm LOT and 
EVT as emerging entities with peculiar histological features, a 
specific immune-profile, and indolent behaviour, which should 
be identified among “pink” tumours of the kidney. In the future, 
these tumours deserve further clinico-pathological studies for pro-
moting the awareness and improving classification of these new 
categories that will be described in the 2022 Genitourinary WHO 
classification.

transurethral resections (TUR) in retrospective studies. We aimed 
to validate ROL system on a prospective large mono-institutional 
series.
Methods: From 2013 to 2020, we adopted ROL for all patients 
with pT1HGUC on TUR and collected clinico-pathological data. 
We employed a cut-off of 1 mm (or diameter of an objective 20x 
high-power field) to stratify tumours in ROL1 and ROL2, corre-
sponding to one invasive focus or multiple foci extending together 
for <1 mm and for >1 mm, respectively.
Results: A total of 229 confirmed pT1HGUC were analysed. Mean 
age was 73yrs, with male predominance (74.7%); 70 tumours 
showed multifocality (30.57%), 33 divergent differentiation 
(14.4%). Associated CIS and vascular invasion occurred in 14% and 
9% of cases. ROL was feasible in all but one case (99.6%): 94 cases 
were ROL1 (41%) and 134 ROL2 (59%). At a median follow up of 
23 months (IQR 12.33-38.5), 59 patients had recurrence (25.76%) 
and 37 progression (16%). ROL predicted progression in univariate 
(OR= 3.58, 95% CI 1.50-8.56; p=0.004) and multivariate (OR= 
2.95, 95% CI 1.11-7.87; p=0.03) Cox regression analysis. At 
Kaplan-Meier estimates, ROL showed correlation with progression 
(p<0.01), but not with recurrence (p>0.05).
Conclusion: Our results confirmed the strong predictive role of 
ROL system for progression in pT1HGUC on a large prospective 
series. The management of pT1HGUC patients is still a challeng-
ing issue in urological practice, and depth and amount of lamina 
propria tumour invasion is a key prognostic variable. We foster the 
application of ROL system for substaging T1HGUC, a simple and 
feasible method alternative to pT1a/b that might identify high-risk 
patients and drive urological decision-making.

Background & objectives: Tumour grade determines prognosis in 
urothelial carcinoma. The two-tiered classification of low and high 
grade is based on nuclear morphological features. The purpose of 
this study is to assess the value of computer-based image analysis 
tool for urothelial carcinoma grading.
Methods: 400 images of urothelial tumours were graded by five 
pathologists and one uropathologist using a scale of 1 (lowest 
grade) to 5 (highest grade). A computer algorithm was used to 
segment the nuclei and to provide 40 morphometric parameters for 
each nucleus, which were used to establish the grading algorithm. 
Grading algorithm was compared to pathologists’ agreement.
Results: In the training cohort 10 different nuclear parameters 
showed >85% agreement with the uropathologist’s score. All 10 
parameters showed >85% agreement with the uropathologist’s 
score in the independent validation cohort. Three parameters 
showed 94.5% agreement in the validation cohort. The agreement 
of the pathologists with the uropathologist ranged from 88.5% to 
97.5%. Unexpectedly, the parameter that was most associated with 
grade was the 10th percentile of the nuclear circumference, and 
high grade was surprisingly associated with lower 10th percentile 
nuclei, caused by the presence of more inflammatory cells in the 
high-grade tumours.
Conclusion: Quantitative nuclear features could be applied to 
quantitate urothelial carcinoma grade. AI assisted grading systems 
could explore new nuclear parameters with better correlation to 
grade than those currently used.

*IRCCS Fondazione Istituto Tumouri, Italy
Background & objectives: PURE 01 trial enrolled 143 patients 
who received 3 cycles of pembrolizumab (IO) every 3 weeks 
before radical cystectomy. We compared tumour-microenvironment 
immune markers expression in pre-IO TURB specimens in com-
plete/major and non-responders to identify features associated with 
pathologic response.
Methods: Immunohistochemistry expression of CD3, CD8, 
CD68-KP1, CD163, CD20, PD1, PD-L1, MHC-I, HLA-DR 
and Beta2-microglobulin on tumour cells and tumour-
microenvironment was evaluated in 18 complete responders 
(CR: ypT0), 6 major responders (MR: ypTa/ypT1) and 19 non-
responders (NR: ypT2/ypT3, N0 or N+) with a semiquantitative 
count of the positive cells percentage (0, 0%; 1, <25%; 2 , 25-50%; 
3, 51-74%; 4, 75-100%).
Results: Seven markers (CD8, stromal or tumour PD-L1, HLA-DR 
on tumour cells and B2M on tumour cells) were significantly more 
expressed (p value range: 0.001 to 0.048) on TURB lesions from 
responders (CR + MR) compared to non responders (N0 or N+). 
In addition to such markers, patients achieving a CR, compared to 
non responders, showed significantly higher expression of CD68 
and CD163, of PD-1 on lymphocytes, as well as of tumour MHC-I 
molecules. Comparison of lesions from patients with CR vs MR 
revealed significant differences for CD3, CD163, PD-1 and MHC-I, 
all these markers being more frequently expressed on the former 
group compared to the latter.
Conclusion: The tumour immune microenvironment of pre-therapy 
TURB lesions of patients achieving a complete or major patho-
logic response after neoadjuvant pembrolizumab shows significant 
enrichment for T cells and myeloid cells, for stromal or tumour 
PD-L1 as well as increased MHC-I expression on tumour cells 
compared to lesions from non responders.

CD163+ M2 macrophage tissue infiltration and urinary soluble 
CD163 in IgA nephropathy
V. Agrawal*, S. Singh, S. Kamthan, N. Prasad, V. Agarwal
*SGPGIMS, India
Background & objectives: Macrophages play an important role 
in renal inflammation and fibrosis. We evaluated M2 macrophage 
(CD163+) infiltration in IgAN and correlated it with other param-
eters of monocyte activation including monocyte-derived circu-
lating microparticles (MMPs), urinary soluble CD163 (sCD163), 
KIM-1 and MCP-1.
Methods: Twenty-one IgAN, classified with Oxford MEST-C 
score, two age and sex-matched healthy and four Lupus Nephri-
tis (LN) disease controls were included. Plasma MMPs (Annex-
inV+/CD14+), quantified by flow cytometry were estimated as % 
of total MPs. CD163 immunohistochemistry (clone-EP324) was 
performed on renal biopsies and quantified in glomeruli and the 
tubulo-interstitium. Urinary sCD163, KIM-1 and MCP-1 levels 
were estimated by ELISA.

Results: The mean age in IgAN was 34±10 years; fourteen 
were males; mean s. creatinine 3.1±1.8mg/dl and 24-hour 
proteinuria 2.5±0.8gm/day. Mean circulating MPs levels 
in IgAN, LN and healthy were 8.1x105/μl, 6.7x103/μl and 
2.4x105/μl, respectively. MMPs in IgAN constituted 54% 
of total MPs. Mean urinary sCD163, KIM-1 and MCP-1 in 
IgAN, LN and healthy controls were 11.4ng/ml, 27ng/ml 
and 0.18ng/ml; 2.5ng/ml, 1.84ng/ml and 0.37ng/ml; 2.3ng/
ml, 7.05ng/ml and 0.13ng/ml respectively. CD163+ mac-
rophages in IgAN were 4.8±5.1/glomeruli and correlated 
significantly with presence of endocapillary hypercellularity 
(E1) and crescents (C2). The mean number of CD163+ cells 
in tubulo-interstitium were 69±35/hpf. Urinary sCD163 lev-
els correlated significantly with number of CD163+ cells 
in glomeruli.
Conclusion: We found monocyte activation and M2 (CD163+) 
macrophage tissue infiltration in IgAN. M2 macrophage tissue 
infiltration and urinary sCD163 levels correlate with prolifera-
tive glomerular changes suggesting its role in the early active 
stage of renal disease. Urinary sCD163 may act as non-invasive 
biomarker in assessing active proliferative lesions in IgAN.

*Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, 
University of Novi Sad; Center for Medical and Pharmaceutical 
Research and Quality Control (CEMPhIC), Faculty of Medicine, 
University of Novi Sad, Serbia
Background & objectives: Aristolochic acid nephropathy is a 
chronic tubulointerstitial renal disease in which important symp-
toms can be proteinuria and albuminuria. In this study, we exam-
ined glomerular morphometric features and protein excretions in 
NMRI mice treated with aristolochic acid I.
Methods: Experimental animals were treated intraperitoneally 
with 10 mg/kg aristolochic acid I for seven consecutive days, 
vehicle control received 2.5% polyethylene glycol 400, and the 
control received saline only. The experiment lasted 60 days, with 
several different euthanasia time points for light and transmission 
electron microscopy glomerular injury assessment. Nestin and 
WT1 were used as immunohistochemical markers for identify-
ing podocytes.
Results: For every euthanasia time point, mean mesangial score 
in glomeruli between aristolochic acid treated mice and control 
groups showed no significant difference. Furthermore, glomeruli 
of aristolochic acid treated mice had a decreased number of WT1 
positive podocytes, lower cytoplasmic nestin expression and area 
fraction than mice that received 2.5% polyethylene glycol 400 
and saline. In addition, ultrastructural changes of podocytes in 
the aristolochic acid treated group, observed under a transmis-
sion electron microscope, indicate foot process effacement, kary-
opyknosis, and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane 
with electron-dense deposits. Significant albuminuria occurred 
in experimental animals from later experiment phases compared 
with control groups.
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that exposure to aristolochic 
acid I induce glomerular damage by reducing the number of 
podocytes and affecting the normal functioning of the glomerular 
filtration barrier, thus serving as valuable data in further research 
related to the treatment of aristolochic acid nephropathy.

Deep learning-based histopathologic segmentation of peritu-
bular capillaries in kidney transplant biopsies
D. van Midden*, M. Hermsen, E. Steenbergen, L. Hilbrands, J. 
van der Laak
*Radboud University Medical Center, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Peritubular capillaritis scoring is 
an important feature for diagnosing antibody-mediated rejection 
(ABMR). This task suffers from interobserver variability and 
might benefit from automation. As a first step towards automatic 
peritubular capillaritis quantification, we developed a peritubular 
capillary (PTC) segmentation algorithm.
Methods: Kidney transplant biopsies (n=54) were 1) stained 
with periodic-acid Schiff (PAS), 2) scanned into whole-slide 
images (PAS WSI), 3) re-stained using CD34-antibody, and 
4) scanned again (CD34 WSI). Guided by the CD34 WSI, a 
pathologist manually annotated approximately 19.000 PTCs on 
the PAS WSI. The dataset was used to train (n=40) and test 
(n=14) a deep learning (DL)-based network.
Results: We developed a U-net DL network architecture, with an 
Efficientnetb2 backbone and a pre-trained encoder using ImageNet. 
The network was trained using 12,000 patches (512 x 512 pixels) 
per epoch. Various techniques were applied to prevent overfitting 
and to improve the model’s generalization. Training the network 
on a resolution of 0.5 μm/pixel using a non-PTC/PTC ratio of 3:1 
yielded an F1 score of 0.74, with a precision and recall of 0.78 and 
0.70, respectively. We observed reduced performance on cases with 
prominent interstitial alterations, as PTCs become less recogniz-
able, while certain pathologies mimic PTCs (e.g. atrophic tubules, 
matrix deposition).
Conclusion: This study presents a DL-based algorithm for the 
segmentation of PTCs in PAS-stained kidney transplant biopsies. 
This is a first step towards a more accurate, reproducible scor-
ing of peritubular capillaritis using DL. The results highlight the 
applicability of DL for clinical use to guide pathologist in routine 
diagnostics. Next steps will include incorporation of this algorithm 
in the development of a fully automated Banff classification algo-
rithm, as part of our DIAGGRAFT project, funded by the Dutch 
Kidney Foundation.

Training a deep learning model for quantification of fibrosis in 
non-neoplastic kidney biopsies - a feasibility study
N. Mola, E. Hodneland, H. Weishaupt, S. Leh*
*Haukeland University Hospital, Norway
Background & objectives: Interstitial fibrosis is a key prognos-
tic marker of kidney disease. Accurate quantification is therefore 
important. The study aim is to develop a deep learning algorithm 
for quantification of interstitial fibrosis that can be used on hae-
matoxylin-eosin (HE) stained kidney sections.
Methods: To create annotated training data, tissue sections were 
first stained with HE and then - after destaining - with sirius red. 
Masks of the sirius-red stained fibrosis areas were created using 
conventional image analysis. A deep learning algorithm was trained 
with these masks to measure fibrosis in the identical HE stained 
slide. The model performance was validated with the F-statistics.
Results: The advantage of this approach is that time and resource 
consuming manual annotations of the fibrosis areas are avoided but 
supervised learning still can be performed. A deep neural network 
based on U-Net was used for image segmentation. HE and the 
mask images were divided into tiles (512 x 512 pixels). Feasibility 
of the method was tested in a pilot study with 10 representative 
renal biopsies with varying degrees of interstitial fibrosis. The deep

learning model was able to learn from the masks and found the 
fibrotic areas in the HE stained digital sections with an associated 
F-score of 0.76 in the validation data set.
Conclusion: The proposed method is feasible and can provide a 
rapid and reproducible quantitative result for interstitial fibrosis 
in HE stained kidney biopsies. We will train and fine-tune the 
deep learning model with more data and expect to see even better 
performance. The model will then be tested for robustness in an 
independent cohort.

Relationship between immunosuppressive treatment, morphol-
ogy, and gene expression in T-cell-mediated rejection of the 
transplanted kidney
D. Dobi*, S. Chandran, J.R. Greenland, F. Vincenti, Z. Laszik
*Semmelweis University, Hungary
Background & objectives: Belatacept preserves renal function 
better than calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based immunosuppression. 
However, higher frequency of first-year T-cell-mediated rejection 
(TCMR) in belatacept-treated patients hampered the adoption of 
costimulation blockade. We set out to study the patomechanism of 
TCMR in this patient group.
Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded renal biopsy samples 
were analysed from 92 patients stratified by histopathologic 
diagnosis (TCMR, borderline changes, or normal) and 
immunosuppression regimen (belatacept, CNI). We applied 
gene expression analysis and whole slide inflammatory cell 
quantification to assess the impact of belatacept on intragraft 
immune signature.
Results: Ninety-one percent of genes overexpressed in TCMR 
showed significant correlation with whole-section inflammatory 
load. There were 27 genes that had a positive association with 
belatacept treatment. These were mostly related to myeloid cells 
and innate immunity. Genes negatively associated with costimula-
tion blockade (n=14) could be linked to B-cell differentiation and 
proliferation.
Conclusion: We concluded that expression levels of genes char-
acteristic of TCMR are strongly interconnected with quantitative 
changes of the biopsy inflammatory load. Our results might sug-
gest differential involvement of the innate immune system, and 
an altered B-cell engagement during TCMR in belatacept-treated 
patients relative to CNI-treated referents.

Multi-case learning model for predicting EGFR and KRAS 
gene mutation in non-small cell lung cancer
Y. Ding, C. Wu, Y. Zhao, J. Yao, Y. Liu*
*The Fourth Hospital, China
Background & objectives: To develop an artificial intelligence 
learning model for predicting EGFR and KRAS gene mutation in 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by integrating the information 
of pathological images.
Methods: 934 NSCLC biopsy whole slice images (WSIs) were 
collected. EGFR and KRAS gene mutation were detected by next-
generation sequencing (NGS). The WSIs were divided into train-
ing set, validation set and test set, and a transformer-based multi-
instance learning (T-MIL) model was developed to predict EGFR 
and KRAS gene mutation. Moreover, T-MIL model was compared 
with the other models.
Results: The area under the cure (AUC) was 0.711 by using T-MIL 
model to predict EGFR gene mutation, and the sensitivity, specific-
ity, the positive predictive value (PPV), and the negative predictive 
value (NPV) were 81.6%, 55.6%, 61.7%, 77.5%, respectively. For 
predicting KRAS gene mutation, T-MIL model AUC value was 
0.601, and the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 56.2%, 
65.1%, 13.2%, 94.0%, respectively. Compared with other learn-
ing models, including attention-based multiple instance learning 
(A-MIL) and RNN architecture for bag representation generation in 
MIL (RNN-MIL), T-MIL model demonstrated better performance. 
For EGFR gene mutation, the AUC value were 0.485, 0.6767, 0.711 
respectively, and 0.5753, 0.5593, 0.601 respectively for KRAS 
gene mutation.
Conclusion: We developed a T-MIL learning model for predicting 
NSCLC gene mutation, and demonstrated well performance. 
Its performance in predicting EGFR mutation was better than 
KRAS(AUC 0.711 vs 0.601). Our research proved that the 
performance of T-MIL learning model through pathological images 
was better than A-MIL and RNN-MIL model in predicting key 
driver gene mutation.

*Department of Pathology, Hôpital Bichat, Assistance Publique - 
Hôpitaux de Paris, France
Background & objectives: Three cancer-associated fibroblasts 
(CAFs) subtypes have been recently identified in breast cancer, 
characterized by the differential expression of FAP and ANTXR1. 
We aimed to assess, in NSCLC, the association of these CAF 
subtypes with histological features, immune environment and 
prognosis.
Methods: Expression of FAP and ANTXR1 was assessed by 
immunohistochemistry (H-score) on tissue micro-array built from 
a retrospective series of 186 NSCLC surgical samples. Three 
CAF subtypes were defined by the differential expression of FAP 
and ANTXR1 (FAPLow; FAPHigh/ANTXR1Low; FAPHigh/
ANTXR1High) and correlated with histological features, immune 
environment (assessed by CD8, CD4, and FOXP3 expression) and 
prognosis.
Results: 82 adenocarcinomas (ADC) and 104 squamous cell 
carcinomas (SCC) were included. We found a predominance 
of FAPHigh/ANTXR1High CAFs in SCC and FAPLow CAFs 
in ADC (p<0.001). In SCC, FAPhigh/ANTXR1low CAFs were 
associated with a higher CD8/CD4+CD8 ratio (p=0.02), but 
there was no correlation of CAFs subtypes and the immune envi-
ronment in ADC. In ADC, a higher proportion of FAPHigh/
ANTXR1High CAFs was detected in poorly differentiated 
tumours (p<0.001). Finally, in ADC, tumours with FAPHigh/
ANTXR1High CAFs were associated with a poorer disease-free 
survival in patients that did not have adjuvant chemotherapy 
(p<0.05). In SCC, no association of CAFs subtypes with disease 
free survival was found.
Conclusion: These three CAF subtypes are differentially expressed 
between ADC and SCC, and are associated with the immune envi-
ronment in SCC and with tumour differentiation and disease free 
survival in ADC. These preliminary results suggest that FAP and 
ANTXR1 could be used as prognostic biomarkers in ADC.

*V.A. Almazov Research Center, Russia
Background & objectives: Lung fibrosis is considered as one 
of the most significant lesions in late stages of acute COVID-19 
infection and post Covid syndrome. Many questions related to its 
pathogenesis and sequels remain unclear.
Methods: We studied lungs in 16 lethal cases with known geno-
type of SARSCOVi2, nearby routine methods the slices were 
stained according Mallory, IHC included sera against macrophages 
CD68+, CD163+ and collagens of 1 and 3 types. In 14 cases the 
slices, stained for CD68+ cells were scanned and then counted with 
the help of morphometric program and related to square.
Results: We found that fibrosis was practically equally expressed 
in all cases nevertheless exact duration of the disease, which 
was difficult to evaluate in several cases. Genotype of the virus. 
Collagen was of both types 1 and 3, with the prevalence of the 
latter. The number of CD68+ macrophages varied from 27 till 
93/ mm2. Notable that both, collagen 1 and 3 were detected not 
only typical fibres but also in cytoplasm of macrophages. In these 
regions accumulation of CD163+ macrophages was noted. In 
one case cirrhotic changes of the lung developed in previously 
healthy man in less than a year after first disease (finished clinical 
recovery) during the second episode.
Conclusion: Thus, many issues of lung fibrosis of clinical impor-
tance have to be additionally studied.

Evaluation of acquired resistance to sotorasib in patients with 
KRAS p.G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer: biomarker 
analysis using plasma from the CodeBreaK 100 trial
A. Addeo*, J. Wolf, B.T. Li, V. Velcheti, G.K. Dy, S.S. Ramal-
ingam, A. Hindoyan, A. Anderson, A. Ang, F. Skoulidis, J. Delord
*University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland
Background & objectives: The CodeBreaK 100 trial supported 
approval of sotorasib, a specific, irreversible KRASG12C inhibitor, 
for adults with KRAS p.G12C-mutated locally advanced or meta-
static non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with 
systemic therapy. We consider acquired resistance to sotorasib.
Methods: In the Phase 1/2 CodeBreaK 100 trial, patients with 
advanced KRAS p.G12C-mutated NSCLC received sotorasib mono-
therapy 960 mg once daily. The primary endpoint was objective 
response rate (ORR). An exploratory endpoint examined genomic 
alterations, absent at baseline but present at disease progression. 
Plasma samples collected at baseline and progression were ana-
lysed with the 23-gene Resolution Bioscience ctDx Lung™ assay.
Results: The ORR in 174 sotorasib-treated patients was 41%. 
Median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 
6.3 and 12.5 months, respectively (median 22.5-months follow-up). 
Of 67 patients with sequenced plasma samples, 19 (28%) exhibited 
at least one newly acquired genomic alteration; 7 (10%) had more 
than one mutation. Variants were detected across multiple genes 
and pathways. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) genes were the 
most prevalent putative mechanism of resistance, with alterations 
apparent in 16 (24%) patients, including 6 (9%) with EGFR gene 
mutations. PI3K/AKT/mTOR, secondary RAS, and ERK/MAPK 
mutations were evident in 3 (4%), 2 (3%), and 1 (1%) patient, 
respectively. Six (9%) patients had undetectable tumour shedding.
Conclusion: Genomic alterations observed in KRAS p.G12C-
mutated NSCLC patients treated with sotorasib suggest acquired 
resistance can arise via a range of mechanisms; however, new RTK 
alterations were frequently apparent at disease progression. This 
highlights a potential benefit of combining sotorasib with upstream 
inhibitors of RTK, such as SHP2 or EGFR inhibitors. Overall, pat-
terns of acquired resistance suggested by DNA analysis of plasma 
samples at baseline and disease progression support the develop-
ment of KRASG12C inhibitor combination therapies.

PD-L1 22C3 Lab Developed Test (LDT) for the Ventana’s 
BenchMark platform is clinically effective in NSCLC and can 
be used safely instead of the FDA approved DAKO platform: 
nation-wide experience and real-life validation (2016-2022)
T. Neuman*, G. Vainer
*Hadassah-Hebrew university medical centre, Jerusalem, Israel
Background & objectives: PD-L1 companion diagnostic by Dako 
(22C3 clone), for immunotherapy patient stratification, is a com-
mon requirement. Our group described a 22C3-based LDT for the 
Ventana platform, and showed its reliability and reproducibility 
(2016). However, real-time data about the reliability is lacking.
Methods: Ventana’s BenchMark immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
platform is widely used around the world. Between July 2016 and 
January 2022, 1444 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients 
were evaluated at the Hadassah Medical Center for PD-L1 by 
immunohistochemistry. All patients were evaluated by using the 
clone 22C3 Ventana’s BenchMark immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
platform as a Lab Developed Test (LDT).
Results: The overall PD-L1 tumour proportion score (TPS) of 
≥50%, 49-1%, and <1% of the keynote010 trial and our cohort is 
28.48%, 37.89%, 33.63%, and 28.39%, 33.85%, 37.80%, respec-
tively. Tumours with a PD-L1 TPS of ≥50% were not associated 
with patient gender, ethnicity, or biopsy type.
Conclusion: Our PD-L1 22C3 Lab Develpoed Test (LDT) for the 
Ventana’s BenchMark platform and the Keynote 010 display simi-
lar scoring distribution (strongly positive cases versus weakly or 
negative results) in NSCLC. Our cohort represent a nation-wide, 
real-time, heterogenic group, outside of clinical trial setup.
This support the notion that our PD-L1 LDT is clinically effective 
in NSCLC and can be used safely instead of the FDA approved 
DAKO platform for all of the indications based on the 22C3 clone.

Vehmas, T. Tormakangas, J. Rasanen, M. Myllarniemi
*Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, Helsinki, Finland
Background & objectives: Malignant pleural mesothelioma 
(MPM) is associated with a dismal prognosis and is strongly related 
to occupational asbestos exposure. Our aim was to survey retro-
spectively the asbestos fibre types and concentrations and their 
effect on the mortality of MPM patients.
Methods: We used a national dataset of MPM patients. For this 
study, we included patients where an evaluation of the pulmonary 
asbestos fibre and type had been made using electron microscopy 
at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH).
Results: A total of 590 patients were included. The median asbes-
tos concentration within dry lung tissue was 3.20 million fibres/
gram (range: 0 - 1700). The most prevalent asbestos fibre types 
detected in lung issue were crocidolite and anthophyllite, respec-
tively. In multivariable survival analyses, overall asbestos fibre 
concentration increased the Hazard ratio (HR) for mortality.

Interestingly if the survival time was under 7 months the HR 
decreased with asbestos fibre concentration. The age of these 
patients was high, and they were probably not involved in fol-
low up programs for the asbestos exposed possibly resulting in a 
delayed diagnosis. No effect of fibre type for the HR of mortality 
could be established.
Conclusion: We found that the total asbestos fibre concentration 
increased mortality over follow up time in general except for 
an initial phase. The most common fibre types were anthophyl-
lite and crocidolite, the usage of crocidolite has been relatively 
small. However crocidolite has been used for asbestos spray-
ing explaining its prevalence in the lungs. Anthophyllite was 
recognized to be the sole fibre sizable population of patients 
with isolated anthophyllite exposure supporting its role in the 
pathogenesis of MPM.
Funding: Several grants from the Helsinki University Hospital, the 
Finnish Cancer Foundation, the Finnish Work Environment Fund, 
and the Foundation of Finnish Anti-Tuberculosis Association have 
funded this study.

*Department of Pathology, Dokuz Eylül University Faculty of 
Medicine, Turkey
Background & objectives: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase and therapeutic target 
in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We compared the 
therapeutic efficiency of targeted therapy between ALK-pos-
itive cases near the threshold value (≥15%) and other ALK-
positive cases.
Methods: Our study included 73 patients with ALK-positive 
adenocarcinoma or NSCLC, 29 of whom were treated with ALK 
inhibitors and were followed up and treated at our centre. The 
percentage of ALK-positive tumour cells and the predominant sig-
nal pattern (break-apart or single red) were obtained from pathol-
ogy reports, and their relationship to prognosis was statistically 
evaluated.
Results: The median age was 64.4±0.8(41-91). 52 were 
male (71.2%). The percentage of ALK rearrangements was 
15-20% in 29, %15-25 in 47 cases. 51.4% of the cases 
died. There was no statistical significance between the 
percentage and signal pattern groups and prognosis. 
However, the single-red signal dominant group had a 
lower mortality rate than the break-apart dominant group 
(33.3%vs58.3%, p=0.056). The treatment response in the 
15-20% ALK-positivity group was lower than in the ≥21% 
group (%14.3vs%35.7, p=0.314).<gwofw> The treatment 
response in the single red dominant group was higher than 
the break apart dominant group (62.5%vs26.3%, p=0.09). 
15-25% group showed progression in 5.9 months, while the 
≥26% group showed in 8.3 months.</gwofw>
Conclusion: The mortality rate was lower and the treatment 
response rate was higher in the single red dominant group. Treat-
ment response was lower in the group with 15-20% compared to 
the ≥21%group. The time to progression was 2.4 months shorter in 
the group with 15-25% compared to the ≥26%group. In conclusion, 
"borderline ALK-positive tumours" and cases with predominant 
break apart signal may have a worse prognosis. Nonetheless, these 
findings must be validated by larger-scale research with a greater 
number of cases.

Pathologic assessment of resected stage III non-small cell lung 
cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy: identification of new 
prognostic factors

*University of Padova, Italy
Background & objectives: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery 
represent an ideal clinical setting to discover prognostic/predictive 
factors. The aim of the study was to identify clinical/pathological 
features useful for a better patient stratification.
Methods: Fifty-four stage III NSCLC patients were included 
between 2013 and 2021. Main clinical/laboratory data at the time 
of the diagnosis were recorded. All the morphological parame-
ters of the surgical samples were evaluated, including the tumour 
bed and the new WHO grading for adenocarcinomas. Computer-
assisted morphometrical quantification of fibrosis and inflamma-
tion extension was performed. Survival analyses were done by 
Kaplan-Meier curves.
Results: Longer disease-free survival (DFS) was found in patients 
with higher blood lymphocytes count (p=0.005) and higher fibrosis 
extension (p=0.05). Overall survival (OS) was related to gender 
(p=0.02), histotype (p=0.03) and pleural infiltration (p=0.05). 
When considering only adenocarcinomas, DFS was longer in 
patients with numerous blood lymphocytes (p=0.0006), lower 
WHO grades (p=0.01), lower proliferative index (p=0.01), less 
necrosis (p=0.004) and higher fibrosis extension (p=0.04). OS was 
related only to stage (p=0.02). A combined score that included 
lymphocytes, vascular infiltration, proliferative index, necrosis, 
fibrosis and inflammation, resulted more useful in stratifying 
patients for DFS(p=0.008). In adenocarcinomas the combined 
score seems to show a better performance when also WHO grading 
was included (p<0.0001).
Conclusion: Different morphological aspects resulted crucial 
for the patient prognostic stratification, especially for DFS. The 
precise computer-assisted quantification of stromal components 
can overcome observer bias and inaccuracy, and the combination 
of different parameters will result in a more effective prognostic 
stratification of the stage III NSCLC patients.

Asbestos body number in the lung of malignant pleural meso-
thelioma resected by extrapleural pneumonectomy
K. Okabe*, K. Hara, H. Miyamoto, N. Furukawa, T. Kimura
*Bell Land General Hospital, Japan
Background & objectives: Malignant pleural mesothelioma 
(MPM) is still dreadful disease, and has been recognized as related 
to asbestos inhalation. The aim of this study is to analyse the asbes-
tos body number in the lung of MPM patients who underwent 
extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP).
Methods: Sixty consecutive MPM patients who underwent EPP 
from 2006 to 2019 were reviewed. Asbestos body quantifica-
tion involved the digestion of 1-4 grams of lung tissue in bleach 
employing a modified Smith and Naylor method (Smith MJ, Nay-
lor B. Am J Clin Pathol 1972; 58:250-254). In addition, age, sex, 
affected side, MPM type, cause of asbestos exposure, and prognosis 
were investigated.
Results: The median age at EPP was 62 years old. 49 males and 
11 females were operated. Right side was 30, and left side was 
30. Epithelioid was 40, biphasic was 15, sarcomatoid was 2, and 
special variant was 3. 5-year survival and median survival of 30

epithelioid patients after 2011 were 36% and 58 months. Many 
patients had occupational asbestos exposure. 9 patients were judged 
as environmental asbestos exposure. The median asbestos body 
number in one gram of dried lung was 7,189. The asbestos body 
numbers in one gram of dried lung of 13 patients (22%) were less 
than 1,000, and those of 35 patients (58%) were more than 5,000.
Conclusion: Strong relationship between inhaled asbestos in the 
lung and MPM was re-confirmed. The representative occupations 
were construction worker, asbestos factory worker, plumber, and 
railroad car maker. Although the dried lung of MPM patients were 
investigated, the asbestos body numbers of 22% were less than 
1,000/g, and those of only 58% were more than 5,000/g.

Prevalence of TTF-1 negative lung adenocarcinoma on lung 
core biopsy with EGFR, ALK and PD-L1 status
S. Sayeda*, A. Naqvi, H. Begum, C. Finley, C. Coschi, R. Juergens, 
M. Bonert
*Pathology, McMaster University, Canada
Background & objectives: TTF-1 negative (TTF1neg) lung adeno-
carcinoma is relatively infrequent, typically CK7+ HepPar1+ and 
has SMARCA4 gene mutations. The objective was to retrospec-
tively examine biomarkers/immunohistochemical characteristics of 
local TTF1neg lung adenocarcinomas. Locally, the TTF-1 immu-
nostain clone in use is 8G7G3/1 (Dako).
Methods: All in-house lung core biopsies (LCBs) from Jan 2011-
Dec 2020 were retrieved and analysed using a hierarchical free text 
string matching algorithm (HFTSMA) to establish the diagnosis, 
and a logical text parsing tool (LTPT) to retrieve results for immu-
nostains, PD-L1, EGFR, and ALK status. A full review/audit was 
done by pathologists on cases selected by the HFTSMA and LTPT.
Results: Of 5,867 LCBs, 3,142 had immunostains (IHC) from 
4,973 patients. The HFTSMA classified 5,725 (98%) LCBs. 
LTPT identified 85% of LCBs based on TTF-1 status. TTF-1 
was done but not reported in 11%. 748 of 1,640 LCBs with 
adenocarcinoma were TTF-1 positive (TTF1+). 73 cases were 
TTF1neg, CK7+ and negative for non-lung markers. 50 of these 
73 were deemed primary lung, of which 0/29 were EGFR+ and 
0/28 were ALK+. PD-L1 was positive in 2/17 (11%), low posi-
tive 3/17 (18%) and negative in 12/17 (71%) cases. Only 1/28 
cases was positive for Napsin A. HepPar1 was done in only four 
cases; three matched the SMARCA4 deficient profile TTF1neg 
CK7+ HepPar1+.
Conclusion: Using the HFTSMA and LTPT, additional TTF1neg 
lung adenocarcinomas were identified, and these were uniformly 
negative for EGFR and ALK. In the cohort, 6% (50/ (748+50)) are 
TTF1neg lung adenocarcinomas. PD-L1 appears to be frequently 
negative compared to TTF1+ adenocarcinomas. IHC reporting is 
uneven in our environment. The possible utility of HepPar1 positiv-
ity in identifying TTF1neg LCBs appears to be underutilized in our 
environment. Napsin A negativity appears to be a common finding 
in TTF1neg lung adenocarcinomas.

Histologic features, nuclear grading, BAP1 and PD-L1 expres-
sion in malignant pleural mesothelioma: analysis of a mono-
institutional series
H.G. Terzioglu*, S. Onder
*Hacettepe University, Turkey
Background & objectives: The most common primary malignant 
tumour of the pleura is malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) 
which has a poor outcome. This study aims to identify any relation 
between histological features, nuclear grading, and expression sta-
tus of BAP1 and PD-L1 in MPM.
Methods: 52 tumour samples diagnosed as MPM between 2001-
2022 were re-evaluated and nuclear grading was performed. 
Whole sections were analysed for BAP1 and PD-L1 (73-10 clone) 
expression by using IHC assays. Presence or absence of the 
nuclear expression of BAP1 was noted. Any pattern of staining 
was accepted in PD-L1 the 73-10 clone, and cut-offs were set as 
≥1%, ≥50%, ≥80%.
Results: Male/female ratio was 27:25 and age range was 33-83 
(mean:60). Forty-nine cases were epithelioid and 3 were biphasic. 
Among epithelioid MPMs, 37/49 were low grade(LG). BAP1 
expression was lost in 69%(67% of epithelioid, 100% of biphasic) 
of cases. There was no statistically significant correlation between 
BAP1 loss and nuclear grade or overall tumour grade. PD-L1 was 
negative in 43%(95% epithelioid, 84% LG, 65% BAP1-lost); ≥1% 
positive in 40%(95% epithelioid, 74% LG, 65% BAP1-lost); ≥50% 
positive in 11%(75% epithelioid,33% LG, 100% BAP1 lost) and 
≥80% positive in 6%(100% epithelioid, 67% LG, 67% BAP1-lost) 
of the cases. Rhabdoid features were seen in 5/49 cases all of which 
were BAP1-lost, and PD-L1 positive.
Conclusion: MPM is an aggressive tumour. BAP1 is the most 
common somatic mutation, and its loss of expression remains to be 
common regardless of tumour grade or PD-L1 status. In epithelioid 
MPMs, expression of PD-L1 seems to be associated with certain 
histologic features such as rhabdoid morphology, but not with 
tumour grade or BAP1 expression. Immune checkpoint inhibitors 
were shown to be effective for some aggressive tumour types, and 
it may be promising for a subset of MPM patients as well.

Evaluation of predictive markers for the patterns of metastatic 
disease in patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma

von der Thüsen
*Department of Pathology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, 
The Netherlands
Background & objectives: The majority of patients diagnosed 
with pulmonary adenocarcinoma present at an advanced stage of 
the disease or will develop metastases during follow-up. Find-
ing predictive biomarkers for the development of metastatic dis-
ease during diagnostic workup is important to guide therapeutic 
strategies.
Methods: Histologic growth pattern and a diagnostic genetic panel 
customized for lung cancer alterations, were evaluated in biopsy 
and resection specimens of 319 patients presenting with metasta-
ses from pulmonary adenocarcinoma. A subset of patients with 
early-stage lung adenocarcinoma who developed metastasis during 
follow up was compared to a group who did not develop metastatic 
disease.
Results: Primary lung tumours presenting with a dominant solid 
growth pattern and absence of driver mutations correlate with brain 
metastasis and are found predominantly in early brain metastasis. 
EGFR mutations are found in early metastasis of brain and non-
brain origin irrespectively of the growth pattern. MET mutations 
were seen in early non-brain metastasis. We observed a major 
change of the dominant growth pattern between the primary lung 
tumour and the corresponding metastasis. Both, early and late brain 
metastasis show more often a papillary dominant growth pattern 
whereas the acinar dominant pattern is found in early brain and 
non-brain metastasis.
Conclusion: Routine histopathology and genetic biomarkers of pri-
mary pulmonary adenocarcinoma specimens predict to some extent 
the development of metastasis. These parameters are by themselves

insufficiently specific to reliably predict metastatic behaviour. This 
is, however, a first step towards the development of a predictive 
algorithm on which therapeutic strategies can be based. We are cur-
rently investigating additional parameters such as tumour microen-
vironment as well as additional histological and clinical parameters 
to improve the specificity of our predictive model.

Expression of phagocytosis markers and phagocytosis inhibi-
tors in Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP)
M. Neururer*, L. Brcic, S. Eidenhammer, H. Popper
*Medizinische Universität Graz, Austria
Background & objectives: Fibrosis in UIP is facilitated 
by senescence cells, which secrete inflammatory cytokines. 
Phagocytosis counteracts the inflammation by removing cellular 
debris. We want to identify cells expressing phagocytosis-
associated molecules and cells protecting themselves by expressing 
CD47 within the peripheral lung.
Methods: We performed immunohistochemistry on 44 cases 
of UIP with different aetiology using antibodies against 
LAMP1, Rab7, TRAP (all phagocytosis-associated), and CD47 
(phagocytosis-protecting).
Results: Phagocytosis-associated molecules were expressed in all 
macrophages, but also by a considerable proportion of regenerating 
cells within the remodelled areas. Myofibroblasts, endothelia, 
and bronchial/bronchiolar epithelial cells were all negative. 
Expression of LAMP1 and Rab7 were sometimes focally seen in 
type II pneumocytes within normally structured lung. CD47 was 
expressed by macrophages, but also by few regenerating epithelial 
cells within the remodelled peripheral lung, much less compared 
to the expression of phagocytosis markers. As we suspected these 
to be senescent cells, we performed double immunohistochemical 
staining for p16 (senescence marker) and CD47.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that senescence cells have prob-
ably activated a mechanism, protecting them from being attacked 
and phagocytosed by leukocytes. Thus, they maintain inflammation 
and proliferation of myofibroblasts.

Large-scale human tissue analysis identifies Uroplakin 3B as a 
useful diagnostic marker for mesothelioma and normal meso-
thelial cells

T.S. Clauditz, F. Büscheck, A. Marx, F. Jacobsen*
*University Medical Center Hamburg, Germany
Background & objectives: Uroplakin 3B (Upk3b) stabilizes the 
urothelial cell layer lining the bladder. Based on RNA expression 
studies Upk3b is expressed in a only limited number of normal tis-
sues and tumour entities. This study assessed the diagnostic utility 
of Upk3b immunohistochemistry.
Methods: A set of tissue microarrays containing 8071 sam-
ples from 125 different tumour types and subtypes and 608 
samples of 76 different normal tissue types was analysed by 
immunohistochemistry.
Results: Normal cell expression of Upk3b was largely limited to 
mesothelial cells, umbrella cells of the urothelium, and amnion 
cells. Upk3b was detectable in 13 (10,4%) of 125 tumour entities. 
The rate of Upk3b positivity was highest in malignant epitheloid 
mesotheliomas (81,5%), followed by various categories of urothe-
lial tumours (14,6-45,7%) including Brenner tumours of the ovary 
(10,8%), four further subtypes of ovarian cancers (1,1-10,4%) and 
adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater (2,7%). Within urothelial 
tumours, Upk3b positivity decreased from 45,7% in pTaG2 (low 
grade) to 34,2% in pTaG3 (high grade), and 14,6% in pT2-4 cancers 
(p<0,0001). Within pT2-4 cancers, Upk3b staining was unrelated 
to pT, pN, and patient prognosis.
Conclusion: Upk3b immunohistochemistry is a useful diagnos-
tic tool for the distinction of mesotheliomas from other thoracic 
tumours and the visualization of normal mesothelial and umbrella 
cells.

The relationship of VSIR(VISTA) and PD-L1 expressions with 
histologicalsubtypes in mesothelioma
M. Dicleli*
*Dicle University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical 
Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Mesothelioma is a tumour with low 
response to treatment and poor prognosis. This has led to the 
search for new treatment methods such as antibodies that block 
immunocontrol points. We evaluated the immune checkpoint 
markers PD-L1 and VISTA in mesotheliomas.
Methods: VISTA and PD-L1 expression analysed in 45 
epithelioid,10 sarcomatoid, 9 biphasic mesotheliomas 3 well-
differentiated mesothelial tumours (WDPMT) and 2 atypical 
mesothelial proliferation cases (AMP). Positive staining for VISTA 
in tumour cells was defined as the presence of any cytoplasmic 
and/or membranous staining, and for PD-L1, the presence of any 
membranous staining.
Results: Positive VISTA staining was seen %91 of cases, more 
frequently in epithelioid (%98) and biphasic (89%) compared 
to sarcomatoid (60%) mesotheliomas. Benign mesothelium, 
WDPMT, AMP, testicular and peritoneal mesotheliomas were 
all positive with VISTA. PD-L1 was expressed more frequently in 
sarcomatoid (80%) mesotheliomas compared to epithelioid (29%) 
and biphasic (33%) mesotheliomas. All PD-L1 positive cases 
were pleural mesothelioma except 2 epithelioid peritoneal meso-
thelioma. While 1/23 low-grade and 10/17 high-grade pleural 
epithelioid mesotheliomas were positive with PD-L1. A signifi-
cant correlation was found between VISTA(p=0.00) expression 
with epithelioid mesotheliomas, while PD-L1 expression with 
sarcomatoid (p=0.01) and high-grade epithelioid mesotheliomas 
(p=0.00). An inverse negative relationship between VISTA and 
PD-L1 scores was observed.
Conclusion: VISTA expression was observed more frequently 
in sarcomatoid mesotheliomas compared to epithelioid meso-
theliomas, while PD-L1 expression was mostly observed in 
sarcomatoid mesothelioma. It is known in the literature that 
PD-L1 expression is associated with a bad prognosis and VISTA 
expression is associated with a good prognosis. We also observed 
higher PD-L1 expression in high-grade epithelioid mesothelioma 
than in low-grade. We wanted to emphasize the importance of 
the expression of immuc check point inhibitors in mesothelioma 
subtypes in target-directed drug selection.

Background & objectives: Melanoma accounts for the vast 
majority of death related to skin cancer. Its incidence increased 
during the last few decades. The underlying pathogenetic mecha-
nisms have to be further elucidated, but several oncogenic muta-
tion have been reported to be involved.
Methods: This is a retrospective study on 220 melanoma samples 
(primary or metastatic) from equal patient number. A NGS-DNA 
Oncomine Focus Assay was performed in all cases. The results 
are correlated with different clinico-pathological parameters, 
among which metastatic status and response to therapy. We pre-
sent the preliminary results on 114 patients; the study is ongoing. 
The final results follow upon presentation.
Results: The median age at the time of diagnosis was 62,3 years. 
Less than half of the patients underwent a sentinel node (SN) 
procedure and 60,87% of the SNs showed metastatic deposits. 
Distant metastasis was seen in 46,5% of the cases. The metastatic 
locations ranged from one up to six. Among the mutations, BRAF 
and NRAS comprised the majority. Patients with a BRAF but 
no TERTp mutation had more metastatic locations than those 
with both a BRAF and TERTp mutation (p=0.044). However, 
the latter had higher rates of brain metastasis than those with 
BRAF but no TERTp(p=0.037). Patients with NRAS and TERTp 
mutations displayed a higher Breslow thickness than NRAS 
alone(p=0.045).
Conclusion: We present the preliminary results of our retro-
spective study on 114 melanoma samples. We correlated their 
molecular status with different clinico-pathological parameters. 
BRAF mutated melanomas seem to can give rise to multifocal 
metastatic disease, even in the absence of TERTp mutation. How-
ever, TERTp mutations are responsible for the more aggressive, 
brain metastasis. TERTp in combination with NRAS mutation 
correlates with higher Breslow thickness of the primary tumours. 
The study is ongoing and final results are about to be completed.

The utility of PRAME in the diagnostic approach of cutane-
ous melanocytic lesions

Siozopoulou*
*Department of Pathology, Antwerp University Hospital, Ede-
gem, Belgium
Background & objectives: The PReferentially expressed Anti-
gen in Melanoma(PRAME) has been extensively researched for 
its expression in cutaneous melanomas. Yet, little is known about 
its expression in non-malignant melanocytic lesions. Here we 
investigate PRAME expression in a large series of cutaneous 
melanocytic lesions.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study on the immunohisto-
chemical expression of PRAME in 296 melanocytic lesions. These 
were classified according to a modified MAPTH-Dx classification 
in group 1:benign, group 2:moderate atypical, group 3:severe atypi-
cal and group 4:malignant. PRAME expression was analysed based 
on the percentage of cells with expression (< 1%, 1-25%, 26-50%, 
51-75%, 76-100%) and on intensity (none/light, moderate, intense).
Results: PRAME percentage of 76-100% was seen in 2%, 4%, 11 % 
and 52% for groups 1 to 4 respectively (p<0.05). Strong intensity 
was seen in 10%, 9%, 27% and 62% for groups 1 to 4 respectively 
(p<0.05). The AUC for percentage of PRAME expression in dis-
criminating between groups 1 and 4 was 85.09%, between groups 
2 and 4 84.90% and between groups 3 and 4 74.61%. The AUC was 
64.07% for discrimination between groups 2 and 3, 51.02% between 
groups 1 and 2 and 63.57% between groups 1 and 3. Comparison 
of the AUC for percentage, intensity and their combination had no 
significant difference (p>0.05 in all cases).
Conclusion: These results suggest that immunohistochemical 
analysis for PRAME expression is a useful adjunct for distinguish 
melanoma from non-malignant cutaneous melanocytic lesions. In 
the non-malignant category it may play a role in discriminating 
moderate from severe atypia. The significance of these findings 
need to be further determined in a larger cohort including the fol-
low up clinical data.

lesions: a single institutional experience

rano, L. Resta
*University of Bari "Aldo Moro", Italy
Background & objectives: In recent years PReferentially 
expressed Antigen in MElanoma (PRAME) has been used in the 
histopathological diagnosis of melanocytic lesions. We performed 
a single-centre study to evaluate the data on the usefulness of 
PRAME could also be confirmed by our group.
Methods: From 1 December 2021 to 29/03/2022 we collected 
275 cases of melanocytic lesions that were immunostained with 
PRAME. We categorized PRAME tumour cells percentage positiv-
ity and intensity of immunostaining in a cumulative score obtained 
by adding the quartile of positive tumour cells (0,1 +, 2 +, 3 +, 4 
+) to PRAME expression intensity in tumour cells.
Results: Of these 275 lesions, 136 were benign, 12 were of uncer-
tain potential for malignancy, and 127 were malignant. The immu-
noexpression of PRAME was totally negative in 125/136 benign 
lesions with only a few positive melanocytes, with intensity 1+ 
in the remaining 11 cases (8.1%). Of the 127 cases of melanoma, 
PRAME was strongly positive in 104/127 cases with intensity 4+ 
and 3+. In 17 cases PRAME was positive in percentage 2+ and 
with intensity ranging from 2+ to 3+. In 6 cases of desmoplastic 
melanoma, PRAME was 1+ positive or completely negative. Of 
the 12 cases of spitzoid lesions, PRAME was much more hetero-
geneous and irregularly distributed throughout the lesion.
Conclusion: These data are perfectly in agreement with the current 
literature, they demonstrate that the reliability of PRAME is quite 
high, but its use cannot disregard the morphological information 
and the execution of other ancillary immunohistochemical stains 
such as Melan-A, HMB-45, MiTF and SOX-10.

Turkey
Background & objectives: Amyloidosis comprehends a group of 
diseases characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibres within 
tissues and organs. Skin biopsy is a simple and safe procedure with 
a high yield and might be used to support the diagnosis of systemic 
amyloidosis.
Methods: We analysed 59 skin biopsies from 47 patients with sys-
temic amyloidosis (SA) (26 males, 21 females), including 18 amy-
loid light chain (AL); 19 serum amyloid A (AA), and 10 non-AL/
non-AA amyloid types. We evaluated the distribution of amyloid 
deposits within the tissue.
Results: For each group of systemic amyloidosis, AL, AA, and 
non-AL/non-AA type, secondary cutaneous amyloidosis was con-
firmed in 15 (83,3%), 6 (31,5%), and 6 (60%) cases respectively.

Amyloid deposits within the skin biopsies in AL type were in the 
papillary dermis, interstitial infiltration, and hair follicle shaft 
involvement. In AA-type skin biopsies showed amyloid infiltration 
at the sweat glands and hair follicle shaft involvement. In non-AL/ 
Non-AA type the amyloid deposits described an interstitial infiltra-
tion and deep small blood vessel wall deposition. In a subgroup of 
biopsies(N=13), C4d staining was evaluated for identifying amy-
loid deposition being positive in 84,6%(n=11) of cases.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of SA sampling abdominal fat tissue 
has variable rates of sensitivity. Skin biopsy is a simple proce-
dure providing valuable findings for amyloidosis. Descriptions of 
skin involvement and histopathological findings in SA are scant 
noticing skin compromise in 40% of cases. We detected amyloid 
deposits at different layers and components of the skin, increasing 
the probability of detection of SA, supporting this procedure as a 
diagnostic tool, especially for AL-type amyloidosis where positive 
findings are frequently detected allowing an early diagnosis for 
this condition.

Rare histopathological findings in erythema migrans: a 5 year 
retrospective study from Freiburg Dermatopathology Unit and 
review of the literature

W. Weyers
*Pathology Unit, Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Centro 
Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Erythema migrans represents the 
skin lesion of early manifestation of Lyme disease typically as 
an erythematous, circular, annular plaque with central clearing, 
generally greater than 5cm. Some cases can be defiant, leading 
to a histopathological evaluation, occasionally with uncommon 
findings.
Methods: We describe 88 cases with PCR test positivity for Bor-
relia burgdorferi and diagnosis of erythema migrans with rare his-
topathological findings diagnosed from 2016 to 2021. Our series 
had a female predilection, representing 71% of total patients and an 
age distribution between 21 and 82 years old. There was correlation 
with the clinical information in 59% of the cases.
Results: Erythema migrans is characteristically described as 
a superficial and deep perivascular inflammatory infiltrate, 
predominantly composed by lymphocytes with occasional 
plasma cells and eosinophils. Besides these features, our 
study presents cases with rare findings. There were inter-
face changes like vacuolar and lichenoid infiltrate in 29% of 
the cases. Granulomatous features were present in 50,6% of 
this casuistic, with granuloma formation and a predominantly 
interstitial histiocytic infiltrate. There was also observed a 
pseudolymphomatous pattern with superficial, deep and 
severe lymphocytic infiltrate in 17% of the cases. And 3,4% 
of these patients presented with histopathological findings 
similar to mycosis fungoides with epidermotropism and papil-
lary dermal fibroplasia.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of erythema migrans is usually clin-
ical and serologic testing is not recommended due to low sen-
sitivity; but some difficult clinical cases benefit from a biopsy 
evaluation. However, the findings can be too subtle and unu-
sual, suggesting other entities like granuloma annulare, lupus 
erythematosus, drug eruptions, and mycosis fungoides, all of 
which require a distinct therapeutic approach. Although those 
differential diagnosis can often be excluded with additional 
histopathologic findings, close clinicopathologic correlation 
is necessary for a definite diagnosis.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus: a 5-year casuistic study from 
a Portuguese dermatopathology department
C. Faria*, A. Alves, C. Courelas, O. Tellechea, J.C. Cardoso
*Pathology Unit, Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Centro 
Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (LE) 
occurs in the context of systemic LE or restricted to the skin, and 
it can be subclassified into acute, subacute or chronic. While there 
are differences between them, some histopathological hallmarks 
are present in most subtypes.
Methods: Retrospective study of 54 patients with histopathological 
diagnosis of cutaneous lupus erythematosus from 2016 to 2021. 
There was a female predilection representing 70,4% and our study 
had a broad age distribution, the youngest case with 8 years-old 
and the oldest one with 88 years-old, with almost 6% of cases being 
diagnosed at the paediatric age.
Results: Cutaneous lupus erythematosus diagnosed in the setting 
of systemic lupus erythematosus represents 13% of the patients 
while the cases limited to the skin represent 87%. Subacute cutane-
ous lupus erythematosus accounts for 23,4% and chronic cutaneous 
LE 76,6%. No cases of acute lupus erythematosus were described.
In our study, discoid LE (DLE) is the most common subtype of 
chronic cutaneous LE (69,4%), followed by tumid LE (19,4%). 
Bullous LE represents 5,6%, while hypertrophic / verrucous LE 
and lupus panniculitis account for 2,8% each.
Four cases (8,4%) were diagnosed in the context of scarring 
lymphocytic alopecia.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of cutaneous LE requires clinical 
and histopathological correlation. However, the overlap with 
other connective tissue diseases warrants integration of serologic 
findings, as a systemic autoimmune disorder may be considered in 
the differential diagnosis.
Our study also reveals that the majority of cases were responsive 
to treatment, presenting only hyperpigmented residual lesions. 
Nevertheless, 11% had persistent lesions, especially patients with 
other associated autoimmune diseases like Sjogren syndrome, 
psoriasis and alopecia, or in the context of HIV infection.

*Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences and Advanced 
Technologies "G.F. Ingrassia", Anatomic Pathology, University of 
Catania, Italy
Background & objectives: Line-field confocal optical coher-
ence tomography (LC-OCT) is a new, non-invasive technique 
that provides in-vivo, high-resolution images in both vertical and 
horizontal sections. Our study evaluated LC-OCT imaging in some 
inflammatory disorders and to correlate the resulting features with 
histopathology.
Methods: The retrospective study included patients with his-
topathological confirmed diagnosis of plaque psoriasis, atopic 
eczema and lichen planus, who were imaged with LC-OCT before 
the biopsy. LC-OCT was performed with the commercially avail-
able LC-OCT device.
Results: A total of 15 adult patients with histopathologically 
proven plaque psoriasis (N: 5), atopic eczema (N: 5), and lichen 
planus (N: 5) were included. In all cases, LC-OCT allowed the 
in-vivo recognition of the main microscopic features of the exam-
ined inflammatory skin disease, with a strong correlation with 
histopathology.

Conclusion: Although future studies on larger series of patients 
are necessary, LC-OCT, based on these preliminary findings, may 
represent a promising tool in inflammatory skin disorders with 
potential applications including enhanced diagnosis, biopsy guid-
ance, follow-up and treatment monitoring.

The challenging differential diagnosis of ALK-positive cutane-
ous lesions, a case series
L. Keulen*, J. Liu, K. Dewinne, P. Pauwels, V. Siozopoulou
*Department of Pathology, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, 
Belgium
Background & objectives: ALK-positive cutaneous lesions com-
prise epithelioid fibrous histiocytoma (eFH), ALK-positive non-
Langerhans cell histiocytosis (non-LCH) and Spitz lesions. These 
are rare entities, sometimes with overlapping histologic features, 
hence their differential diagnosis can be challenging.
Methods: We collected a series of 14 patients with ALK-positivity 
on immunohistochemistry (IHC). Two case were diagnosed as non-
LCH, 4 as eFH and 8 as Spitz lesions. IHC with the same ALK 
clone (5A4) was implemented in all cases. A NGS-RNA Oncomine 
Focus Assay was performed in the 6 non-Spitz lesions. We com-
pared the morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular 
findings.
Results: The median age for the non-LCH was 16,5 years(all 
females), for the eFH 40 years(females=males) and for the Spitz 
lesions 20 years(75% females).
The entities shared common morphologic features: circumscribed 
or ill-defined lesion, spindle or epithelioid cell morphology, 
fascicular, storiform or nodular growth pattern.
On IHC, all tumours demonstrated diffuse and strong ALK 
expression. The histiocytic tumours were at least partially positive 
for CD68. S100 was focally expressed in some eFH, whereas SOX 
10 and/or melan-A were confined to the Spitz lesions. No other 
IHC stainings aided in the differential diagnosis.
Molecular analysis in the non-Spitz lesions showed a SQSTM-ALK 
fusion in 2 eFHs and a KIF5B-ALK in a non-LCH.
Conclusion: We present a series of ALK-positive non-LCH, eFH 
and Spitz lesions. These three entities show overlapping mor-
phological features. However, Spitz lesions are characterized by 
SOX10 and/or Melan-A positivity, which is not seen in eFHs and 
non-LCH. Still, for the histiocytic entities, IHC is not able to nar-
row down the differential diagnosis. Additional molecular testing 
may help, since specific ALK fusion partners have been demon-
strated in certain entities.

Melanoma in situ with regression
O. Gokoz, D. Ateş Özdemir, H.G. Terzioglu*
*Hacettepe University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Regression in melanoma in situ (MIS) 
has been reported but not well studied. Defining the clinical and 
histopathological features of cases with regression can help work-
up of patients and be a step to determine the value of regression 
in prognosis.
Methods: Ffifty-six cases with a diagnosis of MIS in 2014-2022 
were retrieved from the archives and retrospectively examined for 
the type of MIS, presence of melanophages, fibrosis, vascular pro-
liferation and/or vertically arranged vessels, presence and degree of 
inflammation, elastosis, presence of folliculotropism, immunohis-
tochemical stainings and surgical margins. Demographic features, 
clinical history and follow-up findings were recorded.
Results: There were 40 patients with regression, 19 males and 21 
females with an average age of 61.8 and 51.3 respectively. Head 
and neck were the most frequent localization (45%). The mostly 
seen MIS type was lentigo maligna (62.5%), MIS developing on 
dysplastic nevus being the second (20%). Melanophages together 
with inflammation were present in 71.4% of cases. Folliculotropism 
was seen in 55%, vascular proliferation in 42.5%, and fibrosis in 
25% of cases. Immunohistochemistry with melan A and/or HMB45 
was studied for the detection of dermal invasion in 40%. Sentinel 
lymph node sampling was done in 2 patients with negative results. 
Invasive melanoma was detected in 22.5% of patients.
Conclusion: Evaluation of regression in different types of MIS is 
valuable in the sense that upstaging can be conceivable in some 
clinical settings since it can be a sign of invasive melanoma. Step 
sectioning and immunohistochemical studies are important tools to 
detect invasion. Folliculotropism and vascular proliferation along 
with inflammation and melanophagocytosis are frequently seen in 
cases with regression. Regression in a dysplastic nevus is a known 
phenomenon and the severity of structural and cytologic atypia 
derive the diagnosis of MIS.

Progressive disease in sentinel-negative melanoma patients: 
biological differences and importance of sentinel lymph node 
biopsy

M. Wanner, M. Huellner, R. Barnhill, C. Lugassy, N. Lindenblatt, 
D. Mihic-Probst
*University Hospital of Zurich, Switzerland
Background & objectives: Among the most important prognostic 
factors in melanoma is the sentinel lymph node (SLN) status.
Methods: Using our electronic database we identified 109 of 
890 SLN-negative patients with progressive disease (PD). These 
patients were characterized for melanoma type, molecular type, 
sequence and extent of metastatic spread.
Results: A total of 61 of 109 SLN-negative patients had PD in 
the SLN-basin indicating false-negative SLN (group-1). 48 of 109 
patients had PD at distant sites and were therefore impossible to be 
identified using SLN biopsy (group-2). Despite distant spread these 
patients had significantly more single organ metastasis (p<0.001) 
and significantly longer disease-free-survival (p=0.001) compared 
to group-1. Additionally, to significant differences on a molecular 
basis between the two groups (p=0.01), all lentigo maligna and 
spindle-cell-melanomas belonged to group-2 and all, except one 
lentigo maligna melanoma, had single visceral metastasis.
Conclusion: Two different biological groups among SLN-negative 
patients with PD were demonstrated. Extravascular-migratory-
metastasis, rather than hematogenous spread, might be responsible 
for the observed PD with single organ involvement.

*University of Pisa, Italy
Background & objectives: PRAME is a melanoma-associated 
antigen whose expression is well documented in cutaneous and 
ocular melanoma. Our study aimed to investigate the expression 
of PRAME in a series of low- and high-grade dysplastic nevi in 
which little is still known.
Methods: Immunohistochemistry for PRAME was carried out on 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples applying the specific

antibody (clone EPR20330, Rabbit Monoclonal, Abcam) on auto-
mated system (Ventana Benchmark Ultra), according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Samples were scored blindly according to 
both the percentage of positive cells and the intensity of expression 
(H-score). The study was approved by the local Ethical Committee.
Results: The study included a total of 250 melanocytic tumours 
of which: 50 high grade and 50 low grade dysplastic nevi; 
50 nevi with architectural disorder and minimal cytological 
atypia; 50 melanomas and 50 common nevi as controls. The 
histopathological diagnosis was reviewed collegially by four expert 
dermatopathologists according to the 2018 WHO classification of 
skin tumours. Written consent was obtained from each participant. 
Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA analysis and 
Kruskal-Wallis test. As expected, PRAME immunoreactivity 
was markedly different between melanomas (diffuse and strong 
staining) and common nevi (weak and focal). Instead, among 
dysplastic nevi PRAME protein displayed different staining 
patterns in the epidermal and dermal portions.
Conclusion: This work represents the first large study on PRAME 
expression in dysplastic nevi in a real-world setting. Our results 
suggest that immunohistochemical analysis for PRAME expression 
may aid in the differential diagnosis between low grade and high 
grade dysplastic nevi as well as between high grade dysplastic 
nevus and melanoma, in addition to and as a complement to the 
WHO morphological criteria used in routine practice.

Somatostatin receptor type 2a (SSTR2a) immunohistochemical 
expression pattern in Merkel cell carcinoma- a pilot study
A. Sykaras*, C. Vourlakou, C. Kouvidou
*Department of Pathology, Evangelismos General Hospital, Ath-
ens, Greece
Background & objectives: Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) is 
an aggressive, high-grade cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma. 
Recent data suggest that MCC patients may benefit from therapies 
targeting somatostatin receptors. Our aim was to evaluate the 
expression pattern of somatostatin receptor type 2a (SSTR2a) in 
MCC.
Methods: SSTR2a immunohistochemistry was performed in ten 
MCC specimens (five primary and five metastatic to lymph nodes). 
SSTR2a expression was evaluated by using a scoring system pro-
posed from Volante and colleagues. Specifically, score 0 describes 
no staining and score 1+ cytoplasmic staining whereas membrane 
expression corresponds to score 2+ (staining in <50% of tumour 
cells) or score 3+ (>50% of cells).
Results: All primary MCC were SSTR2a positive with membrane 
staining in 4/5 cases and focal cytoplasmic staining (score 1+) in 
one case. Membrane SSTR2a staining was scored as 2+ in two 
cases and 3+ in the other two. Score 2+ cases displayed heteroge-
neous-focal membrane staining of moderate intensity with partial 
or circumferential pattern whereas score 3+ cases were character-
ized by a circumferential, strong and diffuse membrane expression 
of SSTR2a. In contrast with primary MCC, 3/5 metastatic MCC 
were SSTR2a negative (score 0) with endothelial and follicular 
dendritic cells serving as internal positive controls. The other two 
metastatic MCC displayed focal cytoplasmic SSTR2a staining 
(score 1+) of weak to moderate intensity.
Conclusion: SSTR2a is expressed in 6/10 MCC cases, with mem-
brane staining that is considered as clinically important in 4/10. 
Although preliminary, our data are in agreement with the few imag-
ing and immunohistochemical studies that previously assessed 
the SSTR2a expression in MCC. Given that SSTR2a is typically 
expressed in well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), 
the positive SSTR2a staining in MCC is a surprising finding. 
SSTR2a may represent a potential target for imaging and therapies 
with somatostatin analogues, in a similar fashion with NETs.

Digital pathology approach for prognostisation of 
neuroblastoma
N. Tari, T. Werber, T. Micsik*
*Semmelweis University, Hungary
Background & objectives: Neuroblastoma (NB) diagnosis 
needs precise percentages of differentiating/proliferating cells 
and mitosis-karyorrhexis index (MKI), which are hard to assess 
manually and objectively. Our aim was to test the benefit of using 
digital pathological evaluation to harbour these features, especially 
for prognostisation.
Methods: Our retrospective study was performed on 41 NB-cases 
from Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary. Hematoxylin-
Eosin and Ki-67 immunostained slides were digitalized by Panno-
ramic 1000 Scanner (3DHistech, Budapest, Hungary). MKI, tumour 
differentiation, Ki-67 proliferation index were digitally calculated 
with Quant Center algorithms of the same vendor. Statistical cor-
relations, ROC analysis, t-tests and graphic visualisation were per-
formed with Microsoft Excel and XLSTAT programs.
Results: Our pilot study incorporated 5 undifferentiated, 28 
poorly differentiated and 7 differentiating NBs. Average age 
at diagnosis was 25,54±38,39 months, with slightly more 
males (23:18). 5-year overall survival was 80%, disease-free 
survival was 65%. Manual and digital MKI values corre-
lated well (r=0,78, p<0,05) and delivered prognostic value. 
Manual and digital Ki-67 values correlated well (r1=0,63, 
r2=0,56, r3=0,91, p1,2,3<0,05), and proved to be prognostic 
in different aspects. Tumour cells’ biometric data visualisa-
tion by violin-plots showed differences among differentiation 
classes, offering promising ways for digital classification. 
Combining the various digitally assessed features into the 
Neuroblastoma Digital Pathology Index we reached a clas-
sification accuracy of 94% in non-high-risk and 88% in high-
risk NB-patients.
Conclusion: Our epidemiological findings were similar to lit-
erature data. Digital MKI counting is accessible and delivers 
prognostic data. Ki-67 proliferation index’s own prognostic value 
falls behind some classic prognostic factors such as MKI, though 
it adds valuable tools for NB prognostisation through complex 
formulas, especially by automatic digital evaluation on hot-spots 
or whole slides. Our Neuroblastoma Digital Pathology Index’s 
classification accuracy is promising, just like the visual repre-
sentation of tumour cells with violin-plots which might show 
differentiation related distribution patterns.

correlation with the pregnancy status
J. Pacheco*, F. Rosa, E. Dvindenko, R. Barros, A. Costa Braga
*Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João, Portugal
Background & objectives: Wilms’ tumour 1 gene (WT1) is 
reported to be overexpressed in decidual cells during preg-
nancy, however, case series are lacking. Our aim is to evaluate 
WT1 expression in eutopic and ectopic decidua and correlate 
it with pregnancy status.

1 3
Methods: We evaluated 99 cases (94 tissue microarrays) of decid-
ual tissue (72 eutopic; 27 ectopic). WT1 nuclear immunoexpression 
was independently evaluated by four pathologists. Percentage and 
intensity of positive cells were estimated using a semi-automated 
open-source software. A staining score was obtained by multiply-
ing the percentage and intensity of positive cells. Clinical data was 
reviewed and the results were statistically analysed.
Results: We evaluated 99 cases of decidual tissue in total, 36,4% 
associated with pregnancy (23 eutopic; 13 ectopic) and 63,6% 
non-pregnancy associated (49 eutopic; 14 ectopic). Nuclear 
expression of WT1 was observed in 93,9% cases (97,2% in preg-
nant women; 92,1% in non-pregnant women), with no statistical 
differences (p=0,550). The percentage and nuclear intensity of 
cells were higher in non-pregnancy related decidua, mainly in 
eutopic location (p<0,001 and p=0,003, respectively). Accord-
ingly, the WT1 score was also higher in non-pregnancy related 
eutopic decidua [moderate (14,3%); strong (77,6%); p=0.034]. 
The WT1 percentage of positive decidual cells was associated, 
independently of the pregnancy status, with the eutopic location 
(p=0,024).
Conclusion: In our study of a case series we did not verify a 
higher imunoexpression of WT1 associated with pregnancy status. 
We verify a higher percentage of WT1-positive decidual cells in 
eutopic tissues, especially in non-pregnancy related cases.

Chronic histiocytic intervillositis and related clinical findings: 
a multicentric, retrospective analyses of 34 cases in a 17 year 
period
M. de Brito Pereira*, S. Carralas Antunes, E. Vitorino, R. 
Ilgenfritz, J. Tavares
*Pathology Department, Hospital CUF Descobertas, Lisbon, 
Portugal
Background & objectives: Chronic histiocytic intervillositis 
(CHI) of unknown aetiology is a rare placental disorder defined by 
the presence of an histiocytic infiltrate in the intervillous compart-
ment. According to literature, it is related to poor foetal outcome, 
maternal autoimmune diseases (AD) and recurrence.
Methods: A retrospective review was conducted in all placentas 
and products of conception (over 21000 specimens) received in 
three major hospitals in Lisbon metropolitan area, between June 
2003 and February 2022, to detect cases with CHI as a major 
finding; cases with other major placental findings were excluded. 
Medical records were analysed regarding the associated clinical 
and obstetric data.
Results: A total of 34 cases were selected, which corresponded to 
32 women with mean age of 37 years (+/- 5 years). Half (17 cases) 
of pregnancies resulted in viable births, 9% (3 cases) in intrauterine 
deaths and 41% (14 cases) in spontaneous abortions. In 41% of 
cases there was intrauterine growth restriction, 3 cases (9%) had 
a single umbilical artery and 5 (15%) were associated with foetal 
malformations.
Only 25 women had an available medical record, AD were present 
in 3 (1 a previous diagnosis, 2 revealed after placental evaluation). 
Recorded recurrency was seen in 2 women and 3 other had a his-
tory of repeated aborditions without known histologic assessment.
Conclusion: Our incidence of CHI is similar to the literature; 
regarding the prevalence of maternal AD, our study reveals a 
lower incidence than usually observed. The question remains if 
an undiagnosed AD is present at the time of gestation or if CHI 
can precede the full setting of an AD and, if so, how long it takes 
between both events. We propose follow-up of these patients in 
a 5 years period, with special focus on CHI recurrency and AD 
incidence/prevalence.

Left ventricular non-compaction in foetal autopsy: a report 
of 6 cases
A. Nadal*, C. Fuster, N. Masoller, Ò. Rosiñol, J. Camacho, O. 
Gómez
*Hospital Clínic, Spain
Background & objectives: Left ventricular non-compaction 
(LVNC) results from arrest of normal process of ventricular com-
paction, resulting in a ratio between non-compacted and compacted 
myocardial layers >1. It is a rare condition of uncertain aetiology 
although likely genetic with dominant pattern of inheritance.
Methods: Cases with LVNC were retrieved from pathology files. 
Ultrasonographic and genetic data when available were retrieved 
from clinical charts. Histology when available was reviewed.
Results: LVNC was identified in 6 cases (three termination of 
pregnancies and three intrauterine foetal deaths) out of 3000 foetal 
autopsies. Gestational ages ranged from 13 to 25 weeks. Four out 
of five cases had ultrasound abnormalities with two foetal hydrops 
and one additional subcutaneous oedema. Cardiac abnormalities 
were identified in two cases. Three out of four cases with available 
genetic analysis had genetic alterations: X monosomy, 8q23 dele-
tion and heterozygous compound LDB3 mutations. Healthy carriers 
of LDB3 mutations were identified among the relatives of this case. 
Two of three sibs that shared the heterozygous compound LDB3 
mutations had LVNC, one being a live-born girl.
Conclusion: LVNC incidence was higher in this foetal autopsy 
series than it is reported in the paediatric population. Noncompacted 
cardiomyopathy must be considered in the differential diagnosis 
in cases of foetal hydrops and dilated cardiomyopathy. It 
must also be ruled out when other structural cardiac defects 
are found. The inheritance pattern found in LDB3 mutations, 
consistent with a recessive pattern, was not previously described.

Umbilical cord compromise versus other clinical conditions 
predisposing to placental foetal vascular malperfusion
J. Stanek*
*Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, USA
Background & objectives: Foetal vascular malperfusion (FVM) 
can be due to cord compromise, hypercoagulability, foetal cardiac 
dysfunction, or hypoxia. Although the cord compromise is most 
common, the relative importance of other factors is unclear which 
is the aim or this retrospective analysis.
Methods: 580 placentas were examined: Group 1: 52 placentas 
with clinical cord compromise/anatomical abnormalities, Group 
2: 204 placentas with maternal/ foetal conditions predisposing to 
FVM; Group 3: 286 placentas with coexisting at least one variable 
of Group 1 and one variable of Group 2 predisposing to FVM, 
Group 4: 38 placentas with no clinical conditions or cord factors 
predisposing to FVM.
Results: Average gestational age was the shortest in Group 4, fol-
lowed by Groups 1, 2 and 3. Groups 1 and 4 featured more cases 
with poor prenatal care, less frequent cesarean sections, more fre-
quent macerated stillbirths, less frequent neonatal stay in intensive 
care unit, atherosis of spiral arterioles, retroplacental hematomas, 
and luminal vascular abnormalities of chorionic villi. Clusters of 
sclerotic/stromal vascular karyorrhectic/mineralized chorionic 
villi, large vessel foetal vascular malperfusion, and low grade distal 
foetal vascular malperfusion were statistically significantly more 
common in Groups 1 and 3. There were no statistically significant 
differences in inflammatory and hypoxic lesions or patterns (acute 
or chronic) or lesions of shallow placental implantation among 
the groups.

Conclusion: Cases with isolated clinical umbilical cord compro-
mise were associated with the most unfavourable clinical outcome 
as umbilical cord complications and pathology strike unexpectedly 
and are notorious for unpredictability, causing stillbirths not asso-
ciated with other maternal or foetal diseases. This finding paral-
leled the histological segmental FVM most common in Groups 1 
and 3, both with the umbilical cord aetiology. The clinical risks 
alone for FVM alone, without the umbilical cord factors (Group 
2), were not associated with increased rate of FVM.

Placental recent/on-going foetal vascular malperfusion with 
endothelial fragmentation is diagnostically equivalent to 
established distal villous lesions of foetal vascular malperfusion
J. Stanek*
*Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, USA
Background & objectives: CD34 immunostaining increases 
sensitivity of placental diagnosis of foetal vascular malperfusion 
(FVM). This comparative retrospective study was performed to find 
out whether recent distal FVM lesions diagnosed with CD34 immu-
nostaining are diagnostically equivalent to remote FVM lesions 
diagnosed with hematoxylin-eosin
Methods: Clinical and placental phenotypes of 562 placentas from 
≥20weeks high-risk pregnancies were analysed: Group 1 - 158 
placentas with remote distal villous FVM (by H&E only), Group 
2 - 142 placentas showing clustered endothelial fragmentation 
by CD34 immunostaining, 98 of them also with H&E distal 
FVM lesions (on-going, temporal heterogeneity), Group 3 - 262 
placentas without distal villous FVM.
Results: Foetal congenital malformations were seen in most cases 
of each group (58.5% of all cases). Using Bonferroni correction, 
there were no statistically significant differences in clinical or pla-
cental phenotypes between Group 1 and Group 2, or among the 3 
groups (p>0.002). However, in Group 1, gestational age was the 
shortest, postnatal mortality most frequent, placental weight the 
smallest, intra villous haemorrhage, erythroblasts in foetal blood, 
hypertrophic decidual arteriopathy, and foetal vascular thrombi 
most common, and in Group 2, placental infarction, post-uterine 
pattern of chronic placental injury and excessive extra villous 
trophoblasts of chorionic disc were most common (p<0.05).
Conclusion: In this cohort of foetuses/neonates dominated by con-
genital malformations, distal villous FVM was the most common 
pattern of placental injury. The absence of statistically significant 
differences in clinical or placental phenotypes among all 3 groups 
indicates that distal villous FVM diagnosed by CD34 and that diag-
nosed by H&E are diagnostically/prognostically equivalent. CD34 
immunostaining is therefore a powerful tool in diagnosis of distal 
villous FVM.

Cardiac arrest with successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
induces histologic changes that correlate with survival time and 
lead to misdiagnosis in sudden arrhythmic death syndrome
J. Coelho Lima*, J. Westaby, M. Sheppard
*Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, United 
Kingdom
Background & objectives: Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome 
(SADS) is defined as sudden cardiac death (SCD) with a morpho-
logically normal heart. Cardiac arrest with cardiopulmonary resus-
citation (CPR) may induce cardiac histologic changes. We aimed 
to assess whether such changes could confound SADS diagnosis.
Methods: Retrospective observational study analysing all consecu-
tive cases of sudden death prospectively referred to a UK national 
cardiac pathology centre between January 2017 and November 
2021. Cases showing hypoperfusion features due to cardiac arrest 
followed by CPR were identified after review of clinical informa-
tion and examination by two expert cardiac pathologists. Data is 
presented as percentage or median.
Results: Out of 2,568 SCD cases, 126 (4.9%) were identified with 
hypoperfusion changes. Macroscopically, the commonest find-
ing was left ventricular focal or diffuse subendocardial haemor-
rhage (13.5%). Microscopically, haemorrhage and contraction 
band necrosis (n=50, 37.7%), subendocardial acute infarction 
(n=44, 34.1%), interstitial mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates 
(n=31, 24.9%), granulation tissue (n=9, 7.1%) and subendocardial 
fibrosis (n=1, 0.7%) were observed. These changes correlated to 
duration of survival following resuscitation, with subendocardial 
infarction and granulation tissue being observed later at 2 and 9.5 
days, respectively (p<0.001). In a subcohort of 41 cases, autopsy 
pathologists misinterpreted such changes as ischaemic myocardial 
infarction (n=7; 17%), myocarditis (n=5; 12.1%), or other patholo-
gies (n=2; 4.8%) in 14 SADS cases.
Conclusion: We provide a comprehensive characterisation of 
hypoperfusion-related changes in the heart following successful 
CPR with survival, which are time related. These features can 
lead to diagnostic confusion among pathologists but knowledge of 
history of resuscitation with survival should help with general and 
expert pathology assessment and improve SADS diagnostic yield, 
prompting genetic screening of decedents’ relatives.

Post-mortem pulmonary findings in a large series of COVID-19 
cases at the University of Texas Medical Branch (2020-2022): 
insights from an ancient and still relevant procedure
J.P. Olano*, I. Marin, J. Estrada
*University of Texas Medical Branch, USA
Background & objectives: COVID-19 is an infection due to 
SARS-CoV-2 and was declared by WHO a pandemic on March 11, 
2020. This project addresses the spectrum of pulmonary pathology 
in 294 autopsy cases performed at a single tertiary care institution.
Methods: A total of 294 autopsies were performed in our service 
between April 2020-2022. All cases were diagnosed by nucleic acid 
amplification (real-time RT-PCR) using post-mortem nasal swabs. 
Demographics, clinical history, gross and histologic findings were 
collected prospectively. Histologic sections were routinely stained 
with H&E, Masson’s Trichrome and MOVAT pentachrome. Other 
special stains were performed as needed (PAS-D, MSB, etc).
Results: The average age was 60 years (range: 28-94). Clinical 
spectrum ranged from asymptomatic infections (cause of death 
unrelated to COVID-19) to lethal outcome. Clinical course was 
2-120 days with an average of 19. The main risk factors included 
systemic hypertension, morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus, coro-
nary artery disease, congestive heart failure, emphysema, cir-
rhosis and chronic renal disease. The main complications were 
hepatic encephalopathy, thrombotic microangiopathy, acute 
kidney injury (AKI) and bacterial bronchopneumonia. Virtually 
all lungs showed markedly increase weight and consolidation. 
Histologic findings included interstitial pneumonitis, oedema, 
hyaline membranes, acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, type 
2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, reactive/atypical type 2 pneumocytes, 
fibroblastic foci in alveolar spaces, fibrosis, squamous and bron-
chiolar metaplasia.
Conclusion: Virtually all patients had at least one risk factor, the 
most common being systemic hypertension. Numerous patients had 
two or more risk factors. The spectrum of histologic findings in the

lung is broad with overlapping features, and spatial and temporal 
heterogeneity as opposed to conventional diffuse alveolar damage. 
The most common complication is hepatic encephalopathy due 
to the presence of liver cirrhosis in this population, followed by 
thrombotic microangiopathy and AKI. Other complications were 
related to hypercoagulability or bleeding diathesis.

Patterns of infectious disease identified in clinical autopsy. The 
role of autopsy as an ancillary study in determining the cause 
of death
M. Khaba*, M. Dikotope, N. Makhado
*Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University, South Africa
Background & objectives: Infectious diseases are one of the 
most prevalent diseases in clinical autopsies. Despite its value, 
the use of autopsies has decreased and infectious diseases are 
often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to the lack of pathological 
understanding.
Methods: This was an 8 year retrospective study of autopsy cases 
with final diagnosis of infectious diseases.
Results: The study consisted of 52 autopsies which comprised 
of 32 female (61.53%) and 20 males (38.46%) with mean age of 
28 years. HIV/AIDS was the commonest comorbidity (17/52; 
32.69%). Bacterial pneumonia (80.76%) was one of the most 
common infectious diseases, followed by septic shock (19.23%), 
candidiasis (14%), bacterial meningitis (9.61%), tuberculosis 
(7,69%), cryptococcosis (7.69%), cytomegalovirus infection 
(5.26%) and herpes simplex virus infection and mucormycosis each 
1.92%. Antemortem diagnosis was incorrect in 63.46% (33/52) of 
the cases.
Conclusion: The use of autopsy for years has been the gold stand-
ard for establishing the causes of death and have played a valuable 
role in the diagnosis and understanding of diseases. Autopsies have 
also informed public health strategies in the fight against these 
communicable diseases.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on autopsy practice
M. Carter*, S. Brennan, L. Clarke, K. O’Hare
*Tallaght University Hospital, Ireland
Background & objectives: Tallaght University Hospital autopsies 
from the two years before and after the onset of the COVID-19 
pandemic were analysed. We hypothesised that the pandemic 
would cause fewer autopsies, increased use of ancillary testing 
and prolonged time from death to autopsy.
Methods: All autopsies conducted between mid-March 2018 and 
mid-March 2022 were analysed for basic demographic information, 
location of death (community, emergency department or hospital 
inpatient) and the use of ancillary studies such as toxicology, his-
tology, microbiology and subspecialty examination. The data from 
the two years prior to the pandemic (Study Period 1) and following 
two years (Study Period 2) were compared.
Results: Fewer post-mortem examinations were conducted in 
Study Period 2 (n = 238) compared to Study Period 1 (n = 418). An 
institutional change in autopsy practice accounts for much of this 
decrease, however the data for emergency department deaths only 
also showed a significantly fewer autopsies between Study Period 
1 and 2 (n = 90 v n = 52). Average time from death to autopsy 
significantly increased (2.3 days v 3.8 days, p-value <0.01). The 
use of toxicology, histology, neuropathology and non-SARS-CoV-2 
microbiology did not change significantly. The use of post-mortem 
microbiology has increased primarily due to screening for SARS-
CoV-2 with 95.4% of decedents undergoing nasopharyngeal swab-
bing since mid-March 2020.
Conclusion: Since the beginning of the pandemic our institution 
has found a reduction in autopsy examinations, an increased inter-
val between death and autopsy and an increased use of micro-
biological ancillary testing. The demographic characteristics of 
our autopsy cases, and rates of use of non-microbiology ancillary 
testing have not changed significantly.

Analysis of the causes of death in cases of COVID-19 based on 
maternal mortality cases during the pandemic
A. Sapargaliyeva*, D. Mirzakhmetova, I. Yefimenko
*Pathology Bureau of Almaty City; Al-Farabi Kazakh National 
University (Department of Fundamental Medicine), Kazakhstan
Background & objectives: Officially COVID-19 led to a sharp 
increase in maternal mortality in the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
There were 156 cases of maternal death in 2020 and 200 cases 
in 2021.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 78 cases 
of maternal death for the period of 2020-2021 with a clinical 
diagnosis of COVID-19 to determine a cause of death. All women 
(32-39 weeks of pregnancy) were admitted to the hospital with 
positive PCR results for COVID-19. The death of women occurred 
within 3 to 45 days after hospitalization.
Results: In 67 cases out of 78 morphological signs of COVID-
19 were identified. However, the morphological spectrum of lung 
damage was quite diverse, including acute tracheobronchitis, 
pulmonary oedema, and massive hyaline membranes (in 8 cases). 
In 31 cases, there were signs of bacterial and fungal infection with 
COVID-19. In 28 cases, the cause of maternal death was obstetric 
pathology, but squamous metaplasia of the epithelium of the 
trachea and large bronchi and signs of exudate organization in the 
alveoli were detected.
Conclusion: Based on our analysis of COVID-19, massive hyaline 
membranes were the cause of death, but in a small number of cases. 
The death of patients with COVID-19 in most cases was associated 
with a bacterial or fungal infection. Squamous metaplasia of 
the epithelium of the trachea and large bronchi and giant cell 
transformation of alveolar macrophages indicate a viral infection.

Cadherin-16 (CDH16) immunohistochemistry: a novel diagnos-
tic tool for renal cell carcinoma and papillary carcinomas of 
the thyroid

Höflmayer, R. Simon, G. Sauter, T.S. Clauditz, A. Hinsch
*University Medical Center Hamburg, Germany
Background & objectives: Cadherin-16 (CDH16), also termed 
kidney specific cadherin (ksp-cadherin), is a membrane-associated 
glycoprotein with a role in the embryonal development of tubuli in 
kidney and thyroid. Downregulation of CDH16 RNA was found in 
papillary carcinomas of the thyroid.
Methods: A set of tissue microarrays containing 14,978 sam-
ples from 149 different tumour types and subtypes as well as 
S34
Virchows Archiv (2022) 481 (Suppl 1):S1–S364
1 3
608 samples of 76 different normal tissue types was analysed by 
immunohistochemistry to determine the expression of CDH16 in 
cancer and to assess the diagnostic utility of immunohistochemical 
CDH16 analysis.
Results: Among normal tissues, a membranous CDH16 immu-
nostaining predominated in thyroid, kidney, cauda epididymis, and 
in mesonephric remnants. In the thyroid, CDH16 staining was seen 
in all normal samples, 83% of follicular adenomas, 58% of follicu-
lar carcinomas, but in only 9% of papillary carcinomas (p<0.0001). 
CDH16 positivity was particularly frequent in nephrogenic adeno-
mas (100%), oncocytomas (98%), chromophobe (97%), clear cell 
(85%), and papillary (76%) renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), clear cell 
(56%), mucinous (36%), and endometroid (16%) carcinomas as well 
as carcinosarcomas (18%) of the ovary, adenocarcinomas of the 
cervix uteri (40%), serous (33%), clear cell (33%), and endometroid 
carcinomas (18%) of the endometrium and in various subtypes of 
neuroendocrine neoplasms (4-26%).
Conclusion: Given the massive loss of CDH16 expression 
in >90% of papillary carcinomas of the thyroid, CDH16 is a 
highly useful diagnostic marker for these tumours. CDH16 
immunohistochemistry is also useful for the identification of 
nephrogenic adenomas and the distinction of renal cell carcinomas 
from other neoplasms.

Pediatric thyroid nodules: a multi-institutional study from 
India based on the applicability of the Bethesda System with 
analysis of the risk of malignancy (ROM) and comparison with 
adult thyroid nodules
C. Rana*, N. Nigam, S. Agarwal, P. Mishra, A. Bychkov
*King George’s Medical University, India
Background & objectives: This study analyses the paediatric 
thyroid nodules based on the Bethesda system and compares the 
risk of malignancy (ROM) with adults (>18 yrs) across various 
Bethesda categories. It also compares young adults (19-21 yrs) 
with the other two age groups.
Methods: This is a retrospective multi-institutional, where archival 
thyroid cytology and histology data were retrieved. The cases were 
segregated into paediatric (<18 years), young adult (19-21 years), 
and adults (>18 years) age groups. The Bethesda distribution across 
the different age groups and diagnosis on follow-up resection were 
collated. The ROM in the various categories was compared across 
the different age groups.
Results: A total of 5,958 FNA for thyroid swelling were performed 
over a period of 5 years. The paediatric patients constituted 3.3% 
(n=199) of all the cases. Follow-up histology was available in 2276 
patients. The malignancy was significantly higher in patients <18b 
yrs as compared to adults (18 % vs. 12.7% p-value 0.02). Interest-
ingly, surgical resection rates were also higher in paediatric groups 
in almost all the categories except benign. Similar to the paediatric 
age group, the young adult patients also underwent a significantly 
higher number of resections as compared to adults. The risk of 
malignancy was comparable between paediatric and young adults 
age groups.
Conclusion: There was no significant difference in the distribu-
tion of Bethesda categories between the adult and paediatric age 
groups. When resected, paediatric patients are more likely to har-
bour malignancies than adults with thyroid nodules as the overall 
risk of malignancy is higher in children as compared to adults. 
Importantly, the young adult group (19-21 yrs) may behave in a 
similar manner to paediatric suggesting a reconsideration of the 
upper age limit, however, more studies are required to further vali-
date this finding.

Hackeng, L.A. Brosens
*Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Utrecht, 
Utrecht University, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: The diagnosis of multiple endocrine 
neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome is confirmed with a germline 
mutation in the MEN1 gene. As 5-25% of patients suspected of 
MEN1 remain without definitive genetic diagnosis we investigate 
the added value of menin immunohistochemistry.
Methods: From 16 MEN1 syndrome patients 31 parathyroid 
adenomas were collected. As control group, 61 parathyroid 
adenomas were collected from 32 non MEN1 syndrome patients, 
these included sporadic (n=30), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 
2A (n=1) and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumour (n=1) patients. 
Menin immunohistochemistry was performed and its use for 
identification of MEN1 syndrome related tumours was assessed.
Results: 14 out of 16 MEN1 syndrome patients and 3 out of 32 non 
MEN1 patients showed nuclear menin loss on immunohistochem-
istry. On average 1,9 tumours were resected per patient. Using a 
cut-off of at least one tumour showing menin loss on immunohisto-
chemistry per patient, the sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing 
MEN1 syndrome was 87,5% and 90,1% respectively. Using a cut 
off of 2 tumours showing menin loss on immunohistochemistry, 
the specificity raised to 100%. Menin immunostaining on two cases 
with a germline variance of unknown significance in the MEN1 
gene illustrates the additional value of menin immunohistochem-
istry in MEN1 diagnosis.
Conclusion: Menin immunohistochemistry is useful in the 
recognition of MEN1 syndrome and in the genetic analysis of 
patients with inconclusive MEN1 germline testing.

BRAF mutation and AXL (hyper)expression as markers of high 
risk for persistent/recurrent papillary thyroid cancer (PTC)
M. Martini*, C. Pizzimenti, A. Ieni, A. Campennì, L. Giovanella, 
G. Fadda
*Università degli Studi di Messina, Italy
Background & objectives: Thyroidectomy followed with 131-radi-
oiodine therapy (RIT) is the main treatment for differentiated thy-
roid cancer (DTC) patients with an excellent response rate. The 
understanding of the PTC molecular mechanisms may be useful to 
identify patients with higher risk of persistent disease.
Methods: We analysed 42 low (n=32) or intermediate (n=10) risk 
PTC patients subjected to total-thyroidectomy and RIT with abla-
tive or adjuvant purpose. The response to treatments were evalu-
ated 6-12 months after RIT. The mutational status of BRAF, RAS, 
TERT, PIK3 and RET, the expression of PD-L1 (as CPS score) and 
AXL gene and CD4/CD8 ratio were analysed on surgical pathol-
ogy specimens.
Results: Thirty patients had an excellent response (ER), 6 an inde-
terminate/incomplete bio-chemical response (BIndR/ BIR) and 6 
a structural incomplete response (SIR). A significant correlation 
was found between BRAF mutation and high expression of AXL 
gene (p= 0.001) and between these parameters and persistent/recur-
rent disease, respectively (p=0.02 and p=0.03). BRAF mutation 
and high expression of AXL gene were also correlated to PD-L1 
expression (p=0.004 and p=0.002). Moreover, PTC patients with 
persistent disease showed significantly higher PD-L1 and AXL 
expression and lower level of CD4/CD8 ratio (p=0.021, p=0.032 
S35
Virchows Archiv (2022) 481 (Suppl 1):S1–S364
	
1 3
and p= 0.015, respectively). No significant association was found 
about RAS, TERT, PIK3 and RET alterations and persistent/recur-
rent disease, PD-L1 and AXL expression.
Conclusion: This data suggests that BRAF mutation and AXL 
(hyper)expression are correlated with increased expression of 
PD-L1 and CD8 in PTC patients with persistent disease with 
respect to those without persistent/recurrent disease after initial 
treatments. Accordingly, they should be considered as potential 
biomarkers of aggressive behaviour of PTC also suggesting other 
possible therapeutical targets.

Background & objectives: Prognosis of patients with medullary 
thyroid carcinoma (MTC) remains difficult to establish. The objec-
tive of our study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the patho-
molecular characteristics in MTC.
Methods: Tumour tissues from primary MTC patients diagnosed 
at Gustave Roussy between 2003 and 2020 were reviewed to assess 
conventional prognostic factors and immunophenotype. Mutational 
status of RET was determined using New Generation Sequencing. 
Outcomes included overall survival (OS), biological (B-DFS) and 
morphological disease free survival (M-DFS). Univariate and mul-
tivariate statistical studies were conducted.
Results: 207 patients were included: 56% were females and the 
median age was 54 years. In the univariate study for OS: age (>50 
years), size (>4cm), extrathyroidal extension, positive surgical 
margins, absence of encapsulation (AE), necrosis, high mitotic 
index (MI) (≥5 mitosis/2mm2), lymphovascular invasion, atypi-
cal mitosis were significantly associated with poor outcome. In 
the multivariate study, only AE(p=0.034), necrosis(p=0.001) and 
MI(p<0.001) remained statistically significant. Using the IMTCGS 
grading system, high grade tumours (MI≥5 and/or Ki67≥5 and/or 
necrosis) were associated to a decreased OS, B-DFS and M-DFS. 
Somatic RET_M918T mutation was found in 31/127(37%). There 
were no prognostic significant difference between high grade 
(15/50) and low grade (16/77) RET mutated MTC.
Conclusion: In patients with MTC, AE, necrosis and high MI were 
associated with poor OS, thus validating the prognostic value of 
IMTCGS in an independent cohort. Ten of the high grade and seven 
of the low grade RET_M918T mutated cases experienced relapse, 
suggesting that this biological trait may represent an independent 
biological prognostic factor from IMTCGS. Analysis of a larger 
panel is necessary to confirm these data.

Differential expression profiles of immunoregulatory genes in 
poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas pro-
gressive from papillary carcinoma

Zambelli, M. Volante, M. Papotti
*University of Turin, Italy
Background & objectives: Few data are available on the immu-
noregulatory mechanisms of thyroid cancer, with special reference 
to aggressive forms. We aimed at identifying profiles of expression 
of immune-related genes in anaplastic (AC) and poorly-differenti-
ated (PDC) carcinomas with associated papillary carcinoma (PC) 
components.
Methods: Expression levels of over 700 genes involved in immune 
to tumour response mechanisms were investigated by using the 
nCounter® PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel in 9 PDC and 12 
AC, all having a PC associated component. Moreover, in the 12 AC 
cases the matched PC component was analysed in parallel.
Results: Over 200 genes were differentially expressed in PDC 
as compared to AC samples, affecting all main pathways covered 
by the panel. All pathways were down-regulated in PDC. Pair-
wise analysis of AC and matched PC components showed a stable 
pattern of expression for most genes, with a few showing a high 
statistically significant differential expression (p<0.001 in t test 
analysis). Among those, 5 (MAP3K1, PRKCD, CYFIP2, BLNK 
and EPCAM) were down- and 6 (RIPK2, ITGB1, CCL3L1, ITGA5, 
PLAUR and TICAM2) were up-regulated in AC. Interestingly, for 
9 of these 11 genes the pattern of deregulation between PC and AC 
components was consistent in all samples.
Conclusion: PDC and AC possess specific and different expression 
profiles of immunoregulatory genes even in the presence of 
a similar histological pattern of progression. Unexpectedly, 
progression of PC to AC is not associated with a wide deregulation 
of immunoregulatory mechanisms. However, a subset of genes 
is consistently impaired during AC progression, whose role as 
biomarkers and functional mechanisms need to be assessed and 
validated in future studies.

Casas, J. Molina Cerrillo, T. Alonso Gordoa, I. Ruz Caracuel
*Ramón y Cajal University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is 
a rare malignant tumour without a widely accepted grading scheme. 
In 2021, a multicentric study developed the International Medul-
lary Thyroid Carcinoma Grading System. We seek to employ this 
system and analyse its prognostic value.
Methods: We reviewed slides from a single-centre cohort of 28 
MTC since 2002. Tumours were assigned high-grade based on 
the presence of at least one of three parameters: mitotic index ≥5 
mitosis/2mm2, Ki67 proliferative index ≥5%, and tumour necrosis. 
We compiled additional pathological features and clinical informa-
tion to perform a survival analysis.
Results: We identified 7 high-grade carcinomas (25%) and 21 
low-grade carcinomas (75%). Two high-grade carcinomas showed 
all three parameters, whereas one presented both Ki67 prolifera-
tive index and tumour necrosis. Two expressed only Ki67 prolif-
erative index ≥5% and the remaining two had tumour necrosis. 
High-grade carcinomas frequently showed an infiltrative pattern, 
spindle cell morphology, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node 
metastasis at diagnosis, AJCC stage III or IV, extrathyroidal 
extension, and affected surgical margins. Statistical analysis 
demonstrated decreased overall survival (median 41.57 months 
vs 64.80 months; LR= 17.412; p<0.001) and decreased disease-
free survival (median 6.57 months vs 46.87 months; LR= 10.276;

*Shizuoka General Hospital, Japan
Background & objectives: The up-regulation of 
p62(sequestosome1) and brain fatty acid binding protein(FABP7) 
was reported in apocrine carcinoma of the breast(ACB). Salivary 
duct carcinoma(SDC) is frequently seen as carcinomatous 
component of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma(CXPA). We 
aim to elucidate their expressions in SDC.
Methods: We selected SDC cases from a pathology file of 11 insti-
tutions during 2000-2020, immunostained them for p62, FABP7 
and GATA3, adding to androgen receptor(AR), and gross cystic 
disease fluid protein(GCDFP)-15. In the assessment for p62, 
nuclear signals were estimated as N type, whereas cytoplasmic 
signals were estimated as CY type. We examined with statistical 
analysis using R version 3.6.2 software.
Results: One hundred six cases were selected as SDC, including 59 
cases of CXPA (20 cases of intracapsular type, 8 cases of minimally 
invasive type and 31 cases of widely invasive type). Eighty one 
percent of SDC was positive for p62 (N type, 59%; CY type, 10%; 
N+CY type, 23%). Twenty-nine percent and 90% of SDC were 
positive for GATA3 and FABP7, respectively. Fifty-two percent 
and 45% of SDC were positive for AR and GCDFP-15, respectively. 
The expression status of p62 CY type or (-) was related to worse 
outcome, whereas the GATA3(+) cases were related to better 
outcome. Atypical pleomorphic adenoma expressed p62(N type 
only) in the atypical luminal cells.
Conclusion: SDC should be called “apocrine carcinoma of the 
salivary glands”, due to the positivity for p62, FABP7 and GATA3, 
like ACB. Adding to GCDFP-15 and AR, the combinations of p62, 
FABP7 and GATA3 were considered to be new diagnostic markers 
for SDC. On the other hands, in the cases of CXPA, the luminal 
cells of PA may acquire the apocrine differentiation during the 
malignant transformation to SDC.

The prognostic role of cortactin overexpression in oral squa-
mous cell carcinoma of tongue: large cohort study
B. Toközlü*, D. Sapkota, E.M. Vallenari, O. Schreurs, T. Soland
*Gazi University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Among oral cancer patients, those with 
squamous cell carcinoma of the oral (anterior 2/3rd) tongue are 
more likely to have higher mortality rates. Cortactin protein has 
been linked with progression and nodal involvement in the head 
and neck carcinoma.
Methods: One hundred twenty-five HPV negative, formalin fixed 
paraffin embedded specimens were used to show cortacin expres-
sion by constructing tissue microarrays using tissue cores of 2 mm 
diameter from both tumours invading front and the corresponding 
superficial/central areas.
Followed by an analysis of tumour cell invasion in 3D-organotypic 
co-culture models after siRNA mediated silencing of CTTN gene.
Results: Cortactin expression was higher at the invading core 
than at the corresponding central cores. High overall cortactin 
expression was positively associated with tumour size and distant 
metastases. High overall cortactin expression was associated with 
reduced 5-year overall survival. siRNA-mediated knockdown of 
cortactin resulted in reduced proliferative and invasive abilities of 
cell lines in 3D-organotypic co-culture models.
Conclusion: We showed that the expression of cortactin was 
significantly higher at the invading cores than at the corresponding 
central cores. The results of current study also demonstrated that 
the overexpression of cortactin was associated with a significantly 
reduced overall survival. Increased expression of cortactin was 
similarly associated with tumour size and distant metastasis. These 
findings were further confirmed by analysing the invasive and 
proliferative abilities of cells in 3D-organotypics. Our findings 
suggest a prognostic value for cortactin in oral cancer.

Diagnostic utility of NR4A3 and NR4A2 immunohistochemistry 
in salivary gland pathology: a single-institution experience with 
108 cases of acinic cell carcinoma
N. Klubickova*, A. Skalova, O. Koshyk, E. Mosaieby
*Bioptical Laboratory Ltd., Czech Republic
Background & objectives: Acinic cell carcinoma (AciCC) is 
a common salivary gland malignancy, typically composed of 
neoplastic acinic cells with zymogen granules. The vast majority of 
cases are driven by a t(4;9)(q13;q31) leading to enhancer hijacking 
and upregulation of the NR4A3 gene.
Methods: Seventy-one cases of classic low-grade AciCC, as 
well as 37 cases with high-grade transformation (HGT), were 
retrieved from institutional files and included in the analysis 
(n=108). Immunohistochemistry for DOG1, SOX10 and NR4A3 
was performed in all cases; all NR4A3-negative and 10 NR4A3-
positive cases were subsequently stained for NR4A2. FISH analysis 
of NR4A3 gene rearrangement was carried out in 1 case.
Results: The patients’ age ranged from 17 to 86 years (mean=56). 
Patients with HGT were almost two decades older than patients 
with low-grade AciCC (mean=67 vs. mean=50). 67% of patients 
were female. One hundred cases were primary tumours, most com-
monly occurring in the parotid gland, 6 cases represented recur-
rences, and 2 lung/pleural metastases were sampled. Immunohis-
tochemical staining for DOG1 and SOX10 was positive in 94% 
and 97% cases, respectively. NR4A3 was at least focally positive 
in 104/108 (96%) cases. NR4A3 rearrangement was confirmed by 
FISH in 1 analysed case. Out of the 4 NR4A3-negative cases, 2 dis-
played strong nuclear immunopositivity with the NR4A2 antibody, 
while all 10 NR4A3-positive cases were negative.
Conclusion: Our analysis confirms that majority of AciCC, 
including cases with HGT, are immunopositive for NR4A3, and 
suggests that NR4A3 immunohistochemistry is a powerful tool 
in the differential diagnosis of salivary gland tumours. However, 
its utility is limited in older and/or sub-optimally fixed samples 
which often display weaker and focal positivity. Our study also 
indicates that in minority of cases, AciCC might be negative for 
NR4A3 immunostaining because the pathogenic genetic event in 
these cases is rather the overexpression of NR4A2.

Republic
Background & objectives: Sinonasal adenocarcinomas (SNAC) 
are classified as salivary and non-salivary adenocarcinomas. 
Non-salivary adenocarcinomas encompass a spectrum of high-
grade intestinal-type adenocarcinomas (ITAC) and low-grade 
lesions potentially originating from seromucinous structures 
non-intestinal type adenocarcinomas (non-ITAC). The molecular 
genetic background is pleomorphic and inconsistent.
Methods: Retrospectively, 12 cases of sinonasal lesions with a 
detected gene mutation or gene fusion were selected from the 
registry of tumours. The cohort included seven cases of low-
grade lesions or benign tumours and 5 cases of high-grade car-
cinomas. These tumours were compared morphologically and 
immunohistochemically.
Results: Low-grade lesions represented classic forms of 
seromucinous hamartoma / respiratory epithelial adenomatoid 
hamartoma or non-ITAC. High-grade tumours were basaloid, 
keratin positive, solid to papillary. The architecture was mostly 
monotonous.
In the low-grade malignant/benign subgroup there were detected 
6 gene mutations (2x BRAF 2x RET, 1x KRAS, and 1x PDGFRA 
– this case showed an MYB::NFIB gene fusion).
In a group of high-grade carcinomas, ETV6::NTRK3 and 
EWSR1::COLCA1/2 were found in 2 cases. One case of epi-
thelial-myoepithelial sinonasal carcinoma harboured an HRAS 
mutation. One case of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma 
developed two gene mutations in IDH2 and ASXL1 genes. One 
case of high-grade carcinoma showed dual CREBBP and BRIP1 
gene mutation.
Conclusion: The sinonasal tract encompasses a wide spectrum 
of high-grade or low-grade lesions with pleomorphic molecular-
genetic backgrounds and only a few of them are truly defined 
by gene fusion/mutation. There is a need to perform a further 
investigation to state the correlation between morphology and 
molecular genetics to better understand pathogenesis.

malignant transformation

*Department of Pathology, Charles University, Faculty of 
Medicine in Plzen, and Bioptic Laboratory, Ltd, Plzen, Czech 
Republic
Background & objectives: Sinonasal hamartomas (SH) and 
respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamartoma (REAH) are rare 
and underestimated lesions. The term hamartoma is used for an 
indolent lesion without neoplastic potential, however, SH/REAH 
does not always behave accordingly.
Methods: We have investigated twenty cases of “dysplastic” 
polypoid lesions diagnosed either as REAH and SH, adenoid 
cystic carcinoma (AdCC) arising in SH or REAH, and low-
grade non-intestinal-type tubulopapillary adenocarcinoma (LG 
non-ITAC) arising in SH, low-grade adenocarcinoma ex REAH, 
and solitary fibrous tumour with SH. All cases were evaluated 
morphologically and immunohistochemically and 17 cases were 
tested by molecular-genetic methods.
Results: Dysplastic features of SH/REAH contained irregular 
cystic glands with atypical epithelial lining with occasional loss of 
stratification and often intraluminal snouts. The cells had nuclear 
membrane irregularities and coarse chromatin. The stroma was 
densely fibrotic almost of desmoplastic character. Immunohis-
tochemical expression of p63 was patchy or negative in SH but 
preserved in AdCC. Interestingly, expressions of both S100 and 
SOX10 markers were observed in the seromucinous component but 
were lost in the AdCC component. We have detected 4 cases with 
gene fusions (MYB::NFIB and MYBL1::NFIB) and 5 cases with 
developed gene mutation (BRAF, RET, and PDGFRA).
Conclusion: Our findings not only strongly support that SH/REAH 
are genuine tumours, but also suggest that may represent a precur-
sor lesion for the development of malignancies. SH/REAH may 
develop dysplastic features with the potential for risky behaviour. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest molecular-genetic 
study of REAH/SH with the occurrence of glandular atypia in them 
and with a subset of cases with a direct transition into AdCC or 
LG non-ITAC.

Multiparametric, in situ study of the microenvironment (MTE) 
of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC): impact 
of human papillomavirus (HPV). Macrophagic Infiltration 
Study
J. Martin*, M. Durand, C. Lepine, Y. Harrar, J. Bastian, C. Badoual
*laboratoire Inserm U970, PARCC, Université Paris Cité, France
Background & objectives: Our study aims to explore the com-
position of HPV-driven Head & Neck Squamous cell carcinoma 
(HNSCC) tumour microenvironment (TME), in particular the mac-
rophagic infiltration.
Methods: A multiplex immunofluorescence macrophage signature 
was applied to 127 patients with HPV-driven HNSCC, using the 
OPAL® technique developed by AKOYA BioSciences®.
This technique allowed us to apply a macrophage labelling of 7 mark-
ers in a sequential manner. Macrophage polarization (CD68, CD163), 
expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-L1, PD-L2), tumour 
cells (CK) and negative regulation pathway of phagocytosis (SIRPa, 
CD47).
Results: A mapping of the distribution of macrophages between 
stroma and tumour could be established: unconventional mac-
rophages called "M2" would be more abundant in the stroma, con-
ventional macrophages called "M1" appear to be evenly distributed 
between tissues and stroma.
The expression of PD-L1 by M1 and M2 macrophages does not 
seem to be associated with the level of expression of HPV E6 and 
E7 mRNA in CISH. However, there is a statistical trend in favour 
of a correlation between the population of intratumoural M1 mac-
rophages expressing SIRPa and the level of E6 and E7 expression.
Conclusion: Thus, E6 and E7 oncoproteins appear to influence 
SIRPa expression on macrophages M1 in HPV-driven OPSCC. 
There is a need to confirm the prognostic value of SIRPa expres-
sion and to further identify interactions with different lymphocyte 
populations.

Differential expansion of innate lymphoid cells and their role 
in oral squamous cell carcinoma
S.A. Syed*, M.A. Qureshi, S. Khan, R. Kumar
*Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan
Background & objectives: Oral cancers are the commonest 
reported cancers in Pakistani males and 2nd commonest in females. 
We investigated infiltration and potential role(s) of innate lymphoid 
cells (ILCs) in an accelerated murine model of oral carcinogenesis 
and in well-defined human cancers.
Methods: We established an accelerated murine model of oral 
carcinogenesis and characterized tissue infiltration of ILCs in 
harvested cancer tissues using flowcytometry. We also investigated 
ILCs infiltration in well-defined human oral cancer tissues. 
Moreover, we inhibited ILCs using α-Th1 antibody to investigate 
potential role of ILCs in progression of oral cancers.
Results: 84% of the mice treated with 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-
benzanthracene (DMBA) carcinogenic regime developed moderately 
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and showed differential 
expansion of ILCs in various cancers. Moreover, well defined human 
oral squamous cell carcinoma samples also exhibited increased 
infiltration of ILCs (along with increased expression of selected/
relevant cytokines). Tumour progression did not significantly differ 
upon inhibition of ILCs using α-Th1 antibody. However, ILCs 
expansion was different amongst the antibody treated and untreated 
groups.
Conclusion: We present novel data on differential expansion of 
ILCs in oral cancers which demands further exploration to exploit 
these newly discovered cells to devise novel diagnostic, therapeutic 
and prognostic strategies to prevent/treat oral cancers.

High-grade transformation in salivary gland tumours: a rare 
and under-recognized phenomenon
N. Batra*, A. Patil, N. Mittal, S. Rane, K. Kante, M. Bal
*Tata Memorial Hospital, India
Background & objectives: High-grade transformation (HGT) in 
salivary gland tumours (SGT) is an extremely rare phenomenon 
associated with aggressive clinical course. Herein, we aimed to 
study the clinicopathological spectrum of SGT with HGT diag-
nosed at our institute.
Methods: Clinical data and pathologic material of all cases (2014-
2022) was reviewed and diagnosis confirmed as per the WHO 
2017. HGT was defined by presence of unequivocal areas of high-
grade carcinoma coexisting with conventional low-grade salivary 
gland carcinoma. Clinical and treatment details were recorded from 
the electronic medical records. Pathologic features of HGT and 
conventional areas were recorded and compared.
Results: 18 cases were identified. The median age was 53 years; 
male-to-female ratio was 2:3. The sites included:submandibular 
(n=5), parotid (n=4), palate (n=4), tongue (n=2), and 1 case 
each in nasopharynx, nasal cavity, floor of mouth, buccal 
mucosa, and maxilla. The histologic types included: adenoid 
cystic carcinoma (ACC, n=12), epithelial-myoepithelial car-
cinoma (n=4), polymorphous adenocarcinoma (n=1), acinic 
cell carcinoma (n=1). HGT areas displayed high-grade cytol-
ogy, necrosis, brisk mitoses, and higher Ki-67 in comparison 
to their low-grade counterparts. Poorly differentiated adeno-
carcinoma was the most common HGT histology. Extra-paren-
chymal spread, margin involvement, lymphovascular and peri-
neural invasion were identified in 50%, 25%, 30%, and 50%, 
respectively.
Conclusion: HGT of salivary neoplasms is a rare and frequently 
under-recognized occurrence that portends a poor prognosis. ACC 
is the most frequent underlying histology. Accurate diagnosis is 
essential as aggressive treatment is warranted.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the breast: multidimensional 
profiling reveals novel biomarkers and genetic drivers

Lucioni, U. Malapelle, F. Pagni, M. Barberis, E. Guerini Rocco,

*IEO, European Institute of Oncology, Italy
Background & objectives: Breast mucoepidermoid carcinomas 
(MEC) are rare salivary gland-type triple-negative breast cancers 
(TNBC), often considered low-risk malignancies. Their biology is 
poorly understood, so they pose diagnostic and clinical challenges. 
We sought to characterize the molecular landscape of breast MECs.
Methods: Thirteen breast MEC were histologically confirmed and 
subjected to tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) profiling and 
PD-L1 (combined positive score, CPS), EGFR, and amphiregulin 
(AREG) immunohistochemistry. The MAML2 and EWSR1 rear-
rangements (recurrent in salivary MECs) were investigated by 
fluorescent in situ hybridization. Eight cases with enough tissue 
material were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 
161 cancer-related genes.
Results: Most cases were of low histological grade with Ki67<30% 
(n=10/13, 77%). TILs were found in 2 (17%) cases, while PD-L1 
CPS ranged from 0 to 20 (median 12.5). All cases with available 
material showed EGFR overexpression and were AREG-positive 
(n=9/9, 100%). No MAML2 and/or EWSR1 rearrangements were 
detected. Pathogenic mutations in PIK3CA were highly recurrent 
(n=4/8; 50%), though only 1 (12.5%) case harboured a TP53 
mutation. Additional somatic mutations affecting cancer-related 
genes found in MECs included CDK2, NF1/2, AKT1, SMARCB1, 
MYC, KRAS, CDK4, NOTCH1, and FGFR3/4. Taken together, 
complex patterns of genetic alterations were observed in PI3K/
AKT/mTOR and cell cycle regulation pathways.
Conclusion: Here, we present the broadest collection of breast 
MECs comprehensively profiled for their molecular alterations. We 
demonstrate that these tumours lack the hallmark TP53 mutations 
often found in high-grade TNBC as well as MAML2 or EWSR1 
rearrangements. The low TILs and PD-L1 levels suggest an immu-
noediting deficiency and that MECs may unlikely respond to 
immunotherapy combination strategies. Finally, the EGFR-AREG 
axis activation, and genomic alterations in PI3K/AKT/mTOR and 
cell cycle regulation pathways warrant caution in considering 
MECs as low-grade TNBCs.

Background & objectives: Heterogeneity of metastatic pattern of 
breast cancer hampers treatment decisions. Large scale studies into 
underlying biological and patient specific factors are necessary to 
progress for future treatment of metastatic diseases.
Methods: Pathological records of 4831 patients diagnosed with 
breast cancer who underwent autopsy between 1974 and 2010 were 
retrieved from Dutch nationwide pathology databank (PALGA). 
Natural language processing (NLP) methods were applied to extract 
data from autopsy reports. Named entity recognition was based on 
SNOMED codes that are utilized in PALGA.
Results: The accuracy of data retrieval with NLP was above 0.9 
and recall was 0.94 for majority of cases. Our model outperformed 
manual extraction of value of interest. We identified 2622 (54.2%) 
of patients with metastatic disease. Invasive ductal carcinoma, 
and mucinous carcinoma more frequently metastasized to lung 
and liver, whereas for invasive lobular carcinoma and mixed type 
this was to bone and liver respectively. There was no statistically 
significant association between lateralization and metastatic pat-
terns, except for kidney (right= 5.0%, left= 8.9%, bilateral= 13.3%, 
p= 0.007). In a subgroup of patients, we found that (ER+/HER2+) 
patients, were more likely to metastasize to liver and bone, com-
pared to (ER-/HER2+) patients.
Conclusion: This is the first large-scale study that demonstrates 
artificial intelligence methods are efficient for extracting informa-
tion from Dutch pathology reports. We show differences in fre-
quencies and combinations of metastatic sites between histological 
subtypes. The patterns and frequencies identified in this autopsy 
study may reflect the underlying biology of metastatic breast can-
cer and potentially influence the future follow-ups and patient-tai-
lored treatment strategies depending on other clinical correlations.

*University Medical Center Hamburg, Germany
Background & objectives: Prognostic markers in routine clinical 
practice of breast cancer are currently assessed using multi-gene 
panels. However, the fluctuating tumour purity can reduce the 
predictive value of such tests. Immunohistochemistry holds the 
potential for a better risk assessment.
Methods: To enable automated prognosis marker detection (i.e. 
HER2, GATA3, progesterone- [PR], oestrogen- [ER], and andro-
gen receptor [AR], TOP2A, Ki-67, TROP2), we have developed 
and validated a framework for automated breast cancer identifica-
tion, which comprises three different artificial intelligence analysis 
steps and an algorithm for cell-distance analysis of 11+1 marker 
BLEACH&STAIN multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry 
(mfIHC) staining in 2’004 breast cancers.
Results: The optimal distance between Myosin+ basal cells and 
benign panCK+ cells was identified as 25 μm and used to exclude 
benign glands from the analysis combined with several deep learn-
ing-based algorithms. Our framework discriminated normal glands 
from malignant glands with an AUC of 0.96. The accuracy of the 
approach was also validated by well-characterized biological find-
ings, such as the identification of 13% HER2+, 73% PR+/ER+, and 
14 triple negative cases. Furthermore, the automated assessment 
of GATA3, PR, ER, TOP2A-LI, Ki-67-LI and TROP2 was signifi-
cantly liked to the tumour grade (p<0.001each). Furthermore, a 
high expression level of HER2, GATA3, PR, and ER was associated 
with a prolonged overall survival (p≥0.002 each).
Conclusion: A deep learning-based framework for automated 
breast cancer identification using BLEACH&STAIN multiplex 
fluorescence IHC facilitates automated prognosis marker quanti-
fication in breast cancer.

*Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Brit-
ish Columbia, Royal Columbian Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada
Background & objectives: The management of benign intraductal 
papillomas (IDPs) diagnosed on core biopsy is controversial. We 
aim to determine the upgrade rate of IDPs diagnosed on core 
biopsy in subsequent surgical excision specimens and to identify 
associated clinical, pathologic, and radiologic factors.
Methods: This is a retrospective population-based study of all breast 
papillary lesions diagnosed on core biopsy from 2017-2019 in Fraser 
Health Authority in Greater Vancouver, Canada. Patient demograph-
ics, histopathologic, and radiologic findings were analysed. Upgrade 
was defined as atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), ductal carcinoma 
in situ (DCIS), encapsulated papillary carcinoma (EPC), solid papil-
lary carcinoma (SPC), and invasive carcinoma on surgical excision.
Results: A total of 129 patients with benign IDPs diagnosed on 
core biopsy were included. The overall upgrade rate to atypia or 
malignancy was 9.3% (12/129) on final excision. This included 7 
with ADH, 7 with DCIS, EPC or SPC, and 1 with invasive carci-
noma. Predictors of upgrade included older age (55.6 vs 66.1 years, 
p < 0.0001) and larger lesion size (11.1 vs 15.1 mm, p = 0.001). 
Older age (≥ 55 years) (OR [95%CI] 5.3 [1.04-27.08]) was an 
independent predictor of upgrade. In our study, location (central vs 
peripheral) and BI-RADS radiologic category were not associated 
with predicting upgrade.
Conclusion: Our findings support surgical excision of IDPs diag-
nosed on core biopsy in women aged 55 years or older with large 
lesions, while a conservative approach (close clinical follow-up) 
may be warranted for younger women with smaller lesions.

*Tata Memorial Centre, Homi Bhabha National Institute, India
Background & objectives: To standardize and validate the HER2 
Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail (D-DISH) assay by VENTANA for 
HER2/neu testing in breast cancer using FISH as the gold standard 
and to assess the interobserver variability in interpreting D-DISH.
Methods: HER2/neu IHC, FISH, and D-DISH assay by HER2 Dual 
ISH DNA Probe Cocktail Assay (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., 
Tucson) were performed on 120 breast carcinoma cases. Sensitiv-
ity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive 
value (NPV), and accuracy were calculated against D-DISH results 
for four pathologists (FISH-gold standard). The absolute agreement 
between FISH and D-DISH ratios, average signals was assessed.
Results: A concordance of 98.3% was observed between FISH and 
D-DISH assays. D-DISH showed a sensitivity of 95.92%, speci-
ficity of 100%, PPV of 100%, and NPV of 97.26%, with respect 
to FISH. Cohen’s kappa statistic was 0.96 demonstrating perfect 
agreement. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values of 0.97 
(HER2), 0.92 (CEP17), and 0.97 (HER2/CEP17) were observed.

(kappa values 0.98-1.0) and ICC values of 0.96-0.98, 0.91-0.95, 
and 0.96-0.98 in measuring the HER2 signals, CEP17 signals, and 
HER2/CEP17 ratio, by D-DISH respectively. Interobserver vari-
ability between the four pathologists showed perfect agreement 
for genomic heterogeneity and group categorization, and moderate 
agreement for polysomy by D-DISH.
Conclusion: Our study successfully validated the D-DISH test 
using the updated version of HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail 
Assay (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ) as a substitute 
for FISH assay in accurately predicting the HER2 gene status with 
significant interobserver reproducibility. We conclude that this 
D-DISH test may be introduced in rouine diagnostic services as a 
reflex test for detecting HER2 gene status.

Aviv, Israel
Background & objectives: Determination of HER2 status is criti-
cal for prognosis and guiding treatment decisions in breast cancer 
patients. Here we present a method to detect HER2 expression 
directly from routinely prepared diagnostic H&E slide images, 
using an image-based deep learning approach.
Methods: A HER2-classifier was generated using 251 H&E-
stained slide images and their relevant IHC and FISH status from 
the pathology department at Sourasky Medical Center. Convolu-
tional neural network (CNN) analysis was performed on on-the-fly 
augmented images. Multiple instance learning (MIL) algorithms 
and ranking training schemes were applied to create the categori-
cal HER2-classifier (positive/negative), powered by Imagene-AI.
Results: The HER2-classifier was evaluated on a validation 
set including H&E images only of 104 retrospective cases. 
The model performance values were 87.5% sensitivity, 85.9% 
specificity, 86.14% accuracy and 0.89 AUC. To further evaluate 
the AI-solution additional 245 cases were analysed. In this set, a 
high proportion (n=9/20; 45%) of false callings was observed in 
samples with HER2 IHC=3. The IHC slides of samples with score 
3 in the set were re-evaluated by two pathologists. While three of 
the 9 false-negative cases (33%) status was changed to 2, by at 
least one pathologist, there were no changes in the true-positive 
group (n=9).
Conclusion: Implementation of Image-based solution to routine 
pathology workflow can support fast, cost-effective and stand-
ardized method for biomarker detection. We evaluated the use of 
an AI-model to analyse HER2 status compared to conventional 
IHC and FISH methods. Analysis of 349 cases resulted in 85.3% 
accuracy. IHC, manually analysed by pathologists, is a subjective 
method with both intra- and inter-observer discordance’s reported. 
An AI-solution can support the routine workflow flagging cases 
where re-evaluation can support the pathologist analysis of dif-
ficult cases.

Moresco, M. Lavitrano
*Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-
Bicocca, Monza, Italy
Background & objectives: The administration of the antihyper-
tensive syrosingopine in combination with metformin provided 
a synergistic effect against different tumours, including breast 
cancer. We aimed to investigate the response to metformin and/or 
syrosingopine, evaluating the [18F]FDG and [18F]FLT as potential 
early prognostic biomarkers.
Methods: Balb/c female mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 
murine TNBC cells (4T1) and divided into six treatment groups: 
vehicle, cisplatinum, metformin, syrosingopine or cisplatinum 
plus metformin and metformin plus syrosingopine. The response 
to treatment was monitored by caliper measuring, for tumour 
volume and PET studies. Molecular biomarkers of glucose 
metabolism and tumour invasiveness were analysed by means of 
immunohistochemistry and q-RT-PCR.
Results: A significant tumour growth inhibition (%TGI) 
has been observed only after metformin plus syrosingopine 
administration, confirming a synergistic effect after ten days 
of treatment. PET analyses revealed a significant reduction 
of [18F]FLT tumour uptake in cisplatinum plus metformin 
(*p<0.05) and metformin plus syrosingopine (*p<0.001) 
treated groups, whereas [18F]FDG uptake increased in all 
experimental conditions. Molecular analyses performed by 
both immunohistochemistry and q-RT-PCR demonstrated a 
significant decrease of the lactate transporter MCT4 levels in 
mice treated with cisplatinum and metformin plus syrosingopine 
(*p<0.05) as well as low levels of the EMT biomarker Snail 
only in the group treated with the combination of metformin 
plus syrosingopine (*p<0.05).
Conclusion: Our data suggested that the combined administration 
of metformin plus syrosingopine is able to modulate the glucose 
metabolism and inhibit the tumour invasiveness and growth of 
cancer cells. Moreover, the use of [18F]FLT radiotracer may 
represent a potential biomarker for the early response to treatment 
of TNBC.

Challenges of breast NEN: NEN G3 and genetic analysis
Y. Liu*, M. Zhao
*The Fourth Hospital, China
Background & objectives: The Breast NEN(Br-NEN)was graded 
according to Nottingham standard, resulting in confusion between 
Br-NENG3 andNETG3. It was unclear whether therapeutic targets 
associated with gastroenteropancreatic NENare applicable in Br-
NEN. This study aims to illustrate these issues.
Methods: The 50 cases were re-diagnosed according to the 
5thWHO classification criteria. The gastroenteropancreatic NEN 
characteristic immunohistological staining (SSTR1-5, DLL3, ISL-
1, INSM-1) were performed, and DNA was isolated from the pri-
mary tumour for exome sequencing. In this study, NET G3 was set 
as Nottingham grade 3, excluding small cell carcinoma and large 
cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.
Results: 1)Compared with G3 and NEC,the MYC pathway was 
enriched in G3, and the TP53 pathway was more common in the 
latter (P=0.036).
2)The G3 had more ZNF703 and FGFR1 genetic mutations than 
NEC, and was more likely to exhibit the genetic characteristics of 
Luminal B.
3)The SSTR2 and INSM1 positive expression was more common in 
the G1-2, P=0.006 vs 0.012, and showed decreasing trend in NEC 
compared with G3. No positive expression of DLL3 was found in 
G3except NEC.
4)The metastasis occurred in 3 cases (6% G3,11% NEC, 4% G1-2) 
and the breast cancer-related deaths occurred in 4 cases(12%

G3,22% NEC). G3 showed poor prognosis than G1-2, but better 
than NEC.
Conclusion: 1)The poorly differentiated group has more frequent 
genetic alterations and poor prognosis.Br-NET G3 show genetic 
alterations and a better prognosis distinct from Br-NEC. Whether 
the Br-NET G3 concept is different from the Br-NEN G3 needs to 
be explored by more data.
2)The expression pattern of SSTR1-5, DLL3, ISl-1 and INSM-1 
in Br-NEN was similar to that in gastroenteropancreatic NEN, so 
based on these biomarkers, it may be necessary to explore the 
potential therapeutic significance in Br-NEN.

Prediction of the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy for breast 
cancer with immunologic and genome characteristics
Y. Liu*, M. Han
*The Fourth Hospital, China
Background & objectives: The effect of different immune cells 
and genomic alterations in tumour microenvironment before 
neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in breast cancer patients on efficacy 
is currently uncertain. This study aimed to explore its impact on 
efficacy of NAT in breast cancer patients.
Methods: 81 cases of breast invasive cancer diagnosed by core 
needle biopsy before NAT were selected. Multiple Immunohis-
tochemical/Immunofluorescence (mIHC/IF) detected CD3, CD8, 
PD-L1 and PD-1. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology 
analysed the genome and detect somatic cell variation. Logistic 
regression analysis was used to draw a nomogram to predict the 
pCR rate of breast cancer patients.
Results: Patients were divided into two groups by NAT efficacy: 
pCR and non-pCR. The mIHC/IF results showed expression level 
of stromaCD8+cells, parenchyma and stroma PD-L1+cells in pCR 
was higher, with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05).NGS 
testing results showed the highest mutation rate was TP53(81%), 
followed by ERBB2(49%), PIK3CA(47%), CDK12(46%) and 
LRP1B (8%), et al. The mutation types include missense mutation, 
copy number amplification, synonymous mutation, et al. Only 
the difference in LRP1B mutation rate between two groups was 
statistically significant (P=0.011).Cox regression analysis showed 
expression level of stromal CD8+ cells, stromal and parenchymal 
PD-L1+ cells and LRP1B mutation rate influenced pCR (P < 
0.05). The calibration chart(AUC:0.78) showed that the nomogram 
performs well and has high pCR predictionability.
Conclusion: There is a difference in immune microenvironment 
and gene expression profiles between pCR and non pCR patients. 
And the expression levels of CD8 + cells in tumour stroma, 
PD-L1+ cells in tumour parenchyma and tumour stroma are high, 
and LRP1B gene is prone to mutationin pCR patients. The nom-
ogram of predicting pCR rate has good consistency, which can 
provide a certain predictive value for breast cancer patients with 
neoadjuvant therapy.

Histological assessment of large fresh breast surgical speci-
mens with ultra-fast slide-free confocal microscopy: a feasibil-
ity study

M. Nap, A. Ben Lakhdar, N. Labaied, A. Conversano, M. Abbaci
*Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, France
Background & objectives: A new generation of ultra-fast confo-
cal microscope (UFCM) with a large field of view allows ex-vivo 
analysis of surgical specimens. We present the standardization of 
UFCM protocol for breast lumpectomy and the original online 
training program in breast UFCM images.
Methods: Fresh lumpectomies from 55 patients with breast 
conservative surgery were cut in two, stained with acridine 
and imaged with Histolog-Scanner-field of view of 20 cm² 
(Samantree Medical). The images were colored in purple to simu-
late frozen sections and annotated by three pathologists expert 
in breast and confocal pathology. The images were used for a 
training program followed by two pathologists.
Results: All surgical specimens were successfully imaged. Among 
these 55 cases, 49 were carcinomas (31 invasive no special type, 
11 invasive lobular, 7 ductal carcinoma in situ) and in 6 cases 
no tumour was present at definitive histological examination. The 
UFCM protocol was completed in 8-10mn. The global architecture 
of the tissue was evaluated at low magnification and the cellular 
details at zoom (x40). The 30μm of axial resolution resulted 
hypercellularity compared to final histology. Training program 
was composed of 135 reading sheets including tumoural and 
non-tumoural features. Pathologists who completed the training 
program performed a diagnosis on the 88 self-assessment sheets 
getting 100% accuracy.
Conclusion: UFCM allowed to quickly image a 20 cm² area of an 
entire section of fresh breast lumpectomy. The training of patholo-
gists in reading UFCM images was successful, probably since the 
images resemble traditional frozen sections. However a training is 
mandatory because the magnification of the images is lower than 
with microscope and the optical section is 30 μm thick. The pilot 
study points the feasibility of UFCM for fast and extensive intra-
operative margin assessment during breast surgery.

PIK3CA mutations in endocrine-resistant breast cancer
C. Schagerholm*, S. Robertson, B. Holm, H. Awier, H. Toosi, E. 
Sifakis, J. Hartman
*Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, 
Sweden
Background & objectives: The majority of breast cancer patients’ 
tumours express oestrogen receptor alpha (ER) but despite endo-
crine therapy, one-third progress or relapse. Studies investigate the 
phosphoinositide-3-kinase pathway, introducing therapies targeting 
PIK3CA. This study aims to examine the mutational prevalence in 
endocrine-resistant tumours.
Methods: In a retrospectively collected cohort of verified 
endocrine-resistant breast tumours diagnosed in 2008-2012, 
primary ER+ and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2) negative breast cancers with an ER+/HER2- relapse during 
ongoing endocrine therapy were included. Targeted gene panel 
sequencing was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 
tumour tissue and paired analysis was carried out between the 
relapse and primary tumours.
Results: The overall preliminary analysis showed PIK3CA muta-
tions in 48.9% of all patients (n/N=23/47), of which 65.2% (n=15) 
had mutations in the 11 known hotspot regions. 65.2% of the muta-
tions were similar between the primary and relapse tumours, 73.3% 
of these were found in hotspots, whilst 34.8% seem to develop or 
disappear during ongoing endocrine therapy. In primary tumours of 
patients that eventually relapsed during endocrine therapy, 60.9% 
had mutations in hotspots and 30.4% outside of these regions. In 
their relapse tumours, 56.5% had hotspot mutations and 26.1% 
elsewhere.
Conclusion: Our study of this unique cohort suggests that endo-
crine-resistant breast cancers are associated with high PIK3CA

mutation frequencies, with significant proportions occurring out-
side of the known hotspot regions; analysis is ongoing for prognos-
tic value combined with clinical data. Similar mutational profiles 
of primary and relapse tumours suggest invariability through treat-
ment and may thus aid in utilizing diagnostic tools for therapeutic 
response prediction. Moreover, similar and alternating mutations of 
the tumours can be further investigated for incorporation of future 
mutation-targeted treatments.
Funding: This trial is a non-interventional study set up as a 
research collaboration between Karolinska Institutet and Novartis 
Sweden AB.

Breast carcinoma with apocrine differentiation: less indolent 
than expected?

*Unit of Anatomic Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, 
Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, 
Italy
Background & objectives: Breast carcinoma with apocrine 
differentiation is a rare (1%) breast cancer histotype characterized 
by apocrine morphology in >90% of cells, that typically shows 
positivity for androgen receptor (AR) and it’s either triple-negative 
or HER2-positive, non luminal.
Methods: At our Institution, 37 patients were diagnosed with 
breast carcinoma with apocrine differentiation between January 
2010 and December 2020. Data about patient’s age, and tumour 
histological grade, ER, PR, Ki-67, AR and HER2 status and TNM 
staging was obtained from pathological report. Of note, no patient 
had undergone neoadjuvant therapy.
Results: Of our 37 cases, 25 were classified as high grade, and 
11 as low or intermediate grade according to the Nottingham His-
tologic Score. The high grade group comprised slightly younger 
patients (median age: 69 vs 71,5) and showed a statistically sig-
nificant prevalence of HER2-amplified tumours (14/25 vs 1/12, 
p=0.0106) and a higher Ki-67 average score (28% vs 13% in the 
low and intermediate grade tumours); no difference was observed 
in loco-regional stage of the tumour (average primary tumour 
dimension: 22,7 mm vs 18,1 mm; cases with positive lymph nodes: 
11/25 vs 6/12).
Conclusion: Despite being regarded as an histotype with a more 
indolent course, our data shows that even lower grade apocrine car-
cinoma has a high propensity for loco-regional spread, and should 
be managed accordingly; the net difference in prevalence of HER2 
amplification between low and high grade tumours suggests that 
different, unknown molecular events underlie disease progression 
in the two groups, and warrants further studies to define the biol-
ogy of this histotype.

Claudin-1 expression in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) 
and its clinical significance
A. Ouban*
*Alfaisal University College of Med, Saudi Arabia
Background & objectives: TNBC is an aggressive disease, lacking 
therapeutic and prognostic markers. Claudin-1, a biomarker with 
a prognostic value in several tumours, reportedly has conflicting 
results in TNBCs. The authors shed some light on claudin-1 expres-
sion in TNBC and its value.
Methods: We analysed the expression of claudin-1, a tight-junction 
protein that has a promising prognostic value in several cancers, 
by immunohistochemistry, in TNBC cases from the King Khaled 
university hospital. This expression was cross-checked against 
clinical-pathological criteria of TNBC patients, and against beta-
Catenin expression in the same patients’ sample.
Results: Claudin-1 was significantly expressed in the majority 
of TNBC cases. This expression was significantly correlated 
with lymph node metastases, tumour invasion, higher tumour 
nuclear grade, higher clinical and TNM staging, adverse survival 
outcome and failure to achieve remission following neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy (NAC). TNBCs’ claudin-1 expression was also 
correlated with grade-2 abnormal expression of beta-Catenin 
(AEB) in the same patients’ sample.
Conclusion: Most cases of TNBCs in our institution expressed the 
claudin-1. This expression is strongly linked to parameters of poor 
prognosis. The above may shed some light on the possible role of 
claudin-1 in TNBC; and may present an opportunity for the use of 
this biomarker in the management of TNBC patients.

Filamin-A expression in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) 
and its clinical significance
A. Ouban*
*Alfaisal University College of Med, Saudi Arabia
Background & objectives: TNBC presents a clinical dilemma with 
early recurrence, metastases and poor survival outcome. Filamin-A 
is recently discovered protein which plays a dual role as oncogene 
and tumour-suppressor gene in many cancers. This study analyzes 
the expression of Filamin-A in TNBCs.
Methods: This study analysed the expression of Filamin-A, 
using immunohistochemistry, in a tissue microarray of 50 cases 
of triple-negative, invasive ductal breast carcinomas. Filamin-A 
expression was cross-checked against clinic-pathological attributes 
of the TNBC cases including age, grade, clinical stage and TNM 
staging. Filamin-A expression within the cell was analysed. The 
TNBC cases were further categorized by the intensity of Filamin-
A expression.
Results: A significant majority of this study’s TNBCs exhibited 
positive expression of Filamin-A. All Filamin-A positive TNBC 
cases expressed the protein in the cytoplasm of the tumour cells. 
Filamin-A expression was significantly correlated with TNBC 
grade, clinical stage, and TNM staging. A significant majority of 
TNBC cases had the highest intensity of Filamin-A expression 
(35/45, IRS=12). This study is the first to analyse expression of 
Filamin-A only in TNBC cases. When compared with other studies 
which analysed this expression in breast cancer sets (mixed sets); it 
was noted that the number of Filamin-A positive cases were much 
higher in this study’s TNBC set.
Conclusion: Given the versatile role of Filamin-A, with its numer-
ous interactions with cytoskeleton components of tumour cells and 
with signalling proteins, in addition to its role in modulating sen-
sitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent Docetaxel, make the results 
of this study particularly important in TNBC patients, who have 
few management options. This study provides evidence of the clini-
cal significance of Filamin-A in TNBCs, and proposes additional 
studies to pinpoint the exact function of this protein in this subset 
of breast cancer patients.

*Department of Pathology, Gustave Roussy, France
Background & objectives: In situ hybridization (ISH) is system-
atically performed for HER2 2+ invasive breast cancer. Nullisomy 
is a rare genomic event that may mislead the pathologist in ISH 
interpretation. We aimed at describe the pathological and molecu-
lar features of three nullisomy cases
Methods: Three cases of cen17 nullisomy breast cancer (BC) were 
retrieved from our archives. Clinical, pathological and treatment 
data were collected for each case. HER2 immunohistochemistry 
and HER2/cen17 fluorescent ISH were scored following the last 
ASCO/CAP guidelines. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded samples and subjected to SNP array (Oncos-
canTM). A Foundation One liquid CDx analysis was available for 
one patient.
Results: All patients presented with metastatic BC, two of 
them from the outset. All tumours were high grade, oestrogen 
receptor positive. HER2 score was 2+ (n=2), or 3+ heterogeneous 
(n=1). All cases showed no signal in tumour cells with cen17 
probe, whilst a signal was observed in normal cells. Two cases 
were HER2 amplified (HER2=7.9 and 9). All cases displayed a 
complex genomic profile with homozygous loss of the chromosome 
17 centromeric region, associated to multiple quantitative 
chromosomic alterations. All cases showed chromosome 8q gain 
involving CCNE2 and MYC genes. Liquid biopsy sequencing of 
the lobular case additionally identified ESR1, PIK3CA, CDH1, 
DNMT3A, FAM123B, PTPN11 and TP53 mutations.
Conclusion: Nullisomy of chromosome 17 centromeric region is 
a poorly known genomic event that may prove puzzling for the 
pathologist while reading HER2 ISH in invasive BC. Our study 
shows that this exceedingly rare alteration is associated to BC 
showing a strikingly aggressive clinical course, and displaying a 
consistent complex genomic profile.

Epidermolysis bullosa: an electron microscopy study of 6 
cases
A. Cohn*, C. Salavastru, M. Gherghiceanu
*Emergency University Hospital, Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a 
group of rare inherited disorders characterized by skin fragility 
and blistering after minor trauma. This study presents the ultra-
structural features of six cases of EB, highlighting the diagnostic 
role of transmission electron microscopy (EM).
Methods: Skin biopsies from six infants were processed for both 
light microscopy (LM) and EM. Five of six patients were younger 
than 1 month. Clinical presentation included skin fragility and 
blisters in all cases. Oral mucosa involvement was reported in 
one case. LM revealed a completely detached epidermis in all 
cases of dystrophic EB.
Results: EB cases were classified based on the split level as EB 
simplex (EBS), junctional EB (JEB), and dystrophic EB. One case 
showed intraepidermal cleavage, intrakeratinocyte splitting, and 
tonofilament clumps suggesting generalized severe EBS.
EM findings of JEB were found in one case. These included mul-
tiple microsplits through the lamina lucida and a reduced number 
of anchoring filaments into the lamina densa.
Ultrastructural features of both EBS and JEB were found in one 
case, revealing intra-lamina lucida splits, suprabasal cleavage, and 
intracytoplasmic fractures.
All three cases of dystrophic EB showed a split below the lamina 
densa, with absent or markedly reduced anchoring fibrils between 
the lamina densa and collagen bundles.
Conclusion: Even though TEM tends to be replaced by immunola-
beling and genetic testing, ultrastructural studies are still relevant 
in the diagnosis of EB. Not only can EM establish the major type 
of EB by identifying the level of the split in the skin, but also it can 
provide critical prognostic information in several subtypes. Moreo-
ver, EM can detect subtle changes in the dermo-epidermal junction 
and was proven to be superior in diagnosing EBS in absence of 
evident blisters.

Clinico-pathologic correlation in cardiac amyloidosis: is there 
a substrate for the echocardiographic “relative apical spar-
ing” sign?

Della Barbera, D. Mele, C. Basso, A. Cipriani
*Cardiovascular Pathology Unit, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic, 
Vascular Sciences and Public Health, University of Padua - 
Azienda Ospedaliera, Padova, Italy
Background & objectives: Myocardial longitudinal strain (LS) 
and strain rate by speckle-tracking echocardiography play a 
prognostic role in cardiac amyloidosis (CA) and relative apical 
sparing of LS (RELAPS) is useful for early diagnosis. Our aim was 
to assess regional differences in amyloid burden.
Methods: Retrospective study of whole hearts from autopsy 
with histological evidence and immunoelectron microscopy 
typing of CA. Amyloid burden was assessed quantitatively by 
histomorphometry on sodium sulphate-Alcian Blue stained 
transmural slides at different levels from base to apex. The 
parameters of myocardial LS by echocardiography performed 
before death were compared to the amyloid burden and basal-to-
apex distribution.
Results: Of the 29 hearts examined, amyloid typing identified 19 
cases of immunoglobulin light chains (AL, 65.5%) and 10 tran-
sthyretin (ATTR, 34.5%). A prevalent interstitial deposition was 
found in 20 (69%) and vascular in 9 (31%). Among the latter, all 
but one (88.9%) were AL. A homogeneous distribution of amy-
loid was demonstrated, with a median of 25.38, 26.70 and 18.8 
(P=NS) at the basal, mid and apical sections, respectively. In 11 
patients, echocardiography during the same hospitalization showed 
a significant LS basal-to-apex gradient. A correlation was found 
between total histological amyloid burden and the reduction of 
LS at echocardiography, although the RELAPS didn’t match to a 
basal-to-apex gradient of amyloid.
Conclusion: This clinico-pathological study demonstrates that 
amyloid is evenly distributed in the ventricular myocardium both in 
AL and ATTR. While there is a correlation between total amyloid 
burden and reduction of LS, the typical basal-to-apex gradient 
in LS at echocardiography does not appear to be explained by a 
gradient of amyloid burden in whole hearts. Our findings thus 
suggest that RELAPS is an epiphenomenon of complex interactions 
among amyloid infiltration, myocardial structure and consequent 
adaptation.

Bologna, Italy
Background & objectives: Acute Myocarditis (AM) has been 
much discussed as one of the most frequent cardiac complications 
of COVID-19. Despite serious clinical suspicion, however, there 
is no substantial EMB histological series.
Methods: At the S.Orsola Bologna Centre, cardiologic referral 
Centre for Emilia-Romagna region, we retrospectively analysed and 
compared two groups of patients who underwent EMB for clinical 
suspicion of myocarditis in the 5 years pre-pandemic (2015-2019, 
Group 1) and in the initial 15 months of the pandemic (April 2020-
June 2021, Group 2), before the vaccine became generally available 
in our region.
Results: In group 1, of 65 patients who underwent EMB, 31 
(47.7%) had a histological diagnosis of AM, with histotype: 
lymphocytic in 24 cases, giant cell in 1, toxic in 1, mixed in 1. 
Extension of inflammation was focal in 19 and multifocal/diffuse 
in 12. Month ratio in suspected cases was 1.1; in histological 
confirmed cases 0.5.
In group 2, of 23 patients 13 had EMB positive for AM (56.5%), 
with histotype: lymphocytic in 8 cases, giant cell in 1, eosinophilic 
in 2, mixed in 2. Extension of inflammation: was focal in 7 and 
multifocal/diffuse in 6. Month ratio in suspected cases was 1.5, in 
histological confirmed AM, 0.9.
Conclusion: In this study we analysed the frequency, clinical 
presentation and histological parameters of suspected AM before 
and during the pandemic. During the pandemic there was an 
increase in number of cases, in terms of both clinical suspicion 
and of histologic confirmation at EMB. The cases were generally 
more severe and showed a different range of histotypes, but there 
was no real correlation with SARS-CoV-2.

From conventional congenital cardiac surgery to molecular car-
diac surgery: between darkness and light. New paradigms for 
investigations and treatments during pregnancy
A. Capuani*
*Private Organization Carrara, Italy
Background & objectives: We advocate new biological models 
and protocols for investigation and treatment of severe CHD on the 
light of nowadays spectacular progresses of the Molecular Biology 
with the Next Generation Sequency (NGS), Microarray Technolo-
gies and CRISPR-Cass9 Technique.
Methods: We reconsidered the embryogenesis and the morphol-
ogy of the most severe forms of CHD, from TF to Transpositions 
and Univentricular Hearts, considering the diagnostic potentiality 
of maternal liquid biopsies in pregnancy and with emphasis on the 
CHD embryogenetic patterns. (Capuani et al. Ann Thorac Surg 
1995, J Cardiothorac Surg 2014, Virchow’s Archives 2015, 2016, 
2020).
Results: We found a common morphological denominator encom-
passing all pathological cardiac settings: the Trabecula Septomar-
ginalis (Leonardo’s Cord) sequential counterclockwise malrota-
tion. Several genes are involved in the process with over and under 
expression and network interactions. Microarray and NGS analysis 
applied early in pregnancy and to each single step of the malrota-
tion may lead to a very early diagnosis and possible treatments. We 
present our research protocol.
Conclusion: Each malformed cardiac phenotype has a specific 
molecular profile. The TSM malrotation protocol encompass all 
cardiac pathological phenotypes and is proposed as a model for 
investigation and treatment of CHD early in pregnancy by NGS, 
Microarray and CRISPR-Cass9 technique, what we refer as Molec-
ular Cardiac Surgery.

Reporting guidelines for pathology AI research – a review
C. Mcgenity*, D. Treanor
*Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: An explosion of interest into 
applications of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming pathology 
research. Complete reporting of research is essential for avoiding 
research waste and benefitting patients. The objective of this work 
was identifying reporting guidelines for pathology AI research.
Methods: The Equator Network library of 499 reporting guidelines 
and extensions was systematically searched to identify those 
applicable to pathology AI research. Inclusion and exclusion 
criteria were used and guidance was screened for utility at different 
stages of research and for a range of study types. Items were 
compiled to create a summary for easy identification of useful 
guidance and templates.
Results: 70 reporting guidelines and extensions applicable to stages 
of pathology AI research were identified. These were categorised 
into 5 groups: Literature & Research Priorities, Discovery, Clinical 
Trial, Implementation and Post-Implementation & Guidelines. A 
summary resource was developed for pathology AI researchers, 
with links to guidelines for these 5 groups, to assist in complete 
reporting of research. Guidelines currently in development and 
those useful at multiple stages of research were also highlighted. 
Our group recently published a study demonstrating that essential 
information is underreported in pathology AI studies, making 
replication difficult. Therefore, this summary will be shared 
publicly to highlight the availability of reporting guidance to the 
pathology AI research community.
Conclusion: Replication and research waste are recognised to be 
problematic in AI research. Reporting guidelines can be used as 
templates to ensure the essential information needed to replicate 
research is included within journal articles and abstracts. Reporting 
guidelines are available and useful for many study types, but 
greater awareness is needed to encourage researchers to utilise 
them and for journals to adopt them. This review and summary 
resource highlights guidance to pathology AI researchers, aiming 
to improve completeness of reporting.

A holistic evaluation of three-dimensional biomarker expres-
sion and genetic alterations in non-small cell lung cancer using 
tissue clearing technology
L. Wang*, Y. Hsieh, Y. Hung, Y. Chen, Y. Lin, Y. Lin, T. Chou
*Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan
Background & objectives: The common practice of assessing 
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression based on a single 
section may not be representative. To overcome this problem, we 
developed a novel protocol that can make formalin-fixed, paraf-
fin-embedded tissue translucent, allowing three-dimensional (3D) 
imaging.

Methods: Our protocol can process tissues up to 150-μm in thick-
ness, allowing anti-PD-L1 staining of the entire tissue and pro-
ducing high resolution 3D images. After 3D imaging process, the 
thick sections were recovered for epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) mutation analysis. We further developed artificial intel-
ligence-assisted models to calculate the tumour proportion score 
(TPS) of the entire 3D tissue.
Results: Artificial intelligence-assisted PD-L1 quantitation of 
these images revealed a marked variation of PD-L1 expression in 
3D. In 5 of 33 needle-biopsy-sized specimens (15.2%), the TPS 
varied by greater than 10% at different depth levels. In 14 cases 
(42.4%), the TPS at different depth levels fell into different cat-
egories (<1%, 1–49%, or ≥50%), which can potentially influence 
treatment decisions. The EGFR mutation analysis performed using 
pre- and post-processing tissue yielded identical results in all the 
tested cases, including 4 cases with EGFR L858R mutation, 6 cases 
with EGFR exon 19 deletion, 1 case with EGFR exon 20 insertion, 
1 case with EGFR G719X mutation, and 8 cases without detectable 
EGFR mutation.
Conclusion: Our novel method has the potential to increase the 
accuracy of tumour PD-L1 expression assessment and enable 
precise deployment of cancer immunotherapy. In addition to 
application in PD-L1 expression assessment in non-small cell 
lung cancer, 3D tissue imaging can also potentially apply to the 
evaluation of biomarkers in other cancer types. Importantly, our 
technology permits recovery of the processed tissue for subsequent 
mutation analysis, enabling holistic evaluation of the protein-level 
expression and genetic alterations in small specimens.

CoNIC Challenge: large scale assessment of automated methods 
for identification and counting of Colon Nuclei
S. Graham*, Q.D. Vu, M. Jahanifar, D. Snead, S. Raza, F. Minhas, 
N. Rajpoot
*University of Warwick, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Identification of nuclei in histology 
images, such as those from epithelial and inflammatory cells, 
enables large-scale profiling of the tumour microenvironment. To 
help drive forward innovation for automatic nuclear recognition, we 
organised the Colon Nuclei Identification and Counting (CoNIC) 
Challenge.
Methods: We created the largest dataset for nuclear recognition in 
computational pathology, containing around 550K labelled nuclei, 
and invited researchers to develop algorithms on the data, aimed 
at solving 2 tasks: 1) nuclear segmentation & classification and 2) 
prediction of cellular composition. Participants submitted model 
code to the challenge, which enabled the test data to remain com-
pletely unseen.
Results: In total, we had 323 and 50 submissions to the prelimi-
nary and full test phases, respectively. Submissions were ranked by 
multi-class panoptic quality (mPQ+) and multi-class coefficient of 
determination (R2) for tasks 1 and 2, respectively. The top segmen-
tation and classification submission achieved an mPQ+ of 0.501 
and the top cellular composition prediction submission achieved an 
R2 of 0.764. Best models were able to successfully identify under-
represented classes, such as neutrophils, eosinophils and plasma 
cells, helping them to achieve competitive mPQ+ and R2 scores.
Conclusion: Nuclear morphology and co-localisation of different 
subtypes have shown to be important indicators of cancer prognosis 
and diagnosis. However, manual assessment is not feasible as each 
tissue sample typically contains thousands of nuclei. We organised 
the CoNIC Challenge to encourage the development of automatic 
approaches for nuclear recognition in computational pathology. 
We hope that the widespread participation will motivate research-
ers to further develop methods on the provided data and acceler-
ate the development of downstream cell-based models for clinical 
applications.

ing modalities

*Department of Medical Imaging, Radboud UMC, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Radiomics based on clinical imaging 
are increasingly applied to classify tumours, but often lack sufficient 
biological rationale, hampering clinical implementation. We developed 
an [18F]FDG-PET/CT signature in pancreatic cancer based on 
MCT4-expression, quantified by texture analyses of whole tumour 
cross-sections.
Methods: We developed a cross-modal image analyses pipeline 
using a cohort of pancreatic cancer patients (n=29) of which 
tumour cross-sections and PET-scans were available. We computed 
density maps of MCT4-expression on whole-slide images to extract 
texture features. Using k-means, we defined two subgroups with 
distinct MCT4-expression patterns. From corresponding [18F]
FDG-PET scans, texture features were selected that associate with 
the pre-defined subgroups.
Results: Clustering techniques, based on k-means, umap and 
heatmap analyses, revealed two distinct MCT4-expression patterns. 
MCT4-expression pattern A was dominated by a higher MCT4-
expression level and more local variation. MCT4-expression 
pattern B was characterized by less MCT4-expression. Using 
MCT4-expression patterns as label, we investigated which [18F]
FDG-PET derived texture features associate with these tumour 
characteristics. MCT4-expression pattern A was linked to a specific 
[18F]FDG-PET signature, characterized by higher tracer uptake 
values and second order features correlated to local variation of 
tracer uptake on the corresponding clinical scans. The MCT4-based 
[18F]FDG-PET signatures were applied to an additional cohort 
(n=71) pancreatic cancer patients who received palliative systemic 
treatment and showed prognostic value.
Conclusion: The presented cross-modal image analyses pipeline 
allows to build PET-scan signatures based on a biological ration-
ale using quantitative immunohistochemistry. As use-case we 
focussed on tumour glycolysis as hallmark of cancer, measured by 
MCT4-expression patterns on resected whole tumour sections and 
by [18F]FDG-PET scans. We show that a subgroup of pancreatic 
cancer patients with high and heterogenous MCT4-expression can 
accurately be identified in vivo using [18F]FDG PET-derived tex-
ture features. This MCT4-based [18F]FDG-PET-signature associ-
ated with worse prognosis.

Artificial intelligence as a potential tool for pathologists to 
evaluate lymphocyte infiltration in melanoma

eveste, S. Martín Algarra, M.D. Lozano Escario, C.E. de Andrea*
*Clínica Universidad de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: Melanoma is one of the most frequent 
types of skin cancer, as well as one of the most aggressive, com-
monly known for having very poor survival outcomes.
Methods: Although lymphocyte presence in a tumour has been 
described as important, there is no standardization of the criteria 
pertaining to its analysis; it is highly subjective and dependent on 
the individual looking at the sample. Therefore, an annotation-free 
artificial intelligence technique, called NaroNet, was developed 
to identify melanoma cells and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes 
objectively.
Results: It was then applied to samples in order to explore the 
differences between biopsies at their baseline and at progression. 
As NaroNet’s parameters determine the scope of tissue pattern 
learning, they were optimized to identify both cell types. Patch 
analysis approach (70x70 pixels) was used on 22-paired samples 
to detect cells of different morphologies and determine their 
distribution pattern. Each patch could hold one large melanoma 
cell and up to nine lymphocytes, which allowed the algorithm to 
discover interactions within their environment. NaroNet predicted 
baseline from progression with a 95.45% accuracy using phenotype 
abundances. T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding of each 
phenotype showed high confidence when identifying cell types.
Conclusion: Biopsies at progression had little to no brisk 
infiltration of the tumour, which was significantly different 
(p=0.03) from baseline samples. NaroNet can be trained to detect 
cell types without manual annotations, and used to identify 
important patterns of cell interactions in melanoma that could 
differentiate samples at baseline and progression. With further 
development, the algorithm could be optimized to become a useful 
tool for pathologists.

Artificial intelligence-guided spatial transcriptomics in high 
grade serous carcinoma: toward image-analysis based precision 
oncology
A. Laury*, S. Zheng, O. Youssef, J. Tang, O. Carpen
*University of Helsinki, Research Program in Systems Oncology, 
Finland
Background & objectives: H&E images of high-grade serous 
ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) may contain prognostic information 
detectable only by artificial intelligence (AI). We hypothesise that 
AI can pinpoint regions with prognostic value, and the biology of 
these regions can be revealed with spatial transcriptomics.
Methods: The cohort included 55 stage III-IV patients with distinct 
platinum-free intervals (PFI) (<6 vs >18 months). A deep learning 
neural network tool identified tumour regions most indicative of out-
come. These high-confidence (HC) and background regions were 
probed with 10x Visium for FFPE spatial transcriptomics technology. 
Output was visualized with 10x Loupe browser and analysed using the 
R package Seurat.
Results: The neural network was first trained to identify tumour 
tissue, then to classify the tumour into short or long PFI group. 
Using a HC mask, regions indicative of outcome were identified. 
These HC regions were then used to train the final neural network. 
Testing a combined inference pipeline to classify an independent 
tumour set showed high sensitivity (73%) and specificity (91%). 
UMAP visualization of the spatial transcriptomics demonstrated 
that while data from the same patient are close to each other, HC 
and background regions are mostly distinct within the cluster for 
each patient. Transcriptomics profiles from HC regions predicted 
PFI group status significantly better than background regions.
Conclusion: Artificial intelligence-based image-analysis (AI-IA) of HGSC 
tissue can identify morphologic patterns invisible for human eye and guide 
selection of biologically meaningful regions for spatial transcriptomics. 
When combined, these novel technologies identified several signalling 
pathways and transcripts separating HGSC tumours with short vs. long PFI. 
In conclusion, AI-IA together with spatial transcriptomics offers a promis-
ing toolkit to identify biological features associated with cancer behaviour, 
making the AI-based diagnosis more interpretable and clinically relevant.

Development of trial quality assurance program for digital 
pathology of the Korean Society of Pathologists
Y. Chong*, J.M. Bae, D. Kang, K.I. Kim, H.S. Han
*The Catholic University of Korea, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Digital pathology (DP) can 
fundamentally change the way of working in pathology. Since the 
Korean Society of Pathologists (KSP) published the consensus 
recommendation paper for DP application recently, the need for 
quality assurance program (QAP) for DP has been raised.
Methods: To provide standard baseline reference for internal 
and external QAP for DP, the Committee of Quality Assurance 
of KSP developed a checklist for DP QAP and started a trial QAP 
in 2021. After several revisions, the checklist was finalized. Five 
leading institutes participated the trial QAP in the first year and we 
gathered feedback from these institutes afterwards.
Results: The newly developed checklists of QAP for DP contains 
a total of 39 items (212 score) to check, 8 items for quality control 
of DP systems, 3 items for DP personnel, 9 items for hardware and 
software requirement for DP systems, 15 items for validation, opera-
tion, and management of DP systems, and 4 items for data security 
and personal information protection. Full text in both Korean and 
English is attached as appendices. Most participant institutes in the 
trial QAP replied that continuous education on unfamiliar terminol-
ogy of new technology and more practical experience is demanding.
Conclusion: QAP for DP is essential for the safe implementation of 
DP in pathologic practice. Each laboratory should prepare institu-
tional QAP according to this checklist and consecutive revision of the 
checklist with the feedback from trial QAP for DP needs to follow.

Detecting premalignant lesions in the Fallopian tube, using a 
deep-learning model. A pilot study

*Radboud University Medical Centre, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Serous Tubal Intraepithelial Carcinoma 
(STIC) is a precursor lesion to High Grade Serous Carcinoma (HGSC). 
Interobserver variability in STIC diagnosis is high. We aim to develop 
an Artificial Intelligence model that can detect STIC in digitalized 
whole slide images.
Methods: We collected, digitalized and annotated 91 cases of STIC/
STIL and 75 control cases. Diagnosis was confirmed using p53 and 
Ki-67 immunohistochemical stains, when available. The cases were

split into 71 training cases and 20 test cases. A two-step deep-learning 
algorithm was trained: first all epithelium was detected, and next aber-
rant epithelium was distinguished from normal epithelium.
Results: The two-step model approach reached an area under the 
receiver operating curve of 0.946 on slide level. Visual inspection 
confirms adequate detection of the aberrant epithelium, in concord-
ance with morphology and immunohistochemistry.
Conclusion: We present a deep-learning algorithm that can 
successfully detect STIC. Adequate STIC diagnosis is important 
to better understand the oncogenesis of HGSC, holds prognostic 
implications for individual patients, and is a prerequisite to safely 
offer alternative risk reducing surgeries, such as salpingectomy 
with delayed oophorectomy, currently studied in prospective 
international trials. We believe an AI model has the potential to 
aid the pathologist in this challenging diagnosis. Expanding the 
dataset is expected to aid further development of this model.

Eyeballing and hot-spot counting of ki67 may misguide 
therapy in invasive breast carcinoma, NST and the quick fix 
is automated counting
S. Sevim*, E. Dicle Serbes, G. Ozdogan, S. Dizbay Sak
*Ankara University Medical School, Pathology Department, 
Turkey
Background & objectives: Ki67 evaluation is essential in inva-
sive breast carcinomas. This can be a very laborious process for 
pathologists. In this study, we aimed to compare Ki67 scores by 
a.)eyeballing, b.)manual-counting (MC), and c.)using an artificial 
intelligence based automated counting program (AIACP).
Methods: For 54 cases, three regions of interests (ROIs) (1 hot-
spot and 2 reflecting the first impression), each of 0.2 mm2, were 
selected on Ki67 (SP6) stained whole digital sections. These ROIs 
were counted manually and by AIACP (3D-HISTECH, Panoramic 
P250 Flash3, VPS3.0.2., Quant Center). Blinded to these countings, 
three independent observers determined Ki67 scores for the same 
cases, by eyeballing.
Results:
Conclusion: In this study, our findings of high agreement between 
AIACP and time-consuming MC shows that a standardized 
automated Ki67 scoring tool is very beneficial. It should also be 
stressed that, although interclass agreement between eyeballing 
and other methods seems acceptable, when Ki67 scores are 
grouped categorically based on International Ki67 in Breast 
Cancer Working Group 2021 Consensus, concordance was only 
moderate. Eyeballing and hotspot-only counting should not be used 
to determine Ki67 scores, which are critical in determining therapy 
options.

*Maccabi Healthcare Services, Israel
Background & objectives: This study aimed to clinically validate 
the use of an AI-based solution by pathologists for reviewing and 
reporting breast core needle biopsies as compared with the gold 
standard practice, review on the microscope.
Methods: A two-arm prospective reader study comparing the per-
formance of pathologists using an AI-based solution with pathol-
ogists using a microscope was performed at two sites (different 
staining and scanners). Both arms were compared to ground truth 
(GT) established by consensus of two breast pathologists. Rates of 
major discrepancies between each arm and GT, as determined by 
an adjudicating pathologist, were compared.
Results: Eight pathologists participated in the study and 
reported on 385 cases (442 HES and 330 H&E slides), 
each case being reported twice, once in each study arm. 
Pathologists first reviewed only H&E/HES slides, if requested 
and available, they were provided with IHCs, while the AI 
results were on H&E/HES only. The major discrepancy 
rates of the microscope arm and of the AI arm against GT 
were 4.42% and 3.12%, respectively, demonstrating 29.4% 
reduction in major discrepancies. Pathologists with AI 
demonstrated very high accuracy for the detection of invasive 
carcinoma with sensitivity and specificity of 100% for both, 
as well as for DCIS/ADH with sensitivity of 92.4% and 
specificity of 97.8%.
Conclusion: This multi-site reader study reports diagnostic 
accuracy improvements by pathologists performing diagnosis and 
reporting with the support of a first read AI solution for breast 
biopsies. The AI solution performed accurately and generalized 
well for different staining platforms and different scanners. 
Thus, AI solutions could be used as significant aiding tools for 
pathologists in clinical decision-making in routine pathology 
practice, enhancing the quality and reproducibility of diagnosis.

*University of Warwick, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Ki67 proliferation-index (PI) has been 
identified as a valuable prognostic marker in prostate cancer. How-
ever, manual scoring is laborious and highly subjective. We explore 
the association of our digital Ki67 score with high-grade prostate 
cancer disease and presence of metastasis.
Methods: Diagnostic paraffin-embedded needle core biopsies were 
stained for Ki67 using MIB-1 antibody (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, 
USA). Manual scoring used the unweighted global assessment 
method. Digital scores were calculated using our deep learning 
method. Scores were correlated with Gleason score and metastatic 
status.
Results: Samples from 54 patients randomised to STAMPEDE arm 
A (2006-2015) were assessed. There were 29 M0, 9 M1 low burden 
and 6 M1 high burden. Gleason score was centrally assigned with 
72% classified as GG5. The correlation between manual and digital 
scores was calculated to be 0.7562 (p=3.78e-11). The manually 
assigned Ki67 score was associated with high-grade disease (GG5 
and 4) (p = 0.031) and the presence of extra-pelvic metastases 
(p<0.001), whereas our digital Ki67 score (DigiKiPI) also showed 
a statistically significant association with high-grade disease and 
presence of metastasis (p = 0.047 and p = 0.001, respectively) with 
the added benefits of being objective and reproducible.
Conclusion: Ki67 PI is a robust prognostic tool in clinically 
advanced prostate cancer that can refine patient prognostication. 
However, it has not been broadly used in clinical routine due to 
lack of standardisation and high intra and inter observer variations. 
Automated deep learning based scoring offers a promising tool 
for better way to objectively and reproducibly quantify Ki67 PI

while reducing manual labour. We find that our DigiKiPI score is 
significantly associated with high-grade disease and the presence 
of extra-pelvic metastasis.

The Nrf2-ARE pathway: a potential novel therapeutic target 
in papillary renal cancer patients
S. Angori*, A. Banaei-Esfahani, K. Mühlbauer, A. Kahraman, V. 
Pietiäinen, S. Potdar, O. Kallionemi, P. Schraml, H. Moch
*University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland
Background & objectives: Nrf2-ARE signalling, a key sensor 
of oxidative stress in humans, is involved in papillary renal cell 
carcinoma (pRCC). We characterised Nrf2-ARE pathway over-
activation in pRCCs and screen pathway inhibitors to identify 
targeted treatment for pRCC patients.
Methods: Comprehensive characterisation of 60 formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded pRCCs by copy number analysis and 
Whole Exome Sequencing allowed us to identify pRCC groups 
based on their genetic background. Protein expression of NQO1, 
the downstream target of the Nrf2-ARE pathway, was analysed 
in pRCCs by immunohistochemistry and activity assay. Newly 
established patient-derived cell models that resemble pRCC 
tumours were applied for drug profiling.
Results: Immunohistochemical tissue microarray analysis of 119 
pRCC correlated Nrf2-ARE pathway over-activation with worse 
patient outcome and higher tumour grade and stage. Secondly, 
based on the STRING network, we identified 15 members of the 
Nrf2-ARE pathway of which 4 genes NFE2L2, Keap1, CUL3 and 
Bach1 had mutations in 12% of all samples. The investigation of 9 
matched pRCC samples and patient-derived tumour cell cultures 
demonstrated increased NQO1 mRNA and protein expression and 
activity in 56% of tumours. Finally, drug screening with 18 Nrf2-
ARE pathway inhibitors using 6 pRCC PDCs with deregulated 
Nrf2-ARE pathway activation showed Brusatol and Convallatoxin, 
two Nrf2 inhibitors, had the most potent responses in our PDCs.
Conclusion: pRCC is not a single disease but consists of at least 
two main subtypes with distinct molecular backgrounds and patient 
outcomes. We first characterised a subset of aggressive pRCCs with 
aberrant activation of the Nrf2-ARE pathway. Moreover, we showed 
that pharmacological inhibition of Nrf2 represents a promising 
therapeutic target for this tumour subtype. We anticipate that this will 
open up new possibilities for the clinical management of these patients.

Improving the quality of cfDNA testing – results from two years 
of EQA
J. Fairley*, M.H. Cheetham, S.J. Patton, Z.C. Deans
*GenQA, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Testing of cfDNA for biomarkers is 
now a recognised part of clinical practice in lung cancer. EQA 
plays an important role in assessing and improving standards. The 
results from two global EQAs testing cfDNA in lung cancer are 
presented.
Methods: Artificial plasma samples with cfDNA containing pre-
scribed variants at defined allelic frequencies were distributed. 
Laboratories tested the samples according to their usual cfDNA 
protocols and reported the results in the context of specific 
clinical cases. Reports were peer-assessed, and feedback pro-
vided to laboratories in the form of individual reports.
Results: EQAs were provided in 2020 and 2021 with the number 
of laboratories submitting results increasing from 259 to 292. 
Both EQAs included assessment of EGFR testing and 2021 also 
included KRAS. The genotyping error rate decreased from 22% 
in 2020 to 11% in 2021. Common issues observed included the 
use of inappropriate methods for cfDNA testing and a lack of 
awareness available treatment for tumours with KRAS mutations, 
over-interpretation of the absence of a variant and failing to pro-
vide sufficient details of the test methodology and limitations.
Conclusion: The increase in the number of participants reflects 
the recognition for the need for EQA for cfDNA testing. These 
EQAs have shown a large variation of methodologies being 
used and variability in genotyping accuracy and interpretation 
of results being reported. This has the potential to adversely 
impact on patient care highlighting the clear need for education 
to improve testing methods and the clear reporting of the result.

Common pitfalls in interpreting fusion testing results high-
lighted by EQA
J. Fairley*, Z.C. Deans
*GenQA, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Testing of tumours for fusion tran-
scripts by molecular methods is becoming increasingly wide-
spread. GenQA has adapted to the change in testing strategies by 
including assessment of fusions by genomic testing into existing 
EQAs and the introduction of an NTRK EQA.
Methods: Fusion -testing by molecular methods is assessed in 
the lung, thyroid and renal cancer, sarcoma and NTRK EQAs. 
FFPE tissue is provided to laboratories to test for fusions accord-
ing to their usual procedures and report the results in the context 
of the clinical case provided. Returns are assessed by expert 
assessors and laboratories provided with individual reports of 
their results.
Results: There has been a significant increase in the number of 
laboratories performing routine fusion transcript testing. Com-
mon reporting errors across the EQAs were identified which 
resulted in the incorrect interpretation of the clinical relevance 
of detected transcripts. Laboratories reported the presence of 
multiple transcripts, described transcripts incorrectly and incor-
rectly predicted the productive nature of transcript.
Conclusion: The introduction of molecular testing for fusion 
transcript has the benefit that multiple targets can be examined 
using the same assay compared to techniques such as FISH and 
IHC. EQAs for the detection of fusion transcripts in FFPE tissue 
from solid tumours have identified issues with both interpretation 
and reporting of results. This could impact on patient care and 
therefore there is a need for continual assessment of this testing.

several phase III trials. However, its high failure rate and limited 
accessibility establish a need for a clinically validated laboratory 
developed test.
Methods: The algorithm behind the Geneva HRD test was 
developed on 457 high grade serous ovarian samples and 112 
triple negative breast cancer samples from the TCGA. As part 
of the ENGOT HRD European Initiative the algorithm, applied 
on OncoScan(TM) CNV Assay data, was compared to Myriad 
with respect to the PFS on 85+384 samples from the PAOLA-1/
ENGOT-ov25 phase 3 trial.
Results: The analysis of the TCGA cohort revealed that a nor-
malization of the number of large-scale state transitions by the 
number of whole genome doubling events allows a better separa-
tion and classification of HR-deficient samples than the tripar-
tite score used by Myriad or the genomic LOH score used by 
Foundation Medicine. On the PAOLA-1 samples, the Geneva test 
yielded a similar hazard ratio as the Myriad test with respect to 
the addition of Olaparib or placebo to the Bevacizumab main-
tenance treatment (HR=0.32 vs 0.31). Compared to Myriad, the 
test yielded a lower technical failure rate (2% vs 11%) and a posi-
tive and negative predictive value of 90% and 85%.
Conclusion: The proposed test is a viable alternative to the Myriad 
myChoice HRD test and can be easily deployed in a clinical labora-
tory. The performance is similar to the commercial test in terms 
of hazard ratio but the lower failure rate of the Geneva HRD test 
allows a 10% increase (375 vs 340) in the number of patients that 
will receive a conclusive laboratory result.

Clinical utility of tumour-only targeted panel sequencing in 
childhood tumours

*National University Health System, Singapore
Background & objectives: Broad based genomic profiling is 
increasingly part of the standard workup for paediatric cancers. In 
this study, we evaluate the clinical utility of tumour-only sequenc-
ing in a cohort of 94 paediatric tumours using a targeted next gen-
eration sequencing panel.
Methods: 94 cases of paediatric solid tumours spanning multiple 
subtypes were recruited, including relapsed and refractory 
childhood cancers. Nucleic acid extracted from formalin-fixed 
paraffin embedded tissue was tested with Illumina Ampliseq 
Childhood Cancer Panel, which includes single nucleotide variants, 
copy number variants and gene fusions involving >130 genes. All 
clinically significant variants were reviewed at a multi-disciplinary 
tumour board.
Results: 94 cases of paediatric solid tumours from 87 individuals 
were sequenced, including bone and soft tissue tumours (n=30), 
central nervous system (CNS) tumours (n=17), lymphomas (n=9), 
sympathetic nervous system tumours (n=8), renal tumours (n=8), 
liver tumours (n= 5) and other tumour types.
Clinically relevant variants were identified in 57 cases (60.6%). 
Variants were of diagnostic significance in 54 cases (57.5%), thera-
peutic significance in 34 cases (36.2%), and prognostic significance 
in 11 cases (11.7%). A potential germline alteration was detected 
in 9 cases (9.3%). Based on the sequencing findings, 3 cases had a 
change in diagnosis: pancreatic Ewing sarcoma, myeloid sarcoma 
with KMT2A-MLLT3 gene fusion and metastatic colitis-associated 
colorectal adenocarcinoma (poorly-differentiated).
Conclusion: Paediatric tumour types that benefitted most from 
tumour-only sequencing were soft tissue tumours (67% of cases 
with clinically relevant variants) and CNS tumours (65% of cases 
with clinically relevant variants). Whilst changes in histological 
diagnoses were rare, molecular findings were extremely useful in 
assisting diagnosis of rare or poorly-differentiated entities, as well 
as tumours occurring in uncharacteristic locations.

The activation of Jagged1 signalling by chemotherapeutic 
agents counteracts the Oxaliplatin/5Fluorouracil- mediated 
anti-cancer effects: a novel mechanism of drug resistance in 
colon cancer

*Center for Life Nano-&Neuro-Science (CL2NS@Sapienza), Isti-
tuto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy
Background & objectives: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a lead-
ing cause of mortality worldwide, characterized by metastasis 
and resistance to therapy. Recently, we demonstrated that Kras 
mutation drives the activation of Jag1-ICD oncogene, via-ERK1/2. 
Herein, we explore the new intrinsic drug-resistance mechanisms, 
Jag1-ICD-mediated.
Methods: Human CRC cell lines were treated with different 
chemotherapeutic compounds (e.g. OXP, 5FU and GSIs), alone 
or in combination, and subjected to in-vitro assays, to evaluate 
proliferation, metastasis and chemoresistance. CRC resistant cells 
were obtained by chronical treatment with low doses of OXP/5FU. 
The resistant cells were analysed by colony-formation assays and 
by qRT-PCR to assess growth and gene-reprogramming ability.
Results: Herein, we evaluate the effects of OXP, 5FU and GSIs 
alone or in combination, on Jagged1 processing in CRC cell lines. 
We demonstrate that the anticancer drugs, OXP and 5FU, lead 
directly to a massive Jag1-ICD activation that results in the selec-
tion of a drug-resistant subpopulation. The chemoresistance mecha-
nism is induced by a forced Jag1-ICD accumulation that protects 
cells from apoptosis, under the activation of Jag1-ICD-dependent 
pro-survival targets. In addition, GSIs induce the proliferation of 
Jag1-ICD positive CRC cells, functioning as tumour-promoting 
agents. Finally, the Jagged1 abrogation in OXP- or 5FU-resistant 
subpopulations is enough to restore the sensitivity to chemother-
apy, confirming that drug resistance is Jag1-ICD-dependent.
Conclusion: Overall, our data show that Jagged1 processing is 
directly activated by the most potent chemotherapeutic agents 
(OXP/5FU) or by GSIs compounds. Moreover, we unveil a new 
role for Jag1-ICD oncogene which controls both apoptosis and 
proliferation, in CRC cells upon chemotherapeutic treatments. 
Therefore, we demonstrate the existence of a new mechanism of 
intrinsic drug-resistance, where Jag1-ICD functions as pivotal 
nuclear effector. Finally, we suggest Jagged1 as molecular 
predictive biomarker for the chemotherapy-outcome in CRC 
patients bearing Krasmut and over-expressing Jagged1.

cell lung carcinoma (NS-NSCLC) patients, notably for a rapid 
assessment of multiple genomic alterations.
Methods: We compared two ultra-fast gene fusion assessment 
assays, using a next generation sequencing (Genexus, Oncomine™ 
Precision Assay, Thermo-Fisher) or an RT-PCR (Idylla™, Gen-
eFusion Assay, Biocartis) approaches, set up as a reflex testing 
at diagnosis.
Results: 250 NS-NSCLC patients (68 ALK, 26 ROS1, 15 RET, 6 
NTRK, 11 MET positive and 125 wild type patients) from 8 centers 
were included. 83% of patients were stage IIIB-IV.
The sensitivity (98%) and specificity (99%) of the two approaches 
were analogous, when compared to gold standard methods, accred-
ited according to the ISO15189 norm in the Laboratory of Clinical 
and Experimental Pathology (Nice, France).
Conclusion: Ultra-fast gene fusion evaluation using NGS or 
RT-PCR approaches should be developed as a reflex testing for 
NS-NSCLC at diagnosis in order to treat these patients according 
to the international recommendations and guidelines.

J. Donadieu, J. Haroche, J. Emile
*Department of Pathology, Ambroise-Paré Hospital, France
Background & objectives: Newly described immunomarkers 
could bring potential benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of 
histiocytosis. Our objective was to analyse recently described 
nuclear markers and to expand the immunohistochemical panel 
in the diagnosis of histiocytosis.
Methods: Biopsy samples diagnosed with Erdheim-Chester 
Disease (ECD), Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), Rosai 
Dorfman Disease (RDD), malignant histiocytosis, and cutaneous 
histiocytosis were retrieved from the files of our Pathology 
Department. Haematoxylin & eosin-stained slides were reviewed. 
Immunohistochemistry was performed with the following 
antibodies: PU.1(EPR3158Y, Abcam), OCT.2(EPR12482-106, 
Abcam), phosphoERK(Erk 1/2, Cell Signalling). Molecular 
biology was performed using PCR or Next-Generation 
Sequencing.
Results: phosphoERK was performed in 567 biopsy samples 
of histiocytosis. It was positive in 91%, 86%, 73%, 67%, 70% 
and 83% of LCH (n=118), ECD (n=198), mixed (n=22), RDD 
(n=119), cutaneous (n=86) and malignant histiocytosis (n=24), 
respectively. All the types of histiocytosis were positive for PU.1 
(5 LCH, 5 ECD, 7 RDD, 4 ALK+ and 8 C group). Among the 
17 cases referred as malignant histiocytosis, all the 9 confirmed 
cases were positive, contrasting with the 8 excluded cases that 
were negative. OCT.2 was positive in 42/80 cases of RDD. All 9 
mixed RDD-ECD or RDD-LCH were OCT.2 positive. 18/38 cases 
of non-RDD had at least a low positivity for OCT.2.
Conclusion: PU.1 is a marker indicating a histiocytic origin and it 
is useful to exclude a tumour rich in reactive histiocytes mimick-
ing histiocytosis. OCT.2 can be used to confirm Rosai-Dorfman 
Disease. phosphoERK is a nuclear and cytoplasmic marker high-
lighting the activation of MAPkinase pathway and it can be used 
to initiate targeted therapy in histiocytosis when molecular biology 
is not available.

Clonality analysis of Richter’s transformation in CLL treated 
with targeted therapy

R. Goswami
*Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University 
of Toronto, Canada
Background & objectives: Richter’s syndrome (RS) occurs in 
1-10% of patients with chronic/small lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL/
SLL). Clonal transformation has a poorer prognosis than de novo 
transformation, and benefits from more aggressive chemotherapy. 
We sought to characterize RS clonality in a Canadian case series.
Methods: DNA was extracted from FFPE lymph node, bone 
marrow, or banked cells. Targeted NGS of heavy and light chain 
regions was performed using the Oncomine BCR Pan-Clonality 
Assay (ThermoFisher). IGH, IGK, and IGL rearrangements 
and clonal frequencies were assessed through the Ion Reporter 
Oncomine BCR workflow and MiXCR. Slides and IHC were 
reviewed to confirm the diagnosis.
Results: We identified nine patients with 20 pre- and post-
transformation samples. The median age at diagnosis was 52 (range 
44-84), with median 9 years (range 1.9-15) between the diagnosis 
of CLL vs RS. Most cases transformed to DLBCL (n=7), and the 
remainder to classical Hodgkin lymphoma (n=2). 7/9 patients 
had received therapy prior to transformation, including ibrutinib, 
acalabrutinib, or venetoclax. Analysis of the heavy chain and light 
chain loci revealed a clonal relationship in all nine cases, including 
one case where the secondary DLBCL was CD5-negative. 
Interestingly, several cases exhibited multiple productive IGH 
rearrangements (2/9) or light chain rearrangements (7/9) shared 
between the pre- and post-transformation cells.
Conclusion: Targeted sequencing of a case series of CLL patients 
with RS revealed a clonal relationship in all nine cases. Multiple 
productive Ig rearrangements were identified in a surprising number 
of cases, consistent with a growing number of NGS studies support-
ing greater diversity in CLL clonality than previously appreciated.

Delineating the spatial compartmentalization of human 
follicular B cell metabolic dynamics
M.M. Perra*, A. Noto, K. Ioannidou, M. Foglierini-Perez, C. Fen-
wick, L. de Leval, C. Petrovas, G. Pantaleo
*Unil-CHUV, Switzerland
Background & objectives: Despite the well-established role 
of germinal centers (GC) for the generation of protective B cell 
response, an insight on the in-situ human GC immune reactions 
remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the energetic and metabolic 
profile of follicular B cells.
Methods: Metabolic profile of primary tonsillar B cells were char-
acterized by applying complementary methodologies. Phenotyping 
and 2-NBDG uptake of relevant B cell subsets were assessed by 
multiparametric flow-cytometry. Ex vivo metabolic function (Sea-
horse) and transcriptomic signatures (bulk NGS) were investigated 
on cryopreserved TNMCs (tonsillar mononuclear cells). Multiplex 
tissue imaging was applied for the in situ B cell metabolic profiling.
Results: Seahorse analysis revealed that OXPHOS supported 70% 
and glycolysis 30% of total ATP produced in GCBCs. Coherently, 
an increased 2-NBDG uptake was observed in GCBCs. GSEA of 
sorted B-cell subsets showed significant enrichment of OXPHOS 
and mTORC1 pathways in GCBCs, with several glycolysis-related 
genes being significantly expressed. In-vitro treatment with 
UK5099 (MPC inhibitor), negatively affected the SRC, MRC, and 
Krebs capacity in GCBCs as compared to untreated controls. Tis-
sue imaging of FFPE-tonsillar sections revealed a polarization of 
GLUT1, MCT4, HIF1a and HIF1b in Light Zone, while Opa1 was 
expressed within Dark Zone. Gene expression of MCT1 (lactate 
transporter) was increased in GCBCs, while imaging showed its 
distribution across the GC.

Conclusion: Despite an intense dependence of GCBCs on OXPHOS, 
glycolysis is a significant energy supporter too. Tissue in situ analysis 
suggests the coupling of massive division in DZ with OXPHOS and 
local exchange of lactate, while glycolysis is more frequent among 
B cells in LZ. Moreover, the lactate transporters’ expression and the 
impaired Krebs cycle capacity induced by MPC-blockade point to a 
significant role of glucose-derived carbon atoms and monocarboxylates 
in sustaining the oxidative machinery.

Comparison of the accuracy of cytomorphology, flow 
cytometry immunophenotyping and immunohistochemistry in 
determining diagnostic and prognostic blast percentage groups 
in bone marrow in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid 
leukaemia cases
E. Hacihasanoglu*
*Yeditepe University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Bone marrow (BM) blast percentage 
(BP) is important in diagnosis, classification and prognosis of 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia 
(AML). We aimed to compare accuracy of cytomorphology (CM), 
flow cytometry immunophenotyping (FCI), immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) in determining BP groups.
Methods: BM biopsy and aspiration samples from MDS and AML 
patients and patients diagnosed with AML underwent bone marrow 
transplantation (BMT) between 9/2019 and 6/2021 were analysed. 
CM was evaluated. CD34 positive BP was determined by FCI and 
IHC. Cases were divided into four groups according to BP: <5%, 
≥5%-<10%, ≥10%-<20%, ≥20%. Three methods were compared 
with the Pearson-r correlation.
Results: A total of 68 BM materials from 55 patients were analysed. 
Thirty-nine of the cases were MDS (7 MDS-EB), 2 of them were AML, 
and 14 of them were AML patients who underwent BMT. Pearson-r 
correlations for absolute values in CM-FCI, CM-IHC, and FCI-IHC 
comparisons were 0.8865, 0.8787, 0.9670, respectively, indicating a 
good correlation. When CM-FCI was compared, 86.7% of the cases 
were in the same blast range. In the comparison of CM-IHC, 79.4% of 
the cases were in the same blast range. Comparison of IHC-FCI showed 
88.2% correlation in blast intervals.
Conclusion: BM blast rate determination is important in MDS 
classification and MDS-AML differentiation. Although CM is 
the gold standard, reproducibility is low even with high-quality 
smears. In our study, we observed good correlations between 
CM, FCI and IHC. Correlation between FCI and IHC, which have 
high reproducibility and low interobserver variability, was even 
higher. However, this study is limited to cases showing CD34 
expression. Although FCI and IHC methods have high accuracy 
with CM, using the three methods together is recommended.

Prevalence and impact of co-infections in patients with lym-
phoma and HIV
C. Padrão*, A.M. Gonçalves Pereira, F. Pereira, J. Tinoco, M.G. 
Gasparinho
*Hospital Prof. Dr. Fernando Fonseca, Portugal
Background & objectives: HIV infection is associated with the 
development of lymphomas and some other co-infections (eg., 
HBV and HCV). The aim of our study was to review lymphomas 
arising in HIV setting and linked co-infections, in a patient’s 
cohort from our hospital.
Methods: We selected patients diagnosed with HIV and lymphoma 
between 2010-2020 in our hospital, from our electronic medical 
database. Demographic data, date of diagnosis, date of death/last 
contact, lymphomas types and location, serologies for hepatitis 
B and C, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasma and Epstein-Barr virus (6 
months prior until 3 months after lymphoma diagnosis) were col-
lected. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed.
Results: We selected 52 patients (71.2% males). HIV-1 was pre-
dominant (90.4% of the cases). Average age of HIV diagnosis was 
42.38 years and of lymphoma diagnosis was 47.79 years; mean 
interval between diagnoses was 64 months (36.5% diagnosed 
within 1-year).
Laboratory data demonstrated high prevalence of chronic hepatitis 
C (9.6%) and B (28,8%) and low prevalence of recent EBV (1.9) or 
CMV (3.8) infection.
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (40.4%), Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
(23.1%) and plasmablastic lymphoma (11.5%) were the most 
frequent types. Lymph node involvement (59.6%) was predominant, 
followed by bone marrow (7.9%) and gastric involvement (5.8%). 
Mortality rate was 59.6%. Median survival was 11.71 months after 
lymphoma diagnosis.
Conclusion: Our patients’ cohort follows the general patterns of 
gender, HIV type distribution and main types of lymphomas diag-
nosed in HIV-infection setting usually described in literature. We 
have a higher frequency of plasmablastic lymphoma though, not 
readily explained by a similar rise of frequency of EBV infection 
– not all patients were tested for EBV, what may account for the 
lower frequency observed. We hope to further investigate this point 
in future studies.

Immunohistochemistry against RB1 is useful for the 
distinction between giant cell glioblastoma and pleomorphic 
xanthoastrocytoma

A. Scarpa
*Department of Diagnostic and Public Health, University of 
Verona, Italy
Background & objectives: Giant cell glioblastoma (GC-GBM) 
displays frequent RB1 alterations, aside from TP53 mutations. 
Herein, we aimed to assess the value of RB1 immunohistochemistry 
in the differential diagnosis between GC-GBM and pleomorphic 
xanthoastrocytoma (PXA), which harbours better prognosis and 
frequent BRAF mutations.
Methods: In 34 GC-GBMs and 8 PXA (5 grade 2 and 3 grade 
3), we analysed: i) mutations and copy number variations of 409 
genes using NGS; ii) RB1, P53 and BRAF p.V600E immunostain-
ings. Cases were classified P53 positive when showing at least 10% 
stained tumour cells.
Results: GC-GBMs were RB1-altered in 15 cases (including 4 
with RB1 homozygous deletion, 5 with RB1 heterozygous deletion 
coupled with mutation of the other allele and 6 with RB1 muta-
tions), TP53-mutated in 27 (including 6 with truncating mutations) 
and BRAF-mutated in none. At immunohistochemistry, all 15 GC-
GBMs with RB1-alterations and 11 RB1-unaltered cases had RB1 
loss, 21 were P53 positive and all were BRAF negative. GC-GBMs 
were RB1-/P53+ in 16 cases, RB1-/P53- in 10, RB1+/P53+ in 5, 
RB1+/P53- in 3.

PXA were BRAF-mutated in 6 cases, TP53-mutated in 3 and RB1-
altered in none. All six cases with BRAF mutation were BRAF 
p.V600E positive; no PXA was RB1 negative or P53 positive.
Conclusion: An immunohistochemical profile consisting in RB1 
loss associated with, or alternative to, P53 positivity had the same 
specificity (100%), but higher sensitivity (91% vs 61%) for GC-
GBM than P53 positivity alone. The addition of RB1 staining in an 
immunohistochemical algorithm including P53 and BRAF p.V600E 
may be helpful to differentiate GC-GBM from PXA.

Myoepithelial neoplasia of central nervous system: a series of 
4 cases
S. Yeni Yildirim, K. Kosemehmetoglu*, F. Soylemezoglu
*Hacettepe University, Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Myoepithelial neoplasms, composed 
of myoepithelioma and myoepithelial carcinoma, have not 
been documented in the central nervous system. Here we 
present clinicopathological characteristics of 4 neoplasms with 
myoepithelial differentiation involving the brain and spinal cord.
Methods: The clinicopathological findings of 4 cases were 
evaluated: 1) 16-year-old female with a 6-cm tumour in the right 
frontoparietal region.2) 24-year-old female with a 6-cm tumour in 
T12-L2. 3) 8-year-old female with a 3,5-cm tumour in T11-L1. 4) 
20-year-old female with a 3-cm tumour in C4-T2. Spinal tumours 
were located in intradural-extramedullary space, and the cranial 
tumour was dural-based.
Results: All patients were female with a mean age of 17(8-24). 
Histopathologically; 3 tumours were characterized by nests/
cords and sheets composed of malignant epithelioid/rhabdoid 
cells in myxocollagenous background at least focally, thus 
categorized as myoepithelial carcinoma. Case 2 was reminiscent 
of myoepithelioma/mixed tumour of soft tissue; however, showed 
a malignant behaviour. We found loss of INI1 expression in 3 of 
4 cases; S100+EMA coexpression, and positivity for at least one 
keratin marker in all cases. SMA was positive in 3 of 4 cases. 
Break-apart FISH revealed EWSR1 rearrangements in 2 of 3 cases. 
Two cases (cases 2 and 3) died, one of whom (case 2) with multiple 
recurrences and lung metastasis.
Conclusion: Myoepithelial neoplasms occur in the central nerv-
ous system of children and young adult females and should be 
considered in the differential diagnosis of INI1 deficient tumours, 
after exclusion of AT/RT, poorly-differentiated chordoma, and epi-
thelioid sarcoma. Multiple myoepithelial marker expression and 
INI1 loss along with EWSR rearrangements favour the diagnosis 
of myoepithelial neoplasm.

Solitary fibrous tumour of central nervous system: a series of 
23 cases
O. Sular, B. Babaoglu, G. Yazici, K. Kosemehmetoglu*, F. 
Soylemezoglu
*Hacettepe University, Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Meningeal solitary fibrous tumour is 
characterized by fibroblastic proliferation with hemangiopericy-
tomatous pattern and NAB2::STAT6 alterations. Here, we present 
clinicopathological features of our series with a special emphasis 
on the predictability of biological behaviour with the current grad-
ing schemes.
Methods: The clinical, radiological, and pathological findings of 
23 cases were evaluated. Immunohistochemically, all cases were 
STAT6 positive. Age, sex, tumour size, location, hypercellularity, 
mitotic activity, presence of necrosis, hemorrhage, moderate to 
high-grade nuclear pleomorphism, recurrence, death, and time 
for recurrence were noted. Tumours were graded according to 
WHO2016 and WHO2021 classifications. Recurrence-free and 
overall survival statistics were applied.
Results: The mean age was 37 (14-51) with M:F ratio of 12:11. Tumours 
had intracranial (n=19) and spinal (n=4) locations; sizes ranged from 2 to 
7 cm with a mean of 4,2 cm. Tumours were classified by WHO2021 as 
grade 1 (n = 12), 2 (n = 6), or 3 (n = 5), and by WHO2016 as grade 1 (n 
=4), grade 2 (n=8), or grade 3 (n=11). Necrosis was present in 7 (30%). 
Recurrence occurred in 10 (44%) patients within a mean of 5.6 years, 7 of 
which were dead during follow-up. On univariate analysis, neither of the 
above-mentioned parameters nor grading schemes were associated with 
recurrence-free or overall survival.
Conclusion: According to our data, morphological and clinical 
parameters, as well as WHO grading schemes, failed to stratify this 
family of tumours accurately.

*Università degli Studi di Messina, Italy
Background & objectives: Predictive factors for response to 
regorafenib in recurrent glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, are scarcely 
recognized. The objective of this study was to identify molecular 
predictive factors for response to regorafenib using a clinically 
available platform.
Methods: We analysed a prospective cohort of 30 patients har-
bouring recurrent glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, and treated with 
regorafenib. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis was per-
formed on DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues using a 
clinically available platform. Moreover, MGMT methylation and 
EGFRvIII expression analyses were performed.
Results: Six-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 30% and 
median overall survival (OS) was 7.5 months. NGS analysis revealed 
a mutation of EGFR pathway in 18% of cases and a mutation in the 
mitogen-activated protein-kinase (MAPK) pathway in 18% of cases. 
In the remaining cases, no mutations were detected. MAPK pathway 
mutated patients had a poor response to regorafenib treatment, 
with a significantly shorter PFS and a nonsignificantly shorter OS 
compared to EGFR-mutated patients (for PFS, p=0.0061; for OS, 
p=0.1076). Multivariate analysis confirmed that MAPK pathway 
mutations independently predicted a shorter PFS after regorafenib 
treatment (p=0.0188). The negative prognostic role of MAPK 
alteration was reinforced when we combined EGFR-mutated with 
EGFRvIII-positive cases.
Conclusion: Recurrent glioblastoma tumours with an alteration 
in MAPK pathway could belong to the mesenchymal subtype and 
respond poorly to regorafenib treatment, while EGFR-altered cases 
have a better response to regorafenib. We thus provide a molecular 
selection criteria easy to implement in the clinical practice.

Background & objectives: The risk of recurrence and metastasis 
of solitary fibrous tumours is greatly dependent of proliferation. 
We aimed to determine the prognostic significance of Ki67 and 
PHH3 evaluated by digital image analysis in a cohort of 86 menin-
geal solitary fibrous tumours.
Methods: We compared eye-balling estimation, manual count-
ing, and standardized digital image analysis using QuPath soft-
ware to evaluate cellularity and proliferation based on Ki67 and 
PHH3, with correlation with survival in a retrospective cohort of 
86 meningeal solitary fibrous tumours. The concordance between 
the methods was calculated and the processing time was compared.
Results: Evaluation of proliferation by digital image analysis with 
Ki67≥0.05 or PHH3≥0.0006 cut-off was significantly associated with 
worse PFS and OS in univariate and multivariate analyses, with a 
significantly shorter processing time for digital image analysis. Manual 
counting and digital image analysis were highly correlated, with a 
concordance correlation coefficient of 0.973 (95% CI: 0.061-0.981) for 
Ki67 and 0,810 (95% CI: 0.725-0.867) for PHH3. Eye-balling estimation 
showed less correlation with other methods.
Conclusion: Digital image analysis is a fast and accurate method 
for evaluating proliferation markers. Using this method, Ki67 
≥0.05 and PHH3≥0.0006 have a negative impact on PFS and OS 
in univariate and multivariate analyses.

Morphological analysis with morphometry of meningioma 
calcifications
A. Denysenko*, R. Moskalenko
*Sumy State University, Ukraine
Background & objectives: Meningiomas are the most common 
non-glial tumours of the central nervous system. Differential 
diagnosis of meningiomas is a challenging problem due to their 
location. The work aims to study the morphology, structure, and 
phase analysis of meningiomas’ psammoma bodies (PB).
Methods: The study group included 30 patients with calcified 
meningiomas. We use histological techniques, transmission and 
scanning electron microscopy with microanalysis. We captured 
all photos with the digital visualisation system on Zeiss Primo 
Star microscope with digital camera ZEISS Axiocam ERc 5s 
and software package “Zen 2.0”. We performed the statistical 
analysis of the results using GraphPad Prism 7.04.
Results: All meningioma samples contained PB in the fibrous tissue 
of the tumour. According to the histological examination and SEM 
results, PB had a layered structure. They were often in the form of 
fragments and fragments that preserved the original structure. The 
number of PB in meningioma tissue varied from one to hundreds of 
units. In our study, the size of the PB ranged from 20.01 to 197.02 
μm. We can generally divide PB by dimensional characteristics 
(larger formation diameter) into three groups: large (more than 100 
μm), medium (70-100 μm) and small (less than 69 μm).
Conclusion: PB is a promising diagnostic marker for the prognosis of 
dura mater tumours, which doctors and scientists can use in radiologi-
cal and histological methods. According to morphometry results, we 
can divide PB into three groups by size - large, medium and small.

Thalamic diffuse midline glioma, a series of cases from a single 
cancer centre
S. Al Sharie, D. Abu Laban, S. Ghnaimat, M. Al- Hussaini*
*King Hussien Cancer Center, Jordan
Background & objectives: Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) of 
thalamus is rare, as thalamic tumours, in general, represent 1% of 
all intracranial neoplasms. It is associated with aggressive behav-
iours and poor prognosis. Recently, DMGs are characterized by the 
presence of an H3K27M gene mutation.
Methods: Eighteen thalamic DMGs are reviewed, including the 
age, gender, and laterality. Immunostains for GFAP, H3 K27M, 
and H3 K27me, IDH1 (R132H), P53. The outcome of the cases 
is reported.
Results: There were 11 males. The average age is 34 years (median 
27.5). All cases were positive for GFAP. Eight cases were mutant 
for H3 K27M, all with loss of H3 K27me staining. In addition, a 
single case showed loss of H3 K27me immunostain in the pres-
ence of non-mutant H3K27M. There were 8 P53-mutant cases. All 
cases were IDH1 (R132H) wildtype. Of interest, there were 3 cases 
diagnosed as pilocytic astrocytoma, including a case that was H3 
K27M mutant. Of those with available survival data, 10 were dead, 
including 4 cases of mutant H3 K27M and a single case of wildtype 
H3 K27M, but with loss of H3 K27me.
Conclusion: Around 50% of the cases are consistent with the 
diagnosis of DMG where H3 K27M is altered. However, there 
remains a number of cases with dismal outcomes that were non-
H3 K27M altered. These should be further tested for potential 
other mutations.

Histone H3 trimethylated in lysine 27 (H3K27me3) immuno-
histochemical loss predicts shorter progression-free survival 
in intracranial meningiomas treated with radiosurgery

Pedron, G. Pinna, F. Sala, A. Nicolato, A. Scarpa, V. Barresi
*Department of Diagnostic and Public Health, University of 
Verona, Italy
Background & objectives: Loss of H3K27me3 has been recently 
associated with an increased risk of recurrence in meningiomas. 
In the current study, we aim to investigate whether H327 
trimethylation status can predict the response of meningiomas 
to stereotactic radiosurgery.
Methods: H3K27me3 expression was evaluated by immunohisto-
chemistry in 39 surgically resected, treatment-naive intra-cranial 
meningiomas, treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for a 
residue or at recurrence. The immunohistochemical results were 
correlated with tumour recurrence and recurrence-free survival 
(RFS) after SRS.
Results: Seven meningiomas had H3K27me3 loss, 27 retained 
H3K27me3 expression and five has inconclusive immunostaining. 
The immunohistochemical loss of H3K27me3 was significantly 
associated with tumour recurrence (P= 0.0143) and with shorter 
RFS (P=0.0036) after SRS.
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the absence of H3K27me3 
in neoplastic cells may concur to a weaker response to stereotactic 
radiosurgery in meningiomas.

tumour growth in animal model of glioblastoma through unclear 
mechanism.
Methods: We use immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization 
to identify location and cell of origin for LAMB1/2 production in 
human brain.
Results: In quiescent state brain the microvasculature but does not 
express LAMB1, but expresses LAMB2 at the sites of blood brain 
and CSF brain barrier. Remodelling of microvasculature in suba-
cute stroke involves initial deposition of LAMB1 by proliferating 
endothelium, followed by an encasement by LAMB2. Low grade 
diffuse astrocytomas show no LAMB1 expression. Microvascular 
hyperplasia in GBM show striking deposition of LAMB1, while 
LAMB2 coverage trails behind. Bevacizumab induces a loss of 
LAMB1 and normalizes LAMB2 coverage.
Conclusion: Distribution of LAMB2 correlates with sites 
controlling fluid permeability. Expression of LAMB1 corresponds 
to endothelial cells and coincides with angiogenesis. Expression 
of LAMB2 lags behind LAMB1 and its deficiency in the 
microvascular wall correlates with increased permeability.

Molecular genetics and immunostaining of relapsing inoperable 
meningiomas located at the base of skull (BS) or in frontal 
areas, before radiotherapy
M. Alshemeili*, M. Barritault, D. Poncet, E. Jouanneau, D. 
Meyronet
*Hospice Civil de Lyon, France
Background & objectives: Our experience in screening for targ-
etable molecular alterations of untreatable meningiomas led us to 
hypothesise that these mutations were less frequent than expected 
considering available studies.
Our goal to provide prospective clinic-pathological/ molecular data 
to support future pharmacological targeted therapies.
Methods: From 2018 to 2022, the molecular status of p-AKT and 
SHH activating molecular alterations was prospectively determined 
using NGS in the first biopsy of all relapsing patients after surgery 
with pathologically diagnosed meningioma located at BS or in 
frontal areas, before radiotherapy prescribed in our center’s multi-
disciplinary meeting. Further evaluation of IHC prescreening using 
GAB1 and OTX2 was also conducted.
Results: -61 patients were included: 61.66% (N=36) in BS with 
median age 53 while 80.33% (N=47) were female. 62% (N=38) 
were grade 1, 35% (N=21) were grade 2 and 3% (N=2) grade 3.
-2 (3%) meningiomas displayed a SMO mutation and 4 (6%) men-
ingiomas a PIK3CA mutation. Five (83%) meningiomas with SMO 
or PIK3CA mutations were grade I.
-Among the 8 cases (16%) that express GAB1 with a H-score >120, 
2 were associated with SMO and 1 with PIK3CA mutation. OTX2 
expression was contributive.
- All AKT mutated meningiomas (N=9,100%) , displayed a GAB1 
H-score < 120, a score considered as negative. Conversely GAB1 
was expressed in SHH activated meningiomas.
Conclusion: -In real life clinical situation we showed that SHH and 
mTOR activating mutations are rarer than previously described in 
exhaustive “molecular landscape” studies. These new data should 
be taken in account for future therapeutic trial designs.
-GAB1 could be a useful marker for immunohistochemical pre-
screening of cases amenable to sequencing for hedgehog pathway 
or mTOR pathway genes sequencing while OTX2 is not a benefi-
cial marker.
-The WHO grading system has no role in predicting tumour molec-
ular alterations of meningiomas.

miR-196b-5p and miR-107 expression differentiates ocular 
sebaceous carcinoma from squamous cell carcinoma of the 
conjunctiva

daens, E.A. Wiemer
*Erasmus MC University Medical Center Rotterdam, The 
Netherlands
Background & objectives: Ocular Sebaceous Carcinoma (OSC) 
can mimic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Conjunctiva (SCCC). 
Aim of this study was to find microRNA biomarkers to distinguish 
OSC and SCCC from normal tissue and from each other.
Methods: Clinical OSC and SCCC case files and corresponding 
histopathological slides were collected and reviewed. Microdis-
sected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour and control tissue 
were subjected to semi-high throughput microRNA profiling.
Results: MicroRNA expression distinguishes OSC and SCCC from 
corresponding control tissues. Selected differentially expressed miRNAs 
were validated using single RT-PCR assays. A comparison between 
OSC (n=14) and SCCC (n=18) revealed 38 differentially expressed 
microRNAs (p<0.05). Differentially expressed miRNAs were selected 
for validation in the discovery cohort and an independent validation 
cohort (OSC, n=11; SCCC, n=12). At least two miRNAs miR-196b-5p 
(p ≤ 0.05) and miR-107 (p ≤ 0.001) displayed a statistically significant 
differential expression between OSC and SCCC with miR-196b-5p 
upregulated in SCCC and miR-107 upregulated in OSC. ROC analyses 
indicated that the combined miR-196b-5p and miR-107 expression lev-
els predicted OSC with 90.0% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that deregulated miRNAs, 
identified by comparing tumour tissue with corresponding control 
tissue, may play a role in the tumourigenic processes in OSC and 
SCCC. We provide evidence that miR-196b-5p and miR-107 can 
differentiate OSC from SCCC. Combined testing of miR-196b-5p 
and miR-107, may be of additional use in routine diagnostics to 
discriminate OSC from SCCC in conjunctival tumour lesions.

Audit of outcomes for metastatic uveal melanoma patients in 
Ireland
C. Hegarty*, K. Kulakova, N. Walsh, C. Hui, S. Kennedy
* Research Foundation, Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, Dublin, 
Ireland
Background & objectives: Uveal Melanoma (UM) accounts for 
approximately 85% of ocular melanomas. The published rate of 
metastasis is approximately 50%, 5 years following diagnosis. This 
retrospective analysis investigated the percentage of patients who 
metastasised and their outcome over a 21 year period.
Methods: A detail review of pathology files, cancer registry files 
and death certs were accessioned, and results were tabulated on 
excel. UM patients who received enucleation were selected and 
further analysis was used to determine who presented with metas-
tasis. Prior to 2011 patients were treated by enucleation. From 
2011 on patients were treated by either plaque rt, proton beam or 
enucleation.
Results: From 194 identified metastatic cases, 93 were female and 
101 male. Patient age ranged from 11-90 (average age: 62) at initial 
diagnosis. 10 patients were aged 20-40, 61 aged 40-60, 112 aged 
60-80 and 17 aged 80-100. Youngest patient in this cohort was 11 and 
metastasised and died shortly after diagnosis. Primary tumour location: 
choroid and ciliary body. Average time for metastasis was 44 months.

Sites of metastasis included liver, lung, and skin. Metastasis rates were 
as follows: 116 patients metastasised 0-24 months after diagnosis, 57 
patients 24-48 months and 51 exhibited late metastasis ranging from 
60-216 months after initial diagnosis. Patients died on average 1.5 years 
following metastatic diagnosis.
Conclusion: From the analysis in our institution the incidence 
of metastatic disease corresponds with the European published 
figures. Our cohort includes a number of patients with a meta-
static UM diagnosis prior to the age of 35. We found that 47.2% of 
patients treated for UM metastasised on average 43 months follow-
ing diagnosis and the average time to death following metastasis 
was 1.5 years. Genetic analysis is currently underway to examine 
the contribution of specific genes role in early and late metastasis.

Swarm learning for decentralized deep learning in gastric can-
cer histopathology

M. Kohlruß, G. Keller, J.N. Kather
*UniKlinik Aachen, Germany
Background & objectives: A limitation for computational pathol-
ogy is the difficulty of data exchange. Swarm learning (SL) is a 
protocol for decentralized training of deep learning models. We 
evaluate SL for the prediction of microsatellite instability (MSI) 
from gastric cancer histopathology images.
Methods: We collected tissue samples from four cohorts of patients 
with gastric cancer from four countries (Switzerland, Germany, the 
UK and the USA). Each dataset was stored in a physically sepa-
rate computer. We trained a deep learning-based classifier to detect 
microsatellite instability using SL from digitized haematoxylin and 
eosin-stained resection slides without annotating tumour containing 
regions.
Results: We evaluated the patient-level performance for the pre-
diction of MSI status in the TCGA cohort (N=334 patients). 
We found that local models achieved AUROCs of 0.7016 (+/- 
0.0087), 0.5600 (+/- 0.0238) and 0.6638 (+/- 0.0170) when 
trained on local datasets. Merging the three training cohorts 
on a central server (merged model) improved the prediction of 
AUROC to 0.7508 (+/- 0.0074). This was compared to the per-
formance of SL-trained models, and we assessed the performance 
of a weighted Swarm Learning model (w-chkpt) for MSI muta-
tion prediction. In this task, w-chkpt achieved an AUROC of 
0.7469 (+/- 0.0214), which was not significantly different from 
the merged model (p=0.7806).
Conclusion: Computational pathology problems in gastric cancer 
requires large datasets. Preferably, such data should be derived 
from different centres so as to avoid bias. However, the collection 
of such datasets faces practical, ethical and legal obstacles. These 
obstacles can be overcome using SL. In the future, this could be 
an alternative for sharing patient-related data across sites.

BLEACH&STAIN, a novel multiplex fluorescence immuno-
histochemistry framework that facilitates a fast high through-
put analysis of >15 biomarkers in more than 3000 human 
carcinomas

*University Medical Center Hamburg, Germany
Background & objectives: Multiplex fluorescence immunohis-
tochemistry (mfIHC) approaches were yet either limited to 6 
markers or limited to a small (1.5cmx1.5cm) tissue size that 
hampers translational studies on large tissue microarray (TMA) 
cohorts.
Methods: To assess more markers in a large patient cohort, 
we have developed a BLEACH&STAIN mfIHC approach that 
enables the analysis of ≥15 biomarkers in 3098 tumour sam-
ples from 44 different carcinoma entities within one week and 
without costly instrumentalization. An artificial intelligence-
based framework –incorporating three different deep learning 
systems– for automated marker quantification was used to inter-
operate the BLEACH&STAIN data.
Results: This approach was used to study the relationship between 
PD-L1 expression on multiple different cell types and the relation-
ship with various leucocyte subtypes (PD-L1,PD-1,CTLA-4,pan
CK,CD68,CD163,CD11c,iNOS,CD3,CD8,CD4,FOXP3,CD20,
Ki67,CD31). Comparing the automated and deep learning-based 
BLEACH&STAIN PD-L1 analysis framework with conventional 
brightfield PD-L1 data revealed a high concordance in tumour cells 
(p<0.0001) as well as immune cells (p<0.0001) and an accuracy of 
our approach ranging from 90% to 95.2%. Unsupervised clustering 
showed that a major proportion of the three PD-L1 phenotypes (i.e., 
PD-L1+ tumour and immune cells [G1], PD-L1+ immune cells [G2], 
PD-L1 negative [G3]) were either inflamed (G1.1, G2.1, G3.1) or 
non-inflamed (G1.2, G2.2, G3.2) and showed distinct spatial orches-
tration patterns.
Conclusion: BLEACH&STAIN mfIHC in combination with a 
deep learning-based framework for automated PD-L1 assessment 
on tumour and immune cells enabled a rapid and comprehensive 
assessment of 15 biomarkers across more than 3000 tumour entities 
that is quick and easy to establish in all laboratories. In breast 
cancer, the PD-L1 relative expression on tumour cells showed a 
significantly higher predictive performance for overall survival 
compared to the commonly used PD-L1 tumour proportion score.

Pathologists’ first perspectives on barriers and facilitators of 
computational pathology implementation in histopathology

der Laak
*Radboudumc, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Computational pathology algorithms 
detect, segment or classify cancer in whole slide images in histo-
pathology. Currently, challenges have to be overcome before they 
can be used. We aim to explore international perspectives on the 
role of computational pathology in clinical practice.
Methods: We will focus on opinions and first experiences regarding 
barriers and facilitators, which will inform establishment of validation 
studies, implementation trajectories and communication activities 
to generate widespread stakeholder acceptance. We conducted 
an international explorative eSurvey study and semi-structured 
interviews with pathologists and pathology residents. We used an 
implementation framework to classify potential influencing factors.
Results: Results of the eSurvey showed remarkable variation in 
opinions regarding attitude, understandability and validation of 
computational pathology. Results of the interviews showed that 
barriers focused on the quality of available evidence, while most 
facilitators concerned strengths of using computational pathol-
ogy. A lack of consensus was present for multiple barriers and 
facilitators, such as the determination of sufficient validation using 
computational pathology, the preferred function of computational 
pathology within the digital workflow and the appropriate timing 
of computational pathology introduction in pathology education.

Conclusion: The diversity in opinions illustrates variety in barriers 
and facilitators in computational pathology implementation. A next 
step would be to quantitatively determine important influencing 
factors among all relevant stakeholders. Simultaneously, prospec-
tive validation studies may be developed and initiated, to collect 
evidence on the most effective way of implementation. This will 
further propel the use of computational pathology into clinical 
practice.

breast cancer molecular subtypes

Wegscheider, P. Bult, F. Ciompi, J. van der Laak
*Radboudumc, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Breast cancer grading was introduced 
decades ago and its prognostic value has not yet been studied in 
the context of contemporary molecular classification. This study 
uses automatic mitotic count to evaluate its prognostic value for 
different breast cancer molecular subtypes.
Methods: A previously developed artificial intelligence (AI) algo-
rithm detected mitoses and assessed mitotic counts in H&E-stained 
whole-slide images from a multicentre cohort of 846 breast cancer 
patients. Stratified analyses based on hormonal receptor (HR) and 
HER2 status were performed to study potential different prognostic 
mitotic cut off values. Multivariable Cox regression survival mod-
els were used to study its independent prognostic value.
Results: We found that the mitotic count, assessed by AI was prog-
nostic in univariate Cox analysis for HR positive / HER2 negative 
breast cancers, applying the widely used Nottingham cut-offs, both 
for recurrence free and overall survival. Prognostic value could 
be optimized applying a cut-off of 10 mitoses per 2 mm2 (recur-
rence free survival hazard ratio = 2.05 (1.14-3.68; p=0.02); overall 
survival hazard ratio = 1.84 (1.09-3.11; p=0.02) in multivariable 
analysis). However, for HER2-positive tumours, no mitotic cut off 
was found to be prognostic.
Conclusion: This study shows that automatic mitotic count yields 
different prognostic information for specific subtypes of breast can-
cer, suggesting the need for a molecular subtype specific grading 
assessment in clinical practice. In addition, it showed the potential 
of AI to automate part of the pathologists’ workflow, as well as 
the feasibility of applying modern AI technologies to re-assess 
widely used histopathological features by evaluating large numbers 
of cases in a systematic, accurate and reproducible manner.

San Gerardo Hospital, University of Milan-Bicocca, Monza, Italy
Background & objectives: Identifying new prognostic features 
in colon cancer may refine histopathology review. While prog-
nostic artificial intelligence (AI) systems have demonstrated sig-
nificant risk stratification in several cancer types, studies have not 
yet shown that the machine learned features are interpretable by 
pathologists.
Methods: This retrospective study utilized de-identified, archived 
colorectal cancer cases from 2013 to 2015 from University of 
Milano-Bicocca (UNIMIB). Histologic slides from 258 consecu-
tive colon adenocarcinoma cases were reviewed at UNIMIB by two 
institutional pathologists. The pathologists conducted semiquanti-
tative scoring for Tumor Adipose Feature (TAF), which was previ-
ously identified via a prognostic deep-learning model developed 
using an independent colorectal cancer cohort.
Results: 258 colon adenocarcinoma histopathology cases from 258 
patients (median age 67 years; interquartile range 65-81; 47% female) 
with stage II (n=122) or stage III (n=139) cancer were included. 
TAF was identified in 120 cases (widespread n=63; multifocal n=31; 
unifocal n=26). For OS analysis adjusting for tumour stage, TAF was 
independently prognostic: Hazard Ratio (HR)=1.55 (95%CI 1.07-
2.25; p=0.02) for TAF as a binary feature (presence vs. absence); 
and HR=1.87 (95%CI 1.23-2.85; p<0.005) for the highest TAF 
category (widespread) when evaluating semiquantitative scoring. 
Inter-pathologist agreement for widespread TAF vs. lower categories 
(absent/unifocal/multifocal) was 90%, corresponding to kappa at this 
threshold of 0.69 (95%CI 0.58-0.80).
Conclusion: Pathologists were able to learn and reproducibly score 
for TAF providing significant risk stratification on this independent 
dataset. While additional work is warranted to understand the 
biological significance of this feature and to establish broadly 
reproducible TAF scoring, this work represents an important 
milestone as the first validation of human expert learning from 
machine learning in pathology. This validation demonstrates that 
a computationally identified histologic feature can represent a 
human-identifiable, prognostic biomarker with the potential for 
integration into pathology practice.

Background & objectives: Most human cancer genomes exhibit 
multiple mutational signatures, reflecting the complex milieu of 
damage and repair occurring during carcinogenesis. We used a 
robustly controlled, highly powered in vivo experiment to investi-
gate genotype-phenotype correlates.
Methods: Inbred mice were exposed to a single dose of diethylni-
trosamine shortly after birth. Resultant liver tumours were isolated 
and submitted for WGS, total RNAseq, and histopathology. This 
cohort was used to discover lesion segregation, which drives can-
cer genome evolution. We used deep learning to segment nuclei in 
these images, computed quantitative morphometric features, and 
modelled these using machine learning.
Results: We find that supervised learning of quantitative nuclear 
morphology robustly predicts (i) germline variation between ances-
trally divergent mouse strains, (ii) germline heterozygosity within 
strain, and (iii) somatic mutations in driver oncogenes. We apply a 
game-theoretic approach to uncover morphometric features which 
explain the inference, identifying nuclear geometry as key to infer-
ring driver gene mutations, and nuclear histochemical staining most

relevant for germline variation. Interestingly, we often find that 
statistical measures of variance in morphology are more relevant 
than measures of central tendency, and that the relationships are 
frequently non-linear and best modelled using tree ensembles. We 
further uncover pervasive batch effects and describe an approach 
to address these.
Conclusion: We defined quantitative relationships between histo-
logical phenotype and both germline and somatic genetic variation 
in tumour tissue using explainable machine learning. This approach 
has the potential to influence how clinical grade molecular inference 
models are optimised for generalisability in the future and allow 
histopathologists to gain intuition into the predictions made by deep 
models.

Background & objectives: This project aimed to validate, 
clinically deploy and integrate an AI decision support solution for 
prostate biopsies into the digital pathology workflow as a first read 
for primary diagnosis.
Methods: The project included a technical validation and integra-
tion phase of the AI solution into the lab workflow prior to the 
deployment. Seven pathologists underwent training and used the 
solution for prospective primary diagnosis of consecutive prostate 
core needle biopsies, reporting on 334 cases (1197 H&E slides). 
AI-assisted diagnoses were compared to the ground truth (GT = 
concordance of two pathologists).
Results: The AI solution demonstrated high performance when 
pre-classifying slides with highest likelihood to be benign or malig-
nant, with NPV = 98.8% (331 / 335) and PPV = 99.8% (399 / 400), 
respectively. 32% of slides have been classified as undetermined by 
AI. In 4 out of 7 discrepancies that were compared subsequently to 
the GT, the AI classification was correct. User experience survey, 
as reported by pathologists, showed high satisfaction marks for the 
AI solution. Pathologists felt more confident to review and report 
both benign and cancerous slides using the AI system and prefer 
to continue working with the system compared to a microscope.
Conclusion: We report here successful implementation of a multi 
feature AI solution that automatically imparts clinically relevant 
diagnostic parameters regarding prostate cancer and other patho-
logic features. The solution demonstrated its ability to accurately 
triage cancerous prostate cases and improve diagnostic quality. 
Thus, Galen Prostate AI solution could be used as significant 
aiding tool for pathologists in clinical decision-making in routine 
pathology practice.

Comparison of whole genome with broad gene panel sequencing 
to identify actionable targets for cancer treatment
D. Leunissen*, L. Kester, E. Driehuis, A. zur Hausen, P. Van Diest, 
W. de Leng, E. Speel
*Maastricht UMC+, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: DNA mutation analysis by broad panel 
NGS and WGS is currently used to guide cancer treatment. WGS 
can detect all genetic alterations, however, its implementation in 
daily clinic holds practical considerations. We evaluated the poten-
tial of WGS alternatives in diagnostics.
Methods: Publicly available WGS data of lung (n=86), colon 
(n=118), melanoma (n=63) and ovarian (n=42) cancers was used 
to identify clinically relevant variants using variant interpretation 
software (VarSome Clinical). We compared reported variants 
between the whole genome and targeted panels and their clinical 
relevance in Dutch routine care or clinical trials.
Results: For each tumour type unique single nucleotide variants 
were identified (on average 1834 (likely) pathogenic variants 
(LPV) per tumour type). Structural variants were not included 
in this study. After applying in silico filters for commercially 
available cancer hotspot panel (CHP), Foundation Medicine (FMI) 
and TSO500 panels (50, 324 and 523 genes, respectively), of the 
LPV detected by WGS, an average of 12.4%, 6.6% and 3.5% was 
predicted to be detected by TSO500, FMI and CHP, respectively. 
Of the detected variants, all that were deemed clinically relevant 
were detected by the broad TSO500 and FMI gene panels while 
15% would be missed using a smaller CHP gene panel.
Conclusion: Of the clinically actionable LPV detected by WGS in 
four tumour types, 100% is assumed to be identified by broad gene 
panels NGS (TSO500, FMI) and 85% by CHP. We conclude that 
in current clinical practice, the added value of WGS compared to 
broad gene panels is limited for clinically actionable single nucleo-
tide variant detection in the tumour types analysed.

*Illumina, Inc., USA
Background & objectives: ­TruSightTM Oncology Comprehensive 
(TSO Comp) is a CE-marked comprehensive genomic profiling 
(CGP) assay designed to interrogate solid tumours for relevant 
single nucleotide variants, multi-nucleotide variants, insertions, 
deletions and gene amplifications from DNA, and gene fusions and 
splice variants from RNA.
Methods: It is an enrichment-based next-generation sequencing 
assay that targets 517 genes for detection of small DNA variants, 
2 genes for detection of gene amplifications, 23 genes for detection 
of gene fusions and 2 genes for detection of splice variants. TSO 
Comp performance was evaluated in various analytical studies, 
including limit of detection/blank, accuracy, precision, utilizing 
FFPE-derived DNA and/or RNA samples.
Results: Performance of the assay was assessed for multiple vari-
ant classes: small variants and gene amplifications (amps) from

DNA, TMB and MSI genomic signatures in DNA, as well as RNA 
fusions and splice variants.
Limit of Detection was as low as 1.6% variant allele frequency 
for small DNA variants, 2-fold change for gene amps, 10 support-
ing reads for fusions, and 19 supporting reads for splice variants. 
Specificity was 99.9999% for small DNA variants, 99.9% for 
fusion variants and 100% for gene amps and MSI. Positive Percent 
Agreement (PPA) with whole exome sequencing (WES) for small 
DNA variants was 84.7% (382/451) for WES somatic and 99.8% 
(33,163/33,224) for WES germline variants.
Conclusion: DNA small variant Negative Percent Agreement was 
99.999% (70,000,481/70,000,907). PPA for gene amps was 92.3% 
(337/365), for MSI status 93% (40/43). PPA for RNA fusions and 
for RNA splice variants was 80.5% (70/87). Qualitative precision 
analysis across multiple operators, instruments, reagent lots, and 
days showed high concordance (>90% positive percent call).
This CGP assay helps maximize the ability to find actionable bio-
markers and help inform therapy decisions according to clinical 
guidelines that have the potential to improve patient management.

Evaluation of MET amplification in lung cancer via Idylla™ 
GeneFusion cartridges
J. Siemanowski*, V. Welter, A. Ehteschami, A. Quaas, S. 
Merkelbach-Bruse
*University hospital Cologne, Germany
Background & objectives: MET amplification in lung cancer 
is known as resistance mechanism to epidermal growth factor 
receptor tyrosine–kinase inhibitors. This retrospective study used 
Idylla™ GeneFusion assay (Biocartis) cartridges to develop a delta 
Cq cut-off for discrimination of non-amplified versus MET ampli-
fied samples.
Methods: A cohort of 70 samples including 31 non-amplified and 
39 MET amplified samples was analysed. MET amplification sta-
tus was previously detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH). One to five 10 μm slices with a tumour cell content (TC) 
between 10% and 90% of the same FFPE tumour tissues were taken 
for analysis with the ­IdyllaTM GeneFusion Assay.
Results: For initial data analysis a threshold of -3.0 (Delta 
housekeeping gene-MET) was used for discrimination between 
non-amplified and MET amplified samples. Hereby 27 out of 31 
non-amplified samples (specificity= 87%) and 26 out of 39 MET 
amplified samples (sensitivity=67%) were detected. After a threshold 
adjustment from -3.0 to -2.0 the specificity was lowered to 74% 
(23/31 non-amplified samples) but sensitivity increased to 84% (33/39 
MET amplified samples). No further optimization was reached by 
implementing a % TC cut-off since false positives and false negatives 
were distributed at different TC content. All top-level amplifications 
(copy number gain (CNG) > 10) were true positive.
Conclusion: This study showed that the ­IdyllaTM GeneFusion 
Assay might be a promising screening tool for top level MET 
amplification assessment in lung cancer samples. Nevertheless, 
even after threshold adjustment both specificity and sensitivity 
within different levels of MET amplification remained lower than 
90%. Therefore, this test with our proposed cut-off is not suited 
to identify MET amplification at lower thresholds. This is in line 
with other published PCR-based approaches using for example next 
generation sequencing.

Shallow whole genome sequencing accurately detects homolo-
gous recombination deficiency in ovarian cancer
J. Dagher*, N. Scamuffa, V. Vocat-Mottier, K. Lefort, L. de Leval, 
B. Bisig, E. Missiaglia
*Institute of Pathology, CHUV, Switzerland
Background & objectives: Homologous Recombination Deficiency 
(HRD) predicts benefit from PARP inhibitors. MyChoiceCDx test 
(Myriad) is approved to assess HRD, based on BRCA1/2 mutations 
and genomic instability (GIS) score. We assessed HRD by shallow 
whole-genome sequencing (sWGS) using Large-scale Genomic Altera-
tion (LGA) score.
Methods: Fifteen high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas underwent 
sWGS on a NextSeq550 (Illumina), using FFPE-extracted DNA 
(tumour content ≥25%). All samples had known tumour BRCA1/2 
status (9 mutated, 6 wild-type), while 9 also had Myriad GIS score 
available. Raw reads were aligned to hg19 human genome assembly 
and analysed using shallowHRD software to compute LGA score, 
which was considered positive if ≥20.
Results: We successfully performed sWGS on all samples, generat-
ing an average of 22 million (M) reads per sample (11-42M) and 
achieving a mean coverage of 0.8X (0.3X-1.6X). LGA computation 
was still robust by artificially down-sampling to 5M reads (0.2X 
coverage). LGA score was positive in 8/9 BRCA​-mutated cases, 
and negative in all wild-type cases (median 26 (11-40) vs. 6.5 
(0-14), Wilcoxon rank test P=0.004). Correlation between LGA 
and GIS scores was statistically significant (Spearman rank rho 
0.78; P=0.014), with only 1/9 cases showing discordant results. 
This was a BRCA​ wild-type sample with positive GIS score but 
negative LGA score, presumably due to low tumour cell content 
(25%) and low DNA quality.
Conclusion: In our series of 15 high-grade serous ovarian carci-
nomas, determination of LGA score by sWGS – using a predefined 
positivity cut-off ≥20 – was highly concordant with both BRCA1/2 
mutational status and Myriad GIS score. Despite a limited number 
of samples analysed so far, this preliminary cohort shows promis-
ing results, supporting further work to refine the cut-off value(s) 
and validate this tool as a predictive molecular biomarker for PARP 
inhibitor therapy, for patients with ovarian cancer or potentially 
other malignancies.

Veloza Cabrera, K. Lefort, B. Bisig, L. de Leval, E. Missiaglia*
*Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Lausanne (CHUV), 
Switzerland
Background & objectives: Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a 
consequence of defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR), leading 
to a hypermutant phenotype, with a high tumour mutational burden 
(TMB). We explored the potential impact of MSI in the oncogen-
esis of primary intestinal T-cell lymphomas (ITCLs).
Methods: Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed on 54 
ITCLs and matched non-tumour DNA: 34 MEITLs (Monomor-
phic Epitheliotropic Intestinal T-cell Lymphomas) and 20 EATLs 
(Enteropathy-Associated T-cell Lymphomas). Mutation signatures 
were extracted from somatic variants and compared with COSMIC 
reference signatures (MuSiCa package). MSI status was predicted 
from instability scores (MANTIS software), and assessed by PCR 
(5 mononucleotide markers) on 43 samples.
Results: We observed an overall median TMB of 1.8 non-syn-
onymous somatic mutations per Mb, with a higher median in 
EATLs relative to MEITLs (2.3 vs 1.7/Mb). Nonetheless, the 
highest TMBs were detected in three MEITLs (maximum: 15/
Mb). Accordingly, these three cases showed signatures associated 
with MMR deficiency, and high instability scores as measured

by MANTIS. Their MSI status was confirmed by standard PCR 
analyses, while none of the other MEITLs or EATLs showed insta-
bility. Altogether, our analyses estimated a prevalence of MSI 
of 11% (3/28) in the MEITL subtype. Notably, none of the MSI 
samples presented somatic mutations within MMR pathway genes 
(MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6), suggesting alternative mutagenic 
mechanisms.
Conclusion: Taken together, these data reveal a relatively high 
TMB in ITCLs when compared to other peripheral T-cell lym-
phomas, and an MSI status in a subset of MEITLs. This suggests 
a role of MMR deficiency in the oncogenesis of a proportion of 
ITCLs, with potential clinical implications. Alternative muta-
genic mechanisms, possibly involving the intestinal environ-
ment, seem to play a role in the tumorigenesis of the majority 
of ITCLs.

Hekmat, M. Heldwein, G. Schlachtenberger, D. Horst, M. Drago-
mir, J. Rückert, N. Frost, F. Leiss, M. Alber, F. Klauschen
*Aignostics, Germany
Background & objectives: We present an AI-driven image 
analysis workflow combining histomorphological and multiplex 
immunofluorescence data for automated, cell-level characterization 
of the tumour microenvironment (TME) that can facilitate 
biomarker identification. The workflow is utilized for the 
exploration of a clinical NSCLC cohort.
Methods: 340 clinical NSCLC cases from an FFPE tissue micro-
array were stained with a 12-plex immunofluorescence panel (IF) 
and subsequently with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). All stains 
were scanned and co-registered with single cell accuracy. Deep 
learning models were developed to detect tumour regions from 
H&E and cell subtypes from IF and H&E. The resulting readouts 
were correlated with clinical parameters.
Results: Deep learning models were trained to quantify the 
presence of tumour cells expressing PD-L1 and lymphocyte 
cell subtypes. For the task of separating PD-L1+ carcinoma, 
PD-L1- carcinoma and other cells a balanced accuracy (BA) of 
92% was reached. The task of separating FoxP3+ T-cells, CD8+ 
T-cells and B-cells respectively from other cells was performed 
with a BA of > 90%. The models were trained and evaluated 
using over 13,000 IF-informed manual pathologist annotations. 
The evaluation was performed on a held out TMA section with 
separate cases. The correlation of PD-L1 expression and vari-
ous tumour infiltrating lymphocyte subpopulation levels with 
patient prognosis and other clinical parameters was computed.
Conclusion: The presented workflow allows for scalable char-
acterization of the NSCLC TME by (1) staining the same sec-
tion with H&E and multiplex IF images and registering result-
ing scans and (2) applying deep learning for robust cell subtype 
detection from both modalities at once. First results show that 
cells involved in the immune response within the TME can be 
precisely quantified and correlated with clinical parameters.

*Department of Pathology, Saitama Medical University Interna-
tional Medical Center, Japan
Background & objectives: Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) 
is a zinc-finger transcription factor initially isolated from a human 
insulinoma subtraction library. INSM1 was recently demonstrated to 
be a better diagnostic and prognostic indicator for small cell lung 
carcinoma than the traditional neuroendocrine (NE) markers.
Methods: Herein, for the first time, we present eight cases with 
NE phenotype mammary neoplasms in which the NE nature of the 
tumours was confirmed solely by INSM1. Patients were 35–64 
(mean: 48.9) year-old women with breast tumours showing char-
acteristic NE morphologies, i.e. solid growth of polygonal, short-
spindle or plasmacytoid cells with fine-granular cytoplasm and 
nuclei, and a well-developed vascular network.
Results: On immunohistochemical examinations, these 
malignancies showed diffuse nuclear expressions of INSM1 
(mouse monoclonal, clone A-8: sc-271408, dilution 1:100; Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX), whereas chromogranin 
A [three sources: 1) mouse monoclonal, clone LK2H10; 
Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany, 2) rabbit polyclonal, 
dilution 1:500; Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark, and 3) rabbit 
polyclonal, 412751; Nichirei Bioscience Inc., Tokyo, Japan] 
and synaptophysin [two sources: 1) rabbit polyclonal, dilution 
1:50; Dako, and 2) mouse monoclonal, clone 27G12: 413831; 
Nichirei] staining did not correspond to distinct NE features in 
the neoplastic cytoplasm. Finally, we diagnosed these cancers 
of luminal-like immuno-subtype as 4 neuroendocrine neoplasms 
(NENs), three hypercellular mucinous carcinomas, and one 
neuroendocrine ductal carcinoma in situ.
Conclusion: Based on the establishment of INSM1, a promising 
NE marker with high sensitivity and specificity, accompanied by 
our current immunohistochemical results, the frequency of detect-
ing NE differentiation in systemic neoplasms, including mammary 
NENs as well as carcinomas with NE differentiation such as type B 
mucoid carcinoma and solid papillary carcinoma, is anticipated to 
increase. Our observations might contribute to the development of 
novel treatments including molecular-targeted therapies for these 
tumour entities.

Background & objectives: PRAME (PReferentially expressed 
Antigen in MElanoma) is a carcinoma testis antigen expressed 
in numerous tumour types. The aim of this study was to assess 
PRAME expression in different surrogate subtypes of breast car-
cinoma and its correlation with other prognostic factors.

Methods: A total of 25 Luminal A like, 31 Luminal B like, 15 
triple negative (TN) and 18 HER2 positive breast carcinomas were 
assessed for PRAME expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
using the EPR20330 (ab219650; Abcam) monoclonal antibody. 
Expression of PRAME was quantified as positive (nuclear and/
or cytoplasmic staining) or negative, and also as a percentage of 
tumour cells expressing PRAME.
Results: A significantly higher expression of PRAME was detected 
in HER2 positive carcinomas and TN breast carcinomas com-
pared to ER positive (luminal like) subtype of breast carcinomas. 
PRAME expression was detected in 53% (8/15) TN carcinomas 
and 72% (13/18) HER2 positive carcinomas, as opposed to luminal 
A and B like breast carcinomas, where it was expressed in 32% 
(8/25) and 26% (8/31) of cases, respectively. Percentage of PRAME 
positive tumour cells showed positive correlation with tumour size, 
Ki67 proliferation index, HER2 status, nuclear grade and presence 
of metastasis, and negative correlation with ER status.
Conclusion: Previous studies on PRAME in breast carcinoma were 
mainly based on RT-PCR detection, with immunohistochemical 
studies limited to polyclonal antibody results. Our study showed 
that HER2 positive and TN breast carcinomas more commonly 
express PRAME than ER positive carcinomas and that PRAME 
expression shows positive correlation with certain prognostic fac-
tors. The importance of PRAME expression in breast carcinoma 
lies in its potential use as an immunotherapeutic target, particu-
larly in patients with limited therapeutic options (e.g. in TN 
carcinomas).

Alpha-methylacyl-CoA Racemase (AMACR/P504S) over-
expression occurs in the early proliferative lesions of the breast 
irrespective of apocrine differentiation
Z. Gatalica, P. Stafford, S. Vranic*
*Qatar University, Qatar
Background & objectives: Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase 
(AMACR/P504S) is a mitochondrial and peroxisomal enzyme 
involved in the branched-chain fatty acid and bile acid metabo-
lism. We explored AMACR expression in a large cohort of 
patients undergoing breast biopsies to investigate its role in cancer 
progression.
Methods: The first, exploratory cohort of all cancer types (Caris 
Life Sciences) was investigated for AMACR mRNA expression 
followed by the second cohort of 150 patients’ breast biopsies 
(77 with invasive carcinomas) studied for the discrete lesions’ 
expression of AMACR using an automated IHC. The lesions were 
considered positive if AMACR was detected in ≥10% of the cells.
Results: AMACR mRNA expression was detected in all cancer 
types and in breast carcinoma, its median value was substantially 
and consistently lower than in prostate carcinomas. However, 
AMACR protein expression was detected not only in apocrine 
carcinomas, as recently described, but also in normal breast 
epithelium (6/77 samples, 8%), and with increased frequency 
in proliferative epithelial lesions and carcinomas: 23% of 
UDH, 73% of ADH and in-situ carcinomas, 60% of invasive 
carcinomas, including lymph node/distant metastases. LCIS and 
invasive lobular carcinomas expressed AMACR in 50% of cases, 
respectively. Apocrine lesions showed strong, nearly uniform 
overexpression of AMACR (100% of metaplasias, hyperplasias, 
and in situ carcinomas and 88% of invasive apocrine carcinomas).
Conclusion: AMACR expression in the breast is a common, early 
pathogenic event in the development of breast carcinoma and not 
exclusive to the apocrine morphology. It points to altered lipid 
metabolism as one of the hallmarks of breast carcinogenesis, simi-
lar to several other malignancies, notably prostate carcinoma. It 
may hence represent a potential target for early cancer intervention 
and management.

*Histology-Embryology Lab., Medical Department, Democritus 
University of Thrace, Alexadroupolis, Greece
Background & objectives: NLRP3 belongs to a complex of pro-
teins triggering proteolytic degradation via caspase-1. This molec-
ular pathway is involved in breast oncogenesis. The purpose of 
our research was the investigation of NLRP3 expression in breast 
cancer and its association with clinicohistopathological factors.
Methods: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast tissues 
from 43 patients were studied. 31 of them diagnosed with 
breast cancer (study group) and the other 12 (control group) 
diagnosed with fibroadenoma. NLRP3’s expression was inves-
tigated immunohistochemically using a monoclonal anti-NLRP3 
antibody. NLRP3 expression was statistically associated with 
various clinical and histological parameters using the SPSS 
program.
Results: Our results showed statistically significantly higher 
expression of NLRP3 in well- differentiated carcinomas G3 
(p<0.005), a tendency for higher NLRP3 expression in carcinomas 
with severe Ki-67 expression (p< 0.01) and also with the presence 
of lymph node metastases (p<0.022). In contrast, no statistically 
significant correlation was observed between NLRP3 expression 
and patient age (p=0.662), expression of ER (p=0.236) and PR 
(p=0.244), HER2 gene expression (p=0.342) and the cancer type 
(p=0.871).
Conclusion: Based in our results, we conclude that NLRP3 could 
be a potential breast cancer biomarker as its high immunohisto-
chemical expression is directly linked to advanced breast cancer. 
However, this is just a preliminary study and a more extended 
research needs to be conducted in order to establish these outcomes.

Mercado, I. Amat
*Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: The diagnosis of Encapsulated Papil-
lary Carcinoma (EPC) of the breast is challenging. These lesions 
are staged as lesions in situ, and it is not possible to confirm EPC 
diagnosis until the capsule has been examined to rule out invasive 
growth.
Methods: All the cases treated at our institution since 2005 are 
reviewed. To analyse the involvement of sentinel lymph nodes, as 
the indication for their study is controversial. We have collected 54 
patients who were treated surgically for EPC. Selective SLN biopsy 
was performed in 39 (72%) of them.
Results: We have observed that the mean size of EPC was 12 
millimetres. The Nottingham grade was 1 in 46 cases (85.1%), 2 in 
6 cases (11.1%) and 3 in 2 cases (3.7%). EPC was associated with 
invasive carcinoma in 17 cases (31.4%).
Of the 39 patients in whom SN was performed, only three cases 
(5.5%) showed invasion, whereas one was ITC, and 2 micrometas-
tases. In these three patients, the EPC showed invasion between 
3 and 8 mm.

Conclusion:
-SLN involvement is very low in our series of EPC (5.5%).
-The frequences of EPC without infiltration and invasive carcinoma 
are 0% and 11%, respectively.
-The presence of invasive carcinoma is only confirmed in the surgi-
cal specimen.
-Therefore, we suggest assessing the indication for SLN in those 
cases where invasive carcinoma is confirmed.

Applicability of One Step Nucleic Acid in cytokeratin 19 nega-
tive tumours, based on a series of cases
A. Córdoba*, M. Bronte, I. Fernandez, I. Amat, R. Beloqui, A. 
Larrea
*Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: The One Step Nucleic Acid (OSNA)is 
a molecular technique for the study of sentinel lymph node (SLN) 
in breast carcinomas. There is no general agreement on the low-
est limit of detection of CK19 expression. A cut-off of 30% is 
proposed.
Methods: We analysed the expression of CK19 in BC diagnosed 
in our institution since May 2018 and selected those cases with 
negative or partial expression of CK19. A total of 1189 cases of 
BC biopsied in our hospital were reviewed, taking the cut-off value 
of 30%. In the selected cases, tumour type, grade and phenotype 
were included.
Results: 23 cases out of 1189 biopsies (1.93%) showed negative 
or partial CK19 expression. 19 cases (82.6%) showed less than 
30% expression and four cases showed focal positivity >than 
30%. 21 cases (91.3%) were invasive carcinoma-NOS with 15 
(65.2%) being grade 1 and 2, one metaplastic carcinoma and 
one solid papillary carcinoma. The most frequent phenotype 
was luminal A (52.1%). In all cases with minimal and/
or moderate expression (<30%), SLN study by traditional 
histological examination was recommended. Axillary lymph 
node metastasis was observed in 6 cases, in which no CK19 
expression was verified by immunohistochemistry (IHC). In 
the 4 cases studied by OSNA, micrometastases was found in 
1, CK19 negative.
Conclusion: The assessment of CK19 in tumour cells can be 
challenging in cases with partial positivity.
The majority of CK19-negative cases in our series are low-grade 
tumours, in contrast to previous evidence describing this finding 
in more aggressive tumours (intermediate-high grade and/or triple 
negative tumours).
A cut-off point of 30% in the assessment of CK19 IHC expression 
is considered an appropriate value in tumours with partial positivity 
to perform the OSNA technique, as evidenced in our series.

Gross examination of post neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) 
breast resections in resource constraint setting – how much is 
enough?
P. Shah*, S. Desai, T. Shet
*Tata Memorial Hospital, India
Background & objectives: Post-NACT breast carcinoma gross 
examination poses a challenge when primary tumour is not 
localized with a radio-opaque wire/clip – a situation common in 
resource-constrained settings. We undertook a blinded study on 
two grossing approaches demonstrating how much sampling is 
adequate.
Methods: Fifty breast carcinoma cases were grossed prospec-
tively by a single pathologist (n=50). Tumour bed was localized 
by clinico-radiological and visual correlation only. Tumour bed 
was submitted entirely in grids of multiple slices (Method 1) and 
one slice was marked as the one with maximum tumour bed area 
(Method 2). Kappa values were calculated to evaluate agreement 
between the two methods.
Results: Twenty patients underwent breast conservation surgery; 
whereas 30 patients underwent mastectomy. Mean of 8 blocks 
per case were prepared for a single slice (Method 2); whereas 
26 blocks were prepared from sampling of entire tumour bed 
(Method 1). Pathological complete response (pCR) by both 
methods was calculated to analyse non-pCR cases missed by 
Method 2. Method 2 documented 23 cases with pCR of which 
21 were picked up in Method 1.The two cases missed by Method 
2 had minimal residual disease with <2 mm residual tumour 
(RCB I).The concordance of the two methods was 91.3%. Kappa 
value for Method 2 was 0.919 thus demonstrating very good 
correlation with Method 1.
Conclusion: Submitting slice of largest visible tumour bed 
captures 90% of pCR and RCB accurately. In resource-constrained 
settings, this would be a viable substitute option for primary 
tumour not localized prior to NACT by radio-opaque wire/clip. The 
average cost of 1 Hematoxylin and Eosin stained slide is INR.100 
(equivalent to approximately 1$). The method 2 was shown to 
curtail the expenditure to 33%. RCB class could also be assigned 
using this technique.

Ayadi, R. Chargui, M. Driss
*Forces de Securité Interieure, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Breast cancers with positive expression 
of hormone receptor and overexpression of HER2/neu, are called 
“triple positive breast cancers TPBC”.Data is relatively limited 
on TPBC. We aim to characterize the clinical and pathological 
features associated with TPBC and study their responses to neo-
adjuvant chemotherapy.
Methods: Clinicopathologic data associated with TPBC from 
2015 to 2021 were retrieved from our pathology database. A 
variety of clinicopathologic parameters, including patient age, 
tumour Nottingham grade, HER2 IHC status, tumour necrosis, 
and frequency of pathologically-determined complete response to 
neoadjuvant treatment (PCR).
Results: Of 123 consecutive TPBC, all cases were invasive ductal 
carcinomas. The mean age was 52 years with extremities of 26 
and 102 years. TPBCs were more often of Nottingham grade II 
in 78 cases (63%). TPBC were node-positive in 63 cases (52%) 
and were less often IHC 3+ in 80 cases (65%). Tumoural necrosis 
was observed in 78% (n=96). Among the patients that underwent 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, PCR was achieved in 3 of 20 (15%) 
TPBC.
Conclusion: In our study, TPBC are associated with Nottingham 
grade and higher rate of node-positivity. Notably, these tumours 
show lower rate of complete pathologic response to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy.

Background & objectives: Matrix metalloproteinase-2(MMP-2) 
plays a role in the invasion and metastasis of cancer through the 
destruction of the basal membrane and extracellular matrix. The 
study aimed to investigate MMP-2 expression levels in breast 
cancer(BC) and its relationships with lymph nodes status.
Methods: We tested the expression of MMP-2 in 358 BC 
specimens with immunohistochemistry (EPR1184, Abcam, USA). 
All cases were divided into two groups according to intensity of 
stained tumour cells (negative and mild vs strong cytoplasmic 
expression). MMP-2 positivity was detected in most cases (262, 
72.2%). Nevertheless, strong positive expression (>50% tumour 
cells,3+) was only in every fifth case (78, 22%).
Results: Statistical significant association was found 
between MMP-2 overexpression(3+) and tumour size(pT2-3)
(HR=34.05,p<0.001); Grade3(HR=73.08,p<0.001); ER(0-2 
score, Allred)(HR=15.91,p<0.001); PgR(0-2 score, Allred)
(HR=13.83,p<0.001); Ki-67≥50%(HR=68.58,p<0.001). There is 
loss of MMP-2 expression in most luminal A BC(93.8%). There was 
no statistically significant correlation of MMP-2 expression with 
patient’s age, number of tumour nodes, its localization, histological 
type,HER2/neu expression. A significant relationship was found 
between MMP-2 expression and regional metastasis(р<0,001). In 
the group with lymph nodes BC metastases the number of cases 
with MMP-2 overexpression was higher (52 cases,66,7%) than in 
the group without lymph nodes metastases(26 cases,28.6%). There 
was negative MMP-2 expression(-) in 86 cases(38.1%) in the group 
without lymph nodes metastases vs the group with lymph nodes BC 
metastases (10cases,7,6%)( р<0,001).
Conclusion: Identification of specific biomarkers is very impor-
tant for prediction of regional metastases. We demonstrated that 
MMP-2 expression is associated with clinicopathological param-
eters of BC and its lymph nodes status. Loss of MMP-2 expression 
is statistically significantly reduced risk of lymph nodes metastases 
(p<0.001). Loss of MMP-2 expression was predominant in BC with 
pT1, Grade I-II, ER-positive, PgR-positive, Ki-67-low parameters. 
These results suggest that MMP-2 plays a role in the biology of BC.

Sentinel lymph node localization with Magtrace. Our experi-
ence so far
E. Panopoulou, E. Koniaris*, A. Stylianaki, G. Zografos, G. Kafiri
*Pathology Department, General hospital of Athens "Hippokratio", 
Greece
Background & objectives: Magtrace lymphatic tracer is a liquid 
non-radioactive tracer, specifically designed for sentinel lymph 
node biopsy, assisting surgeons to locate the first draining axillary 
lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph nodes (SL) are the first nodes most 
likely to be infiltrated by metastasis.
Methods: The cohort of our study consisted of 22 female patients 
aged 33-66, surgically treated (WLE or mastectomy) for breast 
cancer. All patients gave a written informed consent to participate 
in the experimental study with this lymphatic tracer. In one patient 
the technique was performed bilaterally. In all cases 1-6 SL were 
received in each patient, measuring 0,5-2 cm.
Results: Patients received the tracer 24 hours to 30 minutes prior 
to surgery. Macroscopically 1-6 SL were isolated and examined on 
frozen sections with H&E. SLN were totally enclosed and studied. 
Microscopically, increased presence of pigment laden macrophage 
aggregates was noted, found mainly in a central location in the 
node. Although the amount of the macrophage aggregates were 
striking, did not interfere with the correct diagnosis and was 
mainly found in one or two SL, indicating the first one or two 
SL. At present, common practice involves dual technique, Blue 
de Methylene or Patent blue in combination with radioactive 
technetium 99 and this technique doesn’t seem to be inferior.
Conclusion: Magtrace, even though a relatively new SLN tracer 
method, is a standardized technique with a steep learning and 
teaching curve, as 2-3 applications are sufficient. The main advan-
tages of this tracer are its safety, convenience, the non-stigmatizing 
technique for the patient, the significant lower allergy rates, the 
radiation free setting (reducing nuclear medicine dependency) 
and the longer half lifetime reaching up to one month. Overall, 
Magtrace has highly reproducible and accurate results and produces 
less discomfort for the patient.

Dardyk, L. Mikhaleva
*FSBI "V.I.Kulakov NMRC for OGP", Russia
Background & objectives: Forkhead box protein A1(FOXA1) 
promotes the transcription of a gene that induces luminal cell dif-
ferentiation and suppresses the processes of epithelial-mesenchy-
mal transition in breast cancer(BC). In our study, we purposed to 
investigate the relationship between FOXA1 and lymph node BC 
metastasis.
Methods: We tested the expression of FOXA1 in 358 BC 
specimens with immunohistochemistry (SP88,Abcam,USA). 
FOXA1-scoring was done according to the Allred system. Scores 
of 3-8 are considered positive. Tumours with score 0-4 were 
considered as FOXA1-low, whereas tumours with score 5-8 were 
considered as FOXA1-high. FOXA1-negative BC was detected in 
89 cases (25%). FOXA1-high expression was detected in 131 cases 
(36.6%).
Results: FOXA1-expression significantly correlates with 
clinicopathological and immunohistochemical parameters, 
including those that have a predictive value in the process of lymph 
node BC metastasis, such as the patient’s age(p=0.004), tumour 
node size(p=0.028), Grade(p=0.001), ER(p<0.001) and PgR-
expression(p=0.003), Ki-67(p<0.001). FOXA1-positive tumours 
were predominant in both comparing groups (with/without lymph 
nodes metastases-71.2% and 75.7%, respectively) (р=0.354). However, 
a significant relationship was found between the level of FOXA1 
expression and lymph node BC metastasis(p=0.010). The intensity of 
FOXA1 expression was higher in the group without lymph node BC 
metastasis 94 cases(41.6%) compared to the group with lymph node BC 
metastasis 37 cases(28.2%). No significant difference was obtained in 
the two compared groups for FOXA1-low expression(p=0.081).
Conclusion: FOXA1 was a significant independent prognostic 
factor for the lymph nodes BC metastases. The intensity of the 
marker expression has statistical significance (p=0.01). With mod-
erate FOXA1 expression, risk of lymph node metastasis decreases 
compared with weak staining of tumour cells. FOXA1-low expres-
sion reversely correlates with BC metastasis and progression and 
may serve as a prognostic biomarker for predicting lymph node 
metastasis.

Dardyk, V. Rodionov
*FSBI "V.I.Kulakov NMRC for OGP", Russia
Background & objectives: Solute carrier family7 
member5(SLC7A5), known as LAT1, is a transporter factor deliv-
ering amino acids to cancer cells.SLC7A5 is an important prog-
nostic marker of the breast cancer(BC) aggressive behaviour. This 
study aimed to investigate correlation between SLC7A5 expression 
and molecular subtypes.
Methods: We tested the expression of SLC7A5 in 358 BC speci-
mens by immunohistochemistry (PA5-34215, ThermoFisher, USA). 
Full membranous staining in >10% tumour cells was considered 
as positive. Moderate/strong SLC7A5-positive expression was 
detected in 199 cases (55.6%). Loss of SLC7A5 expression was 
detected only in 56 cases(15.6%). Strong membranous staining in 
>50% tumour cells was determined in a quarter of cases(26.5%).
Results: SLC7A5 expression was increased in BC with HER2/
neu overexpression, regardless of hormonal receptor status. Strong 
SLC7A5 expression was detected in 14 cases(66.7%) of luminal 
B HER2-positive subtype and in 12 cases (80%) of non-luminal 
HER2-positive subtype. There was no SLC7A5-negative BC cases 
with HER2/neu overexpression. In TN breast cancer and in luminal 
B subtypes, the transport protein was expressed more than in half 
cases, with approximately the same frequency in all three subtypes 
– 65%-66.7%. In luminal A subtype, cases with no SLC7A5 expres-
sion were 1.5 times more often (34 cases, 21%) than in luminal B 
HER2-negative BC (18 cases, 14.5%)(p<0.001).
Conclusion: We demonstrated that SLC7A5-expression is associ-
ated with molecular BC subtypes (p<0.001). SLC7A5-negative BC 
positively correlates with luminal-A subtype. The largest number 
of cases with strong SLC7A5 expression in >50% cancer cells 
was detected in cases of non-luminal BC subtype with HER2/neu 
overexpression. These results suggest that SLC7A5 plays a role in 
the biology of BC.

*Targos - A DLS company, Germany
Background & objectives: For HER2 assessment in Breast 
Cancer, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining is the method of 
choice. Here, we compare the clinical performance of the new 
CE-IVD-marked HercepTest™ mAb pharmDx (Dako Omnis) 
(GE001) with Ventana PATHWAY anti-HER-2/neu (4B5).
Methods: In total, 119 pre-selected breast cancer samples cover-
ing the entire range of HER2 IHC expression scores were tested 
by HercepTest (mAb), PATHWAY 4B5, and fluorescent in situ 
hybridization (FISH). Three pathologists independently evaluated 
HER2 IHC according to 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncol-
ogy/College of American Pathologists guidelines. Sensitivity and 
specificity of both IHC assays were assessed based on FISH data.
Results: There was a high concordance between results from the Her-
cepTest (mAb) and PATHWAY 4B5 assays for HER2-negative (IHC 
0, 1+, 2+ and FISH negative) and HER2-positive (IHC 3+, 2+ and 
FISH positive) breast carcinomas (98.2%). Regarding individual IHC 
scores, complete agreement was achieved in 69.7% (83/119) of cases 
and all but one of the discordant cases were due to higher HER2-status 
scoring using the HercepTest (mAb). Thus, more tumours were scored 
as IHC 2+ by HercepTest (mAb) (27 versus 15) as evidenced by their 
lower FISH positivity rate (48.1% versus 80%). However, two amplified 
tumours identified as IHC 2+ by HercepTest (mAb) were missed by 
PATHWAY 4B5 (IHC 1+).
Conclusion: The HercepTest (mAb) detects HER2 expression with 
higher sensitivity in tumours with gene amplification (ISH group 
1) and increased gene counts (ISH group 4) as well as in HER2-
low tumours (HER2 IHC 2+ / FISH negative or IHC 1+). These 
findings could be critical for the identification of patients eligible 
to new HER2-targeting treatment options. Future studies will dem-
onstrate whether this new assay has the capacity to provide better 
patient stratification, leading to better patient response rates and 
clinical outcomes.

Phosphohistone H3 versus mitotic count in breast cancer grad-
ing: a single institution study
N. Mansouri*, F. Gargouri, M. Ben Thayer, K. Tlili, R. Aouadi, I. 
Msakni, B. Laabidi
*Department of Pathology, Military Hospital of Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Mitotic index is an important prognosis 
marker in invasive breast carcinoma (BC). The aim of this study 
was to evaluate the utility of Phosphohistone H3 in grading of 
BC in comparison with mitotic count on hematoxylin and eosin-
stained slides.
Methods: A retrospective study on a series of 40 BCs diagnosed from 
March 2020 to August 2021 at the Pathology Department of the Mili-
tary Hospital of Tunis was performed. We compared grade variability 
according to the mitotic count on H&E-stained slides and on PHH3 
stained slides.
Results: Although, mean average count was higher by IHC method, 
good correlation was observed (R²=0.799). Using PHH3 IHC, three 
cases of grade I tumours were upgraded in to grade II and six cases 
of grade II were upgraded in to grade III. None of the tumours were 
downgraded.
Conclusion: In summary, we have performed the first study to 
explore the utility of PHH3 in breast cancer grading in Tunisia. 
Similar to some other previous studies, we found PHH3 a robust 
sensitive and practical marker for mitotic count in breast carcinoma. 
Especially it is helpful to identify the most proliferating area.

*University General Hospital and Alicante Institute for Health and 
Biomedical Research –ISABIAL-, Spain
Background & objectives: Immune checkpoints deregulation 
can lead to tumour progression and invasion. However, very little 
data is available on breast carcinoma (BC). Therefore, we analysed 
CTLA-4, PDCD1, CD274, PDCD1LG2, and CD276 expression 
in BC and their association with clinicopathological factors and 
survival.
Methods: We included 275 non-consecutive BC. mRNA expression 
was analysed by qRT-PCR using TaqMan® primers and probes. PUM1 
and β-actin were used as reference genes, and healthy breast tissue 
served as a calibrator. The 2-ΔΔCT calculated relative changes in 
expression. Results were correlated with clinicopathological factors 
and prognosis. Significant differences were calculated with χ2 and 
log-rank test.

Results: Overexpression of at least one immune checkpoint was 
found in 95.2% of samples. CTLA-4 was overexpressed mostly 
in Triple-Negative/Basal-like phenotypes (p=0.046), whereas 
PDCD1 and CD276 were more frequently found in Luminal 
tumours (all p<0.023). CD274 and PDCD1LG2 showed no 
correlation with immunophenotype. High CTLA-4, PDCD1, 
CD274 and PDCD1LG2 expression was associated with a mid-
dle/high proliferation rate (all p<0.039), and presence of TILs 
(all p<0.011), with opposite results for CD276 (p=0.048, and 
0.026, respectively). CTLA-4 overexpression correlated with 
better disease-free survival -DFS- (p=0.037), and specifically 
among HER2-enriched subtype (DFS p=0.033, and overall sur-
vival p=0.011).
Conclusion: Our data support that CTLA-4, PDCD1, CD274, and 
PDCD1LG2 are potential biomarkers of BC aggressiveness. Para-
doxically, CTLA-4 stratified a subgroup of HER2-enriched patients 
with a better outcome.

The malignancy of benignancy. The malignant consequences 
of benign breast tumours. Is the onus on pathologists? Post-
pregnancy associated infarcted fibroadenoma, a rapidly grow-
ing benign phyllodes tumour, a benign phyllodes tumour in an 
adolescent girl

Clayton
*Royal Surrey County Hospital, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Fibro-epithelial lesions of the breast 
can be difficult to assess, especially when dealing with core biop-
sies. In uncommon clinical settings such as pregnancy, young girls 
or a size that would require mastectomy, they are even more dif-
ficult to assess.
Methods: Here we report on three cases of fibroepithelial lesions, 
where caring clinicians were concerned about malignancy despite 
benign pathology reports. We discuss the difficulties of making 
clinicians accept a benign pathology diagnosis despite the wor-
rying clinical presentation. Literature for similar cases confirmed 
that these are rare but well-known conditions usually described in 
single or very small series case reports.
Results: In one case, the core biopsy was reported as B2, fibroad-
enoma with necrosis. Despite a benign report, diagnostic surgical 
excision was performed. Following MDT, it was revealed that the 
patient was post-partum and lactating. Patient 2 had a B3 core 
biopsy for a spindle cells tumour, occupying most of the breast. 
Excision biopsy was unwelcome because the size would have 
required a mastectomy, not consistent with a B3 report. Additional 
biopsies revealing an epithelial component consistent with phyl-
lodes tumour were required for diagnosis. Patient 3 was a 17-year-
old girl with a 70mm lump in her breast. Clinical concern led 
to surgical resection without prior core biopsy revealing benign 
phyllodes tumour.
Conclusion: Benign fibroepithelial tumours simulating malig-
nancy on clinical presentation are well known to pathologists 
but still create uncertainty in clinicians. Although rare, in one 
year we have encountered and correctly identified three such 
cases. Our experience, where clinicians are not prepared to 
accept a diagnosis of benign/uncertain tumour on core biop-
sies, suggests that more education of these tumour subtypes is 
essential if clinicians are to accept our diagnosis and organize 
patient management accordingly.

Breast interstitium or "Hartveit’s Labyrinth": morphology and 
relationship to disease processes

Darvishian, D. Nimeh, U. Ozerdem, S. Badve, R. Wells, N. Theise
*NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, USA
Background & objectives: The breast stroma contains intersti-
tial spaces (IS) supported by collagen bundles and intermittently 
lined by CD34+/vimentin+ interstitial lining cells (ILC) identified 
previously by Hartveit (Histopathology, 1990) as pre-lymphatic 
"labyrinth." Current study investigates morphology and role of 
interstitium in disease processes.
Methods: Normal breast tissue with skin and breast tissue with 
PASH were stained for HA with peroxidase labelled HABP (hya-
luronic acid binding protein) to investigate continuity between 
intralobular/interlobular and skin IS. IHC multiplex co-staining 
for CD34 and vimentin was used to demonstrate spatial relationship 
of the interstitial HA with ILC (Discovery Ultra, Ventana) and IHC 
for Galectin/Vimentin and p63/Vimentin in PASH.
Results: HABP staining showed HA throughout the IS of 
the normal breast sections and demonstrated continuity of IS 
between intralobular, interlobular, perivascular and perineu-
ral interstitium. In samples with PASH, HABP showed expan-
sion of IS associated with thickened collagen bundles. IHC 
for p16/Vimentin showed significantly increased staining in 
PASH comparing to normal breast tissue and Galectin/Vimentin 
demonstrated positive Galectin staining along cell membrane 
of some fibroblasts in PASH.
Conclusion: Breast IS form a continuous space permeating all 
stromal compartments: periductal, interlobular, nipple, and 
dermis. Additionally, IS are continuous between breast stroma 
and perivascular adventitia and perineurium, connections to a 
body-wide system of IS. Our data support that PASH is a keloid-
type expansion and remodelling of the mammary IS, which further 
suggests that mammary interstitium may play roles in fibrocystic 
disease, gynecomastia and malignant states such as invasive lobular 
carcinoma and could provide a route to spread via lymphatics/
perineural routes.

The effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on histologic grade 
and hormone receptor status in HER2/Neu-negative Luminal-B 
tumours of the breast

*Marmara University, Turkey
Background & objectives: With stratification of tumours, 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has become more common 
in Her2/Neu-negative Luminal-B group. Here we investigate the 
effect of NACT on histologic grade/hormone receptor (HR) status 
and tumour representation adequacy in pre-NACT core biopsies.
Methods: Her2/Neu-negative luminal-B cases between 2017 and 
2020 with available core biopsy and post-NACT resection slides 
were retrieved. Hospital records, original sign-out reports and glass 
slides were retrospectively reviewed for demographic data, pre-/
post-NACT histologic grade and HR status of tumours, as well 
as number of pre-NACT core biopsy pieces available for tumoral 
representation.
Results: 45 cases were identified, with a mean age of 49.8. 
In the pre-NACT core biopsy samples, average number of 
pieces and percentage of tumoral tissue in the pieces were 3.82 
and 52% respectively. 40% (n=18) of cases were attributed 
a histologic grade different from what had been originally 
assigned to them with the core biopsy, while 4.4% of cases

(n=2) showed complete regression in post-NACT resection 
specimens. From core biopsy to resection, in terms of oestrogen 
receptor expression change, 8.9% (n=4) and 8.9% (n=4) of cases 
marked a decrease and increase, respectively. For progesterone 
receptor status, 33.3% (n=15) of cases demonstrated a decrease, 
while 11.1% (n=5) showed an increase.
Conclusion: Changes in histologic grade, increased/decreased 
ER or decreased PR status have been described in literature as 
potential effects of NACT. Yet 11.1% (n=5) of our cases showed 
significant increase in PR status, which can better be explained by 
intratumoral heterogeneity and inadequate pre-NACT representa-
tion of tumoral tissue. In fact these cases had significantly lower 
percentage (30%) of tumoral tissue representation in the pre-NACT 
core biopsy specimen.

*Department of Pathology Sumy State University, Sumy, Ukraine
Background & objectives: The aim of the study is to study the 
main morphological and crystal chemical properties of microcal-
cifications of breast cancer.
Methods: In our study, we examined 30 specimens of breast carcer 
by histology (hematoxylin-eosin staining), histochemistry, scan-
ning electron microscopy with EDS and TEM.
Results: Histological examination of breast cancer samples 
revealed the presence of microcalcifications in the form of dark 
blue deposits of round and irregular shape, different sizes. A 
positive reaction to von Koss staining indicates the presence of 
calcium phosphate compounds in their composition. We confirmed 
the presence of round calcifications using SEM. SEM with X-ray 
microanalysis confirmed that the biomineral part of the samples 
of the group consists mainly of hydroxyapatites. In 6 cases, the 
presence of hydroxyapatite is combined with oxalates. However, 
oxalates and apatites had different localizations: apatites were 
associated with tumour, and oxalates were in intact adjacent tissue.
Conclusion: We found the possibility of the simultaneous presence 
of microcalcifications of hydroxyapatite and oxalate nature in 
samples of invasive breast cancer. Different spatial localization of 
biominerals indicates different mechanisms and conditions for the 
formation of microcalcifications.

*Poundbury Cancer Institute, Dorchester, UK, Carol Davila Uni-
versity of Medicine and Pharmacy Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Assessment of Her2 amplification 
requires counting 20-60 cells. This is time-consuming and may be 
unnecessary since morphological assessment can provide accurate 
diagnosis in a proportion of cases. We define parameters for selec-
tion of cases that can be diagnosed morphologically.
Methods: Using both glass slides and DP, we studied 200 consecu-
tive breast core biopsies for which DDISH was requested following 
an indeterminate (2+) IHC result with 4B5. We assessed whole 
slides for presence and frequency of amplification clusters and 
polysomy of Ch17 by eyeballing. We separately performed formal 
counting and compared the time to reach a diagnosis.
Results: We identified a number of morphological groups, includ-
ing tumours with large amplification clusters (regardless of the 
number of Ch17 signals), tumours with sparse Her-2 signals (that 
are clearly below a ratio of 2 per Ch17) and tumours with high 
prevalence of borderline/non-amplified features. We evaluated con-
cordance between morphological diagnosis and formal counting. 
Concordance was high in tumours with amplification clusters and 
in tumours with low gene copy numbers and/or low Ch17 signals. 
Concordance was poor in tumours with intermediate features. Time 
required for morphological assessment (30-60s) was 5-6 times 
faster than formal counting. For these assessments, DP was com-
parable to glass slides.
Conclusion: Some cases will still require the formal counting 
approach but we demonstrate that morphological assessment can be 
as accurate as formal counting in selected cases. For this to become 
established, training will need to be provided in order to ensure 
concordance amongst pathologists. This training can be delivered 
by DP. Digital programmes of Proficiency Testing would ensure 
continuing diagnostic alignment. This approach would save report-
ing time and therefore Pathologists and Healthcare resources could 
be used more efficiently.

Prutki, Z. Marušić
*Clinical Department of Pathology and Cytology, University Hos-
pital Centre Zagreb, Croatia
Background & objectives: Current breast cancer guidelines 
recommend biopsy of metastatic lesions at presentation or first 
recurrence. Objective is to provide a cross-sectional pathological 
study of CT-guided bone biopsy specimens in breast cancer 
patients with suspicious bone lesions.
Methods: A cross-sectional study on 56 consecutive female breast 
cancer patients who underwent CT-guided biopsy of suspicious 
bone lesion was performed. Quantity of the specimen was defined 
as optimal (>5% cancer cellularity), suboptimal and low (non-
diagnostic). Immunophenotype of the primary tumour and 
matching metastasis was compared, where available. Diagnostic 
accuracy of CT-guided bone biopsy was determined.
Results: A total of 58 bone lesions were biopsied in 56 patients 
and 44 (75.9%) breast cancer metastases were found. CT-guided 
biopsy enabled optimal quantity of specimens in most cases 
(56.9%), followed by suboptimal (32.8%) and low (10.3%). In 
10% of positive cases, the number of tumour cells was too low for 
further immunohistochemical analysis. In 36 paired cases (primary 
vs metastatic), a shift in immunophenotype was observed in 13 
cases (36.1%), most commonly from PR-positive to PR-negative 
(10/13, 76.9%). Sensitivity of CT-guided biopsy for detecting bone 
metastases was 93.6% and specificity was 100%.
Conclusion: CT-guided bone biopsy is a method with high sen-
sitivity and specificity for detecting breast cancer metastasis that 
can be used when soft tissue metastatic lesions are not obtainable. 
The proportion of positive cases with sufficient tumour quantity 
for further immunohistochemical analysis is high. Comparison of 
primary tumour and metastasis immunophenotype revealed dis-
cordance in more than one third of patients, with potential thera-
peutic implications.

Background & objectives: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous dis-
ease, with a spectrum of biological features and differences in clin-
ical outcome. The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic 
factors of luminal breast cancer subtypes among Croatian breast 
cancer population.
Methods: This is a large retrospective population-based study 
including 1127 primary breast cancer cases, during a six year 
period (2016–2020) in Osijek, Croatia. The clinico-pathologic 
and immunohistochemical (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) 
data were extracted from pathology reports to examine the luminal 
subtypes A and B. The cross-tabulated statistics of the observed 
characteristics were performed between the two subtypes.
Results: Luminal cancers comprised 86.9% (980/1127) of the total 
cohort, including 724 (64.2%) cases of luminal B and 256 (22.7%) 
luminal A. Age profile of Luminal A and B cancers were simi-
lar (63.5 vs 62.3 years). Mean tumour size was higher in luminal 
B than luminal A cancers (19.6 vs 22.2 mm, p=0.03). Luminal 
B cancers were significantly associated with adverse prognostic 
features than luminal A cancer, including high histologic grade 
(14% grade III luminal B vs 3.5% luminal A, p<0.0001), vascular 
invasion (18% luminal B vs 7.5% luminal A, p<0.0001), and nodal 
metastasis (21.2% luminal B vs 15.1% luminal A, p=0.006).
Conclusion: Luminal B is the most frequent subtype of breast 
cancer in Croatian patients. They were associated with adverse 
clinico-histologic parameters such as higher grade, vascular inva-
sion, and nodal metastasis. Our findings suggest that, despite lack 
of molecular studies in routine practice, IHC/ISH-based typing are 
sufficient for prognostic and therapeutic stratifications in breast 
cancers.

Ki67 proliferative index in patients with early breast cancer 
and its association with clinicopathological factors

R. Gudelj, M. Bakula, R. Alaghehbandan
*University Hospital Osijek, Croatia
Background & objectives: Standard cut-off for distinguishing low 
and high Ki67 index as a prognostic marker in early breast cancer 
do not exist. The aim of this study was to determine the role of 
Ki67 index and its association with other prognostic parameters.
Methods: A large population-based retrospective study including 
957 primary early breast cancers (pT2 or less) was conducted 
during a 5-year period (2016–2020) in Osijek, Croatia. The clinico-
pathologic data were extracted from pathology reports. Multiple 
logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations 
between Ki67 and other clinicopathological factors.
Results: The median Ki67 was 30% (range 2–98%), with 251 
(26.2%) patients had a Ki67 <20%. Triple-negative breast can-
cers showed highest ki67 index (mean 72.7 ± 23.9%) followed by 
HER2-positive (mean 60.2 ± 21.3%) and luminal B cancers (mean 
39.8 ± 19.9%) (p<0.0001). Metaplastic and medullary breast can-
cers significantly showed higher Ki67 index compared to ductal 
carcinoma, NOS. Using a multivariable logistic regression with 
Ki67 (<20% vs. ≥20%) as binary dependent variable, younger age, 
positive nodal status, higher grading, negative HR status, and posi-
tive HER2 status were shown to be significantly associated with a 
higher proliferative index (Ki67 ≥20%).
Conclusion: Ki67 index is a valuable biomarker of breast cancer 
as higher ki67 correlates with more aggressive tumour biology. 
However, definition of low and high proliferation index itself is 
challenging. It is essential to interpret Ki67 indices carefully with 
regard to the own institutional values and other clinicopathologi-
cal factors.

To determine the accuracy of axillary staging using ultra-
sound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology in breast cancer 
patients: a single institutional experience
I. Aloglu*, M. Doğan, S. Aydın Aksu, F. Aker
*Department of Pathology, Haydarpaşa Numune Training and 
Research Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspi-
ration cytology (US-FNAC) of axillary lymphadenopathy is a 
helpful tool in identifying candidates for axillary dissection and 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer patients. This study 
investigated the diagnostic value of evaluating the axillary lymph 
nodes with US-FNAC.
Methods: Between 2011 and 2021, 284 cases who underwent the 
axillary US-FNAC procedure during the diagnosis of primary 
breast cancer and then underwent axillary / sentinel surgery were 
collected retrospectively. Cytological diagnoses and corresponding 
histological diagnoses were documented. Final histopathology was 
taken as gold standard. The diagnostic parameters, including sen-
sitivity, specificity, positive (PPV), and negative predictive values 
(NPV), were calculated.
Results: Hundred-fifty-two of 284 cases were evaluated as malig-
nant cytology in FNAC. There were no malignant histopathologi-
cal findings in 4 of them. Conversely, 132 cases were evaluated 
as benign cytology in FNAC. While 41 of them had malignant 
tumour metastases histopathologically, 91 of them did not have any 
malignancy findings. Overall sensitivity of lymph node FNAC was 
78.3% and specificity was 95.7%. Positive predictive value (PPV) 
was 97.3% and negative predictive value (NPV) was 68.9%.
Conclusion: Axillary FNAC is a diagnostic method that helps 
surgeons decide whether to perform sentinel node biopsies. This 
technique is favourable due to its minimally invasive nature. 
In addition, we suggest that FNAC can prevent unnecessary 
axillary dissection due to its high positive predictive value 
(PPV). The reason for the lower negative predictive value may 
be hypocellularity and micrometastasis. So FNAC has adequate 
sensitivity and high specificity in diagnosing axillary lymph 
node metastasis.

R. Alaghehbandan
*University Hospital Osijek, Croatia
Background & objectives: Breast cancers are heterogeneous 
groups of tumours, and its subtypes correlates with therapeutic 
response and overall survival. In this study, we assessed whether 
the subtype can predict the presence of nodal metastasis in a 
large cohort of breast cancer patients.
Methods: A large population-based retrospective study includ-
ing 1127 primary breast cancers was conducted during a 5-year 
period (2016–2020) in Osijek, Croatia. The clinico-pathologic 
data were extracted from pathology reports. The Pearson chi-
square test was used to determine whether progesterone receptor 
(PR) status had an impact on the incidence of lymph node posi-
tivity in oestrogen receptor (ER) positive patients.

Results: Lymph node metastasis was significantly associated 
with HER2-positive and luminal B breast cancers, higher histo-
logic grade, as well as higher Ki67 proliferation index (p<0.01). 
Independent predictors of nodal positivity included tumour size 
and vascular invasion (p<0.0001). There were significant dif-
ferences between subtypes and nodal positivity, with luminal 
A cancers (23.3%) had the lowest and Her2-positive (50%) the 
highest rates (p=0.001). There was no difference in lymph node 
positivity between PR+ and PR- tumours amongst all subtypes 
(p=.1).
Conclusion: Tumour size and vascular invasion are independ-
ent predictors of nodal positivity in this study. HER2-positive 
breast cancers, higher histologic grade and Ki67 proliferation 
index are significantly associated with lymph node metastasis. 
These findings may play a role in guiding regional management 
considerations.

reuther, G. Sauter, R. Simon, S. Minner*, E. Burandt, A. Marx,

*University Medical Center Hamburg, Germany
Background & objectives: GATA3 is a transcription factor 
involved in epithelial cell differentiation. Positive GATA3 immu-
nostaining is used as a diagnostic marker for breast and urothelial 
cancer but can also occur in other neoplasms.
Methods: A set of tissue microarrays containing 16,611 
samples from 133 different tumour types and subtypes and 608 
samples of 76 different normal tissue types were analysed by 
immunohistochemistry to comprehensively evaluate GATA3 
expression in normal and tumour tissues.
Results: GATA3 positivity occurred in 70 different tumour 
types including 24 (18%) with ≥1 strongly positive tumour. 
Highest positivity rates occurred in non-invasive papillary 
urothelial carcinoma (92-99%), lobular (98%) and NST (92%) 
carcinoma of the breast, cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (97%), 
invasive urothelial carcinoma (73%), T-cell lymphoma (23%), 
adenocarcinoma of the salivary gland (16%), and cutaneous 
squamous cell carcinoma (16%). In breast cancer, low GATA3 
staining was linked to advanced pT stage (p=0.03), high BRE 
grade (p<0.0001), HER2 overexpression (p=0.0085), oestrogen 
and progesterone receptor negativity (p<0.0001 each) and 
reduced survival (p=0.03). In urothelial neoplasms, low GATA3 
was linked to poor grade within pTa tumours (p=0.01) and with 
advanced stage (p<0.0001).
Conclusion: GATA3 positivity can be seen in various tumour 
entities. Particularly high frequency and levels of GATA3 expres-
sion occur in breast and urothelial carcinoma. A reduced level of 
GATA3 reflects cancer progression and poor patient prognosis in 
these tumour entities.

Analysis of intraoperative frozen sections of sentinel lymph 
nodes - a 10-year long series in a tertiary Portuguese hospital
J. Boavida*, R. Moiteiro da Cruz, L. Correia
*Department of Pathology - Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN; 
Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal
Background & objectives: Intraoperative frozen sections of 
sentinel lymph node (IFSSLN) allowed better management of 
breast cancer (BC) particularly in the decision to perform axillary 
lymphadenectomy (AL). This study reviews results of IFSSLN, 
their definitive evaluation and correlation with AL status when 
performed.
Methods: Through our department’s information system, we com-
piled every case of BC where IFSSLN was performed along with 
data pertaining diagnosis and AL status, from 2010 to 2020; 929 
out of 1056 cases were selected. Only cases with a diagnosis of 
invasive disease made in surgical specimens were chosen and AL 
was solely considered when referred as such by the surgeon.
Results: Median age of diagnosis was 59,4 years (range 27-95 
years), with a female predominance (n=923). 695 were IFSSNL-
negative with 88,9%(n=618) being true-negatives; the remaining 
showed signs of disease in definitive evaluation (mostly isolated 
tumour cells[ITC] and 2 cases with metastasis). AL was performed 
in 7 false-negative cases which revealed metastasis in 2 cases and 
micrometastasis in 1; 42 false-negatives had nodal evaluation not 
by AL (either satellite lymph node or axillary inspection), showing 
metastatic disease in 6 of these (4 metastasis, 1 micrometastasis 
and 1 ITC). There were no false-positive cases. Two cases were 
deferred. Invasive breast carcinoma of no special type was the most 
common diagnosis (n=725).
Conclusion: IFSSNL continues to be a useful assessment method 
in BC staging, showing in this retrospective study highly favourable 
statistical values when compared with posterior definitive evalua-
tion (75,1% sensibility; 100% specificity; 100% positive predictive 
value; 88,9% negative predictive value); this results are vastly sup-
ported by our use of immunohistochemical stains during the proce-
dure. 34,5% of true-positive cases benefited from this evaluation, 
since AL revealed the presence of metastatic disease; furthermore, 
it spared 571 patients of AL-associated complications.

*Ac Camargo Cancer Center, Brazil
Background & objectives: Advanced triple-negative breast 
cancer can be treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, and 
the expression of PD-L1 is one of the biomarkers used to select 
patients with clinical benefit. This study analyses the interobserver 
agreement in the immunohistochemical report of PD-L1.
Methods: 168 cases of TNBC were previously tested and 
diagnosed between 1987-2016 in 3 institutions. Medical records 
were reviewed for clinicopathological data collection. The study 
was performed on 2 TMAs, using two clones. The samples were 
analysed by 2 breast pathology subspecialists and 2 general 
pathologists without training. The Kappa value was calculated to 
assess interobserver agreement, with p < 0.001.
Results: For clone 22C3, (κ) among the 4 evaluators was 
0.387, with κ = 0.625 among subspecialist examiners and κ = 
0.264 among general pathologists, with 73% concordant cases. 
Of the discordant cases, a subspecialist evaluator considered 
1.7% samples as positive, while the others classified them as 
negative. For clone SP142, (κ) among the 4 evaluators was 
κ = 0.331, with κ = 0.420 among subspecialists and κ = 
0.285 among general pathologists, with 109 (64.8%) cases in 
agreement. Of the discordant cases, in 10.1% one evaluator was 
inconsistent and interpreted the sample as positive, with the 
discordant interpretation given by subspecialists in 14 cases 
and by general pathologists in 3.
Conclusion: We demonstrated different rates of interobserver 
variability between 4 evaluators and different PD-L1 clones,

with a minimum overall level of agreement. However, in com-
parison with general pathologists, the agreement rate between 
subspecialist evaluators was higher, reaching a moderate level 
for clone 22C3 and pointing to the possibility of improvement 
with tutorials. It is noteworthy that even among trained examin-
ers, the agreement rate did not reach optimal levels, indicating 
the existence of challenges in the analysis of PD-L1 expression.

Background & objectives: Hypermethylation of tumour suppres-
sor genes leads eventually to malignant transformation. The aim 
of our study was to determine DNA methylation status of selected 
tumour suppressor genes in oropharyngeal squamous cell carci-
noma (OPSCC) and to find correlation with clinico-pathological 
characteristics.
Methods: A total of 101 samples were analysed in the study (31 
primary tumours with 31 corresponding metastases, 20 non-
metastasizing primary tumours, and 19 control samples). In every 
patient, classical clinico-pathological parameters were recorded. 
For methylation analysis, methylation-specific multiplex ligation-
dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) was performed for a 
set of 25 tumour suppressor genes (Probe mix ME002-C1).
Results: The study sample comprised 37 males and 14 females, 
aged 45–80 years (median 58 years). A total of 80% of tumours 
were HPV-positive. During the follow-up period (range 3–180 
months; median 82 months), 10% of tumours recurred and 10% 
of patients died due to tumour. We observed significantly higher 
methylation of WT1, PAX6, and CADM1 genes in primary tumours 
compared to controls (p < 0.05). WT1 and CADM1 genes were 
significantly hypermethylated in HPV-positive OPSCC compared 
to HPV-negative OPSCC (p < 0.01). Kaplan-Meier survival curve 
showed that patients with higher methylation levels of PAX5 gene 
had impaired overal survival compared to patients with PAX5-
unmethylated tumours (p = 0.04).
Conclusion: In summary, significant correlation was observed 
between methylation status of selected tumour suppressor genes 
and clinico-pathological parameters in our OPSCC study sample. 
Our promising results unravel novel potential biomarkers which, if 
confirmed by further studies, could be used as prognostic markers 
in the sense of tailored therapy and treatment individualization of 
patients with OPSCC.

Predictive gene expression model for detection of SDHx muta-
tion in carotid paragangliomas

Sciences, Moscow, Russia
Background & objectives: Mutations in SDHx genes occur in 
more than 40% of carotid paragangliomas (CPGLs). SDHB and 
SDHD variants are associated with the high risk of metastasis and 
multifocality, respectively. Identification of SDHx mutation is 
important for management of patients with CPGLs.
Methods: Whole-transcriptome sequencing on an Illumina plat-
form and bioinformatics analysis were performed for 71 CPGLs. 
Based on gene expression data (CPMs), a fully connected neural 
network (FCNN) was constructed using Keras, Tensorflow, and 
KerasR libraries. The predictive model was trained and tested on 
a studied cohort, as well as additionally tested with RNA-Seq data 
for pheochromocytomas (PCCs) from TCGA.
Results: We created a two-step predictive gene expression model 
for identification of deleterious variants in SDHx genes. At first 
step, the model defines variants in SDHx genes overall based on the 
expression of four genes (CEP104, ERP29, EYA3, and NFRKB) 
and a lncRNA (STXBP5-AS1). The first gene set has the following 
metrics: sensitivity–0.85/specificity–1/accuracy–0.92/AUC–0.92 
for the CPGL cohort and sensitivity–0.52/specificity–0.69/accu-
racy–0.61/AUC–0.61 for the PCC cohort. In the second round, the 
model predicts SDHB and SDHD mutations using data on CEP104, 
ERP29, and EYA3 gene expression and had the following metrics: 
sensitivity–1/specificity–1/accuracy–1/AUC–1 for CPGLs, and 
sensitivity–1/specificity–0.7/accuracy–0.77/AUC–0.85 for PCCs. 
This work was financially supported by the grant from the Russian 
Science Foundation (no.21-14-00353).
Conclusion: Clinical genetic testing of patients with CPGLs 
requires target sequencing of four genes (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, 
and SDHD) or whole-exome sequencing, which is often long and 
expensive. Immunohistochemistry of SDHB subunit and measure-
ment of succinate-to-fumarate ratio were recently proposed as 
alternative methods for primary prediction of SDHx mutations. 
However, these approaches do not detect the specific mutated gene. 
This model allows identifying not only SDHx-mutated tumours but 
also detect mutated genes (SDHB and SDHD) that are essential for 
tumour management.
Funding: This work was financially supported by a grant from 
the Russian Science Foundation (no. 21-14-00353) and performed 
using the equipment of the EIMB RAS “Genome” center (http://

Background & objectives: Vagal paraganglioma (VPGL) is a rare 
neuroendocrine tumour occurring along the vagus nerve. Approxi-
mately half of head and neck paragangliomas are associated with 
mutations in SDHx genes. However, molecular changes associated 
with these mutations have not been fully understood.
Methods: Illumina whole-transcriptome libraries were prepared for 
33 VPGLs with known SDHx status and subsequently sequenced 
on a NextSeq 500 at 76bp, single-end mode. Raw sequencing data 
were subjected to the standard bioinformatics analysis. Analysis 
of differential gene expression and pathways enrichment were per-

Results: Using top-40 differently expressed genes between 
SDHx-mutated and non-SDHx-mutated tumours, pathway enrich-
ment analysis was performed. Based on KEGG database, four 
pathways enriched with upregulated genes and seven pathways 
enriched with downregulated genes were found (FDR ≤ 0.05). 
Using GO database, we revealed 75 pathways enriched by upreg-
ulated genes (FDR ≤ 0.05) and no significant changes in path-
ways enriched by downregulated genes. According to both data-
bases, SDHx mutations are associated with expression changes 
in genes related to cell adhesion, extracellular matrix, PI3K-Akt, 
and VEGF signalling pathways. This work was performed using 
the equipment of EIMB RAS “Genome” centre (http://www.
eimb.ru/ru1/ckp/ccu_genome_c.php).
Conclusion: Changes in biological pathways associated with 
SDHx mutations in VPGLs were firstly detected. We showed 
that well-known tumour-associated PI3K-Akt pathway can 
potentially be activated in SDHx-mutated tumours. Upregula-
tion of genes involved in the VEGF signalling pathway in SDHx-
mutated VPGLs is possibly associated with pseudohypoxic 
state that occurs as a result of succinate accumulation and HIF 
stabilization.

neoplasms
E. Phattarataratip*, A. Lam-Ubol
*Chulalongkorn University, Thailand
Background & objectives: Histone modifications had been 
reported in different cancers with varying prognostic implica-
tions. The objectives of this study were to examine the degree 
of acetylation and methylation of histone H3 in salivary gland 
neoplasms and their associations with prognostically-relevant 
pathologic characteristics.
Methods: The expression of H3K18Ac and H3K9Me3 in 
70 specimens of salivary gland neoplasms, consisting of 30 
mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), 20 adenoid cystic carcinoma 
(ACC) and 20 pleomorphic adenoma (PA), were investigated 
immunohistochemically. The immunohistochemical scoring was 
calculated in each case, based on both the staining intensity and 
the percentage of positive tumour cells.
Results: H3K18Ac and H3K9Me3 were variably expressed in the 
majority of MEC, ACC and PA cases. Their expression appeared 
significantly correlated within this group of neoplasms. The 
increased H3K9Me3 in MEC was positively correlated with small 
nest invasion at tumour front and advanced grade pathologically. 
In addition, the solid subtype of ACC showed significant 
up-regulation of both H3K18Ac and H3K9Me3, compared with 
cribriform/tubular subtypes.
Conclusion: Salivary gland neoplasms differentially acquire dis-
tinct pattern of histone modification. Hyperacetylation and meth-
ylation of histone H3 could be underpinning the prognostically 
worsen solid type of ACC, and the trimethylation of H3K9 may be 
involved in aggressive pathologic characteristics of MEC.

H3K9Ac expression in salivary gland tumours: correlation with 
histopathologic characteristics
A. Lam-Ubol*, E. Phattarataratip
*Srinakharinwirot University, Thailand
Background & objectives: Acetylation of histone protein plays 
an important role in regulation of gene expression. Dysregulation 
of histone H3K9 acetylation was reported in various cancers and 
presented prognostic and therapeutic values. We aimed to examine 
H3K9Ac expression among common salivary gland tumours.
Methods: Archived paraffin-embedded tissue of 30 mucoepider-
moid carcinomas, 20 adenoid cystic carcinomas and 20 pleomor-
phic adenomas were included in the study. H3K9Ac expression 
was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. Expression of 
H3K9Ac were determined semi-quantitatively based on both stain-
ing intensity and percentage of positive cells. The immunohisto-
chemical scores were then evaluated according to various histo-
pathologic features.
Results: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma demonstrated significantly 
increased H3K9Ac expression compared with pleomorphic ade-
noma. Moreover, the solid subtype of adenoid cystic carcinoma 
showed significantly higher H3K9Ac expression than the cribri-
form/tubular subtypes.
Conclusion: High levels of H3K9Ac appear to be associated with 
malignant salivary gland neoplasm and a more aggressive subtype 
of adenoid cystic carcinoma.

Predictive modeling for the diagnosis of oral and laryngeal 
premalignant and malignant lesions using expression of p53 
and ki-67
J. Jeong*, K. Cho, H.J. Lee, Y.S. Lee, J.S. Song
*Department of Pathology, Asan Medical Center, Republic of 
Korea
Background & objectives: Oral and laryngeal epithelial lesions 
are diagnosed based on histologic criteria of WHO classification 
which may appear interobserver variability. Integrated diagnostic 
approach based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) is required that 
can help the interpretation of ambiguous histological findings of 
epithelial lesions.
Methods: The oral cavity and larynx tissues of 118 cases from 
108 patients were examined by IHC for p53 and Ki-67. Logistic 
regression analysis and decision tree algorithm were employed to 
develop the scoring system and predictive model for differentiat-
ing the epithelial lesions. The comparison between TP53 mutation 
and expression patterns of p53 was conducted by Next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) and IHC.
Results: The diffuse expression type (pattern HI) and null type 
(pattern LS) for p53, and pattern HI for Ki-67 were significantly 
associated with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or squamous cell 
carcinoma (SqCC). With accuracy and the area under a receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 85.3% and 85.4%, the scor-
ing system based on p53 and Ki-67 classified epithelial lesions 
into two types: non-dysplasia or low-grade dysplasia, and HGD 
or SqCC. The decision tree model using p53 and Ki-67 classified 
epithelial lesions into non-dysplasia, dysplasia, and SqCC with 
accuracy and AUC of 64.7% and 80%. The patterns HI and LS for 
p53 were confirmed to be correlated with missense and nonsense/
frameshift mutations, respectively.
Conclusion: The scoring system using p53 and Ki-67 may aid 
in the differentiation of epithelial lesions, especially when their 
morphologic features are ambiguous.

Korea
Background & objectives: Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) 
expression is predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor 
in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We compared the vari-
able immunohistochemical (IHC) assays using the tumour propor-
tion score (TPS) and the combined positive score (CPS).
Methods: In total 56 cases of head and neck carcinoma (HNC), 
PD-L1 expression was evaluated for formalin fixed paraffin embed-
ded (FFPE) blocks from biopsy and surgical resection specimens 
using 4 IHC assays including 22C3 pharmDx on the Dako Link 48 
platform and on Ventana Benchmark Ultra platform, SP263, and 
SP142 by TPS and CPS using cut-offs of >1% and >50%.
Results: Overall PD-L1 positivity rates were 83.9% (47/56) with a 
cut-off ≥1% and 21.4% (12/56) with a cut-off ≥50%. The average 
of TPS scores were 18.03 ±24.83 with 22C3 on Ventana assay, 
16.56±25.84 with 22C3 pharmDx, 16.76± 25.16 with SP263 assay, 
and 3.72±11.48 with SP142 assay, resulting in the lowest expres-
sion rate in SP142 assay. A statistically significant correlation 
(p=0.012) was analysed between location and PD-L1 expression 
using a cut-off ≥50%. When comparing different assays, 22C3 
pharmDx and SP263 assay using TPS score showed good correla-
tion with Spearman correlation coefficients calculated as 0.892 (p 
<0.001). However, less agreements were observed among 22C3 
pharmDx, SP263 assay, and SP142 assay.
Conclusion: Overall PD-L1 positivity rate with a cut-off ≥1% was 
83.9%. PD-L1 expression was statistically significant correlation 
with the location (P = 0.012). The correlation of PD-L1 expression 
between paired the biopsy and resection specimen is evaluating in 
this ongoing research.

PD-L1 expression and its clinicopathological significance in 
odontogenic carcinomas
K. Oh*, J. Kim, S. Cho, J. Lee, H. Yoon, S. Hong
*Seoul National University, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-
L1) expression has been investigated in various malignancies and 
is currently used for immunotherapy selection in patients with 
several cancers. This study aims to primarily identify PD-L1 
expression and determine its clinicopathological significance in 
odontogenic carcinomas.
Methods: PD-L1 (clone E1L3N) immunohistochemistry was per-
formed in 20 odontogenic carcinomas after validated compared 
to the 22C3 pharmDx assay. The percentage of tumour cells with 
membranous staining at any intensity (TPS) ≥ 1% was defined 
as PD-L1-positive. Associations between PD-L1 expression and 
clinicopathological factors were statistically analysed.
Results: PD-L1 was positively expressed in 85.7% (6/7) of amelo-
blastic carcinomas, 37.5% (3/8) of primary intraosseous carcino-
mas, 33.3% (1/3) of clear cell odontogenic carcinomas, and 50% 
(1/2) ghost cell odontogenic carcinomas. Positive PD-L1 expres-
sion was associated with larger tumour size (P = 0.031), whereas 
no correlation was observed with age, sex, and tumour location (P 
> 0.05). Most cases (3/4; 75.0%) of odontogenic carcinomas with 
metastasis showed high PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥ 50%).
Conclusion: These results suggest the possible utility of 
immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients with 
advanced odontogenic carcinomas, which warrants further clinical 
investigation.

Assessment of TP53 and CDKN2A status can be a predictive 
marker of malignant transformation of sinonasal inverted 
papilloma

Won, J. Kim, C.S. Rhee, H. Kim
*Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Sinonasal inverted papilloma (IP) has 
the potential to transform into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 
but there are no diagnostic methods to predict it. We investigated 
genetic mutations involved in progression of IP-SCC and explored 
biomarkers that can predict malignant transformation.
Methods: 14 patients diagnosed with SCC arising in IP and six 
patients diagnosed with IP without malignant transformation were 
included. DNA was extracted from IP, IP with dysplasia, and SCC, 
respectively, and whole exome sequencing and immunohistochem-
istry (IHC) was performed.
Results: Major oncogenic mutations were observed with high fre-
quency in the stepwise progression from IP to SCC. TP53 was 
the most frequently mutated gene (39%), followed by CDKN2A 
(27%), TTN (27%), ARID1A (21%), and PIK3CA (15%). Muta-
tions in TP53 and/or CDKN2A were observed in 3 out of 6 IPs 
with malignant transformation, whereas none of the mutations were 
observed in IPs without malignant transformation. As a result of 
TP53 and CDKN2A IHC, three of six IPs with malignant trans-
formation showed a diffuse strong or null pattern in p53, and one 
showed a total loss of p16 which is distinct pattern from pure IPs.
Conclusion: Our result suggests that assessment of TP53 and 
CDKN2A status can be a predictive marker of malignant transfor-
mation of IP and assessment of p53 and p16 status using IHC can 
be a surrogate marker for TP53 and CDKN2A status.

Ghribi, T. Boudawara, R. Kallel
*Department of Pathology, Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, 
Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Juvenile trabecular ossifying fibroma 
(JTOF) and juvenile psammomatoid ossifying fibroma (JPOF) are 
two rare histological variants of ossifying fibroma (OF). Theses 
variants are 3 distinct clinicopathological entities. Our aim is to 
assess clinico-pathologic features of a case series of OF.
Methods: Eleven consecutive cases of OF diagnosed in the 
department of pathology of Habib Bourguiba Hospital, were 
collected from 2011 to 2021. The clinical data and microscopic 
features of these cases were reviewed and analysed with the most 
recent diagnostic criteria for OF.
Results: Patients mean age at diagnosis was 35 years with a sex-
ratio of 0,2. Eight cases were found in the mandible and three in 
the maxilla. Bone swelling or expansion was the most frequent 
clinical presentation (90%). Microscopically there was 8 cases of 
classic OF comprised of globulous woven or lamellar bone with 
rare or without osteoblastic rimming mixed with fibrous tissue and 
three cases of JPOF comprised predominantly of psammoma bod-
ies mixed with a highly cellular fibrous tissue. No case of JTOF 
was recorded. No cellular atypia or mitosis were identified. Recur-
rences were recorded in two women with JPOF, aged 16 and 22 
years respectively. These recurrences were surgically removed.
Conclusion: OFs occur more frequently in female patients 
and in those in the second to fourth decades of life. The most 
commonly affected site is the mandible. Most OF can be treated

by conservative and complete surgical excision. Recurrences are 
infrequent in classic OF but more common in Juvenile ossifying 
fibroma. Therefore, a complete excision with long term supervision 
is needed.

Verification and validation of the anti-PD-L1 antibody, clone 
22C3 on a laboratory developed test
S. Brennan*, J. O’Neill, S. Kennedy
*St. Vincent’s University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland
Background & objectives: PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay 
kit processed via the Dako Autostainer Link-48 platform is the 
licensed immunohistochemical assay and companion diagnostic 
test(CDT) for the assessment and thus administration of Pembroli-
zumab. However, laboratories may not have access to this specified 
CDT.
Methods: 47 whole tumour slides off head and neck squamous 
cell carcinomas were stained with the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx 
assay kit processed via the Dako Autostainer Link 48 (CDT) and 
the Dako Omnis platform, referred to as a laboratory developed 
test (LDT). A combined positive score (CPS) were provided by 2 
pathologists, with discordant cases provided with an agreed score.
Results: PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay kit processed via CDT 
and LDT showed identical staining in terms of intensity and pattern 
of staining. On review of concordance between the CDT and LDT, 
implementing a CPS cut-off of ≥ 1 showed the following: overall 
percentage agreement (OPA) 94%; positive percentage agreement 
(PPA) 100%; negative percentage agreement (NPA) 88%. A CPS 
cut-off of ≥ 20 showed the following: OPA 96%; PPA 95%; NPA 
100%. With a CPS cut-off of ≥ 1, the intra-examiner concordance 
between the platforms was 89%, and the inter-examiner concord-
ance between examiners on each platform was 92%(CDT) and 
85%(LDT).
Conclusion: Firstly, the high level of concordance between scoring 
Pathologists illustrates with adequate training there is a reduction 
in the variable of scoring interpretation by examiners, which may 
have a therapeutic implication. Secondly, we open for discussion 
the deconstruction of the current practice of a compulsory CDT 
for a particular PD-L1 immunohistochemical assay in head and 
neck cancers. The implementation of LDTs as an alternative to 
the CDT are a novel and readily available method to surmount 
limitations posed.

The accuracy of head and neck core needle biopsies and fine 
needle aspirates at a large teaching hospital
P. Hankinson*, R. Gorania, A. Khurram
*The University of Sheffield, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Fine needle aspirate and core needle 
biopsies are common techniques for diagnosis of head and neck 
diseases. Diagnosis can be challenging due to limited tissue for 
examination. Here we record the accuracy of these techniques at 
Sheffield Teaching Hospitals.
Methods: We accessed records of patients receiving core needle 
biopsy (CNB) or fine needle aspirate (FNA) at a head and neck 
site from 2015 to 2020. Cases without definitive diagnosis on 
subsequent excision were excluded. Both specific diagnosis and 
benign/malignant category was compared between CNB/FNA and 
the excision specimen. Accuracy of FNA and CNB was compared 
with a Fischer’s exact test.
Results: A total of 79 cases were identified in which the CNB/
FNA diagnosis could be compared with a definitive diagnosis 
made on an excision specimen. Of these, 63 cases were CNB 
and 16 were FNA. CNB showed 95% agreement between the 
benign and malignant category and 87% in specific diagnosis. 
FNA showed 94% agreement between the benign and malignant 
category and 69% in specific diagnosis. The most common diag-
noses on CNB/FNA were pleomorphic adenoma and metastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma. A Fisher’s exact test did not show a sta-
tistically significant difference in the accuracy of CNB and FNA, 
this may be due to the limited sample size of the FNA group.
Conclusion: CNB and FNA are both non-invasive techniques 
in comparison to a conventional biopsy and are often utilised 
in the head and neck region. The accuracy of these techniques 
presented here is similar to those previously reported in the lit-
erature, approximately 90% for CNB and 70% for FNA. However, 
where previous studies found CNB to be more accurate than FNA 
this difference was not observed in this cohort. This may be due 
to the limited sample size of the FNA group.

Castelnuovo, S. La Rosa, M. Cerati, F. Sessa, S. Uccella
* Università degli Studi dell’Insubria, Department of Anatomical 
Pathology, Varese, Italy
Background & objectives: snNENs are rare and mostly include 
neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). ONB is a unique sinonasal 
neoplasm, expressing neuroendocrine markers. We aimed to inves-
tigate transcription factors expression profile in snNENs and ONBs 
and to explore their role in distinguishing these two entities.
Methods: GATA3, SATB2 and CDX2 expression were investigated 
in a series of 26 ONBs and 7 snNENs diagnosed and treated in 
our Institution. ONBs were graded according to Hyams’ system 
(2 grade 1, 13 grade 2, 8 grade 3 and 3 grade 4) and epithelial 
NENs were reclassified into 5 NECs, 1 mixed neuroendocrine/non-
neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs) and 1 amphicrine carcinoma.
Results: Hyams’ grade 1-3 ONBs stained diffusely and intensely 
for SATB2. Grade 4 ONBs and NECs were globally negative, 
including the NEC component of the MiNEN. The intestinal-
type adenocarcinoma (ITAC) component of the MiNEN, like 
the amphicrine carcinoma, was intensely positive. GATA3 was 
heterogeneously expressed in Hyams’ grade 1-3 ONBs, whereas 
grade 4 ONBs, all NENs and the amphicrine carcinoma were 
completely negative. CDX2 was only expressed in the amphicrine 
carcinoma and, as expected, in the ITAC component of the MiNEN.
Conclusion: Our study expands the spectrum of SATB2 and 
GATA3-positive neoplasms and identifies, for the first time, 
SATB2 and GATA3 expression as features of Hyams grade 1-3 
ONBs, suggesting that Hyams grade 4 ONBs are not only clinically 
but also biologically different from low graded ONBs. These 
results are useful in diagnostic daily practice, as highlight that 
the joudicious employment of transcription factors may help in 
correctly diagnosing rare but clinically relevant neoplasms.

patients with squamous cell carcinoma, compared to conventional 
histology. This technique would be considered interesting if it is 
more accurate than frozen section examination.
Methods: We carried out an ex vivo study on lymph nodes from 
patients N0. The two parts of fresh lymph nodes were marked 
with acridine, then imaged with the Histolog Scanner (SamanTree 
Medical, Switzerland) during one minute. In post processing, all 
acquired and anonymized UFCM images were read independently 
by two pathologists and the “UFCM diagnoses” were compared to 
conventional histology.
Results: We included 11/44 patients, i.e. 64 lymph nodes. 8/64 
lymph nodes were metastatic (N+) on conventional histology. On 
Ultra-fast Confocal Microscopy images, one pathologist (PT1) was 
in accordance with conventional histology in 93.75% (95% CI= 
84.8-98.3%) and the other (PT2), in 95.3% (IC95=86.9%-99%). 
PT1 considered as negative one patient, who was finally N+. The 
errors were as follows: the metastatic area has escaped the screen-
ing of the Histolog Scanner image (n=3), and a metastasic area has 
been analysed as «suspect », but not identified as carcinomatous 
(n=1)
Conclusion: Inclusions have now reached 44 patients and 206 
lymph nodes, allowing a robust statistical analysis, which is in 
progress. At this stage, the analysis by Ultra-fast Confocal Micros-
copy seems to be a very promising technique. It could eventually 
replace the frozen section examination, because its diagnostic reli-
ability seems at least equivalent. Furthermore, its speed processing 
(5 minutes) constitutes a major asset.

Sciences, University of Thessaly, Greece
Background & objectives: Oral cancer can be life-threatening 
if not diagnosed early. Precancerous lesions, such as actinic 
cheilitis, can transform into oral cancer. Laminin is a fundamental 
component of basement membrane (BM), its degradation can 
contribute to mucosal malignant transformation.
Methods: Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded biopsies from 
46 patients with oral lesions (37 males and 9 females, mean age = 
67 years) were histologically analysed by hematoxylin and eosin 
staining to diagnose the entity of actinic cheilitis and to classify 
epithelial dysplasia and invasive cancer. Immunohistochemical 
(IHC) analysis was performed to evaluate laminin expression in 
biopsies.
Results: Histological analysis revealed 34 patients with actinic 
cheilitis and 12 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of 
the lip. Three patients with actinic cheilitis had concomitant in situ 
carcinoma. IHC analysis for laminin revealed intense and continu-
ous staining of the BM in all cases of actinic cheilitis with low 
dysplasia, while loss of laminin expression was observed in inva-
sive SCC cases. Interestingly, intracellular expression of laminin 
in parabasal layers of the epithelium was noted in cases of actinic 
cheilitis with high-grade dysplasia/in situ carcinoma.
Conclusion: Laminin expression, by IHC analysis, could be 
useful in the differential diagnosis between actinic cheilitis and 
invasive squamous cell carcinoma, as well as actinic cheilitis 
with low and high-grade dysplasia. Findings from this study 
provide new insights into the mechanisms involved in the 
process of progression of actinic cheilitis into SCC of the lip, 
encouraging in vitro and in vivo studies that may document the 
mechanistic role of laminin in this process.

Exploration of the transcriptomic landscape of HPV-positive 
and HPV-negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma 
upon development of cisplatin resistance
H. Crane*, K. Hunter, S.F. El-Khamisy
*University of Sheffield, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Car-
cinoma (OPSCC) has seen a dramatic increase over the past few 
decades. OPSCC is frequently treated with a chemoradiotherapy 
regime including cisplatin, but resistance can develop in some 
patients which may be difficult to treat.
Methods: To develop a cisplatin resistant cell line model, a HPV-
positive (UDSCC2) and a HPV-negative (UMSCC89) cell line were 
treated over several months with increasing cisplatin concentra-
tions. Single cell clones were selected and assessed using clono-
genic survival assays. Following RNA-Sequencing the reads were 
quantified using Salmon and differential expression analysis was 
conducted using the package DESeq2 in R.
Results: Clonogenic survival assays revealed the selected clones were 
more resistant to cisplatin compared to the parental cells. One HPV-
positive and one HPV-negative resistant clone were selected for RNA-
Sequencing alongside their parental counterparts. Differential expression 
analysis between parental and resistant cells revealed there were 1234 dif-
ferentially expressed genes in the HPV-positive group and 1521 differen-
tially expressed genes in the HPV-negative group. 243 of these genes were 
seen to be differentially expressed in both the HPV-positive and HPV-
negative resistant clones. Using gene pathway analysis, multiple path-
ways were seen to be involved upon development of cisplatin resistance, 
including epithelial to mesenchymal transition and apoptotic signalling.
Conclusion: This study provides an insight into the transcriptomic 
landscape of HPV-positive and HPV-negative OPSCC upon devel-
opment of cisplatin resistance. Following validation, expression 
of selected markers will be assessed in tumour samples to explore 
their potential as a prognostic biomarker.

noma of the oral cavity has significantly intensified in the last 
decade. Here, we focused on sensitive mutation analysis of resec-
tion margins that could improve the prediction of relapse and/or 
sensitivity to specific drugs.
Methods: DNA was isolated from 26 patients (tumour, periph-
eral blood and margins in total 3 samples/patient). We performed 
Illumina sequencing using a panel of 88 cancer genes. Only

non-synonymous variants in tumour margins that were reported 
in the ClinVar database as “pathogenic”, “likely pathogenic” or 
“uncertain significance”, and were simultaneously not present in 
the peripheral blood, were selected for further analysis.
Results: In total, we found 21 mutated genes, among them mainly 
tumour suppressor genes involved in DNA repair. We detected 
mutations in DNA isolated from 22/26 tumours, and in 5/26 tumour 
margins. Gene TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene fol-
lowed by BRCA1/2 and CDKN2A. The median tumour load was 
2 pathogenic mutation per patient on average (range 0-9). This 
parameter did not correlate with the presence of histological mark-
ers like perineural invasion probably due to small cohort size. Sim-
ilarly, we did not observe association of mutations in resection 
margins and probability of disease relapse.
Conclusion: The spectrum of the tumour mutations is similar as in 
other studies with the exception of mutations in the BRCA genes, 
which were not found frequently mutated in OSCC (12-19%). The 
data in the literature suggests BRCA mutation in OSCC examined 
by imunohistochemistry technique ranges from 44% (139patients) 
to 63% (60patients). Variants identified in our dataset are often 
introducing stop codons leading to truncated and non-functional 
proteins. The potential application of BRCA(PARP) inhibitors for 
OSCC needs to be elucidated.

Y. Kalashnyk-Vakulenko
*Kharkiv National Medical University, Ukraine
Background & objectives: Pleomorphic adenoma (РА) of parotid 
salivary glands (PSG) with squamous metaplasia, keratin cysts 
formation (keratinizing PA) is not common and causes difficulties 
in diagnosis. The objective was to analyse three cases from practice 
of keratinizing PA of parotid salivary glands.
Methods: Surgical material from two women, one man with 
keratinizing PA was studied. The mean patients’ age was 
36.3±2.1 years. In two cases, primary surgical treatment was 
performed, in one case – secondary, due to relapse. During 
examination it was noted in PSG a painless nodule of dense 
consistency in diameter from 1.5 to 4.5 cm. Histological, 
histochemical methods were used.
Results: Macroscopically in three cases the nodes on the cut were 
of whitish-pinkish colour with cyst formation. Microscopically, the 
tumour was characterized by the predominance of the parenchymal 
(epithelial) component over the mesenchymal (stromal) one. The 
epithelial component was represented by epithelial, myoepithelial 
cells. Epithelial cells were of basaloid, spindle-cell, squamous, 
clear-cell type. They formed nests, strands with numerous foci 
of squamous metaplasia and keratinous cysts lined by squamous 
epithelium and containing eosinophilic keratin substance. The 
stroma was represented by connective tissue, vessels and myxoid, 
chondroid, osteoid, mucoid zones. In two cases, the tumour was 
surrounded by a distinct fibrous capsule with tumour invasion; in 
one case the capsule was absent.
Conclusion: Morphological diagnosis of keratinizing PA causes 
certain difficulties for pathologists and requires a differential diag-
nosis with mucoepidermoid carcinoma, necrotizing sialometapla-
sia, squamous cell carcinoma. In the studied cases, morphological 
examination revealed a keratinizing PA of PSG with a predomi-
nance of the epithelial component over the mesenchymal one. The 
presence the relapse in one case in anamnesis; tumour invasion into 
the capsule in two cases, absence the capsule in one case indicate 
that keratinizing PA is prone to recurrence.

Sciences, Moscow, Russia
Background & objectives: Middle ear paragangliomas (MEPGLs) 
are rare neuroendocrine tumours occurring on the medial promon-
tory wall of the middle ear. MEPGLs are highly hereditable, being 
susceptible to mutations in driver genes, such as SDHx coding for 
succinate dehydrogenase subunits.
Methods: Total of 28 MEPGLs were subjected to genetic test-
ing on the presence of SDHx variants using Sanger sequencing 
on an ABI PRISM 3500xL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) based on 
designed specific primers for all exons of target genes.
Results: Four pathogenic mutations (4/28, 14%) were 
found among studied MEPGLs: missense and nonsense 
variants in the SDHB gene, [NM_003000.3:c.689G>A 
(rs587782604) and NM_003000.3:c.79C>T (rs74315369)], 
respectively, as well as two missense mutations in the 
SDHD gene, [NM_003002.4:c.305A>G (rs104894302) and 
NM_003002.4:c.274G>С (rs80338845)]. This work was per-
formed using the equipment of EIMB RAS “Genome” centre 
(http://www.eimb.ru/ru1/ckp/ccu_genome_c.php).
Conclusion: According to the literature on head and neck 
paragangliomas, SDHB variants are most frequent (33%), 
followed by SDHD variants (21%). This research showed low 
and close frequencies (7%) for variants both in SDHB and SDHD 
genes for Russian patients with MEPGLs. These results are 
similar to those for patients with MEPGL in other populations. 
Thus, development of MEPGLs may be linked with prevalence of 
mutations in other PGL susceptibility or cancer-associated genes.

*Department of Pathology. Hospital de la Santa Creu i de Sant 
Pau, Spain
Background & objectives: Inverted Papilloma (IP) is a rare 
sinonasal tumour with local destructive potential and risk of 
malignant transformation. The aim of this study is to compare 
clinicopathologic features of a multirecurrent IP group and a 
none-multirecurrent IP group and its HPV status.
Methods: We reviewed clinical and pathological data of patients 
diagnosed of IP during the period of 1978-2020 in our institu-
tion and selected the recurrent cases. The IP group with more 
than one recurrence, treated by diverse surgical procedures, was 
compared with another group of IP with one recurrence. We per-
formed p16 IHQ (Dako) study and HPV Genomic PCR.
Results: The study included 152 patients from which 22 had 
recurrent IP.13 patients had multirecurrent IP,9 were males with 
a median age of 59, 11tumours were localized in ethmoid-sphe-
noid sinuses. Four patients were smokers,2 had allergy and 2 had 
toxic exposures. Three IPs in the multirecurrent group showed 
low-grade dysplasia and one SCC.p16 was positive in 8cases, in 2 
PCR showed presence of HPV, one determination negative and 10 
not valuable. Nine patients presented with none-multirecurrent 
IP,8 were males with a median age of 56, 6 were localized in 
ethmoid-sphenoid sinuses. Five patients were smoker and 1 had 
toxic exposure. They had not dysplasia or SCC associated.p16 
was positive in 3cases but PCR were not valuable.

Conclusion: IP is a benign sinonasal tumour with malignant poten-
tial. In our series, 1/22 had squamous cell carcinoma transforma-
tion and 13/22 had more than one recurrences. The aetiology is 
yet unknown and probably multifactorial with a main role of HPV 
infection. Our findings suggest that the HPV status may be associ-
ated with a higher risk of recurrences and dysplastic transforma-
tion, but further investigation is needed.

*Laboratory of Regenerative Hematopoiesis, Institute of Bioen-
gineering, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) 
& Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Lausanne 
(UNIL), Switzerland
Background & objectives: Bone marrow(BM) assessment is a 
multiparametric evaluation of which cellularity constitutes one 
parameter. In diagnostic practice, the assessment is based on a 
semi-quantitative estimation which is time-consuming. In this 
study, we validated MarrowQuant2.0, within QuPath software, a 
digital hemopathology tool.
Methods: MarrowQuant2.0 quantifies four compartments 
within the BM (hematopoietic cells, adipocytes (using Stardist), 
interstitiumμvasculature, and bones) and measures the cellularity 
of human BM trephine biopsies. We calculated the cellularity in 
a series of retrospective biopsies (training set n=36; experimental 
set n=157H&E). Using intraclass coefficient of correlation(ICC), 
specificity and sensitivity tests, we measured the agreement 
between MarrowQuant 2.0’s quantification and clinical reference.
Results: Our algorithm was capable of accurate, rapid, and 
robust segmentation (average accuracy 0.86, n=36). There 
was an excellent agreement between MarrowQuant 2.0 and the 
clinical reference (ICC=0.978(95% CI0.955-0.989), R2=0.93). 
MarrowQuant 2.0 performed in a comparable way as to the 
clinical reference when used on a set of BM trephine biopsies from 
clinical routine diagnosis(n=42). We found reciprocity between 
the hematopoietic and adipocytic compartments in the context of 
an extreme case of BM remodelling, except for cases with stromal 
expansion. MarrowQuant2.0 can also leverage an adipocyte-
based StarDist model, a deep-learning-based segmentation 
algorithm, implemented as an extension in QuPath, offering an 
accurate segmentation of individual adipocytes and a size-based 
classification.
Conclusion: Our tool may represent a useful adjunct for experi-
mental and clinical hematopathology. We will use MarrowQuant 
2.0. to link output with clinical parameters using dimension reduc-
tion and clustering methods to visualize and explore a potential 
prognostic value in myeloid malignancies.

Convolutional neural network-based algorithm for the detec-
tion and quantification of the components of the histologic 
grading of breast ductal adenocarcinoma - the first results
G. Olteanu*, D. Kumar, M. Köteles, I. Mihai
*Spitalul Clinic de Boli Infecțioase și Pneumoftiziologie Dr.Victor 
Babeș Timișoara, Romania
Background & objectives: The current grading system for ductal 
adenocarcinoma NOS of the breast (DAC-NOS), is prone to low 
reproducibility, subjectivity, and is overall time-consuming. Here, 
we trained a convolutional neural network-based algorithm (CNN-
bA) to detect and quantify the components for grading DAC-NOS.
Methods: 100 whole slide images (WSI) of diagnostic slides and 
10 training slides (TS) with DAC-NOS were selected from the 
TCGA-BRCA dataset and subsequently uploaded to a WSI manage-
ment server (Aiforia Technologies Oy, Helsinki, Finland). Briefly, 
the CNN-bA (Aiforia version 4.8, Aiforia Create, Aiforia Tech-
nologies Oy) was trained on the 10 TS to detect and quantify the 
components for grading DAC-NOS.
Results: After a successful model was established, the model was 
used to detect and quantify the histological components of DAC-
NOS: tumour tissue (TT), tubule and gland formation (T + GF), 
solid tumour (ST) aspect, nuclear pleomorphism (NP) and mitotic 
count (MC). Next the results were exported and interpreted. Here, 
we report the first results of this pilot program. Successful training 
for TT, T, and GF or ST aspects was achieved after 3 iterations of 
the model. Unsuccessful training for NP and MC was reported and 
this represents the limitations of the results, and the baseline for 
future improvements that need to be addressed for the subsequent 
improved artificial intelligence (AI) model.
Conclusion: AI in digital pathology represents the successful 
evolution of diagnostic pathology. While at times difficult, this 
transition is successfully implemented in in vitro diagnostics (IVD) 
platforms. Complex diagnostic algorithms used by pathologists like 
grading DAC-NOS are laborious to translate into an AI model. We 
report preliminary data (successful and unsuccessful data points) 
for a CNN-bA AI model that detects and quantifies components of 
the histologic grading of DAC-NOS with the aim of constructing 
the framework for a future IVD model.

Refining pre-analytic deficiency reporting and capture in 
the anatomical pathology laboratory: a quality improvement 
initiative
T. Truong*, P. Roopchand, T. Jordan, Z. Ghorab, E. Slodkowska, 
M. Downes
*Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, Canada
Background & objectives: Pre-analytic, notably pre-laboratory, 
deficiencies are estimated to account for ~70% of laboratory errors. 
Herein, we reviewed pre-analytic deficiency (PAD) data at our 
institution to develop strategies for improved PAD documentation, 
allowing for identification of PADs and improvement of quality 
performance.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 12 months of data at an 
academic, tertiary referral centre, which was captured from three 
sources: Laboratory information system (LIS), corporate risk man-
agement reporting system and manual paper logs. We also inter-
viewed accessioning staff to determine barriers to data recording.
Results: 237 PAD were recorded in one year. Of these, 72% 
(n=171) were pre-laboratory and 28% (n=66) were in labora-
tory. Specimen procurement accounted for 79% (n=134) of all 
pre-laboratory PAD followed by deficient requisitions, 12% (n= 
21). Failure to adhere to specimen handling protocols accounted 
for 37.5% (n=25) of in-laboratory PAD with accessioning errors 
contributing to 23% (n= 15). Barriers to incident documentation 
were: time required, multiple systems being used and free-hand

data entry under 92 separate headings with no protocol to deter-
mine categories of incidents. Therefore, the following consensus 
categories were created: specimen collection, requisition, packag-
ing, transportation, reception, accessioning, specimen preparation 
and missing histology alerts.
Conclusion: To streamline PAD documentation, manual logs were 
eliminated, all reporting was moved to LIS under the above eight 
categories and accessioning staff was trained on data entry under 
the new categories. Mandatory deficiency check has been imple-
mented in LIS for the accessioning bench, before the specimen 
is further processed. Deficiency entry protocol for the grossing 
bench and histology lab are also currently being optimized for LIS 
integration in the next phase of the project.

NLP in diagnostic texts from nephropathology
M. Legnar, C. Weis*
*University Medical Centre, Germany
Background & objectives: Nephropathology is a sub-discipline 
with complex diagnostic patterns and terms. In addition, reporting 
in a structured manner is a special feature.
Against this background, we investigate whether predicting the 
final diagnosis based on the written description is possible.
Methods: For his work, 1,185 unlabelled nephropathological reports were 
included. (i) First, the diagnosis sections were clustered unsupervised to 
<20 diagnosis groups. Therefore, bag of word-based and embedding-
based text-vectorization methods were used. (ii) Second, different natural 
language processing (NLP) methods for classification were trained to 
predict based on the descriptive report section the diagnosis group.
Results: Regarding text clustering (i), the silhouette-score and 
the classification performance of a support vector machine were 
used to measure clustering accuracy. For both, embedding-based 
approaches (best is a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from 
Transformer (BERT)) performed slightly better compared to bag 
of word-based (best is latent Dirichlet allocation) approaches. Ana-
lysing the clusters for keywords shows that some clusters can be 
mapped to diagnostic groups. For example, there is a cluster for 
IgA-nephropathy or one for diseases with glomerular necrosis.
Again, the BERT-based approach worked best regarding diagnosis 
prediction based on the histological description (ii). Notably, 
there are classification quality differences between the diagnostic 
clusters. Only some groups are almost perfectly predicted.
Conclusion: For nephropathological reports, the morphological 
description alone enables retrieving the correct diagnosis for some 
entities. For other entities, this associative approach does not work 
well. This is in accordance with a previous study on glomerular 
change patterns, where some diagnoses are associated with one 
pattern, and for others, there is a complex pattern combination.
Mapping every diagnosis cluster to a diagnosis group (or a chapter 
in a textbook) is still under investigation while writing this abstract.

*Institute of Pathology, Maccabi Healthcare Services, Israel
Background & objectives: This study aimed to clinically validate 
the performance of a multi-feature AI-based solution on the detec-
tion of gastric carcinoma, high-grade dysplasia and high-grade 
lymphoma, and Helicobacter pylori against rigorous ground 
truth (GT) established by multiple blinded pathologists in gastric 
biopsies.
Methods: The Galen™ Gastric algorithm was examined in a pro-
spective stand-alone performance study using retrospectively col-
lected histopathology slides from two sites. We compared GT diag-
nosis of adult gastric biopsies with the algorithmic results on H&E. 
GT was reached by concordance between two pathologists (original 
report and a new blinded diagnosis by pathologist reviewing slides/
WSIs). Discrepancies were adjudicated by an expert pathologist.
Results: The AI algorithm demonstrated very high accuracy for 
the detection of gastric adenocarcinoma, high-grade dysplasia and 
high- grade lymphoma, with AUC of 0.986. Analysing 544 cases 
(82 positive), demonstrated sensitivity of 96.34%, specificity of 
88.74%, and NPV of 99.27%. Additionally, the algorithm achieved 
an AUC of 0.966 for the detection of H. pylori in analysis of 525 
cases (112 positives), with sensitivity of 91.07%, specificity of 
90.56%, and NPV of 97.40% %. We will further report on additional 
pathologies, e.g., low-grade lymphoma, low-grade dysplasia, and 
Adenoma.
Conclusion: This study reports the successful clinical validation 
of the Galen™ Gastric multi-feature AI solution in the accurate 
detection of a broad range of pathological features, including gas-
tric adenocarcinoma, H. pylori, neuroendocrine neoplasms and 
more, offering an important tool for computer-aided diagnosis in 
routine pathology practice, supporting pathologists in their diag-
nostic work.

maso, L. Sironi
*Department of Physics "G.Occhialini", University of Milano-
Bicocca, Italy
Background & objectives: Iron overload disorders diagnosis 
currently relies on blood tests and genotyping. However, liver 
biopsies remain an invaluable tool for prognostic purpose. We 
developed a pipeline to quantify iron deposits in whole-slide 
images (WSI) of liver biopsy marked with Perls stain.
Methods: The study is based on 10 WSI of liver biopsies with 
different amount of iron. WSI were analysed on different scales 
to quantitatively and objectively reproduce the standard clinical 
procedure followed by pathologists. The cells stained by Perls 
stain (PS) were segmented and quantified by exploiting two 
methods: Optical Density (OD) colour thresholding and a custom 
spectral phasor approach.
Results: Our pipeline is able to quantitatively retrieve: the per-
centage liver biopsy covered by PS, the mean intensity of PS 
stain, the density and dimension of PS granules, PS heterogene-
ity. Different background properties of WSI were buffered using 
a colour correction procedure. Moreover, heatmap overlays are 
generated to address statistically significant tissue patches (i.e., 
more densely stained, higher/lower intensity areas, PS deposits 
dimensions). Data generated by the pipeline had < 5% of error 
from pathologist’s evaluation.
Conclusion: Our pipeline warrants a rapid and objective method 
for the evaluation of hepatic iron. Moreover, it can also be tuned 
and applied to different staining protocols (for example Picro-
Sirius Red, used for the quantification of liver fibrosis). Finally, 
the estimated parameters are coupled to heatmap overlays in 
order to obtain intuitive graphical representations of parameter 
differences in the WSI.

tis Karamitopoulou, B. Bode, M. Tinguely Kovarik
*Pathologie Institut Enge, Switzerland
Background & objectives: Re-evaluation of HER2 receptor 
status is recommended following metastatic transformation of 
invasive breast carcinoma to assess for receptor status conver-
sion. We examine the performance of artificial intelligence in the 
determination of HER2 status in metastatic compared to primary 
breast carcinoma.
Methods: 60 slides of matched primary and metastatic invasive 
breast carcinoma were selected from our digitalised cohort of 476 
cases (Roche Ventana DP200 Scanner). HER2 IHC scoring was 
performed by 3 pathologists, and followed with ISH when IHC 
score ≥ +1. Results were compared to those from uPath HER2 
4B5 and Dual ISH algorithms for IHC and ISH respectively.
Results: Overall, there was moderate agreement between pathol-
ogist and AI results (Cohen’s κ 0.43, 95CI 0.25-0.61), with 
higher concordance on metastatic (κ 0.48, 95CI 0.24-0.73) ver-
sus primary cases (κ 0.36, 95CI 0.07-0.64). Breakdown analyses 
revealed the lowest concordance with ISH on metastatic lesions 
(κ 0.23, 95CI 0.04-0.49) where unedited AI overestimated the 
number of positive and equivocal cases. Inter-observer-varia-
bility of HER2 IHC scoring among pathologists was similar for 
primary (Fleiss’ κ 0.77, 95CI 0.68-0.86) and metastatic lesions 
(κ 0.73, 95CI 0.58-0.89). Conversion of HER2 status between 
primary and metastatic lesions was observed in one case, con-
firmed by pathologists and AI on IHC and ISH.
Conclusion: Moderate concordance was observed between AI 
and pathologists in the assessment of HER2 status on primary 
and metastatic breast carcinoma. Concordance between AI and 
pathologists was notably higher with IHC compared to ISH. 
Examination of larger cohort with a diverse range of metastatic 
sites, combined with increased operator input at the time of digi-
tal analysis, may help to determine the feasibility of an auto-
mated digitalised HER2 workup for metastatic breast carcinoma.

*Institute of Pathology, Philipps-University Marburg, Germany
Background & objectives: Assessment of prognosis of breast 
cancer by Ki67 immunohistochemistry is an important element of 
personalized treatment strategies. A precise assessment is crucial 
for clinically relevant therapy decisions. We aimed to evaluate a 
Ki67 quantification tool using whole slide images (WSI).
Methods: 61 Ki67 stained, pre- (preTx) and intra-therapeutic 
core biopsies, as well as corresponding surgical residual disease 
tissue from neoadjuvant GBG trials, were digitalized. Manual 
Ki67 scoring was performed by five individual pathologists on 
WSI (multi-observer), while semi-automated Ki67 scoring was 
done using VMscope’s Scan Connect (multi-tumour-area). Scan 
Connect analysed up to four 600x600dpi areas on WSI, followed 
by pathologist supervision.
Results: The Pearson correlation between manual (man.) and 
computational (aut.) Ki67 assessment was r=0.781, with no 
significant differences in overall scoring or global precision 
(p=0.333, p=0.070). Semi-automated multi-area analysis on 
preTx tissues had a significantly lower variability than manual 
assessment (n=29, p<0.001), while showing no differences on 
intra-therapeutic samples (n=29, p=0.885). Using predefined 
cut offs, we observed that in Ki67 low and intermediate (int.) 
groups standard deviations (sd) were lower, while being higher 
for Ki67 high group, irrespectively of the assessment method 
(man. & aut.: low sd=±3.4 & ±2.0; int. sd=±4.3 & ±3.9; high 
sd=±18.2 & ±12.7). In comparison with full-automated assess-
ment, the supervised semi-automated assessment improved the 
precision significantly (p=0.008).
Conclusion: We found strong correlation between manual (multi-
observer) and supervised semi-automated (multi-tumour-area) Ki67 
assessment. In comparison to inter-observer variance in manual 
Ki67 assessment, improved precision was seen in semi-automated 
assessment considering intra-tissue variance. VMscope’s Scan-
Connect software could be a useful tool in pathological cancer 
diagnostic. As a next step, results should be validated in a larger 
cohort and survival data could be included to examine prognostic 
differences between the two methods.

Leveraging deep learning-based mitosis detection models for 
supporting automated breast cancer grading
K. Korski*, K. Badowski, X. Li, Y. Nie, S. Abbasi-Sureshjani
*F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Switzerland
Background & objectives: The mitotic figure count within 10 
HPF in a mitosis-dense region is the only mitosis-based metric 
used for tumour grading in breast cancer. We present an innovative 
spatial statistical analysis of mitoses driven by an automatic mitotic 
figure detection method.
Methods: Mitotic figure candidates are detected using a detector 
neural network and are then filtered by a classifier neural network 
with customised architecture. The density and spatial distribution 
of detected mitotic figures and their relationship to tumour grade 
are investigated, using G-function that characterises probability 
distribution of nearest neighbour distances and Getis-Ord Gi sta-
tistics that detects local hotspots.
Results: A mitotic figure classification model with 83.06% 
validation accuracy, was applied on 131 test slides includ-
ing 18, 47 and 66 slides with tumour grade I, II and III, 
respectively. Mitotic density showed 0.3987 Pearson (0.4660 
Spearman) correlation with tumour grade. The area between 
observed and theoretic G-function suggested that nearest 
neighbours of mitotic figures were closer when tumour grade 
is higher. Group comparison p-values for tumour grade I vs II, 
II vs III, were 0.0069, 0.019 respectively. The hotspot ratio 
suggested more hotspots present in higher tumour grade. Group 
comparison p-values for tumour grade I vs II, II vs III, were 
0.015, 0.0036 respectively.
Conclusion: Automatic mitosis detection models enable identify-
ing regions of highest mitotic activity and quantification of the 
tumour proliferation and aggressiveness based both on the pres-
ence of mitotic figures and their relation to their neighbourhood. 
Our spatial analysis identifies metrics that quantify the mitotic 
figure spatial distribution and have statistical power to differenti-
ate between low, intermediate, and higher grade tumours. Future 
work will focus on assessing whether these spatial metrics provide 
additional information over the current standard and ideally better 
prognostic value.

Computer-aided algorithm and 3D imaging technology are sen-
sitive methods in the diagnosis of HER2 expression-low breast 
cancers
Y. Lee*, Y. Hsieh, S. Chang, Y. Chen, Y. Lin, Y. Lin
*National Taiwan University Hospital, Taiwan
Background & objectives: The developed antibody-drug con-
jugates (ADC) show promising results especially in HER2-low 
expression breast cancer defined as immunohistochemically 1+ 
or 2+ with no gene amplification. More sensitive methods can be 
helpful in HER2-low samples diagnosis compared with traditional 
light microscopy examination.
Methods: Two approaches were used to determine HER2 expres-
sion. The computer-aided algorithm on digital pathological slides 
can determine HER2 expression levels. The 3D (three-dimensional) 
imaging approach used 100-μm thickness slide labelled by HER2 
antibody with fluorescence and acquiring image under confocal 
microscopy with optical clearing method. Both methods can be 
successfully applied to retrospective and forward clinical studies.
Results: In computer-aided approach, we developed a workflow 
including tumour recognition and HER2-positive cell counting 
based on 70 WSIs (Whole slide imaging) training dataset. Using 
68-ROIs (Region of interest) cropped from 15-WSIs as validation, 
this method reached 86.7% accuracy and 94.34% sensitivity. 2 
ROIs originally categorized as HER2-negative were reclassified 
as HER2-low by this method.
In 3D imaging approach, HER2 fluorescent stained slides from the 
same 15 validation cohort were acquired under confocal micros-
copy. One of four HER2-negative specimens originally categorized 
by IHC report was reclassified as HER2-low. Using 3D image, 2 of 
15 specimens showed heterogeneous HER2 expression in different 
depth of their thick slides.
Conclusion: This study demonstrated both computer-aided 
algorithm and 3D imaging technology were able to identify 
more HER2-low samples than light microscopy. These sensitive 
methods can detect cases with very low HER2 expression which 
are considered as HER2-negative by traditional light microscopy. 
For patients with very low HER2 expression identified by these 
sensitive methods, more studies are needed to see their clinical 
response to HER2 antibody-drug conjugates.

(PRODI), Biospectroscopy, Germany
Background & objectives: Differential diagnosis of inflamma-
tory bowel disease (IBD) can be challenging but is important for 
treatment decisions and follow-up strategies. We aimed to establish 
label-free quantum cascade laser (QCL)-based infrared imaging 
combined with deep learning as a tool for differential diagnosis.
Methods: Infrared imaging was used to analyse IBD and non-
IBD cases. It is based on the interaction of electromagnetic waves 
with molecules within the tissue creating specific molecular fin-
gerprints. A two-step deep learning approach, based on a modified 
U-Net (CompSegNet), was applied. The first instance differentiates 
IBD from non-IBD. The second instance differentiates between 
Crohn’s disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC).
Results: The cross-sectional sample set consisted of formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections from biopsies of 
CD (n=102), UC (n=52), and control cases (n=70). These cases 
were equally separated in the sub-cohort train (n=99), test (n=66), 
and validation (n=59). With the first instance CompSegNet, we 
achieved a validation area under receiver operating characteristic 
(AUROC) of 0.99 (sensitivity 95%, specificity 91%) in distinguish-
ing between non-IBD and IBD. The subsequent second instance 
differentiation between CD and UC provided a AUROC of 0.89 
(sensitivity 93%, specificity 83%).
Conclusion: Our approach provides an objective and label-free 
tissue diagnosis in IBD distinguishing between CD and UC. With 
an increased number of patients and longer training phases, we 
expect a more accurate and robust classification. The combination 
of spatial and biochemical information encoded in the infrared 
images allows to track changes on the molecular level. Overall, this 
approach has the potential to become a widely applicable diagnos-
tic tool for IBD and maintains intact tissue for further molecular 
analysis.

and Clinical Sciences, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden 
and Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization (CMIV), 
Linköping University, Sweden
Background & objectives: For clinical adoption of AI, models 
must be robust when applied to new settings. Objective of this 
study was to test the generalization potential of a pretrained deep 
learning (DL) model to unseen data and to a new diagnostic 
domain.
Methods: Whole slide images from Linköping, Sweden, with 
exhaustively annotated tumour regions, and publicly available 
CAMELYON data were used. Previously developed DL for breast 
cancer metastases detection in sentinel lymph nodes, developed 
using CAMELYON data, was used as baseline. The model was 
tested on sentinel nodes and lymph nodes from axillary dissections 
(n =51 and n=17, respectively; both Linköping).
Results: Base model showed decreased performance on Linköping 
data (AUC 0.929; 95%CI 0.800-0.998 and FROC 0.744; 95%CI 
0.566-0.912), compared to the performance on CAMELYON data. 
A large FROC decrease was found for the base model applied to 
axillary nodes. The model was retrained, using both CAMELYON 
and Linköping WSI, resulting in increased performance for both 
sentinel nodes and axillary nodes (both AUC p<0.05). Pathologist 
qualitative evaluation of the outputs of the retrained model showed 
no missed positive slides and in 21 of 24 positive slides slide-
level diagnoses matched the clinical ground truth. False positives 
and false negatives were observed. One previously undetected 
micrometastasis was identified as a result of using DL.
Conclusion: The study highlights the generalization challenge 
(even when using DL trained on multi-centre data), both as a result 
of applying DL in a new diagnostic setting for the initial indication, 
but even more remarkably, a slight change in indication impacted 
the model´s performance even more. Retraining the model, includ-
ing data from target application, could mitigate the problem. Fur-
ther studies are required to explore strategies to overcome the 
generalization challenge and evaluate what model performance is 
needed for different clinical applications.

The use of digital pathology and artificial intelligence in the 
assessment of multiple myeloma
M. McCabe, K. Sheehan*, S. Glavey
*Royal College of Surgeons, Ireland
Background & objectives: Plasma cell quantification in bone 
marrow trephines is an essential part of the diagnosis of multiple 
myeloma. Artificial intelligence (AI) is ideally suited for classifi-
cation and quantification tasks but has not yet been employed in 
analysing the full myeloma microenvironment.
Methods: Twenty-two trephines from patients with myeloma were 
retrieved from the archives and whole slide imaging performed 
at 40x (Objective Imaging). Using a deep learning convolutional 
neural network (HALO-AI, Indica), the algorithm was trained to 
segregate and quantify bone marrow tissue and cellular phenotypes. 
In addition, spatial analysis was performed to assess the relation-
ship of plasma cells within the marrow microenvironment.
Results: The trained classifier showed excellent segregation of marrow 
tissue elements as well as quantification of the different cell phenotypes on 
a Haematoxylin & Eosin stain. The mean number of plasma cells across the 
cases was 60,300 and mean density 1,637/mm2, occupying an average of 
67% of the cell constituents. It was also noted that eosinophil numbers were 
increased (mean 4,900/trephine; 7% of all cells). Analysis of other marrow 
constituents demonstrated an inverse correlation between increasing plasma 
cell numbers and other cell types. Spatial analysis revealed a higher plasma 
cell density/mm2 with increasing distance from bone, although at a distance 
of 200uM, overall plasma cell numbers were reduced.
Conclusion: In this study, we have successfully applied AI to the clas-
sification of tissue types in multiple myeloma bone marrow biopsies. 
Using cellular phenotyping, it was possible to quantify plasma cells 
without immunohistochemistry, as well as other cell types in the mar-
row microenvironment in a more reproducible manner. This is a useful 
diagnostic adjunct for Pathologists and enables us to further study the 
relationship between the pattern of disease burden and overall prog-
nostic indicators for patients with this disease.

Optimization of automated tissue classification in 
histopathological images: use of a deep transfer learning 
approach on a pancreatic cancer cohort

Schlensog, T. Rau, A. Pandyra, K. Lang, I. Esposito, P. Lang
*Institute of Pathology, Heinrich Heine University & University 
Hospital Duesseldorf, Germany
Background & objectives: Neuronal networks (NNs) can assist 
with the analysis of digitalized histological slides. However, 
training of NNs can be hampered when training samples contain 
not one, but several tissue types. Our aim was overcome this 
problem by using deep transfer learning.
Methods: Image tiles were extracted from tissue microarrays with 
samples from 223 pancreatic cancer patients. Tiles contained pan-
creatic cancer, healthy pancreas, lymph nodes, but also confounders 
such as adiopse tissue. To purify the training data, we performed 
a data clean-up step using two communicating NNs (communica-
tors). Subsequently, data was used to train NNs, which were then 
validated using an independent dataset.
Results: By feeding pre-existing datasets containing confounders 
such as adipose tissue as well as our own training datasets into two 
communicating NNs (communicators), we received a selection of 
unequivocal tissue tiles for NN training. A ResNet-18-based NN 
re-trained with these data achieved a higher weighted accuracy over 
all tissue classes (94%) than after training with raw data (90%). 
Additionally, we tested 72 NNs using an independent dataset cre-
ated from H&E-stained whole-slide images. NNs were able to 
distinguish between pancreatic cancer, healthy pancreas, lymph 
nodes and adipose tissue following training with purified data. 
Performances varied and depended on various factors, such as the 
learning rate and the optimizers used.
Conclusion: Automated classification of histological tissue types 
in a pancreatic cancer cohort can be optimized by using communi-
cator-driven data pre-processing. In the future, we aim to explore 
whether a similar approach can also be used to optimize other 
classification tasks, e.g., the distinction between pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma and cholangiocellular carcinoma on digitalized 
H&E slides.

Inter-rater agreement of pathologists on determining cell-level 
PD-L1 status in non-small cell lung cancer

Laak, K. Grünberg, M. Looijen-Salamon, S. Vos, F. Ciompi
*Radboud University Medical Center, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) based quan-
tification of cell-level PD-L1 status enables spatial analysis and 
allows reliable and reproducible assessment of the tumour propor-
tion score. In this study, we assess the cell-level inter-pathologist 
agreement as human benchmark for AI development and validation.
Methods: Three pathologists manually annotated the centres of 
all nuclei within 53 regions of interest in 12 whole-slide images 
(40X magnification) of NSCLC cases and classified them as PD-L1 
negative/positive tumour cells, PD-L1 positive immune cells or 
other cells. Agreement was quantified using F1 score analysis, with 
agreement defined as annotations less than 10 um apart and of the 
same class.
Results: An average of 9044 nuclei (1550 negative, 2367 positive 
tumour cells, 1244 positive immune cells, 3881 other cells) were 
manually annotated by the three pathologists. The mean F1 score 
over pairs of pathologists at dataset level was 0.59 (range 0.54-
0.65). When split across classes, the mean per-pair F1 scores stay 
approximately the same, indicating the readers perform similarly 
regardless of cell type. Besides human variability in manual point 
annotations with respect to the centre of nuclei, lack of context 
contributed to disagreement: readers who reported they solely 
examined the ROIs tended to disagree more with readers that 
reported they also looked outside the ROIs for additional (mor-
phological/density) information.
Conclusion: Agreement on determining the PD-L1 status of 
individual cells is only moderate, suggesting a role for AI. By 
quantifying the inter-rater agreement of pathologists, we have 
created a human benchmark which may serve as an upper bound 
(and could be combined via majority vote) for the validation of AI 
at cell level, something not done previously. Cell-level AI-based 
assessment of PD-L1 may supersede slide level scoring, adding 
significant information on the heterogeneity and spatial distribution 
over the tumour.

Background & objectives: Nuclei detection in histopathology 
images is an important prerequisite step of downstream research 
and clinical analyses, such as counting cells and spatial interac-
tions. In this study, we developed an AI-based nuclei detector using 
the YOLOv5 framework in whole-slide NSCLC cases.
Methods: Our dataset consisted of 42 PD-L1 stained cases (30 
training, 12 test). Four trained (non-expert) readers manually 
annotated all nuclei (both positive/negative) within regions 
of interest (ROIs) viewed at 40X magnification. We trained a 
YOLOv5(s) network on annotations of one reader. Performance 
was measured using F1 score analysis; hits were defined as 
being less than 10 um away from annotations.
Results: We evaluate YOLOv5 on the test set by pairing it against 
all four readers separately. There, YOLOv5 performs excellently, 
falling within the interrater variability of the four readers: the mean 
F1 score over algorithm-reader pairs is 0.84 (range 0.76-0.92) 
while the mean F1 score over pairs of readers is 0.82 (range 0.76-
0.86). When we determine the cell count (number of annotations/
predictions) per ROI in the test set, agreement of algorithm-reader 
pairs and reader pairs is equally well aligned: 0.93 (range 0.90-
0.97) versus 0.94 (range 0.92-0.96). Visual inspection indicates 
YOLOv5 performs equally well on PD-L1 positive and negative 
cells.
Conclusion: We have trained a nuclei detector that performs within 
the interrater variability of four human readers. In future work, 
we could extend this detector to additional tissues and immuno-
histochemistry stainings. Moreover, this detector could be used 
as a AI-assisted manual point annotation tool: while human read-
ers perform the (context-driven) task of delineating homogeneous 
regions (e.g. clusters of PD-L1 positive stained cells), the detector 
performs the (local, yet laborious) task of identifying individual 
nuclei within these regions, providing labelled point annotations.

Automated annotation of digital H&E/SOX10 dual stains gen-
erates high-performing convolutional neural network for cal-
culating tumour burden in H&E-stained cutaneous melanoma

*Dept. of Pathology, Aarhus University Hospital and Dept. of 
Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Denmark
Background & objectives: Deep learning for analysis of H&E 
stains requires a large annotated training set; a labor-intensive task 
that often involves highly skilled pathologists. We aim to develop 
and evaluate computer-assisted annotation based on digital dual 
stains of the same tissue section.
Methods: H&E stains of primary (n=48) and metastatic (n=48) 
melanoma were digitized, re-stained with SOX10, and re-scanned. 
Images were aligned, and automated annotations of SOX10 stains 
based on thresholding and a trained convolutional neural network 
(CNN) were thus directly transferred to H&E stains of the training 
set (n=37). Training of the final CNN for calculating tumour 
burden included 1,221,367 annotated nuclei.
Results: For primary melanomas, nuclei-annotation precision 
was 99.7% (95%CI=99.4%;99.9%) for tumour cells and 99.2% 
(95%CI=97.7%;99.7%) for normal cells. With a mean differ-
ence of 7.9% (95%CI=6.1%;9.7%), precision for normal cells 
was markedly reduced for metastases compared with primary 
melanomas (p<0.001). Associated false-positive annotations were 
predominantly related to SOX10-negative tumour cells. Corre-
spondingly, mean SOX10 intensity (red chromaticity) was 0.37 
(95%CI=0.35;0.39) for primary melanomas and subcutaneous 
metastases but 0.32 (95%CI=0.30;0.34) for lymph-node and organ 
metastases (p=0.002). Accuracy of trained CNN for calculating 
tumour burden in primary and subcutaneous lesions was 92.6% 
(95%CI=83.6%;96.8%). Compared with stereological counting, 
mean difference in tumour burden was 5.8% (95%CI=-1.2%;12.9%, 
p=0.10) for CNN and 16% (95%CI=3.7%;28.3%, p=0.02) for rou-
tine eyeballing.
Conclusion: With this annotation technique, a large annotated 
H&E training set with high quality was created within a reasonable 
timeframe for primary melanomas and subcutaneous metastases. 
For these lesion types, the training set generated a high-performing 
CNN for calculating tumour burden, which was superior to routine 
eyeballing. Yet, due to low or missing tumour-cell SOX10 positiv-
ity, advantages were limited in lymph-node and organ metastases. 
To include other cancer types or objects of interest, immunohisto-
chemistry of the technique may easily be modified.

Background & objectives: Digital pathology has become increas-
ingly important in Pathology laboratory practice. The combination 
of whole-slide-based imaging techniques and machine learning has 
been greatly applied to develop visual analytics tools, with great 
contribute to a more accurate and time-effective practice.
Methods: A consortium between BMDSoftware, Computer 
Graphics Center and Institute of Anatomical Pathology and 
Molecular Pathology - Faculty of Medicine/University of 
Coimbra, is developing a collaborative Web platform for digital 
pathology. It is a three years project that began in January of 
2020 and joins the efforts of pathologists, computer science 
researchers and software developers.
Results: The result is a cloud-based platform known as 
iPATH. It allows the visualization of whole-slide images, 
easy navigation through the images, annotations, delimitation 
of areas of interest, and a wide range of measurements. It 
aims the informatization of laboratory routine, tracking 
of all steps, from the reception of samples to the final 
pathologic report, including the management of response 
time. The platform allows the management of the datasets 
annotation process for production but also for supporting 
the development and integration of artificial intelligence 
tools. Currently, Helicobacter pylori identification and 
quantification instrument to apply to gastric biopsies and 
mitoses identification in different neoplasms are the challenges 
being considered as case-study.
Conclusion: Digital pathology is already a reality in many 
Pathology labs across the world, perhaps driven by Covid-19 
pandemic crisis, as it allows remote work. We believe that digi-
tal pathology is just the beginning and a platform for the crea-
tion of decision aid tools through artificial intelligence and deep

Upconversion nanoparticles as labels for histopathological 
tissue evaluation
T. Nilsson*, K. Krawczyk, M. Mickert, S. Andersson-Engels
*Lumito, Sweden
Background & objectives: H&E staining and DAB-labelling 
are the gold standard in pathology, suffer from narrow dynamic 
range, difficulties in quantification and limited possibilities 
regarding multiplexing. We present an upconversion-nanoparticle 
(UCNP)-based technique that allows to overcome problems asso-
ciated with commonly used labelling techniques.
Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast cancer cell 
line and human breast cancer tissue were sectioned and labelled. 
Upconversion imaging of the human tissue sections was con-
ducted in our prototype device and compared with a standard 
DAB-based IHC. The combination of UCNP and haematoxylin 
counterstaining on the same slide was investigated.
Results: Images obtained with our novel device demonstrate 
that our UCNP bioconjugates are excellent labels for the detec-
tion of cancer markers in tissue sections. Brightfield images 
prove that UCNPs do not interfere with the standard tissue 
evaluation by a pathologist. Additionally, brightfield and lumi-
nescent images can be merged to provide a better understand-
ing of tissue morphology.
Conclusion: The emerging field of UCNP-based labelling 
techniques provides new possibilities for more accurate 
diagnosis. Staining solutions and a novel device developed by 
us keep the advantage of H&E staining and combine it, in one 
image, with the UCNP luminescent data. The high-contrast 
images of the UCNP labelling – generated by our scanning device 
– set the foundation for generating ground truth for machine 
learning algorithms.

Computer-assisted diagnosis of early-stage lung adenocarci-
noma using deep learning

Stubbs, J. von der Thüsen
*Department of Pathology and Clinical Bioinformatics, Erasmus 
MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Early-stage lung adenocarcinoma 
growth patterns strongly associate with disease progression. 
Tumour biopsies are subtyped regarding microenvironment 
alterations and growth patterns: lepidic, acinar, papillary, micro-
papillary, and solid. We developed a deep learning (DL) pipe-
line to sub-classify adenocarcinomas to improve pre-operative 
assessments.
Methods: We developed a multi-class DL classification model for 
the prognostically relevant patterns. A retrospective cohort of 129 
whole-slide images of needle-biopsy sections of stage I and II lung 
adenocarcinomas stained with haematoxylin and eosin and their 
corresponding annotations for the regions of interest were used to 
train and validate our DL classification models.
Results: In preliminary experiments, we designed a three-class 
DL model to classify normal tissue, tumour area of combined 
growth patterns, and tumour microenvironment. Compared to the 
ground truth, we reported a high overall accuracy of 0.86. Next, 
we designed a nine-class DL model to individually classify all 
patterns, yielding an overall accuracy of 0.77 and a Dice similar-
ity coefficient of 0.66. We believe the results are influenced by 
class imbalance, introduced by dominant normal tissue, stroma, 
lepidic and solid patterns. Furthermore, high intra-class variability 
and inter-class similarity might have also influenced the results. 
For example, acinar patterns cover heterogeneous morphologies 
ranging from glandular to cribriform patterns, that may resemble 
lepidic patterns.
Conclusion: Our results indicate the potential aggressiveness 
of early-stage lung adenocarcinomas from small biopsy sam-
ples by sub-classifying growth patterns using DL. As we have a 
limited cohort, further training of the model on enriched data-
sets is required. This analysis can guide the extent of the surgical 
approach to maximise the preservation of healthy adjacent tissue 
and increase the patient’s quality of life. However, biopsies might 
misclassify the dominant growth pattern due to sampling error.

A novel machine learning pipeline to analyse unstained liver 
biopsies and automatically quantify tumour-related structures

*Department of Physics "G.Occhialini", University of Milano-
Bicocca, Italy
Background & objectives: Tumour diagnosis is usually performed 
through the visual inspection of stained biopsies. Here, we propose 
a pipeline to support the pathologists’ clinical routine: it avoids 
staining procedures and provides novel quantitative insights to 
improve the diagnosis accuracy.
Methods: Images of unstained liver biopsies, acquired by a whole-
slide scanner, are virtually H&E-stained through a convolutional 
neural network (CNN). Relevant biological structures (e.g. dead 
hepatocytes, cell nuclei, collagen) and tissue dis-architecture (e.g. 
steatosis) are retrieved by exploiting semantic segmentation and 
texture analysis procedures, coupling the phasor approach with 
clustering and semi-supervised machine learning techniques.
Results: The pipeline accuracy has been evaluated on 20 
liver murine biopsies (10 affected by hepatocarcinoma and 10 
healthy controls) by comparing the algorithm output with the 
pathologist’s quantification. In each biopsy, the amount of dead 
hepatocytes, cell nuclei and the extension of steatosis-affected 
regions have been automatically provided, with a mean accuracy 
> 95%. Moreover, the CNN performance in the virtual staining 
procedure has been evaluated for H&E samples. 2000 real and 
virtually stained tissue patches have been pixelwise compared, 
resulting in a colour content discrepancy < 5%.
Conclusion: These preliminary results demonstrate the capabil-
ity of the proposed pipeline to extract quantitative and objective 
information, expanding the tumour feature dictionary, assisting 
pathologists with a more accurate diagnosis and overcoming the 
limitations due to inter-observer variability. Moreover, time and 
resources consumptions due to staining procedures are avoided 
by the H&E virtual colouring provided by the CNN in the images 
pre-processing steps.

Background & objectives: Anthracosis, the black granular pig-
ment in lung tissue, is often wrongfully detected as nuclei by image 
analysis algorithms, leading to high false positive rates in immu-
nohistochemical slides. Here, deep learning models for preemptive 
removal of anthracosis were evaluated.
Methods: From n=8 CD8 stained whole slide images, 128 tiles 
(256x256 px at 0.2431 μm/px) were manually selected and 
annotated to reflect expected lung tissue heterogeneity. Tiles were 
used in 4-fold validation to comparatively evaluate a traditional 
U-Net vs. Xception-based U-Net model (31e6 vs 2e6 parameters). 
For image augmentation, we focused on colour augmentation. 
Model performance was assessed by Dice score.
Results: The traditional U-Net outperformed the Xception-based 
model (0.78 ± 0.22 vs. 0.74 ± 0.22), with its unaugmented ver-
sion performing the best (0.85 ± 0.16). Qualitative assessment 
showed that the models were more precisely segmenting individ-
ual granules versus the coarse annotations provided in the ground 
truth, suggesting superior performance over those suggested by 
quantitative metrics. Faint anthracotic pigments on darker back-
ground (condensate macrophages) and intensively stained CD8-
postitve lymphocytes were common sources of error, with the 
dark combined hematoxylin and DAB at the nuclear membranes 
being detected as false positive anthracosis.
Conclusion: We show that simple U-Net-based models are power-
ful tools for localization of anthracosis. These models should likely 
be included in image analysis pipelines to help eliminate biologi-
cally irrelevant artifacts, thus improving specificity of downstream 
analyses. Augmentation methods did not appear to improve the 
model in identifying potentially relevant morphological features, 
suggesting that colour is insufficiently discriminatory in many 
instances. Next steps will include the refinement of our anthra-
cosis model, including more targeted augmentation methods, and 
combination with nuclei segmentation.

Deep learning neural networks for real-time discrimination 
between osteosarcoma and fracture callus on conventional 
histological (H&E) sections

Tissue, Patras, Greece
Background & objectives: Histopathological discrimination 
between osteosarcomas and fractures can be extremely challenging. 
Herein, we aimed at developing a novel Machine Learning 
architecture (Convolutional Neural Network) for real-time 
discrimination between osteosarcoma and fracture callus based on 
conventional H&E sections under brightfield microscopy.
Methods: We collected 2136 H&E images from 1154 osteosar-
comas and 982 fractures from our archives (n=925) and the web. 
With the data collected, we trained a Convolutional Neural Net-
work (CNN) based on the mobilenet version 3 architecture. Train-
ing set included 2021 images (1086 osteosarcomas, 935 fractures), 
and test set 115 images (68 osteosarcomas, 47 fractures) from new/
unknown to the system cases.
Results: We created a web application that allows microscopes 
to directly connect to either desktop/laptop computers or mobile 
phones, in order to facilitate easy access to the Neural Network 
classifier.
The proposed system is simple to use and delivers real-time high 
accuracy classification regarding the separation of osteosarcoma 
from fracture, with sensitivity 91.3% and specificity 93.75%. Four 
(4) osteosarcomas were falsely classified as fractures; among them 
2 were postchemotherapy osteosarcoma cases with 100% necrosis. 
Two (2) fractures were falsely classified as osteosarcomas.
Conclusion: CNN trained on conventional H&E sections can 
significantly decrease the pathologist’s workload and serve as an 
additional tool towards accurate diagnosis of several pathologies in 
everyday-routine practice. Since this tool is based on conventional 
H&E images and not on WSI, it can be easily used by pathologists 
from remote areas and small hospitals for the diagnosis of osteo-
sarcomas, but also for virtually every pathologic condition, after 
specific training.

Novel approach for adaptive colour normalisation based on 
tissue thickness and biological tissue type variability

*Pramana, Cambridge, MA, USA/India
Background & objectives: Colour variation in H&E and IHC 
slides poses a huge challenge for computational pathology algo-
rithms. We present a novel method for colour normalisation based 
on tissue thickness and biological tissue variability to achieve sig-
nificantly improved performance over existing methods.
Methods: 30 H&E slides of endometrium tissue were scanned 
using Pramana WSI scanner (inline analysis of tissue thickness 
and colour) and data was collected for colour and tissue thickness 
variation using colour distribution map and tissue thickness graphs. 
Colour normalisation was done based on tissue thickness, biologi-
cal tissue variability and colour differences between thick and thin 
tissue areas in the slide.
Results: Visual evaluation by histopathologist revealed that our 
method yielded better results in comparison to existing methods. 
Our method does selective normalisation in the AOI as per the 
requirement after consideration of vectors for tissue thickness, 
biological tissue variability and colour distribution of the target 
AOIs instead of adopting the generic approach uniformly across 
the slide like existing methods. Reference pairing based on close 
matching of the colour distribution range of different colour in the 
target AOI to the reference AOI has improved the performance 
when biological tissue variability vector was also considered. 
Selective application of this approach based on tissue type and 
thickness reduces the over and under colour saturation.
Conclusion: Inline analysis of tissue thickness variation and colour 
hue distribution for all the AOIs in a WSI can help in achieving better 
colour normalisation when biological tissue variability is taken into 
consideration. Target to Reference AOI pairing done on the basis of 
biological tissue type and colour distribution graph allows for selective 
colour normalisation in the target AOI if needed. Both tissue type and 
thickness variation across the AOIs determine the need of selective colour 
normalisation for optimal results.

*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário, Portugal
Background & objectives: Pathology has been integrating tech-
nology into its workflow and there are several algorithms we can 
runout to generate reliable information.
We aimed to determine if nuclear features of cervical HSIL differ 
among patients infected with distinct HPV genotypes.
Methods: We randomly selected 57 HSIL (CIN II and CIN III) cer-
vical biopsies with previous HPV genotypification and scanned one

representative slide of each. We then used a built-in algorithm on 
Aperio ImageScope software [12.4.3.5008] to estimate the average 
nuclear size and the nuclear chromasia of cervical epithelium with 
HSIL and used statistical software to compare the data.
Results: Our sample comprised 18 cases of HPV16, 26 cases of 
HPV-HR and 13 cases of HPV16 and HPV-HR coinfection.
The presence of HPV16 genotype, alone or together with HPV-HR, 
was associated with CIN III (chi-squared = 5,28; p = 0,02).
When comparing the HPV16 group to coinfected 16+HR, we found 
that HPV16 alone had significantly larger nuclei than the coinfec-
tion group (t-test = 2,3; p = 0,03). However, these groups showed 
no difference regarding the nuclear chromasia.
Conclusion: Digital image analysis applied to pathology seems a 
promisor field since it can provide us with essential information 
about our specimen that human eye simply can´t measure. In our 
study, the stronger association was between HPV 16 and CIN III 
but the clinical value of that is uncertain and may need a larger 
study. The same applies to the fact that HPV16 specimens have 
larger nuclei than coinfected 16+HR.

*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Centro Hospitalar e Universi-
tário de Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: In Portugal, for yearly and national 
board exams (NBE),a formal curriculum must be written down. 
In order to organize the registry of routine cases signed out 
during residency, a free internet platform dedicated to curricula 
organization and management (XERPA-MD) has been working 
together with Portuguese residents.
Methods: Members of the residents’ committee of the Portuguese 
Society of Pathologists (NiSPAP) and an independent pathologist 
(coordinator of Anatomic Pathology for XERPA-MD) met regularly 
over a period of 12 months. A database, with neoplastic and non-
neoplastic entities, was built according to the most recent editions 
of the WHO Classification of Tumours books, as well as other well-
known bibliographic references in the field of surgical pathology.
Results: The database follows the Portuguese College of Patholo-
gists curricular guidelines. After three rounds of work (data input, 
data correction, and data review), a total of 5500 entities were 
organized. Users are now able to access the database online and to 
register all their curricular activities in a structured and systematic 
way. All inserted records can be reviewed, organized, managed, and 
exported automatically, saving several hours of work.
Conclusion: Pathology residency is a critical period in the lives 
of all pathologists worldwide, with lots of study, routine cases and 
diverse scientific activities to be performed. The formal curriculum 
must include, among several other extensive registries, a thorough 
and organized list of all routine cases signed out during residency. 
Quite understandably, this becomes a daunting, exhaustive and 
stressful task, to be done every year, until the NBE. Automatiza-
tion of curricula creation and management greatly decreases the 
time spent by Portuguese Pathologists writing down and organ-
izing data.

enbrink, S. Eppenberger-Castori, L.M. Terracciano, M.C. Pedrosa
*Institute of Pathology and Medical Genetics, University Hospital 
Basel, University of Basel, Switzerland
Background & objectives: Autoimmune Hepatitis(AIH) is one 
of the most challenging diagnoses in liver pathology. We aim 
to develop a deep learning model, Artificial Intelligence for 
Hepatitis[AI(H)] that evaluates liver biopsies, to provide granular, 
quantifiable, and rapid analysis of histological features of AIH.
Methods: One hundred twenty-five pretreatment liver biopsies 
with AIH diagnosis from the biobank of the University Hospital 
Basel were selected and split into training (80%) and test (20%) 
datasets and utilised to train several convolutional neural network 
models in the Aiforia platform. Manuel annotations of target 
regions were created by a hepato-pathologist, and used to train 
and test AI models.
Results: The liver microstructure detection model was trained to 
segment liver tissue into portal or, lobular areas and central vein 
compartments, while the necroinflammation model was trained 
for focal necrosis, interface hepatitis, or confluent necrosis. 
The immune cell classification model can detect, classify, and 
quantify lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, eosinophils, 
and neutrophils. The bile duct model was trained for detecting the 
damaged bile duct.
The four AI models are accurate and efficient in diagnosis of vari-
ous morphological components of AIH biopsies. When evaluated 
on a separate test set(ratios of correct predictions) of 92.9%, 97.1%, 
84.5%, and 99.5% on liver microstructures, necroinflammation fea-
tures, immune cell classification and bile duct damage detection, 
respectively.
Conclusion: AI(H) is a novel diagnostic tool for AIH histology. 
It demonstrates comparable results to manual hepato-pathologist 
assessment for several specific diagnostic tasks on AIH biopsies 
and classifies cell/tissue types a much shorter time. AI(H) is an 
intelligent, fast, accurate, and efficient diagnostic tool. Further 
planned development of AI(H) will allow for more functionalities 
such as portal and lobular necroinflammation, specific inflamma-
tory cells, fibrosis, and bile duct damage.

Nagtegaal, A. Blank, A. Perren, A. Lugli, I. Zlobec
*Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, Switzerland
Background & objectives: Histopathological evaluation of lymph 
node metastasis (LNM) for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients can 
be laborious and time-consuming. We propose an assisting deep 
learning method for CRC-LNM detection by leveraging transfer 
learning with an ensemble model on hematoxylin and eosin slides.
Methods: The proposed deep learning method consists of an LN 
segmentation (UNet) and an ensemble (Xception, Vision Trans-
former) metastasis detection models. LN segmentation model was 
trained on one hundred annotated CRC slides. An ensemble metas-
tasis detection model was trained first on the public breast cancer 
dataset, PatchCamelyon and then fine-tuned on CRC data.
Results: The proposed method was validated on an internal and 
external CRC cohort by analysing AUC, sensitivity, and specific-
ity on a whole slide level. The method achieved an AUC of 98.1% 
in the internal validation cohort (2803 slides) with a sensitivity of 
99.5% and specificity of 96.7%. Around 0.5% of positive slides 
were incorrectly classified as negative due to small isolated tumour

cell clusters (<100um). About 3.3% of negative slides were falsely 
detected as positive, mainly due to tissue folds and active germinal 
centres. In the external validation cohort (1033 slides), the method 
correctly classified 100% of all slides.
Conclusion: The deep learning method developed in this study 
showed excellent performance, making it suitable as an assist-
ing tool for CRC-LNM screening. Future studies should include 
other histological subtypes (mucinous adenocarcinomas, signet 
ring cell carcinomas), investigate the application for other solid 
tumour types next to breast and CRC, as well as improve sensitiv-
ity for more challenging cases (isolated tumour cell clusters). The 
specificity could be improved by detecting and excluding tissue 
folds and germinal centres before applying the metastasis detec-
tion model.

The creation of a virtual pathology department: a novel solu-
tion to a modern crisis
R. Chetty*, J. Fitzgerald, M. Colleluori, D. O’Shea
*DECIPHEX, Ireland
Background & objectives: There are several well-known global 
challenges confronting Pathology that translate into poor TATs, 
lack of expertise/access and ultimately poor patient care. Our 
aim was to alleviate these pressure points to improve patient 
management.
Methods: A multitude of challenges are currently faced in Pathol-
ogy resourcing. To this end, we developed an AI-empowered digi-
tal pathology system using a proprietary, customizable, scanner 
agnostic, cloud-based, LIS integratable, state-of-the-art pathology 
PACS. We then recruited and validated a team of recognized sub-
specialists to constitute the world’s first CQC/CLIA accredited 
virtual pathology department.
Results: Across our pathologist network we currently have 56 
pathologists in funnel across 12 subspecialities. The team is 
geographically distributed across Europe, UK, Canada and the US. 
We have fully validated our pathologists according to RCPath/CAP 
guidelines and have shown over 97% concordance for glass versus 
digital cases. Only minor discordances occurred, and a discordance 
remediation process was put in place whereby blind review of the 
discordant case was performed again and diagnostic accuracy 
recorded. We are currently producing successful turnaround times 
of <2 days in pilot trials. Pathologist efficiency has improved with 
the use of measuring and mitoses counting tools, including Ki-67 
quantification.
Conclusion: Overall Client hospital satisfaction is highly evident 
with TAT decreased, no mailing of slides required, MDT ready 
reports not being re-typed, and going into LIS directly, saving both 
time and overheads. Pathologist satisfaction, quality control and 
efficiency are evaluated for this disruptive workflow, with net pro-
moter score systems and tools employed to ensure optimal patholo-
gist experience and high-quality reporting achieved.

Morphometric analysis of lysosomes in the renal tubule in mon-
oclonal gammopathy using transmission electron microscopy: 
‘mottled appearance’ and beyond
M. Jung*, H. Lee, K.C. Moon
*Department of Pathology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 
Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Lysosomal ‘mottled appearance’, or 
uneven electron-dense contents related to monoclonal gammopathy 
(MG), has been described in light chain proximal tubulopathy 
(LCPT). We aimed to determine the ultrastructural characteristics 
of lysosomal mottled appearance in kidney biopsies and its 
association with LCPT.
Methods: Seventy-seven biopsies were grouped into LCPT (n = 5), 
MG conditions other than LCPT (n = 43), and non-MG conditions 
(n = 29). The mottled lysosomes in the renal tubules were evalu-
ated using transmission electron microscopy and morphometric 
analysis.
Results: Mottled lysosomes were more prevalent (% of present 
cases) and frequent (no. of mottled lysosomes/20,000x ultrami-
croscopic field) in the LCPT group (100% and 8.20 ± 4.15/field) 
than in the MG (41.9% and 1.13 ± 2.05/field) and non-MG (37.9% 
and 0.80 ± 1.44/field) groups. In morphometric analysis of all mot-
tled lysosomes (n = 520) detected from the 34 biopsies (5 LCPT, 
18 MG, and 11 non-MG), we found that mottled lysosomes were 
larger, more irregular, and more electron-dense for the LCPT group 
than for the MG and non-MG groups.
Conclusion: Mottled lysosomes can be present in disorders other 
than LCPT or even without MG. The morphological characteristics 
of mottled lysosomes could provide objective guidance for the 
diagnosis of LCPT.

Gene expression characteristics of T-cell-mediated alloimmune 
response in HIV-infected kidney transplant recipients
D. Dobi*, A. Zarinsefat, Y. Kelly, P. Stock, Z. Laszik
*Semmelweis University, Hungary
Background & objectives: The graft survival of HIV-infected 
renal transplant recipients are comparable to that of non-HIV 
infected referents. However, the frequency of first-year T-cell-
mediated rejection (TCMR) in the former group is higher. We 
assessed the molecular characteristics of TCMR in HIV-infected 
individuals.
Methods: We studied formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) 
renal biopsy samples from 68 transplant recipients (34 HIV+, 34 
HIV-). The diagnostic groups were normal, borderline changes, 
and TCMR. We applied gene expression analysis on the FFPE 
material by using a panel of 760 targets that included immune-
response-related and HIV genes. We performed differential gene 
expression (DE) analysis and pathway analysis (PA) (reactome 
database).
Results: DE analysis revealed multiple genes with significantly 
increased expression in the diagnostic groups of HIV+ borderline 
changes and HIV+ TCMR relative to their HIV- counterparts. PA 
of these genes showed gene enrichment in the following path-
ways: toll-like receptor cascades, MYD88:MAL cascade, cyto-
solic sensors of pathogen-associated DNA, and NLR-signalling 
among others. HIV genes were not found to be present in the 
biopsy material of HIV-infected patients.
Conclusion: Upregulation of the innate immune pathways in the 
biopsies of HIV+ patients with borderline changes and TCMR 
may indicate the enhanced involvement of natural immunity dur-
ing T-cell-mediated alloimmune response in this patient group. 
This can potentially stem from immune dysregulation caused by 
HIV infection.

Chief renal medullary osmolytes NaCl and urea differen-
tially modulate tubular cellcytokine expression and monocyte 
recruitment

Glomb, H. Haller, J.H. Bräsen, S. von Vietinghoff
*Nephropathology Unit, Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical 
School, Germany
Background & objectives: Extreme electrolyte concentrations 
characterize the renal medulla. Renal immune cells are sentinels 
against ascending bacteria but also promote detrimental inflam-
mation. Here, we investigated how the renal main osmolytes, NaCl 
and urea, regulate tubular cell cytokine expression and monocyte 
chemotaxis.
Methods: Normal kidneys, transplant surveillance and minimal 
change biopsies were stained for macrophages, monocytes and 
cytokines using immunofluorescence and RNA in situ hybridiza-
tion. Tissue cytokine concentrations were measured with ELISA. 
Clinical data, immunosuppressant and diuretic medication were 
extracted from the records. Human renal tubular cells (HK2) were 
exposed to NaCl, urea or mannitol. Gene expression was assessed 
by gene array analysis.
Results: In the healthy human kidney, more monocytes were 
detected in medulla than cortex. The monocyte gradient was attenu-
ated in patients with medullary NaCl depletion by loop diuretic 
therapy and in nephrotic syndrome. Renal tubular epithelial cell 
gene expression responded similarly to NaCl and tonicity control 
mannitol, but not urea. NaCl significantly upregulated chemotactic 
cytokines, e.g., CCL2 and CSF1. This induction was inhibited by 
ROS scavenger n-acetylcysteine. In contrast urea, the main medul-
lary osmolyte in catabolism, dampened tubular epithelial cytokine 
expression. NaCl-, but not urea stimulated tubular epithelium 
or cytokine combinations promoted human classical monocyte 
migration. Consistently, gene array data revealed renal medullary 
chemokine and monocyte marker decrease in catabolic mice.
Conclusion: Our results depict two different renal medullary 
scenarios depending on whether NaCl or urea is the main osmolyte: 
The energy intense state with tubular cell cytokine production 
and recruited myeloid cells in the presence of elevated NaCl 
may aid antibacterial host response. Less cytokine production 
and stable myeloid cell populations in presence of elevated urea 
concentrations may benefit organisms with limited energy supply 
which may also limit detrimental inflammation. This could be a 
basis for additional management strategies of patients.

*1st Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, National and 
Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: The immunomodulatory activity of 
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) often elicits a broad spectrum 
of immune-related adverse effects (IRAEs), in multiple tissues, 
including kidney. We present a case series of renal IRAEs with 
various clinical and histological manifestations.
Methods: Twelve patients, bearing a wide range of solid malig-
nancies, received either PDL-1, or a combination of PDL-1 and 
CTLA-4 inhibitors. Following ICIs administration, clinical signs 
indicative of renal toxicity included acute kidney injury (AKI), 
proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome and/or haematuria. All patients 
underwent renal biopsy, which was processed for light micros-
copy, immunofluorescence, and when tissue sufficed, electron 
microscopy.
Results: The most frequent clinical presentation was AKI and the 
most frequent pathologic alteration was tubulointerstitial nephritis 
(TIN) encountered in six cases. In one of these cases, TIN was 
accompanied by IgA glomerulonephritis. Two patients, present-
ing with nephrotic syndrome, exhibited a secondary “lupus-like” 
membranous glomerulopathy. In one of the latter patients, there 
was TIN as well. Among the remaining three patients with AKI, 
two displayed acute tubular injury as the most prominent finding, 
while in the third, a combination of membranoproliferative glomer-
ulonephritis and thrombotic microangiopathy was identified. The 
last patient developed nephrotic syndrome and a secondary renal 
amyloidosis was detected, on a rheumatoid arthritis background 
presenting after the initiation of ICIs.
Conclusion: Our findings harmonize with bibliographical data that 
identify TIN as the most frequent histological lesion related to ICIs 
administration. The preferential involvement of tubulointerstitial 
tissue could be associated with the higher expression levels of PD-1 
on tubular epithelial cells, compared to glomeruli. On the other 
hand, both secondary “lupus-like” membranous glomerulopathy 
and secondary amyloidosis upon rheumatoid arthritis, are postu-
lated to emerge as a consequence of a systemic immune system 
reconstruction, induced by immune-checkpoints inhibition.

*Kharkiv National Medical University, Ukraine
Background & objectives: Preeclampsia (PE) and iron deficiency 
anaemia (IDA) are pregnancy complications that have a negative 
effect on women health, their offspring. The objective was to reveal 
the compensatory and regenerative potential in newborns kidneys 
that developed under maternal PE, IDA conditions.
Methods: The study material was the tissue of kidneys of new-
borns from mothers with physiological pregnancy (n=28) (group 
(G) 1); complicated pregnancy by PE of varying degrees of severity 
(n=78) (G 2), IDA of varying degrees of severity (n=85) (G 3). 
Histological, immunohistochemical, morphometrical, statistical 
methods were used.
Results: In newborns kidneys of G 2-3 it was revealed a deficiency 
of nephrons with the presence of alterative changes in them, 
hypertrophy of glomeruli with hyperplasia of capillary loops 
mainly in G 3. Proliferative activity of nephrons structural elements 
increased in G 2 (Ki-67 proliferative index (PI) – (21.3±2.1)%), 
G 3 (Ki-67 PI – (38.9±2.7)%) compared with G 1 (Ki-67 PI 
– (12.5±1.9)%), however, was more pronounced in G 3. In G 2 and 
especially G 3, there was compensatory angiogenesis activation, 
as evidenced by an increase in the number of vessels in stroma in 
these groups (G 2 – 8.3±1.2, G 3 – 11.4±2.1) compared to G 1 
(5.6±0.9).

Renal amyloid deposition limited to glomeruli in caveolin-1 
knockout mice
G. Terinte-Balcan*, D. Marta, M. Gherghiceanu
*"Victor Babes" National Institute of Pathology, Romania
Background & objectives: Caveolae are invaginations of the 
plasma membrane involved in many different disease processes, 
such as cardiovascular diseases, infections, diabetes, drug sensitiv-
ity and cancer. The objective of this study was to assess the renal 
pathological abnormalities in cav-1 knockout ageing mice.
Methods: Renal tissue from 6 and 18 month-old cav-1 knockout 
mice was processed for paraffin and plastic embedding in order to 
be examined using light microscopy (LM) and electron microscopy 
(EM). Slides with paraffin embedded tissue were processed for 
immunofluorescence microscopy (IF) and examined using the fol-
lowing markers: IgA, IgM, IgG, C3, C1q, fibrin, kappa and lambda 
light chains.
Results: LM showed normal structure of kidney from 6 month-
old mice and large amorphous deposits located only in the 
glomeruli from 18 month-old mice. There was no endocapillary 
hypercellularity, fibrinoid necrosis or crescents in the glomeruli. 
The tubulo-interstitial and vascular compartments of the kidney 
had a normal structure. IF was negative in the glomeruli and there 
were no extraglomerular deposits on any marker examined. EM 
showed non-branching, randomly arranged fibrils, with a diameter 
between and 7 and 12 nm located only in the glomeruli.
Based on the findings observed by LM, IF and EM, a diagnosis of 
amyloidosis limited to the glomeruli in the kidneys of aged mice 
was made.
Conclusion: There are several experiments in animal models and 
HEK cells that demonstrate a connection between cav-1 levels and 
amyloid precursor proteins. In humans, variations in the CAV1 
gene have been reported in association with metabolic disorders 
and cardiovascular disease.
This study represents the first report of amyloid deposition in 
the kidneys of cav-1 knockout aged mice, further strengthening 
the evidence that cav-1 and caveolae are implicated in disease 
pathophysiology.

*Institute of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, 
Croatia
Background & objectives: Alport syndrome (AS) and thin base-
ment membrane nephropathy (TBMN) are kidney disorders caused 
by mutations in COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 genes that encode 
polypeptide chains of collagen IV, the major structural component 
of basement membranes.
Methods: We identified 13 patients from 12 unrelated families 
with a pathohistological diagnosis of AS or TBMN who tested 
positive for a heterozygous variant COL4A3 c.2881+1G>A on 
conducted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Subsequently, their 
family members were recruited for genetic counselling, urinalysis, 
and blood sampling for targeted NGS. A correlation of clinical and 
pathohistological data and genealogy study was also performed.
Results: Overall, 34 patients (58.8% male) were found positive 
for heterozygous, disease-causing variant COL4A3 c.2881+1G>A. 
Haematuria was present in 33 patients (97.1%), while 19 (55.9%) 
had proteinuria. Follow-up data showed that four more patients 
developed proteinuria (23 total; 67.6%) and 6 (17.6%) developed 
chronic kidney disease, started dialysis or underwent kidney trans-
plantation by the median age of 51 years. There were 6 (17.6%) 
patients with hearing loss (3 confirmed with audiogram) and 4 
(11.8%) with ocular lesions. Among 13 patients who underwent 
kidney biopsy, 12 had glomeruli available for electron microscopy. 
Five patients had classic AS morphology and 7 had TBMN (3 of 
them with focal lamellation).
Conclusion: The suspected founder variant COL4A3 
c.2881+1G>A is disease-causing. There is variability among these 
patients not only in clinical presentation but also in pathohistologi-
cal findings. Interestingly five out 12 heterozygous patients had 
classic AS morphology on kidney biopsy. It is essential to conduct 
a detailed analysis of each collagen IV variant to optimize the 
affected patients’ prognostic and therapeutic approach.

Ursolic acid prevents the dysregulation in the expression of his-
tone methylation-related epigenetic enzymes in diabetic kidney
S. Manea*, A. Lazar, M.L. Vlad, A. Manea
*Institute of Cellular Biology and Pathology “Nicolae Simionescu” 
of the Romanian Academy, Romania
Background & objectives: Histone methyltransferases (KMTs)/
demethylases (KDMs) play a major role in the pathology of diabetic 
kidney disease (DKD). We aimed at investigating the potential role 
of ursolic acid (UA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid, to modulate the 
expression of archetypal KMTs/KDMs in diabetic kidney.
Methods: Non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic 
C57BL/6J mice were randomized to receive via intraperitoneal 
injection 1 mg/kg UA, or its vehicle for 4 weeks. Human 
endothelial cells (EA.hy926) were exposed to normal (5 mM) or 
high (25 mM) concentrations of glucose in the absence/presence of 
UA (5 μM). Hematoxylin-eosin staining, fluorescence microscopy, 
real-time PCR and Western blot were employed.
Results: No significant changes in blood glucose levels and body 
weights were detected following UA administration to diabetic mice 
as compared with vehicle-treated diabetic animals. Glomerular 
hypertrophy and enhanced accumulation of extracellular matrix 
proteins were detected in diabetic kidney. The mRNA and protein 
levels of KMT (DOT1L, SETD7, EHMT1, EHMT2, EZH1, EZH2) 
and KDM (KDM1A, KDM2A, KDM3A, KDM4A, KDM5A, 
KDM5B) subtypes were found significantly elevated in the kidney 
of diabetic mice as compared with non-diabetic animals. Treatment 
of diabetic mice with UA suppressed the up-regulation of KMTs 
and KDMs. High glucose-induced increased expression of the 
archetypal KMT and KDM subtypes was significantly reduced by 
UA in cultured endothelial cells.
Conclusion: Selective triterpenic acids are generally acknowl-
edged as potential medicines for the treatment of a wide range of 
human pathologies. In this study, we provide evidence that ursolic 
acid prevents the alterations in gene and protein expression levels 
of archetypal KMTs and KDMs in the kidney of diabetic mice. 
Ursolic acid or its pharmacologically active chemical derivates 
may become important therapeutic tools to prevent epigenetic

A multihierarchical terminology for non-neoplastic kidney 
biopsies: kidney biopsy codes for pathologists
A. Dendooven*, H. Weishaupt, K. Amann, H. Hopfer, R. Cornet, 
L. Gesualdo, S. Leh
*UZ Gent, Belgium
Background & objectives: A kidney biopsy is often the only 
option to correctly diagnose a kidney disease and to gain informa-
tion about prognosis and possible treatment. However, an interna-
tional standardized system for coding morphological findings and 
diagnoses has been missing.
Methods: An expert workshop defined the principles for the Kid-
ney Biopsy Codes for Pathologists (KBC) system. Based on experi-
ence, literature review, and 60 nephropathology reports, a terminol-
ogy with synonyms and parent-child relationships was established. 
Then, a project-internal review process and a second workshop 
were carried out. Several visualisations of the system have been 
developed using R/Shiny.
Results: The aim of the Kidney Biopsy Codes for Pathologists 
project (KBC, https://kibico.org/) is to establish a comprehensive 
coding system for non-neoplastic kidney biopsies. KBC currently 
consists of 576 active concepts, of which 168 belong to a compact 
and 408 to a detailed set of terms. The KBC structure is multi-
hierarchical with a pattern of injury (276 concepts) and a disease 
concept axis (266 concepts) as well as attributes (43 concepts) 
including qualifiers for certainty (3 concepts). Concepts are further 
grouped according to kidney compartments. For each concept, a 
preferred term and synonyms have been defined.
Conclusion: A comprehensive coding system for non-neoplastic 
kidney diseases is established. In order to provide governance and 
to promote use within existing frameworks, the KBC team aims 
to collaborate with SNOMED international to make a subset in 
SNOMED CT. Finally, an international review process will be 
conducted.

*Department of Pathology, Medical Faculty, Ege University, Izmir, 
Turkey
Background & objectives: Serum amyloid A protein-related AA 
amyloidosis can lead to ESRD,therefore renal transplantation.
Surveillance of allografts with C4d immunohistochemical stain-
ing assesses humoral rejection.Immune complex-mediated diseases 
and amyloidosis describe positive staining.We analysed the C4d 
immunohistochemical staining pattern in allograft biopsies with 
recurrent amyloidosis.
Methods: This retrospective analysis included allograft biopsies 
performed in our centre that were previously positive for amy-
loid with congo red and C4d evaluation. Amyloidosis scoring 
and description of C4d immunohistochemical pattern staining 
(glomerular, vascular, interstitial and/or capillary peritubular) were 
evaluated, and C4d staining was correlated with congo red staining.
Results: 41 biopsies belonging to 22 patients were analysed. 
Among the indication of biopsy were graft dysfunction (n=9; 
40,9%), non-nephrotic proteinuria (n=5; 22,7%) and nephrotic pro-
teinuria (n=8; 36,3%). During the investigation 12 graft cases had 
preserved function, 6 cases had graft dysfunction and 4 patients 
died. Amyloid deposits were frequently founded in arteriolar vessel 
walls (N=12; 54,5%) and combined glomerular/vascular staining 
(n=6;45,4%). There was one biopsy with C4d insufficient staining, 
in 5 cases the amyloid deposits were small and the evaluation of 
C4d and congo red at the same time was necessary. In the other 
cases, C4d staining highlighted amyloid deposits within blood ves-
sels and glomeruli.
Conclusion: Amyloid deposits in recurrent AA amyloidosis in 
kidney allografts show a distribution over blood vessel walls. This 
nonspecific finding at the walls of the arterioles is seen as well in 
arteriolar hyalinization, in contrast, glomeruli staining with arte-
riolar staining seems to be more specific for amyloidosis. C4d can 
be used as a marker for amyloid using mass spectrophotometry 
identifying C4d protein as part of the AA amyloid component.

Conjunctival Melanoma in Ireland – a sixty year review
L. Coady*, C. Hegarty, K. Kulakova, S. Kennedy
*St. Vincent’s University Hospital, Ireland
Background & objectives: Conjunctival melanoma is a rare ocu-
lar neoplasm with an unpredictable pathological course. Reported 
incidences vary from 0.1–0.9/1,000,000. Lack of population studies 
coupled with the rarity of the tumour has resulted in poor under-
standing of risk-factors and limited therapeutic options.
Methods: A retrospective review of all cases of conjunctival mela-
noma accessioned in the largest eye unit in Ireland over a 60 year 
period (1961 – 2021) was performed. The age, sex, eye laterality, 
size of tumour, development of metastasis and/or recurrence was 
determined. Genome sequencing was performed on a select number 
of samples from the cohort and any mutations found recorded.
Results: 72 cases of conjunctival melanoma were diagnosed since 
1961. There was a female preponderance (n = 42, 58.3%). Median 
age of diagnosis was 77 (Range:32-91). Tumour size varied from 
5–56mm in maximum dimension. Thirty-five (48.6%) have died. 
Time of death ranged from 1 month to 12 years post diagnosis.
28 (40%) developed metastases (brain, lung, liver, kidney, bowel, 
thyroid, prostate, parotid, lymph nodes), 20 (28.6%) developed 
recurrences. The left eye was more commonly affected (n=36, 
50%).
14 of 70 specimens dating back to 1996 were sent for analysis with 
either Sequenom or Oncomine platforms. Mutations were detected 
in 12 patients. These included PIK3R1, M326I, PIK3CA, MET, 
N3755, BRAF and NRAS.
Conclusion: Conjunctival melanoma is a rare neoplasm with only 
72 cases diagnosed in Ireland in the last 60 years. Recurrence and 
metastases are common.
Options for treatment of conjunctival melanoma include excision, 
cryotherapy, corneal epitheliectomy, radiotherapy and topical mito-
mycin C. Adjuvant therapy is limited, with conjunctival melanomas 
showing intermediate sensitivity to immunotherapy.
Extended follow up of patients will allow identification of risk fac-
tors for the disease, while further genetic sequencing will enable 
identification of potential therapeutic targets.

Uveal melanoma: ten years of experience and behaviour in the 
Principality of Asturias. A retrospective analysis

res-Rivas, N. González-Ortega, L.M. Fernández Fernández, C. 
Fuente-Díaz, M. García-Martínez, V. Blanco-Lorenzo, B. Vivanco-
Allende, C. González del Rey-Rodríguez, A. Encinas-Muñiz
*Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Spain
Background & objectives: Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most 
common primary intraocular neoplasm in adults, arising from mel-
anocytes located in the iris (4%), ciliary body (6%), or choroid 
(90%). It represents 2 cases per million per year in Spain and Italy 
(Southern Europe).
Methods: We performed a descriptive and retrospective analysis 
for ten years (2011-2021) on patients diagnosed of UM from dif-
ferent public medical institutions from the Health Service of the 
Principality of Asturias (SESPA). The information was obtained 
through the Hospital Registry of Tumours in Asturias.
Results: Twenty-five patients were included in this study with a median 
age of 62-year-old. Predominant histologic subtype was epithelioid mela-
noma (28%), followed by spindle cells (24%) and mixed (24%), subtype 
was not available in 6 patients (24%). Most of them presented as local 
stage (64%) and underwent radical surgery (88%). Most cases affected 
the choroid (80%) and a smaller group the ciliary body (20%). We found 
no cases with iris involvement. A small percentage (8%) required radio-
therapy and immunotherapy respectively. Four patients died with a mean 
of 4,43 years after diagnostic, three of them with metastatic disease. The 
other patients are being followed-up at the referral hospital.
Conclusion: In recent years, numerous advances have been made in 
genetics and behaviour of UM. However, despite these efforts, sur-
vival has not been improved and once metastatic disease progresses, 
the prognosis is poor and therapeutic options are very limited. The 
heterogeneity of the molecular pathways involved in this pathol-
ogy has hindered the development of a specific drug for advanced 
disease. Therefore, more studies are needed to achieve this.

Retinoblastoma in Ireland; the next generation sequencing 
molecular profiles of selected enucleation cases with a special 
focus on non-RB1 mutations and a comprehensive review of 
the retinoblastoma caseload in Ireland over the past 20 years
J. Maguire*, A. Greene, M. Capra, L. Bradley, A. Green, C. 
Hartnett, S. Kennedy
*St Vincent’s University Hospital, Ireland
Background & objectives: Increasingly, retinoblastoma has been 
linked to somatic gene abnormalities beyond RB1, especially 
BCOR, a BCL-6 co-repressor gene. Our aim is to assess the molec-
ular profile of selected retinoblastoma specimens and to review 20 
years of retinoblastoma in the Irish population.
Methods: Using the hospital database of the national ophthalmic 
centre, all enucleation specimens for suspected retinoblastoma 
performed in Ireland over the past 20 years (2001 – 2020) were 
analysed under various headings, including age at surgery, sex, lat-
erality, diagnosis, and histopathological features including tumour 
differentiation, extent and stage. 6 selected cases were sent for 
somatic molecular analysis using next generation sequencing.
Results: 65 enucleations were performed on 63 children. 61 speci-
mens showed retinoblastoma. On average 3.2 surgeries were per-
formed per year. 41% were female, 59% male. The average age at 
surgery was 2.72 years. 8% of the patients had undergone neo-
adjuvant therapy prior to the enucleation procedure. 75% of the 
tumours were moderately to poorly differentiated, 61% had optic 
nerve invasion and 5% had a positive optic nerve margin. 5 of the 
cases referred for molecular profiling had a somatic RB1 variant. 
The remaining case, a 3 year old patient with a left sided, high 
grade, poorly differentiated retinoblastoma was found to have a 
mutation in BCOR, with no associated RB1 mutation.
Conclusion: Our review shows that the rate of performance of enu-
cleations for retinoblastoma in the Irish population over the past 20 
years has remained stable. We identified a non-RB1 BCOR mutated 
retinoblastoma, associated with a high pathological grade. This 
supports the literature in highlighting BCOR as the most common 
non-RB1 gene to be mutated in retinoblastoma, and the importance 
of molecular profiling to identify non-RB1 somatic mutations and 
potentially higher grade, more aggressive tumour types to improve 
patient treatment.

Histopathologic findings of lens capsule and persistent hyper-
plastic primary vitreous of Korean juvenile cataract patients
Y.M. Kim*, C. Cho, J.Y. Kim, W.K. Kim, H.W. Kim, Y. Chun, 
W.S. Kim
*Haeundae Paik Hospital, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Persistent hyperplastic primary vitre-
ous (PHPV) is a rare congenital anomaly in which the regression 
of the hyaloid vessel fails and primary vitreous persists after birth. 
The purpose of study was to determine the histologic features of 
congenital cataract and PHPV.
Methods: Histopathologic examination of a total of 142 lens cap-
sules from a retrospective cohort study of 106 consecutive unilat-
eral and bilateral Korean juvenile cataract patients was conducted. 
Retrolenticular membranes of the 12 PHPV patients were reviewed 
for histology and immunohistochemistry with antibodies of CD31, 
CD34, Von Willebrand factor, Cytokeratin, Vimentin and TGF-β1 
were performed.
Results: 1) The frequency of PHPV in unilateral and bilateral 
Korean juvenile cataract patients was 11.3% (12/106). 2) 
Characteristic histologic features of PHPV, hypercellular membrane 
tissue consisting of either vascular structures and/or mesenchymal 
cells, were found in 75% (9/12) of cases at an age younger than 
123 months. However, the hyaloid arteries and endothelium-lined 
blood vessels in the retrolenticular membranes were found only in 
3 cases. 3) Six cases, including one case of bilateral PHPV, showed 
only mesenchymal cells. Three cases of clinically diagnosed PHPV 
did not show fibrovascular membranes by histology. 4) Endothelial 
cells of the vessels but not mesenchymal cells expressed TGF-β1 
by immunohistochemistry.
Conclusion: 1) Not all cases of PHPV have vascular structures in 
the retrolenticular membrane tissues. 2) Mesenchymal cells with or 
without vascular structures are found in most of cases (80%), which 
suggests that the vascular mesenchymal transformation could be 
one of the possible mechanisms in the process of vascular regres-
sion of PHPV. 3) Mesenchymal transition of remnant foetal vas-
cular structures in PHPV is independent of the patient’s age at the 
time of operation, or the size of retrolenticular membranes.

Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Paediatric soft tissue tumours are 
rare heterogeneous group. Although most tumours are benign, 
developing an appropriate diagnosis requires knowledge of 
clinical and radiologic characteristics. The objective of our study 
is highlight the clinico-pathologic characteristic of paediatric soft 
tissue malignant tumours.
Methods: A total of 25 cases of soft tissue malignant tumours diag-
nosed in children under 16 years at the Department of Pathology 
of Farhat Hached University Hospital in Sousse, over a period of 
16 years (from 2005 to 2020). A review of clinical, paraclinical, 
pathological and evolutionary data was performed in all cases.
Results: These were 9 female and 16 male, with an average age of 9 
years. The average diagnosis time was 7 months. The main clinical 
presentation was abdominal mass. The main tumour size was 7,15 
cm. 7 tumours were in upper limbs and 18 were in lower limbs. 
MRI was an essential exam for the diagnosis. There were 8 Ewing 
sarcoma/PNET (32%), 5 rhabdomyosarcoma (20%), 3 fibrosarcoma 
(12%), 2 dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (8%), one inflammatory 
fibroblastic sarcoma (4%), one low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma 
(4%), one kaposi sarcoma (4%) and one myxoid liposarcoma 
(4%). Treatment is a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and 
radiation. 5 patients were dead and 20 are still alive.
Conclusion: Evaluation of paediatric soft-tissue tumours can be 
challenging. To formulate a differential diagnosis and, ultimately, 
diagnose a presenting lesion, the clinician should have an organised 
and systematic approach to the evaluation. Biopsy is a relevant 
and indolent exam for the diagnosis. Sarcomas represent the 
most common paediatric soft tissue cancers. To optimize their 
management and survival, patients should be treated at specialised 
centres to provide appropriate therapy and follow-up.

The role of preeclamptic stem villi obliterative angiopathy in 
the prognosis of newborn status
O. Voronova*, L. Mikhaleva
*PHI Clinical Hospital RZhD-Medicine, Rostov-on-Don, Russia
Background & objectives: The prevention of ischemic changes 
in the placenta, where obliterative angiopathy of the villus vessels 
plays a leading role, requires the development of an objective 
prognosis tool. 70 placentas from women with preeclampsia of 
varying severity, 20 from healthy women.
Methods: Morphometry was carried out using the Leica Applica-
tion Suite module, Leica DM4000B. Micromorphometric indicators 
were determined: the area of the stem villi, the area of the lumen 
of the arterioles; diameters and areas of arterioles, including their 
wall thickness; measurements were made in 20 stem villi, the arte-
riole obliteration degree was calculated according to the coefficient 
Ксо = Sат\Sа.
Results: Foetal distress manifestation in preeclampsia 
depends on the severity of obliterative angiopathy. The nor-
mal significance of the obliteration coefficient for arteri-
oles1-2 the order of stem villi was 1.18-1.34, for the 3rd 
-1.19-1.37. With an increase in the obliteration coefficient 
of arterioles of the 1st and 2nd order of villi more than 1.34, 
and of the 3rd order more than 1.37, the frequency of chronic 
intrauterine hypoxia increased to 61.0%and 59.4%, respec-
tively. The increase of this indicator in the combination of 
preeclampsia with extragenital pathology over 1.89 for villi 
of 1-2orders and 1.92 of 3rd was accompanied by the addition 
of an increase in intrauterine growth restriction to 31.3% and 
29.6%, respective.
Conclusion: The coefficient of arteriole obliteration is directly 
proportional to the incidence of chronic intrauterine hypoxia. 
When the placental villi arteriole obliteration coefficient exceeds 
critical value, the frequency of chronic intrauterine hypoxia 
and intrauterine growth restriction occurring in combination 
increases significantly. The significance of obliterative 
angiopathy in preeclamptic placentas in the functional state of 
the foetus and newborn was confirmed, and a prognostic model 
was created to calculate the probability of its occurrence.

Immunohistochemical characteristics of the vessels of the sup-
porting villi of the placenta during preeclampsia
O. Voronova*, L. Mikhaleva
*PHI Clinical Hospital RZhD-Medicine, Rostov-on-Don, Russia
Background & objectives: Morphological changes in the ves-
sels in preeclampsia are not sufficiently reflected in the literature, 
especially for the stem villi and their branches. There are no clear 
morphological criteria for assessing the severity of hypoxia of a 
newborn.
Methods: Studied 70 placentas from women with preeclampsia of 
varying severity, 20 placentas from healthy women. A macro- and 
microscopic examination of the placenta was carried out according 
to the generally accepted method. Immunohistochemical markers 
were used: CD34 (clone QBEnd\10), VEGF-A, eNOS. The level 
of expression of immunohistochemical markers was assessed in 
points: 0-no reaction, 1-weak reaction, 2-moderate reaction, 3-pro-
nounced reaction.
Results: Immunohistochemical markers detailed the cells 
producing these factors in the vessels and stroma of supporting 
villi. Using the CD34 marker, hyperplasia and desquamation of 
endotheliocytes were revealed with a pronounced formation of 
reticulate structures in arterioles (placental endotheliosis) and its 
"palisade" location in venules. A decrease in the expression of 
eNOS and VEGF-A was clearly accompanied by the presence of 
rheological disorders in the vascular bed, there was a progression 
of collagenization of the supporting villi stroma with the formation 
of perivascular sleeves and obliteration of the lumen of their 
vessels with signs of reduction of the paravascular bed.
Conclusion: Morphological changes in the supporting villi are 
most pronounced in pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia. 
The lack of conditions for the implementation of compensatory 
reactions at the tissue level in the presence of preeclampsia 
exacerbates the severity of placental insufficiency, the development 
of obliterative angiopathy of the vessels of the stem villi, a 
decrease in blood flow in the capillaries of the terminal villi, 
which significantly worsens the prognosis for foetal development, 
increases the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes.

ogy, Belgrade, Serbia
Background & objectives: Perinatal mortality remains globally 
unacceptably high with up to three million stillbirth every year. 
Intrauterine foetal death and stillbirth are crucial part of perinatal 
mortality. Autopsy, correlated with clinical data, remains the “gold 
standard” for identifying causes of foetal death.
Methods: A cross-sectional study, during the 2018 year, was per-
formed by reviewing autopsy reports from the Institute of Pathol-
ogy, Faculty of Medicine University of Belgrade. It was 1171

autopsies generally, among them 146 foetal. Based on autopsy 
findings, we identify the most common causes in perinatal death. 
Data were analysed using methods of descriptive statistics.
Results: The clinical diagnoses were: anomalies 45, intrau-
terine death 42, chromosomal aberrations 18, placental and 
umbilical lesions 10, spontaneous abortion 2, tumour 3 and 
multiple causes 26. Autopsy confirmed anomalies are the 
most frequent primary disease and cause of death (56%), 
where CNS anomalies were leading lesions (41%). Based on 
patohistology general asphyxia is the following cause of foe-
tal death in 47%. Asphyxia was associated mostly with pla-
cental lesions (37%) as a result of vascular placental changes, 
followed by inflammation in women older than 35 years. We 
found the highest association of chromosomal aberrations in 
the same mother’s ages. Foetal anomalies were mostly found 
in women younger than 25 years.
Conclusion: Anomalies and asphyxia are the most frequent cause 
of foetal death between 26-35 gestation weeks. Foetal asphyxia as 
a result of placental ischemic lesions, umbilical cord pathology is 
mostly seen in mothers older than 35 years. In the same age group 
were mothers of foetuses with chromosomal aberrations. Foetal 
anomalies are mostly found in mothers younger than 25 years.

The association of mir-204 and mir-483 5p expression with 
clinicopathological features of Wilms tumour: could provide 
foresight?

R.E. Cecen, H.N. Olgun, D. Kabakci, E. Ozer
*Izmir Katip Celebi University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Wilms tumour(WT) is the most com-
mon neoplasm of the kidneys in childhood. With the improvement 
of up-to-date treatment protocols, an increase in survival rates in 
WT was observed. However, metastases or local relapses are still 
observed in 15% of patients.
Methods: The evaluation of genetic and epigenetic features such 
as miRNA analyses might allow us to comment on the behaviour of 
the tumour and the treatment response. For this purpose, expression 
levels of mir-204 and mir-483-5p were evaluated in tumoral and 
normal tissue by qRT-PCR. The relationship of miRNA expression 
levels with clinicopathological, histological features, and survival 
was also investigated.
Results: This study recruited 24 WT cases who had paraffin blocks 
available for the study. Anaplasia (focal and diffuse) was identified 
in six patients(12%) based on the distribution of anaplastic changes. 
The result of the study indicated that the relative expression levels 
of mir-204 in WT tissues were significantly lower than that in 
adjacent normal tissues(mean value0.11). In contrast, tumour 
tissue had higher miR-483-5p expression than corresponding 
normal tissues. A statistically significant association between miR-
204 expression level with age and the presence of anaplasia was 
observed in this study. Significantly high levels of miR-483-5p 
expression were found in cases who underwent preoperative CT 
compared to those who did not receive CT.
Conclusion: According to the literature data, decreased expression 
of miR-204 is associated with a poor prognosis. Our findings also 
suggest that poor prognostic data are accompanied by a downregu-
lation of miR-204. In our study mir-483-5p expression level was 
found to be higher in patients who underwent preoperative CT 
compared to patients who did not receive CT. Of particular interest 
is the finding that the mir-483-5p can be a promising biomarker in 
the early detection of CT response in WT.

Background & objectives: The placenta represents an important 
witness of pregnancy and its related complications in SARS-CoV-
2-infected mothers. We aim to evaluate specific histopathological 
placental changes associated with maternal SARS-Cov-2 infection 
and their correlation with pregnancy dynamics.
Methods: The study includes 36 pregnant women, with pregnancy 
age ranging from 11 to 42 weeks, admitted between September 
2020 and February 2022 with positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR for 
SARS-CoV-2. All placenta specimens were macroscopically and 
histologically examined, the slides being conventionally stained 
with Hematoxylin and Eosin and immunohistochemically stained 
for CD8, CD68, and CD20.
Results: Of the 36 women, 34 (94.44%) had singleton pregnancies, 
one (2.77%) had twin pregnancy, and one (2.77%) had quadruplets. 
28 (77.77%) pregnancies were term deliveries, with one (2.77%) 
placenta accreta and one (2.77%) marginal placenta praevia, two 
(5.55%) were miscarriages, and 4 (11.11%) were foetus exitus. The 
histopathological assessment revealed chorioamnionitis in 9 (25%) 
cases, foetal vascular malperfusion in 15 (41.66%) cases, villitis 
and chronic intervillositis in 8 (22.22%) and 4 (11.11%) cases, 
chronic deciduitis in 4 (11.11%) cases, hematomas in 7 (19.44%) 
cases, infarction in 11 (30.55%) cases. All placentas showed an 
association of these abnormalities, the local inflammatory response 
being underlined by positive immunoexpression of studied markers.
Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women 
is associated with an increased frequency of placental 
histopathological abnormalities, especially foetal vascular 
malperfusion, various inflammatory lesions, infarction, and 
hematomas. In complicated pregnancies of patients with SARS-
CoV-2 infection, histopathological evaluation of the placenta, 
supported by a specific panel of antibodies, may help elucidate the 
pathological mechanisms that occur at the foetal-maternal interface 
associated with COVID-19 infection, providing additional data in 
the obstetrical management of this pathology.

Podoplanin expression in neoplastic cells and cancer-associated 
fibroblasts in colorectal cancer predicts unfavourable clinico-
pathological features
R. Souza da Silva*, E. Queiroga, C. Osório, K. Cunha, E. Dias
*Universidade Federal da Paraíba, Brazil
Background & objectives: The pattern of activity of the cellular 
elements that compose the tumour microenvironment influences 
tumour behaviour. To analyse the activity of cancer cells (CCs) and 
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in colorectal cancer (CRC), 
based on the expression of podoplanin stratified by tumour-stroma 
ratio.
Methods: We performed immunohistochemistry for podoplanin on 
tissue microarrays from 357 cases of colorectal adenocarcinoma 
(CRA). The tumour-stroma ratio (TSR) was evaluated: stromal per-
centage ≤50%- stroma low; >50%-stroma-high. The expression of 
podoplanin was evaluated in different areas: TSR, most invasive,

association between the markers and clinicopathological param-
eters, including TSR, was evaluated.
Results: Immunostaining of podoplanin was detected in CCs and 
CAFs, with positivity of 36.8% and 70%, respectively. Higher 
positivity of podoplanin in CCs was observed predominantly at 
TSR area: 64.3% of cases. Status podoplanin CAFs+ was higher 
in the desmoplasic region (71.6%). Stroma-high tumours showed 
increased expression of podoplanin in CCs and CAFs in compari-
son with stroma-low tumours. The status of podoplanin in CCs 
was observed in association with women (p=0.042), angiolym-
phatic involvement (p=0.021; p=0.047) and distant metastasis 
(p=0.014).
Conclusion: In the CCR microenvironment, CAFs and CCs 
express podoplanin. Our research found an increase in podoplanin 
expression in high stromal tumours, known to be more aggressive 
than low stromal tumours, and an association with angioinvasion 
and distant metastasis. The expression of this marker, in CRA 
stratified by tumour-stroma ratio, contributes to aggressive 
behaviour. It may represent a patient stratification tool, in the 
prediction of possible outcomes.

D. Raduta*, S. Zurac, M. Busca, R. Ardeleanu, A. Vilaia, A. Din-
culescu, M. Filip, L. Cristina, C. Popp
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a 
non-specific inflammatory condition affecting the gastrointestinal 
tract. The pathogenesis of IBD is insufficiently understood, but a 
key role is attributed to immune dysregulation. Our objective was 
to approach the IgG4 contribution to mucosal injury.
Methods: We conducted a case-control study comprising 12 
patients with IBD with different stages of disease activity (remis-
sion, mild, moderate, severe), and we focused our research on 
immunohistochemical identification and quantification of IgG4+ 
plasma cells found in lamina propria. The infiltration of IgG4+ 
plasma cells in patients with IBD was compared with plasma cells 
level of 12 healthy control individuals.
Results: Patients with IBD had higher intestinal mucosal IgG4 
counts than normal colonic mucosa (over 10 times more plasma 
cells IgG4+ in IBD per 10 HPF). Cases of ulcerative colitis (UC) 
showed higher numbers of IgG4+ plasma cells in lamina propria, 
compared to patients with Crohn disease (CD) for the same stage 
of activity. Mucosal infiltration of IgG4+ plasmocytes in active 
disease was higher comparative to remission stage of disease, as 
it follows: 5 IgG4+ per 10 HPF when CD is remitted and up to 25 
IgG4+ in severely active CD, in contrast to 13 IgG4+ in remitted 
UC which goes up to 33-41 IgG4+ in moderately to severely active 
UC.
Conclusion: Our study led to the following conclusions:
The potential pathogenic involvement of B cell lineage in the 
pathogenesis of IBD deserves further research and in-depth stud-
ies, as it may contribute to personalized therapy.

M. Sabbah, E. Ben Brahim, A. Chadli Debbiche
*Department of Pathology, Charles Nicolle Hospital Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Deficient MMR proteins and PD-L1 
expression have been shown to be prognostic factors[H1] and 
predictive biomarkers for anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in gastric 
adenocarcinoma(GA). We aimed to assess the expression of MMR 
proteins and PD-L1 in GA with clinicopathological features and 
survival.
Methods: This was a retrospective and descriptive study including 
143 GA diagnosed at the Department of Pathology of Habib 
Thameur hospital (2001-2018). Evaluation of MMR proteins 
and PD-L1 status was carried out by immunohistochemistry. The 
combined positive score (CPS) was calculated for PD-L1 with a 
threshold of 1.
Results: The frequency of deficient MMR proteins (dMMR) 
GA was 30.1%. There was no significant association, in uni-
variate and multivariate analysis, between MMR proteins and 
clinicopathological parameters. dMMR GA were PD-L1+ in 
24%. The frequency of PD-L1+ GA was 21.7%. Medullary 
histological subtype according to World Health Organisation 
classification (p<0.001), intestinal subtype according to Lauren 
classification (p=0.014), lymphoid stroma reaction (p=0.004) 
were predictors of PD-L1+ status. Median survival was 16 and 
18 months for patients with dMMR and PD-L1+ GA, respec-
tively, with no significant association. PD-L1- status was asso-
ciated with a poor prognosis.
Conclusion: One third of patients with GA have dMMR status. 
PD-L1- status is a factor of poor prognosis. Prognostic value of 
dMMR status should be investigated in a larger series.

Pathomorphological and molecular genetic features of serrated 
colorectal lesions

Guschin
*A.P. Avtsyn Research Institute of Human Morphology, Russia
Background & objectives: Morphological diagnosis of serrated 
neoplasms today is based on the identification of a specific struc-
ture of formations in histological preparations. Therefore, the 
aim of our study was to identify molecular and biological fea-
tures of serrated colorectal lesions (CSL).
Methods: We studied 481 cases of CSL (GP - 238, SSL 
- 201, and TSA – 42), stained with H&E and PAS-AB. 
For molecular-biological analysis, 69 observations of CSL 
were selected: SSL- 26, GP - 26, TSA - 17. The immu-
nohistochemical panel included: CK20, Ki67, MUC2, 
MUC5AC, MUC6, MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6. 
KRAS/BRAF/NRAS gene mutations were determined by 
real-time PCR.
Results: CSL show immunophenotypic signs of both colorectal dif-
ferentiation (expressed expression of more than 50% of all cells of the 
markers MUC2 and CK20) and gastric differentiation (appearance of 
MUC5AC and MUC6 expression, focal positive PAS-AB staining). 
MUC6 expression is characteristic only for SSL. The malignisation 
pathway of SSL was associated with the presence of a BRAF gene 
mutation (53.8%) and high grade microsatellite instability (34.8%), 
while that of TSA was associated with a KRAS gene mutation (47.1%) 
and MSI-H (40%). The KRAS (15.4%), BRAF (38.5%) and MSI (60%) 
gene mutations detected in HP confirm their role in serrated carcino-
genesis. The NRAS gene mutation was not detected in serrated colo-
rectal lesions.
Conclusion: CSL show immunophenotypic signs of both colorec-
tal differentiation and gastric differentiation. The malignisation 
pathway of CSL was associated with the presence of a BRAF gene 
mutation and MSI-H. Genetic mutations found in hyperplastic pol-
yps, in combination with immunophenotype confirm their role in 
serrated carcinogenesis

Tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) relate to PD-L1 expres-
sion and provide prognostic value in stage II and III colon can-
cer patients

*Department of Health Science, Public University of Navarra 
(UPNA), France
Background & objectives: Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes 
(TILs) and PD-L1 expression have been suggested as markers of 
immune-response in colon cancer also providing prognostic value. 
The aim is to assess TILs in the invasive primary tumour front, its 
relationship with PD-L1 expression and clinical outcomes.
Methods: In a cohort of 140 patients with stage II/III colon cancer, 
TILS were assessed according to the TILs Working Group stand-
ardized methodology and underwent automatic immunohistochemi-
cal staining for PD-L1. Clinical outcomes assess were disease-free 
survival and overall survival. The percentage of TILs score was 
categorized into low (≤ 5%), intermediate (≤ 10%), high (≤ 20%), 
and highest (> 20%).
Results: Assessment of TILs in the intermediate category and 
above in the tumour sample was statistically significantly related 
to PD-L1 expression. The higher percentage of TILs found, the 
stronger association with PD-L1 expression (p<0.001). There was 
no significant difference between TILs assessment and Stage II 
or III nor any other baseline characteristic. Category high TILs 
showed statistical significance for disease free survival HR=0.40 
95%CI [0.23-0.95] independent of sex, age, TNM stage and 
localization.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that TILs and PD-L1 expression 
are closely related. In addition, the presence of TILs in the tumour 
microenvironment seem to provide a positive prognostic value in 
early stage colon carcinoma. Immunotherapies that aim to stimulate 
an immune response may benefit from TILs assessment as a 
predictor for PD-L1 expression, in addition to its prognostic value.

Molnar, A. Patrichi, S. Gurzu
*University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science and Technology G. 
E. Palade, Targu Mures, Romania
Background & objectives: V-set and immunoglobulin domain 
containing 1 (VSIG1) is an intercellular-adhesion molecule 
expressed in the membrane of the normal gastric mucosa. The 
aim of this study is to report the possible significance of VSIG1 
cytoplasmic translocation in gastric cancer.
Methods: Based on VSIG1 immunohistochemical (IHC) 
expression in tumour core and front in 94 cases, three patterns 
were established: homologous type I (membrane/membrane), 
homologous type II (null/null) and heterologous cases (membrane/
cytoplasm or cytoplasm/null). VSIG1 status was correlated with 
clinico-pathological features (TNM stage and Dukes-MAC-like 
stage, molecular phenotype) and survival rate.
Results: From the 94 cases, 21.27% showed homologous type I 
expression, with the same percentage for cases with heterologous 
patterns. The rest of 57.46% demonstrated homologous type II pat-
tern. Heterologous patterns were indicators of aggressive behav-
iour, such as advanced Dukes-MAC-like stage (p=0.02), lymph 
node metastases (p=0.03) and mesenchymal tumour phenotype, 
with loss of E-cadherin expression (p=0.004) and nuclear trans-
location of β-catenin (p=0.0007). Cytoplasmic expression was 
more frequently seen in poorly differentiated/undifferentiated 
carcinomas. In cases with heterologous pattern, overall survival 
was significantly poorer, compared to that of cases with homolo-
gous expression (p=0.0005).
Conclusion: In gastric carcinomas, VSIG1 cytoplasmic positivity 
might be an indicator of mesenchymal phenotype, and thereby, 
a marker for dismal prognosis, aggressive behaviour and shorter 
overall survival.

Serum and mucosal CD30 in paediatric inflammatory bowel 
diseases (IBD): useful biomarkers for diagnosis and disease 
activity monitoring?

*Clinical and Transplant Pathology Centre, Institute for Clinical 
and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic
Background & objectives: The underlying immune pathophysiol-
ogy of IBD is incompletely understood, rendering quick diagnosis 
followed by tailored therapy difficult. The TNF superfamily recep-
tor CD30 has been proposed as potential marker of ulcerative coli-
tis (UC), and has been associated with elevated Th2 cells.
Methods: In this study we evaluate a cohort of 94 paediatric 
patients with UC and Crohn’s disease (CD) for serum soluble CD30 
(sCD30) using ELISA, and expression of CD30 and subpopulations 
of Th1/Th2/Th17 lymphocytes in the gastrointestinal mucosa using 
flow cytometry (FCM). The dataset is supported by endoscopic 
and microscopic activity of disease and basic laboratory markers 
of inflammation.
Results: sCD30 was not associated with diagnosis of CD or UC. 
However, sCD30 levels correlated with levels of CRP, ESR, 
faecal calprotectin and albumin and also with clinical activity of 
the disease in both UC and CD patients. FCM was not helpful in 
evaluation of mucosal CD30, which was lowly expressed and not 
associated with diagnosis or disease activity. We show augmented 
Th2 and Th1/17 response in the terminal ileum and right-sided 
colon and decreased Th1/17 response in left-sided colon of UC 
patients. T lymphocyte subsets were also affected by anti-TNF 
treatment and patients’ age.
Conclusion: Neither sCD30 nor FCM evaluated mucosal CD30 
were helpful in the diagnosis of paediatric UC. sCD30 seems to 
be marker of systemic inflammation and clinical activity of the 
disease.

Background & objectives: Colorectal cancer(CRC) is the second 
most deadly cancer worldwide. CRC recurrence is at the origin 
of this high mortality.Resistance to chemotherapy remains one of 
the greatest challenges causing recurrence. Our study specifically 
addressed the expression of immune Tcells in CRC.

Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on a total 
of 23 patients with CRC and 18 adjacent normal tissues. Membra-
nous expression of CD4, CD8 and nuclear expression of FOXP3 
were analysed in T cells infiltrating the tissues in three different 
fields of the stained slides. Clinico-pathological characteristics 
were recorded.
Results: Patients mean age range was 63.9 years. CD4, CD8 
and FOXP3 markers were significantly expressed in CRC 
tissues compared to normal tissues (Mann Whitney U test: CD4 
p=0,0034 ; CD8 p<0,0001 ; FOXP3 p=0,0019). Interestingly, high 
percentage of CD8 positive expression was reported in CRC (near 
30%) compared to CD4 and FOXP3 (not exceeding 4%) suggesting 
a high cytotoxic T cell infiltration. CD8high expression was found 
mostly in CRC without perineural invasion versus those with 
perineural invasion (p=0.042).
Conclusion: Altogether, our results showed the high expression of 
T cells infiltrating the tumour in CCR. Perineural invasion should 
be taken into consideration to design crucial strategies for CRC 
treatment.

Background & objectives: Human leukocyte antigen(HLA)-E 
is a non-classical HLA class I molecule implicated in immune 
cells modulation. Many studies proposed HLA-E molecule 
as a predictive biomarker for cancers’ outcome. We aimed to 
characterize the HLA-E expression in colorectal cancer(CRC) 
according to clinicopathological characteristics.
Methods: HLA-E expression was studied in tumour tissues and 
adjacent normal tissues from 22 CRC patients by immunohisto-
chemistry. HLA-E expression was found at the surface of cells. 
Labelled tumour cells percentage determined semi-quantitatively 
was correlated to clinico-pathological parameters.
Results: Patients mean age range was 64 years. HLA-E expression 
was significantly expressed in CRC tissues compared to normal 
tissues (100% and 86.6% respectively; Mann-Whitney U test: p 
< 0.0001). Moreover, high expression of HLA-E was revealed 
in patients exceeding 63 years, in those with early tumour stages 
(stage I and II), in those without lymph nodes metastasis, and in 
those with well differentiated tumours without significance.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that HLA-E is implicated in CRC 
promotion and could be proposed as a candidate biomarker for 
CRC. Its prognosis value remains to be confirmed through a wider 
study population.

Background & objectives: EBV has emerged as a prognostic 
biomarker in gastric adenocarcinomas (GA). EBV associated GA 
(EBVaGA) accounts for 10% of GA and comprises amplification 
of PD-L1.We aimed to assess EBV status and PD-L1 expression in 
GA with clinicopathological features and survival.
Methods: We performed tissue microarray slides from 143 GA 
patients treated with radical gastrectomy. PD-L1 expression was 
evaluated through immunohistochemistry (Combined Positive 
Score ≥1) and EBV status through chromogenic in situ hybridiza-
tion. Differences in overall survival (OS) were assessed using the 
Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards 
regression model.
Results: EBVaGAs accounted for 33.6%. They were associated 
with male gender (70.8%; p=0.020). The tumours were in the 
antrum (54.2%) with tumour size > 6 cm (52.2%). According 
to WHO classification, they were classified as poorly cohesive 
adenocarcinomas (43.8%). According to Lauren classification, 
they were classified intestinal subtype (45.8%), diffuse (43.8%) 
and indeterminate (10.4%). Perineural invasion was observed in 
68.8% of cases and vascular emboli in 85.4%. EBVaGAs were 
associated to pT1/pT2 stage (p=0.031), low rate of lymph node 
metastasis (p=0.029) and PD-L1+ status (p=0.016). EBV+ status 
was predictor to PD-L1+ status (p=0.018). Median survival was 
17 months in patients with EBVaGA compared to 16 months in 
EBV negative GA.
Conclusion: The prevalence of EBVaGA is high in Tunisian popu-
lation (33.6%). It is more frequent in poorly cohesive than tubular 
adenocarcinomas. EBVaGAs were more common in the antrum 
which does not fit reports in the literature. EBV+ status was a 
predictive factor to PD-L1 expression which suggests that patients 
infected with EBV may respond to PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. This 
incites to further investigation of EBV carcinogenesis for therapeu-
tic targets to select high-risk patients.

*Tata Memorial Hospital, India
Background & objectives: CKIT mutations are oncogenic 
drivers for gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs). They also 
function as predictive markers for response to imatinib. We studied 
various histologic types of GISTs, risk stratification, types of Ckit 
mutations and correlated with survival.
Methods: Histology and immunohistochemistry of 98 patients 
diagnosed with GIST were reviewed retrospectively. Histologic 
risk stratification was derived using CAP protocol. Sequencing 
results for Ckit exons 9,11, 13 and 17 were documented. Histologic 
and molecular parameters were correlated with survival. Clinical 
data was derived from electronic medical records.
Results: Immunohistochemistry for Ckit and DOG1 was positive 
in 98% of tumours; 2% being positive for DOG1 only. The histo-
logical risk groups were not associated with statistically signifi-
cant differences in PFS (p=0.6) or OS (p=0.7). Ckit mutation rate 
was 73%, Exon 11 mutations were found in 75% of patients, exon 
9 in 19%, exon 13 in 4.1 % and exon 17 in 5.5 % respectively. 
All patients with exon 9 mutations had consistent duplication 
c.1504_1509dupGCC​TAT​. Decision of dose escalation of imatinib 
or change to second line TKI was made in all patients with ckit 
exon 9 mutation. No statistical difference could be demonstrated 
among different mutational types when correlated with survival.
Conclusion: Overall Ckit mutation rate was lower (73%) than 
reported in literature, thus concluding that incidence of ckit muta-
tions could be lower in Indian population. Ckit exon 9 mutations 
had consistent duplication while deletions and substitutions were 
found in in exon 11. Exon 9 mutations guided treatment decisions. 
However, no statistical difference could be demonstrated among 
histological risk stratification and different mutational types when

*Department of Clinical and Experimental Pathology, Institute of 
Medical Sciences, Jan Kochanowski University, Kielce, Poland
Background & objectives: An availability of modern 
molecular solutions provided us a new insight into cancer 
genetic variations. In the current study we intended to perform a 
molecular screening of rectal cancer in young patients and then 
numerical analysis of cancer stem cells.
Methods: The ruling in criteria were the patient’s age before 
50years old, no previous radio- and chemotherapy, and eligible 
DNA for the next generation sequencing. The DNA was isolated 
from FFPE tissue. We used a Hot-Spot Cancer Panel by Illumina 
harbouring 50 genes (700 amplicons). To assess stem cell popu-
lation we intend to use CD133, SOX-2, and Lgr5 antibodies.
Results: The average patient’s age was 43-year-old. The female/
male ratio was 1.4:1. The mean follow up time is 38 months. 
We observed a following mutation frequency: TP53 61%, 
KRAS 58%, APC 47%, PIK3CA 19%, SMAD4 11%, FBXW7 
11%, NRAS 9%, BRAF 7%, NRAS 5%, CTNNB1 4%, MLH-1 
1%. We noted the co-occurrence KRAS/BRAF/NRAS mutation 
(p<0.05). Two cases did not present any mutation in the used 
panel. The immunohistochemistry and a statistical analysis is 
still in progress.
Conclusion: Our preliminary results indicate a rising number 
APC independent rectal cancer in a group of young patients. 40% 
of them presented multigene abnormality, where three to four 
mutations occurred the most common. Interesting is the fact of 
the evident contribution of the PIK3CA pathway and also 11% 
of SMAD4 which worsens the prognosis.

*Department of Microscopic Morphology-Pathology, 
ANAPATMOL Research Center, ’’Victor Babes’’ University of 
Medicine and Pharmacy of Timisoara, Romania
Background & objectives: Neuroendocrine tumours (NET) of the 
digestive tract are heterogeneous tumours, which despite similar 
morphology and grading have often distinct behaviour. We propose 
the use of PTEN immunohistochemical (IHC) expression for neu-
roendocrine tumours of the digestive tract as a prognostic factor.
Methods: 25 samples from patients diagnosed with neuroendocrine 
tumours from 2012 until 2018 were selected. All tumours were 
reclassified and graded based on 2019 WHO classification. Rep-
resentative tissue sections were stained for Synaptophysin (clone 
27G12; Leica), Chromogranin A (clone 5H7; Leica), Ki-67 (clone 
MM1; Leica), and PTEN (clone 6h2.1; Dako) using Leica BOND-
MAX fully automated staining system.
Results: Out of 25 cases, 18 were graded based on Ki-67 expres-
sion as NET G1 (72%), 5 as NET G2 (20%), and only 2 as NET 
G3 (8%) tumours. 8 cases presented PTEN negative expression of 
which 2 were NET G3 (100%), 3 were NET G2 (60%) and 3 were 
NET G1 tumours (16%) (p=0.018). 9 cases were localized in the 
small intestine, 9 in the large intestine, 3 in the stomach, and 4 in 
the appendix. All appendix tumours had positive PTEN expression. 
3 gastric tumours had negative PTEN (100%), 1 small intestine case 
was PTEN negative (12%) and 5 cases from the large intestine were 
PTEN negative (56%) (p=0.013).
Conclusion: Neuroendocrine tumours of the digestive tract have 
a distinct molecular profile that is still troublesome to understand 
regardless of grade, localization as well as other clinicopathological 
factors. We propose using PTEN expression as a significant negative 
prognostic factor for patients with NET of the digestive tract based 
on tumour grade and localization, but larger studies on more patients 
from each group are required in order to introduce PTEN expression 
in the treatment protocols.

E. Ben Brahim, R. Jouini, A. Chadli
*Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: In colorectal carcinoma, the immunoscore 
(IS) and tumour cells budding (TCB) score are two emerging param-
eters that have an independent prognostic value. Our study aimed to 
research for significant association between IS and TCB score.
Methods: A total of 104 tumour specimens from patients after cura-
tive resection were reviewed. For the determination of the IS, we 
adopted a method described by Galon et al. It was scored into 2 groups 
through a semi-quantitative method. TCB score was rated according to 
the ITBCC criteria. Tumour buds were scored manually into 3 groups.
Results: The mean age of the patients was 61.6 years. The IS was 
low in 60.6%, and high in 39.4%. The TCB score at the invasive 
front was low, intermediate, and high in 53.8%, 22.1%, and 24% 
of cases, respectively. We used the Chi-squared test to assess the 
association between IS and TCB score. A significant association 
between these two scores was found with p=0.042 (<0.05).
Conclusion: Accumulating evidence suggests that adaptive 
immune response, represented by cytotoxic T cells, plays a crucial 
role in suppressing tumour invasion and metastasis. A few data 
have suggested that anti-tumour immune response may restrict 
tumour buds at invasive margins. Our results are in line with these 
findings. This significant association may explain the tendency 
towards a new combined budding-immune cell score.

Background & objectives: Few publications have reported active 
lesions on gastric biopsies despite a normal endoscopic appearance 
in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Our 
objective was to describe the correlation between histology and 
endoscopy of ICI-induced gastritis.
Methods: All the patients treated with ICI (Ipilimumab, 
Nivolumab, and/or Pembrolizumab) for metastatic melanoma in

Results: 19/461 patients (4.1%) under treatment with ICIs 
were histologically confirmed with gastritis. 6/19 (31%) 
showed severe lesions of active gastritis on biopsies, while 
13/19 (69%) showed mild/moderate gastritis. Histologically, 
all severe cases corresponded to diffuse chronic active gastritis 
involving the full thickness of the mucosa with different 
degrees of inflammation between the antrum and fundus. 
Important neutrophilic infiltrate was present with crypt 
abscesses, intra-epithelial lymphocytosis CD8+ and massive 
gland destruction with interstitial CD4+ predominant T 
lymphocytes. Immunohistochemistry for CMV and Helicobacter 
Pylori was negative. Among the six cases with severe gastritis, 
four patients had a normal endoscopic appearance of gastric 
mucosa/ minor lesions and two patients showed gastric 
erosions/ulcerations.
Conclusion: Severe damage in ICI-induced gastritis can be associ-
ated with a normal endoscopic appearance. It is characterized by a 
chronic active gastritis pattern with abundant infiltration of mucosa 
and epithelium by lymphocytes and neutrophils and massive gland 
destruction. Despite a normal endoscopic appearance, biopsies of 
both fundus and antrum should be performed, as histology can be 
contrasting in different gastric regions.

Diagnostic usefulness of p53 immunostaining in gastric cancer 
and dysplasia: a real-world clinical experience
M. Kim*
*Kyungpook University Hospital, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Stomach cancer are major threat to 
public health. A subset of gastric cancer harbour mutations of 
TP53. Gastric cancer with mutant TP53 gene usually accompanies 
morphologic changes. We have investigated the diagnostic utility 
of p53 immunostaining in real-world cases.
Methods: We retrospectively searched 50 stomach tumour and 
tumour-like lesion cases, wherein p53 immunostaining had a 
pivotal role in the diagnosis. P53 staining pattern was also analysed 
in association with clinicopathologic parameters.
Results: Mutant pattern p53 staining was significantly correlated 
with high-grade nuclear atypia (p<0.001), high-grade dysplasia 
and tubular adenocarcinoma (p<0.001), and MSS status (p=0.034). 
Furthermore, diagnostic application of p53 immunostaining was 
useful when 1) biopsy specimen contained only few tumour cells, 
2) pathologic resection margin evaluation was difficult to due to 
the cauterization artifact 3) distinction of low-grade and high-grade 
gastric dysplasia.
Conclusion: p53 immunostaining can be helpful for the diagnosis 
of gastric tumour and tumour-like lesions, and accurate pathologic 
margin evaluation, particularly if the lesion shows intestinal-type 
differentiation and some degree of nuclear atypia.

Tumour area infiltration and absolute tumour cell counts in 
endoscopic biopsies of therapy-naive upper GI tract carcinomas 
- implications for predictive biomarker testing

* Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Cologne, Germany
Background & objectives: Guidelines regulate how many biopsies 
should be taken to obtain reliable results of predictive biomarker 
tests. Little is known about how well these guidelines are applied, 
the number of biopsies correlates with the tumour area and the 
tumour cells counts.
Methods: The study included endoscopic biopsies of untreated 
carcinomas of the upper gastrointestinal (GI)-tract during the 2015-
2020 review period. Archival (H&E)-stained histological sections 
were digitized, and the tumour areas were manually annotated. The 
tumour-bearing biopsy area and absolute carcinoma cell count per 
case were determined by image analysis.
Results: Biopsies from 253 patients were analysed. The follow-
ing mean values were determined: a) tumour biopsy number: 6.5 
(1–25, standard deviation (SD)=3,32, b) number of tumour-bearing 
biopsies: 4.7 (1–19, SD=2,80), c) tumour infiltrated area: 7.4mm2 
(0.19 mm2–59.46 mm2), d) absolute tumour cell count: 13,492 
(193–92,834) e) tumour cell count in a primary surgical specimen 
(tumour size: 6.7 cm): 105,200,176.
The guideline-recommended biopsy count of 10 was not achieved 
in 208 patients (82.2%), and the required tumour-bearing biopsy 
count of 5 was not achieved in 133 patients (52.6%).
Conclusion: Biopsies are often used to determine predictive 
biomarkers, like Her2/neu or PD-L1. Diagnostics standards to 
ensure representative material have been suggested in guidelines 
to reduce false-negative predictions. This is the first study 
describing the relationships between biopsy number, actual 
infiltrated tumour area, and carcinoma cell number. We advocate, 
that histopathological reports should indicate on which basis 
statements on therapy-relevant biomarkers were made. Digital 
pathology has the potential to objectively capture these parameters 
for documentation, quality assessment, and future clinical studies.

Immune microenvironment landscape shows treatment spe-
cific differences in rectal cancer patients

van Lent-van Vliet, C.A. Marijnen, I. Nagtegaal
*Radboud University Medical centre, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Neoadjuvant therapy is the backbone 
of modern rectal cancer treatment. Insight into the biology 
of tumour response is needed to optimize organ-preserving 
approaches. The aim of this study is to explore treatment-specific 
responses of the tumour and tumour microenvironment.
Methods: Locally advanced rectal cancer patients were treated 
with chemotherapy (CT), radiochemotherapy (RCT), radiotherapy 
short wait (RTS) or long wait (LRT) or did not receive therapy 
(NT). 16 patients per group were included. Tumour patterns of 
response assessed on HE slides. IF-multiplex was performed for 
Tcyt (CD3+CD8+), Treg (CD3+FOXP3+), Thelper (CD3+CD8-
FOXP3-), B cell (CD20+), DC (CD11c+) & Tumour (panCK+).
Results: A fragmented pattern was predominant in CT-and-RCT-
treated patients, whereas shrinkage pattern was predominant 
in LRT-treated patients (p=0.02). Thelper cells were the pre-
dominant immune cell population across therapies and a higher 
immune cell density was observed in stroma compared to tumour 
region. The depletion of Tregs after therapy suggests a long 
and maybe permanent effect on the tumour microenvironment. 
Acute RT affects Tcyt infiltrate (p<0.01). Brachytherapy-treated 
patients show the lowest densities of stromal Thelper, Tcyt & 
Tregs (p <0.01). Synergistic effect of RCT induces stromal 
increase of Tcyt cells and depletion of Thelper cells compared 
to CT. All patients treated with some form of radiotherapy had a 
more homogeneous immune response.
Conclusion: We demonstrated treatment-specific differences in 
the immune microenvironment landscape of RC patients. Local 
treatment including RT lead to a more homogeneous immune 
response compared to NT and CT. Understanding the immune

H3K27me3 immunohistochemical loss predicts response to 
neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) in patients with 
locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma
N. Caldonazzi*, P.C. Rizzo, S. Ammendola, G. Turri, C. Pedraz-
zani, A. Scarpa, V. Barresi
*Department of Diagnostic and Public Health, University of 
Verona, Italy
Background & objectives: Patients with locally advanced rec-
tal cancer are treated with neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy to 
improve resectability and decrease the probability of recurrence. 
This study aims to assess whether H3K27me3 immunostaining 
in pre-treatment biopsies of rectal adenocarcinoma may predict 
response to neo-adjuvant CRT.
Methods: We assessed H3K27me3 immunostaining in 43 pre-
treatment endoscopic biopsies of locally advanced rectal car-
cinomas treated with neo-adjuvant CRT and correlated it with 
Tumour Regression Grade (TRG) measured using Dworak system 
in the following surgical specimen.
H3K27me3 immunostain was classified: i) retained (≥ 5% stained 
neoplastic cells); ii) lost (> 95% stained neoplastic cells); iii) 
inconclusive (unstained normal and neoplastic cells).
Results: H3K27me3 immunostaining was lost in 18 cases, 
retained in 17 and inconclusive in 8. All tumours with retained 
H3K27me3 expression had complete tumour regression (TRG 
4/5). H3K27me3 loss was significantly associated with absent/
partial tumour regression (TRG 0/1/2) in surgical specimen 
(P=0.0015)
Conclusion: Due to the lower probability to respond to neo-adju-
vant CRT, a "watch and wait" approach to avoid side effect of 
surgery should be used with caution in patients with rectal carcino-
mas with H3K27me3 loss in the endoscopic pre-treatment biopsy.

Uccella
*Institute of Pathology, Dept. of Medicine and Surgery, University 
of Insubria, Varese, Italy
Background & objectives: Grade 3 Neuroendocrine Tumour of 
the digestive system (DS-NET G3) is a recently recognized entity 
exhibiting well differentiated morphology and high proliferation 
rate. Our study aimed to analyse the morphophenotypical, 
molecular and clinical features of 8 DS-NETs G3.
Methods: We collected 8 DS-NETs G3 in our institution between 
2015 and 2018. Clinical records and pathological samples were 
available for further analysis. The histopathological review was 
performed according to the upcoming WHO classification for Neu-
roendocrine Neoplasms. Immunohistochemistry for Chromogranin, 
Synaptophysin, INSM1, p53, Rb, p16, SSTR2A, DAXX/ATRX, 
Cyclin D1, Ki67 was performed. Next Generation Sequencing 
(NGS) was executed on 4 cases.
Results: Our cases included 3 pancreatic NETs (PanNETs) and 
5 gastrointestinal NETs (1 gastric, 1 ileal, 1 appendicular, 1 cae-
cal, 1 rectal). They were all characterized by a well differentiated 
morphology and a Ki67 index >20% (mean: 25%, range: 20-40%). 
General neuroendocrine markers were intensely and diffusely posi-
tive in all cells. SSTR2A showed membranous immunoreactivity 
in 6 of 8 cases. p53, Rb1 and p16 expression weren’t altered in any 
case, whereas Cyclin D1 was frequently overexpressed. Molecular 
analysis did not reveal any abnormality in key cancer genes, includ-
ing TP53 and RB1 genes. The mean follow-up of patients was 24 
months and no disease-related death was recorded.
Conclusion: Our case series recapitulates the clinicopathological 
and molecular characteristics of G3 NETs of the digestive system. 
This analysis highlights common features of these neoplasms, 
arisen in different sites, useful to distinguish them from 
neuroendocrine carcinomas occurring in the same locations.

PINK1 analysis in colorectal adenocarcinoma and their respec-
tive hepatic metastasis with clinical relevancy
J.C. Celis Pinto*, D. Corte-Torres, A. Vallina, A. Alonso Fernán-
dez-Velasco, I. Fernandez-Vega
*Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Spain
Background & objectives: PTEN-induced-kinase-1 (PINK1) is 
essential for maintaining mitochondria metabolism and survival 
in colon cancers. Higher PINK1 expressions were correlated with 
worsened survival. Our aim was to study the immunoexpression 
of PINK1 in samples from colorectal adenocarcinoma and their 
respective hepatic metastases.
Methods: Ninety consecutive patients with colon adenocarcinoma 
and subsequent hepatic metastasis surgically removed between 
2005 and 2022 were studied. Tissue arrays were produced using a 2 
mm diameter needle. Immunohistochemical studies were conducted 
and analysed by the H-Score method. Statistical analysis of these 
findings was carried out using the SPSSv25; p<0.05 program.
Results: Positive immunoexpression was detected in more than 
95 percent of both primary tumours and their hepatic metastases 
with significant median differences (82,27 ± 48,75 vs 91,29 ± 
49,59; p= 0,034). A positive correlation was identified for PINK1 
immunoexpression between primary and metastatic tumours (r= 
0,352; p=0.001). A cut-off of 100 points of PINK1 in primary 
samples and 110 in metastatic samples segregated patients into 
groups with a significant different prognosis. For instance, more 
than 110 points of PINK1 immunoexpression in patients with 
metastatic samples combined with more than 25 mitotic figures 
per 10 high-power-fields had a worse global survival (105,25 ± 
14,04 vs 54,95 ± 10,47 months; p=0.018).
Conclusion: Overexpression of PINK1 was observed in hepatic 
metastasis versus primary colon adenocarcinoma with a positive 
correlation. Defined cut-off with clinical relevance for PINK1 
immunoexpression in hepatic metastasis and primary colon 
adenocarcinomas was identified.

Methods: 116 postoperative GISTs were assessed in terms of 
histology and immunohistochemistry (CD117, DOG1, Ki67 and 
PHH3). The size of the tumours were based on macroscopic and 
radiological data. Statistical analysis included non-parametric 
Wilcoxon test was used to compare continuous variables and chi-
square test to compare proportions. Spearman correlation coef-
ficient was used to calculate correlation. All test were two sided.
Results: Cycline D1 was expressed in 72/116 cases (25 LG tumours 
according to ESMO criteria and 47 HG tumours ) – p>0,099. No 
correlation was found between cycline D1 expression and PHH3 
expression (rho=-0,07, p=0,444) mitotic index (rho=-0,12, 
p=0,216). |The correlation was found between cycline D1 expres-
sion and size of the tumour (mean size of the tumour in cycline 
D1 positive group = 7,2cm vs cycline D1 negative group = 9,4cm; 
rho=-0,20, p=0,03)
Conclusion: The immunohistochemical expression of cycline 
D1 does not correlate with mitotic index and PHH3 and Ki67 
immunohistochemical expressions in GISTs. It does not 
discriminate between LG and HG tumours. Hence it does not 
influence the risk stratification of GISTs as measured in tissue 
material.
The correlation between cyclineD1 expression and smaller size of 
the tumour is observed. It is to be established upon observational 
studies whether it may represents an independent risk factor as 
proved in others tumour.

Granulomatous appendicitis: a diagnostic challenge. Clinico-
pathological retrospective study of 60 cases
A. Pasco Peña*, A. Larrea, G. Aísa Rivera, M.I. Cevallos, M. Mer-
cado, Á. Panizo Santos
*Hospital Universitario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: Granulomatous appendicitis (GA) 
is an uncommon finding of appendectomies. The causes can be 
classified as infections or noninfectious. There is also a group 
where a cause is never identified (idiopathic). In this study, we 
report the clinicopathological features of GA.
Methods: We performed a single-centre, retrospective study 
of appendectomy specimens received by our department over 
a 26-year period of time (1995-2021). Clinical data were col-
lected retrospectively from the medical records and the his-
tological slides were reviewed. Additional stainings (Ziehl-
Neelsen, Gram, PAS and Groccot) and molecular studies were 
performed.
Results: We identified 60 GA cases: 32 men and 28 women. 
Ages ranged 1-83 years (median 33.5yrs). 44 cases had transmu-
ral acute-subacute inflammation. Granulomas were found scat-
tered throughout all layers of the wall: subserosa only (11.7%), 
submucosa+mucosa (65%) and transmural (23.3%). 12 GA were 
necrotizing granulomas. In 27 cases, granulomas were found in the 
lymphoid follicles with concomitant extrafollicular granulomas in 
15. The presence of xanthogranulomatous inflammation was seen 
in 10 cases. Two cases were Ziehl-Neelsen positive and one case 
was PCR-TBC positive. The likely clinicopathological cause of 
GA: idiopathic (55%; 3 cases probably due to Yersinia), Crohn’s 
disease (21.7%), interval appendicitis (8.3%), tuberculosis (6.7%), 
foreign material (6.7%), and Actinomyces (1.7%).
Conclusion: The incidence of GA was very low: only 60 cases in 
26 years. Idiopathic (primary) granulomatous appendicitis is the 
leading cause of in our series, followed by Crohn’s disease. The site 
of occurrence in the appendix, the morphology of the granulomas 
and the clinical setting is often paramount in establishing the 
aetiology. In our series, special stains for infectious organisms in 
GA are of low diagnostic yield.

Impact of IL-17-positive lymphocytes and -197A/G SNP in 
development of gastric cancer
E. Aleksandrova*, J. Ananiev, K. Ivanova, M. Hadzhi, M. Galabova
*Trakia University, Bulgaria
Background & objectives: An expanding body of evidence impli-
cates the dualistic role of IL-17, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, in 
both pro- and anti-tumourigenic processes. Elevated IL-17 expres-
sion has been observed in a variety of tumour tissues, including 
gastric cancer (GC).
Methods: We investigated immunohistochemically 45 GC patients 
with antibodies against IL-17. Genotyping for the -197A/G SNP 
in the IL-17A gene was performed via PCR-RFLP method. The 
clinicopathological parameters and survival were analysed 
retrospectively.
Results: We observed lower infiltration of IL-17-positive lympho-
cytes (-PL) in the tumour border in patients with low differentiated 
gastric cancer (Chi-square test, p=0.052). Also, we found a ten-
dency that patients without distant metastasis had lower infiltration 
in the tumour border with IL-17-PL (Chi-square test, p=0.106), but 
in the tumour we found that non-metastasis patients had signifi-
cantly lower infiltration with IL-17-PC (Chi-square test, p=0.024). 
Our results showed that the carriers of the G-allele for the -197A/G 
SNP were in advanced clinical stage of the disease (Chi-square test, 
p=0.072). The G-allele was also associated with the histology type 
of the tumour- the G-allele carriers had intestinal type tumours 
(Chi-square test,p=0.105).
Conclusion: Our results suggest that -197A/G SNP and IL-17-pos-
itive lymphocytes could be helpful to outline the progression for 
patients with gastric cancer.

Brahim, R. Jouini, A. Chadli
*Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Natural killer cells are considered 
to have prognostic impact in several solid tumours. In colorectal 
carcinoma, their role remains obscure. We aim to determine 
whether the presence of NK cells in tumour tissue is associated 
with a better overall survival.
Methods: A total of 104 tumour specimens from patients 
after curative resection were reviewed. Areas with the highest 
lymphocyte density in the centre and margins of each specimen 
were marked. Tissue microarrays regrouping cores extracted from 
marked areas were formed. Immunohistochemistry was carried out 
on slides resulting from the section of TMA blocks. Anti-CD56 
antibody was used for NK cells identification.
Results: Mean age was 61.6 years. Gender ratio Male/Female was 
1.36. 84.6% of tumours were Adenocarcinomas NOS, with a low 
differentiated grade in 80.7% of cases. 44.2% of patients were 
pTNM stage III or IV. Average follow-up period was 60 months. 
41 deaths occurred. Mean number of NK cells in tumour centre 
and margins were 2.2 and 1.52 respectively. 31.7% of patients had 
a total of 4 NK cells or more. There was no significant difference 
in densities of NK cells between the centre and the margins of the 
tumour. Mean survival was 55.59 months. There was no correlation 
between density of NK cells in tumour tissue and overall survival 
(p=0.272).

Prognosison the pre-treatment immunological characteristics of 
neoadjuvant therapy in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma
Y. Liu*, J. Li
*The Fourth Hospital, China
Background & objectives: The expression of PD-L1 and tumour-
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in tumour microenvironment can 
predict the prognosis in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma 
(ESCC). This study aims to explore the prognosis of pre-treatment 
immunological characteristics in ESCC before the neoadjuvant 
therapy (NAT).
Methods: A total of 205 patients who receive 2-3 cycles of NAT 
and was surgically resected between 2015 and 2020.The expression 
levels of PD-L1, CD4+, CD8+, FOXP3+ and CD20+ cells before 
the NAT were observed. The patients were randomly divided into 
the training set and the validation set, and then the nomograms 
were drawn to predict the patient prognosis.
Results: The expression of PD-L1 before the NAT was positively 
correlation (P <0.05)with different types of TILs, with a posi-
tively related trends to the level of histological grade and lymph 
node metastasis status. The expression levels in TILs are positively 
correlated with postoperative histological grading, negatively con-
nected to postoperative tumour size( P <0.05). We build two prog-
nostic models and further verify it, results show that the predictive 
lymph node metastasis status model and the predictive depth of 
tumour infiltration model based on the expression level of PD-L1 
and TILs of pre-NAT show a good consistency and have good 
predictive capabilities compared with ideal models.
Conclusion: The higher of TILs expression in ESCC, the higher 
of the expression of PD-L1, CD4+, CD8+, FOXP3+ and CD20+ 
cells. There is a raising trend of histological grade with a high-TILs 
in the pre-NAT ESCC patients, and the higher the chance of lymph 
node metastasis. Two predicted models have a moderate to good 
discrimination and consistency, which can provide the predictive 
value for the ESCC patients before the NAT, and it also can provide 
references for clinical precision treatment.

Adding a zero Buds group (BD0) in the tumour budding scoring 
system in colorectal carcinomas: is it relevant?
I. Helal*, M. Ben Thayer, F. Khanchel, S. Fkih, R. Hedhli, E. Ben 
Brahim, R. Jouini, A. Chadli
*Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The validated Budding scoring system 
is made up of 3 groups: BD1(0–4 buds), BD2(5–9 buds), BD3(≥10 
buds). A recent study suggested adding a fourth group with zero 
Buds(BD0). We aim to study the accuracy of the onset of BD0 
category
Methods: Our study included retrospectively patients who were 
operated on for CCR during a four-year-period from 2013 to 2016. 
Patients who received neoadjuvant treatment were excluded. We 
performed conventional BD scoring for all cases. We divided the 
BD1 group into two groups BD0 (0 buds/0.785 mm2) and BD1*( 
1–4 buds/0.785 mm2 ). We studied the differences between these 
two groups.
Results: Our sample of 133 patients consisted in 75 men and 58 
women. According to the conventional BD scoring system, 67carci-
nomas were BD1, 33 were BD2 and 33 were BD3. The BD1 group 
was divided into two groups: 22 BD0 and 45 BD1*. Comparing 
the two groups, we found no statistically significant difference 
between BD0 and BD1* groups regarding age(p=0.5), tumour 
size(p=0.5), tumour grade(p=0.6), T stage, N stage(p=0.5),M 
stage(p=0.1), AJCC stage (p=0.2), vascular invasion(p=1), peri-
neural invasion(p=0.7) and overall survival( p=0.9). However, 
when we compared the four groups(BD0, BD1*,BD2,BD3), there 
was a statistically significant association between BD and perineu-
ral invasion(p=0.02) , M stage (p=0.05), AJCC stage (p=0.03) and 
overall survival(p=0.02).
Conclusion: BD is ever arousing pathologists’ interest in the latest 
years. The onset of a BD0 category has recently been proposed. 
Our study revealed that there were no statistically significant dif-
ference between the two groups BD0 and BD1* regarding the main 
histoprognostic factors and the overall survival. These findings 
suggest that adding a fourth group BD0 wouldn’t have an additional 
relevance. However, further and larger studies are needed to assess 
the accuracy of adding the BD0 group.

Microsatellite instability (MSI) immunohistochemistry (IHC), 
colorectal cancer and Lynch syndrome (LS) genetic testing 
– one year experience at UK District General Hospital
A. Bommana*, R. Swamy
*Lister Hospital, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: BRAFV600E mutation followed by 
MLH1 promoter hypermethylation to identify LS in colorectal can-
cer is practised at our centre. This algorithm is followed for cases 
with loss of MLH1 IHC expression. We audited our practice to 
identify LS in colorectal cancers.
Methods: 209 colorectal cancers with their MSI IHC results 
reported during 2021 at our department were retrieved. Cases with 
loss of MLH1 IHC expression were identified. BRAF status ana-
lysed by New Genomic Sequencing (NGS) DNA panel and MLH1 
promoter hypermethylation test results were recorded.
Results: 43 cases with loss of MLH1 and PMS2 IHC expression 
were identified. NGS showed wild-type BRAF in 9 cases. MLH1 
promoter hypermethylation was present in 2/9 but absent in 
4/9 cases with wild type BRAF. Thus 4/43 cases with loss of 
MLH1 IHC expression, wild type BRAF and no MLH1 promoter 
hypermethylation were identified as LS colorectal cancers. 
The subsequent results following MLH1 IHC testing were not 
available in time for discussion of treatment options at colorectal 
Multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) in 7 of these cases. Pathologist 
did not request MLH1 hypermethylation test in time for 3 cases 
and negative MLH1 hypermethylation result became available in 
4 cases, after MDT discussion.
Conclusion: NICE and Royal College of Pathologists recommend 
MSI IHC testing in colorectal cancer to detect LS but awareness of 
its value to guide treatment decisions is lacking. People with LS 
have colorectal cancers that respond more favourably to immuno-
therapy and unfavourably to conventional chemotherapy regimens 
that include 5-Flurouracil. Pathways to facilitate timely MSI testing 
for district general hospitals which rely on external genomic labora-
tories for cancer molecular work-up needs to be addressed.

Background & objectives: We aimed to grade and stage AMN, 
PMP cases diagnosed between January 2012- June 2019 using 
AJCC 8th edition and WHO 5thedition criteria; to see if the three-
tier system has bearing on prognosis, survival and find individual 
adverse prognostic factors.
Methods: After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, 
slides of 81 patients (74 AMN and PMP; and 7 Goblet cell adeno-
carcinoma (GCA)) were reviewed and their clinico-radiological 
details were obtained. For grading and staging, 3-tier system was 
used. Survival analysis was performed to determine outcome of 
patients in different AJCC grades and to find individual adverse 
prognostic factors.
Results: For AMN and PMP, the median age was 56 years and 
median serum CEA was 14.45 ng/ml. There was a statistically 
significant difference in the Disease-free survival (DFS) of 
different grades and different histological entities of AMN (LAMN, 
HAMN, invasive adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated mucinous 
adenocarcinomas) and PMP. Cytological atypia grade in appendix 
and pathological “M” stage showed statistically significant 
correlation with the DFS. The DFS of GCA was shorter than that 
of mucinous adenocarcinomas of appendix (G2 and G3). Tumour 
heterogeneity, scanty material on biopsy, inability to grade on cell 
block, discordance between biopsy and resection were some of the 
challenges faced during review.
Conclusion: Grading AMN in three-tier system is feasible and has 
bearing on the prognosis. Grade of cytological atypia in appen-
dix and pathological M stage were important variables affecting 
the prognosis. The prognosis of GCA is worse than mucinous 
adenocarcinomas.

Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia
Background & objectives: Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel 
Disease (IBD), both Crohn’s Disease (CD), and Ulcerative Colitis 
(UC) usually presents with greater severity and often need early 
surgical intervention. We aim to describe histopathological and 
surgical characteristics of IBD paediatric patients in a Colombian 
cohort.
Methods: Longitudinal retrospective study including all patients 
≤18 years who had an established diagnosis of IBD from 1977 
to 2021, at Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá. Patients were divided 
in two groups: patients with and without surgical intervention. A 
Kaplan-Meier curve was performed to estimate the cumulative risk 
of needing surgery overtime. Variables were analysed as measures 
of central tendency.
Results: A total of 34 paediatric patients with IBD where found, 
17 with CD and 17 with UC. 18 (58.8%) patients presented with 
severe disease activity confirmed by histopathology. Five (15%) 
patients developed low grade dysplasia, on average, after 6.7 years 
(σ: 2.5) and 20 (60%) required surgical intervention within the first 
5 years, 75% with CD and 25% UC. Intestinal resection for fistula 
treatment, was performed in 50% of the cases, and 41.6% required 
surgical reintervention. A Kaplan Meier Curve estimated a cumula-
tive risk, for the need of surgery, from the time of diagnosis of IBD 
with severe activity, of 15% at 1 year and 20% at 5 years.
Conclusion: This study shows severe clinical and histopathologi-
cal presentation of Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease in 
our cohort. Surgical intervention requirement was high among this 
population and tend to increase overtime. Although, as in the lit-
erature, CD patients required more surgical procedures, need for 
surgery for UC was significant. A high percentage of reinterven-
tions within the next years was also noted. Due to the severity of 
the disease, early suspicion, and diagnosis of paediatric or early-
onset IBD could improve its natural course.

Expression of the ghrelin receptor in GIST
I.A. Spiridon*, S.E. Giusca, D. Ciobanu-Apostol, I.D. Caruntu
*U.M.F. "Grigore T. Popa" Iasi, Romania
Background & objectives: Ghrelin is a hormone exerting complex 
metabolic functions through coupling with its receptor (GHSR). 
This axis has documented effects in obesity-related neoplasia, with 
scarce knowledge on gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) tumo-
rigenesis. We describe the expression pattern of GHSR in GISTs.
Methods: The immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of GHSR 
was evaluated in 124 cases of GIST (78 gastric and 46 small bowel 
tumours) from adult patients, diagnosed based on histology and 
a standard panel of markers (CD117, CD34, DOG1). Statistical 
analysis was performed in order to correlate the tissue expression 
of the receptor with the classical clinicopathological factors.
Results: The semi-qualitative expression of GHSR revealed dif-
fusely granular, homogenous, cytoplasmic staining and nuclear 
immunoreactivity that showed differentiated staining, with het-
erogenous intratumoral distribution in tumour core versus tumour 
periphery. An IHC score was developed to integrate these findings, 
differentiating between tumours with absent (score 0), low expres-
sion (score 1) and high expression (score 2) of GHSR. The GHSR 
score correlated with the presence of myxoid degeneration of the 
stroma (p<0.001) and showed a statistically relevant association 
with patient prognosis, assessed through AFIP and m-NIH criteria 
(p<0.03). Significant correlations with other clinicopathological 
factors were not confirmed.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that GISTs harbour 
spatial heterogeneity, with tumour cells in the periphery of the 
proliferation displaying a distinct phenotype when compared to the 
ones in tumour core. This feature could justify the differences in 
recurrence rates across tumours with various prognostic staging. 
The expression of GHSR in GIST is a potential indicator of the 
involvement of ghrelin axis in tumorigenesis, a promising result 
which can be further capitalized by molecular analysis of the 
isoforms GHSR1a and GHSR1b.

Evaluation of tumour-stroma ratio in gastric adenocarcinomas 
with semi-automatic digital imaging method and its relation 
with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis
B.E. Gözükara*, A. Gönültaş, A. Sürmelioğlu, F. Aker, M. Doğan
*Haydarpasa Numune Education and Research Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: The importance of tumour-stroma 
ratio (TSR) as a prognostic marker in some cancer types has been 
demonstrated. The aim of this study is to examine the relation-
ship between TSR and histopathological parameters and survival 
in gastric adenocarcinomas.
Methods: The study group was formed with 155 cases of gas-
tric resection specimens diagnosed with adenocarcinoma between 
2011-2018. Stroma areas were calculated using semi-automatic 
digital imaging and software (EasyPath, Argenit, Turkey). The

cases were grouped as low stroma (<36%) and high stroma (≥36%) 
with a threshold value of 36% determined. The clinicopathological 
findings, recurrence, and survival data were compared with TSR.
Results: According to this threshold value, 63.2% (n=98) of 
the cases had low stroma and 36.8% (n=57) had high stroma. A 
statistically significant negative correlation was found between 
TSR and overall survival, disease-free survival and recurrence 
rate (p:0.001; p<0.01). Of the clinicopathological parameters, only 
gender and perineural invasion (PNI) were found to be significantly 
associated with TSR (p=0.031; p<0.05). In Cox multivariable 
regression analysis, a significant statistical correlation was shown 
between overall survival and age, stroma ratio, histopathological 
subtype, LVI, and T stage (p<0.01). It was determined that tumour 
stroma ratio ≥36 increased the mortality risk of the cases by 2.253 
(95% CI: 1.411-3.597) times.
Conclusion: TSR has a strong, independent prognostic value in 
gastric adenocarcinomas and would therefore be considered for 
integration into routine pathology practice after evaluation in vali-
dation studies with larger series.

carcinoma

*Istanbul Medipol University, Pathology Department, Turkey
Background & objectives: Gastric cancer (GC) is the 4th most 
common cancer worldwide and the 2nd leading cause of cancer-
related death. In our study, the relationship between microsatellite 
instability and programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL-1) expression in 
GCs and clinicopathological parameters was investigated.
Methods: Immunohistochemical staining for PD-L1 (22C3 
clone) expression was performed on 37 cases. Expression was 
scored in both the tumour and tumour-infiltrating immune cells. 
Furthermore, tumoral mismatch repair status (MLH1, MSH2, 
MSH6, PMS1) was evaluated.
Results: Twenty of our patients were male and 17 were female. 
The mean age was 62.5 (range 34-87). PD-L1 expression, either 
tumoral or tumour-infiltrating immune cells, was present in 8,10% 
(3/37) of GCs. Overall mismatch repair deficiency was seen in 
27,02% (10/37) of the cases. PDL1 expression was observed in all 
mismatch repair-deficient cases (3/3).
Conclusion: We found PDL-1 positive in 30% of our patients with 
mismatch repair deficiency. Thus, gastric cancer patients with 
mismatch repair deficiency tend to show PD-L1 expression; this 
specifically indicated that mismatch repair deficiency could be 
prime candidates for PD-L1-directed therapy. Further studies in 
larger series are needed to confirm our findings.

N. Vidal-Robau, G. Caballero, R. López del Campo, L. Rojo, A. 
Diaz, M. Cuatrecasas
*Pathology Department, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain
Background & objectives: Lymph node (LN) metastasis is an 
important prognostic factor in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). We 
aimed to demonstrate the presence of lymphatic vessels (LV) in 
the mucosa of in-situ CRC (pTis), and the analysis of regional LNs 
using a molecular method.
Methods: This is an observational and retrospective study of surgi-
cally resected in-situ CRCs. of LNs were assessed with both the 
One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA) assay and H&E. The 
OSNA result, or total tumour load (TTL), is the amount of CK19 
mRNA copies present in all LNs from a patient. D2-40 immu-
nostaining was performed in both pTis and normal mucosa.
Results: We analysed 39 surgically resected in-situ CRCs. 
The mean age was 68.6 years-old, 23 (59%) were men, and 22 
(56%) were located on the right colon. A median of 16 LNs were 
freshly dissected per patient. All cases were low-grade, pN0 
with H&E and did not receive adjuvant therapy. At follow-up, 
all patients were alive without disease between 1 and 5 years. 
All tumours presented LVs in the lamina propria, being negative 
in normal colon mucosa. We detected 11/39 (28%) patients with 
positive LNs by OSNA. Positive tumours were more frequent 
in older men and located in the right colon. The TTL were low, 
from 400 to 4270 copies/μL.
Conclusion: Despite of pTis is considered to have little or no risk 
of LN metastasis, this study demonstrates the presence of LVs in 
the lamina propria of in-situ CRC, and of low amounts of tumour 
burden in regional LNs, only detected by molecular methods. Nev-
ertheless, this positivity has been demonstrated to confer no clini-
cal significance or risk of recurrence.

cholagniocarinoma

Cipriano
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitario de Coimbra, Department of 
Pathology, Portugal
Background & objectives: Distal cholangiocarcinoma (dCCA) 
has a low incidence but exhibits a poor prognosis even in patients 
submitted to curative resection. This study sought to evaluate the 
prognostic value of cancer stem cell (CSC) markers in patients with 
dCCA, after surgical resection.
Methods: Retrospective cohort study with evaluation of all 
patients submitted to surgical resection due to dCCA, between 
2008 and 2019. The primary endpoint is to assess the value of 
CSC markers in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival 
(DFS). Immunostaining for CD44, ALDH1 and CD56 was 
performed. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee 
(CHUC-123-20).
Results: 37 patients were identified, with 62.2% male and 
37.8% female, with an average age of 69.19 (±9.92) years. 
After a median follow-up of 14±23.7 months, the OS was 
16±2.8 months and the DFS was 14±5.2 months. CD44 and 
ALDH1 expression was observed in 34.8% and 26.1% of the 
evaluated tumours, respectively. No expression of CD56 
was registered. In univariate analysis, CD44 (p=0.032) and 
ALDH1 (p=0.016) expression had influence in OS. Regard-
ing DFS, no influence was verified. Multivariate analysis 
confirmed these findings: CD44 (HR=0.089, p=0.033) and 
ALDH1 (HR=9.24, p=0.037). ALDH1 expression was estab-
lished as an independent worse prognostic factor concerning 
OS, with CD44 expression being associated with a better 
prognosis.
Conclusion: This study supports the role of CSC markers as 
predictors of OS in dCCA. ALDH1 expression was associated 
with worse OS, which is related to the more aggressive biologi-
cal behaviour of these cells. CD44 was unexpectedly associated 
with a better OS, which may be explained by the fact that in our 
study the majority of CD44 positive tumours were small and 
at an initial stage (T1/T2). More studies are needed to clarify 
this role.

Agreement in tumour budding and poorly differentiated cluster 
detection in consecutive digitalized images with focus on mim-
ickers, serial images and expertise
M. Jimeno*, R. López-Martos, J.P. Fernández, M.Á. Serrano, S. 
Roca, A. Sánchez-Gil
*Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Spain
Background & objectives: Tumour budding (TB) is a recognized 
adverse prognostic factor in colorectal cancer (CRC) but agree-
ment on its quantification varies significantly. We aim to study 
interobserver agreement using digitalized slides with an emphasis 
in mimickers, serial images and observers’ experience.
Methods: Three consecutive H&E - CK AE1.3 - H&E digitalized 
images were obtained from 30 CRC cases, using a “hotspot” 
study area of 0.785 mm2 for each. Three observers with differing 
experience reviewed the 90 images, reporting the number of 
TB and poorly differentiated clusters (PDF) in addition to false 
positive images. For agreement analysis, the intraclass correlation 
coefficient was applied.
Results: Analysis showed moderate agreement values for TB and 
PDC detection in H&E images. Despite the presence of abundant 
mimickers in CK sections, TB and PDC detection was facilitated, 
and a higher correlation was observed, especially for cases with 
moderate or severe inflammation. No significant disparity in slide 
assessment was evident between the 3 observers.
Consecutive sections have shown a significant evolution of images 
with variable size and number of small groups of cells in only 10 
microns thick. A notable number of cases have shown a significant 
progression towards a lower or higher TB/PDC number, that is 
enough to modify the final grade.
Conclusion: Despite reports of moderate to substantial 
agreement with respect to TB or PDC grade, agreement with 
respect to individual cell groups is moderate at best. Most 
studies published to date have selected representative slides but 
no specific area to be evaluated, leading to intrinsic selection 
bias. Cell morphology evolution observed in serial images 
evidence the need of algorithm-based analyses of larger areas to 
obtain an average value that could be translated into a powerful 
and reproducible prognostic tool.

Automated tumour budding quantification in T1 colorectal 
carcinoma H&E slides: association to lymph node metastasis
I. Nearchou*, Y. Kajiwara, M. Ueno, K. Kouzu, T. Nakamura, K. 
Lillard, H. Ueno
*Indica Labs, Inc., USA
Background & objectives: Tumour budding (BD) is a significant 
predictor of lymph node metastasis (LNM) in T1 colorectal cancer 
(CRC). However, the reproducibility of BD-scoring remains sub-
optimal. This study aimed to automatically quantify BD on H&E 
slides and assess its association with LNM.
Methods: A deep-learning algorithm was applied on 197 T1 CRC 
H&E slides to automatically detect BD using HALO® and HALO 
AI™ image analysis platform. Univariate and multivariate logistic 
regressions were performed to assess the predictive value of BD 
and other features currently assessed in the clinic. The Akaike 
information criterion was used to identify the model with the high-
est predictive value.
Results: Various automated BD quantification methods were 
employed including recording the number and density of buds 
across the entire invasive front (IF) and at a hotspot area. BD num-
ber and density assessed on all slides containing the IF (p=0.001 
and p=0.001) as well as on a single slide with highest BD (p=0.004 
and p=0.013) were shown to be significantly associated with LNM 
when assessed using univariate logistic regression. The model with 
highest predictive value for LNM included BD density assessed on 
all slides, which was also the most significant feature (p<0.001), 
tumour grade (p<0.001) , lymphovascular invasion (p=0.285) and 
submucosal involvement depth (p=0.044).
Conclusion: Here, we demonstrate that the use of deep-learning 
algorithms could prove to be promising for the objective, standard-
ised and reproducible BD quantification in H&E slides as well as 
for assisting pathologists during treatment decision making.

*Pathology Department, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain
Background & objectives: Identification of risk factors associated 
with lymph node metastasis (LNM) in pT1 colorectal carcinoma 
(CRC) is performed by histological evaluation. The aim of this 
study is to assess the inter-observer agreement in the evaluation of 
histological risk factors for LNM.
Methods: Scanned slides from 10 pT1 CRCs were assessed by 22 
pathologists for submucosal infiltration depth (SID), lymphovas-
cular invasion (LVI), histological grade (HG), and tumour budding 
(TB). The LVI, HG and TB concordance were calculated with 
percentage of agreement and Krippendorff’s alpha; intraclass cor-
relation coefficient (ICC) for SID. An ulterior consensus meeting 
was held to analyse differences in histologic criteria assessment.
Results: Seven tumours were resected by endoscopy, and three 
by surgery. Four pT1 arose on pedunculated polyps, and six on 
sessile polyps. The evaluation of SID had moderate reliability, 
with an average ICC (two-way random-effects model) of 0.59 (95% 
confidence interval 0.12-0.88). LVI had the highest agreement rate 
(83.64%). TB had 71.36% of agreement and Krippendorff’s alpha 
(α) of 0.13. HG had 64.44% of agreement and α = 0.26. In the 
consensus meeting the use of the measuring tool was corrected, as it 
generated discordances. An agreement on the criteria for assessing 
SID for pedunculated and sessile polyps was also reached, and the 
criteria for LVI, TB and HG were reviewed.
Conclusion: This is a pilot ongoing study. Lack of consistency 
in the evaluation of some prognostic factors by pathologists was 
mostly due to differences in measurement criteria, as well as the 
small number of cases evaluated by many pathologists.

Methods: To comparatively assess the staining patterns of these 
markers across a broad range of different tumour entities, tissue 
microarrays containing 7711 neoplasms from 117 different tumour 
types and subtypes was analysed by immunohistochemistry.
Results: Positivity for CK20, SATB2, CDH17, and villin was seen 
in 94.4%, 88.1%, 98.3%, and 96.7% of colorectal, 36.4%, 22.4%, 
52.8%, and 72.4% of gastric, 38.3%, 15%, 51.7%, and 65% of 
oesophageal adenocarcinomas, 49.1%, 20.8%, 69.8%, and 66% of 
adenocarcinomas of the ampulla of Vater, 19.4%, 1.4%, 40.3%, and 
54.9% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, 8.7%, 2.2%, 2.2%, 
and 23.9% of hepatocellular carcinomas, and in 5.5%, 10.1%, 
12.8%, and 12.8% of pulmonary adenocarcinomas. A positivity 
of ≥3 (or all 4) markers occurred in 96.2% (83.2%) of colorectal, 
33.2% (13.3%) of gastric, 23.2% (11.7%) of oesophageal, 8.3% 
(0%) of ductal pancreatic, 0.9% (0%) of pulmonary adenocarcino-
mas, and in 0% (0%) of hepatocellular carcinomas.
Conclusion: All individual markers support the distinction of 
GIT adenocarcinomas from liver and lung cancer while a com-
bined analysis of multiple markers may increase diagnostic accu-
racy. Characteristic staining patterns also occur in other enti-
ties. For example, Villin expression is linked to neuroendocrine 
neoplasms and yolk sac tumours. CDH17 is often positive in in 
neuroendocrine neoplasms. CK20 is linked to urothelial neo-
plasms and Merkel cell carcinomas. SATB2 occurs in Merkel 
cell carcinomas, renal cell carcinomas, and several mesenchymal 
tumour entities.

Sánchez, E.A. Sierra Arellano, R. Unciti Ruiz, Á. Panizo Santos*
*Navarra University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: Several types of nonconventional 
dysplasia have been recently described in inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD). However, strict morphologic criteria are lacking, 
and their clinicopathologic features including potential association 
with conventional dysplasia and/or colorectal cancer are poorly 
understood.
Methods: A total of 24 IBD-associated CRC (IBD-CRC) colectomy 
specimens of 22 patients were reviewed. Seven morphologic 
patterns were recognized: hypermucinous dysplasia, traditional 
serrated adenoma-like, sessile serrated lesion-like and serrated 
lesion, not otherwise specified, Paneth cell differentiation and 
goblet cell deficient dysplasia. Lesions were classified according 
to the WHO 2019 criteria and literature review.
Results: We identified 149 dysplastic lesions and occurred with 
similar frequency in men and women (n=17 and n=5, respectively), 
with a mean age of 57 years (range: 34-82) with long history 
(mean: 9,6 years, range: 2-27) of ulcerative colitis (n=11, 42%) and 
Crohn’s disease (n=13, 58%). All nonconventional dysplasia types 
were common (55% of the cases), present as focal or extended, 
pure or mixed, in peritumoral and remote mucosa. Tumours were 
more likely to be well-differentiated (43%), left-sited (58%), with 
mucinous features (33%) and signet-ring cell (12.5%). Many cases 
were deeply invasive (62% were pT3 or pT4) and 54% had lymph 
node metastasis.
Conclusion: Clinicopathological characteristics of IBD-associated 
CRC were significantly different from sporadic colorectal adeno-
carcinoma. Histopathological findings of nonconventional patterns 
of dysplasia were common in IBD-CRCs. Most cases had mixed 
and focal or extended features of all nonconventional dysplasia 
types. Nonconventional dysplasia occurred with similar frequency 
in ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. We did not find associa-
tion between nonconventional dysplasia type and characteristics 
of IBD-CRC.

Soler, E. García-Granero Ximénez, F. Giner Segura
*Hospital Universitari i Politècnic La Fe de València, Spain
Background & objectives: There is high variability in relapse 
rate among series (3-14%) after right radical hemicolectomy. 
Retroperitoneal margin is a well-recognized parameter, frequently 
forgotten. The objective is to assess the invasion of retroperitoneal 
margin in pathologic specimens after radical right hemicolectomy.
Methods: Prospective histopathologic and clinical analysis of 79 
patients who underwent right hemicolectomy (2017-2019). Retro-
peritoneal margin was inked and measured macro- and microscopi-
cally and was defined as affected when tumour distance was less or 
equal to 1mm. Association between retroperitoneal margin invasion 
and other histological and oncological results was analysed.
Results: Involvement of retroperitoneal margin was found in 
15 cases (18.98%) and was significantly associated with more 
advanced degrees of dedifferentiation (G2: p=0,017; G3: p=0,037) 
tumour budding (intermediate grade: p=0.028; high grade: 
p=0.005), presence of poorly differentiated groups (p=0,039) and 
perineural invasion signs (p=0,044). The involvement of the ret-
roperitoneal margin was associated with a worse overall survival 
(p=<0.01) and worse overall recurrence (p=<0.01).
Conclusion: Retroperitoneal surgical margin resection involvement 
could be considered an anatomopathological marker of poor 
prognosis and greater incidence of relapse after oncological 
right colectomy. Tumours involving this circumferential margin 
show features of aggressive behaviour such as increased degrees 
of dedifferentiation, tumour budding, presence of poorly 
differentiated groups and perineural invasion. A greater number of 
cases and longer follow-up term are needed to confirm the clinical 
significance of this parameter.

*Hospital Mateu Orfila, Spain
Background & objectives: The prevalence of haemorrhoids is 
estimated at 4.4% (up-to 13-20%). Findings of malignant lesions in 
haemorrhoidectomy specimens are infrequent. The objective of this 
study is to be aware of the incidence of malignant lesions found in 
haemorrhoidectomy-specimens, not clinically suspected.
Methods: We carried out an eight-years retrospective study of 
haemorrhoidectomy specimens collected of the Mateu Orfila Hos-
pital (Menorca), Spain. All samples coded as “haemorrhoidec-
tomy” and/or “haemorrhoid” between 2013 and 2021, were selected 
from the Pathology Department database. Clinicopathological and 
demographic variables were collected from the electronic clinical 
records.
Results: 444 specimens from 246 men and 198 women, were 
analysed. The mean age was 45 years (range 20-84 years).

(SCC) and AIN-III;10.-AIN-II;11.-AIN-I. The resection-margins 
were positive in three cases, negative in three and could not be 
determined in five cases. Cases 1 and 2 had HIV. Cases with only 
AIN and cases 1 and 3 had clinical follow-up. The SCC-in-situ, 
margin expansion was performed. Case 9 received QT-RDT. NET 
and MM cases were treated at another centre.
Conclusion: In our study the incidence of malignant lesions 
found incidentally in haemorrhoidectomy specimens was 2.47%. 
We consider that the surgical margins should be stained whenever 
possible and include a good representation of the material sent 
from the haemorrhoidectomy specimens, because although it is 
not frequent, we can find malignant lesions in these samples; and 
if so, we should try to provide as much histological information 
as possible.

trian University of Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: Tumour budding (TB) and tumour-
stroma ratio (TSR) are independent prognostic factors in colorectal 
carcinomas. Our aim was to assess the expression of small leucine-
rich protein (SLRP) Decorin qualitatively and semi-quantitatively 
and to correlate this with TB, TSR and stromal desmoplasia.
Methods: Eighty-six cases of colorectal adenocarcinoma were 
used to generate tissue microarrays that were stained with Masson 
trichrome, reticulin, orcein, and immunostained with pankeratin, 
decorin, CD8, and PDL1. Information about mismatch repair 
proteins (MMR) and Eosinophil leucocyte density were known. 
Decorin mRNA was assessed with rtPCR.
Results: Cases were subdivided into 4 groups: Group Α 18% TB-
HIGH/TSR-HIGH, Group B 14% TB-HIGH/TSR-LOW, Group C 
21% TB-LOW/TSR-HIGH, Group D 40% TB-LOW/TSR-LOW. 
Decorin mRNA and protein expression were decreased in TB 
regions (p<0.003) and TSR regions (p<0.001). Decorin expression 
was also decreased in desmoplastic characterized areas. Decorin 
was a more sensitive indicator of stromal changes at the invasive 
front when compared with the morphologic assessment of collagen 
deposition and desmoplasia (p<0.001). There was no correlation 
between decorin expression and clinicopathologic parameters, 
MMR and Eosinophil density. Survival analysis showed no prog-
nostic significance of Decorin protein and mRNA expression.
Conclusion: Decorin expression is decreased at the tumour front 
and in both the TB and TSR annotated regions. Decorin is a more 
sensitive indicator of the initial stromal changes that take place at 
the tumour-stroma borders compared to morphological assessment 
of desmoplasia. Decorin expression appears of no prognostic value 
in colorectal adenocarcinomas in our cohort.

Simulated digital gastric cancer endoscopic biopsies and surgi-
cal resections stained with PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx present 
similar PD-L1 expression when scored using combined positive 
score

Peltz, E. Manna, S. Tabuena-Frolli
*Agilent Technologies, USA
Background & objectives: The dynamic range of PD-L1 expres-
sion in endoscopic biopsies of gastric cancer (GC) is not as well-
documented as that of surgical resections. This abstract aims to 
demonstrate the range of PD-L1 expression in simulated digital 
endoscopic biopsies (SBs) of GC.
Methods: PD-L1 expression in GC SBs (simulated via ImageScope 
software from surgical resections stained with PD-L1 IHC 22C3 
pharmDx) was evaluated in whole-slide images using combined 
positive score. Scores are determined by dividing the number of 
viable PD-L1-stained tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune 
cells by the total number of viable tumour cells. Totals are multi-
plied by 100 and displayed as integers.
Results: Of the 231 GC (including both gastric and 
gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma) SB samples, the 
average denominator, determined using QuPath, was found to be 
11,742 tumour cells. In contrast, the average denominator of the 
20 resection samples was 231,623 cells. Despite this greater than 
19-fold difference in number of tumour cells, the distribution of 
combined positive score (CPS) scores remained similar in both 
sample types. SBs and surgical resections demonstrated similar 
distributions of CPS scores in terms of minimum, maximum, 25th, 
50th, and 75th percentiles. In addition, the average CPS scores for 
SBs and surgical resections were approximately CPS 24 and CPS 
25, respectively.
Conclusion: These results suggest that, although the tumour cell 
counts of SBs are substantially lower than for resection samples, 
both present a dynamic range of PD-L1 expression. This suggests 
that GC SBs demonstrate a PD-L1 expression range similar to 
that of surgical resections, improving confidence in the evalua-
tion of both small and large samples using CPS.

*Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Several studies have assessed 
the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on cancers around the 
world. However, no similar study has been conducted in 
Tunisia. We aim to Study the impact of Covid-19 crisis on 
the anatomopathological characteristics of different digestive 
cancers.
Methods: We present a retrospective study conducted on cases of 
digestive carcinomas: colorectal (CRC), gastric (GC), pancreatic 
(PC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) operated 
on at Habib Thameur Hospital in between the first December 
2016 and June 30, 2021.We subdivided these cases into two 
groups according to the date of their operation (before/during 
and after the lockdown) and we compared their histoprognostic 
characteristics.
Results: These were 270 cases, including 83 diagnosed during 
and after confinement (30.7%). These were 219 cases of CRC, 
22 cases of GC, 13 cases of PC and 16 GIST. Among the 83 
cases operated starting from the lockdown, 12 were grade 3, 72 
stage T3 or T4, 37 had lymph node metastases, one had visceral 
metastases, 27 presented vascular emboli and 31 had perineural 
invasion. Carcinomas operated on starting from the lockdown 
were statistically significantly correlated with visceral metasta-
sis (p=0.01) and a more pejorative histological grade (p<10-3).

However we did not find any statistically significant difference 
concerning the stage T, Nstatus, vascular emboli, perineural 
invasion and stage.
Conclusion: From the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, the politi-
cal and the health institutional policies were to avoid delaying 
management of cancerous pathologies. Our study showed that 
Covid-19 pandemic clearly affected the prognosis of cancer with 
significantly increased risk of high grade cases and metastases. 
This could be explained by the fact that patients avoided seeking 
for medical assistance for fear to be exposed toCovid-19 in health 
structures. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of this 
crisis on the survival of cancer patients.

jártó, Z. Schaff, A. Kiss, G. Lotz
*Department of Pathology, Forensic and Insurance Medicine, Sem-
melweis University, Hungary
Background & objectives: Tumour budding (TBing) is a prognos-
tic factor in colorectal cancer and recent studies indicated similar 
role of poorly differentiated clusters (PDC). However, their prog-
nostic value is still controversial in gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC), 
thus our aim was to determine it.
Methods: HE slides of 290 GAC patients was investigated. TB 
was defined as an isolated tumour cell or a tumour cell cluster 
of up to four cells, while PDC as a tumour cell cluster of five or 
more cells. TBs and PDCs were evaluated according to the Inter-
national Tumour Budding Consensus Conference and divided into 
low- (Grade1+2) and high (Grade3) groups.
Results: Univariable (Kaplan-Meier) analysis revealed significant 
negative correlation of both TBing (p=0,0001) and PDCs (p=0,02) 
with overall survival (OS) in the total cohort and TBing in the 
intestinal GACs. No significant correlation was found regarding 
the diffuse and mixed Lauren type GACs. Significant negative cor-
relation with OS was also found by multivariable (Cox) analysis of 
PDCs in the total cohort, moreover in case of both TBing and PDCs 
in the intestinal type GACs. Logistic regression analysis with back-
ward selection showed a significant positive correlation of TBing 
with the presence of regional lymph node metastasis (p=0.009).
Conclusion: Both tumour budding and PDCs are promising prog-
nostic markers of gastric adenocarcinomas. High tumour budding 
is associated with increased risk of nodal metastasis.
Funding: This study was partly supported by the New National 
Excellence Program (ÚNKP-21-4-I-SE-32) of the Ministry for 
Innovation and Technology, Hungary.

Microsatellite instability status and tumour regression grading 
on gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma – the 
first portrait of a Portuguese reality
R. Moiteiro da Cruz*, V. Lobo, C. Melo-Alvim, R. Luís
*Department of Pathology - Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN; 
Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal
Background & objectives: Locally advanced gastroesophageal 
junction and gastric adenocarcinoma (GEJGA) usually carry a poor 
prognosis; a molecular subgroup is associated with microsatellite 
instability (MSI), whose chemotherapy response has not been well 
characterized yet. Our aim was to evaluate tumour regression (TR), 
stratified by MSI status.
Methods: A retrospective and unicentric cohort study was assem-
bled, encompassing patients submitted to surgery and perioperative 
chemotherapy (pQT) in 2015-2020. Clinical data regarding pre 
and post-treatment features, surgical approach, pQT schemes and 
follow-up was collected. All histological samples were reviewed 
by two observers; TR grading was reassessed, and mismatch repair 
proteins (MMRp) expression was evaluated through immunohisto-
chemistry on tissue micro-arrays.
Results: Out of a total of 64 patients with available tissue 
samples, only 42 displayed residual tumour. Patients were mostly 
male (64%), ranging from 60 to 72-years-old (median:67). The 
series comprised 38,1%(n=16) were moderately differentiated 
adenocarcinomas and 42.9%(n=18) were poorly differentiated 
adenocarcinomas (G3) with 14,3%(n=6) were poorly cohesive, 
the majority of were located in the antrum (n=19); most tumours 
(57,1%) revealed less than 50% of TR (grade 3). From our sample, 
40.5%(n=17) have anomalous MMRp expression and compared 
with tumours with preserved MMRp expression, the former 
group showed a statistically significant (p=0.024) worse tumour 
regression after pQT. However, there was no statistical difference 
between overall survival (p=0.603) and progression-free survival 
(p=0.823).
Conclusion: In our sample, defective MMRp neoplasms showed 
worse response to pQT, whereas anomalous and preserved MMRp 
groups did not seem to differ on prognosis. These new findings in 
the portuguese context, even if stemming from a limited series, are 
in line with emerging evidence suggesting the negative role of pQT 
on MSI tumours and might aid in prompting routine evaluation of 
MSI on GEJGA for therapy selection in the future.

*Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Spain
Background & objectives: Duodenal adenomas are rare tumours 
which mostly occur in individuals with familial adenomatous poly-
posis (FAP) and they can reveal abundant neuroendocrine or Paneth 
cells’ differentiation. Our goal is to describe clinical and patho-
logical differences between sporadic and FAP-associated duodenal 
adenomas.
Methods: Twenty-eight cases of duodenal adenomas diagnosed 
at our institution (from 2010 to 2022) have been collected. Nine 
patients (pts) were in FAP (group 1), whilst in the other 19 cases 
FAP was not clinically suspected (group 2). We revised the 
histology and performed additional immunohistochemical stains for 
synaptophysin, chromogranin, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5 and MUC6.
Results: The mean age was 44.3 years in group1 and 71.5 years in 
group2(p=0.001). In group1, 67% of patients were women while in 
group2 73.7% were men. In both groups, duodenal adenomas were 
found more frequently in locations other than ampullary (67% and 
73.7%, respectively), being multifocal in 56% of group1 and mostly 
unifocal in group2 (89,5%)(p=0,020). A moderate/high number of 
Paneth cells was found in 67% of group1, while the vast majority 
(84.2%) of group2-adenomas had an absence/few Paneth cells(p 
0,013). 68.4% of group1-adenomas had moderate/high chromogra-
nin expression compared to 31.6% of group2. Another finding was 
the presence of neuroendocrine hyperplasia in four cases, one of 
which was in FAP-group.
Conclusion: Duodenal adenomas associated with FAP usually 
occur in younger patients and are frequently multifocal. Histologi-
cally, they show a significantly higher number of Paneth cells and

an increased chromogranin expression was found in our series. 
Occasionally, neuroendocrine hyperplasia within the adenomas can 
be observed. Nevertheless, data does not suggest a higher probabil-
ity of existence of neuroendocrine tumours in adenomas associated 
with FAP.

Spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia as a marker for 
gastric cancer risk prediction
S. Mozgovoi*, M. Stepanchenko, A. Gubanova, M. Parygina, J. 
Fedotova, M. Livzan
*Omsk State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: Assessment of chronic atrophic 
gastritis is the key factor in gastric cancer preventing strategy. 
Spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) can be 
indicated as possible marker of extensive gastric atrophy with 
following association of gastric cancer development.
Methods: Resection specimens (n=30) from patients who had gas-
trectomy due to invasive gastric adenocarcinoma were obtained, 
processed routinely, stained with H&E. Pseudopyloric metaplasia 
(PPM) was recognised as antral-type glands in oxyntic mucosa. 
Microarray method was used to prepare specimens for IHC. Tissue 
specimens were stained with MUC6, TFF2 and pepsinogen-1 (PG-
1) antibodies to reveal either PPM or SPEM accordingly.
Results: Widespread (involving 4-5 glands) PPM was detected in 
14 cases. In 9 cases single (3-4 glands) areas were determined, in 7 
cases pseudopyloric metaplasia wasn’t detected. Foci of metaplas-
tic changes were distributed as follows: PMM sites were found at 
distance of 4-7 cm from the border of invasive tumour. In 3 cases, 
a combination of epithelial dysplasia, intestinal metaplasia, and 
PPM was determined. Expression of PG-1 was found in 12 cases, 
in 1 case expression was artificial. TFF2+ glands were determined 
in 21 cases, including sites nearest to dysplasia foci. SPEM foci 
were designated as a part of true pyloric metaplasia (PPG-1 - ) and 
pseudopyloric metaplasia (PPG-1 +) .
Conclusion: Distribution of PPM wasn’t perifocal as expected, 
but found mostly at the distant zone of adenocarcinoma, although 
in some cases was nearby dysplasia foci. The expression of TFF2 
and PG-1 didn’t always overlap and not all PPM glands could be 
considered a SPEM. The significance of these findings is yet to 
be understood, but recognising pseudopyloric/SPEM metaplasia 
in biopsy specimens could potentially help clinicians to reveal 
patients with considerably higher risk for gastric cancer.

Concurrent loss of MLH1, PMS2 and MSH6 immunoexpression 
in gastrointestinal cancer indicating a widespread dysregulation 
in DNA reparation processes

*General Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, University Hospi-
tal of Augsburg, Germany
Background & objectives: DNA mismatch repair proteins func-
tion as heterodimers (MLH1/PMS2; MSH2/MSH6), usually result-
ing in deficiency in one subsystem in microsatellite instable can-
cers. As the involvement of both subsystems is unusual, we aim to 
shed light on the molecular basis of this phenomenon.
Methods: We retrospectively analysed gastrointestinal can-
cers that underwent immunohistochemical testing for deficient 
DNA mismatch repair proteins during the last four years in our 
hospital to identify cases with a simultaneous deficiency in 
MLH1/PMS2 and MSH2/MSH6. To understand this unusual 
phenomenon, we performed further molecular testing (MSI-
PCR, MLH1 promotor and/or BRAF status) and next-generation 
sequencing focusing on genes related to DNA reparation.
Results: In the cohort, we could identify 103 cases with defi-
cient DNA mismatch repair proteins. In nearly all cases only 
one mismatch repair heterodimer - either MLH1/PMS2 or 
MSH2/MSH6 - was affected. However, five cases showed a con-
current loss of MLH1/PMS2 and MSH6. Whereas some cases 
seem to be sporadic with a MLH1 promotor hypermethylation 
and/or BRAF V600E mutation, we also could detect potential 
germ line mutations. Importantly, next-generation sequencing 
indicates that the concurrent loss of MLH1/PMS2 and MSH6 
expression is associated with a dysregulation in DNA reparation 
as all of these cases showed additional mutations in genes cod-
ing for proteins like ATM, BRCA2, BARD1, CHEK1, FANCA, 
PALB2, RAD54L and RAD51D.
Conclusion: Our study suggests that the simultaneous loss of MLH1, 
PMS2 and MSH6 immunoexpression among different gastrointesti-
nal cancers is associated with and potentially even based on more 
widespread alterations in DNA repair processes. Next-generation 
sequencing could reveal further mutations in additional DNA repair-
related genes in the present cases. With the advent of drugs targeting 
DNA repair in clinical practice, especially PARP-inhibitors, and their 
potential indication extension for mutations other than BRCA1/2 such 
as PALB2 our results are of immediate clinical significance.

Intestinal spirochetosis: clinicopathological features of 22 year 
experience in a single institution

Amat, A. Cordoba
*Hospital Universitario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: Intestinal spirochetosis (IS) is an infre-
quent infection and its clinical significance in individual cases 
has remained unclear as their association with other diseases. We 
report the clinicopathological features of the patients diagnosed in 
our hospital in a 22 years experience.
Methods: Retrospective and descriptive study from the patients 
with a diagnosis of intestinal spirochetosis from 2000-2021 in We 
histologically reviewed paraffin-embedded section slides made 
from 2000 to 2021at Navarras University Hospital.
Clinical records were reviewed for each one of the patients for 
epidemiological features, treatment and follow up.
Results: We identified 29 cases of IS. Median age was 48 years 
old (25 - 76 years old). 79% were males. In 69% of the patients 
an endoscopic ultrasound was performed due to gastrointestinal 
symptoms.
The most common symptom was diarrhoea (44, 8%). 27, 6% of the 
patients were asymptomatic. 17,2% were in the colorectal cancer 
screening program.
48,3% of the patients were treated with antibiotic (metronidazole). 
24,1% of the patients were HIV positive.
Transverse colon was the most common localisation (37,9%), 
24,7% of the patients had more than one affected colonic segment.
Six patients (20,7%) had an associated polyp (3 tubular adenomas, 
2 hyperplastic polyps and one juvenile polyp).
Conclusion: Intestinal spirochetosis is more frequent in young 
population and in male homosexuals. It presents as a symptomatic 
disease in immunosupresed patients and is very rare symptomatic 
in other the population except in children. The most common symp-
tom is diarrhoea. Patients treated with antibiotics had a favourable 
outcome. The most common localisation was the transverse colon, 
but it can affect other colonic segments even in a discontinuous

Kansu, M. Toruner, B. Savas, A. Ensari
*Ankara University Medical School, Pathology Department, 
Turkey
Background & objectives: In inflammatory bowel disease(IBD), 
inflammatory crypt damage leads to shedding of epithelium, man-
ifesting as increased crypt epithelial apoptosis which is usually 
overlooked. Here, we focused on crypt epithelial apoptosis and 
other histopathologic features of colitis in paediatric and adult IBD.
Methods: Initial diagnostic biopsies containing at least five differ-
ent sites taken from adult(n=38) and paediatric(n=29) IBD cases 
were evaluated retrospectively. Histopathologic features of coli-
tis, cryptitis in terms of extent and location (basal/midzonal/full-
thickness), crypt abscesses (neutrophilic, mixed, apoptotic) and 
crypt epithelial apoptosis graded as (0:none,1:scattered, 2:count-
able, 3:uncountable) were evaluated in each biopsy. Statistical 
analysis was performed using Chi-square test and Spearman’s rank 
correlation.
Results: There were 29 paediatric cases(PC) comprising 20(69%) 
ulcerative colitis (UC), 9(31%) Crohn’s disease (CD) while 
there were 26 (68.4%) UC, 12 (31.6%) CD in 38 adults. Apop-
tosis (97%) was the most frequent feature present throughout the 
colon in all cases in both UC and CD followed by cryptitis (93%) 
and crypt abscesses (60%) the majority of which were apoptotic 
or mixed. Apoptosis was significantly more common and more 
severe in UC compared to CD in left colon (p=0.017). There was 
positive correlation between grade of apoptosis and full-thick-
ness cryptitis for left colon in PC (r=0.538,p=0.014), for right 
colon in adults (r=0.447,p=0.042) and for right colon in all cases 
(r=0.410,p=0,004).
Conclusion: Crypt epithelial apoptosis seems to be more common 
in UC compared to CD and is correlated with the extent of cryptitis 
in all age groups. These findings suggest that inflammatory damage 
to the crypt epithelium leads to apoptotic cell death in the active 
phase of the disease, since no correlation was found between the 
features of chronicity and apoptosis in our cohort. We believe that 
apoptosis may be an early sign of IBD, particularly when drugs 
are ruled out.

Heat artifact simulating serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma: 
systemic histological analysis of prophylactic fallopian tube 
resection specimens
M. Fukunaga*, N. Fukunaga
*Shin-Yurigaoka General Hospital, Japan
Background & objectives: Prophylactic fallopian tube resection 
has been prevailing. Among pathological changes in tubular speci-
mens, serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) is most impor-
tant for patient management, and heat artifacts simulating STIC 
should be acknowledged in order to avoid misdiagnosis.
Methods: One thousand consecutive cases of prophylactic fallopian 
tube resection by laparoscopic excision using an electronic 
knife our hospital between 2015-2020 were examined, and the 
characteristic morphology and incidence of heat artifacts were 
analysed. Two blocks of the distal fallopian tube were prepared 
for examination in each case. The cases were benign uterine and 
ovarian disorders.
Results: Heat artifacts were observed in 530 of 1000 cases (53%). 
Marked changes were found in 118 cases (11.8%), moderate 
changes in 102(10.2%) and minor changes in 250 cases (25%). 
Eight cases were initially diagnosed as STIC. No patient had STIC. 
Histological findings of heat artifacts included cellular pseudo-
stratification, a pronounced papillary arrangement and detachment 
of the epithelium from the connective tissue, mainly in the fim-
bria. Cytological changes included marked nuclear elongation and 
smudging, eosinophilic cytoplasm and obliteration of cell bound-
aries and lack of mitotic figures in the epithelial lining. These 
findings mimicked STIC. Immunostaining of p53, WT1 and Ki67 
performed on 33 representative cases did not indicate STIC.
Conclusion: Heat artifacts from electronic knife usage are not 
uncommon. The marked papillary pattern of the epithelium was 
the principal histological characteristic leading to confusion with 
STIC, likely resulting from the structural characteristics of the 
tubal fimbria. Heat applied to tissue can produce nuclear elon-
gation, hyperchromatism, smudging of nuclei, eosinophilic cyto-
plasm, and obliteration of cell boundaries. Awareness of this poten-
tial source of diagnostic error leads to its complete avoidance.

Intravenous leiomyomatosis of the uterus: a clinicopathological 
analysis of nine cases

him, S. Sassi, A. Chadli Debbiche
*Department of Pathology, Charles Nicolle Hospital Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVL) is a 
rare and benign smooth muscle neoplasm. It grows intravenously in 
the uterus and may invades cardiovascular and pulmonary system. 
The purpose of this study was to analyse clinicopathological data 
of 9 cases of IVL.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 9 patients treated for IVL 
and diagnosed at Pathology Department from 2008 to 2020. All 
patients underwent surgical treatment.
Results: Mean age of patients was 41.8 years (22-49 years). 
The 9 patients presented with no specific symptoms including 
menorrhagia (n=4), uterine mass (n=2), hypogastralgia (n=2) and 
dysuria (n=1). The diagnosis was made on myomectomy (n=5) 
and hysterectomy specimens (n=4). The diagnosis of IVL was 
suspected macroscopically in 4 cases by the presence of peripheral 
digitiform tabs or peripheral buds appearing to be endovascular. 
No intravenous leiomyomas were detected. Microscopically, all 
the cases showed a proliferation of benign smooth muscle within 
the vessels. Rare mitoses were noticed. Three patients were lost 
to follow-up. Six patients who were followed up are still alive and 
experienced no recurrence after a follow-up of 60months.
Conclusion: IVL can be easily misdiagnosed as symptoms are 
not suggestive clinically and it can mimic uterine leiomyoma. 
Radiologists should make an early detection of IVL when there 
is venous blood flow signals in fissure-like echoe. Hysterectomy 
is the treatment and myomectomy could be considered when there 
is fertility needs. Pathologists should perform careful sampling 
insisting in the surrounding uterine smooth muscle. IVL is yet a 
benign disease but is considered malignant due to its recurrency. 
Long-term follow-ups are crucial.

sity and General University Hospital in Prague, Czech Republic
Background & objectives: Expression of neuroendocrine markers 
in primary ovarian tumours without neuroendocrine morphology 
has only rarely been evaluated and data on its extent is limited. We 
have analysed neuroendocrine markers expression in tumours lack-
ing neuroendocrine features and assessed its prognostic meaning.
Methods: The cohort consisted of 556 primary ovarian tumours, 
including serous borderline tumours (mSBT; 42), low grade serous 
carcinomas (LGSC; 100), high grade serous carcinomas (HGSC; 
114), clear cell carcinomas (OCCC; 124), endometroid carcinomas 
(EOC; 52), mucinous borderline tumours (MBT; 80) and muci-
nous carcinomas (MC; 44). Immunohistochemical analysis was 
performed using TMA approach with antibodies against synapto-
physin, chromogranin, CD56, and INSM1.
Results: The highest number of positive cases was observed in 
mucinous tumours and INSM1 marker (60/124; 48%), where the 
MBT and MC subgroups had similar proportions of positivity 
(MBT - 42/80; 53% vs. MC – 18/44; 41%). Mucinous tumours 
also showed the highest expression of synaptophysin (32/124; 26%) 
and chromogranin (51/124; 41%). In other tumour types, only weak 
or no expression of neuroendocrine markers was detected, except 
for HGSC, which showed the highest expression of CD56 (30/114; 
26%). The data was statistically processed concerning the extent of 
neuroendocrine marker expression, and its association with clin-
icopathologic data was also investigated. Survival analyses showed 
that neuroendocrine markers have no prognostic significance.
Conclusion: This study examines the expression of neuroendocrine 
markers in primary ovarian tumours of non-neuroendocrine 
morphology, with a special focus on providing a comprehensive 
overview of the staining characteristics of individual tumour types, 
and the possible significance the expression of these markers 
could have for differential diagnosis. In terms of patient survival 
outcomes, the immunohistochemical expression of neuroendocrine 
markers seems to be of no clinical significance.

University of Thrace, Alexadroupolis, Greece
Background & objectives: NLRP3 belongs to the inflammasome 
family, an innate immune system complex. Recent studies have 
shown its role in the development of different malignancies. We 
aimed to investigate the NLRP3 expression in endometrial carci-
noma and to correlate it with clinicohistopathological parameters.
Methods: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded endometrial 
tissues from 46 samples were studied. 36 of them diagnosed with 
endometrial cancer (study group) and the other 10 (control group) 
came from total hysterectomies due to uterine prolapse. NLRP3’s 
expression was investigated immunohistochemically using a 
monoclonal anti-NLRP3 antibody and was also correlated with 
clinicohistopathological parameters.
Results: NLRP3 has been found to be expressed in endometrial 
tumour samples more frequently compared to control group. 
There was a statistically significant correlation between NLRP3 
expression and patient’s age (p=0,009), degree of differentia-
tion (p<0,001), stage of cancer (p<0,001), histological type and 
tumour depth (p<0,001). At the same time a decreased probability 
of survival (p=0,0003) and an increased mortality rate were clearly 
observed in samples with high NLRP3 expression (p<0,001).
Conclusion: Our research demonstrated that an overexpression 
of NLRP3 in endometrial malignancy can accelerate to advanced 
stage and tumour depth, resulting in poor prognosis and short sur-
vival. Although, more studies need to be performed to establish 
these results, as NLRP3 may be a useful diagnostic -prognostic 
factor or a therapeutic target in endometrial carcinoma.

Civils de Lyon, Pierre Bénite, France
Background & objectives: This study investigates genomic altera-
tions in a series of 4 malignant struma ovarii (SO), including 2 
Highly Differenciated Follicular Carcinoma of the Ovary(HDFCO) 
with their corresponding peritoneal implants, using nucleic acid 
sequencing to assess possible molecular profiles predicting clini-
cal behaviour.
Methods: For each case, one representative block from ovarian 
tumour and one from peritoneal spread were selected. Genomic 
DNA was sequenced using high throughput sequencing on Illumina 
sequencer. RNA library preparation was performed following the 
Archer Fusion-Plex Protocol for Illumina. An in-house panel was 
used for NGS and RNA-Seq, targeting respectively 87 and 171 
major oncogenes and deregulated tumour suppressor genes.
Results: In two cases, ovarian tumour was follicular variant of 
papillary carcinoma (FV-PTC) with BRAF G469A for one case 
and NRAS Q61K mutation for the second case. Peritoneal implants 
were histologically benign-looking and showed respectively BRAF 
G469A and no mutation.
The third case was composed of a histologically benign struma 
ovarii in the ovary. Recurrences included a benign struma ovarii 
on the contralateral ovary, with a TERT promoter deletion, and a 
benign-looking peritoneal implant without any mutation.
Last case was a histologically benign struma ovarii in the ovary 
with a peritoneal implant classified as follicular carcinoma and 
carrying NRAS Q61R mutation. Molecular analysis failed on the 
ovary.
Conclusion: This study shows that despite being benign-looking, 
peritoneal implants of struma ovarii can carry classical mutations 
of thyroid-type cancer: similar mutation to the initial histologically 
malignant struma ovarii or a novel one. Still, 2 out of 4 peritoneal 
implants of our series are not mutated.

pathogenesis of many malignancies and has been reported to influ-
ence response to anti PD-L1 targeted therapy.
Methods: Expression of PD-L1 and MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and 
PMS2 was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 50 resected 
cases of epithelial ovarian carcinomas (EOCs).
Results: Mismatch repair deficiency was noted in 15 cases (30% 
of the cases). PD-L1 expression was noted in 20% of the cases 
(10 cases) in tumour cells and in 14% of the cases (7 cases) 
in the tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). A statistically 
significant inverse correlation was noted between PD-L1 expres-
sion in TILs and PD-L1 expression in tumour cells with extra-
ovarian spread of tumour, and between TILs and lymphovascu-
lar invasion. There was no statistically significant association 
between MMR deficiency and PD-L1 expression in tumour cells 
or PD-L1 expression in TILs.
Conclusion: Approximately one third cases of EOCs showed MMR 
deficiency and PD-L1 expression was noted in only one sixth to 
one fifth of the cases. There was no statistically significant asso-
ciation between MMR deficiency and PD-L1 expression in the 
current study. However, more studies on a larger sample size are 
required to study relation between MMR status and PD-L1 expres-
sion in EOCs.

and Perinatology named after Academician V.I. Kulakov, Russia
Background & objectives: The balance of apoptosis and pro-
liferation plays an important role in maintaining pregnancy. 
The aim: to study Oct-4, Bax and Bcl-2 expression in the 
uterus during spontaneous and immune-dependent abortions 
in mice.
Methods: 18 mice formed three identical groups. Сontrol-♀CBA/
Lacx♂BALB/c, spontaneous abortions(SA)-♀CBA/Lacx♂DBA/2J; 
immune-dependent abortions(IDA)-♀CBA/Lacx♂BALB/c with 
intraperitoneal administration of β-heptyl glycoside muramyl 
dipeptide in dose of ≈1 mg/kg on days 5 and 7 of gestation (DG). 
Mice were taken out of the experiment on the 8 DG. The uterus 
were excised and immunohistochemically stained with antibodies 
to Bax(Δ21), Bcl-2, Oct-4.
Results: The level of embryos resorption in control was 
12.5%, in SA- 34.8%, in IDA- 46.7%. Bax(Δ21) expression 
was detected in the decidua. Staining intensity varied from 
weak to moderate in control and from moderate to strong in 
SA and IDA. Bcl-2 was localized in the stromal part of the 
endometrium in control (intensity staining) and in IDA group 
(very weak staining), but no staining in SA. Oct4+ cells with 
nuclear or cytoplasmic staining are localized in the myome-
trium and perimetrium. The percentage of Oct-4+ nuclei in 
SA and IDA groups was less than in the control, with negative 
correlation between Oct-4+ nuclear staining and the level of 
embryo resorption (r=-0.99,95CI(-0.99;-0.88);p=0.0003)
Conclusion: Thus, the negative correlation between the level of 
embryo resorption and the percentage of Oct-4+ cells in the myo-
metrium and perimetrium in SA and IDA is probably due to an 
insufficient increase in the volume of the fetoplacental unit under 
conditions of enhanced apoptosis.

and Perinatology named after Academician V.I. Kulakov, Russia
Background & objectives: The mechanism of cesarean scar defect 
development is unclarified. Treatment of that complication is an 
important obstetric task. We assessed the effect of the conditioned 
medium obtained by culturing mesenchymal stem cells with low 
oxygen content (10%) on uterine healing.
Methods: Component from MSCs was used to treat uterine wound 
of Sprague Dawley rats (treated group=15, without treatment=11). 
Histologic examination was performed 5 and 15 days after surgi-
cal operation with Mallory staining and monoclonal antibodies 
to aSMA and CD34. The healing area between damage myome-
trium and the area of the blood vessels in the healing zone were 
calculated.
Results: By the 5th day, there was a complete closure of the uterine 
wall. The area between the separated muscle layers in the treated 
group was (p<0.05) smaller compared to the control in 5 (p<0.05) 
and 15 (p<0.05) days. In the control group, the healing area from 
the 5th to the 15th day increased unreliable (p>0.05). The area of 
the vessels in the healing zone of treated group was significantly 
lower compared to control in 5 (p<0.05) and 15 days (p<0.05). 
Blood vessel area of treated group decreased to 15th day in damage 
myometrium zone (p<0.05) but not damage perimetrium.
Conclusion: Protein composition obtained by culturing the cells under 
a reduced content of O2 (10%), significantly influences on size and 
vascularization of healing area between damage myometrium and peri-
metrium in uterine wall after full-thickness surgical incision. Area of 
connective tissue and fibrosis in healing uterine wall after treating the 
composition decreased that seems to improve uterine wall healing.

*National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynaecology 
and Perinatology named after Academician V.I. Kulakov, Russia
Background & objectives: It`s known that angiogenesis with 
vascular branching failure is characteristic of chronic intrauterine 
hypoxia. The aim was to assess the morphological features of the 
placenta in women with SARS-CoV-2+ infection, children whom 
have suffered from acute hypoxia in labour.
Methods: The main group of the study was women with positive 
test of SARS-CoV-2 gave birth to a live born children (n=42), 
and control group (n=40) with negative test to SARS-CoV-2. We 
performed histological(H&E staining) and immunohistochemical 
study on the placenta with antibodies to CD34.
Results: It was revealed that in 8.3% there was acute foetal hypoxia 
in second stage of the labour, which required operative delivery. We 
observed a higher percentage of infarctions, the presence of throm-
bosis of the chorionic vessels, intervillous and subamniotic hema-
tomas in the main study group as compared to the control group 
(p<0,05). Histological examination revealed angiogenesis with a 
predominance of vascular branching (more than 10 blood vessels in 
one terminal villus, comparison 3-7 as normally) (p<0,05). Intrau-
terine hypoxia and depletion of compensation mechanisms, even 
with even week exposure (uterine contractile activity, umbilical

cord compression, and others), there is a breakdown of adaptation 
mechanisms and the development of acute foetal hypoxia.
Conclusion: Thus, in physiological conditions, the compensatory 
capabilities of the placenta provide a high degree of resistance of 
the mother-placenta-foetus system to acute oxygen deficiency. The 
development of clinically foetal hypoxia during labour in most 
cases is due to morpho-functional disorders of the placenta that 
formed in the antenatal period.

Apostolaki, K. Kulangara
*Agilent Technologies, USA
Background & objectives: PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx is a quali-
tative immunohistochemical assay being developed to detect PD-L1 
expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) cervical 
cancer tissue. We report analytical studies using PD-L1 IHC 22C3 
pharmDx in cervical cancer specimens.
Methods: Blinded and randomized studies were performed 
on FFPE cervical specimens, including adenocarcinoma and 
squamous cell carcinoma. Studies included Sensitivity of PD-L1 
IHC 22C3 pharmDx, Inter and Intra-Observer Scoring Precision 
and Combined Testing Precision (Inter-instrument/Inter-operator/
Inter-day) using PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx. Positive/negative 
status was applied to scores using the Combined Positive Score 
(CPS) and binary diagnostic cutoff of CPS ≥1.
Results: A statistical analysis was performed to calculate Negative 
Percent Agreement (NPA), Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and 
Overall Agreement (OA) with corresponding confidence intervals 
(CI). The acceptance criteria (AC) for precision studies were set 
such that the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI computed on 
percent agreement must meet or exceed 85%.
Sensitivity of the assay was 68.5% in 130 specimens scored as CPS 
≥1. Inter and Intra-Observer Precision on 50 specimens met AC for 
NPA (98.6%/97.7%), PPA (96.2%/97.8%) and OA (97.6%/98.2%), 
respectively. Combined Precision results for 36 specimens met AC 
for NPA (93.2%), PPA (90.2%) and OA (95.2%)
Conclusion: These studies demonstrated consistent and highly 
reproducible results using PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx in analytical 
studies for sensitivity and precision in cervical cancer specimens.

Number of FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells are associated with 
recurrence in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma
D. Arık*, T. Benli, E. Telli
*Eskişehir Osmangazi University, Turkey
Background & objectives: FoxP3+ Tregs suppress anti-tumour 
immune responses and contribute to the escape of tumour cells 
from the immune system. We evaluated FoxP3+ lymphocyte infil-
tration in tumour stroma and tumour cell islands separately in vul-
var squamous cell carcinoma.
Methods: Cases diagnosed with vulvar SCC in our department 
between 2005 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. The paraffin 
blocks were selected, and immunohistochemical studies were 
performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell 
counts were made in areas with the highest concentration of FoxP3 
positive lymphocytes. Positive cells detected in tumour stroma and 
within tumoral cell groups were counted separately
Results: We found a positive correlation between high FoxP3+ 
lymphocyte count and good prognostic parameters. There was less 
recurrence in the group with high FoxP3+ lymphocyte counts in 
tumoral cell islands. Overall survival was not statistically different 
between these groups. Less lymphovascular invasion was observed 
in the group with high lymphocyte count in the tumour stroma.
Conclusion: Tumour-infiltrating FoxP3+ Tregs not only influence 
tumour progression and clinical course of disease, but may also 
determine immunotherapy response. In vulvar SCC, FoxP3+ Treg 
infiltration into the tumour stroma and into tumoral cell islands is 
associated with good prognostic features. In these tumours, stage 
appeared as the only independent prognostic parameter. Studies 
to be conducted in larger series may reveal whether Tregs can be 
targeted in cancer treatment.

Diagnostic value of immunohistochemical staining in fumarate 
hydratase-deficient leiomyoma
A. Magnaeva*, A. Asaturova, A. Tregubova
*National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynaecology 
and Perinatology named after Academician V.I.Kulakov, Russia
Background & objectives: Fumarate hydratase-deficient (dFH) 
leiomyoma is a subtype of leiomyoma, that can be misclassified 
as atypical one due to a similar morphology. Consequently, we 
aimed to identify dFH leiomyoma, previously diagnosed as atypical 
leiomyoma with the help of immunohistochemical (IHC) staining.
Methods: Samples of 24 patients with atypical leiomyoma, who 
had been provided operation at the Research Center for Obstet-
rics, Gynaecology and Perinatology (Moscow, Russia) during the 
years 2016-2021, were recruited. Slides were analysed for special 
features suggesting dFH leiomyomas, as well as fumarase IHC 
staining was performed with controls. Statistical significance was 
analysed using Fisher’s test and Kruskal Wallis test.
Results: From the obtained data, it is apparent that of these 24 
tumours, 42% were found to be deficient for FH. There were sig-
nificant differences between patients’ age (Me=31 years in dFH 
leiomyoma and Me=40 years in atypical leiomyoma, p < 0,05). 
There was also a significant positive correlation between hyaline 
globules and FH deficiency (p < 0,05), as well as severe nuclear 
atypia and FH deficiency (p < 0,05). At the same time, statistical 
tests did not show any significant differences of prominent nucle-
oli, perinuclear halo, staghorn vessels, and alveolar-part oedema 
between dFH leiomyomas and atypical ones.
Conclusion: This study has shown that diagnosis of dFH leio-
myoma has potentially low reproducibility among pathologists due 
to the low correlation between histologic features and IHC results. 
Our findings suggest that the most representative morphologic 
appearance is only hyaline globules. Consequently, similar histo-
logic features of two leiomyoma subtypes suggest to provide a dif-
ferential diagnosis with the help of IHC staining. Besides, fumarate 
hydratase-deficient staining is of clinical importance in revealing a 
group of young patients for genetic counselling to exclude HLRCC.

we compiled the clinicopathologic features of cases diagnosed with 
endometriosis within a year in our department.
Methods: The biopsy materials evaluated in our clinic in 2021 
were retrospectively analysed. Clinicopathologic data, in terms of 
age, localization, recurrence, operation type, comorbidity, parity 
were gathered. Gynaecological and non-gynaecological materials 
were classified. Type of the comorbidity were listed.
Results: There were 78 materials of 70 cases. The mean age of the 
patients was 39 years. Recurrence was seen in 4 patients. The most 
common pelvic location was ovary. Vaginal cuff involvement was 
observed in only 1 case. Eight cases were located in the extrapelvic 
region. 13 patients had multifocal disease and 4 patients had atypi-
cal endometriosis. There were ovarian neoplastic lesions accom-
panying ovarian endometriosis in eight cases. Endometrioid carci-
noma of the uterine cavity was present in 3 cases. Benign uterine 
lesions such as adenomyosis, adenomyotic nodule and leiomyoma 
uteri were present in 34 cases.
Conclusion: As a result, 5,7% of the cases were recurrent. Endo-
metriosis associated carcinomas accompanied 2,9% of the cases, 
and 5,7% of the cases were diagnosed with atypical endometriosis, 
which is accepted as precursor of the endometriosis associated 
carcinomas. 92,8% of the cases presented in pelvic location, and 
multifocal disease at diagnosis occurred in 18,5% of the patients. 
Careful microscopic examination, detection of multifocal dis-
ease, and identification of accompanying neoplastic lesions will 
enable endometriosis cases to be correctly diagnosed and treated 
appropriately.

Trend analysis as a quality measurement for biomarkers - mis-
match repair application
A. Plotkin*
*Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre; University of Toronto, 
Canada
Background & objectives: Universal screening of endometrial 
cancer (EC) for Lynch syndrome using mismatch repair (MMR) 
immunohistochemistry is becoming standard of care in many 
countries. We defined MMR-deficiency (MMRd) rates in EC and 
examined steadiness over time to identify trends and benchmark 
measurements.
Methods: Pathology reports of EC biopsy and curettage (2018-
2021) and MMR immunohistochemical biomarker reports from 
Life Labs, Canada were audited. Two-sided logistic regression 
was used for sample size analysis and generalized linear models 
were used for trend analysis. 60 patients quarterly were identified 
as minimum case volume by sample size calculations required to 
establish benchmarks for testing proficiency (P≤0.05, 80% power).
Results: Our cohort reached case volume ≥60 cases starting 
from the fourth quarter of 2019, thus meeting this requirement. 
The 1181 ECs included in the study were classified into MMR-d 
(n=313, 26.5%) or proficient (n=868, 73.5%). MMRd was highest 
in high-grade and mixed EC that included endometrioid EC (EEC, 
n=34/63, 54%) compared to low-grade EEC (n=256/919, 28%) 
and high-grade non-EEC (n=23/209, 11%), P<0.001. Proportion 
of MLH1/PMS2 loss was 22.1% (95% CI: 19.8-24.6%), MSH2/
MSH6 1.8% (95% CI: 1.1-2.7%), MSH6 2.2% (95% CI: 1.4-3.2%) 
and PMS2 0.8% (95% CI: 0.3-1.4%). For each protein, the pro-
portion of MMRd cases was quarterly steady over the entire time 
period (P>0.05).
Conclusion: Large laboratories may have the minimum volume 
to establish benchmarks for internal MMR immunohistochemistry 
quality control, and follow up trends over time, but this volume is 
not attainable for smaller laboratories. This study underscores the 
importance of trend analysis and the need to ensure that patholo-
gists have sufficient expertise in biomarkers reporting.

Tabeeva, A. Tregubova, L. Ezhova, V. Bozenko
*National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynaecology 
and Perinatology named after Academician V.I.Kulakov, Russia
Background & objectives: Expression alterations of oestrogen 
and progesterone receptors as well as follicle-stimulating and 
luteinizing hormone receptors lead to a number of reproductive 
issues. Therefore, understanding the physiological features of their 
expression and topical distribution is important for a endometrium 
comprehensive assessment.
Methods: Endometrial tissue samples of 7 healthy females, who 
participated in IVF programs at the Research Center for Obstet-
rics, Gynaecology and Perinatology (Moscow, Russia) due to male 
infertility were recruited. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry was 
used for Q-score evaluation of ER, PR, FSHR, and LHR expres-
sion levels during menstrual cycle in endometrial glands, stoma, 
endotheliocytes, and macrophages.
Results: The increased immunoreactivity of ER, PR, FSHR, and 
LGHR in the endometrial glands and stroma was initiated at the 
stage of early proliferation and reached its maximum level at the 
stage of late proliferation. Then, the expression of ER in the glands 
and stroma decreased during the early and middle stages of secre-
tion, the immunoreactivity of PR in the stroma persists throughout 
the all stage of secretion, increased immunoreactivity of FSHR 
and LGHR in each component of the endometrium was observed 
in all secretion stages.
Conclusion: It was shown that there is a connection between 
studied receptors immunoreactivity and endometrial structural 
features during menstrual cycle. Increased ER, PR, FSHR and 
LGHR expression in proliferative phase occurs according to 
endometrial growth, while increased PR, FSHR and LGHR 
expression in secretory phase is associated with endometrial 
decidual transformation and optimal condition for embrio 
implantation in case of pregnancy.

Background & objectives: Increasing evidence points to 
COL11A1 as a poor prognosis biomarker in several malignancies 
but not yet in EC. We aim to investigate the role of COL11A1 as a 
biomarker in EC and to study their relationship with epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition-related genes.
Methods: We included 82 tissue biopsies from patients with a his-
tological diagnosis of EC who underwent surgery at our institution 
(2014-2017). For normalization purposes, a control group con-
sisted of endometrial tissues from 16 non-cancer hysterectomized

patients. Tissue specimens were obtained at surgery. Expression 
of genes of interest was assessed by RT-qPCR. Statistical analyses 
were performed with R (v.4.0.3) software.
Results: Results from the TCGA cohort (n=232) demonstrated 
that COL11A1 expression significantly associates (p<0.05) with 
that of cancer-related extracellular proteoglycans (VCAN), EMT 
triggers (POSTN), EMT-inducing transcription factors, (SNAI1, 
SNAI2, ZEB1) and mesenchymal markers (FN1). One step further, 
we developed an EMT-based prognostic algorithm:
(SNAI1x0.0984) + (COL11A1x0.5535) + (CDH2x0.0297) + 
(FN1x0.0008) + (VIMx-0.0014)
COLL11A1 predominantly contributes to the EMT-score model.
Further analyses by RT-qPCR on a validation cohort (n=82) deter-
mined that COL11A1 expression is significantly elevated in Type 2 
vs Type 1 EC (p=0.006), G2-G3 vs G1 EC (p=0.011 and p=0.025), 
metastasis (p=0.043), progression (p=0.017), relapse (p=0.034) 
and EC-related exitus (p=0.007). Additionally, we obtained the 
same results with the EMT-score.
Conclusion: In light of these results and in agreement with the 
literature, it seems that diverse EMT biomarkers have prognostic 
connotations in different types of tumours. We have found that, in 
EC, COLL11A1 is related to EMT markers and tumours expressing 
COLL11A1 are usually more aggressive. Currently, these results 
are being validated by immunohistochemical staining.

*Pathology Unit, University of Bologna Medical Center, Italy
Background & objectives: Mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma 
(MLA) of the ovary is a rare malignant tumour of the female gen-
ital tract. In this study, we investigated the clinicopathological, 
immunohistochemical, and molecular features of 9 ovarian MLAs.
Methods: Clinical data and history were extracted from the 
patient’s medical records (from January 2019 to December 2021). 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and targeted Next-Generation 
sequencing analysis were performed.
Results: MLA accounted for 1.9% of cases (9/269). In 6 cases, 
MLA was associated with coexisting ovarian lesions: seromucinous 
borderline tumour (3), polypoid endometriosis (1), endometrioid 
carcinoma (2). Synchronous endometrial MLA was found in 2 cases. 
Diffuse endometriosis was present in all cases. Microscopically, 
tumours showed varying proportions of architectural patterns: glan-
dular 9/9; papillary 7/9; glomeruloid 8/9; sex cord-like 7/9; solid 
5/9; and spindle cell 6/9. All cases were positive for PAX8 and 
GATA3 with heterogeneous expression of CD10 and TTF1. MMR 
proteins were preserved in all cases. NGS analysis revealed patho-
genic variants of KRAS in 8 cases and BRAF in 1 case. Mutations 
in TP53, POLE, BRCA1/2 were not identified.
Conclusion: In our study, 8 patients presented with advanced dis-
ease, and in 2 cases early disease recurrence was observed after 
chemotherapy treatment. MLA represents a rare and novel histo-
type of ovarian carcinoma with distinct pathologic, immunohisto-
chemical and molecular features and it can be added to the list of 
endometriosis-associated ovarian neoplasms. In consideration of 
the propensity for recurrence/metastasis MLA may be considered 
a potentially aggressive histotype despite its apparent low-grade 
morphology.

Neuroendocrine neoplasms of the female genital tract: correla-
tion of molecular, immunohistochemical and clinical features 
in 24 cases
M. Testa*, C. Amaglio, R. Maragliano, E. Leoni, F. Sessa, D. Fur-
lan, S. Uccella
*Pathology Unit, Dept. of Medicine and Surgery, University of 
Insubria, Varese, Italy
Background & objectives: Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are 
uncommon in the female genital tract. Due to their rarity, little is 
known about them. Aim of this study is to correlate their molecular 
and immunohistochemical features with clinical data and to inves-
tigate their prognostic value.
Methods: The electronic medical record of our Pathology Insti-
tute was utilized to identify women diagnosed with gynaecological 
NENs from 1983 to 2019. All cases underwent histological and 
immunohistochemical review. Patients’ clinical, demographic and 
treatment characteristics were searched. Molecular analyses were 
performed (including Next-generation Sequencing, real-time PCR, 
microsatellite instability evaluation). The association between 
tumour histology and survival was examined using Kaplan-Meier 
analyses.
Results: A total of 24 cases were identified. 42% of the NENs 
were cervical, 25% endometrial and 33% ovarian. Median age was 
62 years (range 39–78 years), with site-specific differences. Only 
high-grade NENs were retrieved on cervix and endometrium: 1 
Neuroendocrine-tumour (NET) G3, 8 Neuroendocrine-carcinomas 
(NECs) and 7 Mixed-Neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine-neo-
plasms (MiNENs), whereas the most common histological subtype 
in ovary was NET. 20/22 cases (91%) expressed Chromogranin-A 
and/or Synaptophysin and 17/23 cases (74%) expressed INSM1. 
Most of the cases didn’t show immunoreactivity for site-specific 
antibodies. HPV-infection and concomitant p16 overexpression was 
found in 8 cervical and 2 endometrial cases. 4 cases had altered 
immunohistochemical expression of DNA-mismatch-repair-pro-
teins and associated microsatellite instability (MSI).
Conclusion: Gynaecological NENs represent a rare tumour 
entity and constitute a diagnostic challenge. They usually 
show immunoreactivity for traditional neuroendocrine markers 
(Chromogranin-A and Synaptophysin), but we recommend caution 
in INSM1 reliability, since it showed a minor sensitivity in our 
study; NENs resulted mainly negative for site-specific markers, 
therefore they cannot be used to rule out metastases. Limited data 
regarding gynaecological NENs pathogenesis are available; our 
study highlighted NENs might follow site-specific molecular 
pathways, like HPV-related infection, or NEN-specific pathways, 
like MSI.

Background & objectives: This study aims to investigate the 
influence of β-catenin on endometrial cancer progression. Cur-
rently the molecular subgrouping of EC proposed by the TCGA 
is a milestone. Furthermore, the driving mechanisms are vital to 
identify correlations between genes and their regulators.
Methods: A total of 103 White female patients with con-
firmed EC were enrolled. For the analysis, we used next-
generation sequencing with Hot Spot Cancer Panel provided 
by Illumina Inc, San Diego, California, USA, and immuno-
histochemical analysis FOXA-1, FOXP1, oestrogen receptor, 
and β-catenin.
Results: Beta-catenin showed a correlation with AKT1 mutation 
(R = 0,2508 p = 0,04058 and surprisingly not with CTNNB1 muta-
tion R = 0.5176 p = 0,000007). Moreover, beta-catenin expression 
was observed in TNM R = 0.2209, p = 0.0263, with prognostic 
impact RFS (R = 0,2049 p = 0,0388). Indirectly, the worse clinical 
outcome was observed in obese patients with beta-catenin expres-
sion (BMI R = 0.1931 p = 0.0510).
Conclusion: The study suggests a prognostic value of Β-catenin 
in EC. Our study confirmed that beta-catenin is a reliable 
biomarker in the prognosis of EC outcomes. It indicates that 
β-catenin can be used as a biomarker for the prognosis of patients 
with malignant cancers. Furthermore, there is no implementa-
tion of classification by molecular basis. Based on this medical 
research it is necessary to use biomarkers such as beta catenin in 
the prognosis of endometrial cancer.

Histopathological features of placentas of mothers who have 
had COVID19 infection during pregnancy
N. Yeldir*, G. Sönmez Ünal, H. Özer
*Sivas Cumhuriyet University, Turkey
Background & objectives: The COVID19 pandemic has been 
affecting the worldwide since 2020.The SarsCov2 can cause 
changes in many tissues. The aim is to investigate changes that 
occur in the placentas of women who have had COVID19 infection 
during any period of their pregnancy.
Methods: The study was performed prospectively with 24 women 
who had COVID19 infection at any period of their pregnancy and 
gave birth by cesarean section or vaginal. The data of the patients 
were evaluated for clinical, the pregnancy period of COVID19 
infection and placental histopathological features.
Results: In 24 cases, the mean age was 28 years and the mean 
birth week of cases was 38th week.10 cases were vaccinated 
with two doses, others were unvaccinated. 3 cases were in 
the period of active covid infection and the mean week of 
COVID19 infection of other cases was 22th week. In histo-
pathological examinations, calcifications, congestive chorionic 
villis, intervillous haemorrhages and increase in focal syncytial 
knots were common findings. Focal distal villous hypoplasia, 
hofbauer cells and focal hydropic villis were observed less. 
There are fibromuscular stenosis in 3 cases and marked distal 
villous hypoplasia in 2 cases.
Conclusion: It is believed that the SarsCov2 virus can cause 
pregnancy complications such as foetal malformations, foe-
tal growth retardation and stillbirth. Placental abnormalities 
including foetal and maternal vascular malperfusion have been 
reported despite negative SarsCov2 tests of infants of moth-
ers who had COVID19 infection during pregnancy. According 
to this study, COVID19 infection caused significant maternal 
vascular malperfusion findings in a few cases, although it did 
not cause significant histopathological changes of the placenta 
in many cases.

cology and Perinatology named after Academician V.I.Kulakov»,

Background & objectives: Apoptosis is characterized by a series 
of perturbations to the cellular architecture that contribute to cell 
death. This process involved in the pathogenesis of gynaecologi-
cal diseases associated with chronic inflammation such as chronic 
endometritis and endometriosis.
Methods: The immunohistochemical expression of apoptotic markers 
Caspase-8 and Bcl-2 was evaluated in 50 patients divided into 3 groups: 
group 1 (normal endometrium, n=7), group 2 (chronic endometritis, 
n=20), group 3 (endometriosis, n=23). QuPath software was used to 
assess the level immunohistochemical staining intensity (optical density 
(OD) of staining). We used Kruskal-Walli’s test for statistical analysis.
Results: Expression of Caspase-8 in stromal and glandular cells of 
eutopic endometrium samples was significantly different across the 
three groups (p=0,016 and p=0,004 respectively). OD of gland cells in 
the first group: Me=0.113 (Q1-Q3: 0.086-0.119), second: Me=0.314 
(Q1-Q3: 0.106-0.445), third: Me=0.101 (Q1-Q3: 0.09-0.142). OD of 
stromal cells in the first group: Me=0.057 (Q1-Q3: 0.05-0.06), second: 
0.133 (Q1-Q3: 0.07-0.218), third: Me=0.056 (Q1-Q3: 0.05-0.06). Bcl-
2expression in glandular cells of eutopic endometrium samples was sig-
nificantly different across the three groups (p=0,004). OD of gland cells 
in the first group: Me=0.113 (Q1-Q3: 0.086-0.119), second: Me=0.314 
(Q1-Q3: 0.106-0.445), third: Me=0.101 (Q1-Q3: 0.09-0.142).
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that there is an increase the 
activity of caspases-8 in stromal and glandular endometrial cells as 
well as an activity bcl-2 in glandular cells in chronic endometritis 
to compare with endometriosis and normal samples. These results 
might help to shed more light on the role of apoptosis in gynaeco-
logical disease associated with chronic inflammation.

Mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma of the endometrium fre-
quently associated with KRAS mutation and adenomyosis
Y. Chun*, Y.M. Kim, Y. Kim
*Guro Hospital Korea University, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma (MLA), 
a rare subtype of endometrial carcinomas with aggressive behaviours, is 
histologically similar to the cervical mesonephric adenocarcinoma, but 
not associated with mesonephric remnants. It remains unclear whether 
the MLAs represent mesonephric origin or Müllerian neoplasm.
Methods: We studied the clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical 
and molecular features of 6 endometrial MLAs and 1 endometrial 
carcinoma with mixed mesonephric-like and endometrioid patterns.
Results: Four cases had initially been diagnosed as low-grade endo-
metrioid endometrial adenocarcinomas. Histologically, MLAs showed 
a variety of morphologies including tubular, ductal, papillary, retiform, 
and solid. Five cases (71%) were associated with adenomyosis. All 
tumours showed negativity for ER and PR, p53 wild type and retained 
staining for the mismatch repair proteins. Most cases revealed posi-
tivity for GATA-3 (5/6), CD10 (6/7) and TTF-1 (5/6). Next genera-
tion sequencing documented mutations in KRAS (4/4), PIK3CA (1/4), 
ARID1A (1/4) and ERBB3 (1/4). One case showed copy number vari-
ations in MDM4 and AKT3. Two patients were in FIGO stage lll, 1 in 
stage IV and 4 in stage I-II. Three patients developed lung metastasis.

Conclusion: As MLAs demonstrate varied architectural patterns, 
it often could lead to misdiagnosis, especially on a small biopsy 
specimen. Endometrial MLA represents a distinct subtype of endo-
metrial carcinomas associated with KRAS-mutations and charac-
teristic immunohistochemical findings. Clinically, MLAs show an 
aggressive behaviour with a substantial risk for lung metastasis. 
Frequent association with adenomyosis, no mesonephric remnant, 
and mutations in PIK3CA and ARID1A suggest a Müllerian origin 
of the endometrial MLAs.

HPV-positive status and p53 alterations are associated with 
improved disease-free survival in patients with vulvar squa-
mous cell carcinoma

islova, I. Trias, I. Ribera-Cortada, S. Alos, R. López del Campo,

*Hospital Clínic Barcelona, Spain
Background & objectives: Three clinically distinct subtypes of 
vulvar squamous cell carcinomas (VSCC) have been described on 
the basis of human papillomavirus (HPV) status and p53 altera-
tions. HPV-positive and p53 wild-type status have been reported to 
confer better disease-free survival and overall survival.
Methods: 193 surgically treated from 1975 to 2021 in a single 
institution in Spain were included. Median follow-up was 69 months 
(range 1–285). p53 was determined by immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) and HPV by p16 IHC. We assessed the survival of the 
patients stratified in three groups (HPV-positive, HPV-negative/
p53 mutant and HPV-negative/p53 wild-type). Correlations with 
outcome were analysed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves.
Results: 35 patients (18.1%) had HPV-positive VSCC, 137 
(70.9%) HPV-negative/p53 IHC abnormal and 21 (10.8%) HPV-
negative/p53 wild-type carcinomas. Age at diagnosis of women 
with HPV-positive tumours was lower than those with HPV-
negative/p53 abnormal and HPV-negative/p53 wild-type VSCC 
(median 62 years vs. 76 and 77 years, respectively, p=0.06). 
Patients with HPV-positive tumours showed lower rates of 
relapse than those with HPV-negative carcinomas (p<0.01). 
Remarkably, among women with HPV-negative VSCCs, patients 
with p53 abnormal IHC staining showed lower rates of relapse 
than those with p53 wild-type IHC (p=0.01). However, no 
differences in disease-specific survival or in FIGO stage (initial 
vs advanced) were identified among the three groups (p=0.40 
and 0.37, respectively).
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that patients with HPV-positive 
VSCC, as well as patients with HPV-negative carcinomas with 
p53 abnormal IHC staining show improved disease-free survival, 
but these factors seem not to influence disease-specific survival. 
Patients with HPV-negative carcinomas, particularly those with 
p53 wild-type neoplasms may warrant wider margins and more 
strict surveillance after surgery due to their high risk of relapse.

Intraoperative pathologic evaluation of the ovary: a 21-year 
institutional practice review
T. André Sousa Oliveira*, M. Pinho, D. López-Presa
*Department of Pathology - Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN, 
Portugal
Background & objectives: Intraoperative pathologic evaluation 
may assist in therapy management of ovary pathology by confirm-
ing diagnosis and cancer type and providing information about the 
extent of the disease. Herein, we reviewed our institution’s practice 
regarding this examination.
Methods: We analysed all reports of ovarian intraoperative pathol-
ogy evaluations from a tertiary healthcare institution spanning a 
21-year period [2001-2021], totalling 329 cases. Intra- and postop-
erative diagnosis, gross pathology features, lesion size, bilateral-
ity and number of frozen blocs analysed were recorded. Of these, 
only 254 had intra- and postoperative responses available and were 
selected as our study cohort.
Results: Most patients were ≥45-years old (74.0%) and suspected 
of having an adnexal/ovarian neoplasm (n=205; 80.7%), an inde-
terminate cystic lesion (n=24; 9.4%) or another infrequent rea-
son (n=25; 10.4%); 14 patients (5.5%) underwent examination for 
bilateral lesions. Frozen sections were done in 75.2%, averaging 
1.9 sections/exam, with the remainder being only evaluated mac-
roscopically. A concordant intra- and postoperative result occurred 
in 239 cases (96.5%), with discordant results arising from: over-
valuing malignant potential (n=2; 0.8%), tumour misclassification 
(n=2; 0.8%), misinterpretation of artefactual tissue as carcinoma 
(n=1; 0.4%) and inadequate sampling (n=1; 0.4%). Three cases 
were deferred (1.2%). As higher-grade components cannot be con-
sistently excluded, intraoperative results undervaluing malignant 
potential were considered concordant.
Conclusion: Ovarian intraoperative examination remains a reliable 
and useful tool for deciding therapeutic management. A systematic 
approach to grossing, sampling and clear communication between 
clinician and pathologist are encouraged to avoid misdiagnosis and 
wrongful treatment. When a precise diagnosis is not feasible, either 
the most probable diagnosis can be reported with an indication 
of other differential diagnosis which cannot be excluded, or the 
examination can be deferred when doubt remains after careful 
examination and consideration.

Lee
*Department of Pathology, Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, Hal-
lym University College of Medicine, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Homologous recombination repair (HRR) 
pathway deficiency (HRD) is involved in the carcinogenesis of ovarian 
cancer (OC) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors can 
be effective for patients with HRD. We investigated the HRD status and 
its clinical significance in OC.
Methods: We used a new HRD solution combining information 
from germline and somatic HRR mutations including BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 with a measure of genomic scarring. On next-generation 
sequencing in 39 OCs, BRCA mutations and amplification of 
associated genes were detected. Genomic integrity (GI) index 
was calculated and a GI status was concluded. By combining the 
results, HRD status was subsequently determined.
Results: HRD status in 34 (87.2%) OCs was successfully ana-
lysed. Five cases (12.8%) were undetermined due to inconclusive 
or rejected GI index. Twenty three (67.6%) out of 34 case were 
HRD positive and 11 (32.4%) cases were HRD negative. Tumours 
with BRCA1/2 mutation were 9 (26.5%) and tumours with posi-
tive GI index were 21 (61.8%). HRD was associated with high-
grade serous carcinoma and high FIGO stage (≥IIIB) (p=0.032 and 
0.028, respectively). Patients with high GI index (>9.7) displayed 
better disease-free survival compared to those with low GI index 
(p=0.012).

Conclusion: A new HRD solution beyond BRCA1/2 mutation 
detection provides expanded clinical information and improves the 
diagnostic yield of HRD in OC. This could be useful for personal-
ized OC treatment.

Influence of histological and immunohistochemical features of 
endometrioid adenocarcinoma on the microvascular tumour 
density

Y. Soroka, R. Moskalenko, A. Romaniuk
*Sumy State University, Ukraine
Background & objectives: Endometrioid adenocarcinomas of the 
uterine body account for about 70-80% of all endometrial carcino-
mas. The most proven prognostic markers are age, stage of the disease, 
histological grade, microvascular density (MVD), and expression of 
prognostically important receptors.
Methods: The investigation was conducted on 30 samples of endo-
metrioid adenocarcinomas. The presence of E-cadherin, VEGF, 
ER, PR, Ki-67, and р53 was detected by immunohistochemistry.
Results: The pronounced predominance of MVD in moderately and 
low-differentiated tumours over highly differentiated endometrioid 
adenocarcinomas was found (F=6.34, p=0.0055). A positive 
correlation was found between MVD and the expression of VEGF 
(r=0.47, p=0.0086) and Ki-67 (r=0.54, p=0.0023) in tumour cells; 
a negative – between MVD and PR (r=-0.45, p=0.012). Expression 
of ER, E-cadherin, and p53 had no effect on the MVD of neoplastic 
tissues (p>0.05).
Conclusion: The neovascularization degree and microvascular 
density of endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma tissues are 
enhanced by tumour dedifferentiation and VEGF overexpression. 
There is a positive correlation between the proliferative activity 
level of tumour cells and MVD; a negative – between the expres-
sion of PR and MVD.

Sabadell; Institut de Recerca i Innovació Parc Taulí (I3PT), Uni-
versitat Autónoma de Barcelona, Spain
Background & objectives: BRCA1 and BRCA2 somatic or germline 
mutations in ovarian cancer (OC) have familial, prognostic and pre-
dictive significance. We analysed the mutational status of these genes 
in our cohort of patients and its correlation with several clinical and 
pathological parameters.
Methods: Next-generation sequencing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 
was performed in 80 patients with non-mucinous OC, in tumour 
and peripheral blood, from January 2019: 62 high-grade serous 
(HGSC), 8 low-grade endometrioid, 3 high-grade endometrioid 
(HGECC), 4 clear cell (CCC), 1 low-grade serous carcinomas, 1 
carcinosarcoma and 1 borderline serous tumour. Age, FIGO stage, 
histological type, clinical behaviour and molecular features were 
collected.
Results: Twenty-five pathogenic variants(PV) in 23/79 tumour-
samples (30%) were detected: 16 BRCA1/ 9 BRCA2; 15 
germinal(g) (60%) and 5 (20%) somatic(s) (5 blood pending); 16 
"frameshift", 5 "nonsense", 3 "missense" and 1 "splicing” (identi-
cal results in germinal confirmed cases). Somatic medium allelic 
frequencies(AF) were 28% versus 68% in germinal cases. One addi-
tional germinal (no tumour analysis available) was detected. 22 
were HGSC (15 BRCA1/7 BRCA2), one CCC (gBRCA1/sBRCA2), 
and one HGECC (BRCA1/ BRCA2, blood pending, tumourAF 
54%/70%). BRCA mutated-patients were 55.7yo-medium and 20% 
stage I-II, at diagnosis; non-mutated were 65.5yo and 25% I-II. All 
BRCA mutated-patients are alive, 40% with no disease(AWND); 
12% of non-mutated-patients are exitus and 20% are AWND.
Conclusion: The mutational study of BRCA1/BRCA2 in tumour-
tissue is cost-effective, sensitive and specific for germinal and 
somatic line PV detection. Germinal, “frameshift” type and HGSC 
are the prevalent mutation-line, PV and histologic type, respec-
tively. PV in tumour and blood in germinal confirmed cases were 
identical. Mutated cases are associated with younger onset age 
patients and better clinical behaviour, compared to non-mutated 
cases. This analysis is essential for an optimal management and 
for individual and family counselling.

Uterine smooth muscle tumours of uncertain malignant poten-
tial (STUMPs) with fumarate hydratase deficiency: report of 
2 cases
C. Alves-Vale*, A. Beltran, A. Alves
*CUF Descobertas Hospital, Portugal
Background & objectives: Fumarate hydratase (FH) deficiency 
accounts for characteristic architectural and cytological features, 
which may result in erroneous classification of uterine neoplasms 
if not recognised. We report 2 cases of FH-deficient smooth muscle 
tumours of uncertain malignant potential (STUMPs), diagnosed after 
myomectomy.
Methods: Case 1 refers to a 42-year-old woman presenting with a 
solitary uterine transmural nodule with 95 mm, without relevant 
personal or family history. Case 2 refers to a 27-year-old woman, 
with multiple uterine nodules since the age of 21 and family 
history of “leiomyomas”, the largest with 111 mm, refractory to 
ulipristal acetate therapy.
Results: Microscopically, both tumours were composed of a spin-
dle cell proliferation with focal areas of alveolar-type oedema and 
frequent vessels, sometimes with hemangiopericytoma-like pat-
tern. Moderate to severe atypia was observed, including bizarre 
nuclei or prominent nucleoli with perinucleolar halo. Cytoplasm 
was eosinophilic, with rhabdoid inclusions focally. Immunore-
activity for FH was lost. Mitotic index was lower than 4/mm2. 
Necrosis of indeterminate nature was present in the first case, 
and both tumour cell necrosis and ischemic-type necrosis were 
detected in the second. The diagnosis of FH-deficient STUMP 
was made. Patients were referred to the Genetics consultation to 
exclude FH germline mutations, associated to hereditary leiomy-
omatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) syndrome.
Conclusion: It is essential to recognize the prototypical morphol-
ogy of FH-deficient neoplasms, in order to avoid overdiagnosis of 
malignancy in uterine smooth muscle tumours, with special impact on 
young women who desire to preserve fertility. Although close follow-
up is recommended, the majority of STUMPs have benign behav-
iour. FH-deficient neoplasms may occur sporadically or associated to 
HLRCC syndrome, hence the importance of its prompt recognition to 
enable the early detection of aggressive forms of renal cell carcinoma.

Background & objectives: Cervical cancer is the fourth most com-
mon female malignancy. High-risk HPV molecular testing has been 
considered a useful screening option to identify women with cervical 
cancer. Herein, we aimed to correlate our institutional molecular results 
with the histological follow-up.
Methods: A retrospective and unicentric study was conducted, 
regarding the cervical cancer screening program of the Lisbon and 
Tejo Valley region, between October 2017 and December 2019. 
Women with HPV16 and/or HPV18 infection were considered; 
patients infected with the former strains and by other high-risk 
strains were also included; their clinical data and biopsy diagnosis 
were collected.
Results: From a total of 33567 high-risk HPV detection tests 
(cobas®), 3%(n=1138) were HPV16, and/or HPV18 posi-
tive, with/without co-infection with other strains: HPV16 
positive–43,32%(n=493), HPV18 positive–13,26%(n=151), 
HPV16&18 positive–0,96%(n=11), HPV16&18 and other high-risk 
strains–1,76%(n=20). About 78,6%(n=895) were evaluated by col-
poscopy with posterior biopsy. From these, HPV16 group(n=399) 
was associated in 34,01%(n=136) with high-grade lesions [high-
grade squamous intraepithelial lesion(HSIL)–95,59%(n=130); 
squamous cell carcinoma(SCC)–0,73%(n=1); adenocarcinoma(ADC) 
in situ-2,94%(n=4); ADC-0,73%(n=1)]; in HPV18 group(n=115), 
6,56%(n=8) cases were associated with high-grade lesion (all 
HSIL). In HPV16/18 group(n=9), 77,78%(n=7) patients were asso-
ciated with high-grade lesion (all HSIL). In the HPV16/18 with 
other high-risk strains group(n=13), 46,15%(n=6) cases were asso-
ciated with high-grade lesions [HSIL-80%(n=5); ADC-20%(n=1)].
Conclusion: High-risk HPV molecular testing of our population 
has given us the opportunity to screen cervical cancer and to get 
the real incidence of HPV infection genotype 16 and 18. Despite 
the necessity of further studies to appreciate the specificity/sensi-
bility of this test, namely considering patients infected with other 
high-risk strains besides 16 and 18, we conclude that patients with 
co-infection with various high-risk strains and HPV16 infection 
have the greatest association of high-grade lesions; HPV18 group 
is the least associated.

Disagreement in anatomopathological review reports in gynae-
cological pathology and its impact on treatment: the impor-
tance of the subspecialist pathologist in a cancer centre
B. Maran, L. de Brot, M. Corassa, R. de Paula*
*Ac Camargo Cancer Center, Brazil
Background & objectives: The anatomopathological report is crucial 
for clinical decisions. In this context, reference cancer centres often 
review external reports to reduce errors and inappropriate therapies. 
This study aimed to assess the degree of disagreement in reviews of 
external reports in gynaecology.
Methods: This is a single-centre, retrospective study, in which 219 
cases of gynaecological pathology were reviewed between January 
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. The degree of disagreement was 
separated into “major” (when the discrepancy between the reports 
generated a change in the patient’s therapy), "minor" (when there 
was no impact on patient management) and "no change" (when 
there was agreement).
Results: 219 cases were analysed. The median age of the popu-
lation was 48 years. 201 cases were oncological and 18 cases 
were not related to cancer. Most of the cases represented primary 
gynaecological neoplasms (only 6 cases were from metastases 
or tissues outside the female genital tract). There was agreement 
(“no change”) in 70 cases (31.9%), "minor" disagreement in 107 
cases (47.4%) and "major" disagreement in 42 cases (19.1%). 
When together, the major and minor disagreements correspond 
to 66.5% of the sample. The results were tabulated in tables and 
graphs.
Conclusion: The data presented, although showing a reality 
of only one year, are consistent with the perspective that in 
pathology, and especially in gynaecological pathology, the 
analysis of cases by a subspecialist is essential for the proper 
management of the patient. That is fundamental not only to 
ensure the provision of adequate treatment for patients, but 
also to reduce the risk of morbidities associated with aggres-
sive cancer therapies.

Ovary intraoperative consultation – are we doing the best we 
can? – A ten-year retrospective analysis of our experience
C. Dahlstedt-Ferreira*, S. Carralas Antunes, R. Oliveira, D. Gomes 
Pinto
*Hospital Garcia de Orta, E.P.E, Portugal
Background & objectives: Ovarian tumours are frequently subjected 
to intra-operative consultation (IOC). These can be challenging cases 
and misdiagnoses are frequent[DGP1]. Our aim is to evaluate how our 
intraoperative diagnoses affected patient management in our institution 
to improve future performance.
Methods: We identified all the ovarian tumours subjected to IOC 
over a period of 10 years (2012-2022), which required intraoperative 
examination, in our institution. We analysed the concordance between 
intraoperative and definitive diagnosis by means to evaluate how our 
intraoperative diagnosis affected patient management. The dataset 
was based on the patients’ pathology reports and clinical files.
Results: In this period, we performed 81 IOCs for ovarian tumours. 
The average age of patients was 56 years. Sixty-one IOCs (76,3%) 
were concordant with the final diagnosis and twenty were dis-
cordant (23,7%). Four discordant cases changed from benign to 
borderline; five from benign/borderline to malignant and five from 
borderline to benign tumour. Histological type of six of the malig-
nant tumours was changed. Discordant cases were more frequent 
in serous tumours (n=7; p=1, not significative) and six were of 
the mucinous type.
Conclusion: Intraoperative examination of ovarian masses 
is known to have a high accuracy and therefore provides some 
guidance to the surgeon’s conduct. It is also known to have many 
pitfalls posing a challenge to the pathologist. At our institution, 
the concordance between intraoperative diagnosis and definitive 
diagnosis is in line with the literature. Mucinous neoplasms pose 
a higher challenge compared to other histological types, although 
in our series we didn’t find significant differences between IOC 
diagnoses of serous and mucinous tumours.

Background & objectives: Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most com-
mon gynaecological malignancy in developed countries. By analysing 
intraoperative consultation (IOC) of EC cases, we want to assess our 
performance so far, aiming at determining the best approach for these 
cases.
Methods: We identified all cases of EC that underwent IOC, 
over the last 7 years at out institution. Data were gathered from 
pathology reports and patients’ clinical files. We focused on 
analysing the purpose of the IOC (diagnosis vs. staging), if frozen 
sections were performed, concordance of intra-operative with 
definitive diagnosis and how this result influenced the surgical 
procedure.
Results: Seventy-eight IOC in endometrial lesions were performed, 
75 for staging and 3 for diagnosis. The average age of the patients 
was 67 years. Sixty-four (82,05%) cases were concordant, eleven 
(14,1%) were discordant and three (1,85%) were deferred. Twenty-
seven IOC had frozen sections performed. Four discordant cases 
were upstaged in the surgical specimen due to myometrium invasion, 
two due to cervical stromal invasion and four due to serosa and/or 
adnexal involvement. No frozen sections were performed in the lat-
ter. There were no statistically significant differences between cases 
with and without frozen section (p=0,7362) in terms of concordance.
Conclusion: At our institution, concordance between IOC and 
definitive diagnosis is high, with only seven discordant cases 
(8,97%) with impact on the patient. Out results show that gross 
evaluation is mostly adequate for staging EC, but frozen sections 
might be of particular use on grossly borderline cases for myo-
metrial and cervical stromal invasion. Serosal or adnexal nodules 
should be detected grossly, and frozen sections performed. IOC is 
useful in cases of EC, eliminating the need for reintervention in 
many patients.

PD-L1 and mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression in small 
cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix
R. Moiteiro da Cruz*, J. Almeida-Tavares, S. Lérias
*Department of Pathology - Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN; 
Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal
Background & objectives: Cervical neuroendocrine carcinoma(NEC) 
is rare with limited therapeutic options. Recent studies described 
abnormal p53, MMR deficient and PD-L1 expression in cervical NECs. 
Our aim was to evaluate p53, PD-L1 and MMR protein expression in 
NECs and its correlation to prognosis.
Methods: We selected 5 cases of NECs with known clinicopatho-
logical and prognosis data diagnosed over 22 years(2000 to 2022). 
Immunohistochemistry for p53, p16, PAX8, chromogranin, syn-
aptophysin, TTF-1, PD-L1(22C3 clone) and MMR proteins was 
performed. PD-L1 was assessed using the combined positive 
score(CPS) with a threshold of ≥1 required for positivity and aber-
rant p53 (overexpression or null) was considered positive.
Results: Mean patient age was 58 years (range 33-71), all cases 
were diagnosed in FIGO stage IV and 2 died of disease. Three 
cases were pure small-cell NEC and 2 were mixed carcinomas, 
associated with adenocarcinoma (n=1) and squamous cell carci-
noma (n=1), each. All cases demonstrated p16 positive staining, 
synaptophysin focally positive staining, chromogranin negative 
staining and PD-L1 negative. PAX8 was positive in 4 cases, 
TTF-1 in 3 cases, p53 mutant pattern was observed in 3 cases 
and no MMR deficiency was observed.
Conclusion: Our study showed strong nuclear staining for p16 in 
all cases, demonstrating the influence of high-risk HPV infection 
on its carcinogenesis. The variability of p53 expression demon-
strate the diversity of genomic landscape of this tumour, being 
in accordance with the most common genetic alterations usually 
found. No expression of PD-L1, as well as no MMR deficient was 
found, suggesting a lower expression of PD-L1 in tumours with 
microsatellite stability.

Polymerase-ɛ exonuclease domain mutations predict excel-
lent outcome among SWI/SNF-deficient undifferentiated and 
dedifferentiated endometrial carcinomas
B. Tessier-Cloutier*, M. Köbel, A. Momeni-Boroujeni, J. Ben-
hamida, C. Stewart, M. Ladanyi, R. Soslow, C. Lee
*Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, USA
Background & objectives: SWI/SNF-deficient undifferentiated 
(UDEC) and dedifferentiated (DDEC) endometrial carcinomas are 
aggressive malignancies with poor treatment response. The prognostic 
role of the molecular classification is unknown in those malignancies. 
Here we review a molecularly and clinically annotated series of SWI/
SNF-deficient UDEC/DDEC.
Methods: We collected a series of UDEC/DDEC with loss of 
expression of a core SWI/SNF protein (SMARCA4, SMARCB1, 
or ARID1B). The molecular subtype was assigned according to 
the Proactive Molecular Risk Classifier for Endometrial Can-
cer (ProMisE), including hotspot POLE mutation testing and 
immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins and p53. 
Kaplan Meier survival analysis was performed across all differ-
ent molecular subgroups.
Results: We included 60 UDEC/DDEC, the median age of the 
cohort was 59 years (range: 37-82 years) and most cases were 
high stage at presentation (19/36). Of the 60 cases, 36 were 
MMR-deficient (MMR-d), 6 were POLE mutated (POLEmut), 4 
p53 abnormal (p53abn) and 14 with no specific molecular profile 
(NSMP). The median overall survival of POLEmut cases was 
26.1 months without any death, compared to 11.8 months in the 
rest of the cases (p=0.034). The cases classified as MMR-D, 
p53abn or NSMP had similar outcome (p=0.319).
Conclusion: All POLEmut cases had an excellent prognosis 
while the other three molecular subgroups (MMR-D, p53abn and 
NSMP) had poor outcomes. Molecular classification among the 
non-POLEmut cases was not informative of clinical behaviour in 
our study. These results highlight the importance of hotspot POLE 
mutation testing in SWI/SNF-deficient UDEC/DDEC to help guide 
management.

Background & objectives: Investigate the influence of Forkhead-box 
on endometrial cancer progression. The molecular subgrouping of EC 
proposed by the Cancer Genome Atlas is vital in precise molecular-
based patient triage. The driving mechanisms are necessary to identify 
correlations between genes and their regulators.
Methods: A total of 103 White female patients with confirmed EC 
were enrolled. For analysis, we used next-generation sequencing

with Hot Spot Cancer Panel provided by Illumina Inc, San Diego, 
California, USA, and immunohistochemical analysis FOXA-1, 
FOXP1, Oestrogen receptor. Participants underwent surgical treat-
ment without previous radio-chemotherapy to conduct a credible 
comparative analysis of tumour characteristics, the treatment, and 
unchanged molecular profiling.
Results: we observed a negative correlation with FOXA-1 
revealing that FOXA-1 silencing led to worse outcome based on 
the negative correlation with FOXA-1(test log-rank for FOXA1 
2,031559, p = 0.04220 and HR 2.66, p = 0.06), The estimation 
of targeted protein frequency was conducted revealing that 
FOXA-1 occurred in 24 cases, especially in the FIGO IA stage 
. Furthermore, a correlation was found for FOXP-1 (R = 0,2872 
p = 0.0041). This depicts Kaplan-Meier curves for FOXA-1 (p 
= 0.042). FOX proteins were closely correlated with TP53 and 
KRAS mutation. Oestrogen receptor expression was detected in 
all FOXP-1 positive cases and more than 90% of FOXA-1 positive 
ones.
Conclusion: Our study confirmed that FOXA-1 is a reliable 
biomarker in the prognosis of Endometrial cancer outcomes. The 
changes of FoxA downstream profiles in different cancers would 
provide more valuable clues for FoxA’s biological function and 
could be considered as efficient biomarkers for cancer diagnosis or 
prognosis. The FOX transcription factor family is closely correlated 
to hormone-dependent carcinogenesis by interacting with steroid 
receptors. Thus, FOX binds the promoters of more than 100 genes, 
in turn, regulating many cellular functions.

Flow cytometric characterisation of adult T-cell leukaemia/
lymphoma (ATLL) and the associated cytogenetics and next 
generation sequencing (NGS) Findings
U. Edema*, J. Liu, Y. Wang, Y. Shi
*Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 
USA
Background & objectives: ATLL, a rare aggressive mature T cell neo-
plasm is frequently positive for CD4/CD25 and shows loss of CD7 expres-
sion. Rarely, they present with unusual immunophenotypes therefore diag-
nostically challenging. We summarized the immunophenotypes of ATLL 
and analysed their associated cytogenetics/NGS findings.
Methods: In this study, we summarized the immunophenotypes of 
ATLL by flow cytometry and analysed the associated cytogenetics/
next generation sequencing (NGS) findings. We retrospectively 
identified 117 patients with ATLL in a single institution in USA 
during a 19-year period (2003-2021). Of these 117 patients, 100 
patients had flow cytometry tests, 70 patients had cytogenetics 
tests, and 43 patients had NGS tests.
Results: Out of the 100 patients with flow cytometry tests, 87 
patients (87%) showed CD4+/CD7- immunophenotype, 7 (7%) 
patients showed CD4+/CD8+ immunophenotype, 2 (2%) patients 
showed CD4-/CD8- immunophenotype, 3 (3%) patients showed 
CD5- immunophenotype, 1 (1%) patient showed CD4-/CD7+ 
immunophenotype. The cases with unusual immunophenotypes 
frequently show complex cytogenetics/NGS findings with TP53, 
TBL1XR1 and NOTCH 1 being the most frequently mutated 
genes.
Conclusion: ATLL is associated with human T lymphotropic 
virus (HTLV-1) infection, usually in endemic areas such as 
Japan and Caribbean countries. CD4+/CD7- is the most common 
immunophenotypic findings of ATLL. ATLL can rarely show unu-
sual immunophenotypes and frequently accompanied by complex 
cytogenetics/NGS findings. These cases can be incredibly chal-
lenging diagnostically. However, by combining the demographic 
features of the patients and typical clinical presentations, the possi-
bility of ATLL should be raised and confirmed by HTLV-1 testing.

thology, ANAPATMOL Research Center, Victor Babes University 
of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania
Background & objectives: Primary thyroid lymphoma (PTL) is 
an uncommon heterogeneous neoplasm diagnosed more frequent 
in women, commonly associated with autoimmune thyroiditis and 
account for less than 5% of primary thyroid malignancies. This study 
aimed to assess the clinico-pathological profile of PTL.
Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted by 
analysing the medical records and examining the histopathologi-
cal features of thyroidectomy and lobectomy specimens, from 11 
patients diagnosed with PTL at the Emergency County Hospital 
from Timisoara. Clinical, pathological and immunohistochemi-
cal data (antibodies anti Ki67, CD20, CD10, CD30, CD5, Bcl-2, 
Bcl-6, cyclin-D1, ALK-1, kappa, lambda) were assessed.
Results: The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 69 years 
old. Eight women and three men were diagnosed with PTL 
resulting a female to male ratio of 2.7:1. Nine (81.81%) 
patients accused a painless and progressive growing tumour 
mass in the anterior cervical region, accompanied by local 
compression symptoms: dyspnea, dysphagia and dysphonia. 
All cases were diagnosed as non-Hodgkin, B-cell lymphomas 
(CD20 positive). The histological type consisted of six diffuse 
large B cell lymphoma, three MALT lymphoma, one follicular 
lymphoma and one case with follicular and diffuse lymphoma 
features. In 10 cases, PTL associated autoimmune lymphocytic 
thyroiditis. Seven cases (63,63%) were staged IE, two cases-
IIE and two cases-IIIE.
Conclusion: This study reaffirms the clinico-pathological features 
of primary thyroid lymphoma, with a slight variation in female 
to male ratio. PTL are rare tumours and should be considered in 
the differential diagnosis of patients complaining of painless, 
progressive growing goiter or neck masses, and have a history 
of Hashimoto autoimmune thyroiditis. The prognosis of these 
patients is excellent and the overall survival is improved due to 
the advances in both diagnosis and treatment in recent years.

Background & objectives: Entire exome sequencing studies of 
DLBCL tissues have identified MYD88 and PIM-1 genes as involved in 
the development and signalling of this pathology. We aim to genotype 
profiles of MYD88 and PIM-1 genes and their implications on the 
prognosis.
Methods: We have conducted a retrospective study that included 
50 paraffin-embedded tissues of DLBCL diagnosed at the Pathol-
ogy Department of the Emergency County Clinical Hospital, Con-
stanta, Romania, and Sacele Municipal Hospital, Brasov, Romania, 
between 2012 and 2021. The genotyping was analysed by RT-PCR 
using TaqMan® genotyping master mix and readymade TaqMan® 
genotyping assays for MYD88 (p.L252P) and PIM1 (p.G28A, 
p.L184V, p.V197F)
Results: Twenty-two patients were female and twenty-eight were 
male with ages ranging from 26 to 91 (mean:60,32 years).Twenty-
four tumour samples were located in the lymph nodes and spleen, 
sixteen were located in the gastrointestinal tract (GI), four were 
located in the central nervous system and six tumours were located 
in the skin, testis, head and neck. Four cases (8%) were found to 
have mutation p.Leu252Pro in the MYD88 gene which occurs due 
to the transition of T>C at c.755 and only one case (2%) was found 
to have a mutation p.Gly28Asp in the PIM1 gene, as a transition 
of G>A at c.83.
Conclusion: In conclusion, our preliminary data suggests that the 
oncogenic mutations of PIM1 and MYD88 in our diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cohort may improve diagnosis and 
prognosis of the patients with this pathology.

*Salah Azaiz Institute of Cancer, Tunisia
Background & objectives: T-cell lymphomas (TCL) account for 
10-15% of all lymphoproliferative disorders. Although commonly 
present, bone marrow involvement by TCL can be diagnostically chal-
lenging. Our aim was to establish a diagnostic approach to reliably 
identify bone marrow infiltration of TCL.
Methods: Retrospective study of 58 cases of bone marrow involve-
ment by TCL collected in the pathology department over a period 
of 20 years (January 2001-December 2021). We analysed the mor-
phological particularities of bone marrow infiltration by TCL.
Results: Our series included 41 males and 17 females with a 
median age of 45 years. The major subtype was TCL NOS in 58% 
followed by the angioimmunoblastic TCL in 18%. The anaplastic, 
the hepatosplenic and the NK subtype were diagnosed in 8% of 
cases for each one.
The infiltration pattern was interstitial in 72%, nodular in 15%, 
focal para trabecular in 10% and intrasinusoidal in 3% of cases 
highlighted with immunochemistry markers.
The infiltration percentage was less than 20% of cell population in 
10 cases and more than 50% in 15 cases.
Conclusion: Bone marrow involvement in TCL is prognostically 
important for appropriate management. Morphology with immu-
nochemistry can be reliably used to diagnose the bone marrow 
infiltration and to rule out the differential diagnosis.

*Department of pathology and Cancer Research Laboratory, Blida 
University Hospital, Saad Dahleb University, Algeria
Background & objectives: The prevalence of EBV in DLBCL 
accounts for <5-15% of DLBCL among Asian and Latin American 
patients and <5% among western patients. Our aim was to define the 
prevalence and clinicopathological features of EBV (+) DLBCL in 
Algeria.
Methods: A total of 162 cases of de novo DLBCL treated with 
R-CHOP were evaluated from January 2015 to August 2019. LMP1 
and EBNA2 were performed for latency. The presence of EBV 
determined by EBER-ISH assay with 20% of cut-off. Clinical and 
pathological data were analysed.
Results: Of these 162 cases with DLBCL,13 (8%) showed EBV 
positivity. The median age of EBV(+)-DLBCL patients was 59, 
range from 22-87. 77% EBV(+)-DLBCL present in the nodal site 
. The ABC phenotype was found in 100% of our cases. 53.8% 
showed type III EBV latency. Clinically, EBV(+)-DLBCL pre-
sented an advanced clinical stage (84.6%), a high IPI (46.2%), 
and a low rate of response to treatment and survival (69.2%). Our 
results showed a significant difference between the two groups 
EBV(+)-DLBCL and EBV(-)-DLBCL on the response to R-CHOP 
treatment (p=0.01) and survival rate between the two groups. Log 
Rank (Mantel-Cox) p=0.0001
Conclusion: The prevalence of EBV in DLBCL is estimated at 8% 
in our series, joining the Asian series. This is still considerable 
compared to Western countries. Survival was significantly associ-
ated with EBV in our study.

Background & objectives: ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lym-
phoma (ALCL) ) is a malignant CD30-positive T cell neoplasm and 
clinically/molecularly three different subgroups have been outlined: 
DUSP22-rearranged, TP63-rearranged, and triple-negative cases (lack-
ing DUSP22,TP63,ALK) with 5-year overall survival 90%, 17%, and 
42%, respectively.
Methods: We investigated 26 ALCL cases: 17 ALK-negative 
and 9 ALK-positive (as a control group). The histopathological 
confirmation of the diagnosis (morphology and immunoprofile) 
with a consecutive 125-gene panel assay dedicated to lymphomas 
was performed. Samples and genes were clustered according to 
the Kendall rank correlation coefficient calculated on the per-
centage of reads value.
Results: The subgrouping of ALCL revealed: no(0) DUSP22-rear-
ranged, three(3) TP63-rearranged, and sixteen(16) triple-negative 
cases. The prevalence of genes fusions (PGF) in the ALCL ALK-
positive and ALK-negative groups included CCND1 and CCND3 
(100%); the most frequently presented gene isoforms (PGI) in these 
two ALCL groups were BATF3 (70%) and ETV6 (60%). The profile 
of PGI in ALK-positive and triple-negative cases differed in LMO2, 
MUM1/IRF, MUC1 and were respectively 15%, <1%, 57% vs. 44%,

13%, 19%. The PGF including MYC was 14% in ALK-positive and 
19% in triple-negative cases. Additionally, the TP63-rearranged 
cases showed a strong gene fusion connection between FOXP1 
and EIF4E3.
Conclusion: The ALK-negative ALCL is a rare lymphoma, which 
is now classified as a separate entity that should be differentiated 
from primary cutaneous ALCL, and other T-cell/B-cell lymphomas 
with CD30 expression and anaplastic morphology. Comprehensive 
molecular studies under a larger cohort of ALK- ALCL are limited 
due to the low number of cases. Further investigation is needed not 
only to give more insight into the clinical significance of genetic 
alterations but also in search of new molecular targets for person-
alized therapy.

Diagnostic utility of h3.3k36m immunostaining in chondro-
blastomas: a study of 16 cases from a tertiary cancer referral 
centre in India
V. Dave*, B. Rekhi
*Tata Memorial Hospital, India
Background & objectives: Chondroblastoma is a relatively uncom-
mon benign bone tumour. At times, there is a challenge in differentiat-
ing it from its diagnostic mimics, especially on limited biopsies, with 
treatment-related implications.
To evaluate H3.3K36M immunostaining in chondroblastomas.
Methods: Ten cases were in the form of biopsy specimens and six 
were referred cases in form of paraffin blocks. Immunohistochemi-
cal staining for H3.3K36M (monoclonal, RM193, 1:100 dilution) 
was graded in terms of staining intensity(1+to 3+) and the percent-
age of tumour cells showing unequivocal nuclear staining.
Proximal tibia (5/16, 31.25%) was the commonest site, followed by 
the proximal humerus (4/16, 25%).
Results: We observed positive immunohistochemical staining for 
H3.3K36M in 15/16(93.75%) chondroblastomas, including all the 
tumour components, such as tumour cells and pink cartilage, but 
sparing the osteoclast-like giant cells. The percentage of tumour cells 
showing positivity ranged from 30% to 95%. We observed 3+ stain-
ing in 13/15((86.6%) cases and 2+ staining pattern in 2/15(13.3%) 
cases. A single case, which showed nuclear atypia displayed positive 
immunostaining for H3.3K36M in 80% of tumour cells with 3+ stain-
ing. None of the other 12 giant cell-rich lesions, including giant cell 
tumour of bone, displayed positive immunostaining for H3.3K36M.
Conclusion: Overall diagnostic sensitivity of H3.3K36M for chon-
droblastoma was 93.7% and specificity was 100%. This study, which 
is one of the first from our country, supports the diagnostic value of 
H3.3K36M for diagnosing chondroblastoma, including its distinction 
from its various diagnostic mimics on limited biopsy specimens.

Metalic-alloy wear debris after total hip arthroplasty is induc-
ing periprosthetic tissue inflammation on subcellular level
S. Fokter*, R. Podlipec, E. Punzón-Quijorna
*University Medical Centre Maribor, Slovenia
Background & objectives: The metallic-associated adverse local tissue 
reactions (ALTR) and events accompanying worn implant materials are 
poorly understood on the subcellular level. Current immunohistochemical 
techniques lack chemical sensitivity to investigate causal relations between 
material and biological response on submicron scale.
Methods: A combination of photon, electron and ion beam micros-
copy-spectroscopy techniques including hybrid optical fluorescence 
and reflectance micro-spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), helium ion 
microscopy (HIM) and micro-particle-induced X-ray emission 
(micro-PIXE) were applied on periprosthetic tissue obtained at revi-
sion surgery of a patient with osteoarthritis, who was treated earlier 
with a titanium-alloy total hip arthroplasty.
Results: Micron sized wear debris was found as the main cause of the 
tissue oxidative stress exhibited through lipopigments accumulation in 
the nearby lysosomes. This may explain the signs of chronic inflam-
mation from prior histologic investigation. Furthermore, insights 
on extensive fretting and corrosion of the debris on nm scale and a 
quantitative measure of significant Al and V release into the tissue 
together with hydroxyapatite-like layer formation particularly bound 
to the regions with the highest Al content were revealed. Finally, by 
micro-PIXE we observed a wide spread of Ti- alloy debris throughout 
the whole tissue sample and confirmed selective metal leaching that 
corresponds to elevated concentrations in the patient’s serum.
Conclusion: The functional and structural information obtained 
at the subcellular level contributes to a better understanding of 
the macroscopic inflammatory processes observed on the tissue 
level. The established label-free correlative microscopy approach 
can efficiently be adopted to study any other clinical cases related 
to ALTR, as it can reveal more insights into implant rejection pro-
cesses compared to the conventional histological examination fur-
ther down on a submicron to single molecular scale.

nering (CROSSING project, Grant-No: PIE-0007) and the Euro-
pean Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme

Extraadrenal soft-tissues Myelolipomas: clinicopathological 
study of 10 cases
M. Garcia Martos*, Y. Gómez Navarro, C.M. Vieru, A. Panizo 
Santos
*Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Spain
Background & objectives: Myelolipoma is an uncommon benign 
tumour. It is most often found in the adrenal glands, although lesions in 
other unusual sites have also been described. The aim of our study is to 
describe the clinicopathological features of extraadrenal myelolipomas.
Methods: The pathology departmental archives of two University Hos-
pitals were searched from 2005-2021 for patients originally diagnosed 
as extraadrenal myelolipoma. The cases were reviewed by the authors. 
Clinical parameters such as age, gender, tumour sites, and follow up 
were obtained from the existing medical records.
Results: Ten patients were identified: 7 males and 3 females, age 
ranged from 55 to 48 years. None of the patients had a previous history 
of malignancy or haematological diseases. All patients were diagnosed 
incidentally. The tumours involved posterior mediastinum (1), retro-
peritoneum (2), pelvic soft tissues (1), and paravertebral presacral 
(6). CT scan showed in all patients a well-demarcated tumour with 
fat density showing heterogeneous enhancement. So liposarcoma was 
suspected and surgical resection was performed. The tumours were 
well-circumscribed, encapsulated, with yellow to grey cut surfaces. 
Histologically, the tumours showed mature adipose tissue and hemat-
opoietic elements, with concordant inmunohistochemistry. All patients 
went follow-up with no recurrence at the time of evaluation.

Conclusion: Myelolipoma is an uncommon benign tumour composed 
of adipose tissue and normal hematopoietic elements, which incidence 
is 0,08-0,2%. We present 10 cases of extraadrenal myelolipomas. 
Extraadrenal myelolipoma is a rare benign and asymptomatic tumour 
that may be misdiagnosed as a malignant lipomatous tumour on radio-
logical studies. Most of them are incidentally detected during radio-
logical investigation of unrelated symptoms. Surgery is the recom-
mended treatment. The final diagnosis relies on pathologic findings.

Anastomosing haemangioma with unusual location and mim-
icking malignancy: a case series and literature review
E. Dicle Serbes*, E. Gedik, S. Yuksel, G. Kaygusuz
*Ankara University Medical School, Pathology Department, 
Turkey
Background & objectives: Anastomosing haemangioma (AH) is a 
relatively newly defined entity seen mostly in the kidney. Extrarenal 
localizations have also been reported. Herein, we report two non-renal 
cases, one of which is the second case in English literature involving 
anterior mediastinum.
Methods: Excisional biopsies were obtained from a 68-year-old 
woman with an anterior mediastinal mass (8 mm), and a 41-year-
old man with a mass of 12.5 mm located between left adrenal gland 
and tail of pancreas. The latter had a pre-diagnosis of a malignancy. 
Both of them was incidentally found. Radiological examinations 
including CT, MRI and PET scans were also evaluated.
Results: Both lesions were un-encapsulated, well-circumscribed 
tumours consisting of predominantly small, anastomosing, 
splenic-like sinusoidal vascular structures which were lined by 
single layer of flat endothelial cells with occasional hobnail 
cells. Small fibrin thrombi was present in some vascular chan-
nels. No multilayering of endothelial cells, cytological atypia, 
necrosis, mitotic activity, extramedullary haematopoiesis or 
invasion into surrounding tissues was found. Immunohistochem-
ically, tumour cells were diffusely positive with CD31, ERG and 
CD34 but negative for GLUT1, D2-40, Desmin or Cytokeratin. 
Ki67 proliferation index was lower than 5% in tumour cells. 
Cases were diagnosed as AH. Anterior mediastinal AH had posi-
tive surgical margins, the patient has been following for 2 years 
without any local recurrence.
Conclusion: Anastomosing haemangioma is a relatively newly 
described benign vascular tumour. It is a rare neoplasm which 
can have some overlapping histologic features with well-differ-
entiated angiosarcoma. It was originally described in kidney and 
perinephric adipose tissue in 2009, but extrarenal sites including 
testis, spermatic cord, ovary, adrenal glands, gastrointestinal tract, 
mesentery, soft tissues and bone had also been reported. Recogni-
tion of this entity and knowing that it may occur in unexpected 
localisations may help it’s differential diagnosis from more aggres-
sive lesions.

Three cases of Kaposi sarcoma as initial manifestation of HIV 
infection and AIDS
J. Jevtic*, L. Simic, R. Janković, S. Rajkovic, G. Djuricic, J. Sopta
*Institute of Pathology, Serbia
Background & objectives: Epidemic Kaposi sarcoma (KS), the most 
common subtype, is seen in the setting of HIV infection and related 
acquired immunodeficiency. We report three cases of KS as initial 
manifestation of AIDS.
Methods: We analysed medical records from Register of bone and 
soft tissue lesions biopsies in the Institute of pathology, Medical 
Faculty, University of Belgrade from 2006 to 2022.
Results: Only three patients had KS associated with HIV infec-
tion as initial manifestation of AIDS. All of them were males. One 
patient was 40-year-old with KS localized in tonsil, and two of 
them were 43-year-old with KS localized in cervical lymph nodes. 
All patients were presented with bulky masses and all of them 
underwent excisional biopsy. Histological analysis showed spin-
dle cell tumour, without pleomorphism, mixed with inflammatory 
cells. Aforementioned spindle cells were immunohistochemically 
positive for vascular markers. Positivity for HHV-8 indicated diag-
nosis of KS and further clinical examinations in order to confirm/
exclude AIDS were performed. All patients were found to be HIV 
positive, with developed AIDS.
Conclusion: Even though rare, KS could be initial manifestation of 
AIDS. In order to confirm/exclude the diagnosis of KS, when there 
are any histological suspicion, HHV-8 should be applied. Early 
diagnosis of KS and AIDS prevents complications and ensures 
better prognosis.

Pediatric chordomas: report of five cases with emphasis on 
poorly differentiated subtype and SMARCB1/INI1 deficiency
Z.B. Erdem*, A.M. Onenerk Men, S.N. Tuter, S. Ocak, N. 
Comunoglu
*Basaksehir Cam and Sakura City Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Chordoma is a rare primary malignant 
bone tumour showing notochordal differentiation. They usually affect 
adults, and extremely rarely seen in paediatric age group. For children, 
such tumours present a different biology with aggressive histological 
features, and worse prognosis.
Methods: All chordomas diagnosed between January 2016-January 
2022 in one institution were reviewed for the study (total number 
of 41). Five patients belonging to paediatric age group were found 
and included in the study.
Results: Patients ages ranged between 2 to 18 years(median:9 
years); 3 females, 2 males. Tumour localizations were 
as follows: two cervical vertebrea, two clivus and one 
intracranial(cerebellopontin angle). On histomorphologic exami-
nation, three cases showed conventional chordoma features, one 
of them was compatible with chondroid chordoma and two of 
the cases had poorly differentiated morphology. On immunohis-
tochemical analysis all tumours showed cytokeratin and EMA 
positivity. Four tumours showed S100 positivity with one of the 
poorly differentiated tumours being negative. Four of the tumours 
were brachyury positive (wasn’t applied to one of the conventional 
chordoma). SMARCB1(INI1) immunohistochemistry was applied 
to all and both of the poorly differentiated tumours showed loss 
of expression.
Conclusion: Currently, WHO classifies chordomas into three sub-
types: conventional, poorly differentiated, dedifferentiated. Fea-
tures in paediatric population are different from the correspond-
ing adult tumours. Majority of “poorly differentiated” tumours are 
found in children and diagnostic feature of this subtype is loss of 
SMARCB1(INI1) expression. Demonstration of bracyury positiv-
ity with loss of SMARCB1(INI1) expession are easily applica-
ble diagnostic tests. Although the limited data on poorly differ-
entiated chordomas show that they have poor prognosis, proving 
SMARCB1(INI1) loss provides an opportunity for possible targeted 
therapies.

Does MYC-amplification help distinguishing primary from 
radiation-induced angiosarcomas?
B. Raposo Pulido*, J.M. Rodríguez Barbero, F.I. Camacho 
Castañeda, A.E. Ballén Barragán, M. Granados Almillo, J.P. 
Morillo Morillo, R. Granados Carreño
*Hospital Universitario de Getafe, Spain
Background & objectives: Angiosarcomas (AS) can be primary 
(PAS) or secondary (SAS) to radiation therapy or chronic lymphedema. 
Both share histological findings, but genetic and molecular differences 
have been reported. We compared these features in 8 cases of AS.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 8 cases of AS (4 males 
and 4 females) diagnosed at our hospital between 1996 and 2022. 
Clinicopathological, immunohistochemical (IHC) and molecular 
studies were performed in 5 cases of PAS and 3 of SAS.
Results: Eight patients with an age range of 18-79.
Three had SAS 3-30 years after irradiation for breast carcinoma 
(2 cases) or brain astroblastoma. Five PAS were from the skin, 
breast, pleura, popliteal artery and penis. Histopathological study 
revealed a high-grade malignant mesenchymal tumour with pro-
liferating endothelial cells and varying degrees of atypia and 
growth patterns (epithelioid, spindled, or vasoformative) in all 
cases, not distinguishing PAS from SAS.
p53 overexpression was seen in all 5 PAS, but it was absent in 
the 3 SAS cases.
While c-myc overexpression was demonstrated by IHC in all but 
the penile AS, only 3 PAS and 1 SAS showed low-level MYC 
amplification (3-5 copies).
Conclusion: In our study, c-myc immunohistochemical overex-
pression did not correlate with MYC gene amplification in all 
the cases. Low-level MYC amplification was found in 50% of 
our cases. Interestingly we couldn’t demonstrate high-level MYC 
amplification (>10 copies) in any case. In our series, MYC and/
or p53 alterations may play an important role to induce oncogen-
esis in AS, independently of prior radiation therapy, by increas-
ing genomic instability.

Usefulness of novel SS18-SSX and SSX c-terminus antibodies 
for identification of specific fusion oncoprotein in sarcomas
T.M. Godschachner*, J. Igrec, S. Scheipl, A. Leithner, B. Liegl-
Atzwanger, I. Brcic
*Medical University of Graz, Austria
Background & objectives: Chromosomal rearrangement can be iden-
tified by direct methods or immunohistochemical staining for a compo-
nent of the fusion oncoprotein as a surrogate marker. We aim to gain 
insights into the staining profile of sarcomas using novel SS18-SSX 
and SSX c-terminus antibodies.
Methods: Retrospective analysis of 303 soft tissue sarcomas 
diagnosed at our Institution between 1999 and 2019 was per-
formed, and tissue microarrays were constructed. Immunohisto-
chemistry was conducted on the Benchmark Ultra platform with 
iVIEW DAB Detection Kit. Two different antibodies for SSX 
locus were used: SS18-SSX and SSX c-terminus. Ten whole-
tissue sections of genetically confirmed synovial sarcomas were 
used as a control.
Results: In total, 19/303 (6.3%) and 23/303 (7.6%) sarcomas 
showed in most of the cases strong nuclear staining with SS18-
SSX and SSX, respectively. In detail, from 21 synovial sar-
comas, 19 (90.5%) stained positive for both antibodies. In 5 
cases, nuclear staining for SSX antibody was weak. 9/10 (90%) 
control cases showed strong nuclear staining for SS18-SSX, 
and 3/10 (70%) were negative for SSX. Furthermore, SSX 
nuclear expression was also found in 4/56 (7.1%) myxofibro-
sarcomas. All other sarcomas, including various liposarcomas, 
angiosarcomas, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas, leio-
myosarcomas, and epithelioid sarcomas, were negative for both 
antibodies.
Conclusion: Novel SS18-SSX and SSX c-terminus antibodies are 
reliable diagnostic markers and can be used as surrogate markers to 
identify a specific fusion. The former antibody is more specific and 
shows strong nuclear staining in synovial sarcomas, whereas SSX 
can present with weak staining and is less specific. RNA-based 
NGS analysis should be performed in equivocal cases to confirm 
the specific rearrangement.

Chordoma: significance and correlation of the localisation, 
vascular density and Ki67 for the occurrence of chordoma 
recurrence
L. Simic*, J. Jevtic, M. Radojevic, D. Ribic, S. Rajkovic, G. Dju-
ricic, D. Ristic, J. Sopta
*University of Belgrade, Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Pathol-
ogy, Belgrade, Serbia	
Background & objectives: Chordomas are malignant slow-growing, 
locally invasive tumours, usually localized in sacrum, vertebra and 
scull base, characterized by frequent relapses. The aim of the study is 
to examine the correlation between localization, blood vessels density 
and Ki67 value and disease recurrence.
Methods: All chordoma biopsies, taken in Institute for Orthopaedic 
Surgery Banjica in the period of five years (2017-2021), were 
analysed at the Institute of Pathology, in Belgrade. A total number 
of 21 cases were divided into two groups: patients with and without 
relapses. Ki67 value was counted on 100 cells in hot spot. Vascular 
density was estimated using CD34 immunostaining in 1mm2.
Results: Out of total 21 patients with chordoma only 9 had a 
relapse. The most affected bone was sacral bone, but without a 
statistically significant difference in the frequency of recurrence 
at different chordoma localizations. The average number of 
blood vessels in 1mm2 and value of Ki67 was statistically 
significantly higher in group of tumours with recurrence 
(p=0,015, p=0.033 respectively). Ki67 proliferative index values 
greater than 10% show a statistically significant difference in 
the frequency of relapses. The value of the proliferative index 
higher than 15% has a moderately high correlation with the 
occurrence of relapse.
Conclusion: Chordoma is a rare, but locally aggressive tumour, 
with high recurrence rate (35-40%). Based on our results, 
determination of the immunohistochemical expression of CD34 
antigen in evaluation of vascular density, together with proliferative 
index Ki67 can be helpful to predict tumour recurrence.

sampling in combination with routine staining and immunohistochem-
istry. Our study aimed to compare the emerging Papanicolaou System 
with the C1-C5 grading system in a single UK institution.
Methods: We retrospectively assessed 723 cases of pancreatobil-
iary cytology with 142 cases demonstrating corroborative histol-
ogy. The reported C1-C5 grade was reviewed by 2 independent 
pathologists and assigned a grade within the Papanicolaou Society 
of Cytopathology Guidelines for pancreaticobiliary cytology. We 
were then able to compare the 2 grading systems for diagnostic 
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, false positive and false negative 
rates.
Results: All cases which were originally assigned to C1, C2, C4 
and C5 categories maintained the diagnostic category assignment 
when comparing to the Papanicolaou Society system. The number 
of cases reported as atypical was reduced from 93 to 73 when 
using the Papanicolaou Society system; 5 cases were subsequently 
reported as IVA and 15 cases IVB.
Sensitivity was 98.3%, specificity 75%, false positive rate 2.5% and 
false negative rate 11.8% with a diagnostic accuracy of 91.5% with 
the C1-C5 system. The Papanicolaou Society guidelines showed 
a sensitivity of 99.1%, specificity of 79.1%, false positive rate of 
2.5% and a false negative rate of 5% with a diagnostic accuracy 
of 94.3%.
Conclusion: The increasingly international approach to pathol-
ogy highlights the need for a standardised reporting system 
to facilitate safe but effective communication whilst enabling 
national and international data comparisons. Our data supports 
the adoption of the Papanicolaou system recommended by the 
Royal College of Pathologists (UK); comparable results are 
achieved compared to C1-C5 whilst reducing the number of 
cases reported as atypical allowing for more informed diagnos-
tic decisions to maximise patient benefit as we embark on the 
next generation of pathology.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours: the shifting scales of 
lesion classification
M. Hanks*, M. Khan, D. Lobo, I. Beckingham, S. Ryder, A.M. 
Zaitoun
*Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Pancreatic neoplasms are classified 
using C1-C5 or Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology; the latter 
groups lesions of variable malignant potential into a single category. 
The World Health Organisation proposes a new classification with 
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours as malignant entities alongside 
adenocarcinomas.
Methods: We analysed 68 cases of pancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumours with corroborative cytology available in 47 cases over 
a 12 year period. We classified each case using C1-C5 Grad-
ing, Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology and the proposed 
World Health Organisation classification for pancreatic lesions. 
We assessed the Ki-67 grading and presence of poor prognostic 
factors including vascular or perineural invasion and resection 
status.
Results: Cytological assessment reported 80.4% of lesions as IVB 
on Papanicolaou grading and 76% as C5 lesions. 73.1% of resected 
tumours were grade 1, 19.4% grade 2 and 7.5% grade 3. Overall 
staging using TNM8 showed 44.8% of lesions were T1, 31.3% 
T2, 19.4% T3 and 4.5% T4. 10 cases (14.9%) showed lymph node 
involvement. Complete resection was achieved in 83.6% of cases. 
Vascular invasion was seen in 29.9% of cases and perineural inva-
sion in 9%. 32 biopsies had both cytology grade and histological 
grade reported and this was concordant in 87.5% of cases. 1 multi-
focal tumour was reported which was non-concordant highlighting 
the importance of clinicopathological correlation following biopsy 
sampling.
Conclusion: Standardised reporting systems are an impor-
tant tool facilitating effective communication on a national 
and international level. The Papanicolaou system uses a 
pragmatic approach to distinguish these lesions from more 
aggressive entities to offer flexibility in management however 
the updated WHO system removes this distinction. It may be 
beneficial to use the new WHO low risk and high risk pan-
creatic neoplasm categories to promote discussion on the risk 
to benefit ratio of surgery for these lesions whilst effectively 
risk stratifying patients.

What is the risk of malignancy associated with diagnostic cat-
egories of proposed World Health Organization international 
system for reporting pancreaticobiliary cytopathology?
P.U. Göçün, B. Simsek*, Ö. Ekinci, N. Ekmen, M. Arhan, T. Kara-
kan, M. İbiş, M. Cindoruk
*Gazi Univercity Medical School Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: The Papanicolaou Society of 
Cytopathology(PSC) reporting system for pancreaticobiliary cytol-
ogy has 6 categories(I-VI) providing risk assessment and guidance for 
patient management. World Health Organization(WHO) proposed an 
updated reporting system. Risk of malignancy(ROM) of new categories 
of WHO system needs defining.
Methods: 420 pancreatic ESU-FNA materials from 410 patient 
from our archive from the last 12 years have been reviewed and 
categorized both according to the PSC and proposed WHO report-
ing systems. Histological diagnosis and/or clinical follow-up of 
patients were searched from hospital’s database and risk of malig-
nancy for both systems respectively were evaluated through sta-
tistical analysis.
Results: The absolute risk of malignancy for each diagnostic 
category of the proposed WHO system were as follows: 35% for 
insufficient/inadequate nondiagnostic category, 1.0% for benign/
negative for malignancy, 69.0% for atypical, 11% for PaN-Low, 
100% for PaN-High, 91% for suspicious for malignancy, and 100% 
for malignant. Comparatively, the absolute risk of malignancy for 
the same cohort with the diagnostic categories of the PSC system 
was as follows: 34% for nondiagnostic category, 1.0% negative (for 
malignancy), 50.0% for atypical, 0.0% for neoplastic: benign, 16% 
for neoplastic: other, 5% for neoplastic: other with LGA, 100% for 
neoplastic:other with HGA, 88% for suspicious (for malignancy), 
and 100% for positive or malignant.
Conclusion: -This study has shown that, with its high 
ROM(100%), the PaN-HGA group could be included at least in 
the “suspicious for malignancy” category because these patients 
will already be managed by surgery because of risk of having 
invasive component. In our cohort, a separate group for these 
cases seems to be unnecessary.
-Inclusion of SPN and NETs in the ’’positive for malignancy’’ 
group is a justifiable decision.
-There is no need for a separate “Neoplastic:benign” category for 
SCA and lymphangioma cases.

*General Hospital of Volos, Greece
Background & objectives: To determine the cytologic interpretation 
as well as various differential diagnostic problems of Hashimoto’s thy-
roiditis that is the most common form of thyroiditis.
Methods: We analysed data on 93 patients with nodular or dif-
fuse palpable enlargement of the gland, who underwent fine nee-
dle aspiration and were diagnosed with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. 
Thyroid hormonal assay and antithyroid antibody levels were 
evaluated.
Results: Hurthle cells mostly in tissue fragments were present in all 
cases and the cellularity was variable. Histiocytes with phagocytic 
debris were present in 9 cases(9,6%), whereas follicular cells with-
out follicular pattern in 22(23,6%). All cases showed lymphocytes 
and occasional plasma cell and immunoblasts. Colloid was absent. 
Coexistence with papillary carcinoma confirmed by histology was 
found in6 (6,66%) female patients Laboratory examination revealed 
high levels of TSH and anti-peroxidase antibodies in all malignant 
cases. In 4(4,3%) patients a differential diagnosis with non Hodgkin 
lymphoma was taken into account but immunocytology confirmed 
the reactive nature of the lymphocytes.
Conclusion: Hashimoto’s thyroiditis diagnosis can be achieved 
in the majority of cases. Careful interpretation of fine needle 
aspiration material and correct evaluation of all cytomorphologi-
cal findings are required in order to minimize potential pitfalls. 
Papillary carcinoma and non Hodgkin lymphoma have to be ruled 
out in some cases. The differential diagnosis includes also fol-
licular and Hurthle cell neoplasms.

Mediastinal metastases diagnosed by endobronchial ultra-
sound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration. Beyond lung 
cancer metastases
P. García Abellás*, R. Meléndez Gispert, A. Ferrer Gómez, A. 
Caminoa-Lizarralde Aiza, A. Benito Berlinches
*Ramón y Cajal University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided trans-
bronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is increasingly used in the 
diagnostic and staging of mediastinal lymph node metastases. The cyto-
logical diagnosis of metastases from extrapulmonary primaries can be 
challenging if we only consider a pulmonary origin.
Methods: A retrospective review of EBUS-TBNA specimens with 
clinical and radiological diagnosis of mediastinal lymph node metas-
tases (PET-CT SUV max >2,5) from the Pathology Department files of 
our institution between 2018-2021 was performed. In total, 179 patients 
were included. In all cases, an immunocytochemical study was done in 
order to determine the origin of the neoplasm.
Results: A lung origin was confirmed in 146 of the studied 
cases (81.5%). The diagnosis of the cases with an extrathoracic 
primary tumour was confirmed in 19 cases (10.6%). Metas-
tases of mammary (n=6); prostate (n=2); colorectal (n=2); 
urothelial (n=3) and mesenquimal(n=2) origin were observed. 
Despite the complementary studies, a definitive origin could 
not be reached in 14 cases. Enteroid pattern adenocarcinomas 
(n=1) and squamous adenocarcinomas in patients with a previ-
ous history of primary urothelial (n= 3) and cervical neoplasia 
(n=2) supposed a difficult differential diagnosis. Also muci-
nous neoplasms mimicking a gastro-biliary-pancreatic origin 
(n=3), acinar patterns (n=2) resembling prostate adenocarci-
nomas and neuroendocrine neoplasm without known primary 
(n=3) implied a diagnostic challenge.
Conclusion: Advanced target therapies in lung cancer force 
pathologists to optimize the material obtained in EBUS-TBNA 
procedures for molecular study. A comprehensive review of the 
cytological features may help recognising the origin of the neo-
plasm. However, an holistic view of the patient clinical history 
and immunocytochemical or even molecular techniques are also 
needed, specially if extrathoracic metastatic cases are suspected.

Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in fine 
needle aspiration cell blocks of head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma and its cytohistological concordance
S.K. Lou*, H. Ruff, C. Cheung
*University Health Network, Canada
Background & objectives: PD-L1 immunoexpression in head 
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) determines immu-
notherapy eligibility. Patients are often diagnosed using fine needle 
aspiration (FNA) of metastatic lymph nodes, however, the cytohis-
tologic correlation of the combined positive score (CPS) is largely 
unknown.
Methods: This study retrospectively identified 43 patients, 
between 2016 and 2020, with HNSCC diagnosed on surgical (SpS) 
and cytologic specimen (CyS). Slides were reviewed and cases with 
<100 tumour cells or if the block was missing, were excluded. This 
resulted in 36 cytology cell blocks and 39 surgical tissue blocks 
for PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (22C3 clone). All cases were 
scored with CPS.
Results: The CPS (<1%/≤20%><!--1-->20%) for the SpS and CyS 
were as follows: 2(5.9%) /17(50.0%) /15(44.1%) and 10(29.4%) 
/11(32.4%) /13(38.2%), respectively. There was a total of 34 case 
pairs, composed of 13 pairs with matched site (neck lymph nodes) 
and 21 pairs with the primary site of SCC (biopsy/resection) and 
corresponding FNA of lymph node metastasis. There was fair over-
all agreement (OA) of 76.5% (k=0.261) at a CPS cut-off of 1%. The 
OA did not differ significantly between the case pairs with matched 
and unmatched sites (p=0.4653). CyS has a specificity and positive 
predictive value (PPV) of 100%, but only a sensitivity of 75% and 
negative predictive value of 20%.
Conclusion: PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assessment on CyS 
only shows fair agreement with its surgical counterpart. However, 
CyS demonstrates high PPV with no false positive results based 
on our limited study. This needs further evaluation as our study are 
low in case with negative CPS (<1%). In the event of a negative 
CPS on CyS, a reassessment of PD-L1 on a surgical/histological 
specimen should be attempted due to the chance of a false nega-
tive result.

Background & objectives: Cervical cancer is the fourth most common 
cause of cancer in women. We aimed to assess association of high-risk 
HPV strains (other than 16 and 18) with progression from atypical 
cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) to worse cervicovaginal 
cytology.

Methods: A retrospective review of 417 consecutive patients from 
2014-2021 identified 65 patients with ASCUS cytology and high-
risk HPV strains (other than 16 and 18). Progression from ASCUS 
to low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), atypical 
squamous cell cannot rule out high grade (ASC-H), high grade 
intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or cancer in cytology was assessed 
and stratified by HPV vaccination status.
Results: A total of 65 female patients (age range = 22-71 years, 
mean age = 37.2 years) who were infected with high-risk HPV 
strains (other than 16 and 18) and had ASCUS cytology were 
included. In a follow up period ranging from 6 months to 5 years, 
50 out of the 65 patients had no progression, 12 progressed to 
LSIL, 1 had ASC-H and 2 had HSIL on Papanicolaou smears. 17 
patients received bivalent, trivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccines 
whereas only 4 patients received the nonavalent HPV vaccine. The 
rate of progression was 25% in unvaccinated patients, 19% in vac-
cinated patients and 0% amongst patients who were administered 
the nonavalent vaccine.
Conclusion: Our preliminary findings indicate a high associa-
tion of high-risk HPV strains other than 16 and 18 and progres-
sion from ASCUS to worse abnormal cervicovaginal cytology, 
especially in the patients who did not receive the nonavalent vac-
cine. Of note, ASC-H and HSIL progression was observed only 
in unvaccinated patients. We will explore these associations in 
larger population datasets to confirm our findings and potentially 
encourage utilization of the more comprehensive nonavalent HPV 
vaccine.

Atypical urothelial cells: two-year-experience with the Paris 
system for reporting urinary cytology in tertiary care centre 
pathology
I. Kholová*, E. Pöyry, V. Nykänen, E. Viljanen, J. Pulkkinen, M. 
Laurila
*Fimlab Laboratories, Finland
Background & objectives: The implementation of The Paris System 
for Reporting Urinary Cytology (TPS) emphasizes detection of high-
grade urothelial carcinomas in urine. “Atypical urothelial cells” is a 
TPS category reserved for cytological samples with mildly or moder-
ately atypical urothelial cells.
Methods: Urinary cytological specimens from the first two-
year-period (January 2017-December 2018) after TPS introduc-
tion were retrospectively analysed with cyto-histological cor-
relations. The timeframe for histological follow up was at least 
6 months.
Results: Total of 3741 urinary specimens were analysed during 
the study period with the following categorization: 49 (1.31%) 
insufficient samples, 3334 (89.12%) negative samples, 205 (5.48%) 
“atypical urothelial cells” samples, 89 (2.38%) “suspicious for 
high-grade urothelial carcinoma” samples, 62 (1.66%) cytological 
“high-grade urothelial carcinoma” samples and only two (0.05%) 
“low-grade urothelial neoplasm” samples. Out of 205 “atypical 
urothelial cells” samples, histological follow up was available in 97 
(47.32%) cases: 27 (27.84%) were low-grade urothelial carcinomas, 
34 (35.05%) high-grade urothelial carcinomas and 36 (37.11%) 
non-tumorous lesions in final histology.
Conclusion: The risk of malignancy was 29.8% in all “atypical 
urothelial cells” samples and 62.9% in histologically verified speci-
mens. Urinary cytology is a rapid, non-invasive and cost-effective 
method both in diagnosing and follow up of urothelial malignancies 
with TPS increasing its clinical value.

Fine needle aspiration biopsy of pilomatrixoma (Cytological 
features of 6 cases histologically approved)
B. Guzelbey, S. Erdogan-Durmus*
*Department of Pathology, Prof. Dr. Cemil Tascioglu City Hospi-
tal, Istanbul, Turkey
Background & objectives: Pilomatrixoma is a rare, benign skin 
adnexal tumour of hair matrix, commonly presents as a slow growing 
firm to hard intradermal or subcutaneous solitary nodule. We present 
our experience with fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of 6 histo-
logically confirmed pilomatrixoma cases.
Methods: Our series includes FNAB slides of 6 cases of pilo-
matrixoma, which were histologically approved. The slides were 
prepared by conventional method and liquid-based cytology tech-
niques. Conventional method was used to prepare the cell blocks.
Results: The ages of patients ranged from 8-63 years old. The 
male-to-female ratio was 2/1. All cases occurred in the head and 
neck area. The aspirates were cellular. The smears contained mod-
erate to high numbers of basaloid cells, anucleated squamous cells 
and debris. Basaloid cells were small and uniform. They were 
arranged in crowded groups. The chromatin was finely granular 
and consistently even in distribution. Most of the smears were rich 
in giant cells and cell debris in the background. Mitotic figures 
and sheets of ghost cells were identified as well. Five cases were 
diagnosed as pilomatrixoma and one as epidermoid/dermoid cyst.
Conclusion: Excisional biopsy is often the preferred method of 
diagnosis for the cutaneous masses. There are very few reports 
on the cytologic features of pilomatrixoma in FNAB smears. The 
combination of basaloid cells, ghost cells, squamous and giant cells 
are the key features that will allow a conclusive diagnosis of pilo-
matrixoma by FNAB.

Metastases of extrapulmonary malignancies in mediastinal 
lymph nodes sampled by Endobronchial ultrasound-guided 
transbronchial needle aspiration
S. Erdogan-Durmus*, A.B. Goktas, Z.B. Erdem
*Department of Pathology, Prof. Dr. Cemil Tascioglu City Hospi-
tal, Istanbul, Turkey
Background & objectives: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided trans-
bronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is also useful method for 
detecting metastases of extrapulmonary malignancies (EPM) as well as 
metastases of lung cancer. We aimed to analyse the cytomorphological 
and immunohistochemical features of EPM metastases in mediastinal 
lymph nodes.
Methods: The 375 EBUS-TBNA samples were analysed retrospec-
tively that reported by a cytopathologist in an 18-month period. 
Demographic data and clinical information were obtained from 
pathology reports. The slides were prepared by conventional 
method and liquid-based cytology techniques. Conventional 
method was used to prepare the cell blocks.
Results: Of the 375 EBUS-TBNAs, 147 (39.2%) were mediastinal 
LN metastases from lung cancer, 10 (2.7%) were metastases from 
EPM, two (0.5%) were lymphoma, and 199 (53.1%) were benign. 
The mean age metastasis of EPM was 67.2 (range: 52-86) with a 
male-to-female ratio 3:2.
The distribution of metastases from EPM as follows: adenocar-
cinoma of gastrointestinal tract: 3, breast carcinoma: 2, prostatic 
adenocarcinoma: 2, renal cell carcinoma: 2, and papillary thyroid 
carcinoma: 1. Immunohistochemical study was performed in 9 of 
10 cases. Cell block was not formed in one case. Most used immu-
nohistochemical marker was TTF-1 (n:9).

Conclusion: EBUS-TBNA is an effective and useful procedure 
in detecting EPM metastases as well as lung cancer metastases in 
mediastinal lymph nodes. It should be kept in mind that there may 
be EPM metastases to this region even in cases with unknown pri-
mary, and additional studies will be useful when necessary.

Standardization of p16/ki-67 immunocytochemistry in conven-
tional cervical cytology for detection of high-grade cervical 
squamous intraepithelial lesion
A. Pineda, I. Benedetti*, L. Barrios
*Universidad de Cartagena, Colombia
Background & objectives: Detection of p16/Ki-67 expres-
sion increases the cervical liquid based cytology performance 
to diagnose high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HISL). 
Scarce studies have evaluated its use in conventional cytology, the 
screening test used in women <30 years in many Latin American 
countries.
Methods: The implementation of p16/Ki-67 dual staining was 
evaluated in conventional cervical cytology smears with HSIL, 
with a corresponding confirmatory biopsy study. Xylene pretreat-
ment of the smears was carried out to remove the coverslip, before 
discoloration, rehydration and antigen retrieval. The dual-staining 
protocol was followed with different incubation times of the pri-
mary antibodies, in areas with morphologically altered cells, previ-
ously demarcated.
Results: Were included 40 smears with median storage of 233 
days. Most of the slides (80%) required a previous time in xylene 
of two days. There were no statistically significant differences 
in p16/Ki-67 dual staining in relation to results of conventional 
cytology, nor with the histopathological diagnosis. Also not in 
comparison with the slides storage time, the time previously 
required in xylene, or the incubation time of the primary antibod-
ies. Comparing p16/Ki-67 dual staining with cytological results, 
it was positive in 75% of the cytologies reported as HSIL; regard-
ing histopathology, it was observed in 61.5% of the cases with 
diagnosis of HSIL/CIN2, and in 81.2% of the cases diagnosed 
as HSIL/CIN3.
Conclusion: The p16/Ki-67 dual staining can be performed on 
archival conventional cervical cytologies with good results. The 
techniques for the pretreatment of these smears are varied but 
effective, and for an optimal result the staining protocol should 
be followed according to the manufacturer recommendations. 
Considering the wide use of conventional cytology in Latin 
America, and the scarcity of studies on the usefulness of p16/
Ki-67 dual staining in this type of smears, it is necessary to 
continue research in this field.

Secondary thyroid tumours in fine needle aspiration cytology: 
Finding the black cat in a coal cellar!
I.P. Thayakaran*, T. Patel
*Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, India
Background & objectives: Despite the rarity, secondary thyroid 
tumours(STT) can mimic the commoner primary thyroid tumours chal-
lenging the cytopathologist who serves as primary diagnostician in the 
initial workup of thyroid disease. We aim to review our experience and 
analyse STT with cytopathologic correlates.
Methods: Retrospective study between a 13 year 
period(2009-2021). Secondary thyroid tumours were defined 
as non thyroid-epithelial origin tumours which included either 
metastasis or direct extension from adjacent organ into thyroid 
parenchyma. Thirty-three cases of STT were found from archives. 
Clinical history, age, gender, radiologic and cytologic features 
were noted. Validation of cytologic diagnosis was made by 
immunocytochemistry(cell blocks) or on biopsy.
Results: The most common site of origin was head and 
neck(15/33). Age ranged between 4–80 years(median 55) with 
slight male predilection(M:F ratio 1.6:1). Most presented as a 
solitary nodule within the thyroid(23/33) with a concomitant 
primary in the vicinity or distant area. Metastatic disease 
elsewhere at presentation was seen in majority(17/33). Exclu-
sive presentation as carcinoma of unknown primary in thyroid 
was seen in one-fourth(8/33). None of the cases underwent 
thyroidectomy. Chemotherapy was used to treat hematopoi-
etic neoplasms(8/33). The interval from primary diagnosis to 
thyroid metastasis varied between 0-6 years. Diagnostic chal-
lenges surfaced when distinguishing squamous cell carcinoma 
from high grade/anaplastic thyroid carcinoma and metastatic 
adenocarcinoma from follicular thyroid lesions.
Conclusion: New findings from our research include 
predominance of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
attributable to geographic variation and STT presenting 
substantially as solitary thyroid mass. Few unusual tumours 
like langerhans cell histiocytosis, thymic carcinoma and large 
cell carcinoma were encountered. FNAC is indispensable 
in diagnostic workup of STT. Distinction between primary 
versus secondary thyroid tumour has divergent clinical 
implications, mandating high precision diagnosis. Thorough 
clinicoradiologic correlation with cytomorphologic subtleties, 
use of ancillary techniques(cell block, immunocytochemistry) 
ensures optimal patient management.

Pathologist-performed palpation-guided fine needle aspiration 
cytology of head and neck masses including oral lesions: impact 
on sample adequacy and the importance of obtaining cell blocks 
for diagnostic accuracy
M. Erdal*, F. Aker, Z. Özcan
*Haydarpaşa Numune Training and Research Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) 
is a simple, feasible, safe, inexpensive method in diagnostic, surgical, 
therapeutic approaches to superficial head and neck masses. Here, we 
share the data from our practice and point at the role of pathologists 
during FNAC procedure.
Methods: A total of 124 FNAC (on 121 patients), were performed 
without ultrasound guidance in our pathology department by an 
experienced (25+ years) fine-needle aspiration (FNA) pathologist 
(*) for palpable masses from January 2015 to March 2022, and 
were reviewed according to the anatomic location (oral cavity, soft 
tissues, lymph nodes and salivary glands).
Results: Three out of 124 FNACs (2.4%) were non-diagnostic 
(acellular). 12 (9.7%), 19 (15.3%), 48 (38.7%) and 45 (36.3%) 
were from the oral cavity, salivary glands, lymph nodes and 
soft tissue; respectively. A total of 106 cell blocks (85.4%) 
were obtained. Of these 106 cases; immunohistochemistry was 
studied in 37 (34.9%), histochemistry in 9 (8.5%) and in situ 
hybridization in 13 (12.2%). Histological data (follow-up 
resection specimens and/or cell blocks obtained from FNACs) 
were obtained in 114 cases (91.9%).

Conclusion: In conclusion, our data supports that pathologist-
performed FNAC is an important part of the initial evaluation 
in patients presenting with a head and neck mass, and helps in 
avoiding unnecessary surgical procedures with high diagnostic 
accuracy. During the FNAC session, the pathologist examines 
the patient, takes a good clinical history, performs the aspira-
tion procedure, prepares the slides with rapid on-site assess-
ment, checks the adequacy, and then continues the process until 
sufficient material is obtained to ultimately make a diagnosis.

taki*, R. Papamichali, K. Zacharouli, E. Panteliadou, M. Ioannou,

*Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health 
Sciences, University of Thessaly, Greece
Background & objectives: Urine cytology used for monitoring of 
Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) has low sensitivity for 
low-grade tumours, which present FGFR3 mutations. These activat-
ing mutations were examined in urine processed with THIN PREP, as 
potential biomarker to improve cytology performance.
Methods: We examined 38 urine specimens in THIN PREP. Α slide 
for cytology was prepared and the remaining sample was used for 
DNA isolation. Exons 7 and 10 of FGFR3 gene harbouring hot spot 
mutations were amplified by PCR and analysed by direct sequenc-
ing. Molecular results were compared with cytology reported 
according to Paris system and were correlated to histology.
Results: Cytology was performed in urine samples of 38 patients; 
26 cases were classified as high-grade urothelial carcinoma 
(HGUC), 6 as atypical urothelial cells (AUC) and 6 as suspicious 
for high-grade urothelial carcinoma (SHGUC). Sequence analysis of 
both exons 7, 10 of the FGFR3 gene was performed. Exon 10 analy-
sis revealed no mutations. However, 4 patients had a c.746C>G 
substitution leading to p.S249C mutation at exon 7 of FGFR3 
gene. Cytology report was AUC in two of them and SHGUC in the 
remaining two. The corresponding histology showed low- and high-
grade carcinomas in three and one cases, respectively. None of the 
patients classified as HGUC had FGFR3 mutations.
Conclusion: Urine cytology is useful for detecting HGUC, whereas 
AUC does not provide specific information and may include low-
grade tumours. We found that FGFR3 activating mutation p.S249C 
in exon 7 is present mostly in low-grade carcinomas and excep-
tionally in high-grade carcinomas. This preliminary study shows 
that a cytomorphology-molecular co-test in the same urine sample 
could contribute to define the atypical and suspicious categories 
of cytology by depicting low-grade tumours. Thus, a more precise 
stratification of patients can be achieved.

Cytological rapid on-site evaluation in pulmonary biopsies: 
optimizing material and accelerating diagnosis

Pagès Barón, A. Castillo Gandía, J. García-Gómez, P. Serra Mitjà, 
A.J. Solis Solis, M. Ávila Terzi
*Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Spain
Background & objectives: The in situ cytological assessment of pul-
monary biopsies obtained by different techniques allows evaluating the 
quality and quantity of the material obtained, avoiding reintervention 
especially in hard-to-reach lesions and speeding up the definitive 
diagnosis.
Methods: We present a prospective study of 23 cases comparing 
the in situ assessment of the imprint of the biopsy with the final 
delayed diagnosis. The rapid on site evaluation (ROSE) technique 
was performed by fixing the imprint in alcohol and staining for 
1 minute with haematoxylin. A cytotechnician and a cytologist 
evaluated the sample (65% of them through telecytopathology).
Results: Cases were classified as positive, negative, insufficient, 
suspicious of neoplasia and undetermined. A concordance of 82.6% 
was reached between both methods (19/23 cases). There was only 
one case with disagreement between ROSE and the definitive 
diagnosis: the former classified as negative and the latter positive 
(squamous cell carcinoma). ROSE was not conclusive in 13% cases 
(3/23): one of them suspicious for carcinoma with a final diagnosis 
of infiltrating adenocarcinoma, a second one undetermined with 
a diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma and the last one with 
insufficient material in the imprint to reach a proper orientation 
that resulted in a negative diagnosis for neoplasia.
Conclusion: Carrying out an in situ cytological assessment of lung 
biopsies is a practical approach that is usually concordant with the 
definitive diagnosis and could facilitate and optimize the obtention 
of an adequate sample to avoid extra intervention by evaluating 
the adequacy of the sample. Thus, an adequate and representative 
sample of the lesion facilitates a more accurate morphological, 
immunohistochemical and molecular study, leading to an important 
impact in prognosis and targeted treatment of patients in the era of 
personalized medicine.

Clinical trial: a new method for preparing cell blocks from 
paucicellular aspirates
O. POP*, C.A. Sanda, A.E. Stefan, D. Gologan, S. Musat, M.O. 
Leavitt, A. Jakob
*University of Oradea, Romania
Background & objectives: Multiple methods have been historically 
utilized for obtaining cell blocks with significant variation and lack of 
reproducibility. Complex, time-consuming steps generate high losses of 
cellular material whilst the low yield of sections precludes evaluating 
coordinate immunoreactivity patterns on serial sections.
Methods: The CytoPod™ method for cell blocks employs a con-
cave nitrocellulose filter affixed to a perforated sectionable matrix 
and vacuum filtration for capturing cellular material. Clinical sam-
ples such as: EBUS-TBNA, BAL, bronchial and pleural aspirates 
and ascites fluid were processed in duplicate into cell blocks using 
both the Thermo Scientific Shandon Cytoblock and the CytoPod™ 
systems.
Results: After the preliminary steps of washing/concentrating the 
aspirates (if needed) both methods allowed the preparation of cell 
blocks. Remarkably, the CytoPod™ method performed with low- to 
substantially zero-cell losses, was compatible with all usual fixa-
tives and from each paraffin block over 150 serial sections were 
obtained. Even with very low volume samples (<1 mL) and cel-
lularity (<100,000 cells) the diagnostic material was distributed 
uniformly on both the bottom and along sidewalls of the filter. 
Serial sectioning was undemanding while reading the slides proved 
expeditious due to predictable cellularity and layout of the diag-
nostic material within the sectionable matrix. No interference with 
IHC and ISH was observed.
Conclusion: Cell blocks from paucicellular aspirates are a cost-
effective option in cytopathology and can be comparable in diag-
nostic value to FFPE from biopsy. Such a practice in a universal 
fashion would result in reproducible results with interinstitutional

comparability and would yield valuable results of ancillary studies 
( IHC and molecular tests) as well as an excellent archival material. 
This is highly significant due to the increasing number of tests with 
direct impact on targeted therapy, in the personalized medicine.

Cervical atrophy as a pitfall for cytological diagnosis: a 5-year 
study from a tertiary centre in Lisbon
M. Pinho*, R. Moiteiro da Cruz, T. André Sousa Oliveira, J. Boav-
ida, R. Luís
*Department of Pathology - Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN; 
Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal
Background & objectives: Atrophy is a well-documented diagnostic 
pitfall for squamous cell lesions in cervical cancer screening in peri- 
and post-menopausal women. This study aims to evaluate the screening 
accuracy in women aged 45-years or older to determine whether aging 
affects cytological interpretation.
Methods: We reviewed all cervical cytology reports, spanning 
through 2017-2021 and pertaining to women ≥45 years. A cor-
relation of Bethesda categories of “Negative for Intraepithelial 
Lesion/Malignancy’’ (NILM) with reported atrophy, “Atypical 
Squamous Cells cannot exclude high-grade” (ASC-H) and “High-
grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion” (HSIL) with subsequent 
histological studies were performed. High-risk HPV co-testing 
results (Cobas®) were additionally recorded.
Results: A total of 226 cytological diagnoses and matched histo-
logical evaluations (taken simultaneously or up to 24 months prior) 
were assessed. In instances with multiple tissue specimens, the 
higher-grade diagnosis was recorded; samples insufficient for diag-
nosis were excluded. The risk of malignancy (ROM) ranged from 
13.1% to 80.6% in negative and positive categories, respectively; 
the performance analysis revealed a sensitivity of 93.0%, a speci-
ficity of 62.4%, a positive predictive value of 80.6% and a negative 
predictive value of 86,9%. When intraepithelial lesion was present, 
HPV-16 was detected in 29.5% and HPV-18 in 3.6% of cases.
Conclusion: Overall, as a cervical cancer screening, cytology 
shows a good sensitivity with a lower specificity, as expected. 
Although Bethesda criteria accurately define atrophy, it is 
important to be aware that these benign changes can lead both 
to overdiagnosis, mostly by overvaluing slight changes, and 
underdiagnosis, by dismissing cytological atypia.

Added value of cell block over liquid-based cytology alone in 
the diagnosis of non-necrotizing lymphadenopathy on endo-
scopic ultrasound–guided-transbronchial needle aspiration of 
mediastinal lymph nodes for sarcoidosis investigation
C. Saglietti*, E. Hewer
*Institute of Pathology, Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland
Background & objectives: Endoscopic ultrasound–guided-transbron-
chial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for sarcoidosis investigation can 
be evaluated by conventional cytology, liquid-based cytology (LBC) 
and cell block (CB), with few data published about their performance. 
We reviewed our case history for discordant results between CB and 
LBC.
Methods: We reviewed all of the cases addressed over the last year 
for investigation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with suspicion 
of sarcoidosis, for which patients had signed the general consent 
for research in our institution. We identified four patients who had 
undergone EBUS-TBNA. All of them were also investigated by 
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Flow cytometry was performed on 
BAL with lymphocytosis.
Results: We recovered 4 patients (4 males; mean age: 50 years) 
with a total of 9 TBNAs of mediastinal lymph nodes. For all 
of the TBNAs, no granuloma was observed on LBC slides (in 
two cases, only histiocytes were present). CB was done for 8/9 
TBNA (89%); in 7/8 cases (88%), granulomas were seen on the 
CB in the absence of necrosis, thus leading to the diagnosis of 
non-necrotizing lymphadenopathy in 4/4 patients. On BAL, two 
patients showed lymphocytosis with mildly increased CD4+/
CD8+ (3.9 and 3.08; reference range: 1.3–3).
Conclusion: The addition of CB in the processing of EBUS-TBNA 
performed in the context of sarcoidosis investigation in patients 
with mediastinal lymphadenopathy can help to detect the presence 
of granulomas, which may otherwise not be present on LBC slides. 
As not all laboratories routinely perform CB in tandem with LBC 
preparations, this may represent a diagnostic pitfall. We therefore 
recommend that a CB be performed on EBUS-TBNA in this par-
ticular context.

Random rescreening 10% of negative cervicovaginal smears: 
method for quality assurance
F. Ozden*
*Department of Pathology, Istanbul Medipol University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Laboratories use different methods of 
quality assurance for cervicovaginal smears. Random rescreening of 
%10 of negative gynaecologic smears is one of the effective methods 
for decreasing false negativity. In this study, we presented our single-
institution data.
Methods: All negative gynaecologic smears diagnosed over 
29 months are included in this study. We plan the review of the 
smears weekly. We randomly select 10% of negative smears and 
distribute them crosswise among pathologists. If any discrepancy 
occurs between primary and secondary screeners, we try to reach 
a consensus on the diagnosis by including tertiary or quaternary 
assessments.
Results: Twenty-eight thousand five hundred twelve smears were 
negative, and 10% were rescreened between November 1, 2019, 
and March 31, 2022. Of these rescreened ones, sixteen of them 
were evaluated as false negatives. Eleven were reported as atypical 
squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), four as 
low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), and one as 
adenocarcinoma.
Conclusion: Random rescreening 10% of negative smears can 
effectively improve laboratory performance and decrease false-
negative numbers. Unlike other studies and practices, we do not 
sign out reports of these selected smears that will be rescreened 
and wait for the consensus if any discrepancy occurs. So this study 
can be considered not a retrospective study but rather a prospective 
practice of our institution.

women > 30 years since 2018. The aim of this study is to analyse the 
detection of CIN2+ cases within the new screening protocol.
Methods: HPV detection is performed by Cobas-HPV Test (Roche) 
with cytology as triage test. Colposcopy is indicated when cytol-
ogy is positive (ASC-US or worse), and in HPV16 and/or 18 cases. 
Cross-referencing of the HPV screening database and the anatomic 
pathology database was performed, in order to obtain the CIN2+ 
detection rate.
Results: HPV test was positive in 16.2 % (n=10,239) of women 
(range: 22.2% in 30-35 y.o, to 8 % in 51-65 y,). CIN2+ lesions were 
detected in: 15.9% of HPV16±others, 5.2% of HPV18±others and 
in 2.6% of non 16/18 HPV. Among HPV+ women 30 to 35 y.o., 
CIN2+ lesions were more frequent (23.4%) than in >35y.o. ones 
(18%).
Conclusion: HPV based cervical cancer screening in our region 
has diminished more than 80% the number of cytologies, however 
more than 50% of them have abnormalities detected. The proto-
col has shown a PPV of HPV for CIN2+ higher in HPV 16/18+ 
women (38 %) than in non-HPV16/18+ (14%). These results are 
in accordance with those in other countries and validate the new 
screening protocol.

O. Ondic, R. Bhan, K. Pivovarcikova, A. Gurung
*University of British Columbia, Canada
Background & objectives: Atypia of Undetermined Significance/
Follicular Lesion of Undetermined Significance (AUS/FLUS) is 
a challenging category comprised of a heterogeneous group of 
lesions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the malignancy 
rate of thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) diagnosed as AUS/
FLUS.
Methods: This is a retrospective population-based study of all 
thyroid FNAs diagnosed as AUS/FLUS in Fraser Health in Greater 
Vancouver area during a six-year period (2014-2019). FNA diag-
noses were correlated with clinical outcome in subsequent years 
including repeat FNA, surgery, and clinical/imaging follow-up. 
Clinical and radiologic factors were compared to identify malig-
nancy-related features.
Results: A total of 443 cases of AUS/FLUS were included. Repeat 
FNA was performed on 222/443 (50.1%) nodules, and 187/443 
(42.2%) underwent surgery. The overall incidence of malignancy 
when a diagnosis AUS/FLUS is rendered in our study was 11.5% 
(51/443). Fifty one of 187 patients (27.3%) who underwent surgery 
had malignant thyroid carcinoma (38 papillary, 8 follicular, 5 with 
medullary, poorly-differentiated or anaplastic carcinoma). There 
were no statistically significant differences in age, sex and nodule 
size between benign and malignant cases. The rate of malignancy 
was 12.6% (28/222) in patients who underwent immediate sur-
gery following the first AUS/FLUS diagnosis, while it was 10.4% 
(23/221) in patients who underwent repeat FNA (P=0.2).
Conclusion: The malignancy rate of AUS/FLUS in the study is 
consistent with the recommended range proposed by the 2017 
Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology. Demo-
graphic and radiologic findings were not significantly associated 
with upgrade malignancy risk. No significant difference was found 
in malignancy risk between those who underwent immediate sur-
gery versus patients who underwent surgery after a repeat FNA 
following the initial diagnosis of AUS/FLUS.

Liquid-based cytology in the detection of premalignant lesions 
in patients with "Atypia in Squamous Cells" in conventional 
cytology
Y. Vizcaino, L. Barrios, I. Benedetti*
*Universidad de Cartagena, Colombia
Background & objectives: Management of "Atypical Squamous 
Cells" (ASC) in conventional cytology (CC) is based on the risk of 
High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL). Efficacy of 
liquid-based cytology (LBC) to detect HSIL is variable, with little 
evidence of its performance in Colombian patients.
Methods: Were obtained patients who attended colposcopy clinic 
due result of ASC in CC. A cervical sample for LBC was obtained 
from these patients which was interpreted by two pathologists with-
out access to other results. The performance of LBC to detect HSIL 
was determined considering colposcopic/histological diagnosis as a 
gold standard: negative-satisfactory colposcopy/histopathological 
report. Two age groups were compared (<30/≥30 years).
Results: Were included 114 patients, with previous report of ASC-
US in CC, (there were no reports of ASC-H), with a mean age 
of 38.4 years (SD ± 13.3). LBC had abnormal results in 40.36% 
(n=46), with slightly higher proportion of Low-Grade Squamous 
Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL) than HSIL. The total of abnormal 
diagnoses by colposcopy and/or biopsy was 51.75% (n=59) with 
a predominance of LSIL (36.84%). The sensitivity of the liquid-
based cytology to detect premalignant lesions was 76.5%, specific-
ity: 66.0%, positive predictive value: 28.3% and negative predictive 
value: 94.1%. The Cohen’s Kappa index of LBC for detecting HSIL 
was 0.2492 for the total population and 0.2907 for ≥ 30 years.
Conclusion: This is the first prospective study conducted in 
Colombian patients with abnormal ASC cervical cytology to assess 
the diagnostic performance of LBC and CPS in detecting HSIL 
compared to histopathology. It can be concluded that although LBC 
decreases the total number of abnormal cytology and increases the 
detection of HSIL, improving diagnostic precision and decreasing 
the number of ASC-US, its concordance with the gold standard is 
discreet, being higher to detect HSIL especially in patients aged 
30 years or older.

Background & objectives: The Sidney System for reporting lymph 
node FNA has standardized the diagnostic procedure. We present one 
of the few case series exploring the usefulness of this classification in 
EBUS-TBNA specimens.
Methods: Over a 3-year period, EBUS-TBNA attended by the 
interventional pathologist were quantified. Patient demograph-
ics, number of passes, and procedure time, among other variables, 
were recorded. A modification of the touch imprint cytology and 
ROSE methodology was used for on-site validation of the cell 
block sample.

Results: 402 mediastinal lymph node FNA were performed. 69% 
male. Mean age 65 years old (range 19 - 90). Mean number of 
passes 3.14 (range 1 - 8). Mean procedure time 25.33 minutes 
(range 10 - 90). Mean number of cytological smears 13.03 (range 
3 - 38). Sydney System first level diagnostic categories: I: 4.48%; 
II: 36.82%; III: 0%; IV: 0%; V: 58.71%. Immediate sample man-
agement (microbiology, molecular tests, flow cytometry, etc.) 
was necessary in 33% of cases. The most frequent diagnosis of 
malignancy was metastatic lung carcinoma (218 patients - second 
diagnostic level).
Conclusion: To date, few scientific publications have high-
lighted the usefulness of the Sydney System in the categoriza-
tion and diagnosis of lymph node FNA. The results obtained 
(with less than 5% of insufficient samples) support the appli-
cability of this classification system in samples obtained by 
EBUS-TBNA. We consider the modified touch imprint cytology 
plus ROSE methodology (which allows validation of the repre-
sentativeness of the cell block) to be a key step in achieving the 
results obtained.

Cutaneous metastases from non-primary skin tumours
I. Bernal Simón*, Y.P. Rodríguez Velandia, N.M. Segués Merino, 
M.A. Juaristi Abaunz, M.Y. Silva Carmona
*Donostia University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: Cutaneous metastasis (CM) accounts for 
only 2% of all skin neoplasms. They occur infrequently and usually 
during the late stages of cancer with poor prognosis. The objective is 
to analyse the different types of CM, their location and survival.
Methods: We reviewed skin biopsies of cancer patients 
diagnosed with CM between January 2006 and February 2022 
at Donostia University Hospital in Spain. Patients with primary 
skin cancer and haematological malignancies were excluded. 
We collected the following data: patient age and sex, the time 
of cancer diagnosis and CM, location of CM, type of cancer 
and survival outcome.
Results: We included 16 patients, aged between 48 and 93 years 
(mean 68), of whom 11 were women and 5 men. Breast cancer was 
the most common primary cancer (6 cases), followed by gastric 
adenocarcinoma (3 cases) and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (2 
cases). Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine tumour 
of the lung and arytenoid cartilage, hepatocellular carcinoma and 
endometrial serous carcinoma were also found. The most frequent 
locations for CM were head, neck and chest. Although most skin 
metastases were solitary, patients presented with advanced-stage 
cancer with other visceral metastases. Only five patients are still 
alive.
Conclusion: Cutaneous metastases have an incidence of 0.7% to 
9%. In general, men are more commonly affected than women, 
and most patients are aged between 50 and 70 years. In our study, 
women are the most affected patients with breast cancer. The most 
typical locations were scalp, neck and trunk. Despite CM being 
a sign of poor prognosis may not always indicate a poor survival 
outcome and depends on each type of cancer.

Acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis and generalised 
pustular psoriasis: differential diagnosis in the report of 2 cases

Cardoso
*Pathology Unit, Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Centro 
Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Acute generalized exanthematous pustu-
losis (AGEP) and generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) share clinical 
and histopathological similarities, and their classification as separate 
entities or as diseases within the same spectrum remains controversial. 
We describe two cases highlighting this diagnostic challenge.
Methods: Case A: 36 year-old man presented a generalized pus-
tular eruption with an erythematous background, especially on 
the trunk with involvement of the limbs and face, after COVID19 
vaccination. Fever and peripheral blood leukocytosis were also 
present.
Case B: 72 year-old man, previously diagnosed with psoriasis, had 
a widespread eruption of sterile pustules on an erythematous back-
ground, without constitutional symptoms associated.
Results: Case A. Histopathological examination revealed an 
acanthotic epidermis with occasional exocytosis of neutrophils, 
reaching the upper layers and the stratum corneum. There was also 
focal intraepidermal and subcorneal detachment with haemorrhage, 
neutrophils and eosinophils. The dermis presented a mixed inflam-
matory infiltrate surrounding vascular and neural structures. Direct 
immunofluorescence showed granular non-specific IgA deposition 
at the dermal-epidermal junction.
Case B: Microscopical examination presented an epidermis with 
moderate acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, hypogranulosis 
and intraepidermal and subcorneal pustules at different stages of 
development. There was also a dermal mixed inflammatory infil-
trate with numerous neutrophils and haemorrhage.
Conclusion: Case A was diagnosed as AGEP; despite the overlap 
with pustular psoriasis, the clinical information, the small intraepi-
dermal pustules and eosinophils favour the former diagnosis. The 
patient was treated with systemic corticosteroids with good result.
Case B was compatible with GPP, given the pre-existing diag-
nosis of psoriasis and the slightly more pronounced psoriasiform 
hyperplasia. Despite the high mortality rate associated (30%), 
our patient had a great response to treatment with acitretin, and a 
restrict follow-up.

Basal cell carcinoma with trichogerminoma-like areas, a mor-
phological and immunohistochemical study in a series of three 
cases
F. Kubba*, I. Logan
*Department of Pathology, Ealing Hospital, London North West 
University Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: We present three patients with basal 
cell carcinoma (BCC) incorporating trichogerminoma-like cell-balls 
presented as slow growing pearly nodules in a 76, 81 and 88-year-old 
patients on the temple, back and forearm. Two were ulcerated and one 
was variably pigmented.
Methods: Microscopically all BCCs were of nodular subtype. In 
addition, they showed lobules of epithelioid cells, with a rim of 
compact cells and central crowded cells expressing concentric 
whorled nuclei. They were incorporated within the main BCC 
area. One case showed clefts surrounding these cell balls with 
increased apoptosis. No significant atypia or increased mitosis 
was seen. Another showed focal keratinisation.
Results: Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining with 
cytokeratin 5/6 while BerEP4 was diffusely positive in the BCC 
and negative in trichogerminoma-like area. They were negative 
for Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA). Cytokeratin 20 did

not highlight Merkel cells in these areas. The diagnosis mainly 
depends on morphology.
Around 30 trichogerminomas were reported and are included in 
the spectrum of trichoblastomas. However, their presence within 
BCCs has not been well described or studied. These cases are not 
associated with Brook-Spiegler syndrome or any poor prognosis. 
Grainyhead-like transcription factor (GRHL1/2/3) gene rearrange-
ments including FOXK1:GRHL1/2 fusion transcripts which are 
recently reported by Kervarrec et al in trichogerminomas have not 
been yet studied in this BCC subtype.
Conclusion: We report a series of three cases of BCC with trich-
ogerminoma-like areas, which is underreported and rare BCC 
subtype.
The diagnosis is based mainly on tumour morphology expressing 
epithelioid cell balls. They also express a distinct immunohisto-
chemical profile.
Pure trichogerminomas have GRHL gene rearrangements but this 
is yet to be studied in cases associated with BBC.
Complete excision of the tumour with adequate margins is the 
treatment of choice.
There is no association with poor prognosis or Brook-Spiegler 
syndrome.

*Faculty of Medicine, University of Latvia; Riga East University 
Hospital; Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital; Hospital of 
Traumatology and Orthopaedics, Latvia
Background & objectives: The presence of tumour infiltrating lym-
phocytes is a favourable prognostic factor in cutaneous melanoma. The 
current study’s objective have been to compare the NRAS and BRAF 
mutation status with peritumoral lymphocytic infiltration and progres-
sion free survival in melanoma.
Methods: Altogether, 85 patients underwent melanoma surgical 
treatment at the Riga East University Hospital, were retrospectively 
enrolled in the study. The histopathological characteristics were 
assessed. The melanoma BRAF and NRAS mutations status were 
assessed by PCR (ddPCR). Progression-free survival (PFS) was esti-
mated with the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test. Multivar-
iate regression was analysed using Cox proportional hazards model.
Results: There were 56 cases of nodular melanoma and 29 cases 
with superficial spreading melanoma. The BRAF mutation was 
observed in 52 patients (61.2%). The BRAF mutation in mela-
noma correlated with Clark invasion level (p=0.045), patient age 
(p=0.02) and peritumoral lymphocytes (p=0.04). NRAS mutation 
was observed in 9 patients (10.6%). NRAS mutation correlated 
with Breslow thickness (p<0.0001), disease stage (p=0.002) and 
lymphovascular invasion (p=0.03). Our study showed that mela-
noma patients with BRAF mutation had significantly better pro-
gression-free survival (PFS) than patients with NRAS mutation 
(HR=4.2, 95% CI=2.8-10.4, p<0.0001). However, in patients with 
concomitant BRAF and NRAS mutation the PFS was significantly 
worse compared to patients with only BRAF or NRAS mutation.
Conclusion: To conclude, the strength of our study was the dem-
onstration of significant role of TIL and BRAF, NRAS mutational 
status in patients with stage I-II melanoma. Patients with NRAS 
mutation had significantly worse prognosis compared to patients 
with BRAF mutation. However, the increased TIL infiltration char-
acterized by better prognosis.

Clinicopathologic characteristics of BRAF V600K mutant 
malignant melanoma in comparison with V600E mutant cases: 
a preliminary study
G. Bülbül*, A.A. Ağalar, E. Yumuk, S. Cagaptay, H. Ellidokuz, 
B. Lebe
*Dokuz Eylül University Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: BRAF V600K mutation, the second most 
common mutation in malignant melanoma with a rate of 10-30%, is 
related to worse response to treatment and adverse prognosis. However, 
data for comparing V600K/V600E groups for the histopathologic and 
prognostic features are limited.
Methods: A total of 23 malignant melanoma cases with BRAF 
V600E or BRAF V600K mutations detected by pyrosequencing 
in our department were retrospectively analysed. The associations 
between the type of BRAF mutations and histopathologic, clinical 
and prognostic characteristics were statistically investigated.
Results: Of the 23 cases, 7 (30.4%) had V600K and 16 (69.6%) 
had V600E mutation. Although there was no statistical significance 
between two groups, most of the cases with V600K mutation were 
male (85.7%). In BRAF V600K mutant cases, histologic type was 
mostly superficial spreading melanoma (85.7%), tumour localiza-
tion was mostly head and neck (57.1%); ulceration and regression 
were slightly higher. In BRAF V600E mutant group, the number 
of mitosis (>10/HPF) was higher (81.3%). V600E mutant group 
was generally more advanced (pT4) at the time of diagnosis (75%). 
In survival analysis, the estimated survival time was shorter in 
patients with V600K mutation than those with V600E mutation 
(17.9 vs 33.2 months).
Conclusion: Although it’s a preliminary study and no statistical 
significance was detected due to the low number of cases, our 
results emphasize that overall survival time is almost half as 
short in V600K mutant cases than those with V600E mutation. 
Considering the prognostic differences, since the double nucleotide 
change seen in the V600K mutation(GTG to AAG) includes the 
single nucleotide change seen in the V600E mutation(GTG to 
GAG), it’s important to be careful in the evaluation to distinguish 
these two mutations.

Background & objectives: Dysplastic nevus with severe cytologic 
atypia are accepted as a significant intermediate lesion in malign mela-
noma progression. We aimed to summarize the clinicopathological 
findings of cases as diagnosed dysplastic nevus showing severe cyto-
logic atypia at a single institution.
Methods: We reviewed the pathology reports of excisional skin 
biopsies of 644 cases and 1226 lesions as diagnosed dysplastic 
nevus between 2010 and 2021, retrospectively. The cases having 
severe cytologic atypia and their clinicopathologic features were 
noted.

Results: We detected 49 lesions which have dysplastic nevus with 
severe atypia belonging to 32 cases (4%, 5%). The sizes ranged 
from 3 to 20 mm (mean=8.1 mm). The locations of lesions were 
as follows; trunk: 38; head: 5; lower extremities: 4, upper extrem-
ities:1, unknown: 1. While 43 of 49 lesions showed compound 
morphology (87.8%), 6 of 49 lesions showed junctional morphol-
ogy (12.2%). At the time of the initial diagnosis; 3 patients had 
malign melanoma (9.3%), 14 patients had multiple dysplastic nevus 
(43.7%), histopathologically. 8 of the patients with multiple dys-
plastic nevus had severe cytologic atypia. The number of dysplastic 
nevus in these patients was between 2 and 6.
Conclusion: Severe atypia is the most important histopathologic 
feature in terms of malign melanoma progression for dysplastic 
nevus. For this reason, after recognizing severe atypia in a dys-
plastic nevus, screening of all melanocytic lesions of the patients 
and excision of the lesions which have high risk are recommended.

Expression of IL-22 in tissue specimens of mycosis fungoides is 
associated with the involvement of FOXP3+ cells and neutro-
phils in the microenvironment

Patsatsi, T. Koletsa
*Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Aristotle Univer-
sity of Thessaloniki, Greece
Background & objectives: Recent studies suggest a significant role of 
the cellular microenvironment, as well as interleukins in mycosis fun-
goides (MF). We investigated the cellular microenvironment composi-
tion and its potential correlation with Interleukin(IL)-22 and IL-17A 
expression in MF skin lesions.
Methods: We retrospectively collected 16 MF cases of various 
disease stages, with adequate skin tissue for immunohistochemis-
try and available frozen tissue for RT-qPCR. Histological assess-
ment of eosinophils, neutrophils, CD20+, CD4+, CD8+, FOXP3+, 
CD56+ and CD1a+ cells was performed. Expression levels of 
IL-22 and IL-17 mRNA were measured by RT-qPCR. Statistical 
analysis was performed using SPSS version 25.
Results: The cases included three in patch stage, eight in plaque 
stage, and five in transformation to high-grade large cell lym-
phoma (t-LCL). Overall, eosinophils, neutrophils, and B-lym-
phocytes were absent or scarce, with the highest numbers being 
observed in t-LCL cases. IL-22 and IL-17A tissue levels were 
higher in early than in advanced stages of the disease. IL-22 
levels were associated with IL-17A levels (Pearson’s, r=0.961, 
p<0.001) and showed a statistically significant correlation with 
FOXP3+ T-regulatory cells (Pearson’s, r=0.851, p<0.001), as 
well as with neutrophil density (Pearson’s, r=0.586, p=0.014). 
No association was found between IL-17A values and the esti-
mated cells.
Conclusion: MF lesions with t-LCL present a remarkable 
different microenvironment regarding cellular composition and 
IL expression levels, compared to early MF. FOXP3+ cells may 
regulate the expression of IL-22 in the MF microenvironment. 
Investigating the role of the cellular microenvironment and certain 
cytokines, including IL-17A, and -22, in MF, can significantly 
contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis and 
progression of the disease and possibly to novel targeted therapies.

Dermatomyofibroma: a series of five cases
C. Buján Bonino, J.M. Suárez Peñaranda*
*Department of Pathology, University Hospital of Santiago de 
Compostela, Spain
Background & objectives: Dermatomyofibroma (DMF) is an infre-
quent mesenchymal benign tumour of uncertain nature. It usually 
affects young women and is preferentially located in the upper trunk. 
Its diagnosis relies on its distinct clinical, histological and immuno-
histochemical features.
Methods: We retrospectively collected five cases of DMF from the 
files of the Department of Pathology of the University Hospital of 
Santiago de Compostela. All cases had blocks and sections avail-
able for review. The demographic, clinical and immunohistochemi-
cal characteristics of the cases were studied.
Results: Cases corresponded to one male and four females, with 
ages which ranged from 4 to 48 years (average 32). Three cases 
were located in the shoulder girdle and two in the upper chest. 
They were all superficially located and diameter was around 
1cm. Treatment was conservative resection and no relapses were 
noted. Histologically, they were constituted by multiple fascicles 
of regular spindle-shaped cells parallel to the epidermis, showing 
no mitoses or pleomorphism. Immunohistochemical study was 
performed in all cases to confirm the diagnosis.
Conclusion: DMF are unusual lesions whose clinical and histologi-
cal features overlap with those of dermatofibroma (DF). Location 
in the upper part of the trunk is unusual for DF and histologically, 
the characteristic disposition of fascicles parallel to the dermo-
epidermal junction allow the differential diagnosis. Immunohis-
tochemical findings suggest not muscular, but myofibroblastic 
differentiation.

Background & objectives: Primary cutaneous CD30+ prolifera-
tive disorders (CD30+ LPD) represent second largest subcategory of 
skin lymphomas. The purpose of the study was to assess the GATA3 
expression in CD30+ LPD and its mimics for better characterization 
of malignant T cell features.
Methods: We identified 18 cases of CD30+LPD and 13 cases of 
pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA), diagnosed 
in our department between 2009 – 2022. Immunohistochemical 
staining was performed on all cases for CD4, CD8, CD30, ALK 
and GATA3. Results were compared between CD30+ LPD group 
including lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) and primary cutaneous 
anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) and PLEVA group.
Results: We identified 11 cases of Lyp (2 type A, 2 type B, 2 type 
C, 4 type D and 1 case of LyP not otherwise specified) and 7 cases 
of pcALCL. All cases of pcALCL (variable CD4/CD8; CD30+) 
and three out of four cases of LyP type D (CD4-/CD8+/CD30+) 
showed diffuse and variable positivity for GATA3 in both CD4 and 
CD8 dermal T cells and in epidermal extravasated lymphocytes. 
The rest of LyP and all PLEVA cases stained negative for GATA3. 
The correlation of the percentage of GATA3+ lymphocytes with 
CD4/CD8 profile of T cells, subgroups or age showed no statisti-
cal significance.
Conclusion: GATA3 is a transcription factor associated with LTh2 
differentiation and function and activation of CD8+ T cells, and 
our study showed GATA3 positivity in both CD4 or CD8 pre-
dominant CD30+ LPD. The tumour microenvironment remains 
unclear in CD30+ LPD but GATA3 may play a role in cytokine

local response. CD30+ LPD and PLEVA may show similar histo-
pathological patterns and may be difficult to differentiate without 
clinical data on small biopsies and GATA3 expression may be a 
clue for diagnosis.

NTRK fusion in pigmented spindle cell nevus/Reed nevus: an 
immunohistochemical study on a large multicentric Italian 
cohort

G. Tallini, D. De Biase, E. Dika, C. Ricci
*School of Anatomic Pathology, University of Bologna, Italy
Background & objectives: Pigmented spindle cell nevus/Reed 
nevus (PSCN/RN) is a Spitz nevus variant genetically characterized 
by NTRK (mainly NTRK3) gene fusions, but the data about the fre-
quency of this genomic alteration are widely discordant and range 
from 14 to 52%.
Methods: All PSCN/RN diagnosed at our institutions (February 
2017-December 2021) were collected and stained with pan-TRK 
antibody (EPR17341; rabbit monoclonal; Ventana, OptiView RED 
Detection Kit). We evaluated the percentage of positive cases and 
analysed the association between pan-TRK(+) and other clinical-
pathological features [χ2 tests for dichotomous and categorical 
data; Student t-test (normal distribution) and Mann-Whitney 
U-test (non-normal distribution) for continuous data].
Results: A total of 44 PCSN/RN were collected and histologi-
cally confirmed, according to 2018 WHO Classification of Skin 
Tumours. pan-TRK(+) was detected in 6 (13.6%) cases and exhib-
ited a specific expression pattern [cytoplasmatic, granular, dif-
fuse (4/6, 67%) or not (2/6, 33%)]. pan-TRK(+) was significantly 
associated with localization [4/6 (67%) on trunk/dorsum and 2/6 
(33%) on extremities, p=0.008] and cytological atypia [1/6 (17%) 
mild, 2/6 (33%) moderate and 3/6 (50%) high, p=0.004]; no other 
clinical-pathological features were significantly associated with 
pan-TRK(+).
Conclusion: This is the largest case series of PSCN/RN tested for 
NTRK fusions. We found that a subgroup of PSCN/RN is char-
acterized by NTRK fusions, with a percentage of positive cases 
(13-14%) similar to what was previously shown by Kervarrec T. 
et al. Furthermore, we found that PSCN/RN pan-TRK(+) are pref-
erentially localized on trunk/dorsum and extremities, and display 
moderate/high cytological atypia. We will integrate our data with 
molecular techniques to support our results and better compare 
them with previous studies.

(MCPyV) associated Merkel cell carcinomas: effects of MCPyV 
Gene expression in epithelial and lymphoid cells

opmental Biology, Maastricht University Medical Center+, The 
Netherlands
Background & objectives: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but 
deadly non-melanoma skin cancer. Although there is accumulating of 
evidence that Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) contributes to the 
etiopathogenesis of MCC, the cell of origin of MCC remains elusive.
Methods: We stably introduced MCPyV small and large tumour 
antigens in two MCPyV-negative cell lines, an epithelial and a 
leukaemia B-cell line and compared the gene expression changes 
induced thereafter. We assessed the MCPyV effects through func-
tional and pathway enrichment analysis of MCPyV-T antigens 
expressed in the cell lines with immunological and neurological 
terms and validated their expression in primary MCCs.
Results: The results revealed that in the epithelial background, the 
global effects of MCPyV T antigens are higher compared to the 
lymphoid background, mainly attributed to the higher differential 
expression of genes caused by the LT antigen. Genes upregulated 
by MCPyV sT antigen were associated with neurological gene-
ontologies in both cell lines. Key genes in neuronal development, 
differentially expressed in the lymphoid background were enriched 
in pathways that have been implicated in human cancers such. 
Validation of significantly enriched genes was assessed in the 
primary MCC cell lines and tumours, of which all genes were 
highly expressed, suggesting the involvement of MCPyV T antigens 
in regulating neuronal pathways involved in tumorigenesis.
Conclusion: We conclude that the expression of MCPyV T anti-
gens in epithelial and lymphoid background affects neurological 
pathways in both. However, more effects are seen by the introduc-
tion of sT antigen expression in the lymphoid background. These 
novel established cell lines comprise an important tool to study the 
cell of origin of MCPyV- associated MCCs.

*Moscow MCC Kommunarka, Russia
Background & objectives: Violation of the circadian rhythm is a risk 
factor for the development of melanoma. Tumours are also charac-
terized by a change in the normal daily rhythm. Micromorphometric 
parameters of B16 melanoma cells and their circadian rhythms were 
investigated.
Methods: The study was conducted on 50 male BDF1 hybrid mice 
divided into 2 equal groups. First - control, mice of the second 
group were transplanted with B16/F10 melanomas. On the 15th 
day, the animals were withdrawn from the experiment at 9.00, 
15.00, 21.00 and 3 hours. Conducted studies of micromorphometric 
parameters of tumours and their daily dynamics using cosinor 
analysis.
Results: It has been established that atypical melanocytes are 
characterized by significantly larger nuclei with a decrease in its 
elongation and contour indices with an increase in the shape factor. 
Daily fluctuations in the size of the nucleus of tumour cells are of 
a significant circadian nature, with acrophase rhythm of 7^24 in 
the control and 4^12 in the experiment at amplitudes of 1.48 and 
4.52 sq.μm, respectively. The tumour cell size circadian rhythm 
was characterized by an acrophase in 19^32 and an amplitude of 
10.07 sq.μm. According to the cosinor analysis, for the nucleo-
cytoplasmatical ratio, circadian rhythm was not significant.
Conclusion: The data obtained indicate a change in rhythmosta-
sis in mice with experimental melanoma B16. The features of the 
organization of the rhythm of the tumour itself can be used in its 
targeted experimental therapy, taking into account chronobiological 
features. The results of the study can be used for further studies of 
the effect of various lighting modes on the morphofunctional state 
of the animal organism in the pathology under study.

Background & objectives: The diagnosis of Mycosis Fongoides (MF), 
especially early MF, is challenging. It might be difficult to distinguish it 
from inflammatory disorders. Monoclonal rearrangement can be help-
ful. The aim of the study was to describe molecular aspects of MF.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective study that included 
all cases of MF confirmed by histopathological and 
immunohistochemical (IHC) examination in the Pathology 
Department in collaboration with the Dermatology Department at 
Habib Thameur Hospital of Tunisia from 2008 to 2020. Genomic 
DNA was extracted from lesional tissues and rearrangements of 
TCR-gamma chain gene were amplified using the IdentiClone 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Results: We enrolled 56 patients. The mean age at diagnosis was 
51.8 years (15 - 83 years) with a male to female ratio of 1.94. Cases 
were: 35 classic MF, 12 pilotrope MF, five CD8-positive MF, three 
granulomatous MF and one hypopigmented MF. The rearrange-
ment of the TCR-ϒ was performed in 30 cases. It was monoclo-
nal in 18/30 cases (60%) and polyclonal in 12 cases (40%). At an 
early stage, monoclonality was present in 6/13 cases (46%) and 
polyclonality in 7/13 cases (54%). Polyclonality was found in 11 
biopsies (73%) dating back more than 5 years, with a statistically 
significant association between clonality and the year the sample 
was received (p=0.05).
Conclusion: The detection of clonal TCR rearrangement can be 
helpful in establishing the diagnosis of MF. In fact, the Interna-
tional Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL) and the European 
Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) sup-
port a diagnostic algorithm for early MF which includes TCR gene 
rearrangement analysis. However, some benign and reactive inflam-
matory lesions may also have clonal rearrangement. As a result, MF 
diagnosis should be based on confrontation of clinical, histological, 
immunohistochemical, and molecular data.

*Habib Thameur Hospital Pathology Department, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The diagnosis of mycosis fungoides (MF) 
is very challenging especially at early stage. The aim of this study was 
to describe histologic and immunohistochemical presentations of MF.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 134 biopsies from 56 
patients with documented MF in patch, plaque and tumour stages.
Results: A total of 134 biopsies from 56 patients were reviewed. 
The 43 cases of early MF showed epidermotropism in 42 biop-
sies (98%), pilotropism in 37/38 (97%) and syringotropism in 
25/39 (64%). Lymphocytic dermal infiltrate was superficial and 
perivascular in 22/43 biopsies (51%). Necrotic keratinocytes were 
noted in 3/43 biopsies (9%). Band-like lymphocytic infiltrate of 
superficial dermis was seen in 30 biopsies (56.6%) at plaque stage 
and was extended to the entire dermis in 36 biopsies (26.9%) at 
tumour stage. Fibrosis of papillary dermis was observed in 90 
biopsies (67.2%). At immunohistochemistry, 129 biopsies (96.3%) 
demonstrated CD3+, CD4+ and CD8- phenotype and lack of CD7 
expression was observed in 17/22 biopsies.
Conclusion: The histologic diagnosis of MF especially at early 
stage is one of the most vexing problems in dermatopathology, 
because the histopathologic features may simulate a variety of 
inflammatory skin disorders. Immunohistochemistry can help in 
diagnosis in some cases. Hower, clinicopathological correlation 
remains the “gold standard” for making an accurate diagnosis.

Immunohistochemical staining for p16 is a useful adjunctive 
test in the diagnosis of Bowen’s disease
F. Khanchel, S. Elfekih*, H. Hammami, I. Helal, R. Hedhli, E. Ben 
Brahim, R. Jouini, A. Chadli
*Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Bowen’s disease (BD) and actinic keratosis 
(AK) are squamoproliferative disorders of the skin. Histologically, they 
may mimic each other and they might be misinterpreted. p16 has been sug-
gested to be a useful tool to make the differential diagnosis between them.
Methods: We gathered 13 cases of BD and 9 cases of AK. The 
cases were stained for p16 using standard immunohistochemical 
techniques, and the staining patterns were categorised into one of 
five different patterns of the classification proposed by Harvey.
Results: Mean age patients with BD and AK were 69 and 68 years 
respectively. All cases of BD and AK were positive to p16 with 
both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. Intensity and extension of 
staining were different between BD and AK. For BD cases, the 
anti-p16 staining was pattern 1 for 12 cases (92%) and one case 
pattern 5. Concerning AK cases, staining was pattern 2 in 5 cases, 
pattern 3 in one case and pattern 5 in one case. Immunohistochem-
istry was not contributive in one case.
Conclusion: We have confirmed the previously published find-
ings that immunohistochemistry for p16 in BD shows a consistent 
pattern of strong staining of all abnormal cells, presenting at least 
focal palisaded basal cell sparing. This pattern is not seen in AK. 
Where the staining is typically patches or scattered single cells of 
weak or moderate intensity.
We believe that p16 can serve as a useful adjunctive test in supporting 
a diagnosis of BD in difficult cases and in separating it from AK.

*Pathology Department, Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Eccrine porocarcinoma (EPC) is a rare 
malignant eccrine sweat gland tumour characterized by locally aggres-
sive growth and high rates of extracutaneous metastasis. The aim of 
this study is to describe clinical and histopathological features of EPC.
Methods: A retrospective review of medical records and histopa-
thology slides of EPC cases between January 2000 and December 
2022 was conducted using the cancer registry database of the cen-
tre of Tunisia.
Results: Eight EPC cases were included in this study. The mean 
age of diagnosis was 53.50 years (range 46-70 years) with seven 
females and one male. Systemic comorbidities were present in one 
patient. Clinically, EPC was described as ulcerated nodular lesion 
mimicking a squamous cell carcinoma in half of the cases. The 
most common localization was the scalp reported in 3 cases. Histo-
pathological analysis revealed a tumour arising from the epidermis

and showing deep anastomosing cords in the dermis. Tumour cells 
were polygonal with irregularly-shaped nuclei and numerous 
mitotic figures. Ulceration was found in four cases. Squamous cell 
differentiation was observed in five cases. Perineural invasion was 
observed in one case.
Conclusion: This study underlines that EPC is a challenging diag-
nosis and that careful clinicopathological correlation is the key to 
differentiate this malignant tumour from other skin tumours.

Ognjenović, A. Paravić Radičević, I. Glojnarić, S. Čužić
*Selvita Ltd., Croatia
Background & objectives: Chronic liver diseases of various aetiology 
lead to liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. Aim of the study was to explore pattern 
of de novo collagen 1A1 (COL1A1) deposition in two mouse models 
of liver fibrosis and to evaluate therapeutic effect of ALK5 inhibitor.
Methods: Liver fibrosis was developed in 41-days CCl4 and 
70-days high-fat diet induced models. Animals were treated 
with ALKi (SB525334); D21-D41 in CCl4 model and D29-D70 
in NASH model. De novo collagen deposition was analysed by 
hydroxyproline content, COL1A1 content (anti-COL1A1 antibody, 
#72026, CST & digital pathology software, Visiopharm). Distri-
bution of fibrous tissue was evaluated by NAFLD Activity and 
Fibrosis Score.
Results: In both models, vehicle treated disease control mice, 
showed significantly higher liver hydroxyproline level and percent-
age of COL1A1-positive area accompanied by formation of bridg-
ing fibrosis, as compared to naïve animals. Treatment with ALK5i 
significantly decreased hydroxyproline levels and percentage of 
COL1A1-positive area in liver. There was no effect of ALK5i treat-
ment on bridging fibrosis formation in CCl4-induced model. On 
the other hand, in high-fat diet model, decreased number of ani-
mals with bridging fibrosis was observed following treatment with 
ALK5i; periportal and perisinusoidal fibrosis prevailed.
Conclusion: It was shown that formation of bridging fibrosis in 
liver fibrosis model induced by high-fat diet can be influenced by 
ALK5i treatment. Influencing the pace of bridging fibrosis forma-
tion could be of utmost clinical relevance, since disrupted intrahe-
patic blood flow, due to presence of bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis, is 
a major cause of portal hypertension.

Utility of intraoperative pathology consultations during pan-
creatic surgery and impact on final margin status: a single 
institution analysis
N. Sina*, E. Olkhov-Mitsel, L. Sun, P. Roopchand, C. Rowsell,

*Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, Canada
Background & objectives: Intraoperative consultations (IOCs) are 
widely used to assess surgical margins during pancreatic resections. 
The impact of this practice on patient management is often debated. 
Herein, we reviewed the utility of IOCs and its impact on final postop-
erative surgical margin status.
Methods: Retrospective review of all patients who underwent pancrea-
ticoduodenectomy (Whipple) and distal pancreatectomy (DP) at our 
institution (2018-2020) was performed and data from pathology reports 
was recorded. From this cohort, cases of adenocarcinomas resected 
with Whipple surgeries were further analysed. A positive permanent 
margin (R1), including pancreatic, bile duct or other margins, was 
defined as margin involved by a known neoplasm.
Results: During a 3-year period, 213 Whipple and 62 DP 
procedures were performed at our institution for neoplastic lesions. 
Of these, IOCs were completed for 112 pancreatic margins and 94 
bile duct margins. Comparative analysis identified that although 
there was a significant difference in the frequency of margins 
submitted for IOC among four pancreatic surgeons (P<0.001), 
there was no significant difference in the postoperative final 
R0 rate (P=0.637 for Whipples and 0.653 for DP) for neoplastic 
lesions examined and for adenocarcinomas resected with Whipple 
surgeries, particularly (n=170, P= 0.612). Postoperative positive 
margins (R1) reported for Whipple adenocarcinoma cases also 
include other margins (n=41) that were not amenable to be assessed 
intraoperatively.
Conclusion: Our data suggests that IOCs for margins did not seem 
to improve postoperative R0 on pancreatic resections. The current 
findings add to a growing body of studies that question whether 
intraoperative margin assessment of Whipple surgeries performed 
for adenocarcinomas contributes to reducing the risk of R1 or 
improving long-term patient outcomes. The significant difference 
in frequency of IOC requests for margins among surgeons also sug-
gests the development or redefining of guidelines for IOCs during 
pancreatic surgeries.

National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: The updated World Health Organization 
(WHO) 2019 classification of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
introduces new histological subtypes with unique characteristics. 
Our aim was tumour reclassification and frequency estimation of new 
variants after review of histological slides from curative HCC surgical 
resections.
Methods: We centrally reviewed all histological slides of 73 liver 
resection specimens from 73 patients with HCC (60 male, median 
age 72, IQR 64-76 years, BCLC stage 0-C) operated from 2001 
to2018. Histological slides and reports were retrieved from the 
Department of Pathology, Aretaieion Hospital. All cases were 
reclassified according to WHO 2019 and re-staged according TNM 
2017 system.
Results: Twenty-two HCC (30%) were reclassified into new sub-
types: 14 macrotrabecular-massive (19%), 4 steatohepatitic (5.5%), 
2 chromophobe (2.7%), 1 lymphocyte-rich (1.4%), 1 neutrophil-
rich (1.4%). Histological grade changed in 35/73 (48%) HCC: Ini-
tial grade 1 n=21, 2 n=27, 3 n=25; revised grade 1 n=3, 2 n=48, 
3 n= 22 (p<0.001). TNM stage was modified from 1 to 2 in 16/73 
HCCs (p <0.001). The main histological pattern was solid (48%), 
trabecular (36%) or pseudoglandular (16%). Microvascular inva-
sion was detected in 49/73 (67%) HCC. The non-neoplastic paren-
chyma showed steatosis (42.5%), steatohepatitis (20.5%), chronic

inflammation (71%) and no fibrosis in 29%. Fibrosis was staged as 
F1 22%, F2 12%, F3 10% or F4 27%.
Conclusion: Central histopathology review according to WHO 
2019 and TNM 2017 modifies histological grading and staging 
in about 1/2 and 1/4 of resected HCCs, respectively, with clinical 
implications. One third of HCCs are re-classified into new histo-
logical subtypes, some with known molecular background, prog-
nostic and/or predictive impact, important for patient management.

The site of metastatic lymph node has prognostic significance 
in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
S. Cagaptay*, A.A. Ağalar, C. Agalar, T. Egeli, M. Ozbilgin, T. 
Unek, T. Unek, Ö. Sağol
*Dokuz Eylül University Faculty of Medicine, Turkey
Background & objectives: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas 
(PDAC) have poor survival rates and prognosis. Important prognostic 
parameters are; tumour size/stage, metastatic lymph nodes count and 
vascular invasion. In the current AJCC staging system, there is no rec-
ommendation to specify metastatic regional lymph node localization.
Methods: Metastatic sites of 82 patients with regional lymph 
node metastases out of 101 patients with PDAC who underwent 
pancreaticoduodenectomy were classified as peripancreatic, 
perigastric, hepatico-communis, hepatic pedicle and other 
regions. Each region’s number of metastatic lymph nodes was 
determined. The associations between the presence of metastases 
in each lymph node region and overall survival and disease-free 
survival were determined statistically.
Results: Eighty cases (79.2%) had peripancreatic, 7 cases (6.9%) 
had perigastric, 6 cases (5.9%) had hepatico-communis, and 7 cases 
(6.9%) had hepatic pedicle lymph node metastasis.
In survival analysis, the estimated overall and disease-free survival 
time were significantly shorter in patients with hepatic pedicle 
lymph node metastasis (35.5 vs 11.24 month; p= 0.001, 18.55 
months/3.68 months; p <0.001, respectively). Although not sig-
nificant, the estimated overall survival time was shorter in patients 
with hepaticocommunis lymph node metastasis (34.7 months/20.5 
months; p= 0.32)
Hepatic pedicle lymph node metastasis was an independent predic-
tor of mortality (p=0.005) and recurrence (p=0.003) in multivari-
ate analysis.
Conclusion: The presence of hepatic pedicle lymph node 
metastasis is an independent poor prognostic factor for mortality 
and recurrence risk, according to our findings. Although not 
significant, patients with hepaticocommunis lymph node metastasis 
have 14-month shorter life expectancy than those without. With 
these findings, we conclude that the metastatic lymph node site 
may have an impact on the prognosis, and may be included in 
pathology reports.

Ground-glass change: think beyond chronic hepatitis B 
infection
F. Pereira*, J. Gama, R. Oliveira, M.R. Silva, M.J. Andrade, M.A. 
Cipriano
*Hospital Prof. Doutor Fernando Fonseca, Portugal
Background & objectives: Ground-glass change (GGC) corresponds 
to hepatocytes with eosinophilic granular, glassy cytoplasm on light 
microscopy, induced by proliferated smooth endoplasmic reticulum. 
GGC has been classically associated with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) 
infection but can be induced by drugs.
Methods: Analysed liver biopsies and surgical resections with 
GGC hepatocytes between January 2007 and December 2021, in 
“Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra”. Sex, age, nature 
of the product and the GGC aetiology were collected. The quantity 
of GGC was divided into the following categories: mild (1-30%), 
moderate (30-70%) and severe (70-100%).
Results: 79 patients with GG hepatocytes, 49 were male and 30 
female. The average patient age was 39 years. Seventy of the sam-
ples came from native livers (88.6%) and remaining 9 from allo-
graft livers (11.4%). The main cause identified was HBV infec-
tion (74.7%). The remainder were due to drug-induced liver injury 
(12.7%), hepatocellular carcinoma (2.5%), and autoimmune hepa-
titis (2.5%). In 4 cases the exact aetiology could not be identified 
(5.1%), and 2 are still under investigation (2.5%). The GGC ranged 
from mild (48.1%), moderate (34.2 %) to severe (17.7%). Mild 
GGC was more frequent in non-viral aetiologies and moderate/
severe was more frequent in HBV infection, but without statistical 
significance (p=0.324).
Conclusion: GGC mimicking the appearance of HBV infection 
may be seen in other conditions and are the result of cytoplasmic 
accumulation of glycogen, fibrinogen or cellular organelles. GGC 
are distinguished from HBV infection based on clinical information 
as well as lack of immunopositivity for hepatitis B surface antigen. 
Despite not statistically significant in our study, mild GGC should 
arise suspicion for non-HBV related causes.

sitätsklinik Salzburg SALK, Austria
Background & objectives: Neoadjuvant treatment strategies for 
extended pancreatic cancer could improve the outcome of this dismal 
disease entity now and in the future. Our histopathological knowledge 
of pancreatic regression phenomena are thereby sparse.
Methods: We investigated retrospectively the pathological 
regression grading of neoadjuvant treated pancreatic cancer of 
two university clinical centres of Austria using all known grading 
systems. Furthermore, extensive clinic-pathological data as well 
as different histomorphological and immunohistochemical (e.g. 
different markers of proliferation, tumour associated inflammation 
and chemoresistance) findings were collected and correlated to 
clinical and pathological endpoints.
Results: Overall, 22 patients (female/male: 16 (72.7%)/ 6 (27.3%) 
with a mean age of 64.6±8.9 years) with pancreatic cancer were 
enrolled in this study until now. The pretreated pancreatic cancer 
revealed more low grading (G1-G2: n=16 (72.7%)) and more high 
T-stages (T3-T4: n=17 (77.3%) as well as more high regression 
grade (CAP 0-2: n=13 (59%) according the 4-tired CAP regres-
sion grading system). Looking in detail, the statistical analysis 
indicated that some clinic-pathological, histomorphological and 
immunohistochemical parameters were statistically associated to 
endpoints (survival, recurrence, metastasis and regression grading) 
and could predict therapeutic response, overall.
Conclusion: We demonstrated that the classical and deep inves-
tigation of such neoadjuvant treated pancreatic cancer specimen 
could be helpfully for stratify the therapeutic success. In the future,

Comprehensive histologic evaluation of venous invasion in pan-
creatic neuroendocrine carcinomas
Y. Yoo*, S. Hong, S.J. Lee
*Asan Medical Center, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Pancreatic neuroendocrine 
carcinomas(PanNECs) have aggressive clinical behaviour with dis-
tant metastasis at the time of diagnosis. However, our understanding 
of various histologic features of venous invasion and association with 
clinicopathologic characteristics in PanNECs have not been systemati-
cally well elucidated.
Methods: Various histopathologic features of venous invasion, 
including status, type (lymphatic and venous), number of invasion 
foci, and histologic patterns [pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia 
(PanIN)-like, conventional, and destructive] were evaluated in 14 
PanNECs and compared with 471 pancreatic ductal adenocarci-
nomas (PDACs).
Results: Mean patient age was 67.1±13.1years with male-to-female 
ratio of 1.3. Mean tumour size was 3.8±1.6cm. Twelve(86%) were 
small and 2(14%) were large cell types. All had extrapancreatic 
extension, and lymphovascular and perineural invasions. Venous 
invasion was present in 11cases(86%), and associated with higher 
nodal category(p=0.028). Conventional and destructive patterns 
were identified in 10(71%) and 8(57%) cases, respectively. Com-
pared with PDACs, PanNECs had higher foci of venous(4.3±5.4 vs. 
2.2±3.4; p=0.039) and lymphatic(14.9±15.6 vs. 1.7±4.7; p<0.001) 
invasion. Unlike PDACs, PanIN-like pattern was absent and con-
ventional pattern was dominant in PanNECs(p<0.001). Higher 
nodal category, frequent distant metastasis, and lymphatic invasion 
were noted in PanNECs(all, p<0.001). PanNECs showed signifi-
cantly poor overall-survival(OS) than PDACs(p<0.001).
Conclusion: PanNECs show more conventional patterns of venous 
invasion and frequent venous and lymphatic invasion than PDACs. 
These higher frequency of lymphatic and venous invasion are asso-
ciated with frequent nodal and distant metastases and poor OS 
comparing with venous invasion in patients with PDACs.

Influence of constant lighting on liver
Y. Kirillov, M. Kozlova, S. Timofeev*, L. Makartseva, D. 
Areshidze
*Moscow MCC Kommunarka, Russia
Background & objectives: The current study was undertaken to evalu-
ate the effect of prolonged exposure to light, simulating urban light 
pollution, on liver health. We examined the morphofunctional state, 
immunohistochemical and micromorphometric parameters of rat liver 
in normal conditions and prolonged lighting exposure.
Methods: The study was carried out on 120 Wistar rats divided 
into 2 equal groups. The control group is kept in standard labora-
tory conditions, the experimental group was kept under constant 
illumination. The following were studied: morphological features 
of the liver, micromorphometric parameters of hepatocytes, expres-
sion of Ki-67, Per2, Bmal1 and p53 in them and circadian rhythms 
of these parameters.
Results: Our results show that nocturnal light disruption triggers 
a cell death in the liver within three weeks (necrosis and apoptosis 
of hepatocytes) and stimulates a change in normal cellular karyo-
metric parameters. At the same time, intracellular regeneration 
takes place within the organ, which manifests through hepatocyte 
hypertrophy. Under the influence of constant illumination, the cir-
cadian rhythms (CRs) of the size of hepatocytes and their nuclei 
are restructured, the rhythm of the nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio is 
destroyed. The destruction of the CR of expression of p53 and 
Ki-67 also occurs against the background of the rearrangement of 
the daily rhythmicity of Per2 and Bmal1.
Conclusion: The revealed changes in the morphofunctional state 
of the liver under the influence of light pollution indicate that a 
violation of normal illumination regimes is a potent factor leading 
to significant structural changes in the liver. Despite this, our 
results show a link between light pollution and liver damage, which 
warrants further research into specific effect of light pollution of 
different extent on human liver health.

Prognostic implication of leptin-signalling proteins, PD-L1 and 
tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes in surgically resected biliary 
tract cancers
S. Byeon, H.J. Cho, J.H. Park, M.S. Chang*
*(1) The International Academy of Pathology; (2) The Korean 
Society of Pathologists, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Biliary tract cancers are rare malignan-
cies with a dismal prognosis. Leptin and PD-L1 influence CD8+ and 
FOXP3+ lymphocytes, and then cancer cell growth. We aimed to 
define prognostic implications of these variables and clinicopathologi-
cal features in surgically-resected biliary tract cancers.
Methods: Immunohistochemistry for leptin signalling-related 
proteins (leptin, leptin receptor, pSTAT3, ERK, mTOR), PD-L1, 
CD8 and FOXP3 and in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus-
encoded small RNAs were performed in 186 cases of surgically-
resected biliary tract cancers. Prognostic significances on 5-year 
survival and recurrence-free survival of patients were evaluated 
through multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazards 
model.
Results: Immune cell PD-L1 (+), tumour size < 3cm, application 
of adjuvant chemotherapy, no recurrence and early-stage tumours 
were correlated with better 5-year survival of patients in the entire 
cohort through multivariate analysis (P < 0.05, respectively). How-
ever, in tumoral PD-L1-positive subgroup or leptin-positive sub-
group, immune cell PD-L1, adjuvant therapy and tumour stage lost 
their impact on patient survival. The significance of immune cell 
PD-L1 and adjuvant chemotherapy on patient survival retained in 
extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma only among subgroups by tumour 
location (P < 0.05, respectively). Regarding recurrence-free sur-
vival, leptin and ERK expressions revealed prognostic value in 
the entire cohort, tumoral PD-L1-negative subgroup or gallbladder 
cancer subgroup (P < 0.05, respectively).
Conclusion: Immune cell PD-L1 (+) and adjuvant chemotherapy 
favourably affected patient survival in the entire cohort, however, 
it was not relevant in tumoral PD-L1-positive subgroup or leptin-
positive subgroup. PD-L1- or leptin-targeted therapy rather than 
conventional chemotherapy may be beneficial for these subgroups. 
Regulating leptin and ERK expressions may improve recurrence-
free survival in tumoral PD-L1-negative subgroup or gallbladder 
cancer subgroup.

Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Venous invasion (VI) is frequent in pancre-
atic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) than other cancers and it explains 
why PDAC is deadly. However, our understanding of VI in pancreatic 
undifferentiated carcinoma (UC) and undifferentiated carcinoma with 
osteoclast-like giant cells (UCOGC) is limited.
Methods: Histopathologic characteristics of VI were evaluated 
with 44 (30 UCs and 14 UCOGCs) cases using triple CD31─D2-
40─desmin and e-cadherin immunostaining and clinicopathologic 
factors were compared with those of 471 PDACs. VI patterns were 
divided into three groups: conventional, intraepithelial neoplasia 
(IN)-like and destructive patterns.
Results: VI was frequent in 3 cancers (PDAC, 64.3%, 303/471; 
UC, 70.0%, 21/30; UCOGC, 50.0%, 7/14; p=0.43). Mean VI 
foci number was higher in PDAC (3.3±3.6, p=0.004) than UC 
(2.0±2.1) and UCOGC (1.1±1.6). Mean number of IN-like 
(p=0.002) and destructive (p=0.033) patterns on H&E slides 
were higher in PDAC than UC and UCOGC. Triple CD31─D2-
40─desmin staining detected more foci of destructive pattern 
(p=0.018) than H&E, but no difference for detecting IN-like and 
conventional patterns. E-cadherin expression was lost in tumour 
cells invading stroma but was re-expressed within venous lumen 
of UCs and UCOGCs. Median survival time of UCOGC was 
significantly better compared to UC (UC, 5.52 months; UCOGC, 
19.9 months; p<0.001).
Conclusion: 1) VI was frequent both in UC and UCOGC like 
PDACs. 2) Triple CD31─D2-40─desmin staining could detect 
more VI foci of destructive pattern. 3) Sustained epithelial─mes
enchymal─transition may not require for VI of UC and UCOGC. 
4) VI alone could partly explain for different survival between UC 
and UCOGC patients, as all the measured indexes of VI, such as 
its overall prevalence, the mean number of foci, and the mean IN-
like and destructive patterns, showed the lowest values in UCOGC.

Ex vivo patient-derived pancreatic cancer organoids to uncover 
individual therapeutic vulnerabilities and model acquired 
resistance
S. Steiner*, A. Pliego, M. Haberecker, F. Arnold, D. Lenggenhager, 
C. Pauli
*Institute of Pathology and Molecular Pathology, University Hos-
pital Zurich, Switzerland
Background & objectives: The acquisition of drug resistances con-
tributes to poor survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Tumour organoid 
models not only bridges the gap between research and clinics but also 
offer a platform to study intrinsic drug sensitivities and predispositions 
to drug resistances.
Methods: After establishing patient derived tumour organoids from a 
rare BRAF mutated pancreatic cancer patient and their genetic evalu-
ation, we performed an ex vivo functional drug testing in order to 
identify specific drug vulnerabilities. The continuous exposure with 
trametinib lead to the formation of drug resistant organoid clones used 
for the subsequent RNA sequencing and expression analysis.
Results: In an ex vivo functional drug testing, the BRAF organoids 
revealed a genotype specific sensitivity towards the MEK inhibitor 
trametinib when compared to other drugs. The induction of a drug 
resistance by continuous trametinib selection pressure further lead 
to the formation of resistant clones indicating a change in Wnt sig-
nal regulation compared to their untreated counterparts. Sequencing 
analysis performed on the patient’s primary tumour specimen and the 
metastatic lesion revealed the acquisition of a GATA6 amplification, 
indicative for the underlying resistance mechanism, which resulted 
in the progression of the disease.
Conclusion: We conclude that the use of patient derived tumour 
organoids represents a patient centered approach to investigate 
drug sensitivities and explore predispositions for drug resist-
ances. The results generated by this approach assist in guiding 
and customizing therapy decision with the fundamental goal to 
improve the survival of pancreatic cancer patients.

*Department of Tumour and Diagnostic Pathology, Atomic Bomb 
Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Japan
Background & objectives: Thyroid follicular tumours (TFTs) 
showing nodule-in-nodule (NN) appearance with poorly differentiated 
component (PDc) but neither invasion nor metastasis are diagnosed 
as benign nodules regardless of high-grade histological features. This 
study aims at elucidating the malignant potential of PDc.
Methods: This study analysed the profile of TP53 binding protein-1 
(53BP1) expression by dual-colour immunofluorescence with Ki-67 
and NRAS codon 61 mutations by droplet digital PCR in 16 cases 
of TFT showing NN with PDc compared to 30 adenomatous goiter 
(AG), 31 follicular adenoma (FA), 15 minimally invasive follicular 
carcinoma (MFC), and 11 widely invasive FC (WFC) cases.
Results: The incidence of abnormal type 53BP1 expression in TFTs 
was significantly higher in the outer nodule (Out-N) (11.7%) and PDc 
(10.3%) in NN than AG (5.6%) and FA (6.5%) but not in MFC (14.2%) 
and WFC (17.1%). Furthermore, the frequency of double-positive 
cells with Ki-67 was significantly higher in PDc (0.36%) than in AG 
(0.03%), FA (0.12%), and Out-N (0.08%) but not in MFC (0.67%) and 
WFC (0.66%). The NRAS codon 61 mutation was the most frequently 
detected in both Out-N and PDc tumour areas (56.3%), and significantly 
higher than in AG (3.3%), FA (20.0%) but not in MFC (26.7%) and 
WFC (36.4%).
Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the prevalence of 
abnormal type 53BP1 expression and NRAS mutations in PDc 
was comparable to FCs, suggesting a malignant potential at the 
molecular pathological level. Because co-localization of 53BP1 
and Ki-67 can be an indicator of altered DNA damage response 
(DDR), the development of PDc may be associated with DDR 
impairments after harbouring an NRAS mutation. Thus, we 
should pay more attention to PDc as a precursor lesion associ-
ated with poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

Background & objectives: Follicular Cell–Derived Thyroid Carcinomas 
(FCDTC) harbour targetable molecular alterations according to their histology. 
It has been proposed that molecular screening to drive treatments should be 
based on histological classification. However, we found that distant metastases 
histology can be misleading.
Methods: We review the features of distant metastases of FCDTC 
registered in our centre from 2010 to nowadays, blinded to the 
primary tumour.
Histological criteria evaluated included the presence of follicular 
pattern, colloid, papillae, psammoma bodies, squamous differentia-
tion, tumour necrosis, prominent mitoses, and nuclear features of 
papillary carcinomas. Then, a presumed diagnosis was stablished 
and compared with the original primary tumour.
Results: We review 15 metastases, located in bone (8), skin 
(3), soft tissues (1), liver (1), lung (1), and cerebellum (1). Our 
presumed diagnosis was follicular variant of papillary carcinoma 
(7 biopsies), another variant of papillary carcinoma (3 biopsies), 
and follicular carcinoma (3 biopsies). Two biopsies had insufficient 
material. Our diagnosis was concordant with the primary in 7 
cases (54%) and discordant in 6 (46%). Among discrepant cases, 
three primary follicular carcinomas were identified as papillary 
carcinomas by their nuclear features. Moreover, three primary 
poorly differentiated carcinomas were identified as papillary 
carcinomas (2) and follicular carcinoma (1).
Conclusion: Identification of primary FCDTC based on the histo-
logical features of distant metastases can be misleading in almost 
half of cases. Most common causes of discrepancy are the presence 
of nuclear features of papillary carcinomas in the metastases and 
the difficulty to determine characteristics of poorly differentiated 
thyroid carcinomas in the metastases.

*"Grigore T. Popa" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Romania
Background & objectives: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is 
characterized by a relatively aggressive biological behaviour, respon-
sible for a high number of deaths compared to other thyroid cancers. 
We aimed to analyse the clinicopathological profile of MTC, pointing 
on cases with increased oncological risk.
Methods: The study group comprised a single centre case series of 
59 patients diagnosed at a referral hospital in North-Eastern region 
of Romania. The histological diagnosis of MTC was confirmed by 
immunohistochemical exam. Correlations between the classical clin-
ico-pathological variables and three parameters considered elements 
of aggressiveness (thyroid capsular invasion, lympho-vascular invasion 
and lymph node metastasis) were settled by using statistical analysis.
Results: Histopathologically, we identified the following types 
of MCT: conventional (35 cases/59.32%), spindle cell (12 
cases/20.33%), oncocytic (5 cases/8.47%), follicular/glandular (3 
cases/5.08%), pseudopapillary (2 cases/3.38%), with giant cells 
(1 case/1.69%) and with small cells (1 case/1.69%). Statistical 
analysis revealed significant correlations between tumour size and 
lympho-vascular invasion (p <0.0001), and lymph node metasta-
sis (p=0.0220); tumour focality was significantly correlated with 
lymph node metastasis (p=0.0230). The chances of risk for lym-
pho-vascular invasion and lymph node metastasis were associated 
with tumour size over 40 mm (OR=13.69, respectively OR=6). In 
addition, the chance of risk for lymph node metastasis was associ-
ated with multifocal primary tumour (OR=9.428).
Conclusion: Our results indicate that, despite the variability of 
histological MTC subtypes, they do not significantly influence 
the prognosis. A particular aspect identified in our MTC series 
was the association, in 7 cases, with papillary thyroid carcinoma, 
tumour with different cell origin; the coexistence of the two thyroid 
malignancies is rarely reported in the literature. Moreover, our data 
confirm that lympho-vascular invasion and lymph node metasta-
sis are relevant indicators for aggressiveness, whose presence can 
explain the worse course of disease.

*Clinical University Hospital, University of Santiago de Com-
postela and Galician Healthcare Service (SERGAS), Spain
Background & objectives: Non-syndromic familial non-medullary 
thyroid carcinomas (NSFNMTCs) are a heterogeneous group of 
hereditary cancers whose genetic basis is poorly understood. It has 
been suggested that some of their clinicopathological features may 
suggest a familial character. We investigated a series of NSFNMTCs.
Methods: Follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinoma was identi-
fied in ≥ 2 first-degree relatives in 43 cases. Most patients were 
women (69.76%), with a female-to-male ratio of 3:1.3. The mean 
and median age (and range) was 42.5 and 67 (25-73) years for 
women, 43.08 and 43 (18-68) for men and 42.33 and 41 (18-68) 
for the total number of patients, respectively.
Results: All cases (97.67%) were papillary thyroid carcinomas 
(PTCs) except one case of oncocytic thyroid carcinoma. PTC 
subtypes were: follicular (54.76%), conventional (28.57%), 
tall cell (11.9%), oncocytic (2.38%) and Warthin-like variant 
(2.38%). Multifocality was detected in 31/43 cases (72.09%) and 
bilaterality in 24/42 cases (57.14%). Tumour size ranged from 3 
to 56 mm (mean 17.55; median 12). Venous invasion was found 
in 1 case (2.32%); extrathyroidal extension in 6 (13.95%) and 
lymph node metastases in 10 (23.25%). Follicular nodular disease 
and/or follicular adenoma was detected in 30 cases (69.76%); 
lymphocytic thyroiditis in 13 (30.23%); Graves disease in 2 
(4.65%); intrathyroidal parathyroid in 3 (6.97%) and thymic tissue 
in 1 case (2.32%).
Conclusion: NSFNMTCs are typically PTCs, mainly of the 
follicular, conventional and tall cell variants, associated with 
multifocality and bilaterality, as well as with a high frequency 
of extrathyroidal extension. The combination of PTC with a 
background of benign lesions is also frequent.

Methods: All NIFTP cases registered in Targu-Mureş Pathology 
Department between 2016-2021 were reviewed. The incidence of 
NIFTP was calculated in relation to the number of papillary thyroid 
carcinomas (PTCs) registered over the study period. Then, the inci-
dence of NIFTP between 2016-2018 was compared to the incidence 
between 2019-2021, 2018 marking the year when the diagnostic 
criteria of NIFTP were revised.
Results: A total number of 43 cases of NIFTPs were diagnosed 
in our department between 2016-2021, with an overall NIFTP 
incidence of 13.5% [CI 10.06-18.11], among the 319 PTCs cases 
registered over the same period. When the incidence of NIFTP was 
compared between the two periods (2016-2018 versus 2019-2021), 
we found out that the overall incidence of NIFTP has dropped from 
15.13% [CI 10.0-22.83] to 11.97% [ CI 7.77 -18.42] in the second 
evaluated period.
Conclusion: In this study, we documented a low NIFTP incidence 
in our institution over the last 5 years. The fact that NIFTP inci-
dence decreased after refining the diagnostic criteria in 2018, 
emphasize the need to apply very stringent histomorphologic cri-
teria when making a diagnosis of NIFTP, in order to avoid over-
treatment of a tumour with indolent behaviour.

*George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, 
and Technology of Targu Mures, Romania
Background & objectives: Primary adrenal malignancies are rare 
tumours. The aim of the study was to examine time-trends of tumour 
adrenal pathology and to analyse the distribution of their different his-
tology in a 20-year retrospective study (2000-2019), in Mureș County, 
Romania.
Methods: Patients clinic-pathological features were obtained 
from database registries of Department of Pathology, County 
Emergency Clinical Hospital, Târgu-Mureș. Histological types of 
adrenal tumours were classified according to WHO 2017 crite-
ria. Due to a small number of cases, in order to establish a trend 
for incidence, we analysed the cases distribution in 4 periods 
of 5 years:2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014 and, respectively, 
2015-2019.
Results: We first identified 101 patients who underwent an adrenal 
surgery between 2000-2019. Subsequently, the analysis included 
only cases classified as tumours of the adrenal cortex (62,72.9%) 
or adrenal medulla (23,27.1%). The most common adrenal tumours 
were adenomas 35%, followed by pheochromocytomas 24%, car-
cinomas 15%, metastatic tumours 14%, myelolipomas 7%, neuro-
blastic tumours 4%, lymphomas 1%.
The average age at the time of diagnosis was 54.13 year-old for 
adenomas, 49.73 for carcinomas and 47.85 for pheochromocyto-
mas. The average size of the carcinomas was 88.2 mm, and 60.4 
mm for pheochromocytomas.
An increased number of adrenal adenomas (56,26%) was noticed in 
the last period 2015-2019, increasing the total number of adrenal 
tumours (37.64%).
Conclusion: Although not very common, adrenal tumours express 
a varied pathology with special features that must always be in the 
pathologist’s attention for a diagnosis as accurate as possible. The 
recent increase in adrenal tumours cases, due to benign and prob-
ably non-secretory tumours, could be attributed to the frequent use 
of imaging methods. The incidence of adrenal cancer did not have 
an upward trend.

Background & objectives: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a 
rare malignant neuroendocrine neoplasia. Recent studies demonstrated 
that proliferation is one of the most important prognostic factors. 
Various methods are available for the measurement of proliferation, 
including mitotic counts and immunohistochemistry of proliferation-
associated antigens.
Methods: A total of 100 initial thyroidectomy specimens were 
examined microscopically. The mitotic index (MI), Ki67, PHH3 
and MCM6 proliferative indexes were evaluated. Measurements 
were obtained in the area showing the highest proliferative activity. 
MI and PHH3 were assessed per 2mm2. For the Ki67 and MCM6 
proliferative indexes, 500 to 2000 tumour cells were counted per 
tumour.
Results: All of the four proliferative indicators were signifi-
cant predictors of overall survival (OS), biological (B-DFS) 
and morphological disease free survival (M-DFS). MI was 
associated with a decrease in OS (hazard ratio [HR]=1.26, 
95% confidence interval [CI]=1.18-1.35, p<0.001), M-DFS 
(HR=1.2, CI=1.13-1.27, p<0.001) and B-DFS (HR=1.13, 
CI=1.08-1.19, p<0.001). PHH3 was associated with a decrease 
in OS (HR=1.15, CI=1.05-1.28, p=0.022), M-DFS (HR=1.09, 
CI=1.02-1.16, p=0.036) and B-DFS (HR=1.10, CI=1.05-
1.16, p=0.001). MCM6 was also associated with a decrease in 
OS (HR=1.06, CI=1.03-1.08, p<0.001), M-DFS (HR=1.03, 
CI=1.00-1.05, p=0.049) and B-DFS (HR=1.04, CI=1.02-1.06, 
p<0.001).
Conclusion: We demonstrateded that all proliferation measure-
ment methods are significant prognostic predictors. These indi-
cators are continuous variables, and as each variable increases, 
prognosis worsens. We recommend reporting at least one of these 
proliferation indexes in addition to conventional prognostic factors 
for MTC.

Scoazec
*Pathology Department, Salah Azaiez Institute, Tunis, Tunisia; 
Research Laboratory LR21SP01, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Metastasis of neuroendocrine carcinomas 
(NEC) in the digestive system are possible and present an unusual 
mode of revelation. They represent a real challenge for the pathologist 
since they mimic primary neuroendocrine pancreato-gastrointestinal 
tumours.
Methods: A review of all neuroendocrine metastasis in the gastro-
intestinal tract and pancreas of the Gustave Roussy Campus Cancer 
pathology department was performed between 2015 and 2021.
Results: Three cases of secondary NEC in gastro-intestinal 
tract and pancreas were found. They were all men aged 58, 68 
and 73 years old. Two had pancreatic tumours and one had a 
small intestine tumour. Diagnosis was made on the second opin-
ion expert consultation. The two pancreatic tumours showed

positivity for neuroendocrine markers, SATB2 and had a prolif-
erative index Ki67 between 40 and 50%. They both expressed 
Polyomavirus on immunohistochemistry. Final diagnosis was 
Merkel cell carcinoma. Intestinal tumour was positive for neu-
roendocrine markers and TTF1. Ki67 labelled 80% of the cells. 
Final diagnosis was metastasis of large cell neuroendocrine car-
cinoma of lung. Chest tomography was secondarily performed 
and confirmed this diagnosis.
Conclusion: NEC of the digestive system are rare tumours with 
multiple morphological mimics. The pathologist must always 
favour the diagnosis of a secondary localization and push the 
investigations before making the diagnosis of primary NEC of the 
digestive system.

Different patterns of prostate specific membranous antigen 
expression in tumour-associated neovasculatur among neu-
roendocrine neoplasms of GI-tract - an immunohistochemical 
study targeted on its theranostic use
V. Wild*, K. Mielert, S. Roth, A. Rosenwald, R. Werner, A. Mein-
ing, A. Weich
*Institute of Pathology, University of Würzburg, Germany
Background & objectives: Tumour vascularization as a therapeutic 
target is gaining importance in an increasing number of solid tumours. 
In this context, the expression of prostate specific membranous antigen 
(PSMA) in intratumoral vessels has led to increased interest with 
regard to PSMA-directed therapy.
Methods: We examined PSMA expression on tumour-associated 
vessels in specimens of different neuroendocrine neoplasms of the 
digestive system (n=16 NET-G1, n=16 NET-G2, n=8 NET-G3 
and n=14 NEC) by immunohistochemistry. If positively stained 
vessels were present, their number was counted in hotspot regions 
and related to the area.
Results: PSMA expression in intratumoral vessels was detected in 
2/16 NET-G1 (12,5%), 3/16 NET-G2 (18,7%), 5/8 NET-G3 (62,5%) 
and 7/14 NEC (50%). We found differences in the distribution 
(intratumoral versus marginal or in the area of the invasion front) 
as well as in the number and density of stained vessels.
Conclusion: Comparable to other solid tumour entities, in neuroen-
docrine neoplasms PSMA expression in intratumoral, tumour-derived 
vessels is associated with higher tumour-grade and aggressiveness. 
As PSMA-directed therapy in metastatic prostate cancer is an already 
well-established theranostic concept, opportunities are now also emerg-
ing in the context of vascular PSMA expression of solid tumours. This 
could open up the possibility of PSMA-directed diagnostic work-up 
and therapy in aggressive neuroendocrine neoplasms whose therapeutic 
options have been limited so far.

Digimir test: a novel pipeline for mir-371a-3p quantification 
using droplet digital PCR in liquid biopsies of testicular germ 
cell tumour patients
J. Lobo*, J.P. Sequeira, V. Constâncio, T. Brito-Rocha, C. Car-
valho-Maia, I. Braga, J. Maurício, R. Henrique, C. Jerónimo
*IPO Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: miR-371a-3p is the most reliable liquid-biopsy 
biomarker for diagnosis and monitoring of testicular germ cell tumour 
(TGCT) patients. Current studies have focused on RT-qPCR methodologies, 
but some challenges remain (pre-amplification and normalization). Droplet 
digital PCR (ddPCR) may overcome these challenges.
Methods: In this work, we provide a report of a ddPCR-based 
pipeline for quantification of miR-371a-3p (the DigiMir pipeline) 
and compare it with two common RT-qPCR protocols. A total of 
107 plasma samples were investigated in the validation setting. 
All requirements for validation of ddPCR pipelines were followed, 
including appropriate controls, spike-in, temperature gradient and 
limits of blank, detection and quantification.
Results: The DigiMir pipeline showed a good performance in the 
intra-operator, inter-operator, inter-synthesis and inter-extraction 
tests. It detected TGCTs in a manner representative of tumour 
burden, with a sensitivity and specificity of 94% and 100%, 
respectively, outperforming the combined sensitivity of all three 
classical serum tumour markers available currently in routine 
(61.5%). All non-TGCT testicular masses were negative, as was 
a patient with hepatocarcinoma showing high serum levels of 
AFP, further assuring the specificity of the test. One patient with 
constitutive slight elevation of AFP (generating clinical challenges) 
was negative for the miR-371a-3p and remained disease-free under 
surveillance. The single patient showing disease progression 
maintained high miR-371a-3p levels at follow-up.
Conclusion: Therefore, in this proof-of-concept investigation, we have 
showed that the DigiMir pipeline constitutes a new promising methodology 
for accurately reporting miR-371a-3p in the clinical setting. ddPCR is a 
suitable methodology for quantifying microRNAs in liquid biopsy samples 
of patients with the accuracy needed for precision medicine.

Differential gene expression of nystagmus-associated genes in 
chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Parkinson`s disease, and 
Alzheimer`s disease
F.V. De Los Reyes*
*Department of Neuromuscular Research, National Center of Neu-
rology and Psychiatry, Philippines
Background & objectives: The research aimed to determine whether 
the genes that presented with nystagmus as part of their clinical pres-
entation were differentially expressed in the brains of patients with 
Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), 
and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).
Methods: The data was derived from the available NCBI SRA 
datasets that allowed public domain use. The database search 
yielded 10 PD patients, 13 AD patients, 10 CTE patients, and 6 
CTE with AD patients. The RNA sequence from the brain samples 
of the patients underwent differential expression analysis using 
the web-based platform Galaxy and R version 4.1.0 with R Studio.
Results: Identifying the nystagmus-associated genes among the 
genes that were expressed in the brain samples of patients with PD, 
AD, CTE, and CTE with AD showed that there were only 21 genes 
out of the 28,395 retrieved genes in the mRNA sequence of the 
S140

patient groups and the control group that were identified to have a 
reported association with nystagmus. Post Hoc evaluation showed 
that the identified genes from all of the patient groups were signifi-
cantly under-expressed compared to the control group (p<0.001). 
The genes that were identified can be divided into those involved 
in protein synthesis, cell cycle regulation, gap junction formation, 
transcription regulation, signal transduction, and synaptic function.
Conclusion: The relationship illustrated that the common 
genomic changes may indicate how the pathways that have been 
altered due to the diseases have intersecting gene expression 
alteration that lead to visual motor control pathology. Perform-
ing differential gene expression studies in the brain samples of 
post-mortem cases illustrates how autopsy pathology and compu-
tation pathology can elucidate the common genomic changes and 
molecular mechanisms that can present across different diseases 
which may be significant in the field of both neuro- and ophthal-
mic pathology.

Determination of Ly6E and Ly6K gene expression levels in soft 
tissue tumours and investigation of their correlation of these 
levels with tumour aggression
Ç. Yildirim*, T.D. Kökenek Ünal, O. Kandemir
*Dr. A.Y. Oncology Research and Education Hospital, Ankara, Turkey
Background & objectives: Soft tissue tumours are rare heterogene-
ous group of tumours. In recent years, cancer research has gained a 
different approach with the discovery of cancer stem cells. We aimed 
to evaluate the expression of Ly6E and Ly6K genes in these tumours.
Methods: The study was performed with 45 patients, aged between 
20-80, diagnosed with soft tissue tumours. In the study, there were 
patients diagnosed with dermatofibroma and leiomyoma; leiomyo-
sarcoma, pleomorphic sarcoma and synovial sarcoma. Paraffin 
blocks sections were taken and deparaffinised, total RNA isolation 
and cDNA were obtained. Ly6E and Ly6K expression levels were 
determined by PCR, the results were compared.
Results: When all groups are evaluated together; there was a 
statistically significant increase in Ly6E and Ly6K gene expres-
sion in the benign and malignant tumour groups compared to the 
control group. However, the increase in Ly6K was statistically 
insignificant. Especially in leimyosarcomas, there was a statisti-
cally significant increase of Ly6E gene expression. In synovial 
sarcoma and pleomorphic sarcomas, it was observed that Ly6E 
expression increased compared to the control group, but it was 
insignificant. A statistically significant increase in Ly6K gene 
expression level was found in malignant tumours originating from 
smooth muscle compared to the control group. There was no sta-
tistically significant difference between other tumour groups in 
Ly6K expression levels.
Conclusion: The expressions of Ly6E and Ly6K in human soft 
tissue tumours were discussed for the first time in the literature. 
Especially in well-differentiated malignant soft tissue tumours, 
the aforementioned markers were found to be elevated and tumour 
aggressiveness is related with them. Therefore, with more compre-
hensive studies, the importance of Ly6E and Ly6K genes in cancer 
development and their potential roles in the therapy will be better 
understood and our study will make an important contribution to 
the literature.

salle, E. Long-Mira, S. Lalvée, V. Tanga, M. Allégra, M. Salah, J. 
Benzaquen, C. Marquette, M. Ilié, P. Hofman
*Laboratoire de pathologie Clinique et experimentale, CHU de 
Nice, Université Côte d’Azur, Nice, France
Background & objectives: The number of targetable genomic altera-
tions in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NS-NSCLC) 
patients increased these last few years, while the tissue material 
reduced in size. Therefore, molecular pathologists are facing challenges 
to maintain a strategy allowing a rapid diagnosis.
Methods: We report here our experience (LPCE, Nice, France) 
between September 20, 2021 and December 31, 2021 for the 
development of an optimal workflow for genomic alteration 
assessment as a reflex testing in routine clinical practice at diag-
nosis in patients with NS-NSCLC using an ultra-fast next gen-
eration sequencing approach (Genexus OPA DNA RNA panel, 
Thermo-Fisher).
Results: 325 patients were included in the study. 74% of patients 
had stage IIIB-IV NS-NSCLC, and 26% were stage I-IIIA. 
Ultra-fast NGS was performed in 182 bronchial biopsies, in 
68 transthoracic biopsies, in 50 surgical specimens and in 25 
cellblocks from 16 pleural effusion and 9 EBUS with a short 
mean turnaround time of 72h. Mean tumour cell was 40% (ranging 
from 5% to 95%). The analytical validation of the Genexus OPA 
workflow, performed on 30 NS-NSCLC cases, demonstrated 100% 
concordance with the gold standard methods.
Conclusion: We demonstrate that molecular targets accessible 
to personalized medicine in NS-NSCL were identified using 
the Genexus system in a rapid turnaround time. Ultra-fast NGS 
integration as a reflex testing can be an optimal option for 
genomic alteration assessment at diagnosis for all stage NS-
NSLC. This approach enables for a sensitive and a specific 
identification of mutations, CNVs, and fusion variants types 
across 50 key genes, on tumour material with a low amount of 
nucleic acids.

M.A. Fedeli, G. Palmieri, A. Cossu
*Unit of Anatomic Pathology, Italy
Background & objectives: Targeted therapies against KRAS muta-
tions in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were 
recently introduced in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the molecular landscape of KRAS mutations in Italian 
patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
Methods: Consecutive Italian patients with histologically 
diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma who underwent molecular analysis 
for KRAS mutations were enrolled into the study. Mutation analysis 
was carried out initially by quantitative measurements of mutations 
with pyrosequencing (PyroMark Q24 system, Qiagen Inc., USA), 
replaced in 2021 by next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques 
on Ion S5 GeneStudio (Life Thermofisher) platform.
Results: 1355 patients were enrolled. Among them 850 (62.73%) 
were males, and the mean age was 67 (±10.3) years. A KRAS 
mutation was detected in 324 patients (23.9%); most of them were 
males (238, 73.46%). Considering the male population, KRAS 
mutations were found in 238 out of 850 (28%), while they were 
detected in 86 out of 505 (17.03%) women (p<0,0001). No statisti-
cally significant difference in the age of mutated and non-mutated 
patients (68, 95% CI: 67 – 70 vs 68, 95% CI: 67 – 68.5 years) was

found. Globally, 14 subtypes of KRAS mutations were detected, 
the most common being G12C (103, 31.79%), G12V (79, 24.38%), 
and G12D (45, 13.89%).
Conclusion: KRAS mutations occurred in 23.9% of the patients 
enrolled in the study, and KRAS G12C was the most common one, 
detected in 103 patients (7.6%); these figures are slightly lower 
in comparison to those reported for other Caucasian populations.

Krasnov, A. Kudryavtseva
*Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of 
Sciences, Moscow, Russia
Background & objectives: Locally advanced prostate cancer (LAPC) 
is characterized by invasion of the prostatic capsule, in which lymphatic 
dissemination is also frequently observed. For this category of patients, 
the search for reliable prognostic markers for choosing further treat-
ment tactics is especially relevant.
Methods: Total RNA was obtained from 73 LAPC samples, from 
which libraries were prepared and RNA-Seq on the Illumina 
platform was performed. Differential expression analysis was 
performed between samples with (N1 group) and without lymphatic 
dissemination (N0 group) in R (edgeR). Validation of gene 
expression was performed by qPCR on an independent sample of 
LAPC patients based on 37 FFPE samples.
Results: According to the obtained RNA-Seq data bioinformatic 
analysis results, a statistically significant increase in the differen-
tial expression of the CST2 gene in the N1 group by 3.27 times 
was found (LogFC = 1.71; FDR-value QLF test = 0.01). Spear-
man’s rank correlation analysis showed a correlation between CST2 
gene expression and lymphatic dissemination (rs=0.47; p-value = 
0.00009). Based on the results of CST2 gene relative expression 
validation in an independent sample of LAPC patients, a statisti-
cally significant increase in expression in the N1 group by 3.24 
times (p-value = 0.002) was also confirmed.
Conclusion: Thus, based on the study, it was shown that an 
increased level of CST2 gene expression is statistically signifi-
cantly associated with lymphatic dissemination and can be consid-
ered as a potential prognostic marker in prostate cancer.

NTRK fusion genes in cholangiocarcinoma
T. Vesterinen*, S. Boyd, S. Kytölä, J. Arola
*HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB, Helsinki University Hospital 
and University of Helsinki, Finland
Background & objectives: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an uncom-
mon and aggressive adenocarcinoma with poor long-term survival. As 
current treatment options for CCA patients are restricted and systemic, 
new therapies are urgently needed. Here we studied if NTRK fusion 
genes exist in CCAs.
Methods: CCA cohort retrieved from Helsinki Biobank (Finland) 
included 93 primary CCAs and 25 metastatic samples. Tumours 
were histologically re-evaluated, processed into TMAs and labelled 
with pan-TRK antibody (clone EPR17341, Roche Tissue Diagnos-
tics, Tucson, AZ). Tumours expressing TRK were further analysed 
with Idylla GeneFusion Assay (Biocartis, Mechelen, Belgium) and 
FusionPlex Comprehensive Thyroid and Lung (CTL) panel (Invitae 
Corporation, San Francisco, CA).
Results: Altogether 9 primary tumours showed TRK expres-
sion in immunohistochemistry (IHC), indicating putative NTRK 
fusion. Metastatic samples showed no expression. The amount 
of TRK positive cells was low with an average value of 15 cells 
per tumour (median 4, range 1-100). In 7 of the tumours the 
expression was nuclear and 2 tumours showed cytoplasmic 
expression. Real-time RT-PCR-based Idylla GeneFusion Assay 
was performed to all 9 tumours. It identified NTRK3 expression 
imbalance in the tumour with cytoplasmic TRK expression. No 
other fusions were detected. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-
based FusionPlex CTL panel was performed for 8 tumours. No 
NTRK fusions were detected.
Conclusion: We identified NTRK3 expression imbalance in one 
(1.1%) of 93 CCA tumours but this could not be confirmed with 
NGS. Our results show limited specificity of pan-TRK IHC to 
identify NTRK fusions. Pan-TRK IHC can thus be utilized as 
a screening technique for NTRK fusions in CCA, but positive 
samples require confirmatory testing with RNA-based methods. 
As there is a tumour agnostic oncological treatment for patients 
with an NTRK fusion, also CCA patients should be screened for 
this gene rearrangement.

M. Rubiera, S. Fernández Menéndez, K.M. Piña Batista
*Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias; Universidad de 
Oviedo, Faculty of Medicine, Spain
Background & objectives: In lung adenocarcinoma, high PINK1 
expression was correlated with poor response to chemotherapy. Our 
aim was to study the immunoexpression of PINK1 in samples from 
lung adenocarcinoma and their respective brain metastases and its pos-
sible clinical relevance.
Methods: Twenty-six consecutive patients with lung adenocarcinoma 
and subsequent brain metastasis surgically removed between 2007 and 
2019 were studied. Tissue arrays were produced using a 2 mm diameter 
needle. Immunohistochemical studies were conducted and analysed by 
the H-Score method. Statistical analysis of these findings was carried out 
using the SPSSv25; p<0.05 program.
Results: Positive immunoexpression for PINK1 was detected 
in more than 90% of both primary tumours and their brain 
metastasis without significant differences (70,91 ± 43,46 
vs 77,61 ± 43,69; p= 0,565). More than 80 points of PINK1 
immunoexpression in primary lung adenocarcinoma showed a 
group of patients with a significant lower overall survival (46,63 
± 17,44 vs 98,79 ± 15,02 weeks; p= 0,018) and post-metastasic 
survival (18,86 ± 6,61 vs 84,78 ± 14,88 weeks; p= 0,002).
Conclusion: Non-significant differences for PINK1 were noted 
between primary and metastatic adenocarcinoma samples. 
More than 80 points of PINK1 immunoexpression in primary 
lung adenocarcinoma revealed a group of patients with a poorer 
prognosis.

*Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias; Universidad de 
Oviedo, Faculty of Medicine, Spain
Background & objectives: p62 is a multifunctional adaptor protein 
implicated in the crossroads of autophagy, apoptosis, and cancer. Our 
aim was to study the immunoexpression of p62 in samples from lung 
adenocarcinoma and their respective brain metastases and its possible 
clinical relevance.
Methods: Twenty-six consecutive patients with lung adenocarci-
noma and subsequent brain metastasis surgically removed between 
2007 and 2019 were studied. Tissue arrays were produced using a 2 
mm diameter needle. Immunohistochemical studies were conducted 
and analysed by the H-Score method. Statistical analysis of these 
findings was carried out using the SPSSv25; p<0.05 program.
Results: Positive immunoexpression for p62 was detected in more 
than 80% of both primary tumours and their brain metastasis with 
significant differences (112,38 ± 101,28 vs 85,71 ± 88,97; p= 
0,035). More than 60 points of p62 immunoexpression in metastatic 
brain samples of lung adenocarcinoma showed a group of patients 
with a significant lower overall survival (56,61 ± 15,21 vs 111,03 
± 11,21 weeks; p= 0,039) and disease-free survival (4,55 ± 1,91 
vs 82,47 ± 20,10 weeks; p= 0,005).
Conclusion: Significant overexpression of p62 was noted in pri-
mary lung adenocarcinomas compared to the metastatic tissue in 
the brain. More than 60 points of p62 immunoexpression in meta-
static brain samples of lung adenocarcinoma revealed a group of 
patients with a poorer prognosis.

NGS-based molecular profiling and liquid biopsies: an assess-
ment of pathologists and oncologists knowledge and attitudes
N. Dorkhom*, D. Middleton, T. Abair, A. Vingiani, G. Pruneri
*Medscape Oncology, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: This activity investigated the knowledge 
gaps of haematologists/oncologists (hem/oncs) and pathologists regard-
ing the use of next generation sequencing (NGS)-based molecular pro-
filing and liquid biopsies in clinical practice.
Methods: A CME-certified clinical practice assessment compris-
ing 30 multiple-choice questions that measured knowledge, atti-
tudes, and perspectives regarding NGS-based molecular profil-
ing and liquid biopsies was developed. The self-assessment was 
available online to physicians without monetary compensation. 
Respondent confidentiality was maintained, and responses were 
deidentified and aggregated prior to analysis. The activity launched 
June 8, 2021; data through December 1, 2021, are presented.
Results: The number of hem/oncs and pathologists answering each 
of these 30 questions ranged from 58 to 340. Only 54% of hem/
oncs and 52% of pathologists knew that the turnaround time of 
NGS analysis of liquid biopsies is approximately 50% shorter com-
pared to NGS analysis of tissue biopsies. Furthermore, only 44% 
of hem/oncs and pathologists were aware that real world data in 
NSCLC showed that patients receiving matched targeted therapy 
after genomic profiling of tissue biopsy versus ctDNA had similar 
PFS and ORR. The percentage of hem/oncs who answered each 
of the 20 knowledge questions correctly ranged from 17% to 83% 
while the range for pathologists varied from 16% to 89%.
Conclusion: NGS-based molecular profiling and liquid biopsies 
are becoming increasingly important in informing treatment deci-
sions for patients with cancer. However, only 26% of hem/oncs and 
35% of pathologists are confident in explaining to their colleagues 
how to apply NGS in clinical practice, and only 27% of hem/oncs 
and 28% of pathologists are confident in their ability to use liquid 
biopsies in clinical practice. This demonstrates the importance of 
further educating clinicians on these topics.

Study of gene expression by in situ hybridization in tissues with 
prostate adenocarcinoma routinely processed
I. Benedetti*, L. Barrios
*Universidad de Cartagena, Colombia
Background & objectives: The chromogenic in-situ hybridization 
(CISH) RNAscope® amplifies specific mRNA signals without back-
ground noise, and detects individual molecules as points feasible to be 
quantified. It allows high resolution in the study of the expression of 
each cell within its morphological context.
Methods: The in situ gene expression was evaluated by CISH in 
routinely processed prostate tissue. CISH assays were performed 
under standard conditions of the RNAscope® 2.5HDBrown ISH 
protocol, in a tissue microarray. Considering a positive stain eas-
ily visible under the microscope, nuclear and cytoplasmic dotted 
staining and signal strength for mRNA of each gene in the tissue 
cores were measured.
Results: Expression of the endogenous gene Hs-PPIB (Peptidyl-
prolyl-Isomerase-B) as a positive control, the bacterial gene dapB 
(dihydrodipicolinate-reductase) as a negative control for the back-
ground signal, and the target gene CXXC5, were evaluated in a 
prostate tissue microarray constructed from prostatectomy samples 
of patients with localized prostate cancer, including 381 cores of 
benign prostate tissue and prostate adenocarcinoma. The quality of 
the mRNA was variable along the tissue cores of the microarray, 
most showed moderate to strong staining of the positive control 
with little background staining. There was a correlation between 
mRNA expression of the constitutive endogenous gene Hs-PPIB 
and the target gene CXXC5.
Conclusion: CISH makes it possible to detect isolated mRNA

sion in context without destroying tissue morphology, compare 
it between heterogeneous cell populations, and locate molecu-
lar markers within the tumour microenvironment. Analysing the 
expression of mRNA in prostate cancer (PCa) tissues routinely 
processed by CISH would allow risk stratification and prognostic 
markers.

Background & objectives: Arylsulfatase B (ARSB) is a lysosomal 
enzyme with specific role in metabolism of chondroitin and dermatan 
sulfate. Few studies suggested it’s role in different carcinogenesis. The 
aim was to examine the association between ARSB and TP53 gene 
expressions in CRC.
Methods: In this prospective study, 77 cases of CRCs were 
included. Gene expression of ARSB and TP53 was analysed after 
RNA isolation from fresh tissue samples. The expression level was 
determined using relative quantitation (RQ). RQ>1 was considered 
highly expressed whereas RQ<1 was used to identify low gene 
expressions for ARSB and TP53.
Results: The statistical assessment showed a strong direct associa-
tion between ARSB and TP53 gene expression levels (p<0.0001). 
Low expression was seen in 42 of the cases (54.55%) for both 
genes. In 15 out of the 77 cases (19.48%) both genes were highly 
expressed; these cases were mostly diagnosed in locally advanced 
stages (pT3/4), with high budding grade. The remaining cases 
(n=20; 25.97%) presented high ARSB and low TP53 expression. 
From the 62 cases with high ARSB gene expression level, 25 
(40.32%) had mutation in one of the exons of the KRAS gene. These 
cases were mostly G2-adenocarcinomas with epithelial phenotype.
Conclusion: All these findings suggest a possible prognostic role of 
ARSB in CRC and an association with TP53 gene. Further research 
might be necessary to understand the exact behaviour of this enzyme 
in such carcinomas. No similar data were reported in literature.

sity and General University Hospital in Prague, Czech Republic
Background & objectives: Gene fusions represent somatic alterations 
involved in tumorigenesis of different cancers, and serve as diagnostic 
markers and/or therapeutic targets, although their incidence in ovarian 
tumours is unknown. Our aim was to characterize fusions in selected 
primary epithelial ovarian tumours.
Methods: Sequencing libraries for paired-end capture RNA-
Seq (147 genes; 373kbp; HyperCapture,Roche) were prepared 
using 300ng of total RNA isolated from FFPE tissues including 
mucinous borderline tumours (MBT;58), mucinous carcinomas 
(MC;36), high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC;6), serous bor-
derline tumours (SBT;23), and low-grade serous carcinomas 
(LGSC;53) and KAPA RNA HyperPrep kit (Roche), sequenced 
on NextSeq (Illumina), and biostatistically analysed using CLC 
Genomics Workbench (Qiagen).
Results: A recurrent fusion TFG::ADGRG7 was found in 4/58 (7%) 
MBT, 2/36 (6%) MC, 1/23 (4%) SBT, and 1/53 (2%) LGSC. Inter-
estingly, a known targetable recurrent fusion FGFR2::KIAA1217 
was found only in the LGSC sample set (2/53; 4%). In total, eight 
different fusions were identified in 6/58 (10%) MBT, 2/36 (6%) 
MC, 1/23 (4%) SBT, 6/53 (11%) LGSC, and 1/6 (17%) HGSC. The 
fusion partners included known or potential therapeutic targets, 
such as BRAF, EGFR, FGFR2, NF1.
Conclusion: The applied RNA-Seq approach revealed several 
known or novel fusions across different types of primary epithelial 
ovarian tumours. Extension of the analysed cohort and identifica-
tion of fusions is ongoing and eventually will show fusion patterns, 
the role of gene fusions in targeted therapy and differential diag-
nostics in rare ovarian primary tumours.

Development of a murine-model of oral carcinogenesis: a rapid 
tool for biomarker and anti-tumour drug discovery

Khan, J. Safdar
*Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan
Background & objectives: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) 
is the commonest malignancy in Pakistani males and second only to 
breast cancer in females. We devised a novel accelerated murine model 
of oral carcinogenesis that can be exploited to identify molecules of 
diagnostic/therapeutic/prognostic significance.
Methods: Total 40 healthy male, 6-8 weeks-old, 20-22 gram 
Naval Medical Research Institute(NMRI) outbred-strain mice 
were recruited. Of these, 25 were topically applied with 0.5% 
9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene in the lower lip for 20 weeks and 
15 were used as controls. Harvested tissues were fixed and stained 
with hematoxylin and eosin. Additionally, expressions of CK 5/6, 
p53, and Ki-67 were investigated by immunohistochemistry.
Results: All 25 mice (100%) who underwent accelerated carcino-
genic regime developed tumours/lesions. The earliest lesion was 
developed on day 33 while the highest number of days taken for 
development of a lesion was 126. Average number of days taken 
by our mice to develop lesion was 84.56 days. Of 25 mice, 21 
developed moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and 
1 showed dysplastic features with foci of invasion. Three mice 
were found dead despite developing lesions. CK 5/6 showed strong 
positivity (100%) and p53 and Ki-67 showed patchy (<30%) strong 
positivity in OSCC suggesting the similarity of our model to human 
OSCC. Controls did not show any morphological changes through-
out the study.
Conclusion: We present an accelerated, immunocompetent murine 
model of oral carcinogenesis using 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthar-
acene in NMRI outbred strain mice. This model is close to human 
carcinogenesis that can be exploited as a tool to investigate and 
underpin molecular circuitry involved in oral carcinogenesis and 
to investigate various bio-molecules of diagnostic, therapeutic and 
prognostic significance.

The effect of mitochondrial energy metabolism modulators on 
cytotoxicity of cisplatin and pemetrexed in mesothelioma

*University of Zagreb, School of Medicine, Croatia
Background & objectives: The aim of this experiment was to inves-
tigate whether pharmacological modification of mitochondrial energy 
metabolism together with high glucose concentrations could potentially 
be used for a more successful treatment of malignant mesothelioma.
Methods: To access the resistance of mesothelioma cells to anti-
neoplastic agents, cell proliferation was quantified in the Mero-
14 mesothelioma cell line after a 3 day treatment with different 
concentrations of antineoplastic agents pemetrexed and cisplatin 
(C/P) together with high glucose concentration alone or combined 
with mitochondrial energy metabolism modulators UK-5099, DNP, 
DCA. Cell proliferation was estimated using the MTT assay.
Results: The addition of glucose alone did not significantly alter 
the cytotoxic effect of C/P and neither did UK-5099, DNP, nor 
DCA show an effect on cell proliferation when used at lower

concentrations. The obtained results did not show a significant 
difference between C/P alone and C/P in combination with low 
doses of mitochondrial energy metabolism modulators. In contrast, 
at higher concentrations, UK-5099, DNP, and DCA potentiated 
the cytotoxicity of C/P. When combined with a high glucose con-
centration, lower concentrations of DNP and DCA potentiated the 
cytotoxic effect of C/P and at higher concentrations this effect 
was annulled.
Conclusion: The presented results showed that all three tested 
mitochondrial energy metabolism modulators, UK-5099, DNP and 
DCA, when used in higher concentrations, have a similar pattern 
of action; potentiating the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin and pem-
etrexed. This suggests a synergistic effect of antineoplastic agents 
and mitochondrial metabolism modulators on reducing mesotheli-
oma cell proliferation. Mitochondrial metabolism modulators have 
potential for mesothelioma treatment. However, further studies are 
needed to examine their precise mechanisms of action.

gramming cytoprotective pathways in malignant mesothelioma

ogy, Hungary
Background & objectives: Patients diagnosed with clear cell renal 
cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have poor prognosis. For this reason, the more 
detailed molecular characterisation of the primary tumour, and metas-
tasis, are crucial to select the proper adjuvant therapy.
Methods: As a potential molecular biomarker, to follow the tran-
scriptional kinetics in 30 ccRCC patients, we analysed γH2A.X, 
H3K4me3, and H3K9me3 and the alterations of RNAPII by immu-
nohistochemical staining. The variabilities between the tumorous 
and non-tumorous parts of the tissue were detected using quantita-
tive image analysis by monitoring 100 cells either the tumorous or 
the control part of the tissue sections.
Results: We detected a synergistic elevation both in H3K4me3 
and RNAPII level which confirms the reliability of our data. 
The present study also establishes a strong correlation between 
H3K4me3 and RNAPII marks. We also found that the alteration in 
the global level of H3K9me3 corresponding with changes in the 
level of H3K4me3 and RNAPII was correlated with the presence of 
ccRCC. Finally, in ccRCC tumour-derived specimens, we observed 
increased γH2A.X level, which is the hallmark of persistence DNA 
damage. In correlation with the perpetual presence of γH2A.X, in 
ccRCC patients considerable number of DNA damage or insuf-
ficient DNA repair takes place.
Conclusion: Data obtained from the analyses were used to iden-
tify potential prognostic features and to associate them with the 
progression. These markers might have a value to predict patient 
outcomes based on their individual cellular background. These 
results also support that detection of any alteration in the level of 
H3K4me3, H3K9me3, and γH2A.X can account for valuable infor-
mation for presuming the progression of ccRCC and the clinical 
benefits to select the most efficient personalised therapy.

*Department of Patohistology, University Clinical Centar of Ser-
bia, Belgrade, Serbia
Background & objectives: Long non coding RNA, H19 is an 
imprinted, maternally expressed gene, usually deregulated in different 
cancer types, including rectal cancer. This study aimed to investigate 
H19 role as a potential biomarker to predict therapy response in rectal 
cancer patients.
Methods: The study included 14 patients diagnosed with rectal 
cancer, treated with neoadjuvant chemoradio therapy (nCRT). RNA 
was isolated by TRIzol reagent from samples of rectal cancer tissue 
before and after nCRT. Relative expression of H19 was normal-
ized to housekeeping GAPDH gene, and expression was analysed 
by quantitative real-time PCR. Relative expression of H19 was 
calculated by 2-ΔCt method.
Results: Relative expression of H19 was significantly increased 
in rectal cancer tissue after nCRT (0.244±0.408) compared to 
the tissue before nCRT (0.043±0.055), p=0.004, Wilcoxon test. 
According to tumour regression grade (TRG), 85.71% (12/14) of 
patients did not respond, while 14.28% (2/14) responded to pre-
operative CRT. Responders (TRG1, TRG2) and non-responders 
(TRG3, TRG4) did not differ in H19 expression in tumour tissue 
before (p=0.659, Mann-Whitney U test) as well as after nCRT 
(p=0.999, Mann-Whitney U test). Receiver operating curve analy-
sis indicates that H19 expression in colorectal tissue before nCRT 
can not be used as a biomarker for distinguishing responders from 
non-responders (AUC=0.625, 95%CI=0.257-0.992, p=0.583).
Conclusion: Our study suggests H19 upregulation upon neoadju-
vant chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer. The potential predictive 
value of H19 as a biomarker of therapy response should be studied 
in a larger group of patients.

BRG1-deficient non-small cell lung carcinomas. Clinicopatho-
logic characteristics and correlation with SMARCA4 mutations

Calvo, C. Alenda González, F.I. Aranda López
*HGU Dr. Balmis (Alicante), Spain
Background & objectives: SMARCA genes are responsible for chro-
matin remodelling. Inactivating mutations in SMARCA4 induce BRG1 
deficiency and thus a set of malignancies, mostly undifferentiated car-
cinomas. To facilitate translation of preclinical findings into clinical 
studies, we assessed clinicopathological features of BRG1-deficient 
tumours.
Methods: Data sets from our department were reviewed to 
determine the prevalence of SMARCA4-mutant non-small 
cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) and describe their clinico-
pathologic characteristics. Genetic alterations were identified

using Oncomine Comprehensive (Thermofisher) NGS. BRG1 
expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and cor-
related with SMARCA4. Medical records were retrospectively 
reviewed for clinicopathologic, molecular characteristics and 
treatment outcomes. Survival analyses were performed using 
Kaplan-Meier.
Results: We detected SMARCA4 genomic alterations in 11.6% 
(n=34/292) of NSCLCs. Truncating missense mutations com-
prised 22 cases, nonsense 9, frameshift 3 and INDEL 2. 44.1% 
of SMARCA4-mutant NSCLCs (n=15/34) showed loss of expres-
sion of BRG1, most (80%) of which had truncating SMARCA4 
mutations. Overall, 92% (n=12/13) of evaluated NSCLCs with 
nonsense, frameshift or INDEL mutations lacked BRG1 expres-
sion. Deficient BRG1 expression was detected predominantly in 
solid adenocarcinomas (G3) and NSCLC-NOS with co-occurring 
mutations in KRAS (n=8; 3 G12C), TP53 (n=4), STK11 (n=4) 
and MAP2K2 (n=3). Deficiency on BRG1 was associated with 
lower disease-free survival (log rank p=0.049) and a tendency to 
associate with lower overall survival (p=0.2) in comparison with 
non-BRG1-deficient.
Conclusion: BRG1 deficiency is enriched in NSCLCs with trun-
cating SMARCA4 mutations. Clinical outcomes are poor in this 
molecular subgroup, highlighting the importance of developing 
novel strategies to target unique vulnerabilities associated with the 
BRG1-deficient state.

*Invitae Corporation, San Francisco, CA, USA, France
Background & objectives: Next-generation sequencing has become 
the standard for tumour sequencing, but most laboratories use sequen-
tial workflows.
We optimized our workflow by using RNA-based FusionPlex® 
assay as the primary approach and assessed the ability of this assay 
to detect fusions and mutations.
Methods: A total of 43 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) 
tissues from patients with various cancer types (colorectal, lung, 
sarcoma, and pancreatic cancers) were included in this study.
After RNA and DNA extraction, all samples were assessed using 
the FusionPlex® assay for gene fusions, SNVs/indels and custom 
STS, for the detection of SNVs /indels and sequenced using Illu-
mina platform or Idylla assay.
Results: Repeatability of the assay was assessed using a triplicate 
within the same run, and reproducibility by analysing 3 different 
samples in two different runs. Limit of detection was evaluated 
using RNA input from 20 to 250ng.
Among the 43 analysed samples, 35 SNVs or indels were previously 
identified using DNAseq or Idylla. The total concordance for indels 
and SNVs for ALK, BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, RET and ROS1 genes was 
97.1% (Sensitivity=0.97, Specificity=1.0). Only one mutation G12V 
of KRAS with a VAF of 3.3% has not been found using RNAseq. 
Repeatability and reproducibility of the assay were both 100%. Finally, 
20ng of RNA were found sufficient as a minimal input.
Conclusion: Analytical concordance, repeatability, reproduc-
ibility, and a robust limit of detection was documented in this 
assessment of the RNAseq approach. This data supports the 
RNAseq first approach, using FusionPlex® research assay (Invi-
tae), and a decision has been made to adopt this workflow in 
our laboratory.

Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, Groningen, The 
Netherlands
Background & objectives: Manual extraction of molecular diagnostic 
results from narrative pathology reports is labour intensive, causing 
delay in analysis of real-world data. The aim of this study is to develop 
an automated method for data extraction from narrative pathology 
reports.
Methods: For automated selection of reports indicating the presence of the 
KRAS p.(G12C) mutation, a 5-fold cross validation Random Forest model 
was performed using TF-IDF transformed report text. For analysis of NTRK 
fusions, an SVC model was used with a supplementary word-association 
model. Previous manually extracted results from PALGA reports were used 
as a gold-standard.
Results: Pathology reports deposited in the Dutch nationwide 
pathology databank (PALGA) of all NSCLC patients in 2015 
were manually curated (n=2,427) for reporting of the KRAS 
p.(G12C). The algorithm achieved high sensitivity (98.7%) and 
specificity (100%) to identify this mutation in narrative text. In 
addition, pathology reports mentioning TRK or NTRK between 
2017 and 2020 were manually curated (n=7,457) for reporting of 
TRK protein expression and/or NTRK fusions. A first validation 
cohort demonstrated an acceptable sensitivity (88.0%) and speci-
ficity (95.0%) of the algorithm. TRK expression was generally not 
described as a dichotomous result, leading to large variation in 
reporting. All false-negative cases were ambiguous reporting of 
TRK immunohistochemistry results.
Conclusion: The algorithm that was developed for identification of 
pathology reports mentioning KRAS p.(G12C) demonstrated high 
accuracy. In contrast to KRAS mutations, the prevalence of TRK 
expression or NTRK fusion is low, which hampers the training of 
the algorithm with only a low absolute number of unambiguous 
TRK/NTRK positive cases. The observed variety in reporting of 
TRK results requires further optimization of the TRK/NTRK algo-
rithm. Nevertheless, automation-supported analysis of pathology 
reports is a promising tool for rapid assessment of real-world data.

lence and prognostic significance

*General Hospital of Alicante. ISABIAL, Spain
Background & objectives: KRAS-G12C variant, which has recently 
been proved to be druggable, is the most frequent KRAS mutation, 
accounting for the 13% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We 
aim to determine its prevalence, concurrent mutations, histopathologic 
profile and prognostic value.
Methods: We used Next-Generation Sequencing with the 
Oncomine Comprehensive panel to identify KRAS mutation sta-
tus and other genetic alterations in 400 patients from our institu-
tion. Pathological findings were retrospectively reviewed using 
previous biopsy slides. Clinical data was extracted from medical 
records, including age, gender, smoking history, treatment, stage,

disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Survival 
analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier.
Results: In this cohort of 400 patients with NSCLC, 120 
were detected to harbour KRAS mutation (89% adenocarci-
nomas, 10% non-specified NSCLC and 1% squamous cell car-
cinoma). KRAS mutated cases encompassed 63% males and 
37% females, with a median age at diagnosis of 66 years, 67% 
were heavy smokers (defined as greater than or equal to 30 
pack-years) and 51% presented at advanced stages. KRAS-
G12C was the most common KRAS mutation subtype (46%) 
and it was associated with a shorter median OS (p=0.006) and 
a tendency to associate lower DFS (p=0.14) than non-KRAS-
G12C. KRAS-G12C subgroup tended to include more females, 
smokers and elderly patients (p=0.06-0.14) in comparison with 
non-KRAS-G12C.
Conclusion: G12C subtype, which was the most frequent KRAS 
mutation in this sample, was related to aggressive behaviour and 
poor prognosis. No other significant differences were confirmed, 
except a tendency in KRAS-G12C subgroup to include more 
females, smokers and elderly patients in comparison with non-
KRAS-G12C. Our study could enhance higher levels of accuracy 
estimating prognosis and response to novel targeted therapies.

Background & objectives: The evaluation of genomic alterations 
in primary resected NSCLC and matched lymph nodes can be useful 
in stratifying patients at risk of tumour relapse, in detecting occult 
metastases, and in selecting patients for adjuvant treatments.
Methods: Genomic DNA (gDNA) extracted from tissue sections of 
six resected NSCLC (T1-2) and from samples of mediastinal lymph 
nodes (MLN) with negative cytology were analysed by Next Gen-
eration Sequencing (NGS) with a customized SureSelect® XTHS2 
kit (Agilent Tech, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
Results: We observed pathogenic variants in 91.7% of the 
sequenced samples (six tumour and five MLN). Different genetic 
variants between tumour and lymph nodes were observed in five 
cases. Only one patient presented the same genetic alteration in 
both samples.
Conclusion: We demonstrated different somatic pathogenic 
variants between the tumour tissue and the cytological negative 
matched lymph nodes, suggesting that these mutations were not 
drivers for relapse or metastases, and that different subclones 
carrying other mutated genes might progress to metastatic 
adenocarcinoma. Thus, combining molecular tests to the 
cytological analyses of MLN may contribute for the development 
of an integrative Tumour, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging.

Concordance between FISH and NGS in detecting t(11;14) sta-
tus in patients with multiple myeloma

*AbbVie, France
Background & objectives: The t(11;14) translocation has been identi-
fied as a predictive biomarker of response to venetoclax in relapsed/
refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The objective of this study was to 
assess the concordance between FISH and NGS for t(11;14) detection 
in patients with MM.
Methods: This was a retrospective, single-centre, non-inter-
ventional study. Bone marrow aspirates were collected from an 
approved biobank with informed consent. The presence of t(11;14) 
was detected by FISH using the Vysis IGH/CCND1 XT DF FISH 
probe kit and NGS using a targeted NGS panel and NextSeq. 
Cohen’s Kappa was used to determine the concordance between 
the two diagnostic techniques.
Results: A total of 130 samples were analysed for t(11;14) status; 
65 at diagnosis, 60 at relapse and 5 unspecified. The samples con-
sisted of 76 males and 54 females with a median age of 69 (range: 
43 – 91). Both NGS and FISH detected t(11;14) in 66 samples 
with a concordance rate of 100% (Cohen’s Kappa=1). Concord-
ance rate (100%) was consistent within the diagnostic and relapse 
samples. The 5 unspecified samples were t(11;14)+. There were 
no discordant samples.
Conclusion: The results from this study demonstrate that FISH and 
NGS techniques have a 100% concordance rate for the detection of 
t(11;14) in MM patient samples. Both FISH and NGS-based testing 
can detect t(11;14) in patient samples allowing an individualized 
approach to patient care.

Stability of t(11;14) status by FISH between diagnosis and 
relapse in patients with multiple myeloma

*AbbVie, USA
Background & objectives: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal 
plasma cell malignancy characterized by multistep genetic alterations 
and frequent relapse. We evaluated the stability of t(11;14), an early 
genetic event and predictive biomarker for venetoclax activity, in MM 
patients between diagnosis and relapse.
Methods: This was a retrospective, single-centre, non-interven-
tional study. Longitudinal bone marrow aspirates (BMA) from 
patients at different subtypes of disease (monoclonal gammopathy 
of undetermined significance [MGUS]; smoldering MM [SMM]); 
newly diagnosed MM [NDMM]; relapsed/refractory MM [RRMM]; 
and plasma cell leukaemia [PCL]) were collected. t(11;14) was 
detected using interphase FISH analysis of BMA samples enriched 
for plasma cells using CD138 immunomagnetic beads.
Results: Among 272 patients, 118 were t(11;14)+ and 154 were 
t(11;14)- with a median age (years [range]) of 60 [37 – 85] and 63 
[34 – 85], respectively. The median number (range) of longitudinal 
FISH assessments were: t(11;14)+: 2 (2 – 4); and t(11;14)-: 2 (2 
– 5). All t(11;14)+ patients evaluated between diagnosis and first 
relapse (n = 87) remained positive with a median of 29.1 months 
(range, 1.9 – 149.4) between FISH assessments. All t(11;14)+ 
samples evaluated between diagnosis and multiple relapses (n=16) 
remained positive with 43.3 months (range, 11.4 – 196.9) between 
FISH assessments. t(11;14) was detected in MGUS/SMM patients 
(n=15) from diagnosis to progression (median-time: 28.7 months).
Conclusion: This study is the first confirmation in a large, longitudinal 
cohort of patients with MM that t(11;14) is a primary genetic event that 
is stable across the course of disease from MGUS/SMM to MM and 
across lines of therapy from NDMM to RRMM. All t(11;14)+ patients 
remained positive from diagnosis to first and any relapse thus provid-
ing confidence in this biomarker when considering t(11;14) directed 
treatment. No t(11;14)- patients acquired the translocation at relapse.

cinomas in the east Black Sea region of Turkey
Z. Sagnak Yilmaz*, Z. Turkmen Usta, S. Aydin Mungan, S. Ersoz
*Karadeniz Technical University, Faculty of Medicine, Pathology 
Department, Trabzon, Turkey
Background & objectives: EGFR gene mutations are most common 
in exons 18-21. Exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R point mutation 
constitute 90% of them. We aimed to detect the frequency of EGFR 
gene mutations in the east Black Sea region of Turkey.
Methods: We investigated the mutational status of 488 cases diag-
nosed with non-small cell lung carcinomas between January 2019 
and March 2022 with next-generation sequencing. QIAsec New 
Solid Custom MSI Panel was used.
Results: We detected EGFR mutations in 10.2% of the cases (50 
patients). It is mostly observed in exons 19, 20, and 21 which were 
16 cases (32%) in exon 21, 15 cases (30%) in exon 19, and 12 cases 
(24%) in exon 20. In addition, EGFR mutations were detected in 
exon 15 in 7 cases (14%). Exon 19 deletions were seen in 14 cases 
(28%) and exon 21 L858R point mutations were seen in 10 cases 
(20%). Exon 20 T790M mutation, which causes tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor resistance, was observed in 3 of the cases. EGFR and 
TP53 co-mutations were detected in 8 patients.
Conclusion: Consistent with the literature, the most frequently 
observed mutations were exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R 
mutation. Our results demonstrated the frequency of EGFR gene 
mutations in the east Black Sea region of Turkey. Although there 
are no clinical studies on exon 15 EGFR mutations in the literature, 
exon 15 mutations were detected in 14% of the cases in our study. 
This result may shed light on future studies.

Tumour PD-L1 expression and molecular profiling are not 
associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced thyroid 
dysfunction in advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
Patients
T. Neuman*, G. Vainer, A. Horesh
*Hadassah-Hebrew university medical centre, Jerusalem, Israel
Background & objectives: Immune-checkpoint-inhibitors (ICIs) has 
been revolutionary in treating advanced NSCLC, however- frequently 
associated with thyroid-related adverse events. We aimed to explore the 
association between patient characteristics, tumour PD-L1 expression 
and molecular profile with the development of thyroid dysfunction in 
these patients.
Methods: Single centre, retrospective study assessing the asso-
ciation between clinical parameters, tumour PD-L1 expression, 
molecular profiling, and the development of thyroid irAEs in 
107 NSCLC patients treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors from 
April 2016 to July 2020. All patients were euthyroid at baseline 
and had at least two TSH measurements post treatment initiation.
Results: Overall, 37 (34.6%) patients developed any thyroid dysfunc-
tion and 18 (16.8%) developed overt thyroid dysfunction. There was 
no association between PD-L1 staining intensity in the tumour and the 
development of thyroid dysfunction. TP53 mutation was less likely to be 
associated with the development of any thyroid dysfunction (p < 0.05). 
There was no association found between the development of thyroid 
dysfunction and EGFR, ROS, ALK or KRAS mutations. There was 
no association between PD-L1 expression and time to develop thyroid 
dysfunction.
Conclusion: This study did not demonstrate an association 
between PD-L1 expression and the development of thyroid 
dysfunction in advanced NSCLC patients treated with PD-L1 
or PD-1 inhibitors, suggesting that the thyroid-related adverse 
events are unrelated to PD-L1 expression in the tumour.

Identification of Maml1 as a novel negative regulator of Itch 
E3 ubiquitin ligase activity: new insights in cancer biology
S. Zema*, M. Pelullo, A. Montalti, M. De Carolis, A. Villari, I. 
Screpanti, D. Bellavia
*Sapienza University, Dept. of Molecular Medicine, Italy
Background & objectives: Maml1 is a transcriptional coactivator in 
several pathways, such as Notch and Hedgehog, directly involved in 
the onset/development of several cancers. Here, we demonstrate that 
Maml1 can control the expression levels of Gli1 and Notch1 proteins 
at post-translational level.
Methods: We utilized different experimental approaches: immuno-
precipitation and ubiquitination assays in both in vitro and ex vivo 
(Maml1-/- murine model) cell lines; Maml1 silencing with CRISPR/
Cas9 technology; analysis of Itch post-translational modification; 
siRNA-mediated depletion of Maml1 in breast and colon cancer cell 
lines; wound healing assay; proliferation assays.
Results: Gli1 and Notch1 are both regulated at post-translational 
level by Itch/E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate Maml1 capabil-
ity to regulate Notch1 and Gli1 expression levels through Itch 
inhibition. For the first time, we identify the functional role of 
Maml1 C-terminal domain as a post-translational regulator of 
target proteins. Moreover, we pinpoint the molecular mecha-
nism through which Maml1 acts as negative regulator of Itch, by 
inducing auto-ubiquitination events. Therefore, Maml1 increases 
the expression levels of Gli1 and Notch1 oncogenic proteins, by 
switching off Itch activity. Accordingly, in pathological con-
texts, such as breast and colon cancers, Maml1 silencing impinge 
on Notch1 and Gli1 protein levels, hindering proliferation and 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition events.
Conclusion: Overall, our data suggest a protective role mediated 
by Maml1 on Itch-target proteins involved in cancer biology. 
Indeed, the ability of Maml1 to negatively regulate Itch activity 
could have an impact in the activation of oncogenic pathways, 
such as Hedgehog and Notch. The identification of Maml1 as a 
novel negative regulator of Itch adds a piece in the understand-
ing of tumour biology and could help to set out new therapeutic 
approaches based on the dual role of Maml1.

Characterising the cellular architecture of the tumour micro-
environment using imaging mass cytometry and digital image 
analysis with the HALO® and HALO AI™ platform
G. Lioux*, K. Collins, N. Carmell
*Indica Labs, Inc., USA
Background & objectives: The identification of biomarkers, and their 
spatial distribution in the tumour microenvironment (TME) can help 
establishing a prognosis and cure. Here we show the analysis of the 
TME using the HALO® and HALO AI™ platform in mass cytometry 
multiplexed images.
Methods: Here, we present image analysis of more than eight different 
cancer types, such as bladder urothelial carcinoma, prostate adenocar-
cinoma, and lung adenosquamous carcinoma, using the HALO and 
HALO AI software (Indica Labs, Inc.). Samples are formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumour biopsies prepared for imag-
ing mass cytometry using Marpar® reagents from Fluidigm. Images 
were acquired with the Fluidigm Hyperion™ platform.

Results: To circumvent morphologic cell variability, HALO 
AI was used to create a Nuclei Segmentation network that per-
formed well across all cancer types analysed. Rather than relying 
on PanCK and E-cadherin biomarkers to identify tumour cells, a 
HALO AI Nuclear Phenotyper algorithm was trained to recog-
nize tumour cells from stromal cells independently of biomarker 
expression and staining variability. The Nuclear Phenotyper and 
Nuclear Segmentation networks were embedded into the Highplex 
FL module of HALO for analysis of tumoral proliferation, using 
pHH3 and Ki67 biomarkers. The Spatial Analysis module of HALO 
was used to examine the proximity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and 
macrophages and their level of infiltration of the tumour margin.
Conclusion: HALO and HALO AI software provide easily adapt-
able tools for the analysis of the TME in any tissue type and with 
any set of markers. It can be applied to IMC images in order to 
standardise cell segmentation, tissue segmentation, cell phenotyp-
ing and spatial analysis.

Genomic landscape analysis of ERBB3-mutated human can-
cers reveals common co-occurrence with activating ERBB2 
alterations
I. Odintsov*, R. Somwar, M. Ladanyi
*Brigham and Women’s Hospital, USA
Background & objectives: ERBB3 is a member of the ERBB recep-
tor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family, which includes EGFR, ERBB2 and 
ERBB4. In this study we describe the prevalence of activating ERBB3 
mutations across human cancers and analyse the genomic landscape of 
ERBB3-mutated tumours.
Methods: Retrospective review of MSK-IMPACT (DNA-based 
NGS) data (January 2014-June 2021) was performed (n=72000 
pts). ERBB3 mutations were annotated as hotspot and/or activat-
ing using OncoKB database and current literature. Data analysis, 
visualization and statistical analysis were performed using R Studio 
and GraphPad PRISM.
Results: Out of 72000 patients tested, 582 patients (1%) harboured 
an activating ERBB3 alteration. The majority of tumours with 
ERBB mutations were colorectal, gastric and oesophageal cancers, 
small bowel carcinomas, bladder urothelial carcinomas, uterine 
endometrioid carcinomas, and breast cancers. Most mutations in 
ERBB3 occurred in the extracellular domain (85%) with only 15% 
found in the kinase domain, consistent with the allosteric activator 
function of this receptor. Concurrent alterations in ERBB2 were 
found in 19% of ERBB3-altered tumours and were present across 
the above tumour types. Of note, no such association was observed 
for EGFR.
Conclusion: ERBB3 mutations are potential driver alterations with 
no FDA-approved therapy. A significant proportion of activating 
ERBB3 mutations co-occur with activating ERBB2 alterations sug-
gesting synergistic tumourigenic effects. Our work highlights the 
importance of broad genomic testing to detect ERBB3 mutations, 
as these may identify patients potentially responsive to ERBB2 
inhibition or antibody-mediated targeting of ERBB3.

Mir-9 and their putative targets expression in prostate cancer
I. Benedetti*, L. Barrios, J. Rebollo
*Universidad de Cartagena, Colombia
Background & objectives: There are divergent descriptions of the role 
of mir-9 in terms of its support or suppression of tumour development 
and metastasis in different tumours. It has been found overexpressed in 
prostate cancer (PCa) tissue compared to benign prostate tissue (BPT).
Methods: In a prostate tissue microarray with 145 BPT and 149 
PCa cores, from prostatectomy samples of patients with localized 
PCa, using miRNAscope® 2.5LSRedISH, miR-9-5p expression 
was scored and compared between both conditions. Possible mir-9 
targets were sought in miRTarBase, their expression was explored 
in the tumour tissues of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) through 
bioinformatics tools of GEPIA2 web server.
Results: MiR-9 was overexpressed in PCa compared to BPT. In 
the miRTarBase, 526 mir-9 target genes validated with at least 
one experimental assay were identified, and 24 genes with the 
strongest evidence of interaction with miR-9 were selected. The 
higher expression level in PCa was for CDH1, RAB34, AP3B1, 
CCNG1, SRF, TGFB1, ID2, FOXO3 y CCND1. When compared 
with BPT, the expression of 3 genes (BCL6, RAB34 and NTRK3) 
was downregulated in PCa, while CDH1 was overexpressed in the 
prostate cancer tissues (P < 0.001). Moreover, miR-9 gene targets 
CDH1, BCL6, CCND1 and PRDM1 showed truncating mutations, 
amplifications, deep deletion and splice mutations in some of the 
cancer datasets.
Conclusion: The analysis of the mir-9 and their target genes 
expression in normal versus cancer prostate tissues suggest that 
this miRNA may be regulating tumour initiation, progression, 
and metastasis processes through the downregulation of the 
Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 3 (NTRK3), which has 
been found altered in breast carcinomas and other cancers, or the 
downregulation of Cadherin 1 (CDH1), whose loss of function 
is thought to contribute to cancer progression by increasing 
proliferation, invasion, and metastasis.

Clinicopathological features of primary pulmonary Hodgkin 
lymphoma: a multicentre study and literature review of 110 
cases
H. Jung*, T. Lee
*CHA Ilsan Medical Center, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Primary pulmonary Hodgkin lymphoma 
(PPHL) is extremely rare compared to secondary lung involvement by 
Hodgkin lymphoma. And overall clinicopathological characteristics 
has been unclear because of its low prevalence.
Methods: We proceeded the multicentre retrospective study of ten 
cases histologically confirmed as PPHL from 1995 to 2019. With 
analysing clinicopathological features of these 10 cases, additional 
literature review of 100 cases was conducted together. We analysed 
the total 110 cases of PPHL about sex/age distribution, radiologic 
findings, histologic subtype and treatment.
Results: Female to male ratio was 6:4 and mean age was 41 years old. 
Although three patients had no symptom, seven had several localized 
and general symptoms including cough, sputum, chest discomfort/
pain and weight loss. With chemotherapy, five had complete remis-
sion and three had partial response. Some cases had not been diag-
nosed as PPHL in initial needle biopsy, so that three patients underwent 
surgical resection. Differential diagnosis of PPHL included epithelial 
malignancy, such as adenocarcinoma, inflammatory diseases like tuber-
culosis, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour, IgG4 related lung dis-
ease and other hematologic malignancy. With literature review, female 
predominance and a single peak at younger age were identified. Radio-
logical findings were variable often with cavitation.

Conclusion: Histologically, differential diagnosis can be extremely 
challenging on small needle biopsy or frozen procedure. Especially, 
if biopsy is not satisfactory, PPHL can mimic infectious or inflam-
matory disease (tuberculosis, granulomatous inflammation, etc.) as 
well as other pulmonary malignancy (adenocarcinoma). This study 
and literature review can be helpful for pathologists to diagnose 
PPHL properly.

Five-year experience of evaluation of PD-L1 expression on 
advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma – single centre study
J. Stojsic*
*University Clinical Centre Serbia, Serbia
Background & objectives: About 80% of all diagnosed lung carci-
noma is of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) histological type. 
The aim was to evaluate results of PD-L1 expression on advanced non-
small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in five-year period.
Methods: The percentage of expression PD-L1 (clone 22C3) 
in malignant cells was correlated on small and surgical samples 
according to the following parameters: age, gender, histological 
subtypes of NSCLC, stromal immunological/inflammatory cells 
and adequacy of samples. PD-L1 testing on demand and its expres-
sion was divided into three groups: low, middle and high.
Results: PD-L1 expression was evaluated in 802 patients, 2/3 of 
them were male and the most frequent in age 61-70, 64% ADC, 
20% SCC and 13.3%-NOS. Low PD-L1 expression was found 
in 53%, weak in 19% and high in 28% NSCLC. Inflammatory/
immunological cells were registered in 45% of samples with high 
PD-L1 expression. Weak and moderate PD-L1 expression among 
genders was similar, without significance (p=0.689). Weak and 
high PD-L1 expression among aged groups was similar (p=0.645). 
PD-L1 expression according to histological subtypes of NSCLC 
was not significant (p=0.455). Low PD-L1 expression was found in 
inadequate samples (p<0.001). Inflammatory/immunological cells 
with PD-L1 expression were significantly higher in patients with 
higher expression (p<0.001).
Conclusion: High PD-L1 expression was found in 28% NSCLC 
without correlation with histological subtype, gender and age 
of patients. High PD-L1 expression was associated with PD-L1 
expression in stromal immunological cells. Presented results was 
similar with published ones in relevant literature.

Role of microRNAs miR-193b, miR-7, miR-25 and miR-301a 
as potential diagnostic marker in non small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC)
N. Krishnani*, N. Kumari, H. Baranwal, S. Singh, A. Nath
*Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate, Institute of Medical Sciences, India
Background & objectives: NSCLC is leading cause of cancer-related 
death world over. MicroRNAs are emerging as potential non-invasive 
biomarker for early detection. We studied the role of circulating micro-
RNAs miR-193b, miR-301a, miR-7 and miR-25 as non-invasive bio-
marker in NSCLC in Indian population.
Methods: Plasma samples from histology proven 101 NSCLC 
cases and 28 non-neoplastic controls including 18 chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease and 10 healthy individuals were tested for 
expression of microRNAs miR-193b, miR-7, miR-25 and miR-301a 
by real time PCR. Dysregulated microRNAs were correlated with 
clinicopathological features.
Results: miR-193b (p=0.034) and miR-7 (p=0.4) were upregulated 
while miR-25 (p=0.2) and miR-301a (p=0.5) were downregulated 
in NSCLC compared to controls. The AUC was 0.636 (95% CI, 
0.522-0.750; p =0.03). There was no significant association of 
microRNA dysregulation with age, gender, smoking, alcoholism, 
tuberculosis, lymph node status, pleural effusion and disease stage. 
miR-25 downregulation correlated with adenocarcinoma histology 
(p=0.03). miR-193b downregulation significantly correlated with 
survival (14.9 ± 1.5 months (p=0.03). Disease progression was 
seen in 12 patients in upregulated and in 3 patients in downregu-
lated group with progression free survival of 9.7 ±1.1 months in 
upregulated 12.3 ±0.5 months in downregulated group (p value 
=0.04).
Conclusion: miR-193b was significantly upregulated while miR-
25 and miR-301 were downregulated in NSCLC but were statisti-
cally non-significant. These may act as pointers towards NSCLC 
diagnosis and suggest diligent search of malignancy in these 
patients. However, microRNA profiling and validation studies 
are required to develop microRNAs as a diagnostic tool.

Alveolar adenoma - clinicopathological characteristics of four 
cases
A. Lovrenski*, N. Gardic, D. Tegeltija, T. Lakić
*Faculty of Medicine, University of Novi Sad, Serbia
Background & objectives: Alveolar adenoma is a rare, benign tumour 
of the lung which have broad spectrum of differential diagnosis. In 
order to minimize the possibility of errors in the diagnosis of simi-
lar lung lesions, pathohistological finding should be completed with 
immunohistochemistry.
Methods: Retrospective study included 4 cases of lung alveolar 
adenoma, diagnosed between 2010 and 2020. All patients were 
treated surgically, in one case with video-assisted thoracoscopy, 
while in others a thoracotomy was performed. The type of resection 
performed was wedge resection and lobectomy (3:1). In all cases, 
the tumour was located in the lower lobes.
Results: Frozen section findings in all cases were classified as benign 
lesions. On FFPE sections, tumours showed characteristic multicystic 
morphology with cystic structures lined with regular pneumocytes 
separated by septa, built of spindle cells with lymphocyte infil-
trates. Granular eosinophilic detritus was found in the cysts lumens. 
Tumours were relatively clearly demarcated from surrounding paren-
chyma, without capsule and with expansive growth compressing the 
lung parenchyma. Immunohistochemical analysis in all cases showed 
immunoreactivity of epithelial component to TTF-1, panCK, EMA, 
while the immunomarkers D2-40, HMB45, MelanA and S-100 were 
negative. The stromal component was Vimentin positive in all cases, 
while in one case in addition to vimentin, SMA and CD34 were posi-
tive too.
Conclusion: The features of alveolar adenoma may mimic other 
types of lung tumours, consequently leading to difficulties in the 
differential diagnosis. Thus, accurate diagnosis of alveolar ade-
noma is based on a combination of pathological and immunohis-
tochemical findings.

Background & objectives: Frozen section (FS) histology is the most 
commonly used method for intraoperative evaluation of the lung 
lesions, however it requires significant capacity in equipment, staff 
and time. Imprint cytology (IC) is a fast, cheap and reliable alternative.
Methods: The retrospective study included 193 patients who were 
hospitalized to clarify aetiology and treat the infiltrative lung lesion. 
During the diagnostic/therapeutic surgery, tissue sample was obtained 
and imprint was taken. The samples were processed as standard pro-
cedure for FS histological analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive 
and negative predictive value for determining adenocarcinoma were 
calculated in a relation to final pathohistological diagnosis.
Results: Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive 
value for IC were, respectively, 89,86%, 100%, 100% and 94,66%, 
while the same parameters on FS were, respectively, 94,2%, 100%, 
100% and 96.86%. The adequacy of IC was 96,37%. Cytologi-
cal findings, of later proven adenocarcinomas, were characterized 
as adenocarcinomas (33,33%), NSCLC-NOS (11,59%), malig-
nant tumour (44,93%), benign tumour (2,90%), non-diagnostic 
(1,45%), and inadequate (5,80%). Average area of lesion section 
from which imprint was taken was significantly higher in lesions 
whose findings were characterized as adenocarcinoma, compared 
to the findings characterized as malignant (p=0,025). There wasn’t 
statistically significant difference in average area of lesions sec-
tion between the true positive and false negative IC findings of 
adenocarcinoma.
Conclusion: IC provides a reliable alternative to the traditional 
histological diagnosis in the intraoperative evaluation of lung ade-
nocarcinoma. The area of the section wasn’t significant factor in 
intraoperative diagnosis of adenocarcinoma by IC.

Pulmonary adenofibroma: a clinicopathological analysis of a 
case series
C.M. Vieru*, Y. Gómez Navarro, T. Labiano Miravalles, A. Panizo 
Santos, M. Garcia Martos
*Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Spain
Background & objectives: Pulmonary adenofibroma (AF) is an 
extremely rare benign tumour not yet described in the WHO classifica-
tion of lung neoplasms. It is frequently misdiagnosed as solitary fibrous 
tumour. Approximately 40 cases have been described.
Methods: We searched the pathology archives of two major univer-
sity Spanish hospitals for cases of pulmonary AF over a period of 
10 years (2012-2022). We retrospectively analysed clinical, radio-
logical, histopathological and immunophenotypic features.
Results: Our series included five cases middle aged (35-68 years) 
with male preponderance (4 male and 1 female). All cases were 
detected incidentally on radiology as a solitary well-defined lung 
lesion with a diameter ranging from 0,5 to 2,5 cm. Grossly they 
were whitish with a smooth surface. Histological examinations 
revealed biphasic tumours with epithelial component with gland-
like spaces lined by respiratory epithelium, surrounded by a stromal 
component with spindled-cell fibroblastic or myofibroblastic 
proliferation. There were not necrosis, atypia or signs of malignant 
transformation. Immunohistochemistry studies were performed and 
all were EMA and TTF1 positive in the epithelial component and 
actin positive in the stroma. STAT6 resulted negative in all cases.
Conclusion: Pulmonary adenofibroma is a rare benign pulmonary 
tumour whose morphological pattern could be mimic by various 
lung tumours. Breast and pulmonary AF show a significant over-
lap of their morphological characteristics. Biphasic morphology 
and immunohistochemistry are helpful to distinguish it from other 
potentially aggressive tumours like solitary fibrous tumour.

Use of insulinoma-associated protein 1 in small biopsy samples 
of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC)
S. Glumac*, M. Jovanovic, R. Janković, S. Popevic, M. 
Stjepanovic, B. Dozic
* Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Bel-
grade, Serbia
Background & objectives: Recent publications point out that insu-
linoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1), as nuclear marker, demonstrates 
superior performance to the individual and combined use of synapto-
physin (Syn), chromogranin A (ChA) and CD56 for diagnosing neu-
roendocrine tumours of lung.
Methods: Retrospectively reviewed small biopsy samples of pre-
viously diagnosed SCLC at the Institute for pathology, Medical 
Faculty, University of Belgrade. Immunohistochemistry was per-
formed using mouse monoclonal INSM1 antibody (Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology, Dallas; clone A-8). Positivity was assed as clear 
nuclear reactivity, and the intensity of immunoreactivity (1+, 2+, 
3+) combined with percentage of positive cells (0% to 100%).
Results: A total of 62 eligible cases in the period of 2019-2021 
were reviewed. An initial standard IHH panel, based on neuroendo-
crine morphology, for all cases included S, CD56, TTF-1 and Ki-67. 
Four cases (6.5%) were negative for S, focally or diffusely positive 
for CD56 in initial ICH panel, and negative for INSM1. Two cases 
(3.2%) were negative for all three markers. Another four cases were 
negative for S, but showed focal or diffuse CD56 positivity, and all 
were strongly positive for INSM1. The rest of cases (83.9%) were 
positive for all three markers; S and CD56 with variably immuno-
expression, while INSM1 showed strong immunoexpression.
Conclusion: Having in mind that in pulmonary pathology “tissue 
is issue”, and a need to preserve any tissue collected or further 
molecular testing, it is recommended to use as less as possible 
IHC markers to post accurate and precise pathologic classification 
possible. In our work, INSM1 showed good concordance related 
to immunoexpression of membranous markers. Thus, use of single 
IHC marker, which is nuclear and more specific than two membra-
nous markers, could save time and tissue for further testing as well.

(HER2)-altered non-small cell lung cancer
Y. Lee*, B. Lee, Y. Choi
*Department of Pathology and Translational Genomics, Samsung 
Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, 
Seoul, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Anti-ERBB2 therapies have been proven 
to be effective in ERBB2-altered cases of non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). The goal of this study is to demonstrate the clinicopatho-
logic and molecular features of ERBB2-altered NSCLC to enrich the 
potential candidates.
Methods: We found 66 cases of ERBB2-altered NSCLC including 
28 amplified [copy number (CN) ≥ 4] and 41 mutated cases from 
the next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of 969 NSCLC patients 
tested from 2018 to 2021. Their clinicopathologic data and tissue 
slides were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and silver 
in situ hybridization (SISH) were performed and assessed referring 
to the breast cancer guideline.
Results: SISH-confirmed ERBB2 amplification and oncogenic 
ERBB2 mutation were identified in 24 and 41 patients, respec-
tively. They were all in advanced stages (≥ III, AJCC, 8th). They 
mostly demonstrated adenocarcinoma with micropapillary pattern

and lung-to-lung metastasis. ERBB2 mutated cases with exon 20 
insertions showed heterogeneous immunoreactivity with mostly 
weak basal cytoplasmic and membranous patterns (0, 35%; 1+, 
40%; 2+, 25%). Two out of five point mutations displayed mod-
erate membranous staining (2+, 100%). Among the 19 ERBB2-
amplified cases with CN ≥ 7, 14 cases exhibited a strong complete 
circumferential pattern (3+). The remaining 5 cases displayed mod-
erate basolateral staining (2+) and were accompanied by actionable 
EGFR, KRAS, and ERBB2 exon 20 mutations.
Conclusion: ERBB2 amplification shows a high correlation with 
protein overexpression, being predicted by IHC. ERBB2 ampli-
fication can be accompanied by other actionable mutations with 
discordant ERBB2 protein expression. On the other hand, ERBB2 
mutations usually occur in a mutually exclusive manner with other 
driver mutations. They show heterogenous ERBB2 expression with 
negative to moderate cytoplasmic and membranous staining.

*Abderrahmen Mami Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) 
is an uncommon tumours, accounting 0.1 to 0,4 % of all lung cancers. 
It is a highly invasive tumour. The WHO distinguish 3 subgroups: 
pleomorphic carcinoma, carcinosarcoma and pulmonary blastoma. 
The aim: discuss clinicopathological characteristics and immunohis-
tochemical features of these tumours.
Methods: This retrospective study included all patients with a 
pathologically confirmed diagnosis of PSC treated at our depart-
ment of pathology between 2005 and 2021.
Results: There were 78 male and 11 female patients, aged 
between 6 and 82 years with a mean of 61. The diagnostic was 
made on surgical resection (n=56), on transparietal biopsy 
(n=27) and on a resection of metastatic location (n=10). An 
intraoperative frozen section was performed (n=36) showed 
inflammatory lesion (n=5) and non small cell carcinoma (n=31). 
The histological examination revealed pleomorphic carcinoma 
(n=66), Carcinosarcoma (n=9), pulmonary blastoma (n=5) and 
unclassified tumour (n=9). Immunohistochemically, the tumour 
cells were positive for vimentin (n=50), TTF-1 (n=19), EMA 
(n=14), cytokeratins (n=41). However, they were negative for 
muscle actin, PS100, actin, and calretinin.
Conclusion: The rarity PSC and the difficulty of pathological 
diagnosis make it a difficult malignancy to study. It pose a sig-
nificant challenge due to their rare occurrence, heterogeneous 
histology, and unclear histogenesis.

dade de Coimbra, Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, 
Portugal; 2 Institute of Anatomical and Molecular Pathology, 
Faculty of Medicine of the University of Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Gene fusion in NSCLC involving ALK, 
ROS1, and RET are demanded for benefit from targeted tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors. Detection and identification of fusion events might be com-
plex even with specific screening methods.
Methods: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has cur-
rently been used as a sensitive method for screening ALK, ROS1 
and RET fusions. RT-PCR specificity is recognized for target 
specific primers, of known fusions and exon skipping events. 
DNA/RNA NGS methods have evolved to detect fusions without 
previous information of gene partners and for diverse genetic 
events.
Results: Breakapart FISH with 5´/3´probes for screening ALK, 
ROS1 and RET rearrangements lack information regarding the 
gene partner fusion. Aberrant FISH patterns and false-positive 
results may be due to a possible non-functional oncogenic fusion. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is accurate for protein detection for 
ALK, but not for ROS1 and RET, due to poor specificity in the 
lung. RT-PCR as less sensitive method, only detects known gene 
partner fusions and unknown or new partners will be missed. 
DNA-NGS reads at specific base position breakpoints and can 
identify fusion variants, while RNA-NGS identifies known and 
unknown fusions at the transcript level.
Conclusion: FISH is a sensitive method for detecting breakapart 
rearrangements but also unspecific due to the lack of information 
regarding functional fusions. A validated method must be used 
to confirm aberrant cases. DNA-NGS has revealed many uncom-
mon ALK, ROS1 and RET fusions, events at genomic level not 
corresponding to fusion transcripts at the RNA level. Molecular 
Pathology Labs validated RNA-NGS level as necessary to detect 
rare fusion events, to determine which patients will benefit from 
actual targeted therapy.

*Institute of Anatomical and Molecular Pathology, Faculty of Medicine 
of the University of Coimbra; CIMAGO – Research Center for Environ-
ment, Genetics and Oncobiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of 
Coimbra; University Hospital Anatomical Pathology Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy is used for 
NSCLC treatment. Different clones, platforms and scoring methods can 
be used to evaluate PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker. We 
compared the performance of 22C3(LDT) and SP263(IVDR) assays, in 
a prospective non-interventional multicentric Portuguese study.
Methods: 391 lung cancers; 264 adenocarcinomas (ADC; 67.5%); 
98 squamous cell carcinomas (SqCC; 25.1%) and 29 other subtypes 
NSCLC (7.4%) were collected from 14 Portuguese centres. 22C3 
LDT and SP263 IVDR assays were performed on Ventana plat-
form. PD-L1 expression was determined by TPS(Tumour Propor-
tion Score). Cohen’s Kappa coefficients were calculated. Nominal 
variables were analysed using the chi-square test (statistical sig-
nificance p<0.05).
Results: No statistically significant differences were found 
between 22C3 and SP263 clones when considering the type of 
sample [biopsy (n=258, 66%) vs surgical specimen (n=133; 34%)] 
and the histological subtype. Biopsies demonstrated higher 22C3 
scores (TPS>=1 or >=50%) than surgical specimens (p=0.013; 
p=0.023) and also higher SP263 scores (TPS>=1 or >=50%) 
(p=0.014; p=0.009). The number of samples 22C3 PD-L1 <1% was 
significantly higher in ADC when compared to SqCC (p=0.032). 
Excellent Kappa agreement / concordance was observed for PD-L1

22C3 and SP263 clones in all defined cutoffs (K>0.8), taking into 
consideration the histologic and sample types.
Conclusion: Excellent concordance was observed comparing 22C3 
PD-L1 LDT and SP263 IVDR assays. SP263 assay seemed to be 
more consistent across histologic types. Validation, quality control, 
training, and experience are essential, especially in LDT, and may 
explain the high concordance observed. Considering the need of 
IVDR tests in the future, our work demonstrated an excellent con-
cordance between SP263 IVDR and 22C3 LDT assays, ensuring 
the reliability of the former when considering a switch.

Histopathologic patterns in brain metastases of lung adenocar-
cinoma: does it affect the survival?
L.D. Micoogullari, E. Cakir, I. Guzelis*, F. Cakalagaoglu, A. 
Kahraman
*Izmir Katip Celebi University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Primary lung adenocarcinoma is classified 
and graded according to histopathological patterns. The main goal of 
our study is to evaluate the prognostic impact of these patterns in surgi-
cally resected brain metastases of lung adenocarcinomas.
Methods: A retrospective review of patients with histopathologic 
diagnoses of brain metastatic lung adenocarcinoma between the 
years 2010-2022 was made. The presence and percentage of his-
topathological patterns including acinar, papillary, solid, micro-
papillary, cribriform, and complex glandular were noted. A total 
of 88 patients with brain metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma were 
included in the study. The mean age was 60.7±9.2 years.
Results: As ALK, ROS, and BRAF mutation was performed on 
31, 29, and 4 patients respectively, none of them were mutated. 
However, as EGFR mutation was evaluated in 31 patients, 
4(12.9%) of them were mutated. Predominant patterns of the 
tumours were; solid 49 (55.7%), papillary 13 (14.8%), cribri-
form 11 (12.5%), complex glandular 8 (9.1%), micropapillary 4 
(4.5%), acinar 3 (3.4%). Predominant patterns were not associ-
ated with overall survival in the long-rank test (p=0.87). The 
age of 55 was found as a cut-off associated with poor overall 
survival (p=0.029). TTF-1 positivity was found to be associ-
ated with better overall survival (p=0.008). Filigree pattern, a 
micropapillary subtype, was associated with EGFR mutation 
(p=0.05).
Conclusion: Future studies with larger series are needed to demon-
strate the prognostic significance of the histopathological patterns 
observed in brain metastases of lung adenocarcinomas.

Regional variability and prognostic value of tumour budding 
in pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma

S. Berezowska
*Institute of Pathology, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), 
Switzerland
Background & objectives: Grading pulmonary squamous cell carci-
noma (pSQCC) is controversial. Tumour budding (TB) is a prognostic 
biomarker in colorectal carcinoma, but its significance in pSQCC is 
unclear. We compared inter-region variability of TB and its prognostic 
value in pSQCC.
Methods: We retrospectively included 249 patients resected at 
the University Hospitals Bern (2000-2013) and Lausanne (2005-
2020) with available tissue from diagnostic biopsy and surgical 
specimen. TB was scored on H&E-stained slides according to the 
CRC consensus criteria at the tumour centre (TC), infiltration 
front (IF) and in the biopsy (B). Associations of TB with clinico-
pathological parameters and survival were assessed.
Results: TB was low (0-4 buds/0.785 mm2) in 128 (IF), 119 (TC) 
and 184 (B), intermediate (5-9 buds/0.785 mm2) in 68 (TC), 65 
(IF) and 34 (B) and high (≥10 buds/0.785 mm2) in 51 (TC), 65 
(IF) and 26 (B) cases.
Both the absolute number of buds and the TB score (1 to 3) 
were similar when comparing TC and IF (pbuds = 0.194, pscore 
= 0.383) but significantly different when comparing TC and B 
(pbuds < 0.001, pscore < 0.001).
Only TB scored at the IF showed prognostic potential regarding 
5-year overall survival (p = 0.045), which was mainly driven by 
a poorer survival of patients with high TB scores.
Conclusion: IF and TC were comparable but only TB assessed at 
the IF showed prognostic significance. Furthermore, TB assessed 
in biopsies was different from resections, limiting the use of bud-
ding as a preoperative prognostic marker.

implications of STAS (tumour spread through air spaces) in 
lung adenocarcinoma

*Department of Pathology, University Hospital La Paz, Madrid, 
Spain
Background & objectives: STAS is a recently described prognostic 
factor mostly studied in lung adenocarcinoma, although the concern it 
could represent a grossing artifact remains. This study aimed to assess 
the clinical implications of STAS in lung adenocarcinoma.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 118 cases of lung adenocar-
cinoma from 2015 to 2018 at La Paz University Hospital, Madrid 
(Spain). The distance from the edge of the tumour to the farthest 
STAS was measured and the cutoff for this distance was assessed 
by ROC curves. RFS and OS were compared considering presence 
of STAS and distance of STAS.
Results: STAS was found in 68,6% of adenocarcinomas. Patients 
with STAS had shorter median RFS (52,7 months) than patients 
without STAS (70,2 months) [p=0,028], showing a 2,29 times 
greater risk of recurrence (HR=2,29; p=0,03). Multivariant analy-
sis with histological grade 3 adenocarcinomas showed no statistical 
significance.
Two possible cutoffs of 1,5 or 2,5 mm from the edge of the tumour 
to STAS were established. RFS and OS were shorter when STAS 
was farther than 1,5mm (p=0,045 and p=0,05), with a 2,06 times 
greater risk of death (HR=2,06; p=0,05). Statistical significance 
was found only in OS for a 2,5mm cutoff (p=0,013) and risk of 
death was 2,39 greater (HR: 2,39; p=0,01).
Conclusion: STAS is a predictive factor of recurrence risk mostly 
associated with high-grade lung adenocarcinomas and should 
prompt pathologists its identification in surgical specimens of 
lung cancer. A cutoff of 1,5mm for assessing distance of STAS 
to the tumour margin could be acceptable. Further investigations 
are needed to validate these cutoffs and prognostic implications of 
STAS in other histological types of lung cancer.

Ayadi, F. El Mezni
*Abderrahmen Mami Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Mature mediastinal teratoma is a rare 
entity, accounting for approximately 8% of all tumours in this area. 
They are usually cystic benign tumours. The aim of this study was to 
describes the clinicopathological characteristics and discuss the dif-
ferential diagnosis of this disease.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 34 cases of 
mature mediastinal teratoma diagnosed at our department between 
1992 and 2020.
Results: There were 15 male and 19 female patients, aged between 
5 and 61 years with a mean of 30,87. All patients underwent a 
surgical resection. On gross examination, mean size of the masses 
was 9,5 cm. The outer surface was smooth and tan-white, and the 
cut inner surface contained multiple cystic structures filled with a 
tanbrown substance and a strands of hair. Microscopy showed vari-
able mature elements comprising of cysts lined by ciliated stratified 
epithelium and secretory epithelium, intestinal mucosa, sebaceous 
glands, smooth muscle, adipose tissue, abortive hair follicles, bone, 
cartilage, and pancreatic tissue. The cyst wall was fibrous with hya-
linised areas. There was no evidence of immature, neuroepithelial 
elements. Outside the cyst, thymic remnants was identified (n=16)
Conclusion: Mature mediastinal teratomas are rare tumours but 
should be considered in the differential diagnoses for mediastinal 
anterior lesion. Complete surgical resection is recommended in all 
mature teratomas with favourable survival rates.

*V.A. Almazov Research Center, Russia
Background & objectives: Coincidence of HIV and COVID-19 is 
high. In spite of clinical publications depicting the prevalence of HIV 
and its complications, many items related to formulation of postmortem 
diagnosis and aspects of histopathology of lesions related to different 
pathogens remain unclear.
Methods: We analysed all (148) autopsy cases where in clinical 
and/or pathological diagnosis were mentioned HIV and COVID-19 
in the period from March 2020 till September 2021.
Results: In the pathological diagnosis HIV was considered as main 
disease in 95 cases, COVID-19 - in 40 cases. In 9 cases other 
diseases were considered as main cause of death. In 4 cases new 
coronavirus infection was not included in pathological diagnosis. 
In majority of cases there were no difficulties in constructing the 
schema of tanatogenesis with the only exception when secondary 
infections in HIV were moderately expressed and lesions we con-
sidered as manifestation of coronavirus infection were prominent. 
Most problematic were cases in which was present the combination 
with secondary pneumocystosis. Taking in consideration that inter-
stitial lung fibrosis in both infections is similar special investiga-
tion including immunohistochemistry is necessary.
Conclusion: The rules of optimal formulation of pathological diag-
nosis has to be discussed internationally, because of influence upon 
lethal statistics. Many aspects of relations between pathogens in 
the mixed infection needs further study.

Clinical and pathological data analysis in 73 deceased patients 
with previous SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia during con-
valescence period
L. Mikhaleva*, A. Kontorshchikov, V. Olesya, K. Maslenkina
*A.P. Avtsyn Research Institute of Human Morphology, Russia
Background & objectives: It is still not clear whether new corona-
virus infection (COVID-19) has a long-lasting impact and can cause 
delayed sequela. The study aimed to analyse clinical and pathological 
data in patients who had previously had COVID-19 during early and 
late convalescence.
Methods: We analysed medical history data and pathology find-
ings of 73 deceased patients who survived COVID-19 and died 
from other causes in 2020-2021. The data included gender, age, 
data on previous coronavirus infection, disease duration, IgG and 
IgM antibody titers, CT scan results. We analysed initial and imme-
diate causes of death in deceased convalescents of a new coronavi-
rus infection were analysed.
Results: Twenty six men and 47 women, aged from 33 to 104 
years, were enrolled in the study. The antibody titer tests were 
performed at the time of hospital admission: the IgM level 
amounted from 0.31 to 1013.5 ОСЕ, IgG from 0.1 to 17.43 U/ml. 
The initial causes of death included circulatory system diseases in 
63 patients (86.3%), digestive system diseases in 18 cases (24.7%), 
respiratory system diseases in 5 patients (6.9%). The cerebral 
oedema was considered as the immediate cause of death in 31 
patients (42.5%), multiple organ failure in 13 cases (17.8%), heart 
failure in 13 patients (17.8%), endogenous intoxication in 6 patients 
(8.2%), other in 8 cases (13.7%).
Conclusion: The period from clinical recovery to lethal 
outcome ranged from 2 to 300 days: 40 patients (54,8%) died 
after 2-30 days (early convalescents) and 33 (45,2%) after 
31-300 days (late convalescents). Frequency of acute conditions 
of cardiovascular (acute myocardial infarction, bacterial 
endocarditis), respiratory (bacterial pneumonia) and cerebral 
(cerebral infarction, nontraumatic intracerebral haemorrhage) 
systems showed no difference in early and late convalescents 
(37,5% vs 33,3%, respectively, Ficher’s exact test: p > 0.05). 
Chronic disease progression prevailed in both subgroups of 
patients.

Institute of Legal Medicine Iasi, Romania
Background & objectives: Splenic metastases are relatively rare in 
forensics. The aim of our study was to highlight the features of splenic 
metastases from our files, in the context of widespread metastatic dis-
ease in autopsy, using immunohistochemistry pattern to identify their 
origin.
Methods: Necroptic examination and collection of specimens 
from six selected cases (37- 81 years old; equal distribution 
among genders), have been performed. Routine staining, along 
with a panel of immunohistochemical markers (Cytokeratin AE1/
AE3, CK5, CK7, CK20, CDX2, CD38, CD138, EMA, Cyclin D1, 
p53, p63, TTF-1, PSA, CEA, Synaptophysin, Chromogranin, and 
S100) have been used to to discriminate between different possible 
primaries.
Results: The gross findings were that of multiple tumours 
with areas of necrosis. The microscopic examination of 
S154

tumour cells showed variable morphology and the differentials 
included primaries in: lung, pancreas, colorectum, stomach, 
prostate, cervix, added to multiple myeloma, which has been 
clinically suspicioned in one case. The immunoexpression 
of tumour cells corroborated with gross findings and routine 
histology features certified the diagnoses, with primaries in 
lung, colon, pancreas, cervix, and prostate, associated with 
splenic metastases, along with lymph nodes, liver, lung, 
meninges, and/or brain secondaries. Although the primary 
tumour remained unknown in one case, the morphology and 
immunohistochemical pattern certified the diagnosis of poorly 
differentiated carcinoma, excluding the multiple myeloma 
suspicion.
Conclusion: Our cases certify that the most common sources 
of splenic metastases are lung, colon, along with pancreas, and 
reproductive tract, in cases of multivisceral cancers, while other 
primaries, such as breast carcinomas and malignant melanoma 
are reported in literature. Immunohistochemistry is useful to 
distinguish primaries from secondaries in cases with multiple 
disseminations, including spleen. However, the primaries are 
difficult to establish in occult poorly differentiated carcinomas/ 
cancer from unknown primary site, without any gross feature 
favouring a certain primary location.

*"Grigore T. Popa" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Iasi and 
Institute of Legal Medicine Iasi, Romania
Background & objectives: The lung microscopic features of SARS-
CoV-2 infection include diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), atypical pneu-
monia, microthrombi, its unfavourable evolution being correlated to 
multiple risk factors. The aim of our study is the presentation of the 
pathological spectrum registered in our files.
Methods: The reports from autopsies performed in the last two 
years in our Department have been reviewed, selecting 343 cases 
of lung COVID-19 disease, with cases age range between 5 to 99 
years old (81.34% males vs. 18.66% females). The cases have been 
investigated by routine paraffin-embedding sections, followed by 
hematoxylin and eosin staining, along with histochemical stains 
in selected cases.
Results: Grossly, pulmonary changes were variable, from 
pulmonary oedema to lung consolidation, haemorrhagic areas, 
and pulmonary thrombosis or microthrombi. The microscopic 
exam showed severe capillary congestion ± hyaline membranes, 
alveolar haemorrhage corresponding to exudative DAD, reactive 
pneumocytes changes and syncytial cells, microthrombosis, 
interstitial and intra-alveolar fibroblastic proliferation. Foci of 
pneumonia, as superimposed secondary infection, have been 
observed (37.02% of cases). In a decreased order of frequency, 
different chronic comorbidities have been registered: ischemic 
coronary disease, benign nephroangiosclerosis, liver steatosis 
± chronic hepatitis/ cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic 
pyelonephritis, and emphysema, along with rare diseases, such 
as lung tuberculosis, gastric carcinoma, Down syndrome, liver 
hydatid cyst, atherosclerotic aortic dissection, stroke, and traumatic 
injuries.
Conclusion: Pathologists have an important role in the diagnosis 
and management of COVID-19 infections, with a magnitude of 
506 million confirmed cases, resulting in over 6.2 million deaths 
worldwide, in April 2022. This study provides an overview of the 
post-mortem lung lesional spectrum in patients with COVID-19 
lesions and the risk factors that may contribute to their fatal out-
come. Our findings can also provide valuable data for COVID-19 
disease management perspectives, according to the assessment of 
categories of patients’ risk factors.

Morphological peculiarities of liver in patients died of Corona-
virus disease: a series of autopsy reports

*Kharkiv National Medical University, Ukraine
Background & objectives: Coronavirus infection (COVID-19) caused 
by SARS-CoV-2 remains a global pandemic problem today. In respect 
that Coronavirus disease frequently accompanied with a high ami-
notransferase rate in some patients, the detection of the pathological 
effect of coronavirus on liver becomes especially relevant.
Methods: We described 25 liver section from patients who died 
of disease related to COVID-19 at the Kharkiv Regional Clinical 
Infectious Diseases Hospital. Coronavirus disease was detected 
with PCR isolation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal 
lavage. All liver sections were taken from representative appearing 
areas, formalin fixed, paraffin embedded, stained with Hematoxy-
lin and Eosin and analysed under light microscopy.
Results: In our study 72 % of patients had elevated serum levels 
of aminotransferases. We identify local disorder of hepatic lobules 
with huge amounts of apoptotic hepatocytes and areas of necrosis 
in the central part of hepatic lobules. The majority of portal tracts 
showed a mixed inflammatory infiltrate consisted of lymphocytes, 
macrophages and plasma cells. The central veins and centrilobular 
sinusoids were full-blooded with lymphocytic infiltration in 
the endothelium. Sings of macrovesicular fatty degeneration 
with accumulation a huge amount of lipids were detected in the 
hepatocytes. Eosinophilic inclusions in the cytoplasm and nuclear 
pyknosis of the cholangiocytes were found in the interlobular bile 
ducts as a sing of apoptosis.
Conclusion: Detected changes in the liver of patients with 
COVID-19 are regarded as an acute reactive interstitial hepa-
titis on the diffuse steatosis background with severe bile ducts 
damage. Histological changes in sinusoidal and central veins 
endothelial cells may be related with a direct cytopathic viral 
influence. The mechanism of liver injury from SARS-CoV-2 
which includes both inflammatory response and a direct cyto-
toxic damage requires further study.

Background & objectives: Cancers of unknown primary (CUP) are 
metastatic tumours without an identified primary lesion. Paraneoplastic 
syndromes (PNs) occur independently of the physical presence of the 
tumour. In our study, we aimed to assess the characteristics of PNs in 
patients with CUP.
Methods: We examined 12837 autopsy cases between 1993 and 
2019 in the electronic register of the II. Pathology Department 
of Semmelweis University, Budapest. Out of 3691 cancer cases 
we found 135 CUPs, The PNs of this cohort were compared 
to the clinicopathological features of the tumours. For further

assessment, PNs were classified based on their clinical character-
istics (hematologic, myopathic/neuropsychiatric and endocrine/
metabolic).
Results: PNs were present in 33,3% of CUP cases. Most of these 
PNs were hematologic symptoms (62,2%), followed by endocrine 
or metabolic diseases (26,7%). Myopathic and neuropsychiat-
ric PNs were found only in a small fraction of cases (11,1%). 
Based on histological classification, PNs occur most frequently 
alongside anaplastic or neuroendocrine carcinomas (50-50%), 
whereas in adenocarcinomas (which is the most common cancer 
type histologically) the occurence of PNs were lower (27,3%).
Conclusion: To our current knowledge, the PNs associated with 
CUPs has not been studied comprehensively. PNs occur in a third 
of CUP cases, which is significantly more frequent than the gen-
eral estimation of PN occurence in cancers, which is 10-15%. 
The former support the data suggesting CUP is a clinical and 
biological entity amongst malignant tumours.

Background & objectives: Morphological and functional changes 
appearing in all tissues with ageing affect also all vascular structures, 
including aorta. The authors assessed the densities-D of aortic wall 
main components (Elastic fibres–FE, Collagen fibres-FCOL, smooth 
muscle fibres-FM) with ageing in both sexes.
Methods: Four aortic rings (base, cross, thoracic, abdominal) 
were taken during autopsies from 90 autopsied cases (55 men 
and 35 women). Samples were processed using the classical HP 
technique and stained with Orcein, and Goldner’s trichrome. 
Quantitative measurements were made using custom-made soft-
ware, developed in Matlab (Mathworks, USA) on virtual slides. 
Average values were compared with “t” test and Pearson’s test.
Results: FE-D and FM-D had an obvious descending trend with 
age in all main aortic regions and in both sexes with no signifi-
cant differences between sex descending patterns.
FCOL-D, in turn, had an obvious ascending trend with age in all 
main aortic regions and in both sexes with no significant differ-
ences between sex descending patterns.
All three types of fibres had no significant variation along the 
aortic length in any of the four main periods of live. FE-Ds and 
FM-Ds were higher in men than in women in all aortic regions 
excepting cross region while FCOL-Ds were higher in women 
than in men in all aortic regions excepting cross region.
Conclusion: Ageing brings a remodelling process of aortic wall 
main components densities (FE-D, FCOL-D and FM-D) similar 
in both sexes. There were no significant changes of densities val-
ues along the aortic length in all main age periods but there were 
differences between sexes in each type of fiber density along the 
aortic length.

*1 Histology and Pathological Anatomy, Faculty of Life Sciences 
of the University of Madeira; 2 LANA - Clinical Analysis and 
Pathological Anatomy Laboratory, Portugal
Background & objectives: In some countries, Sudden death (SD) 
of persons aged 1 to 40 years-old require further characterization, in 
order to provide Health Preventive Measures. The authors aim to study 
the SD causes of young adult victims in an European Country region.
Methods: Cases from the Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences 
National Institute’s database concerning unexpected sudden death 
young adults (1-40 years-old) victims, who underwent autopsy, 
between 2012-2016, at a region comprising 6 mainland and insular 
districts, were retrospectively reviewed. The Institute Ethics 
Committee approved this study. Demographic, clinical, autoptic, 
anatomopathological and toxicological data was collected. 
Statistical analysis (Stata 13.0 software) was performed.
Results: 175 SD, out of 2101 deaths in ages 1 to 40, were identi-
fied. SD victims had a mean age of 32±9 years-old, the majority 
males (69%,n=120). 115 (66%) SD cases were of cardiovascular 
origin. The remaining causes were respiratory (18%), cerebral 
(7%), digestive (6%), endocrinologic (2%), urinary (1%), infec-
tious (1%). The most frequent cardiovascular cause was coronary 
atherosclerosis and its complications (n=40,35%); whose victims 
were older (31±8vs35±4,p<0.020), with a minimum age of 26 
years, preferentially males (85%vs61%,p=0.011). Hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy (HCM) was diagnosed in 3 (3%) victims; with 
genetic data available in 2, namely through the contribution of 
molecular autopsy. Six acute myocarditis’ cases were identified, in 
significantly younger patients (23±13vs33±7,p=0,011).
Conclusion: During a 5-year period, the cumulative incidence of 
sudden and unexpected death of persons aged 1 to 40 years-old, in 
the studied region, is very low (n=175). Cardiovascular causes are 
present in 66% of the cases. The most frequent cardiovascular cause 
is coronary atherosclerosis (35%). Cardiovascular causes vary with 
age and gender. Epidemiological and Genetic studies are relevant 
contributes to understand the underlying settings and origins of SD 
and consequently promote preventive measures, namely of Public 
Health, and screening programs.

Study of morphological patterns of acute cellular rejection 
(ACR) reactions in endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs)
M. Kupryte*, E.M.A. Gosselin, L. Poškienė
*Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Lithuania
Background & objectives: Study of ACR reactions in cardiac allograft 
can assist in determining tissue’s immunological injury, presenting 
accurate information on rejection, and organizing optimal transplanted-
heart patient’s management. Objective is to identify morphologic ACR 
patterns of transplanted-heart patients in 3 years of surveillance.
Methods: Transplanted-heart patients with routine surveillance 
EMBs in 2004 – 2020 were analysed by patient’s characteristics 
and ACR grade (International Society of Heart and Lung Trans-
plantation (ISHLT) nomenclature). Statistical descriptive analy-
sis and Z two-tailed test to assess rejection probability in general 
population for year 1, 2 and 3 after transplantation were performed. 
Statistical significance p<0.05. Approval by ethics committee (no. 
BEC-MF-280).
Results: 70% (n=138) Grade 0 EMBs, 27% (n=53) Grade 1 
EMBs, and 3% (n=6) Grade 2 EMBs were detected in 1st post-
transplantation year. There were 67% (n=32) Grade 0 EMBs, 
31% (n=15) Grade 1 EMBs, 2% (n=1) Grade 2 EMBs in 2nd 
post-transplantation year, and 54% (n=21) Grade 0 EMBs, 
43% (n=17) Grade 1 EMBs, 3% (n=1) Grade 2 EMBs in 3rd

post-transplantation year. Analysis of 1st year’s rejection prob-
ability resulted in 95% confidence interval (CI) of Grade 0 
– 52.9% through 79.1% compared to 2nd year of 95% CI [63.6%; 
76.4%] and 3rd year of 95% CI [45.9%; 61.7%] with decrease of 
Grade 0 EMBs in 3rd year.
Conclusion: Tendencies of no rejection or mild ACR in EMBs 
suggest that long-term surveillance is irreplaceable tool for 
effective clinical observation of probable progress of cardiac 
allograft’s injuries. These tendencies detected in study may 
strongly suggest that procedures of cardiac allograft’s pathology 
testing for transplanted-heart patients are properly prescribed 
for those patients who demonstrate features of rejection over the 
years, and 95% CI calculated in this research is a safe indicator 
that nowadays prescribed EMBs are effectively indicated in risk 
patients.

*Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital, Department 
of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: In this study, clinicopathological features 
and follow-up data of 80 primary cardiac tumours diagnosed between 
2011-2022 were evaluated.
Methods: The study was a retrospective review of 77 patients.
Results: Of the 77 cases (F/M: 49/28) included in the evaluation, 70 
(90.9%) were benign, and 7 (9.1%) were malignant. The mean age 
at surgery was 53 in benign, and 36 in malignant cases. 60 (86%) 
of the benign tumours were myxomas. Benign tumours other than 
myxoma consisted of 5 papillary fibroelastomas, 2 haemangiomas, 
1 lipoma, 1 hamartoma, 1 rhabdomyoma. Malignant tumours 
consisted of 2 spindle cell pleomorphic sarcoma, 2 embryonal 
rhabdomyosarcoma, 1 angiosarcoma, 1 synovial sarcoma, and 1 
myxofibrosarcoma. The follow-up period was 6-140 months in 
benign cases, 8-56 months in malignant cases. During this period 
only 5 of the malignant cases died. Mean survival in malignant 
cases was 21 months.
Conclusion: Surgical resection is the first treatment option for pri-
mary cardiac tumours. Histopathological diagnosis of the tumour 
plays a fundamental role in guiding further follow-up and treat-
ment. While it can be achieved nearly 100% survival with surgi-
cal resection in benign cases, the results are not satisfactory in 
malignant cases.

Stereological estimation of myocardial fat and its relation to 
obesity, epicardial and visceral adipose tissue
P. Holm*, L. Hindsø, K.B. Olsen, J. Banner
*Institute of Forensic Medicine, Denmark
Background & objectives: The normal heart includes epicardial 
adipose tissue (EAT) and myocardial fat – both increase with obesity. 
EAT is related to risk of heart disease and myocardial fat with 
arrhythmogenesis. The objectives is to estimate myocardial fat using 
stereological methods.
Methods: We included 115 deceased with a post-mortem com-
puted-tomography of the eviscerated heart to establish EAT vol-
ume. We examined six samples (ant., lat., and post.) from the left 
(LV) and right ventricle (RV) of the midventricular slice. The 
percentage of myocardial fat was estimated stereological using 
Visiopharm software. Kidney and omental fat were weighed at 
autopsy and waist-hip-ratio calculated.
Results: The group consisted of more males (66/49; 57%), mean 
age at death was 53.4 years (range 21-93) and mean BMI was 25.4 
(±5.6). Females had a slightly non-significant (p=0.054) larger 
proportion of RV fat (mean 12.1%, range 9.7-16.6) compared to 
men (10.8%, range 9.4-12.8). We found a positive correlation with 
BMI and LV fat (p=0.033). In the RV the correlation was only 
borderline significant (p=0.052). EAT volume was positively cor-
related with fat in the RV and LV. We found no association with 
waist-hip-ratio, omental or kidney fat as measures of visceral adi-
pose tissue (VAT).
Conclusion: Myocardial fat is a normal component especially in 
the RV and correlates with the total volume of EAT. We surpris-
ingly found no association with VAT.

SET7 methyltransferase mediates the up-regulation of NADPH 
oxidase expression and oxidative stress in the atherosclerotic 
aorta of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice
A. Manea*, M.L. Vlad, A. Lazar, S. Manea
*Institute of Cellular Biology and Pathology “Nicolae Simionescu” 
of the Romanian Academy, Romania
Background & objectives: Histone methylation-related epigenetic 
pathways emerged as promising therapeutic targets in atherosclerosis. 
The study aimed at investigating the functional implication of SET7 
in the regulation of NADPH oxidase (Nox) expression, an important 
source of oxidative stress in experimental atherosclerosis.
Methods: Human non-atherosclerotic and atherosclerotic tissue 
specimens, apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice, and polar-
ized pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) mouse 
macrophages (Mac) were investigated employing real-time PCR, 
Western blot, and microscopy. Male ApoE-/- mice fed a normal or 
a high-fat, cholesterol-rich diet (HD) were randomized to receive 
5 mg/kg (R)-PFI 2 hydrochloride, a selective SET7 inhibitor, or 
its vehicle for 4 weeks.
Results: Pharmacological inhibition of SET7 had no signifi-
cant effects on plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, and body 
weights as compared with vehicle-treated ApoE-/- (HD) animals. 
The mRNA and protein levels of SET7 were found significantly 
elevated in human atherosclerotic lesions, atherosclerotic aorta of 
ApoE-/- (HD) mice, and in M1-Mac. Inhibition of SET7 suppressed 
the up-regulation of Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4 subtypes in the aorta 
of ApoE-/- (HD) mice and in M1-Mac. Treatment of ApoE-/- (HD) 
mice with SET7 inhibitor reduced significantly the aortic forma-
tion of 4-hydroxynonenale-/nitrotyrosine-protein adducts (impor-
tant markers of oxidative stress). Significant increases in Nox1, 
Nox2, Nox4, Nox5, and p22phox transcript levels were detected in 
HEK293 reporter cells overexpressing SET7.
Conclusion: SET7 is a key epigenetic enzyme that methylates 
nucleosomal histones (H3) and non-histone proteins (transcrip-
tion factors) at different lysine residues to regulate the expression 
of the target genes. The novel data of this study indicate that SET7 
methyltransferase is up-regulated in human atherosclerosis and 
mediates NADPH oxidase up-regulation and oxidative stress in 
experimental atherosclerosis. Pharmacological targeting of SET7 
methyltransferase could become an important supportive therapeu-
tic strategy in atherosclerosis.

*George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sci-
ence, and Technology of Targu Mures, Department of Pathology, 
Romania
Background & objectives: Arteriovenous fistula (AFV) creation is the 
preferred access way for haemodialysis, but their functionality may be 
limited by pre-existing vascular pathology. In this study was analysed 
that the pre-existing vascular abnormalities represent a predictive value 
of AFV no maturation.
Methods: Patients for chronic kidney disease (n=44) undergo-
ing AFV placement were included in this study. The vein samples 
were processed for light microscopy, stained with H&E, trichrome, 
and von Kossa. The neovascularization and the chronic inflamma-
tory cell population were analysed using, CD3 and CD68. Inti-
mal hyperplasia and medial fibrosis were quantified using Image 
J analysis.
Results: 45.45% of 44 biopsies showed concentric intimal hyperplasia, 
with a 46.2 μm mean by morphometric analysis. Medial fibrosis 
and expansion interested 54.54% of vein samples with 147.75 μm 
mean thickness, characterized by conjunctive fibres accumulation. 
Neoangiogenesis in intima and media layers only in 6.8% of cases 
was found. In vein walls, calcification and mononuclear inflammatory 
cells were absent. A subset of 9 specimens obtained from surgical 
revision patients had substantial luminal narrowing due to irregular 
neointimal formation (87.27 μm), media thickening (177.34 μm), and 
neoangiogenesis in intima and media. Foci of microcalcification and 
luminal thrombus were detected in 5 of 9 cases.
Conclusion: In this study, we observed pre-existing abnormalities 
in both 9 cases, including neointimal hyperplasia disorganization 
of the venous wall and neovascularization of intima in veins used 
for AFV creation, that predispose these venous walls to maturation 
failure. The intima hyperplasia and neoangiogenesis in fistula with-
out maturation are accompanied by mild inflammatory infiltrate, 
predominantly in those with thrombosis and calcification.

Carvalho
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Primary heart tumours are rare, even in 
major cardiac surgery centres. We present a retrospective monocentric 
5-year case series of resected primary heart tumours at Coimbra Hos-
pital and University Centre.
Methods: All firstly diagnosed primary heart tumours surgically 
resected at our Institution from 2017 to 2021 were retrieved from 
hospital registries. From each case, we collected patient age and 
sex, histopathological diagnosis, and intracardiac tumoral location. 
Follow-up time varied from 5 to 98 months.
Results: We identified 34 tumours, 32 (94,1%) benign and 2 (5,9%) 
malignant.
Regarding the benign tumours, we reported 24 (75%) myxomas 
and 8 (25%) papillary fibroelastomas. As expected, the majority 
(91,7%) of myxomas arose on the left atrium and papillary fibroe-
lastomas on the valves. Twenty patients were female; the mean age 
was 62 years (range: 14-79).
During follow-up, one myxoma recurred after eight months and 
was re-excised. No patient had significant complications nor died 
of the disease.
The malignant tumours were an angiosarcoma and an EBV-positive 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the first with a fatal outcome after 
six months. The patient with lymphoma completed chemotherapy 
and is well after 11 months.
Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, we describe the first 
Portuguese series on primary heart tumours. We report 94,1% of 
benign tumours, a significantly higher value than the 75% usually 
described in the literature (t(33) = -4,67, p < 0,001). We hypoth-
esize that this difference is due to a higher incidental diagnosis of 
benign tumours, but further and more recent work is needed.
We also report a myxoma recurrence, a rarely described event, and 
two uncommon malignant heart tumours.

*”Carol Davila” University of Medici, Romania
Background & objectives: Cardiovascular-CV diseases are among the 
most common causes of death. The authors compared the densities-D 
of aortic wall main components (Elastic fibres–FE, Collagen fibres-
FCOL, smooth muscle fibres-FM) of people with CV and non-
cardiovascular-NCV diseases causing patients’ death.
Methods: Four aortic rings (base, cross, thoracic, abdominal) 
were taken during autopsies from 90 autopsied cases (62 NCV 
and 28 CV). Samples were processed using the classical HP tech-
nique and stained with Orcein, and Goldner’s trichrome. Quan-
titative measurements were made using custom-made software, 
developed in Matlab (Mathworks, USA) on virtual slides. Aver-
age values were compared with “t” test and Pearson’s test.
Results: FE-D and FCOL-D had a continuous descending trend in 
both CV and NCV groups in all main aortic regions. FE-D were 
higher in NCV group while FCOL-D were higher in CV group. In 
turn, FM-D had a general ascending but oscillating trend in both CV 
and NCV groups, more pronounced in the former.
FCOL-Ds had a pronounced inverse correlation with both FE-Ds 
and FM-Ds and in both groups (correlation matrices-CMs 
negative and Pearson’s test “p” values <0,0001). In turn, FE-D 
had a direct correlation with FM-D in both NCV and CV groups, 
more pronounced in the former (CMs positive and Pearson’s test 
“p” value 0.0384 vs 0.0729).
Conclusion: Our preliminary data show that the remodelling pro-
cess of the aortic wall components differs between patients with 
CV and NCV diseases both along the aortic length and in the cor-
relation pattern between the three aortic wall components (FE, 
FCOL and FM).

Background & objectives: Porous tantalum has been exten-
sively used in orthopaedic surgery, including uncemented total 
knee arthroplasty (TKA). We aimed to analyse possible causes 
for unexpected medial tibia bone loss resulting in porous tanta-
lum tibia component fracture necessitating early revision after 
primary TKA.
Methods: Retrieved tissue samples collected at revision surgery under-
neath the tibial baseplate were histologically analysed and scanned 
with 3 MeV focused proton beam for Proton-Induced X-ray Emission 
(micro-PIXE) elemental analysis. Fractographic and microstructural 
analysis were performed by stereomicroscopy. A full 3D finite-element 
model was made for numerical analysis of stress-strain conditions of 
the tibial baseplate.
Results: The 65-year old patient was revised 44 months after 
primary TKA because of suddenly increased pain. His right knee 
radiographs depicted fracture and displacement of the tibial base-
plate. Histological examination of tissue underneath the broken 
medial part of the tibial baseplate revealed dark stained metal 
debris, which was confirmed by micro-PIXE to consist of Tan-
talum and Titanium. Fractographic analysis and tensile testing 
showed that the failure of the tibial baseplate fulfilled the crite-
ria of a typical fatigue fracture. Microstructural analysis of the 
contact surface revealed signs of bone ingrowth in 22.5% of the 
surface only and was even less pronounced in the medial half of 
the tibial baseplate.
Conclusion: This case details the second known report of failure 
of a modern cementless modular, trabecular metal (Porous Tan-
talum™) tibial baseplate in a TKA. Further studies are needed to 
confirm the responsibility of metal debris for an increased bone 
absorption leading to catastrophic tibial baseplate failure.

Characterisation of primary cilium by an ultrastructural study 
in actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma
A. Sanz Zorrilla*, F. Leiva-Cepas, M.J. Gálvez Medina, R. Ortega 
Salas, I. Cantarero Carmona
*Reina Sofía University Hospital in Córdoba, Spain
Background & objectives: The primary cilium (PC) is an organelle 
that plays an essential role in cellular signalling, its aberrant activa-
tion is related to an uncontrolled cell division. By an ultrastructural 
study, we characterised it in relation to squamous cell carcinoma and 
actinic-keratosis.
Methods: The samples were obtained by a dermatologist, consist-
ing of human skin with suspicion of actinic-keratosis (AK) and/
or squamous-cell-carcinoma (SCC). Half of the biopsy was used 
for diagnosis and the other half for ultrastructural study. The other 
hemisection was fixed in glutaraldehyde, and then stored in PBS. 
The sample sections were cut by an ultramicrotome and examined 
under electron microscope (EM).
Results: From each sample, we got a hematoxylin and eosin 
(H&E) histological slice and immunohistochemistry: CD31, 
beta-eosin and immunohistochemistry: CD31, beta- catenin, ki67, 
vimentin, PTEN, catenin, ki67, vimentin, PTEN, e--cadherin, 
p63 cadherin, p63 and p53. As for EM, we collected almost 20 
images of each sample. We observed a decrease of the cells which 
expressed the PC in SCC and a gradual loss of AK in their differ-
ent grades of dysplasia.
Conclusion: We have shown that PC participates in the malignancy 
process of AK up to SCC. The decreased expression of the PC 
appears to be directly proportional to the AK grade, which could 
help to predict the progression to SCC.

*1 Histology and Pathological Anatomy, Faculty of Life Sciences 
of the University of Madeira; 2 LANA - Clinical Analysis and 
Pathological Anatomy Laboratory, Portugal
Background & objectives: Islands, in their natural isolation, are pro-
tected from nefarious external influences. Yet, when people and goods 
movements occur, danger of infectious diseases increases. The authors 
aim to study epidemics’ outbursts throughout History in an Atlantic 
Archipelago from the XV century.
Methods: A retrospective search for information on infectious 
diseases / epidemics was performed through Historical, Medical, 
Literary, Journalistic and Photographic archives and databases of 
various Institutions of the Archipelago. An analysis of the data, 
according to the current infectious pathology knowledge, was done.
Results: From the XVth to the XXIst centuries, 9 epidemics’ out-
breaks occurred and were officially reported at the Archipelago. 
They were: 1521-1538 – Plague, 1751 – Measles, 1815 – Smallpox, 
1856 – Cholera, 1873 – Smallpox, 1905/6 – Bubonic Plague, 1910-
1911 – Cholera, 1919-1920 – Pneumonic (Spanish) Influenza, 
2020-… – Covid-19. Popular, medical, institutional, governmen-
tal and religious interventions tried to overcome each catastrophe; 
yet, they led to thousands or millions of deaths, sequelae in the 
survivors and unspeakable suffering.
Conclusion: In a period of seven centuries, 9 major epidemics 
happened. In an Archipelago where tourism and trade exchanges have 
been relevant throughout the centuries, the occurrence of epidemics’ 
outbursts are explained. Yet, it is important to understand the socio-
economic and medico-sanitary contexts of each outbreak, which may 
provide data and knowledge to be used / adapted to new – present or 
future – epidemics, both as preventive and curative measures.

*1 Histology and Pathological Anatomy, Faculty of Life Sciences 
of the University of Madeira; 2 LANA - Clinical Analysis and 
Pathological Anatomy Laboratory, Portugal
Background & objectives: In pandemic times, science looks 
back to History trying to learn lessons from the past. Smallpox 
was among major historical epidemics and was an example in 
vaccination history. The authors aim to present Variole skin lesions 
to young medical generations.
Methods: To attain the objective, a search was performed in the 
collection of the Anatomical Pathology Museum – Medical Fac-
ulty, Coimbra University. It is a museum from the XIXth century, 
UNESCO’s World Heritage since 2013, that houses thousands of 
objects of various natures [from books, photographs, scientific 
equipment, anatomo-pathological specimens in glass containers 
with fixative liquid, to artificial (clay, wax) models].
Results: Among the 161 wax models of skin pathology in the 
Museum, 2 expose Smallpox (Variole) cutaneous lesions. Dat-
ing from the XIXth century, acquired in Paris, handcrafted by the 
French modeler Vasseur, they correspond to human arms with 
umbilicated vesico-pustular papules. These wax models are three-
dimensions representations and present not only anatomic but also 
pathological accuracy; since they were executed facing the real 
victims or copied from an original model.

Conclusion: Historical skin wax models from Anatomical-Pathol-
ogy Museums are priceless and unique tools to teach young medi-
cal generations, especially in eradicated diseases, as Smallpox. 
Knowing how to recognize this entity is of major importance, since 
the world may unexpectedly face new epidemic waves, in various 
contexts, namely that of bioterrorism.

Background & objectives: Our group has recently determined that 
CD15, C9, C5b-9 and Fibronectin immunohistochemistry can be help-
ful in Myocardial Infarction (MI) dating. This study aimed to verify 
antigen preservation for MI diagnosis dating after formalin-fixed par-
affin-embedded (FFPE) myocardium stored over 30 years.
Methods: We selected 19 FFPE MIs diagnosed in autopsies 
between 1970s-1980s from IAP-PM archives. Neutrophils absence/
presence was used for dating early/old MI <3days>. IHC panel 
discriminated between MI/non-MI cardiac tissue, namely CD15, 
C9, C5b-9 and Fibronectin. Two Pathologists calculated global 
expression to be compared with global expressions in 24 recent 
(2017-INMLCF) diagnosed MIs cases, using non-parametric 
Mann-Whitney test SPSS v27.
Results: Samples reinclusion in new paraffin molding for 
new microtomes sectioning was performed and 3μm sections 
were submitted to IHC panel according with manufacturer 
recommendations for each antibody in BondMax platform. After 
considering global expression (intensity of expression x percentage 
of positive myocytes) of CD15 (U=202,500; p=0,531; N=43), 
C9 (U=214,500; p=0,739; N=43) and Fibronectin (U=147,000; 
p=0,077; N=43) no statistically significant differences were 
recognized between archival and recent MIs; C5b9 expression 
was significantly lower in MIs archived tissue over 40 years 
(U=138,000; p=0,027; N=43). Fibronectin expression was higher 
in infarcted tissue in all cases, when compared with normal 
myocytes.
Conclusion: Our study highlighted performance of immunohis-
tochemistry in archived MI paraffin blocks. It demonstrated that 
CD15, C9 and Fibronectin can be applied to FFPE archived sam-
ples over more than 40 years, enabling and supporting future stud-
ies on this material source. Dating MIs was the main goal and 
fibronectin revealed to be a robust biomarker either for distinguish-
ing between ischemic necrosis and normal myocardium as well as 
tissue preservation standard biomarker.

COVID-19 pathology in cases of co-morbidity with malignant 
tumours
O. Reshetnikova*, S. Korenev, A. Ermakov, L. Rudiuk, S. Morozov
*Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, Russia
Background & objectives: COVID-19 infection cases with 
malignant neoplasms as co-morbidities are associated with 
increased risk of severe disease’ course and higher mortality. The 
aim of present study was to reveal organs’ pathologies induced 
by COVID-19 infection in patients with various cancers accom-
panying illnesses.
Methods: Autopsy examinations were performed in fifteen lethal 
cases of COVID-19 infection with malignant tumours co-mor-
bidities. Clinical and laboratory tests data were recorded and 
analysed. Gross pathologies of lungs, other internal organs and 
brain were examined. Tissue samples were taken for histology. 
Malignancy diagnosis was confirmed in all cases by the onco-
pathologist’s second opinion. Microscopy of H&E stained slides 
performed at x10,x20,x40.
Results: Results have shown that six patients had concomitant 
haematological malignancies and nine ones suffered from car-
cinomas of different localizations. In two cases the causes of 
deaths were a result of the tumour’s growth progression. Present 
study revealed multi-organ injuries in all cases, but the major-
ity of patients had the most striking lungs pathology. Severe 
diffuse alveolar damage was diagnosed in thirteen cases with 
superimposed bacterial bronchopneumonia in two patients. His-
tologically alveolar epithelial cells dystrophy and necrosis with 
parallel hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, hyaline membrane 
formation, inflammatory infiltration with fibrin plugs in some 
airspaces were evident. Blood circulation disturbances were 
found in all autopsies of present study.
Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global health 
crisis with the significant growth of morbidity and mortality. 
Concomitant malignancies contributed to organ’s insufficiency 
and fatal outcomes. Effective clinical management must be 
based on the fundamental knowledge of the pathogenesis and 
pathology of infection combined with neoplastic growth. Post-
mortem examination is an essential tool in understanding the 
damages due to this novel infection. Further investigations of 
the underlying neoplastic diseases’ role in lethal outcomes of the 
COVID-19 are considered essential.

*Erasmus Medical Center, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: COVID-19 lung tissue shares simi-
lar histomorphological features with chronic lung allograft dis-
ease, suggesting activation of auto-immune related pathways 
in COVID-19. Therefore, we analysed the mRNA expression 
of auto-immune-related genes in post-mortem lung tissue from 
COVID-19 patients.
Methods: Formalin-fixated, paraffin-embedded post-mortem 
lung tissue samples of COVID-19 patients were used for tar-
geted gene expression profiling using the autoimmune panel of 
NanoString technology. To validate the results, multiplex immu-
nofluorescence for tryptase and chymase was applied. Lung tis-
sue samples from influenza patients were used as a control group.
Results: Immune infiltration was broadly similar between 
COVID-19 and influenza patients. Upregulation of genes related 
to mast cells (TPSAB1/TPSAB2, CPA3, and HDC) was identi-
fied in COVID-19. This finding was strengthened by multiplex

immunofluorescence showing a significant increase of tryptase- 
and chymase positive cells in COVID-19 as well. Furthermore, 
AGER (receptor for advanced glycation end-products) and PPBP 
(pro-platelet basic protein) were upregulated in COVID-19 com-
pared to influenza. IFIH1, IFI44L, IFIT1, and RSAD2, genes 
related to type I interferon signalling, showed a significant cor-
relation to detected SARS-CoV2 pathway-related genes. A com-
parison of groups based presence of histomorphological features 
indicative of ARDS did not show upregulation of any specific gene 
or pathways.
Conclusion: Through two separate ways of measurement, 
we show an increase of mast cells in lungs affected by severe 
COVID-19 compared to influenza. Additionally, several genes 
involved in fibrosis and thrombosis, among which are AGER 
and PPBP, are upregulated in COVID-19. Future studies should 
focus on detecting these markers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 
to predict the severity and course of the disease.

Expression of LAMP2A, LC3B, and HSP70 autophagy bio-
markers in different brain structures during aging

Sukhorukov
*National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynaecology 
and Perinatology named after Academician V.I.Kulakov, Russia
Background & objectives: Macroautophagy and chaperon-mediated 
autophagy play a pivotal role in misfolded proteins removal in neurons, 
whilst their impairment contributes to aging and age-related diseases. 
We aimed to evaluate biomarkers of abovementioned processes in neu-
rons localized in different brain zones during aging.
Methods: Heat shock protein 70, LAMP2A, and LC3B immuno-
histochemical staining was performed for FFPE samples of human 
prefrontal cortex (pyramidal layer), hippocampus, and basal 
ganglia. Two age groups were studied: young (n=5) and elderly 
(n=10),whose causes of death were not associated with neuro-
logical diseases. The optical density was measured in neuronal 
perikaryon. Statistical significance was analysed using Kruskal 
Wallis test.
Results: From the obtained data, it is apparent that in studied 
groups there was significant difference between macroautophagy 
(LC3B), chaperon-mediated autophagy (HSP70), as well as 
lysosome receptor (LAMP2A) biomarkers expression in neuronal 
perikaryon of large neurons (p<0.05). Statistical test revealed 
increased levels of these autophagy-lysosome pathway proteins in 
elderly studied groups than in young one. Interestingly, the level 
of HSP70 in elderly samples was 2-fold higher in comparison 
with samples obtained from young group. The rates for LC3B and 
LAMP2A for elderly group were approximately 1.25 times higher 
than young group, but optical density in each brain zones were not 
found to differ.
Conclusion: Our demonstration that Heat shock protein 70 expres-
sion was significantly increased in elderly samples could indicates 
its potential role in adaptive mechanisms occurring in aging neu-
rons during chronic oxidative stress and inflammation. Exacerbated 
levels of all autophagy biomarkers in elderly samples as to young 
one points out that autophagy seems to support proteostasis in neu-
rons during physiological aging. These findings, while preliminary, 
suggest that both autophagy-lysosome pathways could contribute 
to neuronal maintenance during aging.

Prognosis and outcome of patients with haemangioblastoma 
based on histopathological features: experience of a tertiary 
centre
F. Leiva-Cepas, J. Osuna Soto*, M.J. Gálvez Medina, I. Sánchez 
Ramírez, R. Ortega Salas
*Reina Sofía University Hospital in Córdoba, Spain
Background & objectives: Haemangioblastoma is a highly vascular 
tumour of the central nervous system with clear neoplastic stromal 
cells, classified as WHO Grade I. The aim of the present study is to 
investigate the clinical manifestations, histopathological features and 
prognosis of this entity.
Methods: The characteristics of 25 patients diagnosed of haeman-
gioblastoma were analysed, and a retrospective review of heman-
gioblastoma of the central nervous system reported in the literature 
was performed.
Results: 12 patients were female and 13 were men, aged from 9 to 
77 years (55 years on average). All cases were wild-type sporadic, 
except for one associated to Von Hippel Lindau Syndrome. 15 cases 
were located on cerebellum, 9 on the brain and one on spinal cord. 
Microscopically, the morphology and immunophenotype of tumoral 
cells were not different from those mentioned in the literature. 3 
patients died during the follow-up period and 4 patients suffered a 
recurrence of the disease.
Conclusion: Overall prognosis was relatively good, so the 
presence of tumoral recurrence or malignant transformation 
was unusual. The most common presentation is a sporadic 
tumour located on cerebellum. From an histological point of 
view, only the presence of atypical mitoses correlated with 
progression of the disease. Cerebral haemangioblastoma often 
simulates the imaging characteristics of meningioma or gli-
oma. Enough attention should be paid to differential diagnosis 
before the operation, and exact diagnosis relies on the patho-
logical examination.

A. Otero, J. Ortiz, M.D. Ludeña, M.D. Tabernero
*Hospital Universitario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: Rhabdoid meningiomas (RM) are 
WHO grade 3 brain tumours, with high rates of local recurrence 
and heterogeneous mortality. Our aim is to analyse the clinical and 
pathological characteristics and to establish a possible correlation with 
the aggressive clinical course.
Methods: We have reviewed the histological, clinical and progno-
sis characteristics of patients with MR from 17 Pathology Depart-
ments and 4 biobanks of Spain. We also review the mitotic index, 
immunohistochemistry and diagnosis. In cases with aggressive 
behaviour or successive relapse, we consider to combine a genetic 
profile through high-density arrays looking for specific genetic 
abnormalities (loss and gain of chromosomal regions).
Results: From 24 patients only 17 met histological criteria 
for MR. The age range was 34 to 83 years(10 men, 7 women). 
In the follow up, we observed 5 RMs with aggressive behav-
iour, multiple episodes of recurrences and death of the patients 
(5/17, 3 deceased without recurrences). The sequential analysis 
of the evolution and genetic changes included tumours at diag-
nosis and relapse samples. In 2/5 tumours, the genetic pattern 
at relapse remains identical to that at diagnosis and in the other

3/5, we observed acquisition of new chromosomal abnormali-
ties. 1 to 19 chromosomes were affected, in varying numbers 
of chromosomes with an average of 5 to 11 chromosomes per 
tumour altered.
Conclusion: Until now, evidence of rabdoid morphology qualify 
for a correct diagnosis alone of MR, nevertheless misdiagnosis can 
be present specially when rabdoid cells are scatter and no other 
atypical histological characteristic is present. We have established 
2 profiles of chromosomal alterations (one with chromosomal 
losses and one with losses combined with gains of several genetic 
regions).The most frequent alteration it was the loss of one chro-
mosome 22 (monosomy). Genomic sequencing could help to the 
graduation of these tumours.

wara, R. Kallel
*Department of Pathology, Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, 
Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Meningiomas present a broad morphologi-
cal spectrum. Grade 2 meningiomas (G2M) are aggressive tumours 
associated with a high recurrence rate. In this study, we aimed to evalu-
ate the epidemiological and histopathological features of G2M in our 
department.
Methods: This retrospective study included 30 cases of G2M 
diagnosed during 5 years (January 2012-December 2017) at our 
department. A review of the slides was performed and the menin-
giomas were reclassified according to the fifth edition of the WHO 
Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System (WHO 
CNS5) published in 2021
Results: Our study included 12 men and 18 women (Sex 
ratio=0.66). The mean age was 56.2 years. The most common 
symptom was an intra-cranial hypertension. The main localization 
was the supra-tentorial region (93%). Neurosurgical resection was 
performed in all cases. Gross-total resection was achieved in 16 
cases (53.3%). Histopathologic examination concluded to an atypi-
cal meningioma (AM) in 28 cases (93.4%), a clear cell meningioma 
(CCM) in one case (3.3%) and a rhabdoid meningioma (RM) in one 
case (3.3%). Ki67 proliferation index was determined in 12 cases. 
The value varies between 2 and 20%. Recurrence was noted in 6 
cases (20%). The progression-free survival and overall survival 
were 73.3% and 86.7% respectively.
Conclusion: It is now emphasized that the criteria defining atypi-
cal or anaplastic (ie, grade 2 and 3) meningioma should be applied 
regardless of the underlying subtype. As in prior classifications, 
chordoid and CCM are noted to have a higher likelihood of recur-
rence than the average WHO grade 1 meningioma and have hence 
been assigned to WHO grade 2. G2M exhibit a high tendency to 
relapse with up to 29-52% recurring. The recurrence rate in our 
study was 20%.

T. Boudawara, M. Manai
*Department of Pathology, Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, 
Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: There are several reports regarding the 
epidemiology of brain tumours. However, little is known about the 
profile of primary cerebellar tumours (PCT). We report the results of 
a retrospective study of PCT in an institution of the south of Tunisia.
Methods: We included in our study all cases of PCT diagnosed 
at our department during 11 years (January 201-December 2020). 
The tumours were classified according to the fourth edition of the 
WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System 
(WHO CNS) published in 2016.
Results: Forty-six cases of PCT were included. The average age 
was 19 years (1-74 years). 45.6% of patients were under 18 years 
old and 54.4% were over 18 years old. Tumours were located in 
cerebellar hemisphere in 21 cases (70%), in the vermis in 6 cases 
(20%) and vermi-lobular in 3 cases (10%). In paediatric popula-
tion (PP), the sex ratio was 1.1 while in adult population (AP) 
it was 0.92. Medulloblastoma was the most common histological 
type for both PP and AP (61.9% and 40% respectively). Pilocytic 
astrocytoma (PA) represented the second most frequent tumour in 
PP (38.1%). In AP, haemangioblastoma and PA were diagnosed in 
8 and 3 cases respectively.
Conclusion: PCT represent with brainstem tumours 10% of all 
tumours of the CNS and are frequently encountered in paediatric 
population. Medulloblastoma and PA are the two most common 
tumours in childhood as reported in our study. According to the lit-
erature, the most common tumour in adults is haemangioblastoma. 
Contrary to what is reported, our study showed a high proportion 
of medulloblastoma in adults.

Analysis of the procedure for extracting, sending and receiving 
the muscle biopsy. Knowledge, attitudes and practices of the 
professionals involved
F. Leiva-Cepas*, J. Osuna Soto, M.J. Gálvez Medina, I. Sánchez 
Ramírez, J. Cámara Pérez
*University Hospital "Reina Sofía", Spain
Background & objectives: The knowledge of professionals related to 
muscle biopsy has not been estimated at present. The objective of this 
work is to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of medical 
specialists and those in training regarding the muscle biopsy procedure.
Methods: Observational, descriptive, cross-sectional and multi-
centre study (Provincial hospitals of the Andalusian Health Ser-
vice. Participants: Specialist physicians and in training randomly 
selected by sending an anonymous survey, previously validated, by 
email that included items on the sending of the sample, the excision 
of the sample, its orientation, volume, etc. . A descriptive, bivari-
ate and multivariate statistical analysis was performed (p <0.05).
Results: Participants: 22 professionals completed the survey 
(72.7% -16- neurosurgeon; 18.2% -4- plastic surgeons, 4.5% -1- 
pathologist and 4.5% -1- neurologist. 50% were resident intern 
specialists. 81.8% -18- were women. 66% of those surveyed did 
not know the volume of tissue to send to the Pathological Anatomy 
(AP) service. Only 18.2% informed AP about the shipment. 66.7% 
considered that they were not well educated about the procedure. 
73% did not reference the distal or proximal portion of the sample. 
10.1% personally sent the sample to the PC service for its correct 
reception.
Conclusion: Knowledge and practices about the muscle biopsy 
procedure in the subjects analysed are scarce, so specific training 
strategies to increase their knowledge and improve their attitude 
and skills regarding this procedure should be considered for actual 
incorporation into the plans training, to avoid diagnostic delays, 
inadequate handling of the sample and unnecessary reinterventions.

*Clinical Neuropathology, King’s College Hospital, United 
Kingdom
Background & objectives: Diffuse hemispheric glioma, H3 G34-
mutant is a novel paediatric tumour type in the fifth edition of the WHO 
Classification of CNS Tumours. We present here a global review of a 
departmental case series to provide further clarification on this entity.
Methods: Retrospective departmental analysis of 931 paediatric/young 
adult neuroepithelial tumours identified eleven cases harbouring H3 
G34R/V mutation. Clinicopathological and molecular data were reviewed.
Results: H3 G34R/V mutation was a rare molecular event among 
CNS tumours (1.2%; median age: 17.3 years). MRI revealed 
features of high-grade gliomas often involving multiple lobes and 
deep structures that precluded gross total resection. Histologically, 
the tumours showed marked heterogeneity and aggressive 
spreading along pre-existing brain structures and leptomeninges. 
Besides diagnostic H3 G34R/V mutation, most cases harboured 
pathogenic variants in TP53 and ATRX genes. Potential targetable 
mutations in PDGFRA and PIK3CA genes were detected in 5 
cases. Methylation profiling was a useful diagnostic tool and it 
also highlighted common structural chromosome abnormalities 
including PDGFRA amplification, CDKN2A/B deletion and 
various CNVs in cyclinD-CDK4/6-Rb pathway. The mean overall 
survival was 19.1 months.
Conclusion: H3 G34-mutant diffuse hemispheric glioma is a dis-
tinct CNS tumour type sharing common radiological and patho-
logical features and associated with a dismal prognosis. Genomic 
landscaping of individual tumours might give an opportunity to 
tailoring individualised therapies and improve patient management.

The role of AKT in prognosis of breast cancer brain metastases
J. Gama*, R. Oliveira, C. Abrantes, P. Teixeira, F. Silva, P. Figue-
iredo, O. Rebelo, M.A. Cipriano
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário, Portugal
Background & objectives: Brain metastases in breast cancer are linked 
to a poor prognosis and are a common event. Immunohistochemistry 
assessment of biomarkers may predict prognosis and guide therapy. 
Our goal was to investigate the role of the PTEN/AKT/PI3K pathway 
and androgen receptors.
Methods: A retrospective transversal study of 114 patients (diag-
nosed between 2000-2016) with breast cancer brain metastases was 
carried out using archival biological material.
Expression of PTEN, AKT, PI3K and Androgen receptors was 
assessed by immunohistochemistry.
Clinical and pathological data were retrieved from the hospital 
database. The local ethical committee approved this study.
Results: After a mean of 20.3±29.5 months, the median overall 
survival was of 10 months.
The overexpression of AKT was associated with a worse overall 
survival on univariate analysis (7 months (1.3-12.8) vs 12 months 
(5.6-18.2), p=0.034), but this finding was not confirmed in multi-
variate analysis (p=0.090).
No difference in overall survival was seen associated with the 
expression of PTEN (p=0.608), PI3K (p=0.167) and androgen 
receptors (p=0.894)
Conclusion: AKT is usually linked to tumour progression and drug 
resistance, thus it is expected that AKT overexpression is linked to 
worse overall survival in breast cancer and may have prognostic impact 
on survival in patients BCBM. Modulation of AKT and its pathway 
may be a strategy for guiding stratification and therapy of patients.

Choroid plexus tumours: clinicopathological analysis of 10 
cases

K. Bellil, S. Haouet
*Department of Pathology, La Rabta Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Choroid plexus tumours are rare intraven-
tricular neoplasms arising from choroid plexus epithelium. 3 histologi-
cal types have been described by the WHO : Papilloma, Atypical papil-
loma and Carcinoma. This study aims to highlight the epidemiological 
and pathological characteristics of this entity.
Methods: Our study is retrospective about ten cases of choroid 
plexus tumours collected in the pathology department of La Rabta 
hospital over a period of 22 years from 2000 to 2022. The data 
on patients’ gender, age, pathomorphological characteristics and 
location of the tumour, clinical presentation and operative details 
were retrieved from the National Institute of Neurology of Tunis.
Results: 10 cases were evaluable. They were 6female and 4male 
patients, ages ranging from 5 to 50 years with an average of 16,3 
years. The clinical presentation was dominated by intracranial pres-
sure syndrome. The main diagnostic tool was CT-scan and most 
patients with supratentorial tumour were children. All patients 
underwent surgical treatment. The histological examination has 
revealed 6 cases of papillomas and 4 cases of carcinomas. The 
papillomas corresponded to papillary tumoral proliferations with 
very low mitotic activity and whose cells were cuboid, resembling 
those of the normal choroid plexus. Carcinomas, on the other hand, 
appeared as frankly malignant tumours with significant mitotic 
activity, less good differentiation and areas of necrosis.
Conclusion: Choroid plexus tumours remain a very rare entity 
affecting mainly children and are classified into 3 histological 
types. Higher frequency and better prognosis have been seen with 
choroid plexus-papillomas. Surgery remains the mainstay of treat-
ment, often followed by adjuvant treatment in case of choroid 
plexus-carcinomas.

Background & objectives: Hydatid cyst is a parasitic tapeworm dis-
ease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus Granulosus usually 
reported in the liver. The NCS is still a rare location. Our aim is to 
define the epidemiological and pathological characteristics of this 
entity.
Methods: Our study is retrospective about nine cases of hydatid 
cysts of the nervous central system (NCS) collected in the pathol-
ogy department of La Rabta hospital over a period of 6 years from 
2016 to 2022. The data on patients’ gender, age, histology and 
location of the cyst and operative details were retrieved from the

Results: 9 cases were evaluable. They were 3male and 6 female 
patients, ages ranging from 5 to 75 years with an average of 29,5 
years. Among these cases, 2 involved the brainstem and 7 involved 
the parietal lobe. All of patients had a rural origin and contact 
with dogs. The clinical presentation was dominated by intracra-
nial pressure syndrome with focal neurologic deficit. The radio-
logic findings range from purely cystic lesions to a completely 
solid appearance. All of the patients underwent surgical treatment. 
The histological examination had adjusted the diagnosis showing 
hydatid membranes with an eosinophilic laminated appearance, 
containing daughter cysts filled with gel-like fluid and a pericyst 
on the periphery.
Conclusion: While the liver is usually the most frequently involved 
organ in hydatid disease, the nervous central system (NCS) is still a 
rare location leading to several complications in case of late diag-
nosis. The main diagnostic tool remains always the histopathologic 
examination

Group work in the annotation of virtual pathological slides
D. Jovanovic*
*Trinity Medical Sciences University, USA
Background & objectives: One of the important goal of modern medi-
cal education is to create a learning environment for interactive dis-
cussion and collaboration. The objective of our study was to compare 
the results of individual and team annotation of digitized pathological 
slides.
Methods: Based on students’ academic performance, gender and 
ethnicity, heterogeneous teams were created randomly. Students 
first annotated virtual slides individually and then in a group. Dif-
ferences in individual and group scores were tested using paired 
samples T-test. Probability level of p < 0.05 was considered sig-
nificant. Normality of distribution of students’ answers was tested 
using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Results: General pathology students scored significantly higher 
(p<0.001) in group (Average group score 25.0, SD 2.4) as opposed 
to individual readings (Average individual score 3.6, SD 1.6). In T4 
group studying systemic pathology and working in a group scored 
significantly higher (Average group score 60.8, SD 6.0, p<0.00) 
compared with individual annotations (Average group score 26.5, 
SD 11.0). A similar finding was observed when the scores were 
stratified according to students groups, all groups in Term 3 and in 
Term 4 achievement was significantly higher (p<0.003) in group 
compared with individual reading. Both the students with lower 
and with higher academic achievement significantly (p<0.03 and 
p<0.05, respectively) improves the results.
Conclusion: Group work in the annotation of pathological slides 
has learning potential and facilitate interaction between students. 
This way of analysing pathological slides significantly improves 
the results of students with lower as well as of students with higher 
academic achievement. Team work is a part of active learning and 
is the most important task of modern and high-quality healthcare 
education. This is supporting students to become reflective and 
competent physicians.

and Perinatology named after Academician V.I. Kulakov, Russia
Background & objectives: Plasminogen plays an active role in tumour 
metastasis as a proteolytic enzyme. The study aimed to analysed poten-
tial diagnostic power of circulating IgG to Plasminogen in blood of 
mice with and without breast cancer
Methods: Plasma samples were obtained from Balb/c mice with (n 
= 25) and without (n = 20) breast cancer. The level of IgG binding 
plasminogen was analysed by ELISA on 96-well plates with immo-
bilized glu-plasminogen. The comparisons of mean OD between 
cohorts were performed by the Mann–Whitney U-test. Potential 
diagnostic power of IgG was investigated by ROC curve analysis
Results: Breast cancer in mice was confirmed using physical exami-
nation and biopsies. Plasma samples from breast cancer and healthy 
mice were incubated in 96-well plates coated with glu-plasminogen 
and IgG binding was measured by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG 
Abs. We observed significantly higher circulating levels of IgG to 
plasminogen in a group of mice with breast cancer compared to a 
group of healthy mice (p<0.05). In ROC curve analysis the sensitiv-
ity of the classification of breast cancer from healthy controls was 
72%, the specificity was 95% and the area under the curve was 0.93
Conclusion: Our results require further confirmation in women 
with breast cancer and investigation of the mechanism of IgG bind-
ing to glu-plasminogen in blood. The potential diagnostic power

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) block stability 
using PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx
C. Roach*
*Agilent Technologies, USA
Background & objectives: PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx is a qualita-
tive immunohistochemical (IHC) assay for PD-L1 expression in FFPE 
specimens routinely processed for diagnostic evaluation.
A stability study was performed to assess the effects of PD-L1 
expression in aged FFPE blocks stored over time.
Methods: Human placenta tissue was used as a model since syncy-
tiotrophoblastic cells have features similar to malignant cells. Fresh 
tissue was procured and prepared as FFPE blocks to control pre-
analytical variables such as processing, ischemic time, and fixation 
time. Fifteen placenta blocks from 5 cases were stained by IHC at 
intervals from 0-60 months (5 years) using PD-L1 IHC 22C3.
Results: PD-L1 expression was evaluated and assessed for any 
changes in overall staining intensity over time compared to the 
initial Time 0 staining. Our results showed no significant change 
in PD-L1 expression in sections from aged FFPE placenta tissue 
blocks stored in the dark with ambient conditions over time for up 
to 5 years. Similar sensitivity to titrations was observed between 
placenta and NSCLC.
Conclusion: FFPE tissue blocks stored in the dark at ambient tem-
perature for up to 5 years demonstrated similar PD-L1 expression 
compared to non-aged blocks and thus, demonstrate stability over 
time.

Direct scanning of selected FFPE blocks to reduce workflow 
costs of routine FFPE controls in histopathology
A. Nguyen, M. Algoe, J. Giang, J. Van Brakel, M. Nap, F. Van 
Kemenade*
*Dep of Pathology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Pathology departments face high costs 
of slide cutting, staining and coverslipping. We employed a large 
field-of-view confocal microscope allowing to image thick specimens 
(Histolog® Scanner) for scanning FFPE blocks to investigate whether 
this could reduce the number of slide prepared.
Methods: Lung (n=47) and pancreas (n=23) FFPE blocks were 
imaged with the Histolog Scanner. Pathologists, residents and one 
grossing room technician were asked to diagnose independently in 
confocal images if the block is exclusively composed of normal tissue 
or not. Rate of image rejection prior diagnosis due to insufficient 
image quality is monitored for further costs saving assessments.
Results: Rate of image rejection were 17% for pancreas and 23% 
for lung tissues reducing the potential cost savings (these blocks 
would be processed whatever their content in a routine practice). 
On the non-rejected images, observers were able to recognize tissue 
features in FFPE block images despite loss of nuclear detail and 
lack of colour nuances compared to H&E slides. Accuracy to define 
that the blocks are exclusively composed of normal tissue yielded 
high scores for both tissue types: overall sensitivity/specificity of 
96%/100% for pancreas (2 pathologists, 1 resident) and of 93%/83% 
for lungs (4 residents, 7 pathologists, 1 grossing room technician). 
Similar performances between the three observer populations were 
found.
Conclusion: Direct image assessment of FFPE blocks by His-
tolog® Scanner seems to yield acceptable images compared to 
H&E slides. Preliminary results showed that good performance 
of FFPE block screening can potentially be achieved for pancreas 
and lung tissues with very high sensitivity before the preparation 
of histology slides. This allows potential cost reduction in slide 
preparation and infrastructure costs for slide storage.

Audit of pathology quality assurance programmes: assessing 
efficacy and workload
D. O’Dwyer*, M. Agarwal
*University Hospital Monklands, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Studies have highlighted significant 
discrepancies between original and review pathology diagnoses. 
Quality assurance programmes can improve reporting accuracy. This 
audit assessed the effectiveness of quality assurance programmes within 
a single institution and determined the frequency of discrepancies in 
reporting.
Methods: Retrospective review of cases collected over a one year 
period was performed. Cases were continuously recorded during 
this time following review at MDT or clinical meetings and review 
of randomly selected cases. Frequency of overall reporting errors 
was calculated and chi square analysis was performed to detect 
potential disproportionate review of specific specialties.
Results: The continuous quality assurance programme ensured 
review of 7.7% of the total histology and cytopathology workload 
over 1 year. Proportionally more histology cases were reviewed 
compared to cytopathology (p=<0.00001). Randomly assigned 
review of cases accounted for only 9.7% of the quality assurance 
programme workload whilst the rest came from review at MDT or 
clinical meetings.
The proportionate percentage of cases reviewed as per overall spe-
cialty workload was significantly different: urology 49.3%, respira-
tory 37.3%, H&N 16.7%, skin 9.0%, gynaecology 6.2%, gastroin-
testinal 4.4% and breast 1.7% of cases.
There was complete diagnostic agreement in 94.9% of reports and 
errors regarded as potentially clinically significant were recorded 
in 0.9% of cases overall.
Conclusion: Our quality assurance programme ensured review of 
a significant proportion of overall workload compared to other 
studies (1.3-8.9%) with comparatively low significant error rates 
(0.8-5.3%).
Within our institution the combined approach of random plus 
focused case review effectively detects reporting discrepancies 
and is pragmatic and efficient.
To our knowledge we are the first to assess whether cases reviewed 
within a quality assurance programme proportionately reflect over-
all workload. This information is important to improve effective-
ness of quality assurance programmes.

Extrapulmonary POU2F3-positive small cell carcinoma is asso-
ciated with variable neuroendocrine marker expression and 
gallbladder location
M.H. Nam*, C. Chen, Y. Zhang, J. Lee, Y. Kao
*Department of Pathology, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical 
University, Taipei, Taiwan
Background & objectives: POU2F3 is recently identified as the defin-
ing biomarker of a subset of small cell carcinoma (SmCC) of lung asso-
ciated with neuroendocrine-low immunoprofile and poor prognosis. 
Here, we aimed to explore the presence of POU2F3-positive extrapul-
monary SmCC and its clinicopathologic characteristics.
Methods: Thirty-four extrapulmonary SmCC from various 
organs were collected for POU2F3 immunohistochemical stain-
ing. The age, sex, primary location, histology (pure versus com-
bined SmCC), and the expression of TTF-1 and available neu-
roendocrine markers, including synaptophysin, chromogranin A, 
and/or INSM1, were recorded. To examine its specificity, we also 
performed POU2F3 staining on 849 cases of 32 different histo-
types, including carcinomas, lymphomas, and sarcomas.
Results: POU2F3 immunostaining was positive in 5 (14.7%) 
extrapulmonary SmCC, originating in the gallbladder (n=3), 
urinary bladder (n=1), and uterine cervix (n=1). The patients 
ranged from 52-89 years old. Histologic types were pure 
SmCC in 4 and combined urothelial carcinoma/SmCC in 1. 
Synaptophysin was positive in 4 (80%) cases, ranging from 
strong/diffuse to weak/focal. INSM-1 was positive in both cases 
with available results (focal/weak and diffuse/moderate in one 
each). Chromogranin A and TTF-1 were negative. In other 
tumour types tested, POU2F3 stain was mostly negative, except 
focal staining in 1 ductal carcinoma in situ of breast (3.4%), 2 
gastric adenocarcinomas (1.2%), and 1 invasive carcinoma of 
breast (0.7%).
Conclusion: Aside from pulmonary SmCC, POU2F3 expression 
was also found in a minority of extrapulmonary SmCC. Although 
the case number was small, our data suggested a potential predi-
lection of gallbladder location and a wide range of synaptophysin 
and INSM1 expressions. Among different tumour types, POU2F3 
is relatively specific to SmCC and may serve as a valuable addi-
tion to the diagnostic panel for SmCC. Further study is needed to 
investigate the prognostic and therapeutic significance of POU2F3 
expression in extrapulmonary SmCC.

Influence of tobacco cigarettes on the oral mucosa
V. Gargin*, R. Nazaryan, L. Kryvenko, Y. Zakut, T. Popova
*Kharkiv National Medical University, Ukraine
Background & objectives: Despite well-documented adverse effects 
of tobacco consumption, mechanism of its influence on oral mucosa 
is not clear. The objective of the performed research was to assess the 
effect of smoking on the morphofunctional state of periodontal tissues 
in young animals.
Methods: 30 ten-week-old WAG rats were randomly distributed 
in two groups, as follows: control animals and tobacco exposed. 
Smoking was generated using the Boyarchuck chamber operated 
in a one-pass mode with the smoking feed controlled externally 
by a metering pump. Morphologic study with morphometry was 
performed.
Results: Morphological study of oral mucosa was carried out after 
removing the animals from the experiment on the 90th day. The 
study of histological specimens of the experimental group showed 
moderate hyperkeratosis of the epithelium. Own plate was found 
with acanthotic cords with increased number of fibroblasts, single 
leukocytes, sclerosis of the reticular layer. The vessels of microcir-
culatory bed have been characterized by uneven blood filling with 
background of isolate vessels that have fallen lumens and presence 
of blood-empty arterioles and capillaries with signs of constriction. 
Endotheliocytes are flattened with signs of desquamation in focus 
of ischemia in slides stained according to Rego.
Conclusion: Morphometric study proves reducing vascular 
density from 19,44±1,97% to 10,01±1,33 %, increasing area of 
connective tissue from 18,33±2,71% to 29,54±1,87%, spreading 
area of tissue with ischemia from 1,14±0,70% to 7,44±1,60%. 
Morphofunctional changes in the periodontium with damage 
to the structure of the epithelial membrane and changes in its 
permeability, microcirculatory disorders, sclerotic changes are a 
manifestation of the initial inflammatory and dystrophic processes 
that can lead to persistent chronic process in oral mucosa.
Funding: This study is the part of scientific research work “Opti-
mization of early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of oral tis-
sue diseases with smoking addiction”, № 0120U102057, Kharkiv 
National Medical University, and is funded by Ministry of Health

Prevalence of vessels encapsulating tumour clusters (VETC) 
in human cancers
S.L. Renne*, R. Akpinar, M. Coto-Llerena, L. Terracciano, L. Di 
Tommaso, S. Piscuoglio
*Humanitas Clinical and Research Center – IRCCS, Humanitas 
University, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Rozzano, Italy
Background & objectives: VETC shields tumour-cell clusters, pro-
moting free circulation in the bloodstream. This mechanism of metas-
tasization is an alternative to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 
process, and has been recently described in hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC), however the prevalence of VETC among cancers is unknown.
Methods: We assessed the VETC prevalence on a retrospective 
series of 1861 neoplastic samples from 1796 patients comprising 
24 different histologies. VETC was defined as continuous endothe-
lial covering of neoplastic clusters and highlighted by CD34 immu-
nohistochemistry. Analysis was performed on a tissue microarray 
by experienced pathologists blinded to clinical and pathological 
data.
Results: VETC was present in 73/1769 cases (4%) and in 10/23 
histotypes (44%). The histotypes that had VETC+ cases were renal 
cancer (RCC) 29/115 (25%), HCC 23/102 (23%), prostate cancer 
(PRC) 7/42 (17%), mesotheliomas 2/17 (12%), pancreatic cancer 
4/84 (5%), oesophageal cancer 2/72 (3%), and gastric cancer 3/158 
(2%). Colorectal, extrahepatic bile duct, and urinary bladder can-
cer had one VETC+ case each. Cases with VETC+ tended to be 
associated to the intermediate histologic grade (G2; p<0.0001). 
Age, size, survival, and status were similar between the two groups.
Conclusion: VETC is present across different histotypes and might 
represent an alternative mechanism of metastasis. Even if present 
in a minority of cases, VETC was peculiar of some histotypes 
(especially HCC, RCC, PRC), possibly representing a histotype-
specific angiogenetic mechanism. Since VETC predicts response 
to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, further studies are warranted to assess 
the prognostic and predictive value of this peculiar vascularization 
type.

FABP1 expression in human tumours: a tissue microarray 
study on 17,071 tumours
D. Dum, C. Bernreuther, A. Luebke, V. Reiswich, R. Simon, D. 
Höflmayer, A. Marx, S. Minner, T.S. Clauditz*, T. Krech
*University Medical Center Hamburg, Germany
Background & objectives: Fatty acid binding protein 1 (FABP1) 
is a key protein for the metabolism of fatty acids. It is abundantly 
expressed in the liver (10%of cytosolic proteins). Because of its high 
tissue specificity, immunohistochemical FABP1 is thought to have 
diagnostic utility.
Methods: A set of tissue microarrays containing 17,071 samples 
from 150 different tumour types and subtypes as well as 608 
samples of 76 different normal tissue types was analysed by 
immunohistochemistry, to comprehensively determine the patterns 
of FABP1 expression in normal and neoplastic tissues.
Results: Among normal tissues, strong FABP1 immunostaining 
occurred in hepatocytes, proximal tubuli of the kidney and in 
epithelial cells of the small intestine, appendix, and the colorec-
tum. FABP1 positivity was found in 24 of 150 tumour categories, 
including 17 with ≥1 strongly positive case. The highest FABP1 
positivity rates were seen in colorectal adenomas (86%), colorec-
tal adenocarcinomas (71.1%) and in hepatocellular carcinomas 
(65.3%), followed by mucinous carcinoma of the ovary (34.6%), 
cholangiocarcinoma (21.6%), and various adenocarcinomas from 
the digestive tract (10-23%). In colorectal cancer, reduced FABP1 
expression was linked to microsatellite instability, right-sided 
tumour location (p<0.0001 each), and absence of BRAF V600E 
mutations (p=0.001), but unrelated to pT and pN status.
Conclusion: FABP1 immunostaining has considerably high tumour 
specificity. As FABP1 expression is virtually absent in adenocar-
cinomas of the lung, FABP1 immunohistochemistry might be par-
ticularly helpful to assist in the identification of metastatic adeno-
carcinoma to the lung.

various medical displays and quantify their impact on the visual repro-
ducibility of significant clinical structures.
Methods: Using display simulation models, we quantify the 
impact of modern medical displays on the visualization of whole 
slide images (WSIs). We included H&E and IHC-stained slides 
from 400 patients, originating from different laboratories which 
were digitized with scanners from various vendors. In addition to 
overall statistics, the perceptual contrast for certain histological 
structures is measured and compared for various displays.
Results: Using the ΔE method, we found that different displays 
may introduce a significant difference in perceptual contrast 
of certain histological structures by up to 2.7ΔE. This effect 
can further deteriorate over time, due to a decrease in display 
luminance. This observation advocates the need for continuous 
display calibration and adequate quality assurance mechanisms.
Some medical grade displays for pathology incorporate such 
quality assurance automatically by factoring in the ambient light-
ing conditions and optimizing visibility of subtle colour differ-
ences. This can increase the contrast of histological features such 
as nuclei characteristics by at least additional 0.9 ΔE.
Conclusion: In radiology, display systems have been exten-
sively studied, resulting in standardization, clear requirements, 
and guidelines. However, image data, viewing modalities and 
ambient conditions in digital pathology differ greatly from radi-
ology. Therefore, independent investigations must be conducted 
here. The presented experiments illustrate the variability between 
displays and the perceived image characteristics for specific his-
tological features in order to translate generic display specifica-
tions into clinical implications.

lez, F.M. Pérez, N. Carreras-Dieguez, J. Ordi, C. Menéndez
*Hospital Clínic Barcelona, Spain
Background & objectives: Adequate data on gestational age at perina-
tal autopsy is usually non available in many low-income countries. We 
aimed to evaluate the usefulness of post-mortem ultrasound measure-
ment of trans-cerebellar diameter and height of cerebellar vermis for 
gestational age determination.
Methods: Gestational age, intrauterine growth parameters and 
ultrasound reports were retrieved for all consecutive perinatal 
autopsy cases from July 2020 to April 2022. A total of 70 cases (68 
stillbirths and 2 neonates) with no intrauterine growth restriction 
or ultrasound brain abnormalities were enrolled. All measurements 
were performed through the anterior fontanelle. The Pearson cor-
relation coefficient (r) and p-values were calculated.
Results: Mean (SD) gestational age was 22.7 weeks (4.5). Most 
of stillborn deaths (54; 80%) were due to legal abortion. Other 
intrauterine deaths (14; 20%) comprised chorioamnionitis (42%), 
intrauterine hypoxia (42%) and unknown causes (16%). The two 
neonatal deaths were due to prematurity complications. Trans-cer-
ebellar diameter was measured in all 70 cases (100%) and height of 
cerebellar vermis in 60/70 cases (85.7%). Trans-cerebellar diameter 
ranged from 18.5 mm at 17.5 weeks to 56.2 at 40.6 weeks. Height 
of cerebellar vermis ranged from 8 mm (at 17.5 weeks) to 30.6 at 
40.6 weeks. Both trans-cerebellar diameter and height of cerebel-
lar vermis correlated significantly with gestational age (r=0.84; 
p<0.0001 and r=0.87; p<0.0001, respectively).
Conclusion: Post-mortem ultrasound measurements of trans-cer-
ebellar diameter and height of cerebellar vermis could be useful 
in low-resource settings for obtaining gestational age data. Both 
measurements can be rapidly conducted with portable ultrasound 
device. These data are especially useful when evaluating results of 
minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS), a procedure based on 
core needle biopsies, which use is currently expanding in countries 
of Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia.

parameters and biomarkers for identification of prematurity and 
pre-eclampsia as causes of perinatal mortality" managed by Bar-

The morphological spectrum and molecular features of somatic 
malignant transformation in germ cell tumours
J. Lobo*, Â. Rodrigues, R. Henrique, A. Christiansen, J. Beyer, 
H. Moch, P.K. Bode
*IPO Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Somatic malignant transformation (SMT) 
arising in germ cell tumours (GCTs) is an infrequent, but clinically 
relevant event. There is only limited knowledge on the morphological 
spectrum of SMT, and therapeutic management of these patients is 
poorly defined.
Methods: In this work we revisit two consecutive case series 
(n=756) of GCTs diagnosed at University Hospital Zurich, Swit-
zerland and IPO Porto, Portugal. Clinicopathological data of SMT 
arising in GCT were determined, with focus on the histopathologi-
cal spectrum, and molecular aspects were obtained by Fluorescence 
in situ Hybridization (FISH) and Next Generation Sequencing 
(NGS).
Results: 30 male patients (28 testicular, 2 extragonadal) were 
included (representing 4% of GCT patients diagnosed in both 
institutes). The most common SMT were adenocarcinoma (n=8), 
embryonic-type neuroectodermal tumours (ENETs, n=8) and 
rhabdomyosarcoma (n=6), but a wide range of challenging mor-
phologies were depicted, including low-grade neuroglial tumour, 
adenosquamous carcinoma, neuroblastoma and neuroendocrine car-
cinoma. SMT was found in 15 primary tumours and in 27 metasta-
ses of these 30 patients, the latter showing poorer overall-survival. 
Adenocarcinoma occurred in metastases post-chemotherapy, but 
not in the testis. 12p gains were identified in all cases. NGS results 
were available in 6 patients. Clinical trials/targeted treatments 
based on the molecular profile were recommended in 4 patients.
Conclusion: SMT arising in GCTs represents a diagnostic chal-
lenge and should be confirmed by a specialized uropathologist. 
NGS based treatment recommendations may improve outcome of 
these patients.

*IPO Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Eosinophilic solid and cystic renal cell 
carcinoma (ESC RCC) shows frequent CK20 positivity and TSC muta-
tions. In contrast, frequency of CK20 expression and presence of TSC 
mutations are unclear in TFEB-amplified RCC and TFEB-translocated 
RCC, which frequently express Melan A.
Methods: Herein, we compare 6 ESC RCC with 4 TFEB-amplified/
translocated RCC. We assess the frequency of CK20 and Melan A 
expression by immunohistochemistry, and of TSC mutations by 
next generation sequencing. TFEB alterations were confirmed by 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
Results: All tumours showed voluminous eosinophilic cells with 
granular cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli, and most showed admix-
ture of solid and cystic areas. CK20 expression was found in all 6 
ESC RCC and in all RCCs with TFEB alterations. Melan A positiv-
ity was identified in 5/6 ESC RCC and 4/4 RCC with TFEB altera-
tions. We found TSC mutations in 2 ESC RCCs, including in one 
case also harbouring a CIC fusion, unreported to date. However, 
we also identified a TSC mutation in one TFEB-amplified RCC.
Conclusion: ESC RCC represents an emerging renal tumour entity 
with some histological, immunohistochemical and molecular over-
lap to TFEB-amplified/translocated RCC. FISH for TFEB aids in 
this differential diagnosis in challenging cases.

Reliability of histological subtyping of penile squamous cell 
carcinoma in assessing HPV tumour status
L. Dorofte*, S. Davidsson, G. Lillsunde Larsson, M. Karlsson
*Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and 
Health, Örebro University, Örebro, Sweden
Background & objectives: HPV-positive penile tumours have been asso-
ciated with higher survival rates. However, HPV analysis is unavailable 
in many low-income countries. We investigated if histological assessment 
of penile squamous cell carcinoma subtypes can replace HPV testing in 
determining HPV-related/non-HPV-related tumour status.
Methods: We reviewed paraffin-embedded tumour tissue from 345 
penile cancer patients, surgically treated between 2009 and 2018 
at Örebro University Hospital, Sweden. The histological subtype 
of squamous cell carcinoma was assessed according to the WHO 
criteria and ISUP recommendations. HPV-DNA genotyping was 
performed using the PCR method Anyplex II HPV28. Concordance 
was assessed by calculating Cohen’s kappa (κ).
Results: A good concordance was found between histological subtype of 
squamous cell carcinoma and HPV tumour-status with a Cohen’s kappa (κ) 
of 0,72 corresponding to 86,6% agreement. Of the 46 discordant cases, five 
had HPV-related histology (mixed subtypes) but were HPV-negative. The 
remaining 41 cases had non-HPV- related histology (85% usual subtype, 
15% mixed subtypes) but were HPV-positive. Noteworthy is that in 21 of 
the cases with non-HPV-related histology, foci of undifferentiated PeIN 
was found. In addition, four cases with both undifferentiated PeIN and 
lichen sclerosus et atrophicus in the tumour margin, 14 cases with both 
differentiated PeIN and lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and two cases without 
preneoplastic lesion were identified.
Conclusion: Good concordance between histological subtype of 
penile squamous cell carcinoma and HPV genotyping shows that 
when necessary, histological assessment is a good alternative, at 
least in less resourceful settings, to PCR-based HPV analysis in 
determining if penile tumours are HPV or non-HPV-related. Dis-
cordant cases most likely depend on subjectivity in histological 
assessment but can also suggest a HPV infection in a non-HPV-
related tumour.

Benign clear cell clusters in non-tumoral nephrectomy 
specimens

Antón Badiola, J. González Carreró Fojón, J.A. Ortiz Rey
*Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Vigo, Department of 
Pathology, Spain
Background & objectives: Clear cell clusters (CCCs) constitute 
a benign change occasionally found in the kidney (Virchows Arch. 
2021;479:57-67). They must be recognised to avoid a misdiagnosis 
of renal carcinoma. Etiopathogenesis of CCCs and their frequency in 
atrophic kidneys are not known.
Methods: 157 consecutive non-tumoral nephrectomy surgical 
specimens were retrospectively reviewed. Immunohistochemical 
stainings were performed using an enzyme-conjugated multimer 
complex (OptiView DAB Detection Kit, Ventana) in an automatic 
stainer (Benchmarck Ultra). Heat antigen retrieval was done in 
the automatic stainer. Electron microscopy studies were performed 
on FFPE tissue. Ultrathin sections were examined with a Philips 
CM100 electron microscope.
Results: Six cases (3,82%) showed CCCs. This change was multi-
focal and found in 100% of the samples of five cases and in 83% of 
the slides of the other one. They were in the renal cortex, predomi-
nantly in a subcapsular location. CCCs were composed by large 
cells with clear/foamy cytoplasm, forming predominantly solid 
nests, as well as occasional tubules with narrow lumina. Adjacent 
renal parenchyma showed interstitial fibrosis with tubular atrophy, 
glomerulosclerosis, and sclerosis of vessel walls. CCCs were CK7, 
Ksp-cadherin and EMA positive, and negative for RCC marker and 
AMACR with focal immunoreactivity for CD10. Ultrastructurally, 
cytoplasms were filled of disrupted organellas with mitochondrial 
and endoplasmic reticulum ballooning degeneration.
Conclusion: CCCs are rare in nonfunctioning / atrophic 
kidneys (<5%). It is a multifocal change in the cortex, often 
subcapsular. Ultrastructural appearance suggests that they are 
caused by intracellular oedema of tubular cells with disruption of 
organellas. CCCs show a distal tubule immunophenotype except 
focal positivity for CD10. The absence of atypia, the subcapsular 
location and the coexistence of atrophy / ischemic changes help 
to the diagnosis.

Background & objectives: B7-H3 is a newly discovered member of 
the B7 family of immune checkpoint molecules with both immune and 
non-immune functions. We investigated the relationship of B7-H3 to 
the tumour microenvironment as well as its non-immune functions in 
prostate cancer (PCa).
Methods: We developed a discovery tissue microarray from 94 
PCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy with curative 
intent. This was stained manually with B7-H3 and correlated to

patient clinicopathological parameters. Also, functional studies of 
growth, apoptosis, migration and invasion were conducted on PCa 
human cell lines with transient and permanent silencing of the 
B7-H3 protein.
Results: High B7-H3 expression correlated with worse clinico-
pathological patient features in intermediate and high risk PCa 
patients, including higher T stage (p<0.0001), perineural inva-
sion (p=0.01) and lymph node spread (p=0.0006). Loss of B7-H3 
expression did not affect prostate cancer cell growth or apoptosis 
in vitro. In contrast, there was significant decrease in migration 
and invasion with scratch wound assays, transwell migration assays 
and inverted transwell migration assays in vitro following sup-
pressed B7-H3 expression in multiple human prostate cancer cell 
lines. RNA sequencing identified extracellular space chemotactic 
cytokines and their receptors, such as CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL8, 
CXCL6 and CXCL16 to be highly downregulated genes in PC3M 
cells with B7-H3 knocked out.
Conclusion: B7-H3 protein is overexpressed in PCa making it a 
promising target for immunotherapies. Examining human tissue 
samples, we showed an association of B7-H3 expression and 
aggressive clinical features, including lymph node spread. In vitro 
experiments with acute and chronic loss of B7-H3 revealed an 
effect on migration and invasion. Future experiments are required 
to investigate the mechanistic downstream pathways of this 
phenotype and further evaluate the role of B7-H3 in metastasis 
in vivo.

reirós, S. Abdulkader Sande, A. Bellas Pereira, P. San Miguel 
Fraile, J. González-Carreró Fojón, J.A. Ortiz Rey
*Hospital Álvaro Cunqueiro, Spain
Background & objectives: Periprostatic paraganglia (PP) can be a 
pitfall leading to a misdiagnosis of prostatic carcinoma.
Most of paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas are positive for 
GATA-3. To the best of our knowledge this fact has not been stud-
ied in normal PP.
Methods: Radical prostatectomy surgical specimens in which PP 
were observed with hematoxylin-eosin were selected for the study. 
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were immunostained 
with a GATA-3 monoclonal antibody (clone L50-823) using an 
enzyme-conjugated multimer complex (OptiView DAB Detection 
Kit®, Ventana Medical Systems, Illkirch, France) in an automatic
stainer (Benchmark Ultra®). Heat antigen retrieval was done in 
the automatic stainer.
Results: Thirteen PP were found in twelve radical prostatecto-
mies (8,1% of the total of the surgical specimens). PP ranged in 
size from 190 to 1140 μm, with a median dimension of 499,38 
μm. They were located within the adipose periprostatic tissue 
in the middle region (10 cases, of which 8 were in the postero-
lateral area and 2 were anterior); two at the base and one at the 
apex. 6 PP were on the right and 5 on the left side; one in the 
middle line and one was unknown. There was available tissue 
for immunohistochemistry in 10 cases, all of which showed 
intense and diffuse nuclear staining for GATA-3.
Conclusion: PP have been found in radical prostatectomy 
specimens with a frequency similar to previously reported (around 
8% of the cases). They are located in the periprostatic tissue, 
predominantly in the middle region and the posterolateral aspect 
of the prostate. A frequent clear cytoplasmic appearance of PP cells 
can lead to a misdiagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma. GATA-3 is 
a useful immunohistochemical marker for the differential diagnosis 
as it is strongly positive in PP.

Prognostic value of tumour budding in urinary tract cancer: 
a meta-analysis
R. SHI*, M.T.L. Tan, G.H. Lim, L. Zeng, P.H. Tan
*Department of Anatomical Pathology, Singapore General Hos-
pital, Singapore
Background & objectives: Recently, tumour budding (TB) has been 
suggested as a strong prognostic marker in urinary tract cancer. The 
aim of this systematic review is to test the prognostic value of TB in 
urothelial cancer by a meta-analysis of previously published studies.
Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature related to 
TB by using the databases of PubMed and Web of Science. The 
search was limited to publications in the English language up to 
and including December 2021.
Results: There were 790 patients from 8 retrospective studies 
in which TB has been evaluated in urinary tract cancer. The 
meta-analysis of eligible studies revealed that TB is a significant 
prognosticator for progression free survival, with a risk ratio 
(RR) of 3.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.01– 6.08; P < 
0.001) in univariate analysis, and with a RR of 2.81 (95% CI 
1.75–4.51; P < 0.001) in multivariate analysis; a significant 
prognosticator overall survival, with a risk ratio (RR) of 2.80 
(95% CI 1.96– 3.99; P < 0.001) in univariate analysis, and with 
an RR of 1.02 (95% CI 1.01–1.03; P < 0.001) in multivariate 
analysis.
Conclusion: We conclude that a high TB score is a promising 
prognostic marker of poor survival in urinary tract cancer. 
Because of its simplicity and high predictive power, TB is strongly 
recommended to be included in the routine pathology report of 
urinary tract cancer.

cell carcinoma

in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Poland;

Oncology Centre-Prof. Franciszek Łukaszczyk Memorial Hospital, 
Bydgoszcz, Poland
Background & objectives: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a 
malignancy that in advanced disease, is exceptionally resistant 
to systemic therapies. TOLLIP protein is a regulator of immune 
responses. We explored the relationships between the clinical course 
of RCC and TOLLIP protein expression.
Methods: The tissue microarray (TMA) cohort contained 95 cores 
of primary tumour, matched metastases and matched adjacent tis-
sues derived from 32 RCC patients. The mean follow-up was 105 
months. Immunohistochemical analysis of TOLLIP was performed 
on all tissue samples. TOLLIP expression was evaluated using the 
H-score and then analysed with patients’ clinical data.
Results: All the examined samples showed cytoplasmic TOLLIP 
expression with the median value of 100 in primary tumours, 107.5 
in metastases, and 220 in the control group. The expression was 
significantly higher in the normal adjacent tissues compared to

primary or metastatic RCC (p < 0.05). We observed moderate posi-
tive correlation between expressions of TOLLIP in the primary 
tumour and its metastases (p < 0.05; k=0.48). Elevated TOLLIP 
expression correlated with worse overall survival (OS) (median 
OS, 64 vs. 101 months, p < 0.05).
Conclusion: High TOLLIP expression predicts poor prognosis in 
RCC patients. The enhancement of TOLLIP expression probably 
occurs in the early stages of RCC, before the development 
of metastatic competence. While TOLLIP reduces immune 
surveillance and increases autophagy, our results suggest that it 
could drive the escape phase of immunoediting and compromise 
both immuno and targeted therapy.

Role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in clear cell renal 
cell carcinoma
J. Jeruc*, T. Čugura, S. Uhan, N. Zidar, E. Boštjančič
*Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Lju-
bljana, Slovenia
Background & objectives: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
is believed to be the key process in development and progression of 
cancer, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with miR-200 family 
and miR-205 being key regulators. The exact role of EMT in RCC is 
not fully understood.
Methods: We analysed the expression of miR-200 family and miR-
205 and their targets, ZEB1 and ZEB2, using qPCR and ZEB2 
using IHC. Twenty cases (in total 50 samples) of formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded tissue were included, 10 RCC without and 10 
with sarcomatoid differentiation (RCC-Sa). In RCC-Sa, sarcoma-
toid and clear cell component were investigated separately. Micro-
scopically normal renal tissue was used as control.
Results: Interestingly, miR-200 family and miR-205 were down-
regulated (hallmark of EMT) in both, clear cell component 
and sarcomatoid differentiation of RCC-Sa when compared to 
corresponding normal renal tissue. Moreover, they were down-
regulated even in clear cell component of RCC without sarcomatoid 
differentiation. Their target genes transcription factors (TFs) of 
EMT also showed interesting expression: ZEB1 was not expressed, 
whereas ZEB2 showed variable pattern of expression, being either 
up- or down-regulated when compared to normal renal tissue 
irrespective of analysed component. Results of IHC support this 
information.
Conclusion: Our result on miR-200 family and miR-205 expression 
suggest that EMT is involved not only in development of RCC-Sa 
but also in development of RCC. However, their target genes, ZEB1 
and ZEB2 seems to have minor role in this process. Our results 
further confirm that although ZEB1 and ZEB2 are highly related, 
they may have opposing effects and expression patterns in tumour 
biology. miR-200 family and miR-205 are probably involved in 
EMT regulation trough other targeted EMT-TFs.

Spontaneous regression - scars of testicular germ cell tumours: 
association with clinicopathological features - institutional 
experience
B. Jovanović*, B. Kovačević, I. Nikolić
*Military Medical Academy, Serbia
Background & objectives: Scars in testicular parenchyma as a his-
tological element of GCT spontaneous regression is a rare but well-
recognized phenomenon. We analysed the presence and frequency of 
complete or partial/focal scarring of GCT and their association with 
clinicopathological features of GCT.
Methods: A surgical pathology archive between 2007 and 2022 
has been searched for cases of GCT that had reported in the final 
diagnosis partial/focal or complete scarring of GCT. The associa-
tion of scars and following clinicopathological features (patients’ 
age, tumour size, GCT type, lymphovascular invasion, tumour 
stage, germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS), peritumoral atrophy, 
and microlithiasis) were analysed.
Results: A total of 322 patients underwent radical inguinal orchi-
ectomy for GCT. Complete GCT regression was reported in 6 cases 
(1.86%). In 3 of these 6 cases, metastases of mixed GCT were pre-
sent, whereas GCNIS was diagnosed in 5 cases. Of a total of 316 
GCTs, those with partial/focal scars were diagnosed in 68 cases 
(21.52%). GCTs without scars were diagnosed in 248 (78.48%) 
cases. Statistical significance in the occurrence of scars in GCT 
was found in older patients (34.0±8.2 vs 31.0±8.0 without scar; 
p=0.001) and in the seminomatous GCTs in comparison with 
mixed GCTs (p=0.027). Other clinicopathological features were 
not statistically related to the focal presence of the scar.
Conclusion: Complete GCT regression is a rare event that occurs 
in GCTs and it is associated with the presence of metastasis and/or 
associated with the presence of GCNIS at the time of testicular sur-
gery. Partial/focal regression - scarring of GCT is not uncommon. 
The meaning of focal scars in GCTs is unknown, but in the present 
study, it looks like it does not have any significant clinical mean-
ing, namely to the lack of their association with the tumour stage.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression 
in urothelial carcinomas of the bladder
A. Nalwa*, A. B S, P. Elhence, J. Naresh Bharti, M. Rao, G. Ram 
Choudhary
*All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur, India
Background & objectives: HER2 is highly expressed in multiple 
malignancies and associated with patients’ prognosis, but its role in 
urothelial carcinomas remains elusive. To evaluate Her2 expression in 
urothelial non-muscle-invasive(NMIUC) and muscle-invasive bladder 
carcinomas(MIUC) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene ampli-
fication by insitu hybridization.
Methods: This study involved total of 89 cases (39 muscle-invasive 
urothelial carcinomas and 50 non-muscle-invasive urothelial carci-
nomas). Histopathological grading was done as per WHO 2022. All 
cases were subjected to IHC by HER2 and all equivocal (2+) cases 
were subjected to FISH using HER2/CEN17 dual colour probe. 
IHC and FISH analyses were scored per 2018 updated ASCO/CAP 
recommendations for breast carcinomas
Results: Her2 overexpression (3+) was seen in 11 of 50 NMIUC 
cases (22%) and 7 of 39 MIUC cases (17.9%). 3 cases of MIUC and 
2 of NMIUC showed equivocal (2+) positivity by IHC and were 
subjected to FISH analyses. None of these cases showed amplifi-
cation on the dual-probe assay. There was no association between 
gender of patients and HER2 protein expression. HER2 positivity 
was associated with a higher tumour grade irrespective of deep 
muscle invasion. No significant correlation between HER2 expres-
sion and lymph node status was found.
Conclusion: The present study shows overexpression of HE2 in 
high-grade urothelial carcinomas both muscle-invasive and non-
muscle-invasive urothelial carcinomas’ indicating it has the poten-
tial to become an ideal target for bladder cancer therapy. However,

more gene amplification studies are required to be done in the cases 
showing positive expression (3+) of HER2 for choosing potential 
candidates for HER2- targeted therapy.

Two cases of primary intratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma
I. Elouarith*, F. Zouaidia, A. Jahid, Z. Bernoussi, K. Znati
*Ibn Sina University Hospital Centre, Morocco
Background & objectives: Intratesticular Rhabdomyosarcoma is a 
rare malignant tumour showing skeletal muscle differentiation.
The importance of this paper is to emphasize the importance of 
macroscopic examination in confirming intratesticular location 
and to highlight the importance of Immunohistochemical study 
for the diagnosis.
Methods: 16 and 18 years old patients, with no medico-surgical 
or trauma history, consulted for painless scrotal mass gradually 
increasing in size. Scrotal ultrasound revealed, in both patients, 
suspect intratesticular mass. So, they underwent inguinal orchidec-
tomy. Pathology results were consistent with the diagnosis of intrat-
esticular embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma grade III of FNCLCC. 
Thereafter, the two patients received chemotherapy.
Results: Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant mesenchymal tumour 
showing skeletal muscle differentiation. Four types have been 
described in the 5th edition of WHO classifications of soft tissue 
and bone tumours. The most common histological subtype is 
Embryonnal-rhabdomyosarcoma. Primary intratesticular localization 
is very rare and must be differentiated from paratesticular locations. 
This distinction must be made during the per-operative period and 
while the macroscopic examination of the surgical specimen. The 
Immunohistochemical study is essential for diagnosis and to exclude 
other intratesticular spindle cell sarcomas and germ cell tumours. 
The optimal treatment is based on radical inguinal orchiectomy and 
adjuvant chemo­therapy. Tumour size, age, histological type and 
lymph node involvement are important risk factors.
Conclusion: Rhabdomyosarcoma is a highly aggressive neoplasm 
occurring frequently in children and young adults. Intra-testicular 
localization remains exceptional and very few cases have been 
reported in the literature. Diagnosis of ITRMS is based on 
anatomopathological examination. Surgery and chemotherapy 
remain the mainstay of treatment. Radiotherapy is useful for local 
recurrence and metastasis.

Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate in low-risk patients does 
not affect PSA failure and treatment decisions

M. Watanabe
*Pathology / Mie University Hospital, Japan
Background & objectives: Intraductal ductal carcinoma of the pros-
tate (IDCP) is an independent poor prognostic factor for prostate cancer 
(PC) and known to be associated with adverse features. However, its 
significance in low-risk patients is poorly understood and was inves-
tigated in this study.
Methods: 866 cases of radical prostatectomy were performed 
between 2012 and 2021, of which 116 cases were low-risk PC 
preoperatively according to the EAU guidelines. Of these, 112 
patients were enrolled, excluding 4 cases who received preopera-
tive hormone therapy. Evaluation factors were clinicopathological 
characteristics of patients, and PSA free survival. The evaluation 
of IDCP and various pathological factors followed WHO.
Results: Of 112 patients, 12 (10.7%) had IDCP. PSA failure 
was observed in 4 of 112 patients (IDCP-: 3, IDCP+: 1). There 
were no significant differences in age, PSA and PSAD between 
patients with and without IDCP (age: p=0.432, PSA: p=0.7, 
PSAD: p=0.84). The occurrence of extraprostatic extension (EPE) 
and radial margin (RM), factors influencing treatment decisions, 
also did not differ between the two groups (EPE: p=0.172, RM: 
p=0.171). PSA free survival with and without IDCP demonstrated 
no significant differences (log-rank test: p=0.475).
Conclusion: Low-risk patients were found to have a better prog-
nosis even when IDCP was detected in surgical specimens. In the 
low-risk group, IDCP may not affect PSA free survival. In addi-
tion, IDCP does not influence treatment decisions, as there is no 
difference in the incidence of EPE or RM with or without IDCP. 
These results also reaffirm the utility of active surveillance. The 
incidental finding of IDCP in low-risk patients is nothing to fear.

Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC): a single institution 
archive review of morphological variability in the light of the 
new WHO 2022 classification
T. André Sousa Oliveira*, O. Hes
*Department of Pathology - Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN, 
Portugal
Background & objectives: The diagnostic approach to PRCC has 
changed substantially following the release of the new WHO Classifi-
cation 2022 and the type 1 and 2 subtyping is no longer recommended. 
Herein, we map the variability of PRCC in a single institution archive.
Methods: We reviewed all reports of PRCC cases from a tertiary 
healthcare institution from a 10-year period [2012-2021], totalling 
616 cases. Morphologic parameters, TNM stage, WHO/ISUP nuclear 
grade, immunohistochemical profile, and molecular study results 
were re-evaluated according to new WHO criteria. If available, 
patient’s sex and age; tumour laterality, multifocality, size, presence 
of necrosis, and invasion of stage-defining structures were recorded.
Results: The most common subtype was PRCC NOS (39.9%), 
followed by classic PRCC (previously type 1) [35.9%], oncocytic 
(12.3%), biphasic squamoid (6.0%), mucin-producing (3.2%), solid 
(1.1%), reverse polarity (0.6%) and Warthin-like (0.8%). The mean 
patient age was 63 years and the male to female ratio was 2.6. 
Average tumour size was 49 mm. Overall, PRCC presented at an 
early stage in 79.3% of cases and out of the advanced stage cases, 
77.6% were classified as PRCC NOS. Cytokeratin 7 was consist-
ently expressed in most types, at times focally, with the exception 
of Oncocytic and NOS types which were negative in 29.4% and 
44.2% of cases, respectively.
Conclusion: PRCC remains a highly heterogeneous group of renal 
tumours that will benefit from further studies aimed at subclas-
sification and validation of clinical utility, as well as well-defined 
criteria. Just as important, PRCC’s variability makes it a common 
mimic of other renal cell carcinomas (RCC), namely molecularly 
defined RCC (FH- or SDH-deficient and ALK- or TFE3-rearranged 
RCC), collecting duct carcinoma, oncocytic renal neoplasms and 
mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma. Adequate immuno-
histochemical and/or molecular studies should resolve most diag-
nostic doubts.

Background & objectives: Complex renal cysts are a diagnostic chal-
lenge for radiologists and urologists. Bosniak classification uses imag-
ing features to establish the malignant potential of these lesions. Our 
objective is to describe the pathological findings of Bosniak III and 
IV cysts.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the Bosniak III and IV 
lesions that were surgically resected at our institution between 
2018 and 2021. Two genitourinary pathologists analysed the gross 
pictures and microscopic slides of the surgical specimens. We also 
searched our database to find the incidence of the different renal 
tumours in 2021 and compare it with the diagnosis of complex 
cysts.
Results: 27 lesions in 26 patients 14 males and 12 females, median 
age 60 years (41-77). Median size was 26 mm (12-70). 8(30%) were 
Bosniak III, 19(70%) Bosniak IV. 19 (70%) were malignant and 8 
(30%) benign lesions. 79% of Bosniak IV and 50% of Bosniak III 
were malignant. 7(26%) lesions were solid, 14(52%) solid-cystic 
and 6(22%) cystic. 86% (6/7) of the solid and 17 % (1/6) of the 
cystic nodules were malignant. When <20mm, malignant lesions 
were encapsulated (5/5). 42% (8/19) were papillary carcinomas 
while these carcinomas represent 17% of our renal tumours. Benign 
lesions were 3 cystic nephromas, 2 simple cysts, 1 haemangioma, 
1 pseudoinflammatory tumour and 1 oncocytoma.
Conclusion: Our results show a high incidence of papillary renal 
cell carcinoma in complex renal cysts compared to the incidence in 
overall malignant renal lesions. In lesions <20 mm the presence of 
a capsule is highly suspicious of malignancy. The Bosniak classifi-
cation is useful to determine the malignancy probability of complex 
renal cysts. However, it still has numerous pitfalls, so we’ll need 
more radio-pathological correlation studies in the future.

*Forces de Securité Interieure, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Somatic TP53 mutations are found in up to 
20% of patients with localised prostate cancer and have been associated 
to disease aggressiveness and progression. The aim of this study was 
to assess p53 overexpression in prostate carcinoma.
Methods: We have retrospectively collected 24cases of pros-
tate carcinoma diagnosed in our pathology department between 
2012-2022.We have evaluated the archival formalin-fixed, par-
affin-embedded cases to detect abnormal p53nuclear protein 
accumulation using immunohistochemistry. For each cases, 
we assessed the percentage of positive cells and the intensity 
of staining comparing with normal adjacent prostate tissue. A 
cut-off of 50% of positive tumour cells was considered for p53 
overexpression.
Results: Mean age of patients was 70years old. The gleason score 
was 6 in 4cases,7 in 9cases,8 in 4cases,9 in 4cases and 10 in one 
case. ISUP grade was 1 in 4 cases,2 in 5 cases,3 in 4 cases,4 in 
4cases and 5 in 5cases.Perineural invasion was described in 4 
cases. Positive staining for p53 was found in 19 cases, however in 
12 cases, less than 5% of cells were positive. Overexpression of 
p53 was found in 16,7. Gleason score was high (>=8) in 3 cases 
and ISUP grade was high (>=3) in 4cases. All patients with p53 
overexpression developed resistance to hormonal therapy and 2 
patients passed away because of distant metastasis.
Conclusion: In the present study, high protein p53 levels of expres-
sion was found in 16,7% and patients with p53 overexpression are 
more likely to develop hormone therapy resistance and poor out-
come. However, p53 could be a potential marker for target therapy 
in the future mainly.

tute of Oncology „Prof. Dr. Alexandru Trestioreanu", Bucharest, 
Romania
Background & objectives: The aim of the study was to study the 
potential of a selected panel of prostate tumour micro-environment 
markers to define molecular subgroups of prostate cancer and to predict 
progression of prostate cancer.
Methods: We included 60 cases (prostate adenocarcinoma, benign 
prostatic hyperplasia and atypical lesions). Cases of adenocarci-
noma showed a Gleason score ranging from 7 to 10, with a group 
grade of 3, 4 and 5. Three categories of immunohistochemically 
markers were used: for cancer activating fibroblasts (CAFs: CD34, 
Alpha SMA, Caveolin), vascular markers (CD31) and steroid hor-
mone receptor markers (AR, PR, ER).
Results: Hormone markers were expressed, to varying degrees, 
nuclear, epithelial and stromal cells, progesterone became nuclear 
positive only in stromal cells, while the expression of alpha SMA, 
Caveolin and CD 34 was quantified stromal, cytoplasmic and mem-
brane. Statistically significant results were obtained for CD31, 
CD34 and progesterone.
Conclusion: The research highlights a promising prognostic poten-
tial for some of the evaluated markers, with an important role in 
their subsequent validation as biomarkers, and in developing new 
therapies based on their stratification into risk groups.

Defining the most concordant basal and luminal urothelial 
markers using transcriptomic data
E. Olkhov-Mitsel, E. Slodkowska, Y.H. Yu, C. Sherman, M. 
Downes*
*Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Canada
Background & objectives: Transcriptome expression profiles allow 
for prognostically significant stratification of urothelial carcinomas 
into basal and luminal subtypes. In this study, we used NanoString 
mRNA data to correlate with CK20, GATA-3, CD44 and CK5/6 
immunohistochemistry to identify the most appropriate basal/luminal 
immunomarkers.
Methods: A triplicate core tissue microarray of muscle invasive 
urothelial carcinomas was stained with known luminal (GATA3, 
CK20) and basal (CK5/6, CD44) markers. A subset were profiled 
for signature luminal and basal genes using a 23-gene NanoString 
chip. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity 
for each stain was calculated using SPSS.
Results: 243 chemotherapy naïve cases were stained and 91 (37%) 
had transcriptomic profiling performed. Hierarchical clustering of 
the Nanostring data segregated cases into a luminal or basal cat-
egory. CD44 positivity was significantly higher in CK5/6 posi-
tive vs. negative cases (81.5% vs. 22.4%, p<0.001) and in basal 
vs luminal (89.8% vs. 43%, p< 0.001). CK20 positive cases were 
significantly more prevalent in GATA3 positive vs. negative cases 
(35.4% vs. 2.8%, p<0.001) as well as in luminal vs basal (35.2% 
vs. 0%, p < 0.001). There was a significant (p<0.001) correlation 
between the RNA expression levels and IHC measurements for 
S172

GATA3, CK5/6, CD44 and CK20 (AUC 0.951, 0.959, 0.871 and 
0.938, respectively).
Conclusion: All markers significantly correlated with the respec-
tive subtype assigned by transcriptomic analysis and with each 
other. For luminal carcinomas, the AUC for CK20 was lower 
(0.816, sensitivity/specificity: 67%/87%) than GATA3 (0.965, sen-
sitivity/specificity: 86%/96%). Similarly, CD44 had a lower AUC 
for basal carcinomas (0.617, sensitivity/specificity: 57%/69%) than 
CK5/6 (0.852, sensitivity/specificity: 91%/70%). While the markers 
may be complementary, CK5/6 and GATA-3 have the best AUC 
and should be considered as "first-line" in assigning a surrogate 
luminal or basal subtype.

Clinicopathologic assessment of MTAP status in muscle inva-
sive urothelial carcinoma
E. Olkhov-Mitsel, E. Slodkowska, M. Downes*
*Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Canada
Background & objectives: Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase 
(MTAP) deficiency correlates with 9p21 loss and susceptibility to 
antifolate therapy, is frequent in metastatic urothelial carcinoma, but 
underexplored in the primary muscle invasive setting. We determined 
MTAP status and associated clinicopathologic features in a cystectomy 
cohort.
Methods: A triplicate core tissue microarray with 302 muscle 
invasive carcinomas (T2= 50, T3=62, T4=90) was stained for 
MTAP (Abnova, clone 2G4). Staining was interpreted as nega-
tive when carcinoma was completely negative with appropri-
ate internal controls. MTAP status was correlated with patient 
data, molecular subtype, stage, underlying mutation status, prior 
therapy, overall (OS) and relapse free (RFS) survival using SPSS.
Results: MTAP loss occurred in 87/302 (28.8%). There was 
no correlation with T-stage, nodal status, patient sex or age. 
MTAP was retained in 99% of luminal genomically unstable 
subtype, 65% of basal subtype and 50% of luminal- Uro type 
carcinomas (p<0.001). MTAP loss was strongly correlated with 
FGFR3 mutations, and MTAP retention with TP53 mutations 
(p=0.0062). Cases with MTAP loss had shorter OS (14.7 months 
vs 23.3 months MTAP retained) and RFS (11.2 months vs 18.2 
months MTAP retained), p>0.05. Within the luminal-Uro group, 
loss of MTAP predicted for reduced RFS (p=0.031) but not OS. 
All analyses were also performed excluding cases with neoadju-
vant chemotherapy (n= 59) with similar results.
Conclusion: Loss of MTAP occurs in <30% of primary muscle 
invasive urothelial carcinomas. It does not associate with stage 
suggesting loss is acquired early in the disease. There were no 
statistically significant association with outcome parameters or 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy status. MTAP loss was associated with 
FGFR3 mutations. Within the luminal-Uro molecular subtype, 
MTAP loss defined a group with shorter RFS and assessment of 
MTAP may be most beneficial in this cohort.

Neuroendocrine carcinomas of the urinary bladder: a large 
case series of a rare entity

F. Sessa, S. Uccella
*Department of Medicine and Surgery, Unit of Pathology, Univer-
sity of Insubria, Varese, Italy
Background & objectives: Urinary bladder (UB) is the extra-pulmo-
nary and extra-digestive organ with the highest frequency of neuroen-
docrine neoplasms (NENs). The recognition of UB-NENs and their 
distinction from high grade non-neuroendocrine (HG nonNE) UB 
carcinomas represent a challenge in diagnostic practice.
Methods: With the aim of clarifying the clinicopathological 
features of UB-NENs and of establishing differential diagnostic 
criteria for their distinction from HG nonNE carcinomas, we ret-
rospectively reviewed a series of 78 cases collected from three 
Italian Institutions and originally diagnosed as UB-NENs or HG 
carcinomas with NE markers expression. The latest diagnostic 
criteria proposed for NENs by WHO/IARC were strictly applied.
Results: The histopathological review identified 51 UB-NENs, 
including 23 neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and 28 mixed 
neuroendocrine non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs). Pres-
ence of neuroendocrine morphology (architectural and cytologi-
cal), intense and diffuse expression of one/two neuroendocrine 
markers, and absence of urothelium-related markers were used 
to separate NECs from HG nonNE carcinomas. MiNENs were 
diagnosed when two separate components were morphologically 
identified and immunohistochemically confirmed. Small cell mor-
phology was more frequent than large cell one, both in pure and 
mixed neoplasms. PDL-1 expression was lower in UB-NENs than 
in HG nonNE carcinomas. Clinically, patients were old males with 
smoking habits; NECs showed poorer prognosis than HG nonNE 
carcinomas, significantly improved by treatment with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy.
Conclusion: With this study, we were able to identify true UB-
NENs and to distinguish them from HG nonNE carcinomas of the 
same site, clarifying the clinicopathological features of these rare 
entities. We highlight the prognostic impact of UB-NENs diagno-
sis, also when mixed with a nonNE component, which confers a 
very poor outcome to patients, improved by the administration of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Although very preliminary, data on 
PDL1 expression suggest a therapeutic chance with immune check-
point blockage also in these rare malignancies.

Retrospective report-based review of kidney biopsies and resec-
tions with a focus on oncocytoma

*Pathology, McMaster University, Canada
Background & objectives: Synoptic reporting combined with the 
automated categorization of free text reports (ACFTR) and patholo-
gist review allows insight to practice patterns. This project examined 
kidney biopsies for mass lesion and kidney resections, and matched 
specimens by an anonymized patient identifier (API).
Methods: All non-medical kidney biopsies with and without resec-
tions accessioned 2011-2020 were retrieved from one referral cen-
tre, matched by API and categorized by diagnosis and diagnostic 
group (DxGrp) (malignant (MAL)/suspicious (SUSP)/insufficient 
(INS)/benign (BEN)). All recent biopsy report categorizations were 
reviewed/classified by pathologists. APIs were categorized into 
biopsy only (BxOnly) and biopsy+surgery(Bx+Sx). Biopsies and 
surgeries were tabulated by the most recent pathology.
Results: The data set contained 948 patients; these were 641 
BxOnly and 307 Bx+Sx. BxOnly by DxGrp 374(MAL)/3(
SUSP)/58(INS)/206(BEN); Bx+Sx(by Sx diagnosis) was: 
293(MAL)/0(SUSP)/ 0(INS)/14(BEN). 84 patients had two biop-
sies, 9 had three and two had four; the INS rate for the preced-
ing biopsies was: 24.2%, 27.3% and 0%. Oncocytoma(ONC) was 
seen in 109/948 patients. Four patients had a prior ONC biopsy 
diagnosis linked to surgery; on resection: two were oncocytoma,

two were unclassified renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Four additional 
patients had incidental ONC on biopsy and biopsy-unrelated sur-
gery: surgery for contralateral RCC (1 patient), ONC biopsy after 
prior surgery for ONC (1 patient), ONC biopsies after surgery for 
RCC (2 patients).
Conclusion: The approach used allows a large amount of data to 
be analysed with limited effort. Oncocytoma on biopsy rarely goes 
to surgery in our environment. The findings support an approach 
that includes kidney biopsy for the management of renal masses, 
and allows selected patients to avoid surgery. Reliable pathologic 
classifications, combined with follow-up data, are essential for safe 
conservative patient management strategies.

Synaptophysin, CD117, and GATA3 as a diagnostic immuno-
histochemical panel for small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma 
of the urinary tract

Shin, H. Ju, S.U. Jeong
*Department of Pathology, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Republic 
of Korea
Background & objectives: Although the diagnosis of small cell neu-
roendocrine carcinoma (SCNEC) is based on its characteristic histol-
ogy, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is commonly employed to confirm 
neuroendocrine differentiation (NED). The challenge is that SCNEC 
may yield negative results for traditional neuroendocrine markers.
Methods: To establish an IHC panel that could detect even tradi-
tional marker-negative SCNEC of the urinary tract, 17 neuronal, 
basal, and luminal markers were examined on 47 SCNEC cases 
as a discovery cohort. A decision tree algorithm was employed to 
analyse the immunoreactivity. An external cohort of eight SCNEC 
cases and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to 
validate the model.
Results: Among the 17 markers, the decision tree diagnostic 
model selected 3 markers to classify NED with 98.4% accuracy. 
The extent of synaptophysin (>5%) was selected as the initial 
parameter, the extent of CD117 (> 20%) as the second, and then 
the intensity of GATA3 (negative or weak immunoreactivity) as the 
third for NED. The importance of each variable was 0.758, 0.213, 
and 0.029, respectively. In all cases with ≤5% of synaptophysin-
immunoreactive area in the discovery and external cohorts showed 
> 20% of CD117 expression and their NED status was confirmed 
by the demonstration of electron dense neurosecretory granules of 
the tumour cells by the TEM.
Conclusion: We propose a decision tree-based IHC model consist-
ing of two inclusion markers synaptophysin and CD117 and one 
exclusion marker GATA3 for the diagnosis of SCNEC of the uri-
nary tract. Since SCNEC is an aggressive tumour type and requires 
therapeutic approaches that differ from those used for urothelial 
carcinoma, an accurate diagnosis of SCNEC is critical and this 
model may help pathologists accurately diagnose SCNEC in daily 
practice.

Fletcher, M. Hirsch, J.L. Hornick, M. Snuderl, A.M. Acosta
*Brigham and Women’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School, USA
Background & objectives: A subset of male germ cell tumours 
(GCTs) with aggressive clinical behaviour shows overgrowth of com-
ponents resembling extra-testicular malignancies (e.g. sarcomas, carci-
nomas). The molecular mechanism of somatic-type tumour transforma-
tion in GCT is incompletely understood.
Methods: Following IRB approval, FFPE tumour material was 
retrieved from archives of participating institutions. Targeted NGS 
using a 447 gene panel was performed on 36 somatic-type malig-
nancies (SMs), 10 matched conventional GCTs, and 20 SYSTs. A 
subset of 9 SM cases underwent fusion panel RNA sequencing. 
DNA methylation profiling was performed on 9 SYSTs, 15 SMs 
and 10 matched conventional GCTs.
Results: The median age at SM diagnosis was 34 years. The 
most common histotypes of SM were sarcoma, ENT/PNET, and 
carcinoma in 61%, 28%, and 6% of cases, respectively. KRAS and 
TP53 mutations were each identified in 28% of SM cases. Evidence 
of i(12p) was seen in 89% of cases. 97% of cases showed complex 
copy number profiles. MDM2 amplifications were detected in 
15% of cases. Matched conventional GCTs and SMs harboured 
similar mutational and copy number profiles. Fusion panel RNA 
sequencing detected no oncogenic gene fusions. Irrespective of 
histotype, SMs had similar DNA methylation profiles that were 
different from profiles of matched conventional GCTs.
Conclusion: SMs in GCTs are molecularly unrelated to their true 
somatic counterparts. Instead, they are characterized by complex 
copy number profiles and mutations that are otherwise rare in GCT. 
Mutational profiles of SMs and matched conventional GCTs are 
almost identical. Different SM histotypes show similar mutational 
and DNA methylation profiles, indicating that identification of SM 
components of GCTs may be more important than precise sub-clas-
sification. DNA methylation profiling of additional tumour types 
(sarcomas, sarcomatoid/glandular YSTs, carcinomas) is ongoing.

*"Grigore T. Popa" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Romania
Background & objectives: TFF3 is a potential candidate for molecular 
prostate cancer subtyping, that could predict patients¢ clinical evolu-
tion. Our study focuses on TFF3 immunohistochemical expression in 
specific subsets of prostate adenocarcinoma defined by ERG/SPINK1 
status, correlated with clinico-pathological parameters and biochemi-
cal recurrence.
Methods: The study group comprised 105 radical prostatectomy 
samples, immunohistochemically investigated using anti-TFF3, 
anti-ERG and anti-SPINK1 antibodies. TFF3 was semi-quantita-
tively assessed as low and high. Four subgroups were character-
ized based on positive and negative ERG/SPINK1 profile. For 
each subset, relationships between TFF3 immuno-expression and 
age, Gleason score, Gleason grade, tumour stage, capsular, peri-
neural, lympho-vascular invasion, and biochemical recurrence 
were statistically analysed.
Results: In the predominant subset ERG+/SPINK1- (63 
cases/59.04%), TFF3 over-expression was statistically correlated 
with Gleason score (p=0.02), Gleason grade and tumoral stage 
(p=0.00001). All 12 cases in ERG-/SPINK1+ subset (11.42%) 
over-expressed TFF3, with less favourable features: younger age 
of onset (75% under 65 years), higher Gleason grade (83.33%, 
>3), invasive tumour profile (91.66% capsular and perineural 
invasion). High-expression TFF3 indicated shorter time to bio-
chemical recurrence in ERG-/SPINK1+ subset compared to low-
expression TFF3, and all other ERG/SPINK1 subsets. ERG-/

SPINK1- subset (30 cases/28.57%) presented no significant cor-
relation between low/high TFF3 expression, clinico-pathological 
parameters, and biochemical recurrence. ERG+/SPINK1+ subset 
included one case, with TFF3 over-expression; statistical analysis 
wasn’t applicable in this situation.
Conclusion: Currently, the classification of prostate cancer 
in distinct molecular subclasses is still a “hot” debatable issue 
with exploring potential in modern pathology and oncology. The 
immuno-expression profile of TFF3 differs in subsets of sporadic 
prostatic adenocarcinoma outlined by ERG/SPINK1 status, its 
over-expression indicating a more aggressive biological and clini-
cal behaviour. Further studies on bigger populations are required 
for a better understanding of the overlapping interactions between 
SPINK1, ERG and TFF3 in the progression and molecular stratifi-
cation of this malignancy.

Mitroi, S.T. Topliceanu, N. Dobrin, C. Stefanov, G.C. Cozaru
*CEDMOG “Ovidius” University of Constanta, Romania
Background & objectives: Researchers need a greater understanding 
of prostate intratumoral heterogeneity and the cellular architecture of 
normal and diseased tissues to develop better treatments and more 
accurately predict disease progression.
Methods: The study presents flow cytometry determinations on 
prostate biopsies recovered from patients with adenocarcinomas 
(PCa, n=25), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH, n=25) reported 
to controls (C, n=25) to evaluate the DNA content, cell apoptosis, 
and CD biomarkers (CD34 Alexa Fluor 488/ CD61-PE stain for 
mesenchymal, endothelial cell proliferation and CD42b-PE stain 
for platelets aggregation to tumoral cells and endothelium).
Results: The results showed that 68% of BPH cases and 88% of 
patients with PCa presented aneuploidy. Relationships between the 
development of PCa, BPH with adhesion, migration, and cell prolifera-
tion were observed by Pearson correlations between G0/G1 phase of 
cell cycle and CD34+CD61+ glycoproteins (r=-0.514; P<0.01), and 
CD42b+ cell population (r=-0.475; P<0.05), between G2/M phase 
of cell cycle and CD34+CD61+ glycoproteins (r=0.513; P<0.01), 
and CD42b+ cell population (r=0.446; P<0.05), between S phase and 
CD61+ cell population (r=-0.430; P<0.05).
Conclusion: Combining the benefits of advanced high throughput 
flow cytometry and live-cell analysis offers the potential to gain 
additional insights into the mechanisms of cancer progression. It 
is concluded that DNA flow cytometry has much to tell us about 
the natural history and biological behaviour of prostate cancer and 
along with CD biomarkers provides additional information about 
the prognosis of the disease.

Correlation of GATA3, CK5/6 and p16 expression and overall 
survival in muscle-invasive bladder cancer
R. Terlevic*, M. Ulamec, J. Murgić, G. Štimac, B. Krušlin
*Pula General Hospital, Croatia
Background & objectives: Muscle-invasive bladder cancer therapy 
choice could be influenced by the tumour molecular subtype. Currently 
well-defined subtypes are RNA based. Surrogate molecular subtypes 
based on immunohistochemistry are needed to make subtyping useful 
in routine work and facilitate future research.
Methods: A retrospective single centre series of 85 cases with 
localized disease was identified, and routine immunohistochem-
istry for GATA3, CK5/6 and p16 was performed on whole tissue 
blocks containing muscle-invasive disease. Surrogate molecular 
subtypes were defined. Patient information regarding treatment 
and survival was obtained from medical archives.
Results: The mean population age was 70 years (SD=8.7), and 73% were 
males. Conservative treatment (TUR with radiotherapy) was used in 45% of 
cases, while 47% underwent cystectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy. Only 
7% underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy or primary chemoradiotherapy. 
GATA3 and CK5/6 expression segregated cases into broad luminal and 
basal subtypes respectively, while p16 expression was used to subclassify 
luminal cases into luminal papillary and luminal unstable types. When sub-
typed this way, no difference in survival was observed overall and within 
therapy groups. GATA3 expression was strongly associated with better sur-
vival across all treatment groups, while CK5/6 was linked to worse survival. 
No effect of p16 on survival was observed.
Conclusion: No effect of p16 expression was observed on clinical 
outcome. When used together with GATA3 and CK5/6 in a 
combined immunohistochemical molecular subtype no difference 
in survival was observed. In our study GATA3 and CK5/6 
expression was found to be an indicator of respectively improved 
and worse survival both overall and within conservatively treated 
and cystectomised patients.

Dynamic sentinel node biopsies in penile cancer – the Edin-
burgh experience
R. Grigorescu*, M. O’Donnell
*NHS Lothian, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: The presence and extent of loco-regional 
lymph node metastasis is an important prognostic factor in penile can-
cer survival and therefore dynamic sentinel node biopsies of inguinal 
lymph nodes play an important role.
Methods: A retrospective review of all DSNB for penile cancer 
reported in our department over a 5-year period (2015-2019) was 
performed. This looked at initial diagnosis, reported macroscopic 
and histological features, use of immunohistochemistry and follow 
up including additional pathology. Locally all nodes are individually 
identified, serially sliced at 2 mm intervals and further ancillary tests 
done by request only.
Results: 67 cases were identified, with a total of 168 lymph nodes. 
Immunohistochemistry was performed in 11 cases. 14 nodes (7%) 
over 11 cases had metastatic tumour deposits. Two of these were 
micrometastasis (<2 mm) and both these patients had negative sub-
sequent lymph node dissections. In patients with non-micrometa-
static disease, there was an association of the size of the sentinel 
node deposit and the likelihood of further positive nodes in the node 
dissection.
In four of the cases with negative sentinel nodes initially, ipsilateral 
metastatic nodal disease was identified subsequently. These cases 
had further additional levels and cytokeratin immunohistochemis-
try performed but were true negatives.
Conclusion: Although our sample size is small, it raises the pos-
sibility that micrometatastic disease within DSNB may not be 
associated with further positive nodes in the node clearance and 
may benefit from further larger studies to see if clearance could be 
avoided for this subgroup of patients. We did not identify any false 
positive or false negative cases in our review.

Next generation intraoperative margin assessment in nerve 
sparing radical prostatectomy, confocal laser microscopy ver-
sus frozen sections

Zomer, G. van Leenders, J. van Basten, D. Somford
*CWZ Nijmegen, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Currently frozen section (NeuroSAFE) is 
the gold standard in intraoperative margin assessment at nerve spar-
ing radical prostatectomy (RP), but does have drawbacks. It is time-
consuming and laborious. Here we evaluate whether confocal laser 
microscopy (CLM) could replace NeuroSAFE.
Methods: 50 patients underwent a nerve sparing RP with intraopera-
tive margin assessment by NeuroSAFE. Concurrently the margins 
were assessed using CLM by imaging both posterolateral sides using 
the SamanTree Histolog Scanner. Secondary resection of the nerve 
bundle was performed when a positive margin was identified by fro-
zen section. Results were compared with final pathology.
Results: In total 14 out of 96 margins were positive in final pathology. 
4 margins were excluded based on macroscopic visible cauterization 
or neoadjuvant therapy. 1 positive margin was only seen in the final 
pathology. CLM identified 15 positive margins, 12 of which were seen 
in the final pathology, for the other 3 deeper levels were necessary to 
verify that tumour on ink was present. NeuroSAFE identified 14 posi-
tive margins, 1 of these was not present in the final pathology. 6 out 14 
secondary resections contained tumour, both intraoperative techniques 
identified these patients. CLM was significantly faster compared to 
NeuroSAFE (8 vs 50 minutes respectively, p<0.001).
Conclusion: This feasibility study demonstrates that surgical mar-
gin assessment by CLM at nerve sparing radical prostatectomy is 
a reliable method compared with the standard technique of intra-
operative frozen sections and offers logistical advantages. Both 
techniques were equally good in identifying those patients that 
benefitted from resection of the neurovascular bundles.

Rapid intraoperative surgical margin assessment in partial 
nephrectomy using confocal laser microscopy
W. Vreuls*, S. Wagenaar, D. Baas, J. van Basten, S. Dijkstra
*CWZ Nijmegen, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Various techniques have been studied in 
intraoperative margin assessment of partial tumour nephrectomies var-
ying from intraoperative ultrasound to frozen section. Here we present 
a series using a confocal laser microscope (CLM) to assess the surgical 
margins during robot-assisted partial nephrectomy.
Methods: Six patients underwent a partial nephrectomy. Peri-oper-
ative parameters were monitored. Once the tumour specimen was 
removed, it was examined by the pathologist in fresh state, making 
an assessment of the surgical margin using the Histolog Scanner by 
SamanTree Medical, Switzerland. The margin and/or the lamellae 
were scanned after immersion in a contrast agent. Results were 
compared with final pathology.
Results: A total of six tumour specimen from six individual 
patients were included. The cases contained a spectrum of diagno-
sis varying from angiomyolipoma (AML) to clear cell renal papil-
lary renal cell carcinoma. In two cases final pathology showed a 
positive surgical margin, which was visible on the CLM images. 
Staining time with the contrast agent and image acquisition time 
was two minutes. The diagnosis of AML was suggested based on 
the CLM images. Differentiating normal tissue from renal cell 
carcinoma was possible, but separating various types of renal cell 
carcinoma was not possible.
Conclusion: Intraoperative confocal imaging using confocal laser 
microscopy is a feasible modality for the assessment of surgical 
margins from resected kidney tissue during robot assisted partial 
nephrectomy. Assessment of the surgical margin is easily applica-
ble and fast. And potentially adds a diagnostic resolution to exist-
ing techniques such as intraoperative ultrasound or gross examina-
tion. Validation of the technique is necessary and its added value 
in clinical practice needs to be established.

ken, R.A. Lothe, K. Axcrona, R.I. Skotheim, U. Axcrona
*Oslo University Hospital & University of Oslo, Norway
Background & objectives: The molecular background contributing to 
the poorer prognosis of a cribriform pattern (invasive cribriform (ICC) 
and/or intraductal carcinoma (IDC-P)) in prostate cancer is still largely 
unexplored. Therefore, we aimed to identify molecular markers specific 
for a cribriform pattern.
Methods: Utilizing RNA-sequencing, we compared cribriform to 
non-cribriform Gleason pattern 4 (GP4; N=13), and genes with 
expression significantly associated with cribriform pattern were 
identified. Among these, ACSM1, GRIN3A, PCDHB2 and REG4 
were selected for validation in a larger cohort (N=85) using RT-
PCR. RNA in situ hybridization (RNAscope®) on tissue micro-
arrays (N=479) was used to assess gene expression related to 
histopathology.
Results: Ten genes were significantly upregulated and 144 genes 
downregulated in cribriform pattern samples. Of the selected 
upregulated genes (ACSM1, GRIN3A, PCDHB2 and REG4), only 
GRIN3A was significantly higher expressed in cribriform pattern 
samples when compared to non-cribriform GP4 samples in a 
larger cohort (p=0.005). In relation to histopathology, GRIN3A 
was more frequently identified in tissue cores with IDC-P (54%) 
followed by ICC (32%) and non-cribriform GP4 (29%) from 
tumours with a cribriform pattern compared to non-cribriform 
GP4 (20%) from tumours without any cribriform pattern (all 
p<0.01). GRIN3A was identified in benign tissue in 0.5% of 
samples.
Conclusion: In this relatively large prostate cancer patient series, 
GRIN3A was identified as an RNA-based biomarker for the pres-
ence of a cribriform pattern in prostate cancer and specifically a 
subtype of IDC-P. Furthermore, GRIN3A was idenitifed as a tumour 
marker, as it only rarely identified in benign tissue. Additional 
studies are needed to elucidate the functional role of GRIN3A in 
tumours with a cribriform pattern and whether it may be used in 
diagnostic setting.

way Regional Health Authority (grant numbers: 2019016 and

Background & objectives: There is inconsistent data on cytokeratin 
7 (CK7) immunostaining patterns in clear cell renal cell carcinomas 
(CC-RCC). The aim of this study was to assess the CK7 expression 
pattern of CC-RCC.
Methods: We analysed 30 cases of CC-RCC from our institution, 
diagnosed between 2014 and 2022. CK7 immunostaining was 
performed. The tumours were divided into low-grade CC-RCC 
(LGCC-RCC) (WHO/ISUP grade I and II) and high grade CC-
RCC (HGCC-RCC) (grade WHO/ISUP III and IV). Architectural 
pattern was also noted. The patterns of staining were divided into 
three groups: negative, focal and diffuse.
Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 62,5 years (33 - 83 
years-old). 22 cases (73,3%) were classified as LGCC-RCCs and 
8 cases (26,7%) as HGCC-RCCs. 14 cases (46.7%) showed CK7 
immunoreactivity, with 3 cases displaying a diffuse expression 
pattern and 11 cases with focal staining. 13 cases of the LGCC-
RCCs group (59,1%) and 1 case (12,5%) of the HGCC-RCC group 
showed expression of CK7. 10 out of 16 cases with macrocystic or 
microcystic architectures showed CK7 expression.
Conclusion: Our results showed that CK7 immunoreactivity in CC-
RCCs can have a variable pattern and extent of expression. LGCC-
RCCs revealed a higher rate of CK7 positivity regarding HGCC-RCCs, 
leading to a possible prognostic role of CK7 regarding these entities. 
Thus, the possibility of expression of CK7 by CC-RCC is an important 
characteristic that pathologists should keep in mind, particularly in the 
interpretation of small tissue samples.

Morphological characterization of chromophobe renal cell car-
cinoma: review of 30 cases
G. Miranda*, J. dos Santos, J. Correia-Pinto, J. Cunha, T. Amaro
*Unidade Local de Saúde de Matosinhos - HPH, Portugal
Background & objectives: Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma 
(ChRCC) is a renal neoplasm traditionally described by having sheets 
of large polygonal cells with pale to eosinophilic cytoplasm. The aim 
of this study was to document the histopathological features of ChRCC 
cases in our institution
Methods: We reviewed retrospectively the slides of cases diag-
nosed between 2014 to 2022. Immunohistochemistry for CK7, 
CD117 and CD15 were performed in all cases. 30 cases of ChRCC 
were identified from all 229 cases of renal neoplasms from our 
institution in this period.
Results: ChRCC represented 13% of all renal neoplasms. The 
mean age at diagnosis was 66.3 years old (47 – 87 years). 73.3 
% of the patients were men and 26.7% women. The histologi-
cal types were divided between solid sheet-like, tubulocystic 
and papillary patterns and the cytoplasm features were divided 
between pale cytoplasm versus eosinophilic cytoplasm. The 
architectural patterns were 18 cases (60%) of a predominant 
solid pattern, 11 cases (36.7%) with predominant tubulocystic 
areas, and 1 case (3.3%) with papillary architecture. 18 cases 
(60%) had abundant pale cytoplasm and 12 (40%) predominant 
eosinophilic cytoplasm. 56.7% had diffuse positivity for CK7, 
96.7% showed CD117 expression and only 13.3% had CD15 
focal positivity.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrated a similar distribution in age 
at diagnosis and gender in comparison to the existing literature, 
described the architectural diversity of this neoplasm and its 
immunohistochemical findings. To avoid misdiagnosis, this 
pathological heterogeneity of ChRCC is an important feature that 
pathologists should have in mind.

Quantitative, rules-based grading for noninvasive papillary 
urothelial carcinoma
D. Berman*, A. Slotman, K. Lindale, D. Winkowski, R. Baird, A. 
Simpson, R. Gooding
*Queen’s University, Canada
Background & objectives: Noninvasive papillary urothelial car-
cinoma (NPUC) places great burdens on patients and healthcare 
systems. Histopathologic grading for NPUC guides management, 
yet subjective criteria and poor reliability limit its value. Here we 
develop an accurate, quantitative, and explainable NPUC grading 
algorithm.
Methods: Clinical data including recurrence and progression were 
collected for 201 NPUC patients presenting from 2008-2016. Image 
analysis was performed on 641 H&E stained tissue microarray 
(TMA) cores harvested from their transurethral resections. 
Histologic features extracted using Visiopharm software were 
analysed individually and in combination using regression and 
decision tree models. Survival analysis for Kaplan-Meier curves 
were calculated with log-rank statistics.
Results: Whole slide grade and stage were significantly 
associated with recurrence-free survival. TMA-based nuclear 
morphometry, cellular organization and automated mitotic 
figure counts differentiated low- from high-grade NPUC. As a 
single variable, variation in (standard deviation of) nuclear area 
distinguished between high- and low-grade with 82% accuracy. 
Multivariate models combining nuclear size and shape-related 
variables with mitotic activity increased balanced accuracy to 
88%. To adapt these TMA-based findings to whole slide images, 
we are using deep learning to select and analyse hotspots that 
are enriched for high-grade features.
Conclusion: This work represents the first demonstration of 
explainable quantitative criteria for NPUC grading, and points to 
mitotic index and variation in nuclear size as key quantitative vari-
ables. Ongoing work will build a clinically-oriented user-friendly 
platform that works on whole slide images and optimizes the prog-
nostic value of NPUC grading.

Percutaneous renal biopsy of kidney tumours: what comes 
next?
D. João*, A. Sanches, A. Luis
*Centro Hospitalar Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal
Background & objectives: Kidney tumours are frequently both diag-
nosed and treated through partial or radical nephrectomy after imagio-
logical detection. Nevertheless, many are first approached by percuta-
neous needle biopsy. We aim to study and compare biopsy and surgical 
specimen diagnosis, grade and clinical outcomes.
Methods: We reviewed all cases of kidney tumour biopsy received 
in our department during the last 5 years (n=56). For each, we 
determined the biopsy diagnosis; the diagnosis in the nephrectomy 
specimens (if surgical treatment), patient management (surveil-
lance, cryotherapy, surgical treatment, systemic treatment or pal-
liative care), and clinical follow-up.
Results: In biopsy, clear cell renal cell carcinoma was the most 
frequent diagnosis (n=13;23%), followed by a differential diagnosis 
between oncocytoma and the eosinophilic variant of chromophobe 
renal cell carcinoma (n=7;13%). Regarding patient management, 
16 (29%) were submitted to cryotherapy, in 14 (25%) was opted 
surveillance, 6 (11%) received palliative care and 3 (5%) systemic

treatment. In those submitted to surgical resection (11;20%), final 
diagnosis was concordant with biopsy diagnosis in 8 (73%) cases; 
and in 3 (27%) cases, it was included in the biopsy differential 
diagnosis. ISUP grade was upgraded from 2 to 4 in one case. Sev-
enteen (30%) patients died, most (12;71%) from kidney cancer.
Conclusion: Kidney tumour biopsy is of paramount importance in 
patient management. Our series highlights the two main clinical 
settings leading to kidney tumour biopsy in our institution, with 
distinct diagnosis challenges – small tumours treated by cryto-
therapy or clinical follow-up, and aggressive tumours requiring 
histological subtype classification. It is also noteworthy the high 
concordance in the biopsy and surgical specimen diagnosis, as 
reported in the literature.

*Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Centre, Ljudevit Jurak 
Clinical Department of Pathology and Cytology, Zagreb, Croatia
Background & objectives: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most 
common malignancy and the fifth cause of death in male popula-
tion. However, non- invasive and specific biomarker for distinguish-
ing benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer is still not 
known.
Methods: Eighty tissue samples of patients (40 with PCa, 40 with 
BPH) were stained for HE and immunohistochemistry. Caveolin-1 
(CAV1) expression in BPH and PCa was scored according to stain-
ing intensity and percentage of positive cells. Degree of cfDNA 
methylation as a potential biomarker for PCa was estimated in 
semen samples by pyrosequencing. Results were considered sta-
tistically significant when p<0.05.
Results: Statistically significant higher cytoplasmic CAV1 staining 
intensity score and staining proportion were observed in BPH 
stroma compared to PCa stroma. There was no epithelial reaction 
in both groups. Staining score did not correlate with Gleason 
grade group, nor with tPSA. In case of semen samples, cfDNA 
methylation mean of the first five CpGs was higher in BHP group 
while methylation of other CpGs and average methylation was 
similar in both groups. BHP cfDNA methylation median of 8 CpGs 
and average methylation was similar, difference between groups 
was ≤ 1%. Statistically significant degree of hypermetilated cfDNA 
for CAV1 only in CpG1 was observed in BPH patients compared 
to PCa patients.
Conclusion: Caveolin-1 is a protein important for caveolae for-
mation in plasma membrane invaginations. It’s functions include 
regulation of cell differentiation, apoptosis, cell proliferation, 
migration, angiogenesis, senescence, endocytosis and interaction 
with signalling molecules. The expression of this protein signifi-
cantly differs in BPH and PCa tissue. As for cfDNA methylation, 
significant differences in DNA methylation of CpG1 between BPH 
and PCa were demonstrated. CAV1 is a potential non- invasive 
biomarker for distinguishing BPH and prostate cancer.

Low grade oncocytic renal tumour (LOT): clinicopathological 
characterization of 9 cases from a single cancer centre
B. Xu*, A. Fawaz
*Roswell Park Cancer Center, USA
Background & objectives: Oncocytic renal neoplasms are 
heterogeneous group of tumours that can pose diagnostic challenge. 
Recently, a subset of renal oncocytic neoplasms is described as LOT. In 
this study, we further investigate the histomorphological characteristics 
and clinical outcome of LOT, retrospectively.
Methods: Among 87 patients with low grade oncocytic renal neo-
plasms, 9 cases of LOT were identified from pathology archive 
between year 2005-2021. All cases were confirmed by immu-
nostains for CK7, CD117 and other relevant markers. The clin-
icopathological characteristics features and follow up data were 
investigated.
Results: Median age of patients is 83 years old with male to female 
ratio of 1:7. Grossly, the tumours are heterogeneous solid masses 
(2 with cystic changes). The median size of tumour is 2.65 cm. 
Histologically, tumours show solid compact nested, focal tubu-
lar or trabecular patterns. Tumour cells are monomorphic bland 
with eosinophilic cytoplasm and uniformly round nuclei. Tumour 
nuclear grade is WHO/ISUP grade 2. All cases show strong CK7 
positivity and negative for CD117, CAIX, CD10, AMACA and 
vimentin. All cases in our cohort demonstrate indolent behaviour 
and show no evidence of disease recurrence, progression or metas-
tases during the follow-up period up to 82 months (median 13.5 
months).
Conclusion: LOT is an emerging entity with incidence of 10% 
among low grade ORN. It has unique morphologic and immuno-
histochemical profiles that set them apart from oncocytoma and 
chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. LOT demonstrates indolent 
clinical behaviour. Future studies will be directed to understand 
molecular genetic profiles of LOT.

Implications of correlation between PBRM1 and PD-L1 expres-
sion in renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type
H. Hwang, G. Choe*, K.S. Lee
*Seoul National University College of Medicine, Republic of 
Korea
Background & objectives: Polybromo-1 (PBRM1) is the second most 
frequently altered gene after von Hippel-Lindau gene in clear cell renal 
cell carcinoma (ccRCC). PBRM1 alteration is reported as a significant 
barrier to immune checkpoint blockade response including anti-PD-
L1target therapy.
Methods: To identify the correlation between PBRM1 and PD-L1 
expression in ccRCC, we analysed the loss of PBRM1 (A301-
591A; dilution: 1:250, Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) 
expression and PD-L1 (22C3; pharmDx assay, Agilent, Santa 
Clara, CA) expression in a retrospective cohort of 526 surgically 
resected ccRCC in a single institute.
Results: Based on a cut-off of the combined positive score (CPS) 
≥1%, positive staining for PD-L1 was found in 139 (26.4%) cases. 
Loss of PBRM1 expression was observed in 205 (39.0%) cases. 
PD-L1 expression was positively associated with loss of PBRM1 
expression (P<0.001) in ccRCC. Notably, among the ccRCC cases 
which expressed the PD-L1, loss of PBRM1 was identified in more 
than 50% of cases. In addition, loss of PBRM1 expression showed 
correlations with aggressive clinicopathological features including 
higher ISUP/WHO grade, high pT stage, angiolymphatic invasion, 
venous invasion, and tumour necrosis (P<0.05). Kaplan–Meier 
analysis indicated that loss of PBRM1 expression and PD-L1 
expression was positively correlated with tumour recurrence.
Conclusion: In ccRCC, previous clinical trials reported that 
there is no significant correlation between PD-L1 expression and 
anti-PD-L1 therapeutic effect. Our study showed that the loss

1 3
of PBRM1 is significantly correlated with PD-L1 expression in 
ccRCC. This result can suggest that the PD-L1 blockade may not 
be effective even though the PD-L1 was expressed in ccRCC due 
to the interference of PBRM1 alteration.

Comparison of urinary cytology reported using the Paris Sys-
tem with follow-up biopsies: a single institutional experience
Y.K. Akgök*, G. Gümrükçü, M. Doğan, S. Kılar Kösemen
*Haydarpasa Numune Education and Research Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: The Paris System (TPS) provided stand-
ardized cytomorphological criteria and terminology for the recognition 
of high-grade urothelial malignancies. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the role of The Paris System by comparing urinary cytology 
with follow-up biopsies.
Methods: Urinary cytologies with follow-up biopsy up to 3 months 
from 2017 to 2021 were evaluated with TPS. The atypical urothe-
lial cells category was also evaluated as positive. Inadequate uri-
nary cytologies and samples submitted for decoy cell examination 
were excluded. Statistical analyses were performed by calculat-
ing sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, 
diagnostic accuracy, and risk of high-grade malignancy (ROHM).
Results: A total of 203 samples were evaluated. 82.3% of the cases 
were categorized as negative, 7.4% AUC, 1.5% suspicious for high-
grade urothelial carcinoma (SHGUC) and 8.9% high-grade urothelial 
carcinoma (HGUC). ROHM was 6.0% for the negative category, 40.0% 
for AUC, 100.0% for SHGUC, and 100.0% for HGUC. In the reporting 
of urinary cytology, the sensitivity of TPS was 72.0%, the specific-
ity was 94.6%, the positive predictive value was 75.0%, the negative 
predictive value was 93.6%, and the diagnostic accuracy was 90.6%.
Conclusion: TPS has high specificity and negative predictive value 
for detecting high grade urothelial lesions. We found that ROHM 
increases gradually from negative category to HGUC. And we 
think that TPS has an important role in the detecting of high-grade 
lesions and reporting urinary cytology.

Molecular characterization of the neuroendocrine variant of 
urothelial bladder carcinoma
R. Abou-Jaoudé*, J. Fontugne, N. Sirab, V. Dixon, C. Krucker, F. 
Radvanyi, Y. Allory
*Institut Curie, France
Background & objectives: Diagnosis of neuroendocrine (NE) bladder 
carcinoma (BC) remains challenging. Our aim was to compare consen-
sus molecular subtyping and new immunohistochemical markers in a 
series of cases with morphology suggesting NE differentiation.
Methods: BC tumours with morphology suggesting NE differen-
tiation were identified and stained using multiplex IHC (subtype 
markers CK5/6-GATA3), Ki67 and NE IHC markers (Chromogra-
nin A, Synaptophysin, INSM1, TUBB2B). In tumours with adja-
cent non-NE morphology, the IHC expression of each area was 
individually assessed. Transcriptomic profiling was performed 
using 3’RNA-seq to determine consensus molecular subtype, 
including multiple samples in heterogeneous cases.
Results: We included 14 patients (9 men and 5 women) with a 
median age of 75 years. Ten cases were associated with area(s) of 
non-NE morphology.
Twenty-eight samples from 14 patients underwent 3’RNA-
seq. Applying the consensus classifier, 9/14 cases (64.3%) 
had at least one neuroendocrine-like subtype area. Of the 6/9 
NE-like cases with multiple sequenced areas, 4 harboured 
distinct subtypes (Basal/Squamous, Luminal Unstable and/
or Stroma-rich).
NE-like tumours were characterized by negative or focal/weak 
CK5/6-GATA3 immunophenotype (quickscore <0.1 in 7/9). Six 
of 9 NE-like tumours showed INSM1 positivity, while non-NE-like 
tumours were all INSM1 negative. Further analysis of the other 
NE markers and their respective performance to identify NE-like 
subtype is ongoing.
Conclusion: Neuroendocrine bladder carcinoma is associated 
with intratumoral heterogeneity at the morphological, 
immunohistochemical and molecular levels. Preliminary results 
show that the majority of NE-like molecular subtype tumours 
are characterized by CK5/6-GATA3 double negative phenotype. 
Further analysis to determine the performance of NE markers 
(chromogranin A, synaptophysin, TUBB2B and INSM1) in 
identifying the aggressive NE-like consensus molecular subtype 
is ongoing.

tre+, Maastricht, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Diagnosing carcinoma in situ (CIS) of 
urothelium may be challenging. CK20, p53 and Ki-67 are common 
immunohistochemical markers to differentiate CIS from reactive epi-
thelial changes (REC). The value of AMACR is debatable. We evalu-
ated AMACR immunoreactivity in CIS and REC.
Methods: Twenty-two CIS and 33 REC cases from our institu-
tion were included. All specimens were stained for previously 
mentioned IHC. Immunoreactivity for CK20, Ki-67 and AMACR 
was assessed as negative (≤1/3 of urothelial thickness) or posi-
tive (>1/3). AMACR was additionally quantified as <5% or ≥5% 
expression of the urothelium. P53 was evaluated as wild-type or 
aberrant-type.
Results: CK20 was positive in all 22 CIS and in 8/33 REC 
cases, in accordance with the highest sensitivity of 100% and 
a specificity of 75.8%. In 10/22 CIS and in 6/33 REC cases 
p53 showed an aberrant pattern (sensitivity: 45.5%, specificity: 
81.8%). Ki-67 was positive in 22 CIS and in 6 REC cases (sen-
sitivity: 90.9%, specificity: 81.8%). The first scoring method 
showed that AMACR was positive in 16/22 CIS and negative 
in REC cases, leading to a sensitivity of 72.7% and the high-
est specificity of 100%. Seventeen of 22 CIS and 2 REC cases 
showed AMACR expression in ≥5% of the urothelium (sensitiv-
ity: 77.3%, specificity: 93.9%).
Conclusion: According to these results the biomarker panel 
of CK20, Ki-67, AMACR and p53 appears to be useful for 
diagnoses of CIS in challenging cases giving the sensitivity 
and specificity. Also both scoring criteria for AMACR showed 
good correlation and similar sensitivity and specificity com-
pared to each other and to the other IHC markers. Further study 
is necessary to evaluate the pitfalls and utility of AMACR in 
different settings.

*Department of Pathology, Albert Szent-Györgyi Medical School, 
University of Szeged, Hungary
Background & objectives: Eosinophilic/oncocytic renal neoplasms repre-
sent a heterogeneous group consisting of both well-known entities (onco-
cytoma and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma [chRCC]) and emerging/
provisional tumours (eosinophilic vacuolated tumour (EVT), eosinophilic, 
solid and cystic (ESC) RCC, and low-grade oncocytic tumour [LOT]).
Methods: In this multi-institutional study, 318 renal tumours 
signed out as oncocytomas (n=164) or chRCCs (n=154) were 
reevaluated and reclassified according to current concepts. The 
revision was supported by immunohistochemistry of CK7, CK20, 
CD10, CD117, SDHB, FH, MelanA, and HMB45. Clinical data 
and pathological characteristics were obtained from the original 
histological reports.
Results: The revision resulted in 140 oncocytoma, 139 chRCC, 
9 EVT, 8 LOT, 6 ESC RCC, 2 oncocytic papillary RCC, and 14 
eosinophilic RCC not otherwise specified cases. Twenty-four onco-
cytomas and 15 chRCCs were reclassified as other tumours. Ten 
chRCC tumours were built-up of purely eosinophilic cells. The ini-
tial diagnosis was mainly oncocytoma for the EVT, LOT, and ESC 
RCC cases (20/23). The EVT and ESC RCC were primarily seen in 
women, while LOT affected older men (median age: 75.5; range: 
51-83). The average tumour size for EVT, LOT, and ESC cases 
was 38.1 mm, 46.4 mm, and 38.2 mm, respectively. Progression 
and tumour-related death were registered exclusively in chRCC.
Conclusion: The diagnostic spectrum of eosinophilic renal 
tumours is evolving, and it may pose diagnostic difficulties. Cau-
tion should be raised when the diagnosis of oncocytoma is estab-
lished, because a significant number of the cases may refer to 
emerging/provisional tumours. In our study, the frequency of EVT, 
LOT, and ESC RCC tumours was 12.16% among the eosinophilic 
renal tumours. In addition, 14 cases were left without a specific 
diagnosis and remained unclassified, indicating further research.

Evaluation of risk scoring systems for predicting inguinal 
lymph nodal metastasis in penile squamous cell carcinoma
A. Shah*, S. Menon, A. Sali, G. Prakash, G. Bakshi, A. Joshi, M. 
Pal, V. Murthy, S. Desai
*Tata Memorial Centre, India
Background & objectives: Inguinal lymph nodal metastasis (ILNM) 
is the most important prognostic parameter in the outcomes of penile 
squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC). We compared two risk scoring sys-
tems to predict ILNM.
Methods: This is a retrospective study of 105 PSCC cases. Prog-
nostic index score(PIS) was calculated by summing different 
points assigned to the following histological parameters- histo-
logic grade(1-well,2-moderate,3-poor), anatomic level of deep-
est infiltration(1-lamina propria,2-corpus spongiosum,3-corpora 
cavernosa) and perineural invasion(PNI)(0-absent,1-present). In 
Histopathological risk score(HRS), pattern of tumour invasion(1-
bulbous,2-cords,3-single cell) was used instead of PNI, the rest of 
the two parameters being the same.
Results: ILNM was present in 50 cases. PIS & HRS had a statisti-
cally significant association with ILNM (p<0.001). The composite 
score for PIS ranged from 2 to 7 & 3 to 9 for HRS. ILNM was noted 
in ≥50% of tumours with a PIS score ≥ 5 and HRS score ≥ 6. None 
of the tumours with PIS score ≤3 & HRS score ≤5 had ILNM. The 
Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for PIS showed an 
area under the curve (AUC) of 0.751 (p<0.001 & CI-0.642-0.859) 
while for HRS, AUC= 0.737 (p<0.001 & CI-0.625-0.849), making 
them comparable in their utility to predict ILNM.
Conclusion: PIS and HRS risk scoring systems correlate with 
ILNM. The high-risk group of HRS (score ≥ 6) included all the 
cases with ILNM (100%) while PIS (score ≥5) had 90% cases. The 
risk scoring systems may aid in addressing the inguinal lymph node 
dissection in PSCC.

The association between varicocele in adolescence and tes-
ticular cancer in young adulthood
T. Neuman*, G. Verhovsky
*Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Centre, Jerusalem, Israel
Background & objectives: Elevated intrascrotal temperature has been 
suggested as a risk factor for testicular cancer. Varicocele was linked to 
increased intrascrotal temperature, but whether it is associated with tes-
ticular cancer is unclear. We aimed to to explore their potential association.
Methods: This nationwide, population-based, historical cohort 
study includes 1,521,661 Israeli male adolecents (mean age 17.5 
± 0.4 years), who were screened for varicocele as part of their 
medical assessment prior to compulsory military service dur-
ing the years 1967-2012. The diagnosis of testicular cancer was 
ascertained from linkage of records to the the Israeli National 
Cancer Registry. Logistic regression analysis was applied.
Results: In total, 53,210 adolescents were diagnosed with 
varicocele prior to military service. Of 1,988 (0.13% of the 
total cohort) men who were diagnosed with testicular cancer, 
54 (0.1%) had varicocele prior to military service and 1934 
were not exposed to the elevated intrascrotal temperature 
resulting from varicocele, p=0.314. The age at cancer diagnosis 
and the distribution of seminomas vs. non-seminomas did not 
differ significantly between those with and without varicocele 
in adolescence. Varicocele was also not associated with 
testicular cancer, in a multivariable analysis controlling for 
sociodemographic factors.
Conclusion: Varicocele in adolecents was not found to be associ-
ated with testicular cancer in young adults.

González-Peramato
*Hospital Universitario La Paz, Spain
Background & objectives: Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the bladder 
is a rare entity considered a divergent differentiation from urothelial 
carcinoma (UC) as it accounts for less than 0.6% of bladder tumours. 
Our objective is to study the characteristics of these tumours and their 
survival.
Methods: We performed a retrospective review of urothelial 
tumours with sarcomatoid component (SC) diagnosed in our centre 
from 2010 to March 2022. We collected data of age, sample type, 
S180

biopsy stage, tumour type, immunohistochemistry studies, TERT 
promoter status and percentage of SC. From the clinical history, 
we obtained data of appearance and location at cystoscopy and 
survival.
Results: We identified 20 patients with a mean age of 79 years, 
17 of them were diagnosed at transurethral resection (TUR). In 
cystoscopy 6 were located in the left lateral wall and 16 had a 
solid aspect. Thirteen patients had stage T2 in TUR. Cytokera-
tin was positive in all 20 cases. All the tumours that underwent 
TERT promoter were mutated (5 cases). Seven patients underwent 
cystectomy. Fourteen patients had mixed high-grade UC and SC 
(mean 63% of the tumour) and 6 patients had the entire sample 
with SC. Twelve patients died with a mean survival of 17 months. 
Five patients had previous radiotherapy with a mean of 13 years 
before diagnosis.
Conclusion: Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the bladder presents at 
an advanced age and has poor prognosis due to low survival. 
In our series, 70% SC had conventional urothelial carcinoma 
with sarcomatoid component, 65% were at least T2 at diag-
nosis. Cytokeratin was positive in all of our cases, and TERT 
promoter was mutated in the 5 cases studied. Of our patients, 
25% had previous radiotherapy and 75% died because of the 
disease. Our findings are similar to those previously described 
in the literature.

Gleason score before and after radical prostatectomy: a com-
parative study
V. Trivunović*, T. Lakic, M. Šunjević, N. Stanulović, M. Panjković
*Center for Pathology and Histology, University Clinical Center 
of Vojvodina, Novi Sad, Serbia
Background & objectives: The Gleason score (GS) places patients 
with prostate cancer in one of five categories (ISUP Grade Group). 
GS being the most important prognosis predictor, we investigated reli-
ability and factors influencing a core needle biopsy (CNB) in predicting 
operative sample GS.
Methods: Retrospective study was conducted at the Center for 
Pathology and Histology of the University Clinical Center of 
Vojvodina. Querying patients’ histories we identified 56 men who 
underwent CNB and radical prostatectomy (RP) at our institution 
in a two-year period (2018-2019). Preoperative and postoperative 
parameters were collected. Correlation and influence among the 
parameters were statistically analysed.
Results: Patients’ average age was 66.75±4.24 years. The most com-
mon tumour was GS 3+4 (ISUP GG 2) - 37.5%, pT2 stage (60%). GS 
was upgraded on RP material in 50% of patients. All patients with 
CNB GS 3+3 (25%) had a higher GS on RP material. For 18 patients 
(32%) the score remained unchanged, while 10 patients (17.8%) had 
a lower GS postoperatively. Linear regression showed that with every 
year of the patients’ age, GS and the number of positive biopsy samples 
increased (b=0.05, p=0.03; b=0.025, p=0.005 respectively). Spear-
man’s test showed low statistically significant correlation between CNB 
GS and RP GS (r=0,2900).
Conclusion: Accurate defining of GS is of utmost significance 
for appropriate treatment of prostate cancer especially in 
elderly patients whose GS and number of positive biopsies 
tend to be higher. CNB is a modestly reliable method for 
defining GS/ISUP GG of prostate cancer, considering high 
number of upgraded GS on postoperative material. Therefore, 
postoperative assessment of RP specimen is mandatory for 
confirming GS defined on CNB and possible adjustment of 
treatment method.

gaard, D. Berney
*Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rig-
shospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark
Background & objectives: Inaccurate pathology reporting may con-
tribute to the ambiguous results on histopathological features as pre-
dictors of relapse in patients with clinical stage I testicular germ cell 
cancer (TGCC). This study compares the primary pathology reports 
with those obtained by pathology review.
Methods: We reviewed all histopathological slides from 770 
patients who were diagnosed with stage 1 TGCC in Denmark 
between 2013 and 2018. We assessed tumour type, pathologic 
tumour (pT) stage according to the 8th edition of the AJCC TNM 
staging system, lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and invasion of 
stromal rete testis (RTI), hilar soft tissue (STI), epididymis, sper-
matic cord and tunica vaginalis.
Results: Following the pathology review, the tumour type 
was revised in 1% of the cases, including two spermatocytic 
tumours initially misclassified as pure seminomas. Overall, 
reporting of RTI was revised in 20% of the cases; of those 
initially called absent 24% were changed to present, and of 
those initially called present 11% were changed to absent. 
The reporting of LVI was revised in 16% of the cases. There 
was a discrepancy rate of 13% regarding the reporting of 
STI. The pathologic stage was revised in 23% of cases, 
mostly owing to the revised variables of LVI and STI in 
these cases. Epididymis status was revised in 3% of the 
cases.
Conclusion: Inaccurate histopathological interpretation of TGCC 
specimens is not uncommon and may lead to incorrect tumour 
classification and pathological staging. This study highlights 
significant reporting variability on histopathological features 
in testicular tumours. Therefore, the decision to give adjuvant 
therapy in clinical stage I TGCC patients based on the findings of 
decentralized pathologic assessment is problematic. Centralized 
pathology review is deemed necessary if the true prognostic value 
of histopathological features is to be determined.

Prostatic calculi supress the expression of VEGF in the prostate 
cancer
A. Piddubnyi*, R. Moskalenko
*Sumy State University, Dept. of Pathology, Sumy, Ukraine
Background & objectives: Prostatic calculi (PCa) are associated with 
the development of prostate cancer (PC) bone metastases. Nevertheless, 
their effect on angiogenesis remains unclear.
Objective:To study the effect of prostate calculi on the expression 
of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF).
Methods: For this study, we used 60 PC samples (30 PC samples 
with PCa and 30 samples without biomineralization). Initially, all 
samples were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Immunohistochem-
istry was performed with antibodies against VEGF. Data sets were 
analysed by the Shapiro-Wilk test and Mann-Whitney’s U-test.
Results: The presence of PCa in cancer tissue was associated with 
tissue damage, oedema, epithelium desquamation, inflammation 
and foci of necrosis. We detected significantly (p < 0.05) lower 
expression of VEGF by PC tissue with biomineralization. This 
provided evidences that PCa do not cause the intensification of

vascularization in the neoplastic tissue. It means that the angiogen-
esis in the PC tissue is not dependent and related to the presence 
of intraluminal concretions.
Conclusion: PCa causes mechanical injury of PC tissue and is associ-
ated with tissue remodelling and inflammation. At the same time, the 
VEGF expression by PC cells is lower in patients with PCa.

G.K. Koukoulis
*Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health 
Sciences, University of Thessaly, Greece
Background & objectives: PTOV1 (prostate tumour overexpressed-1) 
was suggested as one of the most discriminants between normal and 
carcinomatous prostate, however, little has been investigated by 
immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. We examined PTOV1 in normal, 
adenocarcinomas and high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia 
(HPIN).
Methods: We examined, using IHC analysis, PTOV1 (cytoplas-
mic or nuclear), AMACR/P504S (cytoplasmic), and high-molec-
ular-weight cytokeratin 34bE12, in 68 prostate acinar adenocar-
cinomas. Gleason combined score (2014 ISUP revised Gleason 
grading system) ranged from 6 to 9 in 41 radical prostatectomy 
and 27 needle biopsy specimens. HPIN coexisted in 31/41 cases 
from radical prostatectomies and in 20/27 cases from needle 
biopsies.
Results: Almost all the cases of adenocarcinoma (100% in cases 
from radical prostatectomies and 92.69% from needle core biop-
sies) and HPIN lesions (96.77% from radical prostatectomies and 
100% from needle core biopsies) showed PTOV-1 moderate and 
strong cytoplasmic staining.
There was no obvious association between carcinoma differen-
tiation (by Gleason score) and the level of PTOV-1 expression. 
PTOV-1 was negative or showed weak cytoplasmic staining in 
normal prostate glandular epithelial cells in cases obtained from 
cystoprostatectomy specimens for bladder tumours without prostate 
cancer. A significant correlation was found between moderate and 
strong PTOV-1 staining versus moderate and strong P504S stain-
ing (p <0.001).
Conclusion: Our results indicate that PTOV-1 is a highly specific 
immunohistochemical marker for prostate malignancy.
PTOV-1 is a more sensitive immunohistochemical marker than 
P504S, for the diagnosis of HPIN.
The overexpression of PTOV-1 in isolated HPIN lesions in a pros-
tate needle biopsy without concomitant cancer, could generate 
suspicion of undiagnosed cancer and indicate the need to repeat 
the biopsy.

S. Kiremitci, D. Enneli
*Ankara University Medical School, Pathology Department, 
Turkey
Background & objectives: Seminal vesicle invasion(SVI) is a well-
known prognostic factor in prostate cancer(PCa). Although few studies 
focused on ductus deferens invasion(DDI), it’s prognostic contribution 
has not been clarified yet. We aimed to investigate the clinicopathologi-
cal impact of DDI on PCa with SVI(pT3b).
Methods: Among 1259 radical prostatectomy(RP) specimens with 
PCa diagnosed at our institution between 2005-2022, all pT3b-
PCa with DDI(n=43), and random pT3b-PCA without DDI(n=28) 
cases were included. Clinicopathological features (tumour vol-
ume, Gleason scores, ISUP-prognostic grades, positive surgical 
margins(PSM), extraprostatic-extension(EPE), intraductal carci-
noma, lymphovascular/perineural invasion(LVI/PNI), lymph node 
metastasis(LNM), biochemical recurrence(BCR), time-to-BCR) 
were compared between two groups. Pearson chi-square, McNemar, 
Fischer’s exact tests were performed.
Results: Among 1259 RPs with PCa, 46 cases(3.6%) had DDI, 
136 cases(10.8%) had SVI, and 43 cases(3.4%) had both. Among 
71 cases included in the study, 31 cases(43.6%) had BCR and 
median time to BCR was 117 months. Twenty-two cases(31%) had 
unilateral SVI. In 17(39.5%) cases DDI was unilateral, 26(60.4%) 
cases showed bilateral DDI. Two cases with unilateral DDI, showed 
contralateral SVI. Cases with bilateral SVI, showed higher rate of 
bilateral DDI (p=0.021). Cases with DDI, showed more EPE and 
PSM (p=0.021, p=0.02). In terms of BCR, time-to-BCR, LVI, PNI, 
LNM, Gleason scores, ISUP-prognostic grades, tumour volume, 
intraductal carcinoma, no statistical difference found between 
pT3b-PCa cases with and without DDI.
Conclusion: SVI is associated with adverse outcome for PCa. 
However prognostic significance of DDI is still controversial 
as there are a few studies focusing on DDI. To our results, DDI 
doesn’t seem to be associated with BCR. However further analysis 
will be performed by adding cancer-specific survival analysis, as 
it’s a better indicator for oncological outcome. Moreover, signifi-
cantly frequent occurrence of EPE in the PCa with DDI suggests 
that the most common route of SVI is most probably EPE of PCa.

Automated prostate cancer identification facilitates prognosis 
marker assessment in 11’845 prostate cancers using artificial 
intelligence and BLEACH&STAIN multiplex fluorescence 
immunohistochemistry

*University Medical Center Hamburg, Germany
Background & objectives: Although most prostate cancers behave 
in an indolent manner, a small proportion is highly aggressive. To 
evaluate the patient’s risk, several prognosis parameters, that can be 
accompanied by a high interobserver variability has been established. 
A reproducible prognostic evaluation is lacking.
Methods: To enable automated prognosis marker quantification, 
we have developed and validated a framework for automated 
prostate cancer detection that comprises three different artificial 
intelligence analysis steps and an algorithm for cell-distance 
analysis of BLEACH&STAIN immunohistochemistry. We have 
used the analysis framework to measure PSA, PSMA, INSM1, AR, 
Ki-67, CD56, Chromogranin A, Synaptophysin, CD8 in a cohort 
of 11’845 prostate cancers.
Results: The Ki-67 labelling index provided the strongest prognos-
tic information among all analysed prognosis marker in 11’845 suc-
cessfully analysed prostate cancers (p<0.001 each). The combined 
analysis of the Ki67-LI and Gleason grades obtained on identical 
tissue spots showed that the Ki67-LI added significant additional 
prognostic information in case of classical ISUP grades (AUC:0.82 
[p=0.002]) and quantitative Gleason grades (AUC:0.83 [p=0.018]). 
Several combinations of these 8 prognosis markers were combined 
to prognosis scores and used for unsupervised clustering to identify

a proportion of prostate cancers with a particularly poor prognosis 
(p<0.001 each).
Conclusion: Automated prostate cancer identification enables fully 
automated prognosis marker assessment in routine clinical practice 
using deep learning and BLEACH&STAIN mfIHC.

Genetics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic
Background & objectives: Clear cell carcinoma is the most common 
type of renal malignancy, accounting for over 70%of all renal carcino-
mas. Tumours can arise in any area of the renal cortex, with the dele-
tion of the 3p chromosome being a common chromosomal aberration.
Methods: This study comprised 266 patients with confirmed clear 
cell renal carcinoma, using data collected from two medical facili-
ties (University Hospital Ostrava, CGB Laboratory) between 2000 
and 2020. After that, parameters such as gender, age, and location 
were examined. All of the statistics were collected in March 2022, 
over the course of three weeks of rigorous work.
Results: There were 167 males (62.8%) and 99 women (37.2%) 
among the 266 patients, with a mean age of 64.2 years (median 
65). The tumour spread through the lymphatic system to the 
lymph nodes was seen in 13.4%. Hematogenous metastases, on 
the other hand, predominated, with the following examples: 
lungs 59 (19.8%), bones 37 (12.4%), spine 24 (9,02%), adrenal 
glands 26 (8.7%), skin 13 (4.4%), peritoneum 12 (4%), fallopian 
tube and brain 9 (both 3%), vagina and liver 8 (both 2.7%), 
breast and mediastinum 7 (2.3%), pancreas and small intestine 
6 (2.3%). Bronchus, parotid, thyroid, and stomach are among 
the most uncommon and underrepresented sites of metastasis, 
according to the study.
Conclusion: The goal of this statistical research is to show that 
clear cell renal carcinoma can spread hematogenously. When 
we consider the vascular system’s architecture, we can see that 
the most common locations of metastases (lungs, spine, and 
adrenal glands) are all extremely close to the kidney basin, 
putting these structures at a higher risk of metastatic clear 
cell carcinoma.

*Department of Pathology, La Rabta Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The fusion of transmembrane protease 
serine 2 with E26 transformation-specific family genes, particularly 
ERG, is the most widespread genetic alteration in prostatic adeno-
carcinoma. In this study,we investigated the ERG overexpression in 
prostate adenocarcinoma and its association with pathological prog-
nostic parameters.
Methods: The study was conducted at Rabta hospital incorporat-
ing 25 specimens of radical prostatectomies sent to histopathol-
ogy department. Different pathological findings were re-evaluated 
by reviewing histopathologic slides. ERG immunohistochemistry 
was performed using ERG antibody (clone EPR3864). Compara-
tive analysis was done for ERG(+) and ERG(-) groups based on 
age ;WHO grade group; perineural invasion; vascular invasion; 
extraprostatic extension; pTNM classification 8th edition.
Results: ERG expression was positive in 32%(8 cases) and nega-
tive in 68%(17 cases). In ERG(-) group, mean age was 64.7 years. 
Perineural invasion was seen in 11 cases. Lymphovascular invasion, 
extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion were noted in 
6, 7, and 2 cases respectively.10 cases were pT2 stage and 6 cases 
were pT3 with significant association to WHO grade group 2. In 
ERG(+) group, mean age was 66.4 years, showing perineural inva-
sion in 7 cases, Lymphovascular invasion in 2 cases, extraprostatic 
extension and seminal vesicle invasion in 7 cases. Tumours were 
staged pT2 in 4 cases and pT3 in 4 cases. WHO grade group 1 was 
seen in 5 cases.
Conclusion: The ERG overexpression seems to be an early molecu-
lar event harbouring in prostatic adenocarcinoma with lower WHO 
grade group in patients older than 66 years.

Chelly, H. Azouz, K. Bellil, S. Haouet
*Department of Pathology, La Rabta Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Urothelial carcinomas are characterized 
by Distinct molecular subtypes with different evolutive and therapeutic 
features. this study aimed to analyse the expression of the antibodies 
anti-CD44;anti-GATA3; anti-CK5/6;anti-CK20 and anti-FGFR3 in 
the urothelial bladder carcinomas and to classify them into molecular 
subtypes.
Methods: This was a retrospective study of 36 cases of urothelial 
bladder carcinoma. The immunohistochemical analysis was carried 
out using the antibodies anti-CK5/6,anti-CD44,anti-CK20,anti-
GATA3 and anti-FGFR3. Subsequently, the tumours were clas-
sified into luminal or basal subtype depending in the immuno-
histochemical profile. The expression of these antibodies and the 
molecular subtypes were analysed according to epidemiological 
and prognostic factors of urothelial bladder carcinoma.
Results: The average age was 61.24 years. Tumours were unifo-
cal in 75%, low grade in 44% and high grade in 56% of cases. 
These tumours infiltrated the vesical muscle in 36% of cases. The 
tumours expressed CK5/6 in 17%, CD44 in 20%, CK20 in 42%, 
GATA3 in 86% and FGFR3 in 70% of cases. 88% of cases were 
classified into luminal subtype and 12% into basal subtype. The 
expression of CD44 was correlated with the grade while CK20 was 
associated with tumour localization. The expression of FGFR3 was 
associated with the grade and the infiltration of the lamina propria. 
The molecular subtype was correlated with the infiltration of the 
bladder muscle.
Conclusion: The molecular classification of urothelial bladder car-
cinomas appears to be the future of the pathology of the bladder. 
However, microscopic analysis still play an important part in rapid 
diagnosis but a comparison of these two molecular and histologic 
aspects is crucial.

Background & objectives: The plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma 
(PUC) of the bladder is a rare and aggressive subtype of urothelial 
carcinoma (UC) with de­layed presentation, infiltrative spread, and poor 
prognosis. In this study, we report clinicopathological and prognosis 
outcomes on patients with bladder PUC.
Methods: 14 cases with pathologically proven PUC were identified 
among 566 bladder UC between 2001 and 2021. Archived 
H&E-stained slides were reviewed for pathologic analysis, 
including histologic features, tumour grade, association with 
UC, lymphovascular invasion, metastasis to lymph nodes and 
other organs, and cancer TNM stage. Clinical data, including age, 
clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes were retrieved from 
patients medical records.
Results: 2.47% of invasive UC of the urinary bladder show plas-
mocytoid phenotype. Mean age was 68 years. 80% of patients pre-
sented with haematuria. All 14 patients underwent cystoprosta-
tectomy with urinary diversion. Histologically, all tumours were 
high grade carcinomas. Pure plasmacytoid features were seen in 
4 cases, while in the others 10 cases, the plasmacytoid phenotype 
was mixed with conventional UC. Lymphovascular invasion and 
metastasis to lymph nodes were seen in 71.42% and 64.28% of 
cases respectively. 57.14% Cases were PT2 stage, 28.57% cases 
were PT3 stage and 14.28% cases were PT4 stage. The 3 year sur-
vival rate was ranged from 64.2% without locoregional recurrence 
to 57.1% without distant recurrence.
Conclusion: Accurate identification of UC histological subtypes 
is an important part of risk stratification,as these variants exhibit 
malignant biological characteristics. Bladder PUC presents a dis-
tinctive clinicopathological outcome represented by high aggres-
siveness and poor survival rate.

*University Hospital Magdeburg, Germany
Background & objectives: Keratins (CK) and desmosomal proteins 
like desmoglein (DSG) and desmocollin (DSC) have diagnostic and 
prognostic value in many tumour entities. We investigated their prog-
nostic value in primary tumour (PT) and matched lymph node metas-
tases (LNM) from muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).
Methods: Tissue micro arrays (TMA) were generated for PT and 
corresponding LNM. Samples were immunohistochemical stained 
for keratins (CK8, CK18, CK7, CK19, CK20, CK10, CK13, CK5, 
CK14, CK17) and desmosomal proteins (DSG3, DSC3, DSG2). 
Evaluation was done using the H-Score and correlation between 
PT and LMN followed by survival analysis using Cox proportional-
hazard model.
Results: The study cohort consisted of 232 cases of which 66 
cases (28%) had LNM. We noted significant (p<0.05) and positive 
(r>0,60) correlations in the expression of CK7, CK8, CK19 ,CK20 
and CK5 in PT and LMN. In the multivariable Cox regression 
analysis, we found that CK10 levels in PT were independently 
associated with worse outcomes – hazard ratio (HR) 1.08 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.13) for overall survival (OS) and 
HR 1.12 (95%CI:1.05-1.18) for relapse-free survival (RFS).
Conclusion: Our results of a two-centre cohort show that the 
immunohistochemical expressions of CK and desmosomal protein 
have different concordance in PT and matched LMN in MIBC. 
While the simple and luminal proteins, respectively, tend to show 
correlative expression, basal proteins like CK10, DSG3, DSC3 
(except CK5) had no or little correlation in their expression pat-
tern of PT and LMN. A high CK10 expression in PT is significantly 
associated with worse outcomes, both RFS and OS.

Background & objectives: Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway affects 
embryological cell migration, morphogenesis, gonadal formation, and 
sexual differentiation. SHH signalling is activated in many aspects of 
cancerogenesis, including the biology of paediatric germ cell tumours 
(GCTs)- a heterogeneous group of neoplasms.
Methods: 98 GCTs (46 girls, 52 boys; 1m-18yrs) examined: 7 
embryonal carcinomas (EC), 19 seminomatous tumours (SEM), 
18 yolk sac tumours (YOL), 33 immature teratomas, 6 mature 
teratomas, 15 mixed-type tumours. The clinical presentation, 
tumour localization, stage varied. SHH pathway elements: SHH, 
PTCH-1, SMO, SUFU, GLI-1, GLI-2, GLI-3 were evaluated 
immunohistochemically on FFPE sections (TMAs, full sections) 
with own semi-quantitative scale.
Results: In immunohistochemical analysis EC, SEM, YOL tumours 
(homogenous cases and components of mixed tumours) were strongly 
positive for GLI-1 (nuclear), SHH (membranous and cytoplasmic), and 
PTCH-1 (nuclear). In parallel, GLI-2 (nuclear) and SUFU (nuclear) 
were varied in expression, while GLI-3 (nuclear) and SMO (cytoplas-
mic and nuclear) were mostly negative/ weak. Protein expression in 
teratomas was variable in intensity and localization, dependent on con-
stituent tissue type, with heterogeneous presentation between tumours 
and even individual slides. Primitive neuroectoderm revealed high SHH 
expression. The stroma of GCTs was also positive for pathway proteins 
in the majority of cases, although rarely showed full concordance to 
the staining of tumour cells.
Conclusion: GCTs show heterogeneous SHH pathway proteins tis-
sue expression, related to their histological type. SHH expression 
in tumour cells and tumour stroma suggests its auto- and paracrine 
role in their biology. No significant difference was found between 
protein expression in monomorphic tumours and corresponding 
components in mixed tumours.

Background & objectives: PI3K/Akt pathway in renal cell carcinoma 
progression, metastasis, resistance to therapies has not been investi-
gated clearly. TFE3 expression is related to worse prognosis in renal 
cell carcinoma in several studies. We tried to find relation between 
TFE3 and PI3K/Akt pathway.
Methods: Human renal cell carcinoma cell lines UOK146, Caki-
1, and Caki-2 were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% 
foetal bovine serum. TFE3 down regulation was done by small 
interfering RNA transient transfection in UOK 146 cells. TFE3 
overexpression was don by transient transfection in Caki-1 and 
Caki-2 cells. Western blot analysis was done for TFE3 and phos-
pho-Akt, and Akt.
Results: The PI3K/Akt signalling pathway serves an important 
role in renal cell carcinoma for the regulation of cell proliferation, 
differentiation and survival. When TFE3 was down regulated with 
TFE3 specific siRNA, phospho Akt was decreased, significantly 
(p<0.001). When TFE3 was upregulated with TFE3 transfection, 
phosphor Akt was increased, significantly (p<0.001).
Conclusion: TFE3 was related with PI3K/ AKT pathway in renal 
cell carcinoma. Our result suggest an important role for PI3K/Akt 
inhibitors as a potentially useful treatment for patients with renal 
cell carcinoma.

Background & objectives: EIF1AX, on X chromosome (Xp22.12) 
encodes an essential eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF1A). 
EIF1AX mutations are RAS-like genetic changes found in a minority of 
thyroid nodules. Little is known about their prevalence and correlation 
with thyroid pathology in Europe.
Methods: Between February 2019 and December 2021 we 
analysed 1095 samples (709 cytology and 386 FFPE histology 
specimens) using a NGS panel including 330 genomic regions 
and comprising EIF1AX (exons 1, 2, and chrX intronic region 
g.20148634–20148745).
Results: Amplifiable DNA was obtained in 1029 of 1095 samples 
(cytology: 654/709, 92.24%; FFPE histology 375/386, 97.15%). 
EIF1AX mutations were found in 15/1029 cases (1.46%). Mutated 
cytology specimens: 1/48 (2.08%) BETHESDA-I (histology: 
hyperplastic nodule); 2/125 (1.60%) BETHESDA-II (histology: 
one follicular adenoma, one hyperplastic nodule); 4/234 (1.71%) 
BETHESDA-III (all without histology follow-up); 1/100 (1.00%) 
BETHESDA-IV (histology: hyperplastic nodule); 1/61 (1.64%) 
BETHESDA-VI (histology: undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma; 
PIK3CA and TERT promoter were also mutated). Mutated histol-
ogy specimens: 1/38 (2.63%) hyperplastic nodules; 5/79 (6.33%) 
follicular adenomas. In addition to the undifferentiated carcinoma, 
EIF1AX mutations co-existed with additional mutations (NRAS-
p.Q61R: two cases; HRAS-p.Q61K, GNAS-p.A201H, TSHR-p.
F631L: one case each) in 5/1029 (0.48%) cases, all with benign 
diagnoses.
Conclusion: EIF1AX mutations are RAS-like alterations found in 
benign follicular-patterned thyroid nodules (hyperplastic nodules 
and follicular adenomas) where, in a small minority of cases, 
they may co-exist with other RAS-like mutations. No EIF1AX 
mutations were found in 172 papillary, 14 follicular, 12 oncocytic, 
10 medullary carcinomas. The only malignant tumour with 
EIF1AX mutation in the series was an undifferentiated carcinoma 
with co-mutated highly pathogenic alterations (PIK3CA and 
TERT promoter). Isolated EIF1AX mutations are not a marker of 
malignancy in thyroid nodules.

First steps in molecular classification in endometrial carci-
noma: experience in a low income country

Azaiez, M. Hechiche, M. Kharrat, K. Mrad, L. Charfi
*Salah Azaiz Institute of Cancer, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The Cancer Genome Atlas (CGA) catego-
rized endometrial cancer into four genomic groups combining POLE 
mutational analysis with immunohistochemical analysis of p53 and 
mismatch repair (MMR) proteins.
We aimed to evaluate feasability of this new classification of endo-
metrial carcinoma in routine.
Methods: Searching POLE mutations in exons 9 to 14 was 
performed by SANGER sequencing on frozen tumoral material. 
Mismatch repair genes deficiency (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, 
PMS2) was assessed by either immunohistochemistry and/or MSI 
statement using the PCR real-time based molecular idyllaTM 
system testing, on formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) 
tumoral tissue. P53 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on 
FFPE.
Results: We achieved molecular classification in twenty endome-
trial carcinoma cases.
Our first results revealed 3 new silent mutations in exons 9 and 10 
and a novel stop mutation at exon 13 of POLE gene: One patient 
carries two silent mutations in respectively exon 9 and 10 with 
and MSS status and a normal expression of P53; a second patient 
with a silent mutation at exon 9, is deficient in MLH1 and PMS2 
protein and normal expression of P53; the functional mutation at 
exon 13 concerned a woman with proficient MMR protein and a 
focal immunostaining of P53. 50% of patients without any mutation 
in POLE gene were MSI and P53+.
Conclusion: Our first step in molecular classification of endome-
trial cancer highlighted new mutations in POLE gene. Our expe-
rience showed that molecular classification is quite complex in 
routine. Pole mutation is somewhat tedious because of the need 
of frozen tissue and the technique is long. Immunohistochemis-
try needs good practice in pre-analytical step and idylla technique 
could be an alternative solution.

Background & objectives: Incidence of breast cancer (BC) in Hun-
gary is similar to neighboring Central European countries, however, BC 
mortality is much higher. It is of importance to characterize commonly 
affected genes in specific patient populations in order to efficiently aid 
targeted therapies.
Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing of 63 sam-
ples of 29 Hungarian BC patients using the Illumina NovaSeq

6000 instrument. Short genomic variants (both germline and 
somatic) and copy-number alterations were detected using stand-
ard bioinformatical protocols. Comparison of the germline muta-
tion allele frequencies with the 1000 genomes project and the 
non-Finnish European population of the gnomAD database was 
performed.
Results: Canonical BC-associated genes with pathogenic ger-
mline mutations were CHEK2 and ATM. Most of the detected 
somatic short variants were SNPs and on average only 8% and 6% 
of them were deletions or insertions. The ratio of tumours har-
bouring pathogenic somatic variants in the most affected genes 
were: KMT2C (31%), MUC4 (34%), PIK3CA (18%) and TP53 
(34%). Among the cancer-related genes, copy-number alterations 
were most common in NBN, RAD51C, BRIP1 and CDH1. COS-
MIC mutational signature analysis showed domination of the 
mutational processes associated with homologous recombination 
defect (specifically SBS3 was present in 59% of the patients 
with a weight of 8% or larger), APOBEC-related processes and 
general aging-related, clock-like signatures.
Conclusion: Most of the observed germline mutations are 
approximately as frequent in the Hungarian BC cohort as 
in independent European populations. We foresee that more 
accurate and reproducible detection of pathogenic SNPs 
and mutations will generate a more complete picture of the 
landscape of breast carcinomas. Additional investigation of the 
genes presented above with pathogenic germline mutations and 
harbouring pathogenic somatic variants and associated pathways 
could delineate biological susceptibilities and improve treatment 
options in different breast carcinoma subtypes.

Learnings from two years of external quality assessment 
(EQA) for BRCA1/BRCA2 testing in metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)
V. Williams*, J.A. Fairley, M. Woodcock, M.H. Cheetham, N.L. 
Wolstenholme, Z.C. Deans, S.J. Patton
*EMQN, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Prostate cancer is the second most com-
mon cancer diagnosis in men. PARP inhibitors were approved for treat-
ment of mCRPC patients with BRCA1/BRCA2 gene variants in 2020. 
We share findings from EQA schemes in which up to 100 laboratories 
participated globally.
Methods: EMQN CIC and GenQA provided three formalin fixed 
paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples to participating laboratories 
for BRCA1/BRCA2 testing; the laboratories were asked to use 
their routine test methodologies. The anonymised results were 
assessed and peer reviewed. Individual laboratory and overall 
summary scheme reports were produced to help laboratories 
improve their performance and to enable benchmarking of results 
and reporting.
Results: Two pilot EQA schemes for BRCA1/BRCA2 testing in 
Prostate cancer ran in 2020 (32 laboratories) and 2021 (100 labo-
ratories). The overall analytical (genotyping) error rate in 2021 
was 9%, with errors reported for all three cases, probable causes 
for these errors will be discussed. Additionally, there were sev-
eral common themes identified where improvements could be 
made to the reporting of the clinical interpretation of the results.
Conclusion: The results demonstrate the benefit of participa-
tion in EQA to proactively identify sources of error in BRCA1/
BRCA2 genotyping and to improve the quality of interpretation 
and reporting of results in order to help ensure correct access to 
treatment and appropriate follow up for mCRPC patients.

Ultrasound-guided minimally invasive autopsy as an alterna-
tive to conventional autopsy in selected patients: a case report
C. Fuente-Díaz*, M. García-Martínez, M. Berríos-Hernández, 
M.d.l.P. González-Gutiérrez, V. Blanco-Lorenzo, E. Colado, C. 
González del Rey-Rodríguez, J.R. Riera, A. Encinas-Muñiz
*Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Spain
Background & objectives: Ultrasound-guided Minimally Invasive 
Autopsy (US-MIA) has been made in the context of COVID-19 pan-
demic to reduce the risk of infection during the procedure, but this 
technique could be used in other autopsies for different purposes.
Methods: We report a case of an 85-year-old woman with solid 
lesions in right-orbital region and both parotids, as well as multiple 
cervical lymphadenopathies. A previous diagnosis of an aggressive 
marginal B-lymphoma was made; but the scarce tissue received, 
did not allow the performance of complementary studies in view 
of certain clinical discrepancies. Patient died and an autopsy study 
was requested.
Results: Ultrasound Guided Fine Needle Aspiration (US-FNA) 
and core needle biopsy (CNB) of orbital and parotid lesions were 
performed with subsequent Rapid On-Site Evaluation -ROSE- of 
tissue to ensure an adequate specimen and preserve the anatomical 
appearance. US-MIA made by trained pathologist is a good 
method to obtain representative tissue samples as an alternative 
to a conventional autopsy in some patients. In this case, dissection 
of both parotids would have been a disfiguring and difficult 
procedure, even unnecessary. This method allowed us to evaluate 
the specimen on site to guarantee enough material for additional 
studies and postmortem diagnosis.
Conclusion: US-MIA, US-FNA and CNB are safety and easy 
methods of obtaining tissue samples that can be performed by a 
trained pathologist. These procedures could be applied in our daily 
work as an alternative to complete diagnostic autopsies, not only 
in procedures with elevated risk of infection.

carcinoma
A. Sapargaliyeva*, I. Sergeyeva
*Pathology Bureau of Almaty City; Al-Farabi Kazakh National 
University (Department of Fundamental Medicine), Kazakhstan
Background & objectives: Pancreatic acinar-neuroendocrine carci-
noma is a tumour that often remains undiagnosed during life. We pre-
sent a case of pancreatic acinar-neuroendocrine carcinoma, which was 
a histological finding in a patient who died from massive myocardial 
necrosis.
Methods: Patient N. (80 years of age) was admitted to the emer-
gency hospital with severe chest pain, which was relieved by drugs. 
Based on clinical signs and the results of laboratory and instru-
mental studies, doctors diagnosed infarction of the lateral wall of 
the left ventricle. The patient died 3 days after admission to the 
emergency hospital.
Results: Autopsy revealed: 1) necrosis in the myocardium, similar 
to an anterior transmural infarction with involvement of the septal 
wall; 2) intact coronary artery; 3) myocardial hypertrophy (where 
LV wall thickness constituted 1.8 cm), thickening of the interven-
tricular septum thickness (1.7 cm).

Microscopic examination revealed undifferentiated pancreatic car-
cinoma with irregular tumour glands with cribriform components 
embedded in the desmoplastic stroma. Changes in the myocardium 
included necrosis with prominent neutrophilic infiltration, indicat-
ing an acute state of secondary myofiber necrosis (4-5 days).
Conclusion: Features of this case include undifferentiated pancre-
atic carcinoma undiagnosed during life; no visible changes in the 
pancreas during the autopsy; lesions in the myocardium, that are 
considered secondary to necrosis.

Incidental multilocular cystic nephroma in forensic pathology
C. Amalinei*, L.A. Riscanu, A. Grigoras
*"Grigore T. Popa" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Iasi and 
Institute of Legal Medicine Iasi, Romania
Background & objectives: Multilocular cystic nephroma is a rare 
cystic tumour without a grossly appreciable solid component, which 
mainly occurs in adult women. The aim of our study is to report five 
cases of multilocular cystic nephroma incidentally discovered in the 
necroptic examination.
Methods: The reports from autopsies performed in the last five 
years in our department have been reviewed and five cases of 
multilocular cystic nephroma, with age range between 50 to 80 
years old (four females vs. one male), have been selected. The 
necroptic examination has been associated to collection of tissue 
specimens for microscopy, followed by paraffin-embedding and 
routine staining.
Results: The gross findings were that of multiple well-circum-
scribed, multilocular cystic renal masses, with variable size, rang-
ing between approximately 4-7.5mm diameter, filled with serous to 
serosanguinous fluid, eccentrically-located, and pushing the renal 
pelvis. The microscopic examination revealed numerous cysts lined 
by a single layer of cells with various morphology (flat, cuboidal, 
and hobnail type), with minimal cytological atypia, and no evi-
dent mitoses. The cysts have been characteristically associated with 
fibroblastic stroma, containing hemosiderin-laden macrophages 
and focal chronic inflammation. Polycystic renal disease has been 
excluded in all cases.
Conclusion: Despite their rare occurrence, multilocular cystic 
nephromas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of 
cystic renal cancers or benign tumours, such as mixed epithelial 
and stromal tumour (MEST), angiomyolipoma with epithelial 
cysts, partially differentiated cystic nephroblastoma (CPDN), 
and tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma. They may be incidentally 
discovered during necropsy and microscopic examination may 
certify the diagnosis.

Fatalities in environmental heat exposure
C. Amalinei*, A.A. Hlescu, A. Grigoras
*"Grigore T. Popa" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Iasi and 
Institute of Legal Medicine Iasi, Romania
Background & objectives: Death from hyperthermia may occur when 
the core body temperature is higher than 40 degrees Celsius. The aim 
of our study is to report the microscopical and immunohistochemical 
features of hyperthermia from our files, in the appropriate environ-
mental conditions.
Methods: The autopsy reports of our department, from the last 12 
years, have been reviewed, and four cases of hyperthermia have 
been selected, in men with an age range between 31-49 years old. 
Routine hematoxylin and eosin staining, along with Periodic Acid-
Schiff (PAS) and immunohistochemistry using Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), 
Ubiquitin (Ub), Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), and Aquaporin-1 
(AQP-1) have been performed.
Results: The gross findings showed pulmonary and cerebral 
oedema, along with pleural, epicardial, and peritoneal haem-
orrhagic petechiae (3 cases), along with myocardial fibrosis 
and hepatic steatosis (2 cases). Microscopy revealed alveo-
lar and cerebral oedema, pleural and epicardial microhaem-
orrhages. AQP-1 immunopositivity was observed in lung 
endothelial cells, while neurons showed a positive expression 
of Hsp70. Cardiomyocytes showed vacuolar degeneration and 
contraction bands, along with SIRT1 weak immunoreactiv-
ity and its focal positivity loss in areas associated with con-
traction bands. Amorphous intra-tubular and intra-capsular 
space material, renal corpuscle basal lamina thickening, and 
Ub intense positive expression in distal convoluted tubules 
epithelium and in the outer layer of the Bowman’s capsule 
have been also identified.
Conclusion: Death from environmental-induced hyperthermia is 
a rare condition in legal medicine, which occurs when the ther-
moregulatory mechanisms are no longer capable of effectively 
dissipate the heat. The microscopic examination and immuno-
histochemistry may add valuable information for diagnosis in 
these cases.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus septicaemia diagnosed post-
mortem - a case report
A. Hennessy*, N. Shah
*University Hospital Waterford, Ireland
Background & objectives: Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a gram 
negative bacteria which is a constituent of the oral flora of dogs. 
Infection in humans is uncommon, however predisposing factors 
include alcoholism, asplenia, and immunosuppression. A case of fatal 
C.canimorsus infection diagnosed post-mortem is described.
Methods: A 60 year old male patient presented to the emer-
gency department with a history of epigastric pain and a low-
grade temperature, on a background of recent heavy alcohol 
consumption. The initial impression was acute pancreatitis, 
however the patient rapidly deteriorated, developing respira-
tory failure within an hour of presentation. He subsequently 
had a cardiopulmonary arrest which was not amenable to 
resuscitation.
Results: A post-mortem examination carried out demonstrated 
severe coronary artery atheroma and biventricular hypertrophy. 
Of note, there were no findings suggestive of recent animal-
inflicted trauma. The initial patient history did not enquire about 
animal exposure or dog bites or scratches, however subsequent 
history from the family revealed the patient had been a dog-
owner and had a history of alcohol abuse. C.canimorsus was 
isolated on ante-mortem blood cultures after a prolonged incu-
bation period.
Conclusion: C.canimorsus infection is associated with a 
mortality of between 25 to 30%. The diagnosis is often difficult 
due to the variable presentation, and the elusiveness of diagnosis 
can lead to adverse outcomes. A high level of suspicion in 
patients presenting with sepsis in the presence of risk factors 
is important. The rapid deterioration of the patient in this case 
highlights the importance of considering C.canimorsus in the 
differential diagnosis, and in initiating antimicrobial therapy 
promptly.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection in a pregnant woman 
with COVID-19
L. Chinezu*, C.C. Radu
*UMFST G.E. Palade Tg. Mures, Romania
Background & objectives: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection 
(SCAD) is a rare condition with life-threatening maternal complication. 
We describe a case of a 35-year-old pregnant woman, who died with 
an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and try to highlight the possible 
association with COVID-19.
Methods: During the third trimester of pregnancy, the patient 
presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with AMI caused 
by SCAD on the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. 
Stenting of the LAD was performed. Concomitantly, the patient 
was tested positive for COVID-19. Due to life threatening cardiac 
instability, an emergency caesarean section was performed, and 
she died shortly after.
Results: The autopsy was performed at the Institute of Foren-
sic Medicine of Targu Mures and revealed an extensive anterior 
AMI of the left ventricle. A permeable stent on the LAD with 
an important subintimal haemorrhage was seen. On microscopic 
view, the transmural AMI was confirmed. LAD examination 
revealed a discontinuous intimal area and a massive haemorrhage 
into the subjacent media. Based on elastica van Gieson staining 
the fibro-muscular dysplasia diagnosis was infirmed. Massive 
acute pulmonary oedema was also seen, but without pathologi-
cal changes suggestive for COVID-19 pulmonary involvement.
Conclusion: SCAD is a rare event, and its causes are still debated. 
The association of COVID-19 with some other known risk factors 
(age >30 years and smoking) could have aggravated the underlying 
condition and lead to the occurrence of this SCAD.

An unusual case of infrarenal pheochromocytoma developed 
on ectopic adrenal tissue
R. Chiciudean*, T. Bara, I. Jung, S. Gurzu
*Department of Pathology, Mures County Emergency Hospital, 
Romania
Background & objectives: Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine-
secreting tumours arising from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal 
medulla. Ectopic adrenal tissue is usually formed by cortex only. 
We describe an unusual case of pheochromocytoma located in the 
infrarenal area associated with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia.
Methods: A 70-year-old patient was admitted for syncope, dia-
phoresis, and high blood pressure. Computed tomography showed 
a 73x70x72 mm mass of the left infrarenal/paraaortic area. High 
levels of metanephrine and noradrenaline were found in the urine. 
Tumour resection was performed. After surgery, the blood pressure 
suddenly decreased and could not be restored. A few days after the 
surgery the patient died.
Results: Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen 
revealed a proliferation of tumoural monotonous cells, with 
eosinophilic cytoplasm, round nuclei with prominent nucleoli 
arranged in clusters. Among them, there were highly pleomorphic 
areas composed of large, atypical cells, with abundant, 
eosinophilic cytoplasm and irregular, hyperchromatic nuclei. 
Large areas of haemorrhage were observed, same as vascular 
invasion. Immunohistochemically (IHC), the neoplastic cells 
were positive for Synaptophysin and Chromogranin, showed a 
Ki67 index over 80% and did not express Inhibin A and S100. 
At the autopsy, both adrenal glands proved to show hyperplasia 
but unrelated to the tumour mass. The histological aspect, 
location, and immunophenotype indicated an ectopic infrarenal 
pheochromocytoma.
Conclusion: In patients with pheochromocytoma developed on 
ectopic adrenal tissue clinical management might be difficult and 
diagnosis can be sometimes established only based on post-mortem 
histopathological examination. Autopsy can be extremely useful in 
such cases with unexplained evolution.

*Central Pathology Laboratory, Research Institute of Human Mor-
phology, Russia
Background & objectives: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a rare 
type of autoimmune necrotizing vasculitis typically associated with 
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). This disease affects 
small and medium vessel with a perivascular granulomatous inflam-
mation. The renal and pulmonary vessels are predominantly involved 
in process.
Methods: We present an autopsy case of 36-years old man with 
COVID-19 and previously diagnosed untreated granulomatosis 
with polyangiitis. The patient in a critical condition was trans-
ported to the intensive care unit of a hospital where he died within 
5 hours despite all the resuscitation treatment. Autopsy examina-
tion was performed.
Results: An autopsy revealed multiple petechial haemorrhages 
in the brain with a cerebral oedema. The pleura and the pericar-
dium are covered with fibrin deposits. Serous fibrinous effusion in 
pleural cavity is also revealed. Lungs are oedematous with a foam 
fluid and blood. The surface of the kidneys was with regenerated 
infarctions.
Histopathological examination of the lungs revealed perivascular 
and peribronchial sclerosis. Alveoli was with intraalveolar hyaline 
membranes formations. Interstitium is infiltrated by lymphocytes.
Histopathological examination of the kidneys showed emerged 
necrotizing glomerulonephritis has led to massive glomerulosclero-
sis. There was also lymphocytic infiltrate in interstitium of kidneys.
Microcirculatory vessels of lungs and kidneys was thrombosed and 
affected by granulomatous inflammation.
Conclusion: In this article we have presented a rare case of a 
COVID-19 occurring against the background of active phase of 
untreated granulematosis with poliangiitis. This combination of 
severe vasculitis of different aetiologies led to multiply damage of 
highly vascularized organs such as lungs and kidneys.

Background & objectives: Fibrinous pericarditis is an often-difficult 
diagnosis, important for its potential complications. Hemopericardium 
and subsequent cardiac tamponade are life-threatening conditions and

must be readily identified, for which the aetiology of the pericarditis 
invests itself of a greater significance in the prognosis.
Methods: A 67-year-old male patient with non-dilated ethanolic 
cardiomyopathy and chronic kidney disease presented to 
the emergency department with intense abdominal pain and 
hypotension. The echocardiogram revealed a pericardial effusion 
of 3 cm extent with hemodynamic failure. A pericardiocentesis 
to drain the effusion was initiated, but the patient suffered a 
cardiorespiratory arrest and died.
Results: During the post-mortem, while opening the pericardial 
cavity, we found a large quantity of blood and clots, totalling a 
volume of approximately 750 mL. We also observed an epicardium 
with abundant fibrinous adhesions, which warranted a fibrinous 
pericarditis diagnosis. In our case, several aetiologies were 
proposed and investigated, having favoured the uremic cause, in 
the context of the patient’s chronic kidney disease, now acutely 
worsened by the clinical picture. In fact, the patient presented 
with very high levels of creatinine (4,03 mg/dL, reference values 
between 0,72 – 1,25) and urea (260 mg/dL, reference values 
between 18,0 – 55,0), as well as an estimated glomerular filtration 
rate of 14 mL/min/m2.
Conclusion: Fibrinous pericarditis is caused by several factors, and 
in patients with chronic kidney disease, the uremic aetiology has to 
be considered. The accumulation of metabolites in the blood leads 
to an inflammatory response in the pericardium and the platelet 
dysfunction can further complicate this with hemopericardium. A 
careful autopsy examination, showing a dry, granular heart surface, 
covered in fibrinous exsudate, is typical. Our case shows how the 
post-mortem and its correlation with clinical findings enables a 
precise etiological diagnosis.

The histological effects of colchicine in the setting of Behcet’s 
disease: an autopsy case report
J. Pimentel*, E. Dutra, C. Pontinha
*Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Lisboa Central (CHULC), 
Portugal
Background & objectives: Colchicine is a drug with antimitotic 
effects used in the treatment of a variety of medical conditions such as 
Behcet’s disease. It has a narrow therapeutic window, and its toxicity 
can result in multiorgan failure and death.
Methods: We present the case of a 64-year-old female with hyper-
tension, depressive disorder and Behcet’s disease. She was medi-
cated with 1mg of Colchicine daily. The patient presented to the 
emergency department with a three-day history of abdominal pain, 
diarrhoea and vomiting, which culminated in her death. Clinical 
autopsy was requested.
Results: The autopsy revealed extensive ecchymoses in both arms, 
generalized atherosclerosis, and hardened white pleural plaques 
in the apex of both lungs, among other changes. There were no 
mucosal ulcers or macroscopic changes to the myocardium. Histo-
logical analysis showed an early stage myocardial ischemic event 
with associated neutrophils, precirrhotic alcoholic steatohepati-
tis, renal hypertensive changes and pulmonary “apical caps”. In 
addition, histopathological study of the oesophagus, vagina and 
bladder showed epithelial pseudostratification, loss of polarity and 
multiple “ring” (metaphase) mitosis in their mucosas. There were 
no specific changes attributed to Behcet’s disease. No toxicological 
analyses of colchicine levels in blood or urine were available and 
no samples were collected.
Conclusion: This case highlights the striking histopathological 
manifestations of colchicine, which only occur at toxic levels. They 
can therefore serve as a surrogate for toxicological analysis in cases 
such as this with clinical symptoms of toxicity. Despite not being 
always present, these signs should be recognized by the pathologist 
with great care not to misdiagnose them as dysplastic or neoplastic 
alterations.

Mutavdžić, B. Barišić, M. Tubić, D. Dunđerović
*Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Bel-
grade, Serbia
Background & objectives: The majority of vertebral artery injuries 
are due to blunt trauma from motor vehicle crashes while other causes 
are less common. Closed injuries of vertebral arteries are induced by 
hyperextension coupled with lateral flexion or rotation of the head.
Methods: 43-year-old woman complained of the neck pain and 
shortness of breath lasting three days. MSCT angiography revealed 
a bleeding from the right vertebral artery with hematoma involving 
the neck, the mediastinum and the right hemithorax. The patient 
denies the injury, but states that she had a dental intervention seven 
days before the first symptoms.
Results: The patient was urgently referred for vascular surgical 
procedure, but the lethal outcome occurred during the surgery. 
An autopsy confirmed transection of right vertebral artery in the 
neck, 2 cm away from origin, with the formation of hematoma in 
the neck and mediastinum, and severe right haemothorax (3000 ml 
blood). Further detailed examination revealed that the woman was 
suffering from hypertension (hypertensive heart, kidney and brain 
diseases), induced by incidentally found pheochromocytoma of the 
right adrenal gland. Furthermore, an external examination revealed 
several soft subcutaneous nodules of upper and lower extremities 
which histologically corresponded to neurofibromas, altogether 
indicating possible inherited diseases such as NF1 or MEN2.
Conclusion: Bleeding from the vertebral artery in the neck is 
extremely rare consequence of blunt injury, usually caused by 
neck hyperextension, but not frequently associated with common 
procedures such as dental interventions. Mild but prolonged neck 
hyperextension causes a vertebral artery compression at the entry 
into the vertebral column, producing a focal vessel injury with a 
higher possibility of dissection/transection in hypertensive patients. 
In this case, hypertension induced by pheochromocytoma was con-
tributing factor to fatal vertebral artery bleeding.

Background & objectives: Amyloidosis is a syndrome characterized 
by a group of diseases which have in common extracellular protein 
deposits called amyloid fibrils.
Methods: Autopsy report of a 53-year-old woman with abdominal 
discomfort, inappetence and asthenia, evolving with progressive 
worsening and severe hepatic and renal dysfunction requiring 
dialysis, deep vein thrombosis and suspected sepsis.
Results: At autopsy, yellowish meninges; congested brain; volumi-
nous bilateral pleural effusion; pericardial effusion; enlarged heart,

yellowish myocardium, myocardial hypertrophy; wine-coloured 
lungs with subpleural petechiae and mild oedema and congestion; 
ascitic fluid with a citrine appearance; liver with a micronodular 
appearance, firm consistency and yellowish coloration on cuts, 
with a diffusely hardened and yellowish parenchyma; yellow kid-
neys with a finely granular surface and on cuts there is medullary 
congestion with a yellowish cortical zone. The histopathological 
study shows liver, heart and kidneys with diffuse extracellular dep-
osition of amorphous, hyaline and eosinophilic material refracting 
to polarized light with Congo Red staining. Microscopic findings 
of deposits are consistent with amyloidosis.
Conclusion: How there is no clinical and morphological evidence 
of active inflammatory or infectious disease, inferring this is pri-
mary amyloidosis that justifies and explains the clinical picture and 
the Outcome otherwise, the clinical suspected septicemia was not 
set by the anatomo-pathological findings.

A clinical case of acute myocardial infarction with myomalacia 
in COVID-19 in a man with hypertension
K. Kosov*, E. Guryanova, O. Vorobyeva, L. Romanova, N. 
Zhuravleva
*Chuvash State University by I.N.Ulianov, Russia
Background & objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic is a serious 
health threat. In addition to pulmonary complications, cardiovascular 
consequences are common. Purpose - to describe a case of infection 
with the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the development of acute myocardial 
infarction and myomalacia.
Methods: According to the autopsy - the corpse of a man, 50 years 
old, a history of hypertension for 15 years. According to computed 
tomography - 75% lung damage. PCR test for covid-19 positive. 
The electrocardiogram showed signs of acute anterolateral myo-
cardial infarction with myomalacia. Clinical and morphological 
analysis, virological method, staining of histological sections with 
hematoxylin-eosin were carried out.
Results: Autopsy in the lungs revealed alternation of moderately 
airy alveoli with areas of dystelectasis. In the lumen of the alveoli, 
oedematous fluid, focally desquamated alveolocytes, macrophages, 
erythrocytes, and hyaline membranes along the contour of the alveoli 
were diffusely determined. In the heart - muscle fibres were frag-
mented, focally wave-like curved. There were fields of non-nuclear 
necrotic cardiomyocytes with perifocal neutrophilic infiltration. Elec-
tron microscopic examination in the foci of myomalacia revealed 
damage to organelles, contractures of myofibrils, myocytolysis and 
disintegration of muscle cells with the formation of fine granular 
detritus. Plasmatization of the vascular wall, erythrocyte stasis with 
sludge phenomenon and precapillary fibrosis were determined.
Conclusion: In this case, against the background of covid pneumo-
nia, an acute myocardial infarction of the anterolateral wall of the 
left ventricle was determined, which was not extensive. Significant 
changes were revealed in non-infarction zones: plasmatization of 
the vascular wall, erythrocyte stasis with sludge phenomenon and 
precapillary fibrosis. The stromal vessels were filled with blood to 
varying degrees, signs of endotheliitis were detected. Early onset 
of myomalacia was noted, obviously associated with the severity 
of the process and hemodynamic instability.

Primary mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the breast - case report
N. Ilieva*, D. Tashkova, A. Georgiev, V. Ivanov
*Complex oncologic centre-Plovdiv, Bulgaria
Background & objectives: In comparison to its counterpart in 
the salivary gland, primary mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) of 
breast is a very rare entity, accounting for 0.2-0.3% of all breast 
carcinomas. There are only 41 cases described up to date in the 
English literature.
Methods: We present a case of a 60-years old female patient with 
palpable lump in the upper lateral quadrant of her left breast. 
Ultrasonographic examination showed solid, malignant appearing 
lesion, 2.6 centimetres in greatest dimension and an adjacent area 
of clustered microcalcifications with diameter 2 centimetres. Core 
biopsy was performed, which was interpreted as a poorly differenti-
ated triple-negative ductal carcinoma.
Results: The patient underwent quadrantectomy with axillary 
lymph node dissection. Grossly, well-circumscribed lesion, 23 
millimetres in diameter, with solid and cystic areas was found. 
Microscopically the tumour was composed of different proportions 
of mucinous, epidermoid and intermediate cells, arranged in solid 
sheets and cystic spaces, filled with mucoid material. Tumour cells 
exhibited immunonegativity for oestrogen, progesterone and HER-2 
protein, but appeared to be positive for CK7, CK5/6, p63 and EMA. 
Additionally, 30% of the cells were positive for Ki-67. Based on the 
specific morphologic and immunohistochemical characteristics the 
lesion was histologically classified as mucoepidermoid carcinoma 
of intermediate grade.
Conclusion: In conclusion, primary breast MEC is extremely rare, 
causing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in the everyday 
practice. Although being triple-negative, it has favourable 
prognosis, especially for the low-grade histologic variants, with 
low risk for metastasis or recurrence. Reporting MEC cases is 
essential for better understanding of its clinical and biological 
behaviour and for establishing standard treatment strategies by the 
multidisciplinary team.

Neuroendocrine tumour of the breast showing invasive micro-
papillary features and multiple lymph node metastases

Fujimoto, A. Asano, H. Imada, C. Muramatsu, H. Nagai
*Department of Pathology, Saitama Medical University Interna-
tional Medical Center, Japan
Background & objectives: The WHO classifies neuroendocrine 
neoplasms (NENs) as a special tumour entity, representing <1% of 
invasive breast carcinomas (IBCs), and recognises two subtypes: 
neuroendocrine tumour (NET) and neuroendocrine carcinoma. 
Herein, we present the first case with an invasive micropapillary 
mammary NET.
Methods: A 65-year-old woman had become aware of a tumour 
in her right breast 11 months prior to presentation at our hospi-
tal. Ultrasonography revealed a huge, cystic right breast tumour 
with enlarged regional nodes. No other lesions were identified by 
either systemic CT or bone scintigraphy. The patient underwent 
fine-needle aspiration of the mammary lesion, and the cytological 
diagnosis was carcinoma.
Results: A well-demarcated, multinodular, red-brown tumour, 
which measured 15x15x15 cm, was found in the mastectomy 
specimen. Histopathologically, this solid and cystic lesion 
consisted of medullary growth of carcinoma cells accompanied 
by a highly developed vascular stroma. Carcinoma cell nests 
displayed a retraction artifact and antipolarity. Carcinoma 
cells were polygonal and possessed fine-granular cytoplasm

1 3
and nuclei. Macrometastases, up to 13x8 mm, were present 
in 3 of 15 dissected axillary nodes. Immunohistochemically, 
primary and metastatic carcinoma cells were diffusely 
positive for chromogranin A and the oestrogen receptor. HER2 
was negative, and the MIB-1 index was 36.2%. Band-like 
expressions of MUC1 and EMA were noted on the stroma-
facing surface of the carcinoma cell clusters.
Conclusion: Some investigators recently reported that NEN is 
a distinctive type of aggressive IBC. Multivariate analyses have 
revealed that, in patients with mammary NENs, overall survival 
can be predicted by tumour size, nodal status, and the MIB-1 
proliferation rate. Our present patient with an unusual breast 
cancer showing both invasive micropapillary and neuroendocrine 
features developed plural lymphoglandular metastases as well 
as having a tumour with a large diameter and luminal B-like 
immuno-profile. Accordingly, meticulous clinical follow‐up is 
essential for this case.

A. Fara, A. Cossu
*Unit of Anatomic Pathology, Italy
Background & objectives: Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) 
are the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes according to the Sain 
Gallen classification. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the 
immunohistochemical features of TNBC in relation with their histo-
pathological characteristics.
Methods: Consecutive invasive breast cancer cases diagnosed from 
2005 through 2013 were included. All tumours were re-examined 
and classified in accordance with the Saint Gallen classification 
criteria. Immunostaining with tissue micro-array was performed in 
all TNBC with Ventana BenchMark Ultra system with antibodies 
for E-cadherin, Ki67, Cytokeratin 17, Cytokeratin 14, Cytokeratin 
5/6, MUC1, Androgen receptors, IgF1R, p53, Claudin, VEGF, and 
PD-L1.
Results: Globally, 2572 cases with a mean age of 59 years 
were examined, and among them 199 (8%) were identified as 
TNBC; 4 were excluded because they were not Sardinians. 
Therefore, 195 TNBC patients were analysed. At the 
time of diagnosis, most of them had a ductal NOS breast 
carcinoma (DBC, 109, 55.8%), 112 (57.4%) had a T2 or 
greater disease stage, but 108 (52.8%) had no axillary lymph 
node involvement. The grade of the disease was G3 in 146 
(74.8%) cases. Considering the expression of the biomarkers 
analysed, seven TNBC subtypes were identified: cytokeratin 
negative DBC, basal-like DBC, apocrine cancers, medullary 
cancers, pleomorphic lobular cancers, anaplastic cancers, 
and metaplastic tumours.
Conclusion: TNBC show a wide range of specific morphological 
and immunohistochemical features, which characterize subgroups 
with different biological and clinical behaviour. Knowledge of 
these features are essential for correct diagnosis and treatment of 
patients with TNBC.

Mammary Paget’s disease mimicking in-situ melanoma – a case 
report and review of literature
L. Bosoteanu*, M. Aschie, M. Bosoteanu
*Department of Dermatology, “Elias" Emergency University Hos-
pital, Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Mammary Paget’s disease (MPD), 
in-situ breast carcinoma, a scarce histological condition, accounting 
for 1-4% of female breast cancers, may appear either independently, 
or in conjunction with an invasive carcinoma (~90%). The 
immunophenotype generally comprises, among others, positivity for 
HER2.
Methods: We report the case of a 44-year-old female patient, 
presented with a rash of the nipple accompanied by a right 
mammary mass, previously identified on digital mammography. 
The microscopical examination and immunohistochemical 
profile were consistent with MPD associated with invasive breast 
carcinoma (NST), the former particularized by an infrequent 
negative reaction for HER2, while oestrogen receptor was positive.
Results: Herein, the histopathological and immunohistochemical 
approach derived from the exigency of excluding the possibility 
of synchronous tumours: a mammary invasive carcinoma, 
accompanied by another component with MPD phenotypic 
mimicry. The unexpected negative HER2 reaction conducted to 
a primary focus on excluding a malignant melanoma in situ. The 
absence of MelanA and S100 expression, lack of pigmentation 
and clinical aspects infirmed it. Bowen’s disease was invalidated 
by its rare presentation in the breast cutaneous tissue and 
the absence of individual risk factors suggestive of a pre-
existent immunosuppressive status. In case of similar morpho-
immunohistochemical aspects, high expression of Ki-67 signals 
MPD, an immunoreactivity that helped distinguish the cellular 
population from Toker cells.
Conclusion: MPD’s global pattern may provoke to diagnostic 
pitfalls, due to the occasionally polymorphic immunoreac-
tions and its ambiguous clinical presentation. The current case 
highlights an unusual biomarker profile of MPD – overexpres-
sion of oestrogen receptor and HER2 negativity, an associa-
tion only encountered in 6% of the cases. Thus, the utmost 
importance of immunohistochemistry is reflected in its abil-
ity to segregate between different lesional entities and in its 
prognostic significance, being geared towards extending the 
therapeutic arsenal.

Figueiredo
*Department of Pathology, Instituto Português de Oncologia de 
Coimbra Francisco Gentil EPE, Portugal
Background & objectives: Solitary fibrous tumour (SFT) is an 
uncommon mesenchymal neoplasm most often found in the pleura. 
Breast malignant SFTs are extremely rare, being this case the third 
reported so far.
Methods: We present a case of a 79 year-old woman with a 2 cm 
tumour on the upper quadrants of the left breast (BI-RADS-4C). 
The core biopsy revealed a CD34+ mesenchymal tumour of low 
malignant potential (EWGBP-B3). The patient refused surgery. 
After four years, the size of the breast mass was 8 cm and was 
adherent to deep soft tissue.

Results: A new core biopsy was performed revealing an extra-
pleural solitary fibrous tumour (CD34+, STAT6 +) with features 
suspicious of malignancy (EWGBP-B4).The patient was submit-
ted to total mastectomy and partial excision of the pectoralis 
muscle, and the histological diagnosis was a breast malignant 
solitary fibrous tumour. According to Demicco et al’s refined 
stratification model, this case fitted into the high risk class for 
distant metastasis. Despite a suboptimal excision margin, consid-
ering patient performance status, the sarcoma’s multidisciplinary 
team proposed local and systemic vigilance. Four months later, 
clinical status quickly deteriorated, liver and lung metastization 
was detected, and the patient died within a month.
Conclusion: SFT has an indolent course with relatively infrequent 
metastasis (5-25%), aside those cases with sarcomatous transfor-
mation. There are few cases of breast SFT and most of them are 
benign and limited to the female gender. This is the third case of a 
breast malignant SFT so far and in this case with a fatal outcome.

Metaplastic breast carcinoma: a case report
G. Crilly*, N. Shah
*University Hospital Waterford, Ireland
Background & objectives: Metaplastic breast carcinoma is a 
morphologically diverse cancer type which shows differentiation of 
malignant epithelium into squamous or mesenchymal elements and 
accounts for 1% of breast cancers. The mesenchymal elements are 
usually composed of osteoid, chondroid and areas of carcinoma.
Methods: We present the case of an 84 year old lady present-
ing with a rapidly enlarging left breast mass over 6 months. Past 
medical history was significant for ischaemic heart disease. A wide 
local excision revealed a 60mm, calcified lesion.
Results: This was a well-circumscribed tumour composed of 
atypical mononuclear epithelioid and spindled cells. There were 
areas of bone and cartilage formation with osteoclast-like giant 
cells. There were focal areas of malignant squamous and chondroid 
differentiation. Mitotic activity and necrosis was noted. The 
atypical epithelial cells were strongly positive for AE1/3, p63, and 
focally positive for CK5/6 and SMA. They were negative for CD34, 
desmin, EMA, ER, PR, Her2, GATA3, LCA and S100. SATB2 was 
positive in the malignant osteoid component. As such, this lady was 
diagnosed with a metaplastic carcinoma with osteosarcomatous 
differentiation.
Conclusion: Metaplastic breast carcinoma is a rare malignancy 
and thorough sampling is crucial. When mesenchymal elements 
are present, the other main differentials are a primary breast osteo-
sarcoma and malignant phyllodes tumour. Metaplastic carcinoma 
will stain for cytokeratins. Staging is dependent on tumour size as 
per the UICC/ATCC 8th editions. Diagnosis depends on the degree 
of heterologous elements present – those with a bland spindled 
morphology often do well while those with mesenchymal differ-
entiation tend to be aggressive.

T. Boudawara, S. Charfi, M. Mellouli
*Department of Pathology, Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, 
Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Tall cell carcinoma with reverse polarity 
(TCCRP) is an uncommon breast carcinoma, recently recognized as a 
separate entity in the 5th edition of the WHO classification of breast 
tumours. Herein, we report the first case of TCCRP in South Tunisia.
Methods: We report a case of a 34-year-old woman diagnosed 
with TCCRP and we review histological and immunohistochemical 
features of this rare entity.
Results: Our patient presented with a palpable mass located in 
the superomedial quadrant of the right breast. Echomammography 
revealed an atypical mass classified ACR4a. The trucut biopsy 
specimen reported an atypical papillary proliferation. The patient 
underwent lumpectomy. Histological examination showed circum-
scribed nests of epithelial cells with delicate fibrovascular cores 
resembling papillary structures. Fibrovascular cores contained 
sometimes foamy histiocytes and were lined by columnar cells with 
abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and apical nuclei showing some 
grooves. On immunohistochemistry, tumour cells were diffusely 
positive for CK5/6, Calretinin and were negative for oestrogen, 
progesterone, HER-2, TTF1, and p63 (this antibody indicated the 
absence of myoepithelial cells within and around the nests).
Conclusion: Few cases of TCCRP have been reported in the 
literature. It resembles tall cell variant of papillary thyroid 
carcinoma but has a distinct morphological, immunohistochemical, 
and molecular profile (IDH2 mutation). Its pathological diagnosis 
can be challenging and difficult to establish. The treatment is 
mainly based on surgery. No clear indications exist for lymph 
node dissection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. TCCRP has an 
excellent prognosis with low metastatic potential.

Digital radiography for histopathologic examination of breast 
cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
I. Telezhnikova*, L. Zhukova, S. Khomeriki, G. Setdikova
*Loginov Moscow Clinical Research Center, Russia
Background & objectives: Pathologists have various and difficult 
problems related to sampling for histologic examination specimens of 
breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The aim of this study 
was to optimize the pathologic assessment for residual disease in breast 
cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Methods: The analysis were patients who underwent radical surgi-
cal treatment for invasive carcinoma of the breast after neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy. All patients had a good clinical response to treat-
ment. It was performed using a pathology specimen digital radiog-
raphy the Faxitron® Path system (digital X-ray). Specimens radi-
ography reports were compared to the histopathologic evaluation.
Results: The study comprised 32 subjects, average age of the 
patients was 52.5 (9.4). Macroscopic assessment of the primary 
tumour was not probable, the tumour bed was not palpable. 
Accuracy of macroscopic determination of calcinates in relation 
to digital radiography was 93.8% (79.2–99.2). Tumour bed sizes 
determined macroscopically (mean maximal size 6.1 (3.3) cm, 
median 5.2 (3.4–8.0) cm) and using digital X-ray (mean maximal 
size 4.8 (2.6) cm, median 4.1 (2.7–6.2) cm) had statistically 
significant differences (p < 0.0001). In most cases (31/32 (96.9%)), 
clear dimensions of the tumour bed were determined by digital 
X-ray, whereas macroscopy in 25/32 (78.1%) cases determined 
fuzzy dimensions (p < 0.0001).
Conclusion: Using digital X-ray facilitated the morphological 
identification of metal markers implanted into the tumour bed, 
microcalcifications, altered foci, improved tumour bed visibility, 
which is important for further objective status assessment of the 
resection margins and residual cancer burden class. The number 
of repeated incisions decreased which reduced the number of his-
tological cassettes and study time. Without specimen radiography, 
important pathological areas may be easily missed. The results

obtained indicate that specimen radiography provides perfect docu-
mentation of the residual breast cancer.

The rare and the hidden – twin challenges posed by malignancy 
in microglandular adenosis of the breast. Metaplastic matrix 
producing triple negative and multifocal luminal type invasive 
carcinomas
S. Di Palma*, A. Gamage, A. Stacey-Clear, J. Horsnell, I. Ellis
*Royal Surrey County Hospital, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Triple negative metaplastic 
carcinoma(TNMC) and luminal type invasive ductal 
carcinoma(LTIDC) arising in microglandular adenosis(MGA) 
emphasized the spectrum of malignancy developing from MGA 
is wider. Management and prognosis of these malignancies are 
different from TNMC and IDC not arising from MGA.
Methods: Here we report on two cases of invasive malignancy 
arising from MGA. Neither of them could be recognized from the 
pre-operative core biopsy. This report discusses the results of the 
retrospective analysis of the previous core biopsies, it reviews the 
literature for similar cases and considers the implications of this 
rare tumour type on patient management.
Results: One case, core biopsy reported as B4, suspicious of 
malignancy. As a result diagnostic surgical excision was performed 
instead of WLE and SLN biopsy. Following diagnosis of triple 
negative matrix producing metaplastic carcinoma arising in a 
background of MGA, WLE and SLN biopsy was recommended 
but the patient opted for a mastectomy which showed residual foci 
of MGA with atypia and no lymph node metastasis on SLN biopsy. 
The other patient had a core biopsy of LTIDC(ER & PR were 8/8 
and Her2 were negative), B5b without suggestions of background 
MGA. Subsequent WLE specimen revealed multifocal LTIDC. The 
background MGA was only recognized after specialist review of 
the case.
Conclusion: Despite the rarity of MGA, we have recently encoun-
tered two cases where the histological subtyping were not typical. 
In one instance the complicating invasive carcinoma was triple 
negative but had a matrix producing metaplastic carcinoma com-
ponent. In the other instance luminal type and multifocal IDC. Our 
examples suggest that: MGA is usually not recognized on core 
biopsy and MGA can be associated with metaplastic carcinoma as 
well as luminal NST IDC.

Extramammary metastases to the breast: a retrospective 
analysis of 15 cases in a Tunisian institution

Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Extramammary metastases to the breast 
(EMMB) are uncommon. Distinguishing these tumours from primary 
breast cancer is crucial as it affects clinical management and treatment. 
The aim of this work is to review clinico-pathological and therapeutic 
features of this rare entity.
Methods: In a retrospective study, we collected 15 patients who 
were diagnosed, in our department of pathology, with EMMB 
between 1992 and 2020 (29 years). These tumours represented 
0.25% of the total number of breast cancer cases during the period 
of study (5892 cases). An analysis of clinical, imaging, pathologi-
cal and therapeutic features was carried out in all cases.
Results: The mean age of our patients (1 male-14 females) was 
38.42 years (13-62 years). All patients presented with a mammary 
mass which was more frequently unilateral, left-sided and located 
in the superolateral quadrant of the breast. Metastases were 
synchronous with primary tumours in 9 cases and metachronous in 
6 cases (average onset time: 44.4 months). Sources of EMMB were 
carcinomas of the lung, ovary, stomach (each 2cases), nasopharynx 
and rectum (each 1case). Other sources were lymphoma (3cases), 
melanoma, neuroblastoma, leiomyosarcoma and choriocarcinoma 
(each 1case). Immunohistochemistry was used in 12 cases. 
Therapeutic management was based on chemotherapy or radio-
chemotherapy. Six of our patients were dead (average delay of 
12.83 months).
Conclusion: The diagnosis of metastasis in the breast of extra-
mammary origin is often difficult. A confrontation of clinical 
and pathological data with immunohistochemical study is recom-
mended. Immunohistochemistry is very helpful in the absence of 
medical history. The most common sources are lymphomas and 
melanomas. In this study, there was a high incidence of carcino-
mas. The prognosis of this entity is poor. The death rate is about 
80% during the first year following the discovery of the breast 
metastasis.

*Department of Pathology, "G. Gennimatas" General Hospital, 
Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: Metastatic neoplasms of unknown primary 
location often present difficulty in diagnosis. The intracranial spread of 
tumours is a common site and clinical findings can point to the origin 
of the neoplasm.
Methods: A 50-year-old female presented with right exophthalmos, 
complete vision loss and ocular pain. Cerebral MRI showed a right 
cranial orbit mass, with intracranial extension, most likely consist-
ent of meningioma or a metastasis. Further findings discovered, 
a previously unknown breast lesion with invasive characteristics. 
Representative sections of the orbital mass were examined under 
H&E and immunohistochemical stains.
Results: Microscopic examination demonstrated a tumour of 
epithelioid differentiation (AE1/AE3 positive), predominantly 
insular and nested pattern of growth (almost 100%). Neoplas-
tic cells display eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm with a bland 
eccentric placed nuclei and were diffusely positive for oestrogen 
and progesterone receptors, E-cadherin, GATA3, Synaptophysin 
and Chromogranin A. Common mammary markers such as CK7, 
EMA, GCDFP-15, ERBB2 (HER2) and Mammaglobin, were neg-
ative along with S100 and transcription factors such as CDX-2 
and TTF-1. Cell Proliferation index Ki67 (MiB-1) was estimated 
at 25%. Taking all the above histologic and imaging findings into 
consideration, a diagnosis of metastatic NET G2 most likely of 
breast origin was made.
Conclusion: Breast NETs are extremely rare neoplasms (<1% of 
primary breast neoplasms), by definition are invasive tumours and 
may present with a metastasis. Due to the rarity of these neoplasms, 
diagnosis of metastasis is possible through exclusion and consid-
eration of clinical findings. Further studying of these tumours may

N. Mansouri*, M. Ben Thayer, F. Gargouri, R. Aouadi, K. Tlili, I. 
Msakni, B. Laabidi
*Department of Pathology, Military Hospital of Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Malakoplakia is an uncommon inflamma-
tory disease. Breast is extremely rare as a site of occurrence. By this 
case, we aim to discuss clinicopathological characteristics of this entity 
and challenges in the diagnosis.
Methods: We present a case of breast malakoplakia (BM) in a 
35-year-old woman, that mimicked a malignant tumour.
Results: A 35-year-old patient, with no medical history, presented 
to the emergency department with fever and respiratory distress. 
Rapid SARS-coV-19 testing was negative. The patient underwent 
a chest-tomography-scan. It showed no signs of SARS-coV-19 
pneumopathy. However, it revealed an 8mm mass in the inner upper 
quadrant of the right breast. A mammography was undertaken and 
showed round opacities, with spiculated contours and architectural 
distortions (ACR4), mimicking malignancy. Biopsy revealed 
a well limited lesion composed of abundant foamy histiocytes 
and basophilic targetoid intracytoplasmic structures (Michaelis-
Gutmann bodies) that were PAS positive. The diagnosis of BM 
was established. The patient received antibiotherapy with good 
outcome.
Conclusion: Malakoplakia is a very rare inflammatory condition. 
It results from an acquired defect in the phagocytic bactericidal 
activity of macrophages. Its occurrence in breast is extremely 
uncommon with four reported cases in the literature. Clinical pres-
entation of BM is non specific. In the case we presented, it did not 
result in any symptoms and was discovered incidentally. However, 
it can mimic carcinomatous lesion and be challenging for the diag-
nosis. Only histologic examination can confirm the diagnosis and 
rule out malignancy.

Mammary-like carcinoma in an extramammary site: vulvar 
adenocarcinoma arising from specialized anogenital mammary-
like gland. Thinking outside the box. Case report and summary 
of the literature
A. Kovács*, T. Parris, C. Mateoiu, K. Helou, P. Karlsson
*Department of Clinical Pathology, Sahlgrenska University Hos-
pital, Gothenburg, Sweden
Background & objectives: The 68-year-old patient presented with 
an ulcerous vulvar lesion in 2014 that persisted for 8 months. A 
highly differentiated endometrium adenocarcinoma without ovarian 
involvement (FIGO1A) was diagnosed in her hysterectomy/bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy specimen 8 years prior to her vulvar lesion.
Methods: An invasive adenocarcinoma with DCIS grade 3 was 
diagnosed in the vulvar excision. Mammography detected no breast 
carcinoma. The patient received aromatase inhibitor (Exemestane) 
for 5 years. Irradiation was given locally in the vulvar region (30 x 
2 Gray) and regionally for both inguinal region (25 x 2 Gray). No 
recurrence 8 years after the vulvar operation.
Results: Histopathological and immunohistochemical (IHC) examina-
tion revealed an invasive adenocarcinoma with breast cancer features 
which was positive for GATA3, ER, PR, AR, CK7, MUC1, but negative 
for HER2, WT-1, TTF-1, GCDFP-15 and CK20. For differential diag-
nosis the following alternatives were considered 1. metastasis/regional 
recurrence from endometrium adenocarcinoma, 2. breast cancer metas-
tasis, 3. carcinoma arising from ectopic breast tissue, 4. carcinoma 
arising from local apocrine sweat glands. The histological findings 
together with the IHC results were mostly suggestive for a primary 
vulvar adenocarcinoma arising from anogenital mammary-like glands. 
Only tumour tissue was detected in the lesion without ectopic breast 
tissue or apocrine sweat glands (mucoapocrin marker GCDFP-15 was 
negative in the tumour).
Conclusion: Vulvar adenocarcinoma of mammary gland type is 
a rare tumour arising from specialized anogenital mammary-like 
glands. Mammography excluded primary breast carcinoma. Dif-
ferential diagnosis is challenging: 1. Absence of uroplakin II, but 
ER+, mammaglobin+ can confirm breast origin. 2.Metastatic 
breast carcinoma may mimic GATA3+ invasive urothelial carci-
noma. 3.Metastatic lobular carcinoma may mimic plasmocytoid 
bladder carcinoma. The current case with DCIS component was 
suggestive of a primary carcinoma. Diagnosing a breast carcinoma 
like tumour outside the breast requires to “think outside the box”.

Pleomorphic adenoma-like tumour of the breast: an unusual 
entity
A. Syrnioti*, E. Tolparidou, T. Koletsa
*Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Aristotle 
University of Thessaloniki, Greece
Background & objectives: “Pleomorphic adenoma-like tumour of the 
breast” is a term that has been recently proposed to describe breast 
lesions with overlapping histopathologic features between pleomorphic 
adenomas (PAs) of the salivary glands (SGs) and matrix-producing 
metaplastic breast carcinomas (MBCs).
Methods: Here we describe a case of a PA-like tumour of the 
breast, in an 87-year-old female, who presented with a 6-cm lump 
in the right breast, near the nipple. No lymphadenopathy was evi-
dent. The patient underwent modified radical mastectomy. Hema-
toxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical stained sections from the 
tumour were examined.
Results: Microscopic examination revealed a well-circumscribed 
tumour, consisting of an epithelial component within myxoid or 
chondroid stroma with focal osseous metaplasia. The epithelial 
component was characterised by atypical tubular and cribriform 
structures, and scattered individual cells. Moderate atypia 
was focally detected, without significant mitotic activity. On 
immunohistochemical evaluation, neoplastic cells were positive 
for CK5/6, AE1/AE3, and S100, whereas immunostains for 
ER, PR, HER2, p53, and p63 were negative. Few cells were 
immunoreactive to SMA, GFAP, and CD117 antibodies. The 
Ki67 proliferative index was <5%. Taking into account the 
overall indolent histological features and the focal atypia, the 
diagnosis of PA-like tumour of the breast was set. The patient 
remains disease-free.
Conclusion: PA-like tumour of the breast is an unusual entity 
with diagnostic challenges. There are no strict diagnostic criteria 
discriminating it from MBC. The majority of the cases have an 
indolent behaviour, although cases of local recurrence or carcinoma 
development have also been reported. Considering the rarity of this 
entity, multicentre studies are warranted to accurately determine 
its biological nature and behaviour, as well as the best therapeutic 
approach.

Primary malignant melanoma of the breast. A rare case report
M. Mnikhovich, A. Romanov*, D. Pastukhova, T. Sotnikova
*Central pathology laboratory, Research Institute of Human Mor-
phology, Russia
Background & objectives: Primary melanoma of the breast is clas-
sificated into cutaneous and non-cutaneous forms. Despite the fact 
that both forms of the tumour arise from melanocytes, they differ sig-
nificantly. In the breast, non-cutaneous melanomas are extremely rare 
(<5% of all malignant melanomas)
Methods: We present a case of primary non-cutaneous melanoma 
of the breast. A 60-year-old woman was admitted with complaints 
of a slowly growing pain-less mass in the left breast. A needle 
biopsy was performed (according to the results of which melanoma 
was suspected), followed by a total mastectomy with lymph node 
dissection and a wide histological (hematoxylin/eosin stain) and 
IHC study.
Results: Gross examination showed multiple round whitish nodules in 
the breast parenchyma with extension into the mammary fatty tissue.
Histological examination revealed many atypical spindle and 
round melanocytes against the background of desmoplastic stroma. 
Tumour cells expressed S-100, Sox-10, HMB-45, Melan A. There 
was a complete absence of expression of Her-2, ER, PR. A diagno-
sis of primary non-cutaneous parenchymal melanoma of the breast 
was established.
Conclusion: Primary non-cutaneous breast melanoma is rare and 
presents a diagnostic challenge for both the histopathologist and 
the clinician. Thanks to the presented case, we have expanded our 
understanding of the nature of these tumours.

Pure signet-ring cell carcinoma of the breast – two case reports 
of a rare entity
T.M. Costa*, R. Sampaio
*Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Ocidental, Portugal
Background & objectives: Primary signet-ring cell carcinoma 
(PSRCC) of the breast is a very rare entity. To date, few cases have 
been reported in the literature. We present two case reports of pure 
PSRCC of the breast and discuss the available literature.
Methods: We searched the archives of the Department of Sur-
gical Pathology, Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Ocidental (CHLO), 
between 2010 and 2021. From the breast invasive carcinomas 
diagnosed in that period, we retrieved the pure PSRCC from the 
database. Clinical information was collected from the medical 
records, and the pathological material was reviewed according 
to the current WHO guidelines.
Results: Of the total of 576 cases of invasive carcinoma diagnosed 
in surgical specimen only 2 cases showed dominant signet-ring 
cells (in at least 90% of the tumour) and were diagnosed as pure 
PSRCC. The age of the patients was 30 and 74 years-old. One of 
the cases was of histologic grade 2 and the other grade 3. Neither 
of the cases had axillary lymph node (LN) metastasis nor distant 
metastasis were present. One of the cases had family history of 
breast carcinoma. Both patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy, 
radiotherapy and hormonal treatment.
Conclusion: Pure PSRCC of the breast is uncommon and rarely 
mentioned in the English literature. It has been associated with an 
aggressive clinical course, with greater frequency of LN involve-
ment, poorer prognosis and higher mortality rate, compared with 
other forms of breast cancer. Because of its rarity, there is no clear 
understanding of the oncogenesis, treatment and clinical follow-
up of these patients. Once there are no established treatment 
guidelines we believe that sharing is important for better compre-
hension of this entity.

To explore the changes of 21 gene detection in the 2022 ver-
sion of the breast cancer NCCN guidelines and the interpreta-
tion of the 21 gene in breast cancer in the 2017 version of the 
guidelines
Y. Jia, S. Li, Y. Liu*
*The fourth hospital, China
Background & objectives: To compare the changes of 21 gene detec-
tion in the 2022 version of the breast cancer NCCN guidelines and the 
2017 version of the breast cancer 21 gene interpretation.
Methods: The invasive breast cancer was screened, with negative 
lymph nodes/1-3 ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes, HER-2 nega-
tive and infiltrating. The clinicopathological data of 207 patients 
with foci >0.5cm were collected. To study the differences in the 
21 gene detection guidelines of the 2022 version of the NCCN 
Guidelines, compare the clinical significance of the two versions 
of the guidelines.
Results: A total of 207 IBC patients were collected, including 1 
male and 206 females, aged 35-71 years. Interpretation results of 
the 2017 edition: 124 patients with low recurrence risk, 70 patients 
with moderate recurrence risk, and 13 patients with high recur-
rence risk. Interpretation results of the updated guidelines: 92 
patients with low risk of recurrence, 95 patients with moderate 
risk of recurrence, and 20 patients with high risk of recurrence. 
There were significant differences in the interpretation results of 
the two versions of the guidelines (P<0.05).
Conclusion: The updated 2022 version of breast cancer NCCN 
guidelines 21 gene detection can effectively distinguish the RS 
interpretation results of breast cancer patients before and after 
menopause in clinical practice. For patients with early-stage 
invasive breast cancer, accurate determination of 21-gene status 
is critical to ensuring that patients most likely to benefit receive 
targeted therapy.

Association between protein expression of KISS1 and KISS1R 
and receptor status in invasive breast carcinoma
S. Bachurska*, D. Pupaki
*KOC Plovdiv, Bulgaria
Background & objectives: KISS1 and KISS1R act as metastasis 
suppressors, in breast cancer their function is altered with the exact 
mechanism being still unknown. Here we present the association 
between protein expression of KISS1 and KISS1R with receptor status 
in invasive breast carcinomas.
Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect protein 
expression of KISS1, KISS1R, ER, PR and HER2. The Allred 
scoring system was used for ER and RP and a four-tier scoring 
system was used for HER2. KISS1 and KISS1R immunostaining 
was assessed using ImageJ software by measuring mean grey value 
and calculating reciprocal intensity that is directly proportional to 
the amount of chromogen.
Results: A total of 54 cases of invasive ductal carcinomas were 
examined. For ER and PR scores of 0-2 were considered recep-
tor-negative and scores of 3-8 were considered receptor-positive. 
For HER2, scores of 0 and 1+ were considered HER2-negative 
and scores of 3+ were considered HER2-positive. Equivocal 
scores of 2+ were resolved by DISH. Examined cases included 12

1 3
ER-negative, 42 ER-positive, 21 PR-negative, 33 PR-positive, 47 
HER2-negative and 7 HER2-positive carcinomas. No difference 
was found between receptor-negative and receptor-positive cases 
with respect to ER and PR for both KISS1 and KISS1R and with 
respect to HER2 for KISS1, however KISS1R expression levels 
were significantly higher in HER2-negative compared to HER2-
positive carcinomas.
Conclusion: Software-based assessment of immunostaining is a 
more objective way of quantifying staining intensity when study-
ing potential new markers for which no standardized assessment 
systems are developed. Taking into account receptor status is 
important when studying the altered function of KISS1/KISS1R 
system in the context of breast carcinomas. Higher expression of 
KISS1R in HER 2-negative carcinomas might indicate an alterna-
tive pathway for stimulating proliferation of tumour cells when 
HER2 expression is low.

Primary neuroendocrine breast carcinoma or metastatic lung 
cancer? The role of a careful interpretation of GATA-3
J. Caschili*, A. Ravarino, L. Nonnis, R. Murru, C. Gerosa, G. Faa, 
D. Fanni
*Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University 
of Cagliari, Italy
Background & objectives: Primary small cell neuroendocrine carci-
nomas (SCNECs) of the breast are extremely rare. Here we report the 
case of a 61-year-old woman with a palpable mass developed in the 
upper-outer quadrant of the left breast.
Methods: Biopsy specimens were fixed in 10% formalin and paraf-
fin embedded. Serial sections were stained with H&E. Histology 
revealed a pattern compatible with infiltrating small cell neuroen-
docrine carcinoma of the breast. Immunohistochemical analyses 
were performed using the following antibodies: Cytokeratin AE1/
AE3, p63, GATA-3, Cytokeratin 7, Cytokeratin 20, Chromogranin 
A, Synaptophysin, CD 56, Estrogen Receptor, Progesteron Recep-
tor, Her2-neu and TTF-1.
Results: Microscopically, tumour cells were arranged in solid nests 
and cords with nuclear pleomorphism, high nuclear-cytoplasmatic 
ratio and scattered areas of intratumoural necrosis. Immunohisto-
chemical analyses revealed negativity for Cytokeratin 20, Chro-
mogranin A, Estrogen and Progesterone Receptors, HER2-NEU 
and p63. Cytokeratin AE1/AE3, Cytokeratin 7 and the neuroen-
docrine markers CD 56 and Synaptophysin were positive. TTF-1 
was strongly positive and GATA-3 was focally positive. On these 
bases the diagnosis of primary small cell neuroendocrine carci-
noma (SCNEC) of the breast was made.
Conclusion: The tumour here described showed a strong and dif-
fuse positivity to TTF-1 in the absence of ductal carcinoma in situ 
or areas of conventional-type mammary carcinoma. Thanks to the 
presence of a positive, albeit focal, GATA-3 stain of the tumour 
cells, it was possible to make a diagnosis of primary small cell neu-
roendocrine carcinoma (SCNEC) of the breast. Our diagnosis was 
subsequently confirmed by a PET-scan performed by the patient 
in another facility.

Challenging diagnosis in breast undifferentiated sarcoma - a 
case report
F. Almarii*, A. Blajin, D. Terzea, L. Welt, G. Lica, G. Halcu, I. 
Popa
*Emergency University Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Primary breast sarcomas are rare entities 
with aggressive behaviour and poor prognosis. Undifferentiated pleo-
morphic sarcoma is even rarer in non-irradiated patients. It is important 
to corelate the clinical features, histology and immunohistochemistry 
in order to make this diagnosis.
Methods: We present the case of a 36-year-old woman who pre-
sented in January 2022 to our clinic because of a fast growing, 
giant tumour of the right breast. Mammography showed a 23 cm 
nodule with increased radio-intensity and with homogenous tex-
ture, occupying almost the entire breast.
Results: A core needle biopsy was performed and it showed a 
mesenchymal proliferation with desmin(+) and vimentin(+), focal 
positivity for actin, caldesmon, cytokeratin and ki-67 30%, sug-
gestive of a Phyllodes tumour without the epithelial component on 
biopsy or a sarcoma.
The right mastectomy showed a multinodular, relatively well-
delineated, non-encapsulated tumour. On cut surface there was 
a heterogenous lesion with solid, cystic or translucid areas with 
extensive necrosis and haemorrhage and a thin rim of breast tissue 
at the periphery of 0.5cm.
Histology showed a proliferation of spindle and epithelioid cells 
with a storiform pattern, frequent giant cells, marked pleomor-
phism, areas of tumour necrosis and frequent mitotic figures. No 
leaf-like epithelial pattern.
Conclusion: This case was signed out as a right breast 
undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, grade 3 FNCLCC, pT4, 
and immunohistochemistry was recommended for confirmation.
Primary undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the breast is a 
rare entity with an aggressive behaviour. This case shows the clas-
sic clinical features of a breast sarcoma as a fast-growing giant 
tumour with interesting morphologic features. Immunohistochem-
istry is very important to differentiate it from other sarcomas, meta-
plastic breast carcinoma or from a malignant phyllodes tumour.

Incidental invasive lobular carcinoma arising in a fibroepithe-
lial lesion
L. Williams*, A. Arnaout
*St George’s Hospital, London, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Malignant transformation of the epithelial 
component of fibroepithelial lesions is rare, and when identified, is 
most often either an in-situ malignancy or invasive ductal carcinoma. 
We report an exceedingly rare case of invasive lobular carcinoma, dis-
covered in a fibroepithelial lesion.
Methods: A 41-year-old patient presented to the breast clinic with 
a lump of 2 months duration. On examination this was felt to be 
benign, however mammogram and ultrasound were performed and 
the decision was made to excise the lesion.
Results: Microscopically the lesion was a well-circumscribed multi-
nodular tumour, composed of some areas resembling a fibroadenoma, 
but with other areas displaying mild stromal hypercellularity, periductal 
condensation and nuclear pleomorphism. The tumour was mitotically 
low, and appearances were consistent with a borderline phyllodes. 
Within the lesion, however, individual atypical cells were noted, dis-
playing mild nuclear pleomorphism and prominent nucleoli. Immu-
nohistochemistry revealed these atypical cells to express AE 1/3 and 
ER but to be negative for e-cadherin and CK5. The appearances were 
consistent with a focus of classical grade 2 invasive lobular carcinoma 
S196

within an otherwise borderline phyllodes tumour. The patient under-
went further axillary sampling, and remains well.
Conclusion: Although the occurrence of invasive carcinomas 
within phyllodes tumours is rare, their existence must be consid-
ered by the pathologist. Due to its rarity, there is limited clinical 
outcome data specifically regarding disease progression and patient 
prognosis in invasive lobular carcinoma within phyllodes tumours. 
It is therefore important to highlight these rare cases and build on 
the volume of data in the literature.

Subtleties of early breast implant-associated anaplastic large 
cell lymphoma – a potential for missed-diagnosis
A. Behzadnia, H. Ali, N. Duhli, L. Karsai, A. Elhag, N. Briggs, M. 
Rourke, A. Rahman, B. Wooler, S. Bakhiet*
*Hull University Hospitals NHS Trust, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Breast implant-associated anaplastic large 
cell lymphoma (BI-ALCL) is a rare and significant complication of 
breast augmentation surgeries. Early diagnosis depends on the cytology 
of the peri-implant effusion, as histologically it can resemble post-
implant changes, posing a diagnostic challenge for pathologists.
Methods: We present a case of a 57-year-old lady with a 12-year 
history of bilateral breast augmentation, presenting with a sud-
den unilateral breast enlargement. On examination, asymmetri-
cal enlargement of the right and a palpable nodularity of the left 
breasts were noted. Ultrasound revealed 310ml of right-sided fluid 
collection and a peri-implant well-circumscribed mass. Fine-needle 
aspiration and core needle biopsy were performed.
Results: Fluid examination showed only a few CD68-negative, 
CD30-positive atypical lymphoid cells. Core biopsy of the left-
sided nodularity showed benign reactive synovial metaplasia. 
Further radiological examination with MRI and CT-PET also 
demonstrated peri-implant effusion with very faint metabolic activ-
ity. Patient underwent en-bloc removal of bilateral implants and 
peri-implant capsulectomy. Entire capsules were sampled as no 
abnormality was seen macroscopically or on initial microscopy. 
On further sampling, scattered hallmark cells were identified with 
a CD30+, IRF4+ and ALK- immunophenotype, seen mostly as 
singletons and a few small aggregates, that were confined to the 
luminal aspect of the right capsule, confirming the diagnosis of 
BI-ALCL. Molecular analyses revealed no DUPSP22 or TP63 
rearrangement.
Conclusion: Early-stage BI-ALCL has an indolent course, hence, 
early diagnosis is of paramount importance(1). Early findings 
may be inconspicuous, with scarce hallmark cells, and capsule 
changes that may resemble post-implant changes only, a real 
potential for misdiagnosis. Extensive sampling and a low-threshold 
for immunohistochemistry can aid the diagnosis. Absence of 
DUPSP22-IRF4/TP63 rearrangements in BI-ALCL distinguishes 
it from ALK-negative ALCL(2). When suspected, the first fluid 
aspirate has the best diagnostic value as the dilutional effect of 
subsequent effusions can delay the diagnosis(3).

A rare, unusual case of eosinophilic mastitis: case report
T. Pasupati Meenakshi*, B. Karikalan
*Gribbles Pathology M Sdn Bhd, Malaysia
Background & objectives: Eosinophilic mastitis is a rare, benign 
breast entity and very few cases have been documented worldwide. 
We document a recent and rare case of eosinophilic mastitis, with a 
clinical differential diagnosis of malignancy or chronic granulomatous 
mastitis (CGM).
Methods: A 50-year-old lady presented with a palpable right breast 
lesion at 12 o’clock, with architectural distortion, tenderness and 
lymphadenopathy. Grossly, multiple thin cores of greyish yellow 
tissue, ranging from 8mm to 14mm in length were received. Entire 
tissue was submitted in one block. Routine H&E was performed, 
and the histological features were reported digitally using Aperio 
Image Scope.
Results: Multiple linear core biopsies of right breast lesion showed 
scattered normal appearing breast glands, a few cystically dilated, 
surrounded by striking distribution of abundant eosinophils, along 
with very occasional polymorphs and lymphocytes. Peri lobular 
concentration and aggregation of eosinophils and stromal infiltra-
tion by eosinophils was seen throughout in all the core biopsies 
studied. Occasional ‘eosinophilic islands’ were present. There was 
also formation of eosinophilic emboli within a few of the dilated 
glands. No atypia or necrosis or features of lobular mastitis were 
seen.
Conclusion: Isolated eosinophilic mastitis is extremely rare 
in occurrence and can be clinically mistaken for malignancy or 
chronic granulomatous mastitis (CGM). It can be associated with 
systemic involvement or occur without peripheral eosinophilia. The 
management of such cases is extremely different when compared 
to conventional ductal carcinoma or lobular mastitis. This benign 
entity reemphasizes the need for histopathological diagnosis of 
breast lesions prior to treatment.

Acquired lymphangiectasia following surgery and radiotherapy 
of breast cancer: report of two cases

moun, T. Boudawara, I. Saguem
*Department of Pathology, Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, 
Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Acquired lymphangiectasia (AL) is a dila-
tation of lymphatic vessels that can result as a complication of surgical 
intervention and radiation therapy for malignancy. We describe two 
new cases of AL and discuss their clinical and pathological features.
Methods: Two patients aged of 40 and 56 years old were presented 
to the department of dermatology with vesicles and bullae in the 
chest evolving for two and one year. The patients had undergone 
radical mastectomy with axillary lymphadenectomy for breast car-
cinoma 4 and 7 years ago respectively. They also had received a 
complementary radiotherapy and hormone therapy after surgery.
Results: On examination, multiple grouped vesicles and bullae were spread 
over the left anterior and lateral wall of the chest for the first patient and 
in the right lateral wall of the chest for the second patient without evi-
dence of lymphedema in the two cases. Few of the vesicles were purple in 
colour, pedunculated and hypertrophic. A biopsy was taken from lesions. 
Histopathological examination revealed numerous dilated lymphatics in the 
superficial and papillary dermis lined by flattened endothelial cells, with 
mild hyperkeratosis consistent with diagnosis of lymphangiectasia. The 
lesions were managed with sclerotherapy. No recurrences were notified.
Conclusion: Clinically, AL manifests as translucent vesicles in a 
chronic lymphedematous area arising after many years following 
surgery with or without radiotherapy. The combination of surgery 
and irradiation increase their appearance comparing to surgery or 
irradiation alone and reduce the time of occurrence of AL. Treat-
ment modalities include electrodessication, surgical excision and 
sclerotherapy. These two new cases has demonstrated the impor-
tance of keeping lymphangiectasia in mind as a rare and late com-
plication of radiotherapy and surgical procedures.

Cystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis - case report
I. Poinareanu*, D. Sporis, M. Cristian, A.A. Serb, T.A. Domsa
*Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, “Ovidius” 
University of Constanţa, Romania; Department of Pathology, 
Sacele Municipal Hospital, Brasov, Romania
Background & objectives: Cystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis 
is a rare type of infectious, granulomatous mastitis, usually occurring 
in parous or currently pregnant women.
Methods: We present the case of a 30-year-old breastfeeding 
secundigesta secundipara, reaching the surgery department, one 
month after emphirical antibiotic treatment, for a poorly delineated, 
palpable breast mass, measuring 7/7/5 cm (ultrasound confirmed).
Results: In the pathology department, we received a 5.5/4.5/3 cm secto-
rectomy specimen. The piece was entirely occupied by a whitish-pearly 
lesion, with an irregular, polylobate contour that extended focally to 
the level of the resection margin. Microscopically, the area consisted 
of multiple inflammatory foci, with a tendency to fuse, composed of 
neutrophils, lymphocytes, collections of histiocytes and giant multi-
nucleated cells, with the destruction of lobes and ducts of the breast 
parenchyma and the formation of microabscesses. Pseudocystic spaces 
were detected, containing isolated pale-basophilic, linear structures (his-
tological aspect suggestive of bacilli). The pseudocystic spaces were 
delineated by a crown of neutrophils and numerous epithelioid cells 
arranged radially in the periphery.
Conclusion: The pathological changes were highly suggestive of 
cystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis. A Gram stain was per-
formed to support our diagnosis. Typically presenting as a palpa-
ble mass, CNGM may mimic breast carcinoma. Early diagnosis is 
essential for the proper management of these patients. In medical 
literature these cases are uncommon, almost all being reported 
after childbirth.

Chargui, M. Driss, R. Doghri
*Pathology Department, Salah Azaiez Institute, Research Labora-
tory LR21SP01, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Frozen section of breast sentinel lymph 
nodes is an extremely useful tool to reduce morbidity associated with 
unnecessary axillary dissection. We aimed to evaluate discordances 
rates between frozen section diagnosis and final diagnosis of BSLN 
at our institution.
Methods: We evaluated at least 2 serial sections at 2mm of BSLN 
with Frozen. Final evaluation after formalin fixation was done by 
a second pathologist with breast expertise, and was considered as 
the gold standard. Comparison of discordance rate and aetiology of 
discordant cases was performed to cases that were retrospectively 
identified from the two-years prior.
Results: Seventy specimens retrospectively collected from 
2019- 2021. Discordances were observed in 8 cases (11,4%). 
Four causes of discordance were identified: gross sampling 
(2cases), block sampling (1 case), micro-metastasis/isolated 
tumour cells (3 cases) and misdiagnosis (2 cases) (metastases 
from lobular carcinoma).
Conclusion: The rate of observed discrepancies was relatively 
high. We think that the implementation of a standardized BSLN 
grossing protocol can decrease the rate of discordance between 
frozen section and final diagnosis.

Synchronous bilateral primary breast angiosarcoma after 
reduction mammoplasty: an extremely rare case and litera-
ture review
C. Sönmez*, B.E. Gözükara, Y.K. Akgök, E. Ekren, F. Aker
*Haydarpasa Numune Education and Research Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Primary angiosarcoma of the breast is 
extremely rare. Since its radiological features are nonspecific, diagnosis 
can be challenging. Its aetiology is unclear due to its rarity.
Methods: A 31-year-old female who is breastfeeding presented 
with rapidly growing masses in both breasts. She had bilateral 
reduction mammoplasty 3 years ago. She had no history of radio-
therapy. Her first ultrasonographic examination was evaluated as 
postlactational mastitis. Tru-cut biopsy performed due to the pro-
gression of the masses was reported as angiosarcoma. Bilateral 
simple mastectomy was performed.
Results: A 10 cm mass in the right breast and four masses in the 
left breast, the largest of which is 4 cm, were observed on gross 
examination. The tumoural lesions had irregular borders and contained 
small haemorrhagic cystic spaces. All lesions had similar morphology. 
On microscopic examination, the tumours consisted of pleomorphic 
cells with spindle/oval nuclei and vascular structures anastomosing 
with papillary formations in their lumens. The tumour cells expressed 
CD34, CD31, ERG, and FLI-1. Ki-67 proliferation index was 15-20%. 
C-myc and D2-40 staining were not observed. It was reported as grade 
III angiosarcoma due to necrosis, frequent mitosis (>50/10 HPF), blood 
lakes, endothelial tufting, and solid areas.
Conclusion: Primary angiosarcoma of the breast accounts for 
less than 0.04% of all malignant breast tumours. It is known to be 
unrelated to radiation, but its aetiology remains unclear. In this 
article, we present a unique case of bilateral primary angiosarcoma, 
initially confused with postlactational mastitis, with a history of 
reduction mammoplasty 3 years ago.

K. Kurek, A. Borkowska, M. Spałek, Z. Nowecki, P. Rutkowski
*Narodowy Instytut Onkologii im. M. Sklodowskiej-Curie, Poland
Background & objectives: Primary osteosarcoma of the breast (BOS) 
accounts for <0.125% of all breast malignancies and 12.5% of mam-
mary sarcomas. BOS has an inferior prognosis with 5-year overall sur-
vival below 40%. The common presentation is a progressively enlarg-
ing mass with coarse calcifications.
Methods: We present a 53-year-old female with a tumour 7cm 
diameter localized in the left breast. The patient had no medical 
history of breast or preceding fibroadenoma or phyllodes tumour. 
In January 2022 patient underwent a core biopsy, and in March 
2022, a mastectomy. An extended histopathological examination 
was performed.
Results: Microscopically, the neoplasm was highly cellular, 
composed of spindle cells with moderate to high atypia and high 
mitotic activity, necrosis and multiple haemorrhages, and numerous 
multinucleated giant cells. The large osteoid formation, lace-like 
ossification fields, and chondroid islets were seen in the stroma. 
Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells were: SATB2(+) strongly 
positive, p53(+/-), CKAE1/AE3(-), CAM5.2(-), CK5/6(-), p63(-
), CD10(-), ER(-). PRG(-), HER2(-), SMA(-), Desmin(-), Calde-
smon(-), CD34(-), S100(-), MDM2(-), H3F3A(-), H3F3B(-), 
CD163(-). The tumour was examined in several sections and did not 
show cytokeratin expression or malignant tumour phyllodes (MTP)

architecture. Our patient was in clinical staging cT3N0M0 and 
was qualified for postoperative radiotherapy (total dose 54/60Gy).
Conclusion: In conclusion, BOS is an exceptional diagnosis 
and up-to-date, only a few cases have been reported. The 
differential diagnosis with MC (if lacking invasive/in-situ 
carcinoma the immunohistochemical confirmation of epithelial 
differentiation is needed) and MTP requires extended sampling 
and immunohistochemical assessment. Treatment should include 
complete surgical removal of the tumour with R0 margins; adjuvant 
chemotherapy (methotrexate and bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, 
CDDP, doxorubicin, and ifosfamide) seems to be effective, 
however, no standard regimen has been established for extraskeletal 
osteosarcoma yet.

Heterogeneity of breast cancer surrogate subtype of primary 
tumour and local metastases
K. Konyshev*, S. Sazonov
*Institute of Medical Cell Technologies, Ural State Medical Uni-
versity, Russia
Background & objectives: Patterns of surrogate subtype change in 
breast cancer (BC) metastases stay unclear. This heterogeneity may be 
the reason of treatment effect decrease. Objective: to describe changes 
of surrogate subtype of breast cancer in regional metastases compared 
with primary tumour (PT).
Methods: Postoperative specimens of primary and metastatic 
tumours taken from 104 patients were examined using immunohis-
tochemistry (ER, PR, Her2/neu, Ki67) and SISH (HER2). Allred, 
ASCO/CAP 2013 and percentage of stained tumour cell nuclei sys-
tems were used. Surrogate subtypes of primary tumour and metas-
tasis were assessed according to St Gallen 2015 recommendations. 
Frequencies of subtype change in BC metastasizing were analysed.
Results: Primary tumour and metastasis subtypes were the same 
in 73 cases (70,2%, 95% CI 60,3-78,6%), discordant in 31 cases 
(29,8%, 95% CI 21,4-39,7%) (p<0,05, Fischer’s exact probability 
test). Among 52 cases with PT luminal A subtype metastasis 
had another subtype in 10 cases (19,2%, 95% CI 10,1-33,0%); 
among 16 cases with luminal B subtype – in 11 cases (68,7%, 
95% CI 41,5-87,9%); among 8 cases with HR+ Her2+ subtype 
– in 3 cases (37,5%, 95% CI 10,2-74,1%); among 8 cases with 
HR- Her2+ subtype – in 4 cases (50,0%, 95% CI 17,4-82,6%); 
among 20 cases with triple negative subtype – in 3 cases (15,0%, 
95% CI 4,0-38,9%).
Conclusion: Breast cancer primary and metastatic tumour 
surrogate subtype is concordant in the majority of cases in the 
whole sample. Subtype heterogeneity of metastatic and primary 
tumour has the highest frequency among cases with luminal B 
primary tumour subtype. Triple negative subtype is the most 
stable during regional metastasizing of breast cancer.

Two cases for a rare association; mixed tumour of the breast 
which contains acinic cell carcinoma and metaplastic carci-
noma components
K.E. Akar*, İ. Hotmanoğlu Şahin, H. Toper, H. Kaya
*Marmara University Pendik Training and Research Hospital 
Department of Pathology, Istanbul, Turkey
Background & objectives: Acinic cell carcinoma is a rare form of 
salivary gland-type breast cancer that shows indolent behaviour, in 
contrast to other triple-negative cancers. Metaplastic carcinoma is a 
term for breast cancers characterized by neoplastic cells differentiating 
into squamous or mesenchymal-looking components.
Methods: Case 1: 42 years-old female patient presented with a 
mass in the right breast. Trucut biopsy revealed metaplastic car-
cinoma. After chemotherapy, she underwent nipple sparing mas-
tectomy. In the resected specimen, tumour characterized by two 
distinct components was observed. In the one component, tumour 
was growing in infiltrative pattern with small acinar structures.
Case 2: 83 years-old female patient presented with a mass in 
the right breast. Trucut biopsy specimen revealed invasive 
carcinoma characterized by acinar structures. Tumour cells were 
characterized with granular and eosinophilic cytoplasm some of 
which contain zymogen granules.
Results: Tumour cells were characterized with monotonous 
round cells with granular and eosinophilic cytoplasm some 
of which contain zymogen granules. Immunohistochemically, 
neoplastic cells were positive for lysozyme and S100. In the 
other component, pleomorphic and discohesive tumour cells 
scattered in chondromyxoid matrix was observed. The case was 
reported as metaplastic carcinoma with acinic cell carcinoma. In 
NGS TP53(c.818G>A) and KRAS(c.351A>C) mutations were 
observed.
Immunohistochemically, neoplastic cells were positive for 
lysozyme, antichymotrypsin and S100. The case was reported 
as acinic cell carcinoma. In the resected specimen, acinic cell 
carcinoma was accompanied by large areas of metaplastic 
carcinoma with discohesive cells. In NGS TP53(c.488A>G) and 
PTEN(c.166_167del) mutations were observed.
Conclusion: Acinic cell carcinomas are usually seen in pure 
form, but in rare cases, they may be associated with high-grade 
triple-negative carcinoma component, such as metaplastic 
carcinoma.

A relapsing breast abscess – about a case
S. Antunes*, C. Dahlstedt Ferreira, R. Rosas, C. Pereira
*Hospital Garcia de Orta, Portugal
Background & objectives: Cystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis 
(CNGM) is a rare subtype of granulomatous mastitis with a highly 
distinct histological pattern often associated with Corynebacterium 
species, although evidence of corynebacterial infection can be diffi-
cult to prove.
Methods: A parous 29-year-old woman, an immigrant from 
Nepal living in Portugal for a year, presented in the emergency 
department with a painful tumefaction in right breast. 
Radiological investigation revealed an abscess and she was 
discharged with antibiotic therapy. Three days later she was 
submitted to abscess drainage and Corynebacterium species were 
isolated. During follow-up, a core needle biopsy was performed.
Results: Microscopically, the biopsy revealed breast parenchyma 
with an exuberant chronic granulomatous process, constituted by 
an inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, neu-
trophils, Langhans giant multinucleated cells, and well-formed 
granulomas with occasional central cystic spaces surrounded 
by neutrophils. In Gram stain rare bacillary structures were 
observed. PAS, Grocott and Ziehl-Neelsen were negative. Due 
to the relapsing nature of the abscess, she completed several 
antibiotic cycles and was posteriorly started on corticosteroids. 
Currently, she is asymptomatic.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of CNGM is often missed or delayed 
due to its rarity and many potential mimickers. Invasive carcinoma 
is the most important entity to consider in differential diagnosis, 
as both clinical presentation and radiological features can mimic

malignancy. A high index of suspicion is needed based on the rec-
ognition of characteristic histological features, to pursue fungal, 
mycobacterial, and bacterial organisms - especially gram-positive 
bacilli - within lipid vacuoles by using ancillary studies, such as 
Gram stains, and microbiological studies.

The impact of increased p53 expression on the clinical out-
come in hormone receptor positive breast cancer: a new useful 
biomarker?
M. Üner, H.G. Terzioglu*, K. Kösemehmetoglu, S. Aksoy, A. Üner
*Hacettepe University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Predicting the prognosis of breast cancer 
depends on interactions of various biological factors, one of which is 
p53. In this study, we aim to elucidate the relationship between p53 
and survival outcomes in oestrogen receptor-positive/HER2-negative 
breast cancer.
Methods: Slides obtained from tissue microarrays constructed 
using 3-mm cores of breast tumours from 122 patients were stained 
for p53. All tumours were scored by multiplying the percentage of 
p53 positive neoplastic cells with the staining intensity (weak:1 
moderate: 2 strong: 3) and the final scores were correlated with the 
clinical follow-up data to predict biological behaviour.
Results: The patient demographics were as follows: The mean 
age: 42 (range 22-92). Clinical stage of the patients: Stage I; 11 
(9.2%) Stage II: 53 (43.8%) and Stage III: 58 (47%). All of the 
patients received hormone receptor directed therapy, additionally 
108 patients received chemotherapy. The median follow-up time of 
the patients was approximately 50 months. The p53 scores ranged 
between 0 - 285. Twenty-seven of patients (22%) had a score of 0. 
Patients with a score of 60 or less (n=91) had a significantly better 
disease free and overall survival compared to the patients with a 
score higher than 60 (n=31) (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: A variety of methods/tests are used to predict prog-
nosis in breast cancer. However, in a world-wide perspective, most 
of them are not easily affordable. In exchange, surrogate markers, 
such as ki-67 etc., are more widely used for prognosis prediction. 
The expression of p53, evaluated by immunohistochemistry, could 
be a potential surrogate marker to predict clinical outcome in oes-
trogen receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.

Distant metastases from phyllodes tumours: a retrospective 
review from a single institution
J. Castro*, J. Azevedo, A. Coutada, J. Costa, C. Leal Barbosa, M. 
Afonso
*IPO Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Phyllodes tumours (PTs) are rare fibroepi-
thelial breast neoplasms. Distant metastases occur in about 2%, almost 
exclusively in malignant PTs (MPTs). We aim to provide an over-
view of metastases from PTs with emphasis in achieving an accurate 
diagnosis.
Methods: Retrospective analysis of all patients diagnosed with 
distant metastases from PTs in our institution between 2010 and 
2022. Evaluation of clinicopathologic features of both primary and 
metastatic tumours, including age at diagnosis, interval between 
primary and metastatic disease, site of metastasis, morphological 
features, immunohistochemical profile and interval between 
metastatic disease and death.
Results: From a total of 265 PTs, nine women with distant metas-
tases were identified. All had a MPT diagnosis, three after local 
recurrence of borderline PT. Mean age at metastasis diagnosis was 
58 years and mean interval between primary and metastatic dis-
ease was 21.5 months (range 6.0-50.9). Sites of distant metastases 
included lung (5), bone (2) and soft tissues (2). Metastases pre-
sented spindle cell (4), mixed (3), epitheliod (1) and pleomorphic 
(1) morphology. Heterologous elements were identified in two 
cases. Epithelial component was absent in all. No immunohisto-
chemical marker was helpful for differential diagnosis. Six patients 
died and mean interval between metastatic disease and death was 
11.6 months (range 0.9-39.4).
Conclusion: Distant metastasis of PTs are extremely rare and pre-
clude a dismal outcome. Diagnosis can be challenging given the 
absence of a specific morphological pattern and useful immunohis-
tochemical markers. Morphological comparison between primary 
and metastatic lesions remains the most reliable tool for an accurate 
diagnosis.

Hospital Ostrava and Faculty of Medicine; University of Ostrava, 
Department of histology and embryology, Faculty of Medicine, 
Masaryk University Brno, Institute of Animal Physiology and 
Genetics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic
Background & objectives: Lymphatic tissues, breast and skin are the 
sites most likely to cause metastases of lobular breast cancer. This 
retrospective observational study focuses on the assessment of rare 
metastases, which are a significant burden in terms of prognosis.
Methods: For the period 2000-2020, those metastatic lobular 
carcinomas that metastasized into uncommon areas were selected 
from the databases of two medical facilities (University Hospital 
Ostrava, CGB Laboratory) in Moravian-Silesian region. The work 
with the databases was preformed in the CGB laboratories during 
March 2022, followed by a statistical analysis of a total of 485 
patients.
Results: The average age of the 485 patients, all of whom were 
women, was 62.5 years, while the median was 63 years. There 
was no significant age difference between the cohorts of usual 
and rare metastases. 70 of all metastases (14.4%) were located out 
of the lymphatic tissue, breast or skin. The most frequent locali-
zations were following: stomach (1.65%), peritoneum, liver and 
bones (all 1.44%), ovaria (1.24%), omentum (0.82%) and fallopian 
tube (0.62%). Out of the other unique metastatic localizations can 
be mentioned for instance cerebellum, orbit, bronchus or adrenal 
gland.
Conclusion: Although the majority of lobular carcinomas metas-
tasize to the lymphatic system, skin, or breast, nearly every sixth 
metastatic location is unusual and may adversely affect the condi-
tion of patients. As a result, these areas should be considered in 
ordinary clinical practice.

Background & objectives: To understand the morphogenesis of breast 
cancers and non-malignant breast diseases, it is necessary to analyse 
the reorganization of two structurally and functionally interconnected 
tissue components such as parenchyma and stroma.
Methods: We present an analysis of the tumour extracellular 
matrix of 5 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type 
(IDC NST). The subject of the study was postoperative samples of 
5 breasts obtained from sectoral resection with lymph node dissec-
tion, for IDC NST. Histological study, IHC-study and transmission 
electrone microscopy was carried out.
Results: As a result of the study, it was found that the extracellular 
matrix of the IDC NST stroma contains a large number of thin and 
thick collagen fibrils concentrated in the perivascular tissue and 
in the foci of the desmoplastic reaction. Quite often, basement 
membranes are adjacent to the cytoplasm of carcinoma cells. In 
some foci, we found striated collagen fibres, as well as microfibrils 
shaped like an electron-dense rod. In most cases, the perivascu-
lar tissue resembled connective tissue containing sparse collagen 
fibres with fragments of proliferating vessels, areas of necrosis, and 
cells that can be regarded as fibroblasts and macrophages. Interest-
ing that we didn’t find pericytes in the capillaries.
Conclusion: Changes in the stroma during tumour progression 
consist in a decrease in the total amount of the non-fibrillar matrix 
in the background of increase in the amount of collagen and elastic 
fibres, and the appearance of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. 
Changes in the histoarchitectonics of the microcirculation are 
an integral part of tumour progression. Extracellular matrix 
is characterized by an increase in the number of pericyteless 
capillaries localized mainly in the periphery of the tumour and 
directed outward from the tumour.

*Department of pathology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, 
Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Ectopic breast tissue in the axillary region 
can give rise to tumoral conditions which are challenging to diagnose. 
This study aims to present a case of fibroadenoma (FA)of the axillary 
region revealing an ectopic breast tissue, mimicking an adnexal gland 
tumour clinically.
Methods: A 25-year-old female without past medical history pre-
sented with a mass in her left axilla evolving for 4 years. On clini-
cal examination, the mass was firm, freely mobile, and completely 
isolated from the left breast. Ultrasound showed a solid, oval, het-
erogeneous, hypoechoic node measuring 2*1cm. The ultrasound-
mammogram was normal. The mass was excised and addressed for 
a histopathology examination
Results: On gross examination, the mass was firm with the bos-
selated surface, whitish. The serial sectioning was homogeneous. 
Histological examination showed that the mass was composed of 
2 components: epithelial and mesenchymal. The mesenchymal 
component is made of hyaline connective tissue with uniform cel-
lularity. The epithelial component is made of stretched ducts lined 
by a double cellular layer without atypia. The diagnosis of fibroad-
enoma in the axillary accessory breast was retained.
Conclusion: A mass of the axillary region is a common clinical 
presentation. The most frequent diagnoses are lymph node 
malignancy followed by sweat gland tumours. FA in the axillary 
region is a rare disorder representing a diagnostic dilemma. 
confused with other benign or malignant pathologies. It most 
commonly affects adult women aged in the 3rd and 4th decade 
of life. Imaging is not contributive. Pathological examination is 
mandatory to rule out another differential diagnosis, especially 
malignancies.

A rare case of metaplastic carcinoma with neuroendocrine 
differentiation
S. Bakhiet*, A. Behzadnia, A. Elhag
*Hull University Hospitals NHS Trust, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Metaplastic breast carcinomas represent a 
heterogeneous group of carcinomas with epithelial and mesenchymal 
components. Primary neuroendocrine breast carcinoma is an exceed-
ingly rare entity. Here we describe the first reported case of metaplastic 
breast carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation.
Methods: A 60-year-old lady was found to have a suspicious nodule 
in her left breast, measuring 19mm on radiology. Following the core 
biopsy, a diagnosis of malignancy was made, and she proceeded to have 
a wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy.
Results: Histological examination of the specimen showed an 
infiltrative solid tumour, composed of predominantly tightly packed 
small basophilic cells, with stippled nuclear chromatin, inconspicuous 
nucleoli growing in sheets, with large areas of necrosis and apoptotic 
debris. Admixed with these undifferentiated neoplastic blue cells were 
small clusters of epithelioid groups showing squamous differentiation. 
The undifferentiated blue cells showed a neuroendocrine carcinoma 
phenotype with AE1/3, CK7, CD56 and synaptophysin positivity as 
well as basal marker positivity (CK5/6, p63 and CK14). The epithelioid 
component was also AE1/3, CK7 and CAM5.2 positive with no 
neuroendocrine differentiation. Based on the immunomorphological 
features a diagnosis of triple-negative metaplastic carcinoma with 
neuroendocrine differentiation was made.
Conclusion: Metaplastic carcinomas have monomorphic or bipha-
sic epithelial and mesenchymal components. Identifying in-situ 
components can aid the diagnosis, as in this case. Primary neu-
roendocrine tumour of the breast is an extremely rare entity, that 
requires clinicoradiological correlation to exclude metastasis, and 
in view of this case, may also require exclusion of metaplastic 
carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation.

New perspectives in cardiac surgery: electrical DC tensions 
implements morphologic patterning in chick heart embryo 
model
A. Capuani*
*Private Organization Carrara, Italy
Background & objectives: Cell polarity and electrotaxis play an 
important role in cardiac embryogenesis and on genes expression to 
specific phenotypes. Chemical and physical electrodynamic laws direct 
the bioelectric endogenous fields. (Faraday 1831, Henry 1832, Maxwell 
1865, Wolpert 2015, Levin 2017).
Methods: We designed devices A and B:
A- A passive two terminal condenser storing an uniform 800 mV / mm 
electric field. Inside we accommodated 30 fertilized eggs for 52 hours 
after laying (gastrulation, looping, septation) inverting the polarity.
B- A second device /same Electrical Field, to treat 7 fertilized 
cockerels during the egg passage in the oviduct (germinal disk, 
blastula, gastrula).
Results: In group A we observed 4 giant Omphaloceles (18 %).

B, 42.8 % of eggs did not progress with an overall mortality of 
57 % suggesting a very high interference of the applied EF on the 
embryogenetic process (genes expression in primary heart tube and 
other organs lateralization - rotation process).
Conclusion: 1- Dc electrical forces of 800 mV / mm affect the 
endogenous fields during the overall chick embryogenesis. 2-It is 
possible, applying external Electrical Fields, to interfere on the 
heart embryogenetic process, what we refer as Molecular Cardiac 
Surgery. We present devices and procedures.

S. Glumac
*University of Belgrade, Medical Faculty, Institute for Pathology, 
Serbia
Background & objectives: Intimal sarcoma (IS) is exceptionally rare 
primary mesenchymal neoplasm arising from the intima of great ves-
sels, most commonly pulmonary artery and thoracic aorta, while heart 
is secondary involved. Heart chambers, as the primary site of IS origin, 
are extremely rare.
Methods: Comparative histopathological and immunohistochemi-
cal analysis of antemortem removed left atrium (LA) tumour, and 
postmortem sampled periadventially invaded right upper pulmo-
nary vein.
Results: We present a case of a 42-year-old male who was admitted 
to the Clinic for cardiovascular surgery due to LA tumour clinically 
assessed as myxoma, and died a day after surgery due to acute 
myocardial infarction. Intraoperatively, tumour showed infiltrative 
growth, with invasion and destruction of mitral valve which was 
removed. Autopsy revealed invasion of upper right pulmonary 
vein, as well as deposits around distal branches. Histopathological 
analysis showed hypercellular highly pleomorphic spindle-cell 
neoplasm with fascicular and storiform growth pattern, necrosis, 
and vascular invasion. Tumour expressed diffuse vimentin and 
MDM2 positivity, single cells expressed CD31, CD34, ERG 
and Desmin, while cytokeratin AE1/AE3 expression was absent, 
corresponding to IS immunophenotype.
Conclusion: Primary cardial IS are extremely rare tumours, thus 
their initial unspecific clinical and radiological presentation could 
be confused with other cardiac tumours which are more common 
and benigan, like myxomas. Since IS is aggressive and invasive 
neoplasm, a complete surgical excision is usually impossible, and 
having in mind that radio- and chemotherapy modalities are of low 
success, the prognosis of IS at the moment of diagnosis remains 
poor.

Center for Environment, Genetics and Oncobiology, Faculty of 
Medicine, University of Coimbra; University Hospital Anatomical 
Pathology Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Early macroscopic diagnosis (12-24 
hours) of Myocardial Infarction (MI) is challenging to Pathologists 
and macroscopic/microscopic observation in necropsies depends on 
the interval time between acute ischaemic onset and death. Biomarkers 
expression was searched in two MI evolutional phases.
Methods: 43 MI samples retrieved from autopsies (IAP-PM/INM-
LCF archives) were evaluated by two Pathologists. The follow-
ing panel CD15, C9, C5b9, IL-15, Gal-3, and Fibronectin global 
expression was registered and submitted to statistical analysis - 
SPSSv27 and Mann-Whitney/Kruskal-Wallis tests to score differ-
ent MI phases; ROC curves determined the best cut-off value for 
differentiating early (<3 days) from old (≥ 3 days) MI.
Results: Neutrophils were considered grosso modo as MI 
classifier dating over three days since the clinical ischaemic 
coagulation necrosis onset. Two study groups were registered. 
CD15 (U=41,500; p<0,001; N=43) and complement fraction 
C9 (U=42,000; p<0,001; N=43) demonstrated significantly 
higher global expression (intensity of expression x percentage of 
positivity) in early MIs (<3 days) cases. Global expression cut-
off of 105 for CD15 and 85 for C9 associated with Se and Sp of 
0,875/0,818 and 0,875/0,600, respectively, for distinguishing old 
MI (>3 days) from early MIs. The other biomarkers were irrelevant 
due to similar expression in considered old and early MI.
Conclusion: MI keeps being one of leading causes of death world-
wide and Clinicians claim correct dating for therapy adjustment

Inflammation, media degeneration and atherosclerosis during 
ascending aortitis
I. Kholová*, E. Hermonen, A. Mennander, T. Paavonen
*Fimlab Laboratories, Finland
Background & objectives: Aortitis may be present during ascending 
aortic dilatation and dissection. Histologically, the aortic wall reveals 
inflammation, media degeneration and atherosclerosis. We quanti-
fied aortic wall histology in surgically treated patients with ascending 
aortitis.
Methods: Ascending aortic wall inflammation, media degeneration 
and atherosclerosis were graded according to the AECVP-SCVP 
guidelines in 42 patients (25 males:17 females, mean age 68 
years, range 58-75 years). At least six samples from each aorta 
were evaluated using Haematoxylin-Eosin, Alcian Blue-Periodic 
Acid-Schiff, Verhoef-van Gieson stained sections and CD3, CD68, 
CD20, CD38 and SMA immunohistochemistry.
Results: Inflammatory infiltrate was lympho-plasmacytic in 32 
(74%) cases. Mixed inflammatory pattern was diagnosed in five 
(12%) cases, granulomatous pattern in four (9%) and suppurative 
in two (5%). IgG/IgG4 disease was detected in two (6%) cases 
together with lympho-plasmacytic infiltrate. Overall degenera-
tion was mild in three (7%), moderate in 16 (37%) and severe in 
24 (56%) cases. Various degree of atherosclerosis encompassed 
all specimens. Severe atherosclerosis was most common (n=19 
(44%)), of which three included plaque disruptions and eight calci-
fied plaques. There were ten (23%) cases of mild atherosclerosis 
and 14 (33%) moderate atherosclerosis.
Conclusion: Various degree of aortic wall inflammation, media 
degeneration and atherosclerosis were often present during surgi-
cally treated aortitis. Notably, a lympho-plasmacytic inflamma-
tory pattern occurred in three quarters of the patients with aortitis,

K. Tlili, B. Laabidi
*Department of Pathology, Military Hospital of Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Chondrosarcomas are malignant mesen-
chymal tumours which account for 20% of malignant bone tumours. 
Local recurrences and metastases are often encountered. Through this 
case, we aim to present an unusual case of chondrosarcoma metastasis 
in the heart.
Methods: We, hereby, present a case of cardiac metastasis of a 
chondrosarcoma.
Results: A 58 year old female patient operated on for left iliac 
chondrosarcoma few days earlier, presented with chest pain and 
dyspnea. A Chest-Tomography-Scan was performed and revealed 
not only pulmonary lesions but also an intra-cardiac mass. 
The decision was to remove the cardiac mass surgically. Gross 
examination showed a myxoid arborescent lesion. Histopathological 
examination showed a malignant cartilaginous proliferation. It was 
arranged in diffuse sheets of dense cartilaginous tissue with areas 
of necrosis. The tumour cells had atypical, hyperchromatic and 
enlarged nuclei. Some cells were binucleated. The diagnosis was 
consistent with cardiac metastasis of a chondrosarcoma.
Conclusion: Chondrosarcoma is a malignant bone tumour with 
often an indolent course. The prognosis is favourable after com-
plete surgical resection. However, hematogenous spread, most 
commonly to the lungs has a poor prognosis. Chondrosarcoma’s 
cardiac metastasis is extremely rare. The diagnosis is challenging 
and requires multimodality approach guided by clinical context. 
The diagnosis of certainty is based on hispathologic examination.

A rare cardiac neoplasm: case report of a cardiac angiosar-
coma, review of literature
E.B. Balaban*, M. Çıkrıkçıoğlu, Y.K. Akgök, B. Ketenci, F. Aker
*Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital, Department 
of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Primary cardiac malignancies are rare. 
Although angiosarcomas are rare soft tissue tumours, they are the most 
common primary cardiac malignancy.
Methods: In this study, we present a case of primary cardiac angio-
sarcoma in a 24-year-old female patient. The patient presented with 
complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. Following clinical and 
radiological evaluation, primary cardiac mass was surgically removed.
Results: Pathological examination revealed a mesenchymal tumour 
with areas of haemorrhage and necrosis, solid and vessel-like areas, 
composed of atypical cells. Immunohistochemical examination 
showed diffuse and strong staining with CD31, ERG and FLI1. 
With these findings, it was diagnosed as angiosarcoma. Although 
our case was limited to the heart during surgery, lung and pleural 
metastases were arisen in the postoperatively 5th month despite 
chemotherapy. Currently she is in the postoperatively 10th month 
and her follow-up is continued.
Conclusion: Cardiac angiosarcomas have a poor prognosis and a 
fatal course, because they are metastatic at the time of diagnosis 
and show rapid progression. Early diagnosis and surgical resection 
can improve the survival.

Romanov, T. Bezuglova, T. Sotnikova, M. Mnikhovich
*Central Pathology Laboratory, Research Institute of Human Mor-
phology, Russia
Background & objectives: COVID-19 is a new respiratory viral 
disease caused by a Sars-Cov-2 virus. According to recent research 
massive vasculitis leading to thrombosis is a typical feature of COVID-
19. Blood clots can be found in different parts of the vasculature.
Methods: We present a new method consisting of assessment of throm-
bosed vessels of upper and lower limbs. This method applied on 4 upper 
and 5 lower limbs that were amputated due to critical ischemia caused by 
thrombosis associated with Sars-CoV-2 virus. Non-fixated material was 
frozen with the temperature -15°C and cutted in steps of 5 cm by band saw 
machine JWBS-10S.
Results: During the research, accurate cuts of the upper and 
lower limbs with a thickness of 5 cm were obtained. Usage of 
a band saw machine allows us to observe exactly thrombogenic 
complications on every limb. On each of them, sections of vessels 
filled with thrombotic masses were doubtlessly visible. Such 
pathomorphological changes caused extensive critical ischemia. 
Multiple areas of necrotic muscle tissue were also revealed.
Conclusion: In this article we have presented a new method of an 
assessment of thrombogenic complications caused by Sars-Cov-2 
virus. This approach can expand pathomorphological practice and 
may substitute the method of layer-by-layer study of muscles, fas-
cia and vessels. Acute thrombosis may lead to severe ischimization 
of any limb that provokes its necrosis. Gross anatomy observa-
tion of thrombotic masses based on N.I. Pirogov’s cutting method 
allows to estimate thrombosis on different locuses of upper and 
lower limbs more precisely.

Universal model for advanced macroscopic assessment of acute 
myocardial injuries
S. Mozgovoi*, E. Klyuchnikova, A. Zolotov, E. Abrosimova, O. 
Korpacheva
*Omsk State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: Currently existing laboratory models lack 
a clear algorithm for selecting a myocardial tissue site for histological 
and/or immunohistochemical examination to detect tissue reactions and 
obtain a result linked with prevalence and their ratios in the various 
areas of myocardium tissue.
Methods: The experiments were carried out on 15 white male rats. 
Three groups of 5 animals were formed. In animals of 1 group, 
myocardial contusion was reproduced. In the second group, the 
mechanical occlusion of the coronary was reproduced by ligating 
the anterior intraventricular artery. In the third group, the ischemic 
imbalance was reproduced by administration of isoprenaline.
Results: Nitro blue tetrazolium chloride confidently differentiated 
the damage zones of myocardium in animals of all groups, which 
allowed to calculate its total area. In the first group of animals, 
the myocardial damage zone within 24 hours of the myocardial 
contusion simulation captured the intraventricular septum and the 
anterior walls of the left and right ventricles equally, which was

largely consistent with the projection of the impact. In the second 
group of animals, the damage area was located in the region of the 
disturbed coronary blood flow. In the third group of animals, the 
damage sites were diffused in the myocardium of both ventricles 
and ventricular septum.
Conclusion: The approach helps to identify areas of myocardial 
damage regardless of their nature (traumatic, ischemic-hypoxic, 
secondary-metabolic). Since the proposed model for identifying 
sites of myocardial injury is universal, it can be successfully 
used to identify candidate zones for morphological examination, 
including for immunohistochemical studies to assess severity, 
localization and ratio of tissue autophagy and apoptosis reactions 
in altered myocardium. The model allows the selection of heart 
tissue fragments for examination in the alteration zone and adjacent 
areas of intact myocardium.

Strongyloides stercoralis: a rare case diagnosed with oesopha-
geal swab sample
A.H. Aydin*, B. Bayazit Gözüküçük, N. Turhan
*Ankara City Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Strongyloides stercoralis (S.s.) is an intes-
tinal nematode which might involve different systems. Although the 
infection caused by S.s. is usually asymptomatic, in immunocompro-
mised host it could be severe and fatal. We presented a case that diag-
nosed with oesophageal swab sample.
Methods: A 70 year old man with pneumoconiosis, applied to 
hospital with oral intake disorder. Endoscopic examination was 
performed. Because of diffuse ulcers on oesophagus only one 
swab sample could be obtained. On this sample larvae and soils 
were observed. It was reported to clinic that may correspond to 
S. stercoralis, then another esophagogastroduodenoscopy was 
performed. Many biopsies were conducted on.
Results: This samples exhibited chronic inflammation and distor-
tions of gland architecture. In crypt lumens, eggs as aggregations 
with basophilic granular appearance and typical larva structure 
with sharply ended tails were seen. Concurrent fresh sampling from 
gastric and oesophageal fluid studied by spreading between slides 
was examined with biopsies. The biopsy and swab samples were 
evaluated as compatible with S. s.
Conclusion: Infected individuals with S.s. are usually 
asymptomatic. However, it may cause a hyperinfection syndrome 
in immunocompromised hosts. Furthermore, this scenario may 
be severe and has a high mortality risk. It can be prevented by 
detecting infection in asymptomatic individuals. Particularly in 
risk groups that have history of travel endemic zones or begin using 
immunosuppressive agents can be scanned.

Metastatic malignant mixed germ cell tumour of the epigas-
trium as a primary incidental finding: a rare case presentation
N. Katsoulas, D. Goutas, A. Sykaras*, I. Zyli, I.S. Papanikolaou, 
E. Politi
*Department of Pathology, Evangelismos General Hospital, Ath-
ens, Greece
Background & objectives: Germ cell tumours (GCTs) constitute a 
rare and diverse group of neoplastic entities. They affect mainly young 
people and arise from primordial germ cells. We present a rare case 
of metastatic malignant GCT to the epigastrium, diagnosed by EUS-
FNA cytology.
Methods: A 57-year-old male, with a history of weight loss and 
abdominal pain, presents with a 16-cm lymph node block in the 
epigastric region, accompanied by enlarged mediastinal and peri-
pancreatic lymph nodes, and a 2-cm mass in the body of pancreas, 
as detected on CT scans. His laboratory tests were normal, except 
for elevated LDH levels.
Results: With the clinical impression of lymphoma, an EUS-
FNA of the mass was performed. FNA smears revealed highly 
atypical pleomorphic cells, lying singly or in loose clusters in a 
haemorrhagic and necrotic background with many lymphocytes. 
Immunocytochemical evaluation showed strong and diffuse 
positivity of malignant cells for SALL-4, PLAP, OCT-4, a-FP, 
focal positivity for AE1/AE3 and CK7, and Ki67 index > 80%. 
The final diagnosis of a metastatic malignant germ cell tumour was 
rendered. Since there was no known history of testicular tumour, a 
thorough evaluation of the gonads was advised, for identification 
of the primary lesion.
Conclusion: GCTs are an uncommon group of heterogeneous 
tumours including both benign and malignant neoplasms. They 
are categorized into germinomatous and non-germinomatous types, 
affecting mainly the gonads of young patients. The uncommon 
mixed GCTs are constituted of two or more types of malignant 
primitive or germ cell components, accounting for approximately 
8% of all malignant GCTs.

Pancreatic metastasis of multiple myeloma diagnosed by EUS-
FNA: report of a rare case
I. Zyli, A. Sykaras*, N. Katsoulas, D. Goutas, I.S. Papanikolaou, 
E. Politi
*Department of Pathology, Evangelismos General Hospital, Ath-
ens, Greece
Background & objectives: Multiple myeloma (MM) metastases to 
pancreas, as a secondary extramedullary disease (EMD), is a rare 
occurrence with less than 300 cases reported in the literature, and only 
2,3% in autopsies.
Methods: A 68-year-old female, with a past history of MM 5 
years ago, presented to our hospital with obstructive jaundice. 
Abdominal contrasted CT scan detected a non-homogenous mass 
in the head of the pancreas (2,5 cm), fat stranding, peripancre-
atic fluid collection and swelling of the regional lymph nodes 
(<1cm).
Results: An ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) 
of the pancreatic mass revealed infiltration by a population of 
monotonous neoplastic plasma cells with characteristic eccentri-
cally placed nuclei and abundant cytoplasm, mainly arranged in 
compact nests. Immunocytochemistry was performed taking into 
consideration patient’s history. The neoplastic cells were positive 
for CD138, MUM-1, CD79a and kappa light chain and negative for 
CD3, CD20 and lambda light chain. Morphology and immunocy-
tochemistry profile lead to a diagnosis consistent with metastasis 
of MM to the pancreas.
Conclusion: Pancreatic metastasis from MM are rare but despite 
their rarity they should be considered in the differential diagnosis 
of obstructive jaundice and primary pancreatic neoplasms. There-
fore, a detailed medical history in combination with immunocyto-
chemical findings are paramount for the diagnosis. Extramedullary 
involvement is one of the indicators of poor prognosis. There is no 
consensus in treatment options and their efficacy.

Immunocytochemistry-assisted diagnosis of solid pseudopapil-
lary neoplasm of the pancreas in a young man
A. Sykaras*, I. Zyli, D. Goutas, N. Katsoulas, I.S. Papanikolaou, 
E. Politi
*Department of Pathology, Evangelismos General Hospital, Ath-
ens, Greece
Background & objectives: Solid Pseudopapillary Neoplasm (SPN) 
of the pancreas represents a very rare, low-malignant potential tumour 
that usually occurs in young females. Cytological diagnosis of SPN is 
straight-forward in typical cases but immunocytochemistry is required 
in material with unusual cytological features.
Methods: A 38-year-old man presented with a partially cystic 
pancreatic mass measuring 1,6cm on maximum dimension and 
localized in the uncinate process, an incidental finding on abdominal 
MRI. Endoscopic Ultrasound Fine Needle Aspiration (EUS-FNA) was 
performed to obtain material from the lesion. ThinPrep prepared slides 
and hematoxylin-eosin stained cell block sections were examined. 
Additionally, immunocytochemistry was performed on cell block 
sections.
Results: The neoplastic cells were uniform and bland, with nuclei 
with granular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. They were 
arranged in loose clusters without forming papillary structures. 
Hyaline globules were not identified. The morphological features 
did not allow the challenging differential diagnosis between 
SPN and well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumour (NET). 
Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that neoplastic cells 
were strongly positive for vimentin, PR, synaptophysin, CD56, 
CD10 and LEF-1 whereas the expression of pan-cytokeratin AE1/
AE3 was weak and focal. Importantly, the tumour cells displayed 
nuclear immunopositivity to β-catenin and were negative for 
chromogranin expression. Additionally, the proliferation marker 
Ki-67 was extremely low. The immunoprofile complemented 
the cytomorphologic findings and established the confident 
diagnosis of SPN.
Conclusion: This challenging case illustrates the difficulty in 
diagnosing pancreatic SPN with atypical features. Patient’s gender 
and the tumour location (head instead of body or tail of pancreas) 
were not suggestive of SPN. Given that the typical cytological 
features of SPN were not present and the morphological overlap 
between SPN and NET, a broad immunohistochemical panel was 
required for correct diagnosis. The patient underwent the Whipple 
surgical procedure and histological examination of the resected 
specimen confirmed the diagnosis of SPN.

Cytomorphological and clinical features of desmoplastic small 
round cell tumour in peritoneal effusion
S. Erdogan-Durmus*, D. Tolga, H. Bilgi
*Department of Pathology, Prof. Dr. Cemil Tascioglu City Hospi-
tal, Istanbul, Turkey
Background & objectives: Desmoplastic small round cell tumour 
(DSRCT) is a rare lethal malignant tumour which affects predominantly 
young males. The majority of cases arise in the abdominopelvic region. 
Here a case of DSRCT infiltration in peritoneal effusion was presented.
Methods: A 41-year-old male patient presented complaining of 
abdominal pain - swelling, and losing weight for a while. Perito-
neal fluid and 22 cm sized mass were detected in abdominopel-
vic region. The sampling was made from the free fluid and mass 
(trucut biopsy). A PAP staining slide and a cell block obtained 
from peritoneal fluid by prepared with liquid-based cytology (Sure-
path, BD®).
Results: Cytologic examination of the peritoneal fluid demon-
strated a very hypercellular lesion which consist of small round 
tumour cells with scant cytoplasm, round or kidney or hearth 
shaped nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli. Nuclear molding was 
usually present. Mitotic figures, numerous crushed nuclei, and 
apoptosis were frequently seen. In the immunohistochemical 
examination of cell block tumour cells were positive for Vimen-
tin, PanCK, Desmin, WT1 and negative for BerEp4, CD45, CD99, 
CDK4, Calretinin. Ki67 proliferation index was %75-80 in tumour 
cells. The microscopic examination of trucut biopsy showed similar 
features. With these findings the case was reported as "DSRCT 
infiltration in peritoneal effusion".
Conclusion: Cytologic diagnosis of DSRCT infiltration to the 
effusions is a rare entity. In differential diagnosis other small 
round cell tumours such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma/
PNET, neuroblastoma, also lymphoma should be considered. 
The immunohistochemical studies on cell blocks helps in the 
differential diagnosis.

Comprehensive comparative assessment of the whole slide 
images of cytologic samples for quality assurance program in 
Korea
Y. Chong*, S.A. Hong, H.K. Oh, S.J. Jung, B. Kim, J.Y. Jeong, 
H.C. Lee, G. Gong
*The Catholic University of Korea, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: The Korean Society for Cytopathology first 
introduced a digital proficiency test in 2021. However, there are still 
many doubtful opinions whether digitally scanned images can present 
subtle differences of nuclear features and chromatin patterns of cyto-
logic samples satisfactorily or not.
Methods: We performed a comprehensive comparative assessment 
of the whole slide images of 12 various cytologic slides using five 
different scanners with various scanning conditions. The scanner 
specification such as capacity, z-stacking, file formats, size, scan 
time, and error rate were assessed. Four cytopathologists assessed 
the image quality using the questionnaire on focus, colour balance, 
nuclear/cytoplasmic/chromatin features, etc.
Results: 3DHistech Panoramic 250 Flash was the best in terms 
of image quality, feature presentation, and error rate for most 
cytologic samples. Hamamatsu NanoZoomer 360 was the best 
in terms of scanning speed and weekly capacity. Both 3DHistech 
and Hamamatsu models provide extended focus function that 
saves storage and server capacity. Although Leica AT-2 showed 
comparable performance in image quality to 3DHistech Panoramic 
250 Flash, the scanning speed and error rate were relatively poor. 
As Roche and Philips models do not provide a z-stacking function, 
it is least recommended for cytologic samples.
Conclusion: As 3-dimensional clusters are common and nuclear/
chromatin features are critical for cytologic interpretation, care-
ful selection of scanners and optimal conditions are mandatory in 
cytologic practice.

*Hospital Garcia de Orta, E.P.E, Portugal
Background & objectives: Acinar cell carcinomas are rare malig-
nant epithelial neoplasms, arising from the exocrine acinar tissue, with 
poorly defined pathogenesis. Males are more commonly affected and 
presenting symptoms are related to tumour growth. We present a case 
report on this rare entity.
Methods: We received a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) sample from 
a 57 year-old man with a pancreactic isthmic mass. On endoscopic 
ultrasound, a 5,8cm lesion, partially solid and partially cystic was 
found, without signs of vascular invasion or signs of regional 
lymph node metastasis. We performed the analysis on stained sam-
ples with PAP, MGG and a cellblock.
Results: The sample was moderately cellular, with red blood cells 
and trabecular formations, with pseudorosette formations, syncyt-
ial cytoplasm with round and monotonous nuclei, with occasional 
nucleoli. Mitosis figures were observed and necrosis was absent. 
On cellblock evaluation, immunohistochemistry was performed. 
The lesion was positive for CK AE1/AE3, CK7, Trypsin, PAS/D 
and negative for CK20, CD56, NSE, Synaptofysin, Chromogra-
nin, Beta-catenin (membrane staining). This was compatible with 
a pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (Category VI – Malignant, The 
Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology System for Reporting Pan-
creatobiliary Cytology).
Conclusion: Acinar cell carcinoma has a poor prognosis, with 
approximately 50% of the patients have metastatic disease 
at presentation and a 5-year survival rate of 25%. Although 
aggressive, it appears to have a better prognosis than conventional 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. It is a rare entity without any 
hallmark genetic alteration, and we present this case to shed a 
light on the importance of immunohistochemistry and markers 
like trypsine while diagnosing this type of lesions, as well as the 
morphological aspects.

Pure bullous pyoderma gangrenosum, a challenging clinico-
pathological diagnosis - critical literature review with emphasis 
on diagnostic criteria
P. García Abellás*, B. Díaz Guimaraens, A. Ferrer Gómez, R. Car-
rillo Gijón
*Ramón y Cajal University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: Pyoderma gangrenosum is an uncom-
mon neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by large necrotic ulcers. 
Occasionally patients develop atypical presentations, including bullous 
lesions. Only eighteen pure cases of Bullous Pyoderma gangrenosum 
have been described. Our aim is highlight distinctive clinical and patho-
logical features.
Methods: We describe a case of Bullous pyoderma gangrenosum 
in a 76-year-old man, with active oncological history, including a 
recent diagnosis of hairy cell leukaemia. We have carried out an 
exhaustive review of the literature where clinical and pathological 
details of the lesions are absent or very scant. Furthermore, many 
of the cases reported were mixed variants.
Results: Clinically, our case supposed a challenging differ-
ential diagnosis due to atypical clinical presentation that mim-
icked necrotizing fasciitis. The purple blistering appearance of 
the lesions in the setting of a patient with multiple treatments, 
raised the possibility of an adverse drug reaction. Nevertheless, 
the exacerbation of the large plaque after surgical procedures was 
a clear sign of pathergy. Histologically, there was partial preserva-
tion of the epidermis, subepidermal vesiculation and neutrophilic 
exocytosis. A massive neutrophilic infiltrate filled the dermis and 
hypodermis without vasculitis or any sign of specific infection. 
The patient was treated with diverse intravenous antibiotics and 
several surgical procedures without improvement. Finally healed 
after gradual weaning from immunosuppressive therapy.
Conclusion: The variety of clinical manifestations and it´s non-
specific histology, make Bullous pyoderma gangrenosum a chal-
lenging diagnosis. A good clinicopathological correlation, always 
in the setting of complementary tests, it´s crucial for accurate the 
diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a 
strong clinical suspicion in a patient with rapidly progressive, non-
infectious blisters that worsens after surgical procedures in the 
context of an hematologic disorder and G-CSF treatment (described 
as possible triggers).

N. Krystalidis, I. Dimitriadis, P. Karkos
*Laboratory of Pathology, Forensic Service of Thessaloniki, 
Greece
Background & objectives: Telangiectasia is an excessive permanent 
dilation of superficial blood vessels in the skin. The development of 
telangiectasia in the final blood vessels of dermal tumours is uncom-
mon. The characteristics of the lesion are described and a literature 
review is attempted.
Methods: We present a case of a 16-year-old woman who reports 
the presence of a dark spot on her submandibular area for years. 
The last six months report alteration of the mole hue, mainly in the 
central areas. The dermatological examination shows a round lump 
with clear peripheral boundaries and a brownish uneven appearance 
and a surgical removal is decided.
Results: The surgical specimen consists of a fusiform part of skin 
with a surface of dimensions 1.5X1 cm and a thickness of 0.8 cm. 
In the middle of the free surface there is a hemispherical protrud-
ing dark skin formation (tumour) with a larger diameter of 0.8 
cm. Histologically it shows an image of a compound nevus, in the 
central area of which lesions compatible with telangiectasia are 
found. In particular, dilated thin-walled vessels are found, which 
do not form a formation but grow between the cells of the nevus, 
and their lumen is filled with blood elements.
Conclusion: Telangiectasia can be an isolated phenomenon or 
as part of a generalized disorder. Secondary development may be 
caused by external forces such as scratching, trauma, radiation, 
infection etc. The distinction between a primary and a secondary 
lesion is not always clear. The bleeding is considered the most 
important complication of the lesion and when it develops in 
dermal tumours it causes unusual macroscopic alterations of the 
structure in which it grows, which can create clinical differential 
diagnostic problems.

Background & objectives: Instersticial Mycosis Fungoides (IMF) is a 
rare histological variant of Mycosis Fungoides that may mimic inflam-
matory dermatoses as granuloma annulare, morphea and interstitial 
granulomatous dermatitis. The cases of IMF from our institution have 
been reviewed in order to characterize it.
Methods: Four cases diagnosed with Interstitial Mycosis Fungoi-
des (IMF). All clinical, histopathologic and immunohistochemi-
cal variables were collected. All of them were men, with a mean 
age of 61 years old (range 42-80) with previous diagnosis of 
classic MF and clinical symptoms of poikiloderma and plaque.
Results: Three patients presented annular lesions and nodules 
after two and four years of follow-up in one and two cases, 
respectively, which were biopsied. The fourth patient started 
with chronic purpura pigmentosa lesions and after six years 
of evolution, the annular lesions also appeared. In all cases, a 
perivascular and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate was observed, 
accompanied by macrophages (CD163 positive). These were 
arranged in a palisade, simulating a granuloma annulare. Mucin 
deposition was also observed. The lymphoid infiltrate was CD4 
positive. TCR-gamma gene was rearranged in all the cases, 
showing a monoclonal population.
Conclusion: -Diagnosis of IMF is challenging, as it mimics 
granuloma annulare clinically and histologically.
-In cases with previous MF, IMF is associated with clinical 
modifications.
-IMFs display a double population of lymphocytes and mac-
rophages, which makes them difficult to observe/distinguish.
- It is necessary to know this rare variant in order to recognize it.

Background & objectives: Atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) and pleo-
morphic dermal sarcoma (PDS) are unusual cutaneous tumours. The 
molecular profile of the rare clear cell (cc) variant is unknown. We 
present key morphologic and molecular features of two ccAFX and 
ccPDS cases.
Methods: Total genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded tumour tissue and next generation sequenc-
ing (NGS) was performed using the TruSight Oncology 500 assay 
(Illumina, CA, USA). This platform enables profiling of 523 genes 
for identification of DNA variants, quantification of microsatellite 
instability (MSI), and tumour mutational burden (TMB). Variant 
annotation was performed using the Molecular Tumour Board Por-
tal (MTBP).
Results: Both tumours presented as nodular lesions on the scalp of 
elderly males. Microscopically, they comprised intradermal sheets 
of cells with abundant pale to clear cytoplasm, severely pleomorphic 
nuclei, and frequent mitoses. The ccPDS extended into the deep 
subcutis. Neoplastic cells expressed CD10 strongly and diffusely and 
lacked expression of other markers. Both tumours showed high TMB 
(ccAFX: 67.9mt/mb; ccPDS: 105.3mt/mb) and no significant MSI. 
Loss-of-function mutations in the TP53, CDKN2A, and NOTCH1 
genes were detected in both cases, similarly to other AFX and PDS 
variants. TERT promoter and NOTCH2 mutations were present in the 
ccAFX case only whereas an APC mutation was present in ccPDS. No 
tumour recurrence was observed.
Conclusion: Clear cell AFX and PDS seem to share fundamental molecular 
driver events. Their molecular profile is also similar to that described in 
more common variants. Whilst no unique mutational profile was identi-
fied in our cases, presence of the genetic abnormalities described herein 
may increase the level of confidence in diagnosing these lesions. Adverse 
histologic features such as tumour necrosis, lymphovascular invasion, and 
extension into deep subcutis still remain essential for distinction between 
AFX and PDS.

Eruptive junctional melanocytic naevi associated with cutane-
ous mastocytosis, a rare case report
F. Kubba*, A.T. Gradassi
*Department of Pathology, Ealing Hospital, London North West 
University Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: A 32 year old Caucasian male presented 
with red maculopapular rashes following psychological stress, triggered 
by alcohol, coffee and hot water exposure, distributed all over the body 
and subside leaving red papules. No diarrhoea, headaches or flushing 
symptoms were reported.
Methods: There was dermographism and macular rashes induced 
by scratching on the abdomen, back and arms. Skin punch biopsies 
from the abdomen and the arm showed SOX10 positive small junc-
tional nonpigmented melanocytic nests. Toludine blue and CD117 
showed increased dermal mast cells. Bone marrow biopsy showed 
no C-Kit mutation and serum tryptase was normal. No hepatosple-
nomegaly/lymphadenopathy was seen on CT scan.
Results: Around 10 similar cases have been reported, including a 
case report by Danotti et al. There is prevalence for female patients. 
CD117 is thought to be expressed in 29% of melanomas, which 
may also have therapeutic implications. In our case CD117 was 
negative in the melanocytes. Hägglund et al reported an increased 
risk of melanoma in patients with systemic mastocytosis. The 
C-Kit proto-oncogen codes for the transmembrane tyrosine kinase 
receptor of the stem cell factor (SCF). Increased CSF induces mel-
anocyte proliferation, melanin pigment production and deposits in 
keratinocytes. The papules were around a millimetre in size and 
none underwent recent change. This was an incidental unexpected 
finding on histopathology.
Conclusion: We presented a rare case of eruptive melanocytic 
naevi associated with cutaneous mastocytosis in a young man, 
which was an incidental histology finding. This rare condition con-
firms the similar pathogenesis between the mast cells and melano-
cytic naevi, related to the increased SCF stimulation. Such patients 
need close follow up to ensure early diagnosis of melanoma. They 
also need to be fully investigated to exclude systemic mastocytosis. 
They are offered symptomatic relief of their itching and rashes.

Metatypical basal cell carcinoma overlying a dermatofibroma: 
an association never described before
H. Trihia*, P. Manikis
*Pathology Department Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Dermatofibroma (DF) is a skin tumour, 
mostly located on the limps. The overlying epidermis shows simple 
hyperplasia to basal cell carcinoma (BCC). We report a tumour consist-
ing of DF and metatypical BCC in the outer surface of the left forearm.
Methods: A 84-year old woman presented to our dermatol-
ogy clinic for evaluation of a lesion on her left posterior arm. 
She was uncertain as to its duration and she denied any pain or 
bleeding. Physical examination revealed a 13mm raised circum-
scribed smooth, lobulated skin nodule, with solid, whitish and 
S207

elastic cut surface. The lesion was excised and sent for histologi-
cal examination.
Results: Histopathology confirmed two different lesions in 
association. An overlying baso-squamous BCC in the overlying 
epidermis and reticular dermis and an underlying symmetric 
relatively circumscribed with indefinite borders dermal based 
lesion consisting of a mixture of fibroblasts and histiocytes 
arranged in fascicles with storiform pattern. The BCC component 
was positive for CK5/6, p63, p40, BerEP4 and bcl-2 and the 
concomitant lesion for CD68/KP1 and negative for S-100 and 
EMA. The final diagnosis was of a collision tumour consisting of 
a metatypical BCC overlying a dermatofibroma.
Conclusion: Dermatofibromas and BCCs are common lesions. 
Their coexistence within one lesion is uncommon. DFs can 
be associated with a variety of benign lesions of the overlying 
epidermis including pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, to 
basaloid proliferations to BCC, Bowen disease and melanoma. 
Basal cell proliferations and BCCs are said to be the result of the 
inductive effect of DF on the epithelial cells of the hair follicle. 
The association with metatypical BCC has not previously been 
described and can contribute to the histogenesis.

Eccrine porocarcinoma metastasized in the lung - a case report
N. Novkovic*, M. Papazian, G. Stanc, M. Sevastiadou, C. Vala-
vanis, E. Souka
*Pathology Department Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Eccrine porocarcinoma (EPC) is a rare 
malignant cutaneous adnexal tumour, representing 0.005% to 0.01% of 
all cutaneous tumours. Can arise de novo or from pre-existing poroma. 
Chronic light exposure and immunosuppression proposed as factors 
that contribute to the malignant transformation.
Methods: We received, from a 56-year-old female, a skin biopsy 
composed by small fragments of skin from inguinal region.
Results: On histological examination the dermis was infiltrated by 
epithelioid malignant cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, moder-
ate to severe nuclear atypia, prominent nucleoli and brisk mitotic 
activity ≥ 3-5 mitosis/1HPF. The cells are arranged in nests with 
fibrous septa between them. Necrosis was present. The neoplasm 
extends widely to the surgical margins.
Immunochemistry was positive for CK7, EMA, CK5/6, p63, 
EGFR, E-cadherin, CD10 and GATA-3. Ki-67 was positive 90% of 
neoplastic cells. Negative immunoractivity for Melan A, HMB45, 
ER, PgR, AR and p16 was observed. The diagnostic of eccrine 
porocarcinoma was made. We recommended wider skin excision 
and control of the regional lymph nodes, lung and bone. Further 
investigation revealed lung metastasis.
Conclusion: The lower extremities and head and neck are the most 
common primary sites for EPC. Because malignant transforma-
tion of previous benign lesion could be happened, any spontane-
ous bleeding, ulceration, itching, pain and sudden growth must be 
investigated. Due to its rarity and no specific clinical manifesta-
tions, it is generally difficult to suspect EPC as initial clinical 
diagnosis.

The relative composition and distribution of the mononuclear 
inflammatory cell infiltrate in common melanocytic nevi
G. Tudor*, O. Stefan, S. Zurac, L. Cristina, D. Boda, C. Caruntu
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Melanocytic nevi are frequently associated 
with inflammatory cells of different types and varied proportions. Our 
study aims to evaluate the mononuclear inflammatory cell in com-
mon melanocytic nevi (CMN) with intravascular nevus cell protrusion 
(IVNP) and intravascular nevus cell aggregates (IVNcA).
Methods: We performed a case control study comparing 30 CMN 
with IVNP and IVNcA and 30 matched CMN without IVNP and 
IVNcA and stained them for CD3, CD 4, CD 8, FOXP3, CD 20 and 
CD 11c, assessing the distribution and composition of the positive 
cells in the inflammatory cell population with their median and 
p-values using the student t test.
Results: The inflammatory infiltrate in all CMN was minimal, 
predominantly distributed perivascular, periadnexal and in the 
stroma surrounding the nevi, mainly consisted of T-cells in 
both groups, significantly higher (p=0.047) in the nevi with 
IVNP and IVNcAs. CD4+:CD8+ ratio varied from 1:3 to 4:1, 
without noteworthy differences between the two groups and the 
FoxP3+ cells were very sparse regardless of the type of nevus. 
The monocytic/macrophagic population CD11c+ was the second 
largest component of the inflammatory infiltrate and remarkably 
higher (p=0.02) in the nevi with IVNP and IVNcAs, compared 
to common melanocytic nevi without these features.
Conclusion: The microenvironment of benign melanocytic lesions 
consists of low counts of immune cells, scattered around the 
stroma and nevus cells, most of which are CD3+ cells, followed 
by macrophages and with very few CD 20+ lymphocytes; this 
layout is mainly observed in nevi with IVNP and IVNcAs. A 
better understanding of the mononuclear cells role played in the 
pathogenesis of the vascular affinity of melanocytes is needed 
through further research.

istry-of-Research-and-Innovation, CCCDI-UEFISCDI, project

Clinical pitfall, an incidental umbilical melanoma, a case 
report
S. Kartal*, E. Tuncer, H. Özer
*Sivas Cumhuriyet University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Melanoma is the third prevalent skin 
cancer, commonly seen in sun-exposed skin. 43% of all umbilical 
tumours are malignant and classified as primary or metastatic. 
Primary malignancies represent 12-20% of all umbilical malignancies. 
Umbilical melanoma is extremely rare.
Methods: The case of umbilical melanoma operated with the 
previously diagnosed as granuloma was evaluated in terms of 
clinical and pathological features.
Results: A 48-year-old female patient presented to general surgery 
clinic with main complaint of abdominal pain also suffered from mild 
discoloration and swelling in the umbilicus. After examination the 
patient was diagnosed as chronic cholesystitis and umbilical granuloma 
and operated. The gallbladder and umbilical material of the patient 
sent to our laboratory. When the specimen pre-diagnosed as umbilical 
granuloma was examined, we saw an ulcerated, well-circumscribed 
nodular pigmented lesion on umbilicus with a diameter of 3 cm. As 
a result of microscopic examination, the case was reported as Clark 
level 4, pT4b melanoma. Unexpected Malignancy was reported as a 
panic diagnosis.
Conclusion: As in our case, the diagnosis of umbilical melanoma is 
often made in the late stages, possibly because the umbilicus is an area 
that is often not discovered during skin cancer screening and the patient 
delays seeking medical attention. Even in it is found to be incidental,

it is important to make a macroscopic evaluation by predicting that 
malignancy may exist in the umbilical material. It should be kept in 
mind that umbilical lesions, although rare, have a malignant potential.

Adenolipoma: a rare benign tumour
E. Souka*, G. Stanc, N. Novkovic, K. Ntatsis, C. Valavanis
*Pathology Department Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Adenolipoma is a rare benign skin tumour, 
first described in 1993. We present a case of adenolipoma with a brief 
review of the literature.
Methods: A 60-year-old male patient presented with a solitary, 
slow growing, painless lump on the right thigh. The lesion was 
subcutaneous, and the patient underwent surgical excision.
Results: On gross resection, the lesion was soft, lobulated, 
yellowish mass measuring 4.7 cm in greatest diameter, with a thin 
encircling capsule. Microscopically, the lesion consisted of lobules 
of mature fat with intermixed benign eccrine glands and ducts. 
The morphological findings were consistent with subcutaneous 
adenolipoma.
Conclusion: Adenolipoma is an unusual variant of lipoma, com-
monly arising in arms, shoulders and chest of adults aged 25-75 
years. The tumour is subcutaneous or located in the dermis and 
composed of mature adipose tissue and eccrine ducts and glands. 
The glands can show cystic dilation, epithelial hyperplasia and 
squamous or clear metaplasia. Differential diagnosis includes typi-
cal lipoma, nevus lipomatosus superficialis, eccrine angiomatous 
hamartoma, spindle cell lipoma, and cutaneous myxolipoma. Treat-
ment and prognosis are identical to those of common lipoma.

Viral exanthema in a COVID-19 patient
E. Yumuk*, S. Cagaptay, G. Bülbül, B. Lebe
*Department of Pathology, Dokuz Eylül University Faculty of 
Medicine, Turkey
Background & objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus, is quickly spreading and threatening global health. 
COVID-19 has been related to a variety of cutaneous manifestations 
with different clinical patterns. However, the identification and charac-
teristics of COVID-19-related skin lesions remain speculative.
Methods: A 70-year-old male patient developed itchy, erythema-
tous papule, water-filled blisters over his body, particularly on his 
feet and hands, one week after contracting covid and lasting for 6-7 
months. Diabetes, hypertension, and chronic renal disease were all 
present in the patient’s medical history. Histopathological exami-
nation was performed in conjunction with the clinical preliminary 
diagnosis of viral exanthema or allergic dermatitis.
Results: Microscopic examination revealed spongiosis, microve-
siculations, and lymphocyte exocytosis in the epidermis. There 
were lymphocytic vasculitis pattern in the superficial and/or deep 
dermis with mild oedema and extravasated erythrocytes from the 
damaged vessels, as well as slight infiltration of eosinophils and 
neutrophils. In the direct immunofluorescence microscopy, no 
deposits were seen. The diagnosis was considered as spongiotic 
dermatitis and lymphocytic vasculitis. This patient was taking a 
lot of medications, and comorbidities could make the differential 
diagnosis more difficult. Therefore, the skin lesion may be asso-
ciated with a primary, indirect cutaneous manifestation or drug 
eruption from COVID-19 infection. We needed clinicopathological 
correlation in the differential diagnosis.
Conclusion: Histopathology plays an important role in describing skin 
lesions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of COVID-19 on 
the skin can be seen as a result of lifestyle changes during the pan-
demic, various medicines used in therapy, and indirectly induced vas-
cular dysfunctions. In our case, we concluded that spongiotic dermatitis 
pattern and lymphocytic vasculitis may be reflected viral exanthem 
associated with COVID-19 infection. This is an additional case to the 
skin findings of COVID-19 infection that contributes to the literature.

Cryoglobulinemia and reactive angioendotheliomatosis, second-
ary to multiple myeloma and Waldenström’s macroglobuline-
mia, a report of two rare cases
F. Kubba*, D. Ivan, F. Teixeira, H. Kagdi, A. Scur, R. Skinner, B. Barbosa
*Department of Pathology, Ealing Hospital, London North West 
University Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: A 64-year-old female presented with bilat-
eral toe numbness and painful erythematous rash on both legs and 
arms, worse in colder environment.
An 81-year-old man presented with a vasculitis-type rash on the 
foot, legs, torso and arms, initially bullous/blistering then necrotic.
Methods: Microscopically the skin showed lobular clusters of 
closely packed dermal glomeruloid capillaries. There was a striking 
proliferation of plumb endothelial cells forming capillaries within 
pre-existing dilated vessels associated with red cell extravasation. 
The capillaries were filled with pink-staining amorphous hyaline 
cryoglobulins material which was PAS-positive. These were high-
lighted by CD34 and ERG. HHV8 and muscle specific actin were 
negative.
Results: The first patient was recently diagnosed with lym-
phoplasmacytic lymphoma with a monoclonal IgM protein 
(Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia). The second patient had 
a background of multiple myeloma and mixed cryoglobuline-
mia. He developed sepsis and renal failure and passed away 
shortly afterwards. The differential diagnosis included Kaposi 
sarcoma, angiosarcoma, pyogenic granuloma, bacillary angi-
omatosis, angioacrodermatitis and angioendotheliomatosis. 
Reactive angioendotheliomatosis (RAE) is a rare condition, the 
aetiology of which may be due to local ischaemia secondary to 
vascular obstruction. Only a few cases were reported in asso-
ciation with cryoglobulinemia. Other causes include systemic 
or autoimmune diseases, such as chronic renal failure or car-
diac valvular disease, lymphoproliferative diseases, systemic 
infections, antiphospholipid syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and 
atherosclerosis.
Conclusion: We presented two cases of cryoglobulinemia and reac-
tive angioendotheliomatosis, induced by lymphoblastic lymphoma and 
multiple myeloma. They presented with erythematous/vasculitic rash, 
blisters, ulcers and necrosis. Histopathology showed distinct dermal 
lobules of glomeruloid capillary cluster proliferation filled with PAS-
positive amorphous cryoglobulins and plumb endothelial cells. Despite 
the benign histopathology, the condition is very serious and one patient 
needed intensive care ending in a fatal course due to sepsis. Treatment 
is supportive with prevention of secondary infection and treating the 
underlying cause.

Melanoma with blue nevus-like features - diagnostic challenges 
and management

Background & objectives: Melanomas can oftentimes be difficult to 
diagnose because of the various ways they present themselves clinically 
and microscopically. Diagnosing the melanoma subtype is often very 
challenging, but the main issue must always be that the patient receives 
the right treatment.
Methods: 60-year-old woman initially presents with a progres-
sively enlarging cervical lymphnode, which showed positivity for 
melanoma markers, without knowing the primary melanoma site. 
One month later, surgical excision of a scalp lesion was performed, 
showing nodules located in the dermis and subcutis, without any 
epidermal connections, with some heavily pigmented areas, con-
sisting in both epithelioid and fusiform malignant cells.
Results: Histological examination could not differentiate 
between a primary melanoma with blue nevus-like features/a 
melanoma arising in a blue nevus and a cutaneous metastasis of a 
melanoma originating elsewhere. The fact that no other significant 
melanocytic lesion was found made it reasonable to consider this 
a primary lesion. The BRAF mutation was then assessed and it’s 
absence might also be a clue that the tumour might have developed 
from a blue nevus, as these usually lack the BRAF mutation.
Conclusion: Establishing whether the lesion truly belongs to the 
”blue line” would have required molecular tests for the GNA11 or 
Gnaq alterations, but what matters is that she received treatment 
in time, the only one available in country protocols being 
INFα – which has been shown to improve overall survival and 
recurrence-free survival in patients with high-risk melanoma. We 
come across pathology pitfalls daily, but it is always important to 
only focus on the details that could really help the patient.

Rare association of Leishmaniasis with purpura: a case report
S. Hincapié*, E. Loayza, C. Pozo, M.E. Cruz, A. Orellana, S. 
Eguez, J.C. Garcés
*Instituto Oncológico Nacional Dr. Juan Tanca Marengo, Ecuador
Background & objectives: Leishmaniasis is a chronic disease caused 
by an intracellular parasite. We report an uncommon cutaneous leish-
maniasis associated with lymphocytic vasculitis, clinically manifested 
with purpura without ulceration. This hasn’t been reported in Ecuador 
before, although there are 1000 cases per year.
Methods: A 75-year-old female presented drug-induced vasculitis 
with multiple purpuric lesions on both lower extremities, treated 
with prednisone 60mg during 2 weeks and 20mg per day as main-
tenance. Two months later after resolution of skin lesions, the 
patient presented a single cutaneous purpuric lesion on left lower 
extremity.
Results: Laboratory findings presented negative antinuclear anti-
bodies, negative anti-DNA and C3–C4 protein levels within normal 
range. Biopsies of this lesion were taken and showed lymphop-
lasmocytic inflammatory infiltrate with diffuse and perivascular 
distribution, fibrin deposits on arterial walls and amastigotes forms 
of Leishmania inside histiocyte vacuoles.
Conclusion: This infectious disease presented a wide range of dif-
ferential diagnosis due to its atypical presentation. Lymphocytic 
vasculitis has been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, 
lymphoproliferative disorders such as angiocentric lymphoma or 
lymphomatoid papulosis, arachnidism and borrelia burdorferi infec-
tion due to erythema migrans similar appearance. The diagnosis of 
leishmaniasis in this patient was made by the identification of intra-
cellular amastigotes. This uncommon manifestation of leishmaniasis 
can easily be mistaken with other diseases, which should have special 
considerations mainly in endemic areas.

Calciphylaxis – histopathological feeling of impending doom. 
A case report
A. Dumitru*, A.M. Ciongariu, D. Tapoi, I. Mergeanu, M. Sajin, 
M. Costache, C. Aliuș
*Carol Davila University of Medicine, Romania
Background & objectives: Calciphylaxis is a poorly understood and 
highly morbid syndrome of vascular calcification, thrombosis and skin 
necrosis prevalent in patients with uremia. The mortality rate is high, 
due to sepsis and internal organ failure.
Methods: We present the case of a 33-year-old female patient, 
smoker, obese, admitted in the hospital for intense pain on right 
foot, muscle weakness, necrotic lesions on the skin with a history 
of important comorbidities (arterial hypertension, diabetes, 
dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, obliterating artery disease of the 
lower limbs, ESRD and COVID-19).
Results: The patient rapidly developed extensive necrotic 
lesions of the right food, intense pain and worsening of the 
general condition despite treatment. The patient underwent a 
transmetatarsal amputation of the forefoot. The surgical sam-
ple was sent the the Pathology Department for histopathologi-
cal assessment. Despite intensive care and multiple therapeu-
tic attempts, the evolution was unfavourable, and the patient 
died 3 days after surgery. Microscopically, in addition to the 
tissue lesions characteristic of wet gangrene, typical features 
of calciphylaxis were observed. There were variable stippled 
calcification within adipose tissue and associated fat necrosis. 
Thick ring-shaped calcification of arteriole and capillaries 
were identified. Capillary thrombosis was extensive. Also a 
lymphohistiocytic infiltrate was noted
Conclusion: Calciphylaxis is a rare, critical condition, sometimes 
difficult to diagnose. The differential diagnosis might be 
challenging especially in patients with multiple comorbidities. The 
prognosis of calciphylaxis is often unfavourable despite aggressive 
treatment. Histopathological features suggestive for calciphylaxis 
found on post-amputation resection specimens should alarm 
both the pathologist and the medical team caring for the patient. 
Despite maximal medical and surgical therapies, calciphylaxis 
typically results in a 60% to 80% mortality rate with sepsis being 
the leading cause of death.

Pilomatrical carcinoma, a case report
S. Kartal*, E. Tuncer, O.F. Goze
*Sivas Cumhuriyet University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Pilomatrical carcinoma is an uncommon 
adnexal carcinoma with matrical differentiation. In the literature, less 
than 150 cases have been described. We aimed to contribute to the 
literature re-evaluating a rare case of pilomatrical carcinoma with the 
new immunohistochemical methods investigated.
Methods: We reported the case of a 86-year-old male with a 3 cm 
ulcerated nodule on the left temporal skin. The lesion was excised 
in Plastic Surgery department and we stained the excision speci-
men with LEF-1, CDX2 and SATB2 immunohistochemical stains 
which were related to the SATB2/β-catenin/TCF-LEF pathway that 
is discussed as an important pathway in pathogenesis of randomly 
selected pilomatricoma.
Results: As a result of the immunohistochemical analysis we 
performed, although pilomatrical carcinoma and pilomatrixoma 
showed expression with LEF-1 and CDX-2, SATB2 showed 
positivity only for pilomatrical carcinoma. When we re-evaluated 
the case with our previous findings, we obtained findings

consistent with the literature. It is interesting that previous 
studies, pilomatricoma with SATB2 immunohistochemistry 
did not show positivity. In a recent case report in the literature, 
SATB2, which was applied to a case of pilomatrical carcinoma 
and showed positivity, was also expressed in our case.
Conclusion: In conclusion, the use of SATB2 in the differential 
diagnosis of benign and malignant pilomatrical tumours may be 
considered. Even though the results obtained in this study cannot 
be generalized, it may be important to study these lesions in large 
series in terms of giving an idea to clarify the pathogenesis and 
immunohistochemistry. Considered together with the literature, 
our case can be a clue for new pathogenetic studies.

Clinicopathological cocordance of mycosis fungoides: 10 
years of our institutional experience
E. Ekren*, N. Koç, Ş. Yaşar, M. Erdal
*Haydarpasa Numune Education and Research Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a disease that 
can be diagnosed by the collaboration of a clinician and pathologist. 
Its differential diagnosis includes many other malignant and benign 
dermatoses. We evaluated the clinicopathological corelations and its 
importance in this study.
Methods: Between 2010 and 2021, 885 skin punch biopsies in 
which MF was diagnosed histopathologically or with MF in the 
clinical differential diagnosis were retrospectively analysed. 
Recurrent biopsies (76) and patients previously diagnosed with 
MF (17) were excluded from the study.
Results: Of the cases, no findings consistent with MF were found 
in 744 (93,9%) patients, whereas MF was diagnosed histopatho-
logically in 48 (6,1%) patients. Among the 744 patients in whom 
MF was excluded, most common primary provisional diagnoses 
other than MF were psoriatic dermatitis (15%,116/744) and par-
apsoriasis (14%, 110/744), similar to the concordant group in 
which spongiotic dermatitis (16%, 8/48) and parapsoriasis (14%, 
7/48) were leading.
Conclusion: When the clinical and histopathological concord-
ance was evaluated, it was seen that the most clinically confused 
cases with mf were spongiotic dermatitis and parapsoriasis.

Discrete papular lichen myxoedematosus, a rare case report 
and review of literature
M. Shetty, F. Kubba*, I. Logan
*Department of Pathology, Ealing Hospital, London North West 
University Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: A 57-year-old Asian female presented with 
widespread pruritic dark itchy papules occurring over 4 years. Exami-
nation showed bilateral, symmetrical grouped waxy 1-2m papules over 
the dorsa of forearms, back, and shin. She had sickle cell anaemia and 
beta thalassemia trait.
Methods: A skin biopsy from a papule showed focal parakera-
tosis, circumscribed superficial dermal mucin deposition and 
Alcian blue stain confirmed the presence of mucin in the upper 
dermis. There was no fibroblastic proliferation or fibrosis. A 
diagnosis of discrete papular lichen myxoedematosus (DPLM) 
was made. She was treated with topical steroids and urea-based 
emollients and responded very well with complete resolution.
Results: Lichen Myxoedematosus (papular mucinosis) is a rare 
heterogeneous group of cutaneous mucinoses characterised by 
an abnormal dermal deposition of mucin, first described by 
Dubreuilh in 1906 Rongioletti and Rebora describe three sub-
groups of LM; generalized LM (scleromyxoedema), a localized 
form, and an atypical variant, which is further subclassified 
by Nofal et al. Our case represents a subtype of LM with good 
response to potent topical steroids and had no association with 
HIV or hepatitis C infection, which has been rarely reported 
DPLM has good prognosis, and spontaneous remission occurs 
on occasions. The clinical differential diagnosis includes lichen 
amyloidosis. Evolution to scleromyxedema has never previously 
been documented in this form.
Conclusion: We presented a rare case of discrete papular lichen 
myxoedematosus presenting as bilateral symmetrical waxy papules 
on the dorsa of forearms, back, and shin.
Microscopy showed circumscribed superficial dermal mucin 
deposition confirmed by Alcian blue, with no fibroblastic 
proliferation or fibrosis. It represents one of three subgroups 
of LM. Our case was associated with sickle cell anaemia and 
thalassemia trait. They respond well to urea-based emollients and 
ultra-potent topical steroids and usually have good prognosis with 
rarely reported spontaneous remission.

*Department of Pathology, Military Hospital of Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Hidradenomas are benign adnexal tumours, 
usually taking place in the head limbs. Inguinal region is uncommon as 
a site of occurrence. Through this case, we aim to present this unusual 
location and discuss histological characteristics of this tumour.
Methods: We, herein, present a case of an inguinal hidradenoma.
Results: A 46- years old male presented with a painless inguinal 
cystic large mass growing for 12 years. A surgical removal of the 
mass had been performed. Gross examination showed a heteroge-
neous cystic mass with irregular walls. Histopathological exami-
nation showed a largely cystic proliferation. It was composed of 
layers of cells separated by fine branching vessels and arranged in 
a lobular pattern. The cells were clear, with abundant cytoplasm 
and monomorphic nuclei without atypia or mitosis. Immunohisto-
chemical study showed that the tumour cells were CK5/6 positive, 
ACE negative and did not express kidney cell marker PAX8. These 
findings were consistent with a clear cell hidradenoma.
Conclusion: Hidradenomas are rare adnexal tumours. Inguinal 
localization is extremely rare. Histologically, the tumour has a pre-
dominantly clear cells pattern that may be challenging for the diag-
nosis. In fact, differential diagnosis, especially, metastatic tumours, 
should be ruled out using immunohistochemistry and clinical data. 
Clinical assessment is required to detect possible recurrences.

Atypical hidradenoma: a case report
Y. Ozerdem*, E. Ucaryilmaz Ozhamam
*Erzurum Regional Training and Research Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Atypical hidradenoma is an uncommon 
neoplasm, displaying atypical features in contrast to its benign coun-
terpart hidradenoma, including nuclear hyperchromatism and pleo-
morphism, giant cells, focal infiltrative growth, necrosis and mitotic 
activity.

Methods: A 54-year-old male with no significant medical history 
presented with a cutaneous mass on the medial aspect of the left 
lower limb. Excisional biopsy specimen revealed a 3,6x3,5x1,2 cm 
grossly friable papillomatous lesion.
Results: Histological sections showed a poorly circumscribed 
adnexal tumour with irregular borders. The morphological 
appearance was variable throughout the tumour. Epidermis 
showed papillomatosis and acanthosis, composed of neoplastic 
cells having large, clear eosinophilic cytoplasm and small 
nucleoli. The infiltrating component, extending from dermis into 
the subcutaneous adipose tissue, was not clearly demarcated from 
the epidermis. However, a distinct connection to the epidermal 
proliferation was also not observed. The infiltrative foci showed 
nests of relatively fusiform cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and 
conspicuous nucleoli in a markedly hyalinized stroma. Mitotic 
activity was found to be prominent (2 mitoses per 10 high-power 
fields). No necrosis, no vascular or perineural invasion were 
observed.
Conclusion: In conclusion, the tumour was evaluated to be 
consistent with atypical hidradenoma. To the best of our 
knowledge, there exists a limited number of cases of this 
neoplasm in the literature. This case report would contribute to 
our knowledge about this particular entity. The risk of recurrence 
and malignant potential of atypical hidradenomas are reported to be 
increased; therefore, recognising atypical features in an otherwise 
benign hidradenoma is crucial.

Secondary localized cutaneous amyloidosis in mycosis fungoides
E. Aydemir*, I.E. Zemheri
*Health Sciences University Umraniye Education and Training 
Hospital, Pathology Department, Turkey
Background & objectives: Secondary localized cutaneous amyloido-
sis is a histopathological finding that occurs in various in-flammatory 
skin diseases and epithelial skin tumours. It is often not clinically 
apparent. Cases of secondary cutaneous amyloidosis associated with 
mycosis fungoides are extremely rare.
Methods: We presented a 25-year-old female, presented with flat 
patches and plaques on the trunk and extremities which appeared 
10 years ago, and showed a persistent course. She had not received 
any medical treatment for her eruptions.
Results: In the punch biopsy taken from the left leg of the patient, 
lymphocytes with hyperchromatic nuclei, lined up at the base of the 
epidermis, showing focal epidermotropism, containing peripheral 
halos, were observed. These lymphocytes were positive for CD3, 
CD4, CD8. The population of CD8+ cells predominated over that 
of CD4+ cells. In addition, homogeneous amorphous eosinophilic 
depositions were observed in the papillary dermis in focal areas. 
We performed Congo red staining, and the deposits were nega-
tive for this staining, however positive staining was observed for 
HMWCK.
Conclusion: Literature findings support the theory that amyloid 
materials are produced by epidermal damage. CD8+ cells are cyto-
toxic in nature; therefore, in our case the infiltration of many CD8+ 
cells can be attributed to the formation of amyloid material from 
attacks on epidermal keratinocytes.

Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn – case report of a 
rare entity
T.M. Costa*, R. Sampaio
*Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Ocidental, Portugal
Background & objectives: Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn 
(SCFN) is an uncommon panniculitis of full-term neonates. Its precise 
incidence is unknown and the pathogenesis remains unclear. SCFN 
often develops in neonates who have experienced hypoxia or other 
perinatal stress (obstetric trauma, hypothermia).
Methods: We report a full-term girl born by vacuum-assisted 
vaginal delivery due to shoulder dystocia, that presented with 
consequent right clavicle fracture. Born to a 27-year-old mother 
with active COVID-19 infection and group B streptococcal (GBS) 
colonization, which was adequately treated at delivery. On the 4th 
day of life presented with multiple, tender erythematous nodules 
on the shoulder, axilla and back.
Results: Initial laboratory tests for electrolytes were normal. The new-
born was treated with prophylatic broad-spectrum antibiotics. On the 
14th day of life an incisional biopsy of one of the lesions was per-
formed. The histologic examination revealed normal epidermis and 
dermis, underlying lobular panniculitis with focal fat necrosis and mod-
erate inflammatory infiltrate, composed by lymphocytes, histiocytes, 
multinucleated giant cells, eosinophils and neutrophils. The adipocytes 
showed needle-shaped clefts and crystals in a radial-type arrangement. 
On the 1st- month consultation there was slight improvement of the 
lesion but a mild hypercalcemia was detected (Ca2+ 5,8 mg/dL (N: 
4,5 - 5,3)). The histopathological findings correlated with the clinical 
course confirmed the diagnosis of SFN.
Conclusion: SFN has a generally good outcome with spontaneous 
resolution of skin lesions. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of this entity 
is important, once it may evolve with relevant systemic alterations, 
especially acute renal injury secondary to hypercalcemia, reason 
why monitoring is required. The main differential diagnosis 
for SFN is sclerema neonatorum (SN), a rare frequently fatal 
condition, in previously ill pre-term infants. SN presents as a 
rapidly spreading, diffuse confluent nodules and plaques, and it 
typically affects the legs, buttocks and trunk.

Rodriguez, I. Orbegozo Arrizabalaga, I. Gantxegi Fernandez, I. 
Allende Markixana, I. Mendez Maestro, A. Fernández de Larrinoa 
Santamaría
*Cruces University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: Onychocytic matricoma (OCM) is a 
benign tumour of the nail matrix, first described by Perrin et al. in 
2012. It represents an acanthoma of onychocytes that clinically 
manifests as a monodactilus longitudinal pachymelanonychia or 
xantholeucopachyonychia. A new case is described.
Methods: A 70-year-old man with no medical history presented a 
yellowish-white thickened longitudinal stripe on the first finger of 
the right hand, with a more nodular erythematous zone on the lunula. 
It was asymptomatic but grew progressively and did not respond to 
topical treatment with calcipotriol/betametasone. A longitudinal biopsy 
of the nail matrix, nail bed and nail plate were performed.
Results: Histologically, an epithelial acanthosis forming endo-
phytic projections with blunt edges was observed, consisting 
of basaloid cells showing pseudosquamous eddies, which were 
formed by whorls of endokeratinization with an equal distribution 
of prekeratogenous zones and eosinophilic keratogenous zones. 
Scattered melanocytes could be seen, but pigmentation of the epi-
thelial cells was not relevant. Changes in the dermis were mini-
mal, with isolated lymphocytes. The main histological differential 
diagnosis is seborrheic keratosis, in which the squamous whorls 
are not cornified by the cells of the nail plate and, therefore, lack

the concentric layers. Our case is consistent with the acanthotic 
variant of OCM. At 1-year follow-up, there was no recurrence.
Conclusion: Only 17 cases of OCM have been reported in the English 
literature until 2020. Clinically it shows a localized thickening of the nail 
plate and a longitudinal band. Histologically, the characteristic feature is 
acanthosis of the nail matrix and nests of prekeratogenous and keratog-
enous cells with variation in their components. Four histological types can 
be identified: acanthotic, acanthotic and papillomatous, keratogenous with 
retarded maturation and germinotropic. OCM should be included in the 
differential diagnosis of clinically longitudinal nail bands.

Merkel cell carcinomas associated to a primary haematological 
neoplasm: a unique case associated to follicular lymphoma
E. Miraval Wong*, P. Puente Lopez, E. García Fernández
*Hospital Universitario La Paz, Spain
Background & objectives: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) has been 
associated with primary haematological neoplasms due to immune dys-
function and MCPyV reactivation. We did a 30-year review of MCC in 
association with a lymphoproliferative disorder and described a patient 
with follicular lymphoma.
Methods: We identified biopsies of cases of MCC using SNOMED 
coding lists from 1992 to 2022. We found 58 patients with MCC; after-
ward we reviewed patient history to detect associated haematological 
neoplasms. We describe histopathological, immunohistochemical and 
molecular diagnosis of Follicular Lymphoma (FL) with MCC.
Results: Fifty-eight patients were diagnosed with MCC in the last 30 
years of whom 3 (5.2%) had an haematological neoplasm (chronic lym-
phocytic leukaemia, mycosis fungoides and FL). A 57 years-old man 
was diagnosed with FL grade 1-2. He was treated with R-CHOP and 
kept with rituximab maintenance. After 8 months of complete remis-
sion, he developed a 5 cm cutaneous nodule on his left arm. Resection 
specimen showed cutaneous infiltration of MCC and a close lymph 
node with a FL grade 1-2 (positivity for CD20, BCL-2, CD10 and 
BCL-6) and MCC metastasis. The sentinel lymph node had the same 
features and was positive for BCL-2 translocation.
Conclusion: MCC can associate a haemato-oncological neoplasia 
being chronic lymphocytic leukaemia the most frequent. There 
is only one case described in the literature with a FL and a 
secondary MCC, which appeared 10 months after the remission 
with rituximab treatment. Unlike our case, the reported one did 
not have a FL relapse. There can be overlapping marker expression 
between MCC and haematological neoplasms like our case that 
was positive for BCL-2 in both of them, creating potential pitfalls.

VEXAS: case report and characteristics of a new syndrome 
with neutrophilic dermatosis
G. Barrios Millán*, G. Servera, E. Sendagorta, E. García Fernán-
dez, E. Ruiz-Bravo, M.J. Beato
*La Paz University Hospital, Department of Pathology Spain
Background & objectives: VEXAS is acronym for Vacuoles, E1 
enzyme, X-linked, Autoinflammatory and Somatic mutation. Its cause 
is a somatic mutation in UBA1, a gene that encodes for E1 ubiquitin 
activating protein. We present a new case of this very recently 
described entity.
Methods: For the case report we searched the patient’s electronic 
medical records from 2012, when symptoms started, to 2021, when 
diagnosis was made, including subsequent follow-up to date. For 
the literature review we searched Pubmed.
Results: In 2012, a 58-year-old male had skin lesions that were 
diagnosed as lupus erythematosus. Along the course of the disease 
he presented arthralgias, serositis, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and 
pancytopenia. This led to a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate, that 
showed a myelodysplastic syndrome with vacuoles.
In 2021 showed erythematous papules and plaques that, 
when biopsied, exhibited neutrophils that were located 
in dermis and adipous tissue. VEXAS syndrome was 
suspected, and genetic study confirmed the mutation 
in UBA1 gene. Detection of the causing mutation was 
revolutionary because the method used started with the 
analysis of numerous mapped genomic sequences, in which 
the common findings in UBA1 led with similar clinical 
findings.
Conclusion: VEXAS syndrome was described at the end of 
2020. It’s to be suspected in older males with a combination of 
inflammatory signs like refractory fever and polychondritis, as 
well as hematologic alterations. Vacuoles in myeloid and erythroid 
precursor cells of bone marrow biopsy are characteristic. In the 
skin, causes several lesions that, in the biopsy, show a neutrophilic 
dermatosis. Since its description, VEXAS syndrome has explained 
many cases that had failed to be classified in any of the known 
diseases.

Nivolumab therapy in multiple primary melanomas – a case 
report
A. Cohn*, A.D. Chirita, A. Alexandru, O. Repede, I. Margaritescu
*Emergency University Hospital, Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Melanoma is a cutaneous malignancy that 
may benefit from immune therapy with checkpoint inhibitors, even in 
advanced stages. We report a case with two primary melanomas treated 
with nivolumab, highlighting the histopathological findings and the 
clinical evolution.
Methods: A 70-year-old man presented to the dermatologist for 
alopecia, when a large infiltrative tumour located on the scalp and a 
second pigmented lesion on the cheek were discovered. Computed 
tomography examination revealed that the scalp tumour was infil-
trating the occipital bone, extending close to the superior sagittal 
sinus. As the neoplasm was unresectable, punch biopsies from both 
lesions were performed.
Results: The lesion on the cheek was diagnosed as melanoma 
in situ. Scalp biopsy showed a desmoplastic melanoma com-
posed of a dermal fascicular proliferation of spindle cells, 
positive for Sox-10 and S100. BRAF molecular studies were 
negative. As desmoplastic melanoma is reported to respond 
well to immunotherapy, PD-L1 immunostaining was done, 
showing diffuse positivity in tumour cells. The patient was 
enrolled in a clinical study receiving NKTR and nivolumab 
(10 cycles). Given his renal disease, he then remained only 
on nivolumab. At follow-up, a spectacular decrease in meas-
urements was noted in both lesions. The tolerability profile 
was acceptable and lesions have been stable for the past 6 
months.
Conclusion: This study presents the impressive clinical evolution 
of a locally aggressive inoperable desmoplastic melanoma with 
significant shrinkage in size, associated with a tolerable toxicity 
profile. As the patient has a stable response to nivolumab with 
no imaging progression, anti-PD-1 therapy has promising 
results in increasing the overall survival and reducing the risk 
of metastases in advanced-stage melanoma.

A case of pseudoxanthoma elasticum with severe, early-onset 
ocular manifestations
D. Koumoundourou*, G. Kyriakou, V. Tzelepi
*Patras University Hospital Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), is a rare 
genetic metabolic disease caused by ABCC6 gene mutations. In PXE, 
dystrophic calcification frequently leads to cutaneous, ocular, cardio-
vascular, neurological, and other manifestations. Herein we present a 
case with significant premature ocular manifestations.
Methods: A 22-year-old female was referred to the Dermatology 
Department complaining for a “plucked chicken” appearance of 
the skin on her neck present for two years. Physical examination 
revealed multiple, small, yellowish papules on the lateral aspects 
of the neck. Thickened, lax and wrinkled skin was observed at 
the flexural surfaces of her body. A skin biopsy was performed.
Results: Microscopically in the middle dermis, degenerative 
changes affecting the elastic fibres were recognized. The fibres 
were basophilic and irregular, appearing as widely dispersed 
granular material. Their presence was best evaluated using 
a Von Kossa technique. The diagnosis was compatible with 
pseudoxanthoma elasticum. The patient was immediately referred 
to the Opthalmology Department where a dilated funduscopic 
examination was performed and revealed the presence of bilateral 
angioid streaks accompanied by peau d’orange changes in the 
retina consisting of fine yellow drusenlike pigment irregularities.
Conclusion: Although the cutaneous manifestations usually 
precede the ocular findings by many years, in our patient, they 
appeared concurrently. Moreover, macular involvement is rarely 
found before the age of 40 years. Despite the fact that there is no 
established therapy available for PXE, early diagnosis and regular 
ophthalmologic counseling are prerequisites in order to prevent and 
control the possible adverse events caused by the disease.

Histoprognostic factors of cutaneous melanoma in relation to 
metastasis at the sentinel lymph node
H. Douik*, K. Tlili, G. Sahraoui, R. Doghri, L. Charfi, B. Hedhli, 
H. Guizani, K. Mrad
*Salah Azaiz Institute of Cancer, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Identification of histoprognostic factors of 
melanoma is closely related to the metastatic progression and provides 
an important argument for the management of patients. Our aim was 
to identify histoprognostic factors that can predict the sentinel lymph 
node metastasis in melanoma.
Methods: Retrospective study of 38 melanoma with sentinel lymph 
node biopsy collected at Salah Azaiez Institute over a period of 15 
years (January 2006-December 2021). We divided the cases into 2 
groups according to sentinel lymph node status (positive or nega-
tive). For each group (N+ and N- groups), we studied the following 
parameters: Breslow’sthickness, ulceration and mitotic rate.
Results: Metastatic sentinel lymph node was found in 10 cases 
with median age of 64 years and without sex predominance. The 
median age in the N-group was 63 years with female predominance. 
For N+ group, Breslow depth varied from 7 to 11 mm with an aver-
age of 8 mm versus an average of 5 mm in the N- group (1-22). The 
mitotic rate varied from 7 to 12 mitoses/10HF with an average of 
8in N+ group and from 0 to 9 mitoses/10HF with an average of 6 
in the other group.The ulceration was present in all N+ cases and 
in 80% of cases in the other group.
Conclusion: The N+ group seems to have the worst histoprognos-
tic factors. This study should be carried out on larger samples to 
be able to confirm our results

Cutaneous Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) post COVID-19 
vaccination: case report
M.A. Barrios Villalba*, P. Pose Lapausa, J. Magdaleno Tapìal, V. 
Sabater Marco
* Department of Pathology, Hospital General Universitario de 
Valencia, Spain
Background & objectives: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is an usually 
cervical histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, self-limited and of 
unknown aetiology. Recently, several patients with KFD have been 
described post COVID-19 vaccination. However, in this context, exclu-
sively skin involvement has not been reported.
Methods: A 45-year-old man with a history of HIV infection, 
stage A2, on antiretroviral treatment and HHV-8 associated mul-
ticentric Castleman disease, presented multiple infiltrated erythe-
matous nodular lesions on the forehead, cheek, arms and trunk, 
without lymphadenitis. Skin lesions appeared 2 days after receiving 
mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna) and due to clinical 
suspicion of lymphoma, a skin biopsy was performed.
Results: Histopathological study showed epidermis with basal 
hydropic degeneration and dyskeratosis. The dermis presented 
a perivascular and periadnexal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with 
karyorrhectic debris without neutrophils next to plasma cells. 
Immunohistochemically, the histiocytes expressed CD68, CD163, 
and myeloperoxidase. Most lymphocytes expressed CD3 and CD8, 
and plasma cells expressed CD138, Kappa and Lambda. Immu-
nostaining for ALK, CD10, BCL6, BCL2, S100, CD1a, CD23, 
CD21, CD123, Treponema, and HHV-8 was negative. Real-time 
PCR revealed 30 copies of EBV/100,000 cells and no HHV-6. A 
diagnosis of cutaneous Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease post COVID-19 
vaccination was reached. Currently, the patient is stable from his 
immunodeficiency and without skin lesions.
Conclusion: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease in post-COVID-19 immu-
nization patients is a self-limited process and is clinically charac-
terized by cervical lymphadenopathy and fever, but patients with 
HIV infection may present exclusively skin involvement probably 
due to their immunodeficiency. The temporal association between 
the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine and the appearance 
of skin lesions is a clue to suspicion. The definitive diagnosis is 
histopathological when demonstrating a dermal lymphohistiocytic 
infiltrate without neutrophilic karyorrhectic debris and co-expres-
sion of CD68 and myeloperoxidase in the histiocytes.

Erythema elevatum diutinum in a patient with Crohn’s disease: 
a very rare variant of chronic cutaneous vasculitis
G. Moreno De Juan*, G.G. Yange Zambrano, I. Gallego Gutiérrez, 
P. Martín Soler, M.S. Rodríguez Duque, C. González Vela
*Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla, Spain
Background & objectives: Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) is 
a very rare variant of chronic cutaneous vasculitis that evolves into a 
concentric fibrosis. EED has been associated with hematologic disor-
ders, autoimmune processes and infections. Very few cases have been 
described with inflammatory bowel disease.
Methods: A 38-year-old man with history of factor VII deficiency 
and Crohn’s disease (CD) of 13 years of evolution, who consulted

for a 2.5 cm indurated and painful violaceous nodule in the plan-
tar region (head of the 5th metatarsal, left foot) of 6 months of 
evolution. Ultrasound findings were suspicious for mesenchymal 
neoplasia and a biopsy of the lesion was performed.
Results: Histological study showed abundant collagen bundles 
with spindle cells arranged in a storiform pattern around the blood 
vessels in the superficial and deep dermis. They were accompanied 
by mixed inflammatory infiltrate with lymphocytes and neutrophils 
as well as isolated images of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The fol-
lowing immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques were performed: 
EMA, Desmin, AML, claudin, CD34 and s100 were negative. The 
ki-67 proliferation index was less than 10%. The clinicopathologic 
and IHC findings together with the presence of leukocytoclastic 
vasculitis helped in the diagnosis of EED.
Conclusion: The histopathologic features of EED vary according 
to the age of the lesions, with development of variable fibrosis 
and fasciculated spindle cell proliferation in late stages. The 
differential diagnosis is made with an inflammatory pseudotumour, 
dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, sclerotic neurofibroma, sclerosing 
perineuroma, tendon sheath fibroma, and hyalinized leiomyoma. 
The aetiology of EED is unknown; it has been proposed to be an 
immunocomplex-mediated disease, with viral or bacterial antigens 
being involved, which would explain the association between EED 
and CD.

*Department of Microscopic Morphology-Pathology, ANAPAT-
MOL Research Center, ’’Victor Babes’’ University of Medicine 
and Pharmacy of Timisoara, Romania
Background & objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify 
the cases of nevus associated melanomas (NAMs), evaluating the clini-
cal and pathological features.
Methods: From the database of our pathology department, we 
selected the cases diagnosed as primary cutaneous melanomas 
between 2016 and 2021, extracting the nevus associated melanoma 
cases.
Results: We identified 213 cases of cutaneous melanomas, the 
NAMs representing 10% (21 cases) - 66.6% females, 33.3% males. 
The median age at diagnosis was 50 years (females) and 56 years 
(males). The majority of the NAMs presented a dysplastic nevus 
(52%). Superficial spreading melanomas, with a vertical growth 
phase predominated (57%), followed by melanoma in situ (14%). 
In the invasive melanoma group (18 cases), we noticed more often 
a Breslow index ≤ 1mm (45%), a II&III Clark level (50%), a pT1 
stage (50%), a mitotic rate of 1 mitosis/mm² (55%) and brisk 
inflammatory infiltrate (50%).
Conclusion: The median age of the females diagnosed with 
NAMs was lower compared with the median age of the males. The 
majority of the NAMs were represented by superficial spreading 
melanomas with a vertical growth phase, in the presence of a 
dysplastic nevus. In these cases predominated a low Clark level 
and Breslow index, a decreased pathological stage and mitotic rate, 
being associated more often with a brisk inflammatory infiltrate.

Metastatic male breast carcinoma in the skin. Report of a rare 
case
M. Mnikhovich*, A. Romanov, T. Bezuglova, D. Pastukhova
*Central Pathology Laboratory, Research Institute of Human Mor-
phology, Russia
Background & objectives: Breast cancer is one of the rarest 
malignancy in men. These tumours have a high tendency to 
hematogenous metastasis, often affecting the bones, lungs and liver. 
Although in some cases, lesions of atypical organs, such as skin, are 
also possible.
Methods: We present a case of metastatic invasive ductal breast 
carcinoma to the skin in a young male. In 2015 he underwent 
complex treatment invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast. In 
2021, he was again admitted with a painless mass of the skin of the 
scalp measuring 2x2.5x2 cm. A biopsy was performed followed by 
a histological and IHC study.
Results: Histological examination revealed the tumour composed 
of cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and oval pleomorphic nuclei, 
with indistinct cell and nuclei boundaries. Tumour cells form cord-
like, glandular and cribriform structures that infiltrate the dermis 
and subcutaneous fatty tissue. The tumour wasn’t associated with 
the epidermis. The IHC study showed that tumour cells expressed 
CK7, GCDFP15, GATA3, ER, PR, and HER-2. Also was the lack 
of expression CK20 and all melanocytic markers in the tumour. 
The immunophenotype of the tumour corresponds to a previous 
carcinoma of the breast.
The diagnosis of metastatic invasive breast carcinoma NST type 
was made.
Conclusion: In this article we have presented a rare case of meta-
static male invasive breast carcinoma of NST type in the skin of 
the scalp. This case expands our understanding of the nature of 
metastatic skin cancers and once again proves that when you see 
stripes, it can still be tigers.

A case of acantholytic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin
Z. Lajmi*, A. Bdioui, M. Krifa, S. Mestiri, O. Belkacem, S. Hmissa
*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Acantholytic squamous cell carcinoma 
(ASCC) is an uncommon high-risk histopathologic variant of cutane-
ous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). It is generally more aggressive 
and have a worse prognosis than the other SCC subtypes. The exact 
diagnosis is challenging.
Methods: A 63-year-old man, with no history, presented with an 
erythematous nodule in the temporal region since 4-months. On 
examination, a non-inflamed slightly pruritic hyperkeratotic papule 
was located in the temporal region. Clinically, prurigo nodularis, 
seborrheic keratosis, and SCC were suspected. A biopsy was per-
formed for making the diagnosis.
Results: On microscopic examination, the tumour was composed 
of epidermal-derived cystic proliferation extending into the super-
ficial dermis with acantholysis foci in tumour nests, creating the 
appearance of glandular differentiation. This aspect is due to the 
loss of intercellular cohesion between malignant squamous cells. 
The pseudolumina contained acantholytic and atypical dyskeratotic 
cells, and cellular debris. There was no evidence of true glandu-
lar differentiation or mucin production. The overlying epidermis 
showed hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis. On the immunohisto-
chemical studies, the acantholytic tumour cells were positive for 
CK with a cytoplasmic staining pattern and for p40 supporting a 
squamous epithelial origin. Final diagnosis of ASCC was retained.
Conclusion: ASCC is characterised histologically by a 
combination of typical SCC and pseudoglandular structures,

dyskeratotic cells and prominent acantholysis. It is usually found 
on the sun exposed areas such as the face and the neck in the 
elderly with a male predominance. It presents as a nodule with 
various colors, accompanied by scaling, crusting, and ulceration 
like the other variants. Histological examination is necessary for 
making the accurate diagnosis. ASCC is a more-aggressive tumour 
with higher potential for recurrence or metastasis.

A rare and sometimes fatal syndrome: Stevens-Johnson
D. Sá*, A. Coelho, F.S. Vieira, J.R. Vizcaíno
*Centro Hospitalar Universitário do Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: In 1922, Stevens and Johnson described 
a strikingly distinct disease in 2 children as an “extraordinary, 
generalized eruption with continued fever, inflamed buccal mucosa 
and severe purulent conjunctivitis.”
Methods: We herein present the case of a 49-year-old man with 
a history of stage IV follicular lymphoma that was being treated 
with antibiotics for an infected skin ulcer. On the 14th day of his 
hospital stay he developed a generalized pruritic and painful skin 
rash with oral mucosal involvement. The rash progressed with the 
formation of vesicles and skin erosions.
Results: The patient was submitted to a skin biopsy to try to dis-
tinguish between the clinical differential diagnosis of erythema 
multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. We received a skin 
punch biopsy measuring 6 mm diameter and 4 mm thick with no 
apparent lesions on the epidermal surface. Histologic examina-
tion showed numerous apoptotic bodies at different levels of the 
epidermis, in some areas with confluent necrosis of the epider-
mis and focal lymphocyte exocytosis. Apoptotic bodies were also 
identified on the follicular epithelium. The dermis showed only 
a mild superficial perivascular lymphohistiocytic inflammation. 
All these changes were compatible with the clinical diagnosis of 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome and the presumable drug responsible 
was piperacillin-tazobactam.
Conclusion: Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a rare, severe, 
immune-mediated cutaneous reaction usually secondary to an idi-
osyncratic reaction to medication, although infection with Myco-
plasma pneumoniae is also a well-documented cause. The histo-
logic features are variable epidermal apoptosis associated with 
basal cell hydropic degeneration or subepidermal vesiculation. 
Lymphocytic exocytosis may be present and a mild perivascular 
infiltrate of lymphocytes, macrophages, and melanophages is 
present in the superficial dermis. The mortality is approximately 
5% and, sadly, our patient died 4 days after the skin biopsy.

Pleomorphic basal cell carcinoma of the eyelid: an uncom-
mon case report
S. Mabrouk*, N. Abdessayed, Z. Nfikha, Y. Fejji, Z. Lajmi, L. 
Knani, M. Mokni
*Department of pathology, Farhat Hached university hospital, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Pleomorphic basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
is a rare variant of BCC characterized by the presence of scattered 
large, pleomorphic cells. It is commonly located on the head and neck. 
The prevalence is unknown, fewer than 60 cases are reported in the 
literature.
Methods: A 82-year-old female without any particular medical 
history, presented with a left lower external eyelid nodule. 
Ophthalmic examination revealed a firm pigmented lesion at the 
eyelid, measuring 1 cm with surface irregularity and ulceration, 
and bleeding on contact. BCC was suspected, and a full-thickness 
eyelid resection was performed. The specimen was oriented and 
referred to pathological diagnosis.
Results: On gross examination, the specimen is centered by 
pigmented lesion with ulcerating surface measuring 1cm x 0,9cm. 
Surgical margins were distant from the lesion. On histological 
examination, the lesion was composed of nests of basaloid cells 
with peripheral palisading and stromal retraction. Tumour cells 
were predominantly small with scant cytoplasm and monotonous 
nuclei. Scattered giant cells with large, irregular, hyperchromatic 
nuclei and prominent nucleoli were observed. Mitoses were 
numerous with frequent atypical ones. The overall histologic 
features were highly suggestive of pleomorphic BCC. Surgical 
margins were free.
Conclusion: BCC has several histologic subtypes that often have 
variable outcomes and prognoses. Pleomorphic BCC is an uncom-
mon pathologic variant of unknown pathogenesis. Eyelid localiza-
tion is extremely rare, with only one case reported in the literature. 
The cardinal histological sign is the presence of scattered enlarged 
mononuclear and/or multinucleated tumour cells. However, the 
presence of atypical giant cells doesn’t worsen the prognosis which 
is similar to the classical variant. Histological differential diagnosis 
of BCC is sometimes challenging, especially with adnexal tumours.

*Department of Pathology, Saitama Medical University Interna-
tional Medical Center, Japan
Background & objectives: Herein, we describe an exceptionally 
rare case with superficial bowel cancer showing extensive peritoneal, 
including omental, dissemination accompanied by ovarian metastases. 
The patient, a 70-year-old postmenopausal Japanese woman, presented 
with abdominal distension.
Methods: Computed tomography revealed huge bilateral ovarian 
tumours with multiple peritoneal metastases, suggesting advanced 
ovarian cancers (cT3cNXM0). The salpingo-oophorectomy 
specimens contained grey-whitish to reddish brown, solid tumours 
with cystic formation, measuring 15x9x7 cm in the right ovary 
and 18x10.5x9 cm in the left ovary, respectively. Furthermore, 
numerous omental nodules, up to 1.2 cm in maximum diameter, 
had similar cut surface appearances.
Results: These invasive tumours were histopathologically com-
posed of tubular, cribriform and/or papillary growths of columnar 
carcinoma cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei with distinct 
nucleoli. Coagulation necroses were pronounced. Immunohisto-
chemically, the carcinoma cells were diffusely positive for cytoker-
atin (CK) 20, CDX2 and SATB2, and negative for CK7, PAX8 and 
ER. These pathological features suggested metastatic colon adeno-
carcinoma. We thus performed lower gastrointestinal endoscopy 
and detected a superficial, elevated lesion with a depressed area, 
measuring 15 mm, in the sigmoid colon, suggesting submucosal 
invasion. This lesion was pathologically confirmed to be tubu-
lar adenocarcinoma. Also, macroscopic peritoneal disseminated

lesions on the surface of the liver, subdiaphragmatic region and 
rectal serosa (numerous) were not removed.
Conclusion: It is noteworthy that so-called ‘early’ colon cancer 
can present with unusual distant metastases, mimicking primary 
ovarian cancer. We know that there is some morphological 
overlap between endometrioid carcinoma and conventional colon 
cancer. Therefore, it is worth considering a colorectal origin if 
the tumour shows endometrium-like, but monotonous, carcinoma 
cell proliferation and is free of squamous differentiation, as well 
as having notable necrotic findings on histological examinations 
of gynecological organs. An accurate diagnosis, validated by 
immunohistochemistry, will allow appropriate treatment.

Mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasm (MiNEN) 
arising from long-segment Barrettʼs oesophagus showing excep-
tionally aggressive clinical behaviour
K. Miyaguchi, T. Kawasaki*, T. Tashima, Y. Nakano, R. Jinushi, 
S. Ryozawa
*Department of Pathology, Saitama Medical University Interna-
tional Medical Center, Japan
Background & objectives: Herein, we describe the first case with 
double primary mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasm 
(MiNEN) and conventional adenocarcinoma, arising in Barrett’s 
oesophagus. A 68-year-old woman had been diagnosed with 0-IIa type 
adenocarcinoma in the background of long-segment Barrett’s oesopha-
gus, 3 years earlier.
Methods: She underwent ESD and the pathological diagnosis was 
tubular adenocarcinoma, well differentiated, with slight submu-
cosal invasion. There was no lymphovascular invasion and the mar-
gins were intact. Although annual follow-up had subsequently been 
performed, the patient was brought to the emergency room. A CT 
scan of the head showed multiple cerebral metastases and PET-CT 
revealed numerous osseous and nodal involvements.
Results: We performed upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and 
detected metachronous type 3 esophageal cancer. Multiple 
biopsy specimens histopathologically contained invasive 
neoplasm composed of neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) and 
adenocarcinoma, moderately to poorly differentiated. The NEC 
element showed diffuse proliferation of primitive cancer cells 
possessing fine-granular cytoplasm and nuclei with prominent 
nucleoli, whereas the adenocarcinoma component had tubules or 
nested growth of basophilic cells. Immunohistochemically, the 
NEC cells were diffusely positive for synaptophysin, with focal 
expressions of INSM1, chromogranin A and NCAM, whereas 
adenocarcinoma cells were mostly negative for these NE markers. 
The Ki67 labelling index was 90% at the hot spots in both types.
Conclusion: The patient died 3.5 months after the biopsy-based 
histological diagnosis. In the esophageal oncology field, patients 
with MiNEN are reportedly more likely to be diagnosed at an ear-
lier stage and have significantly longer survival than those with 
pure NEC. Unfortunately, our present Barrett’s MiNEN showed 
extremely aggressive biological behaviour.

Prevalence and impact of false negative digestive biopsies
A. Dhaoui*, D. Aloui, M. Aloui, T. Jomni, S. Ben Rejeb
*Forces de securité interieure, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Gastrointestinal (GI)endoscopy with 
biopsy is usually necessary to confirm the malignancy. However, 
biopsy results may be negative in some cases leading to a delay for 
diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of 
false negative biopsies among patients with GI-tumours.
Methods: We have retrospectively collected 46cases of 
digestive biopsies performed for GI endoscopic looking-
tumour and addressed to our pathology department (2013-
2022). Clinical and endoscopic data were retrieved from the 
patient’s medical record. Pathological findings have been 
collected from the pathology report. We have especially 
focused on: number of biopsy fragments, number of 
serial cuts performed, ulceration, inflammatory changes, 
acellular mucin, burden artifacts and first-final histological 
diagnosis.
Results: Mean age of patients was 61,1years-old with a sex ratio 
of 4,75. In 5 cases the biopsy was negative for malignancy. The 
mean number of biopsy fragments was 8(5-10). Systemic serial 
cuts were performed in 4cases (1-4). Ulceration and inflammatory 
changes were found 2cases, acellular mucin in 1case.In 3 cases, 
the histological diagnosis was villous tubular adenoma with either 
low- or high-grade dysplasia. In one case, the tumour was firstly 
diagnosed as MALT lymphoma and follicular gastritis in another 
case. In all cases, supplementary biopsies have been performed. 
The final diagnosis was mucinous adenocarcinoma (2cases), well 
differentiated adenocarcinoma (1case), signet-ring cell carcinoma 
(1case), collision tumour associating MALT-signet ring cell car-
cinoma (1case).
Conclusion: The prevalence of false negative biopsies remains low 
(10,8%). The main risk-factors associated with false negative biopsies 
is the mucinous and signet-ring cells histological subtype. The num-
ber of biopsy fragments and serial cuts doesn’t seem to impact the 
histological diagnosis. The false negative biopsies in our study didn’t 
affect the patient’s outcome since second and third biopsies have been 
performed within few days.

Multifocal small bowel adenocarcinoma associated with 
Crohn’s disease – case report
K. Kamarádová*, H. Faistová, H. Vošmiková
*Fingerland Department of Pathology, University hospital Hradec 
Kralove, Czech Republic
Background & objectives: Small bowel carcinomas are rare, but some 
predisposing factors exist including Crohn’s disease. Inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD) is also a risk factor for occurrence of synchronous 
carcinomas though affecting mostly the large bowel.
Methods: We report a case of a 37-year-old male patient with 
Crohn’s disease and multifocal small bowel adenocarcinoma of 
distal jejunum. The patient had a history of Crohn’s disease last-
ing for 15 years with previous ileo-cecal resection and progres-
sion despite the biological treatment. Currently the patient was 
admitted with acute intestinal obstruction due to complete jejunal 
stenosis.
Results: The resection specimen was composed of stenotic and 
dilated part of small bowel measuring 40 centimetres in total. 
Advanced invasive high-grade adenocarcinoma infiltrating through 
serosa was detected in the stenotic area including metastatic 
S217

infiltration of four lymph nodes. Surrounding mucosa of the stenotic 
and farther dilated bowel showed multiple extensive areas of IBD-
associated high-grade dysplasia separated by foci of non-dysplastic 
epithelium. In the background of the dysplastic changes there were 
found seven additional synchronous adenocarcinomas with variable 
depth of invasion. Predominance of not otherwise specified morphol-
ogy was seen with minority of poorly cohesive and signet-ring cell 
morphology.
Conclusion: Immunohistochemistry revealed aberrant p53 expres-
sion and loss of e-cadherin staining in neoplastic cells irrespective 
of the morphological type. Molecular analysis revealed pathogenic 
somatic mutations in TP53 and CDKN2A genes.
Hereby presented case with advanced adenocarcinoma of small 
bowel underscores the difficulty of surveillance and preventive 
strategy of small bowel IBD associated neoplasia. Presence of 
extensive preneoplastic lesion and multifocality of the neoplasia 
also points out the possible effect of field cancerization of small 
bowel mucosa in the setting of IBD.

Extra-appendiceal goblet cell adenocarcinoma: a new entity or 
an old companion in a new location?
I. Franin*, A. Ibukić, D. Brletić, D. Tomas, A. Demirović
*Department of Pathology and Cytology “Ljudevit Jurak”, Sestre 
milosrdnice University Hospital Centre, Zagreb, Croatia
Background & objectives: According to the current WHO classifi-
cation, goblet cell adenocarcinoma is a rare appendiceal amphicrine 
tumour containing goblet-like mucinous cells with variable numbers 
of endocrine and Paneth-like cells. We present a case of a goblet cell 
adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon.
Methods: A 66-year-old man was admitted to an external institu-
tion for colon tumour examination. CT scan confirmed an ascend-
ing colon neoplasm, but enlarged mesenteric and retroperitoneal 
lymph nodes were also present raising suspicion of lymphoma. A 
biopsy ruled out lymphoma and diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was 
established. The patient was transferred to our hospital for surgery 
and right sided hemicolectomy was performed.
Results: Gross examination revealed an ulcerated tumour 
measuring 5 cm with infiltration of muscular wall as well as 
extensive infiltration of the surrounding adipose tissue and 
serosal perforation. Histologic examination showed a tumour 
composed of goblet-like cells with small, compressed nuclei with 
intracytoplasmic mucin and cuboidal epithelial cells with mitotic 
activity and focal hyperchromasia. Tumour cells were arranged in 
an organoid pattern. Appendix was free of tumour. Alcian PAS stain 
highlighted the intracytoplasmic mucin. Immunohistochemical 
staining for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and synaptophysin showed a 
diffuse positive reaction. These findings were consistent with the 
diagnosis of goblet cell adenocarcinoma.
Conclusion: Several previously published cases show that goblet 
cell adenocarcinoma can also occur in other parts of the gastro-
intestinal tract. In colon, it can easily be mistaken for signet ring 
cell carcinoma. Recent studies have shown that extra-appendiceal 
goblet cell adenocarcinoma is a distinct morphological, immuno-
histochemical, immunological and transcriptomic entity. Further 
studies should compare its pathological, molecular and clinical 
characteristics with appendiceal goblet cell adenocarcinoma and 
possibly reclassify it as a new type of amphicrine tumour not lim-
ited to the appendix.

Clinicopathological features of a rare subtype of gastric 
neoplasm
D. Raduta*, L. Nichita, M. Cioplea, L. Sticlaru, E. Ignat, A. Vilaia, 
O. Stefan, G. Tudor, C. Popp
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Gastric carcinoma (GC), the third most 
common cause of cancer-related mortality, includes various subtypes, 
one of them being GC with lymphoid stroma, comprising between 1-7% 
of cases. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinicopathological 
features of GCLS.
Methods: We report the case of an 82year-old male investigated 
for an episode of massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding and 
important weight loss in another medical centre. The endoscopic 
examination revealed a gastric tumour localized on the lesser cur-
vature. After being transferred in our hospital and further investiga-
tions, the patient underwent total gastrectomy with omentectomy, 
esophago-jejunal anastomosis and regional lymphadenectomy.
Results: The macroscopic examination of the specimen revealed 
an ulcero-infiltrative lesion measuring 4.5x4x2.3 cm, infiltrating 
the whole gastric wall, without perforating the serosal layer and 
plenty whitish and firm consistency lymphatic nodes located in the 
fatty tissue nearby the tumour.
On microscopic exam, we found a poorly-differentiated malignant 
epithelial proliferation with few glandular structures, small 
trabeculae and nests of epithelial cells embedded in a dense 
lymphoid infiltrate reminiscent of lymphoid tissue. Lympho-
vascular invasion or peri-neural growth it is not detected. We 
examined 24 lymphatic nodes, half of which were found with 
metastatic carcinoma.
Conclusion: GCLS is a rare subtype of gastric cancer associated 
with EBV infection and microsatellite instability. Unlike the com-
mon subtype of GC, GCLS rather affects the proximal stomach or 
the gastric stump. The characteristic microscopic finding of GCLS 
is peritumoral and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, but medullary 
carcinoma is also described in colorectal or breast localization. 
Patients with GCLS have better survival rates than those non-
GCLS, so it’s important to recognize this subtype of GC for pre-
dicting the patient’s prognosis and particular treatments.

Incidence of dysplasia in Barrett’s oesophagus
L. Mikhaleva*, K. Maslenkina, S. Gusniev, V. Olesya, Z. Gioeva
*A.P. Avtsyn Research Institute of Human Morphology, Russia
Background & objectives: The definition of Barrett’s oesophagus is 
debatable. While most cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma develop at 
background of intestinal metaplasia (IM), molecular findings suggest 
non-IM as ancestor clone of cancer. Our aim was to compare dysplasia 
incidence in IM and non-IM.
Methods: Biopsy was performed in 142 patients with segment of 
metaplasia in distal oesophagus ranged from C0M1 to C15M15. 
Biopsy specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin 
and stained with haematoxylin-eosin and combined PASD/
Alcian Blue. Immunohistochemical evaluation with Muc2 was 
performed in dubious cases to identify true goblet cells. Dysplasia 
was confirmed by 2 pathologists experienced in gastrointestinal 
pathology.
Results: Difficulties in establishing metaplasia type because 
of so called pseudo-goblet cells occurred in 25 of 142 patients 
(17.6%), among them 23 cases (92%) appeared to be non-IM 
after immunostaining with Muc2. IM was detected in 86 patients, 
S218
Virchows Archiv (2022) 481 (Suppl 1):S1–S364
1 3
including 23 (26.74%) cases with dysplasia: 21 patients with 
low-grade and 2 patients with high-grade dysplasia. Non-IM was 
observed in 56 patients: 30 cases of cardiac type metaplasia and 
26 cases of oxynto-cardiac metaplasia. Dysplasia was identified 
in 2 patients (3.57%), both high-grade dysplasia on background of 
cardiac type metaplasia. Dysplasia was never found on background 
of oxynto-cardiac metaplasia.
Conclusion: In our single centre experience, incidence of dysplasia 
was much higher in patients with IM compared with non-IM of 
distal oesophagus (Fisher exact test, p = 0.0024), which is con-
sistent with generally accepted concept of carcinogenesis in distal 
oesophagus. Nonetheless, rate of high-grade dysplasia didn’t differ 
between groups (Fisher exact test, p = 0.6496). Almost 1/5 of cases 
with columnar-lined oesophagus was challenging for metaplasia 
type identification and required immunohistochemistry with Muc2. 
Majority of these cases appeared to be non-IM.

Immunohistochemical evaluation of diffuse gastric cancer mor-
phological variants
L. Mikhaleva*, K. Midiber, K. Maslenkina, A. Biryukov, Z. Gioeva
*A.P. Avtsyn Research Institute of Human Morphology, Russia
Background & objectives: Transcriptome analysis revealed distinct 
subtypes of diffuse-type gastric cancer (DGC): DGT arising de novo 
and DGT originating from intestinal-type gastric cancer (IGC) cells. 
The aim of our study was to develop morphological and immunohis-
tochemical criteria for subtyping of DGT.
Methods: Fifty patients with DGC were included in the study. DGT 
was established based on morphological exanimation of specimens 
stained with haematoxylin and eosin and combined PAS/AB for signet-
ring cells identification. Immunohistochemical study was performed 
with E-cadherin, CK7, CK20, CDX2, Hepatoc, Muc1, Muc2, Muc5AC, 
HER2, PD-L1. Monoclonal antibodies to MSH2, MLH-1, PMS-2 and 
MSH6 we used for microsatellite instability (MSI) detection.
Results: Four patients were HER2 positive, two patients were 
indefinite for HER2. PD-L1 staining results were the following: 
Combined Positive Score (CPS) was >1, but <10 in 4 cases, CPS 
>10, but <20 in 2 cases and CPS = 100 in one patient. MSI-High 
was detected in 2 cases and MSI-Low in one patient, both patients 
harboured MSH6 mutation. All patients with MSI were of higher 
age (> 75 years). There were no significant differences in immu-
nophenotype using extensive antibody panel, but we noticed some 
features in mucin profile special for MSI. Further investigations 
are needed to confirm our findings.
Conclusion: No significant immunophenotype features special 
for different morphological subtypes of DGC were identified, 
but we suggest that further studies of mucin profile in patients 
with MSI are of value. We suppose that older age and MSI are 
indicative for DGT originating from intestinal-type gastric cancer. 
Whether mixed type gastric cancer may represent a transitional 
form between IGC and DGT remains a question.

Oesophageal squamous papillomatosis: a case report
K. Ben Lazreg*, R. Jouini, I. Helal, F. Khanchel, R. Hedhli, S. 
Fkih, E. Ben Brahim, M. Sabbah, A. Chadli
*Habib Thameur Hospital Pathology departement, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Oesophageal squamous papilloma (OSP) is 
a benign uncommon papillary epithelial polyp with uncertain aetiology. 
It’s usually an asymptomatic solitary lesion of the lower oesophagus, 
commonly occurring in male adult. We report a rare case of Oesopha-
geal papillomatosis (OP).
Methods: 57-year-old women, with no medical history, presented 
with epigastric pain and two episodes of hematemesis. She under-
went an initial oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) with biopsy. 
Subsequently, endoscopic follow-up with repeated biopsies was 
performed.
Results: The OGD showed multiple circumferential pseudopol-
ypoid formations, spread over 6 cm of the lower oesophagus. 
Elsewhere, the oesophageal mucosa was normal. Histological 
examination of biopsy specimens, showed a papillary exophytic 
proliferation of squamous epithelium, lining fibrovascular cores of 
lamina propria. The squamous epithelium presents focal parakera-
tosis but does not exhibit dysplasia or evidence of viral infection. 
There was no invasion of the lamina propria. The final diagnosis 
was OP associated with hiatal hernia and chronic gastritis. Endo-
scopic monitoring did not reveal any progression of lesions with 
similar pathological features. The decision of medical staff was to 
continue the endoscopic surveillance.
Conclusion: Fewer than 20 cases of OP were reported in the Eng-
lish literature. Symptoms, like bleeding or dysphagia, may be seen 
in papillomatosis. Chronic irritation and HPV infection are the 
most reported aetiologies in literature. The role of HPV infection is 
not well proved. Generally, the OSP does not recur after resection. 
However, OP has an unknown potential for malignant transfor-
mation, with currently no guidelines for endoscopic surveillance. 
Therefore, more cases need to be published.

Granular cell tumour of the appendix – an extremely rare case 
report
J. Madeira*, F. Ramalhosa, C. Faria, M.R. Silva, M.A. Cipriano
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Centro Hospitalar e Universi-
tário de Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Granular cell tumour (GCT) is a benign 
lesion of neural/schwannian origin most frequently found in skin, sub-
cutaneous tissue and oral cavity mostly in black middle-age women. 
They can involve any organ, including the gastrointestinal tract. The 
appendicular involvement is extremely rare.
Methods: We report a case of a 30-year-old pregnant female, 
recurring to the emergency department with two days persistent 
pelvic pain. The blood test indicated leukocytosis, neutrophilia 
and elevated concentration of C-reactive protein. Abdominal 
ultrasonography revealed an outer appendiceal diameter of 8mm, 
with markedly thickened and stratified wall and increased density 
of the surrounding fat tissue consistent with a phlegmon.
Results: A laparoscopic appendectomy was performed. Gross 
examination showed appendiceal wall markedly thickened and the 
lumen filled with fecal material.
Histological analysis revealed a florid granulomatous chronic 
inflammation in the tip of the appendix. Adjacent there was a well-
circumscribed and uncapsulated nodule with 0.5cm in diameter 
confined to submucosa. It was formed by nests of epithelioid cells 
with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and central small 
round nuclei. It was devoid of cytological atypia and necrosis. 
Immunohistochemistry revealed S-100 diffuse strong positivity, 
suggestive of Schwann cell origin. Tumour also displayed SOX-
10 nuclear expression and CD68 membranous expression in the 
tumour and in granulomas found in the wall of the appendix.
Conclusion: 5–11% of GCT occurs in gastrointestinal tract, with 
only fourteen cases reported in the appendix. Literature suggests 
that chronic inflammation surrounding the GCT in the appendix 
may be a predisposing condition, favoring its emerging. These

findings support the hypothesis that GCT is associated with reac-
tive changes of the neural/schwannian cells, rather than a true neo-
plasm. This case documents a granulomatous appendicitis (which 
is a rare entity, <2% of appendectomies) and a GCT as a cause of 
appendicitis.

*Department of Histopathology and Cytology, Clinical Hospital 
Acibadem/Sistina, Skopje, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University 
“Goce Delchev” – Shtip., North Macedonia
Background & objectives: KRAS mutation is frequently identified in 
advanced colorectal carcinoma (CRC)and its prognostic significance 
with histological features have remained to be clarified. The aim of this 
study is to evaluate the clinicopathological and histomorphological 
characteristics in K-ras mutated patients with CRC.
Methods: In this retrospective study, 420 CRC patients who under-
went surgical treatment in our hospital (January 2018- December 
20200 have been included. K-ras mutation testing was performed 
in 265 patients, detected by Cobas K-ras mutation kit to identify 
frequent mutations (codons 12,13,61). Clinicopathological and 
histomorphological data were compared with the K-ras status and 
correlations were evaluating using Pearson’s Chi-square test.
Results: K-ras mutations were found in 148 patients (39,2%), fre-
quently identified in older males, and in advanced stages of the dis-
ease. There was association of the K-ras mutation with the degree 
of tumour differentiation (G3), tumour necrosis and inflammatory 
response of the tumour tissue (p<0.05). No association was found 
between the mutational status and the tumour extention, localiza-
tion, lymphonodal status and tumour type.
Conclusion: According to the certain limitations of this retro-
spective study using a single detection kit that include common 
codon changes in K-ras gene it is obvious that further studies on 
the histological results and their prognostic value of rare KRAS 
codon variants are necessary. From the other perspective, the pre-
sent study demonstrated a moderate association between KRAS-
mutated CRCs and specific histology, and, to a certain degree, 
an association between histology and prognosis, according to 
KRAS mutation status.

*Medical Faculty, Trakia University, Bulgaria
Background & objectives: Many molecular and cellular factors play 
an important role for development of gastric cancer prognosis and pro-
gression. The aim of our study was to investigate infiltration with IL-23 
positive dendritic cells (DCs) and clinicomorphological parameters in 
the progression of GC.
Methods: We investigated 40 patients, having GC immunohis-
tochemically with antibodies against IL-23, CD83 and S100. 
The clinicopathological parameters and survival were analysed 
retrospectively.
Results: The infiltration with IL-23+DCs in tumour stroma was 
26.92+/-7.5 cells/mm2, and in tumour border - 59.3+/-11.8 cells/
mm2 (p=0.024, Wilcoxon Signed rank test). 87.1% of the patients 
with low infiltration were in T3 and T4 tumour stage vs. close to 
50% from group of patients with high infiltration were in the same 
stage (р=0.003). In addition, 65% from low differentiated tumours 
were with low infiltration with DCs, vs. low infiltrated with DCs 
moderate and high differentiated tumours (р<0.001).
Conclusion: Our results suggest that IL-23 positive dendritic cells 
play role in tumour progression and could be useful as a prognostic 
marker of in gastric cancer patients.

Faculty of Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Human leucocyte antigen(HLA)-G is a 
powerful molecule involved in immune tolerance. Previous studies 
have proposed HLA-G as a potentially good candidate for immune-
checkpoint target immunotherapy. We aimed to assess the expression 
of HLA-G in colorectal cancer(CRC) according to clinicopathological 
characteristics.
Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on a total 
of 22 patients with CRC and their adjacent normal tissues using 
the 4H84 anti-HLA-G monoclonal antibody. Staining intensity was 
assessed. Expression levels were classified semi-quantitatively 
based on immunoreactive cells percentage. Clinico-pathological 
characteristics were recorded.
Results: Patients age range was of 31 to 93 years (mean = 63 
years). HLA-G was significantly expressed in all CRC tissues 
(100%) and under-represented in normal tissues (10%) (Mann 
Whitney U test: p< 0.0001). The scores of expression of HLA-G 
in tumour tissues were highly intensive compared to normal tissues 
(p<0.0001). Interestingly, high HLA-G expression was reported in 
early stages (I+II) compared to advanced stages (IV+V) without 
significance (p=0.635).
Conclusion: Altogether, our results showed that HLA-G could 
be proposed as a candidate biomarker that can be useful for the 
evaluation of patients’ prognosis and a potential target for CRC 
therapy.

Fibrosis of the muscular layer of the colon as a predictor of the 
complicated course of diverticulosis
L. Mikhaleva*, A. Konyukova, N. Gutyirchik
*A.P. Avtsyn Research Institute of Human Morphology, Russia
Background & objectives: Colonic diverticulosis is an actual prob-
lem of modern healthcare with complicated diverticulosis being a life 
threatening condition. The aim of our study is to determine the mor-
phological predictors of the complicated diverticulosis.
Methods: We analysed 79 consecutive cases of left-sided hemi-
colectomy, 15 cases were studied comprehensively. Surgical speci-
mens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formaline and stained with 
haematoxylin and eosin and Mallory. Morphometric evaluation was 
performed in order to assess the area of fibrosis in the muscular 
layer of the colon outside the diverticula in 20 fields of view at 
x200 magnification.
Results: Among 15 extensively studied cases 6 patients (40.0%) 
had complicated diverticulosis of the colon, 5 (33.0%) presented

with uncomplicated diverticulosis and 4 (27.0%) had no diverticula 
of the colon (comparison group). The area of fibrosis in muscu-
lar layer of colon progressively enhanced from comparison group 
to complicated diverticulosis group. In cases with complicated 
colonic diverticulosis fibrosis of the muscular membrane was 106.5 
times more prominent (21.3%) and in cases with uncomplicated 
diverticulosis - 39 times more extensive (7.8%), both compared 
with comparison group (0.2%).
Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that the area of fibro-
sis of the muscular membrane is significantly more extensive in 
patients with complicated colonic diverticulosis (106.5 times) and 
in patients with uncomplicated course of diverticulosis (39 times) 
compares with the comparison group. Our results indicate that the 
presence of fibrosis in the muscular membrane of the colon should 
be considered as a predictor of the development of diverticulosis, 
and its severity being a predisposing factor for complicated course 
of the disease.

An unusual histopathological morphology of collagenous 
gastritis
Z.J.O. Lee*, J. Lum
*Department of Pathology, National University Hospital, Singapore
Background & objectives: Collagenous gastritis is an extremely rare 
and poorly understood disease defined by subepithelial collagen deposi-
tion and inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria.
Methods: We present the case of a 27-year-old women with 
dyspepsia for 2 to 3 years with no other red flag symptoms and 
distinctive findings in her physical examination. Extensive blood 
workup including autoimmune disease screening panel, computed 
tomography and upper endoscopy were performed.
Results: The blood workup revealed features of iron deficiency 
anaemia. Computed tomography scan demonstrated stomach antral 
wall thickening with no other significant findings within the rest 
of the intestinal tract. An upper endoscopy showed diffuse nodular 
thickening in stomach antrum and corpus with severe atrophy. His-
topathological examination of the stomach biopsy specimen showed 
atrophic gastritis with extensive collagen deposition within the sub-
epithelial region and extending throughout the lamina propria into 
the submucosa, confirmed by masson-trichrome stain. No amyloid 
deposition or features of IGG4 related disease demonstrated. A 
diagnosis of collagenous gastritis was made after excluding dif-
ferential diagnoses such as systemic sclerosis and IgG4-related 
disease.
Conclusion: We present an unusual case of collagenous gastritis 
with diffuse collagen deposition within the full thickness of the 
mucosa. Although such extensive collagen deposition secondary to 
autoimmune and IgG4-related conditions must be considered, our 
case has shown that collagenous gastritis cannot be excluded. We 
hope it’s unusual finding will benefit other diagnosing clinicians 
having similar problems.

Prognostic significance of cyclin D1 over-expression in colo-
rectal cancer
A. Dhaoui*, D. Aloui, M. Safer, S. Ben Rejeb, M. Aloui, R. Bahl-
oul, T. Jomni
*Forces de securité interieure, Tunisia
Background & objectives: CyclinD1 is a key regulatory protein and 
is over-expressed in many cancers.The main aim of the study is to 
examine the expression pattern of cyclin D1 and its correlation with 
the different clinicopathological features in colorectal cancer (CRC).
Methods: The archival tumour blocks were analysed using 
immunohistochemistry for CyclinD1 over-expression in 32 
CRC patients diagnosed from 2013 to 2019 at the Pathology 
Department Interior security hospital,Tunisia.The nuclear 
staining of cyclin D1 was reported in score to define Low and 
High score.Fisher’s exact tests was performed to extract the 
significant level of association between cyclinD1 over-expression 
and the clinicopathological parameters.
Results: Mean age of patients was 64,5 with a sex ratio of 2,2. 
The commonest histological type was adenocarcinoma, seen in 
30 cases (94%), and the majority of the tumours were moderately 
differentiated. Approximately 62.5% of cases had positive lymph 
node. Distant metastases were seen in 46% of cases.Cyclin D1 
over-expression was absent in normal mucosa. In CRC, Cyclin 
D1 was expressed at high levels in 46% of case. No significant 
correlation was observed between Cyclin D1 over-expression and 
age, gender, tumour size, location, type, tumour differentiation, 
lymph node involvement and lymphovascular invasion. However, 
Cyclin D1 over-expression exhibited a significant correlation 
with, distant metastasis (p=0.034) and AJCC staging (p=0.034).
Conclusion: The role of cyclin D1 over-expression in CRC 
is somewhat controversial.While some reports have observed 
a significant association between its expression and poor 
survival outcomes, others have reported it as a marker of a good 
prognosis. In our study, Cyclin D1 over-expression increases 
during normal-adenoma-carcinoma sequence. The significant 
association observed between Cyclin D1 over-expression, distant 
metastasis and advanced tumour stage clearly suggest the role of 
Cyclin D1 in the carcinogenesis and progression of CRC.

Mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasm 
(MiNEN) of the Vater Ampulla in a Portuguese patient: a 
case report
C. Courelas*, R. Oliveira, J. Gama, J. Madeira, A. Alves, M.A. 
Cipriano
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário, Portugal
Background & objectives: Mixed neuroendocrine-non-
neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs) are defined by WHO as 
mixed neoplasms with neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine 
components. Described in various organs, these neoplasms are 
commonly found in the Pancreas and Gastrointestinal tract, being 
rare in the Vater ampulla.
Methods: We describe a case of a 74-year-old woman, referred 
to our hospital’s oncologic reference centre for hepatobiliary 
and pancreatic cancer. Patient initially presented with new-onset 
Diabetes and was diagnosed with a tumour of the Ampulla, without 
radiological evidence of metastatic disease. Cytology examination 
from fine needle aspiration suggested carcinoma.
Results: A pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. On gross 
examination there was a lesion confined to the Ampulla with 2.4 
cm, composed of a white and friable tissue. Histopathologic exami-
nation revealed an ampullary mixed neoplasm with a large cell 
neuroendocrine carcinoma and a non-neuroendocrine component: 
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, with pancreatobiliary 
phenotype without microsatellite instability. Tumour was limited 
to Ampulla and lymph nodes were free from metastatic disease 
– pTMN: T1a N0.
Conclusion: MiNENs of the Ampulla of Vater are described only 
in scarce case reports. MiNEN are highly aggressive and with high

risk of metastatic disease, but in our case the tumour was detected 
in an early stage and was confined to the Ampulla. After 2 months 
the patient is alive and well without signs of relapse. Further inves-
tigation is needed to expand our knowledge and improve diagnosis 
and treatment of these patients.

Intestinal obstruction as initial manifestation of lobular breast 
cancer metastasis. A case report
G. Galanopoulos*, E. Souka, N. Novkovic, C. Dastamani, E. Tso-
volou, K. Manoloudaki
*Pathology Department Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Breast cancer is the most prevalent malig-
nancy affecting women, usually metastasizing to the bones, lung and 
liver. Gastrointestinal tract metastases are rare, mostly involving the 
stomach. An unusual case of lobular breast cancer primarly detected 
as abdominal carcinomatosis is presented.
Methods: A 49-year-old woman without a known history of breast 
cancer was admitted with ileus, having mentioned only minor 
symptoms of dyspepsia during the last 6 months. The exploratory 
laparotomy revealed massive carcinomatosis affecting the perito-
neum, ovaries, cecum and transverse colon. Bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy, right hemicolectomy and partial peritonectomy 
were performed. Grossly, the tumour areas had a brownish micro-
nodular appearance.
Results: Microscopically, the tumour consisted of small sized cells 
with round or ovoid nuclei and scant cytoplasm arranged in single 
files, cords and nests. The immunohistochemical analysis showed 
positive staining for CK7, GATA 3, GCDFP-1, CK903, P120 and 
negative for CDX2, CK20, and e-cadherin. ER and PR receptors 
were strongly positive (80% and 40% respectively). Her2/neu was 
negative (1+). Both morphological and immunohistochemical 
results confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic lobular breast cancer. 
No abnormal findings were found on breast ultrasound and digital 
mammography that followed.
Conclusion: Abdominal carcinomatosis of breast cancer has a 
prevalence of 0.7% and can be detected on initial diagnosis in some 
cases. Since the signet-ring morphology of lobular carcinoma may 
mimic gastric carcinoma, differential diagnosis may be challeng-
ing. Even with a known history of breast cancer, abdominal metas-
tases can be overlooked on a long disease-free interval. Immu-
nohistochemical analyses are necessary in the majority of cases.

Crawling-type gastric adenocarcinoma with progression to 
signet-ring cell (diffuse) carcinoma
M. Souto de Moura*, I. Gullo, C. Fleming, C. Peixoto, J. Lopes, 
C. Fátima
*Department of Pathology, IPO-Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Crawling-type gastric adenocarcinoma 
(CTAC), also designated as intestinal-type adenocarcinoma with 
anastomosing glands, is a rare variant of gastric cancer with specific 
morphological and molecular characteristics. We present two cases of 
CTAC and review the morpho-molecular features of this rare entity.
Methods: Case 1: 61-year-old woman referred to our hospital with 
the diagnosis of diffuse/signet-ring cell (SRC) carcinoma of the 
antrum. Endoscopy revealed a 1.2x1.0 cm lesion, slightly elevated 
and centrally depressed, removed by endoscopic submucosal dis-
section (ESD).
Case 2: 77-year-old woman referred for SRC carcinoma of the 
incisura. Endoscopy revealed focal irregularity of gastric mucosa 
with 0.5x0.2 cm, removed by ESD.
Results: Both lesions consisted of branching, anastomosing, 
“letter-shaped” glands with low-grade atypia. Intramucosal 
diffuse (SRC) carcinoma (pT1a) was identified adjacent to the 
glandular component, representing a major part of the lesion in 
case 1 and only a small focus in case 2. Neoplastic glands displayed 
gastric phenotype in case 1; by immunohistochemistry, there was 
expression of MUC5AC and MUC6 in the glandular component; 
intestinal markers (CDX2, CD10, and MUC2) were negative and 
the SRCC component showed abnormal E-cadherin expression. 
Case 2 was almost entirely constituted by anastomosing glands 
with goblet cells, mimicking dystrophic intestinal metaplasia (IM), 
and IM was observed in the background mucosa.
Conclusion: CTAC associated to diffuse (SRC) carcinoma rep-
resents a rare subtype of gastric cancer with distinctive morpho-
logic and molecular characteristics. Its recognition is crucial, due 
to the possible progression to diffuse (SRC) gastric carcinoma 
(doi:10.1007/s10120-012-0173-2), as occurred in our cases. CTAC 
may harbour molecular alterations typically found in diffuse gas-
tric carcinoma (doi:10.1038/s41379-018-0181-9), which offer an 
explanation for CTAC de-differentiation. Pathologists should be 
aware of this peculiar entity, also for the importance of distin-
guishing CTAC from its mimickers, namely dystrophic intestinal 
metaplasia.

Hepatoid gastric carcinoma metastatic to the skin - a case 
report
C. Valavanis*, N. Novkovic, G. Stanc, S. Stasinopoulou, N. 
Kopanakis, E. Souka
*Molecular Pathology Unit Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach 
(HAS) is a rare aggressive tumour with hepatocellular differentiation. 
Skin metastasis of HAS is an unusual site. It usually occurs in elderly 
patients and often is diagnosed in advanced stage.
Methods: A 87-years-old male was presented to our hospital for 
a large skin lesion on the back. A skin biopsy was made. There 
is no clinical history of cancer.
Results: The pathologic examination revealed, in the subcuta-
neous tissue, an invasive high-grade carcinoma with solid and 
tubular pattern, intracellular mucin producing cells (signet-ring 
like cells) and necrosis. Histochemical stains PAS (+), Alcian 
Blue (+) and PAS-D (-) showed the presence of neutral and acid 
mucins.
The immunohistochemistry was positive for CK7, EMA(MUC1), 
MUC5AC, CA9/19, HepPar1, TTF-1 (cytoplasmic expression). 
Ki-67 was positive in 50% of neoplastic cells. Negative immuno-
reactivity was found for Napsin A, CK20, CDX2, MUC2, Melan 
A, HMB45 and S-100. Based on morphological and immunohis-
tochemical features a diagnosis of a high grade hepatoid adeno-
carcinoma with putative gastrointestinal origin was made.
Further investigation confirmed the gastric origin.
Conclusion: The HAS is a very rare entity. Making the diag-
nosis of this tumour type is a dilemma for the pathologist and 
the clinician and may lead to misdiagnosis. The main differen-
tial diagnosis is with hepatocellular carcinoma, especially if the 
primary lesion is found in the liver. Due to its rarity, there is 
no consensus regarding therapy. Treatment of metastatic disease 
remains to be defined.

The effect of counting mitosis by phosphohistone-3 
immunohistochemistry on risk categorization in 
gastrointestinal stromal tumours
G. Bülbül*, Ö. Sağol, M. Ünlü, S. Sarıoğlu
*Dokuz Eylül University Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: The number of mitoses is among the 
criteria for risk categorization in gastrointestinal stromal tumours 
(GISTs). In this series, mitotic count by phosphohistone-3 (PHH3), 
a mitotic biomarker, is compared with hematoxylin&eosin (H&E) 
mitotic counting to understand risk category migration.
Methods: In a series of 38 GIST patients, mitosis was counted 
with 3 methods, in 5 mm2 area: 1) All the mitotic figures in 
H&E stain (H&EM), 2) Only PHH3 positive cells with mitotic 
morphology (PHH3+MM), 3) All PHH3 positive cells (PHH3+). 
The risk group of each case was determined with each method 
and stage migration with PHH3 methods was evaluated.
Results: The number of mitoses was lower in 4 (10.50%) cases, equal 
in 8 (21%) cases, and higher in 26 (68.50%) cases in PHH3+MM 
compared with H&EM method. In the PHH3+MM method, the risk 
category was increased in 5 (13%) patients, compared with H&EM.
In the PHH3+ method, including tumour nuclei probably at pro-
phase, rates were higher than the first method. The number of 
mitoses was equal in 5 (13%) and higher in 33 (87%) cases; 16 
(42%) patients were reclassified in a higher risk category com-
pared with H&EM. None of our patients migrated to a lower risk 
category group in both methods.
Conclusion: Our results emphasize that when the method is 
changed, there is a migration to a higher risk category in GISTs. 
Therefore, H&EM should be the gold standard till the morpho-
logic criteria of alternative methods like PHH3 counting is strictly 
described and risk categorization according to such methods is 
specified in large series with prognostic information.

Primary retroperitoneal mucinous neoplasia with borderline 
malignancy / with low malignant potential
H. Geddert*, T. Rüdiger, J. Baral
*Institute of Pathology, Municipal Hospital of Karlsruhe, Germany
Background & objectives: An 83-year-old female patient 
complained of leg swelling present for several weeks. MRI imaging 
showed a left-sided, very large multiloculated cystic lesion, 
extending from the renal lodge to the inguinal canal.
Methods: Thin-walled cysts without internal structure were ini-
tially interpreted as lymphangioma. An area of contrast-enhancing 
intraluminal proliferations in the mid-abdomen was considered a 
secondary malignancy. Intraoperatively, a 29 x 20 x 7 cm mass 
fused to the descending colon was found. Complete surgical 
removal without cyst rupture was achieved.
Results: Macroscopically, several cysts filled with viscous mucus 
were noted. Microscopically, the fibrous wall was lined by mucinous 
epithelium without cytological atypia. The suspicious finding on 
imaging corresponded to a thick-walled cyst with complex papillae, 
low-grade atypia and a markedly increased proliferation index with 
Ki-67. Immunohistochemistry confirmed intestinal differentiation with 
positivity for CDX-2, CK20, CEA, mucin2, mucin 5AC, and ß-catenin. 
Microscopically, there was also focal epithelial rupture with associated 
histiocytic demarcation and calcifications as well as fibrous adherence 
to the colonic wall. An infiltrative growth pattern was not found.
Conclusion: We diagnose the very rare entity of a primary 
retroperitoneal mucinous tumour of borderline malignancy/ with 
low malignant potential. Metaplastic emergence from scattered 
multipotent mesothelial cells is a widely accepted theory regarding 
the histogenesis of these lesions. Currently, the patient remains 
well at follow up of six months without any additional therapy. 
A favourable prognosis can be assumed with complete surgical 
removal.

A rare case of colon adenosquamous carcinoma
E. Souka*, G. Galanopoulos, N. Novkovic, L. Karelis, P. Manikis, 
G. Stanc
*Pathology Department Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Colon adenocarcinoma (AC) is the third 
commonest carcinoma worldwide, but primary colon adenosquamous 
carcinoma (ASC) is an unusual variant accounting for < 0,1% of the 
tumours. We present a rare case of colon adenocarcinoma and brief 
review of the literature.
Methods: A 53-year-old male with hematochezia underwent 
colonoscopy with endoscopic polypectomy and ink spotting for an 
ascending colon polyp. Microscopic examination revealed an ade-
noma with high grade dysplasia. Subsequently a right colectomy 
was performed. On gross sectioning, we observed a haemorrhagic 
inked area of the mucosal surface measuring 3cm and thorough 
sampling was performed.
Results: Microscopical examination revealed residual adenomatous 
elements of the mucosa with low grade epithelial dysplasia and an 
underlying submucosal carcinoma, low grade. It consisted of a well 
differentiated glandular carcinomatous component with a CK7(-), 
CK20(+), CDX2(+) immunophenotype and a well differentiated 
squamous cell carcinomatous component with a p63(+), 
p40(+), CK5/6(+) immunophenotype. The morphological and 
immunohistochemical findings were consistent with an ascending 
colon adenosquamous carcinoma.
Conclusion: Colon ASC is more commonly located at the right 
colon. There are four hypotheses on the ASC histogenesis that 
include ectopic squamous cells, transformation of uncommitted 
basal cells, squamous metaplasia of glandular epithelium and 
squamous metaplasia of adenocarcinoma cells. ASC has worse 
prognosis than AC, since 5-year survival rates of ASC and AC are 
approximately 30% and 50–60%, respectively and complete surgi-
cal excision is mandatory.

Glomus coccygeum: a case report of an incidental finding
C.M. Vieru*, Y. Gómez Navarro, M. Garcia Martos
*Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Spain
Background & objectives: Glomus coccygeum is a phylogenetic 
vestigial anatomical structure consisting of an arteriovenous anasto-
mosis surrounded by glomus cells, involved in thermoregulation. It is 
incidentally found in sacrococcygeal resection specimens resected in 
patients with coccygodinia or advanced rectal and uterine carcinomas.
Methods: We describe a case of glomus coccygeum incidentally 
identified in the recurrence sacrococcygeal resection specimen of 
a 52 years-old man diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma with 
mucinous differentiation.
Results: Macroscopically, it was a well-defined whitish nodular 
lesion with cartilaginous consistency, measuring 0,6x0,5 cm. His-
tologic examination revealed a well-circumscribed appearance with 
densely packed clusters and nests of glomic cells, intimately associ-
ated with vascular channels and nerve fibres, embedded in fibrous 
connective tissue. The cells were epithelioid, with eosinophilic 
S223

cytoplasm and round nuclei with finely dispersed chromatin. Cel-
lular atypia and necrosis were absent. Immunohistochemistry stains 
revealed the epithelioid cells to be positive for muscle specific 
actin, vimentin and CD34 and negative for epithelial markers, 
EMA, neuroendocrine markers and enolase, with low proliferative 
activity. S-100 and CD31 stains highlighted associated nerve fibres 
and endothelial cells lining blood vessels, respectively.
Conclusion: Glomus coccygeum is a nonpathological structure 
whose incidentally observation may cause significant problems 
for pathologists unfamiliar with this lesion. According to the 
literature, its prevalence and functional significance are uncertain 
but its accurate diagnosis is important to avoid confusion with 
other sacral tumours.

Epidemiological, clinical, and pathological aspects of early gas-
tric cancer in Tunisian people

T. Boudawara, R. Kallel
*Department of Pathology, Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, 
Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Early gastric cancer (EGC) is defined 
as being confined to gastric mucosa or submucosa. Its detection has 
increased in recent years due to advances in endoscopic techniques. 
Our aim is to analyse it’s epidemiological and clinico-pathological 
characteristics in Tunisian patients.
Methods: We collected, during 30 years, 18 cases of EGC, diag-
nosed in the department of pathology of Habib Bourguiba Hospital 
within the period lasting from January 1992 to December 2021.
Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 57,8 years witha sex-
ratio of 2. Fibroscopy showed an ulcerated aspect of the mucosa. 
The metastatic workup revealed inguinal lymphadenopaties in only 
one case. Patients underwent either total or sub-total gastrectomy. 
Median tumour size was 2,4 cm. It was mostly located in the lesser 
curvature (7 cases). Histologically, half patients had a carcinoma 
limited to the mucosa and the onther half had a carcinoma extend-
ing to the submucosa. Helicobacter pylori infection was associated 
in 66,6% cases. Rate of lymph node metastasis was 0% in patients 
with adenocarcinoma confined to the mucosa, yet it was 44,4% in 
patients with carcinoma extending to the submucosa.
Conclusion: Prognosis of EGC is excellent. The disease-free 
5-year survival rate usually exceeds 90%. Patients with high risk 
of recurrence may be identified in relation with prognostic factors 
like histopatologic type, parietal extension and mainly lymph node 
invasion. Endoscopic mucosal resection can be indicated for EGCs 
confined to the mucosa having virtually no possibility of lymph 
node metastasis.

T. Dot Gomara, A. Pasco, M.C. Llanos Chavarri, R. Guarch Troyas, 
M. Garcia Martos, A. Panizo Santos
*Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: Endometriosis is a benign gynecologi-
cal condition. It sometimes appears in the appendix mimicking acute 
appendicitis or as an incidental finding in appendectomy specimens 
resected for other gynecologic or digestive pathologies, or other condi-
tions of the appendix such as mucocele.
Methods: The pathology archives of two University Hospitals 
were reviewed to search for cases with a diagnosis of appendicular 
endometriosis in a 20-year period (2000-2022). The slides were 
reviewed for microscopic data of interest. The medical records of 
the patients were reviewed for demographic and clinical data that 
might have some implication with this pathology. A descriptive 
statistical analysis was performed.
Results: The sample was 105 women, age range 15-91 years 
(median 39.47). 64 patients had history of: endometriosis (21%), 
pregnancy/abortion (49.5%) and tumours (10.5%).70.5% presented 
as acute abdomen. Appendectomy was performed in the context of 
intestinal subocclusion in 9.5% cases.Endometriosis was mainly 
located at the tip (55.2%) followed by body and base. As for wall 
involvement in decreasing order: muscularis propria (50.5%), ser-
osa and subserosa. The predominant type of endometrial stroma 
was atrophic along smooth muscle hyplerplasia. The most fre-
quent accompanying histological findings were acute appendici-
tis (41%) and periapendicitis (34.3%).No epithelial proliferative 
changes with atypia or malignant transformation were identified. 
In 16 patients, endometriosis was found in other locations (8.6% 
gynecologic, 6.7% ileal).
Conclusion: Appendiceal endometriosis occurs in a wide age 
range. There is a high prevalence of previous gynecobstetric his-
tory in affected patients. Clinically, the most frequent presentation 
of appendiceal endometriosis is acute appendicitis, thus it should 
be included in the differential diagnosis in women presenting with 
pain in the right iliac fosa. It can be found incidentally accompany-
ing other pathologies.

Primary leiomyosarcoma of the stomach: a case report
F. Ozden*, A. Cakir
*Department of Pathology, Istanbul Medipol University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Gastric leiomyosarcomas are extremely 
rare tumours. Few cases have been reported since the early 2000s, 
which can be considered the “post-CD117” era. It is thought that most 
of the cases reported before this period are gastrointestinal stromal 
tumours.
Methods: A 72-year-old female presented with abdominal pain, 
loss of appetite, anaemia, and melena for the past 7 days. Gas-
troscopy revealed a giant polypoid mass in the gastric fundus 
and body. Biopsies were obtained and reported as sarcoma with 
smooth muscle differentiation. PET/CT examination showed no 
suspicious metastatic lesions and the patient was treated with 
partial gastrectomy.
Results: Macroscopic examination demonstrated a 12x9x4,5 cm 
protruding giant polypoid/nodular mass with a central necrotic 
depressed area. Microscopically tumour showed full-thickness 
invasion with both infiltrative and expansile borders and consisted 
of spindle-shaped atypical cells with brisk mitotic activity. There 
was 10 % of necrosis and up to 44 mitoses in 10 high-power fields. 
Immunohistochemically tumour cells were positive for SMA, 
Caldesmon, Calponin, and Desmin whereas CD117, DOG-1, CD34, 
MyoD1, Myogenin, S100, and ALK were negative. KI-67 prolif-
eration index was 70%. There was no evidence of lymphovascular 
or perineural invasion. Surgical margins were free from tumour. 
The case was signed out as leiomyosarcoma, grade 3, and score 6 
according to FNCLCC.
Conclusion: Gastric leiomyosarcomas are rare tumours and 
the diagnosis can be challenging without immunohistochemical 
analysis like in resource-limited laboratories. Even 
immunohistochemical findings can sometimes be confusing, as 
caldesmon, known to show smooth muscle differentiation, can be

positive in some GISTs. Treatment largely depends on the surgery. 
Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy have shown only limited 
benefit in the treatment.

Background & objectives: Gastric serrated neoplasia are recently rec-
ognized entities that has been rarely described and poorly character-
ized. Fewer than 16 cases of gastric serrated adenomas were reported. 
We present a less common case of Serrated adenocarcinoma developed 
on a gastric hyperplastic polyp(GHP).
Methods: A 69-year-old woman with no past medical facts, pre-
sented vomiting, gastric pain, and loss of weight. An upper endos-
copy followed by CT scan were performed. Finally, the patient 
underwent subtotal gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy and Fin-
esterer gastrojejunal anastomosis.
Results: The upper endoscopy showed a circumferential antral 
tumour. CT scan confirmed its presence and showed an associa-
tion with perigastric lymph nodes with no hepatic or pulmonary 
metastases. Gross examination of the later specimen showed an 
exophytic, ulcerated and infiltrative tumour in the antrum. Histo-
logically, there was a Carcinomatous component showing glands 
with marked serrated neoplastic epithelium resulting in a saw-
tooth like architecture. The serrated glands were covered by pleo-
morphic cells. The tumour was developed on hyperplastic polyp. 
No metastases were detected in any of the 30 lymph nodes and 
the tumour was classified pT3N0. Elsewhere, the gastric mucosa 
showed chronic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia.
Conclusion: Malignant transformation of GHP is very uncommon 
with an incidence ranging from 0.3 to 3%. Serrated gastric neo-
plasia are also exceptional lesions. The first case published was a 
degenerated serrated adenoma described by Rubio. The invasive 
carcinoma component of degenerated serrated adenomas, described 
in literature, may retain the serrated configuration. Immunophe-
notypic and molecular features of 9 gastric serrated adenomas 
were explored. They don’t completely share the same profile of 
its colorectal counterpart. Therefore, more cases are needed to be 
published.

Collagenous gastritis: clinico-pathological spectrum of 4 cases 
in a 28 year single centre retrospective study
C. Cerezo*, A. Larrea, C. Fuertes, A. Pasco, G. De Lima
*Hospital Universitario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: Collagenous gastritis is an uncommon dis-
ease characterized by the deposition of a subepithelial collagen band 
thicker than 10 μm and the presence of inflamatory mononuclear cells 
in the lamina propia. We report the clinical and histopathologic features 
of this disease.
Methods: We performed a single-centre, retrospective study of 
patients with confirmed collagenous gastritis over a 28- year 
period of time found in our database. The following param-
eters were recorded: patient clinical history, endoscopic find-
ings, histologic features, treatments and the presence of other 
diseases.
Results: The study consisted of 4 cases. The median age was 12 years. 
There was not gender predominance (2 females, 2 males). All of them 
presented abdominal pain and 2 also had anaemia at diagnosis. The 
endoscopic findings were: mucosal erythema (n=2), exudates (n=1) 
and nodularity (n=1). The distribution of collagen deposition was: 
corpus (n=1), antrum (n=1), corpus and antrum (n=1) and fundus, 
antrum and cardias (n=1). 3 presented acute gastritis and none had the 
evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection. One of the patients (25%) 
had been previously diagnosed of celiac disease (n=1). 3 patients were 
treated with iron and proton-pump inhibitor and the other one did not 
received farmacologic treatment.
Conclusion: Although collagenous gastritis is a rare clinicopathology 
entity, familiarity and awareness of the disease is vital for accurate 
pathological diagnosis. The most frequent symptom at diagnosis is 
abdominal pain. The endoscopic findings are nonespecific, varying 
from mucosal erythema, exudates and nodularity. There is a variability 
in the collagen deposition localization. There does not seem to be asso-
ciation between gastritis and Helicobacter pylori infection. Commonly, 
is associated with other autoinmunne disorders such as celiac disease.

A rare case of gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) of the 
appendix
O. McCabe*, C. Dick, E. Macduff, W. Smith
*Pathology Department, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, 
United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) 
are the most common gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumours. However, 
less than 1% of cases arise within the appendix, and few cases are 
reported in previous literature.
We present a case of appendiceal GIST presenting as acute 
appendicitis.
Methods: A 57-year-old male presented with a three day history 
of lower abdominal pain and nausea. A computed topography 
(CT) scan showed features of acute appendicitis and an enhancing 
soft tissue lesion at the appendix tip. The patient underwent 
laparoscopic appendicectomy.
Results: Macroscopically the appendix showed a 10x10mm firm pale 
area present within the tip. Microscopy showed a nodular aggregate of 
ovoid, spindled and polygonal cells, with admixed dense pink spheri-
cal deposits. The tumour cells showed positive staining with CD117, 
DOG1 and CD34. Staining was negative with BCL-2, CD56, CD99, 
S100, SMA, STAT6, synaptophysin, desmin and ALK1, confirming 
a diagnosis of GIST. The mitotic count was one per 50 high powered 
fields. After multi-disciplinary team discussion this patient was man-
aged as a low-risk GIST with planned radiological interval follow up. 
The patient has remained well post-operatively.
Conclusion: Whilst the majority of GIST’s have a benign clini-
cal course, metastasis can occur in 25%. Risk stratification based 
on clinical and pathological parameters and genetic testing deter-
mines subsequent management. This case highlights the impor-
tance of awareness of GIST occurring in the appendix. This is a 
rare entity and the histopathologist plays in crucial role diagnosis 
and management.

Background & objectives: Micropapillary features in a colorectal 
carcinoma are associated with a poor prognosis because of the aggres-
siveness of this variant. They present at a higher stage, with increased 
incidence of lymphovascular invasion and lymph node metastases.
Methods: We present the case of a 64-year-old male known from 
2020 with a sessile polyp located at the cecum-ascending junction, 
a recto-sigmoidal well differentiated adenocarcinoma (pT2N0) irra-
diated followed by surgery and a frontal left sided meningioma. 
This year’s biopsy was reported as tubulo-villous adenoma with 
high-grade dysplasia and he presented in our clinic for the surgi-
cal treatment.
Results: On gross examination there was a 4 cm flat lesion, occupying 
three quarters of the colon’s circumference. On microscopy the tumour 
had features of a flat traditional serrated adenoma, with more than 50% 
showing ectopic crypt formation and typical cellular features with abun-
dant eosinophilic cytoplasm and penicillate, centrally located nuclei. 
There were multiple foci of invasive carcinoma involving the upper 
submucosa, showing mostly micropapillary architecture - small clusters 
of cells delineated by stromal retraction. The cells showed marked pleo-
morphism, abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent and multiple 
nucleoli. There was a marked neutrophil rich inflammation, including 
intra-tumoral micro-abscesses. We identified vascular and perineural 
invasion, without lymph node metastases.
Conclusion: This case was signed out as flat TSA with multi-
ple foci of micropapillary adenocarcinoma(pT1pN0). This is an 
interesting case because of the clinical course of the patient and 
the unusual morphology of this carcinoma.
This carcinoma was this patient’s third tumour, that we know 
of, and the association with a meningioma and a serrated lesion 
is rare and could be syndromic. More tests need to be done in 
order to find the correlation between these entities if there is one.

Osseous metaplasia in colon cancer: a case report and lit-
erature review
A. Toma*, E. Tianu, O. Stefan, F. Obrocea
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Osseous metaplasia is defined as hetero-
topic bone formation. It is exceedingly rare in colorectal cancer, with 
an incidence of 0.15% (33 cases reported since 1992). We present a 
case of osseous metaplasia in colonic adenocarcinoma and review the 
relevant literature.
Methods: A 70-year-old male without any specific peculiar 
history presented with complaints of abdominal pain and con-
stipation. The laboratory results revealed anaemia and elevated 
inflammatory markers. A computed tomography showed focal 
asymmetric and irregular thickening of the transverse colon 
along with regional adenopathy. The patient underwent an 
extended right hemicolectomy.
Results: A fungating firm tan-brown tumour measuring 3.5 cm 
in the direction of maximum dimension with serosal invasion was 
identified on gross examination. Microscopic features were that of a 
gland-forming tumour with focal cribriform architecture and central 
necrosis. The tumour stroma contained scattered trabecular bone 
lamellae of variable size outlined by osteoblasts and osteoclasts with-
out pleomorphic stromal cells or atypia. Calcifications, bone marrow 
or cartilage formation were not observed. Mismatch repair protein 
expression was normal. The tumour was diagnosed as stage IIIB 
(T4a, N1b, M0) colon carcinoma. Six months after the operation, 
the patient was still alive and free of local recurrence.
Conclusion: Although colorectal cancer is one of the most 
common cancers, the finding of intratumoural osseous 
metaplasia is rare. It is important to recognize it in order to avoid 
misdiagnosis, as it may resemble soft tissue neoplasms or bone 
invasion. Although there is insufficient data, it seems to have no 
clinical or prognostic significance. Further research is needed to 
elucidate the mechanisms involved.

Volume of resected tumour as indicator of colorectal cancer 
dynamics
A. Filin*, V. Danilenko, E. Chupandina
*Voronezh State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: Despite the improvement of early diag-
nostic methods, late–stage colorectal cancer is diagnosed in more than 
25% of patients. Thus, the problem of detecting early stages and detect-
ability of colorectal cancer as a whole remains unresolved.
Methods: Data from 527 patients suffering from colorectal can-
cer who underwent primary tumour resection. Based on the data 
obtained from the description of the removed intestinal fragments, 
the volume of the tumour was calculated. The dynamics of changes 
in tumour volume in patients suffering from colon cancer was stud-
ied taking into account the age groups of patients.
Results: In the studied material, the tumour volumes varied sig-
nificantly: from 0,1 cm3 to 1650 cm3 (average volume 37,3 cm3). 
In all the studied age periods, the incidence of tumours of differ-
ent volumes was similar. The largest and smallest neoplasms are 
less common, in 3,5% and 4,6% of cases, respectively. It can be 
assumed that tumours with a small volume are not often found due 
to rapid progression, and after reaching a certain volume (16-32 
cm3, the diameter of such foci varies between 2.5-3.5 cm), their 
growth is significantly inhibited and only in a few cases tumours 
grow to gigantic sizes.
Conclusion: The change in tumour volume in colorectal cancer 
occurs non-linearly, explosively. Tumours with a small volume are 
rare in patients in different age groups. This may be due to their 
rapid tumour growth. Such an active progression of tumours may 
explain the low rates of tumour detection in the early stages.

Multiple peritoneal calcifying fibrous tumour: a case report
S. Makni*, S. Ben Tekaya, M. Mellouli, M. Triki, I. Saguem, S. 
Charfi, T. Boudawara, M. Manai
*Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Calcifying fibrous tumour (CFT) is a 
rare benign mesenchymal tumour. The majority are solitary lesions, 
cases of multifocal tumours are extremely rare. We report a case of 
multifocal peritoneal CFT in order to discuss histopathologic features 
and differential diagnosis.
Methods: A 25-year-old woman, presented with multiple peri-
toneal nodules and a left ovarian mass. Left oophorectomy with 
excisional biopsy of two nodules were performed, in front of a radi-
ological suspicion of malignant ovarian tumour with peritoneal car-
cinosis. Macroscopically, the gross nodule was well-circumscribed, 
measuring 5x4,5x4,5 cm. The surface cuts were gray-white fas-
ciculated. The left ovariectomy contains two haemorrhagic cysts.
Results: Histopathologically, the nodules consisted of well cir-
cumscribed, unencapsulated, abundant paucicellular, hyalinized 
collagenous tissue. That contain bland spindle cells with a sparse 
lymphoplasmatic infiltrate and lymphoid aggregates. There was 
neither cellular atypia nor mitotic figure. Multiple foci of calcifica-
tion were scattered throughout the lesions. Immunohistochemical 
staining showed a positivity with CD34 while AML, H-Caldesmon, 
S226

CD117, Dog1, ALK-1, Desmin and Inhibin-alpha were negative. 
The lesion was diagnosed as calcifying fibrous tumour. The ovarian 
cysts were yellow body haemorrhagic cysts and follicular cysts.
Conclusion: The CFT is a rare tumour with a distinctive histologi-
cal presentation. That usually occurs in children and young adults. 
Several sites have been reported but predominantly in the gastro-
intestinal tract. Usually presented as a solitary lesion, however, 
multifocal tumours have been observed in up to 10% of cases, in 
some studies. The diagnosis is based on histology, because clinical 
and radiological features are nonspecific. Awareness of this entity 
is crucial to distinguish it from peritoneal carcinosis and other 
mesenchymal tumours.

An unexpected Lynch Syndrome patient, Muir torre variant
R. D’Amato Pascarella*, M. Cerati, A.M. Chiaravalli, I. Carnevali, 
F. Sessa
*University Hospital of Insubria, Varese, Italy
Background & objectives: As immunotherapy is now FDA approved 
as first-line setting in metastatic or unresectable mismatch repair 
(MMR) defective gastrointestinal tumours it has become even more 
crucial to identify them.
Methods: A peculiar case of a 52 years-old male with an important 
weight loss, jaundice with hyperbilirubinemia and increased of the 
other hepatic markers. No apparently relevant past medical history 
was reported. He underwent routine blood tests, tumoral markers 
and further investigation through imaging revealed dilatation of 
the intrahepatic biliary ducts and a polypoid mass of the papilla.
Results: Microscopically after formalin-fixation, paraffin-
embedding, hematoxylin-eosin fixation and immunohistochemical 
stain the diagnosis of ampullary adenocarcinoma was made.
Taking into account the young patient age his medical history was 
further investigated and were taken aback by what we discovered.
Ten years before he was diagnosed with a sebaceous adenoma with 
the loss of MSH2/MSH6 MMR proteins. With this new information 
we tested the ampullary tumour for MMR protein expression and 
the result was the same; also, his family history was significant. 
NGS molecular analysis of MSH2, MSH6 and EPCAM genes dis-
covered a pathogenic variant of MSH2 gene. Considering all the 
data the patient was labelled as LS, Muir-Torre variant.
Conclusion: This is a remarkable example of how important is not 
only to make the correct diagnosis but also to always evaluate the 
medical and familiar history of patients which is crucial to identify 
LS or MMR defective patients but also to give them the best pos-
sible therapeutic opportunity since the advent of tissue-agnostic 
anti-cancer drugs.

Morphogenetic role of mast cells in colorectal cancer
A. Filin*, E. Chupandina, V. Shishkina, A. Goryacheva
*Voronezh State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: Mast cells are found in various tumours 
and one of the main cells of the tumour microenvironment with differ-
ent effects. However, the assessment of the role of mast cells in tumour 
morphogenesis does not always give an unambiguous result
Methods: 46 patients with diagnosed colorectal cancer and 
detected mast cells by immunohistochemical method, on paraffin 
sections using monoclonal mouse antibodies to Tryptase and Chy-
mase. Mast cells ware quantified in the tumour and at the invasive 
margin of the tumour. The degree of mast cell degranulation was 
also determined.
Results: The mast cells are widely represented in the tumour 
microenvironment, but predominate in the invasive margin of the 
tumour rather than in its centre. At the same time, the functional 
activity of mast cells was distributed in the opposite way. Mast cells 
with the greatest degranulation were just observed in the tumour 
itself. And in the invasive region, mast cells were functionally 
less active or inactive, despite the quantitative advantage. 
Quantitative assessment of mast cells revealed no correlation with 
life expectancy, the presence of regional metastases. There is a 
decrease in the amount of cells with a decrease in the degree of 
differentiation of the tumour (in the invasive region).
Conclusion: Mast cells are widely represented in the tumour 
microenvironment in colorectal cancer. There is a significant 
advantage in their number in the invasive edge of the tumour. But 
it is impossible not to take into account their functionality. The 
decrease in the number of mast cells in the tumour tissue may be 
due to their increased activity in this area, and not to their exclu-
sion from the morphogenetic process.

Visceral leishmaniasis presented as colitis in a patient with 
multiple myeloma
A. Sykaras*, C. Kouvidou
*Department of Pathology, Evangelismos General Hospital, Ath-
ens, Greece
Background & objectives: Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a poten-
tially fatal parasitic disease and the most severe form of Leishmaniasis 
caused by protozoa of the species Leishmania. VL usually affects the 
bone marrow, the liver and the spleen of immunocompromised patients.
Methods: A 67-year-old man was admitted with persistent bloody 
diarrhea. The patient was immunosuppressed with a medical his-
tory of renal transplantation and multiple myeloma under treat-
ment. Colonoscopy findings included erythema, oedema, ero-
sions-ulcers and pseudopolyps distributed in a continuous fashion 
suggesting inflammation of the entire colon. Multiple biopsies 
were taken from all colon segments.
Results: Histological examination of large intestinal mucosa was 
compatible with the endoscopic findings of colitis revealing a 
mild crypt architectural distortion, mucosal surface erosions and 
a moderate to severe neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammatory 
infiltration of the lamina propria. Moreover, a striking finding in 
all biopsy samples was the presence of numerous macrophages 
(some of them enlarged) in the lamina propria, containing abun-
dant and dense intracytoplasmic microorganisms. Their morphol-
ogy (round to oval, uniform and hematoxylinophilic) was strongly 
suggestive of Leishmania amastigotes. Giemsa histochemical 
stain also highlighted the morphology of Leishmania parasites. 
The diagnosis of Leishmania infection was confirmed by sero-
logical tests and the patient responded well to the treatment with 
amphotericin B.
Conclusion: The involvement of the gastrointestinal tract is unu-
sual in Leishmaniasis and is considered as an atypical feature of 
VL. Intestinal VL affects mainly the duodenum whereas colonic 
VL is extremely rare and has been reported predominantly in 
immunosuppressed patients. Colonic VL may present macroscopi-
cally as colitis but usually the musosa appears normal and the 
diagnosis is based on the histological findings. Pathologists should 
be aware of the presence of Leishmania parasites in colon biopsies 
from immunocompromised patients with diarrhea.

Mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasm of the 
ampulla of Vater: a case report
I. Saguem*, M. Manai, M. Mellouli, S. Ben Tekaya, S. Graja, A. 
Trigui, T. Boudawara, R. Kallel
*Department of Pathology, Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Sfax, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine 
neoplasm (MiNEN) of the ampulla is extremely rare, with only 20 cases 
reported in the literature. The aim of this observation is to report a case of 
MiNEN in the ampulla and study its clinicopathological features.
Methods: A 62-year-old woman presented with jaundice. The CT 
scan and MRI revealed an ampullary mass with a highly vascular-
ised pattern, and dilatation of both the common bile duct and the 
main pancreatic duct. Endoscopic ultrasound found a solid tumour 
at the ampulla, infiltrating the duodenal muscle layer. A biopsy 
was performed and concluded to ampullary adenocarcinoma. The 
patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy.
Results: The surgical specimen showed a tumour measuring 20×18 
mm on the ampulla. Histologically, this tumour was composed of two 
different components: the first component consisted of a well-differ-
entiated adenocarcinoma (50% of the tumour). The second component 
was formed by intermediate-to-large-sized neoplastic cells showing 
solid-nest growth. These cells presented a high degree of cytologic 
atypia with prominent nucleoli. The mitotic rate was evaluated at 
12/10HPF. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the lat-
ter component was positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin-A. 
The cells had a Ki-67 index higher than 20%. This component was 
diagnosed as large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. The diagnosis of 
MiNEN of the ampulla was retained.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of MiNEN constitutes a real challenge, 
because of the absence of typical clinical symptoms or imaging 
findings. Histologically, the presence of two components with 
neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine features is needed. 
Thorough sampling of the specimen is necessary for detection of 
these two components. The confirmation of the diagnosis is based 
on immunohistochemical staining. The main treatment is radical 
surgical resection. Further research are mandatory to establish the 
best method of diagnosis and treatment of these tumours.

T. Torigoe, J. Ichikawa, C. Muramatsu, S. Kanno, T. Kawasaki
*Saitama Medical University, Japan
Background & objectives: The patient, a 59-year-old Japanese 
woman, presented with a palpable mass in the upper, inner portion of 
the right breast. Ultrasound-guided, core needle biopsy of the breast 
lesion was performed, yielding a histological diagnosis of invasive 
mammary cancer.
Methods: Computed tomography (CT), to search for metastases, 
incidentally revealed an ileocecal mass. Endoscopy of the lower 
intestinal tract detected an extramural mass, and the subsequent 
biopsy result was negative for neoplasm. The patient underwent 
laparoscopic ileocecal resection and total right mastectomy. A lob-
ulated gray-whitish, cecal tumour, measuring 58x45x35 mm, was 
identified from the muscularis propria to the subserosal membrane.
Results: Histopathologically, spindle cell sarcoma with nuclear 
polymorphism as well as mitotic activity showed distinct 
eosinophilic myofilaments in the cytoplasm. Immunohistochemi-
cally, cancer cells were diffusely positive for desmin, α-SMA, and 
h-caldesmon. These findings were considered to indicate leiomyo-
sarcoma. In addition, the right breast cancer corresponded to a 
primary neuroendocrine neoplasm. A right adrenal tumour was 
detected by CT performed to assess a right ureteral stone 55 months 
after the operation. The morphological findings were similar to 
those of the cecal tumour, accompanied by strong α-SMA and 
h-caldesmon immuno-expressions. Both lesions were positive for 
MDM2, CDK4 and S-100, and showed amplification of the MDM2 
gene on FISH analysis.
Conclusion: Based on these pathological features, we made the 
final diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma with the leiomyo-
sarcoma phenotype. Within the searchable range, we identified 
no well-differentiated components. Retrospectively, our present 
cecal tumour might have originated from the subserosal layer or 
the peritoneum, and then progressed to involve the muscularis pro-
pria. In conclusion, from the therapeutic perspective, it is worth 
considering the possibility of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated 
liposarcoma in retroperitoneal and intraperitoneal mesenchymal 
neoplasms even when the histology is not typical.

Glomangioma of stomach mimicking GIST: case report
T. Pasupati Meenakshi*, B. Karikalan
*Gribbles Pathology M Sdn Bhd, Malaysia
Background & objectives: Glomangioma of stomach is an extremely 
rare entity and can clinically present with gastrointestinal bleeding. A 
case of glomangioma of distal stomach with haematemesis, clinically 
suspected as a GIST tumour of stomach is documented.
Methods: A 58-year-old female presented with haematemesis. 
CT scan revealed a distal stomach mass with features suspicious 
of GIST. A partial gastrectomy performed showed a submucosal 
tumour in the distal stomach, measuring 31x22x26mm. The lesion 
was soft, fleshy and lobulated. Rest of the stomach was unremark-
able. Routine H&E and IHC studies were carried out to document 
the nature of the tumour.
Results: H&E sections showed a well delineated submucosal 
tumourous lesion exhibiting uniform, diffuse distribution of monot-
onous appearing cells with relatively scanty cytoplasm and dense 
nuclei, without any atypia. Tumour cells were arranged in small 
and large groups and nests, surrounding small and a few ectatic 
blood vessels, with scant intervening oedematous stroma. The 
tumour was infiltrating into the upper third of muscularis propria.
IHC studies showed a strong expression for SMA, CD34 with total 
lack of expression for CD117, Chromogranin, Synaptophysin and 
pan CK. Ki 67 showed a very low proliferative index of 2%. Mor-
phological features and further IHC studies confirmed a benign 
glomus tumour(glomangioma) of distal stomach.
Conclusion: Glomangioma of stomach can mimic GIST or 
neuroendocrine tumour and present with GI bleeding. An entity 
of submucosal lesion of stomach should include the rare entity 
of glomangioma in the differential diagnosis and IHC studies are 
warranted in such cases for further accuracy, and documentation. 
The benign or malignant nature of the glomangioma aids in further 
management of the case.

pathology laboratory, Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Villejuif, 
France / Paris-Saclay university, Gustave Roussy Cancer Centre, 
Inserm US23, CNRS UMS3655, AMMICa, Villejuif, France, 
France
Background & objectives: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) of the 
anal canal is rare. This type of tumour was first described in 1954, and 
a total of 58 cases have been reported. We herein report another case 
and emphasize on the immunohistochemical and molecular features.
Methods: A 68-year-old woman reported defecation 
difficulties and self-discovery of an intra-anal swelling. 
Rectal ultrasound endoscopy revealed an hypo-echoic lesion 
of the anorectal junction measuring 17 mm in thickness with 
infiltration of the vaginal wall. The lesion involved the upper 
part of the anal canal and the internal sphincter. The patient 
had chemo-radiotherapy and an abdomino-perineal amputation 
was performed.
Results: Microscopic examination revealed an infiltrative tumour 
composed of squamoid, mucin-producing, and intermediate-
type cells, with a solid growth pattern. Tumour cells had large 
nucleoli with high grade atypia. There were no necrosis. Mucin 
was objectified by PAS, mucicarmin and Alcian blue stains. On 
immunohistochemistry, tumour cells expressed p63, p40, CK5/6, 
CK7 and p16. There was no expression of CK20, CDX2 and 
SATB2. In situ hybridization revealed the presence of high risk 
Human papillomavirus (HPV) RNA. The patient had adjuvant 
chemotherapy and relapsed after 6 months of surgery.
Conclusion: Anal MEC is extremely rare and is characterized by the 
same phenotypical features aas MEC of other sites. This case report 
emphasizes the role of HPV in the oncogenesis of MEC. The prognosis 
remains poor despite the progress in the treatment of anal cancer.

eases (IBD) and microscopic colitis (MC) as a prognostic factor 
and a possible therapeutic target

*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Extracellular matrix remodelling through 
changes in the activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinases 
has known implications in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel 
disorders. We aim to review the correlation between MMP9 expression 
and disease severity in IBD and MC.
Methods: This retrospective study included 20 cases out of 
which 6 with Crohn’s disease, 4 with ulcerative colitis, 8 with 
collagenous colitis and 2 with lymphocytic colitis. The MMP9 
marker expression was evaluated based on positive lymphocytes 
from the inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria and the 
intraepithelial compartment using a four-tiered system: 0-none, 
1-weak, 2- moderate and 3-strong positivity.
Results: Out of the 10 cases with IBD, 33% had severe active disease with a 
mean positivity of 2,66 in the lamina propria and 2,33 in the intraepithelial 
lymphocytes and 25% had moderate active disease, the mean score being 
2 in the subepithelial compartment and 1,5 in the glandular and surface 
epithelium. The rest of 42% had minimally active or inactive disease with 
a mean expression of 1,25 in lamina propria and 1,6 in the epithelium. 
Concerning the MC, the mean scores for the inflammatory infiltrate in 
lamina propria were 1,125 as opposed to 1,5 in the columnar epithelium in 
collagenous colitis and 1,5 versus 2,5 in patients with lymphocytic colitis.
Conclusion: Etiology and pathological sequences in inflammatory 
bowel disorders are not fully understood, thus, emerging studies 
focus on different approaches as to predict the evolution and unveal 
personalized therapies. Stronger MMP9 expression in patients with 
IBD compared to MC, along with greater scores within higher 
severity cases than minimal or inactive stages of disease, strongly 
support the therapeutic potential of this marker and the use of its 
inhibitors for impeding aggravation or progression to adenocarci-
noma, as suggested by other recent research.

Cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum: a case report of an 
unusual tumour and litterature review
O. Mnif*, R. Ayadi, E. Braham, M. Mlika, A. Rais, A. Ayadi, O. 
Ismail, F. El Mezni
*Abderrahmen Mami Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum 
is an uncommon, benign abdominal tumour. There have been fewer 
than 130 cases reported in the literature today. The diagnosis of this 
pathology is difficult and based on histological findings. We present a 
new case of this entity.
Methods: We report the case of a 54-year-old women presented 
with abdominal pain and constipation. Abdominal examination was 
marked by diffuse abdominal distension, and tenderness. Computed 
tomography showed a large spherical multi-loculated cystic mass 
in the abdomen. Laparotomy was done. The mass and some of the 
free-floating cysts were carefully harvested. Benign cystic meso-
thelioma was revealed in the pathology report.
Results: 12 years later, she was operated on for gallbladder 
lithiasis. Intraoperative examination showed a cystic mass in the 
peritoneum. There was a significant peritoneal thickening, and a 
peritoneal effusion, with many cystic lesions that makes dissec-
tion and resection very difficult. Gross examination showed Cysts 
filled with serous fluid and mesured 2,5x0, 5 cm. Microscopic 
examination revealed a numerous small cysts lined by a single 
layer of bland, flat to cuboidal cells. This cysts were separated by 
scant loose to collagenous stromal septa. No infiltrative invasion of 
underlying tissues. Chronic inflammation and haemorrhage com-
mon. Immunohistochemistry stain showed that the tumour cells 
were positive for calretinin and WT1.
Conclusion: Establishing a diagnosis of cystic mesothelioma of the 
peritoneum is a challenging task, given rarity of the disease and 
the small number of reported cases in the literature. This tumour 
is known for local recurrence. It’s agreed that surgery is the only 
effective treatment.

Methods: A 44-year-old male presented with a 10-month history 
of weight loss, epigastric pain, inability to eat and vomiting. In 
endoscopic examination, an ulcerated mass lesion of 7-8 cm in 
diameter in the antrum was detected. The endoscopic biopsy was 
reported as adenocarcinoma and total gastrectomy was performed.
Results: In the gastrectomy specimen, an ulcerated tumour (Bor-
rmann Type III) measuring 8x6.5x1.7 cm was observed in the 
antrum on the lesser curvature. Histologically, the tumour was 
composed of differentiated areas with glandular structures and 
poorly differentiated areas consisting of individually infiltrating 
malignant cells. The cells in both components have abundant cyto-
plasm containing eosinophilic coarse granules and centrally located 
nuclei. The cytoplasm of tumour cells was strongly immunoreac-
tive for lysozyme and showed dPAS positivity. The findings were 
compatible with Paneth cell carcinoma. The tumour was staged as 
pT4aN3a with metastasis in 11 lymph nodes. The patient did not 
receive adjuvant treatment and has been living disease-free for 10 
months.
Conclusion: Although rare, Paneth cell carcinoma has unique 
histopathological features. One should be aware of this rare gas-
trointestinal adenocarcinoma subtype to diagnose. Because of its 
rarity, its pathogenesis and prognostic features are still needed to 
be established by larger series.

A rare case of synchronous gastrointestinal stromal tumour 
and primary peritoneal mesothelioma - coincidental or not?
E. Ignat*, A. Cioroianu, L. Sticlaru, M. Cioplea, D. Raduta, M. 
Filip, S. Zurac
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) 
represents the most common mesenchymal neoplasm of the digestive 
system and is frequently diagnosed with other types of primary malig-
nancies. Nonetheless, primary peritoneal mesothelioma (PPM) occurs 
rarely even individually, thus a synchronism with GIST is exceptional.
Methods: We present the case of a 78-year-old female patient with-
out relevant medical or occupational history, who presented to our 
clinic with complaints of diffuse abdominal pain and weight loss. 
After careful clinical and imagistic examination, the suspicion of 
GIST with diffuse peritoneal metastasis was raised. Patient under-
went surgery where the gastric growth and a fragment of peritoneal 
tumour were excised.
Results: By means of histopatologic and immunohistochemistry 
analysis, we confirmed the diagnosis of gastric GIST that 
developed strong positivity for CD34, c-kit and DOG1 and was 
classified within the second prognostic group (with a 1.9% chance 
of progressive disease). The peritoneal growth surprised us from 
the beginning, as it did not share any morphological features with 
the gastric counterpart. The histology revealed a proliferation 
composed of epithelioid and spindle cells suggesting a carcinoma 
with sarcomatoid differentiation. The tumour tested positive 
for calretinin, WT1, caldesmon, CK 5/6, CK 7 and podoplanin, 
which was consistent with the diagnosis of biphasic peritoneal 
mesothelioma.
Conclusion: Primary peritoneal mesothelioma, although 
infrequent, is a diagnosis that must be acknowledged, because it 
has a different therapeutic management as compared to peritoneal 
metastasis. There are very few cases in literature that report 
similar associations between GIST and mesothelioma, one of 
them actually suggesting VEGF as a possible factor linking these 
divergent malignancies. Standardized research on other molecular 
interactions between co-existing tumours could change our whole 
approach on this matter.

tumours
Z. Bayramoglu, S. Yilmaz Erozbek*, E. Kuzucular, F. Özden
*Istanbul Medipol University, Pathology Department, Turkey
Background & objectives: Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) 
are rare tumours that account for less than 0.2% of all gastrointestinal 
system tumours. We aimed to investigate the histopathological and 
clinicopathological features and survival of GIST cases in our archive 
of the last 6 years.
Methods: Demographic, histopathological and clinicopathological 
data of cases diagnosed with primary GIST in Istanbul Medipol 
University Faculty of Medicine Department of Pathology between 
2016-2022 were evaluated retrospectively.
Results: Seventy eight primary GIST cases were evaluated. Forty 
two (53.8%) of the cases were male and 36 (46.1%) were female. 
The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 59 (range: 33-91). Fifty 
of the tumour cases (64.1%) were located in the stomach. The mean 
number of mitosis was 7.1 in 50 high magnification fields, 48 cases 
with ≤5 and 30 cases with >5 were detected. The mean Ki-67 
proliferation index was 6.4%. Liver metastasis was detected in 7 
of the cases with primary diagnosis, and lymph node metastasis 
was detected in 2 of them.
Conclusion: Standardization of histopathological reporting is of 
great importance for risk assessment in GIST cases.

Evaluation of mismatch repair status in colorectal carcinoma
S. Yilmaz Erozbek*, Z. Bayramoglu, E. Kuzucular, F. Özden
*Istanbul Medipol University, Pathology Department, Turkey
Background & objectives: Colorectal carcinomas are among the most 
common malignancies in terms of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 
This study aims to analyse the mismatch repair (MMR) status and 
histomorphological features of cases with colorectal carcinoma.
Methods: Patients with a histological diagnosis of colorectal carci-
noma in our hospital in the last 6 years were included in the study. 
Immunohistochemical techniques for the expression of MMR pro-
teins (MLH-1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS-2) were performed. MMR 
status and histomorphological features of the cases were analysed.
Results: Nuclear expression was observed in DNA mismatch 
proteins in 167 (89.7%) of the cases, while nuclear expression was 
lost in 19 (10.2%) cases. In the mismatch deficient group, 12 cases 
showed nuclear loss of MLH-1 and PMS-2, 5 cases showed nuclear 
loss of MSH-2 and MSH-6, and 2 cases showed nuclear loss of 
PMS-2. It was observed that the right colon involvement was 
prominent, including 15 of the 19 cases in the mismatch deficient 
group, right colon, 3 left colons, and 1 transverse colon tumour, 
but cases with left colon involvement were also seen.
Conclusion: It is known that mismatch deficient tumours are 
associated with a better prognosis. We think that the routine 
application of mismatch deficient immunohistochemical 
examination to all colorectal carcinoma cases may be important 
in terms of clinical guidance for cases without clinical and 
histomorphological features.

*Kharkiv National Medical University, Ukraine
Background & objectives: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) 
takes one of the leading positions in internal organs` pathology with 
comorbidity. Objective of our work was evaluation of morphometric 
parameters of the esophageal mucous membrane in young people with 
GERD and autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT).
Methods: Patients with GERD and AIT (main group) and 45 peo-
ple with isolated GERD (comparison group) matched for age, gen-
der, and social status were examined. The mean age in the groups 
was 21.9 ± 2.7 and 21.2 ± 2.4 years. Morphometric parameters 
were obtained (total thickness of the epithelium, basal layer thick-
ness, the height of connective tissue papillae, and intercellular 
space).
Results: The histological study showed that in patients with GERD 
and AIT all the morphometric parameters studied had a signifi-
cantly more severe course and exceeded similar indicators of the 
group with isolated GERD: epithelium total thickness 319.3±9.1 
μm against 286.1±8.2 μm (p<0.01), epithelium basal layer thick-
ness 79.6±3.2 μm versus 49.7±2.1 μm (p<0.01), connective tis-
sue papillae height 224.8±7.3 μm against 172.7±4.6 μm (p<0.01), 
intercellular space 1.55±0.11 μm versus 1.12±0.09 μm (p<0.01). 
Considerable aggravation of the deviations in patients with AIT 
may reflect the involvement of an additional autoimmune inflam-
matory component in the pathological process.
Conclusion: GERD and euthyroid AIT comorbidity in the stu-
dent population is accompanied by statistically more pronounced 
disorganization of esophageal mucosal epithelium compared with 
isolated GERD. The obtained data allow us to consider concomi-
tant AIT as an unfavorable prognostic factor in the progression of 
GERD in the student population.

tory LR21SP01, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The implemented measures during the 
COVID-19 pandemic disrupted health care access, especially in low 
income countries. We aimed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic on management and presentation of colorectal cancer (CRC) 
in a Tunisian population.
Methods: We selected two groups of patients with newly diag-
nosed and treated CRC in Salah Azaiez institute, in the pandemic 
era (1 March 2020-1 December 2021) and in a corresponding 
time interval of the prepandemic era (1 March 2020-1 May 
2018). Clinicopathological data were retrieved from pathologi-
cal reports and compared between the two groups.
Results: The number of newly diagnosed CRCs was lower in the pandemic 
era (49 cases versus 82 cases). These patients presented at a significantly 
(p<0.01) younger age and with a greater tumour size (median age of 58 versus 
62 and tumour size of 40 mm versus 30 mm). Among patients prescribed 
neoadjuvant treatment, 78% accessed it in the pandemic interval versus 70% 
in the second group. Lymph node involvement was significantly higher in 
patients of the prepandemic interval (51% versus 30%, p=0.02). There was 
no difference in T stage presentation (p=0.2), lymphovascular invasion rates 
(p=0.3) and tumour regression rates (p=0.1) between the two cohortes.
Conclusion: Although the demographic characteristics of patients 
with CRC diagnosed in the pandemic era were worse, there was no 
difference in histopronostic factors and health care access. With 
limited resources, tunisian health care system seemed to resist 
COVID-19’s pandemic impacts.

Tumour budding: a strong and reproductible prognostic 
marker in stage II colorectal carcinoma

Hamchi, O. Belkacem, M. Mokni, S. Hmissa
*Pathology Department, Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: StageII colorectal carcinoma is a heterogene-
ous group with a 5-year survival ranging from 32,3% to 66,5%. Recently, 
tumour budding (TB) has been recognized as a strong prognostic factor to 
select a subset of patients who may benefit from adjuvant therapy
Methods: 172 stage II colorectal carcinoma (CRC) patients with 
known outcome have been identified between 2007 and 2014. TB 
was defined as single tumour cells or clusters of <5 cells at the 
invasive tumour front. It was assessed by two different patholo-
gists using the hot spot method. A score using a 3-tier system and 
a grade were finally attributed.
Results: 47 (27,4%) carcinomas had high and 125 (72,6%) had low 
budding scores. High grade budding was associated with an infiltrative 
growth pattern (p<0,001), lymphovascular invasion (p=0,011), neural 
invasion (0,002) and intratumoural lymphocyte infiltrate (p=0,003). 
Five-year cancer-specific survival was significantly poorer in high com-
pared with low budding groups: 68% versus 80% (P=0.023). Multi-
variate analysis demonstrated tumour budding to be an independent 
prognostic factor (hazard ratio=2,33, P=0.012). Interobserver agree-
ment was moderate for both score and grade: 74,4% agreement (k=0.4) 
versus 66,9% agreement (k=0.23), respectively.
Conclusion: In view of these findings, the use of TB as a repro-
ductible and independent prognostic marker, easily assessed on 
hematoxylin and eosin slides, to identify a subset stage II CRC 
patients at high risk of recurrence and who may benefit from adju-
vant therapy, had been advocated.

A retrospective study investigating how common serrated 
adenocarcinomas are and whether it is possible to identify from 
morphology and immunohistochemistry
A. Arnaout*, A. Andrade
*St Georges Hospital London, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Sessile serrated adenocarcinoma is a chal-
lenging subtype that is rarely used in pathology reports. In previous 
studies the CK7+/CK20+ pattern of expression is displayed in ser-
rated adenocarcinomas. In this project we tested such an expression 
retrospectively.
Methods: Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) analysis on 100 cases 
of primary CRC samples identified serrated morphology on 37% 
of cases. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining using CK7 (clone: 
SP52; pre-diluted; ROCHE Diagnostics, Switzerland) and CK20 
(clone: SP33; pre-diluted; ROCHE Diagnostics, Switzerland) 
antibodies was carried out via Ventana automatic Immunostainer 
(BenchMark Ultra IHC/ ISH System).
Results: CK7+/CK20+ pattern of expression was present in 21% 
of cases. 11% of CRC cases studied displayed general CK7+/
CK20+ expression, as well as that same pattern in both serra-
tion and tumour components specifically. This evidence supports 
Hirano, et al., 2019 findings in which it is considered that the

serrated carcinoma pathway is estimated to account approximately 
for 10–30% of all CRCs.
Conclusion: Establishing the fact that serrated adenocarcinomas 
can be distinguished from traditional CRCs, we propose that 
CK7 and CK20 IHC analysis alongside adequate sampling of the 
tumour & adjacent non-neoplastic colorectal mucosa should be 
implemented when handling specimens. Increasing awareness 
in the scientific community in the reporting of serrated lesions, 
may consequently benefit patients with their likely prognosis and 
treatment.

Neuroendocrine tumour arising from a Meckel’s diverticulum: 
a rare entity
S. Frini*, A. Baccouche, W. Majdoub, A. Bdioui, S. Mestiri, S. 
Hmissa
*Pathology Department, Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Meckel’s diverticulum (MD), a vestigial 
remnant of vitelline duct, represents the most common abnormality of 
the gastrointestinal tract. Its malignant transformation is an unusual 
event. Herein, we report a case of a neuroendocrine tumour arising in 
the setting of MD.
Methods: We report the case of a 86 years-old man, with a history 
of peptic ulcer disease, who presented with symptoms of bowel 
obstruction. Blood tests showed a biological inflammatory syn-
drome and radiological exams concluded to a complicated MD. He 
underwent a cuneiform resection of the MD with uneventful post 
operative follow-up.
Results: Histological examination revealed the presence of a 
0.8 cm well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumour invading the 
mucosa and the sub-mucosa. Tumour cells displayed an insular 
pattern and were focally arranged in rosettes. The tumour cells 
were monotonous, had an eosinophilic granular cytoplasm and 
small round nuclei with ‘salt and pepper’ chromatin. No mitotic 
figures were seen. Immunohistochemically, these cells were 
positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin A. The Ki-67 was 
expressed in less than 1% of tumour cells. Surgical margins 
were negative. The diagnosis of well-differentiated neuroen-
docrine tumour (Grade I) arising in a Meckel’s diverticulum 
was established.
Conclusion: Eventhough it’s scarce, neuroendocrine tumours 
should be taken into account when dealing with Meckel’s divr-
ticulum. Despite its small size, it is frequently associated with 
nodal and liver metastasis. An optimal surgical management and a 
close follow-up are advised.

Adenosquamous carcinoma of the colon: study of 5 cases
S. Moussa*, W. Majdoub, M. Krifa, A. Baccouche, O. Belkacem, 
S. Ben Cheikh, A. Bdioui, S. Hmissa
*Pathology department, Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) is an 
extremely rare subtype of colo-rectal cancer (CRC) with an incidence 
lower than 0.1% of all CRC. ASC shows an admixture of both 
adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. We aim to describe 
clinico-pathological aspects of ASC.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 5 cases of patients 
diagnosed in our department with ASC collected in our institution 
over a period of 20 years from 2000 to 2020.
Results: Our study included 5 males. Patient’s age ranged from 
17 to 68years with an average of 50years. One of the patients 
had family history of CRC and personal history of high-grade 
conventional adenoma. ASC were widely disbursed throughout 
the colon with primary sites including the caecum (2cases) 
and the sigmoid (2cases), followed by the rectum (1case). 
Histologically, most ASC were of low-grade (4cases) and 
presented as stage III (3cases). Stages II and IV were identified 
each in 1case. All patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. One 
patient relapsed with local and metastatic forms. Three patients 
died and two were lost at follow up. The follow up average 
duration was estimated to 6.4months.
Conclusion: The clinical features are similar to other subtypes of 
adenocarcinoma. Treatment is based on surgery since the benefit 
of chemotherapy and radiotherapy is not well established. Because 
of the rarity of this subtype and its generally aggressive nature, no 
specific prognostic features have been identified. Few series have 
been reported including a small number of patients. The overall 
prognosis is worse than adenocarcinoma NOS of the colon across 
all stages.

Ulcerated colonic lipoma mimicking a gastrointestinal stromal 
tumour in Von Recklinghausen’s disease
S. Frini*, A. Bdioui, S. Moussa, W. Majdoub, O. Belkacem, A. 
Baccouche, S. Hmissa
*Pathology Department, Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Von Recklinghausen’s Disease (VRD) 
predisposes to the development of various tumours, ranging from 
benign neurofibromas to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours. 
Among this spectrum, Colonic lipomas are extremely rare. Herein, 
we discuss clinico-pathological features of a tumour with misleading 
presentation.
Methods: A 29-year-old women with VRD presented with melena 
and symptoms of intermittent bowel obstruction. Computed 
tomography and colonoscopy were performed and suspected a 
gastrointestinal stromal tumour in the ascending colon. Con-
sidering the patient’s background and an inconclusive biopsy, 
she underwent a right colectomy with uneventful post-operative 
course.
Results: Gross examination revealed the presence, of a 4 cm well-
circumscribed exophytic mass in the caecum. The tumour was 
covered by an ulcerated mucosa. Cut section showed a homog-
enous, fatty appearance. Histologically, the tumour was composed 
of lobules of mature adipocytes with cellular fibrous septa. The 
spindle cells in the septa were negative to PS100, C-Kit, Dog 1 
and SMA stains. The remaining mucosa showed a mild chronic 
inflammation. The final diagnosis concluded to a lipoma of the 
colonic mucosa.
Conclusion: It is still unknown whether the coexistence of colonic 
lipoma with VRD was a mere coincidence or an intrinsic associa-
tion; and to our knowledge, only one case has ever reported this 
occurrence. Due to the variable expressivity of VRD and its sys-
temic manifestation, a multi-disciplinary approach should always 
be considered.

A rare case of extra genital non gestational choriocarcinoma 
of the jejunum
S. Ben Cheikh*, W. Majdoub, M. Krifa, S. Mestiri, A. Baccouche, 
S. Hmissa
*Pathology department, Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Choriocarcinoma is a highly invasive and 
metastatic neoplasm that affects young women. Non-gestational cho-
riocarcinoma is an uncommon type of choriocarcinoma that develops 
from intrauterine gestational trophoblastic cells. Only 18 cases of cho-
riocarcinoma of the small bowel have been reported.
Methods: A 34-year-old woman with gravida 2, para 2 who had 
her last delivery six years ago and had never had an abortion, was 
admitted for acute abdominal pain with melena. Gynaecological 
exam was normal. Her blood tests showed a markedly elevated 
β-hCG. Computed tomography scanning of the abdomen-pelvis 
revealed proximal jejunal bleeding. The patient underwent a 
surgical resection.
Results: The pathological examination revealed the presence, 
of a 5cm, red, haemorrhagic, round nodular masse of the 
jejunum. Microscopic examination revealed a proliferation of 
cytotrophoblasts and multinucleated syncitiotrophoblasts cells in 
an haemorrhagic background. Immunohistochemically, tumour 
cells stained positive for β-hCG.
The patient had a cataclysmic haemorrhage with haemorrhagic 
shock, which was complicated by an unrecovered cardiac arrest 
despite resuscitation attempts.
Conclusion: To date, the pathogeny of extragenital gastrointestinal 
tract choriocarcinoma is not elucidated. It is not easy to determine 
the primary or secondary nature of the tumour and this is why we 
must look for a history of genital bleeding or abortion in order to 
exclude the possibility of a molar pregnancy or a metastatic uterine 
choriocarcinoma which spontaneously disappear. Although extra-
genital choriocarcinoma in the small intestine is rare, it should be 
included in the differential diagnosis of small intestinal neoplasm.

Granular cell tumour of cecum: a case report
J.P. Skliris*, S. Papadopoulou, N. Pastelli, I. Dimitriadis, I. Mat-
zarakis, S. Papaemmanouil
*Papanikolaou General Hospital of Thessaloniki, Greece
Background & objectives: Granular cell tumours are rare soft tissue 
neoplasms arising possibly from Schwann cells and found throughout 
the human body, most commonly in skin and subcutis. We herein pre-
sent a case appearing as polypoid mass protruding inside the cecum.
Methods: During the investigation of anaemia in a 62-year old 
female patient, colonoscopy was implemented. A polypoid mass, 
measuring 1,5 cm, was found inside the cecum, excised and sent 
for histopathological examination. The rest of the colon was unre-
markable endoscopically.
Results: Microscopic examination revealed a submucosal neo-
plasm composed mainly of polygonal and in a lesser extent of spin-
dly cells organized in syncytium formations. Their nuclei displayed 
only mild atypia and anisonucleosis, while the surrounding cyto-
plasm was plump, eosinophilic and granular. No mitotic figures 
were observed. Immunohistochemistry stained the neoplastic cells 
for S-100 and CD68 markers, whereas CD117, SMA, CD34 and 
desmin were negative. Mitotic index Ki-67 was calculated 1-2%. 
Overall, the examination resulted in the diagnosis of a benign 
granular cell tumour.
Conclusion: Inferentially, our case highlights the importance of 
clinical awareness for granular cell tumours and their inclusion in 
the differential diagnosis of polypoid masses inside the cecum and 
the gastrointestinal tract in general. This is underlined by the fact 
that they possess about a 2% potential of malignant transformation.

ARID1A expression as a possible marker of gastric precancer-
ous lesions
S. Mozgovoi*, V. Rubtsov, A. Shimanskaya, E. Pomorgailo, S. 
Glatko, A. Kononov
*Omsk State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: AT-rich interactive domain-containing 
protein 1A (ARID1A) is a tumour suppressor, which functioning as 
pleiotropic gene expression inhibitor through regulation of chromatin 
conformation. ARID1A loss occur in 30% of all gastric adenocarcino-
mas, especially in MSI and EBV-associated molecular subtypes.
Methods: Gastric mucosa specimens were collected from 43 stom-
achs with gastric adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma specimens and 
gastric mucosa fragments taken distant from a border of tumour 
growth (1 cm or more, distant zone group) were observed. Immu-
nohistochemical ARID1A nuclear staining score was evaluated as 
proposed (Sakuratani T. et al., 2021). The Mann-Whitney U-test 
and Wilcoxon matched pairs test were used for comparing.
Results: Marked level of heterogeneity and variability in marker 
expression was found in the stomach cancer group. Semiquantitative 
assessment of ARID1A immunohistochemical staining demonstrated 
that ARID1A nuclear expression score in adenocarcinoma group 
was lower (median and interquartile range - 4 [2-6]) then in distant 
zone group (5 [3-6]). This difference was statistically significant (p 
= 0,0447) when applying Mann-Whitney test. However, interquartile 
range of distant zone group lies within interquartile range of adenocar-
cinoma tissue group and there was no statistically significant difference 
(p = 0,0697) between matched pairs according to Wilcoxon test.
Conclusion: Absence of difference according to Wilcoxon matched 
pairs test allows us to consider that distant zone is reflection of 
field cancerization. It can be assumed that in case of involvement 
of pathways leading to ARID1A loss in particular gastric cancer it 
takes place during early steps of gastric carcinogenesis. The study 
results indicate that ARID1A protein expression can be consid-
ered as a possible marker of risk assessment for gastric cancer and 
would be useful for early diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma.

An essential and efficient combination of immunohistochemical 
profiling for an accurate diagnosis and subclassification of 
extra mammary perianal Paget diseases
D. Vinha Pereira*, K. Jiang
*Instituto Português de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, 
Portugal
Background & objectives: Extra mammary perianal Paget disease 
(EMPPD) is clinicopathologically challenging, due to the risk of mis-
diagnosis/underdiagnosis, ambiguous origins and recurrence. Our aim 
is to identify an immunohistochemical panel that improve EMPPD 
diagnosis and subclassification (skin adnexal vs associated with vis-
ceral malignancies).
Methods: Twenty-nine EMPPD cases (biopsies) were studied; no 
prior skin or visceral malignancies were known. Histomorphology 
and a combination of ancillary tests (CK7, CK20, CDX2, GATA3, 
GCDFP15, P40, S100 and Melan-A) were reviewed/ performed.
Results: All EMPPDs were diagnosed/confirmed by immunohis-
tochemistry: CK7+ 100% (29/29); CK20+ 68.2% (15/22); CDX2+ 
S233

73.7% (14/19); GATA3+ 46.7% (7/15); GCDFP15+ 90% (9/10); P40, 
S100 and Melan-A all negative (21/21, 24/24 and 20/20). However, 5 
visceral-EMPPDs were previously misdiagnosed as skin origin when 
CDX2 was not accessed, 1 of them with invasive mixed neuroendo-
crine non-neuroendocrine neoplasm (MiNEN) component that required 
additional chemotherapy treatment. Four skin-EMPPDs were originally 
called viscerally-originated when GATA3 was not accessed. Adding 
GATA3 and CDX2 to the most used CK7/CK20 panel illustrated true 
disease origins (skin versus visceral) and impacted clinical courses. 
GCDFP15 was less sensible than CK7 to identify EMPPD. P40, S100 
and Melan-A show no diagnostic value.
Conclusion: EMPPDs have underrecognized malignant potential. 
The immunohistochemical panel CK7/CDX2/GATA3/CK20 that 
we propose refines EMPPD diagnosis by highlighting its origin(s), 
therefore providing new opportunities for patients’ stratification 
and clinical management.

A rare case of concomitant RAS and BRAF mutation in colon 
adenocarcinoma

*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário, Portugal
Background & objectives: Colorectal cancer is one of the most com-
mon cancers worldwide. RAS and BRAF are key oncogenes in the 
RAS/RAF/MAP-kinase pathway. RAS mutations are predictive of 
resistance to anti-EGFR drugs. RAS and BRAF mutations are gener-
ally recognized to be mutually exclusive.
Methods: An 87-year-old man presented to the emergency service 
with complaints of breathlessness, fatigue and anaemia. During 
the hospitalization, a colonoscopy was performed. An exophytic 
and ulcerative tumour was found in the right colon. Biopsies were 
performed and the diagnosis of a colic adenocarcinoma was made. 
The multidisciplinary tumour board decided to perform a right 
hemicolectomy.
Results: On gross examination, a tumour with 6.8x5.2cm which 
obliterated the colic lumen was described. Histologically it had a 
tubular and glandular architecture, with a mucinous component that 
represented 60% of the neoplasia. One, out of thirty one, lymph 
nodes was metastasized. Loss of MLH1 and PMS2 was detected 
by immunohistochemistry, MSH2 and MSH6 expression was 
maintained. The pathological stage was T3N1M0. The mutational 
status of the RAS and BRAF genes was studied by PCR. The 
mutation p.Gly12Ala/p.Gly12Val(G12A/V, c.35G>C / c.35G>T), 
was detected in codon 12 of the NRAS gene. In the BRAF gene 
the mutation V600E/D(c.1799T>A; c.1799_1800delinsAA/
c.1799_1800delinsAC) was detected.
Conclusion: A concomitant BRAF and RAS mutation is very 
rare, with an estimated incidence of 0.05%. As a rare event not 
much is known about the appropriate treatment and prognosis of 
these patients, which seems variable. Prospective studies in a large 
cohort are needed to fully understand the characteristics of this 
subset of patient with colon cancer.

Background & objectives: Ampullary carcinomas are a rare entity 
accounting for 0.2% of gastro-intestinal cancers. They arise from ade-
nomatous lesions presenting each a different malignant potential. The 
aim of our study was to determine the characteristics of ampullary 
lesions in our population study.
Methods: Clinical, endoscopic, radiological and pathological 
features of 47 Patients who underwent upper GI endoscopy with 
biopsies of the major papilla or surgical resections (pancreaticduo-
denectomy) over the last 20 years were collected and statistically 
analysed.
Results: Mean age was 62.65 years. Side-viewing endoscopy 
identified an irregular protrusion in lumen in most cases (27.7%). 
ERCP identified bile duct invasion in 8.5% of cases. Three 
patients had metastatic disease. Lesions were adenocarcinomas in 
74.5% of cases, adenomas in 17% of cases, among them 65.2% 
high grade. Unspecific inflammation was found in 8.5% of cases. 
Pancreaticobiliary type represented 36.3% of adenocarcinoma, 5% 
were intestinal type, 31% of mixed type adenocarcinoma, one case 
of mucinous carcinoma and one patient had an undifferentiated 
carcinoma with giant osteoclast-like cells. Tumours were well 
differentiated in 73.5% of cases. 65.5% of tumours were stages I/II.
Conclusion: Ampullary lesions are dominated by adenocarcinoma 
and most of them are stage I/II. In fact, ampullary carcinomas 
are generally symptomatic at an early disease stage, thus, 
withholding a better prognosis than other periampullary cancers. 
Early management of ampullary neoplasms can prevent malignant 
transformation.

Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency as a differential 
diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 – a case report
D. Enea*, P. Benigni, A. Sayadi, C. Groulez, M. Svrcek
*Sorbonne Université, AP-HP, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Department 
of Pathology, Paris, France
Background & objectives: Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency 
(CMMRD) syndrome is a childhood cancer predisposition syndrome 
that results from biallelic germline mutations in one of the MMR genes. 
The tumour spectrum is very broad and the benign manifestations can 
mimic neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).
Methods: A 15-year-old boy, with no recorded family medical 
history, presented with multiple café-au-lait macules, mainly local-
ized on the anterior abdominal wall, and severe iron-deficiency 
anaemia. During the hospitalisation, his condition worsened expe-
riencing gastro-intestinal symptoms with signs of intestinal intus-
susception. A priori detailed examination led to a right colectomy 
being performed.
Results: Macroscopic examination of the resected specimen 
revealed four polyps (4mm, 15mm, 30mm, and 40mm, respec-
tively). Histologically, they all represented tubular/tubulo-villous 
adenomas, out of which the three largest presented high-grade dys-
plasia; foci of carcinoma in situ/intramucosal adenocarcinoma were 
observed in the 40mm polyp. Consequently, immunohistochemical 
stains for the MMR proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) 
were performed, which demonstrated a loss of PMS2-protein in 
both tumour and non-neoplastic tissue. The technique was repeated 
yielding the same results. The patient’s young age, the NF1-like 
features and the large tubulo-villous adenomas featuring carcinoma 
in situ were consistent with CMMRD. Moreover, a NF1 germline 
mutation was not detected, and further genetic analysis is expected.
Conclusion: Despite the very low frequency of CMMRD, one 
should keep in mind the possibility of this diagnosis, as shown 
herein. Since skin café-au-lait spots are typically associated with 
NF1, a more frequent syndrome, CMMRD could be overlooked

leading to possible misdiagnosis. Careful interpretation of MMR 
proteins, notably for PMS2 in absence of positive internal controls, 
was paramount for the accurate assessment. A correct diagnosis is 
of utmost importance, given the high CMMRD mortality rate, and 
the necessity of genetic counselling.

Gastrointestinal "juvenile-like (inflammatory/hyperplastic) 
mucosal polyps" as specific gastrointestinal manifestation of 
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) – a case report
D. Enea*, X. Dray, E. Guillerm, A. Guilloux, M. Yver, P. Cervera, 
M. Svrcek
*Sorbonne Université, AP-HP, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Department 
of Pathology, Paris, France
Background & objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a com-
mon syndrome that exhibits variable phenotypic expression. Gastro-
intestinal juvenile-like (inflammatory/hyperplastic) mucosal polyps 
(JLIHMPs) have been proposed as a NF1-specific gastrointestinal (GI) 
manifestation and only a few cases were reported so far.
Methods: We report a case of a 78-year-old female featuring JLI-
HMPs in clinically/genetically proven NF1. A thoroughly exam-
ination was carried out due to an iron-deficiency anaemia. The 
colonoscopy revealed two pediculated polyps located in the right 
colon (15mm and 23mm, respectively) and one in the left colon 
(60mm). Following polypectomies, microscopic examination and 
genetic analysis were conducted.
Results: Histologically, the two right-sided polyps showed juve-
nile-like features such as superficial ulceration and granulation 
tissue, dilated/distorted crypts separated by abundant, markedly 
inflamed stroma, rich in eosinophils and mast cells. Vascular 
changes (i.e. wall thickening) were present in the polyps axes. 
Additionally, squamous metaplasia was noted. The left-sided polyp 
exhibited similar characteristics; however, unlike the other two pol-
yps, it presented foci of low-grade dysplasia. On IHC, performed 
on one of the right-sided polyps, CD117 staining showed numerous 
mast cells, stromal cells were CD34− and S100 staining did not 
show Schwann cells/neural alterations. Moreover, DNA analysis 
did not reveal any PDFRA or any specific mutations. The polyps 
characteristics were consistent with JLIHMPs.
Conclusion: Considering the poor characterisation of this entity, 
the diagnosis is non-trivial. Although usually not prominent, 
both juvenile and fibroid polyps (IFPs) features may be found in 
JLIHMPs. The lack of specific mutations sustained our diagnosis. 
As mast cells are deregulated in NF1, a heavy inflammation with 
numerous mast cells suggests a possible pathogenetic role of these 
leukocytes. Our findings add to the current knowledge on this 
particular entity as it may be recognised as specific gastrointestinal 
manifestations of NF-1.

*Department of Pathology Hospital da Luz Lisboa, Faculty of Medicine 
Universidade Católica Portuguesa, Nova Medical School, Portugal
Background & objectives: Discordant results were reported about the 
benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NChT) for patients harboring 
gastric cancer (GC) with mismatch repair protein (MMR) deficiency. 
Aim: to evaluate if MMR-status is related to survival and/or response 
to NChT in GC patients.
Methods: 116 operated GC patients with (n=46) or without 
(n=70) NChT were retrospectively selected from two institutions 
(2004-2015). Clinicopathological features were analysed. Tumour 
morphology was assessed according to WHO and Laurén clas-
sifications. Tumours were classified as MMR-proficient (MMRp) 
or deficient (MMRd) by immunohistochemistry. IBM-SPSS was 
used for statistical analysis. For survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier). 
Stage IV GC patients were excluded.
Results: 73/116 cases (62.9%) were MMRp and 43/116 (37.1%) were 
MMRd. MMRp-status was associated with poorly-cohesive (WHO) / 
diffuse (Laurén) histopathological subtype (n=26/73, 35.6%), while 
MMRd-status was associated with high-grade tubular (solid) mor-
phology (WHO) (n=12/43, 27.9%) and indeterminate Laurén subtype 
(n=24/43, 55.8%) - p=0.003 (WHO) and p<0.001 (Laurén). Overall 
survival (OS) was not related to MMR status (p=0.735). There was 
no difference in OS in patients treated with surgery alone or NChT, 
as assessed in the whole series (p=0.161) and separately in MMRp 
(p=0.381) and MMRd (p=0.251) subgroups.
Conclusion: Histopathological assessment may be important in 
the identification of MMR-status in GC. Particularly, in this series, 
high-grade tubular (solid) morphology, according to the WHO clas-
sification (Laurén: indeterminate; Japanese Gastric Cancer Asso-
ciation: por1), identified 27.9% of MMRd cases. In line with some 
studies, MMR-status was not related to OS, either in patients sub-
mitted to direct surgery or NChT. These results are relevant, since 
over 60% of Western GC patients are diagnosed at an advanced 
stage and would perform NChT.

G. Fontinha, F. Ramalhosa, V. Almeida, C. Faria, M.A. Cipriano
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário, Portugal
Background & objectives: Gastrointestinal clear cell sarcoma is a rare 
neoplasm, with neuroectodermal differentiation and associated to gene 
fusion translocation involving EWSR1. It has a poor outcome and often 
it has metastasis at presentation.
Methods: A 53-year-old woman presented to the emergency 
department with complaints of weight loss, anorexia and fatigue 
for the last three months. In the CT scan there was a suspicion of a 
jejunal mass, which was confirmed by enteroscopy. Jejunal resec-
tion was performed. During the surgery, the presence of peritoneal 
carcinomatosis was noted.
Results: On gross examination, the tumour had 4x3.5x3.5cm, with 
mural growth and lumen obliteration, with focal mucosa ulceration. 
On cut section, it was tanned, solid and lobulated. Histologically, 
it had a multinodular growth pattern and it was a predominantly 
solid neoplasm with focal areas of alveolar, glandular and papillary 
patterns, composed of uniform and clear cells.
Immunohistochemically the cells were immunoreactive for SOX10, 
synaptophysin and S100, and negative for panCK, p53, Cromogra-
nin, DOG1, MelanA, HMB45, PAX8 and MITF. Gene fusion 
involving EWSR1 was confirmed by FISH, thus giving the final 
diagnosis of a gastrointestinal clear cell sarcoma/malignant gastro-
intestinal neuroectodermal tumour
No recurrence or progression was reported after 5-months.
Conclusion: Gastrointestinal clear cell sarcoma/malignant 
gastrointestinal neuroectodermal tumour is a rare neoplasm. 
Although uncommon, it should be considered on the differential 
diagnosis for melanoma metastasis in the bowel, because of

the overlapping immunohistochemical and morphology. The

Colonic diaphragm disease as a rare cause of large bowel 
stenosis
F. Rosa*, J. Lemos Garcia, J. Maciel, F. Cabral, F. Silva Brito, I. 
Rosa, I. Claro, R. Fonseca
*Instituto Português de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Portugal
Background & objectives: The leading cause of large bowel 
obstructions in adults is a stricture secondary to malignancy. Colonic 
diaphragm disease (CDD) is a rare aetiology of stenosis, occurring 
mostly in the ascending colon of older women on long-term non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Methods: We present a classic case of CDD with radiology, endo-
scopic and pathological correlation.
Results: A 74-year-old woman with a monoclonal B lympho-
cytosis presented at an emergency department with a severe 
postprandial abdominal pain. The CT-scan showed an ascending 
colon circumferential stenosis and the colonoscopy showed an 
irregular and friable lesion, which was biopsied and consistent 
with an ulcer edge. Our multidisciplinary team proposed a right 
colectomy due to subacute intestinal obstruction symptoms. 
Examination of the specimen confirmed a single diaphragm-
like stricture, conditioning a 70% lumen stenosis, with signs of 
proximal dilatation. Microscopic examination showed a plica 
with submucosal fibrosis compatible with CDD. The patient 
had multiple NSAIDs prescriptions.
Conclusion: CDD is a rare condition associated with a common use 
drug. This case illustrates a typical case of a concentric stenotic lesion 
in the ascending colon presenting in an older woman medicated with 
NSAIDs. CDD is an important differential diagnosis of a colorectal 
neoplasm that pathologist and clinicians must be aware of.

Esophageal schwannoma: a rare case report
A. Stofas*, A. Patereli, D. Goutas, H. Gakiopoulou, P. 
Korkolopoulou
*1st Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, National and 
Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: Esophageal schwannomas are extremely 
rare, comprising ~2% of esophageal tumours and affect more frequently 
women between the 4th-6th decade of life. They are most often located 
in the proximal oesophagus. They are usually asymptomatic but some-
times can cause dysphagia.
Methods: We present a 47-year-old female who was referred for 
dysphagia with a history of an operation for diaphragmatic hernia 
and stenosis 20 years ago.
Results: Biopsies from the lower oesophagus were sent for histopatho-
logical examination and revealed a mesenchymal neoplasm composed 
of spindle-shaped cells with a fascicular pattern of growth and show-
ing palisading of the nuclei. Immunohistochemically, the cells stained 
positive for S-100 protein and SOX10 but were negative for CD117, 
CD34 and Melan A. The mitotic index was low (1%).
Conclusion: The prognosis for schwannoma is good since 
schwannoma is most often a benign tumour with a very low 
recurrence potential. Malignant transformation is exceptionally 
rare. The therapeutic management of esophageal schwannoma 
depends on several factors, such as clinical complaints, tumour 
size and pathological data (malignancy, mitotic index). Thus, most 
of the studies recommend surgical resection as treatment of choice.

Clinical and morphological approach in developing a decision 
support system for patients with autoimmune gastritis
S. Mozgovoi*, A. Gubanova, M. Stepanchenko, M. Livzan
*Omsk State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: Autoimmune gastritis associated with 
a high risk of gastric atrophy, stomach cancer and neuroendocrine 
tumours. Development of a decision support system would be helpful 
to determine the diagnosis and observation of patients for timely detec-
tion of gastric precancerous changes.
Methods: In pilot cross-sectional comparative study, 60 patients 
(30 patients with autoimmune gastritis and 30 - H.pylori-associated 
) were examined to identify informative diagnostic stimuli. General 
clinical investigation, upper endoscopy with OLGA-based staging 
of gastritis, IHC for neuroendocrine cells, antibodies to parietal 
cells and von Castle intrinsic factor, cyanocobalamin, ferritin, iron 
and folic acid levels were assessed.
Results: Pathognomonical clinical findings of autoimmune gas-
tritis patients were comorbidity with other autoimmune diseases 
(25 patients in the main group), cyanocobalamin deficiency (17 
patients) and iron deficiency (13 patients). Endoscopy findings 
identified an endoscopic atrophic grade cutoff point of O3 on the 
Kimura–Takemoto classification (area under the curve [AUC]: 
0,84). All patients in the core group were predominantly afflicted 
fundic glands and detection of extensive intestinal and/or pseu-
dopyloric metaplasia/SPEM. The most common finding was a 
combination of intestinal metaplasia I and II types (AUC:0,86). 
All patients were reported linear and/or micronodular neuroendo-
crine cell hyperplasia (AUC:0,92). Microcarcinoids was found in 
5 patients, 4 had at least 1 neuroendocrine tumour.
Conclusion: Based on the priority obtained, the initial diagnostic 
approach may be based on primary selection of a cohort of individuals 
with suspicion on autoimmune gastritis with an additional assessment 
of presence of autoantibodies to parietal cells and Castle’s factor, with 
the subsequent upper endoscopy in NBI mode and investigation of all 
the focuses of neuroendocrine hyperplasia. More research is needed to 
develop a mathematical model for medical decision support system.

Brahim, R. Jouini, A. Chadli
*Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) account 
for 2% of all gastrointestinal system malignancies and are most com-
monly observed the small bowel followed by the rectum and the appen-
dix. This study aimed to investigate the pathologic characteristics and 
prognostic factors of intestinal NETs.
Methods: It is a retrospective study collecting all cases of intestinal 
NETs over a twenty-year period between April 2002 and January 
2022 diagnosed in the pathology department of Habib Thameur 
Hospital, Tunis. All histopathological reports and clinical data 
were reviewed.
Results: There were 35 intestinal NETs. Thirty (86%) were in the 
appendix, three (9%) in the small intestine and two in the rectum 
(5%). The mean age was 40,8 years. The mean tumour size was 
10.3 mm [2-40 mm]. The tumour grade was G1 in 27 cases, G2 in 
S236
Virchows Archiv (2022) 481 (Suppl 1):S1–S364

7 cases. One rectal tumour was G3. All appendiceal NETs were 
classified pT1 or pT2 according the 2019 TNM classification. Con-
cerning ileal tumours, 2 were pT3 and one pT4. The diagnosis of 
the two rectal NET was made in biopsy. Metastasis were present 
in 3 cases (2 rectal tumours and one small intestine tumour) and 
they were in the liver.
Conclusion: Contrary to many studies, the appendix is by far the 
most common location of NETs in this study. All appendiceal 
NETs were G1 and G2 and pT1 or pT2. Small intestine and rectal 
NETs were associated with metastasis and adverse prognostic 
factors (high grade and stage). We have confirmed the previously 
published findings that appendiceal NETs are associated with a 
good prognosis whereas small intestine and rectal tumours are 
frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage of metastatic disease.

Pre-operative staging of rectal neoplasia - a 8-year series of 
anatomopathological and imagiolocical correlation
M. de Brito Pereira*, T. França de Santana, J. Laert, P. Borralho
*Pathology Department, Hospital CUF Descobertas, Lisbon, 
Portugal
Background & objectives: The therapeutic approach to rectal neopla-
sia is highly dependent on the clinical and radiological TNM staging 
(T-tumour, N-node, M-metastasis), where magnetic resonance plays 
a central role in the staging. This study evaluates the concordance 
between magnetic resonance and anatomopathological assessment.
Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all cases of rec-
tal neoplasias (n=212) evaluated in our institution between Janu-
ary of 2014 to February of 2022. All patients with imagiological 
evaluation by magnetic resonance and lack of neoadjuvant therapy 
were considered (n=51). The anatomopathological staging and the 
imagiological staging were compared and classified as concordant, 
parcially concordant or discordant.
Results: All 51 cases were adenocarcinomas. The average age of 
the patients was 66,7 years (between 36 - 85 years old), divided 
into 30 males and 21 females.
The overall TNM staging concordance between the anatomopatho-
logical and imagiological pre-operative assessment was 35,3% (18 
cases). The majority of cases (53,0%, 27 patients) demonstrated a 
partial concordance. Discordance was present in 11,7% (6 cases) of 
patients. When evaluating the staging components separately, the 
tumour depth of invasion (T) was concordant in 72,5% (36 cases). 
Regarding the evaluation of lymph nodes (N), there was concord-
ance in 51,0% of cases (26 patients).
Conclusion: The results regarding the isolated evaluation of each 
staging component were similar to the previously described in lit-
erature. Concerning tumour depth of invasion, magnetic resonance 
imaging presents as an accurate, non-invasive method for staging 
rectal neoplasias. However, in half the cases the nodal status was 
not correctly evaluated. The physicians should remain aware of the 
limitations of pelvic magnetic resonance appraisal, especially in 
the detection of tumour nodal involvement.

Background & objectives: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tends to 
metastasize to extrahepatic organs. Stomach and duodenum involve-
ment has been seldom reported. We report a case of duodenal metas-
tasis revealing an unknown HCC in a male patient
Methods: A 74-year-old man, presented with atypical epigastric 
pain, asthenia and anorexia. Clinical examination did not reveal any 
abnormalities. Laboratory tests showed a microcytic hypochromic 
anaemia. The patient underwent an upper gastrointestinal endos-
copy which revealed an ulcerative mass of the duodenal bulb, 
measuring 3 cm. Multiple biopsies were performed.
Results: Microscopic examination revealed a carcinomatous 
proliferation, within the duodenal mucosa, arranged in solid 
and trabecular pattern. Tumour cells were polygonal, with 
abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm, nuclear atypia and 
brisk mitotic activity. The stroma was sparsely inflammatory. 
Immunohistochemically, tumour cells stained positive for Hep Par 
1. The diagnosis of bulbar metastasis of CHC was made and the 
patient was recalled for more investigations.
Conclusion: Gastrointestinal metastases from HCC are rare, with 
few cases reported in the stomach and duodenum. The suggested 
mechanism of metastasis is mainly direct invasion of a tumour 
contiguous with the GI tract. Herein we described a novel case of 
duodenal metastasis from HCC which presented as GI bleeding

Tumour-stroma ratio on the prognosis of colorectal cancer
R. Souza da Silva*, F.F.N. Gomes, J.P. Andrade, L.E.d.M. Barbosa, 
D.S.G. Silva
*Universidade Federal da Paraíba, Brazil
Background & objectives: Tumour–stroma ratio (TSR) is a histologi-
cal feature that reflects the value of the stromal component that sur-
rounds cancer cells and represents a potential prognostic factor. This 
study aimed to investigate the association between TSR and survival 
in colorectal cancer.
Methods: The TSR was evaluated in patients diagnosed with colo-
rectal adenocarcinoma.The analysed variables were age, gender, 
and pathological features according to the WHO classification.
The TSR was categorized into 2 groups: ≤50%- low stroma and 
>50%- high stroma.The association between categorized TSR 
and survival was analysed using the nonparametric Kaplan-Meier 
method. Associations between pathological features and overall 
survival were also verified.
Results: A total of 158 patients participated in this study, of 
which 40% had lymph node metastasis (regional disease). Tumour 
budding was observed in 22% of patients. Overall survival was 
associated with the presence of tumour budding (p-value=0.019) 
and lymph node metastasis (p-value=0.034), with lower survival 
for these patients. In the analysed sample, 53.8% of colorectal 
adenocarcimas fall into the high stroma category, and this group 
corresponded to the death outcome. The survival of patients in the 
≤ 50% - low stroma category was higher when compared to patients 
in the > 50% - high stroma category.
Conclusion: The tumour-stroma ratio (TSR) is a promising prog-
nostic biomarker in colon and rectal cancer, represents an inde-
pendent prognostic factor, such as lymph node metastasis and 
tumour budding. Stroma-rich colorectal cancers show a lower sur-
vival rate compared to low stromal tumours.

*Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Immunoscore (IS), based on the evalua-
tion of the immune infiltrate in the centre of the tumour and its inva-
sive margin, is reported to be related to colorectal carcinomas (CRC) 
progression. Our study aimed to assess its prognostic value in CRC.
Methods: A total of 104 tumour specimens from patients after 
curative resection were reviewed. An immunohistochemical study 
(anti-CD3, anti-CD8) was carried out in the areas of "Hot Spot" in 
the centre of the tumour and its invasive margin. IS was calculated 
by the method described by Galon et al. The prognostic value was 
assessed through a survival study.
Results: The mean age of patients was 61.6 years. IS was I0 in 
19.2%, I1 in 15.4%, I2 in 26%, I3 in 16.3% and I4 in 23.1%. Two 
groups were identified: low IS (≤ 2: I0-I2) and high IS (>2: I3 
and I4). A predominance of low IS (60.6%, n= 63) was noted. 
Our study had shown that low IS significantly deteriorates overall 
survival while high IS enhances survival significantly (p <0.001). 
We found a correlation between low IS and advanced pT stage (p 
= 0.026) but IS was not correlated with age, tumour size, tumour 
grade, vascular emboli, perineural invasion, metastasis and pTNM 
stage.
Conclusion: Increasing evidence demonstrates that the evolution 
of CRC is strongly dependent on the complex tumour microen-
vironment, particularly the immune system cells. Immunoscore 
is, therefore, a potential prognostic factor for time to recurrence, 
overall and disease-free survival in CRC together with its predic-
tive value of response to chemotherapy particularly in stage III. 
Its reproducibility and reliability allow its introduction into daily 
practice for a better therapeutic management.

tic, J. Sopta
*University of Belgrade, Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Pathol-
ogy, Belgrade, Serbia
Background & objectives: Skeletal metastases are the most frequent 
malignant bone tumours. The aim of our study is to determine fre-
quency of skeletal metastases as first clinical presentation of malignant 
tumours of digestive system.
Methods: All biopsies taken at the Institute for Orthopedic Sur-
gery “Banjica”, Belgrade over the 10-years period (2010-2019) 
were reviewed using histopathology reports from the files of 
the Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of 
Belgrade. Selected histological slides were re-examined. Clinical 
data were also analysed.
Results: A total of 110 cases of skeletal metastases of digestive 
tumours were analysed. The vast majority of patients were males 
(77.3%). The average age of patients was 62.8±9.8 years. Most of 
the patients had skeletal metastases as first sign of malignant dis-
ease (91,82%). Different imaging methods confirmed solitary skel-
etal lesions in 65.4% cases. Metastases of digestive tract carcinomas 
were localized in the axial skeleton in 42.1%, appendicular skeleton 
in 46.7%, in both localization in 10,2%. The most common clinical 
presentation of skeletal metastases were pain (75.4%), mobility difficul-
ties (28.2%) and pathological fracture (24.5%). Duration of symptoms 
before diagnosis was between 4-12 months (37.4% of patients).
Conclusion: Skeletal metastases of visceral carcinomas are com-
mon. In our study skeletal metastases were the first sign of malig-
nant tumours of digestive tract in the vast majority of patients. It 
is unusual finding that patients had no preexisting gastrointestinal 
symptoms. This finding is very important because skeletal metas-
tases are accepted as poor prognostic indicator. Early diagnosis 
through screening programs is highly important in future manage-
ment and treatment decisions.

Gastric epithelial dysplasia (intraepithelial neoplasia): from an 
impression to an algorithm
S. Mozgovoi*, A. Shimanskaya, M. Parygina, V. Rubtsov, A. 
Kononov
*Omsk State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: Epithelial dysplasia/intraepithelial 
neoplasia refers so-called marked gastric precancerous lesions. In the 
last revision of the WHO classification (2019), the term «dysplasia» 
was reintroduced, the terms indefinite dysplasia, intramucosal 
carcinoma and suspicion for invasive carcinoma are also used.
Methods: In order to evaluate an agreement level of specialists in 
the practical use of the WHO-2019 studies were carried out with 
group of pathologists with international participation. Selection of 
diagnostic patterns are identified by examining the biopsy material 
for the identification of three diagnostic signs of gastric epithelial 
dysplasia: epithelial atypia, differentiation gradient disorder (cell 
maturation) and histoarchitectonic disorganization.
Results: The agreement level was carried out using the Cohen’s 
kappa (k). Verbal designation of patterns was accompanied 
by demonstration of images, discussion of the expert consent 
criterion, evaluation of the level of reproducibility of identification 
of patterns from the position of personal assessment in a face-to-
face and remote mode, as well as the calculation of individual 
indicators in group training in comparison with reference variant. 
A poor level of interexpert agreement was found: general k = 0.2. 
After comments and discussion (master class) the expert consent 
criterion increased dramatically: general k = 0.83. However, this 
level of agreement reflected, rather, «diagnostic conformism» - 
experts reproduced the opinion of the moderator.
Conclusion: A schematic representation of diagnostic patterns, 
the application of which is described by the algorithm of 
actions, is support in making a diagnostic decision. The testing 
of the pictograms and algorithm allowed to reach a good level 
of agreement (k = 0.65). Usage of the proposed combinations 
of tissue and cellular patterns makes it possible to increase the 
accuracy and, most importantly, the reproducibility of diagnosis. 
Such approach probably reflects the new education standard for 
practical usage.

Crohn’s disease discovered through a herpetic superinfection: 
about a case
M. Alaya*, B. Chelly, A. Ayari, H. Azouz, A. Zehani, I. Chelly, 
K. Bellil, S. Haouet
*Department of Pathology, La Rabta Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Herpetic viral superinfection in patients 
with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is rare and responsible 
for outbreaks of IBD. This study aims to highlight the anatomo-clinical 
particularities of the association of IBD and herpes viral infections of 
the digestive tract.
Methods: We report a case collected in December 2011 in the 
Pathological Anatomy department of La Rabta Hospital.
Results: The patient was female, 21 years old and hospitalized 
for the first time in gastrology department due to liquid diarrhea

and weight loss. During the exploration, entero-CT scan has 
revealed extensive thickening of the entire right colon, as well as 
luminal collapse and presence of lymphadenopathy at the ileocecal 
junction. Histological examination revealed a disorganized 
architecture of the colonic and ileocecal mucosa with elongated, 
sinuous and distorted crypts. In addition, we noted the presence 
of multinucleated cells presenting a muriform aspect, with faded 
nuclei, voluminous and nucleolated in places. The chorion was 
inhabited by a rich inflammatory lymphocyte infiltrate mixed 
with neutrophils. neutrophils were in exocytosis producing crypt 
abscesses.
Conclusion: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a known cause of 
gastrointestinal infections, especially in immunocompromised 
patients. A few rare cases of colonic herpetic lesions in patients 
with IBD have been reported. With immunocompromised individu-
als, HSV regains higher pathogenicity and higher ease of dissemi-
nation. Therefore, it would be wise to search for HSV in immuno-
compromised patients with IBD. The gold standard of diagnostic 
tests is the search for HSV by PCR and immunohistochemistry on 
biopsies.

EBV associated Lymphoepitelioma-like cholangiocarcinoma: 
case report and literature review
M. Garcia Martos*, I. Peligros
*Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Spain
Background & objectives: Lymphoepitelioma-like cholangiocarci-
noma (LELCC) is an unusual type of cholangiocarcinoma first report in 
1996 by Hsu et al. LELCC EBV+ is a neoplasm with better prognosis 
than conventional cholangiocarcinoma (CC), and female and young 
predominance.
Methods: We present a 49 years old male with history of primary 
sclerosing cholangitis, obesity, IBD and ischemic cardiopathy. 
An abdominal CT scan revealed two nodules in right hepatic lobe 
(18 & 24 mm) and pathologic regional lymph nodes. Liver needle 
biopsy was performed. Liver biopsy was diagnosis of poorly dif-
ferentiated carcinoma, so surgery was indicated.
Results: Patient underwent surgery with right liver excision, 
cholecystectomy and regional lymph nodes dissection. Histo-
logically tumour was composed by poorly differentiated cells 
arranged in nest, cords or lobules with focal glandular differen-
tiation. Between neoplastic cells, there was a dense lymphoid 
infiltrate with lymphoid follicles. That reactive lymphoid infil-
trate obscured the malignant epithelial cells. Lymph nodes were 
positive. Malignant cells were IHC positive for CK7 & CK19, 
and negative for Hepar1. EBV was demonstrated by ISH. No 
loss of MMR was demonstrated, EGFR and KRAS were WT, 
and PDL1 expression (SP142) was high. 3 months after surgery 
the patient is alive although he is on QT because of remain loco 
regional disease.
Conclusion: LELCC is a rare variant of CC with strong asso-
ciation with EBV and distinctive clinical behaviour and patho-
logical features (no more 65 cases published). There is marked 
female predominance, although our case is a male and young 
age. The clinical outcome for EBV associated LELCC is better 
than CC, may be due to the dense lymphoid infiltration, which 
is a host defence against the tumour. LELCC has higher expres-
sion of PDL1 and this could have implications for potential 
treatment strategies.

Unusual association of primary high grade neuroendocrine 
tumour and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the liver 
– a case report
B. Akiki*, N. D’Haene, C. Maris, M. Remmelink, P. Demetter
*Erasme University Hospital, Belgium
Background & objectives: Neuroendocrine neoplasms in the liver are 
usually metastatic and primary hepatic neuroendocrine neoplasms 
are rare, representing about 0.3% of all neuroendocrine neoplasms, 
with, to our knowledge, 153 cases reported in the English literature. 
Methods: This case concerns a 44-year-old man, previously healthy, who 
presented to the emergency department for abdominal pain, vomiting, 
and watery diarrhea. An abdominal CT-scan was performed and revealed 
a 12 cm large, heterogeneous hepatic mass, located in segment IVb. Pre-
operative fine needle biopsy of the mass suggested a well-differentiated 
(grade 2) neuroendocrine tumour.
Results: Grossly, the left enlarged hepatectomy specimen was 
almost totally replaced by a heterogeneous solid mass. Histo-
logically, the tumour presented two components: a well differ-
entiated one with organoid architecture and cells presenting a 
“salt and pepper” appearance, associated with a poorly differ-
entiated component made up of large cells. Necrosis was evalu-
ated to 50%. Both components demonstrated immunoreactivity 
for synaptophysin, chromogranin and INSM-1. Mitotic count 
was higher than 20 mitosis/2mm2, with a proliferative index, 
evaluated by Ki67, of 23%. Cells in the poorly differentiated 
area over-expressed p53, which was confirmed by molecular 
study. Primary hepatic tumour, associating a grade 3 neuroen-
docrine tumour and a large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma diag-
nosis was made.
Conclusion: The concurrent occurrence in the liver of a high 
grade neuroendocrine tumour and a neuroendocrine carcinoma 
has, to our knowledge, never been reported in the English litera-
ture. Primary hepatic neuroendocrine neoplasms are slow grow-
ing tumours that usually present at advance stage; their diagnosis 
remains challenging and should be made after elimination of 
other possible primitives. The results from our molecular analy-
sis suggest that the neuroendocrine carcinoma component devel-
oped from the neuroendocrine tumour component after TP53 
mutation.

Medullary carcinoma of the pancreas: a case report and review 
of the literature
M. Hanks*, G. Irving, A.M. Zaitoun
*Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Medullary carcinoma of the pancreas is 
a rare tumour with a five-year survival rate of approximately 13%. 
Previously, this entity was regarded as a subset of poorly differentiated 
ductal adenocarcinomas, however, they have a distinctive morphologi-
cal and molecular characteristic.
Methods: The aetiology and pathogenesis are not clearly under-
stood however several studies have shown strong associations with 
a first degree relative with previous cancer and hereditary nonpoly-
posis colorectal cancer. Medullary carcinoma does not respond 
well to chemotherapy making surgery the first line treatment. It is 
important to differentiate from poorly differentiated adenocarci-
noma with Epstein-Barr Virus infection as this mimics medullary 
carcinoma.

Results: We report the case of a 69-year-old male with a mass 
in the head of pancreas initially thought to be a neuroendocrine 
tumour. On resection, morphology showed solid sheets of cells 
with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, large vesicular nuclei and 
prominent nucleoli with a diffuse infiltration of tumour lympho-
cytes. Tumour borders were pushing with a dense chronic inflam-
matory infiltrate in surrounding stroma. Immunohistochemistry 
showed positivity for CAM5.2, EMA and CDX2 but was negative 
for MUC2, MUC4, CK7, Napsin, CA19.9 and EBV. Ki-67 prolifer-
ation index was over 80%. The tumour displayed loss of expression 
of the mismatch repair genes MLH1 and PMS2. Further mutational 
analysis revealed no KRAS, NRAS or BRAF variants.
Conclusion: Medullary carcinoma of the pancreas is a rare entity 
associated with microsatellite instability, mismatch repair defects, 
colorectal adenocarcinoma and familial syndromes. Our case 
demonstrates classical morphological features including dense 
tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, poorly differentiated epithelial 
cells with syncytial growth and pushing borders. Following 
diagnosis, genetic counselling should be considered to exclude 
Lynch syndrome as this may be the first sign of an inherited 
cancer syndrome. The case highlights the range of next generation 
techniques required to maintain best patient care.

An extraordinary case of epithelioid/glandular malignant 
peripheral nerve sheath tumour arising between the ampulla 
of Vater and the pancreatic head

Masteas, V. Stoyanova, G. Vilaras, S. Stasinopoulou
*Pathology Department NIMTS Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Glandular MPNSTs are extremely rare 
neoplasms with only a few cases reported in the literature. To the best 
of our knowledge this is the first case arising in the anatomic location 
of the ampulla of Vater and the pancreatic head
Methods: A 63-year-old male without signs of Neurofibromato-
sis-1 underwent Whipple’s procedure for a 10.8cm tumour assumed 
to be a "GIST". He had no remarkable clinical history and never 
received Radiotherapy. CT-scans revealed no evidence of disease 
elsewhere. Microscopically, the tumour was composed of highly 
mitotic and pleomorphic spindle cells with a marbling appearance 
and to a lesser extent of epithelioid/glandular areas with cribriform, 
solid and glandular patterns. Rare foci of squamous and heterolo-
gous osteoid elements were also noted.
Results: By immunohistochemistry, the sarcomatoid areas of 
the neoplasm were focally and weakly positive for S-100.The 
epithelioid areas were strongly positive for CkAE1/AE3 and 
BerEp4. All GIST markers (CD117, DOG1, CD34) as well as 
PDGFRA molecular testing were negative along with melanocytic 
markers (Melan-a, HMB-45, SOX-10), smooth muscle markers 
(SMA,desmin), markers of lipomatous lineage(MDM2, CDK4), 
neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin, synaptophysin), 
mesothelial markers (calretinin, D2-40), STAT6 and TLE1. 
Moreover there was immunohistochemical loss of nuclear 
H3K27me3 and complete loss of p16 indicative of CDKN2A 
gene silencing mutation. Tumour cells tested negative by FISH 
for gene fusions characteristic of synovial sarcoma (SS18-SSX1, 
SS18-SSX2, SS18-SSX4). Considering the morphology, the 
immunohistochemical and molecular results, we diagnosed the 
tumour as a sporadic High-Grade MPNST with malignant epithelial 
component.
Conclusion: Our case highlights the potential of MPNSTs for 
divergent differentiation. Interestingly enough,the epithelioid com-
ponent of the tumour had metastasized to one peripancreatic lymph 
node. A high level of awareness is required by the pathologist to 
accurately diagnose this extremely rare group of neoplasms. It is 
essential that all other entities in the differential diagnosis have 
been excluded first. In our case we focused especially on biphasic 
synovial sarcoma, primary or metastatic sarcomatoid carcinomas 
and carcinosarcomas, dedifferentiated liposarcoma and even malig-
nant mesothelioma, leiomyosarcoma and melanoma.

A. Grigoras, A.D. Timofte, A. Rusu
*"Grigore T. Popa" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Iasi, 
Romania
Background & objectives: Endophilin A3 (SH3GL3), is a BAR 
domain protein involved in transmembrane trafficking. EndoA3 can 
favor distinct tumoral phenotype, hyperproliferative or prometa-
static effect. Our study aimed to evaluate SH3GL3 expression and 
to correlate it with clinicopathological features in pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma.
Methods: Archival specimen from 67 cases diagnosed with PDAC 
in "St. Spiridon" University Hospital were stained using anti-
SH3GL3 antibody. The cases were assessed semi-quantitatively 
based on the intensity of rection and percentage of positive cells, 
resulting a two-tier classification: negative and positive EndoA3. 
A statistical analysis was performed.
Results: SH3GL3 immunostaining was positive in 53 cases and 
negative in 14 cases. In tumour epithelial cells the marker pre-
sented a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern usually with week or moderate 
intensity levels, focally with granular perimembranous condensa-
tions. Within the SH3GL3 positive group, we recorded 2 cases 
staged as pT1, 29 as pT2, 21 as pT3 and 1 as pT4. The tumours 
were graded as follow: 8 cases were G1, 44 were G2 and 1 case 
G3. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between 
SH3GL3 expression and tumour stage (p=0.018), tumour grade 
(p=0.001).
Conclusion: Overall, our data support that SH3GL3 expression 
could be considered as prognostic marker, indicating an aggressive 
behaviour of PDAC.

Pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasm with Leydig cells and 
co-existent multifocal low grade pancreatic intraepithelial 
neoplasia
M. Rao*, V. Varshney, T. Yadav, R. Sharma, A. Nalwa
*All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur, India
Background & objectives: Mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) of the 
pancreas is a cyst forming neoplasm of the pancreas with mucinous 
lining and characteristic ovarian-type subepithelial stroma. Despite the 
presence of ovarian-type stroma, the presence of Leydig cells is not 
well established in MCN.
Methods: A 60-year-female presented to the OPD with non-spe-
cific abdominal fullness, and on work-up had a mass lesion in the 
body of pancreas. Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were 
performed.
Results: The resected pancreas measured 13x6x4cm and spleen 
measured 12x6x5.5cm and weighed 340 grams. A cyst measuring 
5x5x4cm was noted in the body of the pancreas. On microscopy, 
the cyst was lined by mucinous epithelium, and the subepithe-
lial tissue showed ovarian-type stroma with nests of Leydig cells,

which were confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The rest of the 
pancreas showed multifocal low grade pancreatic intraepithelial 
neoplasia (PaIN)
Conclusion: Presence of Leydig cells in the ovarian-type stroma 
of MCN has not been widely reported. This finding suggests that 
the ‘ovarian-type’ stroma may in fact actually be ovarian stroma, 
which further supports the theorized pathogenesis of this tumour, 
that the ectopic ovarian stroma incorporated in the pancreas during 
embryogenesis may become activated in the setting of hormonal 
imbalance. Presence of multifocal PaIN in the case also support 
possible common mutations and genetic pathway.

A. Tzingounis, G. Zografos, M.M. Konstadoulakis, G. Kafiri
*Pathology department, General hospital of Athens "Hippokratio", 
Greece
Background & objectives: Research data denotes Pancreatic Neuroen-
docrine Neoplasms (pNENs) to represent genetically different entities, 
tumours (pNETs) and carcinomas (pNECs) with different malignant 
potential. Current study explores senescence associated marker p21 
and senescence regulator Caveolin-1 expression profiles between the 
two subtypes.
Methods: Both protein expression profiles were studied immu-
nohistochemically in paraffin-embedded pancreatic lesions and 
normal adjacent tissues (NAT) from 24 pNEN patients (13 pNETs 
and 11 pNECs mean-age: 59.69±3.2 and 61.18±3.2 respectively). 
Staining intensity scores were calculated by multiplying intensity 
(negative to high: 0-3) with the immunoreactive score: 0-10%=1, 
11-50%=2, 51-80%=3, 81-100%=4) and data were statistically 
analysed using SPSS 26.
Results: Immunostaining of senescence marker p21 was 
increased in both cancer epithelium and stroma (pNEC) com-
pared to NAT corresponding elements (p=0.048 and p=0.04 
respectively). Induced p21 expression was also detected in 
pNEC patients both epithelium and stroma when compared to 
pNET patients (p=0.002 and p=0.024 respectively). In between 
pNEN groups caveolin-1 expression was also more prominent 
in pNEC patients’ epithelium. Still within pNEC patient group 
loss of caveolin-1 expression in their epithelium was observed 
in those with positive lymph nodes metastasis (p=0.034). In the 
pNET a reduction in the expression of caveolin-1 was observed 
in the presence of inflammation (p=0.03).
Conclusion: Based on p21 expression, induced senescence seems 
a common feature of pNENs although more prominent in pNECs 
and with caveolin-1 concomitant expression in pNEC epithelium 
to promote senescence. A role of caveolin-1 protein in tumour pro-
gression was also apparent, as loss of expression in pNECs epi-
thelium with high metastatic potential was observed. Additionally, 
loss of stromal caveolin-1 upon the presence of inflammation in 
pNETs was observed potentially associated with caveolin-1 medi-
ated senescence due to release of SASP factors.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the liver: a rare, diagnostically 
challenging case
A.H. Aydin*, S. Yamak, G. Gürsoy, İ. Ovali Erdoğdu, Y.B. Özoğul
*Ankara City Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is a 
malignant epithelial neoplasm that arises most common in major sali-
vary glands. It occurs rarely in liver. To now there have been less than 
20 cases reported. We report a case of primary MEC of liver.
Methods: Our patient was a 70-year-old female. A mass of 
approximately 65x55 mm in size, located in the liver segment 5 
was detected. It was evaluated as a possible primary liver malig-
nancy. Then the patient was taken liver segmentectomy operation. 
In macroscopic examination an ill-defined lesion was detected.
Results: Histology of the lesion revealed that the tumour 
was composed of tumour cells that coalescing as glandular 
structures and solid nests in some areas as well. On non-cirrhotic 
background there was a tumour that consisted of the mixture of 
squamous, mucinous and intermediate cells to varying degrees. 
Histomorphologic and immunohistomorfologic evidence were 
interpreted as mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Any possible primary 
focus was not detected by additional imaging methods, so the 
tumour was diagnosed as MEC which is an uncommon subtype of 
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
Conclusion: MEC is the most common malignant epithelial neo-
plasm of salivary glands in adults and children. It rarely occurs 
in other organs. MEC of the liver is extremely rare. First case in 
liver was presented by Pianzola and Drut in 1971. Due to its rela-
tive infrequency in liver, the pathogenesis has not been elucidated. 
Primary MEC of the liver is a highly aggressive tumour with the 
overall survival shorter than 6 months.

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas, a study of 
4 cases
S. Kartal*, E. Tuncer, H. Özer
*Sivas Cumhuriyet University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Solid Pseudopapillary Neooplasms (SPNP) 
of the pancreas are rare and low grade pancreatic neoplasms, seems 
dominantly in females. We aimed to evaluate retrospective data analy-
sis, clinical, macroscopic and microscopic features of our SPNP cases 
and compare them with the literature.
Methods: Here we presented four cases of SPNP which were diag-
nosed between 2012-2022 years in Sivas Cumhuriyet University 
Pathology Department. We reassessed our cases and compared our 
findings with the literature.
Results: All the patients were female. Their ages ranged from 18 
to 58 years with an average of 42. The tumours were located in 
various parts of the pancreas and the average size was 5 cm. Macro-
scopically, all lesions had shown cystic and solid areas. The young-
est patient had a history of pituitary adenoma and suspicion of 
Lynch syndrome due to PMS-1 heterozygosity. None of the patients 
had metastatic lesion. Microscopically none had lymphatic inva-
sion and two patients were assessed as pT3 due to peripancreatic 
adipose tissue invasion. All of the SPNP cases had heterogene-
ous pattern with solid and pseudopapillary structures and showed 
haemorrhagic and pseudocystic changes in various areas.
Conclusion: When the clinical, microscopic and macroscopic fea-
tures of our cases were evaluated, they were found to be compatible 
with the literature. In addition, although a few cases of other pan-
creatic tumours incidentally associated with Familial Adenomatous 
Polyposis Syndrome have been reported in the literature, there is 
no definite data about the association of pancreatic tumours with 
Lynch syndrome as probably suspected in one of our cases. Addi-
tional studies are needed to elucidate this issue.

Mixed acinar neuroendocrine tumour: a rare case of pancreatic 
tumour
E. Souka*, G. Stanc, G. Galanopoulos, L. Karelis, O. Tzaida, E. 
Kontis
*Pathology Department Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Acinar cell carcinomas are rare tumours, 
representing 1-2% of all pancreatic adult tumours. We present a case of 
acinar pancreatic carcinoma and short review of the literature
Methods: A 81-year -old male patient presented with abdominal 
pain and weight loss. CT-imaging revealed a well demarcated 
tumour measuring 4.5 cm in greatest diameter at the pancreatic 
body. On sectioning the tumour was totally encapsulated, solid, 
tan with fleshy consistency.
Results: On low power microscopic examination, the tumour 
was cellular and macronodular with fibrous strands. On higher 
magnification it had an acinar, trabecular, and solid growth 
pattern. The neoplasm consisted of a mixture of small-sized 
cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and medium-sized cells with 
distinct nucleolus and eosinophilic granular cytoplasm PAS(+), 
PASD(+), AB(-) on histochemical examination. There was 
increased mitotic activity (15-20mitosis/10HPF) and spotty 
necrosis. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed a CKAE1/
AE3(+), CK7(+), CK19(+), CK8/18(+), Trypsin diffusely (+), 
Chromogranin-A diffusely (+), Synaptophysin(+) , NSE(+), 
CD56(+), Vimentin (-), MUC5AC(-), TTF1(-), PAX8(-), CDX2(-
), Ki-67 25% phenotype. The diagnosis was consistent with acinar 
carcinoma with extensive neuroendocrine markers expression, 
corresponding to mixed acinar- neuroendocrine carcinoma subtype.
Conclusion: Mixed pancreatic carcinomas include all combina-
tions of ductal, acinar, or neuroendocrine differentiation, com-
monly a mixture of predominant acinar and neuroendocrine com-
ponent. In case of a discrete neuroendocrine component accounting 
>30% of the tumour, the neoplasm is designated MiNEN. Alter-
natively, they can show extensive mixture of acinar and neuroen-
docrine cells, whereupon they are designated as acinar carcinoma, 
mixed subtype. They share the same prognosis as pure pancreatic 
acinar carcinoma.

A singular case of primary hepatic extra gastrointestinal stro-
mal tumour (EGIST)
A. Abrari*, U. Mukherjee
*The Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: A primary hepatic GIST is an exception-
ally rare, barely reported entity, of which we report a singular case.
Methods: A 65-year-old female patient with symptomatology 
and clinical features of a solitary hepatic mass lesion was worked 
up, with investigations culminating in an ultrasonography-guided 
biopsy which was examined histologically and subjected to ancil-
lary testing. A structured differential diagnosis was established and 
each entity/group of lesions was excluded systematically, until a 
conclusion was attained.
Results: This biopsy showed a morphologically non-committal 
lesion, which on concerted diagnostic effort, utilising a broad-
based immunohistochemistry panel, which also included GIST 
determining markers, CD34, c-Kit and DOG-1: was diagnosed as 
a hepatic extra gastrointestinal stromal tumour (hepatic EGIST). 
The possibility of secondary hepatic involvement was incontrovert-
ibly discounted clinically.
Conclusion: GISTs predilect the stomach and small intestine, 
but these tumours can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal 
tract. Extra gastrointestinal stromal tumours [EGISTs] have been 
reported in the omentum and a slew of cases elsewhere. Our case 
underpins the importance of a non-dogmatic, broad-based analytic 
approach in dealing with a morphologically obscure hepatic neo-
plasm, which may well turn out to be the rare primary hepatic GIST 
/ EGIST. The management implications of a precise diagnosis, in 
this situation, cannot be overemphasised.

Low-phospholipid associated cholelithiasis syndrome - a case 
report and literature review
J. dos Santos*, G. Miranda, T. Amaro
*Unidade Local de Saúde de Matosinhos, Portugal
Background & objectives: Low-Phospholipid Associated 
Cholelithiasis (LPAC) syndrome is a genetic disease associated with a 
mutation of the ABCB4 gene which codes for protein MDR3, a biliary 
carrier. It is characterized by the development of biliary lithiasis with 
no excess of cholesterol secretion.
Methods: We report a case of a 54-year-old female with clinical 
criteria for LPAC syndrome and ABCB4 gene mutation. She 
had a complex history of cholangitis/pancreatitis recurrence 
despite cholecystectomy and treatment with ursodeoxycholic 
acid. Hepatectomy was performed based on imagiologic findings 
consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.
Results: The gross examination revealed three specimens of 
hepatic tissue, weighing 97,5 gr, the largest measuring 87x40x60 
mm. On the cut surface, there were some ill-defined, withish and 
firm areas; the remainder of the parenchyma was homogeneous 
and tanned. Histologically, there was no malignant lesion but some 
signs pointing to biliary duct obstruction were found: mild por-
tal fibrosis, sometimes with “onion bulb” pericanalary pattern, 
ductular proliferation and mononuclear moderate chronic portitis. 
Few epitheloid granulomas and multinucleated giant cells with 
cholesterol crystals were also identified. After surgery, the patient 
developed an abdominal abscess that was successfully managed 
with antibiotics and drainage. The patient is alive and well, three 
months post surgery.
Conclusion: LPAC syndrome is defined by two of the following 
criteria: age < 40 years at onset of biliary symptoms, recurrence 
of biliary symptoms after cholecystectomy, and intrahepatic 
hyperechogenic foci detected by ultrasound. This case reports 
LPAC syndrome in a female with two diagnostic criteria and 
mutation of the ABCB4 gene. Histologically there are no 
pathognomonic lesions, but variable findings related to intrahepatic 
lithiasis may be seen. This report emphasizes the importance 
of pathological examination and multidisciplinarity in LPAC 
syndrome.

Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma: a case report
G. Miranda*, J. dos Santos, L. Cirnes, J. Correia-Pinto, T. Amaro
*Unidade Local de Saúde de Matosinhos - HPH, Portugal
Background & objectives: Report of the clinicopathological fea-
tures of a hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma This entity is an 
extremely rare, often multifocal, malignant vascular tumour with dif-
ficult diagnosis due to the clinical and pathological similarities with 
other hepatic neoplasms, especially the angiosarcoma.
Methods: An 82-year-old man presented with icteric skin and gen-
eralized oedema. The abdominal Ultrasound and the Computed 
Tomography showed a multinodular and heterogeneous liver that 
was biopsied.
S242
Virchows Archiv (2022) 481 (Suppl 1):S1–S364
1 3
Results: Histology showed malignant epithelioid cells with 
eosinophilic cytoplasm and moderate nuclear pleomorphism within 
a myxohyaline stroma. No mitotic figures or necrosis were present. 
Tumour cells expressed positivity for vascular markers (CD 34, 
CD31 and Factor VIII) and were negative for cytokeratins. Both 
WWTR1-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 gene fusions are characteristics 
of this neoplasm. WWTR1-CAMTA1 gene fusion, resulting from a 
t(1;3)(p36;q25) translocation, is found in as many as 90% of cases. 
However, this tumour did not express these molecular alterations. 
The patient died in the following month of the diagnosis from 
terminal hepatic insufficiency.
Conclusion: Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a rare 
tumour with immunoreactivity for keratins in many cases, poten-
tially leading to confusion with carcinomas. The differential diag-
nosis are metastatic or primary carcinomas and angiosarcoma. The 
latter is the most common primary malignant liver mesenchymal 
tumour in adults, and therefore, it is important for pathologists 
to be familiar with the immunohistopathological features of this 
hepatic entity.

A rare case of primary signet ring ampullary carcinoma
A. Vilaia*, D. Raduta, L. Nichita, A. Voiosu, C. Popp
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Signet-ring cell subtype of ampullary car-
cinoma is a rare occurrence with only than 49 cases reported in the 
literature. We present a case of a 68-year-old woman diagnosed with 
signet-ring cell ampullary carcinoma.
Methods: 68-year-old woman complaining of chronic upper 
abdominal pain diagnosed with duodenal ulcer after mul-
tiple endoscopic examination, presented to the emergency 
room with worsening of abdominal pain and sudden onset of 
jaundice. A CT scan was performed describing an ampullary 
lesion suggestive for a benign process, with no secondary 
lesions present.
Results: The patient was transferred to our gastroenterology depart-
ment and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatog-
raphy demonstrating occlusion of the common bile duct by a large, 
ulcerated lesion of the ampulla of Vater. Multiple biopsy fragments 
were taken from the affected area. The histopathologic examination 
revealed an ulcerated malignant proliferation of discohesive cells with 
signet-ring features, infiltrating the submucosa and expanding the lam-
ina propria and villi. The diagnosis was supported by the special stains 
and immunohistochemistry markers performed. On small superficially 
obtained samples or ulcerated biopsy fragments, in the absence of clini-
cal suspicion of a malignant proliferation, the diagnosis can be easily 
missed in the early stages.
Conclusion: Signet-ring cell ampullary carcinoma is a rare entity 
and it may be difficult to diagnose. The patients usually present 
with jaundice and some of them with abdominal pain and it usually 
presents as an expansive ulcerated lesion with malignant features 
but there are cases when the endoscopic or CT aspects may not 
suggest a malignant process. Literature studies show that extensive 
sampling and biopsy fragments obtained from the depth of the 
lesion are needed for accurate microscopic diagnosis.

Pancreatic carcinoma: primary or metastatic? A case report
E. Souka*, G. Galanopoulos, G. Stanc, N. Novkovic, K. 
Manoloudaki
*Pathology Department Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Pancreatic metastases are rare with 
reported incidence 1.6% to 11% in autopsy studies. We report a rare 
case of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) metastatic to the pancreas, clini-
cally suspected as a new primary tumour and a brief literature review.
Methods: A 78-year-old female with a prior radical nephrectomy 
in 2002 for renal cell carcinoma was consulted for atypical abdomi-
nal pain. CT-imaging showed a multilobulated mass measuring 
4.5cm in greatest diameter at the pancreatic tail. A distal pancrea-
tectomy was performed.
Results: On microscopic examination the tumour was composed 
of clear cells with distinct membrane and pronounced nucleolus 
arranged in a solid and alveolar pattern. There were extensive 
areas of necrosis. Immunohistochemical examination revealed 
a [CKAE1/AE3(+), Cam5.2(+), EMA(+), Vimentin(+), 
CD10(+), RCC weekly (+), CK7(-), CD117(-), Chromoganin 
A(-), Synaptophysin(-)] phenotype. The morphological and 
immunohistochemical findings were consistent with metastatic 
clear cell renal carcinoma, in agreement with the past medical 
history.
Conclusion: Among the metastasis to the pancreas, renal cell 
carcinoma is the most common. Despite this fact the clinical and 
radiological differential diagnosis of the metastasis remains a 
challenge. Histological examination is paramount for the accurate 
diagnosis.

Collision of low-grade hepatocellular carcinoma and low-
grade chondrosarcoma
A. Montasser*, S. E Anis, E. A Ishak
*Department of Pathology, Theodor Bilharz Research Institute, 
Egypt
Background & objectives: Collision tumours of the liver are rare. The 
commonest variant is collision of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 
cholangiocarcinoma. Chondroid differentiation may occur in sarcoma-
toid HCCs which are high grade tumours. We report the collision of 
low-grade HCC and low-grade chondrosarcoma.
Methods: A 65-years-old man with liver cirrhosis and history 
of treated viral C hepatitis presented with hepatic focal lesion 
(4x4.3cm) in segment VIII with elevated alpha-feto protein 
(AFP) and portal vein thrombosis. Patient started Sorafenib 
therapy and lesion pursued a stationary course for 18 months, 
with drop of AFP and recanalization of portal vein. Right 
hepatectomy was done.
Results: The received surgical specimen revealed two adjacent 
nodules of tumour with well demarcated borders on a background 
of micronodular cirrhosis. Histologically, one tumour consisted 
of mildly pleomorphic polygonal hepatocytes arranged in 
thick trabecular and pseudoacinar patterns. The other tumour 
showed mildly pleomorphic malignant chondrocytes in lacunae 
embedded in chondroid stroma.
Immunohistochemicially, the epithelial tumour was positive for 
HepPar-1, Glypican-3, and Arginase-1 confirming hepatocellular 
nature, while the mesenchymal tumour was positive for S100 
and negative for epithelial markers. Molecular analysis is being 
performed.
Post-operative 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT revealed 
clear operative bed with no FDG avid skeletal or soft tissue lesions.
Six-months post-operative, the patient is event-free.
Conclusion: The presence of chondroid matrix in HCC is not 
conclusive to high-grade sarcomatoid tumours, as collision of 
HCC and chondrosarcoma exists. Collision tumours of the liver 
are extremely rare and should always be reported and molecular

Audit of key pathological parameters in pancreaticoduodenec-
tomy specimens performed for pancreatic ductal adenocarci-
noma in a national centre over an 11-year period
J. Maguire*, J. Yang, M.B. Cotter, J. Murphy, N. Swan
*St Vincent’s University Hospital, Ireland
Background & objectives: Pancreaticoduodenectomy(PD) 
is the mainstay of curative treatment for pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma(PDAC), however, the approach to pathological exami-
nation varies widely. Our aim was to assess the rate of microscopic 
margin involvement(R1) and nodal involvement(N1) in PD specimens 
performed at our institution.
Methods: Pathology reports from PDs performed for PDAC were 
retrieved from our laboratory database between 2011-2021. Mar-
gin status, number/name of involved margins, number of positive 
lymph nodes and the correlation between nodal positivity and R1 
status were assessed. Patient age, sex, neoadjuvant treatment status, 
tumour grade and stage were also recorded.
Results: A total of 272 PD specimens were received. The majority 
were in males(55%) and the median age was 69. 63% were grade 2. 
The median number of nodes retrieved was 18 with 67% showing 
N1 status. 35% of specimens had a final R1 status. Of these, 59% 
had a single involved margin, 41% had multiple involved margins. 
The facing superior mesenteric vein(SMV) dissection margin was 
the most commonly involved(51%). The pancreatic neck transection 
margin was involved in 15%. 29% of the cases had prior neoadju-
vant treatment. The R1 rate in the neoadjuvant cases was 20%. 83% 
of R1 cases had metastatic disease to lymph nodes(N1).
Conclusion: Using the Royal College of Pathologists criteria for 
positive margin status in PD specimens (<1mm to inked margin), 
the rate of R1 status in our cohort has averaged at 34% (11%-
64%) over 11 years. The margin most often involved was the facing 
SMV dissection margin. Neoadjuvant cases had a low rate of R1 
status(20%). Margin involvement was associated with lymph node 
involvement in 83% of cases, in keeping with international data.

Intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm of the pancreas asso-
ciated with invasive carcinoma: case report
R.D.P. Lopez-Panqueva*, J. Andrade-Restrepo, A. Vera Torres, 
R.E. Andrade Perez
*Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Hospital 
Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá/School of Medicine, 
Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia
Background & objectives: Intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm 
(IOPN) of the pancreas is an uncommon type of cystic pancreatic 
tumour. Additionally, although rarely reported, association with 
invasive carcinomas has been established but its long-term behaviour 
hasn’t been fully described.
Methods: A 62-year-old was programmed for endoscopic ultra-
sound after an incidental finding of a pancreatic cyst. The study 
revealed a multiloculated cyst with thick septs and a single solid 
nodule inside, suggestive of a mucinous neoplasm. The lesion was 
associated with asymmetric dilation of the principal pancreatic 
duct. Patient underwent pancreatoduodenectomy, and excised tis-
sues were sent to pathology.
Results: The excised tissue showed a multiloculated cyst with a 2 
cm diameter. Histopathological study of the resection revealed an 
intraductal papillary growth from a pseudostratified epithelium of 
cuboidal cells with big nucleus, prominent nucleolus, and increased 
eosinophilic cytoplasm (oncocytic); associated with occasional 
goblet cells. They are arranged in focal, cribriform and cystic struc-
tures, which morphologically correspond to IOPN. In addition, 
adjacent to the main cyst formation, foci of irregular glandular 
structures made up of oncocytic epithelium are found, surrounded 
by desmoplastic stroma, revealing an associated invasive carci-
noma. HepPar-1 and CK-7 were positive in both the invasive and 
intraductal components, and Ki-67 was expressed in 30%, confer-
ring a high proliferation rate.
Conclusion: IOPN has been historically considered a subtype of 
intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). Nonetheless, 
recognized recently as a distinct entity from IPMN, also determined 
as a precursor of invasive carcinoma. The association of background 
invasive carcinoma and its postresection surveillance have not been 
fully described, and ranges from 20-60%; occasionally associated 
with completion of pancreatoduodenectomy. Consequently, there’s 
a need to report cases, for further characterization and development 
of adequate protocols for long-term management

Correlation of endosonography-guided fine needle aspira-
tion cytology, and needle biopsy in the diagnosis of pancreatic 
lesions, at Fundación Santa Fe de Bogota, Colombia
R.D.P. Lopez-Panqueva*, H.A. Gonzalez, R. Pinto-Carta, A. Vera 
Torres, M. Mejía-Arango
*Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Hospital 
Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá/School of Medicine, 
Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia
Background & objectives: Diagnosis of pancreatic lesion is 
challenging. Endosonography-guided aspiration (EUS‐FNA) and 
biopsy (EUS‐FNB) are useful as a diagnostic tool. This study aims 
to define the correlation between eco-endosonograpy-guided fine 
needle aspiration cytology, and through-the-needle biopsy diagnosis 
of pancreatic lesions.
Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of patients who under-
went EUS-FNB and EUS-FNA as part of the diagnosis of pan-
creatic lesions. Diagnostic correlation for the two most common 
diagnosis: ductal adenocarcinoma (PDCA), and neuroendocrine 
tumour (pNET), with the two tests was evaluated using hypoth-
esis test, correlation coefficient, and prevalence of diagnosis.
Results: One hundred-seventeen patients were evaluated, 
59(50.43%) male, and 58(49.57%) female. Seventy patients 
(70) were diagnosed with PDCA, and nineteen (19) patients 
with pNET. Other diagnoses included autoimmune pancreatitis, 
necrotizing granulomatous disease, and mucinous neoplasms 
among others.
There was a good correlation between cytology and biopsy 
diagnosis for PDCA (chi2 P=0,0001), and (kappa-Cohen 
0.7844; IC(0,5356-1,0332). Surgical specimens’ information 
was available for 17 patients. Diagnostic correlation of cytology 
and surgical specimen was (0.736; IC(0,3872-1,085)). A total 
of 41(58,57%) patients, presented with advanced, inoperable, 
PDCA. For 19 patients with pNET, no correlation between 
cytology and biopsy specimens was found (p=<0,21). All pNET 
tumours were small, under 2 cm in diameter.
Conclusion: There is a correlation between cytology and biopsy 
diagnosis of PDCA, making both tests comparable. For pNET, no 
correlation was found, although the number of cases was limited, 
and most cases were small and challenging to access.

Cytology and biopsy diagnosis for advance inoperable disease in 
PDCA is highly useful, allowing anatomopathological diagnosis 
for chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment decisions. Accuracy 
measurement of the two tests requires a larger series that include 
surgical specimen diagnosis as a gold standard.

First presentation of amyloidosis diagnosed in a gallbladder 
specimen
E. Stoupi*, D. Myoteri, K. Papadopoulos, A. Vezakis, D. Tiniakos
*Aretaieion University Hospital of Athens, Pathology Department, 
Greece
Background & objectives: Amyloidosis is caused by extracellular 
deposition of insoluble fibrillar proteins. Two major types are 
AL-primary,myeloma associated and AA-secondary amyloidosis. 
Common sites include kidneys,heart,liver, nervous system and 
gastrointestinal tract. We present a rare case of gallbladder amyloidosis 
discovered incidentally after cholecystectomy.
Methods: An 83-year-old male without significant medical his-
tory presented with fever and upper right quadrant pain. Clinical 
findings were consistent with acute calculous cholecystitis. A chol-
ecystectomy was performed.
Results: Grossly, the gallbladder wall was thick (0,7 cm), focally 
perforated, the mucosal surface was granular and brownish and the 
lumen contained one gallstone. On histology, ulcerated follicular 
cholecystitis and pericholecystitis were observed. In addition, 
eosinophilic amorphous depositions were observed in the lamina 
propria and the wall of small blood vessels. The amorphous 
material was diastase-PAS(+), blue in Masson trichrome and 
Congo Red(+) with mild apple-green birefringence under polarized 
light. Immunohistochemically it was positive for serum amyloid 
P-SAP(+) and negative for SAA(+).
Conclusion: Gallbladder amyloidosis is extremely rare, with fewer 
than 20 cases reported. It is suggested that ischemic damage and 
loss of wall contractility caused by amyloid deposition may be a 
significant driving factor for inflammation. If found incidentally in 
an otherwise healthy patient, as in our case, further examination is 
required to discover the underlying aetiology. In the present case, 
follow up information was scant but there was clinical suspicion of 
multiple myeloma, indicative of AL- amyloidosis.

Pancreatic cavernous haemangioma – a welcome diagnosis for 
a pancreatic mass
G. Fontinha*, J. Gama, R. Oliveira, M.R. Silva, M.A. Cipriano
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitario de Coimbra, Department of 
Pathology, Portugal
Background & objectives: Pancreatic haemangioma is a very rare 
entity with fewer than 30 cases reported in the English literature. It 
has an unspecific clinical presentation usually being asymptomatic or 
presenting with abdominal pain.
Methods: In this case report we present the case of a 73-year-
old male with inflammatory bowel disease with complaints of 
left abdominal flank pain. A CT-scan was performed showing a 
caudal pancreatic nodule. The lesion was hypodense with central 
hypervascularization raising the hypothesis of a neuroendrocrine 
neoplasia or an adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent a distal 
pancreatectomy and splenectomy.
Results: The gross examination showed a well circumscribed 
lesion with expansive growth. It was 6x4,3x3,9 cm and had a 
yellowish cut surface with haemorrhagic areas. Histology revealed 
a proliferation of dilated vascular spaces lined by typical endothe-
lium with multiple thrombi and recanalization areas. The lesion 
was encapsulated by a fibrous bland tissue. The remaining pancre-
atic parenchyma exhibited signs of chronic obstructive pancrea-
titis – severe fibrosis, acinar atrophy and Wirsung duct dilation. 
Twenty-two peripancreatic, perisplenic and celiac lymph nodes 
showed no tumour cells.
Conclusion: Although a rare entity in the pancreas cavernous hae-
mangioma is histologically similar to haemangiomas arising in 
other locations. Its diagnosis may be obscured by its rarity, but it 
should be a part of the differential diagnosis regarding hypervascu-
larizated lesions on CT-scan and entities with vascular differentia-
tion microscopically as it has a very favourable prognosis.

Pancreatoblastoma: a case report
A. Yavuz*, T. Kus, A. Alpsoy, Ö.C. Günizi, B. Unal, C.İ. 
Başsorgun, G.O. Elpek
*Akdeniz University Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Pancreatoblastoma(PB) is a rare 
malignancy of childhood. Although the primary treatment is surgical 
resection, a standardized chemotherapy/radiotherapy protocol does 
not yet exist. Herein presented a case of PB who underwent surgical 
resection to emphasize clinicopathological features in these rare 
tumours.
Methods: Pathological examination was performed by routine 
hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical staining.
Results: In a 6-year-old boy, post-traumatic abdominal imaging 
incidentally revealed a solid lesion in the body and tail of the pancreas. 
In addition, metastatic masses were detected in the retroperitoneum. 
Histopathological examination revealed a tumour tissue consisting 
of epithelial cells forming solid areas admixed with squamous 
epithelial cell islands consistent with PB. The patient was treated with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Carboplatin and Doxorubicin). In the 
resected specimen following regression of the tumour, solid epithelial 
areas observed in the pretreatment tumour biopsy were predominantly 
replaced by epithelial cells forming gland-like structures, and the 
number of squamous epithelial cell islands decreased. The patient did 
not experience any recurrence or metastasis (24 months).
Conclusion: The case presented here supports the findings that 
PB can be observed incidentally in young males on a non-syn-
dromic basis. Although further cases are required to conclude, it 
also emphasizes the beneficial effect of neoadjuvant therapy in 
PB treatment.

Rodríguez, B. Bellosillo, L. Visa Turmo, B. Lloveras
*Pathology Department, Hospital del Mar-Parc de Salut Mar, Bar-
celona, Spain
Background & objectives: Cholangiocarcinoma constitutes a hetero-
geneous group of malignant tumours originating in the biliary tree. 
The absence of an early diagnosis, intra-intertumoral variability, and 
chemoresistance, lead to a disappointing prognosis.
Methods: We present a 59-year-old male patient with a history of 
chronic hepatitis B with undetectable viral load. In 2017, a previ-
ously unknown lesion in segment VIII was diagnosed by imaging

tests. For this reason, an MRI with contrast was indicated, which 
showed a lesion radiologically compatible with a cholangiocarci-
noma. Therefore, a surgical resection was recommended in a mul-
tidisciplinary committee.
Results: The surgical specimen showed a hepatic parenchyma infil-
trated by glandular structures with a tubular pattern, composed of 
atypical cells immersed in a desmoplastic stroma. It showed posi-
tive staining for Q7, for low molecular weight (CAM5.2) and high 
weight (34Be12) keratins. Diagnosis was peripheral intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma.
Previously treated with first-line chemotherapy, in 2021 genetic 
variations on DNA and fusion genes on RNA were studied with the 
use of an expanded NGS panel. Mutations and amplifications on 
DNA results were negative, while results on RNA were not evalu-
able. Therefore, a liquid biopsy was performed, detecting fusions 
of FGFR2-TACC2. In this instance, the patient benefited from a 
newly targeted therapy: FGFR2 inhibitor, Pemigatinib.
Conclusion: Preservation and viability of the RNA is tough and 
decisive for appropriate/accurate analysis. Since FGFR2 partners 
are usually partially included in the commonly used NGS panels, 
plus the fact that the detection of fusion genes is technically hard, 
we conclude that this process is challenging. The role of liquid 
biopsy opens a new possibility to ensure the study of fresh material 
in order to improve the outcome of diagnosis.

A very rare tumour in gallbladder: coexistence of large cell 
neuroendocrine carcinoma and intracholecystic papillary 
neoplasm
E. Dicle Serbes*, S. Sevim, S. Tamam, S. Culcu, A.E. Unal, S. 
Kiremitci
*Ankara University Medical School, Pathology Department, 
Turkey
Background & objectives: Neuroendocrine carcinomas(NEC) 
of gallbladder account for 0.5% of all NECs, 4% of all gallbladder 
malignancies. Large tumours often extend into liver and/or metastasize. 
Herein, we report an extremely rare case of NEC involving liver and 
gallbladder, accompanying intracholecystic papillary neoplasm(ICPN).
Methods: We report a 62-year-old male patient presented with 
jaundice and abnormal liver tests. A solid mass involving liver and 
gallbladder was detected radiologically. PET/CT scan revealed also 
lung and skin metastases besides liver mass (SUVmax=16.3). His 
past medical history and physical examination was otherwise non-
specific. Partial hepatectomy with cholecystectomy was performed.
Results: Grossly, a tumoral mass with the largest diameter of 13.5 
cm, extending between gallbladder and liver parenchyma was 
detected. A polypoid lesion in the mucosa was residing next to the 
tumour that was protruding into lumen. Histopathologically, main 
mass had solid-trabecular pattern, and composed of large atypical 
epitheloid cells with hyperchromatic irregularly-shaped nuclei, 
prominent nucleoli and granular cytoplasm. Geographic necrosis 
and frequent atypical mitotic figures were striking(21/10HPF). 
Tumour diffusely expressed synaptophysin and chromogranin 
with very high Ki67 staining(90%). Besides, mucosal polypoid 
lesion revealed a tubulopapillary growth exhibiting high-grade 
cytologic atypia. The main mass and the concomitant lesion were 
diagnosed as large cell NEC and ICPN with high-grade intraepi-
thelial neoplasm.
Conclusion: There are few publications in literature reporting 
NECs originating from gallbladder/biliary duct. However, another 
rare pathology, ICPN, was reported to have an increased associa-
tion with NECs of gallbladder. In our case, though the tumour 
bulk of NEC was in the liver, presence of ICPN in close proximity 
with the tumour mass in the gallbladder raised a suspicion that the 
tumour may have originated from gallbladder. We thought the type 
of concurrence in our case is worthy of attention.

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas in children: 
two cases of a rare entity
C. Mora*, F. Santos, R. Fonseca
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Instituto Português de Oncologia 
de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Lisbon, Portugal
Background & objectives: Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) 
is a low-grade malignant tumour with a predilection for adolescent 
girls and young women. Although rare, it accounts for 60 to 70% of all 
paediatric pancreatic tumours, and usually has an excellent prognosis 
after surgical resection.
Methods: Herein, we report the clinicopathological features of 
two cases of solid pseudopapillary neoplasm, along with a brief 
review of the literature.
Results: Case 1 refers to a 13-year-old boy with a pancreatic head 
tumour and case 2 to a 14-year-old girl with a pancreatic uncinate 
process tumour, both presenting with abdominal pain. Cephalic 
duodenopancreatectomy was performed after a presumptive diag-
nosis and confirmatory cytology, respectively. Grossly, tumours 
were 9cm and 3,6cm, well-demarcated, haemorrhagic, with solid 
and cystic areas. Microscopically, they were composed of poorly 
cohesive epithelial cells forming solid and pseudopapillary struc-
tures, positive for β-catenin(nuclear), CD10, progesterone recep-
tors and negative for chromogranin. No lymph node or distant 
metastasis were identified. Patient 1 is alive and disease-free for 6 
months. Patient 2 developed a Wirsung duct stenosis, is alive and 
disease-free for 4 years.
Conclusion: SPN is a rare low-grade malignancy often found inci-
dentally or presenting with unspecific abdominal discomfort or 
pain. Awareness for this entity in the paediatric population and in 
males, along with the recognition of its morphological and immu-
nophenotypical features are essential to confirm the diagnosis. As 
in the adult population, an excellent prognosis solely with surgery 
is described for paediatric patients, even in the presence of meta-
static disease.

Erdamar, İ. Yilmaz, V. Adsay, N. Dursun Kepkep
*Basaksehir Cam and Sakura City Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothe-
lioma (HEHE) is a malignant vascular tumour of the liver. There are 
2 subtypes, conventional variant with WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion 
and recently characterized variant with YAP1-TFE3 fusion which is 
extremely rare.
Methods: We report two cases of HEHE which have striking 
morphologic features consistent with so-called YAP1-TFE3 
fusion subtype, nuclear TFE3 expression and negative CAMTA-1 
reactivity on immunohistochemistry. A 66 years old male and a 
26 years old female with hepatic masses which were confirmed as 
HEHE on trucut biopsy.
Results: Both patients have been treated with liver transplantation. 
Histological examination of the liver explant materials confirmed 
the presence of HEHE. Both had the unique histological features of

YAP1-TFE3 fused subtype. Immunohistochemistry also supported 
the YAP1-TFE3 fused variant, by CAMTA1 negativity and TFE3 
positivity. First case had metastatic lesions on the C2-C3 vertebral 
level and multiple lesions on the liver in the MRI after 2 years of 
follow-up. The hepatic lesions were confirmed as HEHE by biopsy. 
He received medical oncological therapy. Two and a half years 
after the transplantation patient died of hepatic failure. Second case 
has no distant metastasis or recurrence after 3 months of follow-up.
Conclusion: Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma with 
YAP1-TFE3 fusion is an extremely rare, recently described malig-
nant vascular tumour. Awareness of this variant’s morphologic 
features are important during differential diagnosis and to avoid 
misclassification.

Adenomyoma of the ampullary region: a malignancy mimicker
S. Frini*, S. Mestiri, O. Belkacem, A. Bdioui, A. Baccouche, S. 
Hmissa
*Pathology Department, Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Adenomyoma and adenomyomatous 
hyperplasia in the gastrointestinal tract are commonly benign lesions, 
usually found in gallbladder. Rarely, they occur in the ampullary region 
and cause serious complications. Herein, we describe the clinico-
pathological features of an adenomyoma of the Vater’s ampulla.
Methods: A 61-year-old woman presented with obstructive 
jaundice and mild abdominal pain. Blood tests showed conjugated 
hyperbilirubinemia. Duodenoscopy revealed a bulging ampulla 
with normal overlaying mucosa. Radiological examinations 
reported no further extension. Endoscopic biopsy was inconclusive 
and couldn’t exclude malignancy. Seeing it was symptomatic and 
suspicious of malignancy, a cephalic pancreaticoduodenectomy was 
performed with uneventful post-operative course and follow-up.
Results: Gross examination showed a 6mm, white, firm lesion of 
the ampullary wall. Histologically, it consisted of an admixture of 
benign epithelial and mesenchymal elements: proliferating benign 
glands of various size lined by columnar cells and separated by 
disorganized fibromuscular tissue. The overlying mucosa was unre-
markable. Peripancreatic, hepatic pedicle’s and superior mesentery 
lymph nodes were free of tumour. The gallbladder, which was con-
veyed with the surgical specimen, displayed chronic cholecystitis.
Conclusion: Since the vast majority of ampullary adenomyomas 
present suspicious symptoms and mimic malignant tumours, 
its preliminary diagnosis could be very challenging. Due to the 
serious clinical implications of over-treating a benign lesion; a 
careful endoscopic, radiological and pathological assessment are 
mandatory in order to ensure an accurate pre-operative diagnosis, 
especially that these screening modalities are nowadays, more 
accurate to fulfill this purpose.

Liver solitary fibrous tumour with simple biliary cyst: a radio-
logical and histological diagnostic challenge
N. Ahmed, F. Falcinelli, F. Ratti, M. Colombo, C. Doglioni, F. 
Pedica*
*Pathology Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute-Vita-
Salute San Raffaele University, Italy
Background & objectives: Primitive solitary fibrous tumour of 
the liver is an extremely rare mesenchymal tumour with uncertain 
biological behaviour, only a few cases reported in the literature, no 
definite criteria of malignancy and whose preoperative diagnosis 
can be very challenging.
Methods: We report the case of a 68-year-old man who presented 
with dyspepsia and had no history of previous neoplastic disease. 
Ultrasound, MRI and CT scan showed a mass forming lesion of 
10 x 7,5 x 9,5 cm, partially cystic with a solid component of 5 x 6 
cm, involving the IV hepatic segment, vascularized from the left 
hepatic artery.
Results: At gross examination, a left hepatectomy showed 
a 11 x 8 x 10 cm neoplasm, mostly solid with a cystic part 
not communicating with the biliary tree. At microscopy, the 
solid part was made of storiform spindle cells organised in 
bundles, with focal myxoid and fibrotic changes, involving 
the peribiliary tissue, sparing the porto-biliary peduncle; 
focal ischaemic necrosis occurred. The cyst was covered by a 
biliary epithelium with pseudopyloric metaplasia. Neoplastic 
cells were strongly and diffusely immunoreactive for CD34, 
STAT6 and BCL2, negative for S100, CD117, DOG1, ERG, 
PR, inhibin, calretinin and WT1. The mitotic count was 4 
mitoses/10 HPF and Ki67 was 15%. Lymph nodes were free 
of neoplasia.
Conclusion: A diagnosis of primary hepatic solitary fibrous 
tumour adjacent to a simple biliary hepatic cyst was provided. No 
similar cases are reported in the literature. Since it is a very rare 
primitive liver neoplasm, no criteria are available for prognosis 
and therapy. We decided to apply the score proposed by Demicco 
and Colleagues (Modern Pathology 2017; 30,1433–1442) and the 
neoplasm was considered as an" intermediate risk" lesion. The 
patient is currently free of neoplasia, undergoing close follow up.

Invasive adenocarcinoma arising from an intraductal papillary 
mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas: a case report
Y. Fejji*, S. Mestiri, A. Baccouche, S. Frini, S. Hmissa
*Department of pathology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, 
Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms 
(IPMNs) are mucin-producing cystic lesions that involve the pancreatic 
ductal system. A subset of IPMNs will progress to invasive carcinoma. 
This study aims to present a case of malignant transformation of an 
IPMN to better understand this entity
Methods: We report a case of a 60-year-old female without past 
medical history who presented with signs of mixed pancreatic 
insufficiency: recent diabetes and steatorrhea associated with 
weight loss and anorexia. The radiological exploration concluded 
with a tissular lesion of the head of the pancreas with dilatation 
of the main and secondary pancreatic ducts. The patient under-
went a cephalic pancreaticoduodenectomy.
Results: On gross examination, serial sectioning showed an 
ill-limited whitish mass with a myxoid change, reaching the 
duodenum without infiltrating it. The tumour measured 8,5x 
6,5cm. The Wirsung duct was dilated, containing a friable 
whitish material. Histology examination showed intestinal-
type IPMN that involves both the main and the secondary 
ducts. The tumour contained also foci of invasive adeno-
carcinoma, which were also found in the surgical sections, 
Lesions of chronic atrophic autoimmune pancreatitis were 
also found. The patient underwent a totalisation of its pan-
createctomy and adjuvant chemotherapy was also indicated.
Conclusion: IPMNs are rare and are characterized by a risk of 
malignant transformation. Histologically, IPMNs are divided 
into three subtypes: intestinal, gastric, and pancreaticobiliary. 
IPMNs can occur anywhere in the main pancreatic duct and/or

its branches. Clinical symptoms include chronic pancreatitis, 
weight loss, diabetes mellitus, and jaundice. The differential 
diagnoses of IPMNs include other pancreatic intraductal 
neoplasms, mucinous cystic neoplasms, and retention cysts. 
IPMNs without an invasive carcinoma are often curable. The 
prognosis for IPMNs with invasive carcinoma is significantly 
worse

Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver (UESL), aris-
ing in mesenchymal hamartoma: report of two adult cases
N.R. Halepliler*, Z.B. Erdem, İ.M. Abdullahi, H. Kalaça, B. 
Yılmaz Özgüven, N. Dursun Kepkep
*Basaksehir Cam ve Sakura City Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Embryonal sarcoma of the liver is a 
malignant neoplasm, composed of heterogeneous undifferentiated 
mesenchymal cells. About 50% of cases occur in children between 6 
and 10 years of age and rarely occurs in adults. It occasionally arises 
in mesenchymal hamartoma.
Methods: CASE 1:19-years-old male presented with abdominal 
pain and weight loss. Examinations revealed elevated liver enzymes 
and a cystic liver mass measuring 14 cm. CASE 2:33-years-old 
male patient with a history of surgery for hydatid cyst of liver one 
year ago, presented with recurrence of complaints. Imaging studies 
showed heterogeneously contrasting, lobulated solid 16 cm tumour 
on the right liver lobe.
Results: Right hepatectomy was performed on both patients. On 
gross examination: first patient had 13.5x9x8.5 cm solid & mul-
ticystic, partly oedematous tumoral lesion; second patient had 
16.5x9.5x13 cm solid, lobulated tumour with extensive necrosis. 
On histopathologic examination, cellular component was composed 
of medium to large spindled or stellate cells with marked nuclear 
pleomorphism. Occasional PAS positive eosinophilic hyaline glob-
ules were seen. With extensive sampling and serial sections, focal 
areas compatible with mesenchymal hamartoma were found in both 
tumours. Immunohistochemically, tumour cells were vimentin, 
CD56, BCL2, pancytokeratin and alpha-1-antitrypsin positive. As a 
result of morphological and histopathological findings, both cases 
were reported as "Undifferentiated Embryonal Sarcoma associated 
with mesenchymal hamartoma”.
Conclusion: UESL is a challenging diagnosis. Due to the rar-
ity of UESL in adults, these patients are often misdiagnosed as 
hepatic abscess, haemorrhagic cystic tumour, or hydatid cyst, 
as in the second case. It should always be included in the dif-
ferential diagnoses of large liver masses, regardless of patient 
age. In addition, sampling and microscopic examination are very 
important as it can be associated with mesenchymal hamartoma.

Case report: secondary paraneoplastic hyperparathyroidism 
with brown tumour of the femur
D. Proca*
*Temple University, USA
Background & objectives: The diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumour 
(NET) has serious implications concerning treatment and prognosis. In 
addition, paraneoplastic hyperthyroidism should always be considered 
in the differential diagnosis in a severely symptomatic patient with no 
evidence of abnormality in the parathyroid glands.
Methods: We describe a 39-year-old female with 2 weeks right 
leg pain preventing her from ambulating; on imaging she had a 
10 cm lytic lesion of femur and associated pathologic fracture. 
The patient presented with a 6 month-long history of nausea, 
vomiting, and weight loss. At admission, she endorsed signifi-
cant polyuria, polydipsia, chronic abdominal pain, constipation, 
reflux and notable memory difficulties.
Results: Lab investigations showed hypercalcemia (13.1 mg/
dl) and extremely elevated PTH (>2000 pg/ml). The differen-
tial diagnosis included primary hyperparathyroidism, parathy-
roid carcinoma, or ectopic PTH production. Additional imaging 
studies revealed a large lytic lesion in the femoral metaphysis 
and a well-circumscribed homogenous nodule in the right lower 
lobe. A lung biopsy was done and showed a well-differentiated 
neuroendocrine neoplasm, while a bone biopsy was suggestive 
of brown tumour. The profile suggested a well differentiated 
neuroendocrine tumour, grade 2 (4.0 cm greatest dimension) with 
focal necrosis. The histology and immunohistochemical features 
were consistent with atypical carcinoid, which was focally posi-
tive with Chromogranin, Synaptophysin and CD56.
Conclusion: Actively hormone secreting NET have been 
described in the literature, but NET secreting PTH and 
causing secondary hyperparathyroidism with brown tumour 
of long bones are very rare; some of the more common 
paraneoplastic syndromes seen in lung tumours, especially in 
small cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas, are: hypercalcemia, 
inappropriate ADH secretion, hyponatremia, ectopic Cushing’s 
syndrome, carcinoid syndrome, hypoglycemia. This is a rare and 
interesting case that required a multidisciplinary approach and 
illustrated the importance of correlating laboratory with imaging 
and histology,

Reclassification of papillary microcarcinoma (PMC) accord-
ing to the “Porto proposal” criteria
A. Dhaoui*, S. Ben Rejeb, D. Aloui, M. Aloui, A. Hachicha, H. 
Chouchen, S. Turki
*Forces de securité interieure, Tunisia
Background & objectives: PMC is a variant of papillary carcinoma 
that measures≤1cm with an excellent prognosis.Recently, a proposal 
has been advanced to use the designation of papillary mirotumour 
(pMT) for PMCs with no risk factors. In this study, we aimed to reclas-
sify pMCs according to the Porto-proposal (Pp)criteria.
Methods: We have retrospectively collected 29 cases of PMC 
diagnosed in our pathology department (2012-2022). Clinical and 
pathological parameters have been retrieved from pathological 
reports. They included: age, sex, discovery circumstance, loca-
tion, size, subtype, presence of psammomas, presence of tumour 
capsule, tumour capsule invasion, angioinvasion, extension to 
thyroid pseudo-capsule, multifocality, other concurrent thyroid 
pathology and state of the patient. We have evaluated and reclas-
sified all cases following the Pp. We have briefly compared the 
clinical outcomes in both groups.
Results: Mean age of patients was 46, 6-years-old (17-67) with 
a female predominance (sex ratio=2,2) .23 cases of PMC were 
incidentally discovered during lobectomy for benign conditions 
(9 cases), for PC of the ipsilateral or contralateral lobe (14 
cases). In 6 cases, TIRADSV-thyroid nodule was discovered 
during ultrasound-imaging. The mean size of the tumour was 
5,2mm. Multifocality was observed in 5 cases. The histological 
variant was follicular(25cases), conventional papillary(3cases) 
and tall cell (one case). A tumour capsule was present in 7cases 
and showed features of invasion in 4cases.Minimal thyroid

capsule invasion was found in 5 cases. In one case, vascular 
invasion was reported. A total of 17cases could be classified 
as pMT according to the Pp. One patient developed pulmonary 
metastasis and local recurrence.
Conclusion: Although the use of the term of pMT could reduce the 
psychological stress among patients and clinicians, it doesn’t seem 
to be of high interest in cases of concurrent ipsi or contralteral 
invasive papillary carcinoma since the patient’s prognosis is that 
of the invasive tumour. Further studies with large sample size and 
molecular analysis are also needed in order to definitively validate 
and generalize the use of Porto proposal.

Utility of intraoperative frozen section analysis on Bethesda 
category III-IV-V thyroid nodules and the effect of concurrent 
imprint cytology
E. Hacihasanoglu*, F. Ozkan
*Yeditepe University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Bethesda category III-IV-V thyroid 
nodules represent therapeutic difficulty. This study aims to determine 
the utility of frozen section analysis (FS) on Bethesda category III-
IV-V thyroid nodules and to investigate the effect of concurrent imprint 
cytology on diagnostic performance of FS.
Methods: FS results and final diagnostic reports of all patients 
with Bethesda category III-IV-V nodule who underwent partial 
thyroidectomy or nodule resection with FS were scanned from 
hospital electronical database. Demographic information, size of 
the nodule and presence of concurrent imprint cytology were noted.
Results: There were 81 patients fulfilling the criteria, with mean 
age of 43,5 years, female/male ratio of 3,2:1 and mean nodule size 
of 21 mm. In 20 cases, concurrent imprint cytology was performed 
and evaluated during FS. The overall sensitivity, specificity, 
positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value 
(NPV) of FS was 71,4%, 95%, 83,3% and 90,4%, respectively, with 
a diagnostic accuracy of 88,8%. When cases were separated as 
those with and without concurrent imprint cytology; sensitivity, 
specificity, PPV and NPV of FS with imprint cytology were 80%, 
93,3%, 80% and 93,3%, respectively. For FS without imprint 
cytology; sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 68,7%, 95%, 
83,3% and 90,4%, respectively.
Conclusion: Bethesda category III-IV-V nodules have variable 
rates of malignancy and low concordance among pathologists, 
which causes difficulties in follow-up and treatment decisions. Use 
of FS is thought as a way to eliminate these difficulties. Overall, FS 
has low sensitivity for detecting malignancy in Bethesda category 
III-IV-V nodules. However, concurrent imprint cytology could 
help to increase the ability of FS to correctly identify malignancy. 
Larger studies regarding this aspect are needed.

Update regarding the role of PD-L1 in oncocytic thyroid lesions 
on cytological samples

tolo, V. Fiorentino, A. Pontecorvi, M. Raffaelli, L.M. Larocca, 
E.D. Rossi
*Division of Anatomic Pathology and Histology - Fondazione 
Policlinico Universitario“Agostino Gemelli”-IRCCS, Rome, Italy
Background & objectives: Few articles demonstrated a correlation 
between PD-L1 and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) on thyroid fine 
needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Its role in oncocytic thyroid lesions 
remains controversial, therefore we examined PD-L1 immunostaining 
in liquid-based cytology (LBC) of these lesions.
Methods: From January 2019 to March 2021, 114 thyroid lesions 
diagnosed by FNAC as lesions with a predominant oncocytic com-
ponent, were evaluated with PD-L1 immunostaining on both LBC 
and histology samples. FNAC cohort included 51 benign (B, negative 
controls), 4 Atypia of undetermined significance/Follicular lesions of 
undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS), 57 follicular lesions (FN/
SFN), and 2 suspicious for malignancy (SFM) cases.
Results: Fifty-four cases (11B, 2 AUS/FLUS, 39 FN/SFN 
and 2 SFM) had histological follow-up: 1B case resulted as 
an oxyphilic nodule in Hashimoto Thyroiditis (HT), 10 B as 
goiters, 2 AUS/FLUSs as oncocytic adenomas (OAs); 39 FN/
SFNs included 27 OAs, 4 FA, and 8 oncocytic carcinoma 
(OC). The 2 SFMs were diagnosed as OAs. Increased plasma 
membrane and cytoplasmic PD-L1 expression were found in 
47 LBC cases (41.2%). Among the histological series, 67.3% 
of OAs and 75 % of OC had PD-L1 expression, whilst nega-
tive PD-L1 was found in oncocytic cells in HT. A positivity 
in >30% of the neoplastic cells was found in 72.9% of the 
cases including six OC.
Conclusion: These data suggest that PD-L1 is expressed in onco-
cytic thyroid lesions. While weak PD-L1 expression failed to dis-
criminate benign from malignant lesions, OC demonstrated more 
intense cytoplasmic and membranous expression.

Papillary carcinoma of thyroid gland with CA 19-9 positivity. 
A case report
E. Koniaris*, A. Mellou, E. Mortakis, M. Martzikou, G. Kafiri
*Pathology department, General hospital of Athens "Hippokratio", 
Greece
Background & objectives: Elevated levels of carbohydrate antigen 
19-9 (CA 19-9), serologically and immunohistochemically, usually pre-
sent with worse outcome and prognosis, especially in malignant cases. 
Usually, elevated levels of CA 19-9 have been associated mainly with 
malignancy and with medullary thyroid carcinomas.
Methods: A 74-year-old female patient, presented with mul-
tiple suspicious thyroid nodules measuring 0.5-6 cm, in both 
lobes. Microscopically the nodules were multiple foci of 
papillary carcinoma, sclerotic and oxyphil type, with severe 
perithyroidal extension, necrosis, perineural infiltration and 
calcifications. Two lymph nodes had metastases from the 
carcinoma.
Results: Serological exams showed that the patient had increased 
levels of CA 19-9, thus indicating related immunohistochemical 
expression on the lesion. On IHC, it was confirmed a diffuse and 
widespread stain of CA 19-9 was confirmed. The lesions were also 
developed on the background of severe autoimmune thyroiditis.
Conclusion: CA 19-9 might be of importance in predicting 
the prognostic outcome of a thyroid lesion, either benign 
(e.g., thyroiditis, Hashimoto thyroiditis and Graves disease) 
or malignant (e.g., papillary carcinoma). More specifically, 
increased expression of this antibody has been shown to 
demonstrate higher mortality rate than the control group. 
Some studies have correlated this phenotype with the tumour 
size, multifocality, local and distant metastasis and also RET 
mutation.

Romania
Background & objectives: Thyroid carcinomas are the most common 
endocrine tumours malignancies. Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) 
and Hurthle (oncocytic) cell carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 15% of 
cases. The aim of this study was to identify the differences between 
the two entities.
Methods: The retrospective study comprised 56 consecutive cases 
of FTC (40 cases) and HCC (16 cases) was investigated during 
2007-2020. All cases were reviewed by three independent patholo-
gists in order to establish the histological variant and to reassess 
the main characteristics. Statistical correlations between FTC 
and HCC and various clinicopathological parameters were also 
performed.
Results: FTC presented: age (mean 52); female 75%; size 
8-93 mm; minimally invasive (33 cases), widely invasive (5 
cases), encapsulated angioinvasive (2 cases); collision tumour 
(8 cases); capsule invasion (13 cases); extrathyroidal extension 
(4 cases); lymph node metastasis (2 cases), lymphovascular 
invasion (30 cases), relapse (1 case); tumour stage T2-T4 
(34 cases). HCC presented: age (mean 57); female 87.50%; 
size 21-80 mm; collision tumour (3 cases); capsule invasion 
(2 cases); extrathyroidal extension (1 case); lymph node 
metastasis (2 cases); lymphovascular invasion (15 cases); 
tumour stage T2-T4 (13 cases). All cases presented unilateral 
involvement and associated thyroid pathology. Significant 
differences were noted between FTC and HCC only with 
lymphovascular invasion (p= 0.038).
Conclusion: In thyroid carcinoma with follicular architecture, FTC 
versus HCC, parameter of aggression determined only by lymph-
vascular invasion, date obtained with statistically significant dif-
ferences (p=0.038), in relation to the other classical clinicopatho-
logical features. As evidenced by the cases we present, HCC are 
tumours with aggressive clinical behaviour and high metastasis 
potential, compering to FTC.

Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma, an unusual tumour in 
young patients. Report of two cases

*Histology Department, UMFST G.E. Palade Tg. Mureș, Romania
Background & objectives: Poorly differentiated thyroid cancer 
(PDTC) is a rare aggressive thyroid malignancy with a unique feature 
in morphology and behaviour. In young individuals it is a very unusual 
observation and its clinical feature, genetic mechanism and outcome 
is poorly understood.
Methods: In this study we report two cases of PDTC in a 31- and 
34-year-old patients. Both patients were admitted to the surgical 
department of Mures County Emergency Hospital with a Bethesda 
5, suspicious for malignancy thyroid cytology. A total thyroid-
ectomy was performed and the specimens were analysed in the 
Pathology Department.
Results: On microscopic examination both tumours were 
encapsulated and had an insular, trabecular and/or solid tumour 
growth. One of the tumours, of 54 mm, had angioinvasion. Both 
cases met the Turin criteria for PDTC diagnosis: tumour cells 
were small, monotonous, with few cytoplasm and convoluted 
nuclei. Both tumours displayed necrosis and more than 5 
mitoses per 10 HPF. No features of differentiated thyroid 
carcinoma were noticed. In one of the tumour, intermingled 
with the monotonous cells, pleomorphic giant tumour cells 
with bizarre features were noticed. In immunohistochemistry 
these cells expressed Cytokeratin, Thyroglobulin, TTF-1 and 
PAX 8, proving their follicular origin, and also their non-
anaplastic character.
Conclusion: We should always keep in mind that PDTC may occur 
in young individuals. Its association with pleomorphic tumour giant 
cells do not always represent tumour dedifferentiation. As PDTC 
accounts for most fatalities from non-anaplastic thyroid cancers, 
a correct diagnosis is important for clinicians and oncologists to 
predict the prognosis.

Pituitary neuroendocrine tumours and non-neoplastic adeno-
hypophysis arising in ovarian teratomas: a likely under-recog-
nised phenomenon
A. Hodgson*, S. Ahmad Thiryayi, O. Mete
*Toronto General Hospital, Canada
Background & objectives: Recently, our group has identified and 
comprehensively characterized both non-neoplastic adenohypophysis 
and pituitary neuroendocrine tumours (PitNETs) occurring in ovarian 
teratomas. Our objective is to highlight the role of histochemical and 
immunohistochemical tools in recognizing and properly classifying 
these proliferations.
Methods: PitNETs and non-neoplastic adenohypophysis arising in 
ovarian teratomas were identified from our institutional records. 
Adenohypophyseal tissues were assessed using reticulin histochem-
istry and immunohistochemical biomarkers (pituitary transcription 
factors including PIT1, TPIT, SF1, ER-alpha, GATA3, adenohypo-
physeal hormones, alpha-subunit, CAM5.2, S100 and MIB1). All 
included cases were reviewed by both endocrine and gynecologic 
pathologists. Demographic and clinicopathologic information was 
recorded for each case.
Results: One of five teratomas was immature. Three PitNETs and 
two non-tumorous adenohypophyseal proliferations were identified 
(median patient age 26 years; range 16-67). The PitNETs were all 
of PIT1-lineage: 2 sparsely granulated lactotroph tumours (0.15 
and 0.4 cm) and 1 mixed sparsely granulated lactotroph and densely 
granulated somatotroph tumour (0.15 cm). The MIB1 labelling 
index (LI) ranged from < 1% to 1.5%. Unlike the PitNETs, the 
two cases of non-tumourous adenohypophysis were composed of 
admixed PIT1, TPIT and SF1-lineage cells with a MIB1 LI < 1%, 
demonstrated interspersed S100-positive folliculostellate cells and 
showed no reticulin disruption.
Conclusion: Both non-neoplastic adenohypophysis and PitNETs 
occur in ovarian teratomas and may be mistaken for other neu-
roendocrine neoplasms. Reticulin histochemistry and immunohis-
tochemical biomarkers are required to confirm adenohypophyseal 
cell origin, distinguish nontumourous elements from PitNETs, and 
subtype and prognosticate PitNETs, if applicable. Further epide-
miological studies are needed to determine the prevalence of Pit-
NETs and non-tumourous adenohypophysis in ovarian teratomas.

Background & objectives: Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma 
(PDTC) is a rare tumour type originating in the thyroid follicular cells. 
The presence of pleomorphic tumour giant cells in PDTC is always 
worrisome for the pathologist as they usually refer to anaplastic 
carcinoma.
Methods: We report the case of a 31-year-old female admitted to 
the hospital for a right thyroid macronodule, suspicion for follicular 
neoplasm in cytology. Total thyroidectomy was performed and the 
specimen was sent to the Pathology Department.
Results: On macroscopy, the left right lobe was almost entirely 
replaced by a whitish nodule of 54 mm. On microscopy, the nodule 
was surrounded by an irregular capsule, with suspicion of vascular 
invasion. The nodule was solid with large tumour nests/islands, 
separated by thin, fibrous septa. Small foci of endocrine-type 
necrosis were also present. The tumour was composed of monoto-
nous tumour cells, with round-ovalar centrally placed nuclei, with 
prominent nucleoli. But focally pleomorphic giant cells with an 
abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and large, irregular, sometimes 
frankly monstrous nuclei were seen. The mitotic index was 6 
mitosis/10HPF. On immunohistochemistry the tumour cells and the 
pleomorphic giant cells expressed both thyroglobulin and TTF-1.
Conclusion: The immunohistochemical profile of the pleomorphic 
giant cells indicates not only their follicular origin but above all their 
differentiated nature. This case shows that pleomorphic tumour giant 
cells arising in PDTC do not always represent dedifferentiation and 
progression to anaplastic carcinoma. Distinction among these processes 
is critical as their treatment and prognosis are very different.

Gamna-Gandy bodies: a rare finding in a papillary thyroid 
carcinoma
J. Almeida*, A. Costa Braga
*Department of Anatomic Pathology, Centro Hospitalar Universi-
tário de São João, Portugal
Background & objectives: Gamna-Gandy bodies (GGB) are fibrous 
tissue coated by iron and calcium with unusual articulated and bamboo-
like fibres. GGB are currently thought to be caused by minor haemor-
rhages, mostly in spleen and atrial myxomas, rarely reported in other 
locations.
Methods: A 46-year-old woman displaying multinodular goiter 
and primary hyperparathyroidism, underwent total thyroidectomy 
and parathyroidectomy. Gross and histological examination were 
performed, including additional histochemical techniques – Perls 
and Von Kossa (VK) stains.
Results: We report a case of a multifocal Papillary Thyroid Carci-
noma (PTC), measuring 32mm in its largest dimension, in a back-
ground of a nodular hyperplasia. Sclerotic areas with mycelia-like 
appearance were found within the PTC. Perls and VK highlighted 
the iron and calcium encrusted fibres, compatible with GGB. So 
far, only rare cases of thyroid GGB have been reported, all of them 
associated with follicular adenomas and nodular hyperplasia, none 
associated with PTC. It is unknown if the coexistence of nodular 
hyperplasia has contributed to GGB formation in this case. The 
patient underwent radioiodine ablation and is alive with no evi-
dence of disease 17 months after the surgery.
Conclusion: Knowing that the thyroid is a richly vascularized organ 
and that the haemorrhage process is the origin of GGB formation, it 
would be expected more cases of thyroidal GGB. Perhaps a low interest 
in GGB justifies the scarcity of this entity. With this case we intend to 
underline the importance of reporting GGB and carry out the review 
of cases of neoplasms associated with GGB, especially in thyroid, in 
an attempt to clarify their meaning and potential impact.

Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma - tall cell variant arising in 
mature cystic teratoma of the ovary - a case report
S. Al Bashir*, M. Alorjani, I. Matalka, M. Alfaqih, N. Obeidat
*King Abdullah University Hospital, Jordan University of Science 
and Technology, Jordan
Background & objectives: Presence of malignancies in somatic parts 
of mature cystic teratoma (MCT) of the ovary is rare. We present a case 
of tall cell variant (TCV) of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PMC) 
arising in MCT of the ovary.
Methods: A 31-year-old female patient presented with a left ovar-
ian cyst which on ultrasound scan showed measured 5.0 × 5.0 cm 
and was likely MCT. Laparotomy with cystectomy was performed. 
Grossly, it was an intact unilocular cyst with smooth surface, filled 
with tufts of hair and sebum (0.1 cm thick) with only small thick-
ened area (1.0 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm).
Results: Microscopically, the cyst wall was lined by stratified 
squamous epithelium and contained mature tissues (skin, 
appendages, respiratory epithelium, cartilage and thyroid tissue). 
In the thickened area, there was a small focus of thyroid tissue; 
within which PMC (0.6 cm) was noted, composed of trabeculae 
and follicles of tall cells.
Diagnosis: PMC-TCV, arising from a small focus of thyroid tissue 
in MCT with maximum tumour size of 0.6 cm. The patient under-
went US scan of the thyroid gland and computed tomography scan 
of the neck and chest with no clinical evidence of tumour metasta-
sis. The patient has been on follow-up with for 4 years post-surgery 
with uneventful recurrence-free clinical course.
Conclusion: Our case is a PMC diagnosed in a small focus of thy-
roid tissue within MCT (not meeting diagnostic criteria for struma 
ovarii), different from two previously reported cases of PTC in 
struma ovarii. To our knowledge, this is the first case of PMC-TCV 
arising in MCT with conservative surgery. Such treatment modality 
may be an alternative to previously suggested more radical options. 
However, standardization of treatment protocols requires immedi-
ate reporting of secondary malignancies in MCTs and referral to 
large databases.

Core-needle biopsy in the diagnosis of thyroid lesions - risky or 
diagnostically helpful?

*Department of Pathology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National 
Research Institute of Oncology; MSCNRIO, Poland
Background & objectives: Diagnosis of thyroid tumours is routinely 
based on an ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). 
In some cases, however, FNAB fails and CNB may be an alternative 
diagnostic tool.
Methods: The study was conducted over a period of 4 years, 2019-
2022. Twenty-seven patients with thyroid tumours larger than 2cm, 
suspicion of malignancy and insufficient repeated FNAB, under-
went CNBs of the thyroid at NIO-PIB in Warsaw.
Results: Diagnostic material was obtained in 24 patients, in 
remaining 3 cases CNB was performed twice to obtain material 
sufficient for microscopic examination, immunohistochemical and 
molecular tests (NGS). For one patient with suspicious Hodgkin 
lymphoma the final diagnosis required a surgical biopsy of the 
lymph node. There were 5 anaplastic carcinomas, 2 poorly differ-
entiated carcinomas, 1 medullary carcinoma, 1 PTC, 5 metastatic 
carcinomas (2 SCC, RCC, HCC, mucoepidermoid carcinoma) 3

lymphomas, 5 follicular tumours, 1 sarcoma, 1 NUT carcinoma 
(with NSD3-NUTM1 fusion), 1 deep fibrohistiocytoma, 2 inflam-
matory lesions. Hematoma at the biopsy site was observed in two 
patients and the cancer cells seeding along the needle tract in one 
patient.
Conclusion: CNB of the thyroid lesions according to strictly 
defined indications in a hospital setting allows a confident diag-
nosis with a low risk of complications in cases of failure of a 
FNAB. This method can be particularly useful for the diagnosis of 
anaplastic/poorly differentiated and metastatic carcinomas.

Predominantly necrotic but follicle-preserving pattern of 
a rectal cancer metastasis causing misinterpretation of 
cytological image from fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a 
thyroid tumour
M. Biskup-Fruzynska*, E. Chmielik
*Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, 
Gliwice Branch, Poland
Background & objectives: Metastases to thyroid are uncommon, 
accounting for 1,4-3% of thyroid neoplasms. In a 68-year-old woman 
with rectal cancer in stage T3bN2Mx a PET/CT scan revealed a thyroid 
tumour in the right lobe, suggestive of a synchronous neoplasm with 
nodal metastases.
Methods: The ultrasound suggested a malignant tumour (22x18x30 
mm; EU-TIRADS 5). FNAB showed numerous sheets of atypical 
epithelial cells without obvious differentiation in an abundant 
necrotic debris. PAX-8 positivity in a few cells was interpreted 
as confirming thyroid origin of the lesion. Anaplastic thyroid 
carcinoma, TBS VI was reported. A similar cytological picture 
was seen in FNABs from neck lymph nodes.
Results: Total thyroidectomy with lateral neck dissection 
was performed. On HE slides the tumour presented evidently 
glandular, with large, centrally necrotic cribriform and smaller 
tubular structures, as well as less differentiated single cells in 
a desmoplastic stroma, with normal thyroid follicles preserved 
in between. Necrosis constituted about 70% of the tumour. The 
tumour cells were positive for: CDX-2, SATB2 and CK20, and 
negative for TG, TTF-1 and PAX-8, with Ki67 index about 60%. 
There was angioinvasion and extrathyroidal extension with R1 
margins, and additional small metastatic foci found in the left lobe 
and isthmus. There were also numerous and large metastases in the 
central neck compartment and right neck lymph nodes.
Conclusion: Differential diagnosis of high grade tumours can 
be challenging in cytology specimens. Positivity for PAX-8 in 
some cells should not result in prompt diagnosis of a lesion of 
thyroid origin, as follicular cells might be admixed to the cells of 
the metastasis depending on the pattern of the metastatic tumour 
growth. In the presented case of a rectal cancer metastasis, two 
contrasting elements led to an erroneous interpretation of the cytol-
ogy image: abundant necrosis and preservation of some follicular 
structures.

Epithelioid angiosarcoma of the adrenal gland: a rare case 
report
B. Konuk*, C.S. Topal
*Umraniye EducationTraining Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Angiosarcomas are aggressive malignant 
tumours originating from the blood and lymphatic vessel endothelium. 
It accounts for approximately 1% of all sarcomas. Although they are 
mostly seen in the skin and soft tissue, they rarely present with organ 
involvement.
Methods: We report on a 72-year-old man with an epitheloid 
angiosarcoma of the left adrenal gland. The patient had under-
gone cardiac bypass surgery for coronary artery disease and had 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In routine screenings,a 
cystic bleeding mass with a diameter of 11cm was detected in 
the left adrenal gland in computed tomography.Clinically,the 
non-functional mass was evaluated as adrenal insidentheloma 
and operated.
Results: Histologically, the tumour is a vascular tumour con-
sisting of epithelioid cells with vesicular nuclei and prominent 
nucleoli that occupies irregular vascular spaces and also forms 
solid areas, showing pleomorphism, necrosis, and viable mitotic 
activity. Immunohistochemical stain that revealed positive reactiv-
ity for cytokeratin, CD31, ERG, FLI-1. The case was diagnosed 
with primary adrenal epithelioid angiosarcoma, as there was only 
a lesion in the adrenal gland in the clinically and radiologically 
examinations. The differential diagnosis includes malignant vascu-
lar tumour, melanoma, poorly differentiated carcinoma, clear cell 
sarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
Conclusion: Epithelioid angiosarcoma is a highly aggressive 
endothelial cell malignancy. Although it often occurs in deep soft 
tissue, it has been reported that it can occur in various tissues such 
as adrenal, thyroid, skin and bone. Early diagnosis of these tumours 
due to their aggressive behaviour is important for treatment and 
prognosis. Therefore, we aimed to present our case, which requires 
careful evaluation of histomorphological immunohistochemical 
examinations in the diagnosis due to its unusual location.

Micromorphometric parameters of the adrenal cortex of rats 
under conditions of constant lighting and chronic alcohol 
intoxication

tova, E. Rusina, D. Areshidze
*Moscow MCC Kommunarka, Russia
Background & objectives: Excessive light exposure and chronic 
alcohol intoxication are characterized by the development of 
morphological changes in the adrenal glands. We examined the 
influence of constant lighting, chronic alcohol intoxication and their 
joint action on micromorphometric parameters of rat adrenal cortex.
Methods: The study was conducted on 160 male Wistar rats, which 
were divided into 4 groups and were kept for 3 weeks: control and I 
group – under fixed light regime, II and III group – under constant 
light regime, but I and III group received a 15-% water solution 
of ethanol. The width of the adrenal cortex zones was conducted.
Results: It was found that in animals of II group there was a 
decrease in the width of the cortex compared with the control, 
mainly due to the fascicular and reticular zones. In animals of I 
and III groups, an increase in the width of all zones of the cortex 
was observed, and in III group the increase in the glomerular and 
reticular zones was more pronounced than in animals of group I.
Conclusion: The conducted study indicates that constant illumina-
tion leads to a decrease in the thickness of the adrenal cortex, and 
the effect of ethanol, both separate and combined with constant 
illumination, leads to an increase in the width of the adrenal cortex.

Background & objectives: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is 
the most aggressive form of thyroid cancer, arising from the thyroid 
follicular cells. It accounts for the majority of deaths from thyroid 
carcinoma. This study aimed to evaluate the clinico-pathological and 
immunohistochemical features of ATC.
Methods: A retrospective-observational study was conducted over 
a 12-year period, between June 2009 and June 2021, including all 
patients diagnosed with ATC at the Emergency County Hospital 
from Timisoara. Medical records and histopathological features of 
tumour fragments, lobectomy and thyroidectomy specimens were 
analysed for all patients, as well as immunohistochemical markers 
(CK AE1/AE3, p53, Vimentin, Thyroglobulin, TTF-1, Ki-67) in 
some cases.
Results: Twenty-one patients were diagnosed with ATC. The aver-
age age at diagnosis was 70 years, and the female-to-male ratio 
was 9.5:1. On gross examination, the tumour was solid and par-
tially encapsulated (57%), unencapsulated (19%) or not specified; 
the average maximal dimension was 5.5 cm. Histologically, all 
ATCs were hypercellular, with spindle or squamoid cells, marked 
nuclear pleomorphism, high mitotic activity and tumour necrosis. 
The growth pattern was infiltrative, with extrathyroidal exten-
sion (62%), lymphovascular (71%) and perineural (43%) invasion. 
Twelve cases associated foci of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. 
Immunohistochemically, ATC expressed heterogenous positivity 
for CK AE1/AE3, p53, Vimentin; absent or weak expression for 
Thyroglobulin and TTF-1; mean Ki-67 index was greater than 60%.
Conclusion: In our study, ATC affected older women more com-
mon. Most cases were diagnosed in the advanced form, with 
aggressive morphological features and loss of thyroid differentia-
tion, which makes the diagnosis more challenging for pathologists 
as well as for clinicians. Due to the frequent association of foci of 
well-differentiated papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma, ATC 
could represent a gradually dedifferentiation of pre-existing well-
differentiated thyroid carcinomas. Recognition of these features is 
crucial for the therapeutic management of patients with anaplastic 
thyroid carcinoma.

Research Laboratory LR21SP01, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Variants of follicular adenomas include 
lipoadenoma, follicular adenoma with bizarre nuclei and signet-ring 
cell follicular adenoma. We report an exceptional case of lipoadenoma 
with bizarre nuclei and signet-ring cells and emphasize on pathologi-
cal, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics.
Methods: A 78-year-old woman presented with a left thyroidal 
nodule measuring 31 x 20 mm. It was classified EUTIRADS 5 
on ultrasonography. Fine needle aspiration showed sheets of tri-
dimensional cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. Cytology was 
reported malignant Bethesda VI suggesting poorly differentiated 
carcinoma. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy and lymph 
node dissection.
Results: Microscopically, the tumour presented micro-follicular 
and trabecular architecture with mixed adipose tissue. There were 
signet-ring cells associated to extracellular mucin. There were no 
vascular invasion and the tumour was well limited. Tumour cells 
had sparse marked anisokaryosis. Mitosis were rare (1/2mm²). 
Cells expressed TTF1, PAX8 and thyroglobulin. Adipose cells 
expressed PS100. Proliferative KI67 index was estimated to 1%. 
There were no expression of thyrocalcitonin, ACE, BRAF, Mam-
maglobin, GCDFP15, GATA3, TRK and SOX10. RNA sequencing 
detected an oncogenic PPARG-PAX8 fusion. Definitive diagnosis 
was bizarre nuclei lipoadenoma associating signet-ring cell. Lymph 
nodes were negative. The last follow up was in March 2022 and the 
patient had no evidence of recurrent disease.
Conclusion: This is the first case report of lipoadenoma with 
bizarre nuclei and signet-ring cells. The presence of bizarre nuclei 
and signet ring cells may lead to a misdiagnosis in cytology. The 
integrative pathology of morphology and immunohistochemical 
features led to the actual diagnosis.

pheochromocytoma in a male suffering from Li-Fraumeni 
syndrome: What is it? A case report
A.C. Loya*, A. Bondgaard, M. Klose, K. Wadt, K. Qvortrup
*Rigshospitalet, Denmark
Background & objectives: A rare variant of phaechromocytoma, 
’oncocytic variant’, has been described only 6 times in literature. It 
has relatively high malignant potential. However, ’Pseudo-oncocytic/
Rhabdoid’ morphology/variant has never been described. Here we 
present case seen in pateint of Li-Fraumeni syndrome for discussion.
Methods: Clinical examination, blood investigations, computed 
tomography (CT) scan, I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) 
scintigraphy and surgery were performed. Macroscopy, micros-
copy (conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining and immuno-
histochemistry) and transmission electron microscopy(TEM) were 
performed. The Pheochromocytoma of the Adrenal gland Scaled 
Score (PASS score) was used to evaluate the malignant potential 
of the tumour.
Results: A 33-year-old patient, known with Li-Fraumeni syndrome 
had a right-sided adrenal mass found on CT in 2019. With a 
clinical diagnosis of pheochomocytoma, surgery was performed. 
Histology showed a pheochromocytoma, morphologically having 
oncocytic features but without increased number of mitochondria 
confirmed by Prohibitin immunohistochemistry and TEM, 
indicating a pseudo-oncocytic subtype. The cells could also be 
interpreted as ’rhabdoid’. Unfortunately, the final conclusion could 
not be taken about the variant, but more arrows are pointing to a 
pseudooncocytic type.
Conclusion: So far in literature ’Pseudooncocytic/Rhabdoid’ sub-
type has never, to our knowledge, been described. Presence of Li 
Fraumeni syndrome makes this more special, however the exact 
incidence and nature of this variant is unknown. For that matter, 
actual ’Oncocytic variant’ is also not clearly known because of 
paucity of cases. Therefore, further explorations are needed to label 
this variant and to contemplate its existence, if any.

Background & objectives: Thyroid teratomas are extremely rare 
neoplasms mostly presenting in newborns and their grading is based 
on the quantity of immature neuroectodermal tissue. Thyroblastoma is 
a recently described embryonal neoplasm of adults resembling thyroid 
parenchyma within the first intrauterine trimester.
Methods: A 18-day-old female was delivered by a cesarean section 
at 36th gestational week due to ultrasonographically detected pleu-
ral effusion. At the time of birth, a palpable mass was observed in 
the neck. Computerized tomography revealed a neck mass, within 
the thyroid tissue. The patient underwent a left thyroid lobectomy 
after a FNAB diagnosis of an “immature teratoma”.
Results: On H&E, thyroid was almost completely replaced by the 
tumour. Pseudostratified ciliated columnar, intestinal and squamous 
epithelium; smooth/striated muscle, adipous tissue, mature 
cartilage, neuroglial elements and immature neuroectodermal 
component (INEC) were present. TTF-1/PAX8 confirmed the 
presence of mature residual thyroid tissue around the tumour. 
GFAP was positive in the INEC and the glial tissues. B-HCG, 
CD30, Glypican3 and OCT3/4 were negative. Ki67 index was 70% 
in the INEC, which occupied 10 low-power fields (LPFs). It was 
diagnosed as a “malignant teratoma” (grade 3) according to 2017 
WHO Classification of Endocrine Tumours which recommends 
grading tumours with more than 4 LPFs of INEC, mitoses, and/or 
pleomorphism as grade 3/malignant teratoma.
Conclusion: The last (2022) WHO Classification of Endocrine & 
Neuroendocrine Tumours states that thyroid tumours with more 
than 4 LPFs of INEC should be reclassified as thyroblastoma. How-
ever, thyroblastoma is defined as a tumour composed of foetal-type 
primitive-appearing thyroid follicles, and primitive spindle cells 
arranged into fascicles which are absent in this tumour. We want to 
emphasize that there are very rare thyroid tumours that are unaware 
of the fact that the WHO classification has changed.

*Hospital Universitari Parc Taulí. I3PT. UAB, Spain
Background & objectives: Despite the good overall prognosis, some 
thyroid cancer types may show unfavourable evolution (UE). Our 
objective is to determine the frequency and type of genetic alterations 
that can provide prognostic and therapeutic information in a series of 
cases with UE.
Methods: Retrospective observational study. Subjects: patients 
with differentiated thyroid cancer with unfavourable evolution, 
poorly differentiated and anaplastic carcinomas, treated at our insti-
tution between 2001 and 2019, both inclusive. Methodology: case 
identification, extraction of DNA, PCR, library preparation, purifi-
cation and massive sequencing of optimal samples using AmpliSeq 
Focus Panel, AmpliSeq Library PLUS on MiSeq sequencer (illu-
mina), bioinformatics analysis on Variant Interpreter (illumina).
Results: Seventeen cases with optimal samples could be studied: 
3 papillary carcinomas (PTC) and 2 follicular carcinomas (FTC) 
with UE, 5 poorly differentiated carcinomas (PDTC), three of them 
with UE, 3 anaplastic carcinomas (ATC), all of them with UE, 
1 PTC with a minor component of PDTC and good evolution, 1 
PTC with a minor component of ATC and UE, and 2 PDTC with 
a minor component of FTC and UE. Ten cases had pathogenic/
variant of unknown significance point mutations: 5 in NRAS (3 
p.Gln61Arg and 2 p.Gln61Lys), 2 in BRAF (p.Val600Glu), 1 in 
EGFR (p.Arg297Cys), 1 in BRAF (p.Val600Glu) and PIK3CA 
(p.Glu545Lys), and 1 in NRAS (p.Gln61Arg) and BRAF 
(p.Asp594Asn).
Conclusion: Massive sequencing has provided information about 
pathogenic or variants of unknown significance mutations in 10 of 
the 17 cases studied, although in 7 of them the alterations detected 
could have been identified by simpler and cheaper methods, as they 
correspond to NRAS mutations and BRAF V600E mutation. In two 
cases more than one mutation could be detected. The meaning and 
clinical implications of these concomitant mutations need further 
investigation.

Adrenal gland composite pheochromocytoma – ganglioneu-
roma: a case report
A. Stofas*, A. Patereli, K. Palamaris, H. Gakiopoulou, P. 
Korkolopoulou
*1st Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, National and 
Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: Composite pheochromocytoma of the adre-
nal medulla is a rare neuroendocrine tumour that represents the 1-9% 
of pheochromocytomas. Little is known about its biologic potential, 
as only seventy cases have been reported previously in the literature.
Methods: We describe a case of adrenal composite 
pheochromocytoma -ganglioneuroma in a 66-year-old female 
patient. After surgery, the right adrenal gland specimen was 
processed and examined by standard H&E technique and 
immunohistochemistry. Cut surface showed a grey - brown lesion 
measuring 4 cm.
Results: Histologically, the tumour was composed of two distinct 
patterns. One pattern was composed of polygonal cells arranged in 
well-defined nests surrounded by a delicate fibrovascular stroma 
consistent with pheochromocytoma. The other pattern consisted 
of ganglion cells embedded in a schwannian stroma which was 
consistent with ganglioneuroma. Both components were positive 
for Chromogranin A and Synaptophysin but with variable inten-
sities. Ganglion cells within the ganglioneuroma component and 
sustentacular cells within the pheochromocytoma component were 
positive for S-100 protein. Melan A, p504s, AE1/AE3 και Inhibin 
were negative. The mitotic index was <5%.
Conclusion: The frequency of composite adrenal-pheochromocy-
toma tumours has been reported as ranging from less than 3% of all 
adrenal gland neoplasms. They are treated in principle by complete 
surgical resection. An adequate clinical follow-up is advised for 
the potentially malignant neoplasms. It is difficult to predict the 
clinical behaviour. There are no absolute criteria for malignancy. 
However, features more frequently noted in malignant tumours are 
the presence of necrosis, vascular invasion and/or extensive local 
invasion, cytological atypia and high mitotic index.

has an indolent course. This study aims to describe its epidemiological, 
histologic characteristics and to provide data on outcome after surgery.
Methods: We retrospectively analysed 31 consecutive patients with 
PTMC who underwent surgery at our institution between 2012 and 
2021; 27 of them (87% of cases) were treated also with radioiodine 
therapy and followed for at least 1 year. The data on patients gen-
der, age, morphological characteristics, extent of disease, therapy, 
locoregional and distant control were collected.
Results: There were 26 women and 5 men. The mean age was 53.5. 
Most of the PTMCs were diagnosed incidentally during pathologic 
examination. Median tumour size was 5.5 mm. 16% of PTMCs 
showed multifocality, with 3 cases of unilateral multifocal lesions 
and 2 cases with bilateral multifocal tumours. TNM stages were I 
in 30 patients (96.77%) and III in one patient (3.2%). A total of 18 
cases (58%) had regional lymph node sampling and 3 of them were 
metastatic (9%). 25 patients (80.64%) underwent bilateral lobar 
resection. During the follow-up period, the recurrence was diag-
nosed in only 1 patient (locoregional recurrence one year later). 
There were no PTMC related deaths.
Conclusion: The prognosis for patients with papillary thyroid 
microcarcinoma in this serie was excellent, with a 100% survival 
rate and and a low rate of recurrence associated with PTMC. 
Nevertheless, approximately 3% of patients developed recurrent 
disease; aggressive treatment may be justified depending on the 
presence or absence of prognostic risk factors.

Othman, M. Ksentini, N. Znaidi, S. Rammeh
*Department of Pathology, Charles Nicolle Hospital Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Frozen section examination (FSE) of thy-
roid nodules is an essential step in guiding surgical procedures and 
aiming for optimal patient management.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability of FS 
according to definite histologic examination.
Methods: This was a retrospective study conducted on 536 thyroid 
resection specimens sent for FSE over a 4-year period. FSE’s results 
were compared to the final microscopic examination (FME),. The 
diagnostic value of FSE was evaluated by calculating sensitivity (Se), 
specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive 
value (NPV). Delayed results were excluded from statistical analysis.
Results: The population included 452 women and 84 men (aver-
age age: 49.9 years). The 536 FS were benign in 284 cases (53%), 
malignant in 60 cases (11.2%) and the response was delayed in 
192 cases (35.8%). The FME showed that among the 284 nod-
ules considered benign, 224 were truly benign and 60 were malig-
nant. Among the 60 malignant, 56 were carcinomas: papillary 
(52), vesicular(3) and undifferentiated(1) and 4 were benign. The 
delayed results were benign in 76 cases, malignant in 112 cases 
and lesions of uncertain malignancy in 4 cases. The Sp was 98.3% 
with a PPV of 93.3% and the Se was 48.3% with a NPV of 78.9%.
Conclusion: FSE is very reliable with a Sp approaching 100%. The rate 
of thyroid carcinomas reported varies from 4.5 to 26.3%, depending on the 
series. In our study, it was 11.2%. Most of series showed false positivity 
(FP) between 0.1 to 0.6% and Sp between 50 to 92% which is comparable 
to our series, where we found FP in 0.7% and Sp in 98.3%. The low Se 
was related to encapsulated vesicular lesions, technical problems, nuclear 
artifacts and difficulty of microcarcinoma’s identification.

Squamous cell carcinoma of the ovary associated with endome-
triosis: a case report
I. Bernal Simón*, M. Rezola Bajineta
*Donostia University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: To analyse the clinical, therapeutic and 
pathologic features of a primary squamous cell ovary carcinoma case 
associated with endometriosis. This is a rare entity that accounts less 
than 1% of primary ovarian malignant tumours.
Methods: 52 years old woman presented to gynecological consult 
for abnormal vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal pain. She had 
no history of malignancies or relevant diseases. Physical examina-
tion and imaging showed several uterine nodules consistent with 
myomas and a torsion of the right ovary with central necrosis. The 
patient underwent surgery, performing total hysterectomy with left 
salpinguectomy and right adnexectomy.
Results: On microscopic examination, moderately differentiated 
squamous cell carcinoma of the ovary was seen displaying a 
diffusely infiltrative pattern with abundant keratinization and 
extensive necrosis. The cells had pleomorphic nuclei with 
conspicuous nucleoli and ill defined citoplasmic borders. Central 
areas showed abundant keratin formation with some calcifications. 
Isolated glandular formations without atypia were observed in 
the ovarian cortex consistent with endometriosis. The ovary was 
entirely submitted and did not reveal other lesions like teratoma 
or Brenner tumour. Surgical staging was performed showing a 
peritoneal implant. The patient received paclitaxel, carboplatin and 
bevacizumab. At the moment, she is disease-free after 14 months 
of follow-up.
Conclusion: Squamous cell carcinoma of the ovary is an infrequent 
tumour with few cases reported in the literature. It has poor 
prognosis and in most cases arises from mature cystic teratoma 
with malignant transformation or less frequently shows association 
with endometriosis or Brenner tumour. The pure form is not related 
with any of the conditions mentioned before. Optimal debulking 
surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy seem to be the best treatment 
option in advanced disease but further studies are needed.

Malignant transformation of ovarian mature teratoma: a 
20-year experience of Tunisian centre
A. Bchir, N. Abdessayed*, T. Tlili, S. Mabrouk, M. Mokni
*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, 
Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Mature teratoma is the most common 
tumour of ovary. It is usually a benign germ cell tumours. Malignant 
transformation is extremely rare. The objective of our study is to high-
light the clinico-pathologic characteristic of malignant transformation 
of ovarian mature teratoma.
Methods: A total of 6 cases of mature teratoma with malignant 
transformation at the Department of Pathology and Gynaecology 
of Farhat Hached University Hospital in Sousse, over a period of 
20 years (from 2000 to 2019). A review of clinical, paraclinical, 
pathological and evolutionary data was performed in all cases.
Results: The prevalence of mature teratoma with malignant trans-
formation was 0.12%. The average age was 57.5 years. The main 
clinical presentation was abdominal pain. The main tumour size 
was 15.1 cm. 3 tumours were in the right, one case were in the 
left and 2 were bilateral. Abdominal sonography was an essential 
exam for the diagnosis. There were 3 squamous carcinoma, one 
melanoma, one intestinal type adenocarcinoma and one vesicular

thyroid carcinoma. The main survival time for 3 patients varied 
from 1to 8 months. The other patients were lost.
Conclusion: Mature teratoma with malignant transformation are 
rare aggressive tumours that mostly occurs in post-menopausal 
age. It is characterized by a late stage diagnosis and poor outcome. 
Treatment is based on surgery and radio-chemotherapy. Immuno-
therapy and target therapy has been recently introduced to reduce 
mortality. The overall goals of management are palliation of symp-
toms, preventing recurrence or spread of disease and preservation 
of fertility.

Expression of autophagy markers in ovarian cancer
L. Jovanovic*, A. Nikolić, S. Dragicevic, M. Jović, R. Janković
*Department of Human Reproduction, Faculty of Medicine, Uni-
versity of Belgrade, Serbia
Background & objectives: Autophagy is a crucial cellular mechanism 
that coordinates various physiological processes. Many cancers can 
activate autophagy and make the tumour more aggressive. In this study, 
we analysed autophagy in ovarian cancers.
Methods: We included 122 patients with ovarian cancers. Tissue 
microarray was made for immunohistochemical analysis of p62, 
LC3, and Beclin1 expressions. Their expressions were correlated 
with tumour histology type, differentiation, and stage. The 
percentage of positive tumour cells was estimated from the total 
number of tumour cells. Samples with positive cells were stratified 
into three ranges of positivity: <10%; 10–50%; >50%.
Results: There was a strong positive correlation between p62 and 
LC3 expression, while both markers were in negative correlation 
with Beclin1. The expression of each analysed marker showed a 
statistically significant association with tumour histological type, 
stage, and differentiation (p<0.001). While p62 and LC3 were more 
prominently expressed in patients with high-grade serous ovarian 
cancer (HGSOC), Beclin 1 expression was lower in HGSOC and 
more prominent in other histology types. A higher expression of 
p62 and LC3 was observed in later tumour stages, while the oppo-
site was observed for Beclin1 expression. Tumour differentiation 
positively correlated with p62 and LC3 expression, and negatively 
with Beclin1 expression.
Conclusion: The expression of p62 and LC3 was more promi-
nent in HGSOC in comparison to other histology types, while 
Beclin1 expression was more prominent in carcinomas other than 
in HGSOC. While p62 and LC3 expression was associated with 
higher tumour stages and tumour grades, the opposite was found 
for Beclin1. Prominent p62 and LC3 expression in combination 
with weak Beclin1 expression in HGSOC indicate the potential 
for application of autophagy inhibitors in patients with this tumour 
subtype.

Expanding the spectrum of GLI1-activated mesenchymal 
tumours – a high-grade uterine sarcoma harbouring a novel 
PAMR1-GLI1 fusion
L.S. Punjabi*, R.C.H. Goh, K. Sittampalam
*Department of Anatomical Pathology, Singapore General Hos-
pital, Singapore
Background & objectives: GLI1-activated mesenchymal tumours 
comprise a group of seemingly unrelated entities, including pericy-
toma with t(7;12) translocation, plexiform fibromyxoma, gastroblas-
toma, malignant epithelioid neoplasm with GLI1 rearrangements and 
GLI1-amplified mesenchymal neoplasms. Herein we report an unusual 
GLI1-rearranged uterine sarcoma.
Methods: Clinical history:
A 57-year-old female presented with an abdomino-pelvic mass. 
MRI showed a myometrial mass extending beyond the serosa, with 
features of peritoneal involvement. The patient underwent onco-
logic resection. Gross examination revealed a perforated multi-nod-
ular uterine tumour (21cm) with a firm white and soft fleshy cut 
surface, featuring haemorrhage and necrosis. An omental deposit 
(9cm) also displayed similar appearance.
Results: Histopathology:
The tumour was morphologically heterogenous, disclosing 
frankly sarcomatous areas composed of pleomorphic spindle 
and focally epithelioid cells, intermingled with a component 
of monomorphic spindle cells arranged in fascicles. There was 
a rich vascular network and zones of necrosis with peripheral 
amianthoid-like collagen plaques. Lymphovascular invasion and 
metastasis to lymph nodes and omentum were identified. The 
tumour was immunopositive for CD10 and cyclinD1, and negative 
for MNF116, ER, p16, CD117, DOG1, S100, smooth muscle and 
melanotic markers. ArcherTM Fusion Sarcoma Assay detected 
PAMR1(exon1)-GLI1(exon4) fusion, confirmed on RT-PCR 
and Sanger sequencing. The patient received adjuvant chemo-
radiotherapy however developed metastatic recurrence and demised 
18 months post-surgery.
Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this forms the third 
report of GLI1-rearranged uterine sarcoma. Previous reports 
showed low-grade epithelioid morphology and harboured canonical 
fusions (ACTB-GLI1, PTCH1-GLI1). In contrast, this case shows 
high grade, predominantly spindled morphology and harbours a 
novel fusion, PAMR1-GLI1. The precise classification of these 
tumours, and their relation to other uterine sarcomas with high 
GLI1 expression, including a subset of HG-ESS and LMS, remain 
uncertain. Emerging GLI/Hedgehog inhibitors provide clinical rel-
evance to recognising these tumours.

Cervical carcinosarcoma: a rare case report
S. Reis*, N. Castelo-Branco, C. Caramujo, R. Marques, G. Sousa, 
P. Figueiredo
*Department of Pathology, Instituto Português de Oncologia de 
Coimbra Francisco Gentil EPE, Portugal
Background & objectives: Uterine carcinosarcoma is an aggressive 
biphasic malignant neoplasm, composed of epithelial and mesenchymal 
elements. Cervical carcinosarcoma (CCS) is exceptionally rare with 
less than 70 cases described in the English literature.
Methods: We present a case of a 63-year-old woman with a sud-
den episode of high volume serous vaginal discharge. On physical 
examination there was a 5 cm exophytic flat friable mass in the 
cervix. A pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an 
expansive lesion with 70x50x56mm in the endocervical canal that 
did not invade the uterine body.
Results: The biopsy revealed a malignant neoplasm with a pre-
dominant sarcomatous component without a specific morphologi-
cal differentiation, and less than 5% of squamous cell carcinoma. 
Immunohistochemistry revealed positivity for cytokeratins (AE1-
AE3; 34BE12; CK 8/18) and EMA in the squamous component; 
CK8/18 was heterogeneously positive in the sarcomatous component 
and p16 was diffusely positive in both components. Accordingly, the 
proposed diagnosis was cervical carcinosarcoma with homologous 
mesenchymal component. The patient was submitted to radical sur-
gery and the final post-operative staging was FIGO (2018): IB3. 
Due to surgical complications adjuvant treatment was not performed.

Conclusion: CCS is rare and can be misdiagnosed in cervical 
biopsy due to the lack of identification of one of the tumour com-
ponents. CCS is aggressive, being the tumour stage the single 
most important prognostic factor. CCS most frequently presents 
as a vaginal discharge, which in this case allowed the diagnosis 
in an early stage of the disease - FIGO (2018):IB3. Even though 
there were surgical complications, the patient recovered well, 
without evidence of disease during the 12-months follow-up.

CD163 overexpression in serous ovarian carcinoma with 
calcification
R. Chyzhma*, A. Piddubnyi, R. Moskalenko
*Sumy State University, Dept. of Pathology, Sumy, Ukraine
Background & objectives: CD163 is expressed by 
M2-macrophages in malignant neoplasms. M2-macrophages 
are tumour-associated macrophages of the immunosuppressive 
phenotype. They are predictors of unfavorable prognosis and 
contribute to the progression of the tumour process.
To study the CD163 expression in serous ovarian carcinoma.
Methods: We examined 30 samples of serous ovarian 
carcinoma with calcification (group 1) and 30 samples without 
calcification (group 2). A histological study was performed to 
verify the material and form groups. An immunohistochemical 
study was performed using CD163 Monoclonal Antibody. The 
immunohistochemical study was evaluated by counting CD163+ 
M2 macrophages in 6 fields of view (1 mm2) of each slice.
Results: CD163 expression in group 1 (with calcification) was 
higher (192.47±14.80 cells per 1 mm2) compared to group 2 
(without calcification) (150.67±9.56 cells per 1 mm2, p<0.05, 
Student’s t-test). CD163+ M2-macrophages were mostly 
localized in the tumour stroma, tumour cells, and around 
calcifications.
Conclusion: Overexpression of CD163 is detected in serous 
ovarian carcinoma with calcification. It indicates the involvement 
of M2-macrophages in the formation of tumour calcifications.

B. El Khannoussi
*Ibn Sina University Hospital Center, Morocco
Background & objectives: Vaginal adenosarcoma is an exceptional 
tumour arising from endometriosis.
We report through this case, the 8th in the literature and the 
first without endometriosis signs, the elements of the positive 
diagnosis and our experience in treatment of this rare tumour
Methods: A 34-years-old patient consulted for vaginal pain 
with a prolapse mass. She did not any clinical or radiological 
sign of endometriosis. Gynaecological examination showed 
a mass of vagina. Mass biopsy was performed. Pathology 
results were consistent with the diagnosis of a low grade 
adenosarcoma. The patient underwent hysterectomy with 
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without any neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy.
Results: Primary vaginal adenosarcoma is extremely rare. Only 
seven cases have been reported in literature. It was reported that 
vaginal adenosarcoma were considered to be arising from vaginal 
endometriosis. Our patient is the first in the literature without a 
sign of endometriosis. Anatomopathological examination is the 
gold standard for diagnosis.
Histological examination reveals a biphasic tumour with phyllodes-
like architecture composed of benign endometrioid glands and 
stroma. Depending on stromal cytologic atypia, we distinguish 
low grade adenosarcomas with monotonous stromal nuclei with 
mild to moderate atypia and High grade adenosarcomas with 
pleomorphic and markedly atypical nuclei. Surgical exicion is 
the main management. Benefit of postoperative chemotherapy or 
radiotherapy is uncertain.
Conclusion: Vaginal adenosarcoma is an extremely rare biphasic 
neoplasm that is most often, but not necessarily, linked to 
endometriosis. The diagnosis is based on histological study because 
of non-specific clinical and radiological features. Treatment and 
prognostic factors have not been established yet.

A combined high grade serous carcinoma and carcinosarcoma 
arising in mature teratoma in ovary: a report of a case
S.Y. Kwon*, J.M. Park, S.J. Kum, H.C. Shin, H.W. Lee, H.R. Jung, 
I. Hwang, M. Choe, S. Kim
*Keimyung University, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Carcinosarcoma is a rare type of malignant 
ovarian tumour, consists of both epithelial carcinoma and malignant 
mesenchymal tumour. Additionally, it is much rarer, coexisting with 
other types of ovarian malignancy.
Methods: We present a case of a 67-year-old postmenopausal 
woman with combined high grade serous carcinoma and carcino-
sarcoma arising in mature teratoma in the same ovary. The patient 
visited our hospital due to abdominal distension for a year and the 
computed tomography showed a 5cm-sized solid mass with ascites 
of whole pelvic cavity. She underwent explolaparotomy after pre-
operative chemotherapy.
Results: Grossly, right ovary showed a solid and cystic mass with 
hair and cartilaginous components. Microscopiccaly, tumour was 
composed of an admixture of biphasic malignant tumour arising in 
mature teratoma. The malignant mesenchymal tumours consisted 
of chondrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and undifferentiated 
sarcoma, while malignant epithelial components were squamous 
cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Synchronously, high grade 
serous carcinoma with positivity of WT-1 and p53 coexisted in 
the same ovary. The patient died of the peritoneal seeding of 
malignant tumour 2 years after diagnosis, despite the postoperative 
chemotherapy.
Conclusion: Malignant transformation of a mature teratoma 
is associated with a poor prognosis. To our knowledge, this is 
a unique case, carcinosarcoma arising in teratoma coexisting 
with high grade serous carcinoma, which has not been reported 
previously.

Background & objectives: Rhabdomyosarcoma of uterine cervix is a 
very rare malignant tumour, especially in adults. Rhabdomyosarcoma is

classified into several subtypes, which are embryonal, alveolar, spindle 
cell/sclerosing, and pleomorphic.
Methods: We present the case of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma in 
a 34-year-old woman with vaginal bleeding. Magnetic resonance 
imaging revealed a cervical mass with several enlarged iliac 
lymph nodes without distant metastasis. Malignant neoplasm was 
suspicious and total hysterectomy was done after hormone therapy.
Results: Microscopically, the cervical mass was composed of two 
distinct features; one with small discohesive cells and the other 
with larger cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immuno-
histochemical stains showed positivity for vimentin, myogenin, 
and myo-D1 at both different features, but in different patterns, 
suggesting the diagnosis of mixed alveolar and embryonal rhabdo-
myosarcoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detected 
the FOXO1 translocation, supporting the diagnosis of alveolar 
rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient underwent the postoperative 
radiation and chemotherapy, but multiple node metastasis along 
para-aortic, mesenteric, aortocaval, and supraclavicular area was 
detected 6 months after surgery, and the patient died of the disease 
a year after surgery.
Conclusion: FISH playes an important role in distinguishing sub-
types of rhabdomyosarcoma, and it is important to recognize these 
different subtypes due to difference of overall survival.

Coexistence of mature cystic teratoma of the ovary with 
endometrioid adenocarcinoma arising from a site of 
endometriosis: a case report of an extremely rare combined 
ovarian lesion
C. Gouta*, C. Nikolaidou, I. Venizelos
*Department of Histopathology, Hippokration General Hospital 
of Thessaloniki, Greece
Background & objectives: Both endometriosis and mature cystic 
teratoma tend to occur very frequently at reproductive ages. However, 
their coexistence is extremely rare, particularly in postmenopausal 
patients. The incidence of a synchronous ovarian endometrioid 
adenocarcinoma has hardly ever been reported.
Methods: We report the case of a 63-year-old postmenopausal 
female with a history of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, who presented 
with an ovarian mass as an incidental finding during a CT scan 
follow-up. Additional imaging tests described the mass as partly 
solid and partly cystic. The patient underwent a total hysterectomy 
with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and a bilateral pelvic lymph 
node dissection.
Results: Macroscopic examination showed an ovarian lesion 
measuring 8x7x3.8 cm, composed of both a thin-wall cystic 
element and a solid counterpart. The cystic part was filled with 
white soft material, hair and blood, while the solid one appeared 
whitish and elastic. Microscopically, the lesion displayed three 
different pathologic entities; an endometriotic cyst, from which 
a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma arose, and a mature cystic 
teratoma. The neoplastic cells were positive for CK7, PAX8 
and CK15.3 and negative for CK20. p53 appeared mildly to 
moderately positive (wild type).
Conclusion: To our knowledge, up until now there have been pub-
lished only 4 case reports and one case series of simultaneous 
mature cystic teratoma and endometriosis since 1960, all of which 
occurred in women of reproductive age and not necessarily on the 
same ovary. Our case report contributes to the literature presenting 
an even rarer entity of a synchronous lesion coexisting unilaterally 
in the same ovary, raising questions about the succession of events 
and the pathophysiological mechanisms involved.

Gallbladder carcinoma recurs as uterine metastasis
H. Trihia*, M. Terzi, L. Karelis, M. Karagianni, O. Tzaida, C. 
Iavazzo
*Pathology Department Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Metastases to the female genital tract are 
rare, with metastatic disease restricted to the uterus being even less 
frequent. The primary tumour is most often intra-genital rather than 
extra-genital. We present a case of uterine metastasis of a gallbladder 
carcinoma.
Methods: A 66-year-old woman was diagnosed with a 3,4cm lobu-
lated mass, in the left parametrium, of mixed consistency, with no 
sign of endometrial tumour. There was no lymph node enlargement 
or ascites. Her past medical history was significant for gallbladder 
carcinoma, stage II, since 2,5 years, after laparoscopic cholocyst-
ectomy for symptomatic cholethiliasis. She underwent TAH & BSO 
omentectomy and umbilicectomy.
Results: On macroscopic examination the body of the uterus 
was occupied by a tumour mass measuring 3cm. In the left 
ovary there was a 1,9cm tumour, solid and cystic filled with 
serous-mucoid fluid and in the right ovary a cystic tumour of 
1,8cm. The omentum had hard consistency of 6cm. In the left 
ovary a diagnosis of an adenosquamous carcinoma was made of 
billiary and intestinal type with squamous component of >25%, 
with areas of necrosis and LVIs and parasalpingeal extension. 
There was a full thickness infiltration of the uterine wall, of 
the right ovary, the omentum and umbilicus, by billiary type 
adenocarcinoma, consistent with metastasis from the gallbladder 
carcinoma (GBC).
Conclusion: Metastases to the female genital tract are rare. When 
metastases from extragenital primaries occur, the ovaries are 
affected the most. Metastatic localization in the uterine corpus 
accounts for less than 10%. Concurrent metastatic disease in the 
ovaries is found in 65%. Among extragenital primary tumours 
metastasizing to the uterine corpus is GBC in 4,8%. Dissemination 
of GBC has a propensity for distant spread. Uterine metastasis 
has to be excluded in women with uterine/parametrial mass and a 
personal history of GBC.

poulos, C. Iavazzo
*Pathology Department Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Ovarian lymphomas are usually secondary 
and indication of disseminated disease. Primary ovarian lymphomas 
are rare and of better prognosis. We describe a primary ovarian 
follicular lymphoma in a 71-year-old woman who underwent surgery 
for a fibroma of the ovary.
Methods: We received the uterus with left fallopian tube measur-
ing 6cm long and 0,3cm maximum diameter and left ovary whose 
dimensions were 4,5X3,5X2cm. On sections the ovary was almost 
fully replaced by a mass with smooth, lobulated surface with 
solid, vaguely nodular, tan-white appearance and sclero-elastotic 
consistency.
Results: Microscopic examination showed a B-cell proliferation 
arranged in follicular (75%) and diffuse distribution, consisting of 
numerous, variably-sized, non-polarized neoplastic follicles, with 
attenuated or absent mantle zones, expansile and typically arranged 
in a back-to-back fashion. Focal residual ovarian parenchyma was 
identified, confirming its ovarian origin. The neoplastic cells

by immunohistochemistry were expressing CD20, CD79a, CD3, 
PAX5, CD23, CIg, CD10, bcl-2, bcl-6 with Ki-67 proliferation rate 
30-40% in the nodular areas and 0-5 centroblasts per high power 
field. No lymph nodal or bone marrow involvement was detected. 
Tumour markers were unremarkable. The final diagnosis was of 
a primary low-grade follicular lymphoma. Standardized first-line 
therapy for follicular lymphoma, with R-CHOP chemotherapy, was 
introduced.
Conclusion: Most ovarian lymphomas represent secondary 
involvement by a systemic disease. In comparison, primary ovarian 
lymphomas are rare and incidental but ovary is the most common 
site in the female genital tract to be involved by haematological 
malignancies. This case exemplifies the need to consider NHL in 
the differential diagnosis of unusual large solid ovarian tumours. 
Their prognosis is better than secondary lymphomas, which have 
to be excluded clinically. In our case the patient is free of disease 
one year later.

Kometova, L. Adamyan
*National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynaecology 
and Perinatology named after Academician V.I.Kulakov, Russia
Background & objectives: Uterine leiomyoma is the most common 
neoplasms in the female reproductive tract. Myomectomy is selected to 
preserve the uterus, however, this neoplasm can recur after this surgical 
treatment. Consequently, we aimed to identify immunohistochemical 
markers of recurrent uterine fibroids.
Methods: Samples of 13 patients with primary diagnosed leio-
myoma and 18 patients with recurrent one, who had been provided 
lapascopic reconstructive plastic surgery were recruited. Pathomor-
phological and immunohistochemical examination was carried out 
for leiomyoma. The expression of the proliferation marker (Ki-67), 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), progesterone (PgR) and 
oestrogen (ER) receptors, proto-oncogene p16 and anti-oncogene 
p53 was evaluated.
Results: It was found that Ki-67 level was higher in reccurent 
fibroids as to primary diagnosed tumours (p = 0.031), which 
may reflect the proliferative potential of the tumour most prone 
to recurrence. In studied groups there was significant difference 
between ER, PgR, p16 biomarkers. Increased VEGF expression 
was revealed in both leiomyomas compared to internal control 
(normal myometrium), but expression level in each group was not 
found to differ. Apparently, changes in p53 expression are not lead-
ing in the pathogenesis of uterine fibroids, since there were no 
statistically significant differences in the expression of this protein 
between patients groups.
Conclusion: Pathogenetic factors of recurrent uterine fibroids are 
high rates of Ki-67, VEGF, p16, ER and PgR in leiomyoma. These 
tissue-based markers seem to be usefull in routine practice to pre-
dict the recurrent potential of uterine fibroids.

Endometrial stromal nodule in pregnancy - an unsual presenta-
tion of exceedingly rare tumour
D. Tapoi*, A. Dumitru, A. Iliesiu, M. Sajin, M. Costache, O. 
Munteanu
*University Emergency Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Endometrial stromal nodule is an exceed-
ingly rare benign tumour, most often diagnosed in perimenopausal 
women, who complain of abnormal bleeding and local pain. In such 
cases, hysterectomy is recommended as clinical and imaging investiga-
tions cannot rule out malignancy.
Methods: We report the case of a pregnant 32 year old woman 
who a healthy, full-term baby by C-section. During the surgery, 
a well circumscribed, solid, yellow nodule measuring 6x4x3 cm 
was incidentally observed located on the maternal surface of the 
placenta. The tumour was surgically removed and underwent ample 
histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis.
Results: Microscopic examination revealed a well demarcated 
proliferation of polygonal to spindle cells with abundant eosino-
philic cytoplasm and large nuclei with conspicous nucleoli, consist-
ent with decidual reaction. The cells were arranged in fascicles, 
within a myxoid stroma. The mitotic activity was about 15/10 HPF. 
Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the tumour cells 
stain intensely for CD10, SMA and WT1 and moderately for PLAP. 
Ki67 (MIB1) proliferation index was about 20%, which could be 
explained by the hormonal stimuli. Based on these results, the 
diagnosis of endometrial stromal nodule was established with 
decidualization.
Conclusion: Endometrial stromal nodules are among the rarest 
benign tumours of the uterus. Since these tumours usually affect 
perimenopausal women and preoperative investigations cannot 
establish the benign nature, hysterectomy is considered the 
standard treatment. The case we present is unique because, to our 
knowledge, there are only two reported cases of an endometrial 
stromal nodule associated with pregnancy. This association renders 
the histopathological diagnosis particularly difficult due to the 
unusual morphological features, reflecting hormonal changes.

Combined small cell and large cell neuroendocrine tumour of 
uterine cervix - a case report
C. Valavanis*, N. Novkovic, G. Stanc, G. Vorgias, M. Papazian, 
M. Sevastiadou, E. Souka
*Molecular Pathology Unit Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Neuroendocrine tumours of the female 
genital tract are aggressive neoplasms, developing most often in the 
uterine cervix (NECC) and accounting for 1.4% of all cervical cancers. 
The prognosis of NECC is poor and there is no standardized therapy.
Methods: A 39-year-old patient presented to our hospital 
for vaginal bleeding. She had a previous core needle biopsy 
from omentum who showed endometrioid carcinoma of ovary/
endometrium (ER and PgR positive, WT-1 negative). Imaging 
showed frozen pelvis with a large right parametrial mass. Cervical 
and endometrial biopsies were performed in order to define the 
type and origin of the neoplasm.
Results: In both specimens the histoplathological examination 
revealed a high-grade neoplasm with neuroendocrine features, with 
a mixture of small cells and large cells, with cellular necrosis and 
brisk mitotic figures. Both specimens had the same immunophe-
notype. All the neoplastic cells were positive for Synaptophysin, 
Chromogranin A, CD56, ISL-1, p16 and CK7 and negative for 
ER, PgR, PAX-8, CDX-2, WT-1 and p40. The Ki-67 was positive 
in 80-90% of neoplastic cells. The endometrioid component was 
absent in both specimens. The diagnosis of high-grade neuroendo-
crine carcinoma with small and large cell morphology was made. 
The absence of tumour elsewhere based on MRI concluded that the 
primary tumour is from the cervix.

Endometrial carcinoma with multiple metastases to the central 
nervous system: a case report with a comparative NGS analysis 
of the primary and metastatic tumours
M. Al- Hussaini*, A. Tbakhi, W. Naser, J.Z. Amarin, A. 
Abi-Sheikha
*King Hussien Cancer Center, Jordan
Background & objectives: Metastasis from endometrial carcinoma 
to the central nervous system is rarely encountered. We report a case 
of a 34-year-old female with dedifferentiated endometrial carcinoma 
metastasizing to the brain which developed six months later.
Methods: There was a well-differentiated endometrial carcinoma, 
and a second component of poorly differentiated carcinoma, both 
were positive for PAX-8 immunostain. The CNS metastatic tumour 
is composed of sheets of undifferentiated tumour cells with islands 
of immature cartilage, with negative PAX-8 immunostain. These 
tumours were subject to analysis by NGS to verify the relationship 
between the different components.
Results: NGS of the well-differentiated endometrial carcinoma 
component showed a pathogenic KRAS mutation (c.35G>A, 
p.Gly12Asp) with an allele-variant frequency (AVF) of 53.5%, in 
addition to mutations in the PIK3CA and PTEN genes, as well 
as a mutation of an unknown significance in the PDGFRA gene. 
The poorly differentiated component showed a mutation profile 
similar to the well-differentiated component. However, it lacked the 
KRAS mutation and harboured two extra mutations in the NRAS 
(c.182A>G, p.Gln61Arg) and PIK3CA (c.1034A>G, p.Asn345Ser) 
genes, with an AVF of 33.4% and 32.7%, respectively. Interestingly, 
the metastatic brain tumour showed an almost identical mutation 
profile to the poorly differentiated component of the endometrial 
carcinoma.
Conclusion: This is a rare case of metastasizing endometrial 
carcinoma to the CNS. Molecular testing supported almost 
identical molecular profiles between the poorly-differentiated 
endometrial carcinoma, and the metastatic tumour in the CNS, 
indicating that the brain tumour had possibly originated from the 
poorly differentiated endometrial carcinoma component. This 
might have implications for the treatment of similar cases.

Determination of microsatellite instability with the Promega™ 
MSI Analysis System and the Idylla™ MSI assay on 31 endo-
metrial carcinomas with deficiency of DNA mismatch repair

Moreno, I. Ruz Caracuel, P. García Abellás, I. Carretero Barrio, 
B. Pérez Mies
*H.U. Ramón y Cajal, Spain
Background & objectives: Microsatellite instability (MSI) is due to 
deficiency of the DNA mismatch repair (MMRd) system. The aim of 
this study is to define the optimal approach for MSI testing and to 
clarify discrepancies with MMR protein expression in immunohisto-
chemical analysis (IHC).
Methods: We selected 31 endometrial cancers (EC) with loss of 
expression of MMR proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2) to 
compare two MSI tests, Promega™ and Idylla™. Both recognize 
mutations in short sequences of specific genes (BAT-25, BAT-
26, NR-21, NR-24 & MONO-27 and ACVR2A, BTBD7, DIDO1, 
MRE11, RYR3, SEC31A & SULF2) to classify endometrial can-
cers as unstable (MSI-H) or stable (MSS).
Results: Loss of MMR proteins were distributed in 22 MLH1-
PMS2, 4 MSH2-MSH6, 3 MSH6, 1 PMS2, and 1 MSH2-MSH6 
& PMS2. With Promega™, ten EC were classified as MSS, five 
as doubtful and sixteen as MSI-H. With Idylla™, two EC can-
cers were classified as MSS and twenty-nine as MSI-H. Concord-
ance between molecular testand IHC were 51,6% for Promega™ 
and 93,5% for Idylla™. Concordance between Idylla™ and Pro-
mega™ was 58.1%. Four of ten MSS cases in Promega™ pre-
sented isolated losses of MMR proteins (3 MSH6 and 1 PMS2). 
The carcinoma with isolated loss of PMS2 was also MSS with 
Idylla™.
Conclusion: Idylla™ MSI assayshows higher sensitivity than Pro-
mega™ MSI analysis, in detecting MSI-H in MMRd EC. Promega™ 
misses isolated losses of MMR proteins. Probably, the selection 
criteria for MSI-H in Promega™ (more than one gene mutated) 
is the reason of the low agreement. The discordance between IHC 
and molecular tests could be explained by sample features, MSS or 
MSI-low cases with MMRd and because Idylla™ was developed 
to analyse MSI in colorectal carcinomas with different range of 
instability.

Ovarian teratoma associated with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate 
receptor encephalitis
K. Suh*, M. Yeo, S. Choi, K. Kim
*Chungnam National University, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 
(NMDAR) encephalitis is often accompanied by an ovarian tera-
toma. A prevailing theory suggests that generation of autoantibod-
ies to NMDAR on neurons in the central nervous system is trig-
gered by neuroglial tissue in the associated teratoma.
Methods: A 15-year-old female presented with a 6-days history of 
psychological symptoms of mental disorientation for time, person, 
and place. She had no history of medical or psychiatric problems. 
Brain computerized tomography (CT) results were unremarkable. 
A pelvic CT revealed a 3.0-cm, well marginated, heterogeneous, 
calcified mass in the right ovary with fat components. The patient 
underwent a right ovarian cystectomy.
Results: The cystic ovarian mass measured 2.4x 2.2x 1.8 cm in 
size. The cut surface showed multiple cysts filled with yellow-
ish gelatinous material and some hairs. Microscopically, the mass 
revealed a mature cystic teratoma showing foci of neuroglial tis-
sue with lymphoid aggregates containing germinal centres. Mature 
neurons were rare, but showed degenerative features including 
smudged nuclei, cytoplasmic vacuolation, and eosinophilic depos-
its. Astrocytes were focally hypercellular. Anti-NMDAR encepha-
litis associated with teratoma was considered. Cerebrospinal fluid 
was positive for Anti-NMDAR antibody. The patient suffered from 
paraneoplastic neurological syndrome, which included impaired 
awareness, dysphagia, slurred speech, and dysphoria due to autoim-
mune encephalitis. The patient slowly improved with a moderate 
residual cognitive defect.
Conclusion: Here we report a rare case of ovarian teratoma associ-
ated with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The presence of colocalized 
neuroglial tissue with lymphoid aggregates containing germinal 
centres and degenerative features within neuroglial tissue in ovar-
ian teratomas should be clinically considered as anti-NMDAR 
encephalitis.

Serous cystadenofibroma and mature cystic teratoma. A rare 
case of collision tumours of the ovary
G. Stanc*, E. Souka, N. Novkovic, L. Karelis, G. Vorgias, C. Vala-
vanis, H. Trihia
*Pathology Department Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Collision tumour is coexistence of adjacent 
neoplasms in the same organ without histological intermixing. Colli-
sion tumours have been reported in various organs but are relatively 
rare in the ovary. We report a case of coexistent serous cystadenofi-
broma and cystic teratoma.
Methods: A 39-year-old patient underwent salpingo-oophorec-
tomy. On macroscopic examination the ovary was replaced by 
a cyst measuring 7.5cm in greatest diameter with smooth outer 
surface. Cross section revealed two adjacent cysts. One cyst with 
sebaceous material, hair and a small solid nodule in the inner wall. 
The other cyst containing clear fluid, with a small papillary area 
2,5cm in greatest diameter.
Results: Microscopic examination of the wall of the ovarian 
cyst revealed a mixture of mature benign tissues, like strati-
fied squamous epithelium associated with keratinous material, 
dermal adnexa, respiratory epithelium, fatty tissue and bone 
marrow with medullary space. The adjacent cyst was lined by 
benign serous (ciliated/ cuboidal) epithelium. The small pap-
illary excrescences and the glands within the fibrotic stroma 
were also lined by benign serous epithelium. Based on the 
histological features a diagnosis of collision tumour of the 
ovary comprising a serous cystadenofibroma and mature cystic 
teratoma was made.
Conclusion: Various combinations of collision tumours of the 
ovary have been reported, although quite rare and with not well 
understood pathogenesis. They are only diagnosed post-operatively 
after histopathological examination and their recognition is very 
important as accurate diagnosis of each component is paramount 
for proper management, depending on the individual biological 
characteristics of each of the tumour components. In case of 
malignancy, the most aggressive component and stage of the 
tumour will determine the prognosis.

naeva, A. Asaturova
*FSBI «National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynae-
cology and Perinatology named after Academician V.I.Kulakov», 
Russia
Background & objectives: The Bcl-2 family proteins are well-charac-
terized regulators of the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway of apoptosis. 
In this study, using immunohistochemical approach we estimated the 
level of both pro-apoptotic (Bak, Bax, Bid, Bim) and anti-apoptotic 
(Bcl-2, BclxL) proteins in ovarian cancer samples.
Methods: The level of Bcl-2 family of proteins was estimated as 
Q-score that takes into account the intensity and percentage of 
positively-stained cells. The Q-score distribution of each protein 
was evaluated according to clinicopathological parameters such 
TNM stage, lymphatic invasion and tumour grade. The Wilcoxon-
Mann-Whitney non-parametric test and Spearman correlation was 
used for statistical analysis.
Results: In current study 58 cases of ovarian carcinomas were 
included. According with clinical and pathological data, 14 (24%) 
were classified as T1-2 (TNM classification), 44 (76%) as T3-4, 
and 42 (72%) were characterized as high-grade carcinomas. The 
Q-scores of Bcl-2 protein was significantly lower than Q-scores 
of other members Bcl-2 family proteins. Moreover, about 20% of 
tumours did not express Bcl-2 (Q-score was 0) in the epithelial 
component. The Q-scores of Bcl-2 were statistically significantly 
higher in T1-2 group than in T3-4 [p=0.007]. It was observed that 
the Q-scores of Bcl-2 was less in high-grade tumours [p=0.046], 
while the same parameter of Bim was higher in high-grade tumours 
[p=0.001].
Conclusion: Immunohistochemical analysis of the ovarian car-
cinoma samples demonstrated that Bcl-2 expression was signifi-
cantly lower than expression of other members of Bcl-2 family 
proteins and negatively correlated with the size and grade of pri-
mary tumour. These observations could indicate a suppressive role 
of Bcl-2 in progression of ovarian tumours.

wara, M. Mellouli
*Department of Pathology, Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, 
Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Granulosa cell tumours (GCT) of ovaries 
are rare neoplasms originating from sex-cord stromal cells. They are 
characterized by their long natural history and tendency to recur years 
after initial diagnosis. Our aim is to evaluate clinico-pathological find-
ings in Tunisian women.
Methods: We collected, during 11 years, 24 cases of adult GCT 
of the ovaries, diagnosed in the department of pathology of 
Habib Bourguiba Hospital within the period lasting from Janu-
ary 2011 to December 2021.
Results: Median age was 46,8 years. The most common symp-
tom was menorrhagia (11cases). Tumours median size was 14,6 
cm. Microscopically, microfollicular patterns were the most 
common patterns (13 cases). Call-Exner bodies were seen in 18 
cases. Moderate atypia were seen in 7 cases and marked atypia 
in one. Mitoses were ≥ 5 mitoses/10 HPF in 7 cases. Eight cases 
had necrosis. Immunohistochemically, Inhibin was positive in 
100% tumours. Three cases recurred after 3, 8 and 20 years. One 
patient was lost of sight. The two other had an incomplete surgi-
cal resection of the residual tumour with adjuvant chemotherapy. 
One patient had regression of the residual tumour. The second 
developed hepatic metastasis.
Conclusion: GCT are the most frequent hormono-secreting 
tumours of the ovary. They have a low malignancy potential 
and generally have a good prognosis. Mitotic index and residual 
tumour disease are the most valuable prognostic factors. 
Complete tumour resection should always be attempted. 
Chemotherapy can be effective in recurrent cases.

patients treated with hysteroscopically controlled injections of 
autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) and autologous endometrial

Results: PgR expression in successfully pregnant patients: in 
glands Me =300,0 (Q1-Q3: 267.5-300.0), stroma: Me =300,0 (Q1-
Q3: 267.5-300.0); in non-pregnant patients: in glands Me =300,0 
(Q1-Q3: 180.0-300.0), in stroma 297.0 (Q1-Q3 294.0-300.0), 
p=0.437 for glands, p=0.247 for stroma. ER expression in suc-
cessfully pregnant patients: in glands Me =300,0 (Q1-Q3: 260.0-
300.0), stroma: Me =300,0 (Q1-Q3: 240.0-297.5); in non-pregnant 
patients: in glands Me =297.0 (Q1-Q3: 230.0-300.0), in stroma 
294.0 (Q1-Q3 260.0-300.0), p=0.611 for glands, p=1 for stroma. 
CD34 expression in successfully pregnant patients: Me =3.0 (Q1-
Q3: 2.0-4.0); in non-pregnant patients: Me =4.0 (Q1-Q3: 3.0-4.0) 
(evaluated only in stroma). p=0.035.
Conclusion: We applied a novel approach for infertility treatment 
in patients with refractory thin endometrium. Injections of PRP 
into basal layer of endometrium facilitate the reconstitution by 
enhancing cell proliferation and angiogenesis. The effect can be 
predicted with CD34 expression in endometrial stroma which can 
help to stratify patients effectively before the treatment procedure.

Mixed ovarian yolk sac tumour with mucinous carcinoma and 
ganglioneuroma in a postmenopausal female: a case report
C.Y. Chow*, S.L. Wong
*Singapore General Hospital, Singapore
Background & objectives: Ovarian germ cell tumours in postmeno-
pausal patients are rare. They have a poorer outcome compared with 
those in young women. We report a case of mixed ovarian yolk sac 
tumour with mucinous carcinoma and ganglioneuroma.
Methods: A 55-year-old nulliparous lady presented with change in 
bowel habits and an abdominal mass was palpable on examination. 
CT scan revealed a multiloculated solid-cystic mass in the pelvis. The 
patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy and omentectomy. Mac-
roscopic examination showed a ruptured 20cm solid-cystic tumour 
replacing the left ovary, with large areas of haemorrhage and necrosis.
Results: The tumour comprised three separate components of differ-
ent lineages, namely a germ cell tumour (yolk sac tumour), an epithe-
lial tumour (mucinous carcinoma) and a tumour of neural crest origin 
(ganglioneuroma). The mucinous carcinoma merged with the yolk 
sac tumour, but was a distinct separate component as shown by their 
contrasting immunohistochemical profile. One of the postulations 
was that this tumour may be a mixed germ cell tumour with a com-
ponent of yolk sac tumour and a teratoma, from which the epithelial 
neoplasm and ganglioneuroma grew. The behaviour of this tumour 
appeared to be driven by the yolk sac component, as evidenced by 
metastatic disease composed solely of yolk sac tumour.
Conclusion: The prognosis of ovarian germ cell tumour in post-
menopausal women is poor, even for patients with early-stage dis-
ease. Our patient died of her disease at 6 months after diagnosis, 
which is in accordance with other similar cases reported in the lit-
erature. The rarity of germ cell tumour in postmenopausal women 
can cause initial diagnostic uncertainty to the unwary. It is impor-
tant to reach the accurate diagnosis as most of the cases have an 
aggressive clinical course.

Primary peritoneal psammocarcinoma: a case report and 
review of literature
I. Helal*, K. Ben Lazreg, F. Khanchel, S. Fkih, R. Hedhli, R. 
Jouini, A. Chadli
*Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Psammocarcinoma is a rare form of low-
grade serous carcinoma originating in the ovaries or the peritoneum. 
The primary peritoneal psammocarcinoma (PPP) is even rarer. We 
present a rare case of fortuitous discovery of a PPP and review of 
literature.
Methods: A 74-year-old woman was admitted to the surgery 
department to undergo cholecystectomy for gallbladder lithiasis. 
At laparoscopy, we discovered peritoneal nodules that were biop-
sied. Subsequently, a hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy and 
omentectomy were performed. Bibliographic research, using the 
term “Primary Peritoneal Psammocarcinoma”, was performed at 
Pubmed databases from 1990 to 2019.
Results: Biopsy’s pathological examination showed small epi-
thelial nests under 15 cells with low-grade cytological features 
invading surrounding structures with extensive psammomatous 
bodies. Pathologic examination of the later specimen revealed no 
invasion of the ovarian stroma. Our case fulfilled all the criteria 
defined by Gilks and modified by Chen et al for the diagnosis of 
PPP. The decision of medical staff was to complete by adjuvant 
chemotherapy after surgery. Up to date, fewer than 30 cases of PPP 
have been reported in the English literature. The mean age was 54 
years old, and the most common clinical presentation was an inci-
dental discovery. Most institutions recommend optimal debulking 
followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.
Conclusion: The PPP has morphologic diagnostic criteria that dis-
tinguish it from other epithelial serous neoplasms. The behaviour 
of this tumour is unclear, and the treatment is not standardized 
because of its rarity and lack of long-term follow-up. More cases 
need to be studied for better understanding and improvement of the 
management protocols.

Solid mature teratoma associated with gliomatosis peritonei: 
a case report
R. Rolim*, T. Resende, T.M. Cunha, F. Cunha, A. Felix
*IPO Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Portugal
Background & objectives: Gliomatosis peritonei (GP) is the presence 
of benign peritoneal implants of mature glia tissue, with unclear origin. 
It’s generally found in patients with immature ovarian teratoma. Less 
than 100 cases of mature ovarian teratoma with GP were reported.
Methods: We report the case of a 9-year-old girl with abdominal 
distension and pain. CT-scan identified an adnexal tumour with 
peritoneal dissemination. Alpha-fetoprotein and CA-125 serum lev-
els were: 42,56 ng/mL,165,2 U/mL. CEA and β-HCG were normal. 
A salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy and parietal peritoneum 
excision was performed. After 5 months of follow-up the patient is 
asymptomatic, without radiological disease or increased neoplastic 
markers.

Results: The specimen was 1737g and the ovary was replaced by 
a 21x17x10cm partly solid tumour, with capsular rupture. The 
specimen was extensively sampled with 2 fragments / cm. On 
histological examination the tumour was composed by tissue of 
all germinal layers, with areas of skin and cutaneous appendages, 
adipose tissue, cartilage, respiratory and gastrointestinal 
epithelium. No immature neuroepithelium or neurorosettes were 
identified. The fallopian tube and peritoneal nodules showed 
multiple foci of mature glial tissue, establishing the diagnosis 
of solid mature ovarian teratoma with GP. Peritoneal fluid was 
negative for neoplastic cells.
Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of a complete dif-
ferential diagnosis in a patient presenting with disseminated perito-
neal disease and increased serum levels of neoplastic biomarkers. 
Benign entities should be considered, such as GP in the context of 
an ovarian teratoma. Two main explanations are proposed for the 
origin of GP, being glial metaplasia and cellular spread from the 
teratoma itself. This case supports capsular rupture as the main 
event for GP, however further investigation is needed to clarify 
both mechanisms.

The role of mast cells in the morphogenesis of cervical cancer
A. Filin*, I. Sertakov, M. Popov, E. Verbitskaya, V. Shishkina
*Voronezh State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: Cervical cancer has been and remains 
one of the main trends in oncology, especially among people of non-
reproductive age. The role of mast cells in tumour oncogenesis is still 
unclear, including in cervical cancer.
Methods: The biopsy material obtained from 21 women between 
the ages of 25 to 74 years, exclusively with cervical cancer, without 
other pathologies of the reproductive organs. The mast cells stained 
with tryptase and chymase antibodies. Mast cells were analysed 
in the tumour and along the periphery of the tumour process. The 
degree of mast cell degranulation has been established.
Results: During the research we were trying to work out the corre-
lation between mast cells and some important morphological indi-
cators. We have studied the distribution of mast cells and the depth 
of tumour invasion, the mitotic activity of the tumour, severity of 
peritumoral inflammation. No correlations were found. It turned 
out that with an increase in the degree of differentiation (from high 
to low-differentiated), there was a tendency to decrease the number 
of mast cells. But this result was not statistically reliable either. 
However, the largest number of degranulated cells is located in the 
tumour itself, and not on its edge.
Conclusion: The relationship between the distribution of mast 
cells and the depth of invasion, mitotic activity and severity of 
inflammation was not revealed. Degranulation of MC occurs 
actively in the tumour, and not in the invasive edge. It is possible to 
continue the study of the role of mast cells in the morphogenesis of 
cervical cancer, but only taking into account the functional activity 
of mast cells.

Background & objectives: Recent advances in molecular biol-
ogy have allowed to define a new uterine sarcoma, with COL1A1-
PDGFB fusion and only 4 cases described in the literature. We 
describe the fifth case in order to provide more knowledge about 
this entity.
Methods: We are reporting the only case of uterine fibrosarcoma 
like neoplasm with COL1A1-PDGFB fusion diagnosed in our hos-
pital and describe clinical, radiological, histopathological, immu-
nophenotypic and molecular features. This is a 44-year-old female 
with no medical history of interest except for a dermoid cyst of left 
ovary operated 15 years ago.
Results: The exophytic tumour of the cervix observed in imag-
ing tests was biopsied and showed a malignant neoplastic prolif-
eration, treated with anterior pelvic exenteration and intraopera-
tive radiotherapy. Macroscopically, it was a big (6,5x5,5x3 cm) 
lobulated whitish lesion with fibrous consistency. Histologic 
examination revealed a spindle cell neoplasm with mild nuclear 
atypia, low proliferative activity and no necrosis. Immunohis-
tochemical stains were positive for CD34, CD10 and p16 and 
negative for epithelial, muscular and melanic markers, ER, PR, 
cyclinD1, DOG1, EMA, BCOR, SS18-SSX, STAT-6 and pan-
TRK. Gene fusion study (Archer FusionPlex Sarcoma Panel) 
identified COL1A1-PDGFB fusion, the final diagnosis being 
sarcoma with COL1A1-PDGFB rearrangement, AJCC Stage 
pT2pNxpMx.
Conclusion: There is a wide variety of uterine mesenchymal 
tumours whose understanding improved thanks to recent advances 
in molecular biology, that allowed to define a new group of uter-
ine fibrosarcoma like neoplasms. It includes a new entity with 
COL1A1- PDGFB fusion, with only 4 cases reported in the lit-
erature and not yet described in the WHO classification of female 
genital tumours. At the time of this work, our patient is doing well, 
waiting for a radiological examination and neovaginal dehiscence 
surgery.

Mrad, I. Zemni, I. Zidi

Faculty of Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is an 
enzyme acting as immune modulator through suppression of T-cell 
immunity. IDO is overexpressed in various cancers. This study aims 
to investigate the distribution of IDO expression in ovarian carcinoma 
and its correlation with clinic-pathological characteristics.
Methods: Twenty-one cases of ovarian tumours were enrolled for 
IDO immunohistochemistry. We studied both tumour tissues and 
adjacent normal tissues. Correlations between IDO expression and 
clinico-pathological parameters were also examined.
Results: The mean age of patients was 54 years. IDO was 
expressed in all tumour tissues and not in normal tissues (Mann-
Whitney test: p<0.0001). High IDO expression (Mean of positive 
cells=71%) concerned tumour size >50mm (Mean=116mm). Low 
IDO expression (Mean of positive cells=25%) concerned tumour 
size not exceeding 50mm (Mean=70mm). No difference in IDO 
expression was linked to disease characteristics, nor to metastasis 
(p>0.05).
Conclusion: Altogether, our preliminary results showed that IDO 
could be proposed as a candidate biomarker useful for the advance-
ment of ovarian carcinoma profiling.

Metastatic epithelioid trophoblastic tumour: a case report
G. Martins Pereira*, M. Araújo, J. Ferreira
*Instituto Português de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, 
Portugal
Background & objectives: Epithelioid trophoblastic tumour (ETT) is 
a rare form of gestational trophoblastic tumour and 25% present with 
FIGO stage IV disease. We report a case of a patient with stage IV ETT 
expressing programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-L1).
Methods: A 40-year-old woman presented with abnormal uter-
ine bleeding and recent weight loss. An MRI revealed a 4.3cm 
endometrial tumour. On biopsy, a diagnosis of undifferentiated 
carcinoma was suggested. Hysterectomy with bilateral adnex-
ectomy and omentectomy was performed. Pre-surgical β-HCG 
levels were not assessed and post-surgery β-HCG was 4.1mUI/
mL. Currently, 3 months after surgery, the patient is under adju-
vant chemotherapy.
Results: Gross examination revealed a white tumour invading the 
outer half of the myometrium and multiple small white nodules 
in the omentum. Histologically, the tumour showed a multinodu-
lar proliferation of monotonous medium-sized eosinophilic cells, 
arranged in strands and nests, associated with extensive geo-
graphic necrosis and deposits of hyaline-like material. The cells 
displayed eosinophilic/clear cytoplasm with round nuclei and 
small nucleoli. Neoplastic cells expressed keratins (AE1/AE3 and 
cam5.2), p63, GATA3, inhibin (focal), HPL (focal) and PD-L1 
(>50%). The cells did not express SMA, desmin, β-HCG, PAX2 
or PAX8. The proliferative index Ki-67 was 20%. A diagnosis 
of an epithelioid trophoblastic tumour with epiploic metastasis 
was rendered.
Conclusion: Epithelioid trophoblastic tumours most often 
present in FIGO stage I/II and treatment is therefore surgical. In 
the rare event of advanced disease, conventional chemotherapy 
has a low success rate. Since ETT often shows strong PD-L1 
expression, as seen in our case, a few case reports have showed 
a good clinical response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (such 
as pembrolizumab). Immunotherapy may prove useful in the 
treatment of metastatic drug-resistant ETT.

Histological particularities of pulmonary phyllodes tumour 
metastasis: a case report
I. Msakni*, R. Aouadi, N. Mansouri, F. Gargouri, M. Ben Thayer, 
K. Tlili, B. Laabidi
*Department of Pathology, Military Hospital of Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Phyllodes tumours (PT) are rare neoplasms 
accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancers. Malignant phyllodes 
tumours are likely to metastasize mainly to lungs. We, hereby, present 
an uncommon histological pattern of lung metastasis of a Phyllodes 
tumour.
Methods: We present a case of lung metastasis in a patient known 
to have a breast phyllode tumour.
Results: A 40-year-old woman with history of left mastectomy 
for phyllodes tumour three years earlier presented with a rapidly 
growing mass of the right lung. Chest-Tomography Scan showed a 
tumour of the middle lobe along with pleural infiltration. A lobec-
tomy was performed. Histological examination showed a mesen-
chymal proliferation entrapping ductal structures that showed to be 
bronchic lumens expressing TTF1 and not a ductal tumoral com-
ponent. The tumour cells were arranged in intersecting bundles. 
They had atypical spindle-shaped nuclei. Mitosis and mitonecro-
sis figures were noted. The tumour was highly vascularized. The 
diagnosis of pulmonary and pleural metastasis of phyllodes tumour 
was established.
Conclusion: PT are biphasic tumours composed of both stromal 
and an epithelial component. PT has an inherent recurrence and 
metastatic potential especially to the lung. Histologically, mesen-
chymal component may be the only pattern observed in metastasis 
site. That could be challenging for the diagnosis especially if no 
history of breast cancer is known.

Uterin spindle cell mesenchymal neoplazm, NTRK fusion-pos-
itive uterine sarcoma
B. Konuk*, C.S. Topal
*Umraniye EducationTraining Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Uterine sarcomas are a rare type of tumour 
with a wide range of morphological and genetic characteristics. Recent 
improvements in the genetic characterisation of these tumours have 
created a new clinicopathological category that includes NTRK-rear-
ranged uterine sarcomas.
Methods: In the hysterectomy material of a 52-year-old female 
patient with menorrhagia, a 5 cm diameter solid tumoral lesion 
was identified. When the histomorphological observations were 
combined with the immunohistochemical profile, the group of 
CD34,S100,Pan-Trk positive uterine spindle cell neoplasms was 
classified as NTRK fusion uterine sarcoma. The next generation 
of sequencing investigation found fusion between the NTRK1gene 
exon10 and the TPM3gene exon7 and junction regions.
Results: These neoplasms have a variably cellular and fibrosar-
coma-like appearance and are distinguished by generally homo-
geneous spindle cells with a scant cytoplasm. Atypia is usually 
mild to moderate. Mitotic activity is varied. Differential diagnosis 
includes high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma, undifferentiated 
uterine sarcoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour, COL1A1-
PDGFB fusion sarcoma, solitary fibrous tumour, adenosarcoma 
and malignant melanoma. In leiomyosarcoma-like uterine sarcomas 
that are desmin and h-caldesmon negative and lack ER and PR 
expression, if S100 and CD34 is positive, we recommend pan-
Trk immunostaining and if it is positive then molecular studies to 
screen for NTRK fusion for differential diagnosis and treatment 
options.
Conclusion: The importance of NTRK mutations in the devel-
opment of numerous solid tumours is increasingly recognized. 
Accurate identification of these rare tumours is critical for the 
treatment option of TRK inhibitors like Larotrectinib that is a pan-
TRK inhibitor. This case demonstrates the importance of consider-
ing newly defined NTRK fusion sarcomas in the histopathological 
evaluation of uterine sarcomas in terms of diagnosis and treatment.

Benign cystic mesothelioma: a rare case report
B. Konuk*, Ş. Çetin
*Umraniye EducationTraining Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Benign cystic mesothelioma is a mesoder-
mal tumour that covers the surface of organs such as the peritoneum, 
pleura, and pericardium. It is a proliferative neoplasm composed of 
mesothelium epithelial and mesenchymal cells.
Methods: A 31-year-old female patient presented to the gynaecol-
ogy outpatient clinic with inguinal pain. Ultrasonographic imaging 
revealed a 200*117 mm cystic tumour on the anterior abdominal 
wall. Total abdominal colectomy, low anterior resection, subtotal 
S264

1 3
pancreatectomy, splenectomy, cholecystectomy, partial bladder 
excision, visceral parietal peritonectomy, and ileorectal anasto-
mosis procedure were performed on the patient.
Results: Pathological investigations revealed cysts lined with 
epithelium covering the serosa of the abdominal organs. Many 
samples showed no evidence of invasion or atypia. Papillary 
structures were observed in very few areas. Calretinin, WT-1, 
EMA positivity, and moderate to weak expression of BAP-1 were 
observed in immunohistochemical studies. Desmin and P16 had 
weak expression in some areas. Also, there were endometriosis 
foci seen in the fibroadipose tissue between the cervix and 
the rectum. Cystic lymphangioma of the retroperitoneum, 
endometriosis, mullerian cysts, cystic adenomatoid tumours, and 
cystic mesonephric duct remnants are all benign lesions in the 
differential diagnosis for benign cystic mesothelioma. Malignant 
mesothelioma, serous tumours including peritoneum, and ovarian 
clear cell carcinomas are examples of malignant lesions that mimic 
benign cystic mesothelioma.
Conclusion: Our case was assessed in light of these potential diag-
noses, and immunohistochemistry tests validated our diagnosis. In 
the case of benign cystic mesothelioma, treatment choices range 
from conservative to full resection followed by hyperthermic intra-
peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). We wanted to discuss a case 
that we thought was similar to previous examples in the literature 
because of the endometriosis background, broad involvement, and 
repeated recurrence.

E-cadherin and ber-ep4 expressions in tubal ectopic and intrau-
terine pregnancies
C. Sönmez*, N. Koç, B. Kaya
*Haydarpasa Numune Education and Research Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
may have a significant role in tubal pregnancies. We aimed to evaluate 
and compare the expressions of e-cadherin as a hallmark of EMT and 
another adhesion molecule, Ber-Ep4, in tubal pregnancies and intrau-
terine pregnancies.
Methods: The study included 17 cases who underwent salpingec-
tomy for tubal ectopic pregnancy and 17 cases who underwent 
curettage for intrauterine pregnancy between 2019-2021. All 
blocks were stained immunohistochemically with E-cadherin and 
Ber-Ep4. Villous and extravillous trophoblastic cells, surface epi-
thelium and stromal cells in tubal and intrauterine pregnancies 
were evaluated according to their immunohistochemical staining 
intensities.
Results: There was a significant decrease in extravillous syncy-
tiotrophoblast staining in tubal ectopic pregnancies (p<0.001). No 
significant difference was observed in staining with E-cadherin of 
villous and extravillous cytotrophoblast, villous syncytiotropho-
blast, stroma and surface epithelium between tubal and intrauterine 
pregnancies. Ber-ep4 expression intensity was found to be lower 
in villous cytotrophoblasts in intrauterine pregnancies than tubal 
pregnancies (p=0.01).
Conclusion: Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a physi-
ological process in which cells lose their adhesion and undergo 
mesenchymal character such as migration and invasion. Decreased 
E-cadherin expression has been reported to be the hallmark of this 
cellular process. Ber-ep4 is known to be anti Ep-Cam which is also 
an adhesion molecule Although elucidating the underlying cellular 
mechanisms remains limited, e-cadherin may play a role in the 
development of ectopic pregnancy via extravillous syncytiotropho-
blasts and Ber-Ep4 via villous cytotrophoblasts.

Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC) of the uter-
ine cervix: unravelling its histogenesis
A. Coutada*, A.L. Cunha, C. Bartosch
*Pathology Department, Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto, 
Portugal
Background & objectives: Neuroendocrine carcinomas of the 
uterine cervix are very rare and often occur in association with 
other neoplasms. Herein we describe a mixed adenoneuroendocrine 
carcinoma (MANEC) of the uterine cervix, a very rare entity with few 
cases reported in the literature.
Methods: A 46-year-old woman presented with atypical glandular 
cells on cytology, followed by low-grade intraepithelial lesion on 
cervical biopsy, associated with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) 18. 
Conization was performed, with histological observation of the 
whole specimen and immunohistochemical study.
Results: Histological examination showed a neoplasia with two 
distinct components: an adenocarcinoma of usual type (predomi-
nant) with glandular and cribriform architecture and Silva growth 
pattern-B; and neuroendocrine carcinoma with a solid nested 
growth pattern with monotonous cuboid small-cells, oval nuclei, 
occasional eosinophilic granules, and 12 mitotic figures/2mm2. In 
the tumour periphery, the endocervical glands showed adenocarci-
noma in situ (AIS) and wedged between the AIS cells and situated 
along its basement membrane, there were many endocrine cells 
forming linear and micronodular clusters. Strong and diffuse block 
staining for p16 was found in both components. Chromogranin-A 
and synaptophysin were positive in neuroendocrine component.
Conclusion: Cervical MANECs are very rare neoplasms 
associated with high-risk HPV-infection. No conclusive studies 
addressed their histogenesis. They may arise from simultaneous 
proliferation of multiple cell-lineages or from a common stem-cell 
capable of differentiating along different cell-lineages. Molecular 
studies from lung and gastrointestinal tumours demonstrated that 
the two components are clonally related and thus derive from a 
common progenitor cell. Our finding of co-localized AIS and 
neuroendocrine precursor lesions also supports the common 
progenitor cell histogenesis in cervical MANECs.

Primary carcinoid of uterus. Case report and review of the 
literature
L. Berdica*, T. Bushati, E. Sukaj, A. Ndoja
*American Hospital, Albania
Background & objectives: Neuroendocrine tumours of the cervix 
are rare. Uterine carcinoids are distinct neuroendocrine tumours, 
representing a comparatively small percentage, 2% of them. These 
well-differentiated neoplasms are far less prevalent than small- and 
large-cell carcinomas, characterized by a more favourable biological 
course.
Methods: Endometrial curettage biopsy was performed first with 
the result of Endometrial Hyperplasia with Atypia. Total abdomi-
nal hysterectomy was performed and the result was an incidental 
Endometrial Carcinoid in the mucosa.
Results: Neuroendocrine tumours of the cervix are rare and often 
under- or misdiagnosed. Uterine carcinoids are distinct neuroen-
docrine tumours, representing a comparatively small percentage, 
2% of them. These well-differentiated neoplasms are far less prev-
alent than small- and large-cell carcinomas, characterized by a 
more favourable biological course. This study presents a case of 
typical carcinoid tumour of the uterine corpus in a 56-year-old

woman. The tumour was a primary carcinoid tumour arising from 
the endometrium which showed as a polipoid mass, with the typi-
cal organoid patterns with a positive reaction for neuroendocrine 
markers. No evidence for the carcinoid syndrome was noted. She 
remains free of disease.
Conclusion: Scant reports in the literature prohibit any reliable 
prediction of uterine carcinoid prognosis. Thus, prompt identifica-
tion of the disease and subsequent therapeutic intervention could 
alter the final outcome.

HER2 expression and mismatch repair status in endometrial 
clear cell carcinoma
S. Yilmaz Erozbek*, Z. Bayramoglu, I.A. Ozdemir, V. Ulker, B. 
Muezzinoglu
*Istanbul Medipol University, Pathology Department, Turkey
Background & objectives: High-grade endometrial carcinomas 
(HGEC) are difficult to classify. With the current use of HER2-based 
therapy in serous carcinoma, a diagnosis of CCC has the potential to 
exclude patients from receiving therapy. Therefore, we examined HER2 
expression in our CCC patients.
Methods: Immunohistochemically, HER2, ER, PR, HNF1β, Napsin 
A, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 were applied to 8 endometrial 
CCC cases diagnosed between 2016-2022. HER2 staining pattern, 
ASCO/CAP protocol used for breast was used.
Results: HER2 was positive in 3 of our 8 CCC patients (37.5%). 
While all of our HER2+ cases were Napsin A and HNF1β posi-
tive, MMR proteins were intact and ER and PR were negative. Two 
patients had wild type p53 and 1 patient had aberrant p53 staining.
Conclusion: The fact that 37.5% of our CCC cases were HER2+ is 
a finding with strong implications for the therapeutic approach. As 
a result of our study, in patients with CCC, if MMR is intact and 
ER-PR is negative, regardless of the p53 staining pattern, HER2 
testing may be an objective screening method for patients who are 
likely to benefit from HER-targeted therapy. Consequently, patients 
with a diagnosis of CCC can be candidates for future clinical trials 
of HER2-targeted therapy.

*Pathology Department, Salah Azaiez Institute; Research Labora-
tory LR21SP01, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The PD-L1 pathway role is still debated in 
gynaecological malignincies. We analysed PD-L1 expression in vulvar 
cancer by immunohistochemistry and its correlation with histoprog-
nostic factors.
Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in the Pathology 
Department of Saleh Azaiez Institute, involving 55 patients fol-
lowed for vulvar cancer over a period of 13 years, from January 
2008 to December 2021. Clinicopathologic data were collected 
from medical records and pathology reports. Immunohistochemical 
analysis was performed using an automaton (LeicaBiosystems™).
Results: PD-L1 expression in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma 
was observed in 44% of cases. This expression was noted in 11% 
of cases at the level of lymphocytes. Lymph node dissection was 
negative among all these cases with a maximum tumour size of 40 
mm. PD-L1 was expressed in tumour cells in 33% of cases. Among 
them, positive inguinal dissection was observed in 22% of cases, 
with a maximum tumour size of 90 mm.
Conclusion: PD-L1 expression was detectable in a subset of vulvar 
squamous cell carcinoma. Cases with PD-L1 expression on tumour 
cells showed less favourable histoprognostic factors, which sug-
gests its implication in tumour progression. The PD-1/PD-L1 path-
way represents a promising prognostic factor and therapeutic target 
that may optimize the therapeutic management of vulvar cancer.

Alves de Carvalho, D. Nunes Oliveira, G. Ferreira Morgantetti, G. 
Alencar Medeiros, G. Azevedo Silveira, G. Barbosa Torres Bitu
*University of Fortaleza, Brazil
Background & objectives: The vulvar fibroadenoma is a rare oli-
gosymptomatic benign nodular tumour. The most accepted theory 
about its origin is the failure of milk line regression in embryonic 
development.
Methods: This is a case report of a vulvar fibroadenoma in a 
40-year-old female patient with a vulvar ulcerated lesion that has 
not healed for 6 months.
Results: The patient reported a left vulvar lesion that had 
not healed for 6 months. Biopsy was performed, obtaining a 
fragment of skin at subcutaneous level. Macroscopy revealed 
a single hypochromic, elevated, asymmetric lesion with a 
regular border, with dimensions 0.7 x 0.7 cm in area and 0.5 cm 
thick. Microscopy showed glands in a lobular pattern similar to 
mammary tissue, with cystic changes and apocrine metaplasia. 
Compressed ducts were seen in the dense fibrotic stroma, similar 
to breast fibroadenoma. Without evidence of mitosis figures and 
other signs of malignancy.
Conclusion: The occurrence of vulvar fibroadenoma is 
extremely rare in the literature, there are about 60 cases 
described in the world. With this, there is a need to disseminate 
information about this pathology so that cases like this can be 
clarified. The case reported has aspects in agreement with those 
reported in the world literature, such as the patient’s age group 
and the characteristic of the lesion, which is elevated and has 
irregular edges.

A.G. Corradini, F. Rosini, D. Santini, A. De Leo
*Pathology Unit, University of Bologna Medical Center, Italy
Background & objectives: Malignant Brenner tumour is a rare ovar-
ian carcinoma. The presence of an associated malignant mucinous 
component is exceptionally reported. This study aims to describe the 
pathological and immunohistochemical features of a unique case of 
ovarian mixed malignant Brenner-mucinous tumour.
Methods: Clinical data and history were extracted from the 
patient medical records. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis and 
molecular characterization by Next-Generation sequencing were 
performed.
Results: A 65-year-old woman underwent surgery for a 5 cm left 
ovarian lesion. Gross examination revealed a partly cystic, multi-
loculated mass filled with abundant gelatinous mucinous substance.

Microscopically, the lesion was morphologically heterogeneous, 
consisting of a poorly differentiated transitional component (IHC: 
GATA3+, p63+) interspersed with areas of mucinous carcinoma of 
intestinal type (IHC: CK7-, CK20+/-, CDX2+, SATB2-, GATA3-). 
In addition, areas of borderline and benign Brenner tumour were 
present. The neoplasm was confined to the ovary. Molecular analy-
sis by NGS panel identified PIK3CA and TP53 mutations in both 
components. Patient is disease-free at 24 months after diagnosis 
and adjuvant chemotherapy.
Conclusion: Although benign Brenner tumours with a mucinous 
component are relatively common, the combination of a primary 
ovarian mucinous carcinoma with a malignant Brenner tumour is 
unique and has been exceptionally reported in literature. Integra-
tion of an adequate immunohistochemical profile and molecular 
analysis is crucial for a correct diagnosis.

An exceptional case of primary ovarian angiosarcoma
L. Di Sciascio*, A. Orsatti, D. de Biase, T. Maloberti, A.G. Cor-
radini, F. Rosini, D. Santini, A. De Leo
*Pathology Unit, University of Bologna Medical Center, Italy
Background & objectives: Primary angiosarcomas of the ovary are 
exceptionally reported neoplasms, some of which associated with 
mature teratomas. The aim of the study is to present the clinico-
pathological and immunohistochemical features of a case of ovarian 
angiosarcoma.
Methods: Clinical data and history were extracted from the 
patient’s medical records. An extensive immunohistochemical 
profile was performed together with molecular analysis by Next-
Generation sequencing panels and in situ hybridization.
Results: A 40-year-old patient, with a previous resection of ovar-
ian mature teratoma, underwent bilateral hystero-annessiectomy, 
omentenctomy, and peritoneal biopsy for a right ovarian mass 
suggestive for malignancy. Microscopic examination showed a 
high-grade neoplasm of predominantly undifferentiated appear-
ance with extensive areas of haemorrhage and necrosis. Tumour 
cells were epithelioid and spindle with marked pleomorphism and 
prominent nucleoli. Mitotic rate was of 3 mitoses/HPF. Peripher-
ally, the lesion showed abnormal vascular-forming endothelial cells 
associated with papillary-like projections. The immunohistochemi-
cal profile showed negativity for epithelial, melanocytic, sex-cord 
and muscular markers. Diffuse and strong expression of CD31, 
ERG and partial expression of CD34 and CD117 were present. No 
significant genetic and molecular alterations were observed.
Conclusion: Ovarian angiosarcoma is a challenging diagnosis 
that requires an accurate microscopic evaluation. Only few cases 
have been reported in literature. Histological features include the 
presence of undifferentiated and proliferating tumour cells with 
epithelioid and spindle appearance, associated with aberrant 
vessels and a marked CD31 positivity. It is also crucial to rule out 
all the other histotypes characterized by morphological overlapping 
(i.e. melanomas, carcinomas, sex-cord tumours and sarcomas).

Clinicopathological features of two ultra-rare cases of malig-
nant Perivascular Epithelioid Cell Tumours (PEComas) involv-
ing uterus
B. Rekhi*, S. Menon
*Department of Surgical Pathology/Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, 
Mumbai, India
Background & objectives: Malignant perivascular epithelioid tumours 
(PEComa) involving the uterine corpus are extremely uncommon 
tumours. Herein, we present clinicopathological features of two such 
rare cases.
Methods: Case1 A 62-year-old-lady presented with vaginal bleed-
ing. Ultrasonogram revealed a heterogeneous uterine mass. She 
underwent endometrial biopsy and total abdominal hysterectomy 
with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy(TAH-BSO), which revealed 
3.2 cm-sized proliferative tumour in the fundus.
Cae2 A 45-year-old-lady presented with recurrent abdominal pain. 
She underwent cytoreductive surgery twice with adjuvant chemo-
therapy for multiple tumours and TAH-BSO for uterine tumour, 2 
years back.
Results: Microscopic examination in both cases revealed hypercel-
lular tumours composed of markedly atypical, polygonal-shaped/
epithelioid cells arranged in nesting pattern with intervening blood 
vessels, containing eosinophilic cytoplasm, mitotic figures (≥6/10 
hpf) and tumour necrosis. Tumour infiltration was more than half 
the myometrial thickness in the first case with pelvic nodal metas-
tasis. The second tumour revealed rhabdoid-like and vacuolated 
cells along with scattered osteoclastic giant cells. Immunohisto-
chemically, both tumours were positive for HMB45 and desmin 
while negative for S100P and epithelial markers. The second 
tumour was also positive for SMA and TFE3. Both patients devel-
oped tumour recurrences. In view of multiple tumour deposits, the 
second patient was induced on m-TOR inhibitor everolimus.
Conclusion: Malignant PEComas involving the uterus are 
extremely rare tumours. An index of suspicion, based on certain 
histomorphological features, supported by immunohistochemical 
expression of myomelanocytic markers is necessary for a correct 
diagnosis. Certain PEComas display TFE3 positivity. A correct 
diagnosis has significant implications, including an aggressive 
clinical course and the possibility of targeted therapy, especially 
in recurrent or metastatic tumour settings, as observed in our sec-
ond case.

central Tunisian region
Z. Nfikha, N. Abdessayed*, S. Mabrouk, A. Bchir, Y. Fejji, M. 
Mokni
*Department of pathology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, 
Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Hydatidiform mole is defined as a partial 
or complete hydropic degeneration of the chorionic villi with vari-
able degree of trophoblastic cells proloferation. It is a heterogeneous 
group of rare and aggressive disease which evolution may be marked 
by malignant transformation.
Methods: we aim to investigate the clinical and pathological char-
acteristics of hydatidiform mole. This is a retrospective study of 
59 cases of hydatidiform mole. The cases were collected in the 
department of pathology of the Farhat Hached Hospital, Sousse, 
Tunisia over a period of 5 years [2016-2020].
Results: The mean age of our patients was 35 years. Metrorrha-
gia in a context of amenorrhoea was the most frequent revealing 
symptom (80%). BHCG levels were high in 100% of cases. Ultra-
sound examination was suggestive of molar pregnancy in 71% of 
cases. Endouterine aspiration was performed in 96% of the patients. 
Urgent hysterectomy was performed in two cases due to the abun-
dance of metrorrhagia. Histological examination found complete 
mole in 36 cases (61%) and partial mole in 23 cases (39%). The 
evolution was marked by transformation into invasive mole in 3 
cases (4%), confirmed on postoperative hysterectomy specimen.

Conclusion: Hydatidiform mole is real public health problem in 
developing countries. Ultrasound and elevated BHCG levels are 
reliable diagnostic tests. Microscopic examination allows the clas-
sification of hydatidiform mole into complete mole and partial 
mole. This distinction is sometimes difficult, hence the interest 
of a complementary immunohistochemical study using anti-p57 
antibodies. Early diagnosis of a degeneration into invasive mole 
or choriocarcinoma is based on close monitoring.

Z. Nfikha, N. Abdessayed*, Y. Fejji, A. Bchir, S. Mabrouk, M. 
Mokni
*Department of pathology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, 
Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Malignant mixed Mullerian tumours 
(MMMT) of the ovary, also called carcinosarcoma, are defined by the 
presence of a double epithelial and mesenchymal component. These 
aggressive neoplasms originate from the Mullerian derivatives of the 
female genital tract. The prognosis is very poor.
Methods: Ten cases of MMMT were collected in the department 
of pathology of the Farhat Hached hospital, Sousse, over a period 
of 10 years. The various data were collected from the medical files 
and the pathology reports. Immunohistochemistry was performed 
on 4 μm FFPE tissue sections. The antibodies used were cytokera-
tin, vimentin, desmin, h-caldesmone, myogenin and protein S100.
Results: Mean age was 53 years. The main symptom was pelvic 
pain. Tumour was bilateral in two cases with a FIGO stage of IIa 
in one patient, IIIc in three patients and IV in six patients. Total 
hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy was performed in eight 
patients followed by chemotherapy in seven patients. Microscopic 
and immunohistochemical study revealed the presence of a heter-
ologous component in six patients, this component was rhabdomyo-
sarcomatous in four cases and chondrosarcomatous in two cases.
Conclusion: MMMT of the ovary is rare representing 2% of 
malignant ovarian tumours. pathological examination is the key 
examination for the diagnosis and staging of these tumours. 
MMMT are histologically defined by the presence of dual-
component tumour, with a high-grade carcinomatous epithelial 
component and a sarcomatous mesenchymal component that may 
be homologous or heterologous. The heterologous component may 
be rhabdomyosarcomatous, chondrosarcomatous or, more rarely, 
osteosarcomatous. The prognosis is poor with a median survival 
of less than 24 months.

Vitamin E reduces the suppression of oestrogen receptors in the 
rat endometrium caused by exposure to heavy metals
K. Sikora, M. Lyndin, R. Moskalenko, Y. Lyndina, N. Hyriavenko, 
W.A. Awuah, V. Sikora*, A. Romaniuk
*Sumy State University, Ukraine
Background & objectives: The spread of heavy metals is directly 
related to the growing risk of uterine pathologies. Moreover, disorders 
of uterine hormonal sensitivity depend on pollutants combinations, 
concentration, pathways and exposure duration.
Methods: Female rats were divided into control (group I) and 
experimental groups. Experimental rats were orally treated by HMs 
(Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Cr) with (group III) and without vitamin E 
(group II) administration for 90 days. The immunohistochemical 
investigation was performed utilizing primary antibodies to ER 
(rabbit anti-ER Monoclonal Antibody – E115 clone).
Results: A strong (+++) positive nuclear ER immunoexpression 
was found in the majority of the epithelial (luminal and glandular) 
and stromal cells of the endometrium of control animals. In con-
trast, the level of ER-positive endometrial cells was significantly 
decreased (+) in HM-treated rats (group II). Herewith, vitamin 
E administration leads to a suppression decrease of ER expres-
sion (++) in the rat endometrium (group III), compared to the II 
experimental group. Moreover, the intensity of ER signal was also 
reduced in both experimental groups.
Conclusion: The prolonged influence of heavy metals leads to 
a significant decrease in ER expression and its intensity in rats’ 
endometrium. Vitamin E supplementation is accompanied by less 
pronounced changes in the generation of oestrogen receptors in the 
uterine mucosa in heavy metals-exposed rats.

Clinicopathological features of clear cell carcinomas of the 
uterus: a single institutional experience, India
N. Bhandari*, B. Rekhi, S. Chandwani, K. Deodhar, S. Menon, N. 
Mittal, J. Ghosh, B. Dash, A. Maheshwari
*Department of Surgical Pathology/Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, 
Mumbai, India
Background & objectives: Clear cell carcinoma (CCC) of the uterine 
corpus is an uncommon yet aggressive malignancy, with few studies 
evaluating its clinicopathological features, including none from our 
country. This retrospective study aims at analysing various clinico-
pathologic features of uterine CCCs.
Methods: Twenty two CCCs of the uterus were reviewed. Three 
cases were excluded. Remaining 19 cases were analysed for various 
clinicopathological features, including outcomes. Immunohisto-
chemical expression of Napsin A was graded as 1+(<10% tumour 
cells), 2+(10-60%) and 3+(>60% staining pattern. Age-range 
was 40-75 years(median=63). Thirteen patients had endometrial 
tumours, 5 had cervical and one patient had tumour in endome-
trium and cervix.
Results: Average tumour-size(n=15) was 4.5 cm. Stage-wise(n=7), 
patients had 1A(n=2), 1B(n=1), III(n=3) and IV(n=1) tumours. 
Most common histopathologic pattern was tubulocystic+papilla
ry(n=14,73.6%), followed by solid/hypernephroid(n=2,10.5%). 
Thirteen were pure CCCs, while six were mixed-types, including 
serous(n=4), endometrioid(n=1) and serous+endometrioid(n=1) 
components. Myometrial infiltration ≥50% was in 5/11(45.4%) 
cases and lymphovascular invasion in 4/16(25%) cases. Immuno-
histochemically, tumour cells were positive for Napsin A(19/19, 
mostly 2+/3+), ER(6/17, 35.3%, variable), PR(4/11, 36.4%), 
p53(n=15, wild-type=7, mutation-type=8), CK7(4/4) and 
PAX8(4/4), while negative for WT1(0/6). Therapeutically, 16/19 
patients underwent hysterectomy, including total abdominal hys-
terectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy(n=9, 56.2%); 
8 received adjuvant chemotherapy(CT)+radiotherapy(RT); 2, 
adjuvant RT, and one received adjuvant CT. On follow-up(n=9, 
median=6 months), 7 were free-of-disease and 2 were alive-with-
disease(recurrence=1, metastasis=1).
Conclusion: CCC of the uterine corpus is a rare tumour, mostly 
involved the endometrium. An index of suspicion based on certain 
morphological features, supplemented with Napsin A immunostain, in 
our settings, is useful for its exact diagnosis. Most cases were treated 
with surgical resection, followed by adjuvant therapies in some. Rarely, 
mixed patterns, including component of serous and endometrioid types 
co-exist, the former, associated with p53-mutation type expression.

Mucinous borderline ovarian tumours: challenging diagnostic
A. Fitouri*, G. Sahraoui, F. Ben daoued, O. Jaidane, L. Charfi, H. 
Arbi, H. Azaiez, N. Nassraoui, N. Boujelbene, I. Abbes, K. Mrad, 
R. Doghri
*Pathology Department, Salah Azaiez Institute, Tunis, Tunisia; 
Research Laboratory LR21SP01, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Ovarian mucinous borderline tumours 
(MBT) are characterized by an epithelial proliferation similar to those 
of well differentiated adenocarcinomas but are distinguished by the 
absence of stromal invasion. The aim of the work was to specify the 
pathological and clinical features.
Methods: Retrospective study including 49 cases of primary ovar-
ian MBT, diagnosed at the Patholgy Department of Salah Azaiez 
Institute from 1992 to 2019. We included in our study all patients 
who presented with a primary MBT on a surgical specimen. The 
collection of clinical data was made from the medical records.
Results: Median age was 48 years old. Histologically, the 
cases were divided into 34 cases of pure MBT, 13 cases with 
intraepithelial carcinoma and 2 cases associating an intraepithelial 
carcinoma with microinvasion. The majority of our cases were 
classified FIGO I and only one case FIGO III. Sixteen patients 
received conservative treatment and 30 received radical treatment. 
The treatment wasn’t specified in three patients. The prognosis was 
good in the majority of cases. Only one patient had a contralateral 
recurrence after a follow-up period of three years.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of MBT is difficult. Indeed, the 
distinction of MBT from carcinomas remains the greatest challenge 
for pathologists. Once this diagnosis is made with certainty, the 
tumour can be considered to have a good prognosis, especially 
stage I tumours which are the most common. Prospective and 
multicentre studies would be necessary for a better understanding 
of these tumours and their evolution.

The role of eIF signalling in benign proliferative disorders of 
the endometrium
T.S. Driva*, M. Sobočan, C. Schatz, J. Haybaeck
*First Department of Pathology, Medical School, National and 
Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: Adenomyosis, endometriosis and typical 
endometrial hyperplasia are common benign proliferative disorders of 
the endometrium that afflict many women with life-impacting conse-
quences. The aim of this analysis was to explore the impact of different 
translational markers on non-malignant endometrial diseases.
Methods: We assessed evidence on the expression of eukaryotic 
translation initiation factors (eIFs) in adenomyosis, endometriosis 
and typical endometrial hyperplasia compared to their expression 
in normal endometrium. We analysed the impact of deranged eIF 
expression on endometrial function and pathogenesis of non-malig-
nant neoplastic endometrial disorders. This database analysis was 
performed through PubMed and Google Scholar.
Results: Adenomyosis is characterized by dysregulation of eIF2 
and eIF4 signalling. The factors eIF4a2, eIF3K and eIF4b are 
expressed differently between adenomyotic and normal endome-
trium. Furthermore, decreased expression of eIF3e in adenomyosis 
and ovarian endometriosis tissue has been implied to promote EMT 
in these conditions via TGF-β1 or Snail activation. In addition, 
eIF2α signalling can serve as a treatment target for endometrio-
sis. Specifically, the progestin medication dienogest as well as the 
flavonoids naringenin and chrysin exhibit a suppressive role in 
endometriotic cell lines by activating eIF2α and thus enhancing 
endoplasmic reticulum stress. Moreover, eIF2α signalling seems to 
be involved in the pathogenesis of typical endometrial hyperplasia 
in PCOS.
Conclusion: eIF signalling is dysregulated in adenomyosis, endo-
metriosis and typical endometrial hyperplasia. The derangement of 
eIF2, eIF3 and eIF4 expression seems to contribute to the develop-
ment of these benign endometrial conditions and those eIFs may 
serve as druggable targets for these life-impacting diseases.

Collision tumour: a rare case report
B. Simsek*, E. Atik
*Mustafa Kemal University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Collision tumours are composed of two 
histologically distinct neoplasm in the same organ without intermix-
ture of cell types. We present here the case of a 79 years female with 
bilateral high grade serous carcinoma with mature cystic teratoma.
Methods: Microscopic examination revealed hematoxylin sections 
of the right and left ovaries, with cystic structure containing skin 
joints keratin hair follicles, tumoral islands with bizarre nuclei 
in large necrosis areas Bilateral fallopian tubes also showed high 
grade serous carcinoma. In the immunohistochemical study, tumour 
cells were stained positive with CK 7P53 and negative with CK20 
CDX2. Ki 67 proliferation index is 90%.
Results: Collision tumour containing bilateral serous carcinoma 
and mature cystic teratoma component is very rare entity.
Conclusion: Collision tumour containing bilateral serous carci-
noma and mature cystic teratoma component is very rare entity.

jelben, I. Abess, M. Ghaleb, R. Mchiri, N. Ben Hamida, K. Mrad
*Pathology Department, Salah Azaiez Institute, Research Labora-
tory LR21SP01, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The distinction of certain histologic sub-
types of high grade carcinomas is not uncommonly problematic, and 
as such, immunohistochemical study is often needed. We performed 
an overview of the histologic and immunohistochemical features of the 
different subtypes of high-grade endometrial carcinomas.
Methods: Retrospective study of 26 high-grade endometrial carcino-
mas collected in the pathology laboratory of Salah Azaiez Institute in 
Tunis over a period of 20 years. We selected the cases of high-grade 
endometrial carcinomas that couldn’t be classified based only on the 
histopathology and required complementary immunohistochemistry. 
We performed clinicopathology data collection which involved age, 
tumour size, histologic subtype and immunohistochemical data.
Results: The average age was 63 years old. Endometrioid 
carcinoma grade 3 represent 23%, serous carcinoma 27%, clear 
cell carcinoma 8%, carcinosarcoma 19% and 23% of cases 
were classified as high grade carcinoma. The most frequent 
immunohistochemical profile for endometrioid carcinoma grade 
3 is strong positivity for ER/PR, negativity to patchy positivity 
for p16, and wild-type p53 staining pattern. Serous carcinomas 
were mutation-type p53 staining, ER and PR variable postivity 
and strong p16 positivity. Clear cell carcinomas were negative for 
ER, RP, p16 and p53. Carcinosarcoma profile was focal CD10 
staining and negativity of cytokeratin, vimentine and caldesmone. 
Immunohistochemistry was inconclusive in five cases classified as 
high grade carcinoma.

Hamida, L. Charfi, K. Mrad, R. Doghri
*Pathology Department, Salah Azaiez Institute, Research Labora-
tory LR21SP01, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Endometrial carcinoma is an ever-growing 
gynaecologic malignancy worldwide. PD1/PDL1 immune checkpoints 
are among the important players of immunosuppression in the tumour 
microenvironment. We determined the level of PD1 and PDL1 
expression in the tumour environment and their impact on prognosis.
Methods: This was a retrospective, descriptive study of a series of 
46 cases of endometrioid carcinoma at the Salah Azaiez Institute 
collected between 2007 and 2017.
Results: Our series included 70% of postmenopausal patients. 
Stage I (45.6%) and grade 1 (41.3%) were the most dominant. 
Immunohistochemical analysis showed a higher expression of 
PDL1in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (26%) than in tumour 
cells (17%). As for PD1, this protein was expressed in 63% of 
cases. Statistical correlation revealed a correlation between PDL1 
expression and menopausal status (P=0.001 and P=0.014). Indeed, 
PDL1 expression in epithelial cells was positively associated with 
less than 50% myometrial invasion (P=0.037). However, no asso-
ciation was found between PD1 expression and histoponostic fea-
tures. We found that endometrial carcinoma has a heterogeneous 
immunogenic profile, which emphasizes the controversial role of 
PD1/PDL1 immune checkpoints in tumour progression.
Conclusion: PD1/PDL1 expression in endometrioid adenocarci-
noma is remarkable, without relevant association with prognostic 
elements. Future research on large cohorts may be useful to detect 
clearly the role of biomarkers in tumour progression.

Pregnancy luteoma: a rare lesion as an incidental finding. Case 
report
G.G. Yange Zambrano*, G. Moreno-De-Juan, M.d.M. Del-
Barrio-Molina, Y. Carreres-Ortega, J.C. Yange-Zambrano, H.G. 
Sarmiento-Moncayo, I. Gallego-Gutierrez
*Hospital Mateu Orfila, Spain
Background & objectives: Pregnancy luteomas (PL) are rare, non-
neoplastic proliferation of luteinized cells during pregnancy, forming 
single or multiple nodules in ovaries. Are thought to be caused by the 
hormonal effects of pregnancy. Most are asymptomatic and incidentally 
discovered during imaging or surgery.
Methods: 33-year-old woman in her second full term pregnancy, 
with gestational-diabetes, was admitted in obstetrics ward for 
occlusive placenta previa. The patient underwent caesarean sec-
tion. A female baby was born without complications. Intraopera-
tively, surgeons found right sided ovarian mass measuring 3,7cm, 
semi-soft, brownish. Suspecting that it was an ovarian neoplasm, 
unilateral oophorectomy was performed. The specimen was sub-
jected to histopathological examination.
Results: Macroscopic-examination showed an enlarged ovary 
measuring 3.7x2.5x2cm. Cut surface of the ovary was circum-
scribed, soft, fleshy, and gray-brown. Microscopically, the lesion 
showed well defined margin, with solid growth pattern of polygo-
nal luteinized cells with abundant amount of finely granular eosin-
ophilic cytoplasm, and frequently showed follicle-like spaces filled 
with eosinophilic-fluid. Nuclei were small, round, vesicular with 
prominent nucleoli, that did not contain stainable lipid. Occasional 
mitotic figures, without areas of necrosis. Reinke crystals were 
not found. Immunohistochemical-stains showed strong-positivity 
Calretinin, Inhibin-A, Melan-A; were negative for CKAE1/AE3, 
CKCam5.2, S100; and Reticulin enveloped clusters of cells. The 
final diagnosis of PL was made. Two years later the patient is 
asymptomatic and without recurrence.
Conclusion: PL is a rare tumour-like lesion mostly appearing 
in late-pregnancy, probably secondary to high-levels of human-
chorionic-gonadotropin, that will usually regress spontaneously. 
We present a case of PL detected incidentally during a caesarean-
section. It is important to bear this condition in mind, as it is 
rare and thus misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment may 
occur. The main-differential-diagnoses include Steroid-cell-
tumour, Luteinized adult granulosa cell tumour or thecoma, 
Juvenile granulosa cell tumour, Metastatic-carcinoma. The gross, 
immunohistochemical-staining, and reticular-fiber-staining results 
may help diagnose this disease.

Chemotherapy and breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutation 
associate with quantified tumour infiltrating lymphocytes in 
high-grades serous ovarian carcinoma
J. Machuca-Aguado, E. Rodríguez-Zarco, A.F. Conde, A. Gutier-
rez-Domingo, J.J. Rios-Martin, M. Idoate*
*University Hospital Virgen Macarena, Spain
Background & objectives: There is a controversy about the role of 
tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and BRCA gene mutation 
as prognostic biomarkers in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma 
(HGSOC). By this reason, we have evaluated the clinical significance 
of quantified TILs in HGSOC.
Methods: A series of 48 HGSOC III or IV staged (FIGO) cases 
were studied. H&E representative sections were evaluated in a 
blinded manner semiquantitatively and digitally using learning 
image analysis algorithms. Intraepithelial and stromal TILS in 
representative areas were selected. BRCA gene mutation was 
determined by next generation sequencing using Illumina platform. 
Statistical evaluation using SPSS software was applied.
Results: Morphologically, in tumours with neoadjuvant treatment 
a striking intraepithelial TILs infiltration was observed. BRCA 
gene mutated and neoadjuvant treated carcinomas cases were 
35% and 50%, respectively. Stromal TILs in both neoadjuvant 
treated and BRCA gene mutated tumours were higher than non-
neoadjuvant and BRCA gene mutated ones (p=0.038). Neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy treated carcinomas showed a higher number of 
stromal TILs than in non-neoadjuvant ones, although differences 
were not statistically significant. No difference of TILs density 
in mutated in respect with wild-type BRCA gene carcinomas was 
observed. The median of patient survival was 70 months, with no 
difference between mutated and wild-type BRCA gene mutated 
neoplasms.
Conclusion: Neodjuvant chemotherapy plus BRCA gene mutation 
produce a significant increase in stromal TILs density in HGSOC, 
but it has not relationship with survival. BRCA gene mutation has 
not been associated with a higher survival. We postulate a possible 
TILs recruiting effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on BRCA gene 
mutated tumours.

Carneiro Melo, J. Lima Galvão, A.C. Cardoso Fernandes, I.M. 
Araújo e Silva, J. Nascimento
*University of Fortaleza, Brazil
Background & objectives: Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare 
group of diseases that comprises a wide spectrum of diseases initially 
known as histiocytosis and there are few cases described in the litera-
ture on topography of the vulva.
Methods: Report case of 65 years old woman in the climacteric 
period, with a clinical history of long lasting vulvar burning and 
itching, combined with the presence of erytema and cracks, with a 
diagnostic suspicion of sclerosus lichen was submitted to a vulvar 
biopsy.
Results: The histopathologic showed an atypical cell proliferation 
at the submucosa, abnormal immature Langerhans cell prolifera-
tion rounded by eosinophils, macrophages and Birbeck granules. 
Immunohistochemical reveals positivity to CD1, CD68, Ki-67 and 
S-100 protein markers and negativity to AE1/AE3, CD138, CD20, 
CD3, CD30, Ki-1, CD45, HMB45, Melan-A, MPO, MUM 1 and 
SOX-10 markers.
Conclusion: LCH should be considered in the diagnosis of vulvar 
lesions and when it occurs in only at this site it has the potential 
for aggressive clinical behaviour, either as a local recurrence or as 
a disseminated disease.

Small cell carcinoma of ovary, hypercalcemic type: the syner-
gism of immunostains and molecular studies
S. Aviel-Ronen*, I. Schwartz, S. Caspi
*Sheba Medical Center / Ariel University, Israel
Background & objectives: Small cell carcinoma of ovary, hypercal-
cemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare tumour with typical immunoprofile 
and mutations in SMARCA4. Here we describe a SCCOHT case with 
unusual immunostain results. The combination of molecular studies 
and immunostains enabled the diagnosis.
Methods: The medical records, imaging tests, pathological find-
ings and molecular studies of the patient have been studied and 
are presented.
Results: A 12 years old female premenarche adolescent presented 
with abdominal pain. Pelvic US revealed enlarged ovary of 9 cm in 
diameter and oophorectomy was performed. Histological evaluation 
showed undifferentiated small round cell malignant tumour with 
positive staining for SALL4 (focally), MNF116 (focally), synapto-
physin, CD99 (diffusely), Fli-1 (diffusely), BRG1 (focally), SATB2, 
TLE1 and BCL1 with Ki67 of 80%. The stains for CD30, LCA, 
inhibin, SOX10, PLAP, OCT4, D2-40, CD117, AFP, myogenin, 
CD3, CD20, AE1/AE3, EMA, CK7, CK20, FOXL2, calretinin, 
myogenin, desmin, chromogranin, CD56, WT1 and NKX2.2 were 
all negative. Various FISH studies were negative for rearrangements 
but FoundationOne Heme test identified a mutation in SMARCA4 
(splice site 2438+1G>A).
Conclusion: A diagnosis of SCCOHT was made in spite of neg-
ative staining for WT1 and retained but attenuated staining for 
BRG1. It is the combination of elaborated immunostaining, FISH 
studies and extensive genetic analysis that brought to this rare diag-
nosis. As genetic studies become more prevalent, it is expected 
to note growing variability in gene expression for any described 
gene alteration, that should not exclude the related diagnosis. The 
synergism of the various available techniques is crucial for accurate 
diagnosis.

Transitional cell neoplasm in both ovaries with serous tubal 
intraepithelial carcinoma-like lesion, ovarian origin or 
metastases?
C. Ariño-Palao*, R. Meléndez Gispert, I. Carretero-Barrio, P. 
García Abellás, I. González García, E. Moreno Moreno, B. Pérez-
Mies, J. Palacios
*Ramón y Cajal University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: The ovary is the most common location 
of metastases in the gynaecological tract. Serous tubal intraepithelial 
carcinoma (STIC) is considered a high grade serous carcinoma 
precursor but metastases to the epithelium of the fallopian tube can 
mimic STIC.
Methods: We present a 64-year-old woman with history of neph-
roureterectomy and recurrent high-grade urothelial carcinoma of 
the bladder. A CT scan revealed a left ovarian mass suspicious of 
malignant primary ovarian neoplasm, so she underwent surgical 
staging including hysterectomy with bilateral salpingooophorec-
tomy and omentectomy.
Results: The left ovary (17cm) and right ovary (4cm) showed a neo-
plasm with a solid-transitional cell pattern. The left fallopian tube 
showed in situ epithelial proliferation with nuclear stratification, 
marked nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic figures and positive p53 stain-
ing resembling a STIC. Although the morphological appearance in the 
ovaries and fallopian tube was concordant with a high grade serous 
carcinoma, the differential diagnosis included metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma due to its previous history. Immunohistochemistry showed 
strong and diffuse nuclear staining for p53 but negativity for WT1. In 
addition, the tumour showed diffuse cytoplasmic positivity for CK7 
and CK20, p63 and GATA3, concordant with a metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma.
Conclusion: Urothelial carcinoma metastases to the ovary and fal-
lopian tube are extremely rare, with only few cases described in the 
literature. Diagnosis is not easy due to its resemblance to primary 
ovarian carcinomas with a transitional cell pattern. In present case, 
the presence of STIC-like lesions added difficulty to the recogni-
tion of the metastatic nature of the lesions. Therefore, the final 
diagnosis should be made based on the clinical history and the 
immunohistochemical profile.

Follicular lymphoma masquerading as Crohn’s disease. A case 
report with literature review
F.F. Cheo*
*Singapore General Hospital, Singapore
Background & objectives: While Follicular lymphoma (FL) is largely 
a nodal disease, it can be primarily extranodal, and mimic other neo-
plastic or non-neoplastic conditions clinically and radiologically. We 
report a patient with FL presented with a terminal ileal ulcer clinically 
mimicking a Crohn’s disease.
Methods: A 56 year-old man with no past medical history had 
positive faecal occult blood test upon screening in year 2017. 
A circumscribed terminal ileal ulcer was identified on colonos-
copy. Biopsy revealed an ulcer base and inflamed granulation 
tissue with no granuloma, infective organism or dysplasia.

Results: Patient subsequently lost in follow up and came back 
4 years later with another positive faecal occult blood test. The 
same terminal ileal ulcer with similar histological findings on 
biopsy were obtained. A clinical impression of Crohn’s disease 
was rendered after excluding infectious aetiologies. Computerised 
tomography (CT) scan showed enhanced, circumferential mural 
thickening in the terminal ileum with surrounding fat stranding, 
suspicious for neoplastic conditions. Right hemicolectomy was 
eventually performed 3 months later and disclosed a FL, WHO 
grade 2 and 3A, involving the terminal ileum, appendix, caecum and 
mesenteric lymph nodes, with an overlying ulcer and granulation 
tissue. No evidence of Crohn’s disease is identified.
Conclusion: The review of slides from previous biopsy proved 
no discrete evidence of lymphoma. The case re-emphasizes the 
importance of representative sampling for histological examination 
and interdisciplinary discussion.

del Rey-Rodríguez, J.R. Riera, M. Berríos-Hernández
*Department of Pathology, Central University Hospital of Asturias, 
SESPA, Oviedo, Spain
Background & objectives: Expression of CD5 has been described 
typically in CLL/SLL and mantle cell lymphoma, but also in a subset 
of MALT lymphomas. According to the literature, CD5+ MALT tends 
to originate in nongastric locations with an aggressive behaviour and 
disseminated disease.
Methods: We report a case of an 85-year-old woman previously diag-
nosed with ocular aggressive MALT lymphoma, with both parotids 
involvement and multiples lymphadenopathies. An Ultrasound Guided 
Minimally Invasive Autopsy (US-MIA) was accomplished. US Fine 
Needle Aspiration and Core Needle Biopsy of right orbital and parotid 
lesions were performed, and adequate material were sent to Flow 
Cytometry, Cytogenetic and Molecular Oncology laboratories.
Results: The gross autopsy examination showed tumoral lesions 
in both breasts, trachea, larynx, thyroid gland, oesophagus, right 
orbital and both parotids that were confirmed later in the microscopic 
study. All these lesions were morphologically identical, formed by 
small- to medium-sized cells with round to slightly irregular nuclear 
contours, dispersed chromatin, and a moderate amount of cytoplasm. 
The lymphoma cells expressed CD5, CD20, PAX5, BCL2 and were 
negative for CD10, CD23, Cyclin D1, SOX11, BCL6, MUM1, MNDA 
and LEF1. Moreover, molecular oncology reported a mutation in 
MYD88 gen, however our patient never debuted with high levels of 
IgM.
Conclusion: This case report is interesting for so many reasons: we 
describe a CD5+ MALT lymphoma with a disseminated disease at 
diagnosis, with mutation in MYD88 and an extraordinary aggres-
sive behaviour with a nule response to chemotherapy, causing a 
prompt fatal outcome to the patient. Besides that, the autopsy study 
was performed with an unconventional method: ultrasound-guided 
minimally invasive autopsy with subsequent Rapid On-Site Evalu-
ation -ROSE- of tissue to ensure an adequate specimen on site for 
additional studies and postmortem diagnosis.

Large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangement involving 
lacrimal gland: a case report
S. Na*, K.R. Lee, G. Choe, Y.K. Jeon, J.H. Paik
*Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Bundang 
Hospital, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rear-
rangement (LBCL-IRF4) is reported in the paediatric population, pre-
dominantly in tonsil and neck lymph nodes. We report a case of LBCL-
IRF4 in an adult female at an unusual location, the lacrimal gland.
Methods: A 34-year-old female presented with persistent epiphora 
on the left eye for two years despite antibiotics and conservative 
management. Computed tomography and dacryocystography 
showed a cystic soft tissue lesion in the proximal and distal lacri-
mal duct opening with duct obstruction with sac dilatation. Exci-
sional biopsy was performed. Grossly, the tissue was whitish, soft 
and friable.
Results: Microscopic examination revealed diffuse proliferation of 
large atypical cells with coarse chromatin, irregular membranes, 
and occasional small basophilic nucleoli with frequent tingible-
body macrophages and mitosis. Immunohistochemistry and EBV 
in situ hybridization revealed that the tumour cells were positive 
for CD20, Bcl-6, CD10 and Mum1 but negative for Bcl-2, cyc-
lin D1, c-Myc and EBV-encoded RNA, with no visualization of 
follicular dendritic cells by CD21 or CD23. Fluorescence in situ 
hybridization revealed IRF4 rearrangement by using an IRF4/
DUSP22 break-apart probe but not the c-Myc or Bcl-2 gene. No 
other involvement was observed in bone marrow biopsy, peripheral 
blood smear or positron emission tomography. The final diagnosis 
of LBCL-IRF4 was made.
Conclusion: LBCL-IRF4 is a rare entity recognized in the revised 
4th edition of the WHO Classification of Tumour. It manifests as 
diffuse, follicular or mixed architecture, making morphological dif-
ferential diagnosis challenging. As epidemiologic and pathogenetic 
information are limited, coexpression of CD10, BCL6 and MUM1 
should raise suspicion of LBCL-IFR4. Even with unusual extran-
odal sites and age, IRF4/DUSP22 FISH may lead to the accurate 
diagnosis of LBCL-IRF4.

Research Program through the National Research Founda-

HHV8-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), NOS 
- a case report and review of the literature
O. Tzaida*, E. Souka, G. Galanopoulos, M. Terzi, L. Karelis, M. 
Dadakaridou
*Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: HHV8-positive DLBCL NOS, usually 
arising in association with Multicentric Castleman Disease (MCD) 
and originating from a naive IGM lambda-positive B cell, is a rare neo-
plasm with characteristic plasmablastic morphology. A case of HHV8-
positive DLBCL, NOS associated with MCD is presented.
Methods: A 74-year-old male patient with history of MCD was 
admitted with worsening constitutional symptoms (fever, fatigue, 
loss weight), enlarging of cervical lymph nodes and massive sple-
nomegaly. Laboratory findings included severe anaemia, neutro-
penia, thrombocytopenia, hypergammaglobulinaemia and elevated 
C-reactive protein. A right cervical lymph node, measuring 1cm at 
maximum diameter, was excised.
Results: Histopathological examination revealed effacement of 
lymph node by a lymphoid neoplasm consisting of large, plas-
mablastic cells coalescing to large aggregates. Tumour cells had

amphophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli. 
The mitotic activity was high. Few follicles with atrophic hya-
linized germinal centres, “onion skin”mantle zones and promi-
nent endothelial venules, a morphology typical of CD, remained. 
The differential diagnosis included HHV8-positive DLBCL, 
NOS and HHV8-positive germinotropic lymphoproliferative 
disorder(GLPD). On immunohistochemical examination the plas-
mablastic cells had a LCA+, CD20+, CD138+, MUM1+,HHV-8+ 
phenotype with lambda light chain restriction and cIGM strong 
expression. ISH for EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) was nega-
tive. The morphological and immunohistochemical results estab-
lished the diagnosis of HHV8-positive DLBCL, NOS.
Conclusion: HHV8-associated lymphoproliferative disorders 
include MCD, HHV8-positive DLBCL, NOS (EBV-negative usu-
ally), and HHV8+ germinotropic lymphoproliferative disorder 
(GLPD) (EBV-positive usually). GLPD patients are asympto-
matic and have a favourable response to chemotherapy or radia-
tion, whereas HHV8+ DLBCL is associated with poor progno-
sis. HHV8+ DLBCL patients in association with MCD usually 
experience a severe immunodeficiency. The disease, under these 
circumstances, has an aggressive course. Our patient, a week after 
the diagnosis, succumbed to his disease.

Hidden mantle cell lymphoma
T. Lakic*, M. Šunjević, A. Ilic, A. Lovrenski, B. Krajnovic, M. 
Panjković
*Faculty of Medicine University of Novi Sad, Serbia
Background & objectives: Adenocarcinoma is the most common prostatic 
malignancy where clinical management, Gleason score (GS) and cancer 
staging (WHO/ISUP) play critical role in. Mantle cell lymphoma originates 
from malignant transformed B-lymphocytes of lymph follicle outer edge, 
with pathognomonic overexpression of CD5/Cyclin D1.
Methods: Tissue specimens were H&E stained and analysed, 
as well as immunohistochemical biomarker panel for lymph 
nodes. Performing serial cuts, gross examination showed homog-
enous appearance of many nodes that were white to greyish, 
with soft consistency and in different diameters. The prostate 
was enlarged, measured 6x5x2.5 cm and mostly homogenous in 
appearance, some spongy consistency and no visible defects dur-
ing grossing.
Results: A 68-year-old male was referred to our tertiary care 
institution for elective radical prostatectomy due to previously 
diagnosed adenocarcinoma performing prostatic core needle 
biopsy. Having performed a thorough histological examination, 
diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma with Gleason score 
3+4=7, ISUP GG2, was set. Microscopic analysis of lymph 
nodes were with no metastatic deposits, but unexpected, lymph 
node architecture was disturbed due to diffuse small lymphoid 
cell proliferation, with irregular nuclei, wide mantle zone and 
hyalinized blood vessels. After using immunohistochemical 
staining, it was shown expression for CD20/CD5/CyclinD1/Bcl-2 
and negativity for CD3/CD10/Bcl-6 with proliferative index up 
to 20%, so additional diagnosis was set, and it was non-Hodgkin 
mantle B-cell lymphoma.
Conclusion: A prostatic adenocarcinoma can extremely rarely be in a 
coexistence with undiagnosed lymphoproliferative disease, such as non 
Hodgkin mantle cell lymphoma in our case. This lymphoma is usually 
synchronously present with plasma cell dyscrasia or granulomatous 
diseases such as sarcoidosis. It can also occur with metastasis from a 
different anatomical site, but in the same lymph node. This case indi-
cates that extensive and detailed lymph node examination is necessary 
in order to prevent underdiagnosed lymphoproliferations.

A rare case of an Epstein-Bar virus positive mucocutaneous 
ulcer in the rectum of an HIV positive patient. A case presenta-
tion and review of literature
A. Irfan*, V. Mateescu, K. Lankachandra
*University of Missouri Kansas City, USA
Background & objectives: Epstein-Bar Virus positive mucocutane-
ous ulcers (EBVMCU) affect mucosal and cutaneous surfaces, rarely 
involving the rectum. We present a case of a rectal ulcer in a 40-year-
old HIV positive male who complained of severe rectal pain radiating 
to his thighs.
Methods: Examination under anaesthesia identified a rectal ulcer 
that was biopsied. The tissue biopsy was stained with Hematoxylin 
and Eosin. Following initial evaluation, additional stains including 
Pan-Keratin, SOX-10, MART-1, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD10, CD15, 
CD20, CD30, CD79a, Ki-67, MUM-1, PAX-5, EBV (EBER), 
OCT-2, BOB-1, HSV I, HSV II, CMV and GMS were performed. 
Literature review was done using PubMed.
Results: The histomorphology of the lesion demonstrated a 
mucosal ulcer and nodular aggregates of inflammatory cells com-
posed of small lymphocytes, eosinophils, granulocytes, plasma 
cells and histiocytes with scattered large atypical lymphoid cells 
morphologically mimicking Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg-like cells. 
These cells were positive for EBV (EBER), CD30, MUM-1 and 
BCL-6. PAX 5, BOB1 and OCT-2 showed weak positivity. The 
cells were negative for CD15, CD20 and CD79a. Based on the 
histomorphology and immunohistochemical staining pattern, a dif-
ferential diagnosis of EBVMCU versus mixed-cellularity classic 
Hodgkin lymphoma was entertained. The clinical history of HIV-
positivity, the absence of lymphadenopathy and a reduced CD4/
CD8 ratio led to the final diagnosis of EBVMCU.
Conclusion: EBVMCU, a relatively new entity, is associated with 
advanced age, iatrogenic immunosuppression, HIV/AIDs and post-
transplant therapy. While EBVMCUs mimic malignancy, their 
indolent course typically results in spontaneous regression. The 
median age is >70-years. Per PubMed search, EBVMCUs primar-
ily involve the oropharynx (69.3%) and cutaneous surfaces. Out of 
186 cases reviewed only 3 showed rectal involvement (1.6%). It is 
important to keep EBVMCU in mind in isolated classic Hodgkin 
lymphoma-like disease, even in younger patients, especially if they 
are immunocompromised.

ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL): our 
experience. Inter-observer variation in the interpretation of 
ALK immunohistochemistry staining
M. Ortiz*, M. Veras, E. Revilla, E. Conde, C. Bárcena, I. Gal-
lego-Gutierrez, J. Jiménez
*Hospital universitario Doce de Octubre, Spain
Background & objectives: ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lym-
phoma (ALCL) is a rare T-cell lymphoma. We aim to characterize its 
clinical and histological features, and to analyse inter-observer varia-
tion in evaluation of ALK expression patterns, which correlates with 
different fusion partner genes.
Methods: This is a retrospective, descriptive report of ten cases 
diagnosed in the last ten years in the Hospital Doce de Octubre. 
Patients’ characteristics, such as age and gender, and clinical 
and histopathological data were subtracted from patients’ medi-
cal records and analysed. Furthermore, ALK immunohistochem-
istry staining patterns were re-evaluated by three pathologists 
and inter-observer variation was established using the kappa 
coefficient.

Results: 70% (n=7) of ALK+ ALCL are men, and only 20% 
(n=2) are children (<18y). 80% (n=8) were diagnosed at an 
advanced stage (Ann-Arbor staging III-IV), involving nodal and 
extranodal sites in 60% (n=6), and limited to nodal compart-
ments in 3 cases (30%). 40% (n=4) had bone marrow involve-
ment, and 30% (n=3) presented hemophagocytic syndrome. Upon 
follow-up, survival rate is 70% (n=7). 100% of cases are CD30+. 
Morphological patterns and immunohistochemistry markers were 
reviewed. Moreover, molecular tests (FISH) for ALK were con-
ducted in two cases. Inter-observer agreement regarding ALK 
staining pattern was low with a kappa coefficient of 0,197 (CI 
95% -0,135-0,520, p value: 0,127).
Conclusion: For the majority of the variables analysed, 
our findings agree with cur rent knowledge. ALK 
immunohistochemistry is useful for diagnosis, but there is high 
inter-observer variability in the assessment of ALK staining 
patterns; thus, molecular testing may be advisable in order to 
characterize the genetic alterations. These findings should be 
consolidated on future studies with a larger sample size and a 
higher number of observers.

Splenic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated inflammatory 
pseudotumour (IPT)
E. Vázquez*, L. Molina, A. Sabio González, R.J. Luque Barona
*Complejo Hospitalario de Jaén, Spain
Background & objectives: IPT is a rare lesion that is composed of 
variable proportion of spindle cells, which can express myofibroblastic 
or follicular dendritic cell (FDC) markers, interpersed with polymor-
phous inflammatory cellularity. Splenic IPT associated with EBV infec-
tion can be a diagnostic challenge.
Methods: We report the case of a 63-year-old male, with abdomi-
nal pain and clinical suspicion of chronic cholecystitis. His initial 
work up revealed two well-demarcated hypodense solid lesion in 
his spleen, with abnormally uptake on CT scan, raising suspicion 
for malignancy. The patient underwent a diagnostic splenectomy.
Results: The histopathological evaluation revealed 4 nodular 
lesions, with a bland spindle cell population (SMA/LMP-1/
EBER+; ALK/CD21/CD23-) associated with a mixed cellular 
infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes and 
scattered eosinophils. We also identified multiple non necrotiz-
ing granulomas, with multi-nucleated giant cells and foreign 
body reaction. The histological findings were compatible with a 
diagnosis of splenic inflammatory pseudotumor associated with 
EBV infection.EBV associated IPTs are slow growing masses that 
are usually seen in liver, spleen and, less frecuently, in lymph 
nodes.
Conclusion: Splenic IPT-like FDC tumours and EBV+IPTs with-
out expression of FDC markers are 2related entities that have in 
common that the spindle cell is the one infected by EBV.Both 
are considered low-grade malignant lesions, possibly of mesen-
chymal origin capable of differentiating along different pathways 
(some will show myofibroblastic phenotype with positive for 
SMA, while others will acquire FDC characteristics and CD21+). 
In contrast to splenic conventional EBV-negative IPT (which is 
considered a benign entity) total splenectomy is the main treat-
ment for this pathology.

A case of multicentric Castleman’s disease mimicking non-
Hodgkin lymphoma: when splenectomy is diagnostic and 
therapeutic
D. Marchiori*, L. Campiotti, F. Sessa, S. Uccella
*Dept. of Medicine and Surgery, University of Insubria, Varese, 
Italy
Background & objectives: Castleman’s disease encompasses a group 
of disorders with well-defined histological features. Non-specific symp-
toms can mimic a wide variety of conditions. We describe a multicen-
tric Castleman’s disease diagnosed on splenectomy with a complete 
response after 6 years of follow up.
Methods: A 65-years old man experienced B-symptoms. 
Laboratory examination revealed anaemia, monoclonal 
gammopathy, splenomegaly and small deep lymphadenopathies. 
The patient underwent splenectomy with diagnostic purposes. 
After the pathological examination, a diagnosis of HHV8-related 
multicentric Castleman’s disease was made, R-COP (Pituximab, 
Cyclophosphamide sulphate, Vincristine and Prednisolone) 
chemotherapy was administered, and complete remission was 
obtained. The patient is disease-free after 6 years.
Results: Splenic localization of Castleman’s disease is rare. 
To date, three unicentric Castleman’s disease involving the 
spleen (Lee, 2015; Taura, 2000; Kujat, 1990) and three cases 
involving accessory spleen (Sakaguchi, 2005; Sbrana, 2017; Al 
Rasheed, 2018) have been described. Splenectomies performed 
for splenomegaly associated with B-symptoms are anedoctical 
(Levo, 1987; Carr, 2002; Han, 2008; Mantas, 2016) and only 
four cases of Castleman’s disease were foun in these studies. 
The association of splenectomy and high-dose chemotherapy, 
which was never described before, attenuates symptoms and pre-
vent relapses; our patient did not develop either HHV8-related 
neoplasm or relapsing of Castleman’s disease after R-COP treat-
ment and blood analysis resulted normalized after splenectomy.
Conclusion: We describe a case of Castleman’s disease 
successfully treated with splenectomy and R-COP. Although 
splenomegaly alone is not a typical manifestation, in symptomatic 
patients with splenomegaly, splenectomy represents a diagnostic 
and therapeutic procedure alternative to lymphadenectomy.

Auer rod-like inclusions in B lymphoblastic leukaemia: a diag-
nostic quandary for the morphologist
I.P. Thayakaran*, J. Sawhney
*Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, India
Background & objectives: Auer rods are diagnostic of myeloid dif-
ferentiation with a compatible blast morphology. Albeit rare, auer rod-
like inclusions(ARLI) can be seen in other hematopoietic neoplasms. 
Here we report a rare case of ARLI in B lymphoblastic leukaemia with 
review of literature.
Methods: A comprehensive workup of the current case was 
undertaken along with literature search using the keywords ’auer 
rod-like inclusions’ and ’lymphoblastic leukaemia’. Only few 
case reports have been published till date. All cases showed a 
B-lymphoblast immunophenotype. The clinicomorphological and 
immunophenotypic data were analysed and compared with our 
case.
Results: 70-year-old male presented with pancytopenia. Periph-
eral blood showed pancytopenia with absent blasts. Bone marrow 
aspirate revealed numerous blasts with azurophilic needle shaped 
inclusions and few obscuring the nucleus. The nuclear morphology 
showed coarse granular chromatin with occasional nucleoli connot-
ing a lymphoblastic origin. The inclusions were negative for Sudan 
Black B and periodic acid-schiff. Flow cytometry showed 82% 
gated blasts expressing CD79a, CD19, CD20, CD10, TdT, CD34, 
HLA-DR and negative for MPO, CD15, CD13, CD117, CD33,

CD14, CD7 and CD3. Immunohistochemistry confirmed CD20, 
CD10, CD19, TdT, CD34, PAX5 positivity and MPO, CD117, 
CD5, CD3 negativity. Findings were consistent with B-lympho-
blastic leukaemia. (Comparison table with prior case reports in 
final submission)
Conclusion: B-lymphoblasts with ARLI can be misleading and 
can lead to an erroneous diagnosis of myeloid leukaemia which 
might alter the management algorithm in a resource limited or an 
emergency on call setting where morphology is heavily relied upon. 
Although rare, the finding of ARLI does not preclude the diagno-
sis of lymphoblastic leukaemia and underscores the importance of 
comprehensive immunophenotypic workup aiding in an accurate 
diagnosis and reflex molecular testing resulting in optimal patient 
management.

Multiple small bowel perforations: an aggressive haematologi-
cal cause
R. Rana*, H. Maddumage, J. Warnick, I. Bagwan
*Royal Surrey County Hospital, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Small bowel perforation as clinical 
presentation is seen in inflammatory bowel disease, tuberculosis, 
ischemia, obstruction and malignancy. Here we discuss a case of 
extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma presenting as multiple small bowel 
perforations.
Methods: Clinicopathological analysis of a case presenting with 
multiple small bowel perforations.
Results: A 68-year-old male who presented to emergency depart-
ment with abdominal pain. CT scan revealed multiple small bowel 
perforations. A segmental jejunectomy and ileectomy was per-
formed. Histology confirmed perforations with presence of atypi-
cal large lymphoid cells involving the entire bowel wall. These 
atypical cells were positive for CD3, CD56, CD2 (weak), Bcl2 
(weak), Granzyme B and EBV (EBER-ISH). Molecular analysis 
was negative for specific mutations. A diagnosis of extra nodal 
high-grade NK/T cell lymphoma was offered. Subsequent PET scan 
done revealed a nasal mass. Unfortunately, the patient died in a few 
days following the surgery and biopsy of the nasal mass could not 
be performed.
Conclusion: Small bowel perforations can occur in variable com-
mon clinical conditions. This case highlights the importance of 
thorough morphological and immunohistochemical analysis 
required in recognising unusual causes such as NK/T cell lym-
phoma of small bowel causing perforations. Awareness of such 
entities amongst general physicians and surgeons would be ben-
eficial in clinical practice as these patients present with advanced 
disease and have poor outcome.

Acute myeloid leukaemia presenting with an acute fibrinous 
and organizing pneumonia
J. Filipe*, E. Dutra
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Instituto Português de Oncologia 
de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Lisbon, Portugal
Background & objectives: Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumo-
nia (AFOP) is an unusual histologic pattern of lung injury. In acute 
myeloid leukaemia, pulmonary injury is mostly due to infection or 
other malignancies. We report a case of acute monoblastic leukaemia 
(AML) presenting as AFOP.
Methods: Patient history was collected from the clinical files and 
histologic samples were reviewed. PubMed search for similar cases 
in the English literature was performed.
Results: A 56-year-old-man presented with marked asthenia. 
Blood tests showed anaemia, leukopenia, and elevated PCR. An 
angio-CT-scan revealed peripheral consolidations on the left 
lung. The patient was hospitalized in the context of a commu-
nity-acquired pneumonia and bicytopenia of unknown aetiology. 
Bone marrow workup revealed an AML. During hospitalization, 
despite multiple antibiotic cycles, he had persistent fever which 
delayed the beginning of chemotherapy. Blood and bronchoalveo-
lar lavage cultures were negative. A follow-up CT-scan showed 
bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. A lung biopsy was performed and 
a diagnosis of AFOP was rendered, after which corticotherapy 
was instituted with imagiological improvement. Treatment for 
the AML was also initiated and the patient currently awaits bone 
marrow transplant.
Conclusion: Pulmonary manifestations of acute myeloid leukaemia 
are usually misinterpreted as infectious disease, undergoing multi-
ple antibiotics without clinical improvement. This report increases 
awareness of this unusual manifestation, enabling correct diagnosis 
and treatment whilst avoiding unnecessary delays in chemotherapy.

Composite mantle cell and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
J. Filipe*, M. Rito, A.F. Ferreira, P. Gameiro, J. Cabeçadas
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Instituto Português de Oncologia 
de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Lisbon, Portugal
Background & objectives: Composite lymphoma is the presence of 
two or more different subtypes of lymphoma in the same organ. We 
describe a rare case of a composite mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), along with literature review.
Methods: The clinical history was obtained from the clinical file. 
FISH complemented histological diagnosis for CCND1. IGH and 
IGK gene rearrangement analysis was based on PCR and Genescan-
ning using the BIOMED-2 protocols. A PubMed search for similar 
cases was performed.
Results: A 77-year-old-man presented with a cervical mass. CT-
scan revealed a large lymph node (LN), and also submandibular, 
mediastinal and lombo-aortic. An excised cervical LN showed 
two distinct B-cell populations: large-cells with necrosis, BCL6+, 
MUM1+, BCL2+, and MYC+; and small-cells, CD5+, CCND1+, 
SOX11+. Both were CD3-, CD10-, CD23-, EBER-. A CCND1 
break by FISH was present only in the small-cell population. After 
macrodissection, IGH and IGK PCR-based analysis was in agree-
ment with the presence of two clonal populations. A diagnosis of 
a composite MCL and DLBCL was made. PET-CT scan revealed 
FDG-avid lymphadenopathies above and below the diaphragm. 
Only MCL was found on the bone marrow. The patient is under 
R-CHOP.
Conclusion: Composite lymphomas are interesting models for 
lymphomagenesis understanding, and to our knowledge, this is 
the fifth described case of a composite MCL/DLBCL. All cases 
in the literature are male patients, one corresponding to a primary 
testicular lymphoma. Excisional biopsy is imperative for diagnosis 
since a FNAC may miss one of the components. The presence of 
two morphological, immunohistochemical and genetically different 
cell populations, suggests two independent lymphomas as opposed 
to the unlikely transformation of MCL.

Testicular plasmacytoma. A case report and correlation with 
imaging findings
E. Baliou*, E. Psychogiou, P. Megas, D. Riga, K. Papadopoulou, 
A. konstantinidou, I. Vamvakaris
*General Hospital of Thoracic Diseases of Athens "Sotiria", 
Greece
Background & objectives: Plasmacytoma refers as a malignant 
plasma cell tumour growing within bones or extraosseous (extramed-
ullary). Testicular plasmacytomas are rare malignant neoplasms with 
relatively poor prognosis. At the time of diagnosis, our patient did not 
have multiple myeloma
Methods: A 87 year-old -patient presented to our hospital with a 
painless testicular mass, accompanied by a sense of heaviness. CT 
scan reveals a solid mass 6,5X5X4 cm in dimensions. An orchi-
ectomy was the surgery of choice. On dissection of the surgical 
specimen, a brownish mass was recognized.
Results: Microscopic examination showed a lesion composed 
entirely of mature and immature plasma cells, ranging from small 
and mature to large in size and atypical cells with prominent nucle-
oli. Sheets of plasma cells with abundant pink cytoplasm were 
also present invading the seminiferous tubules. Sparse, single, 
pale staining nuclear inclusions, with the morphologic features of 
"Dutcher bodies" were also present. Immunohistochemically, the 
neoplasm had the following profile: CD138 (+), CD19 (-), CD20 
(-), CD117 (-), PLAP(-), CD56 (-), KLMW rarely (+). Confirma-
tion of a clonal plasma cell lesion was accomplished immunohis-
tochemically for Ig light chains.
Conclusion: Plasmacytomas have been described in bones and in 
other tissues, most commonly in the upper respiratory tract with 
spread to cervical lymph nodes, but they may occur also in the gas-
trointestinal tract, breast, testis and in many other anatomical loca-
tions. Very few have been reported in the testis. Isolated testicular 
plasmacytoma accounts for only 0,03-0,1 %. The vast majority 
of patients with testicular plasmacytoma either have disseminated 
disease at the time of diagnosis, or develop disseminated disease 
later in life

ALK-positive large B-cell lymphoma: a very rare and aggres-
sive neoplasm
C.M. Vieru*, F.J. Menarguez, J. Huerta Aragonés, C. Garrido 
Colino, F.J. Díaz Crespo
*Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Spain
Background & objectives: ALK-positive B-cell lymphoma is a rare 
CD-20 negative aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma with less than 200 
cases published in the literature. We describe a new refractory case 
with a view to improving its knowledge and so, its diagnostic and 
therapeutic management.
Methods: We report the only case diagnosed in our hospital and 
describe clinical, radiological, histopathological, immunopheno-
typic and molecular features. This is a 12 year-old boy with a left 
axillary lump and intermittent scapular pain without any other 
medical history. Imaging tests was performed and a lytic scapular 
lesion with axillary and splenic adenopathic conglomerates were 
evidenced.
Results: Axillary fine-needle aspiration and core-needle biopsy 
were realized and revealed a completely infiltrated lymph node 
tissue by a diffuse neoplasm, composed of monomorphic large 
cells with plasmablastic features with round pale nuclei containing 
a large central nucleolus and abundant amphophylic cytoplasm. 
Immunohistochemical stains were positive for CD45, CD79, 
CD138, MUM-1, IgA-Kappa, c-MYC, EMA, BCMA and ALK 
with restricted granular cytoplasmic staining pattern and pre-
sented a very high proliferation index. Lymphoid markers, EBER 
and HHV8 resulted negative. FISH studies confirmed ALK trans-
location t(2;17) and clonality tests showed immunoglobulin heavy 
chain rearrangement. Two years after diagnosis, in stage III dis-
ease, is receiving the sixth-line of treatment awaiting for CAR-T 
cell therapy (BCMA).
Conclusion: Large B-cell lymphoma is one of the most com-
mon lymphoma. Recent advances in molecular biology allowed 
to describe new subtypes, including ALK-positive large B-cell 
lymphoma, a rare entity that represent a diagnostic challenge. It 
is important to correctly diagnose it as long as its aggressivity 
turns it into a therapeutic problem with a poor median prognosis 
(<2 years). Our patient’s refractory process shows that despite the 
variety of therapies described, additional research is necessary to 
better understand this pathology.

*Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal, Pathology Department, 
Spain
Background & objectives: Lymph node follicular hyperplasia and 
plasmacytosis have been considered as non-specific alterations with 
little attention in the literature. However, these findings may lead the 
pathologist to include an autoimmune process in the diagnosis of a 
lymph node biopsy.
Methods: We present the morphological and immunohistochemical 
features in a series of four cases of autoimmune-related 
lymphadenopathies, three systemic lymphadenopathies (with no 
autoimmune disease related) and two multicentric Castleman 
disease cases diagnosed between 2018 and 2022; emphasizing the 
location and quantification of plasma cells within the lymph node. 
Epidemiological data and clinical findings are also included in 
the study.
Results: All four patients diagnosed with an autoimmune process 
showed florid follicular hyperplasia and varying degrees of poly-
typic inter (grade 2-3) and intrafollicular (grade 1) plasmacytosis. 
No light chain restriction was detected in such cases. Within the 
systemic non-autoimmune –related lymphadenopathies, two cases 
proved intrafollicular (grade 1-2) plasmacytosis with kappa light 
chain restriction and mild interfollicular plasmacytosis (grade 1). 
Multicentric Castleman disease showed intense interfollicular 
plasmacytosis (grade 3) with no intrafollicular presence of plasma 
cells.
Conclusion: Follicular hyperplasia and polytypic inter and 
intrafollicular plasmacytosis are common findings within 
autoimmune affected patients. The pathologist must be capable 
to recognize these features and include the possibility of an 
underlying autoimmune process in the differential diagnosis in 
patients with multiple lymphadenopathy.

Background & objectives: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a rare, self-
limited disease, characterised by a regional (usually cervical) lymphad-
enopathy associated with mild systemic symptoms. The diagnosis relies 
on histopathological examination which reveals necrotising, histiocytic 
lymphadenitis with a characteristic absence of neutrophils. The aetiol-
ogy remains unknown.
Methods: We report the case of a 27-year old male who presented 
to his general practitioner with mild fever, fatigue, coughing and 
cervical lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis of COVID-19 infection 
was established based on PCR testing. Following treatment, the 
complete resolution of symptoms was noted, except for a persistent 
cervical lymphadenopathy. Excisional biopsy and histopathological 
examination of the lymph node was performed
Results: The microscopic examination revealed the presence of 
several irregular areas of necrosis comprised of nuclear debris and 
apoptotic cells surrounded by an abundant population of histio-
cytes. Rare plasma cells were identified in the background of the 
lymph node, along with normal lymphocytes and some immuno-
blasts. A complete absence of neutrophils was also documented. 
Atypical cells were not identified. Serology and special stains ruled 
out infectious causes. Immunohistochemical stainings revealed a 
CD68 positive population of histiocytes and an abundance of CD8 
and CD4 positive T cells. Fewer CD20 positive B cells were noted 
in the background. Thus, a diagnosis of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease 
(KFD) was established.
Conclusion: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a challenging diagnosis, 
especially considering that at certain stages of the disease, it can 
mimic other entities, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or 
lymphoma. Thus, awareness of this disease is crucial in preventing 
misdiagnosis and improper treatment. Although its aetiology 
remains unknown, it is theorised that it may represent a T-cell and 
histiocyte mediated response to some infectious agents and there 
are cases reported in the literature of KFD in conjunction with 
COVID-19 infection or vaccination.

*Narodowy Instytut Onkologii im. M. Sklodowskiej-Curie, Poland
Background & objectives: In a subgroup of ALK-negative (ALK-) 
anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) a repetitive mutation in the 
musculin gene [MSC(E116K)] has been recently described. Recur-
rent fusion-gene including EIF4E3-FOXP1 has been identified only in 
single studies under multiple myeloma and breast cancer.
Methods: A 62-year-old female with ALK- ALCL, AnnArbor 
IIIB, IPI-2/5 was qualified for histopathological consultation. 
Immunohistochemical assessment and the extended molecular 
testing with a comprehensive 125-gene panel assay dedicated 
to lymphomas were performed The status of the MSC gene was 
explored with the Sanger method.
Results: The showed classic histopathological ALK- ALCL 
morphology and immunophenotype (CD30+, ALK-, CD43+/
CD4+/CD3+, Granzyme B+/Perforin+, MUM1+, PAX5-/CD20-, 
CD15-). Molecularly it was a triple-negative ALK- ALCL with 
MSC(E116K) mutation and a novel in-frame fusion of EIF4E3 exon 
7 to FOXP1 exon 3. Other point changes detected in transcripts 
included: CDKN2A: c.*29G>C, CREB3L2: c.299_301del, p. 
(Thr100del), NOTCH1: c.5168-1_5168insA, p.(Ser1723LysfsTer2), 
BATF3: c.134dup, p. (Asn45LysfsTer17). Our patient had received 
induction treatment (6 cycles of CHOP) and achieved complete 
remission (CR). The consolidation treatment included high-dose 
chemotherapy with Be-EAM supported by auto SCT. After two 
years of follow-up, the patient presents with CR, with no symptoms 
suggesting disease progression.
Conclusion: ALK- ALCL shows a variable and potentially 
"molecularly-related" prognosis. We present for the first time the 
coexistence of MSC(E116K) and EIF4E3-FOXP1 fusion-gene. The 
importance of these genetic changes is still limited. MSC(E116K) 
mutation seems to be related to DUSP22 rearrangements and 
a better prognosis. The EIF4E3-FOXP1 fusion-gene was not 
previously described in ALCL; therefore it’s crucial to study ALCL 
in-depth on larger groups of patients concerning clinical prognosis.

Littoral cell angioma of the spleen: unexpected finding in sple-
nectomy specimen. Case report and review of the literature

G. Coronado-Vilca, E. Prados-Perez, J.C. Yange-Zambrano, R.F. 
Ramos-Asensio
*Hospital Mateu Orfila, Spain
Background & objectives: Littoral cell angioma (LCA) is a rare and 
benign primary vascular neoplasm of the spleen, with characteristic 
histopathologic features, reported by Falk et al in 1991. It is thought to 
arise from the cells lining the red pulp sinuses (littoral-cells).
Methods: A 67-year-old man with palpable and hard splenomeg-
aly, of 10cm below the costal rim; with leukocytosis, anaemia and 
plateletopenia. CT-scan showed enlarged spleen (20cm), hetero-
geneous, with hypodense nodules inside, some solid and others 
cystic necrotic; no hyper-enhancement on PET-scan. The differen-
tial diagnosis included metastatic disease, lymphoma/leukaemia. 
Bone marrow biopsy was performed, showing reactive hyperplasia, 
without neoplastic infiltration. Splenectomy was performed.
Results: The spleen weighed 1802gr and measured 24×18.4×6cm. 
Externally polylobulated-appearance. Serial-sections showed mul-
tiple spongy, reddish-venous nodules of variable size, up to 1.5cm, 
blood-filled, throughout entire spleen. Histologically, the lesions 
were not-encapsulated, consisted of vascular-channels with red-
blood-cells inside. The vascular-lumina showed irregular lining 
endothelium with both histiocytic and endothelial features, without 
atypia or mitosis; cells of histiocytic-habitus often sloughed into 
the lumen and some showed erythrophagocytosis. Papillary-pro-
jections into vascular spaces and extramedullary-haematopoiesis 
were observed. The unaffected white-pulp showed mild reactive 
follicular-hyperplasia. By immunohistochemistry the tall-lining-
cells (with histiocytic-features) were positive for CD68, Factor-
VIII, CD163; and the flat-lining-cells (with endothelial-features) 
were positive for CD31, Factor-VIII. CD8, WT1 were negative. The 
final diagnosis was LCA.
Conclusion: LCA is a rare primary splenic vascular tumour, likely 
secondary to hemodynamic disturbance in spleen. So far, about 
329 cases have been described in the literature. When diagnosed, 
it is necessary to search for synchronous or metachronous visceral 
neoplasia. LCA can also mimic metastatic lesion of the spleen. 
This case report underlines the rarity of this neoplasm, with mor-
phological and immunophenotypic features like those described in 
the literature; that needs to be included in the differential diagnosis 
of multiple hypodense-splenic-nodules.

brano, E.G. Herrera Romero, S. Montes Moreno
*Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla, Spain
Background & objectives: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is a 
rare benign self-limiting disease which predominantly affects young 
women and Asian populations. KFD is characterized by cervical lym-
phadenopathy and mild fever. We report a case of KFD following the 
SARS-CoV2 vaccination.
Methods: A 30-year-old woman with no medical history of 
interest, presented left axillary lymphadenopathy with reactive 
appearance on ultrasound, 12 days after the first dose of SARS-
CoV2 vaccination in the left arm. More than 6 weeks after the 
second dose, these adenopathies were increased in number and 
size on ultrasonography, so a core needle biopsy was requested.
Results: Histological study revealed a lymph node parenchyma 
with paracortical hyperplasia and multiple circumscribed foci 
of necrosis with abundant karyorrhexis and eosinophilic debris. 
Numerous histiocytes (some C-shaped) and plasmacytoid 
dendritic cells were seen in association with apoptotic cells. 
No neutrophils or hematoxylin bodies were observed. The 
predominant cellularity corresponded to CD3+ T lymphoid 
population and nests of CD123+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells, 
especially around necrotic foci. The immunohistochemical study 
with CD30, kappa and lambda showed no alterations. Isolated 
fibrin thrombi in blood vessels were present. Histologic findings 
were compatible with a Kikuchi-type necrotizing lymphadenitis.
Conclusion: Only three cases of KFD have been reported follow-
ing vaccination against COVID-19. Although KFD pathogenesis 
is unknown, it is believed to be a consequence of an aberrant 
immune response of T cells and histiocytes to an immunogenic 
antigen (infectious agents or physicochemical factors). Because 
the patient had no discomfort before the vaccines were admin-
istered, COVID-19 vaccine was the more likely cause of KFD. 
Vaccination should be added to the list of potential triggers/fac-
tors associated with the development of KFD.

Clinical implication of CD30 expression in De Novo Epstein 
Barr virus-positive diffuse large B-Cell Lymphoma NOS
N. Moulai*, R. Bennoui, M. Guermi, W. Ouahioune
*Department of pathology and Cancer Research Laboratory, 
Blida University Hospital, Saad Dahleb University, Algeria
Background & objectives: EBV+ Diffuse DLBCL NOS, is an aggres-
sive clinicopathological entity recognized in the last edition of the 
2016 classification of the World Health Organization (WHO). Our 
aim is to determine the impact of prognostic of CD30 expression in 
EBV(+)-DLBCL.
Methods: CD30 expression was compared on 78 EBV(-)-
DLBCLs including 67 with ABC and 11 GCB phenotype to 13 
EBV(+)-DLBCLs ABC phenotype. The patients were treated 
by R-CHOP over a period of 44 months, from January 2015 to 
August 2019. The cut-off for CD30 positivity was 20% of neo-
plastic cells.
Results: In our series, there was a significant difference between 
the expression of CD30 EBV (+)-DLBCL and EBV(-)-DLBCL 
(p<0.001). CD30 was positive in 76.9% EBV(+)-DLBCL and 
20.5% of EBV(-)-DLBCL. It was expressed in 70% of the non-
GC ABC molecular subtype DLBCL. The Pearson test showed 
a significant correlation between EBER expression and CD30 
expression (r=0.367, p=<0.000). CD30 was significantly asso-
ciated with EBV status and survival in both CD30 and EBV 
positive. Patients showed a very low survival rate Log Rank 
(Mantel-Cox)=0.0008. The multivariate analysis by Cox regres-
sion in our study retained CD30 as an independent variant 
(p=0.03).
Conclusion: Expression of CD30 in EBV(+)-DLBCL is linked to a 
lower survival rate and poor treatment response suggesting a strong 
rationale for therapy targeted at the CD30 activation pathway for 
these patients positive for both CD30 and EBV.

Plasmacytoma of the testis as initial presentation of multiple 
myeloma: case report
A. Tanevska Zrmanovska*, B. Krsteska, G. Petrushevska
*Institute for pathology, North Macedonia
Background & objectives: Extramedullary plasmacytoma represents 
5% of plasma cell neoplasms. Plasmacytoma of the testis is extremely 
rare and may occur as isolated tumour or in concomitance with multiple 
myeloma. We report a case of testicular plasmacytoma in 77-year-old 
male patient.
Methods: The physical examination and ultrasonography revealed 
enlarged left testicle. Based on a clinical diagnosis, an inguinal 
orchidectomy was performed. On gross examination the testicle 
measured 7x4x4cm and was entirely occupied by a solid white 
fleshy tumour. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue samples 
were stained with HE and immunohistochemically with CD138, 
MUM 1, CD79, CD3, CD20, CD117, PLAP and Ki 67.
Results: Microscopic examination revealed a malignant neoplasm 
composed of atypical plasma cells with pale eosinophilic 
cytoplasm and polymorphic and polychromatic nuclei which 
diffusely obliterated underlying testicular parenchyma and 
infiltrating the epididymis and surrounding peritesticular fibrous 
tissue. Immunohistochemically the cells were positive for CD138, 
MUM1 and CD79 and negative for CD3, CD20, CD117 and PLAP 
with Ki67 80%. After period of two and half months the diagnose 
of multiple myeloma was established with bone marrow aspiration 
showed 60% plasma cells, flow cytometry with CD38 and CD138 
plasma cells and serum protein immunoelectrophoresis IgA 
idiotype. Patient died after two-week therapy with corticosteroids, 
four months after initiate diagnose of plasmacytoma of testis.
Conclusion: Testicular plasmacytoma is extremely rare presen-
tation of extramedullary plasmacytoma. Taking into account the 
additional data obtained about the patient we concluded that in our 
case it was the first manifestation of systemic disease referred as 
multiple myeloma.

Atypical case of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), 
cutaneous monoclonal plasma cell neoplasm and POEMS-like 
syndrome: a tricky confounding case
R. de Paula*, V. Farnese, C. Ferreira, C. Oliveira, F. Costa, A.C. 
Lemos, G. Roberti, J. Pereira
*A.C. Camargo Cancer Center, Brazil
Background & objectives: Patients with AITL typically present with 
the onset of a systemic illness, but they rarely manifest typical findings 
of POEMS syndrome and skin nodules related to secondary plasma cell 
neoplasm. This case illustrates atypical manifestations and, therefore, 
its diagnostic challenge.
Methods: A 73-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because 
of weakness, paresthesias and violaceous cutaneous plaques. 
Complementary tests revealed organomegaly, hypogonadism, 
enlarged lymph nodes and polyclonal gammopathy, although the

immunofixation urine test was positive. Bone marrow biopsy was 
inconclusive due to extensive sclerosis. The first lymph node 
biopsy showed hyperplastic changes with increased polyclonal 
plasma cells and PD-1 positive cells.
Results: As the diagnosis of clonal lymphoproliferative disorder 
was not confirmed in the first biopsy, the clinical hypothesis of 
Castleman disease was raised and appropriate treatment was initi-
ated. However, there was no improvement and cutaneous lesions 
and thrombocytopenia worsened. A skin biopsy was performed, 
showing diffuse infiltration of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue 
by apparently mature plasma cells with kappa light chain restric-
tion. In view of this, PCR-based clonality test was required in prior 
lymph node biopsy material, which resulted positive for a clonal 
T-cell proliferation. By reviewing the subtle morphological features 
in the histopathology, the diagnosis of Angioimmunoblastic T-cell 
lymphoma was finally made.
Conclusion: AITL generally causes a variety of immune 
dysfunctions, something that can mimic a number of other diseases 
and cause diagnostic delays. In addition, atypical and unusual 
manifestations reported in this case may contribute to inappropriate 
treatments. Further studies are necessary to clarify the interplay 
between this lymphoma and plasma cell proliferations in order to 
prevent misdiagnosis. A detailed clinical evaluation and auxiliary 
tests, such as PCR-based clonality, are essential for precise 
diagnosis and must be available in medical practice.

Νasal glomangiomyoma
M. Givannakis, D. Anestakis*, G. Tsiropoulos, I. Dimitriadis, C. 
Charalampidis, P. Karkos
*Laboratory of Pathology, Forensic Service of Thessaloniki, 
Greece
Background & objectives: Glomangiomyoma is a histological vari-
ant of glomus tumour. These are benign tumours, typically located in 
the subcutis or deep dermis of the subungual region of the fingers. We 
describe the clinico-pathological, immunohistochemical findings of a 
case of nasal glomangiomyoma.
Methods: A 63-year-old man presented with a 2-month history 
of intermittent epistaxis and partial nasal obstruction with a dura-
tion of two months. Posterior rhinoscopy revealed the presence 
of a nodule, less than 1 cm in diameter, in the left posterior nasal 
cavity, based in the middle turbinate and protruding in the middle 
meatus. The lesion was endoscopically excised, with macroscopi-
cally clear margins.
Results: The excised material was a round nodule with diameter 9 
mm. Histopathology showed that the tumour was characteristically 
composed of solid sheets and cords of uniform cells with pale 
or eosinophilic cytoplasms and round or ovoid nuclei, compatible 
with glomus cells, interrupted by variable sized vessels. In a central 
area of the tumour, spindled cells with elongated nuclei and bipolar 
eosinophilic cytoplasm resembling smooth muscle differentiation 
were present. The immunoreaction of tumour cells, positive for 
smooth muscle actin and negative for CD34, that was positive 
in blood vessels, supported the diagnosis. It was suggestive of 
glomangiomyoma. Nuclear pleomorphism, mitoses and necroses 
were absent.
Conclusion: Glomangiomyoma shows variable proportions of glo-
mus cells, vascular structures, and smooth muscle cells. The most 
common site is the hand, particularly the fingers. Nasal glomangio-
myomas are extremely rare. This may suggest that the histological 
type may be more important in predicting the clinical presentation 
than the anatomical location of the tumour. Despite being a rare 
entity, it should be included in the differential diagnosis in patients 
with common rhinological symptoms.

Primary intraosseous spindle cell carcinoma of the jaw bones: 
Is it a new histological entity?
K. Kusafuka*, M. Fukushima, S. Baba, M. Suzuki
*Shizuoka General Hospital, Japan
Background & objectives: Intragnathic carcinomas mainly consist of 
primary intraosseous squamous cell carcinoma, central mucoepider-
moid carcinoma and ameloblastic carcinoma, whereas they are very 
rare. We reported two extremely rare cases of primary intraosseous 
spindle cell carcinoma (PIOSpCC), clinico-pathologically.
Methods: We selected intragnathic epithelial neoplasms from a 
pathology file of our institutions, selected intraosseous spindle cell 
carcinoma of jaw bones, and examined them, clinically, histologi-
cally and immunohistochemically.
Results: Two cases (0.4%) were selected: Case 1 was 43-year-old 
male with the swelling of the left mandible. Case 2 was 42-year-
old male with the painful swelling of the right maxilla. Both 
showed the smoothly-surfaced masses, where the main tumours 
existed in the jaw bones with osteolytic destruction. Both showed 
the fascicular proliferation of atypical spindle cells. In case 1, the 
small nests of epithelioid cells were focally seen, whereas case 2 
showed necrosis and multinucleated giant cells. Both were dif-
fusely immuno-positive for pan-CK and vimentin. In case 2, spin-
dle cells were focally desmin, but negative for myogenin. Ki-67 
labelling index was 38% and 72%, respectively. Case 2 died of 
disease.
Conclusion: We diagnosed both cases as PIOSpCC. PIOSpCC har-
boured neither squamous cell carcinoma component nor amelo-
blastic component. The worse prognosis of PIOSpCC is related 
to necrosis and high Ki-67 labelling index. Case 2 showed focal 
positivity for desmin, but was negative for other myogenic markers. 
Therefore, it was not intraosseous rhabdomyosarcoma of the jaw 
bones. We propose that PIOSpCC is an extremely rare but a new 
entity of primary intraosseous carcinoma.

Nasopharyngeal hairy polyp: a rare case report
J. Madeira*, A. Alves, R. Almeida, M.R. Silva, M.A. Cipriano
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário, Portugal
Background & objectives: Hairy polyps are rare developmental mal-
formations mostly occurring in infants and neonates arising in naso-
pharynx or oropharynx. They have a higher female incidence (6F:1M) 
with a left side predilection. Airway obstruction can be lethal and 
should be managed carefully.
Methods: We report a case of a female neonate presenting a 
severe obstruction of the oropharynx with epistaxis and feeding 
difficulties. It was caused by a large mass that extends from the 
most posterior portion of the right nasal cavity to the aryepiglottic 
folds. The MRI documented an elongated heterogeneous lesion 
measuring 33x9x8mm, virtually occupying the entire lumen of the 
oropharynx.
Results: Simple surgical excision of the mass was performed. 
Gross examination showed a gray pear-shaped pedunculated mass 
bearing few hair shafts. Histologic evaluation revealed a poly-
poid lesion, composed of ectodermal and mesodermal elements, 
namely adnexal structures, adipose tissue and cartilage, covered

with keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, prompting the 
diagnosis of congenital hairy polyp.
Conclusion: Congenital hairy polyps should be considered in the 
differential diagnosis in cases of life-threatening airway obstruc-
tion in neonates. They are composed of tissues derived from meso-
derm and ectoderm. Histological examination gives the definitive 
diagnosis, crucial in differentiating hairy polyp from other lesions, 
being essential for prognosis and follow-up. Malignant transforma-
tion has never been reported. Surgical resection is the treatment 
of choice. Knowledge of this type of development malformation 
make easier early intervention and avoids significant morbidity.

Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma and familial adenoma-
tous polyposis: an extraordinary case report
J. Madeira*, B. Sepodes, M.R. Silva, M.J. Julião, M.A. Cipriano
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário, Portugal
Background & objectives: Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma 
(JNA) is a rare and benign vascular neoplasm affecting almost 
exclusively adolescent males. It may occur as a component of the 
Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), making it 20-25 times more 
prevalent compared to the general population.
Methods: We present a case of a 14-year-old male with a personal 
and familial history of FAP with colorectal polyps and cancer and 
desmoid tumours, presenting with a mass in his left nasal cav-
ity, with recurrent epistaxis and nasal obstruction. MRI revealed a 
non-encapsulated lobulated heterogeneous mass lesion in the left 
side of the nasopharynx with 85x46x55mm, extending to adjacent 
structures.
Results: He underwent tumour embolization followed by 
endoscopic excision. Gross examination revealed a fragmented 
lobulated and pedunculated mass. Histologically, it was a biphasic 
lesion with a vascular component consisting of variable sized 
and shaped vessels, small rounded or slit-like to larger staghorn, 
with variable wall thickness, with single layer of endothelium and 
occasionally smooth muscle wall. The stromal component varies 
from highly cellular, collagenized areas to less cellular regions with 
a fibromyxoid background. CD34 and CD31 immunohistochemistry 
highlighted endothelial cells. Smooth muscle actin showed the 
muscular wall of the vessels and beta-catenin revealed nuclear 
staining in tumour stromal cells and membranous/cytoplasmic 
staining in endothelial cells.
Conclusion: FAP is an inherited autosomal dominant syndrome 
due to a defect in the APC gene characterized by multiple 
gastrointestinal adenomas and risk of adenocarcinomas and 
extracolonic manifestations. In patients with an association of PAF 
and JNA, mutations in APC gene were described in the stromal 
cells of the tumour, which highlights the idea that JNA may be the 
first manifestation of FAP. Therefore, it is important to consider 
FAP as an underlying condition in patients with a diagnosis of 
JNA.

A rare case of respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamartoma 
of the nasal cavity
H. Trihia*, S. Laskaris, E. Souka, G. Stanc, G. Galanopoulos, L. 
Karelis
*Pathology Department Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamar-
toma (REAH) is a rare benign proliferation of mature sinonasal tissue 
presenting as a polypoid mass, first described by Wenig and Heffner in 
1995, mostly involving the posterior nasal septum. Surgical excision 
is the treatment of choice.
Methods: A 38-year-old man with a history of unilateral nasal 
obstruction was diagnosed with a unilateral polypoid mass located 
in the left posterior nasal cavity in contact with the nasal septum. 
Simple surgical excision with functional endoscopic sinus surgery 
(FESS) was performed.
Results: We received a yellowish polypoid mass with gelatinous, 
glistening outer surface, measuring 4,5X2X1cm. Microscopic 
examination showed a florid proliferation of widely spaced, partly 
confluent, small to medium, round to oval, partly cystically dilated 
tubular glands, lined by ciliated respiratory epithelium, without 
nuclear atypia. Invagination of the surface epithelium gave rise to 
ciliated tubular glands. Some glands showed mucinous metaplasia, 
similar to colonic glands. Some seromucinous normal glands were 
interspersed with the tubular glands. Stromal hyalinization was pre-
sent with envelopment of glands by a thick, eosinophilic basement 
membrane. The stroma was oedematous, with inflammatory cells 
and eosinophils, similar to an inflammatory polyp. The diagnosis 
was of a respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamartoma.
Conclusion: REAH, is an uncommon entity with distinctive mor-
phologic features including a glandular component originating 
from the overlying surface respiratory epithelium and polypoid 
growth as a result of respiratory epithelial adenomatoid prolifera-
tion. REAH, especially those with a metaplastic mucinous compo-
nent should be differentiated from low grade sinonasal adenocar-
cinomas, which are locally aggressive tumours. REAH is CK20-/
CDX-2-, in contrast with the low-grade sinonasal adenocarcinoma. 
Pathologists must be aware of this entity in order to avoid overdi-
agnosis and radical surgery.

Pleomorphic adenoma of the parapharyngeal space. A common 
tumour in an uncommon location
H. Trihia*, S. Laskaris, M. Terzi, L. Karelis, I. Koutrafouris, G. 
Stanc
*Pathology Department Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: The majority of minor salivary gland 
tumours are malignant. Pleomorphic adenoma is the commonest benign 
tumour, most often found in the oral cavity. A very rare case of a large 
pleomorphic adenoma arising in the parapharyngeal space is reported.
Methods: A 37-year-old man presented with difficulty in swal-
lowing and obstructive sleep apnea of three months’ duration. CT 
scan showed a 7cm mass extending from the left lateral oropharynx 
to the larynx. There was no neck lymph node enlargement. The 
tumour was examined with transoral FNA, which was diagnostic 
of a pleomorphic adenoma. The tumour was transorally enucleated.
Results: On gross examination the lesion was measuring 
7X4X4,5cm, with a whitish, faintly lobulated and focally 
glistening cut surface. Histological examination showed 
a neoplasm with an admixture of epithelial and stromal 
components. Ducts lined by inner epithelial and outer 
myoepithelial cells surrounded by a chondromyxoid stroma, 
consistent with pleomorphic adenoma. Foci of quamous 
metaplasia were also present. Postoperative period was 
uneventful.
Conclusion: Pleomorphic adenomas may occur in the para-
pharyngeal space from displaced/aberrant salivary gland tissue 
within a lymph node, in contrast to tumours arising from minor 
salivary glands medial to the constrictor muscles of the pharynx 
or the deep lobe of the parotid gland. The treatment of choice is 
resection with adequate margins. For parapharyngeal tumours

wide resection may not be possible due to proximity to vital 
structures. High index of suspicion and an adequate clearance is 
the key to successful treatment.

Primary small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the tonsil: a 
case report
G. Galanopoulos*, E. Souka, S. Laskaris, M. Terzi, L. Karelis, 
O. Tzaida
*Pathology Department Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Neuroendocrine tumours account for 0.5% 
of all malignancies and are mainly found in the gastrointestinal track 
and the lung. We present a very rare case of primary small cell neu-
roendocrine carcinoma (NEC) of the right tonsil.
Methods: A 82-year-old male patient was admitted with symptoms 
of throat pain and dysphagia. Clinical examination revealed a right 
tonsil mass along with a palpable right inguinal lymph node. A 
biopsy of the tonsillar mass, as well as a fine needle biopsy (FNB) 
of the lymph node was performed.
Results: Microscopical examination of the tonsillar mass showed 
small round to oval tumour cells arranged in nests or rosettes with 
granular nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Apoptosis, necrosis and 
numerous mitotic figures (>10mit/2mm2) were also found. Immu-
nohistochemical staining was positive for CKAE1-AE3, CK8-18, 
CK20 (dot-like pattern), chromogranin and synaptophysin. Ki-67 
mitotic index was high (>80%). Same histopathological results 
were identified on the lymph node FNB. The aforementioned fea-
tures of the tumour established the diagnosis of a primary poor-
differentiated small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the tonsil 
with inguinal lymph node metastasis.
Conclusion: Small cell NEC that primarily occurs in tonsil is 
extremely rare with an aggressive disease course and poor prog-
nosis (18 months median overall survival time). During the past 
40 years, there have been only 14 cases added in the English 
literature with a male predominance. Paraganglioma and malig-
nant lymphoma should be considered in the differential diag-
nosis. Owing to its rarity, standard treatment protocol remains 
uncertain.

A case of multiple cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas of the 
head and neck in a patient with primary lung adenocarcinoma
Y. Topalov*, A. Vlahova, E. Aleksiev, M. Genadieva
*Alexandrovska University Hospital, Bulgaria
Background & objectives: Here we present a case of multiple skin 
nodules in the head and neck area arising simultaneously in a 70-year-
old man just diagnosed with primary lung adenocarcinoma. The 
clinical suspicion was skin metastases.
Methods: During chemotherapy and immunotherapy for the lung 
tumour the nodules shrunk in size. The clinical suspicion was skin 
metastases. Incision biopsy was performed on some of the nodules 
and they were histologically and immunohistochemically examined.
Results: Histology revealed poorly differentiated epithelial 
tumours and immunohistochemical studies confirmed them to be 
of squamous origin. A diagnosis of eruptive primary cutaneous 
squamous cell carcinomas was made.
Conclusion: Although rare, the possibility for multiple simulta-
neous primary malignancies should always be in the differential 
diagnosis with metastatic disease, and clinical response to therapy 
cannot be used as a reliable distinguishing criterion.

NTRK-rearranged thyroid carcinomas with evidence of ana-
plastic transformation in lymph node metastases: clinicopatho-
logical and molecular features
I. Laklouk*
*University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA
Background & objectives: The actionable NTRK-rearranged thyroid 
carcinoma carcinomas (PTC) are not infrequently clinically aggres-
sive and are predominantly differentiated follicular-derived carcino-
mas. Rare NTRK-rearranged PTCs have shown disease progression 
and aggressive clinical behaviour, but their pathologic and molecular 
features remain understudied.
Methods: Of 40 BRAF negative PTCs available for review, we 
identified 3 NTRK-rearranged thyroid carcinomas. We examined 
the clinicopathological and molecular features of 3 NTRK-rear-
ranged thyroid carcinoma cases.
Results: One NTRK-rearranged PTC, despite surgical, radioio-
dine/chemotherapy, had multiple lymph nodes/local recurrences 
over 17 years. The most recent recurrence demonstrates biphasic 
components of differentiated PTC and dedifferentiated (anaplastic 
transformation) anaplastic transformation with sarcoma-like mor-
phology. Immunostains show that AE1/3 and PAX8 are positive in 
differentiated-PTC but negative in the dedifferentiated component. 
Both components are negative for TTF-1, desmin, and p53. Ki-67 
is 40% in dedifferentiated carcinoma and less than 10% in the dif-
ferentiated PTC. NGS showed ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion, BCL3, 
and BCL9 in both components. The other two NTRK-rearranged 
cases show indolent clinical behaviour with neither high-grade fea-
tures nor anaplastic transformation in their primary tumours or in 
lymph node disease
Conclusion: This report identified a recurrent PTC with ETV6-
NTRK3 gene fusion mutation that was prone to undergo an 
anaplastic transformation with sarcoma-like morphology in the 
nodal recurrence, which may mimic other spindle cell sarcomas. 
This finding, also, has important implications for clinical outcomes 
and aggressive clinical behaviour

Malignant melanoma metastasis in a parotid lymph node, with-
out an identifiable primary site
L. Banias*, R. Chiciudean, I. Jung, D. Szava, Z. Kovacs, S. Gurzu
*George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, 
and Technology of Targu Mures, Romania
Background & objectives: The parotid gland hosts metastases, but 
most often from primary tumours of the head and neck region, which 
have the potential of spreading to the regional lymph nodes, such as 
cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas or cutaneous melanomas.
Methods: A 58-year-old male patient was admitted to the Oral 
and Maxillofacial Surgery Department with a tumour nodule that 
has been located in the right preauricular area for two years and 
which grew rapidly two months before presentation, for which a 
right partial parotidectomy was performed and the nodular mass 
was sent for histopathological examination.
Results: The macroscopic aspect showed a 35x35x10 mm encap-
sulated nodule, with tan and white colour areas on the cut section. 
Histopathological evaluation revealed lymphoid tissue pushed to 
the periphery and mostly replaced by a proliferation of atypical, 
pleomorphic cells, with melanin pigment content, arranged in clus-
ters and placards, with areas of haemorrhage and necrosis. The neo-
plastic cells presented BRAF-V600E/EC gene mutation, expressed 
HMB45, MelanA, Sox10, and were negative for Cytokeratin-AE1/
AE3. Based on these aspects, the final diagnosis was malignant

melanoma metastasis in a parotid lymph node. The patient’s his-
tory unveiled that he used to have a cutaneous pigmented lesion 
in the right supraorbital area which suffered a complete regression 
over time.
Conclusion: A malignant melanoma metastasis should not be 
excluded, even in cases with an absent primary tumour site. A 
complete examination of the head and neck region and a detailed 
history of the patient can aid in discovering the primary tumour.

Viable adenosquamous carcinoma of the larynx after chemo-
therapy and radiotherapy - a case report
G. Stanc*, N. Novkovic, G. Galanopoulos, S. Laskaris, C. Vala-
vanis, E. Souka
*Pathology Department Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) of 
upper aerodigestive tract is a rare malignant tumour. Laryngeal ASC is 
extremely unusual malignant neoplasm, representing only 0.35%–0.5% 
of all laryngeal malignancies. Because of its rarity there is no overall 
consensus as to its best management.
Methods: A female 67-year-old presented to our hospital for 
a laryngeal lesion in the glottic region. The biopsy showed 
moderate to high-grade invasive squamous carcinoma. She 
received neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy). 
In the biopsy after neoadjuvant therapy the diagnosis of viable 
invasive squamous carcinoma remained. A total laryngectomy was 
performed.
Results: On gross examination an ulcerated polypoid glottis 
tumour, 3cm. in diameter, with transglottis extension was recog-
nized. In the same container we received two lymph nodes 0.2cm 
and 0.3cm. in great diameter. On histopathologic examination, a 
viable ulcerated high grade squamous cell carcinoma was revealed 
[CK5/6 (+), p40 (+), p16 (-)] admixed with adenocarcinoma, mod-
erately differentiated [CK18/8 (+), EMA (+)].
The two lymph nodes were negative for metastasis. The patho-
logical stage (in our specimen) was ypT3N0, with response after 
neoadjuvant therapy R2 (CAP 2021).
Conclusion: ACS is a malignant neoplasm with an aggressive 
course, characterized by local recurrences, with early cervical 
lymph node metastasis and distant dissemination, most commonly 
in lung. The prognosis is poor and the mean overall survival rate 
is approximately 2-3 years. The current treatment involves surgical 
excision and/or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, depending on the 
stage.

A GLI-full diagnosis – a case report of a GLI-1 re-arranged 
head and neck mesenchymal neoplasm
H. Walsh*, S.A. Khurram, L. Hook
*Unit of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, School of Clinical Den-
tistry, University of Sheffield, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: A 19-year-old male patient presented 
complaining of a 12-month history of a gradually increasing lump on 
his posterior dorsal tongue. The lesion was reported to have ruptured 
prior to excision. The lesion was excised and sent for histological 
assessment.
Methods: Histological examination showed a well circumscribed, mul-
tinodular, and submucosal tumour without a capsule. The tumour mass 
was formed by nests of monotonous cells separated by a fine vascular 
network. The cells had round to ovoid nuclei with clear to eosino-
philic cytoplasm. Minimal atypia and mitoses were seen. Evidence of 
lymphovascular invasion was identified in the superficial vasculature.
Results: Immunohistochemistry showed diffuse Vimentin expres-
sion in lesional cells. Weak focal positivity was seen for CD56 
and GLUT1, with SMA expression only at the periphery of the 
tumour islands. Staining for S100, SOX10, Desmin, CD31, CD34, 
AE1/AE3, HMB-45, CD99, ERG, CD68, EMA, Calcitonin and 
muscle specific actin was negative. Pan-RNA fusion panel testing 
confirmed the presence of an ACTB-GLI1 fusion protein leading 
to a definitive diagnosis of a GLI-1 re-arranged head and neck 
mesenchymal neoplasm.
Conclusion: GLI 1 re-arranged mesenchymal neoplasms are a 
relatively newly described entity with a propensity to arise in the 
tongue within the head and neck regions. The distinct morpho-
logical and variable immunohistochemical profile should raise the 
possibility of this entity as a differential diagnosis and prompt 
pathologists to undertake additional molecular testing to establish 
the presence of GLI1 re-arrangement. Emerging evidence suggests 
these lesions have the potential for malignant behaviour therefore 
knowledge of this entity is paramount for appropriate management.

Neuroendocrine large cell carcinoma with myoepithelial dif-
ferentiation of the parotid gland - a case report
G. Stanc*, N. Novkovic, M. Sevastiadou, E. Kostopoulos, S. Sta-
sinopoulou, C. Valavanis, E. Souka
*Pathology Department Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Salivary gland carcinoma is a rare neo-
plasm accounting for 0.3% of all cancers. Large cell neuroendocrine 
carcinoma (LCNC) in the salivary glands is extremely rare, with poor 
prognosis similar to small cell carcinoma (SCC).
Methods: A male 58-years-old was referred to our hospital for 
swelling on the right site of the parotid area. Imaging revealed a 
circumscribed solid mass 5.5cm in size. A fine needle aspiration 
was performed and the cytological features shows a high-grade 
carcinoma. Total parotidectomy was performed.
Results: On macroscopic examination of the salivary gland, weigh-
ing 39g. and 7.5X4.5X2.5cm in dimensions, a yellowish myxoid 
tumour was found.
Microscopy showed a high grade neoplasm within myxoid stroma, 
with organoid infiltrative pattern, composed by large cells with marked 
nuclear atypia and hyperchromatic nuclei. Up to 10 mitotic figures / 
10HPF, comedo necrosis and perineural infiltration were observed.
The immunohistochemistry was positive for CK8/18, CK5/6, CK14, 
CD117, GFAP, S-100, Synaptophysin, Chromogranin A. Ki-67 was 
positive in 40-50%. Negative immunoreactivity was observed for 
CK7, EMA, TTF-1. PETscan demonstrated no lesions elsewhere. 
Based on morphological and immunophenotypic features the diag-
nosis of a primary LCNC with myoepithelial differentiation of the 
parotid gland was confirmed.
Conclusion: The lung is the most common site of this tumour, but 
LCNC has been found in other organs. The treatment for salivary 
gland carcinoma is mainly surgery, including primary tumour resec-
tion with or without neck lymph node dissection and adjuvant ther-
apy. LCNCs are very rare and there is no consensus on management 
guidelines. The main differential diagnosis of LCNC is with poorly 
differentiated carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohis-
tochemistry is important in making the right diagnosis of LCNC.

Odontogenic keratocysts in the setting of Nevoid Basal Cell 
Carcinoma Syndrome: a case report and literature review with 
an emphasis on CD56 immunohistochemistry analysis
M. Alzamora*, J. Azevedo, J. Vaz Silva, R. Guimarães, P. Lopes, 
M. Jácome
*IPO Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: 10-20% of odontogenic cysts are 
odontogenic keratocysts (OKC). Unicystic ameloblastomas are 
differential diagnoses of these lesions. Up to 5% of OKC are associated 
with Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS), caused by a 
mutation in the PTCH1 gene.
Methods: We present a case report of a 13-year-old patient with 
five multicentric and metachronous OKC. Immunohistochemical 
analysis for CD56 in the primary specimen was performed. 
Additionally, we did a review of current literature indexed on 
PubMed, and WHO Classification of Tumours (2017).
Results: The patient was referred to our hospital four years 
ago for removal of a palpable mass on her lower jaw. On 
histology, in addition to typical OKC findings, we highlight 
areas of budding growth from the basal cells, daughter cysts, 
and remains of odontogenic epithelium. Since then, the patient 
has had the need to remove another 4 masses with the same 
characteristics. The presented case is consistent with NBCCS 
but the patient is yet to show any cutaneous manifestations 
of NBCCS, such as basal cell carcinoma. CD56 was positive, 
namely in the aforementioned budding growth areas. Recent 
studies have shown a positive correlation between expression 
of CD56 and syndromic OKC.
Conclusion: Recurrence rates in OKC related to NBCCS are 
higher than in isolated cases. It is advised that when OKC are 
found at a young age or multiple are seen in the same patient, 
NBCCS should be considered. CD56 is commonly associated with 
unicystic ameloblastoma, which helps in the differential diagnosis 
with OKC. However, as found in literature, in the context of 
morphological and clinical findings, it may be helpful in detecting 
syndrome-related occurrences of OKC, such as in NBCCS.

A rare tumour of the parotid gland: lymphoepithelial 
carcinoma
M.M. Savas*, M.H. Karabulut
*Umraniye EducationTraining Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC), an 
uncommon malignancy, occurs usually in nasopharynx and rarely in 
salivary glands. It is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 
and emerges at limited patients of the local areas as Asia or Arctic 
Circle.
Methods: We reported a case of a Caucasian female with a LEC 
of the parotid gland (PG).A 48-year-old female presented with a 
right-sided, painful facial mass. PET/CT revealed a mass about 
4.5 cm in diameter with intense FDG uptake on the right-PG and 
involvement of the level II unilateral cervical lymph nodes. The 
potential non-parotid focus was excluded.
Results: She underwent total parotidectomy and ipsilateral selective 
neck dissection.On macroscopic examination, the mass was irregular in 
border and cream coloured. Microscopically, the tumours were widely 
infiltrative, characterized by large polygonal to spindled cells arranged 
in a syncytial, lattice-like network in a background of lymphoplas-
macytic cells. The neoplastic cells showed an open-vesicular nuclear 
chromatin to a more basaloid-morphology, the latter showing hyper-
chromatic nuclei and less cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry staining 
revealed that the epithelial cells were reactive for panCK and p63, 
patchy reactive for CK 5/6, 75% strong positive for Ki67 and negative 
for p16. Overexpression of p53 in the epithelial cells was monitored. 
The case was EBV positive by ISH.
Conclusion: In conclusion, LEC commonly occurs at the nasophar-
ynx and rarely occurs at other sites in the head and neck region. It 
has a strong tendency to metastasize to the regional lymph nodes 
with predominant involvement of the PG and the majority of those 
are radiosensitive. Combination therapy with surgery and radiation 
is desirable. Our patient has been disease-free for 3 years after 
combination therapy.

Filamin-A expression in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and 
its clinical significance
A. Ouban*
*Alfaisal University College of Med, Saudi Arabia
Background & objectives: Recent strategies to improve the overall 
prognosis of laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas (LSCCs) have 
focused on biomarkers’ discovery. Recent genomic studies reported 
that filamin-A is associated with metastatic LSCCs. This study was 
undertaken to analyse this protein’s expression in LSCCs.
Methods: This study analysed the expression of filamin-A, using 
immunohistochemistry, in a tissue microarray of 80 cases of 
laryngeal cancers. Clinicopathological parameters were analysed 
according to filamin-A expression in the tissue microarray. 
Furthermore, microarray tumours expressing this protein were 
further categorized according to the intensity of staining.
Results: A significant majority of this array’s laryngeal squamous 
cell carcinomas exhibited positive expression of filamin-A protein. 
All the filamin-A positive tumours expressed the protein in their 
cytoplasm. Significant correlation were found between filamin-A 
expression and the tumours’ grade, stage, lymph node status and 
metastases. A significant majority of the tumours exhibited the 
highest intensity of filamin-A immunohistochemical expression 
(IRS=12).
Conclusion: A significant majority of the LSCCs of this study’s 
array expressed filamin-A in their cytoplasm. This expression 
correlated with poor prognostic parameters of LSCCs. These 
findings are in line with evidence seen in other head and neck 
cancers, suggesting an important role for filamin-A in LSCCs.

Bakuła-Zalewska
*Department of Pathology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National 
Research Institute of Oncology; MSCNRIO, Poland
Background & objectives: Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma 
(CXPA) represents carcinoma of any type arising from a primary 
pleomorphic adenoma (PA). CXPA is considered aggressive, affects 
mainly the parotid glands, and constitutes nearly 12% of all malignant 
tumours of the salivary glands.
Methods: We report the clinical, histological, immunohisto-
chemical, and genetic features of one novel submandibular-
located CXPA case of 68-year-old men. The patient presented

with a long-standing painless mass in the left lateral neck with 
rapid progression, pain, and skin ulceration — no other signifi-
cant clinical burden. Computed tomography showed heterogene-
ously enhancing mass in the left submandibular fossa, originating 
from the submandibular gland.
Results: Grossly, a cream-colored, ulcerated, exophytic tumour 
of the skin, 3.4 x 2.8 cm in size and up to 2.6 cm in thickness, 
infiltrating the salivary gland parenchyma. Microscopically, the 
tumour consisted of three components: poorly differentiated 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), salivary duct carcinoma (SDC), 
and hyalinizing residual PA with no capsule. The SCC compo-
nent infiltrated both the salivary gland and the skin without a 
visible pre-invasive component. SDC was visible in the salivary 
gland in SCC’s immediate vicinity. Immunohistochemically, the 
SCC cells expressed p40 and SDC expressed AR, mammaglobin, 
and GATA3. Targeted Next-Generation sequencing detected 
TTC23-PLAG1 fusion in carcinoma component. The patient was 
referred for radiotherapeutic treatment.
Conclusion: The microscopic observation supports the 
diagnosis of the carcinoma developed in PA with a rare, 
double morphological differentiation (SCC and SDC). 
The detected PLAG1 fusion supports the diagnosis of 
double differentiation CXPA. Further research might 
explore whether the histologic type of the CXPA malignant 
component modifies the survival and efficacy of the 
implemented therapies.

Sinonasal glomangiopericytoma; a case report and histo-
pathological overview
H. Maddumage*, R. Rana, T. Wijesiri, S. Sunkaraneni, I. Bagwan
*Royal Surrey County Hospital, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Approximately 75% of the sinonasal 
tumours are benign and squamous cell carcinoma is the most common 
malignant tumour. Sinonasal glomangiopericytoma (SNGP), account-
ing for <0.5% of sinonasal neoplasms was first described in 1942 by 
Stout and Murray.
Methods: Here, we present a clinico-pathological analysis of a 
nasal mass composed of pericytic cellular morphology.
Results: A 78-year-old male presented with a mass in the left 
nasal cavity, which showed avid enhancement in MRI. Nasal 
polypectomy was performed. Histopathological examination 
revealed an ill-defined sub-epithelial tumour composed of 
sheets, lobules and nests of monotonous cells with round 
nuclei, indistinct nucleoli and scanty eosinophilic cytoplasm 
with minimal cytologic atypia in a background of collagenous 
stroma containing varying sized blood vessels showing dense 
perivascular hyalinization. There was no increased mitotic 
activity or necrosis. These lesional cells were positive for 
SMA, CD99, Factor XIIIa and Cyclin D1, supporting myoid 
differentiation typical of pericytes. The tumour showed diffuse 
dense nuclear expression of beta-catenin.
Conclusion: Though the occurrence is rare, SNGP exhibits highly 
distinctive histopathologic features, as seen in this case. As the 
clinical behaviour of SNGP has been poorly understood, more 
cases need to be reported for better establishment of treatment 
modalities. Heterogenous mutations in the beta-catenin gene and 
expression of cyclin D1 have been identified in SNGP.

Submandibular adult type rhabdomyoma – a case report
A. Alves*, R. Almeida, C. Courelas, J. Madeira, J. Gama, M.A. 
Cipriano
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário, Portugal
Background & objectives: Rhabdomyoma is a benign skeletal 
muscle neoplasm, mainly cardiac. Extracardiac locations are rare. 
Morphologically, it is categorized as foetal, genital or adult types, 
depending on the degree of differentiation. Some cases are associ-
ated with PTCH1 mutations and with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome.
Methods: We present a case of a 68-year-old male with a painless, 
submandibular mass, slowly growing for one year. The ultrasound 
study showed a well-defined mass consistent with the diagnosis 
of lipoma. He underwent surgical excision and the hypothesis of 
lipoma was doubted by the surgeon, due to the gross features. There 
was no relevant medical history.
Results: Gross examination showed a well-circumscribed nodular 
lesion with 6,2x5,8x4,2cm, weighting 47g, with a yellowish, slightly 
lobulated outer surface, uniform elastic brown on cut surface.
Histologically, it had expansile growth and was non-encapsulated, 
faintly lobulated. The cells were polygonal with abundant, 
eosinophilic and granular cytoplasm and the nuclei were round to 
oval, sometimes with prominent nucleoli. Some cells had vacuolated 
cytoplasm, resembling spider webs. Mitoses and necrosis were 
absent. Complementary immunohistochemical studies revealed 
diffuse positivity to desmin, and negativity to S-100 protein, CD68, 
TFE3 and myogenin. It was rendered a final diagnosis of adult type 
rhabdomyoma.
Conclusion: Adult type rhabdomyoma is a benign neoplasm 
arising mainly in the head and neck region. Although rare, it is the 
commonest subtype of extracardiac locations and can be linked 
to a loss of function of the PTCH1 gene, which is, nevertheless, 
more frequent in the foetal type. There is a reported association to 
Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome.
The main differential diagnosis are alveolar soft part sarcoma and 
granular cell tumour, the first one being a malignant entity with 
fusion gene involving TFE3.

Mnejja, T. Boudawara, R. Kallel
*Department of Pathology, Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, 
Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Primary nasopharyngeal papillary adeno-
carcinoma (PNPA) is a low-grade neoplasm with low propensity for 
recurrence and metastasis. Only few cases have been reported in the 
literature. We report here a new case of this rare entity to discuss its 
clinicopathological features.
Methods: The histological features of PNPA occurring in a 
25-year-old man who presented with unilateral nasal obstruction 
are described with a review of the related literature.
Results: Nasal endoscopy showed a peduncle mass in the right nasal 
cavity. Cerebral scannography revealed an 18 mm tumour located in 
the upper wall of nasopharynx. Nasopharynx biopsy was performed. 
In microscopic examination, the tumour has a papillary architecture, 
with hyalinised fibrovascular cores lined by cuboidal to columnar 
cells with round vesicular nuclei presenting mild nuclear atypia. 
Some cells had nuclear groove. Nuclear pseudoinclusion and mito-
sis were absent. There was neither necrosis nor psammoma body. 
Immunohistochemistry revealed that the tumour cells were positive 
for thyroid tissue factor-1 (TTF-1), keratin 7, keratin 19, epithelial

membrane antigen, keratin 5/6, and negative for protein S100 and 
thyroglobulin. The diagnosis of PNPA was made.
Conclusion: PNPA is a rare subtype of conventional nasopharyn-
geal adenocarcinoma accounting for less than 0.48% of all malig-
nant nasopharyngeal tumours. It is characterized by a papillary 
architecture and an unusual expression of TTF-1. Pathologists 
should be aware to distinguish it from thyroid papillary carci-
noma due to morphological similarities. The negativity for thy-
roglobulin supports the diagnosis of PNPA.

*Department of pathology, Chonnam National University Medi-
cal School, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related 
multiphenotypic sinonasal carcinoma (HMSC) is an emerged tumour 
restricted to sinonasal tract. We will describe an unique feature of 
HMSC, discuss its distinction from other tumours, and draw attention 
to the uncommon HPV subtypes in given cases.
Methods: We selected 3 HMSC cases diagnosed between 2015 and 
2021 at our hospital. Immunohistochemical stains for p16, c-kit, p63, 
and SOX-10 were performed along with HPV DNA test using PANA 
RealTyper™ HPV Kit (PANAGENE Inc., South Korea).
Results: All cases were from men aged 60 to 86 years (mean, 
75), and all tumours were larger than 3cm in size (mean, 4cm). 
Histologically, solid nests of basaloid cells and cribriform pattern 
were the main characteristics. Every case demonstrated atypia of 
surface squamous epithelial layer, morphologically similar to the 
squamous cell carcinoma in situ. All 3 cases showed strong, dif-
fuse positivity for p16, and it is noteworthy that positive results 
were also obtained in the surface squamous epithelial layer, 
including the lesion showing the atypical change. As a result of 
the HPV DNA test, all three cases had different high-risk HPV 
subtypes (18, 56, and 82, respectively).
Conclusion: These results may suggest the possibility that the 
dominant HPV subtypes of HMSC in East Asia are different from 
those in the West. Still, an accurate interpretation is difficult due 
to the limited number of cases.

High-grade transformation of acinic cell carcinoma with 
amplification of HER2 gene
C. Huang*, Y. Lee, M. Hsieh
*National Taiwan University Hospital, Taiwan
Background & objectives: Acinic cell carcinoma is a salivary gland 
carcinoma showing serous acinar differentiation. It is usually slow-
growing with a 10-year survival of almost 90%. However, high-grade 
transformation has been rarely reported, and is associated with a 
significantly worse outcome.
Methods: We reported a newly diagnosed acinic cell carcinoma 
with high-grade transformation in the parotid gland of a 64-year-
old female. The clinical history, morphologic features and 
immunohistochemical profiles were described. HER2/neu gene 
amplification was analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH).
Results: Our case presented with a right parotid 3 cm-sized 
painful tumour with facial paresis for four months. She under-
went total parotidectomy, and the histology revealed focal 
classic acinic cell carcinoma. High-grade transformation 
was identified, characterized by anaplastic cells with abun-
dant cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei, arranged in irregular 
islands with comedonecrosis. Both the classic and high-grade 
components exhibited positive nuclear staining for NR4A3. 
The high-grade area showed stronger expression of cyclin D1 
and p53, and had a higher Ki-67 index. These high-grade foci 
also demonstrated 2+ staining of HER-2/neu. FISH confirmed 
the HER-2 gene amplification in the high-grade component 
(HER2/CEP17: 2.13; HER2 copy number 5.5), but not in the 
conventional component.
Conclusion: Prevalence of HER2 positivity in salivary gland carci-
noma varied significantly between histological subtypes. Here, we 
described the first case of acinic cell carcinoma with HER2 gene 
amplification confirmed by FISH. The amplification detected in 
the high-grade foci but not in the conventional area further sug-
gested the possible role of HER2 in the pathogenesis of high-grade 
transformation in acinic cell carcinoma. Recognizing this molecu-
lar event is crucial because HER2 is an important potential target 
for therapies.

Desmoplastic small round cell tumour of parotid gland: a rare 
case report
N. Chandran*, K. Sigamani
*Karpaga Vinayaga Institute of Medical Sciences and Research 
Centre, India
Background & objectives: Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumour 
(DSRCT) is an uncommon malignant mesenchymal tumour that affects 
mostly children and young adults with a striking male predilection and 
it commonly involves the soft tissue of abdomen and pelvis.
Methods: Around 6% DSRCT”s have been reported in various extra-
abdominal sites. Primary involvement of Parotid gland by DSRCT is 
extremely uncommon with only seven cases reported in literature. Here 
we present another case of DSRCT involving the parotid gland of a 
male patient. The detailed clinical, radiological and pathological find-
ings of this case have been analysed and presented.
Results: A 54 year old male presented with a swelling in 
right parotid region for 6 months duration. On examination, 
the swelling was 6x5 cm in size, hard and was lifting the 
ear lobe. CT neck revealed a right parotid mass. FNAC was 
inconclusive and thus right total parotidectomy was done. 
Grossly, the tumour was grey white with areas of necrosis. 
Microscopic examination showed salivary gland parenchyma 
with an adjacent malignant neoplasm composed of uniform 
small round cells with scant eosinophilic cytoplasm and regu-
lar round nuclei arranged in nests separated by broad bands 
of desmoplastic fibrous stroma. IHC revealed S100, CKAE1/
AE3, desmin and synaptophysin positivity. Final diagnosis of 
DSRCT was made.
Conclusion: DSRCT is considered as a tumour of uncertain his-
togenesis. Extra-abdominal DSRCT involving the parotid gland 
should be differentiated from other primary salivary gland tumours 
and several small round blue cell tumours. The tumour shows poly-
phenotypic differentiation expressing epithelial, mesenchymal and 
neuroendocrine markers in IHC studies. Molecular studies show 
characteristic translocation, t(11,22) with EWSR-WT1 gene fusion. 
Extra-abdominal DSRCT involving Parotid gland poses diagnos-
tic challenge. Careful microscopic examination aided by IHC and 
molecular studies will help in diagnosing this uncommon mesen-
chymal tumour.

Mandibular osteosarcoma: a retrospective study with review 
of the literature
S. Makni*, Y. Loukil, M. Triki, I. Saguem, C. Chaari, W. Ghribi, 
T. Boudawara, M. Mellouli
*Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Osteosarcomas are the most common 
bone sarcomas. They are preferentially located in the long bones of 
the limbs. Mandibular localization is rare, only a few cases have been 
reported in the literature.
Methods: we present a study of 6 cases diagnosed in the depart-
ment of pathology at the CHU Habib Bourguiba in Sfax over a 
period of 10 years (2012-2021)
Results: The mean age was 40 years (extreme: 24-54). Four of 
the patients were men (sex-ratio:2). A history of irradiation was 
noted in two cases. All tumours were located in the body of the 
mandible. The average tumour size was 6.5cm (extreme: 3.5-10 
cm), the histological type was chondroblastic osteosarcoma in 5 
cases and osteoblastic in one case. Four out of six patients had 
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The histological evaluation of 
the therapeutic effect showed a stable calcified appearance of the 
tumour in one case and tumour necrosis rates of 20%, 30% and 40% 
for the others. Surgical margins were positive in 5 cases.
Conclusion: Mandibular osteosarcoma is a rare tumour; the most 
common histological type is chondroblastic, then osteoblastic and 
fibroblastic osteosarcoma with frequencies of 48%, 29% and 23% 
respectively. Its prognosis depends mainly on the quality of surgical 
excision. A surgical margin of at least 1 cm was recommended 
to avoid recurrence. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy prevents rapid 
disease progression and reduces tumour size.

Benign smooth muscle proliferations of the tongue. Retrospec-
tive cohort study of a case series in a 31-year single institution
M. Bronte Anaut*, J. Arredondo Montero, A. Larrea, G. Aísa 
Rivera, A. Echegoyen Silanes, J.M. Elizalde Eguinoa, P. Fernan-
dez Seara
*Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: Leiomyomas are benign spindle cell 
tumours. Less than 1% are seen in the head and neck area. The defini-
tive diagnosis is established upon histology. The differential diagnosis 
includes benign and malignant soft tissue tumours that may arise in 
the tongue.
Methods: We performed a retrospective search for cases signed-
out as leiomyoma or hamartoma in the pathology database between 
the time interval of January 1990 and December 2021. A total of 
5 cases were identified for which slides and blocks were avail-
able. The medical records were reviewed. All lesions located on 
the tongue but with different diagnosis were excluded from this 
analysis.
Results: 4 patients were women. Median age was 65 years (2 
months–89 years). Three patients had complaints of a slow-growing 
and painless mass. One patient referred occasional bleeding. At 
birth, the infant had no anatomical alterations of craniofacial 
structures or midline defects. On physical examination, the lesion 
was located: dorsal lingual surface (N=2), tip of tongue (N=2) 
and right lateral border (N=1). Surgical resection of all lesions 
was performed. Histologically we had three different variants of 
benign smooth muscle proliferations: angioleiomyoma (N=3), non-
vascular leiomyoma (N=1) and leiomyomatous hamartoma (N=1). 
During follow-up, there was no evidence of local recurrence or the 
appearance of leiomyomas in other body locations.
Conclusion: Leiomyomas are benign lesions in which surgical 
resection is curative in most cases. Therefore, despite being infre-
quent lesions in the oral cavity, compared to other anatomical loca-
tions, it is necessary to think about them when the pathologist is 
faced with a soft tissue lesion in this location, relying whenever 
necessary on complementary immunohistochemical studies.

Diagnostic challenge: rare secretory carcinoma subtype identi-
fied in a parotid carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma
I. Mergeanu*, O.M. Patrascu, A. Voinovici, M. Sajin, M. Costache
*University Emergency Hospital Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Salivary gland secretory carcinomas rep-
resent a relatively new entity, whereas carcinomas ex pleomorphic 
adenoma account for a modest percentage of salivary glands tumours. 
Therefore, the adjoining of the two appears to be a rather shy occur-
rence in practice.
Methods: Our Department of Pathology received a total 
parotidectomy specimen, samples from which were fixed 
with 10% buffered formalin and processed by conventional 
histopathological methods, using paraffin embedding, sectioning 
and Haematoxylin–Eosin (HE) staining, as well as PAS and 
mucicarmine staining. Afterwards, the sections were deparaffinized 
and prepared for immunohistochemical staining, using the 
following markers: CK7, p63, S100, GATA3 and Ki67.
Results: We report the case of a 51-year-old male with a 15-year 
history of an asymptomatic mass in the parotid region. Gross 
examination revealed a spheric, white, firm tumour. Microscopic 
examination identified a heterogenous, encapsulated mass present-
ing ductoglandular and solid structures, embedded in fibro-hyalin 
stroma. Tumoural cells exhibited cito-nuclear atypia, eosinophilic 
cytoplasm, mucous cells and intraluminal secretions that stained 
positive for PAS and mucicarmine. Tumoural cells stained positive 
for CK7, S100, GATA3, negative for p63, with Ki67 positive in 
10% of them. Pleomorphic adenoma looking nodules were identi-
fied adjacent to the malignant proliferation. Thus, the diagnosis of 
carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma, secretory carcinoma subtype 
with focal high-grade areas has been established.
Conclusion: Secretory carcinoma of the salivary glands or 
mammary analogue secretory carcinoma is a relatively new and 
rare entity that needs additional special and immunohistochemical 
stains to differentiate it from the multitude of histological subtypes. 
The occurrence of this subtype in a rather infrequent carcinoma 
ex-pleomorphic adenoma further advocates for the need to carefully 
assess all histological and immunohistochemical characteristics, given 
the poor prognosis of the high-grade variant and treatment options.

Unique initial manifestation of salivary gland adenoid cystic 
carcinoma as a solitary liver metastasis
D. Myoteri, E. Stoupi, J. Koskinas, D. Tiniakos*
*Department of Pathology, Aretaieio Hospital, Medical School, 
National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: Liver metastases from salivary gland 
tumours are rare and presenting as the initial manifestation of disease 
is extremely rare with only four cases reported to date.
Methods: A 68-year-old man discovered elevated GGT and alka-
line phosphatase during routine laboratory tests. He was further

investigated with computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, 
which revealed a large liver mass measuring 16 cm in maximum 
diameter, occupying most of the right hepatic lobe. The mass had 
imaging characteristics of cholangiocarcinoma and a CT-guided 
needle biopsy was performed.
Results: Histopathological examination showed fragments of an 
epithelial neoplasm with adenoid cystic and focally cribriform 
growth pattern embedded in hyalinized stroma, and necrotic tis-
sue. Neoplastic cells were small, with scant cytoplasm and oval to 
angulated, minimally pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei, with 
palisading and basaloid areas peripherally, consistent with myoepi-
thelial origin. Mitoses were not identified. Almost all neoplastic 
cells were positive for keratin 7(K7), K19, EMA and CD117 and 
the myoepithelial component was positive for p63. Morphologi-
cal and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with meta-
static adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). Clinical examination had 
revealed a 3 cm palpable neck mass, which after fine-needle biopsy 
was proved to be an ACC of the submandibular gland.
Conclusion: ACCs run a slow but progressive course and have a high likeli-
hood of distant metastasis. The most common sites of metastases are lung 
and bone, followed by brain and liver. Liver metastases are often synchro-
nous or metachronous with multiorgan metastatic disease and only a handful 
of studies of isolated liver metastasis have been reported in the literature. Due 
to the absence of consensus concerning the appropriate treatment, a multidis-
ciplinary approach is necessary to manage this rare and aggressive neoplasm.

Spindle cell lipoma in an unusual location, a case report
M.M. Buda*, È. Iglesias Martinez, N. Santiago Quispe, A.P. Mar-
tinez Aracil, A. Sifre Ruiz, A.I. Ruiz de Angulo Otxaran, M.J. de 
Diego Rivas
*Araba University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: Lipomas are the most common mesen-
chymal tumours, although only 0.6% of them occur in the larynx. We 
report the case of a 62-year-old man who presented with dysphonia and 
dyspnea because of a supraglottic mass.
Methods: A CT was performed which revealed a fatty density 
lesion dependent on the left ventricle. The patient underwent 
laryngeal microsurgery. Afterwards, light microscopy, 
immunohistochemistry (IHQ) and molecular pathology studies 
were made. A literature revision also was performed.
Results: A 2.2 x 1.5 cm exophytic lesion was received. Gross 
pathology of the specimen showed yellow to orange cut sur-
face. Microscopic examination revealed a well-circumscribed 
and non-encapsulated mass underlying normal appearing 
squamous mucosa. The tumour consisted of mature adipo-
cytes, bland spindle cells and occasional pleomorphic multi-
nucleated giant cells arranged in a “floret-like” pattern. The 
stroma alternated myxoid and collagen rich areas. With IHQ 
studies, stromal cells showed CD34 expression. The adipocyte 
component was negative for CDK4 and MDM-2. Ki-67 and 
PHH3 were <1%. Molecular pathology revealed deletion of 
one copy of the RB1 gene and absence of amplification of the 
MDM-2 gene. Thus, spindle cell/pleomorphic lipoma (SC/PL) 
diagnostic was made.
Conclusion: Laryngeal spindle cell lipomas are rare, with only six 
cases reported to date. Due to their benign nature, and in order to avoid 
overtreatment, it is important to distinguish them from a more aggres-
sive entity such as well-differentiated liposarcoma/atypical spindle 
cell lipomatous tumour (WDLS). SC/PLs and WDLS have multiple 
histopathological similarities, that’s why the key to distinguish them 
is based on cytogenetic analysis. WDLS does not show changes in the 
RB1 gene, while it exhibits MDM-2 gene amplification.

Tepeoğlu, B.H. Özdemir
*Başkent University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathol-
ogy, Ankara, Turkey
Background & objectives: The nasal chondromesenchymal hamar-
toma (NCMH) is a rare benign tumour of sinonasal tract with predi-
lection to paediatric age groups. We present a case of NCMH with 
characteristic histomorphological features, differential diagnosis and 
review the literature.
Methods: An 8- year-old-girl presented with occasional left sided 
epistaxis for a year and absence of breathing through the left nos-
tril. She had a history of adrenal neuroblastoma with partial adrenal 
insufficiency and oral corticosteroid therapy. Differential diagno-
sis was antrochoanal polyp, angiofibroma inverted papilloma with 
endoscopic examination.
Results: Computed tomography scan revealed a 48x40 mm sized 
mass; in nasal passage, attached to the septum without bone 
destruction. Endoscopic excision of the mass showed polypoid 
white mass with vaguely nodular appearance. Microscopically 
mass was covered with respiratory epithelium. Stroma was mainly 
consisted of disorganized benign spindle cells distributed among 
fine collagen fibres with focal cartilaginous tissue. There were 
sparse areas with myxoid changes and occasional small vessels, 
nerve fibres and dilated cystic spaces. No signs of cellular atypia, 
necrosis and mitoses have been identified. The spindle cells was 
negative for muscle cell markers (Desmin, SMA and Myogenin). 
The Ki-67 proliferation index was less than 1%. Final diagnosis 
was NCMH.
Conclusion: NCMH is a rare tumour of upper respiratory tract 
and may mimic other benign and malignant lesions clinically. The 
correct diagnosis is essential for proper management. Histopatho-
logical features of NCMH are of great assistance for establishing 
the diagnosis.

Bilateral subgemmal neurogenous plaque of the tongue: a case 
report
L. Hasanaliyeva, E. Yılmaz Akçay, S. Yagci*, A. Ok Atılgan, A. 
Zeynalova
*Başkent University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathol-
ogy, Ankara, Turkey
Background & objectives: Subgemmal neurogenous plaque(SNP) is 
a biphasic neural structure associated with the taste buds and presents 
as an asymptomatic, normally coloured, papule located in the posterior 
lateral border of the tongue. We present a rare case of bilateral SNP 
on tongue.
Methods: A 38-year-female patient presented with asymptomatic 
wounds on bilateral posterior lateral sides of tongue. Hashimoto’s 
thyroiditis is present in medical profile and she doesn’t smoke. 
Bilateral biopsy was performed to rule out neoplasia.
Results: The surface of both biopsy materials were ulcerated, 
cut surface were beige coloured, and had soft consistency. 
Histopathologic examination revealed same features for both 
biopsies¸ neural plexus composed of irregular, small bundles 
and scattered separate neural cells underlying the oral squamous 
epithelium, which showed normal taste buds. Neural cells were 
spindle-shaped, with oval normochromic nucleus and wavy 
eosinophilic cytoplasm with no nuclear atypia or mitosis. Deeper 
parts composed of small nerve fascicles showing scant ganglion 
cells. There was accompanying reactive lymphoid tissue with

prominent germinal centres. Immunohistochemically, neural 
cells were strongly positive for S100. SNP was considered in the 
presence of histopathological findings.
Conclusion: SNPs can be confused with neural neoplasms for 
their morphologic similarities. Oral pathologists must be aware 
of the clinical and histopathological features of SNP to avoid 
misdiagnosis.

Mammary analog secretory carcinoma of parotid gland, report 
of two cases
S. Yagci*, E. Yılmaz Akçay, A. Ok Atılgan, B.H. Özdemir, Ö. 
Günhan
*Başkent University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathol-
ogy, Ankara, Turkey
Background & objectives: Mammary analog secretary 
carcinoma(MASC) of salivary gland is a tumour of low histologic 
grade. Histopathologic features, immunohistochemical profile 
resembles secretory carcinoma of breast and share highly specific 
genetic translocation, ETV6-NTRK3. Differential diagnosis of MACS 
is adenocarcinoma-NOS and acinic cell carcinoma.
Methods: We report two cases, both in parotid glands and one 
with reccurence after 15 months. Patients were 62-year-old male 
and 50-year-old female, both presented with mass at right parotid 
localization. They both had parotidectomy, one had right neck 
dissection.
Results: On macroscopic examination, tumours had lobulated con-
tours, solid, firm and white coloured. Histopathological examina-
tion revealed well circumscribed tumour with microcystic pattern. 
The glandular spaces filled with an eosinophilic homogenous 
secretory material. Tumour cells had vesicular, bland looking 
nuclei with prominent nucleoli with abundant pale pink cytoplasm. 
Immunohistochemically, cells showed diffuse and strong staining 
for CK7, CK8/18, S100, mammaglobin, S100, GCDFP15, and 
vimentin. Reccurent tumour had same morphology and immuno-
histochemical stainings with first diagnosis.
Conclusion: MASC is a morphologically and molecularly well-
defined salivary gland neoplasm. Differentiation of MASC from 
its mimickers is important due to their differences in behaviour.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour arising from mel-
anotic schwannoma: a case report and literature review
S. Graja*, M. Mellouli, S. Makni, W. Ben Makhlouf, N. Gouiaa, 
S. Charfi, T. Boudawara, M. Manai
*Department of Pathology, Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, 
Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour 
(MPNST) arising from schwannoma is extremely rare. Our objectives 
are to present a new case of MPNST arising from schwannoma, to 
discuss the different differential diagnoses and to review the relative 
literature.
Methods: A 56-year-old man presented to the department of 
maxillofacial surgery with a painful temporo-zygomatic mass. 
The patient had a history of melanotic schwannoma incompletely 
resected six years ago. Magnetic resonance imaging performed 
demonstrated a mass arising from temporal muscle measuring 
50-mm. Surgical excision of the tumour was performed.
Results: Histopathologic analysis of the tumour showed sheets of 
large polygonal tumour cells with abundant basophilic cytoplasm, 
round nuclei and distinct nucleoli. These cells showed moderate 
pleomorphism and increased mitoses (10 mitotic figures per 10 
HPFs). Focally, there were fascicles of residual schwannian cells. 
The tumour presented focally necrosis area. Immunohistochemistry 
for PS100 was performed showing a diffuse and strongly expres-
sion in both epithelioid and schwannian cells. Immunostaining for 
cytokeratin and HMB45 were negative. The diagnosis of atypical 
schwannoma was ruled out due to the presence of atypical mitoses 
and necrosis. Melanoma was also excluded due to the negativity 
for HMB45. We concluded to an epithelioid MPNST arising from 
schwannoma.
Conclusion: MPNST arising from schwannoma can show typically 
epithelioid or spindle-cell histology. Epithelioid subtype is rare. 
Its most common locations are the trunk and extremities. Our 
case is distinguished because of its unusual location. Differential 
diagnosis includes melanoma and cellular schwannoma. 
Histomorphologic similarity with these tumours and the lack 
of specific immunohistochemical antibodies make establishing 
the right diagnosis challenging. MPNST should be considered 
in patients with a clinical diagnosis of schwannoma. Prompt 
recognition of this tumour allows for early curative treatment.

Cavernous venous malformation of the orbit: a series of 16 
cases and review of the literature
M.E. Brizzi*, S. López-Muñoz-MUÑOZ, I. Colmenero, E. 
Ruiz-Bravo
*Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Spain
Background & objectives: Cavernous venous malformation (CVM) 
is the most common benign orbital lesion of adults. This “cavernous 
haemangioma” is now considered a venous malformation. We describe 
the clinicopathological features of 16 cases and review the literature on 
its aetiology and controversial terminology.
Methods: We searched for all orbital vascular lesions (biopsy or 
extirpation) diagnosed in our Department between January 2007 
and December 2021. Standard slides stained with haematoxylin 
and eosin were examined in all cases. Clinical data were obtained 
from electronic medical records. Medical literature research was 
done using PubMed. Results were presented in descriptive form.
Results: In the last 15 years, 70 periocular vascular lesions were 
diagnosed in our centre, 16 of which were CVM. The mean age 
was 49 years and 68% were female. The most common presenting 
complaints were a palpable mass (43%) and vision loss (25%). 
Two cases were incidentally detected on imaging. Over 44% of 
lesions were located in the intraconal space. One patient had bilat-
eral lesions. Histologically, all lesions were nodular, encapsulated 
and contained large vascular channels lined by mature endothelial 
cells. The stromal component was fibrotic and paucicellular, with 
minimal inflammation. There were no evident arterial elements. 
Chronic thrombosis was found only in one case. Surgical treatment 
was curative.
Conclusion: Despite the confusing historical nomenclature, the 
so-called cavernous haemangiomas are not tumours as they do 
not possess a proliferative endothelium. Their slow growth is 
attributed to ectasia and hypertrophy. Therefore, CVM should be 
best regarded as slow flow venous malformations. Recently, some 
genetic alterations have been described, such as chromosomal 
losses at 13q and EWSR1/FUS-NFATC2 rearrangement, but further 
investigation is needed to clarify the aetiology of this lesion.

Thyrolipoma, a case report with literature review
Z. Lajmi*, T. Tlili, S. Mabrouk, Y. Fejji, B. Sriha, M. Mokni
*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Thyrolipoma (TL) also called adenolipoma 
of the thyroid gland is distinctively rare. Less than 50 cases have been 
reported in the English literature so far. We describe a representative 
case of TL along with a brief literature review.
Methods: A 57-year-old woman, with no relevant medical his-
tory, presented with a painless neck lump which have been slowly 
increasing in size for 2 years. Physical examination and ultra-
sound imaging showed a well defined, 4 cm, predominantly cystic, 
TIRADS 3 nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid gland. A left 
hemithyroidectomy was performed.
Results: Surgical specimen weighted 28 g. The left lobe of the thyroid 
measured 4,5 x 4 x 4 cm. Cut section showed a 3.7 cm, medio-lobar, 
well-circumscribed, mainly cystic nodule, with haemorrhage and a few 
brittle yellow foci. Two smaller, well defined, solid nodules measuring 
4 and 7 mm were also identified. On microscopic examination, all 3 
nodules were surrounded by fibrous capsules and consisted of mature 
adipocytes admixed with bland-looking thyroid follicles. The adipose 
lobules accounted for at least 40% of the total nodules sections. The 
remainder of the thyroid tissue was unremarkable.
Conclusion: Most reported cases of TL occurred in women, var-
ied in size from 0.3 to 25 cm and presented as a solitary lesion 
or in association with multinodular thyroid hyperplasia, papillary 
carcinoma or thyroiditis. TL should be distinguished from thy-
rolipomatosis characterized by fat diffusely distributed throughout 
the thyroid gland. The two conditions can rarely coexist. Some 
thyrolipomas present as extrathyroidal nodules and should not be 
mistaken with enlarged parathyroid glands which normally contain 
adipose tissue and may display a follicular pattern.

Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma of maxillary bones: two case 
reports
A. Fitouri*, P. Khneisser, M. Classe, C. Ngo, S. Cotteret, O. 
Casiraghi
*Pathology Department, Salah Azaiez Institute, Tunis, Tunisia; 
Research Laboratory LR21SP01, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (MCS) is 
a very rare and aggressive malignant bone tumour occuring in femur, 
pelvis, ribs and facial bones, with 25% of cases in the jaws.
Methods: We report two cases of maxillary MCS in a 65 and a 26 
years-old women respectively, who presented a large submucousal 
tumour of the hard palate. In the first case, TDM and MRI were in 
favour of a chondrosarcoma.
Results: On biopsies, the first case presented a proliferation made 
of large atypical cells lying in a chondroid matrix, surrounded by 
small foci of small round blue cells showing « crush artefacts ». 
The second case presented atypical and mitotic small blue cell nests 
densely packed around vessels and separated by chondromyxoid 
trabeculae. The chondroid component showed a nuclear positivity 
for PS100+ and were SATB2-, MDM2-, CD99- and NKX2.2-; and 
conversally, the« mesenchymatous » component, a membranous 
positivity for CD99+, a nuclear positivity for NKX2.2+ and were 
PS100-. The presence of a HEY1-NCOA2 gene fusion confirmed 
the diagnosis of MCS. Surgery was performed, followed by radio-
therapy in the first case.
Conclusion: MCS is a biphasic tumour, with an undifferentiated 
small blue cell component and a well-differentiated cartilaginous 
component, and a highly specific HEY1-NCOA2 gene fusion. 
When facing a chondroid tumours of the jaws, both chondrosar-
coma and chondroblastic osteosarcoma hypotheses must be raised, 
but small blue cell foci that could suggest a MCS must be searched 
for. Conversally, it is important in malignant blue cell tumours, to 
look for foci of cartilaginous differentiation. A molecular confir-
mation is necessary in this tricky diagnosis.

cavity and orbit
J.P. Skliris*, S. Papadopoulou, K. Marini, N. Pastelli, I. Dimitri-
adis, I. Matzarakis, S. Papaemmanouil
*Papanikolaou General Hospital of Thessaloniki, Greece
Background & objectives: Neurofibromas are benign peripheral nerve 
sheath tumours with infiltrative potential. We present a case of a large 
and unusually located sporadic neurofibroma that occupied a great 
extent of craniofacial regions.
Methods: Otolaryngologists of our institution, following clinical 
examination and imaging, located and were able to biopsy a large 
tumour protruding from the left maxillary sinus of a 59-year old 
female patient. This mass seemed to be extending inside the left 
nasal cavity and possibly reaching the adjacent orbit with radio-
logical signs of osseous erosion.
Results: Histopathology report described a neoplastic lesion 
consisting of sparse, uniform cells with wavy nuclei inside a 
collagenous stroma. Only rare mitoses and no necrosis or atypia 
were observed. Mitotic index using Ki-67 was calculated about 
1%. During ancillary examinations, the neoplastic population 
stained for S100, CD34 (focally) and EMA (focally), whereas 
was negative for CD117, Ck8/18 and MelanA. The diagnosis of 
neurofibroma was concluded.
Conclusion: In conclusion, the case described aims to increase 
awareness among clinicians and diagnosticians of this very rare 
site of this already quite uncommon entity, with only a few cases 
described in the existing literature.

A forgotten entity in parotid gland lesions differential diag-
nosis – a case report
S. Antunes*, C. Dahlstedt Ferreira, R. Oliveira, M. Lopes 
Oliveira, D. Gomes Pinto
*Hospital Garcia de Orta, Portugal
Background & objectives: Haemangiomas are benign vascular abnor-
malities characterized by an increased proliferation and turnover of 
endothelial cells, accounting for 0.4-0.6% of all parotid gland tumours. 
They are common in infancy but extremely rare in adults, often misdi-
agnosed before surgical resection.
Methods: A 85-year-old woman presented in 2018 with a parotid 
nodule with 3x2,5cm. Between 2018 and 2021 she underwent 4 fine-
needle aspirations (FNA), all constituted by blood and few epithelial 
cells, all considered non-diagnostic. Computed Tomography scan 
and Magnetic Resonance Imaging were inconclusive, favouring a 
benign tumour, and suggesting the possibility of a vascular lesion.
Results: In January 2022 a tumourectomy was performed. Intraop-
eratively, a vascular lesion involving the deep lobe of parotid gland 
was identified. Grossly, the specimen measured 5,5x5x2 cm and 
weighted 216,5 g. The cut surface revealed a multinodular expansive 
brown lesion, with white areas. It measured 3,3x3,2x1,4 cm and was 
partially coincidental with the excision margin. Microscopically, a

predominantly capillary vascular proliferation without atypia was 
identified, with a multinodular arrangement, partially involving the 
adjacent parenchyma comprised of serous salivary glands showing 
signs of atrophy. There were occasional thrombi and signs of old and 
recent bleeding. The immunohistochemical study supported the diag-
nosis of haemangioma (CD34+, CD31+, Podoplanin-, AE1/AE3-, 
Smooth muscle actin-, HHV-8-).
Conclusion: We highlight the importance of considering hae-
mangiomas in the differential diagnosis of parotid tumours of 
adults. These are not usually considered due to their low preva-
lence in this population and are normally approached through 
FNA. This most often results in non-diagnostic aspirates, and 
ideally should be avoided to prevent iatrogenic hematomas. Diag-
nosis depends on integration of clinical and radiological data. 
When suspected, the patients should undergo early conservative 
surgery and a final diagnosis made on the surgical specimen.

Rhinocerebral mucormycosis: a report of 11 cases
M. Ben Thayer, F. Khanchel, I. Helal, S. Elfekih*, R. Hedhli, E. 
Ben Brahim, R. Jouini, A. Chadli
*Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Mucormycoses are rare aggressive fungal 
infections that are rapidly extensive and usually fatal. Rhinocerebral 
mucormycosis is the most common form. We aim to study the clinical 
and anatomopathological aspects of this rare and life-threatening entity.
Methods: We retrospectively studied all cases of rhinocerebral 
mucormycosis diagnosed at Habib Thameur’s hospital over a 
period of 13 years (from 2008 to 2020). Only cases confirmed by 
pathological examination were included in our study.
Results: Our sample consisted of 11 cases. They were eight men 
(72.7%) and three women (27.3%) with a sex ratio of 2.66. The age 
of the patients varied between 12 and 78 years with an average of 45 
years ±18.62. In this study, eight patients were immunocompromised. 
One patient was on long-term corticosteroid therapy for systemic lupus 
erythematosus, the 12-year-old patient had bone marrow aplasia, three 
patients were diabetics, one patient had acute myeloid leukaemia, one 
patient had IgM type immunodeficiency and one patient had lymph 
node tuberculosis. Two of our patients had orbital cellulitis, only one 
patient had proptosis and all the other patients had acute sinusitis.
Conclusion: Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is a rare and under-
diagnosed pathology. Its diagnosis is often challenging. It is a 
medico-surgical emergency. The diagnosis of certainty is based 
on pathological examination. Its management is based on surgery 
and antifungal treatment.It has poor prognosis with high morbidity 
and mortality rates. An early diagnosis is crucial and allows the 
rapid onset of appropriate treatment. A better knowledge of this 
pathology and its evocation, especially in immunocompromised 
patients, would improve the prognosis and survival rates.

Adenomatoid hyperplasia of minor salivary glands - a case 
report
E. Caranfil*, C. Cucu, A. Nicolau, D. Ciobanu-Apostol
*Spitalul Clinic Judetean de Urgenta "Sf.Spiridon", Iasi, Serviciul 
de Anatomie Patologica, Romania
Background & objectives: Adenomatoid hyperplasia of minor sali-
vary glands is a rare lesion occuring predominantly in the palate with 
some rare cases described in the buccal mucosa. It is of unknown aeti-
ology and imitates a salivary gland tumour.
Methods: A 60-year old man presented to the hospital for dys-
phagia and a 5 cm palatal mass was discovered. A biopsy was 
performed which came back as squamous cell carcinoma in situ. 
The mass was resected and was sent to the pathology department. 
Grossly the mass was covered by regular, smooth mucosa and 
resembled salivary gland parenchyma on the cut surface.
Results: Microscopically, scar tissue corresponding to the biopsy was 
identifiable. The epithelium presented pseudoepitheliomatous hyper-
plasia without dysplasia. The submucosa corresponded to mucous 
type acini with lobular architecture, separated by fine connective tis-
sue bands. Rare ducts were identifiable as well as extracellular mucus. 
No dysplastic or malignant features were present. Inflammation was 
minimal; predominantly lymphocytes and plasmocytes were appreci-
ated. The surgical resection margins were in contact with the acini.
Conclusion: Adenomatoid hyperplasia of the minor salivary glands is 
a rare benign lesion which can be cured by complete surgical resection. 
The clinical appearance can be in favour of a salivary gland tumour, 
therefore a biopsy is required in order to properly classify the lesion.

Oral carcinoma cuniculatum: a diagnostic challenge
N. Arı*, Ç. Oysu, L. Cinel
*Marmara University School of Medicine, Department of Pathol-
ogy, Turkey
Background & objectives: Carcinoma cuniculatum (CC) is a variant of 
squamous cell carcinoma characterized by crypt-like structures of squa-
mous epithelium with minimal atypia. Given its rarity and lack of atypia, 
it has been a diagnostic challenge. We present a mandibular case of CC.
Methods: Forty eight-year-old male patient presented with left 
mandibular pain lasting for 1,5 years. Multiple incisional biopsies 
showed almost no sign of malignancy, except minimal cytologic atypia 
and burrow-like growth pattern. However, the last incisional biopsy 
was diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma, considering radiologically 
detected extensive bone destruction. The patient underwent left 
hemimandibulectomy and ipsilateral cervical lymph node dissection.
Results: Macroscopic evaluation of the resection specimen 
revealed no distinct mass lesion, although some areas of the man-
dible were easy to cut. Histopathologic examination revealed a 
lesion which consisted of keratin-filled crypt-like structures lined 
by well differentiated squamous epithelium which showed multi-
ple foci of microabscesses and almost no cytologic atypia. Crypt-
like structures were extending deep into the underlying bone in a 
destructive fashion, suggesting a malignant process. No metastatic 
lymph node was observed. Immunohistochemistry results for p16 
and HPV were negative. All these findings taken into considera-
tion, the case was concluded to be compatible with CC, which is a 
very rare variant of squamous cell carcinoma.
Conclusion: This local aggressive histologic variant of squamous 
cell carcinoma remained under-diagnosed because of its extremely 
well differentiated nature and rare incidence. Some percentages of 
the cases are being reported as verrucous carcinoma (VC), since 
both entities show minimal cytologic atypia. However, unlike CC, 
VC shows invasion in a pushing manner. Very rare cases with 
lymph node and distant metastases have been reported. Our case 
report aims to raise awareness of such entity among pathologists 
and prevent misdiagnosis of this disease.

Primary mucosal melanoma of the nasal cavity, report of 5 
cases

*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Mucosal melanoma of the nasal 
cavity(MMNC) is extremely rare. Nevertheless, it is the most common 
mucosal melanoma of the head and neck region, with an increasing 
incidence in many western countries. We describe 5 additional cases 
with a literature review.
Methods: A retrospective study of 5 cases of MMNC, diagnosed 
and treated in our institution between 2000 and 2020. Clinical and 
pathological data were reviewed.
Results: Our series comprised 2 male and 3 female patients. The 
mean age at diagnosis was 63.2 years (range: 51-86). The most 
common symptoms at presentation were recurrent epistaxis (4/5 
cases) and unilateral nasal obstruction (1/5 cases). All patients 
were treated surgically. Tumours measured 1.5 to 5 cm. Histologi-
cally, 2 tumours consisted exclusively of spindle cells. 3 others 
were mixed composed of both spindle and epithelioid cells. Surgi-
cal margins were negative in only 2 cases. Tumour cells stained 
with HMB45 and Melan-A antibodies respectively in 5 and 4 cases. 
One patient developed bone metastasis and two others experienced 
local recurrence during a median follow-up of 26 months.
Conclusion: MMNC is highly aggressive. Therefore, T1 and T2 
stages were omitted in the 8th edition of the AJCC staging of these 
tumours. Prognosis is poor, with a 5-year survival rate less than 
40% in most published series. The diagnosis is often delayed due to 
the “hidden” tumour site and the non-specific clinical presentation. 
No optimal treatment therapy has yet been defined. A better under-
standing of the biology of this tumour will enable the identification 
of targetable oncogenic driver.

Persistent epistaxis – a neoplastic differential
M. Rodrigues*, R. Ilgenfritz
*Hospital Distrital de Santarém, Portugal
Background & objectives: Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma (BSNS) 
is a rare low-grade sarcoma with neural and myogenic differentiation. 
It was first described by Lewis et al. in 2012, and since then only about 
100 cases have been described.
Methods: We submit a case of a 59-year-old man that presents to 
the emergency department with persistent epistaxis from the left 
nasal cavity in the previous two days. Nasal endoscopy showed a 
voluminous neoformation on the left middle turbinate. Magnetic 
resonance imaging revealed a 40x25x74 mm well-delimited mass 
with gadolinium enhancement in the same topography. Endoscopic 
sinus surgery was then performed.
Results: Several elastic fragments with dimensions between 10 
and 45 mm were received. Microscopic examination revealed sec-
tions of respiratory mucosa intersected by a well-differentiated 
mesenchymal proliferation with a rich vascular stroma, composed 
by monomorphic spindle cells with clear nuclei. No mitosis, necro-
sis, perineural nor lymphovascular invasions were observed. Due 
to sample fragmentation, surgical margins were not assessed. The 
tumour cells exhibited focal staining for S100, SMA and β-catenin 
(both nuclear and cytoplasmic expression). CD34, Calponin, CK 
CAM5.2, CK AE1/AE3 and Desmin were negative. The lesion was 
diagnosed as BSNS.
Conclusion: BSNS oncogenesis is related to the PAX3 gene which 
is a transcription factor involved in the development of both muscle 
and neural tissues of nasal structures. Hence the characteristic 
staining pattern described. The symptoms are non-specific. It 
predominantly affects women, and 30-50% of cases recur. No 
cases of metastases have been reported and only one case of death 
due to disease is described. The differential diagnosis ranges from 
benign (e.g. glomangiopericytoma) to aggressive neoplasms with 
metastatic potential (e.g. synovial sarcoma).

A review of adenoid cystic carcinoma patients in Ireland
K. Kulakova*, R. O’Shea, C. Hegarty, C. Andrieu, S. Brennan, P. 
Casserly, S. Kennedy
*Research Foundation, Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, Dub-
lin, Ireland
Background & objectives: Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC) of head 
and neck is a relentlessly progressive tumour. EU incidence is 13 cases 
per million annually. RVEEH files were analysed over a 20-year period 
(2002/2021) to establish the clinico-pathologic and molecular findings 
in Ireland.
Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of ACC were retrieved from 
pathology files. All clinical information was reviewed, and material 
submitted for NGS-based WES including genes known to be asso-
ciated with ACC i.e.. MYB, MYBL, NOTCH, SPEN. A targeted 
Oncomine NGS mutation panel was also performed on 2 cases.
Results: From 15 identified cases, 4 were female and 11 male. The 
mean age was 45 (range: 20 to 72) at time of initial diagnosis. Primary 
tumour location; external auditory canal, nasal and oral cavity, 
lacrimal, parotid, and submandibular glands. All known histologic 
patterns were observed. Ten patients were treated by surgery and 
adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). Five patients were inoperable and were 
treated by RT. Two patients had a local recurrence and four patients 
developed systemic metastasis (follow-up period 42 to 153 months); 
sites included cervical and distant (pulmonary, renal, splenic). The 
average time to recurrence was 44 months. Six patients died on 
average 4 years post-diagnosis. Genetic analysis is underway.
Conclusion: From our findings, the incidence and prevalence 
of ACCs in Ireland appears to be in line with European average. 
There is a similar age range. In this study molecular findings will 
be correlated with clinical pathological characteristics in order to 
identify potential actionable genetic mutations.

The relic of the Blessed Maria Lorenza Longo founder of the 
“Hospital of the Incurables” in Naples. A paleopathological and 
paleoradiological study
C. Bellevicine*, A. Brunetti, G. Troncone, L. Ventura, M. 
Traversari
*Public Health Department, Università degli Studi di Napoli “Fed-
erico II”, Naples, Italy
Background & objectives: Maria Lorenza, born in Spain, followed 
the husband Joan Llonc (Longo in italian), the chancellor of King 
Fernando, in Naples. She founded the Hospital of the Incurables. This 
study aims to verify the historical accounts about Maria Longo.
Methods: Maria Longo died in 1539 and was beatified in October 
2021. She suffered from a disabling disease attributed either to poi-
soning, syphilis or rheumatoid arthritis. Before the beatification, 
a scientific inspection of her relic was approved by the Curia. In 
particular, a 16-slice CT scanning with multiplanar reconstructions 
(MPR) and volumetric (3D) rendering was performed.
Results: The relic is represented by a completely skeletonized 
calvarium and was examined through both visual and digital radi-
ology inspection on different projections. The biological profile

confirmed the female sex of the relic, whereas the estimated 
age at death was earlier than that proposed by historians. Nei-
ther vitamin nor nutrient deficiencies were found. The syphilis 
hypothesized by textual sources was excluded. A small rounded 
osteoma was detected by CT scan on the endocranial surface 
of the frontal bone. Interestingly, postmortem alterations of the 
relic were clearly visible at the top of the calvarium, demon-
strating the worship of the relic since the death of the Blessed 
Maria Longo.
Conclusion: The paleopathological and paleoradiological study 
of the relic of the Blessed Maria Longo revealed a woman whose 
death occurred at a younger age than that reported by textual 
sources. Maria Longo neither suffered of syphilis nor experienced 
dietary deficiencies. Her relic showed signs of worshiping dating 
from the early years after the death.

The Neapolitan Hospital for Incurables and the life and work 
of Domenico Cotugno
M. Marino*, E. Manzillo
*IRCCS Regina Elena Natl Cancer Inst. Rome, Italy
Background & objectives: The purpose of this contribute is to 
describe the activities of Hospital for Incurables in Naples and to 
mention Domenico Cotugno’s life. He was an Italian scientist famous 
in all Europe for his research activities and views of modern medicine.
Methods: According to our literature search, Maria Longo, the 
wife of Juan Lonc (Longo), Minister of the King Ferdinand the 
Catholic of Catalonia, founded in 1522 the Hospital of Incurables 
(people who nobody wanted to cure), and during the following 
years and centuries monastic orders were engaged in this Hospital, 
which was also considered the “Saint’s Hospital” (among them 
Luigi Gonzaga).
Results: People affected by severe invalidating diseases were 
accepted in the Hospital: paralysis, epilepsy, icterus, syphilis, 
burns were among the diseases cured in the Hospital. The centre 
was so famous in Europe that many Gran Tour Tourists visited 
the Hospital, which was also a university site, during their trip to 
Naples. Domenico Cotugno, born in Ruvo pugliese in 1736 and 
graduated in Medicine at the Salerno medical school, became an 
assistant at the Hospital for incurables and, in 1761, professor of 
Surgery. He was professor of Anatomy and Director for 30 years 
of the Hospital, favouring a centre devoted to modify, with modern 
rules, the perspectives of the diseases.
Conclusion: Domenico Cotugno was convinced that medicine 
has a strong social commitment: to cure and to save as many per-
sons as possible, simple persons as well as nobles. Cotugno’s sci-
entific activities on acqueducts of the human inner ear, on "De 
sedibus variolarum syntagma" were famous in Italy and Europe 
through the 18th century. For his promotion of vaccines, in Naples 
in 1807 Cotugno was named president of a committee promoting 
the vaccine against Smallpox. He was an outstanding example of 
physician-humanist.

From war to earthquake. 100 years of Institute of Pathology 
University of Zagreb School of Medicine
S. Seiwerth*, D. Galešić Ljubanović, M. Kolić, S. Sikirić
*UZSM, Croatia
Background & objectives: WW 1 with all its horror led also to 
destruction of 3 out of 4 empires. In this, 1917. after 100 years of 
struggle with the Austrian Monarchy, founding of Faculty of Medicine 
was finally granted to Zagreb University.
Methods: The search for faculty was not easy in these war and 
post-war times. So it was for Pathology chair. After several 
attempts (including Vaclav Neuman from Brno) Sergei Saltykow, 
also a prominent pathologist with great experience was elected. It 
was in 1922 the Institute of Pathology became operational both in 
teaching and diagnostics.
Results: Its history was marked by struggle in order to finish the 
building, organize the teaching activity including a modern micros-
copy room for the students, spacious autopsy room and a top mac-
roscopy museum. The Institute soon became a turning point not 
only for teaching but also for histopathology diagnostics, covering 
large areas of the newly formed kingdom of Yugoslavia. Saltykow’s 
expertise together with great enthusiasm resulted also in a series 
of Pathology textbooks which remained the golden standard for 
decades to come. His followers expanded and modernized the insti-
tute launching new laboratories (EM, histochemistry, immunohis-
tochemistry, molecular pathology) and new teaching techniques. 
The tradition of textbooks also remained.
Conclusion: In a moment where the vision of introducing new 
quality in diagnostic, teaching and research work appeared to 
become reality, the earthquake of March 22. 2020, seriously dis-
rupted our plans. The teaching part of the institution can’t be used 
at all and we resumed our work under broken walls, which mean-
while have been provisionally repaired. But we hope that the recon-
struction will bring us the opportunity to realize our dreams, and 
maybe make them even better.

Influence of the French geodesic mission in the first micro-
scopic findings in Ecuador
S. Egüez, S. Hincapié*, M.E. Cruz, A. Orellana, G. Zuñiga
*Instituto Oncológico Nacional Dr. Juan Tanca Marengo, Ecuador
Background & objectives: The arrival of scientists from the French 
Geodesic Mission in Ecuador meant a time of academic boom that 
represented the first microbiological vision. European scientists gave 
us their most modern microscope built by John Cuff.
Methods: We performed a review of textbooks and database Scielo 
addressing the origins of pathology in Ecuador, starting with the first 
microscope.
Results: In Quito (1736), the French scientists delegates were 
welcomed by the Jesuits. After building a good relationship with 
Ecuadorian scientists, they gave them their modern microscope. 
Juan Bautista Aguirre, Ecuadorian priest and scientist, described 
the first findings in the "Tratado de Física"(1759), in which he 
described that diseases and plagues are caused by malignant worms 
and transmission. Years later, Marco Von Plenciz; a Slovenian 
doctor, published "Opera medico-physica"(1762), stating that 
microorganisms are the cause of diseases. Due to the European 
intellectual construction and the Jesuits at the University of San 
Gregorio, first Ecuadorian physician, Eugenio Espejo began his 
multiple microbiological thoughts in Ecuador (1785).
Conclusion: The geodesic mission that granted the first 
microscope in Ecuador, contributed to the knowledge of epidemics 
that caused high morbidity and mortality. This new development 
led to academic reconstruction in Ecuadorian society.

Background & objectives: N.I. Pirogov is undoubtedly recognized as 
a world leader in the study of the surgical anatomy of blood vessels and 
vascular pathology. He described a huge number of vascular patholo-
gies, having a very serious impact on medicine.
Methods: We analysed literary sources from the very N. Pirogov 
times to the present and to understand Pirogov’s contribution to 
the development of angiology and vascular pathology as sciences.
Results: In the dissertation “Is the ligation of the abdominal aorta in 
an aneurysm of the inguinal region an easy and safe intervention”, 
defended in 1832 in the city of Dorpat, N. Pirogov raised the question 
of to what extent and due to which arteries collateral circulation devel-
ops after ligation of the abdominal aorta. In addition, it is worth noting 
that, N. Pirogov had a huge number of other works in the context of 
angiology, filling in the gaps in the study of vascular pathology initiated 
by Hunter, Stromeyer, Larrey and even Lambert.
Conclusion: Thanks to the ideas of N.I. Pirogov about the pos-
sibility of collateral circulation, today it is possible to operate 
on the abdominal aorta and large arteries, clamping them for a 
certain time without the danger of immediate thrombosis and the 
development of acute ischemia. N. Pirogov is rightfully consid-
ered one of the greatest anatomists who very seriously influenced 
the development of normal and pathological anatomy.

Features of the cell composition of the inflammatory infil-
trate in different phases of diffuse alveolar lung damage with 
COVID-19
V. Rodionov*, A. Avdalyan, O. Zairat’yants, D. Konovalov, D. 
Protsenko
*MMCC "Kommunarka", Russia
Background & objectives: Mortality from ARDS with COVID-19 is 
26.0 - 61.5%, and due to other causes - 35.3-37.2%. To find of the cor-
relation between CD15-positive cells, CD3-positive cells and CD68-
positive cells in the inflammatory infiltrate in lung with COVID-19.
Methods: The lung tissue of 25 patients who died from ARDS 
with COVID-19 without a secondary bacterial or mycotic infec-
tion, another thanatologically significant pathology of the lungs, 
was studied during autopsies. To study the cellular composition of 
the inflammatory infiltrate and the dynamics of its changes was 
used a double immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of 
antibodies to CD15, CD3, CD68.
Results: The inflammatory infiltrate in the exudative phase of 
DAD was represented by 56.8% of PMNs (CD15-positive cells; 
hereinafter, ratio percentage of positive cells to the total number of 
inflammatory infiltrate cells), 6.9% - lymphocytes (CD3-positive 
cells) and 19.5% macrophages (CD68-positive cells). In the early 
stage of the proliferative phase: 14.1% PMNs (CD15-positive 
cells), 38.7% lymphocytes (CD3-positive cells) and 13.5% mac-
rophages (CD68-positive cells). In the late stage of the prolifera-
tive phase: 11.3% PMNs (CD15-positive cells), 14.5% lympho-
cytes (CD3-positive cells) and 39.3% macrophages (CD68-positive 
cells).
Conclusion: In the exudative phase CD15-positive cells predomi-
nate, which is probably the trigger for the development of DAD 
and determines the volume of lung signs and the severity of ARDS 
in COVID-19. In the early stage of the proliferative phase CD3-
positive cells predominate, which corresponds to the beginning 
of proliferation and repair processes. In the late stage of the pro-
liferative phase of DAD the predominance of CD68-positive cells 
was revealed, which correlates with the processes of organization 
in lung tissues.

*Moscow Multidisciplinary Clinical Center “Kommunarka” of 
Moscow Healthcare department, Russia
Background & objectives: We aim to compare expression profiles of 
control cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation proteins and nuclei sizes 
in atypical epithelium (AE) of lung tissue with diffuse alveolar damage 
(DAD) and lung lepidic adenocarcinoma (LA).
Methods: Twenty-four autopsy cases of patients who died from 
acute respiratory damage syndrome induced by COVID-19, approv-
ing by PCR, (group 1) and four cases of lung lepidic adenocarci-
noma (group 2). We made slides with the following antibodies: 
p53, Ki67, p16, p63 for each of the cases. Then the rate of stained 
cells of AE was calculated on each slide.
Results: We found statistically significant differences in p16 sub-
group and p63 subgroup. We found a negative correlation between 
Ki67-index and number of days from onset of symptoms in group 1. 
No significant differences were revealed in subgroup p53 and Ki67.
Conclusion: The present study has shown heterogeneity 
in differences of expression levels of control cell cycle, 
proliferation and differentiation proteins between groups, and 
correlation between Ki67-index and number of days from onset 
reflecting decreasing proliferative activity. It shows similarities 
and differences of the lung AE in neoplastic and regenerative 
condition.

E. Roșca, A.C. Venter
*Department of Anatomical Pathology, County Clinical Emer-
gency Hospital of Oradea, Romania
Background & objectives: Since the start of the COVID-19 pan-
demic, mucormycosis cases have been on the rise. The most common 
form of the disease, rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM), 
has high morbidity and mortality. We present 4 cases of ROCM diag-
nosed in our hospital.
Methods: The 4 patients presented to the hospital between September 
2020 and February 2022. After clinical assessment, MRI and CT imag-
ing studies were performed. Tissue samples were sent to the Pathology 
Department, where mucormycosis was confirmed via histopathology.
Results: All 4 patients were male. The mean age was 65.5 years. On 
admission, two patients were COVID-19 positive while the other 
two had long COVID. Three patients had type 2 diabetes. Two cases 
presented with ground glass opacities on lung CT. One case had a 
Glasgow Coma Scale of 5 on admission, and imaging demonstrated 
changes suggestive of encephalitis, as well as intraventricular 
haemorrhage. Histopathology in all four cases revealed wide, 
ribbon-like hyphae that branched at right angles. The patients were 
treated by repeated surgical debridement coupled with antifungal 
medication. One patient died of pulmonary embolism while another 
died due to septic shock.

Conclusion: COVID-19 associated mucormycosis is most likely under-
diagnosed. As our experience confirms, rapid initiation of both aggres-
sive surgical debridement and antifungal therapy is vital in providing 
patients with better outcomes. In order to facilitate early treatment, a 
timely diagnosis is of utmost importance. A high index of suspicion is 
required in the face of patients with a history of COVID-19 present-
ing with sinusitis, proptosis or other craniofacial signs and symptoms.

infection combined with diabetes mellitus
A. Voronina*, O. Reshetnikova, A. Ermakov, L. Rudiuk, S. 
Morozov
*Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, Russia
Background & objectives: Diabetes mellitus(DM) as an underlying 
disease in cases of COVID-19 is associated with severe cause of infec-
tion and increased mortality. The aim of present study was to investi-
gate organs’ damages induced by COVID-19 infection in patients with 
diabetes mellitus co-morbidity.
Methods: Post-mortem examinations were performed in 34 lethal 
cases of COVID-19 infection with DM co-morbidity. Patients’ 
medical records were evaluated. The group included 16 males and 
18 females, 49 - 90 y.o. Hospitalization’s duration was 1-39 days. 
Macroscopic examinations of the internal organs performed. Tissue 
samples were taken for histology. Microscopy of H&E stained 
slides done at x10, x20, x40.
Results: Autopsy has shown multi-organ damages in all 
cases. Diabetes – induced angiopathies were registered in 9, 
polyneuropathies - in 8, retinopathies - in 6 and nephropathies- in 
10 cases. Diffuse lungs alveolar damage revealed in all patients. 
Histologically were found microangiopathies, perivascular, 
intrabronchiolar and intraalveolar haemorrhages interspersed with 
areas of alveoli filled by oedematous fluid. Vessels with erythrocyte 
sludge, fibrin and thrombi were recognized. Desquamation of the 
alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium cells were often replaced 
by hyaline membranes. Interalveolar septi were thickened due 
to vessels congestion, oedema, inflammatory infiltrations and 
haemorrhages. Myocardium, liver, kidneys were characterized by 
hypoxic and metabolic damage of various sizes accompanied with 
local microangiopathies and petechial haemorrhages.
Conclusion: The study has shown that diabetes mellitus as a 
comorbidity was the important risk factors for COVID-19 patients. 
Multiple organ dysfunctions due to diffuse structural injuries 
in lungs and other organs caused by the severe COVID-19 and 
affected by underlying diabetes mellitus was a prerequisite for the 
lethal outcome of the disease. Further studies of the pulmonary, 
blood vessels and parenchymal organs dysfunction’ mechanisms 
may help designing effective clinical management of infected 
patients with diabetes comorbidity.

Morphological characteristics of kidneys damage induced by 
SARS-COV-2
O. Reshetnikova*, A. Ermakov, L. Rudiuk, S. Morozov
*Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, Russia
Background & objectives: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can not only 
cause respiratory system pathology but also result in multiple organs 
insufficiency. The aim of present study was to reveal structural peculi-
arities of kidneys damage in fatal cases of the COVID-19.
Methods: A full pathological post-mortem examinations were 
performed in 60 fatal cases of the SARS-COV-2. All clinical 
data were studied. Gross pathology of the lungs, kidneys, other 
internal organs and brain were examined. Tissue samples were 
taken for histology. Microscopy of H&E stained slides performed 
at x10, x20, x40. Kidneys pathology features were recorded and 
analysed.
Results: This study has shown the kidneys structural injuries pre-
sented with areas of dystrophy and necrosis in the epithelium of 
the convoluted tubules, various glomerulopathies in patients with 
COVID-19 infection. Morphological manifestations of mesangial 
glomerulonephritis occurred in many cases. Quite often in glo-
meruli fibrinoid necrosis of capillary loops was noted. Sclerotic 
changes in glomeruli, including focal and diffuse, were often 
detected in kidneys’ tissue. There were also found ischemic infarc-
tions as a result of SARS-COV-2 induced vascular thrombosis. 
Tubulo-interstitial pathology with stromal oedema and inflam-
matory infiltrates revealed in many cases. Features of pulmonary 
pathology, including atypical interstitial bilateral pneumonia, dif-
fuse alveolar damage and hyaline membranes formation supported 
the COVID-19 diagnosis.
Conclusion: SARS-COV-2 infection has become a global health 
crisis, responsible for the significant growth of patient’s morbidity 
and mortality worldwide. Post-mortem examination is an essential 
tool in understanding multi-organ pathology in this novel infection. 
The results have shown renal tropism along with severe respiratory 
distress syndrome. Kidneys tissues damages, inflammatory reac-
tions, blood circulation disturbances significantly contributed to 
organ’s insufficiency and fatal outcomes. Further investigations 
of kidneys affection as one of important SARS-COV-2’ targets are 
considered essential.

Lethal case of schizophrenia with generalized chlamydia 
infection
V. Zinserling*, N. Lugovskaya, N. Semenova
*V.A. Almazov Research Center, Russia
Background & objectives: Schizophrenia remains very important 
disease with unclear aetiology. Among other theories infectious has 
many arguments, but direct detection of chlamydia antigen in brain 
has been never reported.
Methods: Lethal case of woman N.E., 37 ys. Nearby routine path-
ological examination has been done PAS reaction and immuno-
histochemistry including sera against Chlamydia trachomatis and 
Toxoplasma gondii.
Results: Patient suffered from paranoid form of schizophrenia 
for several years. Deterioration was due to coronavirus 
infection, confirmed at the autopsy. Additionally, was detected 
pseudomembranous colitis. Special attention was paid to changes 
of macrophages, nervous and epithelial cells in lungs, brain, 
kidneys, liver, spleen with multiple small vesicles. In all organs 
were detected extra- and intracellular PAS-positive inclusions. 
IHC investigation has been done. Chlamydia antigen was clearly 
detected in all internal organs. Special attention was paid to the 
brain, where positive reaction was noted in the cytoplasm of 
nervous cells and in white matter as well. IHC with serum against 
toxoplasma gave no distinct positive reaction.
Conclusion: Thus, our case strongly supports the infectious con-
cept of schizophrenia although further studies including additional 
cases and methods are necessary.

Clinico-pathological analysis in lethal cases due different geno-
types of coronavirus
M. Vashukova, V. Zinserling*, A. Komissarov, D. Lioznov
*V.A. Almazov Research Center, Russia
Background & objectives: Among other aspects of new coronavirus 
infection important role of different genotypes causing disease with 
certain epidemiological and clinical peculiarities is known. There are 
no literary data related to morphological characteristics of lesions due 
to different virus genotypes
Methods: We made clinic-pathological analysis in 39 lethal cases 
in age 18-95 ys in which virus genotype was determined during 
life time by sequence of viral RNA: delta line PANGO B.1.6617.2, 
AY.12 -25 pts- 1 group , alpha line PANGO АТ.1 - 5 pts – 2 
group, rare forms lines PANGO B.1.1.317, B.1.1.396, B.1.1.291, 
B.1.1.121) 9 pts – 3 group.
Results: All patients suffered from pneumonia, majority (37- 
95,5%) had concomitant diseases/ Average time of hospitalization 
19± 1,6 ds, average staying in intensive care unit 7,7 ±During the 
analysis between 2 and 3 group was shown difference between 
age of the patients (2 versus 3 group), duration of staying in the 
intensive care unit (1 versus 3 and 2 versus 3 groups) and grade 
of lymphopenia (2 versus 3 group). No differences were detected 
in average length of hospitalization, level of IL-6, D-dimer, CRP, 
ferritin. Histopathological picture in all investigated was grossly 
the same.
Conclusion: Thus, no significant differences between the changes 
due to different serotypes of new coronavirus could be detected, 
probably it can be explained by the fact that the mutations doesn’t 
include parts of genome relevant to virulence factors, although 
further studies are obligate.

Strongyloides stercoralis - a rare sighting in a gastroduodenal 
biopsy
A. Ardelean*, A. Vigdorovits, O. Tica
*PhMPh Oradea, University of Oradea, County Emergency Hos-
pital Oradea, Romania
Background & objectives: A 53-year-old male, diagnosed with type 
2 diabetes and pemphigus foliaceus, under treatment with azathioprine 
and high doses of prednisone, is admitted for epigastric pain, nausea 
and vomiting. A histological examination was performed in order to 
diagnose the underlying cause.
Methods: An upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy was performed 
and tissue samples were taken from the ulcerative lesions of the 
antral stomach and duodenum. The biopsy samples were prepared 
for microscopy using paraffin processing techniques and the sec-
tions were coloured using a standard hematoxylin-eosin stain. The 
specimen was microscopically examined and the results obtained 
were correlated with available scientific literature.
Results: The upper GI endoscopy showed oesophagitis with Candida 
albicans, mucosal erosions in the lower oesophagus and multiple 
gastric ulcerations covered by fibrin. Upon microscopic examination, 
active ulceration of the gastric mucosa, areas of necrosis and multiple 
pluricellular parasites in various stages of evolution located in the gas-
tric pits were found. The parasites had the morphology of S. stercora-
lis and they elicited an inflammatory response primarily consisting of 
eosinophils and neutrophils. Additionally, scattered alongside the areas 
of necrotized mucosa, multiple cocci and filamentous structures with 
features compatible with Candida were identified.
Conclusion: The definitive diagnosis was duodenal infection 
with Strongyloides stercoralis, which had extended to the antral 
stomach, and bacterial superinfection. In this specific case, the 
finding was unexpected and incidental. This finding underlines 
the risk of S. stercoralis infection in immunocompromised patients 
and its presence should be considered in the case of patients from 
this category presenting with GI symptoms. Furthermore, this case 
report highlights the role of histopathological examinations in the 
identification and diagnosis of GI parasites.

Cellular phenomenon of lymphoid cells with Roussel bodies 
and "flaming" cells in spleen tissue of patients who died of 
COVID-19
M. Bobrovskikh, A. Bobrovskikh, A. Filin*
*Voronezh State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: Combination of COVID-19 infection 
and mixed flora in lung tissue and formation of lymphoid cells with 
Roussel bodies in tissues of the spleen is an incompletely studied 
phenomenon.
Methods: Autopsy material from 34 spleens of individuals who 
died of confirmed COVID-19 in 2020 was examined. Material was 
obtained from 20 men and 14 women who died between the ages 
of 30 and 91 years. The duration of illness ranged from 3 to 23 
days. The material was stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Part of the 
material was stained by PAS reaction.
Results: Few cells with Roussel bodies were found in red pulp of 
spleen. Foci of coccus flora in alveolar cavity was combined with 
depletion of red pulp of the spleen and its focal necrosis in isolated 
cases. Single large lymphoid cells of "flaming" type, single lym-
phoid cells with Roussel bodies, single mitoses in cells with Mott 
cell morphology were recorded in the spleen tissue. Sometimes a 
rare features of topography was observed for cells with Roussel 
bodies in the spleen tissue in the form of their central location sur-
rounded by lymphoplasmacytic cells in the form of immune rosette.
Conclusion: Lymphoid cells with Roussel bodies in the spleen of 
patients who died from COVID-19, in combination with mixed 
flora in the lungs, can be considered as a morphological criterion 
reflecting progressive immune system depression with unfavour-
able outcome of the disease.

Hydatid cyst of the spleen: retrospective study and review of 
the literature
S. Makni*, Y. Loukil, M. Manai, I. Saguem, C. Kammoun, R. Kal-
lel, T. Boudawara, M. Mellouli
*Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Hydatid disease is a parasitic infection 
caused by Echinococcus Granulosis. It is a common health problem in 
many countries. This infection predominantly affects the liver followed 
by lungs. Splenic localization is rare and may pose a diagnostic 
challenge for clinicians.
Methods: We diagnosed 7 cases of splenic hydatid cyst between 
2013 and 2022, in the department of pathology at Habib Bourguiba 
University Hospital of Sfax.
Results: Mean age of patients was 37 years-old (extreme: 23-69 
years). Six of them were females (sex-ratio:0,16). cysts size varied 
from 3 to 12 cm, several daughter cysts were found in two cysts. 
Concomitant splenic, liver and peritoneal cysts were diagnosed in 
one case and a history of lung cyst was noted in another. Diagnosis 
was revealed by ultrasound supported by positive serologic tests 
otherwise CT scan was in favour of epidermoid cyst in one case. 
Total splenectomy was performed to all patients. Histopathological

examination showed the acellular laminated PAS positive mem-
brane with presence in two cases of granulomatous reaction of the 
adjacent splenic parenchyma.
Conclusion: Hydatid cyst of the spleen is uncommon but it should 
be included in differential diagnosis of other splenic cystic lesions 
such as epidermoid cysts, pseudocysts, splenic abscesses, hema-
tomas and cystic neoplasms of the spleen especially in endemic 
areas. The standard treatment is total or partial splenectomy com-
bined with the perioperative administration of albendazol.

Peritoneal tuberculosis: a challenging diagnosis
O. Mnif*, R. Ayadi, E. Braham, M. Mlika, A. Rais, O. Ismail, A. 
Ayadi, F. El Mezni
*Abderrahmen Mami Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Peritoneal tuberculosis is a rare entity 
representing about 2% of all extrapulmonary forms. Those Patients 
frequently have findings identical to those with underlying malignancy 
due to non-specific symptoms and imaging. The aim is to present cli-
nocopathological characteristics of this entity.
Methods: We report a retrospective study of 25 cases of peritoneal 
tuberculosis diagnosed at our department of pathology between 
2005 and 2021.
Results: There were 8 male and 17 female patients, aged between 
14 and 47 years with a mean of 41. Physical examination was 
positive for ascites. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen showed 
large ascites (n=5), peritoneal nodules (n=2) and mesenteric 
adenopathy (n=2). The diagnosis was made on peritoneal biopsy 
in all cases.
In microscopic examination, granulomatous reaction was composed 
of epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells with variable 
number of lymphocytes. These granulomatous lesions were centred 
by caseous necrosis in 19 cases overs 25 (76%), the rest were non 
caseating (24%).
Conclusion: Diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis is challenging 
due to its nonspecific clinical presentation, the limitation of labora-
tory testing, and the similarities of radiographic and laparoscopic 
evaluation to other diseases. Microscopic findings are variable and 
sometimes uncertain, especially with non caseating necrosis. The 
histopathological examination must be completed with bacterio-
logical studies, mainly when the clinic presentation suggests the 
diagnosis.

*Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health 
Sciences, University of Thessaly, Greece
Background & objectives: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 
(HLH) constitutes a life-threatening inflammatory syndrome. There are 
a limited number of sHLH cases in which trephine has been performed 
in living post-COVID-19 patients. We present an sHLH case diagnosed 
by trephine biopsy in a living post-COVID-19 patient.
Methods: An 81-year-old man with a past medical history of 
hypertension, diabetes, and ischemic stroke, was referred to 
the hospital to evaluate leukocytosis, pyuria, and elevation 
of inflammatory markers four weeks after recovering from 
COVID-19. Computed tomography of the abdomen and bone 
marrow (BM) biopsy were performed. The patient received 
meropenem, two-packed red blood cell units, and was discharged 
on cefixime.
Results: Computed tomography of the abdomen did not reveal 
focal signs of infection or hepatosplenomegaly. Leukocytes and 
C-reactive protein were gradually decreased. BM smear revealed 
severe anaemia, lymphopenia, and dysplastic morphologic 
findings of erythroblasts, neutrophils, and megakaryocytes. 
Trephine biopsy revealed hypercellular dyserythropoietic 
marrow, plasmacytosis, lymphocytosis, histiocytosis, 
hemophagocytosis, and the absence of granulomas or carcinoma. 
Immunohistochemistry documented a mixed population of 
T lymphocytes (CD3+) and B lymphocytes (CD20+). Strong 
positivity for CD68 confirmed histiocytosis. CD138 κ, λ staining 
proved polyclonal plasmacytosis. Perl’s staining showed excess 
hemosiderin deposits.
Conclusion: Based on our findings, we document sHLH in tre-
phine BM biopsy of a living post-COVID-19 patient and persistent 
leukocytosis, underscoring the diagnostic value of trephine biopsy 
in preventing life-threatening conditions such as COVID-19.

COVID-19 and small bowel ischemia: immunohistochemical 
positivity for SARS-CoV-2 in endothelial and inflammatory 
intestinal cells. A review of two cases

M.d.M. Del-Barrio-Molina, G. Coronado-Vilca, E. Prados-Perez, 
M.A. Martinez-Ortega
*Hospital Mateu Orfila, Spain
Background & objectives: COVID-19 is a major pandemic facing 
the world today caused by SARS-CoV-2, which can cause multisys-
tem damage. Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets lung epithelium 
cells, there is growing evidence that the intestinal epithelium is also 
affected.
Methods: First-case. 39-year-old male, admitted for bilateral 
pneumonia due to COVID-19. On the 13th day-of-hospitalization 
(DH), he presented paralytic ileus. Abdominal tomography revealed 
acute jejuno-ileal ischemia. Second-case.65-year-old woman 
with cough and positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2. One week later 
she developed abdominal pain and fever; the scan reported small 
loop intestinal obstruction caused by inguinal hernia. Emergency-
surgery was performed in both cases.
Results: In the first case a piece of small intestine 164 cm long was 
resected; in the second case a segment of small intestine and her-
nial sac were resected. Both cases had external fibrin plaques and 
histologically acute intestinal ischemia was observed, with trans-
mural necrosis, vasculitis and serositis with perforation; immuno-
histochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 (GeneTex) was performed, which 
was positive in endothelial and inflammatory cells. Both cases 
presented septic shock secondary to fecaloid peritonitis. The first 
case developed intestinal failure secondary to short bowel syn-
drome, multiorgan failure and finally died 58 days after surgery; 
the second case presented gradual improvement, was discharged at 
43 DH and is currently alive.
Conclusion: Although the acute intestinal ischemia of the sec-
ond-case was secondary to an inguinal hernia, the presence of 
SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry; which 
is compatible with recent studies (Norsa et al, Megan et al) that 
describe the replication of this virus in the intestinal mucosa; this 
may worsen the prognosis and lead in some cases to acute intestinal 
ischemia and worsening of the clinical status (as in the first-case);

Primary lymph node actinomycosis, a case report
S. Mabrouk*, T. Tlili, Z. Lajmi, Y. Fejji, A. Ben Abdelkader, B. 
Sriha, M. Mokni
*Department of pathology, Farhat Hached university hospital, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Actinomycosis is a rare chronic bacterial infec-
tion caused by Actinomyces species. It typically affects soft tissue of the 
cervicofacial region, pelvis and lungs. Primary involvement of lymph nodes 
is extremely uncommon. Only three cases have been reported so far.
Methods: A 41-year-old man with unremarkable medical history presented 
with a 6-week history of painless cervical lump. Physical examination 
showed a mobile, non tender, left submandibular lymph node measuring 
1.5 cm. The patient denied any history of recent dental extraction or oral 
manipulations. Neck ultrasound showed no other enlarged lymph nodes. 
An excisional lymph node biopsy was performed.
Results: Grossly, the lymph node measured 1.3 cm in long axis. 
The cut surface was white yellow and showed no nodularity or 
necrosis. Histological examination revealed fibrous thickening of 
the capsule. Thick fibrous bands were also seen between the lym-
phoid follicles, as well as rare small characteristic sulphur granules 
that were positive with Periodic acid Schiff and Grocott stains. 
Final cultures were positive for Actinomyces. The patient received 
long-term penicillin G therapy.
Conclusion: Actinomyces is a commensal of oral cavity. After 
disruption of the oral mucosa, it typically spreads by direct 
destruction of tissue. Lymphatic spread leading to primary 
involvement of lymph nodes is extremely uncommon. Awareness 
of this rare misleading presentation is crucial to avoid erroneous 
diagnosis. Actinomycosis should be considered in case of persistent 
lymph node enlargement in patients with poor dental hygiene. 
Sulfur granules are highly suggestive but not pathognomonic 
of actinomycosis. Microbiologic examination is necessary for a 
definitive diagnosis.

The diagnosis of non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections 
on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues: a retrospective 
analysis
M. Khaba*, L. Ndam, N. Makhado
*Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University, South Africa
Background & objectives: The prevalence of nontuberculous myco-
bacteria infection is increasing around the world with a negative impact 
on the health system. The histopathological features of mycobacterial 
tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria infection are indistin-
guishable on tissue biopsy, hence the aim for this study.
Methods: This was a retrospective study which consisted of all 
tissue biopsy from patients suspicious for mycobacterial infection 
which were diagnosed with granulomatous inflammation from 
2018 - 2020. These cases were tested using GenoType Mycobac-
terium CM/AS assay (Hain Life Sciences; Germany, Nehren) to 
identify mycobacterial species.
Results: A total of 25 cases comprised the study cohort and con-
sisted of 18 females and 7 males with mean age of 37.78 years. 
HIV seropositive was noted in 32% (8/25) of the cases. Biopsy 
sites were as follows: lymph nodes 52% (13/25), pleura 20% 
(5/25), breast 12% (3/25), testis and stomach 8% each (2/25). 
Microscopically, all the cases showed necrotizing granulomatous 
inflammation. Ziehl Neelsen staining was positive in 8% (2/25) of 
the cases. The identified mycobacterial species were as follows: 
M. fortuitum (76%), M. avium (4%), M. interjectum (4%), Myco-
bacterium. spp (16%).
Conclusion: Genotyping of mycobacterial species is very impor-
tant as the morphological features and Ziehl Neelsen staining were 
unhelpful to distinguish between mycobacterial tuberculosis and 
non-tuberculosis mycobacterial infection in this study. Definite 
diagnosis of mycobacterial infection on paraffin embedded tissue 
sections has important treatment implication for the patient.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for SARS-CoV2 - identification 
of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to nucleoprotein, S1- and 
S2-spike protein subunits and analysis of differential expres-
sion of viral proteins in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 
specimens
A. Jungbluth*, W. Travis, D. Frosina, J. Bagha, E. Hernandez, J. 
Sauter, M. Szabolcs
*Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, USA
Background & objectives: Proper detection of the viral proteins 
to SARS-CoV2 is mandatory for the morphological assessment of 
Covid19-induced pathologic changes. We identified commercially 
available mAbs to NP, S1, and S2 SARS-CoV2 respectively. A com-
parative expression analysis was performed in virally infected tissue.
Methods: A tissue-independent testing method for screening mAbs 
was employed using HEK293 cells transfected with the various 
viral proteins). FFPE pellets of HEK293 cells transfected with NP, 
S1 and S2 proteins were generated and used for mAbs testing/selec-
tion. MAbs were then tested on SARS-CoV2+ve specimens, and 
in-situ expression of NP, S1, S2 proteins was compared.
Results: Several commercial anti-SARS-CoV2 mAbs were con-
secutively tested. Most antibodies did not work in IHC and/or gen-
erated unspecific reactivity with various viral proteins. Only 3/10 
mAbs proved useful for IHC in FFPE material. The reagents were: 
mAb 001 (anti-NP; SinoBiological) mAb 1A9 (anti-S2; GeneTex), 
and mAb 1035206 (Anti-S1; Novus). All mAbs gave also strong 
and consistent staining in FFPE tissue. Comparative immunostain-
ing in lung autopsy cases showed that NP was most abundant while 
S1/S2 proteins were less prevalent. Difference was less striking in 
biopsies. More congruent expression of viral proteins was seen in 
placenta. Overall the NP was most widely present, while S1 and 
S2 showed a much more restricted expression
Conclusion: HEK-293 cells transfected with viral proteins are 
an excellent way to test anti SARS-CoV2 mAbs for specificity 
and suitability. Most commercial mAbs show unspecific staining 
and are unsuitable for IHC. Moreover, there are different expres-
sion patterns for NP, versus S1 and S2 proteins in infected human 
specimens. Consequently, presence of SARS-CoV2 proteins may 
depend on which viral protein was analysed. Therefore, morpho-
logical studies of Covid19-related changes are impacted by which 
viral protein was analysed and may have limited comparability.

*University of Fortaleza, Brazil
Background & objectives: Maternal infections by some microor-
ganisms include several unfavourable outcomes. Therefore, the study 
aimed to analyse anatomopathological alterations in ovular remains of 
spontaneous abortions of pregnant women with positive IgM serology 
for dengue, chikungunya, zika or positive treponemal test for syphilis.
Methods: From June 2020/January 2021, 259 cases of pregnant 
women in spontaneous abortion were admitted, in which blood 
samples were collected for IgM ELISA serology for zika, dengue, 
chikungunya and rapid test for syphilis. Ovular remains were stored 
and fixed in 10% buffered formalin and sent for anatomopathologi-
cal evaluation.
Results: Among the cases admitted, regarding IgM, were 
reagent 17 (7.8%) in dengue, 32 (14.1%) in chikungunya and 
9 (3.8%) in zika. In the rapid test for syphilis, 15 (5.9%) tested 
positive. In Dengue, fibrinoid deposits (p=0.000), syncytial 
nodes (p=0.001) and calcifications (p=0.034) showed statistical 
significance with the outcome. In Chikungunya, fibrin thrombus 
showed borderline statistical significance (p=0.053). In Zika, the 
prevalent change was poor vascularity, however no findings showed 
statistical significance. In syphilis, calcifications (p=0.020) and 
haemorrhagic spots (p=0.057) showed statistical significance, the 
latter being borderline. In all ovular remnants, it was found a rich 
inflammatory environment.
Conclusion: The results found in this investigation suggest a direct effect 
of the aforementioned viral and bacterial infections during the gestational 
period, particularly in the first 12 weeks of gestation, leading to unfortunate 
outcomes. Therefore, further studies on the subject are needed to understand 
the pathogenesis of the identified alterations and their repercussions, since, 
as observed in other studies, they may be related to early termination of 
pregnancy or to some complication related to the foetus.

Aviv, Israel
Background & objectives: Acquiring sufficient teaching material for 
rare diseases, such as Hirschsprung’s disease may be difficult, espe-
cially in smaller institutes, limiting training. The Objective of this study 
is to assess the effect of a short training session on algorithm-assisted 
HSCR diagnosis.
Methods: Five pathologists reviewed a dataset of 568 image sets 
(1704 images in total) selected from 50 cases by the DSA, and 
were tasked with scoring the images for the presence or absence 
of ganglion cells. The task was repeated a total of three times. 
Each pathologist had to complete a short educational presentation 
between the second and third iterations.
Results: The training resulted in a significantly increased rate of 
correct diagnoses (true positive/negative) and a decreased need 
for referrals for expert consultation. No statistically significant 
changes in the rate of false positives/negatives were detected.
Conclusion: A very short (<10min) training session can greatly 
improve the pathologist’s performance in the algorithm-assisted 
diagnosis of HSCR. The same approach may be feasible in training 
for the diagnosis of other rare diseases.

Artificial intelligence in dermatopathology: can an algorithm 
replace the pathologist?

G. Ingravallo, L. Resta
*University of Bari "Aldo Moro", Italy
Background & objectives: Artificial intelligence is a very current topic in 
this period. We tried to train an AI algorithm using basic histopathological 
criteria that indicate and differentiate with a good probability a malignant 
melanoma from a severe dysplastic nevus, starting from WSI.
Methods: The artificial intelligence image processing algorithm 
used to classify and to enhance anomalies contained in the micro-
scope image is the Fast Random Forest (FRF). The learning process 
of the algorithm is based on a preliminary classification of cluster 
of pixels of the same image. The FRF testing provides as output the 
processed image with coloured enhanced Melanoma pixel clusters.
Results: For five pixel clusters of the same dimensions, occurs a number 
of about 300 instances (computational cycles) to achieve the maximum 
precision (equals to 1), with a computational cost of about 2 minutes using 
a processor Intel® Core™ i5-7200U CPU, 2.71 GHz. The minimum recall 
performance parameter (near to 0) is achieved about 392 instances. The 
ROC curve (representing in the plane the true positive rate versus the false 
positive rate) is matching with the ideal curve of a perfect classifier. The 
performance indicators confirm the correct setting of the FRF hyperparam-
eters. The FRF images have been processed by following a specific image 
diagnostic protocol, oriented on reading and algorithm error minimization.
Conclusion: An important tool for melanoma diagnosis is the 
probability image estimated by the processed FRF output image. 
The probability image is useful to better discriminate information 
about ambiguous lesions. A single probability image is referred to 
a particular class of “defect”, and enhances, by the white colour, 
the defect distribution in the whole analysed image. By knowing 
the dimension of the acquired microscope image, it is also possible 
to estimate the defect distribution percentage.

Background & objectives: Pathology and Radiology are essential for 
medical education. Therefore, new study methods are in development, 
such as electronic flashcards, in order to make the process more 
dynamic. In this regard, Anki platform has been gaining popularity 
because it is accessible.
Methods: In this study Anki platform was used, a cross-platform 
software to develop an electronic pathology/radiology flashcard

database, that can be accessed by PC, iOS and Android. The application 
of this study was carried out in 102 medical students from University 
of Fortaleza, being applied to a questionnaire through Google Forms 
seeking to evaluate the effectiveness of the learning strategy developed.
Results: In a class of 102 students, 63 of them answered the form. 
More than 90% of the students considered that the flashcards were 
useful to the consolidation of the contents of Pathology and Radi-
ology, and more than 90% marked that the flashcards contributed 
to a better revision of the same contents. The flashcards would be 
stored by 83% of the students to review the same contents in the 
future, letting the algorithms determine the dates of the next revi-
sions. More than 90% of the students would use this tool to study 
other modules, and 50 of them would use it in tutoring, another 
methodology that requires a long-term revision.
Conclusion: From the recent study, it was possible to demonstrate 
that the methodology used was relevant and useful for developing 
clinical reasoning based on automated spaced repetition learning 
focused on pathology and radiology exercises, which were made 
available on several mobile platforms, making the experience even 
more dynamic and easy to access. Furthermore, the systematization 
employed is a facilitator for the long-term consolidation of student 
knowledge, which in practice was confirmed by the data analysis 
obtained during the study evaluation.

Application of image analysis based algorithm for quality con-
trol of immunohistochemical staining
O. Greenberg, D. Hershkovitz*, R. Hagege, I. Hayun
*Pathology Department, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel 
Aviv, Israel
Background & objectives: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a main 
tool in today’s pathology routine. Common applications include disease 
classification and biomarkers for targeted therapy. Positive controls 
are included on each IHC slide, misinterpretation of the staining in the 
control may lead to inaccurate diagnosis.
Methods: To develop an algorithm for quality control of IHC 
we trained the algorithm to identify 3 patterns of IHC staining 
(nuclear, cytoplasmic and membranous). Fifty slides from each 
category (membranous Her-2-neu, nuclear TTF1, and cytoplasmic 
Cytokeratin7) were scanned. From these images, we captured 1,645 
images, out of which 1,174 images were used for training phase and 
471 for validation phase.
Results: The algorithm was able to detect an average 87% of all 
the relevant stains. Specifically, the algorithm accurately identi-
fied 98%, 85% and 78% of membranous, nuclear and cytoplasmic 
staining, respectively. Misclassification of cytoplasmic staining 
was mainly due to clear cytoplasm. Misclassification of nuclear 
staining was due to poor segmentation of adjacent nuclei.
Conclusion: We develop an algorithm that shows high success 
in classifying staining patterns in scanned slides. Although the 
algorithm requires mild improvement, we estimate it could be a 
significant addition to the toolbox of digital pathology and be 
applied for quality control of IHC in the daily routine practice. 
Moreover with the correct usage of the algorithm, misinterpretation 
of the staining and inaccurate diagnosis could be easily prevented.

Homology-based approach for pathological diagnosis of pro-
static cancer
Y. Nomura*, K. Uchida, K. Nakane, M. Nishio, M. Ishizawa
*Ise Municipal General Hospital, Japan
Background & objectives: Prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) 
detection by image analysis from pathological specimens has been 
attempted. Although the systems based on the AI algorithm are 
very popular, we propose a newly established unique idea that is 
called “the homology profile method”.
Methods: The digital data from prostate needle biopsy speci-
mens at Ise Municipal General Hospital were binarized for each 
grayscale (0‐255) and calculated the homology index (the Betti 
number). The several profile, including its maximum value was 
featured. The staining condition was not in a consideration. The 
Betti number was calculated by an ordinally note type computer.
Results: The Betti number was calculated for 100 JPEG format 
images for each of normal, Gleason pattern 3, 4, and 5. From the 
results of the t-test, the Betti number of PCa was significantly 
higher than that of normal prostatic glands. (p<0.0001). There was 
also a significant difference in Betti number of each Gleason pat-
tern compared to normal (p<0.0001). The Betti number of Gleason 
pattern 5 was significantly higher than others.
Conclusion: The homology is a mathematical concept that meas-
ures “the contact degree” from the images. The homology profile 
method has not been applied to detect PCa using pathology images. 
This method is not only useful for detecting adenocarcinoma, but 
also for detecting Gleason pattern 5 PCa alone. Unlike AI algo-
rithm, our idea is expected to be applicable to medical practice 
because of its small data size and reduced computation.

Efficacy and efficiency of a mitosis detection tool in invasive 
breast cancer
C. Simmat*, L. Guichard, S. Sockeel, N. Pozin, M. Lacroix-Triki, 
C. Miquel, M. Sockeel, S. Prévot
*Primaa, France
Background & objectives: Mitosis counting is part of the Scarff-
Bloom-Richardson (SBR) scoring for invasive breast cancer (IC). We 
evaluate the benefit of using an AI-based mitosis detection algorithm 
in the pathologist’s workflow.
Methods: Our algorithm has two steps. A RetinaNet detector 
was first trained on a specially designed mitotic dataset of 4132 
patches from 162 Whole Slide Images (WSI) to detect mitosis. An 
EfficientNetB0 classifier refines these results by removing a part 
of false positives. Results are displayed in our interactive viewer, 
Cleo.
Results: 4 pathologists have used the solution on 50 WSI, with 
and without AI-results displayed. We evaluated the performance 
(F1-scores, Precisions and Recalls) and the time spent by 
pathologists on the WSI in both cases. The clinical study is ongoing 
and final results will be available in June. Actual algorithmic 
metrics are promising, but do not capture the value brought to 
pathologists as a proper interactive user interface enriched with 
the detector output will ease practitioners’ task and increase both 
recall and precision.
Conclusion: To meet pathologists’ needs we developed a mitotic 
detection algorithm trained with routine data along with an 
interface designed with and for practitioners. Our clinical study 
will assess whether this tool can help pathologists in their daily 
practice.

Background & objectives: Generalization is one of the main 
challenges of computational pathology. Slide preparation heterogeneity 
leads to poor models’ performance on unseen data. This issue is 
addressed here by comparing approaches based on different cycleGAN 
usages.
Methods: We build a stain translation device using unsupervised 
cycleGANs image-to-image translation. Three approaches were 
compared to a baseline model, their performance were assessed 
using invasive carcinoma patch classification. The first two 
approaches use the translation device at inference or training 
respectively, leading to stain specific models. The last method 
uses it for stain augmentation to produce a stain invariant model.
Results: Baseline metrics are set by training and testing a model 
on a reference stain with colour augmentation. The first approach 
showed improved performance on different stains by 20% AUC 
compared to the baseline without requiring task specific model 
re-training. Secondly, we demonstrate that using the stain trans-
lation device before model training allows for labelling knowl-
edge transfer between stains. This results in high performance 
without using any labels for a particular target stain. Finally, the 
translation device is used for stain augmentation during training, 
resulting in a stain invariant model with equally good perfor-
mance on every stain.
Conclusion: Every modality tested in this study improves the 
baseline without needing labelled data on target stains. We 
assessed the performances using three medical centres with H&E 
and H&E&S stainings. The study shows that cycleGAN based 
domain adaptation methods are solutions to the generalization 
challenge in computational histopathology.
Such a framework can be used in other applications such as auto-
matic segmentation or object detection.

Detection of microcalcifications in whole slide images: a 
comparison between image processing and deep learning 
approaches
M. Clavel*, N. Pozin, S. Sockeel, M. Sockeel, C. Miquel
*Primaa, France
Background & objectives: Microcalcifications are calcium 
deposits in breast ducts. If the mammographic abnormality reveals 
microcalcifications, the pathologist should make every effort to identify 
them. As a help, we present an automatic microcalcification detection 
pipeline in Whole Slide Images (WSI).
Methods: Epithelial regions are parsed from the WSI into 
patches that are fed to a classifier. A first proposed image 
processing-based classifier (Classifier1) detects blurry dark 
objects as this is the typical aspect of microcalcifications on 
WSI. The second one (Classifier2) is a convolutional network 
trained on 164835 patches from a total of 1615 WSI, including 
1633 microcalcifications patches.
Results: Classifiers are evaluated based on their balanced accu-
racy (BAcc), precision (Pr), recall (Re). However, Those metrics 
are insufficient to capture the value brought to the pathologist. 
Not every microcalcification must be found, the mere detection 
of their presence is enough to determine whether the biopsy 
was well located. To evaluate the pipeline performance, we 
propose additional metrics. Objects classified as microcalcifi-
cations are sorted by classifier’s confidence and we compute: 
the average rank of the first detected microcalcification (Aver-
age_Rank), the average number of slides for which a microcalci-
fication is detected among the top 16 objects (Microcal_in_top). 
Results are: BAcc: 0.79-0.88, Pr: 0.07-0.73, Re: 0.67-0.76, 
Average_Rank: 8.5-0.7, Microcal_in_top: 0.75-0.83 (format 
metric_name: metric_classifier1-metric_classifier2)
Conclusion: Our automatic microcalcification detection pipeline 
could be helpful to pathologists. Two different classifiers can be 
plugged into the pipeline. The first one is based on image pro-
cessing techniques and needs a small amount of labelled data to 
be set up. Although its performance is good, it is outperformed 
by the deep learning based classifier. Both solutions can be used 
depending on the availability of labelled data.

Understanding batch variation within a cohort before digi-
tal pathology analysis of multiplex immunofluorescence in 
colorectal cancer

V. Bingham, J. James, M. Salto-Téllez, S. Craig
*Patrick G Johnston Centre for Cancer Research, Queen’s Uni-
versity Belfast, UK, Spain
Background & objectives: To apply two optimised multiplex-immu-
nofluorescence (mIF) protocols (Panel 1-DAPI, Cytokeratin, CD4, 
CD8, CD3, CD20; Panel 2-DAPI, Cytokeratin, CD4, CD68, FOXP3) 
to a cohort of colorectal-cancer (CRC) in order to determine effect of 
batch variation within the cohort using digital pathology.
Methods: mIF protocols were applied to 518 FFPE-CRC sections 
using an Leica Bond RX autostainer. Each batch of slides was ran 
with a tonsil control and fluorescent scanning was performed using 
a Vectra Polaris.
Using QuPath, we performed annotations, cell-segmentation, epi-
thelium-stromal classification and cell classification. Cell features 
and summary statistics for each mIF channel were exported for 
quantitative analysis using RStudio.
Results: Mean greys per simulated cell for each biomarker of inter-
est were reviewed in order to determine batch variability. Values for 
Cytokeratin, DAPI, CD4, CD8 and FOXP3 demonstrated limited 
variability across the cohort for both panels. In contrast, values for 
CD20, CD3 in panel 1 and CD68 in panel 2 were found to be batch 
dependent, affecting 7/15 and 5/15 of panel-specific staining runs. 
On review, the same florescent dye (Opal570) was used to visual-
ise CD20 and CD68 across both panel designs and therefore most 
likely to influence batch-dependent, dye-specific background stain-
ing. Whilst tumour-stroma classification was adequate in affected 
batches, biomarker-dependent cell classification was positively 
skewed compared to adjacent tonsil controls.
Conclusion: This study found that batch artefacts did not sig-
nificantly impair tissue-specific, mIF epithelium-stromal classi-
fication, due to use of an artificial neural network. In contrast, 
biomarker-specific cell classification using pre-defined intensity 
thresholds was found to be vulnerable to positive skew in tissue 
sections from batches where high Opal570 background staining 
was present. Whilst use of pre-defined thresholds was acceptable 
for most optimised antibody-opal pairs in both panels, this work 
indicates the importance of reviewing dye-specific bias prior to 
mIF image analysis.

Background & objectives: Deregulated germinal centre (GC) reactiv-
ity is a main determinant for the SLE pathogenesis. Emerging evidence 
suggest that TFH cells may play an important role in this process. We 
sought to compare GC immune cell subsets between SLE and control 
GCs.
Methods: Multiplex imaging was applied for the in situ quantita-
tive analysis of GC cell populations in control, selected to express 
active GCs, (n=4) and SLE (n=4) lymph nodes (LNs). The lat-
est Vectra Polaris system and inForm/PhenoptReports software 
(Akoya) were used. Luminex analysis was performed in matched 
serum samples from the SLE individuals.
Results: No difference was found for GC B and CD8 cell subsets 
analysed. A strong correlation between CD4hiPD1hi TFH and GC 
B cells was found only in control LNs. Significantly higher num-
bers of less differentiated (CD4hiPD1hiCD57lo) TFH cells were 
found in SLE compared to control LNs, a profile associated with 
significantly higher numbers of CD4hiPD1hiCD57lowGATA3low 
and lower numbers of CD4hiPD1hiCD57loBcl6hiKi67loGATA3hi 
TFH cells. A clear trend for larger FDC network area and CXCX-
L13hi cells within GCs was observed in SLE. Significantly higher 
extra-follicular IFNa expression, a supporter of initial TFH dif-
ferentiation, was found in SLE. Among circulating biofactors ana-
lysed, a significant correlation between CXCL13 and CXCL13hi 
GC cells was found in SLE.
Conclusion: We provide evidence for an altered differentia-
tion of TFH cells in SLE, characterized by reduced expression 
of highly differentiated (CD57hi), potential providers of IL4 
(GATA3hi) TFH cells as well as a dissociation between TFH and 
GC B cells. Whether this reflects an aberrant, not affinity-based 
development of TFH needs further investigation.

Digital Pathology reporting of breast core biopsies in 
Malaysia
T. Pasupati Meenakshi*
*Gribbles Pathology M Sdn Bhd, Malaysia
Background & objectives: Digital pathology has become an integrated 
component of primary reporting in Gribbles Pathology for the past two 
years. During the perpetual COVID 19 pandemic in 2021, most of the core 
biopsies of breast were reported digitally, away from the office.
Methods: A highly advanced Aperio AT2 slide scanner (Leica Bio-
systems), approved by FDA for primary reporting, is in usage for 
routine digital pathology reporting in Gribbles Pathology. A total 
number of 283 breast core biopsy cases were reported, digitally. 
Reporting was done as per latest international guidelines along with 
IHC reporting of hormonal status as per CAP protocol.
Results: Digital pathology reporting of breast core biopsies is 
as accurate as conventional microscope reporting, and in many 
instances, more advantageous and precise. With an integrated 
Dragon Speech software, all cases were reported with ease, 
without resorting to the conventional microscope for a review. 
The response and acceptance from the surgeons are rewarding. 
Measurements of small malignant foci, and interpretation of 
grade, coupled with digital photography has made the routine 
reporting more acceptable. Constant and continuous practice 
has made the digital reporting more dependable, and accurate 
than conventional microscope reporting. IHC analysis with 
comparison of different hormonal receptors in a single view is a 
futuristic outcome of digital reporting.
Conclusion: Digital pathology reporting of core biopsies of breast 
is simple, dependable, accurate and should be incorporated as a rou-
tine primary reporting procedure, where digital pathology is avail-
able. IHC reporting is much easier and precise. The accuracy and 
effectiveness are very advantageous for the current demand of oncol-
ogy management in many hospitals with tertiary care. This is the 
initial step taken by Gribbles Pathology for future diagnostic digital 
pathology and artificial intelligence (AI) in Malaysia.

Classification of histological features based on IHC staining 
heterogeneity within tumours
H. Smits*, L. Ruiter, G. Breimer, S. Willems, M. Philippens
*UMC Utrecht, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Haralick texture features are used to quan-
tify image heterogeneity. In this study, the heterogeneity of proliferation 
(Ki67 staining) and immune cells (CD45 staining) within tumours was 
used to classify histological characteristics of laryngectomy specimens.
Methods: 85 whole mount tumour slides of 22 laryngeal or 
hypopharyngeal carcinomas were immunohistochemically stained 
for Ki67 and CD45 and scored on histological characteristics. The 
tumour area was annotated in QuPath. Haralick features independ-
ent of DAB-intensity were extracted from the isolated DAB-signal 
and used as input for a principal component analysis (PCA). A 
support vector machine was fitted for classification.
Results: The PCA included 16 Haralick features (8 from Ki67 and 
8 from CD45 staining). The first four principal components (97.2% 
explained variance) were used to fit a linear classifier. Based on 
Ki67 and CD45 heterogeneity, only laryngeal vs. hypopharyngeal 
tumours and cohesive vs. non-cohesive growth showed promising 
results for classification. The linear classifier resulted in a 
classification accuracy of 85.9% for laryngeal vs. hypopharyngeal 
tumours and 76.5% for cohesive vs. non-cohesive growth. A leave-
one-patient-out cross validation resulted in an error rate of 0.25 and 
0.34 for both classifiers respectively.
Conclusion: This study shows the feasibility of tumour classifica-
tion by histological characteristics based on the heterogeneity of 
DAB-stained biomarkers within the tumour. It is a matter of finding 
the right (combination of) biomarkers for classification by different 
characteristics and classification of different tumour types. The 
classifiers created in this study are a proof of concept, since more 
data is needed to create robust classifiers, but the method shows 
great potential for automated tumour classification.

A thyroid cytology case report using Google Lens for the 
diagnosis
F. Pereira*, C. Padrão, J. Tinoco, A.M. Gonçalves Pereira, A. Alves
*Hospital Prof. Doutor Fernando Fonseca, Portugal
Background & objectives: Pathologists use manual methods to exam-
ine samples through a microscope, but new imaging technologies have 
been designed to assist in the pathology diagnosis. An example is the 
use of digital cameras from smartphones in combination with artificial 
intelligence applications.
Methods: We present a case report of a 40-year-old woman, with 
a personal history of asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, who under-
went ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) 
due to increase of the right thyroid lobe. The patient had no asso-
ciated symptoms and no analytical changes. Ultrasound revealed 
slight enlargement of the right thyroid lobe, with two nodules 
measuring 12x9x6mm and 14x13x11mm.
Results: A FNAC was performed, without complications. Cytol-
ogy revealed a sparsely cellular sediment, with rare follicular cells

without nuclear atypia, lymphocytes and neutrophils, with thin and 
thick colloid. Numerous filiform structures were identified, with 
branching at acute angles raising the possibility of a fungal infec-
tion, and rare hair follicles. The diagnosis was benign (colloid nod-
ule) through The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopa-
thology. After an exhaustive search by the reference books, it was 
not possible to determine the species name of these structures. The 
Google Lens application was used and allowed to select structures 
with similar morphology, confirming contamination by Verbascum 
sp. plant (which is indigenous in the patients residential area).
Conclusion: The second cytology did not show the presence of these 
structures leading to the conclusion that it was a contamination. At the 
moment, no empirical evidence for using Google Lens in a medical 
setting is known to the authors. Nevertheless, Google Lens seems to 
be good for a quick evaluation, as smartphone cameras have become a 
widespread cost-effective method for pathology image acquisition and 
this software is freely available in our devices.

A robust, centerwise-adaptive hybrid machine learning 
approach for HER2 scoring
R. Fick, C. Bertrand, A. Moshayedi, V. Di Proietto, S. Ben Hadj*
*Tribun-Health, France
Background & objectives: To enable precise human Epidermal 
growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) quantification in digital pathology, 
we propose a hybrid deep- and machine learning approach, which 
exhaustively localizes invasive cancer in a slide and is adaptive to 
centerwise HER2 scoring criteria.
Methods: Our dataset contains 350 Whole Slides Images (WSI) 
comprising 3 scanners. To quantify HER2 expression, we first 
localize all invasive cancer in a WSI using a U-NET. Then, we use 
hand-crafted features based on DAB colour devolution to determine 
HER2 expression in cancer. The slide label is determined by 
comparing aggregated expression with that of the laboratory’s 
HER2 calibration slides.
Results: HER2 quantification is based on the staining 
completeness and intensity of all cancer cell membranes in the 
WSI, where the classes 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+ are distinctive in that 
specific percentages of cells are stained more intensely than 
the centre’s calibration slides. In practice these properties can 
only be eyeballed, leading to large inter-observer variability 
in HER2 slide classification. We compare eyeballing HER2 
scoring with our algorithm’s evaluation based on clinical 
guidelines, calibrated on the centre’s calibration slides. Our 
results indicate high algorithm/eyeballing agreement for images 
with homogeneous HER2 expression within a slide, but less so 
for heterogeneous expressions.
Conclusion: The results indicate that our AI-based HER2 quanti-
fication can come to a different conclusion than expert eyeballing 
for hard cases. This may be the result of our exhaustive calculation 
of the total tumour surface, which is used as the denominator to 
determine the percentage of cells that exhibit HER2 expression. 
Visual inspection, in contrast, may underestimate HER2 non-
expressive invasive cancer areas. In such cases, our approach may 
improve clinical treatment decisions based on verifiable algorithm 
outcomes.

Blended learning in histology using a virtual microscope: from 
adaptation to adoption at the University of Geneva
P. Soulié, J. Perrin-Simonnot, L. Borgs*, R. Hoyoux, G. Vincke
*Cytomine, Belgium
Background & objectives: Priscilla Souilé and Jackie Perrin-Simon-
not, two collaborators at the Faculty of medicine of the University of 
Geneva, teach histology using a blended learning model alternating 
online virtual microscopy and on-site activities to enrich and complete 
the learnings outcomes.
Methods: The virtual microscopy practical work sessions are given 
using the open-source CYTOMINE software, integrated with the 
open-source MOODLE learning management system. The teaching 
assistants, supervised by the professors, are coaching the students 
using the virtual microscope and a chat space to exchange ques-
tions and answers. Fully online during the COVID pandemic, this 
pedagogical strategy now also includes face-to-face remediation.
Results: To maintain quality of histology teaching during the 
COVID pandemic period would have been impossible with a clas-
sic model based only on practical sessions in face-to-face using 
microscopes. Beyond having taken up this challenge, and made it 
possible, this blended model based on web-based virtual micros-
copy allowed teachers and students to collaborate with more auton-
omy, transparency, and traceability, to ultimately having developed 
more persistent knowledges and skills. Alternating with face-to-
face sessions after the pandemic allowed to keep the development 
of microscope related skills and develop more personalized reme-
diation. This complementarity meets the objectives of both teachers 
and students.
Conclusion: The histology practical work sessions during the pan-
demic were quickly adapted to full e-learning based sessions thanks to 
virtual microscopy. Students, supervisors, and professors founded this 
virtual environment easy and intuitive, allowing them to quickly switch 
to new ways of teaching and learning, essential in these troubled times. 
In addition, it trains students to use tools that foreshadow what will be 
those they will use in their future career, in an easy and intuitive way.

prostate cancer
A. Dovbysh, T. Savchenko, R. Moskalenko*, A. Romaniuk
*Sumy State University, Ukraine
Background & objectives: Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the leading 
causes of death in men from cancer. Artificial intelligence can reduce 
subjectivity and improve the effectiveness of diagnosing this disease 
using fewer resources than the standard diagnostic scheme.
Methods: We have created a mathematical algorithm based on his-
tological image recognition by machine learning and image recogni-
tion methods. The input data for training and testing the mathematical 
algorithm were the results of PC histology obtained by biopsy. The 
structured vector consisted of nine characteristics of PC cells and one 
variable that captures benign or malignant tumours.
Results: We have built a categorical functional model of informa-
tion-extreme machine learning in the form of an oriented graph 
of sets used in the operation of the diagnostic system in the exam 
mode. The introductory recognition class is proposed, in relation 
to which the system of control tolerances for diagnostic features is 
determined, to choose the category according to the most signifi-
cant variance of its input training matrix of brightness. With the 
increasing power of the alphabet of recognition classes, it is advis-
able to move from a linear structure of input data to a hierarchical 
one, which will be the subject of further research.
Conclusion: Comparative analysis of the results obtained by the 
authors allows us to consider the proposed method of information-
extreme machine learning as a promising alternative to neuron-like 
structures in the analysis of large amounts of data.

*Virasoft Corporation, Turkey
Background & objectives: Nottingham Histologic Grading (NHG) is 
a prognostic indicator in early invasive breast cancer. NHG contains 
three factors which are pleomorphism, tubular formation and mitosis 
count. Mitosis recognition plays an important role for NHG estimation 
and accurate assessment of cancer prognosis.
Methods: Two novel datasets, which include 139.124 nucleis and 
9.816 mitoses with annotations, are created and presented. Moreover, 
a hybrid deep learning framework is proposed for mitosis recognition. 
To achieve the results, a modified scaled-YOLOv4 algorithm is first 
used to detect all nuclei in WSIs. Then, a modified-VGG11 model is 
employed to recognize and localize mitoses in the WSIs.
Results: In comparison to various classification methods, the proposed 
framework provides the best results for both in-house and other 
datasets including MIDOG-21 and ATYPIA. In the first experiment, 
all algorithms are trained and tested on in-house dataset, the proposed 
framework obtains the best accuracy results than the other classification 
algorithms with F1-Score of 49. Moreover, the second experiment 
shows that the created novel dataset contains different characteristics 
and features than the MIDOG-21 and ATYPIA datasets.
Conclusion: In this work, we propose a hybrid deep learning 
approach and introduce two new datasets. The proposed framework 
is compared with different algorithms on various datasets. The 
results prove that the proposed approach performs better than 
the other algorithms in both nuclei detection and mitotic cell 
recognition in WSIs. Further clinical validation studies are needed 
for clinical implementation of AI based mitotic count.

Comparison of different nuclear segmentation algorithms on 
the digital image of HER2 FISH labelled breast cancer tissue 
sample
A. Csizmadia*, V. Jonas, R. Paulik, T. Krenacs, B. Molnar
*Diagnostics Department, 3DHISTECH Ltd., Hungary
Background & objectives: The FISH technique is a frequently used 
molecular method to visualize well known genetic aberrations. The 
method provides results of qualitative, quantitative measurements 
that can be used to identify the genetically affected cells and their 
proportion in the tumour population.
Methods: The HER2 protein expression status in breast cancer 
provides a useful working example of tumour heterogeneity. The 
FISH technique can visualize the HER2 genetic heterogeneity 
in the breast tissue samples in situ. The fluorescence samples’ 
peculiarity of the signal burning out, therefore the fluorescence 
digitalization and the demand an objective FISH evaluation 
results have become a basic requirement in diagnostics.
Results: The WSI imaging provides an opportunity to identify 
the different HER2 amplified nucleus. The base of the FISH 
image analysis is the nucleus segmentation. The classical 2D 
image analysis algorithms have a significant limitation regarding 
the detection of the overlapped nuclei. The intensity differences 
between the overlapped nuclei are not significant for define a 
proper cut line. The inadequate segmentation results incorrect 
signal assignment. The fluorescence Z layer scanning method 
opened a new opportunity for the digitalization and analysis of 
FISH samples. Slicing the sample section into different Z planes 
give an opportunity 3D image segmentation. AI based StarDist 
image segmentation algorithm was evaluated for achieve more 
precise nuclei segmentation.
Conclusion: During our comparison image segmentation test, we 
found that the breast tissue intratumor HER2 heterogenetic results 
change considerably using different image processing algorithms. 
The deep-learning based segmentation algorithm is found to be more 
robust in versatile image environment resulting in more accurate 
object segmentation and separation. The novel approach of nuclei 
segmentation in turn improves the signal assignment process changing 
the number of signals within each nucleus, thus improving the reli-
ability of the quotient values confirming the amplification.

Development and assessment of single-cell image classification 
systems for haematological cytomorphology using convolutional 
neural networks
C. Matek*
*Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Erlangen, Germany
Background & objectives: Morphologic classification of 
leukocytes represents an important step in the diagnostic workup of 
blood and bone marrow samples for many haematological diseases. 
Frequency and importance of cytomorphologic evaluation motivate 
development and evaluation of diagnostic support systems for 
leukocyte classification.
Methods: Publically available datasets of peripheral blood and 
bone marrow cytomorphology are described and used in order to 
train and evaluate sequential models and ResNeXt-based neural 
networks for leukocyte classification. Performance of the trained 
networks is evaluated using data from different sources, thus 
assessing generalizability of prediction performance. Finally, 
multiple strategies are presented for robustness assessment and 
explainability of algorithm predictions.
Results: Convolutional Neural Networks developed using publicly 
available datasets of leukocyte cytomorphology in blood and 
bone marrow cytomorphology attain the performance of trained 
cytologists for tasks such as blast recognition in the diagnosis of 
AML. The overall classification performance critically depends on 
the training sample number per class. The pattern of deviation from 
ground truth is similar for algorithms and humans, with consecutive 
morphologic cell types within a continuous hematopoietic lineage 
most susceptible to confusion. Explainability methods show that 
the models map relevant image areas. Analysis of neural network 
predictions illustrates the importance of augmentation strategies 
to ensure classifier robustness against staining and scanner setting 
variabilities and avoid overfitting.
Conclusion: Published expert-annotated datasets of leukocyte 
morphology allow training of state-of-the-art neural networks for 
single-leukocyte classification in the diagnostic workup of hae-
matological diseases. For many diagnostically relevant classes, 
these networks attain a performance level comparable to human 
examiners. Using explainability methods, image areas relevant for 
classification can be illustrated, suggesting significant overlap with 
structures known to be relevant for cytomorphologic classification. 
Appropriate augmentation strategies allow hardening classifiers 
against different preanalytical and digitization parameters, thus 
ensuring robustness and generalizability of network predictions.

A reinforcement learning approach for automated scoring of 
immunohistochemically stained mismatch repair genes
M. Raza*, R. Awan, R.M.S. Bashir, T. Qaiser, D. Snead, N. Rajpoot
*University of Warwick, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Assessment of the Mismatch Repair 
(MMR) status is critical for determining the treatment of colorectal 
cancer (CRC) patients. We propose a novel reinforcement learning 
(RL) approach that mimics histopathologists for automated scoring of 
immunohistochemically stained MLH1 and PMS2 slides.
Methods: The proposed framework consists of two components 
where initially, a soft attention module analyses WSIs at lower 
magnification (5×) and identifies potential regions of interest 
(ROIs) for tile extraction. The tiles are fed into the second com-
ponent, an RL-based retina-inspired hard-attention classification 
model which further extracts and processes a series of high-magni-
fication patches from each image tile for target prediction.
Results: The proposed method mimics a pathologist analysing only 
relevant parts of the IHC slides. We compare our approach against 
random-sampling with RL-classifier and sliding window based tile 
extraction. We aggregate results using average probabilities of the 
top 15 tiles from each WSI for final score.
The proposed model achieved superior performance for both 
biomarkers with F1-scores of 0.88, 0.82 and AUROC of 0.92, 
0.88 for MLH1 and PMS2, respectively. Competitive perfor-
mance was achieved by ResNet-18, achieving F1-scores of 0.72, 
0.71 and AUROC of 0.92, 0.93 for MLH1 and PMS2 while 
worst performance was achieved by random selection method 
for F1-score 0.66, 0.62 and AUROC 0.67, 0.64 for MLH1 and 
PMS2.
Conclusion: We demonstrate the effectiveness of our 
approach, which mimics a pathologist analysing a fraction 
of a given IHC slide, for scoring MMR markers in CRC. Our 
method demonstrates comparable performance to standard 
computational-pathology methods while only processing a tiny 
fraction of the WSI. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first RL approach to automatically score the MMR markers. We 
further intend to improve the model by determining the optimal 
number of image tiles required for each WSI.

Intratumoural heterogeneity with different resistant subclones 
in a treatment resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumour 
revealed through a novel tissue masking technology

Lim
*Department of Anatomical Pathology Singapore General Hospital, 
Singapore
Background & objectives: A 73-year-old man with a history of 
metastatic small bowel gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) 
who have undergone liver and small bowel resections was found 
to have recurrent peritoneal nodules on follow-up despite being 
on Imatinib. He subsequently underwent tumour resections.
Methods: On histological examination, the nodules composed 
of sheets of spindle cells and focal epithelioid cells with vesicu-
lar nuclei and prominent nucleoli. The tumour was positive for 
DOG1 and CD117 on immunohistochemistry which confirmed the 
diagnosis of GIST. It was then sent for next generation sequencing 
(NGS). NGS revealed KIT exon 17 N822K, exon 17 N822Y and 
exon 11 N564_P573delinsGSMET mutations.
Results: The heterogeneous molecular findings in conjunction 
with the variable tumour morphology had raised the possibil-
ity of intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH). A repeat sequencing 
was performed to confirm the findings. Quantumcyte Onco-
mask technology was used to assist in the sampling of tar-
geted areas for NGS. Three separate lysates on three areas of 
interest on a tumour section were created based on morphol-
ogy. The repeated NGS results verified the findings of ITH. 
Both areas 1 and 2 with spindle cells revealed KIT exon 11 
N564_P573delinsGSMET and exon 17 N822K mutations. Area 
3 with epithelioid cells showed KIT exon 17 N822Y and exon 
17 G803D mutations.
Conclusion: This case demonstrated the utilization of Quantumcyte 
Oncomask, a novel tissue masking technology in detection of 
heterogeneous resistant subclones in a treatment resistant GIST. 
It enables the sampling of targeted areas in a tumour section to 
increase the cellular purity for molecular sequencing especially 
for the analysis of tumour heterogeneity which is known to be 
associated with therapeutic resistance. The presence of different 
mutation subclones in GIST is also important in guiding 
oncologists on the treatment choices.

Cellular and cell-free targetable mutations in non-small cell 
carcinoma: a comparative study
N. Kumari*, R. Paturu, R. Lingaiah, S. Singh, N. Krishnani
*All India Institute of Medical Sciences Raebareli, India
Background & objectives: Therapeutic relevance of molecular alter-
ations in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is long established 
with detection in tissue being gold-standard. Insufficient tissue neces-
sitates use of non-invasive approach as an alternative. Targetable 
mutations in 100 paired (tissue, plasma) samples were evaluated.
Methods: 100 patients with paired (formalin fixed paraffin embed-
ded tissue and plasma) samples from treatment naïve NSCLC cases 
were tested for EGFR (exons 18, 19, 20, 21), ALK, ROS1 and MET 
through Realtime PCR. Interpretation was based on the difference 
in cycle threshold (CT) of reference and mutation (CT mutation 
– CT reference = ΔCT).
Results: Tissue samples showed mutations in 60 cases [EGFR 
mutation - 47, ALK rearrangement -12 (one case had concurrent 
EGFR and ALK alterations), ROS1 fusion - 2]. Plasma samples 
showed only EGFR mutation in 43 cases. Overall concordance 
between tissue and plasma was 62% which dropped to 44% in 
EGFR mutation-specific sub-type. 38% discordance was recorded 
for EGFR positive tissue samples while 17 cases of plasma samples 
showed EGFR mutation where tissue was wild. Two cases showed 
ALK rearrangement in tissue but EGFR mutation in plasma. Over-
all sensitivity and specificity for all molecular alterations in plasma 
were 46.7% and 62.5% which increased to 55.3% and 67.9% with 
respect to EGFR mutation.
Conclusion: Cell free testing for targetable mutations are com-
plementary but not a surrogate marker to tissue biopsies. Realtime 
PCR is quite sensitive in detecting cell-free mutations, however 
more sensitive techniques like next generation sequencing and 
appropriate collection and processing of cell free samples may 
be be used to increase the detection rate of targetable mutations 
in NSCLC.

positive prostate cancer by neural network based on pathway 
enrichment

Nyushko, D. Kalinin, G. Krasnov, A. Kudryavtseva
*Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of 
Sciences, Moscow, Russia
Background & objectives: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most 
common diseases in men. Biochemical recurrence occurs in 20-50% 
of patients after radical prostatectomy. Nearly half of PCa cases are of 
the TMPRSS2-ERG molecular subtype.
Methods: The study used RNA-Seq data for 154 locally advanced 
PCa samples from TCGA. Data analysis was performed in the R 
(v.3.6.3) using the edgeR (v.3.24.3). GSVA was performed using 
the GSVA package (v.1.34.0) with the GO, KEGG, and Reactome 
databases. To build a fully connected neural network (FCNN) as 
a predictive model, the keras and tensorflow libraries were used.
Results: We identified 7 differential enriched biological pathways 
between groups of biochemical recurrence (BCR) and biochemical 
recurrence free (BRF) cases within TMPRSS2-ERG-positive PCa: 
phytol metabolic process (GO:0033306, rs = -0.31), fatty alcohol 
metabolic process (GO:1903173, rs = -0.31), positive regulation 
of amyloid fibril formation (GO:1905908, rs = -0.47), heparanase 
activity (GO :0030305, rs = -0.38), positive regulation of ryanodine-
sensitive calcium-release channel activity (GO:0060316, rs = -0.44), 
centriolar satellite (GO:0034451, rs = 0.34) and Regulation of gene 
expression in endocrine-committed (NEUROG3+) progenitor cells 
(R-HSA-210746, rs = 0.49). The model based on combination 
GO:1905908 + GO:0034451 + GO:0030305 + R-HSA-210746 + 
GO:0060316 was most promising with AUC = 0.94.
Conclusion: Thus, we have identified changes in regulation of 
biological pathways that are involved in phytanic acid metabolism, 
amyloid bodies formation, neuroendocrine transformation, and cell 
differentiation, evidently inhibiting apoptosis and inducing tumour 
cell proliferation for BCR group within TMPRSS2-ERG-positive 
PCa. Based on changes in the above biological pathways, we built 
the neural network as a predictive model.

Is next generation sequencing the new golden standard for ALK 
testing? The diagnostic journey of an atypical case
R. Pirlog*, N. Piton, F. Marguet, A. Lamy, J. Sabourin
*Iuliu Hatieganu University, Romania
Background & objectives: Identification of ALK rearrangements 
in lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) is done by immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) followed by fluorescent-in-situ hybridization (FISH). However, 
multiple discordances between IHC and FISH analyses have been 
reported. Therefore, a more specific method to identify these altera-
tions is needed.
Methods: We present a case of a patient diagnosed in 2013 with a 
primary LUAD and in 2018 with a metastatic recurrence. ALK IHC 
was performed using clone D5F3. FISH analysis was carried out 
using Vysis ALK Break-Apart FFPE FISH Probe Kit. In 2021 the 
molecular analysis was carried out by Next Generation Sequencing 
(NGS) using Archer® FusionPlex Lung panel kit.
Results: In 2013 the right inferior lobe resection showed an infil-
trative LUAD, pT2aN0MxL0N0V0. The tumour was ALK-positive 
on IHC but negative on FISH. Molecular biology analysis was 
negative for EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF genes.
In 2018 was identified a 9 mm LUAD was histologically compat-
ible with the primary lesion from 2013 pT2aN0MxL0N0V0. The 
tumour was intensively positive for ALK on IHC but considered 
negative on FISH. Interestingly, the FISH analysis revealed a loss 
of the red signal in 75% of the nuclei analysed. Molecular biology 
analysis remained negative.
In 2021 NGS analysis using the Archer® FusionPlex Lung panel kit 
(Archer®) revealed an unusual fusion between ALK exon 2–EML4 
exon 13.
Conclusion: The unusual loss of the red signal suggested 
the presence of an atypical rearrangement in the 5’ part 
of the ALK gene which required additional investigation. 
Using a NGS panel we identified an atypical EML4-ALK 
fusion which was not detected by break-apart conventional 
FISH. We highlight the need for a new gold standard for 
ALK rearrangements testing represented by RNA NGS, a 
more sensitive approach that could identify patients with 
rare molecular phenotypes and increase the addressability 
of targeted therapies.

K. Bramlett
*ThermoFisher Scientific, USA
Background & objectives: Reliable nucleic acid (NA) extraction and 
quantitation can be challenging in most labs due to lack of expertise 
and processes in place. Here we report fully automated Genexus™ 
purification system to extract and quantify NA with ready to use 
consumables.
Methods: Four purification kits with automated workflows were 
developed to extract NA from FFPE, liquid biopsy, whole blood, 
PBL, BMA, cells, and tissue samples. An interactive user interface 
with touch screen allows intuitive run setup with customizable 
sample information, elution volumes and ability to select onboard 
quantitation. If opted, extracted nucleic acid is then quantified 
onboard using a relevant Qubit™ assay.
Results: To evaluate Genexus™ purification system per-
formance, various samples and input levels were tested and 
compared with existing extraction methods. gDNA (n=140) 
and total RNA (n=144) were extracted from sample inputs 
as low as 50 μL. DNA (n=72) and RNA (n=58) was also 
extracted from FFPE tumour resections as well as CNBs and 
FNAs. cfTNA (n=24) extractions were performed using up 
to 8mL of plasma. Study showed comparable NA extraction 
efficiency and quantitation accuracy to existing MagMax™ 
kits and manual Qubit™ assays respectively. All extracted 
NA was successfully used for downstream applications such 
as quantitative PCR or NGS confirming the high quality of 
extracted NA.
Conclusion: This report demonstrates the use of Genexus™ puri-
fication system to reliably extract and quantify NA from a variety 
of challenging clinical research samples and across multiple input 
levels to be successfully used in downstream applications. Ready 
to use consumables with REACH compliant reagents, fully auto-
mated extraction and quantitation allows the Genexus™ purifica-
tion system to be used with minimum user interaction, training 
and expertise.

Novel diagnostic value of driver gene transcription signatures 
to characterise clear cell renal cell carcinoma, ccRCC​

ogy, Hungary
Background & objectives: Describing and explaining cancer pheno-
types manifestation of mutation in marker genes should be examined 
by comparative tools. The approach of this study was a first attempt 
to use genetic markers to predict transcription related alteration for 
diagnostics purposes.
Methods: Subsequent to extraction of total RNA from snap-frozen 
normal and ccRCC tumour sections and reverse transcription, gene 
doses and expression of the main oncogenic drivers of ccRCC were 
measured by quantitative real-time PCR method, followed by cal-
culation of absolute and relative quantities of 5 genes. Diagnostic 
value of the approach was examined by descriptive statistics using 
SigmaPlot 12.5 software package.
Results: Determining the copy numbers of four tumour 
suppressors, VHL, SETD2, PBRM1 and BAP1, ccRCC tumorous 
and normal adjacent kidney tissues did not significantly differ. 
Moreover, the relative gene expressions of these genes did not 
correlate with the gene dosages. Our data revealed that the absolute 
mRNA levels and also the combined transcription profiles of the 
four aforementioned driver genes, supplemented by p14ARF, were 
significantly different in the tumorous samples than in normal 
ones. Using gene expression signature of four driver genes, ccRCC 
and normal kidney samples can be discriminated with 87 per cent 
sensitivity and 77% specificity. Besides, the expression of p14ARF 
can be used as an independent indicator.
Conclusion: We showed that by calculating the median 
transcription values of the four ccRCC tumour suppressors of 
3p25 and 3p21 chromosomal loci – VHL, SETD2, PBRM1, 
and BAP1 –, complemented that of the p14ARF, normal, and 
ccRCC tissues can be distinguished. However, proving that these 
markers can be suitable in the staging of the disease has not 
been inspected yet. Our results also highlight the importance 
of examining the manifestation of the genetic alterations lying 
behind tumour progression.

*1 Anatomical Pathology Department, Hospitais da Universidade 
de Coimbra, Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra. 2 Insti-
tute of Anatomical and Molecular Pathology, Faculty of Medicine 
of the University of Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: RET fusions through FISH/IHC/RT- 
PCR limit fusion partners recognition. NGS DNA/RNA allows fusion 
genes and splicing isoforms discrimination and fusion transcripts 
quantification. Liquid biopsies are FDA-approved/validated for cir-
culating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing in advanced-stage solid 
sequences/acquired resistance to molecular therapy.
Methods: A 70-years-old woman with Acinar Adenocarcinoma 
(CK7/TTF1+) dignosis in RU Lobetomy (2018). New lesions 
on PET-CT in 2019. Biopsy was performed: pulmonary 
Adenocarcinoma with EFGR mutated - c.2573T>G;p.(Leu858Arg). 
Erlotinib induced partial response; May 2021 started osimertinib 
therapy. In 2022, tissue re-biopsy and liquid biopsy were both 
analysed by NGS.
Results: Tissue biopsy DNA and RNA analysed by NGS showed 
the following genetic alterations: EGFR (exon 21): c.2573T>G;p.
(Leu858Arg) (17%) and MET Amplification (copy number 7,97). 
Analysis of liquid biopsy by NGS showed the following genetic 
changes: EGFR: c.2573T>G;p.(Leu858Arg)(1,5%); KRAS: 
c.175G>A;p.(Ala59Thr)(0,3%) and RET: c.2647G>T;p.(Ala-
883Ser)(0,1%).
Conclusion: RET fusion occurs in 1–2% of NSCLC, particularly 
in younger non‐smokers and high risk for brain metastasis is 
established. MEN2B/MEN1/MEN2A germline mutations have to 
be considered when RET mutations present low allele frequency; 
tumoral heterogeneity will always be considered if RET mutations 
in follow up with higher frequency. NGS cfDNA potentiality for 
actionable RET mutations, identification, as well as resistance 
mechanisms after initial response/resistence rearranged RET. Non-
invasive cfDNA testing simplifies RET-rearranged determination 
for TKIs follow up, preceding clinical imaging.

pen, E. Schuuring
*University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, 
Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, Groningen, The 
Netherlands
Background & objectives: Molecular diagnostics is not performed 
for all eligible NSCLC patients. A better understanding of the hurdles 
that are encountered by healthcare professionals within the care chain 
is of pivotal importance to improve outcome for lung cancer patients.
Methods: Pulmonary oncologists, pathologists and clinical sci-
entists in molecular pathology in a collaborating network of 4 
regional hospitals that submit predictive testing to an academic 
centre received a questionnaire addressing aspects of tissue avail-
ability, turn-around-time, costs and logistics related to predictive 
testing. Results were discussed with the participating hospitals in 
a virtual meeting. A written report was returned to the participants.
Results: Interviewed health care professionals were satisfied with the 
organization of predictive testing, but also identified room for improve-
ment. When a tissue biopsy cannot be obtained (~10% of all stage 
3b-4 lung cancer patients), access to comprehensive testing on a liquid 
biopsy needs to be organized. Molecular testing is preferred over PDL1 
and ALK immunohistochemistry when tissue is limited. Although turn-
around times for comprehensive analysis of mutations and gene fusions 
is acceptable (10-15 business days), sample flow and reporting could 
be further improved to expedite the results. To identify patients who 
may benefit from adjuvant targeted therapy, predictive testing should 
be expanded to stage 1-2 in lung cancer patients.
Conclusion: Active discussions between health care professionals 
are essential to find opportunities to further improve care for lung 
cancer patients. This study have led to proposals for improvement 
that will be evaluated in Q4 2022.

Background & objectives: Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded 
(FFPE) samples represent a challenge in recovering genetic material. 
Our objective is to evaluate the yield of genomic DNA from samples of 
primary tumour and aspirated lymph nodes extracted of paraffin blocks 
and from scraped histological/cytological slides.
Methods: Genomic DNA (gDNA) of 156 samples obtained from 
tumour resection or endobronchial/transbronchial biopsies (n=81) 
and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) obtained by endobronchial 
ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) 
(n=75) between 2011 and 2019 were extracted with the GeneR-
ead® DNA FFPE kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Of these sam-
ples, 61 were from FFPE tissue and 95 from scraped histological/
cytological slides.
Results: The average gDNA yield obtained from FFPE samples 
was 9.45 ng/μL (0.051-53 ng/ μL) for primary tumours (PT) and 
2.96 ng/μL (0.04 to 51 ng/ μL) for MLN. In PT samples extracted 
from scraped histological slides, the average yield was 12.17 ng/
μL (0.051 to 60 ng/ μL) and in samples of MLN from cytological 
slides was 18.37 ng/μL (0.057 to 217ng/ μL).
Conclusion: To obtain gDNA from scarce FFPE samples is an arduous 
process, especially in those with low cellularity, archived for more than 
5 years, as used in this study. We observed an improvement in gDNA 
yield from histological and cytological slides regards to FFPE samples. 
The use of samples obtained from scraped slides seems to be an effi-
cient tool to improve the gDNA yield for application in genomic tests.

OpenHRD - an open source platform for calculation of 
homologous recombination deficiency scores from OncoScan 
microarrays
A. Lara Gutierrez*, S. Sauer, K. Kashofer
*Medical University of Graz, Austria
Background & objectives: Homologous recombination deficiency is 
an important biomarker for PARP inhibitor therapy in ovarian cancer. 
Existing open-source tools lack standardized parameters and require 
IT expertise. This project aims to establish a web-based bioinformatic 
analysis system for robust assessment of genomic instability.
Methods: OncoScan-CNV data was obtained from DNA of 
formalin fixed embedded specimens. The analysis platform uses 
raw OncoScan microarray images and applies several open-source 
pipelines such as "Easy Copy Number", "Oncoscan_tools", "Allele-
specific copy number analysis of tumours" for the segmentation 
analysis. HRD calculation was performed by combination of 
custom R-scripts and the "HRDscore" pipeline. Additionally a 
commercial diagnostic HRD-test was obtained.
Results: The analysis comparison between several pipelines 
revealed that the combination of "Easy Copy Number" (EaCoN), 
and "Allele-specific copy number analysis of tumours" (ASCAT) 
was the best performing setup for raw data normalization and seg-
mentation, providing similar results to the proprietary Chromo-
some Analysis Suite software (ChAS, Thermo Fisher).
The OpenHRD pipeline for homologous recombination deficiency 
(HRD) calculation is a compilation of EaCoN, ASCAT, our custom 
R-scripts and "HRDscore". It is run with Django Python and Celery 
Task Queue web frameworks. Subsequently, the application of the 
fully automated OpenHRD pipeline with standardized parameters 
revealed a high correlation to results obtained with the commercial 
Myriad MychoiceDX test in a cohort of ovarian cancer.
Conclusion: Several studies have shown that HRD is a reliable 
marker for treatment decisions in PARPi therapy. In this study 
we provided a simple, standardized, web based system to analyse 
HRD, which is able to process the microarray scan raw image data 
and generate reliable HRD score values. Initial validation of the 
HRD platform has been performed in ovarian cancer, and extension 
to prostate and pancreatic cancer is ongoing.

Evaluation of PD-L1 expression in various formalin-fixed par-
affin embedded tumour tissue samples using SP263, SP142 and 
QR1 antibody clones
K. Kubelka-Sabit*, D. Jashar, V. Filipovski, M. Kondeva
*CH Acibadem Sistina, University Goce Delchev, North Macedonia
Background & objectives: Cancer cells can avoid immune destruction 
through the inhibitory ligand PD-L1. PD-1 is a surface cell receptor, 
part of the immunoglobulin family. Its ligand PD-L1 is expressed by 
tumour cells and stromal tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL).
Methods: Forty-four cancer cases were included in this study (24 
triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), 10 non-small cell lung can-
cer (NSCLC) and 10 malignant melanoma cases). Three clones of 
monoclonal primary antibodies were compared: QR1 (Quartett), SP 
142 and SP263 (Ventana). For visualization, ultraView Universal 
DAB Detection Kit from Ventana was used on an automated plat-
form for immunohistochemical staining Ventana BenchMark GX.
Results: Comparing the sensitivity of two different clones on same 
tissue samples from TNBC, we found that the QR1 clone gave 
higher percentage of positive cells than clone SP142, but there was 
no statistically significant difference. Comparing the sensitivity 
of two different clones on same tissue samples from malignant 
melanoma, the SP263 clone gave higher percentage of positive 
cells than the QR1 clone, but again the difference was not statisti-
cally significant. Comparing the sensitivity of two different clones 
on same tissue samples from NSCLC, we found higher percent-
age of positive cells using the QR1 clone in comparison with the 
SP142 clone, but once again, the difference was not statistically 
significant.
Conclusion: The three different antibody clones from two manu-
facturers Ventana and Quartett, gave comparable results with no 
statistically significant difference in staining intensity/ percent-
age of positive tumour and/or immune cells. Therefore, different 
PD-L1 clones from different manufacturers can potentially be used 
to evaluate the PD- L1 status in different tumour tissues. Due to 
the serious implications of the PD-L1 analysis in further treatment 
decisions for cancer patients, every antibody clone, staining pro-
tocol and evaluation process should be carefully and meticulously 
validated.

A rare case of neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in cutane-
ous melanoma
D. Pisani, J. Scerri, S. Baldacchino*
*Cellular Pathology, Department of Pathology, Mater Dei Hospital, 
Malta
Background & objectives: Neuroendocrine transdifferentiation is 
a rare event in cancer pathogenesis and refers to the phenomenon 
whereby a non-neuroendocrine malignancy differentiates along the 
neuroendocrine route. Herein we present a case of neuroendocrine 
transdifferentation in a primary cutaneous melanoma.
Methods: Case is clinically and pathologically evaluated 
accompanied by immunohistochemistry. This case treats a 
45-year-old male, with a history of a malignant melanoma 
excised from the left anterior shin in 2015 and multiple in transit 
metastatic lesions in subsequent years. On follow-up routine 
radionucleotide imaging studies performed in 2019, he was found 
to have uptake in a right inguinal lymph node.
Results: Histological analysis showed a tumour with striking 
neuroendocrine morphology that showed immunohistochemical 
co-expression of neuroendocrine and melanocytic markers. A 
retrospective review of the patient’s histology confirmed that the 
original melanocytic lesion was conventional epithelioid melanoma 
in vertical growth phase with no evidence of neuroendocrine dif-
ferentiation on morphological or immunohistochemical grounds. 
Retrospective analysis of two in-transit metastases on the right 
shin (2017) and the right side of the leg (2019) showed subtle 
morphological transdifferentiation of the melanocytic tumour with 
progressively increasing immunohistochemical expression of neu-
roendocrine markers. BRAF mutational analysis on the first in-
transit metastatic lesion, uncovered the 1799T>A (p.Val600Glu) 
mutation, which mutation has been conserved on the subsequent 
metastatic groin tumour.
Conclusion: This phenomenon has been best described in high 
grade prostatic adenocarcinoma, often after extensive therapy, 
representing a possible treatment resistance mechanism. 
Neuroendocrine transdifferentation, however, is vanishingly 
rare in melanocytic neoplasms. De novo neuroendocrine 
transdifferentiation typically represents an aggressive 
clinicopathological phenotype. Nonetheless, this patient was 
kept on dual BRAF inhibitor therapy and remains disease free to 
date. The mutational evolution of this tumour will be studied by 
Whole Genome Sequencing to elucidate potential drivers of the 
neuroendocrine phenotype.

docrine Transdifferentiation in malignant neoplasms – MOLNET”

Casati, S. Galimberti, F. Magni, F. Pagni
*University of Milano-Bicocca, School of Medicine and Surgery, 
Pathology Unit, San Gerardo Hospital, ASST Monza, Italy
Background & objectives: Noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasms 
with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) are low-risk thyroid 
lesions most often with RAS-type mutations. The current histological 
diagnostic criteria are still debated. In this study we’ll characterize 
NIFTP lesions by MALDI-MSI to highlight proteomic signatures.
Methods: Archived FFPE samples from eight NIFTP (5 RAS-
mutated and 3 RAS-WT) and one goiter were analysed by MALDI-
MSI using rapifleX MALDI Tissuetyper equipped with a Smart-
beam 3D laser at 2kHz frequency. Mass spectra were acquired 
in reflectron-positive mode. Images of FFPE NIFTPs tissues 
were acquired with 50 μm spatial resolution. CHCA matrix was 
removed, digested peptides were identified by nLC-ESI-MS/MS.
Results: Considering the proteome of the entire tissue sections, unsu-
pervised segmentation analysis highlighted i) the presence of the nodu-
lar lesions that arose in the context of normal thyroid parenchyma, with 
spectra clustered under separate nodes, ii) under the nodule nods, a 
further separation enlightened the presence of NIFTP and hyperplastic 
lesions, with spectra being clustered under separate nodes. The pro-
teomic data complexity was investigated and unsupervised principal 
component analysis highlighted specific patterns of the two NIFTP 
entities. ROC analysis highlighted that five ions were able to discrimi-
nate RAS-mutated and RAS-WT NIFTP.
These results underline the MALDI-MSI capability of detecting 
proteomic signatures within regions that are indistinguishable at 
the microscopic level.
Conclusion: Spatial-proteomics is an outstanding approach to dif-
ferentiate NIFTPs from other follicular-patterned features and to 
characterize classic and atypical cases, highlighting the potential 
role of Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI)-
Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) technology as a support to tra-
ditional pathology.

Bardai, L. Chbani
*Laboratory of Biomedical and Translational research, Faculty of 
Medicine and Pharmacy Fez, Morocco
Background & objectives: Attaining high-quality genomic DNA is 
considered one of the most important phases in molecular oncology 
diagnoses, the aim of our study is to evaluate the influence of cold 
ischemia and fixation time on the DNA quantity of cancer digestive 
specimens.
Methods: 32 FFPE blocks of colorectal cancer, liver cancer, Pan-
creaticoduodenectomy, and gastric cancer tissues were obtained 
and macro-dissected. We used the following cold ischemia times: 
less than 1 hour (CIT-1), and 96 hours (CIT-5). 24 hours (FT-1) and 
one week (FT-4) for the fixation times. We applied a fluorometric 
procedure (Qubit 3.0) to determine the quantity of the collected 
DNA samples.
Results: The correlation between normal and tumour tissue was 
statistically significant for pre-analytical parameters evaluated 
with a strong influence on tumour tissue. For fixation times, 
the correlation between both (FT-1) and (FT-4) was significant 
with p = 0.059. For cold ischemia times, the value p = 0.028 was 
significant for both (CIT-1) and (CIT-5). The Qubit detected the 
lowest DNA concentrations in all prolonged fixation samples (FT-
4) with an average of 1,55 ng-μl. The highest DNA concentrations 
were in samples with less than one hour of cold ischemia duration 
with an average of 159 ng-μl.
Conclusion: our preliminary research revealed that these pre-ana-
lytical parameters have a significant impact on the concentration 
and DNA quantification, as well as its variation depending on the 
type of tissue with more marked consequences on tumour tissue.

Monitoring PIK3CA molecular heterogeneity in breast cancer 
using liquid biopsy
P. Santiago Díaz*, I. Vázquez, L. Comerma, L. Camacho, R. Lon-
garón, S. Servitja, B. Lloveras, B. Bellosillo, S. Clavé
*Pathology Department, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain
Background & objectives: Breast cancer is a dynamic disease with 
continuous clonal selection reflecting singular molecular alterations. 
This heterogeneity occurs intratumor and even among primary tumours 
and metastases. This study aimed to assess the role of liquid biopsy for 
monitoring molecular alterations.
Methods: A 54-year-old woman with infiltrating lobular breast 
carcinoma was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radical 
mastectomy and hormone therapy. Disease was controlled for five 
years until increased levels of biochemical markers (CEA and 
Ca15.3) led to the detection of bone metastasis. Molecular charac-
terization of the primary tumour identified H1047R mutation on 
PIK3CA, which was subsequently followed by digital PCR (dPCR).
Results: Among liquid biopsies, PIK3CA H1047R allelic fraction 
(AF) remained at low levels and became undetectable during five 
years. However, disease progressed with elevated tumour markers, 
new bone lesions and skin metastases. This evident miscorrelation 
prompted new genomic characterizations. Next generation sequenc-
ing (NGS) on a skin lesion showed mutations on TP53 and ERBB2, 
but no alterations on PIK3CA. NGS analysis on plasma samples 
revealed three new PI3KCA mutations (E545K with the highest AF, 
E542K and E726K) and three TP53 mutations. We then performed 
new dPCR targeting PIK3CA E545K mutation on stored liquid 
biopsies. This mutation, while not predominant, was the one that 
correlated best with biochemical and clinical evolution.
Conclusion: Digital PCR on cell free plasma samples allows 
continuous monitoring of the evolving molecular alterations but 
do not completely reflect tumour heterogeneity. Clonal dynamics 
constitutes a major challenge during cancer follow-up, that can 
be assessed, despite the higher cost, by NGS of plasma or tissue 
samples.

*Habib Thameur Hospital, Pathology Department, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) activating oncogenic mutations are detected in 20% of non-
small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) and are encountered in exons 18 
to 21. We aimed to report the frequency and types of these mutations 
in our practice.
Methods: EGFR mutation status of 75 formalin-fixed and paraffin-
embedded samples of NSCLC was assessed. Mutational analysis 
concerned exon 18-21 by the ARMS-Scoprion real-time PCR tech-
nique using the Therascreen EGFR RGQ PCR mutation kit allow-
ing the detection of 29 somatic mutations in the EGFR gene.
Results: Average age was 55 years with a male predominance 
(63%). Adenocarcinoma was the most common histological type 
(93%), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (6%) and adenosqua-
mous carcinoma (1%). Molecular analysis showed that 23% (17 
cases) had one or two mutations. Del-exon19, L858R and Insertion 
were observed with respective frequencies of 65% (11 cases), 23% 
(4 cases) and 6.67% (1 case). Only one case presented a concomi-
tance of two mutations: L858R and the resistance mutation TKI 
T790M. Of the mutated cases, 65% (11/17 cases) were female and 
94% (16/17 cases) were adenocarcinoma.
Conclusion: The frequency of mutated cases is slightly higher than 
the frequency already described in a previous study by our team 
(11.5%) but close to the frequency of mutated cases in the Cauca-
sian population (16%). The most frequent activating mutations are 
deletions of exon 19 and the L858R mutation of exon 21, the two 
representing 90% of activating mutations.

*Department of Pathology, Charles Nicolle Hospital Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The co-occurrence of two or more muta-
tions in the same oncogene in gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) 
is rare and complete pathological response after neoadjuvant treatment 
with Imatinib is rare.
Methods: We report the case of a 41-year-old woman presenting 
with abdominal pain. Radiological explorations revealed a gastric 
mass of 10.5 cm. The histological examination of a biopsy speci-
men concluded to a GIST. The tumour was locally advanced. The 
patient had neoadjuvant treatment with Imatinib. Four months after 
the treatment, the patient was operated with a complete pathologi-
cal response.
Results: Extraction of DNA was done by Qiagen kit from 4 
sections of 10 μm FFPE biopsies. The five hot spot regions 
comprising the exons and their flanking regions of the KIT 
gene (9, 11 and 17) and PDGFRA (12 and 18) were analysed. 
A co-occurrence of 6 coding variations in the KIT gene was 
observed. Exon 9 indicates the presence of a missense p varia-
tion. Ala502Asp which has never been described. On exon 11, 
five mutations were found, including 2 known (Leu576Pro and 
Pro577Ser) and 3 others (Gln575Pro, Thr574Pro and Pro577Pro) 
not described. All variations at exon 17 and exon 12 of PDGFRA 
were polymorphisms.
Conclusion: Our case showed a concomitance of mutations of 
exons 9+11 of the KIT gene in a gastric GIST; this co-occurrence 
is rare and its impact on the response to Imatinib is little known. 
Pathological complete response is rare in GISTs and generally 
associated with exon 11 mutations affecting codons 557 and 
559, our case carries variations affecting codons 574, 575, 576 
and577, plus exon 9 mutation in codon 502. This co-occurrence 
may be the factor responsible for this good response.

(STIII-STIVNxM1) with clinical progression after treatment and 
visceral metastases of tumours, harboring specific mutations. 
ctDNA concentration were assessed by quantitative acPCR and 
spectrophotometry. CTCs extraction performed from 20 ml of 
peripheral blood by cytopheresis in density gradient. CTCs were 
assessed morphologically and immunocytochemicaly.
Results: Among 10(67%) of 15 patients with stage StIIIM1 after adju-
vant chemotherapy (ACT), photodynamic(PDT) and target therapy(TT) 
mitotic activity of CTCs were detected. CTC DNA concentration was 
twice as higher then ctDNA concentration and number of apoptotic 
CTCs were 0-1. Among patients (StIII-StIVIM1) with progression 
after ACT and stabilization the process after PDT, in 9 (81%) cases 
CTC DNA concentration was lower than ctDNA concentration, and 
the number of apoptotic CTC cells were 2-5. Secondary mutation 
EGFRT780M was detected in 3 (60%) of 5 NSCLC with resistance 
to TT. Of these, 2 cases with double mutations. The concentration of 
ctDNA harboring EGFRT780M mutation is higher in cfDNA fraction 
than i CTC fraction.
Conclusion: Mitotic activity, low percentage of apoptotic cells 
among CTCs, ctDNA concentration after CTCs lysis is higher than 
concentration of cell free ctDNA are an unfavourable prognosis 
(no response therapy). High percentage of apoptotic cells among 
CTCs and ctDNA concentration after CTCs lysis is less than the 
concentration of cell free ctDNA is a favourable prognosis. Sec-
ondary resistance mutations analysis is more efficacy by ctDNA. 
The role of CTC for therapy monitoring and prognosis of cancer is 
more significant than сtDNA.

Collapsing glomerulopathy associated with Covid-19 diag-
nosed one year after SARS-CoV-2 infection: a case report of 
an emerging entity
C. Nikolaidou, C. Gouta*, F. Iatridi, M. Stangou, I. Venizelos
*Department of Histopathology, Hippokration General Hospital of 
Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece
Background & objectives: Collapsing glomerulopathy is one of the 
most common glomerulopathies associated with SARS-CoV-2 infec-
tion. It usually presents as rapidly progressive renal failure within a 
month of infection and has been associated with apolipoprotein L1 risk 
alleles, encountered mainly in African patients.
Methods: We report the case of a 29-year-old Caucasian male with 
a history of kidney transplantation due to end stage renal disease/
IgA nephropathy, who presented with renal transplant dysfunction 
one year after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient was subjected 
to renal ultrasound and DTPA scan that showed mild to moderate 
glomerular disorder. Additionally, a renal biopsy was performed.
Results: Light microscopy examination revealed two major 
features: tuft collapse with pseudocrescent formation in two of the 
four non globally sclerosed glomeruli and focal acute tubular injury. 
No signs of endarteritis were observed. Immunofluorescence 
staining for C1q, C3d, IgA, IgG, IgM and κ/λ light chains was 
negative. Immunohistochemistry for C4d was also negative on 
peritubular capillaries. Considering patient’s history, the diagnosis 
of collapsing glomerulopathy associated with COVID-19 was 
made.
Conclusion: Kidney involvement is frequent in patients with 
SARS-CoV-2 infection with collapsing glomerulopathy being the 
most common among glomerulopathies. However, there is little 
information over the presentation of these entities in transplant 
patients. Our case report describes a biopsy-proven collapsing glo-
merulopathy occurring in a kidney transplant Caucasian recipient 
with a low-risk apolipoprotein L1 donor background (father) and a 
SARS-CoV-2 infection one year earlier. Our histological findings 
in the kidney allograft were similar to those described in native 
kidneys of COVID-19 patients.

A tale of a transplant: renal allograft granulomatous intersti-
tial nephritis in early post-transplant period
A. Nalwa*, S. Kumar, U. Rani, N. Bajpai, M. Chaturvedy, R. 
Jhorawat, V. Vishwajeet, M. Rao
*All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur, India
Background & objectives: Granulomatous interstitial nephritis in the 
early post-transplant period is an uncommon cause of kidney dysfunc-
tion reported in <1% of renal allograft recipients. Accurate diagnosis 
and determination of aetiology are important due to consequences of 
altering immunosuppression in early post-transplant period.
Methods: 31-year male with ESRD(unknown cause) received ABO 
compatible live related renal transplant and was given basiliximab 
induction followed by methylprednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil 
and tacrolimus for maintenance immunosuppression. Graft function 
was slow with gradual reduction in urine output,Day0 (5,500 ml) 
to Day3(2400ml) and rise in serum creatinine(3.0mg/dL on Day0 
gradually to 4.0 mg/dL on Day3) and developed graft tenderness 
by Day3.
Results: Urinalysis showed 2+ proteinuria and 70-80 WBCs per 
high-power field. A transplant kidney biopsy revealed multiple 
small non-necrotising epithelioid cell granulomas suggestive of 
granulomatous interstitial nephritis. There was no evidence of acid-
fast bacilli and Gomori-Methenamine silver stain was negative for 
fungal profiles. There was evidence of patchy acute tubular injury 
in the form of epithelial simplification and reparative basophilia 
however, no viral cytopathic changes were seen in the tubules and 
immunohistochemistry for CMV and SV40 large T antigen were 
negative. No definitive evidence of cellular or humoral rejection 
was seen in the biopsy. C4d stain for humoral rejection was nega-
tive. Overall a drug-induced cause was favoured.
Conclusion: Drug-induced granulomatous nephritis in allografts 
has been reported from day8 to day720 post-transplantation. This is 
one of the index cases showing granulomatous interstitial nephritis 
post-operative Day4 with the likely culprit being sulfonamides. The 
graft function significantly improved after stopping all the poten-
tial offending medicines. Although geographically, tuberculosis 
is the most common cause of granulomatous interstitial nephritis 
in countries like India accurate determination of the cause is of 
utmost importance for early recovery and long-term graft survival.

McLean, T. Cairns, M. Willicombe, C. Roufosse*
*Imperial College London, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Donor specific antibodies (DSA) predis-
pose kidney transplant patients to antibody mediated rejection (AMR). 
AMR is a leading cause of graft loss. We prospectively studied the his-
tological features in biopsies taken at the time of appearance of a DSA.
Methods: All patients transplanted in our centre between January 
2019 and November 2021 were screened (at 1,2,3,6 and 12months 
post-transplantation and then every year) for the development of

DSA. All patients who developed a de novo DSA were offered a 
biopsy. We report here histological findings in these biopsies using 
the Banff classification.
Results: Out of 570 consecutive transplant patients, 82 develop 
DSA at mean 42 days (+/- 106 days) post-transplant (14.4%)( 39% 
Class I, 40% class II, 21% class I + class II). 57/82 patients had a 
biopsy at a median of 33 days (+/- 114) post-DSA detection. 47% 
did not show any histological features of rejection, 30% showed 
histological features of AMR (either suspicious for or definite 
AMR), 16% showed only histological features of T cell-mediated 
rejection (TCMR) (either borderline and TCMR) and 7% had his-
tological features of both AMR and TCMR.
Conclusion: In a prospective cohort of patients with de novo 
DSA, 53% of those investigated with a biopsy showed histological 
features of rejection (including incomplete/suspicious features). 
Next steps will involve molecular analysis of those biopsies.

*Hospital Universitario Reina Sofía, Spain
Background & objectives: Angioinmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma 
(AITL) is a rare form of peripheral T-cell lymphoma , wich can have 
renal involvement. The aim of this case is to emphasize the importance 
of renal biopsy for diagnosis of hematologic systemic diseases with 
renal manifestations.
Methods: We report a man (48 yo) with diffuse lymphadenopathy 
and B symptoms, proteinuria (9g/24h), hypoalbuminemia (2,2 g/
dl) and hyperlipidemia (LDLc 134 mg/dl) - Nephrotic Syndrome, 
NS-. Other findings were kappa light chain elevation, high kappa/
lambda ratio, elevation of IgG, and eosinophilia. The histological 
study included renal, axilar adenopathy and bone marrow biopsy.
Results: The biopsy of an axilar adenopathy showed a monomor-
phic infiltrate of lymphoid cells, positive for Epstein-Barr virus 
(EBV), yet not conclusive, and follicular dendritic cell hyperpla-
sia. The renal biopsy showed monomorphic proliferation of highly 
pleomorphic atypical T-cells (CD3+), with PD1 expression, and 
with polytypic plasma cells. The infiltrate affected the interstitium, 
without glomerular or tubular involvement. These cells were posi-
tive for MUM1 (marker of activated T-cells and plasma cells). The 
cells infiltrating both lymph node and renal interstitium showed 
TCR rearrangement, yet these were a minor group in the lymph 
node compared to those found in the renal biopsy. The bone mar-
row biopsy had not lymphoid cells infiltrate.
Conclusion: AITL are aggressive and account for less than 1% of 
all lymphomas, and are associated to EBV in more than 80% of all 
cases. Several forms of renal involvement have been described, but 
they are very rare. Renal infiltration was described twice in the lit-
erature, both associated with cutaneous rash and splenomegaly. NS 
due to renal infiltration only has been described once. Four cases 
of NS secondary to glomerulopathy associated with this entity have 
been described.

Renal biopsy findings following complement C5 inhibitor 
Ravulizumab treatment in a patient with C3 glomerulonephritis
S. Turkevi-Nagy*, B. Iványi, Z. Prohászka, D. Jakab, C. Bereczki
*University of Szeged, Albert Szent-Györgyi Health Centre, 
Department of Pathology, Szeged, Hungary
Background & objectives: C3 glomerulonephritis is attributed to 
the dysregulated alternative complement pathway. The continuous 
C-activation can be blocked with monoclonal antibodies against C5. 
We present a patient’s renal biopsies with histologically and serologi-
cally proven C3 GN before and after C5 inhibitor treatment.
Methods: A 17-year-old, obese (BMI: 39,8kg/m2) Caucasian male 
patient was hospitalized for nephritic syndrome. Two years earlier, 
he had been diagnosed with C3 GN. Eculizumab treatment was 
effective, however, haematuria and proteinuria recurred after con-
version to Ravulizumab. A renal biopsy was performed. Besides 
routine immunofluorescence, the slides were also evaluated for 
IgG subtypes. The findings were compared with previous pretreat-
ment biopsies.
Results: Active disease with diffuse-global endocapillary 
hypercellularity and membranoproliferative pattern was observed; 
5% of the glomeruli exhibited fibrocellular crescents. Confluating 
deposits were seen along the capillary loops. Regarding IF, 
similarly to the pretreament biopsies, diffuse-global mesangial and 
peripheral C3 positivity was present. In addition, IgG2, IgG4 and 
restricted kappa deposition was seen in similar location as C3. EM 
demonstrated increased amount of mesangial, intramembranous 
and subendothelial deposits, which segmentally exhibited more 
dense, powdery-like appearance. There was a mild increase in Total 
Renal Chronicity Score (1/10 to 3/10). Complement serology tests 
found increased alternative pathway activity and consumption, 
confirming ineffective terminal complement blockade. Considering 
the obesity, the dosage of Ravulizumab was increased.
Conclusion: We demonstrated a patient with novel IgG2-IgG4-
kappa positivity in the same distribution as the deposited C3 fol-
lowing Ravulizumab treatment. This immunophenotype and the 
powdery deposits on EM may correspond to the monoclonal anti-
bodies binding to the terminal complement components. We imply 
that because of the increased body weight, the drug was possibly 
consumed by the accumulated complement. To our knowledge, 
this is the first documented case demonstrating the morphological 
effects of C5 inhibitor treatment in the European literature.

An atypical case of melanin deposition in kidney
S. Sevim*, E. Isiktas Sayilar, I. Ergün, S. Kiremitci
*Ankara University Medical School, Pathology Department, 
Turkey
Background & objectives: Pigment deposition in kidney may result 
from various conditions most commonly due to rhabdomyolysis, intra-
vascular hemolysis and cholestasis. Melanin deposition in kidney is a 
rare condition that is encountered in course of diffuse cutaneous mela-
nosis in metastatic malignant melanoma (MM).
Methods: We report a 28-year-old female patient presented with 
headache and high blood pressure with no significant previous 
clinical history. Physical examination was normal. Laboratory tests 
revealed very high level of serum creatinine (9.8 mg/dL). Urine 
analysis showed neither proteinuria nor haematuria. Renal biopsy 
was performed to clarify whether the kidney injury is acute or 
chronic.
Results: Kidney biopsy revealed 17 glomeruli, which of 3 was 
globally sclerotic and acute tubular injury with regenerative 
changes in a background of interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy. 
Tubular epithelium were filled with golden-brown granular pig-
ment which was confirmed to be melanin by Masson-Fontana. 
There were no atypical/malignant cells in the tissue. The biopsy 
was reported as acute tubular injury with diffuse tubular melanin 
deposition in scarred kidney, and it was recommended to investi-
gate the patient systemically for a potential MM focus. However, 
S311

none of the clinical/radiological examinations revealed any mass 
lesion that could favour MM. It has been more than 2 years of fol-
low up that the patient is still stable.
Conclusion: According to literature review, relevant published 
reports presented melanin deposition in kidney as a manifestation 
of diffuse cutaneous melanosis. However our unique case shows 
that it is not always associated with MM. This finding makes it 
even more difficult to understand the physiopathogenesis of mela-
nin deposition in tissues in the absence of concomitant tumour 
component.

An unusual case of diffuse lupus nephritis with features sugges-
tive of overlapping cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis
G. Terinte-Balcan*, G. Stefan, S. Stancu, S. Cinca, M. 
Gherghiceanu
*"Victor Babes" National Institute of Pathology, Romania
Background & objectives: Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis can be associ-
ated with many diseases such as tumours, infections or autoimmune 
processes. Even though features of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis have 
been rarely described in patients with lupus, the exact link between the 
two diseases remains unclear.
Methods: A 39-year-old female was admitted in our nephrology 
unit for nephrotic syndrome. Blood tests showed low C3 and 
C4 and positive ANA, anti-Ds-DNA, anti-SSA and SSB. Serum 
cryoglobulins were negative. A kidney biopsy was performed 
and the tissue was divided for light microscopy (LM), 
immunofluorescence microscopy (IF) and electron microscopy 
(EM).
Results: LM showed 8 glomeruli with PAS+ hyaline thrombi in 
most capillary loops, marked thickening of capillary walls and 
mild segmental endocapillary hypercellularity. Rare glomeruli 
had segments of tuft sclerosis. IF showed “full house” staining. 
EM showed dense deposits that were in the mesangial areas, 
intramembranous, subendothelial and subepithelial. Some depos-
its had a vague microtubular structure on high magnification. A 
diagnosis of diffuse lupus nephritis (class IV) with features sug-
gestive of associated cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis was 
made. The patient was started on intravenous cyclophosphamide. 
After six months of induction therapy, remission of the nephrotic 
syndrome was obtained and maintenance therapy with azathio-
prine was initiated.
Conclusion: This case represents an unusual case of diffuse 
lupus nephritis. The massive intracapillary deposits (“hyaline 
thrombi”) and also the vague microtubular structure observed in 
some of the deposits using high magnification on EM raises the 
possibility of concurrent cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis. 
It is well known that mixed cryoglobulinemia can be present in 
patients suffering from lupus, but the exact impact that this has 
on the findings observed on the kidney biopsy of lupus patients 
is not well established.

Late post-transplant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis after 
covid-19: causal factor or recurrence of primary disease?
J. Osuna Soto*, F. Leiva-Cepas, I. Sánchez Ramírez, M.J. Gálvez 
Medina, R. Ortega Salas
*Reina Sofía University Hospital in Córdoba, Spain
Background & objectives: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 
(FSGS) is an histopathological pattern common to various underlying 
aetiologies. Primary FSGS is a podocytopathy that frequently recur on 
early post-transplant stage. In patients with covid19 and proteinuria, 
collapsing variant of FSGS is the most common lesion.
Methods: We present a 20-year-old man with end-stage kidney 
disease of unknow ethiology, who underwent kidney transplanta-
tion in 2015. He has a history of COVID-19 infection in 2020, and 
developed FSGS 6 years after transplantation.
Results: One of the most common kidney lesion related to SARS-
COV2 infection is FSGS, especially in its collapsing and perihi-
lar forms. In most cases, recurrence of primary FSGS occurs in 
the first two years after transplantation, especially within the first 
days and even immediately after the surgery. However, it also may 
appear on later stages (>3 months), but being extremely infrequent 
in its very late form (years).
Conclusion: Despite being a very rare event, the possibility of a 
recurrence of primary FSGS presented in this case (more than 6 
years after kidney transplantation) is a plausible option that must 
be taken into account, given that it is not known the primary under-
lying disease of the patient. On the other hand, it would be impru-
dent to completely ignore the role that COVID19 infection might 
have played on the development of the FSGS.

Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome: a 
case series
K. Palamaris, A. Stofas*, M. Destouni, A. Patereli, H. Theodoro-
poulou, C. Paliouras, K. Stylianou, H. Gakiopoulou
*1st Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, National and 
Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: TINU syndrome is a rare, immune-
mediated entity, characterized by oculorenal inflammation. Diagnosis 
requires exclusion of all other causes of tubulointerstitial nephritis 
(TIN). We present a case series with clinical, laboratory and renal 
biopsy findings denotative of TINU syndrome.
Methods: Five patients experienced ocular and renal manifesta-
tions, defined by bilateral uveitis and photosensitivity, along with 
decline of renal function. In three patients, increased serum creati-
nine was accompanied by non-nephrotic range proteinuria. The rest 
of the laboratory evaluation was normal apart from the presence of 
elevated CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels. All 
patients underwent renal biopsy.
Results: Histological evaluation revealed interstitial inflammatory 
infiltration consisting mainly of lymphocytes, with a T-cell 
predominance, along with several macrophages. Inflammation 
severity varied among different patients, with some showing 
scarce foci of immune cell clusters, while others demonstrated a 
dense, diffuse interstitial infiltration. Interestingly, in one case, a 
granulomatous pattern, characterized by multiple non-necrotic, ill-
defined granulomas was detected. Tubulitis was also encountered 
in some patients. A divergence was also noted regarding chronicity 
index, with different levels of tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis 
and global glomerulosclerosis among different cases. Intrestingly, 
in one patient, electron microscopy revealed scattered granular 
electron-dense-deposits along some tubular basement membranes 
creating differential diagnostic issues with anti-TBM and immune-
complex TIN.
Conclusion: Our cases seem to represent distinct progressive 
steps within the continuum of disease evolution. Patients with 
more prominent inflammation might represent a more initial state, 
while those with more severe chronicity index, probably depict 
more advanced stages. The predominance of T-cells predicates a 
cellular-mediated-autoimmune mechanism, as the driving force of 
the disease occurrence. Interestingly, medical history in one of our

of cannabinoids, which have been reported as triggering factors 
for TINU syndrome.

Tubulointerstitial nephritis and eosinophilia in renal biopsy. 
Prognostic marker?
F. Leiva-Cepas*, C. Muñoz Martínez, M.J. Gálvez Medina, I. 
Sánchez Ramírez, R. Ortega Salas
*University Hospital "Reina Sofía", Spain
Background & objectives: To determine whether the presence of 
eosinophils in renal biopsy and haematuria is associated with a worse 
renal prognosis in patients with tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN).
Methods: Retrospective observational study in 79 (41 were 
women) patients diagnosed with TIN by renal biopsy between 
2000-2020. The patients were classified: presence/absence of 
eosinophils in the renal biopsy and haematuria in the urinary sedi-
ment. Clinical-analytical and histopathological variables were ana-
lysed, as well as an analysis of renal survival (GFR<60 ml/min/
m2) in the study follow-up (36.5 months).
Results: Antibiotics was the most frequent cause (34.2%). At the 
time of biopsy, 58.2% of patients had haematuria and 37.7% of 
patients showed eosinophils on biopsy and had a more severe acute 
renal failure (ARF). The combination of the groups of esoinophilia 
in the biopsy and haematuria revealed: 72.4% of the patients with 
eosinophils in the biopsy presented haematuria, and higher Cr 
elevation (4.12±2.1 vs 2.96±1.49, p=0.016), proteinuria [21.58 
(6.8-86.6) vs 0.12(0.01-2.77) g/24h, p=0.001]. On the other hand, 
45.7% of patients in the haematuria group had eosinophils in the 
biopsy. 45.7% of patients in the haematuria group had eosinophils 
in the biopsy and 13% had peripheral eosinophilia.
Conclusion: Patients with NTI who present eosinophilia in the 
biopsy and haematuria present a more severe renal failure. The 
analysis of these parameters could be useful when predicting 
complications in these patients. Eosinophilia has traditionally been 
considered a factor that is invariably present in renal biopsies and 
in peripheral blood, a fact that is not confirmed in our study.

The usefulness of IgG4 immunohistochemical staining in 
differentiation of idiopathic and secondary membranous 
nephropathy

Škodrić, D. Dunđerović, J. Filipović, J. Marković Lipkovski
*Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Bel-
grade, Serbia
Background & objectives: No reliable biomarker has yet been identi-
fied that could be used in the differential diagnosis of idiopathic and 
secondary forms of membranous nephropathy (MN), but it has been 
shown that IgG4 is the dominant IgG subclass in idiopathic MN.
Methods: Here we performed IgG4 immunohistochemical stain-
ing (IGHG4/1345, Abcam, 1: 100), on 50 kidney biopsy paraf-
fin sections (18 idiopathic and 32 secondary MN). All cases with 
fine-granular IgG4 deposits along the glomerular basement mem-
brane were pointed out as positive. Sensitivity and specificity were 
calculated.
Results: The IgG4 was expressed in glomeruli in 16/18 idiopathic 
MN (89%), and in 7/32 secondary MN (22%). Overall, the sensitiv-
ity of IgG4 for the diagnosis of idiopathic MN was 88.9%, while 
the specificity was 78.1%. Among secondary MN with positive 
IgG4, patients had known haematological/immunological disor-
ders (plasma cell dyscrasias or IgG4- related disease). The absence 
of IgG4 was related to all other known secondary causes of MN 
(systemic lupus erythematosus or malignant non-haematological 
diseases).
Conclusion: IgG was not absolutely specific for the diagnosis of 
idiopathic membrane nephropathy, but the spectrum of secondary 
etiological factors leading to a positive finding is clearly narrowed 
(plasma cell dyscrasias or IgG4- related disease). Nevertheless, 
IgG4 negative idiopathic MN is not frequently observed, but the 
negative IgG4 finding in patients without any evidence of second-
ary cause at the time of diagnosis, should not sharply exclude pos-
sible upcoming secondary aetiology.

Novel CLPTM1L-TERT fusion in an IDH-wt WHO Grade 4 
left frontal glioma radiologically masquerading as a pilocytic 
astrocytoma
S.H. Lai*, P.Y. Tang, X.F. Chen, B.W.Q. Loke
*Singapore General Hospital, Duke-NUS Medical School, 
Singapore
Background & objectives: A previously well 24-year-old man pre-
sented with altered mental status. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed 
a FLAIR mildly hyperintense well circumscribed intra-axial cystic 
lesion with a T1w isointense solid component showing possible haem-
orrhage. Radiological impression was pilocytic astrocytoma.
Methods: The resected lesion was examined histologically and 
extensively interrogated with immunohistochemistry which 
included GFAP, IDH1, ATRX, p53, Ki67, EMA, CD34, NeuN, 
neurofilament, SOX10, BRAF V600E, L1CAM, P65 and H3G34R. 
Further molecular studies included FISH analysis for 1p/19q 
co-deletion, IDH sequencing, MGMT MS-PCR for promoter 
methylation and Archer Fusionplex sequencing.
Results: The highly vascularised glial neoplasm showed variable 
morphology of ependymomatous differentiation, pilomyxoid astro-
cytoma and oligodendroglioma. Rosenthal fibres and eosinophilic 
granular bodies were not seen. High grade features such as mitoses, 
necrosis and microvascular proliferation were noted. The lesion 
showed GFAP positivity, IDH1-wildtype, conserved ATRX, weak 
p53 staining and rare EMA perinuclear dot-positivity. Ki67 label-
ling was 30%. There were no features of a neuronal differentiation. 
Patchy BRAF V600E and L1CAM staining was noted but P65 and 
H3G34R staining were negative. The lesion was 1p/19q intact, 
negative for mutations in IDH1 and IDH2, and MGMT promoter 
non-methylated. Archer Fusionplex revealed gene fusion between 
exon 16 of CLPTM1L and exon 2 of TERT.
Conclusion: This was an intriguing glial neoplasm in a young 
patient, harbouring a unique gene fusion. Single nucleotide pol-
ymorphisms at the CLPTM1L-TERT 5p15.33 locus have been 
described as risk factors for malignancies of the lung, breast and 
pancreaw. Here, we describe a novel fusion between these 2 genes 
in a malignant glioma.

*Pathology Unit, Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Centro 
Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma is a 
circumscribed astrocytic glioma that generally occur supratentori-
ally, more frequently in young patients. BRAF V600E mutation and 
homozygous CDKN2A and/or CDKN2B deletion are common altera-
tions in this entity that also presents a DNA methylation profile.
Methods: We report the case of a 19-year-old woman that pre-
sented headache, nausea and visual hallucinations. Imagologi-
cal study revealed an expansive lesion in the left temporal lobe 
with hyperintense signal on T2-weighted image and postcontrast 
enhancement on MRI. Adjacent oedema was slightly pronounced. 
Surgical ressection was performed.
Results: Histopathological examination showed a neoplasia with 
solid and non-invasive growth pattern, predominantly composed 
of multinucleated giant cells with pleomorphic nuclei, frequent 
intranuclear pseudoinclusions and prominent nucleoli. There 
were also large epithelioid cells with eosinophilic and dense 
cytoplasm, hyperchromatic central nuclei and astrocytes filled 
with lipid droplets resembling xanthomatous cells. Ocasionally 
rhabdoid cells with eccentric nuclei and eosinophilic granular 
bodies were observed. Mitotic activity represented 13 mitoses/10 
HPF. A moderate lymphocytic perivascular infiltrate and reticulin 
deposition were present. Immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse 
positivity for vimentin and focal for GFAP, OLIGO2, MAP2, EMA, 
CD34, neurofilament and synaptophysin. Ki67 was 10-15%. BRAF 
V600E was negative at immunohistochemistry and by sequencing 
analysis.
Conclusion: The diagnosis was pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma 
(PXA), grade 3 and BRAF wildtype. Although with better progno-
sis than specific gliomas, especially at young age, PXA frequently 
recurs. A high mitotic activity and necrosis have also been associ-
ated with worse prognosis. About 80% of PXAs harbour BRAF 
V600E mutation but this finding is not present in our case. How-
ever, the DNA methylome profile confirmed the diagnosis.
The patient has been submitted to radiotherapy, followed by 
chemotherapy, revealing a better clinical outcome.

One year of neuropathology during the pandemic - a review 
of central nervous system tumours diagnosed at the Bagdasar-
Arseni Hospital, Bucharest during 2021
D. Pasov*, C. Cocosila, M. Lisievici
*Bagdasar-Arseni Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: 2021 was another year straining the health-
care system in Romania, which was also reflected in the pathology 
field.
We have reviewed all the central nervous system (CNS) tumours 
diagnosed by our team throughout this year.
Methods: All tumour cases have been examined by light micros-
copy using the standard hematoxylin and eosin stain and diagnosed 
according to the WHO revised 4th edition classification (2016). 
Several of these tumours were examined during intraoperative con-
sultation as both frozen sections and squash/smear technique using 
the toluidine blue stain. For the sake of this study, traumatic and 
inflammatory lesions were excluded.
Results: A total of 749 CNS tumours were diagnosed by our 
department in 2021, consisting of 569 primary and 180 metastatic 
lesions. 605 tumours were located to the brain while 144 were 
spinal. Only 50 of the spinal tumours were primary. The most com-
mon brain tumours encountered were diffuse gliomas consisting 
of 158 cases, out of which 126 were diagnosed as glioblastomas. 
Other glioma types, as well as glioneuronal tumours were rare, 
consisting of 34 cases. Meningiomas of both brain and spine were 
more frequent accounting to 156 and 13 cases respectively. Pitui-
tary adenomas, embryonal tumours and schwannomas were also 
significantly encountered. 449 intraoperative consultations (frozen 
sections and squash/smear) were performed.
Conclusion: While tumour diversity encountered throughout the 
year is consistent with global epidemiology, a few variations were 
noticed. These were likely influenced by the temporary restric-
tions and availability of ICU beds during the pandemic waves. 
While surgery for metastatic lesions remained consistent, primary 
tumours, especially lower grade ones, were affected. A decrease 
of paediatric cases was also observed. About 60% of diagnosed 
tumours benefitted from intraoperative consultation.

Simple subependymal cyst derived from the floor of the third 
ventricle: a case report of an extremely rare midbrain location
N. Flaris, C. Gouta*, V. Tsitouras, P. Monioudis, I. Venizelos
*Department of Histopathology, Hippokration General Hospital 
of Thessaloniki, Greece
Background & objectives: Ependymal cysts are rare benign lesions 
that occur mostly in the lateral ventricles or less commonly into the 
subarachnoid space and the brain parenchyma. The third ventricle is 
a very rare location, let alone the midbrain and the periaqueduct area.
Methods: We report the case of a 3-year-old male who presented 
at the emergency department with symptoms of acute hydrocepha-
lus. Brain imaging tests revealed a dilation of the third and lateral 
ventricles and the patient underwent endoscopic brain surgery. A 
thin-wall, transparent cystic lesion was found to originate from 
the floor of the third ventricle obstructing the aqueduct of Sylvius.
Results: A part of the cystic wall of 0.5 cm in maximum length was 
biopsied and sent for pathological examination and immunohistochemical 
analysis. Microscopically the tissue was composed of multiple layers of a 
three-structured membrane. A thin aggregate of collagen fibres was lined on 
one side with a zone of glioependymal cells and on the other with a single 
stratum of flattened cells of unknown origin. Immunohistochemical markers 
S100 and vimentin were positive on both types of cells, while EMA, GFAP 
and CK7 were positive only on ependymal zone. General proliferation 
marker ki67 showed positivity for circa 3% of glial cells. Consequently, 
the diagnosis of a simple subependymal cyst was established.
Conclusion: To our knowledge, until now there have been reported only 
2 cases of midbrain ependymal cysts, both of which occurred in adult 
patients. Cysts recognized in the third ventricle are usually colloid rather 
than ependymal. Notably, there is a gap in literature with regards to detailed 
histological description and immunohistochemistry of benign ependymal 
lesions. Our case report contributes to medical knowledge presenting an 
extremely rare entity and posing questions about the cytological features, 
origin and type of lining cells involved.

Background & objectives: We investigated the expression and dis-
tribution of SOX-2-positive and CD133-positive cancer stem cells 
both in the enhancing nodule (EN) and in the FLAIR hyperintensity 
zones on a surgical, histopathological series of 33 glioblastomas 
(GBMs).
Methods: The inclusion criterion was the intraoperative sampling 
of different tumour regions by Neuronavigation and positivity to 
intraoperative 5-ALA fluorescence. 33 patients (20 males and 13 
females with a mean age at diagnosis of 56 years) met the inclusion 
criterion. A total of 109 histological samples were evaluated, 52 
for ENs and 57 for FLAIR hyperintensity zone.
Results: Considering the quantitative distribution of levels of 
intensity of staining (IS), ES (extent score) and immunoreactiv-
ity score (IRS), no difference was found between ENs and FLAIR 
regions for both the SOX-2 biomarker (respectively, IS p=0.851, 
ES p=0.561, IRS p=1.000) and the CD133 biomarker (IS p=0.653, 
ES p=0.409, IRS p=0.881).
Conclusion: This evidence suggests to recalibrate the target of 
surgery for FLAIRECTOMY and 5-ALA could improve the pos-
sibility to achieve this goal.

Frontal intraosseous leiomyoma: an unusual case in a 
15-months infant

Msakni, B. Laabidi
*Department of Pathology, Military Hospital of Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Leiomyomas are benign tumours arising from 
smooth muscle cells. Intraosseous occurrence of leiomyoma is extremely 
rare with less than 35 cases reported in the literature. Throught this case 
report, we aim to discuss clinicopathological aspects of this entity.
Methods: We present a case of frontal intraosseous leiomyoma 
(IL) occurring in a15-mounths infant.
Results: A 15-month-old female infant presented with an undwell-
ing lump on the forehead. Clinical examination revealed a well 
defined and firm swelling over the forehead. Plain radiography 
showed a well-defined osteolytic lesion. Histologically, the tumour 
was localized in the spongious bone. It was composed of moder-
ately cellular spindle cells arranged in orderly intersecting fasci-
cles, with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and elongated blunt 
ended “cigar-shaped” nuclei. The cellular atypia was inconspicu-
ous. No necrosis was found. There were one mitosis. Immunostain-
ing showed positivity for smooth muscle actin and Caldesmone. 
The Ki67 index was estimated at 4%. The diagnosis was consistent 
with an intraosseous leiomyoma. A surgical treatment was per-
formed with a wide margin’s excision.
Conclusion: IL are extremely rare tumours. To the best of our 
knowledge this is the first reported case occurring in the frontal 
bone. IL are more common in younger patients. The diagnosis of 
this tumour is challenging due to its extraordinarily rare incidence 
and the absence of pathognomonic radiological signs. It is mainly 
based on histopathologic examination and immunochemistry. Fur-
ther studies are needed to study the behaviour of these tumours and 
their reccurence rates.

nating from neuroepithelial cells. While these tumours mainly occur 
within the central nervous system (CNS), there are occasional reports 
in children and young adults with primary tumour occurrence outside 
of the CNS.
Methods: A 63-year-old man presented with a palpable soft tissue 
mass of 12mm of the sacrococcygeal region of several months of 
evolution. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 12mm mass. 
He underwent a surgery with histology revealing a myxopapillary 
tumour.
Results: Histology study showed a myxopapillary tumour. The 
tumour is composed of some papillary structures formed by vessels 
encircled by basophilic myxoid and collars of cuboidal tumour cells 
which demonstrate strong GFAP positivity and CKAe1-Ae3. The 
patient underwent surgery and postoperative magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) of pelvis taken four days after the surgery demon-
strating no evidence of residual tumour, recurrence or metastatic 
disease to the pelvis.
Conclusion: Reviewing the literature, we found that the mean 
patient age at the time of tumour symptomatic occurrence is 47 and 
the entire medullary conus was involved in 57,1% of the patients. 
Younger age, preoperative functional capacity, lesser initial neuro-
logical deficit, tumour location, size and the extent of resection as 
well as adjuvant radiotherapy were identified as significant factors 
influencing better outcome.

County Hospital, Constanta, Romania; CEDMOG, ”Ovidius” 
University of Constanta, Romania
Background & objectives: Astrocytoma IDH-mutant is a distinct 
neoplastic entity with different aggressive behaviors depending on the 
histopathological grade. This pathology remains a challenge for the 
pathologist, neurosurgeon and oncologist. We describe the character-
istics and an analysis of their aggression through ancillary studies.
Methods: We conducted a ten years retrospective descriptive 
study of patients diagnosed in our institution with grade 2, 3 or 
4 astrocytomas. Immunohistochemical and cytogenetic tests were 
performed to stratify the cases according to the IDH gene. The 
data were entered into SPSS Statistics where they were analysed 
according to demographic and diagnostic parameters, assessing 
tumour aggressiveness.
Results: We identified 59 cases, most of them were found in the 
fifth decade of life (30.51%), more common in males (52.54%). 
The most common histopathological grade was grade 4 (81.36%). 
Imaging examinations had an accuracy of 92%. The lesion had 
a diameter of more than 25 mm (88.14%). The average tumour 
volume was 80.48 mm3, producing displacements of the midline by 
an average of 8.69 mm. We noticed a higher average survival rate 
in females (6.5 months) compared to males. The main prognostic 
factors identified were: Ki-67 index (p<0.001), histopathological 
grade (p<0.001), age at diagnosis (p=0.040), presence of 
tumoral residue (p=0.037) and intensity of the IDH1 R132H 
immunoreaction (p=0.002).
Conclusion: We noticed that astrocytomas can appear at any 
age, not having a specific topography and despite the regional 
effects, the symptoms do not reveal the degree of aggression. 
Our study indicated the main negative prognostic factors that are 
associated with low life expectancy. Thus, the results of our study 
bring new, up-to-date data to the literature on the characteristics

K. Tlili, I. Msakni, B. Laabidi
*Department of Pathology, Military Hospital of Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Proliferative potential is an important 
criteria for meningioma grading. Phosphohistone-H3 has been 
suggested as a valid proliferative marker in many tumours. We aim 
to evaluate the efficiency of anti-PHH3 antibody as a grading tool for 
meningiomas.
Methods: A retrospective study on a series of 40 meningiomas 
diagnosed from March 2020 to April 2021 at the Pathology Depart-
ment of the Military Hospital of Tunis was performed. We com-
pared grade variability according to the mitotic count on H&E 
stained slides and on PHH3 stained slides.
Results: A highly significant correlation was found between mitotic 
count on PHH3 stained slides (PHH3-MI) and mitotic count on H&E 
stained slides (H&E-MI). PHH3-MI was higher than H&E-MI in 
47.5% cases. A significantly higher sensitivity in the PHH3 counting 
method was reported in our study. It resulted in an overall upgrading 
rate of 22,5%; six grade 1 meningiomas upgraded to grade 2, and two 
grade 2 cases upgraded to grade 3.
Conclusion: Our study findings, conforming to the literature, 
revealed that PHH3-MI is more reliable and accurate in mitotic 
figures counting in meningiomas than conventional MI. It 
exhibited a high sensitivity in tumour grading, reported by an 
upgrade within 22,5% of the cases. Therefore, it might be used 
as a reliable tool for meningiomas’ grading. Nonetheless, larger 
studies are obviously needed to obtain a definite conclusion on 
whether this method should replace the conventional H&E-based 
MI-method for meningioma grading.

A case of type 2 neurofibromatosis
M. Filip*, C. Socoliuc, A. Bastian, M. Craciun, D. Raduta, E. Ignat
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Type 2 neurofibromatosis (NF2) is an 
autosomal dominant syndrome that primarily affects the central and 
peripheral nervous system, characterized by neoplastic and hamartoma-
tous proliferations of Schwann cells, meningothelial cells, and glia.
Methods: We report a 27 years old female, showing multiple 
tumours in the posterior cranial fossa, having a history of multiple 
meningiomas and one ependymoma.
Clinically, the patient complained of vertigo, headache, balance disor-
ders, bilateral hearing loss. The clinico-radiological diagnosis of mul-
tiple intracranial meningiomas including one with petroclival location, 
and one with transverse sinus insertion has been established.
Results: Transverse sinus tumour was confirmed microscopically 
and immunohistochemically as a fibrous meningioma, and showed 
strong positivity for EMA, Vimentin and PR, with increased 
ki67 index (6% in hotspot), that can be associated with an 
aggressive biological behaviour. Petroclival tumour proved to be 
a Schwannoma, microscopically showing a biphasic pattern with 
Antoni A and Antoni B zones, immunohistochemically showing 
strong positivity for S100 and negativity for EMA, PR and BCL2. 
Given the previous and current morphopathological diagnoses of 
multiple meningiomas, an ependymoma and a schwannoma, the 
criteria (NIH / Manchester) for the classification of NF2 were met. 
Genetic testing and counselling for NF2 were recommended.
Conclusion: In patients with NF2 it was acknowledged an increased fre-
quency of high-grade meningiomas, making it important to distinguish 
between a meningioma and a schwannoma, the histology and immunohis-
tochemistry being useful tools when there is no family history.
The morbidity of NF2 patients is significant and the clinical mani-
festations can vary from progressive deafness due to vestibular 
schwannomas, other central nervous system deficits and craniospi-
nal neuropathies (including blindness) from multiple meningiomas. 
For these reasons, an accurate and early diagnosis is essential.

Supratentorial ependymoma, ZFTA fusion-positive: report of 
a new entity

Boudawara, S. Makni
*Department of Pathology, Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, 
Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: In the 5th edition (2021) of the WHO 
classification of CNS tumours (WHO CNS5), Ependymomas should be 
classified according to a combination of histopathological and molecu-
lar features as well as anatomic site (supratentorial, posterior fossa 
and spinal).
Methods: We present a case of supratentorial ependymoma (SE), ZFTA 
fusion-positive (SEZFTAF) to describe the clinicopathological features and 
molecular alterations of this rare new entity. A 5-year-old girl, with no medi-
cal background, was presented to neurosurgery department for seizure and 
a month-long history of headache and vomiting. On examination she was 
conscious and oriented to time and place.
Results: MRI demonstrated a right frontal solidocystic mass 
measuring 50x44x35mm. The tumour showed strong and 
inhomogeneous enhancement in their solid components after 
intravenous gadolinium injection. The patient underwent gross 
total resection of the lesion through right frontal craniotomy. On 
histological examination, the lesion was well demarcated from 
adjacent brain. It was composed of cells characterized mainly by 
round uniform nuclei with speckled chromatin and poorly defined 
fibrillary cytoplasm. Mitotic activity was significant with the 
presence of vascular proliferation and some necrotic changes. In 
immunohistochemical study, tumour cells were positive for GFAP 
and EMA. We noted a nuclear accumulation of p65 porotein. The 
tumour was graded 3 according to the WHO CNS5.
Conclusion: Most of the SE ZFTAFP tumours arise in the parietal or 
frontal lobe as in our case. These tumours affect primarily children. 
They Show varying degrees of anaplasia and have been regarded as 
WHO CNS5 grade 2 or 3 on this basis. The term “anaplastic epend-
ymoma” is no longer listed. SE ZFTAFP show nuclear accumulation of 
p65 protein and cytoplasmic expression of L1CAM. Immunoreactivity 
for p65 has been found to have a slightly higher specificity.

Background & objectives: Among tumours of the CNS, a combina-
tion of glioblastoma and a primitive neurodermal tumour in young 
people is extremely rare. Intravital diagnosis of this type of tumour is 
difficult due to the difference in clinical and morphological picture.
Methods: We present a case of a 38-year-old male with an intravi-
tal diagnosis of glioblastoma associated with a primitive neuroe-
ctodermal tumour of the brain. Due to the dimorphic structure of 
the tumour, the diagnosis was difficult, confirmed by histological 
and immunohistochemical studies at two independent hospitals. 
Despite treatment, the patient died. An autopsy with histological 
and immunohistochemical examinations was performed.
Results: An autopsy revealed flabby brain tissue in the focus of the 
removed tumour of the frontal lobe of the right hemisphere of the brain, 
as well as multiple metastases in the pia mater and cerebellum. The 
subependymal and paraventricular regions (including basal nuclei) was 
affected as well. There was also an oedematous pia mater of the spinal 
cord with a total lesion with massive compression of the spinal nerves.
Histologic examination of tumours showed high cellularity with 
a perivascular arrangement of polymorphic cells. The tumour has 
many vessels of various calibers, proliferation of thin-walled ves-
sels, areas of necrosis. There are more differentiated areas resem-
bling multiforme glioblastoma in structure.
Conclusion: This case reminds us that in the presence of clear clinical 
symptoms of one type of tumour, a mixed type of tumour of central 
nervous system should not be excluded, which may affect therapy.

FET-CREB fusion positive intracranial mesenchymal tumour: 
a case report
H.G. Terzioglu*, F. Soylemezoglu, B. Babaoglu
*Hacettepe University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Intracranial mesenchymal tumour with 
FET-CREB fusion, a provisional entity in the 2021 WHO blue book, 
is defined by gene fusions of the FET family of RNA binding proteins 
(EWSR1/FUS) to the CREB family of transcription factors (CREB1/
CREM/ATF1).
Methods: We present a 24-year-old male patient, who presented 
with headache, dizziness and dysarthria. MRI revealed cerebral 
oedema and 23 mm sized, contrast enhanced mass in the right 
parieto-occipital region. Patient underwent craniotomy and total 
excision of the mass was done. Tumour was diagnosed as angio-
matoid meningioma in another centre and brought our institution 
for a second opinion.
Results: On morphological assessment, tumour had a myxoid and 
oedematous stroma with vascular structures having hemangio-
pericytic pattern and focal chicken-wire appearance. Neoplastic 
cells have elongated nuclei with vesicular chromatin pattern and 
spindle shaped cytoplasm. Cytological atypia and necrosis were 
absent. Mitosis was counted as 2/10 HPF. Immunohistochemically, 
tumour cells were diffusely positive with EMA, desmin, GLUT1 
and focally positive with CD99; while negative with GFAP, STAT6, 
MUC4, CD34, synaptophysin and S100. Fluorescence in-situ 
hybridization was performed, revealing EWSR1 rearrangement. 
These findings suggested the diagnosis of intracranial mesenchy-
mal tumour, FET-CREB fusion positive.
Conclusion: Here we presented EWSR1 rearranged, intracranial 
myxoid mesenchymal tumour, compatible with this diagnosis. 
Intracranial mesenchymal tumours with FET-CREB fusions, 
previously described as intracranial angiomatoid fibrous 
histiocytoma and intracranial myxoid mesenchymal tumour 
(IMMT), are a newly described group of tumours and mostly seen 
in paediatric patients and young adults. They are characterized by 
fusion of a FET family gene (EWSR1/FUS) to the CREB family 
of transcription factors (CREB1/CREM/ATF1). Clinical course, 
morphological features and genomic landscape is still unclear.

Chaari, S. Charfi, T. Boudawara, R. Kallel
*Department of Pathology, Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, 
Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The most common primary tumours of 
brain metastasis (BM) are lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, 
colorectal and renal cancer. BM of exceptional origin (BMEO) are 
poorly documented. In this study, we aim to report our experience 
about BMEO.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study of BM diagnosed at 
our department over a period of 10 years (January 2010-December 
2019). BM of pulmonary, colonic, mammary, renal and melanic 
origin were excluded. At all, 27 cases of BMEO were included in 
our study.
Results: The median age of patients was 54 years. The study 
included 21 men and 8 women. Lesions were solitary in 15 cases 
and multiple in 12 cases. Tumours were located in the supratento-
rial region in 13 cases. A history of a previously known cancer 
was found in 25 cases. Eleven patients underwent surgical resec-
tion. The most common primary sites of BM were thyroid and 
prostate (four cases each), followed by bladder, ovary and bone 
(Three cases each) and testis and buccal mucosa (Two cases each). 
The other primary sites were oesophagus, pancreas, upper urinary 
tract urothelial, mediastinum, adrenal gland and palatine tonsil (one 
case each).
Conclusion: Despite advances in imaging methods, there are no 
pathognomonic features that distinguish BM from primary malig-
nant brain tumours or nonneoplastic conditions. Therefore the 
standard of diagnosis of BM remains pathological examination. 
Immunohistochemical and molecular analysis are helpful to make 
appropriate diagnosis. Correlation of histological findings with 
clinical and imaging results is necessary.

*Clinical Neuropathology, King’s College Hospital, United 
Kingdom
Background & objectives: PATZ1-fusion is a rare molecular event 
among central nervous system neoplasms, which have recently been 
reported in a subset of glial/glioneuronal tumours mainly affecting 
young patients. Hereby, we present two cases of MN1-PATZ1 
rearranged neuroepithelial tumours with different clinicopathological 
characteristics.
Methods: A retrospective departmental study investigating 931 
paediatric and young adult neuroepithelial tumours identified 
two previously unclassified gliomas harbouring MN1-PATZ1 
fusion, confirmed by multimodal panel and methylation profil-
ing (DKFZ, Brain tumour methylation classifier v12.5).
Results: A 24-year-old woman (Case 1) presented with a 
contrast-enhancing left frontal mass. Histology showed a

hypercellular glioma with brisk mitotic activity, palisading 
necrosis and microvascular proliferation. Case 2 was located in 
the parietal lobe and presented with seizures in a 10-year-old 
boy. The tumour was well-demarcated and displayed bizarre-
looking giant cells and perivascular pseudorosettes. Mitotic 
figures were scarce but glomeruloid vessels were noted. Focal 
astroblastomatous features and abundant eosinophilic granular 
bodies were seen in both cases. Both patients underwent 
macroscopic resection and chemo-radiotherapy. In Case 1, the 
tumour recurred in 9 months, and the patient died 14 months 
after first admission. Case 2 is tumour-free after 23 months of 
follow-up.
Conclusion: Neuroepithelial tumour, PATZ1-fusion is a molec-
ularly defined provisional CNS tumour type which might be 
under-recognised due to its broad morphological spectrum and 
inconclusive immunoprofile. The biological behaviour of this 
tumour is yet poorly understood ranging from very aggressive 
clinical behaviour (Case 1) to more stable diseases with a risk 
of late recurrence (Case 2).

Belhadj, I. Chelly, H. Azouz, K. Bellil, S. Haouet
*Department of Pathology, La Rabta Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Calcifying pseudo neoplasm of the neu-
raxis (CAPNON) is a rare, fibro-osseous lesion that can occur any-
where in the central nervous system with 150 reported cases. It’s exclu-
sively diagnosed by pathological examination. We describe a case of 
CAPNON mimicking an oligodendroglioma
Methods: A 56 -year-old female presented with 2 years 
history of recurrent holocranial headache and dizziness 
which have worsened in the preceding month. Physical and 
neurological examinations revealed no obvious abnormalities. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a 
complex calcified and cystic mass, measuring 40x32 mm in 
size, in the right frontal lobe. An oligodendroglioma was 
suspected.
Results: Frontal craniotomy was performed and the entire mass was 
excised. Grossly, the 2.5-cm-sized lesion was a homogeneous, calcified 
mass without identifiable compartments. Histologically, the lesion 
consisted of glial tissue containing amorphous lamellar calcification 
with myxoid matrix in the background. The calcifications had 
concentric circular structure. In some places, osseous metaplasia was 
present. Around the lesion, peripheral palisading spindle to epithelioid 
cells was noted. Final diagnose is Calcifying pseudo neoplasm of the 
neuraxis. At follow up 1 year later, the patient was in a good condition 
and reported no discomfort.
Conclusion: Calcifying pseudo neoplasm of the neuraxis is 
a rare, slow growing benign lesion that should be included in 
the differential diagnosis of intracranial calcified lesions to 
avoid improper treatment. This entity mimics many calcifying 
intra-axial lesions as ganglioglioma, oligodendroglioma, and 
infections like tuberculosis.

When the biomarkers decrease and the tumour increases: a 
case of intracranial growing teratoma syndrome
F. Ramalhosa*, I. Luz, A. Carvalho, J.G. Soares, O. Rebelo
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Centro Hospitalar e Universi-
tário de Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Growing teratoma syndrome(GTS) is a rare 
clinical entity, which has been diagnosed in patients with intracranial 
germ cell tumour(GCT) who present a paradoxical enlarging of the 
original tumour despite the normalization of tumour markers during 
or after appropriate systemic chemotherapy.
Methods: A 17-years-old male was admitted to Neurosurgery Depart-
ment, after a diagnosis of an intracranial space-occupying lesion, made 
during the study of 5-month-long polydipsia and polyuria and diplopia. 
On MRI, the mass was well-demarcated, midline, involving the pineal 
area. Laboratory studies revealed elevated alpha-fetoprotein and beta-
human chorionic gonadotropin, in the cerebral spinal fluid and blood. 
Ventriculoendoscopy and biopsy were performed.
Results: The biopsy was a fragment of 0.5 cm that showed the presence of a 
germinoma, constituted by a poorly cohesive tumour of round medium-size 
cells, with positive immunostaining for C-Kit and OCT4. Three cycles of 
systemic chemotherapy were given (cisplatin, ifosfamide, etoposide). The 
tumour markers normalized, however the GCT had a volumetric enhance-
ment. The patient underwent an occipital craniotomy for resection of the 
pineal tumour. Macroscopically, the tumour measured 3.0x2.0x1.5 cm and 
the histopathologic study revealed the presence of mature teratoma, com-
posed of cysts lined by respiratory epithelium and mature neural tissue. 
Surprisingly, a foci of 0.3 cm of germinoma was found, with the same 
histological features described previously.
Conclusion: The uncommon enlarging residual masses after treat-
ment of intracranial GCT despite the concurrent normalization of 
tumour markers should warn for a possible GTS. GCT containing 
immature teratoma appears to be associated with a higher risk of 
developing GTS, once the chemotherapy induces the transforma-
tion of immature cells into mature teratoma.

WHO 2021 histopathological grading of atypical and anaplastic 
meningiomas
I. Guzelis*, F. Cakalagaoglu, I.E. Sevin, B.B. Yenen
*Izmir Katip Celebi University, Turkey
Background & objectives: As the WHO Central Nervous System was 
published in 2021, changes had been done in the grading of menin-
giomas. In this study, we aimed to grade the atypical and anaplastic 
meningiomas and evaluate the prognostic value of histopathological 
parameters.
Methods: Out of 316 patients diagnosed with meningioma, forty-
three cases were diagnosed as atypical or anaplastic meningioma. 
All the slides of the cases were re-evaluated by a senior pathologist 
and a pathology resident for the grading parameters. Other than 
4 patients that passed away perioperatively all the patients were 
followed up and the mean follow-up period was 42.8±33 months.
Results: According to the new WHO grading system, 40 of the 
cases (95%) were graded as 2, and two cases were graded as 3. The 
special morphological meningioma subtypes were associated with 
spontaneous necrosis, higher mitosis, and the absence of prominent 
nucleoli (P=0.01, P=0.02, P=0.04). Small cells feature was associ-
ated with mitosis criteria and no brain invasion (P=0.04, P=0.02). 
Spontaneous necrosis was correlated with higher mitosis (P=0.02). 
As no significance was found between histopathological grading 
parameters and recurrence-free (RFS) or overall survival (OS), in 
the subgroup of brain invasive meningiomas increased cellularity 
showed a better RFS (P=0.021). Spontaneous necrosis in brain 
invasive meningiomas worsened OS (P=0.049).
Conclusion: In grade 2 and 3 meningiomas, as brain invasion and 
increased cellularity were the commonest and favourable findings, 
this study suggests that the spontaneous necrosis feature has an 
important prognostic significance in the brain invasive subgroup. 
While none of the histopathological parameters made a greater

Low-grade glioneuronal tumour with neuropil-like islands and 
FGFR1 mutation, a case report
A. Maswadeh, H. Sultan, B. Maraqa, M. Al-Hussaini*
*King Hussien Cancer Center, Jordan
Background & objectives: Glioneuronal tumour with neuropil-like 
islands (GNTI) is a rare tumour entity that is described mainly in adults 
with very few cases reported in pediatrics that are molecularly tested.
Methods: An 8-year-old female presented initially in 2016, 
at the age of 1-year, with seizures and was found to have a left 
frontal mass, for which she underwent craniotomy. In 2018, she 
presented with recurrence and in 2021 she presented with a second 
recurrence. No chemotherapy or radiotherapy was administered.
Results: A review of the original pathology material as well as of 
the first and second recurrence shows similar features. There is 
proliferation of monotonous round cells with clear cytoplasm, sepa-
rated focally by fine vasculature and in other foci by proliferating 
vessels, with occasional mitotic figures. These foci are positive pri-
marily for GFAP. Other foci show islands of neuropil surrounded 
by cells with clear cytoplasm that stained for Synaptophysin and 
focally for NeuN. The final diagnosis was a low-grade glioneuronal 
tumour with neuropil-like islands.
Examination by Nanostring confirmed the presence of FGFR1 
tyrosine kinase domain duplication (TKDD).
Conclusion: FGFR1 TKDD is known to be implicated in paediatric 
low-grade glioneuronal tumours, including DNET. Glioneuronal 
tumour with neuropil-like islands is another morphological varia-
tion along the spectrum of tumours characterized by FGFR1 muta-
tions. This has important implications for confirmation of the diag-
nosis as well as being predictive of response to FGFR inhibitors.

Dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum (Lhermitte-Duclos 
disease): a rare case report
Z. Lajmi*, A. Bdioui, M. Krifa, W. Majdoub, A. Baccouche, S. 
Hmissa
*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebel-
lum (DFG), also called Lhermitte-Duclos Disease, is a rare lesion of 
the posterior fossa consisting of a diffuse hypertrophy of the cerebellar 
cortex. It is one of neuronal and mixed neuronal-glial tumour, WHO 
grade I disease.
Methods: A 26-year-old man, with no history, consulted for a pro-
gressive vertigo and headache, with nausea and vomiting for 7 
days. During the physical examination, the vital signs were stable. 
The patient displayed ataxia with wide-based gait. No nystagmus. 
Brain MRI showed an intra-parenchymal lesion of the left cerebel-
lum, isointense on T1- and T2-weighted sequences. No prominent 
enhancement.
Results: Surgical resection was proposed because of size, the unde-
termined nature of the lesion and the supposed impact on expansion 
of the cerebellum. The patient underwent tumour resection. The 
histopathological examination showed an abnormal architecture of 
the cerebellar cortex: dysplastic Purkinje cells were present in the 
granular layer and in the underlying white matter. The molecular 
layer was replaced by larges axon bundles. No mitosis or necrosis 
was be seen. Ectatic vessels and calcifications were present. Ki67 
was inferior to 1%. In immunohistochemistry, dysplastic cells were 
synaptophysin and GFAP positive. The diagnosis of a dysplastic 
gangliocytoma of the cerebellum was confirmed.
Conclusion: DGC is a rare and benign brain tumour. It has both 
neoplastic and hamartomatous characteristics. It frequently pre-
sents in young adults. The pre-operative diagnosis proves to 
be a challenge. On MR, Tiger-strip sign is characteristic but is 
not always seen. The prognosis is good if total resection can be 
achieved. Further molecular examinations of PTEN gene mutation 
is recommended. Adult-onset of DGC is considered to be a pathog-
nomonic criteria of Cowden syndrome characterised by mutation 
of PTEN gene.

*Department of Pathology, La Rabta Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Liponeurocytomas are rare and slow-
growing tumours located predominantly in the cerebellum. Our aim 
is to present a new case of liponeurocytoma and describe its epide-
miological, clinical and pathological features, as well as management 
strategies.
Methods: We describe a new case of liponeurocytoma diagnosed 
in the Rabta hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.
Results: We report the case of a 38-year-old woman without par-
ticular pathological antecedent with a few months history of head-
ache and dizziness, aggravated since 2 days by signs of increased 
intracranial pressure and cerebellar dysfunction. The Computerized 
Tomography practiced in emergency showed a subtentorial space 
occupying mass, heterogeneous, exhibiting the attenuation values 
of fatty tissue, with hydrocephalous upstream. The patient has been 
operated. The histopathological and immunohistochemical studies 
concluded a cerebellar liponeurocytoma.
Conclusion: Cerebellar liponeurocytoma is a rare neoplasm with 
distinctive morphologic features. It typically involves the cerebellar 
hemispheres of middle-aged to older adults. The tumour is com-
posed of a uniform population of neurocytic cells possessing round 
to oval nuclei and pale to clear cytoplasm. A variable degree of 
lipidization of the tumour cells is present, lending a resemblance 
to mature adipose tissue.

*Hospital Sant Joan de Déu, Spain
Background & objectives: High-grade astrocytoma with piloid fea-
tures (HGAP) is an uncommon new tumour entity of the central nerv-
ous system, extremely rare in paediatric population. Characterized by 
distinct DNA methylation profile, CDKN2A/B deletion, MAPK path-
way alterations and ATRX mutation and/or loss of expression.
Methods: We describe the case of a 7-year-old boy with no rel-
evant medical history, admitted in our hospital due to a raised 
intracranial pressure, secondary to hydrocephalous. Cerebral 
magnetic resonance imaging revealed a hypothalamic-optical

well-circumscribed solid/cystic tumour, with peduncle invasion and 
normal extension studies. An endoscopic surgical cyst fenestration 
and Monroe liberation was performed, together with an endoscopic 
biopsy for diagnosis.
Results: Paraffin sections stained with haematoxylin-eosin dem-
onstrated a moderately cell-dense neoplasm with piloid astrocytic 
histological features presenting Rosenthal fibres. Vascular hyper-
trophy with glomeruloid proliferation and high mitotic activity (9 
mitosis/10 HPF), were observed. Immunohistochemistry revealed 
loss of ATRX expression in 90% of neoplastic cells with positive 
staining for Olig2, PGFA and H3K27me3, and negative staining 
for LIN-28A, H3K27M, p53 and IDH1, with a ki67 proliferation 
index of 30%.
The methylation class was of diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal 
tumour (DLGNT) with a concordance score of 0.57. For further 
analysis, next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed, 
demonstrating ATRX mutation; CDKN2A/B deletion, codeletion 
of 1p/19q; and absence of KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, BRAFV600E 
and IDH mutation.
Conclusion: Histopathological features of high-grade astrocytoma 
with loss of nuclear ATRX expression, suggested HGAP. Consid-
ering the low score value of DLGNT methylation class and the 
close molecular segregation described in both entities, we extend 
the study through NGS. This approach enabled us to confirm the 
presence of a mutation in ATRX and the deletion of CDKN2A/B, 
endorsing the diagnosis of HGAP. We believe that integrated his-
tologic and molecular analysis is essential to enable accurate diag-
nosis of this rare brain tumour.

Pseudoglandular hyperplasia of the conjunctiva: report of 
a rare entity
S. Graja*, S. Ben Tekaya, M. Rekik, O. Boudawara, M. Mellouli, 
A. Trigui, T. Boudawara, R. Kallel
*Department of Pathology, Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, 
Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Pseudoglandular hyperplasia of the con-
junctiva (PHC) is a rare benign pseudo tumoral lesion which arises 
preferentially in conjunctiva fornix and/or tarsal. We report here a new 
case of this rare entity, review its histopathological features and discuss 
its differential diagnoses.
Methods: The morphologic findings of PHC of the right eye 
occurring in a 65-year-old man were reported with a review of 
the related literature.
Results: The patient consulted for a swollen pediculated conjunctiva 
mass. MRI revealed a well-limited hypervascular nodule, in the 
right upper palpebral conjunctiva, measuring 12 x 10 x 13 mm. 
Surgical excision was performed. On microscopic examination, the 
specimen received was covered with a regular stratified squamous 
epithelium containing numerous goblet cells. The epithelium realized 
invagination into the stroma with formation of pseudoglandular or 
pseudoadenomatous structures of various sizes. The surrounding 
stroma contained inflammatory cells with blood vessels. The lesion 
was focally ulcerated. There was neither nuclear atypia nor mitosis. 
The diagnosis of PHC was retained.
Conclusion: PHC has distinctive histological features. It is 
defined as a proliferation of the conjunctival epithelium with 
prominent glandular structures. Clinical presentation and 
radiological features are not specific. Diagnosis is based on 
pathology analysis. PHC has good prognosis. Awareness of 
this entity is crucial to distinguish it from well-differentiated 
adenosquamous carcinoma to ensure the appropriate treatment. 
The absence of an infiltrative growth pattern and cytologic atypia 
with mitoses lead for PHC diagnosis.

Spindle cell haemangioma, an unusual presentation
C.İ. Başsorgun, A. Yavuz*, M.Y. Çelik, Z. Bayramoglu, B. Unal, 
E.B. Türkoğlu Şen, G.O. Elpek
*Akdeniz University Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Spindle cell haemangioma (SCH) is a benign 
vascular tumour that occurs in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue of the 
hands and feet of young adults. SHC is occasionally associated with Maf-
fucci syndrome, Ollier disease, and Klippel–Trenaunay syndrome.
Methods: An 18-year-old male patient presented with a mass 
near the lacrimal gland in the left orbital region. Magnetic reso-
nance imaging revealed a 7x13 mm nonspecific mass lesion in 
the left lacrimal gland localization with contrast enhancement. 
An excisional biopsy was performed from the masses in the left 
orbital region and sent to pathology.
Results: Gross examination of the surgical specimen showed the 
1.5x1.4x1 cm haemorrhagic lesion. Microscopic examination 
revealed two different components, thin-walled, large cavernous 
spaces and spindle epithelioid endothelial cells. There were 1-2 
mitotic figures per 10 high-power field. Cellular atypia, atypical 
mitosis, necrosis, and pleomorphism were not observed. Immuno-
histochemical examination revealed a positive reaction with CD31 
and CD34 in cells lining the vascular spaces.
Conclusion: The case was diagnosed as SCH. SCH is very unusual 
tumour in the orbital region. SCH should be considered as one of 
the differential diagnosis in vascular tumours of the orbit. Therefore, 
immunohistochemical examination should be performed to differenti-
ate it from tumours such as orbital cavernous venous malformations, 
Kaposi’s sarcoma, angiosarcoma and epithelioid haemangioma.

Slide-free imaging of fresh bulk H&E-stained tissue using mul-
tiphoton microscopy
M. Strauch*, J.P. Kolb, C. Rose, N. Merg, J. Hundt, C. Kümpers, 
S. Perner, S. Karpf, R. Huber
*Medical Laser Center Lübeck, Germany
Background & objectives: Frozen sectioning is the gold standard 
for intraoperative histopathological examinations. We propose a 
laser-based microscopy technique to image bulk tissue directly in the 
operating theatre without having to freeze or section the tissue.
Methods: We develop a laser-based multiphoton microscope 
intended for the special working conditions in the operating theatre. 
The feasibility of the microscopy system is evaluated using bulk 
porcine tissue samples which are stained with haematoxylin and 
eosin (H&E). The fresh bulk tissue is stained using a 6-7min 
H&E quick staining protocol and directly investigated under the 
microscope.
Results: We obtain images of bulk unsectioned H&E-stained tissue 
within 15min. The laser microscopy technique evaluates the mor-
phological structure at or slightly below the surface of the tissue. 
The H&E distributions in the tissue are recorded separately and can 
therefore also be evaluated individually. The images are inherently 
digital and can be analysed remotely by a pathologist and prevent 
delays due to sample transport to the pathology lab.

The images are compared to both formalin-fixed paraffin-embed-
ded and frozen sections of the same organ and the speed of the 
measurement is evaluated.
Conclusion: Our self-built multiphoton microscope can create 
H&E images of fresh bulk tissue without freezing or sectioning. A 
quick staining protocol has been developed to achieve a competitive 
imaging speed. The technique offers a fast alternative to the frozen 
section workflow avoiding delays by transporting the tissue to 
the pathology lab. We will start a clinical study on basal-cell 
carcinoma to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and try analysing 
our digital image data by modern AI algorithms in the future.

Three-dimensional observations of metastatic cancer cells in 
body fluids using label-free optical diffraction tomography
U. Jo*, J. Jeong, T. Kim, T. Kim, M. Kim, S.J. Jang, J.S. Song, 
C. Pack
*Department of Pathology/Asan Medical Center, Republic of 
Korea
Background & objectives: Label-free optical diffraction tomogra-
phy (ODT) can overcome the limitation off conventional cell imaging 
technologies. Rapid diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma in body fluids 
is necessary for deciding a stage. We evaluated the metastatic cancer 
cells using ODT as a diagnostic tool.
Methods: Two kinds of primary cultured cells of pulmonary 
adenocarcinoma and gastric adenocarcinoma were used as control 
group and ten body fluid samples containing metastatic carcinomas, 
such as pleural fluid and ascites were used as experimental group. 
Reconstruction of a three-dimensional (3D) refractive index 
(RI) map using ODT. Tumour volume and three dimensional 
morphology were observed through 3D optical method.
Results: All cancer cells presented prominent nucleoli, less 
cytoplasm, and mostly uniformed nucleus. The average volume of 
the gastric adenocarcinoma cells and pulmonary adenocarcinoma 
cells was 5169.3um3 and 3939.3um3, respectively. The surface of 
the cells was varied and it was generally uneven accompanying 
process or blebs rather than smooth.
Conclusion: There is no study comparing cancer cell cyto-mor-
phology using ODT so far. Since there is no staining process after 
obtaining the body fluid, rapid identification and confirmation of 
metastatic cancer cells may be possible through body fluids from 
the patients’ bed side.

Modifying bioeffects of posturan incorporation
Z. Vorontsova, S. Selyavin, E. Kudaeva, A. Filin*
*Voronezh State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: The long-term bioeffects of depleted ura-
nium after incorporation are of considerable interest from the stand-
point of its endogenous effects and in order to identify the reactivity 
of target organs.
Methods: Fragments of biopsy material of the parotid gland and 
jejunum from 135 mature male rats were used. Reactions to dehy-
drogenases were carried out on cryostatic sections of the parotid 
gland. Intraepithelial lymphocytes and mucosal barrier were 
detected on paraffin sections of the jejunum stained with hema-
toxylin and alcyan blue.
Results: Three and six months after a single incorporation of 
depleted uranium in the parotid gland, a prolonged bioeffect of 
changes in the light-optical density of dehydrogenases was noted. 
In acinuses, the indicators were significantly higher than the con-
trol ones. There were no differences from the control in the striated 
excretory ducts. However, there was a significant increase in their 
extent, stating atypical regeneration and an increase in the viscos-
ity of the secretion. Destructive changes of acinuses are noted. 
The dynamism and depth of penetration of lymphocytes into the 
jejunum epithelium determined the specificity of the microenvi-
ronment for antigen recognition and correlated with severity of the 
barrier properties of mucin gel.
Conclusion: The results of the study have identified a pathoge-
netically significant role in the realization of depleted uranium 
bioeffects. Persistent changes in the parotid gland were a reflec-
tion of a violation of the formation and excretion of secretions, 
suggesting a change in the microflora in the oral cavity, and an 
increase in the density of the mucosal barrier in the jejunum. The 
multidirectional nature of the changes revealed a prolonged pattern 
of reactions characterizing the cumulative radiotoxic bioeffect of 
depleted uranium.

Conceptions of learning factors in undergraduate medical stu-
dents. Teaching directed by threshold concepts
M.J. Gálvez Medina*, F. Leiva-Cepas, I. Cantarero Carmona, A. 
Sanz Zorrilla, R. Ortega Salas
*Servicio de Anatomía Patológica. Hospital Universitario Reina 
Sofía, Spain
Background & objectives: Students’ cognitive perceptions (SCP) are 
considered important variables for high-quality learning. In this study, 
SCP were used to identify histopathological threshold concepts (TC) in 
medical curricula. The objective is to analyse the perception of medical 
students’ about TC in Pathology.
Methods: A questionnaire was developed and validated to char-
acterize SCP of CT in pathology. A sample of 180 medical stu-
dents’ participated in the study. Different items were evaluated by 
means of a Likert-type scale (1-5) on their consideration of each 
CT in pathology. Statistical analysis was performed (Student’s t 
test) comparing the values by gender and the differences between 
different sections.
Results: The result of questionnaires related to morphostructural 
TCs was very distributed in the interval from 1 to 5, being the mean 
value 3.2/5. CT related to two-dimensional microscopic identifica-
tion were scored 4.2/5. Additionally, students identified CT related 
to the general histogenesis of neoplasms as critical to understand-
ing and learning in pathology.
Conclusion: The identification of threshold concepts through stu-
dents’ perceptions is potentially useful to improve the teaching 
and learning process in health sciences curricula. The differences 
observed must be taken into account in the organization in the 
teaching programming of the Pathology subject and in the entire 
Medicine degree, to guarantee an autonomous learning process 
based on specific competencies.

teaching. To know the degree of satisfaction and the usefulness of an 
innovative practice in a non-medical subject in collaboration with a 
Pathology Unit.
Methods: 48 students carried out a practical activity of viewing digi-
tized human biopsies. Students observe biopsy images of a pathol-
ogy according to its cellular alteration and corresponding pathology 
was selected. On each image, they identified the tissue/organ, the 
"residual" histological structures and their alterations. This activity 
was evaluated by an anonymous survey on a Likert scale (0-5).
Results: The survey was answered voluntarily by 85.48% of the 
students enrolled in the subject, of which 24 were women (58.5%), 
16 men (2.4%) and 1 person without assigned gender (2.4%). The 
responses were grouped into 3 blocks: 1) evaluation of the method-
ology used with a mean score of 4.31; 2) usefulness of the activity, 
which obtained a mean score of 4.41; 3) general evaluation of the 
innovative teaching practice where 53.6% (22) had an excellent 
opinion of it, 43.9% (18) acceptable and 2.5% (1) fair.
Conclusion: The interpretation of histopathological images has been 
a teaching innovation highly valued by the students. The teaching 
strategies must be implemented in different subjects of the study plans 
to promote an adequate interaction between health and non-health 
professionals as a projection to a more transversal university teaching.

Belkacem, S. Mestiri, S. Hmissa
*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare. Syn-
chronous MBC with other types of cancers is exceptional. We report a 
case of male synchronous breast and renal carcinoma, and we highlight 
the clinicopathological features of this rare association.
Methods: A 60-year-old male smoking patient followed for mental 
retardation complained of a left breast mass. On questioning, he did 
not report any other urinary-associated symptoms.
Results: A breast biopsy concluded to an invasive breast carcinoma. Thora-
coabdominal computed tomography showed bilateral pulmonary micro-
nodules and a mass of the left kidney measuring 7cm x 6,8cm, containing 
heterogeneous enhancement calcifications. The patient underwent breast 
radical surgery with axillary lymph node dissection and postoperative stag-
ing was T4b N1. Thus the patient was referred to the urologic department 
for renal surgery before adjuvant chemotherapy for the breast cancer. A 
left nephrectomy was done. The pathological examination concluded to 
papillary renal cell carcinoma type 1 with nuclear grade 2 and absence of 
associated breast carcinoma contingent. The patient underwent adjuvant 
chemotherapy for the breast cancer with regular follow-up.
Conclusion: Synchronous tumours with MBC are rare and to our 
knowledge, this is the first case reporting synchronous MBC with kid-
ney tumour. Few studies reported the tendency of papillary renal cell 
carcinoma subtype to be associated with multiple neoplasias. Therefore 
our case enriches the data to perspective studies of synchronous can-
cers associated with certain histologic subtypes and could be a clue to 
detect cancers most frequently associated with certain histologic types.

Zakhama
*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, 
Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Nephroblastoma associated with nephro-
blastomatosis is a rare embryonal renal disease with a high incidence 
in children under 5 year-old. Nephroblastomatosis is regarded as pre-
cursor lesion of nephroblastoma. The aim of our study is to recall the 
anatomo-clinical features .
Methods: A total of six cases of nephroblastoma associated with 
nephroblastomatosis diagnosed at the Department of Pathology of 
University Hospital in Monastir and treated in the Pediatric Sur-
gery Department of University Hospital in Monastir , over a period 
of 25 years (from 1995 to 2020). A review of clinical, paraclinical, 
pathological and evolutionary data was performed in all cases.
Results: These were 4 female and 2 male, with an average age 
of 40 months. The average diagnosis time was 2.35 months. The 
main clinical presentation was abdominal mass. Four cases were 
limited to the kidney and two had pulmonary metastasis. The 
treatment was multidisciplinary combining pre-operative CT, 
surgery and post-operative CT according to SIOP. The pathological 
examination showed two tumours classified as stage I, one as 
stage II, one as stage IV and two as stage V. Three cases were 
classified as intermediate risk, one as high risk and two cases 
associated intermediate and high risk. The evolution of patients 
was favourable in 5 cases. One patient was dead.
Conclusion: Nephroblastomatosis is defined by the presence of 
multiple or diffuse nephrogenic remains, regarded as precursor’s 
nephroblastoma It is a rare disease with a diagnosis based on 
histological examination. This entity is caracterized by a high 
recurrence frequency. Long-term follow up is needed. However, the 
prognostic of nephroblastoma associated with nephroblastomatosis 
is still favourable.

Multifocal Epstein-Barr virus-associated smooth muscle 
tumour in an immunosuppressed child with a transplanted liver
N. Chia*, D.W.Q. Lian
*Department of Pathology, National University Hospital, Singapore
Background & objectives: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is widely known 
to be associated with lymphoproliferative diseases in the setting of 
post-transplant immunosuppression. Rarely, EBV can also promote 
smooth muscle proliferation, resulting in an EBV-associated smooth 
muscle tumour (SMT), a rare and under-recognised clinicopathologi-
cal entity.
Methods: A 2-year-old girl from Brunei with a history of liver 
transplant for biliary atresia, presented with stridor, dyspnoea, and 
subsequent partial focal seizures. Computed tomography showed 
a 3.9 cm right paratracheal mass with occlusion of the right main 
bronchus, bilateral lung masses and a 7.9 cm brain mass occupying 
both cerebrum. The brain and right paratracheal masses were 
biopsied.
Results: The biopsies showed spindle cell lesions arranged in 
intersecting long fascicles and a focal sheet-like area of primitive 
round cells. The spindle cells contained cigar-shaped nuclei with 
dense eosinophilic cytoplasm while the primitive round cells had 
high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, round hyperchromatic nuclei 
and scant cytoplasm. The nuclear atypia was mild and there was 
nuclear monomorphism. A staghorn-like vascular pattern was 
seen. This was initially diagnosed as a synovial sarcoma at the 
primary institution’s laboratory. However, further work up showed 
the spindle cells (not round cells) were positive for desmin and

h-caldesmon. EBER-ISH was positive in both components and 
EBV-SMT was diagnosed. Immunosuppressants were withdrawn 
and the masses were surgically debulked.
Conclusion: EBV-SMT is rare in children with solid organ 
transplant. The differential diagnoses were spindle cell 
rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma and solitary fibrous tumour. 
The myoid nature of the spindle cells, the second population of 
primitive round cells and the clinical history were helpful to 
prompt investigations for EBV. It can be diagnostically challenging 
if only the primitive round cell component is sampled, and it should 
be considered in the work up for small round blue cell tumours in 
immunosuppressed children.

Tuberous sclerosis complex: case report and literature review
M. Garcia Martos*, C.M. Vieru, Y. Gómez Navarro
*Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Spain
Background & objectives: Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a 
rare autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder that is characterized by 
cellular and tissue dysplasia in several organs. The clinical manifesta-
tions are result of a mutation of one of two suppressor genes TSC1 
and TSC2.
Methods: We present a 34 weeks foetus with multiples cardiac 
rhabdomyomas found in the 33rd week ultrasound routine. 
Consequently, a foetal nuclear magnetic resonance was conducted, 
showing brain surface, subependymal nodules in thalamus-striated 
sulcus, cortical tubers and linear lesions in deep white matter. The 
case met three major criteria for sclerosis tuberous and concluded 
with the pregnancy’s termination.
Results: The autopsy results revealed subependymal lesions com-
posed of vacuolated cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, 
and few binucleated and dyscrete atypia. Moreover, pseudonodular 
agrupations of dysmorphic neuronal cells were found in the sub-
cortical cortex. The heart presented small tumour nodules in both 
ventricles, formed histologically of large polygonal cells with gly-
cogen vacuoles, central nucleus and cross striations of cytoplasm 
radiating from the nucleus to the cell membrane. These findings led 
to diagnosing subependymal giant cell neoplasia, cortical tubers, 
cardiac rhabdomyoma and multiple renal cysts, compatible with the 
clinical diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis. In consequence, a genetic 
study was performed and detected a TSC2 mutation, c22251 C>T, 
p- Arg751*.
Conclusion: TSC is an uncommon syndrome characterized by 
formation of hamartomas in multiple organs, which incidence has 
been estimated in 1/6000-1/10000 newborns annually. It presents a 
wide range of clinical and phenotypic manifestations with varying 
severity. The brain, heart and kidney are commonly involved in 
this syndrome. Most of cases, are caused by a de novo mutation or 
are the effect of parental gonadal mosaicism. A thorough clinical 
evaluation should be followed by genetic testing for confirmation 
of TSC and prognostication.

Clinical and morphological correlations during pregnancy in 
conditions of circulatory hypoxia
O. Reshetnikova*, L. Rudiuk
*Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, Russia
Background & objectives: Congenital heart disease (CHD) during 
pregnancy in women leads to severe hemodynamic disorders. We 
aimed to study the clinical and morphological correlations between 
maternal hemodynamics during 30-34 weeks and structural remodel-
ling of chorionic villi in placentas in women with CHD
Methods: Thirty-five medical records of pregnancies were ana-
lysed with emphasis on the mother’s heart rate (HR),blood pressure 
(BP); systolic and minute blood volumes (respectively: SBV and 
MBV). Respective placentas studied included 20 cases of CHD 
and 15 controls (non-complicated pregnancies). H&E slides, were 
studied microscopically and by point count computer morphom-
etry.The differences between groups’ data were elucidated by non-
parametric Mann-Whitney test.
Results: The results of the study showed a decrease in maternal 
hemodynamic parameters: HR, BP, SBV and MBV in the period of 
30-34 weeks of gestation during pregnancy with CHD compared 
with the control (p<0.05). Microscopic examination, in the contrast 
to physiological pregnancy, revealed an increase in syncytiocapil-
lary membranes (SCM) and their thickening compared to the con-
trol. The analysis of correlations between the thickness of the SCM 
and the SBV and the MBV of maternal hemodynamics established 
the presence of negative linear connections during 30-34 weeks 
of gestation in the central parts of the placenta (respectively: r= 
-0.6635 and r= -0.6400).
Conclusion: Deficiency of maternal hemodynamics during 30-34 
weeks of gestation is accompanied by increased sclerotic processes 
in the placenta in women with CHD. As a result, the permeability 
of the SCM decreases, the metabolic processes between mother and 
foetus worsen. Remodeling of the SCM structure is considered in 
the aspect of adaptation of the placenta to circulatory hypoxia due 
to hemodynamic disorders in women with CHD.

Neonatal kidney as a rare site of extramedullary haematopoiesis
M. Jovanovic*, G. Nikolić, T. Terzic, S. Glumac
*University of Belgrade, Medical Faculty, Institute for Pathology, 
Serbia
Background & objectives: Extramedullary haematopoiesis (EMH) 
presents development of hematopoietic tissue outside the red bone mar-
row. During foetal and early neonatal life, the major sites of EMH are 
liver and spleen. If needed, EMH appears in other organs like adrenals, 
and perirenal fatt.
Methods: Histological and immunohistochemical analysis of 
EMH focuses in postmortem samples of neonatal kidneys.
Results: We present an autopsy case of a twin, preterm, hypotrophic 
male neonate who was born in 32. gestational week and died 2 days 
after the labor due to neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. During 
pregnancy, a twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome was diagnosed, while 
after the labor marked congenital anaemia was detected. The major gross 
findings were: pailor, anaemia of internal organs, bilateral calcified cysts 
of periventricular white matter, hydropericardium, neonatal ARDS. An 
interesting histopathological findings in kidney samples were patchy 
interstitial infiltrates of uniform cells, with increased N/C ratio, which 
immunohistochemically correspond to erythroblasts (CD71+), while 
immunoexpresion of other markers was absent (CD34, CD117, TdT, 
Pax5, CD19, Lysosim, CD38, CD10, CD20, CD61).
Conclusion: Foetal and neonatal hypoxia, caused by numerous 
aetiologies, induce EMH in other various internal organs. Unlike in 
adults, kidney in foetuses and neonates is an extremely rare site of 
EMH, especially in isolated one-lineage hyperplasia. This finding 
could help further research in the field of potential sites of EMH.

Santos
*Hospital General Universitario, Spain
Background & objectives: The term arthrogryposis is used to denote 
contractures involving at least two joints in different body regions. The 
most prevalent type is amyoplasia, which may have a higher prevalence 
in monozygotic twins; however, it usually only impacts one of them.
Methods: We present a case of a primiparous woman without any anteced-
ents, with a bicorial and biamniotic gestation in her 31st week. In a routine 
ultrasound study, discordance between both foetuses, raised nuchal fold and 
claw hand was observed in one of them. It concluded with a feticide and 
request for an autopsy after the birth of the second twin.
Results: A male foetus with a multiarticular flexion position, with 
skin shortening in the neck (pseudoterigium) was received in our 
service. Accompanying the joint contractures, marked general-
ized muscle atrophy (amyoplasia) was identified due to the lack of 
intrauterine mobility because of these contractures. In addition, he 
had clawed hands and macroglossia. The complementary studies of 
chromosomopathies and genetics for neuromuscular diseases did 
not identify any alterations that justified the origin of the foetal 
pathology detected. The prenatal ultrasound and autopsy findings 
in our case were characteristic of arthrogryposis.
Conclusion: The incidence of arthrogryposis is approximately 
1/3000 live births; however, the prenatal incidence indicates a high 
intrauterine mortality. More than 400 specific disorders presenting 
with arthrogryposis have been identified. Its aetiology is highly 
heterogeneous with a background of genetic disorders with variable 
prognosis and inheritance. The most prevalent form is amyoplasia. 
Current ultrasound identifies approximately 25% of cases before 
24 weeks in general obstetrics care population.

The attitude and general knowledge concerning perinatal 
autopsy in midwivery bachelor students and hospital midwives 
in internet querend
J. Gulczynski*, M. Michalski, S. Goertz, E. Izycka-Swieszewska
*Dept. of Pathology and Neuropathology, Medical University of 
Gdansk, Poland
Background & objectives: We tried to assess knowledge about peri-
natal autopsy among bachelor students and midwives. Unanonimous 
students’ request to see one during seminars attracted our attention. 
We decided to assess attitude and knowledge of this procedure through 
online querend in other universities.
Methods: Getting positive feedback after presenting recorded 
autopsies to the students we decided to assess the general 
knowledge of this procedure, attitude, experience, benefits coming 
from autopsy among wider spectrum of students and university 
hospital midwives. Online querend was divided into standard 
sections describing respondents, medical background, experience, 
knowledge, the attitude, opinions about the possible benefits 
coming from such autopsies.
Results: More than 300 students answered the querend, and about 
190 midwives so far. The final results will be presented during the 
Congress as we still gather the data. The results are quite aston-
ishing because overwhelming majority fully understands the need 
of the perinatal autopsy, with will to attend it if possible (0 to 1 
seen so far). The experience is based mainly on written or internet 
sources. Majority of respondents sees the benefits of postmortem 
examination for future family counselling (inherited disorders), 
future perinatal care, correlations with prenatal ultrasound diag-
nostics. Almost all respondents consider information from autopsy 
vital for future professional work.
Conclusion: Perinatal autopsy has not yet suffered from dramatic 
decline as others. After this querend we learn that knowledge from 
this procedure (so far limited to physicians) is noticed and acknowl-
edged by other medical professionals. Due to obvious obstacles 
personal attendance is mostly impossible, but in era of digitalisa-
tion, remote presence, post factum analysis is available for every 
medical interested in extra practical knowledge. Discussing results 
might be an enormous source of information for every part, espe-
cially in rare cases.

Placental incidental finding in a context of a giant congenital 
melanocytic nevus – a case report
A. Leuca*, V. Segers, C. Dangoisse, A. Raat
*CHU Brugmann, Brussels, Belgium
Background & objectives: Melanocyte aggregates within the placenta 
raise a differential diagnosis between benign nevus and a metastasis of 
a maternal or foetal melanoma. The association with congenital mel-
anocytic nevi of the newborn is a rare, but already described condition.
Methods: After an uncomplicated pregnancy, a healthy woman 
gave birth at term. The female infant showed a giant congenital 
melanocytic nevus in the left lower extremity, with multiple satel-
lite lesions and a thoracic infantile haemangioma. The placenta was 
sent for pathological examination. Multiple skin resections of the 
lesions were also performed.
Results: The macroscopic aspect of the placenta was normal. The 
microscopic examination showed well-delineated incidental cell 
aggregates within the chorionic villi. These cells were focally 
pigmented and did not exhibit any cytological atypia. They were 
absent in the intervillous space. No mitoses could be found. The 
cells were positive for MelanA red and S100 immunohistochemical 
stains. HMB45 antibody expression was positive. The microscopic 
and immunohistochemical examinations of the infant’s main mel-
anocytic lesion and the satellite lesions showed features consistent 
with congenital nevi, without any malignant transformation. Close 
clinical follow-up of the infant is still ongoing.
Conclusion: Incidental ectopic tissue in the placenta (such as 
adrenocortical, liver parenchyma) is rare. On the other hand, 
the differential diagnosis comprises malignant entities, such as 
metastatic tumour from maternal or foetal origin. The current 
case report illustrates a rare placental finding (melanocytic nevi 
cells) in a context of a giant congenital melanocytic nevus of the 
infant with no signs of malignant transformation at the moment 
of reporting.

Spinal neurenteric cyst: a case report
I. Msakni*, R. Aouadi, N. Mansouri, F. Gargouri, M. Ben Thayer, 
K. Tlili, B. Laabidi
*Department of Pathology, Military Hospital of Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The neurenteric cyst is a rare con-
genital deformity, It has a predilection for the lower cervical and 
upper dorsal region. We present a case of intradural intramedullary 
spinal neurenteric cyst and discuss its clinicopathological features.
Methods: We report a case of spinal neuroenteric cyst i a 11 year-
old child.
Results: An 11-year old child presented with neck pain and gait 
problems evolving for six months. Magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) was performed and showed intradural and intramedullary 
cystic formation at the level of C5-C6, isointense to cerebrospinal

fluid(CSF) with non-enhanced wall. The mass was removed 
surgically.
Histological examination showed a very thin cystic wall with a 
columnar ciliated coating with numeral mucin-producing cells. The 
epithelial cells had monomorphic nuclei without atypia.
Reactive gliosis was noted in the adjacent glial parenchyma.
These findings were consistent with a spinal neurenteric cyst.
Conclusion: The neurenteric cyst is a rare congenital anomaly 
of the medullary canal. There are no specific clinical signs. The 
size of the cyst and the associated malformations affect the onset 
of symptoms.
The diagnosis is suggested by MRI and confirmed by an anatomo-
pathological study of the cyst wall. Surgery is intended to be as 
radical as possible to avoid relapse.

Oral carcinoma cuniculatum in childhood: a rare entity
A. Chaachou*, R.A. de Carvalho-Ovalles, C.E. Haro-Haro, M. 
Alberola-Ferranti, M. Garrido-Pontnou, A. Navarro-Jiménez, J. 
Camacho
*Hospital Universitari Vall d Hebron, Spain
Background & objectives: Carcinoma cuniculatum is a rare variant 
of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Only 66 cases affecting oral cavity 
have been reported to date, three in childhood. We present a case of an 
11-year-old girl with oral carcinoma cuniculatum (OCC).
Methods: We reviewed the case of a healthy 11-year-old girl pre-
senting an indurated excrescent lesion on the right hemi-tongue 
with a diagnosis of OCC.
Results: The biopsy showed a proliferation of well-differentiated 
squamous cells forming crypts with keratin microabscesses inside, 
reminiscent of rabbit burrows. A diagnosis of SCC suggestive of 
OCC was established. A subtotal glossectomy with bilateral cervi-
cal lymph node removal was performed. A large tumour size OCC 
(5 cm) was found with an invasion depth of 24 mm (pT4a), without 
lymph node involvement (N0) or metastases (M0).
The main causes of SCC in children are congenital syndromes (Li-
Fraumeni and Fanconi anaemia), immunodeficiency, Epstein-Barr 
Virus infection and dyskeratosis congenita. However, our patient 
did not have any of these conditions.
Conclusion: OCC is a rare entity that, although it can occur at any 
age, typically affects people in their seventh or eighth decade. The 
aetiology and risk factors associated with OCC remain unknown. 
OCC is locally aggressive but non-metastasizing, with an excellent 
prognosis after complete resection.
The differential diagnosis should be made with benign entities such 
as osteomyelitis, abscesses, odontogenic or epidermal inclusion 
cysts, depending on their location. Knowing about this entity is 
essential to avoid delays and/or erroneous diagnosis.

Exencephaly in 23-week-old foetus with placental anomaly
N. Unal, A. Yavuz*, C.Y. Sanhal, H.S. Toru
*Akdeniz University Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Neural tube defects are the most frequent 
form of congenital central nervous system abnormalities that can lead 
to several malformations of the nervous system. Incidence varies 
widely between populations from 1 to 10 per 10,000 births.
Methods: There is still much to learn regarding the underlying 
mechanisms of neural tube defects and understanding them could 
help prevent countless cases. In our case report, we discussed a 
primigravid woman, whose unborn child was lost due to a neural 
tube defect.
Results: A 20-year-old primigravid woman appealed to our emer-
gency room after her clinical examination in an external clinic 
showed there was no foetal heartbeat. She was 23 weeks pregnant 
and she said that her water broke a month ago.
In the examination, foetus was observed as male. The face of the foetus 
had some abnormal features that may be linked to a diagnosis: flat nasal 
bridge, low-set ears, micrognathia and long philtrum. Anal opening 
was observed to be normal. Pathological findings were developmental 
retardation, encephalocele, exencephaly, hypertelorism, empty sella, 
and grade III maceration. Two vascular structures (one artery and one 
vein) were observed in the umbilical cord. Retroplacental hematoma 
was observed.
Conclusion: The woman in our case is young and primigravid. 
There is a great deal of genetic contribution in the development of 
neural tube defects. The recurrence of neural tube defects after an 
index case being diagnosed is about %2-5. Routine genetic testing 
and counselling at least to the women who experience such termi-
nation in their first pregnancies would be useful for both under-
standing the genetic basis of neural tube defects and preventing 
later abortions with couples who have genetic predispositions.

Evaluation of the recurrency risk of basal plate myometrial 
fibres
F. Rosa*, S. Guimarães
*Instituto Português de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, 
Portugal
Background & objectives: In May 2020 an expert panel proposed 
guidelines for classification and reporting of placenta accreta spectrum 
(PAS) disorders. The basal plate myometrial fibres (BPMF) category 
is defined for delivered placentas and portend a risk for PAS in a 
subsequence pregnancy.
Methods: Between 2007 and 2022, 8 cases of placentas with 
BPMF that had a subsequent pregnancy were found. The slides 
were reviewed and reclassified. Data regarding maternal age, par-
ity, prior caesarean delivery, and gestational age was collected. The 
subsequent delivery history was analysed regarding complications 
that may relate to BPMF recurrence and, when available, the slides 
were review and reclassified.
Results: At BPMF first occurrence the mean maternal age was 31 years 
(range: 22-38). Three were primiparous and four had a prior caesarean. 
Six were term placentas and two were preterm (28 and 33 gestational 
weeks). BPMF were equally distributed as stage 1 and 2 with a mean 
foci number of 3 (range: 1-7) and a mean linear extension of 4,4mm 
(range: 0,4-6,9mm).
The subsequent pregnancy outcomes showed 5 placentas with patho-
logical evaluation, of which 2 had BPMF recurrences, corresponding 
to index cases stage 2. They were stage 1 and 2, with 1 and 5 foci, the 
largest with 2,3mm and 7,7mm, respectively. The 3 remaining deliver-
ies had no complications.
Conclusion: In our series the only clinical factor possibly associ-
ated with the development of BMPF was a prior caesarean delivery 
history. The risk of recurrent BPMF in a subsequent pregnancy 
seems relevant and associated with a prior stage 2 BPMF. More 
data is needed in order to develop recommendations regarding 
clinical management of pregnancies with a prior BPMF and the 
risk of future PAS.

Hamartoma of mature cardiac myocytes: a case report
H.G. Terzioglu*, D. Orhan, T. Karagoz, H.H. Aykan
*Hacettepe University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Hamartoma of mature cardiac myocytes 
is a rare and benign overgrowth of the mature cardiac myocytes and 
classified in the benign tumour-like lesions of the heart in the 2021 
World Health Organization (WHO) Classification.
Methods: We present a 6-year-old child who was found to have a 
pansystolic murmur during routine controls. On echocardiography, 
an ill-defined lesion involving the right ventricle and the inter-
ventricular septum (IVS) was described. Cardiac MRI revealed a 
68x54 mm sized, contrast enhanced solid mass, with hyperdense 
foci due to increased vascularity. An incisional biopsy was taken 
from the IVS.
Results: On histopathological assessment of the formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded specimen, myocyte hypertrophy and disorgani-
zation were noted. Nuclei of the myocytes were enlarged, hyper-
chromatic and significantly bizarre. Sarcoplasmic vacuolization 
was present in some of the myocytes. Minimal fibrosis, chronic 
inflammation composed of lymphocytes, a prominent vascular pro-
liferation and dilatation in venules were observed in the interstitial 
regions. Vascular proliferation was enhanced by using CD31 immu-
nohistochemical stain. These findings suggested the diagnosis of 
hamartoma of mature cardiac myocytes and excision of the lesion 
was suggested.
Conclusion: There are less than 30 patients in the literature 
with hamartoma of mature cardiac myocytes. There is no age 
predilection, but it tends to occur in children and younger adults. 
Most are asymptomatic and found incidentally. When symptomatic, 
patients describe chest pain and palpitations. Although these 
lesions are morphologically benign, they can have fatal results like 
arrythmias and functional hemodynamic obstruction. Fortunately, 
surgical excision is very effective, even when it is incomplete, in 
preventing these consequences.

VACTERL association: report of a case with additional con-
genital malformations
V. Almeida*, C. Courelas, C. Cerdeira, M. Ribeiro, A. Alves, R. 
Pina
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário, Portugal
Background & objectives: The association of vertebral anomalies, 
anal atresia, cardiovascular malformations, tracheoesophageal fistula, 
and renal and limb anomalies is known by the acronym VACTERL. We 
will describe the autopsy finding of a VACTERL case with associated 
features not included in the definition.
Methods: We report the autopsy findings of a foetus with 
VACTERL association, defined as the presence of at least three 
of the cardinal features. The autopsy followed medical abortion 
because of multiple malformations detected on routine first-tri-
mester ultrasound.
Results: The 18 weeks-old male foetus was the first pregnancy 
of healthy non-consanguineous parents. VACTERL diagnosis was 
based on the collective findings of scoliosis with lumbar hemiver-
tebra, anal atresia, cardiac defects (subaortic CIV and absence of 
the left pulmonary artery), tracheoesophageal fistula with esopha-
geal atresia, and left renal agenesis.
Besides the diagnostic findings, we also identified other congenital 
malformations, such as left lung agenesis, intestinal malrotation, 
and a single umbilical artery.
Craniofacial alterations such as upward slanting palpebral fissures, 
micrognathia, and low set ears were also present.
Conclusion: When initially described, VACTERL did not include 
all cardinal features that now integrate the association. Report-
ing cases is therefore helpful to clarify the prevalence of other 
associated malformations. Additionally, cases like ours reflect 
VACTERL´s clinical heterogeneity and could contribute to under-
standing its pathogenesis.
This case highlights the necessity of having specialized staff for the 
foetal autopsy capable of identifying and correlating the findings. 
Also, it shows the crucial role of Pathology in multidisciplinary 
teams responsible for managing prenatally diagnosed conditions.

Kudryashova
*Chuvash State University by I.N.Ulianov, Russia
Background & objectives: Ependymomas are a group of neuroecto-
dermal tumours that arise from a heterogeneous population of radial 
glial cells (RGCs) during embryonic brain development.
Purpose of the study: to demonstrate a rare case of congenital ana-
plastic ependymoma in a stillborn.
Methods: For histological examination, the walls of the lateral 
ventricles (the area of the anterior, middle and posterior horn) 
and the area of the bottom of the 4th ventricle of the brain 
were taken. The micropreparation was made according to the 
hematoxylin and eosin, van Gieson method. Additionally, an 
immunohistochemical method was used with staining for neural 
markers .
Results: Histologically, a brain tumour was detected, represented by 
elongated unipolar cells with monomorphic nuclei of a round-oval 
shape, with a clear pattern of chromatin in the form of small grains. 
Mitoses occurred in small numbers. The distribution of cells in the 
tumour tissue was uneven with the formation of characteristic perivas-
cular rosettes (tumour cells were located At a distance from the vessels, 
there were parallel and chaotically located tumour cells, small cavities 
and tubules lined with ependymal tumour cells (“epithelial rosettes”) 
along the vessels of the microvasculature.
Conclusion: Tumour of the central nervous system with localization 
in the IV and lateral ventricles of the brain (ICD/O - 9392/3: anaplas-
tic ependymoma, grade - GIII. IHC study of tumour cells revealed a 
positive reaction to GFAP, S100 Protein, vimentin, part cells expressed 
pancytokeratin, and the reaction with EMA on tumour cells is weakly 
positive. The proliferative activity marker Ki-67 was expressed on 
8-10% of tumour cells. Morphological verification of such tumours 
requires IHC studies to identify the neural immunophenotype and 
molecular genetics.

Methods: In a retrospective study of 1000 protocols of patho-
anatomical examination of a child’s profile, we identified 3 cases 
of generalized infantile arterial calcification: 2 in newborns, 1 
- first detected at the age of 1.5 years.
Histological examination of the internal organs of the child after 
additional decalcification was performed by staining for hema-
toxylin-eosin, according to Van Gieson and Kason.
Results: A widespread mediacalcinosis of the internal elastic 
membrane and the muscular layer of the arteries of the elas-
tic and muscular-elastic type was revealed, with the outcome in 
stenosing atherosclerosis of the vessels of the heart, kidneys, 
lungs, spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, intestines, mesentery, 
thymus, extremities, calcification of the aorta and pulmonary 
trunk. In the myocardium, a picture of focal hypertrophy and 
fragmentation of contractile cardiomyocytes of both ventricles 
of the heart, diffuse small-focal transmural and subendocardial 
cardiosclerosis with damage to the rhythmogenic zones of the 
heart and vegetative ganglia of the heart with their hypogangli-
onism was found; transmural and subendocardial infarcts in the 
heart of various degrees of prescription.
Conclusion: Molecular genetic study revealed a mutation 
c.1298A>T in the homozygous state in the ENPP1 gene. The 
combination of generalized infantile arterial calcification with 
early manifestations of atherosclerosis of the aorta and large 
vessels is an extremely unfavourable prognosis for patients, and 
in 85% of cases ends in death.

The rare case of pathomorphological study of the acardiac 
monster from monozygotic twins
O. Sudareva*, E. Ignatyeva, S. Lezhenina, E. Guryanova
*Chuvash State University by I.N.Ulianov, Russia
Background & objectives: Reverse arterial perfusion syndrome 
(ROAP, TRAP) or acardial twinning occurs in 0.3–1% of monozy-
gotic twins and in about 1 in 35,000 births. Acardiac twins or a double 
reverse arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence is rare but serious.
Methods: 26,783 protocols of pathomorphological examination 
of placentas for the period from 2015 to 2020 from women who 
gave birth in the Chuvash Republic were retrospectively evaluated.
A case of own pathoanatomical study of an acardiac monster is 
described, including the stage of autopsy with an assessment of 
organometric parameters, histological and immunohistochemical 
examination of its internal organs.
Results: During the study period, there was an increase in multiple 
pregnancies, of which the number of monochorionic pregnancies 
increased from 11 cases to 24 cases, bichorionic - from 42 (in 
2016) to 77 (in 2020) cases. The number of artery-vein, vein-
vein vascular anastomoses in the monochorionic placental disc 
increased - 3 cases (in 2016), 4 cases (in 2017), 8 cases (in 2018) 
and 10 cases (in 2020). ). The frequency of occurrence of foetus 
amorphous acardious was 1:6779 (in 2016) and 1:6759 (in 2020), 
in the remaining years the SMAP syndrome was not detected.
Conclusion: Based on the anamnesis, the results of a pathoana-
tomical examination of the placenta and an abnormal product of 
conception, a pathoanatomical diagnosis was formulated: Acardia 
monster (acardius amorphus) - acardia, anencephaly, anophthalmia, 
atresia of the oral fissure, aprosopia (facial bones are missing), 
aplasia of the ribs, bones of the upper limbs, sternum, aplasia of 
the pelvic bones, failed I period of intestinal rotation, atresia of the 
large intestine, and anal canal ; absence of pancreas, liver; aplasia 
of the trachea, lungs.

A rare lysosomal storage disease: galactosialidosis
D. Sá*, U. Ramos, F.S. Vieira, J.R. Vizcaíno
*Centro Hospitalar Universitário do Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Galactosialidosis is an autosomal recessive 
disease caused by a defect in protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA) 
that results in a deficiency of the lysosomal enzymes beta-galactosidase 
and alpha-neuraminidase. PPCA is an intralysosomal protein which 
protects these enzymes from premature proteolytic processing.
Methods: We herein present the case of a female new-born and her 
20-year-old mother. At the 24th week of gestation, on a routine sec-
ond trimester ultrasound, hydrops fetalis was detected. The mother 
was hospitalized to further study the cause of the hydrops and was 
submitted to an amniocentesis. At the 30th week of gestation, the 
new-born was delivered by elective C-section.
Results: The baby was born with an Apgar score of 6/7/8 and 1700 
grams. We received a large and heavy placenta with a weight of 
505 grams (above the 95th percentile) and measuring 17,5 x 14 
x 4 cm, showing only a green discoloration of the foetal surface 
and membranes. Histologic examination showed enlarged pale villi 
with striking cytoplasm vacuolization of the syncytiotrophoblast 
and of the villous stromal cells. PAS, PASd and Alcian Blue stains 
were all negative in the vacuoles. Immune and infectious causes 
for the hydrops were excluded and an array comparative genomic 
hybridization of the amniotic fluid revealed a homozygous muta-
tion in the cathepsin A (CTSA) gene.
Conclusion: The early infantile phenotype of Galactosialidosis usually 
presents prenatally or within the first 3 months of life with hydrops 
fetalis, cherry red spots, visceromegaly, psychomotor delay, coarse 
facies, skeletal dysplasia, and early death in the first few years of life. 
Although the placenta is often enlarged or hydropic, vacuolisation or 
inclusions are not always evident. A thorough examination of the pla-
centa is therefore warranted. The now infant is still alive although with 
many complications of the disease.

An integrated approach to the diagnosis of pancreatic islet cell 
hyperplasia in a newborn (sectional case)
O. Sudareva*, E. Ignatyeva, S. Lezhenina, E. Guryanova
*Chuvash State University by I.N.Ulianov, Russia
Background & objectives: Purpose of the study: to describe a rare 
case of pancreatic lesions in a newborn and to demonstrate a multi-
stage approach in making a pathoanatomical diagnosis.
Methods: A sectional case of pathoanatomical autopsy of a new-
born with congenital pancreatic pathology was studied, including 
the stage of autopsy with an assessment of organometric and mor-
phometric parameters, microscopic and histochemical, immunohis-
tochemical studies of internal organs and placenta with additional 
staining of PAS-reaction. A post-mortem biochemical study of the 
child’s blood for the content of glycohemoglobin, acetone and glu-
cose was carried out.
Results: A pathoanatomical examination of the corpse of a new-
born girl at the age of 16 days, born at 39-40 weeks. Histologically, 
there are 8 to 14 islets of Langerhans in each pancreas lobule; 
hyperplasia of PAS-positive cells, mitoses were not found in them; 
periductal interstitial inflammation; transformation of the ductal 
epithelium into pancreatic β-cells. When staining the pancreas 
using chromogranin A, a pronounced expression of the glycopro-
tein in neuroendocrine cells is revealed. In the biochemical study of 
cadaveric blood samples by the columnless ion-exchange method, 
the content of glycosylated hemoglobin was 1.1%; determination

of glucose in whole blood by enzymatic colorimetric method with 
deproteinization - the result is negative.
Conclusion: Taking into account the anamnestic and autopsy 
findings, the child was diagnosed with a congenital pathology 
of the pancreas - hyperplasia of the islets of Langerhans 
(nesidioblastosis) with severe metabolic disorders in the form of 
uncorrectable hypoglycemia, decompensated metabolic acidosis 
and multiple organ failure. In the genesis of this pathology, 
one cannot underestimate the role of a generalized intrauterine 
infection with damage to vital organs, including the pancreas. A 
post-mortem comprehensive approach to clarify this pathology is 
necessary.

Congenital interruption of aortic arch (IAA) – a foetal autopsy 
findings with literature review
F. Soares Nogueira*, C. Dahlstedt Ferreira, D. Argyropoulou, H. 
Oliveira Coelho
*Hospital Garcia de Orta, Portugal
Background & objectives: Interruption of the aortic arch (IAA) is 
a rare and severe congenital heart disease, characterized by complete 
anatomic discontinuity between two adjacent segments of the aortic 
arch. It’s associated with other major intracardiac and noncardiac 
malformations.
Methods: We present two foetal autopsies:
A 33 week old male foetus that died in utero. The mother was 26 
years old, without relevant medical history. An echocardiography 
revealed several heart defects.
A 36-week-old female foetus that also died in utero, the mother was 
33 years old, without relevant medical background, the CHD was 
only diagnose during the autopsy.
Results: The first foetus had anthropometrical parameters compat-
ible with 33-week-old gestation, without external malformations. 
The heart dissection revealed an interventricular communication 
and a complete interruption of aorta. Without other malformations.
The second foetus had anthropometrical parameters compatible 
with 36-week-old gestation also without external malformations. 
The heart dissection revealed an interventricular communication, a 
third superior ostium in the posterior wall of the pulmonary artery 
that communicated with the aortic arch. The aorta emerged and 
branched as usually till the emerging of the left subclavian artery, 
where, it became atretic and communicate with the pulmonary 
artery, which turned out to be a systemic vessel into the remaining 
thorax and abdomen.
Conclusion: Congenital aortic arch interruption is associated with 
coexisting intracardiac malformations, chromosomal anomalies 
and is the most common cardiac defect occurring in DiGeorge 
syndrome.
We presented two cases of congenital interrupted aortic arch with 
other coexisting congenital heart defects but without association 
with a noncardiac malformations.

Foetal thrombotic vasculopathy: a case report
S. Mabrouk*, T. Tlili, Z. Lajmi, S. Yacoub, A. Ben Abdelkader, 
B. Sriha, M. Mokni
*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Foetal thrombotic vasculopathy (FTV) is 
a rare entity, defined by thrombosis of foetal vessels leading to fibrosis 
avascular downstream villi. These lesions occur at the end of the sec-
ond and third trimester with a prevalence around 1%.
Methods: A 28-year-old G2P1A0 pregnant women without any 
medical disease history. The pregnancy was normal without inci-
dent. The patient presented a decrease in active foetal movements. 
On examination and abdominal ultrasonography, foetal death at 
24 weeks was diagnosed. Foetal extraction was done. The foetus 
and placenta were referred to pathological diagnosis. There is no 
history of thrombophilia.
Results: Macroscopically, foetal necropsy showed a macerated 
male foetus weighed 126 g, of an anatomical age of 18 weeks 
without any external or visceral malformations. The placenta had 
an oval shape, weighed 62 g, and measured 11,5cm x 8,5cm. The 
chorioamniotic membrane was translucent. The umbilical cord was 
hypercoiled with central insertion measuring 45cm. On section, the 
placental parenchyma had no macroscopically identifiable lesion, 
and no thrombi of chorionic vessels were visible.
Histological examination of the placenta showed several endolu-
minal chorionic vessel fibrosis with fibrosis villi and the pres-
ence of groups of avascular villi. No visceral thrombi in necropsy 
specimens were found. These changes were deemed to be consistent 
with FTV.
Conclusion: FTV diagnosis is histologic, with foetal thrombotic 
lesions: chorionic vessel thrombi, and avascular fibrosis villi. 
These changes are similar to those seen in intrauterine foetal 
demise but are focal rather than diffuse. The underlying aetiology 
of FTV is unknown though hypercoagulability(thrombophilia) and 
circulatory stasis implying chorioamnionitis and cord anomalies 
were reported in the literature.
FTV may be related to adverse perinatal outcomes including foetal 
death. However, much studies about pathogenesis and criteria diag-
nosis are desirable to change the unfavourable outcome.

Pseudoprogression mimicking hyperprogressive disease after 
pembrolizumab treatment in a patient with lung cancer – his-
topathological diagnostic clues

Imai, K. Kobayashi, H. Kagamu, H. Imada, T. Kawasaki*
*Department of Pathology, Saitama Medical University Interna-
tional Medical Center, Japan
Background & objectives: Pseudoprogression after anti-programmed 
death-1 (PD-1) antibody therapy is a rare phenomenon in patients 
with non-small cell carcinoma. There is limited information about the 
pathological mechanism of pseudoprogression, especially regarding 
the relationship between intratumoral lymphocytes and exacerbation 
of pulmonary infiltrative shadow.
Methods: The patient, a 51-year-old woman, with a history of 
smoking was referred to our hospital for abnormal shadow in 
chest radiograph and shortness of breath. Diagnostic bronchos-
copy revealed pulmonary adenocarcinoma with cT4N3M1c, and 
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was expressed in 75 % 
of the patient’s tumour specimen without any driver mutation. 
Therefore, only pembrolizumab was administered as the first-
line treatment.
Results: On the third day after pembrolizumab treatment, 
there was a sudden appearance of cough and sputum. Chest 
radiography showed extensive infiltrative shadow in the 
right lung field. On the eleventh day, the infiltrative shadow 
exhibited progressive exacerbation with severe symptoms, and

she expectorated massive sputum which keeps the dendritic 
shape like a bronchus. The histological examination of the 
sputum demonstrated adenocarcinoma cell clusters with fibrin 
formation. Immunohistochemically, CD4- or CD8-positive, 
tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were observed in 
the clusters of cancer cells as well as around them. The 
pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells showed immuno-expressions 
of PD-L1 and TTF-1. After one cycle of pembrolizumab, 
the symptoms improved, and chest radiography showed 
remarkable remission.
Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report 
eliciting the presence of intratumoral lymphocytes within the 
pulmonary tissues at the maximal timing of pseudoprogression. 
Notably, it was hard to distinguish pseudoprogression from 
hyper-progression because of the huge infiltrative shadow 
and exacerbating respiratory symptoms. Our current case 
suggested that progressive exacerbation within 4 weeks from 
the initiation of anti-PD-1 antibody displays the possibility of 
pseudoprogression, and the radiographic entity of pulmonary 
exacerbation could be explained by the presence of TILs.

Uncommon primary pleural mesenchymal tumours: study of 
seven cases
M. Garcia Martos*, C.M. Vieru, Y. Gómez Navarro, A. Panizo 
Santos
*Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Spain
Background & objectives: Primary pleural tumours are uncommon 
but there is a wide variety of them, both benign and malignant, whose 
accurate diagnosis is very important. This study aimed to review the 
cases of mesenchymal pleural tumours in two Spanish institutions.
Methods: We searched in two major hospitals for cases of uncom-
mon primary pleural mesenchymal neoplasms over a period of 
10 years (2012-2022). Seven cases (3 male and 4 female) were 
found, with a mean age of 57 years: two benign (schwannoma) and 
five malignant tumours (4 synovial sarcomas and 1 angiomatoid 
fibrous histiocytoma). We analysed clinical, histopathological, 
immunophenotypic and molecular features.
Results: Schwannomas were incidental findings and malignant 
tumours symptomology were chest pain and dyspnea. Imaging 
studies of schwannomas and angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma 
showed pleural confined tumours, whereas two out of four synovial 
sarcomas were poorly defined pleuropulmonary pseudocyst masses. 
Grossly, the latter, were lesions with cystic change, calcification 
and necrosis. Histologically, benign morphology and S100 posi-
tive helped schwannomas diagnoses. On the other hand, synovial 
sarcomas consisted of dense fascicles of monomorphic spindle cell 
without epithelial component, all of them positive for CD99, two of 
them partially for EMA and Bcl2 and 1 positive for TLE-1. FISH 
studies showed SS78-SSX fusion in synovial sarcomas and EWSR1 
gene rearrangement in angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma.
Conclusion: Primary pleural mesenchymal neoplasms are uncom-
mon. It is important to recognize, as long as its prognosis and ther-
apy could be different from the one of the most common neoplasms 
of the pleura, metastatic cancers and diffuse malignant mesothe-
lioma. A pleural spindle cell neoplasm has a broad differential 
diagnosis, and although immunostaining and molecular advances 
are helpful, the knowledge of these rare lesions and its morphol-
ogy together with clinical correlation, continue to be the key issue.

Thymomas sub-classification – WHO 5th classification 
application
J. Madeira*, V. Almeida, V. Sousa, L. Carvalho
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário, Portugal
Background & objectives: Thymomas are indolent neoplasias with 
an incidence of 1.7 cases/million in Europe and surgery is the gold 
standard for resectable disease.
WHO 5th edition corroborates wide tumoral sampling for searching 
patterns, as well as surgical margins invasion evaluation.
Methods: We present a Portuguese case series of resectable thy-
momas concerning surgical biopsies/resections between 2016 
and 2020, reviewed and updated according to WHO 5th edition 
classification. All cases were staged according to current rec-
ommendations. Statistical analysis was performed to examine 
contingency tables and compare medians between groups.
Results: Our sample comprises 48 thymomas corresponding to 
25 women and 23 men; patients’ median age at diagnosis was 
65-years-old.
In this series, 33 thymomas were in stage I by AJCC, 10 of which 
showed transcapsular microscopic invasion (Masaoka stage II); 45 
cases (93.8%) were staged pT1a, and 3 patients presented lung 
invasion (pT3).
AB thymoma was the most prevalent histopathologic subtype, 
accounting for 31.3% of all cases, followed by predominantly B1 
thymomas (27.1%).
Commonly it was possible to recognize at least two patterns in 
each tumour, even observed in the same slide, depending on the 
tumoral sampling.
Conclusion: Surgical resection status was the most important pre-
dictor of outcome, achieved in 45 cases (93,8%); 2 cases were 
R1 and one specimen could not be evaluated due to extensive 
fragmentation.
Median age of 65-years-old was observed, higher than 58-years-old 
reported in literature.
All subtypes frequencies were within published data ranges.
Masaoka staging is still the most widely accepted system for clinicians, 
requiring further studies to establish prognosis impact. Surgical 
margins status registries were the most important prognostic feature.

lung tuberculosis. Case report.
M. Mnikhovich, A. Romanov*, L. Erofeeva
*Central Pathology Laboratory, Research Institute of Human 
Morphology, Russia
Background & objectives: Idiopathic lymphoid interstitial 
pneumonia is an interstitial lung disease not associated with 
autoimmune diseases (Sjogren’s syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis) 
or infections (HIV) unlike typical LIP. We present a case of ILIP, 
misdiagnosed as tuberculosis, in a young woman, 23 years old.
Methods: A case of ILIP is presented in a 23-year-old female 
patient who was initially diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis. 
CT showed chronic cavity formation in the first and second segments 
of the left lung. Resection of the corresponding segments of the lung 
was performed, followed by grossing and microscopic examinations.

Results: Gross examination showed a fragment of the lung 
4x3x0.8 cm. The resection mergin and pleura have no pathologi-
cal changes. The lung tissue is brown. On a single area of the 
lung, a subpleural whitish focus with a yellowish centre with the 
formation of a small cavity is visible. The size of the focus is 
0.6x0.5x0.3 cm.
Microscopic examination revealed foci of pneumosclerosis with 
numerous confluent epithelioid cell granulomas with multinucle-
ated giant cells, without caseous necrosis. There is a microcavity 
in the centre of granulomatous inflammation. There is also a weak 
lymphocytic infiltration along the edge of microcavity. The rest 
of the lung tissue with moderate peribronchial and perivascular 
fibrosis.
Conclusion: Thus, we correctly diagnosed ILIP, despite the com-
plexities of clinical diagnosis. ILIP is a rare interstitial lung disease 
affecting more and more people every year. Although the causes 
of ILIP are still a mystery, it is still possible to diagnose the dis-
ease with the help of competent specialists. This case expands our 
understanding of this disease and gives hope for further adequate 
diagnosis and treatment.

E. Baliou*, E. Psychogiou, P. Megas, D. Riga, K. Papadopoulou, 
K. Theochari, I. Vamvakaris
*General Hospital of Thoracic Diseases of Athens "Sotiria", 
Greece
Background & objectives: Synovial Sarcoma (SS) is an entity of deep 
soft tissue usually. This tumour generally occurs in the extremities 
and near the knee joint and mostly in young patients, but in elderly 
individual, too. Rarely, can involve the trunk, mediastinum and vari-
ous viscera.
Methods: A 62-year old male presented to our hospital with pro-
gressive dyspnea and persistent cough. CT scan revealed a lobulated 
mass nodule with distinct borders in the upper lobe of the right lung, 
measuring 7X6,4X3 cm in dimensions. The mass was extending to 
the thoracic wall and invading two ribs, the 3rd and the 4th ribs. 
The patient underwent surgery.
Results: Microscopic examination of the mass, revealed a mesen-
chymal tumour, consisted of uniform blue spindle cells or sheets 
of spindle cells often arranged in kind of fascicles. Sometimes the 
fascicles were more swirly or they intersected at sharp angles and 
had a herring-bone appearance, Dilated branching vessels or heman-
giopericytic pattern of vessels were seen. Poorly differentiated areas 
with rounded or spindled cells showing severe nuclear atypia, high 
mitotic activity, extensive areas of necrosis and some haemorrhages 
were also present. Immunohistochemistry was performed: EMA 
focal (+), Pankeratin (-),TLE-1 (+), CD34 (-), STAT6 (-), S-100 
patchy (+). The differential diagnosis was between Synovial Sar-
coma and Solitary Fibrous Tumour or Malignant Peripreral Nerve 
Sheath Tumour.
Conclusion: Synovial Sarcoma, Solitary Fibrous Tumour and 
Malignant Peripreral Nerve Sheath Tumour can all stain with 
TLE-1.Synovial Sarcoma is a translocation-associated sarcoma, 
characterized by a translocation t(X;18)(p11;q11) between cho-
mosome 18 that leads to a formation of a SS18-SSX fusion 
gene. The genes involved are the SS18 gene (Synovial Sarcoma 
18) that fuses with a partner gene called SSX. There are three 
different SSX genes: SSX1 and SSX2 being the most common 
genes and rarely SSX4. Molecular testing confirmed the above 
diagnosis.

Pulmonary benign metastasizing leiomyomatosis presented by 
severe dyspnea; report of a case
M. Elgammal*, A. Saad Rizk
*Shefaa Al-Orman Hospital, Egypt
Background & objectives: Pulmonary benign metastasizing 
leiomyomatosis (PBML) is a rare entity with unclear pathogenesis, 
characterized by pulmonary metastases of benign leiomyoma with 
history of surgical intervention for uterine leiomyoma. We report a 
case of PBML referred to our centre presenting with dyspnea.
Methods: A 32-year-old woman, presented with severe dyspnea. A 
chest computed tomography revealed bilateral innumerable cannon 
ball lung nodules, the largest was 11.8 cm, raising the suspicion of 
metastatic disease. There was a past surgical history of myomec-
tomy for a uterine leiomyoma at the age of 28. Ultrasound-guided 
biopsy was taken from the largest nodule.
Results: Radiologically the nodules were variable-sized and some-
times amalgamated, varying in distribution between being pleural-
based, parenchymal, and hilar-based. The largest was seen encasing 
the right lower lobar branch of the pulmonary artery. Histopatho-
logically, the pulmonary nodule consisted of intersecting fascicles, 
made by bland smooth muscle cells demonstrating sparse mitosis 
and absence of necrosis. Immunohistochemical staining for smooth 
muscle actin (SMA), Caldesmon and Desmin were strongly positive. 
CD117 and HMB45 were negative. Positive immunoreactivity for oes-
trogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) were identified. 
Another ultrasound-guided biopsy from a nodule in the contralateral 
lung revealed the same findings. The final diagnosis was PBML.
Conclusion: Pulmonary Benign Metastasizing Leiomyomatosis is a very 
rare condition, clonally derived from uterine leiomyomas. Despite the 
metastatic designation, PBMLs usually follow an indolent course with 
progression reported in few cases. PBML should be however considered 
in symptomatic women of reproductive age with a history of uterine 
leiomyoma who present with multiple pulmonary nodules and respiratory 
symptoms. The patient received chemotherapy and luteinizing hormone-
releasing hormone analog with notale clinical improvement.

lung cancer
S. Reppas, K. Paparizou, V. Mousafeiris, P. Aroukatos, D. Nakas, 
N. Chrysanthakoloulos, V. Zolota, V. Tzelepi*
*University of Patras Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: DNA methylation, mediated by DNA 
methyltransferases (DNMTs), regulates gene transcription and genome 
stability. DNMT inhibitors have shown efficacy in solid tumours. The 
aim of this study was to analyse the expression of DNMTs in non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Methods: Tissue blocks from the lobectomy specimens of 115 
patients with NSCLC (50 with squamous cell carcinoma-SqCC 
and 65 with adenocarcinoma-AdCa) were retrieved from the Uni-
versity Hospital of Patras. The expression of DNMT1, DNMT3A, 
DNMT3B and DNMT3L was studied using immunohistochem-
istry. Nuclear (nu) and cytoplasmic (cyt) staining in neoplastic 
and non-neoplastic (bronchial) cells was evaluated. Results were 
correlated with pathologic parameters.
Results: DNMT1_nu+cyt, DNMT3A_nu and DNMT3L_nu 
expression was higher in neoplastic cells, whereas DNMT3A_cyt 
expression was higher in non-neoplastic cells. DNMT3A_cyt and 
DNMT3L_nu expression was higher in AdCa compared to SqCC, 
whereas nuclear DNMT3A and DNMT3B expression was higher in 
SqCC. DNMT1_cyt expression was increased in poorly compared

to highly/moderately differentiated SqCC (p=0.020) and was 
decreased in N1 compared to N0 SqCC. In AdCa, DNMT3L_nu 
expression was higher in N0 compared to N1 carcinomas. No dif-
ference in DNMTs expression was seen in correlation with the 
predominant pattern of AdCas (solid vs. acinar vs. lepidic vs. 
papillary).
Conclusion: Increased nuclear expression of DNMTs in neo-
plastic cells may account for DNA hypermethylation in various 
tumour suppressor genes seen in NSCLC. A heterogenous role for 
the different DNMTs is depicted in the different histologic types 
of NSCLC. Our results highlight a potential role for DNMT1 
in SqCC and DNMT3L in AdCa. Further studies are needed to 
validate these results and analyse the functional role of DNMTs 
in the development and progression of NSCLC, in light of their 
potential therapeutic targeting.

Pulmonary metastasis of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosar-
coma as a first sign of a disease
A. Lovrenski*, N. Gardic, D. Tegeltija, I. Ergelašev
*Faculty of Medicine, University of Novi Sad, Serbia
Background & objectives: Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma 
(EMC) is an ultra-rare sarcoma subtype arised in the deep soft tissue. 
EMC demonstrate a strong tendency for local recurrence (37 - 48%) 
and metastatic disease (50%), usually pulmonary.
Methods: A 59-year-old patient was hospitalized to clarify 
the aetiology of an 2,5 cm infiltrative lesion of the right lung 
discovered on on the thorax CT scan. The patient was operated 
when video-assisted thoracoscopy with atypical resection of the 
lower right lobe was performed.
Results: Rapid on site evaluation imprint cytology, as well as fro-
zen section pathohistological finding indicated a soft tissue tumour. 
FFPE section analysis revealed tumour tissue with multinodular 
architecture with increased tumour cellularity at the periphery of the 
lobules. Stroma consisted of abundant myxoid and chondromyxoid 
matrix into which tumour cells were immersed. Tumour cells were 
uniform, oval to round nuclei, eosinophilic and vacuolated cyto-
plasm, organized into bands and small clusters. Nucleoli were small, 
but conspicuous. Occasional mitotic figures were identified. Foci of 
intralesional haemorrhages were frequently seen in various propor-
tions. Immunohistochemical analysis showed tumour positivity for 
S-100 and neuron specific enolase (NSE) markers.
Conclusion: Based on the histological findings and the results 
of immunohistochemical analysis, final diagnosis correspond to 
EMC, when the existence of a primary soft tissue tumour of other 
site was suspected. A detailed examination of the patient revealed 
a 4 cm tumour in the gluteal region that pathohistologically and 
immunohistochemically corresponded to EMC. Follow-up showed 
asymptomatic patient with no recurrence or new metastatic disease.

Epithelioid malignant mesothelioma with signet ring cells of 
the pleura - a case report
C. Valavanis*, N. Novkovic, G. Stanc, N. Bolanos, M. Papazian, 
S. Stasinopoulou, E. Souka
*Molecular Pathology Unit Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an 
uncommon and very aggressive tumour arising from the mesothe-
lial cells lining serous cavities. Signet ring cell epithelioid MM is an 
extremely rare subtype. Morphological subtypes of epithelioid meso-
thelioma seem to have an impact on outcome.
Methods: A 64-year-old male patient admitted to our hospital for 
chest pain. A CT scan was performed and a lesion of the right 
pleural membranes was found.
The patient underwent a right thoracoscopy for pleural biopsies.
Results: Multiple fragments of tumour tissue measuring 
3X2X0,3cm were sent to the pathology department. The histo-
pathologic examination revealed pleural infiltration by epithelioid 
cells with signet ring morphology and adenomatoid features in a 
solid and nested pattern. The neoplastic cells had eosinophilic cyto-
plasm with cytoplasmic vacuoles, marked nuclear atypia, increased 
mitotic activity with 12mitoses /2mm2. No necrosis was observed.
The immunohistochemical examination demonstrated the meso-
thelial origin of the neoplastic cells, with positivity for WT1, cal-
retinin, D2-40 and CK7. Negative immunoreactivity was observed 
for TTF1, CDX2, CK20, GATA-3 and PSAP.
The diagnosis of high-grade diffuse epithelioid MM with signet-
ring cell features, was made.
Conclusion: Although epithelioid malignant mesothelioma is 
found in up to 80% of patients with MM, signet ring cell epithelioid 
MM is extremely rare, Architectural pattern, cytological features 
and nuclear grading have prognostic and diagnostic value.
Median overall survival for this subtype is 15 months and the major 
diagnostic challenge is ruling out metastasis from other tumours 
featuring signet-ring cell morphology.

Foetal Adenocarcinoma of the lung - a case report
C. Valavanis*, N. Novkovic, G. Stanc, M. Papazian, N. Baltagian-
nis, M. Sevastiadou, E. Souka
*Molecular Pathology Unit Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Foetal adenocarcinoma of the lung 
(FLAC) is a rare tumour, representing only 0.1%–0.5% of all pulmo-
nary neoplasms.
Approximately 25%–40% of patients are asymptomatic at presenta-
tion, most of them with incidental findings.
Methods: Male 54-years-old patient presented to our hospital 
for productive cough. On imaging a tumour was detected in the 
right lung, 2.5cm in diameter, as well multiple lesions in other 
regions of the right lung, up to 1cm in great diameter, without 
lymph node invasion. Right pneumonectomy was performed. 
One mediastinal lymph node and one subcarinal lymph node 
were also removed.
Results: Histolopathological examination revealed a tumour featur-
ing a high-grade conventional adenocarcinoma (positive for CK7, 
TTF-1, Napsin A, AFP, Glypican-3) with a >50% component show-
ing morphology of an adenocarcinoma with clear cytoplasm, large 
vesicular nuclei, severe nuclear atypia, prominent nucleoli, supra-
nuclear/ subnuclear vacuoles and frequent mitoses (positive only 
for CK7). Histochemical stains PAS and PAS-D showed glycogen 
production in the vacuoles.
A diagnosis of high-grade foetal adenocarcinoma with negative 
lymph nodes was made.
The neoplasm penetrated beyond the external elastic layer of the 
visceral pleura (PL1).
One lesion from other pulmonary regions was an hamartoma with a 
small focus of foetal carcinoma, while the rest of them represented 
fibrous lesions with calcifications.
Conclusion: Based on histopathological features and clinical 
course FLAC has been categorized into low-grade (L-FLAC) and 
high-grade (H-FLAC) subtypes. L-FLAC shows low nuclear atypia, 
S331

prominent morule formation and has a pure pattern. H-FLAC typi-
cally presents ≥50% foetal morphology and is often associated with 
other conventional types of lung adenocarcinoma. These tumours 
have different molecular profile from conventional lung adenocar-
cinomas, with very low frequency of KRAS and EGFR mutations.

A complex case of pulmonary tuberculosis with superimposed 
chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis: clinical, cytopatho-
logical, and genetic contributions

Hogea, I. Mihai, A. Chiriță-Emandi
*Spitalul Clinic de Boli Infecțioase și Pneumoftiziologie Dr.Victor 
Babeș Timișoara, Romania
Background & objectives: We aim to present the clinical, cytopatho-
logical, and genetic evaluation of a 52-year-old female patient with a 
history of treated post-primary tuberculosis (TB), cavitary pulmonary 
aspergillosis, and bronchiectasis that presents with unexpected hem-
optysis, fever, and weight loss.
Methods: Chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and 
respiratory evaluations with additional bronchoscopy procedure for 
bronchial aspiration (BA), and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were per-
formed. Complete cytological evaluation with May–Grünwald–Giemsa 
(MGG) stain and special fungal stains were done on cytology smears 
from the BAL fluid. The pathological examination led to a genetics 
centre referral, in order to understand the precise diagnosis.
Results: HRCT showed a massive cavitary lesion with an intracavitary 
mass in the RUL extending to the superior segment of the RLL, 
suggestive of a mycetoma. BA microbiological analysis on GeneXpert 
MTB/RIF was negative for TB. BAL cytology was remarkable for 
neutrophil granulocytosis and MGG stained thin fungal hyphae, with 
septation, and acute-angle (45°), or dichotomous branching, confirmed 
with Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) and Grocott stain. Serologically, 
A. fumigatus IgG antibodies were positive. NGS on whole blood 
for suspicion of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) or 
Granulomatous disease showed 2 variants of uncertain significance 
(VUS) in the CFTR gene, that could be associated with cystic fibrosis, 
or a predisposition for bronchiectasis.
Conclusion: We present the complex case of respiratory disease, 
treated post-primary TB with reactivation, with initially complicated 
pulmonary aspergilloma, that presently showed an active superim-
posed chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis (CCPA). Genetic 
evaluation for a patient with recurrent and unexplained pulmonary 
infections could be helpful in the differential diagnosis. Underlying 
genetic causes in adults could predispose them to chronic infec-
tions and pulmonary disease entities. Finally, complex cases should 
include a multidisciplinary approach for the ultimate benefit of the 
patient.

M. Mauroeide, I. Vamvakaris
*General Hospital of Thoracic Diseases of Athens "Sotiria", 
Greece
Background & objectives: SSP is a generally benign entity, 
although it has been associated with metastasis to the regional 
nodes. This is a case seen mostly in adult female patients. 
Usually, is being detected as a small, solitary nodule on the chest 
x-ray film.
Methods: A 67 year-old female patient was referred to our hos-
pital with a history of cough and breathlessness. Chest x-ray 
showed a peripheral, well circumscribed, unique, pulmonary nod-
ule, measuring 1,8 cm in diameter. Wedge biopsy was performed.
Results: Grossly, the nodule was solid, tan or yellowish with 
occasionally cystic areas. Histologically, two cell types were 
distinguished among very sclerotic stroma. Hobnail looking 
cuboidal cells, resembling type II pneumocytes and arranging 
in a papillary and/or solid pattern with foci of haemorrhages 
[ TTF(+), EMA (+), CK7(+), SpBpr (+)] and a second com-
ponent, which is more prominent, that is round - oval, small 
stroma cells, that they grow in sheet like pattern, with fine 
chromatin nucleoli and sparse nuclear grooving [TTF-1(+), 
CK7 focally (+),CD34(-), S-100(-), CD1a(-), Langherin (-)] 
.The double cell population and the absence of atypia helps 
us in the differential diagnosis with malignant entities as a 
papillary adenocarcinoma
Conclusion: Sclerosing pulmonary pneumocytoma (SSP) is a 
rare benign lession, usually seen in females. Based on double cell 
population and the hyalinized stroma, the pathologists should 
always keep in mind this entity especially in frozen sections or on 
a small biopsy , since a benign diagnosis of SSP can make a great 
difference to the patient and to the surgent, and avoid a lobectomy.

Rare cases of coexistence of non-hodgkin lymphomas with lung 
carcinomas
O. Tzaida*, E. Souka, G. Galanopoulos, L. Karelis, N. Baltayannis, 
M. Kotsopoulou
*Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: During long term follow-up 1.2% 
of oncological patients may experience new unexpected primary 
malignant neoplasms. Synchronous occurrence of lung carcinoma and 
lymphoma is very rare, less than 1%.
We present two cases of non-Hodgkin B lymphomas coexisting 
with lung carcinomas.
Methods: A Case: A 68-year-old male with a past medical history 
of splenic marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), presented with right 
lung tumour and right thoracic wall lesion. He underwent right 
pneumonectomy and partial thoracic wall resection.
B case: A 77-year-old male with a medical history of MZL 
presented with left lung tumour. The patient underwent left 
pneumonectomy.
Results: A case: Microscopically, the lung tumour was lung 
adenocarcinoma, intermediate grade. The thoracic wall lesion 
was a lymphocytic proliferation consisting of medium size cells 
with abundant immunoblasts. Immunohistochemical examination 
revealed a CD20(+), BSAP(+), BCL2(+), BCL6(+), κ- light chain 
(+), phenotype. A diagnosis of a diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL), probably a transformation of the splenic MZL, 
coexisting with a primary lung adenocarcinoma was suggested.
B case: Microscopically, the tumour was a non-keratinizing 
squamous cell carcinoma, high grade with a coexisting small 
cell atypical lymphocytic proliferation. Immunohistochemical 
examination revealed a CD20(+), BSAP(+), BCL2(+), CD3(-), 
BCL6(-), cyc-d1(-) phenotype. A diagnosis of non-keratinizing 
squamous cell lung carcinoma coexisting with MZL was suggested.
Conclusion: Coexistence of lung carcinomas and lymphomas is very 
rare. Such co-occurrence has been documented on rare occasions and 
includes Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (mainly B- cell ori-

types of lung carcinomas. It is probably caused by genetic predilection, 
immunosuppression, infectious agents such as EBV and radiotherapy/ 
chemotherapy given for the treatment of the first neoplasm. The thera-
peutic management of such a combination requires separate considera-
tion of the different coexisting neoplasms.

Adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung - biopsy: MET exon 14 
skipping mutation
V. Sousa*, A. Alarcão, A. Ladeirinha, M. Reis Silva, T. Ferreira, 
A. Rodrigues, C. Vilasboas, L. Carvalho
*Institute of Anatomical and Molecular Pathology, Faculty of 
Medicine of the University of Coimbra; CIMAGO – Research 
Center for Environment, Genetics and Oncobiology, Faculty of 
Medicine, University of Coimbra; University Hospital Anatomical 
Pathology Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: MET exon14 skipping mutation 
(METex14) occurs in 3% in NSCLCs and coexists rarely with other 
oncogenic drivers. METex14/MET amplifications indicate poor 
prognosis.
Recent approvals of capmatinib and tepotinib for metastatic NSCL 
METex14 depend on this biomarker in metastatic NSCLC.
Methods: A 85-years-old woman - adenosquamous carcinoma of 
the lung (CK5.6/TTF1/ CK7 expression).
NGS and Idylla techniques - FFPE macrodissected tumoral tissue 
with 40% representation of tumoral cells from biopsy.
Oncomine Precision Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, 
MA, USA) was performed according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tion by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in Genexus. ­IdyllaTM 
Gene Fusion Assay performed according to manufacturer’s 
instruction.
Results: METex14 was detected by both techniques, Idylla and 
NGS.
NGS made it possible to identify C.3082G>C;p.(Asp1028His) 
mutation with 35% allelic frequency.
The two most clinically relevant MET alterations are METex14 
mutations as the primary oncogenic driver and MET amplification 
as acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI).
Conclusion: MET-TKIs, capmatinib and tepotinib, for NSCLCs 
with METex14 marked a new step of MET-targeted therapy.
METex14 alterations - point mutations/deletions/insertions/com-
plex mutations lead to MET receptor decreased degradation, fol-
lowed by MET signalling and tumourigenesis. The evaluation 
methods for METex14 include differential MET exon expression, 
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-
PCR) or direct RNA sequencing.
METex14 are the most commonly reported oncogenic MET 
mutations. MET mutations should be tested in the context of 
targeted therapy together with other molecular markers.

Swyer James MacLeod Syndrome: an uncommon phenomenon
I. Eremia*, C. Anghel, S. Nica
*University of Medicine Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Swyer James MacLeod syndrome is an 
uncommon lung condition characterized by pulmonary vascular reduc-
tion and alveolar hyperdistention, with or without bronchiectasis. The 
radiographic appearance of a single pulmonary lobe or the entire lung 
is characteristic of this rare lung ailment.
Methods: We present the case of a 43-year-old man who presented 
himself to the ER for: low fever and chills, dyspnea, wheezes, 
pleuritic chest pain and cough.
The patient was examined in the ER with EKG, blood tests, a 
chest radiograph, and a CT scan. The patient’s respiratory func-
tion was then assessed using spirometry in the internal medicine 
department.
Results: Chest radiograph: right apico-axillary-laterothoracic 
hypertransparency that causes passive collapse of the underlying 
parenchyma - pneumothorax. Cord enlarged by lengthening and 
accentuating the convexity of the lower left arch. Left pulmonary 
hilum with increased density and projection area; accentuation of 
peribronchovascular and basal interstitial pattern.
CT scan: multiple bubbles of emphysema, some with thick walls, 
at the level of both lung fields, predominantly on the right, the 
largest of about 9 / 8.5 cm. Right pulmonary sequestration of 9/4 
cm. Moderately enlarged heart. Without pleural or pericardial effu-
sions. Nonspecific mediastinal infracentimetric lymphadenopathy. 
Without changes in bone structure with oncological visa at the level 
of the scanned segment.
Conclusion: The cause of Swyer James MacLeod syndrome is not 
completely understood. It seems that the initial abnormality occurs 
in the distal bronchi after an infection during early childhood.
The clinic and the totality of the investigations carried out plead for 
the following diagnoses: Swyer James MacLeod syndrome (right 
pulmonary artery hypoplasia, bilateral diffuse pulmonary emphy-
sema, bilateral bronchiectasis), moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Treatment is conservative and preventative, focused primarily on 
controlling pulmonary infections. Inhaled corticosteroids may have 
a limited role in treatment.

A contemporary view at the pulmonary collapse
Y. Kirillov, D. Protsenko, A. Avdalyan, V. Sokov, S. Timofeev*
*Moscow MCC Kommunarka, Russia
Background & objectives: Atelectasis or pulmonary collapse is 
a common complication after upper body radiation therapy and 
may be clinically noticeable in up to 30% of cases. However, early 
morphological changes in the lung tissue are not well clear.
Methods: We researched early phases of pulmonary collapse in rats 
through radiation exposure in a dose of 12Gy on their chest. We 
took samples of lung tissue and bronchoalveolar washing (BAL) 
on the various days after exposure. We used electron microscopy 
(Zeiss-EVO-LS1), routine histology technique, morphometric anal-
ysis (Aperio AT2 and NIH ImageJ), and detected the surfactant 
level in BAL in our study.
Results: We detected initial signs of lung tissue damage by electron 
microscopy in 24 hours after exposure. Type-II pneumocytes 
appeared swelling and lamellar bodies looked damaged. Then we 
observed the significant decline of surfactant level on day-3. We 
identified atelectasis by light microscopy on the seventh day after 
the beginning the experiment. In most cases areas of pulmonary 
collapse were localized in the subpleural regions. Atelectatic area 
had been doubled in two weeks by adding intrapulmonary regions. 
By statistical analysis we revealed that changes of thickness of 
alveolar wall, square, and smooth muscle shortening of the airway 
had no significant role in the pulmonary collapse on day-7 but 
dominated on day-14.
Conclusion: In this research we found out that destruction of 
type II pneumocytes and following reducing the total amount of 
surfactant level played a key role in pulmonary collapse on day 
7. However, the morphometric changes in lung tissue such as

thickness of alveolar wall and smooth muscle shortening of air-
way contributed in the subsequent enlargement of atelectatic areas.

The relevance of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and androgen receptor 
expression in male vulnerability to COVID-19 infection

A. Degiovanni, G. Gaiba, P. Bertoglio, P. Solli, S. Damiani, A. 
D’Errico, M. Fiorentino
*Pathology Unit, University of Bologna Medical Center, Italy
Background & objectives: A sex-disparity in the outcome of patients 
with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed during the pandem-
ic’s first wave. We analyse these differences by evaluating the immu-
nohistochemical expressions of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Androgen 
Receptor(AR) within three groups: autoptic, asymptomatic and control.
Methods: Patients have been divided as follows:
- autoptic, died of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
- asymptomatic, secondarily testing positive for SARS-CoV-2
- control, detected pre-pandemic.
Each lung sample underwent histological and immunohistochemi-
cal evaluation for AR, TMPRSS2, ERG, and ACE2. SARS-CoV-2 
detection was performed through PCR and ISH. All clinical data 
were extracted from the patients’ medical records.
Results: ACE2 immunohistochemical expression resulted strong 
and membranous in the autoptic group. In both asymptomatic and 
control groups, the overall expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and AR 
was low or absent regardless of the gender or the PCR positivity 
for SARS-CoV-2. Immunohistochemical staining of TMPRSS2 was 
negative in all patients of all three groups, but interestingly the 
only 3 positive cases with an high expression also showed high 
levels of immunoreactivity for ACE2, confirming its role in the 
cleavage of ACE2.
AR expression in autoptic patients was difficult to assess, due to 
the postmortem lytic process. In addition to that, TMPRSS2:ERG 
gene fusion was not detected through immunohistochemical analy-
sis in all samples.
Conclusion: This study confirms the critical function of ACE2 in 
the viral pathogenicity of human tissues. A higher expression of 
ACE2 receptor, regardless of gender, was showed in the patients 
who died of SARS-CoV-2 complicated infection. Three autoptic 
patients showed also a stronger immunoreactivity for TMPRSS2 
associated to a stronger expression of ACE2, confirming its role 
in the cleavage and activation of ACE2.

Özdemir
*Başkent University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathol-
ogy, Ankara, Turkey
Background & objectives: Malignant pleural mesothelioma(MPM) is 
an aggressive malignant neoplasm associated with poor prognosis. Pro-
grammed cell death ligand 1,2 (PD-L1,PD-L2) are important immune 
checkpoints that can inhibit T cell activation. Here we investigated the 
prognostic value of PD-L1 and PD-L2 in MPM.
Methods: 91 patients who had a histological diagnosis of MPM 
made on pleural resection or biopsy at Baskent University between 
2006 and 2022 were included in the study. Clinical and histopatho-
logical data were collected from medical records. Tumour samples 
were analysed by immunohistochemistry for percentage of PD-L1 
and PD-L2. The results were correlated with clinical parameters 
and outcome.
Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 62±12.1 (range 35-87). 
The majority of patients were male (58, 63.7%). Most common 
histological type was epithelioid (77,84.6%), followed by 
sarcomatoid (10, 11%) and biphasic type (4, 4.4%). Among 91 
patients, 36 (39.6%) had positive PD-L1 expression and 55 (60.4%) 
had negative. On the other hand, forty-seven (51,6%) patients 
were PD-L2 positive and 44 (48,4%) were PD-L2 negative. The 
positive rate of PD-L1 and PD-L2 in epithelioid MPM was 33,7% 
and 50.6%, while the rates were 71,4% and 85,7 respectively in 
sarcomatoid and biphasic MPM (p<0.05). The median survival 
time of PD-L1 negative patients were 2,2 times longer than PD-L1 
positive ones.
Conclusion: The positive rate of PD-L1 and PD-L2 were found to be sig-
nificantly higher in sarcomatoid and biphasic types MPM, compared to 
epithelioid type. Also positive PD-L1 expression was found to be associated 
with lower median survival, while no significant association was found 
between PD-L2 and patient survival. Therefore, PD-L1 expression levels 
can be used to determine the prognosis of MPM patients, which may lead 
to treatment options for PD-L1.

Performance of AmoyDx HER2 mutation detection kit and 
AmoyDx Pan Lung Cancer PCR Panel for detection of com-
mon HER2 and/or EGFR mutations
M. Sheng*, H. Brown, S. Dearden
*AstraZeneca, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: HER2/ERBB2 mutations occur in 2-4% 
of NSCLC patients and clinical trials are assessing the efficacy of anti-
HER2-antibody drug conjugate (ADC) therapeutics in NSCLC patients 
with HER2 mutations. We assessed the performance of two PCR assays 
for detection of HER2 mutations.
Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cell 
blocks containing HER2 indel A775_G776insYVMA or single 
nucleotide variant V777L were generated at allele frequencies 
of 0%, 1%, 5% or 50%. Performance of AmoyDx HER2 
Mutation Detection Kit was assessed for both mutations (n=3). 
AmoyDx Pan Lung Cancer PCR Panel was assessed for A775_
G776insYVMA in cell blocks (n=3) and EGFR exon19 deletions/
L858R in 4 NSCLC samples.
Results: AmoyDx HER2 Mutation Detection Kit demonstrated a 
100% pass rate at the recommended 10ng input DNA for HER2 
A775_G776insYVMA and V777L at allele frequency ≥1%, with 
no false positives. The AmoyDx Pan Lung Cancer PCR Panel 
does not cover the V777L mutation but showed similar accuracy 
and sensitivity to the HER2 Mutation Detection Kit for the A775_
G776insYVMA indel, providing the correct amount of input DNA 
was used. The panel also correctly identified EGFR exon19 deletions 
and L858R mutations in the four clinical samples tested.
Conclusion: Detection of rare mutations require sensitive and 
specific diagnostic assays. AmoyDx HER2 Mutation Detection 
Kit demonstrated robust performance in detecting representa-
tive HER2 indel and single nucleotide variant mutations at low 
frequencies. The AmoyDx Pan Lung Cancer PCR assay showed 
similarly robust and sensitive detection of the common HER2 
A775_G776insYVMA indel in addition to detecting clinically 
relevant EGFR mutations.
Funding: This study is funded by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals. 
In March 2019, AstraZeneca entered into a global development 
and commercialization collaboration agreement with Daiichi 
Sankyo for trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd; DS-8201).

Granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD) 
in CTLA-4 deficiency: case report
M.L. Abascal*, C. Vieru, S. Osorio, J. Gil, F.J. Menarguez, F.J. 
Díaz Crespo
*Hospital Gregorio Marañon, Spain
Background & objectives: CTLA-4 deficiency was first described 
in 2014, currently categorized as immune dysregulation, with 
autoimmunity, immunodeficiency and lymphoid destruction (IDAIL). 
One of the main clinical manifestations is granulomatous interstitial 
lymphocytic lung disease (GLILD).
Methods: We report a case of 20 year old woman with history 
of multiple lymphadenopathies, ITP, hemophagocytic syndrome, 
and recurrent infections. A CT scan was performed due to fever 
and poor condition, showing bilateral pulmonary nodules, sug-
gestive of lymphomatoid granulomatosis, deciding to perform 
lung biopsies.
Results: Histologic examination revealed the presence of lym-
phoid infiltrates with peribronchiolar distribution, forming 
nodular lymphoid hyperplasic aggregates (in pseudotumor pat-
tern lesions). Abundant histiocytes and multinucleated giant 
cells without granulomas nor Masson bodies were found. Immu-
nohistochemical stains confirm mixed lymphoid cellularity B 
(CD20+) and T (CD3), predominantly CD4+ T-cells. EBER 
was negative. Microbiological elements were not identified with 
histochemical techniques and the study of IGH and TCR-gene 
rearrangements was polyclonal. Given the clinical suspicion of 
immunodeficiency, Sanger sequencing was completed, detecting 
a heterozygous mutation in the germ line of the CTLA4 gene. 
Final diagnosis was granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung 
disease (GLILD).
Conclusion: GLILD is characterized by the presence of noncaseat-
ing granulomas and recurrent lymphoid. However, there is no con-
sensus regarding diagnostic and therapeutic criteria, with a wide 
spectrum of histological patterns with or without the presence of 
granuloma being described in the literature, including diffuse and 
nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, non-follicular lymphoid aggregates, 
follicular bronchiolitis and organizing pneumonia, like the ones 
we can observe in our case. As it is a non-specific entity with low 
reproducibility, the term of GLILD is not recommended.

Correlation of programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1) expres-
sion with clinicopathological features in lung carcinoma in a 
Macedonian population
B. Ognenoska-Jankovska*, N. Basheska
*University Clinic of Radiotherapy and Oncology Skopje, North 
Macedonia
Background & objectives: : Programmed death ligand 1(PD-L1) 
expression is a predictive biomarker of the success of immunotherapy 
for lung cancer(LC) patients, yet its prognostic significance remains 
unclear. This study aims to determine the relationship between PD-L1 
expression and clinicopathological features in LCpatients.
Methods: The expression of PD-L1 protein in 63 surgically 
resected LC was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using clone 
22C3 (Agilent, DAKO). The PD-L1 expression was determined 
by the Tumour Proportion Score (TPS) and classified as nega-
tive (TPS<1%), low-expression (TPS=1-49%) and high-expression 
(TPS≥50%). The statistical significance of the correlation between 
the clinicopathological features and PD-L1 expression was deter-
mined by chi-square test.
Results: Our study group comprised 52 male and 11 female patients, 
with a median age of 64 (range,33-77). 33(52.4%) of the patients exhib-
ited PD-L1 immuno-positivity, with 23(36%) of them having a low-
expression and 10(16.6%) having a high-expression of PD-L1. PD-L1 
immunopositivity was significantly higher in squamous cell carcinomas 
(18/25;72%) compared to adenocarcinomas (10/25;40%)(p=0.023). 
PD-L1 expression was associated with the smoking status (p=0.0086) 
for the patients smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day, as well as with 
a higher level (>30%) of stromal tumour infiltrate lymphocytes (TILs)
(p=0.049). No correlation was found between PD-L1 expression and 
other parameters such as patients’ age, gender, stage, tumour status, 
grade, lymph nodal status and lymphovascular invasion.
Conclusion: This is the first local study to describe PD-L1 expres-
sion and its association with clinicopathological features in LC 
patients. Our preliminary results indicate that the PD-L1 protein 
expression in LC is associated with some clinicopathological 
characteristics, such as smoking status, histological type (higher 
expression in squamous cell carcinomas) and higher level of TILs. 
Further research should be performed to clarify the clinical rel-
evance and prognostic significance of PD-L1 in LC patients.

Infantile fibrosarcoma with EGFR rearrangement
K.E. Akar*, E. Çeşmecioğlu Karavin, M. Say, H.K. Türköz
*Marmara University Pendik Training and Research Hospital 
Department of Pathology, Istanbul, Turkey
Background & objectives: Infantile fibrosarcoma is a malignant fibro-
blastic tumour of infants. It is a rapidly growing, locally aggressive 
tumour characterized by t(12;15)(p13;q25), resulting ETV6-NTRK3 
fusion gene. Rare fusion partners of NTRK3 or NTRK1 fusions were 
also reported in infantile fibrosarcoma.
Methods: RNA was isolated from 50-μm formalin fixed paraffin 
embedded tissues for Archer™ FusionPlex Sarcoma v2 targeted 
sequencing assay (ArcherDX, USA). This assay targeted fusions 
/ mutations in 63 genes. A prepared library was sequenced using 
Illumina (NextSeq 500 Illumina Inc.) Next-Generation Sequencer 
(NGS). Produced libraries were analysed for presence of relevant 
fusion with the Archer analysis software version 6.2.7.
Results: A three-month-old female patient presented with a 
mass in the right axillary region. CT examination revealed a 
soft tissue mass in axillary lodge, with invasion to ribs. Gross 
examination revealed a firm, tumour with the largest diameter 
of 5,4 cm. Microscopic examination revealed a hypercellular 
tumour composed of fascicles of relatively uniform spindle 
cells with mild atypia with frequent mitotic figures. Focal 
herringbone pattern was present. NGS showed no mutations in 
NTRK gene while rearrangement was observed in EGFR gene 
(fusion between exon 18 and exon 25). The case was reported 
as infantile sarcoma with EGFR mutation. This mutation has 
been reported only in four patients of infantile fibrosarcoma 
previously.
Conclusion: Infantile fibrosarcoma is a tumour classically known 
to be characterized by ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion, may have other 
genetic mutations including EGFR gene rearrangement. Prognostic 
significance of this new mutation is yet unknown.

*Marmara University Pendik Training and Research Hospital 
Department of Pathology, Istanbul, Turkey
Background & objectives: Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma is 
a malignant mesenchymal tumour of uncertain differentiation. These 
tumours are characterized by frequent fusion of the NR4A3 gene with 
the EWSR1. Extraskeletal chondrosarcoma involving NR4A3-PRRC1 
fusion has not been reported before in the literature.
Methods: Following routine formaline fixation and tissue pro-
cessing, parafin embedded tissues were used for immunohisto-
chemical analysis and next generation sequencing. RNA based 
“Archer® FusionPlex Sarcoma v2” (ArcherDX, Inc) was used to 
analyse fusions and point mutations in 63 different genes, including 
NR4A3, in next generation analysis.
Results: A 35 years-old female patient presented with weakness 
in the right leg. On physical examination, a swelling of 8x6cm 
was detected in the right gluteal region. MRI scan revealed a 
156x136mm mass surrounding the right iliac crest and an addi-
tional 38x35mm mass at the T12 vertebra level extending into the 
dural distance. Trucut biopsy revealed a myxoid chondrosarcoma. 
After 5 cycles of chemotherapy, the patient underwent a right hemi-
pelvectomy. Microscopic examination of the resected specimen 
revealed cords-formed by uniform cells in a myxoid background. 
NSE and CD117 focally positive in immunohistochemical study. 
NGS showed fusion of PRRC1 gene with NR4A3 gene. The case 
was reported as extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma.
Conclusion: Along with the previously reported frequent EWSR1 
and other rare fusion partners, PRRC1 can also be a fusion partner 
of NR4A3 in extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma.

Two separate metastatic tumours synchronized in the lung: 
alveolar soft part sarcoma and leiomyosarcoma
M. Aydemir*, N. Büyükpınarbaşılı
*Health Sciences University Umraniye, Turkey
Background & objectives: The lung is a site of widespread metastatic 
disease, one of the common sites of soft tissue sarcomas. We presented 
our case because the presence of simultaneous alveolar soft part 
sarcoma and leimyosarcoma metastases in the lung is rare in the 
literature.
Methods: A 34-year-old female patient was admitted to the pul-
monary medicine outpatient clinic due to hemoptysis. Multiple 
lesions were observed in the lower lobes of both lungs in thorax 
computed tomography. A total of 4 tumoral foci with two different 
morphologies were observed in the resection.
Results: Microscopically, two of these tumours were spindle cell 
and the other two were epithelioid with clear/granular cytoplasm. 
An epithelioid-like tumoral infiltrate with nodules, alveolar pattern, 
some clear and some pink granular cytoplasm was observed in 
the parenchyma. In the immunohistochemical and histochemical 
examination, the epithelioid tumour was positive for TFE-3, and 
cytoplasmic granular material was positive with PAS and D-PAS. In 
patient’s history he had been diagnosed with alveolar soft part sarcoma 
in the left thigh 12 years ago and leimyosarcoma 2 years ago nearthe 
first lesion. Examination of morphological and IHC profile, it was 
reported as leiomyosarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma metastasis.
Conclusion: In the presence of multiple tumours in the lung, it 
should be kept in mind that there may be different primary tumours 
or tumour metastases, and all foci should be evaluated.

Atypical spindle cell lipomatous tumour: a rare case report
J. Baena-Del Valle*, D.M. Bertel-Rodriguez, M.A. Palau-Lazaro
*Fundacion Santa Fe De Bogota, Universidad De Los Andes, 
Colombia
Background & objectives: Atypical Spindle Cell / Pleomorphic 
Lipomatous Tumour (ASCLT) are recently described neoplasms, 
characterized by lipoma-like appearance but with atypical and 
spindle cell histological features. They resemble pleomorphic 
lipoma, but are larger in size and with a broader anatomic 
distribution.
Methods: We present a 34-year-old woman with a 10 x 8 x 3 
cm mass in the right knee. A biopsy reported a lipomatous lesion 
and a resection was performed. Microscopy showed a lipomatous 
neoplasm with predominantly well-differentiated adipocytic com-
ponent, and a smaller proportion of lipoblasts and pleomorphic 
cells in a fibrous matrix. No necrosis and mitosis were identified.
Results: Tumour cells were positive for CD34 and S100, and negative for 
MDM2 and CDK4. The case was sent for consultation to Dr Christopher 
Fletcher, supporting the diagnosis of ASCLT. No recurrence has been 
reported so far.
ASCLT mostly occur in middle-aged adults with a slight male pref-
erence and a variable size (up to 28 cm). They have an indolent 
behaviour with no or very low rate of local recurrence, and no risk 
for dedifferentiation or metastasis.
Conclusion: It is crucial to differentiate ASCLT from other lipo-
matous lesions such as atypical lipomatous tumour/well-differ-
entiated liposarcoma, pleomorphic liposarcoma and low-grade 
dedifferentiated liposarcoma, due to their frequent recurrence and 
capacity to metastasize. Immunohistochemistry helps in this situ-
ation, since even though weak and focal expression of MDM2 and 
CDK4 may be seen, they do not occur in combination. Also, loss 
of Rb expression is frequently seen (79%).

Development of epithelioid angiosarcoma as a rare and new 
complication of retained surgical gauze
M. Bara*, F. Almarii, V. Enache
*University Emergency Hospital Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Epithelioid angiosarcoma (EA) is a rare 
endothelial cell malignancy. The aetiology is unknown and association 
with implanted foreign bodies is very rare. We present a case of a 47 year-
old woman with EA developed on a long-standing retained surgical gauze.
Methods: A 47 year old woman with history of surgery for an ovarian 
cyst 19 years ago, presented with abdominal pain and constipation for 
at least 4 days. Clinical examination revealed diffuse tenderness and 
pain in the lower abdomen and peritoneal signs. Computed tomography 
(CT) showed a pelvic mass with necrosis and fecaloid content, multiple 
liver masses and extensive abdominal lymphadenopathy.
Results: Gross examination of the surgical specimen revealed 40 cm 
bowel loops with extensive adhesions, centred by a solid mass of a 
10x8 cm tumour with a central cystic cavity containing surprisingly a 
macerated surgical gauze. A fragment of greater omentum with multi-
ple nodules and a mesenteric lymph node were also received.
Histologic examination revealed extensive necrosis with a 
proliferation of pleomorphic epithelioid cells in a storiform 
pattern and irregular sheets, focally forming anastomosing 
channels containing few red blood cells. The gauze fibres were 
also observed. At immunohistochemical examination, the tumour 
cells showed diffuse expression of CD31, ERG and D2-40. The 
omentum and the mesenteric lymph node presented also metastatic 
deposits.

Conclusion: Although the presence of implanted foreign materials 
such as: Dacron and plastic grafts, steel plate and bone wax, retained 
for prolonged periods is known to be very rarely in association with 
the development of angiosarcomas, there are no cases reported in the 
literature regarding the association with retained surgical gauzes. Like 
all the abdominal textilomas, a highly aggressive cancer arising around 
a retained surgical gauze is a serious medico-legal problem leading to 
a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate.

A. Bdioui, S. Hmissa
*Pathology department, Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Solitary fibrous tumour (SFT) is a rare 
neoplasm arising most commonly in the thoracic cavity. Those occur-
ring in the head and neck represent 10% of all cases. We report a case 
of malignant SFT of the mandibula with literature review.
Methods: We report a case of a 73-year-old man, presented with 
a history of swelling in his lower jaw for the past six months. On 
examination, the mass was painless, nodular, measuring 1,5cm in 
great dimension and expanding to the soft palate. The computed 
tomography scan revealed a destructive soft tissue mass. The 
patient underwent a surgical resection.
Results: Macroscopically, the mass was firm, lobulated and gray-
white in colour with haemorrhage. Microscopically, the tumour 
consisted of spindle cells arranged in long, interlacing fascicles and 
whorls. The cells showed moderate atypia. The mitotic range was 
6 mitoses / 10 high power fields. The cells grew around dilated, 
branched thin walled vessels. The surgical margins were positive.
Immunohistochemically, tumour cells stained positive for CD34 
and STAT6. They were negative for PS-100, β-catenin, Erg, 
smooth-muscle actin and desmin. Based on these histological and 
immunopathological findings, the diagnosis of malignant solitary 
fibrous tumour of the mandibula was made.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of malignant solitary fibrous tumour 
of the mandibula might be challenging for pathologists. Awareness 
of it’s occurrence in this atypical site is crucial in order to prevent 
confusion with other spindle cells neoplasms.

A. Baccouche, S. Hmissa
*Pathology Department, Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: The association between osteosarcoma and 
hyperparathyroidism is very rare, only 10 cases have been reported in 
the literature to our knowledge. Herein we report an uncommon case of 
osteosarcoma in women with primary hyperparathyroidism.
Methods: A 39-year-old female presented to our hospital 
for a subtrochanteric femoral fracture through a lytic lesion. 
She underwent resection of the bone lesion and the fracture 
was immobilised. The surgical specimen was analysed in the 
department of pathology.
Results: The pathological examination showed an undifferentiated 
tumour composed of pleomorphic, epithelioid and spindle cells 
producing osteoid matrix in a lace-like arrangement.
The diagnosis of high-grade osteoblastic osteosarcoma was made.
Afterwards, she was referred to an oncologist for chemotherapy. 
In the meantime, she experienced a remarkable remission of left 
hip pain. A computed tomography scan was performed and showed 
osteolytic lesions of left hip and L5 vertebra.
Therefore, the patient was managed by an endocrinologist who 
discovered primary hyperparathyroidism with an elevated serum 
calcium and parathyroid hormone.
Conclusion: The patient in the present report provides one more 
clinicopathological example of an osteosarcoma in association with 
hyperparathyroidism.
In light of the increased use of parathormone for treating 
osteoporosis, we should be aware of possible coexistence between 
these two conditions.

Anastomosing haemangioma: report of 3 cases with molecular 
and immunohistochemical studies
Y. Chang Chien*, A. Mokánszki, L. Beke, G. Méhes
*Dept. of Pathology, University of Debrecen, Clinical Center, 
Hungary
Background & objectives: Anastomosing haemangioma (AH) is a 
newly described distinct vascular neoplasm that, histologically, may 
confuse with well-differentiated angiosarcoma (AS) for those who are 
unfamiliar with this rare entity.
Methods: We aimed to identify the molecular genetic differences 
between AHs and ASs by carrying out immunohistochemistry 
(IHC), fluorescence in  situ hybridization (FISH), and next-
generation sequencing (NGS) analysis from three AHs and three 
ASs
Results: Immunohistochemically, all six cases showed 
positivity for cyclin D1 and pERK. The three AH case results 
were weakly positive for p53 and MIB-1, whereas the IHCs 
for HIF-1α were negative in all three cases. Those three cases 
of angiosarcoma revealed strong, diffuse positivity for p53, 
50-70% for MIB-1, and multifocal, moderate-to-strong HIF-1α 
expression. To further clarify the difference of p53 expression, 
we carried out a FISH which revealed polysomy in all three AS 
cases; genetic aberration was absent in the AH group. In one 
AH case, the GNA11 c.627G>T; p.Q209H nucleotide variant 
was detected.
Conclusion: We demonstrated three cases of anastomosing 
haemangiomas with one case harbouring a GNA11 mutation 
which, besides conforming to its clonal nature, also serves 
as an important molecular signature to distinguish AHs 
from well-differentiated ASs. We also addressed the 
potential molecular differences between these two entities. 
Nevertheless, due to the small sample size and its rarity, a 
larger scale study is needed to elucidate this issue. Clinical 
information and histology features still serve as the gold 
standard for the correct diagnosis.

mesenchymal tumours including liposarcoma, extraskeletal 
myxoid chondroscarcoma and myoepithelial tumours. 
Understanding its pseudosarcomatous histological features and 
appropriate clinico-radiological correlation is key to avoiding 
this diagnostic pitfall.
Methods: We describe the morphological features of a rare, 
extensively cystic chondroid lipoma occurring in the trunk of 
an adult female on frozen and paraffin sections. In addition, we 
performed molecular analysis using anchored multiplex PCR 
assay (Archer FusionPlex® Sarcoma Panel) for gene fusion 
detection.
Results: Incisional biopsy submitted for frozen section 
interpretation showed sheets and cords of large, round 
to epithelioid tumour cells with vacuolated cytoplasm 
and nuclear atypia, initially worrisome for an aggressive 
tumour. The presence of lipoblasts, myxohyaline matrix 
and mature adipocytes were better appreciated on 
subsequent paraffin sections. Gene fusion analysis revealed 
the presence of a C11orf95 (exon 5) – MKL2 (exon 12) 
gene rearrangement, further supporting the diagnosis of a 
chondroid lipoma.
Conclusion: Frozen section evaluation of chondroid lipomas 
present diagnostic challenges. Detection of MKL2 gene fusion is 
helpful in distinguishing this rare pseudosarcomatous entity from 
its morphologic differentials and in guiding appropriate patient 
management.

Post-denosumab morphological and immunohistochemical 
findings in giant cell tumour of bone – is there a risk for 
malignancy?
A. Cohn*, D.M. Pop
*Emergency University Hospital, Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Giant cell tumour of bone (GCT) is an 
intermediate and locally aggressive neoplasm. This study aims to 
emphasize the morphological and immunohistochemical features in a 
GCT treated with denosumab for 12 months and to assess the risk of 
malignant transformation.
Methods: We present the case of a 22-year-old female, admitted 
to “Foisor” Orthopedics Hospital for pain in the left knee. Imaging 
examination revealed a lytic lesion with benign features expanding 
the proximal epiphysis of the left fibula and a biopsy was taken. 
The histopathologic aspects were those of a giant cell tumour of 
bone associated with a secondary aneurysmal bone component.
Results: Covid-19 restrictions in the hospital led to prolonged neo-
adjuvant treatment with denosumab (15 doses). After one year of 
therapy, en-bloc resection of the proximal fibula was performed. 
Grossly, the tumour was well-defined and measured 6.5/4/2.5 cm.
Extensive microscopic examination of the surgical specimen 
showed complete disappearance of the osteoclastic component, new 
bone formation, and a densely cellular stromal-like proliferation of 
spindle cells with osteoid deposition. The tumour was completely 
circumscribed by new bone formation. The neoplastic stromal-like 
cells were positive for MDM2 immunohistochemical stain. The 
correlation between the histopathologic features and immunohisto-
chemical results made us conclude that a low-grade osteosarcoma 
has developed under the long-term treatment with denosumab.
Conclusion: Malignant transformation occurring in denosumab-
treated GCT of bone has rarely been reported. In our case, the 
osteosarcoma-like features observed on the surgical specimen 
and the MDM2 immunohistochemical positivity confirmed the 
malignancy. Therefore, close follow-up was recommended. This 
case report is consistent with observations made by other authors 
who have definitively found malignant transformation after long-
term treatment with denosumab in GCT.

Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumour - a potential diagnostic 
pitfall
A. Dumitru*, M. Sajin, M. Costache, B. Crețu, C. Cîrstoiu
*Carol Davila University of Medicine, Romania
Background & objectives: Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumour 
is an locally aggressive uncommon soft tissue neoplasm which com-
monly occurs in the ankle and foot. Morphologic data suggests that 
hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumour is related to yet another rare, 
locally aggressive tumour: pleomorphic hyalinizing angiectatic tumour.
Methods: A 61-year-old man was referred to the Department of 
Orthopaedics and Traumatology of the University Emergency Hos-
pital in Bucharest for a volumetric increase of a left foot mass 
which in recent months had begun to cause functional discom-
fort. After thorough investigation it was decided to opt for surgical 
option. The surgical sample was sent the Pathology Department for 
histopathological assessment.
Results: Microscopically, the lesion was composted of clusters of 
variably sized, thick walled blood vessels surrounded by a thick rim 
hyalin. The tumour cells were arranged in poorly defined fascicles 
with abudent brown pigment (hemosiderin), and nuclear pseudo 
inclusions. At the periphery, the lesion showed a pseudo infiltrative 
pattern of growth. There were not cytological atypia and mitotic 
figures but bizarre-looking tumour cells and rare multinucleated 
cells have been observed. From the immunohistochemical point of 
view, we found that the lesion was strongly and diffusely positive 
for CD34, while it was negative for SOX10, Calretinin and S-100. 
Few tumour cells were calponin positive. The proliferation index 
(evalued by KI67) was <3%.
Conclusion: To conclude, though rare, it is important for the 
histopathologists to be aware and recognize this unusual entity 
and distinguish it from other pigmented spindle cell lesions. 
Long term follow-up is recommended as rare cases of malignant 
transformations were reported.

*Hospital Universitario “Virgen de la Arrixaca”, Spain
Background & objectives: Lipoblastoma is a rare benign neoplasm 
predominantly diagnosed during infancy. It can remain asymptomatic 
for years and be a casual finding in the adult, causing diagnostic 
pitfalls. We present a case of an adult lipoblastoma with an unusual 
presentation.
Methods: A 34 year-old male presented with a neck and 
upper thorax mass. Ultrasound examination revealed a solid 
heterogeneous tumour. The specimen was a well-defined 
encapsulated nodule. Cut surface was solid, lobulated, yellow-
white and myxoid. Tumour consisted of adipocytes in different 
stages of maturation, with atypia, lipoblasts and branching vessels. 
Stroma was myxoid. Neoplastic cells were CD34+, p16+ and 
MDM2-.
Results: Lipoblastoma is a benign neoplasm of embryonal white 
fat predominantly localized in the trunk and the extremities. In 
S338
Virchows Archiv (2022) 481 (Suppl 1):S1–S364

our case, lipoblastoma was found in the anterior neck and into the 
upper thorax.
Grossly, cut surface is soft, lobulated, yellow-white and can show 
myxoid areas, cystic spaces or well-delimited fat nodules. Histo-
logically, lipoblastoma consists of lobules of adipocytes in vari-
ous stages of maturation. Adipocytes are positive for CD34 and 
S100 whereas mesenchymal cells stain for desmin. These cells are 
separated by fibrous septa and plexiform vessels. Several genetic 
alterations have been described. Molecular analysis didn’t demon-
strate PLAG gene rearrangement, but this is not mandatory for the 
diagnosis of lipoblastoma.
Conclusion: Lipoblastoma is a benign neoplasm of embryonal 
white fat of which rare cases have been reported in adults. 
Lipoblastoma can cause diagnostic pitfalls with other adipocytic 
neoplasms (particulary myxoid liposarcoma), requiring molecular 
studies for diagnostic confirmation. Detection of molecular 
alterations such as PLAG gene rearrangement are desirable but 
not mandatory. Prognosis after excision is excellent, with no risk 
of metastasization and low rates of recurrence after complete 
excision.

Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma: a case series of a rare vas-
cular neoplasm

Bdioui, H. Hamchi, S. Hmissa
*Pathology Department, Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma (EHE) 
is an extremely rare malignant proliferation, accounting for <1% of all 
the vascular tumours. It’s locally-aggressive, affecting one or multiple 
organs (such as soft tissues, lung, liver and bones). Herein, we aim to 
describe its clinico-pathological features.
Methods: All cases of EHE diagnosed during a 24 year-period 
(1997-2021) and compiled by the Cancer Registry of the Center of 
Tunisia, which provided clinical data and pathological reports. 4 
cases were included in our study.
Results: Three patients were male and one was a female. Patients’ 
age ranged from 38 to 67 years (mean age 47). The female patient 
had Von Recklinghausen disease. Two tumours , identified by 
imaging studies , developed in the vertebral bones, one in the lung 
and one in soft tissue of the thumb. Histologically, they displayed 
strands, cords and solid nests of epithelioid cells with vacuolated 
cytoplasm and mild nuclear atypia, set in a myxo-hyaline stroma . 
In 2 cases, nuclei showed promiment nucleoli, marked atypia and 
high mitotic-rate. The lung EHE displayed micro-calcifications and 
focal necrosis. In Immunochemistry, tumour cells expressed CD34 
in all cases and ERG in one case.
Conclusion: EHE is a rare aggressive tumour, with unknown 
pathogenesis, that is often misdiagnosed because of its atypical 
presentation and morphological similarities with other epithelioid 
vascular neoplasms, such as haemangiomas and angiosarcomas. 
When available, the molecular profile of these tumours should be 
explored as almost all EHEs harbour WWTR1-CAMTA1 or YAP1-
TFE3 fusions; and identifying these alterations may, in the future, 
benefit the patients with immunotherapy and selective inhibitors 
treatments.

*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário, Portugal
Background & objectives: Giant cell tumour (GCT) of the bone is 
a locally aggressive and rarely metastasizing neoplasm. Some cases 
may be treated with denosumab and may exhibit important histologi-
cal changes. Our goal was to characterize the histology of GCT after 
denosumab treatment.
Methods: A retrospective study included 5 patients submitted to 
neoadjuvant treatment with denosumab between 2019 and 2022 
and subsequent surgical resection.
Clinical and pathological parameters, including the duration of 
treatment, gender, age at diagnosis, location, histologic descrip-
tion and percentage of tumour response were recorded.
Results: According to location, tumour developed in the radius 
(in two), fibula (1), vertebral column (1) and acetabulum (1). The 
median duration of the treatment was 7 months (4-9 months). 
Tumour response was complete in four, and in one, up to 40% of 
tumour was viable. After a median follow-up of 5 months (1-22 
months) one patient relapsed, 7 months after surgery.
Histologically, there was replacement of the tumour by woven 
bone and fibrous tissue was found between the trabeculae. 
There was a general decrease in the number of giant cells, which 
were absent in four patients. In one the histological appearance 
mimetized an osteosarcoma.
Conclusion: Denosumab inhibits RANKL and thus reduces bone 
lysis, which helps control the disease.
This drug induces morphological changes in bone histology that 
ought to be recognized in order to make the differential diagnosis 
with its mimics, which include malignant lesions.

Lipoma arborescens of the knee: report of a rare case
S. Graja*, M. Mellouli, O. Boudawara, M. Triki, C. Chaari, N. 
Gouiaa, T. Boudawara, R. Kallel
*Department of Pathology, Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, 
Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Lipoma arborescens (LA) is a relatively 
unusual benign intra-articular lesion, with only few cases reported 
in the literature. The knee is the most commonly involved joint. The 
aim of the study is to discuss clinicopathological features of this rare 
disease.
Methods: An 80-year-old Women was presented to the depart-
ment of orthopaedic surgery with gradually increasing pain and 
swelling in the left knee.
Results: On examination, there was a diffuse swelling of the 
left knee, which was doughy in consistency with limited range 
of movements. There was no history of trauma. An arthrotomy 
was performed with a total synovectomy and resection of 
hypertrophic multilobulated synovial tissue. The histological 
examination revealed hypertrophic villous projections of fat 
lined by synovial cells with variable scattered inflammatory 
cells. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient 
had good range of movements over left knee without recurrence 
in 3 months of follow up period.
Conclusion: LA is a lipomatous proliferation of subsynovial con-
nective tissue often associated with chronic joint disease. It affects 
typically adults aged in fourth and fifth decades of life. It commonly 
involves the knee. The aetiology remains unclear. Recent work has 
shown that this adipocytic proliferation lacks HMGA2 overexpres-
sion. Recurrence is uncommon. LA should always be considered

in the spectrum of differential diagnosis when clinicians deal with 
chronic swelling of a joint. MRI findings are characteristic. Early 
synovectomy offers best functional outcome.

The cytotoxic properties of graphene derivatives and 2-metox-
yestradiol / graphene compound on human melanoma (A375) 
and osteosarcoma (143B) cell lines

M. Gorska-Ponikowska
*Dept. of Pathology and Neuropathology, Medical University of 
Gdansk, Poland
Background & objectives: The objective was to assess and confirm 
cytotoxic properties of graphene derivatives (graphene oxide and 
reduced graphene oxide) and compound of 17-beta-estradiol metabo-
lite with graphene on selected malignant cell lines with safety for the 
nonmalignant cells (fibroblasts).
Methods: Human melanoma (A375), osteosarcoma (143B) and 
fibroblast (HDF) cell lines were incubated with 2-metoxyestradiol, 
graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide solutions for 24 hours. 
Cytotoxicity as well as cell viability and proliferation potential 
was later assessed through MTT test and under microscope with 
additional immunostaining. Oxidative stress was analysed by Elisa 
assay.
Results: Our in  vitro studies confirm the stronger cytotoxic 
activity of 2-methoxyestradiol-graphene complexes compared 
to 2-methoxyestradiol sole activity against melanoma and 
osteosarcoma cells in analysed samples.
The results are promising as we observe a selective cytotoxic effect 
on tumour cells, in contrast to normotypic fibroblast cells which 
remain intact. These results also show that there is no toxic effect 
in relation to healthy tissues, and that it is toxic in relation to 
neoplastic tissues, which is the goal of all oncological therapies. 
The mechanism of action of 2-metoxyestradiol/ graphene oxide 
is related to the induction of oxidative stress in malignant cells.
Conclusion: Researchers are looking for substances efficient 
against malignancies and safe for the nonmalignant tissue. 
Cytotoxic properties of 2-methoxyestradiol and graphene 
derivatives were confirmed in separate in  vitro tests against 
various malignancies. Graphene may be used as a carrier for 
other antineoplasmatic drugs, improves bioavailability, but 
its nanocomposite tags are also suitable for bioimaging and 
confirmation of drug delivery to the affected tissue as well. It 
all gives opportunity to use this type of materials in bio-nano-
technology and personalized therapy.

Spindle cell lipoma with ossification mimicking atypical lipo-
matous tumour/well-differentiated liposarcoma
J. Ichikawa, T. Kawasaki, H. Imada*, A. Enomoto, N. Taniguchi, 
R. Tatsuno, S. Kanno, H. Haro
*Saitama Medical University, Japan
Background & objectives: Spindle cell lipoma (SCL) is a subtype of 
lipoma, but the characteristics of SCL are observed in both lipoma-
tous and non-lipomatous tumours. In this article, we present a case of 
SCL with ossification mimicking atypical lipomatous tumours/well-
differentiated liposarcomas (ALTs/WDLs).
Methods: A 56-year-old man presented with a mass on the 
lateral side of the right distal thigh. Plain radiography showed 
a soft tissue mass with a high fat density and ossification. MRI 
revealed high and diffuse low signals on a T1-weighted sagittal 
image, heterogeneous low signal on T2 short tau inversion recovery 
images, and diffuse enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced 
T1-weighted axial image.
Results: Needle biopsy findings suggested lipoma or ALT/WDL. 
Marginal resection with tumour capsule intact was performed. 
Macroscopically, the tumour was 8x5.5x2 cm in size, and the edge 
of the tumour was white owing to ossification. Histologically, the 
tumour consisted of ropey collagen bundles containing mature adi-
pocytes and spindle cells without atypia. There was no fat necrosis 
in the tumour or malignant osteoid tissue in the ossified region. 
Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for CD34, hetero-
geneous deficiency in spindle cell, and positive staining in ossified 
region for RB1, and negative staining for MDM2 and CDK4. Fluo-
rescence in-situ hybridization showed no amplification of MDM2. 
One year after surgery, the patient remains free of recurrence.
Conclusion: We described an atypical case of SCL with ossifica-
tion. SCLs are pathologically classified as classic, fibrous, myxoid, 
low-fat, pseudoangiomatous or fat-rich, and all 6 classes have vari-
ous signals on MRI. Furthermore, differentiating between ALT/
WDL and SCL is challenging and clinically important. Consid-
eration of all aspects of SCLs, including their clinical, imaging, 
histopathological, and especially immunochemical features, is the 
most comprehensive means of ensuring an accurate diagnosis. (Int

A unique presentation of IgG4 related disease mimicking soft 
tissue tumour
H. Imada*, T. Kawasaki, S. Kanno, J. Ichikawa
*Saitama Medical University, Japan
Background & objectives: Although IgG4 related disease (IgG4-
RD) was originally reported in sclerosing pancreatitis associated with 
increased serum IgG4, IgG4-RD was recognized as systemic disease 
because of involvement of multiple organs. Soft tissue involvement is 
rare and diagnostically challenging.
Methods: A 60-year-old male noticed a mass in the abdomen one 
year ago and visited our hospital. The mass was 6 cm and located 
subcutaneously in the lower abdomen. The mass did not change in 
size for a year, but surgical resection of the tumour was performed 
for definitive diagnosis. He had no medical history including auto-
immune disease and abdominal surgery.
Results: Magnetic resonance imaging study revealed intermediate 
intensity on T1WI, heterogeneously high to intermediate intensity 
on T2WI without fat component. Macroscopically, the tumour was 
well-demarcated, and the inside of tumour was yellow with heter-
ogenous myxoid change. Histologically, the mass was fibromyxoid 
tumour with mild lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltrate with focal 
aggregates of lymphocytes. Most of the sparsely infiltrated cells 
were plasma cells, which were positive for IgG and IgG4, and 
IgG4/IgG ratio exceeded 80%. No light chain restriction was iden-
tified by kappa/lambda stains. The patient is free of recurrence or 
metastasis after the surgery at least for two years.
Conclusion: Because of the rare location of IgG4-RD and absence 
of systemic symptoms, the diagnosis is challenging clinically and 
histologically. Especially soft tissue sarcoma and haematological 
malignancy must be carefully ruled out to reach IgG4-RD. Our 
case shows a unique clinical presentation and histopathological

Extraskeletal osteosarcoma with preceding myositis ossificans
H. Imada*, J. Ichikawa, S. Kanno, T. Kawasaki
*Saitama Medical University, Japan
Background & objectives: Extraskeletal osteosarcoma (EO) is an 
unusual soft tissue sarcoma characterized by production of bone matrix 
by neoplastic cells and is diagnosed by pathological identification 
of osteogenic differentiation. Benign osteoid in EO, which is rarely 
encountered, may pose a diagnostic problem.
Methods: A 21-year-old man had swelling of left knee. Magnetic 
resonance imaging showed a 39 mm mass in the posterolateral side 
of the left tibia, and it had peripheral mineralization and uneven 
enhancement with cystic change. The tumour was located outside 
of the bone. Because myositis ossificans (MO) or hematoma with 
malignancy potential was clinically suspected, wide resection was 
performed.
Results: Macroscopically, the mass was 4.5 x 4 x 2.5 cm in size 
and greyish to brown in colour. Cut section showed multiple cystic 
lesions with solid components. Histopathologically, the solid com-
ponents demonstrated diffuse proliferation of pleomorphic tumour 
cells with frequent mitoses, and abundant osteoclast-like giant cells 
were admixed. Tumour cells focally formed osteoid without other 
specific differentiation. Cystic lesions showed aneurysmal bone 
cyst-like change. In the periphery was mature bone tissue with 
bland osteocytes and focally non-malignant woven bone and fibro-
blasts, compatible with zonation. Immunohistochemically MDM2, 
CDK4, and H3.3 G34W were all negative. Fluorescence in situ 
hybridization demonstrated split signals of the USP6 gene.
Conclusion: EO with preceding MO was collectively diagnosed 
by pathological findings. The patient had no local recurrence and 
metastasis, 16 months after surgery. To the best of our knowledge, 
this is the first case cytogenetically confirmed as well as the second 
case with distinct zonation of MO. Although the exact pathogen-
esis is to be elucidated, USP6 rearrangement might promote the 
understanding of the aetiology as well as the diagnosis of EO with 
preceding MO.

Indolent multinodular synovial sarcoma of foot with peripheral 
nerve extension
H. Imada*, T. Kawasaki, N. Suzuki, J. Ichikawa
*Saitama Medical University, Japan
Background & objectives: Synovial sarcoma is a malignant spindle 
cell sarcoma which could involve virtually any location. Its clinical 
presentation and/or course is diverse and could mimic other tumours. 
Herein we report a unique case of multinodular synovial sarcoma with 
nerve extension.
Methods: A 33-year-old female had a painful nodule in the dor-
sum of her left foot four years ago. She came to our hospital three 
years ago, but was followed up because her symptom was mild, and 
the tumour was suspected of Schwannoma. However, her pain was 
gradually increased and excisional biopsy with wide resection was 
performed. She had no medical history.
Results: Magnetic resonance imaging revealed heterogenous 
high to intermediate intensity on T2WI, intermediate intensity on 
T1WI. Continuous beaded masses showed heterogenous enhance-
ment. Biopsy was taken from the clinically recognized two dif-
ferent lesions, both of which showed similar histology; diffuse 
proliferation of spindle cells and cellularity differed between the 
nodules. Immunohistochemically, CD34 (-), Desmin (-), SOX10 
weak (+), S100 (-), H3K27me3 (+, retained), STAT6 (-), SMA (-), 
beta catenin (-). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) dem-
onstrated split signals of the SS18 gene. Additional wide resection 
specimen included peripheral nerve involvement. The patient had 
no recurrence and metastasis after the surgery at least for one year.
Conclusion: Diagnosis of synovial sarcoma is rather straightfor-
ward, but the atypical presentation is characteristic masquerading 
benign tumours such as Schwannoma. Our case is considered to 
be multinodular synovial sarcoma with peripheral nerve extension 
due to intranerve involvement. It might also be histologically diag-
nosed as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour when FISH is 
not available or differential diagnosis of synovial sarcoma is not 
in mind. The present case will expand the clinical diversity of 
synovial sarcoma.

juif, France
Background & objectives: Primary cardiac tumours are rare. Approxi-
mately 90% are benign (mostly myxomas). We report the first case of 
a spindle cell mesenchymal tumour harbouring a fusion of RREB1-
MKL2 located in the right atrium.
Methods: A 58 year-old woman with dyspnea on exertion since 
3 months and history of frequent travels was found to have a 9 
cm cystic mass in the right atrium on chest CT-scan. An hydatid 
cyst was clinically suspected and the lesion was resected. The 
case was referred to our centre for second opinion.
Results: Microscopic examination of the fragmented specimen 
showed a proliferation of monotonous spindle cells with pale 
eosinophilic cytoplasm, indistinct borders, ovoid nuclei with 
open chromatin and variable cellularity. Hypercellular areas 
were storiform with a fibrous background and thick collagen 
bands. Hypocellular areas showed haphazardly arranged cells in a 
loose myxoid matrix. The mitotic activity was low (< 1 mitose/10 
high-power fields). Immunohistochemically, the cells were dif-
fusely positive for S100 protein and INSM1, weakly positive 
for panTRK, while negative for AE1/AE3, EMA, SMA, SOX10, 
desmin, CD34, oestrogen receptors, HMB45, GFAP, MDM2 and 
CD56. Targeted RNA sequencing identified a fusion between 
RREB1 (exon 8) and MKL2 (exon 11).

Conclusion: Fusion of RREB1-MKL2 has been recently 
described in 90% of ectomesenchymal chondromyxoid tumour 
(ECMT), all located in the tongue, in a biphenotypic « oro-
pharyngeal » sarcoma, a biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma and two 
mesenchymal tumours involving the superior mediastinum. Our 
unusual case broadened the spectrum of mesenchymal tumours 
associated with RREB1-MKL2 fusion. Despite sharing some 
similarities with the phenotype of ECMT, whether our case rep-
resents extra-glossal ECMT remains uncertain.

case report
E. Koniaris*, I. Nikolopoulos, E. Mortakis, M. Chamourgiotaki, 
G. Kafiri
*Pathology department, General hospital of Athens "Hippokratio", 
Greece
Background & objectives: Immature teratomas (I.T.), also known as 
mixed germ cell tumours, are mainly found in gonadal sites, e.g., testis. 
Extragonadal location site is rare (2-5%) and mostly found to arise in 
the sacrococcygeal location (50-70%), or the gonads (30-40%).
Methods: A 67-year-old male patient, admitted to our hospital with a pro-
gressively enlarging painless mid right thigh mass, with no other reported 
complaints. Examination revealed a compact firm elastic tumour measuring 
4X4 cm, without erythema or tenderness. On imaging, a regular heterogeneous 
mass was noted, and it was decided to be excised, with wide surgical borders.
Results: Macroscopically, we received a wide excised skin 
specimen with a whitish brownish in hue and of elastic firm in 
consistency neoplasm. Histologically, the tumour was mainly 
composed of immature neuroepithelial elements, with immature 
cartilage and other immature elements of ecto- and endodermic 
lineage. Immunohistochemical studies were performed with 
the following antibodies: S100, which highlighted the neural 
elements, CK 8/18, which revealed the epithelial elements, WT1 
was negative, a-fetoprotein and OCT4, were found to be focally 
reactive, chromogranine and synaptophysin were also found to be 
focal, desmin was reported as negative and the mitotic index ki67 
varied 20-50%. The tumour was totally excised and had pushing 
borders.
Conclusion: I.T. in the soft tissue of the thigh is extremely rare 
with only a few similar cases reported, in this very unlikely 
location, which one can only explain as a disturbed migration of 
the primordial germ cells along the urogenital ridge, and hence 
undergoing a microenvironment related transformation. In our 
patient we suggested metastasis from a germ cell tumour of the 
testis, but further imaging examination (testicular US) didn’t reveal 
any gonadal association, or any other lesions elsewhere

Immunohistochemical marker VEGF in the diagnosis of peri-
odontal diseases
K. Kosov*, N. Zhuravleva, E. Guryanova, V. Diomidova
*Chuvash State University by I.N.Ulianov, Russia
Background & objectives: The purpose of the study was to determine 
the effect of a chronic inflammatory-destructive process in periodontal 
tissues on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 
on the process of angiogenesis in the connective tissue structures of 
the gums.
Methods: The study group - 20 patients (age 20-36 years) burdened 
with chronic generalized periodontitis of mild/moderate severity. 
Biopsy material (pieces of gum) was obtained during closed 
curettage after tooth extraction for orthopaedic and orthodontic 
reasons. VEGF was detected by an indirect immunohistochemical 
method. Polyclonal rabit anti-VEGF antibodies (ThermoScientific, 
USA) were used as the first antibodies.
Results: In patients with chronic generalized periodontitis, VEGF-immu-
nopositive vessels were found in the lamina propria with strong and mod-
erate reactions to VEGF. In the own plate of patients in the control group 
(patients with intact periodontium who applied for planned dental care), 
most of the studied pieces of gum contained vessels that were not stained 
when reacting to VEGF.
Conclusion: Expression of the VEGF protein reaches lower levels in 
healthy connective tissue areas of the gums and increases in periodonti-
tis. VEGF is involved in the initiation and progression of inflammation 
from gingivitis to periodontitis. This is due to the ability to stimulate 
vasodilation and angiogenesis in an inflammatory response. Vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has mitogenic activity, regulates 
endothelial cell migration, vascular permeability, and induces the 
expression of anti-apoptotic proteins in these cells.

Mestiri, S. Hmissa
*Pathology Department, Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Giant cell tumour of bone (GCTB) is a 
locally aggressive primary bone neoplasm. Unusually, conventional 
GCTB displays marked nuclear atypia designated as pseudoanaplastic 
change mimicking primary sarcoma or sarcomatous transformation. We 
aim to analyse clinico-pathological aspects of this entity.
Methods: We present a case of pseudoanaplastic GCTB in a 
14-year old girl, without significant pathological history. This case 
was diagnosed in our institution in 2022.
Results: Patient presented with a mass of the upper extremity of 
the humerus. Magnetic resonance imaging showed infiltrating 
haemorrhagic lesion measuring 16x12x11cm, suggesting a 
telangiectatic osteosarcoma. There were no distant localisations on 
computed-tomographic scan. Grossly, the specimen consisted of 
numerous loose haemorrhagic fragments of soft tissue and bone. 
Histological examination revealed areas of typical GCTB composed 
of uniformly distributed giant cells interspersed with mononuclear cells 
exhibiting moderate atypia. Other areas demonstrated scattered foci of 
cells displaying marked nuclear pleomorphism. Mitotic figures were 
numerous. Prominent haemorrhage and necrosis were seen in these 
areas. Positivity for H3G34 made the diagnosis of pseudoanaplastic 
GCTB.
Patient was treated using curettage.
Conclusion: Pseudoanaplastic GCTB is an uncommon variant 
of a conventional GCTB which can mimic primary sarcoma or 
sarcomatous transformation. Distinction from a sarcomatous 
lesion is made by a careful analysis of all factors suggestive of 
malignancy.

Background & objectives: Myelolipoma is a rare disease and benign 
mesenchymal tumour, usually found in the adrenal region. Extra adre-
nal sites of this entity are uncommon. Patient are usually asymptomatic.
We aim to analyse clinical and pathological aspects of a presacral 
myelolipoma.
Methods: We report a case of presacral myelolipoma in a 62 year-
old woman which was initially misdiagnosed as a liposarcoma. This 
case was diagnosed in our institution in 2022.
Results: The Patient presented with atypical coccygeal pain evolving 
for five years. Patient’s comorbidities consisted of hypertension. Physi-
cal examination revealed an abdominal tenderness in the right iliac 
foss. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis showed a presacral 
mass measuring 5x3.5x2 cm with fatty and solid components, sugges-
tive of a liposarcoma. Thus, patient underwent surgical resection of the 
mass. Histological examination of the resected mass revealed mature 
adipose tissue with prominent cellular stroma that was consisted of all 
three hematopoietic cell lineages ; myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryo-
cytic forming cell lines without any evidence of dysplasia. Therefore, 
the diagnosis of myelolipoma was made.
Conclusion: Presacral myelolipoma is an uncommon disease 
consisting of adipose tissue and hematopoietic cells, easily con-
fused with both primary and secondary malignant retroperitoneal 
tumours. In fact, it still remains a diagnosis challenge for clinicians 
to make the distinction between liposarcoma and myelolipoma 
based only on imaging features.

An old calcifying aponeurotic fibroma
C. Padrão*, M.B. Pimentão, M.A. Cipriano
*Hospital Prof. Dr. Fernando Fonseca, Portugal
Background & objectives: Calcifying aponeurotic fibroma is a rare, 
benign fibroblastic tumour more frequent in male children usually 
in hands and feet. We report a case of a 9 years-old female with a 
calcifying aponeurotic fibroma with 8 years of evolution.
Methods: At the age of 3 years the patient was referenced to the 
paediatric orthopaedic consultation for a mass in plantar surface 
of the second finger of the right foot with 2 years of evolution, 
the patient lost follow up and returned at the age of 7 with a size 
increase, complain of discomfort walking barefoot and tenderness 
with palpation.
Results: Sequential evaluation at 7 and 8 years old of the foot 
magnetic resonance imaging showed densification in the plantar, 
medial, and lateral aspects of the second finger at the proximal 
phalange of the right foot level. The tendons and the bone were 
unaffected. The lesion increased in size between the two exams.
An excisional biopsy was performed and revealed an infiltrative 
proliferation through the adipose tissue of ovoid to spindle fibro-
blasts in a storiform to fascicular pattern. It also forms a palisade 
around the nodular areas of chondroid and calcified metaplasia The 
stroma is collagenous with slit like vascular spaces. Rare osteo-
clast-type giant cells are present.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of calcifying aponeurotic fibroma was 
made. This is a benign entity, its infiltrative pattern could mimic 
malignancy, and although it has a high rate of recurrence, aggres-
sive treatments should be avoided. Conservative surgery with pres-
ervation of function, is recommended.

Collagen orientation probed by polarized Raman spectra on 
5μm-thick FFPET sections can be readably used for grading 
meniscal degeneration

Papachristou*
*University of Patras, School of Medicine, Unit of Bone and Soft 
Tissue, Patras, Greece
Background & objectives: To analyse normal and degenerated 
menisci with Raman methodology on 5μm-thick FFPET sections and 
correlate Raman findings with histiopathological grade of meniscus 
degeneration. 27 degenerated and 6 healthy menisci from human knee 
joints after total knee replacement/meniscectomy were tested.
Methods: H&E analysis on FFPE sections to determine the grade 
of meniscal degeneration. Raman polarization to evaluate collagen 
fibrils orientation in different levels of the same sections, used 
for histopathology. Raman spectra were collected in two different 
polarization geometries, v-HH and v-VV. We calculated mean value 
of the v-HH/v-VV intensity ratio of two Raman bands, sensitive/
non-sensitive to the molecular orientation.
Results: Collagen specific amide I band at 1665 cm−1, has the 
higher sensitivity dependence on Raman polarization. Mean val-
ues of ratio v-HH/v-VV of the 1665cm−1 peak intensity was sig-
nificantly higher in healthy, mean ± SD:2.56±0.46, compared to 
degenerated menisci, mean ± SD:1.85±0.42 (p=0.0014). Mean 
values of v-HH/v-VV intensity ratio were 2.18 and 1.50 for low 
and high degenerated menisci, respectively (p<0.0001). The differ-
ence of peak intensities in the two laser polarizations is decreased 
in the degenerated menisci; this difference is diminishing as the 
degeneration increases. The v-HH/v-VV ratio was also significantly 
different in low, compared to control/high grade lesions (p=0.036 
and p<0.0001, respectively) mirroring their biology and function.
Conclusion:
Raman analysis can be reliably applied on FFPET sections and 
thus can be applied on archival tissues on a variety of pathologies, 
including cancer.
Raman analysis on FFPET can serve as an additional, reliable tool 
for accurate discrimination between normal/degenerated menisci 
and between menisci with low- and high-grade degeneration.
Technically advanced, preferably portable Raman instruments 
combined with intra-operative histological analyses could provide 
faster, real-time and reliable data, adding to the decision making 
algorithm for management of meniscal and other pathologies

Intracranial sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma - a rare neo-
plasm in an unusual location
S. Pedrosa*, F. Moreira, A. Marques, J. Pinheiro
*Pathology Department, Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de São 
João, Portugal
Background & objectives: Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) 
is an uncommon malignant mesenchymal neoplasm, composed of 
epithelioid fibroblasts in a dense sclerotic stroma. Most cases occur 
in the extremities and limb girdles of adults. Intracranial location and 
occurrence in paediatric age are rarely reported.
Methods: We herein report a case of a 16 year-old male, admitted 
due to left hemiparesis. MRI revealed a 42mm extra-axial intrac-
ranial mass in the falx cerebri. He underwent surgical resection 
and neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy. Eleven years later, following 
surgical reconstruction of the scalp defect, he presented with new 
onset dyspnea, left pleural effusion and subpleural lung nodules, 
the greatest measuring 43mm.
Results: Histology of the intracranial mass resection revealed 
epithelioid tumour cells disposed in nests and cords within a 
dense sclerotic hyalinized stroma. Neoplastic cells showed strong 
and diffuse MUC4 and vimentin immunoreactivity and were

negative for EMA, SSTR2a, CD34 and STAT6. The biopsy of 
the lung nodules showed the same morphological and immuno-
histochemical profile, leading to the diagnosis of intracranial 
SEF and metastatic relapse of disease. Molecular study by 
RNA sequencing was inconclusive due to poor RNA quality. 
Break-apart FISH for EWSR1 fusions was negative. Literature 
review showed only three intracranial sclerosing epithelioid 
fibrosarcomas. Metastasis of SEF occur in up to 50% of cases, 
most commonly to the lung.
Conclusion: Diagnosis of extra-axial intracranial tumours can 
be quite challenging. Meningioma is the most common neoplasm 
but it may display a wide variety of patterns, making mesenchy-
mal neoplasms, besides solitary fibrous tumour, an important 
differential diagnosis in selected cases. SEF usually harbours 
EWSR1/FUS-CREB gene fusions, nonetheless cases without this 
molecular alteration have been reported. Furthermore, an alter-
native YAP1-KMT2A gene fusion has recently been identified. 
Accurate diagnosis is of utmost importance given its aggressive 
behaviour with frequent recurrences and late metastasis.

A case report of retiform hemangioendothelioma as pleural 
tumour with rib infiltration
T. Pikivaca*, A. Lukac, A. Mataic, S. Seiwerth
*University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Croatia
Background & objectives: Retiform hemangioendothelioma is an 
extremely rare vascular tumour of intermediate biological behav-
iour which is prone to local recurrence but rarely shows distant 
metastases. It predominantly arises in the skin and subcutaneous 
adipose tissue of the distal extremities.
Methods: 39-year-old woman underwent video-assisted thoraco-
scopic surgery during which a tumour of the left parietal pleura has 
been resected with partial resection of the seventh rib. The pleural 
tumour was radiologically detected during workup of an invasive 
breast cancer, earlier that year. (Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, left-
sided mastectomy with axillary dissection and adjuvant chemo-
therapy were performed).
Results: Histologically, the resected pleural tumour showed reti-
form arborizing vascular spaces lined by bland endothelial cells 
with hobnail nuclei, characteristic of retiform hemangioendothe-
lioma. Immunohistochemical markers CD31, CD34 and ERG were 
positive, while D2-40, synaptophisin and HHV-8 were negative. 
Features of malignancy or any other type of vascular tumour were 
not present in this material, but the tumour infiltrated the underly-
ing resected bone superficially and was on the resection margins 
marked with tissue dye. Given the possible local aggressive behav-
iour and recurrence (60% of cases), additional resection and regular 
monitoring of the patient was recommended.
Conclusion: Although retiform hemangioendotelioma predomi-
nantly affects skin and subcutis, unusually affected sites (only few 
cases) are head and neck region, thorax, penis and pleura. Retiform 
hemangioendothelioma on location other than skin or subcutis may 
lead to corresponding symptoms or even threatened survival. It is 
important to completely rule out a possibility of more aggressive 
vascular tumours (e.g. angiosarcoma), which may harbour areas 
morphologically similar to retiform hemangioendothelioma. Reti-
form hemangioendothelioma often recurs many years after diag-
nosis so extensive local excision is required.

De-differentiated liposarcomas with heterologous and homolo-
gous elements: MDM2, CDK4 and DDIT3 testing on several 
blocks with homologous and heterologous elements is useful 
for diagnosis
D. Proca*, A. Lazim, J.J. Fu, I. Akhtar
*Temple University, USA
Background & objectives: Osteosarcoma (OS) heterologous compo-
nent in dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL) is rare but should be con-
sidered and MDM2/ CDK-4 testing employed. Myxoid liposarcoma-
like (ML) homologous differentiation with simultaneous MDM2 and 
DDDIT3 amplification is also unusual and needs to be recognized.
Methods: We report three special cases of DDL, two in the retrop-
eritoneum and one in the abdomen: a DDL with OS differentiation, 
confirmed by MDM2 and CDK4 positive testing, as well as two 
DDL with homologous ML differentiation confirmed by simultane-
ous positive MDM2 and DDIT3 testing.
Results: The DDL with heterologous osseous differentiation and 
very rare WDL foci, which were important to identify in order to 
exclude the diagnosis of extraosseous OS. Without the rare foci 
of WDL, the extensive high grade spindled DDL may have been 
misinterpreted as part of an extraosseous OS. MDM2 and CDK4 
testing was needed to guide the diagnosis. The other two cases are 
DDL with homologous myxoid differentiation; FISH testing for 
MDM2 and DDIT3 amplification is necessary.
WDL and DDL can contain ML component, a diagnostic challenge 
when confronted with a small biopsy. Such tumours have been 
shown to contain co-amplifications of MDM2 and DDIT3, further 
adding to a diagnostic dilemma.
Conclusion: The presence of pleomorphic cells or lipoblasts in 
WDL or DDL, as seen in our two cases, should prompt consider-
ing MDM2 FISH testing in conjunction with DDIT3, rather than 
DDIT3 alone. Furthermore, the first case illustrates the utility of 
MDM2 and CDK4 testing in ruling out other high-grade sarcomas 
when a DDL diagnosis is uncertain due to absent WDL or presence 
of heterologous component, particularly high grade OS.

Multiple enchondromatosis of the upper limb in combination 
with multiple haemangiomas in a 20-year-old patient with Maf-
fuci syndrome
M. Mnikhovich, D. Kushch, A. Romanov*, T. Bezuglova
*Central pathology laboratory, Research Institute of Human Mor-
phology, Russia
Background & objectives: Maffucci syndrome (MS) is a rare congeni-
tal disease caused by mutations in the IDH1 or IDH2 genes, manifested 
by a combination of soft tissue haemangiomas with multiple enchon-
dromes as well with other malignant soft tissue and bones tumours.
Methods: We present a case of MS in a 20-year-old female with 
enchondromatosis of the upper extremities in combination with 
multiple haemangiomas of the face and oropharynx.
The patient was operated on for the thumb of the right hand. MSCT 
showed solid septated mass with low echogenicity. Methods of 
histologic examination and IHC studies were applied.
Results: Microscopy shows fragments of cartilage tissue in its 
own capsule, which has the structure of an enchondroma, with 
areas of myxoid degeneration of cartilage and severe necrobiotic 
changes; fragments of bone tissue with sclerotic changes, foci of 
axillary bone resorption and the growth of fibroreticular tissue 
in the intervertebral spaces. Against this background, there are 
multiple, merging foci of haemorrhages, as well as signs of patho-
logical regeneration in the form of an excessive number of small, 
thin-walled blood vessels of the microcirculatory bed (mimicking 
capillary haemangioma).

Conclusion: MS is rare disease with a sporadic character, benign, 
but gradually disabling course. Affects both sexes. The first mani-
festations occur in childhood. True venous malformations and 
hemangioendotheliomas appear on the skin. The second most 
important clinical sign is the bone deforming enchondroma. MS 
represent a medical and social problem, which implies the impor-
tance of the task of choosing the tactics of treatment of patients 
with such a disease.

Poorly differentiated chordoma, a rare type of chordoma, in a 
2.5-year-old girl
M.M. Savas*, I. Tosun
*Umraniye EducationTraining Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Chordoma is a relatively rare locally inva-
sive and potentially malignant tumour of foetal notochord. Poorly dif-
ferentiated chordoma (PDC) is a rare type of chordoma. In the most 
cases with PDC, cytogenetic studies identified deletions in SMARCB1, 
a tumour suppressor gene.
Methods: We report an exceptional case of a late local failure of 
a PDC of the cranio-cervical junction in a 2.5-year-old girl. The 
patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of tender-
ness and limitation of movement in her neck. MRI and PET/CT 
revealed a tumour infiltrating C1 vertebra, compressing spinal 
cord and conglomerated metastatic lymphadenopathy in the left 
supraclavicular area.
Results: On histological examination, tumour was composed 
of multinodular sheets of cells in mostly epithelioid and scat-
tered sarcomatoid morphology with eosinophilic cytoplasm and 
prominent pleomorphism. The nuclei were round to ovoid, with 
vesicular chromatin and mitotic activity was increased. Necro-
sis was present. The physaliphorous cells typical of chordoma 
with classic features were absent. Immunohistochemistry stain-
ing revealed that the cells were reactive for panck, brachyury; 
nonreactive for s100, myogenin, myod1, desmin, CD99, CD34 
and SMARCB1(INI1) expression was found to be lost. Loss of 
SMARCB1 protein expression has recently been identified in a 
variety of tumour types such as PDC and malignant rhabdoid 
tumours (MRT) including atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour.
Conclusion: Although the histological and clinical features of PDC 
resemble MRT, brachyury and cytokeratin immuno-expressivity 
may help to distinguish PDC from those. PDC is a newly recog-
nized entity in the recent World Health Organization classification 
of tumours of soft tissue and bone. Treatment consists of a com-
bination of surgery and chemo-radiotherapy. Fewer than 60 cases 
have yet been reported in the English literature and this rare-type 
of chordoma, PDC, is associated with poor prognosis that worse 
than conventional chordoma.

Whole exome sequencing analysis of dedifferentiated 
chondrosarcoma
J. Schreier*, A. Roessner, S.R. Ullmann, D. Schanze, D. Jechorek, 
S. Franke
*OvGU Magdeburg Department of Pathology, Germany
Background & objectives: Dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma (DDCS) 
is a biphasic malignant mesenchymal tumour with a low malignant 
component equal to chondrosarcoma grade 1 and a highly malignant 
component resembling pleomorphic sarcoma. Studies comparing 
genetic alterations of these components using whole exome sequenc-
ing are rare.
Methods: In our study DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, 
paraffin-embedded tissue samples. After thorough quality check-
ing, the DNA samples were analysed. For an improved understand-
ing of the molecular genetic differences in DDCS, whole exome 
sequencing of 5 tumours with 2 samples each, was used to compare 
the genetic landscape of paired conventional and dedifferentiated 
tissue components.
Results: In line with recent publications IDH1/2 mutations could 
be observed in both tissue components of several samples. While 
alterations in the COL2A1 gene (Collagen Type II Alpha 1 Chain) 
were found in both components, we also discovered broad altera-
tions of different collagen type genes. Mutations in the TP53 and 
TP53BP1 gene could be found in both portions. Interestingly alter-
ations within the CD4/CD6 pathway were found predominantly in 
the dedifferentiated tissue. Moreover Wnt/β-catenin and hedge-
hog pathway mutations as well as TERT promoter mutations were 
observed along with a broad spectrum of alterations in APOB, 
ATRX, BRCA, GLI1/2, SOX9 and chromatin regulatory genes.
Conclusion: Our results confirm the detection of IDH1 and IDH2 
mutations in both tissue components. This points to a monoclo-
nal origin of DDCS. Furthermore, our findings confirm an estab-
lished pattern of particular mutations in important driver genes, 
like CDKN2A, BRCA, KIT. Exploring extensive mutations in the 
CD4/CD6, Wnt/β-catenin and hedgehog pathways could lead to 
advances in possible targeted therapies.

Pseudomyogenic Hemangioendothelioma in the thumb – report 
of a rare case
F. Sousa Vieira*, D. Sá, A. Coelho, J.R. Vizcaíno
*Centro Hospitalar Universitário do Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothe-
lioma is a rare soft tissue tumour, mostly indolent and infrequently 
metastasizing. It usually presents with multiple cutaneous nodules in 
extremities, mainly affecting young adults. Due to its relative uncom-
monness and unusual presentation, this tumour can be diagnostically 
challenging.
Methods: We report a multifocal PMHE in the left thumb of 
a 41-year-old man. The patient described painful lesions, and 
three tumours were confirmed by MRI, located in the thenar 
eminence, proximal phalanx and subungual area. He was 
submitted to a distal amputation through the interphalangeal 
joint and a separated resection of the proximal tumour, resulting 
in symptomatic relief.
Results: Histopathological examination of the resected 
specimens revealed multiple foci of a mesenchymal neoplasm 
of high cellularity, consisting of short fascicles of spindled 
and epithelioid cells with low pleomorphism, with ample 
and eosinophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nucleus and evident 
nucleolus. The neoplasm had no necrosis, had low mitotic 
index and was permeated by neutrophils. The growth pattern 
was infiltrative, with skeletal muscle tissue and bone invasion. 
Immunohistochemistry was performed in sections of both 
soft tissue component and bone-infiltrating component (with 
decalcifying procedure). The tumour cells were immunoreactive 
for CD31, ERG, AE1/3, CAM5.2 (focal) and INI1 (preserved). 
In the decalcified sample, however, the nuclear staining of INI1 
and ERG were equivocally weak.
Conclusion: With the described findings, the diagnosis of 
pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma was made. The 
decalcification procedure, however, can cause misinterpretation

of the INI1 and ERG stains as negative, which can lead to 
misdiagnose it as an epithelioid sarcoma, its most important 
differential diagnosis, with a very different prognosis. Therefore, 
whenever possible, it is essential to reserve a sample without bone, 
in which to perform the ancillary studies. The patient is disease-
free since the surgery, with a follow-up time of 5 months.

Differential diagnosis of spleen sarcoma: cytokeratin-positive 
interstitial reticulum cell (CIRC) sarcoma - a rare extranodal 
presentation
A. Szumera-Ciećkiewicz*, O. Kuczkiewicz-Siemion, K. Kurek, K. 
Seliga, T. Świtaj, P. Rutkowski
*Narodowy Instytut Onkologii im. M. Sklodowskiej-Curie, Poland
Background & objectives: CIRC sarcoma (or tumour) is an excep-
tional neoplasm originating from mesenchymal stem cells, which dif-
ferentiate into fibroblastic reticulum cells of lymphoid organs. Cytoker-
atin expression in that malignancy is a diagnostic pitfall and falsely 
leads to the metastatic carcinoma histopathological diagnosis.
Methods: A 44-year-old female was admitted for consultation after 
splenectomy, which was performed outside our centre. Initially, 
tumour with the greatest dimension of 14cm was well-circum-
scribed and confined to the spleen. Histopathological, immunohis-
tochemical and molecular testing (next-generation sequencing with 
extended sarcoma panel) were done. Concurrently, the updated 
clinical and radiological examination revealed multifocal recur-
rences within the peritoneal cavity.
Results: Microscopically, a pleomorphic tumour, with mitotic 
activity up to 11 mitoses /10HPF, with necrosis <10% was found. 
Neoplastic cells with high cytological atypia, with prominent, par-
tially lobed nuclei and nucleoli (Reed-Sternberg or "viriocyte-like" 
cell morphology) were identified; stroma was abundant and con-
tained numerous macrophages/histiocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils 
("inflammatory" background). Immunohistochemically cells were: 
Vimentin(+), CAM5,2(+), CKAE1/AE3(+/-), SMA(-), Desmin(-), 
CK5/6(-), EA(-), EMA(-), p40(-), CDX2(-), PAX8(-), TTF1(-), 
GATA3(-), CD1a(-), S100(-), CD163(-/+), CD68PG-M1(-/+), 
SOX10(-), HMB45(-), BRAF(-), CD21(-), CD23(-), CD35(-); 
CD31(-), CD34(-), ERG(-), CD30(-), PAX5(-), CD43(-), TdT(-); 
WT1(-), Calretynin(-), ALK1(-), ER(-), CD4(-), CD8(-), EBER(-), 
Ki67(+) 30%. NGS testing did not reveal any specific molecular 
signature. The final diagnosis CIRC sarcoma was established.
Conclusion: The major directions in the differential diagnosis 
of CIRC sarcoma include not only metastatic carcinoma but also 
follicular dendritic cell tumour/sarcoma, interdigitating reticulum 
cell tumour, histiocytic sarcoma, and inflammatory pseudotumour-
like follicular/fibroblastic dendritic cell sarcoma. CIRC tumours 
(only 14 presented cases) are positive for epithelial markers and 
vimentin with variable expression of other markers (variable 
Desmin, SMA, S100, CD68 positivity). A wide spectrum of clinical 
behaviour (mostly inferior) and combined treatment (surgical 
resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy) are described.

The conundrum of primary Rosai-Dorfman disease of the bone 
- a very rare lesion
D. Tapoi*, A. Dumitru, R. Adam, M. Sajin, M. Costache, A. Iliesiu
*University Emergency Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Rosai-Dorfman Disease, or sinus 
histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, is a rare benign 
histiocytic neoplasia, mostly affecting young adults. Extranodal 
involvement can occur in up to 40% of the patients. Less than 10% 
develop bone lesions and these are usually multifocal.
Methods: We report the case of a 42 year-old woman who pre-
sented with pain and regional deformity in the distal third of her 
right calf. CT scans revealed an osteolytic lesion with thinning and 
disruption of the bone cortex, extraosseous expansion and peri-
osteal reaction, without other affected sites. An excisional biopsy 
was performed, followed by extensive histopathological and immu-
nohistochemical analysis.
Results: Microscopic examination showed a diffuse infiltrate of 
small lymphocytes, plasma cells and frequent foamy histiocytes 
as well as pigment laden macrophages (siderophages), displayed 
around small vascular structures with slightly thickened walls. 
Some histiocytes displayed abundant, pale cytoplasm with 
phagocytized lymphocytes, suggestive for emperipolesis. This 
inflammatory infiltrate extended into adjacent bone and soft 
tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the 
foamy histiocytes stain intensely for S100, CD68, CD163 and 
Cyclin D1, while CD1a reaction was negative. Based on these 
results, the diagnosis of primary RDD of the bone was established. 
Subsequently, the patient underwent complete surgical removal 
of the tumour. Six months later, clinical and radiological exams 
showed no sings of recurrence.
Conclusion: Solitary RDD of the bone, without nodal disease, is 
a rare pathology, which can be easily confused clinically, radio-
logically and on fine needle biopsy analysis with various other 
entities. As a consequence, surgical removal of the lesion is often 
warranted in order to diagnose and control the disease. However, 
patients should be monitored for several years as both local recur-
rence or development of new lesions have been reported. In such 
cases, various combinations of systemic therapies may be justified.

Small cell osteosarcoma: a diagnostically challenging tumour 
arising on the rib

Boudawara, R. Kallel
*Department of Pathology, Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, 
Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Small cell osteosarcoma (SCO) is a very 
uncommon tumour that rarely affects short bones, especially ribs. We 
herein present the fourth case of rib SCO described in the literature. 
The diagnosis and treatment of theses tumours pose several challenges.
Methods: We present the case of an 18-year-old woman who suf-
fered from right basi-thoracic pain and had an appearance of a 
swelling at the level of the 10thright rib.
Results: Chest CT showed a heterogeneous hyper vascular mass, 
measuring 106 x 93 x 110 mm. Surgical biopsy was performed. The 
mass was composed of small round cells with round uniform nuclei 
and a diffuse membranous CD99 positivity. The diagnosis of Ewing 
sarcoma was made. The patient received 6 cycles of chemotherapy 
followed by surgical resection. Pathological examination of the 
specimen showed a small cell proliferation with foci of lace-like 
osteoid production. Finally, the diagnosis of a SCO of the rib, with 
20% of tumour necrosis was established. Adjuvant chemotherapy 
with Methotrexate was indicated in association with radiotherapy. 
The patient recovered well, with no signs of local recurrence.
Conclusion: SCO rarely affects short bones and should be kept in mind 
in the management of ribs’ tumours. Histopathological investigation 
plays an important role in the diagnosis. In fact, osteoid production 
is the characteristic pathological feature of SCO, and may easily 
distinguish it from Ewing sarcoma. However, in small biopsies, osteoid

production can be missing. Thus, immunohistochemistry as well as 
molecular studies are necessary to make the right diagnosis.

Why does not ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament 
involve an upper part of the axis?
T. Yamaguchi*, H. Imada
*Dokkyo Medical Universiry Nikko Medical Center, Japan
Background & objectives: Ossification of posterior longitudi-
nal ligament (OPLL) can involve any parts of the ligament only 
except an upper part of the axis. To elucidate the reason why this 
part is not affected we examined 52 cervical spines dissected at 
autopsy.
Methods: The specimens were dissected from cadavers aged over 
50 years old at autopsy performed in Dokkyo Medical University 
and Koshigaya Hospital. There were 39 men and 13 women with 
a mean age of 69 years old. The formalin fixed specimens were 
cut into sagittal slices with 5 mm in thick. Decalcified ones were 
processed for histology after X-ray examination.
Results: OPLL were observed in 25 cases on X-ray. The most 
common type was segmental and the largest lesion involved con-
secutive 3 vertebral bodies (C4-C6). The most common location 
was C6 in 20 cases followed by C4 and C5 in 13 cases, each, C7 
in 12 cases, C3 in 5 cases, and C2 in 2 cases. OPLL was found 
along the axis but never seen at an upper half part. Seven OPLL 
lesions at intervertebral disc were found in 6 cases: C3/4 in one 
case, C4/5 in 3 cases, C5/6 in 2 case, and C6/7 in one case. In 
addition, a specific anatomical structure was found around the 
axis.
Conclusion: Pathogenesis of OPLL is unknown, however, ligament 
ossification requires blood flow. This study demonstrated that the 
cervical longitudinal ligament except an upper part is directly 
attached to the posterior aspect of the cervical vertebral bodies 
and intervertebral discs. The upper part of the ligament is separated 
from the upper half of the axis because a bursa and the transverse 
ligament of atlas lay between them. We conclude that this anatomic 
structure does not lead to ligament ossification.

NTRK-rearranged spindle cell neoplasm: a case report
S. Yilmaz Erozbek*, A. Cakir, S. Dervisoglu
*Istanbul Medipol University, Pathology Department, Turkey
Background & objectives: NTRK (neurotrophic tyrosine receptor 
kinase)-rearranged spindle cell neoplasms, included in the 5th edition 
of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of Soft Tissue 
and Bone Sarcomas, are characterized by morphological and molecular 
features resembling lipofibromatosis-like neural tumours.
Methods: A 2-year-old boy presented with painless mass that grew 
as the child got older was observed in the dorsum of the left hand. 
In the ultrasonographic examination, a vascularized fat-rich lesion 
measuring 45x16x40 mm was observed in the subcutaneous soft 
tissue. Excision of the lesion was performed. Prepared slides and 
blocks were presented to us for consultation.
Results: No macroscopic information was available. 
Histologically, sections showed cellular spindle cell proliferation 
altered with adipose tissue, with pigmentation. In cellular areas, 
spindle cells showed moderate pleomorphism, ovoid-to-elongated 
nuclei with amphophilic cytoplasm. 7 mitoses/mm2 were 
counted. No necrosis was observed. Histochemical examination 
of pigmentation showed a positive reaction with Masson Fontana, 
compatible with melanin. Immunohistochemically, tumour cells 
were positive for panTRK, patchy positive for CD34, weak 
positive in myofibroblastic pattern for SMA, negative for desmin, 
EMA, HMB45, SOX-10. Ki-67 was 25%. We concluded that, this 
melanin pigment containing tumour similar to lipofibromatosis, 
is a NTRK-rearranged spindle cell neoplasm with low-
intermediate histological grade. Investigation of NTRK fusion 
with molecular methods were recommended.
Conclusion: The NTRK mutation is one of the new entities dis-
covered in spindle cell neoplasms with genetic rearrangements. 
Although there is a wide histological presentation in the litera-
ture, it is valuable to evaluate NTRK rearrangement in spindle 
cell neoplasms, especially when infantile fibrosarcoma, lipofi-
bromatosis and fibrosarcoma-like morphology are observed. 
Molecular examination can be done, also pan-TRK İHC can be 
used to support the diagnosis. Demonstrating this genetic rear-
rangement is clinically important for targeted therapies.

Zografos, T. Choreftaki
*Pathology Department, General Hospital of Athens 
"G.Gennimatas", Greece
Background & objectives: We report a rare case of leiomyosarcoma 
arising from the renal vein. Leiomyosarcomas are rare malignant soft 
tissue tumours. A minority of these originate from vessel walls, usu-
ally from the vena cava with only few arising from other large veins.
Methods: An 82 year old female with a history of malignant 
melanoma, presented at the hospital with a mass on the upper 
left abdominal quadrant diagnosed from a routine ultrasound. 
A CT and MRI were performed and a circumscribed large 
non-functioning mass at the location of the left adrenal 
gland and the retroaortic position of the left renal vein were 
depicted.
Results: Histological examination revealed a tumour that consisted 
of intersecting fascicles of spindle-shaped cells with smooth 
muscle differentiation, nuclear pleomorphism and 10-19 mitoses 
per High Power Field (HPF). The neoplasm originated from the 
left renal vein, without invading the left kidney while pushing and 
causing atrophy to the left adrenal gland. Immunohistochemistry 
showed diffuse positivity for smooth muscle actin (SMA), Desmin, 
H-Caldesmon and negativity for S-100, Mart-1, HMB-45, SOX-10. 
Ki-67 was estimated 35%.
Conclusion: These observations confirmed the diagnosis of a 
leiomyosarcoma of intermediate malignancy Grade 2 according 
to FNCLCC classification originating from the left renal vein. 
Primary renal vein leiomyosarcomas are quite rare with only a few 
cases reported in literature.

Background & objectives: Teratomas are germ cell tumours (GCT) 
containing cells from the three germ layers. The rise of somatic type 
malignancy in the context of GCT is rare phenomenon. Herein we 
describe a case, with 4 different somatic type malignancies.
Methods: A 44-year-old male who presented with a complaint 
of persistent cough. Physical and systemic examination were 
unremarkable. A CT scan revealed a mediastinal mass. Fine 
needle aspiration results were suggestive of teratoma. The patient 
underwent surgical resection of the tumour.
Results: Histopathologic examination revealed a mass measuring 
20 x 13.5 x 11 cm surrounded by a thickened fibrotic capsule of 
variable thickness with areas of necrosis and cystic like appear-
ance. Microscopically, the tumour was composed of heterologous 
components, mainly of mesenchymal but also of epithelial origin. 
Tumour demonstrated 4 different malignant components includ-
ing: angiosarcoma (CD31+, CD34+, ERG+, Ki67 at 67%), chon-
droblastic osteosarcoma, primordial cells tumour yolk sac type 
(PHOX2B+, GFAP+, NF+), well differentiated intestinal adeno-
carcinoma (CK 8/18+, CK20+, and CDX20+).
The rest of the tumour’s area consisted of mature hyaline cartilage, 
mature neural tissue with neural parenchyma (S100+, GFAP+), 
respiratory type epithelium with the presence of cilia and stratified 
squamous epithelium.
Conclusion: The most frequent malignant component associated 
with GCT are sarcomas. In our case, the rise of 4 different somatic 
type malignancies is a rare finding, and to our knowledge, very 
few are reported so far.

Thymic carcinoma: a rare type of cancer. Clinicopathological 
study of 9 cases
Y. Gómez Navarro*, M. Garcia Martos, C.M. Vieru, A. Panizo 
Santos
*Hospital General Universitario, Spain
Background & objectives: Thymic carcinomas are rare malignan-
cies (less than 6/100,000 persons) from thymic epithelial cells in 
the anterior mediastinum. There are more than 10 subtypes. The 
presence of an isolated anterior mediastinal mass with no tumour 
elsewhere should make us suspect it.
Methods: The pathology archives of two University Hospitals were 
searched for patients originally diagnosed as thymic carcinomas. 
The cases were reviewed by the authors (histopathology and immu-
nophenotype). Clinical parameters such as age, gender, and follow 
up were obtained from the existing medical records.
Results: Nine patients were identified: 4 males and 5 females, age 
ranged from 50 to 89 years (median 66,7 yrs.). The most common 
symptoms included chest pain and shortness of breath. CT scan 
showed in all patients large lesions in anterior mediastinum, meas-
uring 2-10,5 cm and an advanced stage at diagnosis in three cases. 
Histologically the tumours were classified as squamous cell carcino-
mas (6), neuroendocrine carcinoma (2) and high-grade undifferenti-
ated carcinoma (1). Overall, 2 tumour was classified as moderately 
differentiated and 6 as poorly differentiated. Immunohistochemically, 
the tumours were positive for cytokeratin (100%), 4 for c-Kit, and 5 
for CD5. None of the tumours showed staining for TTF-1 or napsin.
Conclusion: Thymic carcinomas are a rare type of cancer that can 
show a variety of histologic types. Squamous cell carcinoma is the 
most frequent subtype in our series and accounts for 66,6%. Thymic 
Neuroendocrine carcinoma are exceedingly rare neo-plasms (only 2 
cases in our series). Morphology and immunohistochemical mark-
ers do not differentiate between carcinomas of different locations, 
thus making it difficult to establish the exact site of origin in cases 
of metastatic tumours.

Ectopic mediastinal parathyroid adenoma: report of unusual 
location and literature review
O. Mnif*, R. Ayadi, E. Braham, M. Mlika, A. Rais, A. Ayadi, O. 
Ismail, F. El Mezni
*Abderrahmen Mami Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The mediastinal location of ectopic para-
thyroid adenomasis is unusual and it reported in up to 10% of cases. It 
is an important cause of refractory and recurrent hyperparathyroidism. 
The aim: describe the clinicopathological characteristics and discuss 
the differential diagnosis of this entity.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 14 cases of 
ectopic mediastinal parathyroid adenoma diagnosed at our depart-
ment between 2004 and 2021.
Results: There were 3 male and 11 female patients, aged between 
15 and 71 years with a mean of 57,72 years. All patients presented 
with manifestations of chronic hypercalcemia. They checked ele-
vated serum calcium levels and parathyroid hormone levels above 
normal range. Computed tomography of the chest showed an ante-
rior mediastinal mass (n=10) or posterior mass (n=1). All patients 
underwent a surgical resection. The postoperative pathology test 
confirmed that the mass was diagnosed as a parathyroid adenoma. 
The patients had a successful postoperative recovery and then were 
discharged from the hospital in good condition. Serum calcium and 
parathyroid hormone levels were normalized immediately.
Conclusion: An unusual location for a parathyroid adenoma is 
the mediastinum, and it can be a cause of persistent hyperparathy-
roidism. This study helps bring to light the necessity to consider 
the diagnosis of an ectopic parathyroid adenoma as an important 
differential diagnosis in mediastinal tumour with persistent hyper-
calcaemia, and as a cause of hyperparathyroidism.

Mesothlioma of the pericardium: report of 3 cases of a rare 
neoplasm

Jaidane, S. Hmissa
*Pathology Department, Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Mesothelioma is a rare malignancy that 
develops from mesothelial cells lining the pleura, pericardium and peri-
toneum. Pericardial mesotheliomas are exceedingly rare accounting for 
< 1% of malignant mesotheliomas .We describe the clinico-patholog-
ical and immunohistochemical characteristics of primary pericardial 
mesothelioma (PPM).
Methods: We report 3 cases of PPM collected from the Cancer 
Registry of the Center of Tunisia during a period of 22 years from 
2000 to 2021.
Results: Two patients were male, aged 56 and 65 years, pre-
sented chronic pericarditis with recurrent pericardial effusion for, 
respectively, 3 and 4 months. The latter developed symptoms post 
COVID-19 infection. One female patient, aged 44 years, developed 
acute heart failure by pericardial tamponade . Clinico-radiological 
investigations suspected PPM in 2 cases. The 65-year-old patient 
underwent pericardial decortication while the others had pericar-
dial biopsies. Microscopically, two mesotheliomas were of the 
epithelioid-subtype, displayed solid and tubulopapillary patterns, 
in which tumour cells showed mild nuclear atypia and low mitotic-
rate. One case was of sarcomatoid-subtype , showed spindle cells 
with marked atypia and frequent mitotic figures. All tumours 
expressed Cytokeratin 5/6, Calretinin, Vimentine, and WT1.
S348
Virchows Archiv (2022) 481 (Suppl 1):S1–S364

Conclusion: The diagnosis of PPM can be challenging, especially 
in small samples, due to non-neoplastic mimickers such as reactive 
pericarditis with mesothelial hyperplasia. A through pathological 
exam, cemented by a targeted immunohistochemical panel, remains 
the cornerstone for establishing an accurate diagnosis . PPM carries 
a bleak prognosis, given its non-specific symptoms that produce an 
insidious progress, its difficult surgical management and its slight 
benefit from radiation and chemotherapy.

Intrathymic melanoma: report of two cases with a rare 
localization
F. Fortarezza, F. Pezzuto*, F. Lunardi, V. Verzeletti, G. Cannone, 
M. Schiavon, F. Rea, F. Calabrese
*University of Padova, Italy
Background & objectives: Melanoma can have various visceral locali-
zations with or without the presence of a known skin origin. Thymic 
localization represents an exceptional event with rare cases reported in 
the literature. Herein we describe two cases of intrathymic melanoma.
Methods: All thymectomy cases performed in our centre 
over the last 20 years were reviewed and two cases of 
melanoma were found. Both cases were reviewed by expert 
pathologists. An extensive immunohistochemical panel 
and molecular analyses were performed to confirm the 
diagnosis. Clinical-pathological data of the two patients 
were collected.
Results: Case 1: A 53-year-old man accessed to the emergency 
room for dyspnoea and thoracic pain. The CT-scan showed 
a mass of the anterior mediastinum. A thymectomy was 
performed. Histological examination showed a neoplasm 
morphologically and immunohistochemically compatible with 
melanoma. Molecular examination showed no mutation of BRAF. 
Dermatological and gastrointestinal examination did not detect 
neither skin nor visceral melanoma.
Case 2: A 62-year-old man with a history of cutaneous mela-
noma showed a retrosternal mediastinal mass during radiologi-
cal follow-up. A thymectomy was performed and a diagnosis of 
intrathymic metastasis of melanoma was made. The neoplasm 
harboured the same mutation of the primary cutaneous melanoma 
(BRAF V600E) and showed a high PD-L1 expression.
Conclusion: Intrathymic localization of melanoma is an excep-
tionally rare event. When intrathymic localization represents the 
onset of the disease (as in the case of the patient 1), it raises the 
question about the existence of the primary melanoma of the thy-
mus or whether it is a metastasis from an occult skin melanoma. 
In-depth studies based on high throughput molecular investiga-
tions are needed to answer these questions.

Pleomorphic adenoma with PLAG1 fusion presenting as an 
isolated kidney mass: report of a challenging case
J. Lobo*, M. Rechsteiner, N.J. Rupp, H. Moch
*IPO Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Metastasizing pleomorphic adenoma is an 
infrequent diagnosis (81 cases described). Metastasizing pleomorphic 
adenoma involving the kidney is rare, with only eight cases disclosed 
until 2018. Presentation as a single incidental kidney mass is unusual.
Methods: We herein report a case of a pleomorphic adenoma pre-
senting as a kidney mass in a 43-year-old female, and discuss chal-
lenges in differential diagnosis with primary renal tumours.
Results: The tumour was low-grade and showed a triphasic pat-
tern, with ductal epithelial cells (strongly staining for CK7 and 
pan-cytokeratins), myoepithelial cells (proved by co-expression of 
p63, GFAP, S100, Calponin and SMA) and myxoid/oedematous 
stroma. Next generation sequencing identified a PLAG1 fusion 
typical of pleomorphic adenoma (also confirmed by immunohisto-
chemistry), and plasmacytoid features (frequently associated with 
PLAG fusions) were also present in our case. The diagnosis led to 
further clinical observation, and the patient referred that she had 
removed a pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland 36 years 
before, at age 12.
Conclusion: The case highlights the relevance of carefully exam-
ining the salivary glands and of exploring past medical history 
related to salivary gland disease (even decades before) when in 
the presence of myoepithelial differentiation, and underscores the 
usefulness of PLAG1 immunohistochemistry and molecular test-
ing for diagnosis.

Malignant triton tumour of the kidney in a 57-year-old male: 
a case report
A.C. Ablaza*, A. Llanes
*Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center, Philippines
Background & objectives: Preoperative diagnosis of malignant triton 
tumour (MTT) remains challenging as no specific imaging character-
istics distinguish it from other sarcomas. The aim is to describe a rare 
case of MTT of the kidney and its diagnostic challenges and patient 
outcomes.
Methods: Histopathologic examination and immunohistochemical 
staining with S-100, desmin, and myogenin were performed.
Results: Gross examination showed a 16 x 12.5 x 12.5 cm, cream-
white, fleshy mass almost replacing the entire kidney. Cut sections 
revealed whorled cut surfaces with areas of necrosis. Histologically, 
the tumour is composed of spindle shaped cells with pleomorphic, 
hyperchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and pale wavy 
cytoplasm, reminiscent of their Schwann cell origin. Seen within the 
tumour are several rhabdomyoblasts having large eccentric nuclei with 
prominent nucleoli and abundant densely eosinophilic cytoplasm. The 
tumour cells stained focally positive for S-100, desmin, and myogenin, 
indicating Schwannian and skeletal muscle differentiation.
Conclusion: MTT of the kidney is an exceptional occurrence and 
has a highly aggressive behaviour associated with rapid growth and 
propensity for early recurrence and metastasis. Preoperative diag-
nosis of this tumour is difficult, thus highlighting the importance 
of histopathology and immunohistochemistry in the definitive diag-
nosis. The optimal treatment strategy may depend on tumour char-
acteristics and clinical presentation and should be individualized.

literature. We report a case of a young female with a kidney mass, 
highlighting the microscopic characteristics of this tumour.
Methods: A 30-year-old female patient with an incidental tumour 
mass in her left kidney was admitted for surgical treatment. The 
abdominal computed tomography and MRI examinations revealed 
a well-defined heterogeneous enhancing lesion measuring 2.62 × 
2.38 cm located in the peripheric medial zone of the left kidney. 
Radical nephrectomy with locoregional lymphadenectomy was 
performed and microscopic evaluation was requested.
Results: The paraffin-embedded tissue demonstrated a nodular neo-
plasm composed of monomorphic round cells with eosinophilic cyto-
plasm and centrally located nuclei, admixed with delicate-branching 
vascular spaces and smooth muscle fibres. No evidence of increased 
mitotic index or necrosis was found. The neoplastic cells were positive 
for CD34, smooth muscle actin, desmin, calponin, CD117, and colla-
gen IV in a characteristic pericellular pattern. In contrast, tumour cells 
were negative for Melan A, HMB-45, S100, synaptophysin, cytokeratin 
AE1/AE3, CD31, and CD57. The Ki-67 staining index was 1%. Peri-
odic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining revealed well-defined cytoplasmatic 
membranes of the neoplastic cells. The morphological features and the 
immunohistochemical profile indicated a benign glomus tumour of the 
kidney, glomangiomyoma-subtype.
Conclusion: Primary glomus tumours of the kidney are rare, and 
they can mimic other renal neoplasms radiologically. By adding 
another case to the literature, we emphasize the histological and 
immunohistochemical features of this entity. A long-term follow-up 
is recommended despite its benign nature. It would be wise to 
investigate such rare cases of sporadic glomangiomas arising 
in young patients for an oncogenic mutation (BRAF and KRAS 
mutations or NOTCH gene rearrangement), but further research 
in this field is needed.

*University of Insubria, Italy
Background & objectives: Amphicrine carcinoma (AC) is a rare 
neoplasm with hybrid exocrine and neuroendocrine morphological, 
immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features. We present the case 
of an 82-year-old man which, to our knowledge, is the first report of an 
AC of the urinary bladder.
Methods: In May 2018 an 82-year-old man presented with 
painless gross haematuria at Circolo Hospital, ASST-Sette Laghi, 
Varese (Italy). Trans-urethral resection of the bladder (TURB) 
showed endoscopic evidence of a mass involving the posterior 
vesical wall which was biopsied. The patient also underwent 
cystoprostatectomy.
Results: TURB specimen revealed a muscolaris-propria-
infiltrating neoplasia with tumoral necrosis, cytoplasmatic 
granularity, extra- and intra-cellular Alcian+ mucins.

MUC2+ (patchy), MUC6-, abnormal (hyper-expressed) p53, 
Rb1-, p16+. Proliferative index (Ki-67): 90%. The concomitant 
presence of dense-core neuroendocrine and exocrine mucinous 
vesicles within the same neoplastic cell was confirmed 
with the use of transmission electron microscope and with 
colloidal-gold ultrastructural immunocytochemistry. Final 
diagnosis was AC of the vesical bladder.
Similar results were present in the cystoprostatectomy specimens 
which brought to a pT3b pN0 pathologic staging.
The patient eventually died after 434 days from bioptical diag-
nosis of AC for multiple systemic infections.
Conclusion: We present the first reported case of bona fide 
AC of the urinary bladder. While the differential diagnosis 
with metastatic adenocarcinoma and urachal carcinoma is 
of paramount importance, recognizing the hybrid exocrine-
neuroendocrine nature of these neoplasms is key with regard to 
the acquisition of further knowledge on this rare entity.

V600E BRAF mutation in Rosai-Dorfman disease with testis-
brain localization
N.P. Tenace*, M.G. Cangi, R. Lucianò, L. Pecciarini, G. 
Grassini, G. Magliacane, M. Ponzoni, C. Doglioni, M. Colecchia
*Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy
Background & objectives: Rosai Dorfman disease (RDD) is a rare 
form of systemic non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. RDD classical 
presentation is with lymphadenomegaly, but extranodal sites may be 
involved. We described the immunohistochemical and molecular pro-
file of an unusual testicular/cerebral RDD.
Methods: A 54-year-old male patient presented at San Raffaele 
Hospital with an unusual testicular enlargement and neurological 
alterations characterized by gait disorders, dysarthria, and dys-
esthesia in the four limbs dating since a year. On MRI, a pontine 
mass was found, with PET enhancement, detected bilaterally in 
the testes and at the root of abdominal aortic arterial branches. 
Monolateral orchiectomy was performed.
Results: On macroscopic examination, the testis appeared to 
be slightly increased in size with the presence of interspersed 
miliary-shaped yellowish formations in the parenchyma. 
Histologically, nodules of large, pale histiocytes (S-100+/
CD163+/CD68+/CD207-/CD1a-) with emperipolesis were 
observed. Diagnosis of Rosai-Dorfman disease, extranodal 
subtype, was made. Molecular analysis performed on testicular 
tissue detected V600E BRAF gene mutation; the same mutation 
was detected in cerebrospinal fluid.
Conclusion: RDD usually has an indolent course, characterized 
by frequent spontaneous remission. RDD localization to the tes-
ticular parenchyma is extremely rare and our case is the first 
with synchronous presentation to the central nervous system. 
The V600E BRAF gene mutation is extremely rare in RDD; it has 
been described till now only in brain RDD localizations. BRAF 
mutation in our case, besides relevant clinical opportunities, sug-
gests a testis-brain axis for this form of RDD

Basaloid carcinoma of the bladder: is it a new variant with 
poor prognosis? Case report
I. Elouarith*, K. Znati, A. Jahid, Z. Bernoussi, F. Zouaidia
*Ibn Sina University Hospital Center, Morocco
Background & objectives: Basaloid carcinoma is an exceptional vari-
ant of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder.
We aim through this case, the 4th in the literature, to describe the 
pathological features of this entity and highlight its poor prognosis 
according to our experience.
Methods: A 51-year-old patient consulted for haematuria with 
bladder mass on imaging. So, he underwent a cystprostatectomy. 
Histological study confirmed the diagnosis of basaloid squamous 
cell carcinoma of the bladder. The patient subsequently benefited 
from chemotherapy, but died after the third session.

Results: Squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder constitutes 2% 
to 7% of urothelial cancers. The basaloid variant of squamous cell 
carcinoma is exceptional in the bladder and only three cases have 
already been reported in the literature.
Histologically, the morphological appearance of basaloid 
carcinoma of the bladder is identical to that of basaloid carcinomas 
in other anatomical sites such as the lung.
The treatment of this tumour is not specific due to the lack of 
clinical data; it is essentially based on surgery. The importance of 
adjuvant treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy is unclear.
Basaloid carcinoma has a more aggressive clinical course and 
poorer prognosis than conventional squamous cell carcinoma.
Conclusion: Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder is 
a very rare entity with a poor prognosis. The diagnosis of this rare 
variant is based on histological study.
The optimal treatment has yet to be defined due to the limited data 
available.

Nizyaeva, L. Mikhaleva
*National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynaecology 
and Perinatology named after Academician V.I. Kulakov, Russia
Background & objectives: Glycodelin (Gd) is expressed in various 
types of cancer and correlates differently with the diagnosis and prog-
nosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical 
expression of Gd in areas of adenocarcinoma, hyperplasia, and intact 
prostate tissue.
Methods: The study included 64 men diagnosed with prostate 
cancer aged 50 to 79 years. By immunohistochemical (IHC) study 
using monoclonal mouse antibodies to the peptide part of Gd we 
evaluate localization and intensity of staining (in points (0-3) in 
cancerous foci, areas of hypertrophy and areas of normal glandular 
tissue of the prostate.
Results: We have revealed IHC cytoplasmic expression of Gd in 
prostate tissue, both in normal and pathologically altered areas. 
The lowest median staining intensity in the cytoplasm of tumour 
cells was in younger patients aged 50-59 years (0 (0; 1)), in higher 
degree of cell differentiation ISUP 1 (0 (0; 1)), as well as in the 
group without metastases (0.5(0; 1.125)). In unchanged areas of 
the prostate, the lowest median staining intensity was also recorded 
in groups aged 50-59 years (0.5 (0; 1)) and without metastases 
(0.5 (0; 1))
Conclusion: In this study, we have shown the expression of Gd 
in prostate cancer samples for the first time. Low expression of 
Gd probably characterizes a more favourable course of prostate 
cancer. This fact can serve as a prerequisite for further research 
and clarification of the role of Gd in carcinogenesis.

triadi, M. Lenos, G. Theodoropoulou, G. Kakiopoulos, K. Ntoumas
*Department of Pathology, "G. Gennimatas" General Hospital, 
Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: Cystic nephroma is a rare renal mixed 
epithelial –stromal tumour. It presents in children, rarely in adults. 
Herein we present a case of a 40-years-old woman with a history of 
brain surgery for craniopharyngioma She was also under cortisone 
therapy.
Methods: we received in two parts, left kidney weighting 306gr 
and measuring 11X6X4cm. On cutting there was a tumour measur-
ing 11X5X5 cm extending from the upper pole to the middle of the 
kidney. There was not a clear capsule. The tumour was multicyctic 
and the cystic component had a smooth surface. The rest of the 
kidney was macroscopically normal.
Results: Pathological examination revealed a biphasic tumour. The 
epithelial component was represented by cystic spaces covered by a 
single (rarelly multiple) layer of flattened or cubical cells without 
atypia. The epithelial cells were monomorphic, with scant cyto-
plasm The stromal component was represented by spindles cells 
arranged in small fascicles without atypia too. There were neither 
mitotic activity, nor necrosis. The immunohistochemistry showed 
positivity for KerAE1/AE3 and Ker34βΕ12, as well as PAX-8. The 
stromal component was negative for CD34.
Conclusion: The diagnosis was : cystic nephroma (adult type). 
This tumour is a rarely observed tumour. It has a benign course. 
Partial nephrectomy is an appropriate treatment. Long term follow 
up is recommended to avoid malignant transformation, local recur-
rence, or metastasis. To our knowledge, it is the first such tumour 
that relates with craniopharyngioma.

*Pathology, McMaster University, Canada
Background & objectives: The Canadian Kidney Cancer informa-
tion system (CKCis) is a prospective, fourteen-institution database col-
laboration of the Kidney Cancer Research Network of Canada. This 
study assessed tumour stage by size for clear cell renal cell carcinoma 
(ccRCC) within the CKCis database.
Methods: All ccRCC resections in CKCis database were retrieved 
and stratified by pathology tumour size (≤4 cm, >4 to ≤7 cm, 
>7 cm). Each institution’s staged by size criteria (SBSC) rates 
for different tumour size brackets were assessed and compared 
via funnel plots. A sub-analysis at one institution reviewed the 
pathology reports and assessed for possible causes of variation.
Results: 4,804 ccRCC resections met inclusion criteria. By size 
≤4 cm, >4to≤7 cm and >7 cm were 2,213, 1,418, and 1,172 cases, 
respectively. For pT1a tumours, the SBSC was 2,030 cases, insti-
tutional SBSC rate range was 75-95%, median rate was 90% and 
there were 3 of 14 outlier institutions outside the 95% confidence 
interval. For pT1b the numbers were 919, 38-77%, 66% and 4 of 
14. For pT2 the numbers were 281, 10-34%, 27% and 3 of 14. 
The sub-analysis demonstrated insufficient renal sinus sampling 
and significant provider variation among seven pathologists that 
each examined >60 ccRCC cases (p<0.05); the pT2 rate for >7cm 
ccRCCs range was 0-41%.
Conclusion: This analysis suggests there is significant variation 
of the pathologic stage for ccRCC. Literature benchmarks suggest 
an over-call of pT2. The focused sub-analysis suggests both the 
grossing and microscopic interpretation can be significant factors 
in pT2 over-call. pT2 rate for >7 cm ccRCC should be followed

as a quality metric, as recommendations for adjuvant therapy may 
depend on differentiation between pT2/pT3. Secondary reviews of 
pT2 ccRCCs by urologic pathologists may assist in optimizing risk 
stratification and patient management.

Clear cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder of Müllerian type 
- a case report
G. Stanc*, N. Novkovic, M. Papadopoulos, M. Papazian, C. Vala-
vanis, E. Souka
*Pathology Department Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Müllerian neoplasms of the urinary sys-
tem are rare and are subdivided into Clear Cell Carcinoma (CCC) and 
Endometrioid Carcinoma. These neoplasms have been associated with 
endometriosis and Müllerian duct remnants.
Methods: A female 65 years old was referred to our hospital for 
haematuria. A transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) 
was performed. On gross examination the specimen from the uri-
nary bladder had no uncommon aspects.
Results: On histological examination a high grade invasive ade-
nocarcinoma was observed showing a predominant solid growth 
with rare tubulocystic or papillary patterns. The neoplastic cells 
displayed abundant clear cytoplasm and hobnail morphology. The 
carcinoma invaded lamina propria and submucosa while the mus-
cularis propria was free from invasion in our specimen.
The immunohistochemistry was positive for CK7, CA125, 
AMACR, Napsin A, PAX-8 and negative for ER, PgR, GATA-3, 
p63, CK20, CDX2, PSAP.
In correlation with the clinical information a diagnosis of CCC of 
Müllerian type was made.
Conclusion: Müllerian type CCC of the lower urinary tract is 
rare, it has a higher incidence in elderly females and requires 
radical treatment with variable outcomes. Prompt diagnosis and 
multidisciplinary approach are indispensable for management. Due 
to its rarity and lack of long-term follow-up, the prognosis of this 
entity remains unclear.

Extramammary Pagets disease: a case report
G. Crilly*, N. Shah
*University Hospital Waterford, Ireland
Background & objectives: Extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD) 
is a rare intraepithelial carcinoma arising in areas rich in glands, 
including the vulva, scrotum, penis, perineum and axilla. EMPD 
typically presents in older adults (>80) as an erythematous, itchy 
lesion, often initially diagnosed as eczema.
Methods: We present the case of an 80 year old gentleman present-
ing with an 18 month history of an erythematous, non-pruritic rash 
of the penile shaft. Past medical history was significant for diabetes 
mellitus, ischaemic heart disease and radiotherapy-treated prostate 
cancer 8 years previous.
Results: An excision biopsy of the rash showed a population 
of nested atypical cells infiltrating into the epidermis. These 
cells had pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli and mitotic 
activity. Underlying adnexal structures were involved but there 
was no evidence of dermal invasion. We performed a number of 
immunohistochemical stains to further characterize this lesion. The 
cells were positive for AE1/AE3, CK7, EMA, BerEP4, GATA3 
and CEA. Focal positivity was noted for CK20 and GCDFF15. 
PAX8 was weakly positive. The cells were negative for CK5/6, p63, 
CDX2 and melanocytic markers. This gentleman was diagnosed 
with a primary extra-mammary Pagets disease of the penis.
Conclusion: EMPD is a rare carcinoma which requires a high 
index of suspicion, particularly in the elderly and those with failed 
medical management. The most common area affected are the vulva 
(65%) and perineum (20%) while the penis and scrotum account for 
14% of EMPD cases. Patients are often initially treated with topi-
cal steroids and ointments without improvement. A median time 
to diagnosis of 2 years has been reported. Surgical resection is the 
treatment of choice for EMPD.

Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the urinary bladder arising from 
squamous cell carcinoma. A case review
G. Galanopoulos*, L. Karelis, E. Souka, M. Terzi, M. Papadopou-
los, O. Tzaida
*Pathology Department Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Bladder cancer is the 10th most common 
malignancy worldwide with a male to female ratio of 4:1. The majority 
(95%) of cases consists of urothelial carcinoma. We present a rare case 
of sarcomatoid carcinoma of the urinary bladder.
Methods: A 77 year-old male patient was admitted for scheduled 
radical cystoprostatectomy due to previously diagnosed muscle 
invasive (T2) squamous cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder on 
TURBT chips. Gross examination of the bladder specimen revealed 
a whitish exophytic friable tumour, measuring 9X4cm, along with 
areas of ulceration.
Results: Histopathological examination revealed two distinct and in 
close proximity malignant cell populations; a squamous cell carci-
noma component mostly regarding the exophytic tumour and a high-
grade malignant spindle cell tumour infiltrating large portion of the 
muscle wall and partially invading the pervesical fat. The latter also 
showed areas of osseous differentiation. In situ urothelial carcinoma 
was also present in the superficial epithelium. Prostate, bilateral semi-
nal vesicles, vas deferens, and ureteric margins were free of tumour. 
On immunohistochemical analysis, spindle cells were positive for 
Vimentin, SMA and negative for CK5/6, GATA 3, CK7, p40. The 
aforementioned results established the diagnosis of sarcomatoid 
carcinoma.
Conclusion: Bladder sarcomatoid carcinoma is a rare malig-
nant type and is estimated to account for 0.1%–0.3% of all blad-
der tumours. Less than 100 case reports have been published in 
the literature. It is characterized by the presence of an epithelial 
urothelial and a sarcomatous population. For most cases the epi-
thelial component is urothelial carcinoma, however, squamous cell 
and small cell carcinoma components have also frequently been 
reported. Due to aggressive nature of disease, it is usually diag-
nosed at advanced stage.

urinary tract. 4–17% of the cases develop urethral recurrence after 
cystectomy affecting the prostatic gland either by invasion or by 
pagetoid extension through the prostatic duct.
Methods: A patient 70-years-old was admitted to our hospital 
with a previous prostate needle biopsy, which on histopathologi-
cal examination showed urothelial carcinoma extending into the 
prostatic ducts. We review the biopsy and proceed to bladder 
biopsy from different sites. A biopsy of prostatic urethra was made 
too. After the pathology results a radical cystoprostatectomy was 
decided.
Results: All urinary bladder biopsies showed in situ urothelial 
carcinoma. In the specimen of radical cystoprostatectomy, after 
extensive sampling, the histopathology examination showed in situ 
urothelial carcinoma which involved prostatic ducts and glands in 
a pagetoid manner, without invasive component. The same lesions 
were recognized in both ureters. The seminal vesicles, the pros-
tatic urethra margin and both ureteral margins were negative for 
in situ or invasive carcinoma. All ten lymph nodes were negative 
for metastatic carcinoma.
The immunohistochemistry was positive for GATA-3, p63, CK20 
and negative for PSAP and PSA. The p63 and CK14 shows pres-
ence of myoepithelial cells surrounding prostatic ducts and glands.
Conclusion: Conservatory treatment is an option for in situ 
urothelial carcinoma extending in the prostatic duct. Radical 
surgery is the best treatment for extensive intraductal prostatic 
involvement. The clinicopathologic features associated with 
an increased risk of urethral recurrence are: involvement of 
the urinary bladder neck or trigone, diffuse carcinoma in situ, 
multifocality, synchronous upper urinary tract tumours, 
involvement of the prostatic urethra or deep prostatic invasion 
and the positive urethral margins.

Seminoma in a case of ovotesticular disease (true 
Hermaphrodith)
S. Cagaptay*, C. Altay, G. Aslan, K. Yorukoglu
*Dokuz Eylül University Faculty of Medicine, Turkey
Background & objectives: Ovotesticular disorder is defined as the 
presence of both ovaries and testes in the same person, regardless of 
karyotype. Patients with ovotesticular disorder have a higher risk of 
developing gonadal neoplasms such as gonadoblastoma or seminoma 
than the general population.
Methods: The karyotype analysis of a 32-year-old male patient 
with phenotype who was examined for bilateral abdominal unde-
scended testis was 46 XY. In his radiological examination, a 
complex internal genital structure compatible with ovotestis was 
detected. The patient whose operation material was examined in 
our unit is presented with histopathological and clinical features.
Results: Macroscopically, the specimen consisted of bilobed gonadal 
structures and a single cordial structure adjacent to it. In the histopatho-
logical examination, in addition to seminoma, tissues including vesicle 
seminalis, atrophic testis, tuba uterina, endometrium and endocervix 
component were seen. Most of the structures thought to belong to the 
female genital tract were not of the usual morphology, possibly due to 
insufficient hormonal effect. Immunohistochemical markers contrib-
uted greatly to the distinction of the organs and diagnosis. The patient, 
who was diagnosed with ovotestis and Stage I seminoma based on 
histopathological findings, received a single dose of carboplatin chemo-
therapy and free of disease at 6th month of follow-up.
Conclusion: Ovostesticular disorder is a very rare sex develop-
mental disorder, with a 10% risk of germ cell tumour develop-
ment in 46XY and mosaicism cases.
As a result, orchiectomy is required in the presence of an unde-
scended testis or development of a tumour. Because male and 
female genital organs have similar morphological and immuno-
histochemical features, a multidisciplinary approach is required 
for pathological examination.

Old markers, new perspective in urothelial carcinoma
L. Cristina*, O. Stefan, G. Tudor, V. Nica, V. Mitroi, L. Nichita
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Bladder cancer is one of most common 
malignancies of the urinary tract. The present study was conducted 
to study the immunoexpression of CD10, c-KIT and Her2 protein in 
urothelial carcinoma and to correlate it with histological grade and 
pathological stage.
Methods: 41patients were subjected TURBT for non-muscle-
invasive and muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma between 
2019-2021 in our hospital.CD10, HER2 and c-KIT membranous/
cytoplasmic expressions in cells were the main variables of 
interest; strong-positive result is defined as strong/moderate 
immunoreactivity in >50% cells(2+), weak-positive result is 
defined as mild immunoreactivity of <50% of tumour cells(1+) 
and cells with faint/no staining will be scored as negative(0).
Results: High-grade T2 tumours showed strong or week expression 
of all the markers that we used: HER2 staining was graded 2+ 
in 2/8 high-grade T2 tumours (25%) and 1+ in 3/8 high-grade 
T2 tumours (37,5%). Strong and week immunoreactivity of c-KIT 
was noted in 12,5% respectively 25% in this category of tumours. 
50% (4/8 high-grade T2 tumours) showed strong membranous 
staining for CD10. Regarding of Ta and T1 high-grade tumours, 
week expression of HER2 (4/25 tumours), c-KIT (5/25 tumours) 
and CD10 (6/25 tumours) was observed. All low-grade Ta and T1 
tumours were negative.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that overexpression of HER2 
protein, expression of CD10 and c-KIT is correlated with high-
grade tumours and stage, suggesting its possible role in patho-
genesis and progression of urothelial carcinoma.

A bone in the bladder – rare case report and review of 
literature
O. Stefan*, G. Tudor, L. Cristina, A. Toma, V. Mitroi, M. Cio-
plea, L. Nichita
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Stromal osseous metaplasia (SOM) is one 
of the three instances of bone formation within bladder tumours. It is 
also the least common, with a total of 21 cases reported in the English 
literature. Here, we report an additional case.
Methods: A 64-year-old man with a history of multiple acute 
cystitis presented to our hospital with urinary retention. Cys-
toscopy revealed a 3 cm pedunculated tumour with papillary 
architecture located on the right lateral bladder wall, removed 
with transurethral resection.
Results: Pathological examination was performed on pink-tan to 
grey friable tissue fragments that varied from soft and gelatinous 
to firm. Microscopy showed papillary projections lined by a thick 
layer of stratified transitional epithelial cells with central fibro-
vascular cores, with orderly architecture and mild pleomorphism. 
Invasion through the basement membrane was not identified.

These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of low grade 
non-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma. Rare lamellated or 
coarse-fibred bone trabeculae separated by loose fibrous connec-
tive tissue with osteoid seams were found in the tumour stroma. 
Numerous cells with blue cytoplasm that correspond to osteo-
blasts outlined those osteoid and bony structures, without atypia 
or pleomorphic stromal cells.
Conclusion: Stromal osseous metaplasia is a rare benign condi-
tion found in urothelial carcinomas. Its presence has no effect 
on their therapeutic approach, which is determined by histologic 
grade and tumour stage. Metaplastic bone, on the other hand, 
must be distinguished from malignant osteogenous conditions, 
most notably sarcomatoid carcinoma.

Histoepidemiological study of eosinophilic metaplasia of the 
prostate gland
M. Koleva*, D. Dikov
*Department of General and Clinical Pathology, Medical Uni-
versity of Plovdiv, Bulgaria; University Hospital “St. George’’ 
Plovdiv, Bulgaria
Background & objectives: The current study investigates the rela-
tion between prostatic eosinophilic metaplasia (EM) in a large series 
of cases with the basic prostate pathology in transurethral resection 
of the prostate (TURP) material. The study is supported by statistical 
analysis of the results.
Methods: 61 TURP-specimens were reviewed for the presence of 
EM. Simultaneously BPH, BCH, PCa and National Institutes of 
Health-category IV prostatitis (so-called histologic prostatitis – HP 
-acute and chronic) were evaluated.
Results: Prostatic EM was found in 34/61 cases (55.7%). This high 
frequency of EM in TURP correlated to the HP (p=0.000), BCH 
(p=0.000), and BPH (p=NA). No difference in patient’s age, clini-
cal and laboratory data (PSA was found).
Conclusion: The study presents the first attempt to quantify with 
statistical analysis the association between prostatic EM in a series 
of patients in the context of basic pathology in TURP-material. Our 
results enrich the available information about morphogenesis and 
relation between EM and other prostatic diseases.
Сhronic inflammation (HP), persistent irritation (BPH) and BCH 
are basis of adult stem cells metaplastic conversion in some 
organ(prostate). The frequent combination between these processes 
is in favour of their unified molecular and cellular pathogenesis.

Sarcomatoid spermatocytic tumour: report of a rare case
E. Dvindenko*, A. Dias, F. Santos, R. Cabrera
*Instituto Português de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, 
Portugal
Background & objectives: Spermatocytic tumour (ST) accounts for 
1% of testicular germ cell tumours. It is an indolent neoplasm with 
good prognosis. Sarcomatous dedifferentiation may occur, portending 
an aggressive behaviour and representing a significant diagnostic chal-
lenge that can lead to its misdiagnosis.
Methods: Herein, we report the clinicopathological features of a 
case of sarcomatoid ST, initially misdiagnosed as malignant mixed 
germ cell tumour (MMGCT), which was referred to our institution 
with lung metastases exclusively composed of rhabdomyosarco-
matous elements.
Results: A 46-year-old man with bilateral lung metastases 
and a history of right radical orchiectomy for MMGCT (with 
teratoma, yolk-sac tumour and seminoma components) was 
referred to our institution for further therapy. Serum markers 
were all negative, and a lung biopsy was performed, reveal-
ing a rhabdomyosarcoma. Slides of the testicular mass were 
reviewed and showed a high-grade spindle and rhabdmyo-
blastic sarcoma with focal positivity for desmin, myoD1 and 
myogenin, and a minor component of spermatocytic tumour 
with colonization of peritumoral seminiferous tubules. A final 
diagnosis of sarcomatous ST with rabdhomyosarcomatous lung 
metastases was rendered. The patient developed brain metas-
tases and underwent chemoradiotherapy and neurosurgery, but 
died 10 months after orchiectomy.
Conclusion: ST is generally described as having an excel-
lent prognosis. The presence of a sarcomatous component is 
a well-established event that renders a poor prognosis, despite 
aggressive systemic therapy and, as in this case, may be mis-
interpreted as teratoma. In addition, colonization of seminifer-
ous tubules can be mistaken with in-situ germ cell neoplasia. 
Awareness of this entity and its peculiarities is essential for 
its recognition and further adequate management of patients.

*Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Testicular metastatic carcinoma is a rare 
entity, often the primary is a prostatic adenocarcinoma. We report a 
new case incidentally discovered, to emphasize the importance of the 
examination of the testicles in the assessment of extension of prostatic 
cancer.
Methods: An 82 year-old man followed for prostatic 
adenocarcinoma consulted for clotting and deglobulating 
haematuria. Physical examination finds a right testicular mass. An 
endoscopic resection with bilateral orchiectomy was performed for 
voiding and haemostasis.
Results: The testicular examination showed an invasive carci-
nomatous proliferation dissociating the seminiferous tubules 
made of clusters and patches of cells with some glandular 
structures leaning in cribriform massifs. The tumour cells 
have a similar appearance to those of the prostatic tumour; 
large cell with amphophilic cytoplasm and a very atypi-
cal and highly mitotic nucleus with a prominent nucleolus. 
there are many lymphatic emboli. On immunohistochemistry, 
tumour cells were diffusely positive for CK and PSA. We con-
cluded to the diagnosis of testicular metastasis of prostatic 
adenocarcinoma.
Conclusion: Testicular metastases are very rare in known patients 
with prostate cancer. Careful physical examination through speci-
men sampling and imaging of all the possible sites of metastasis 
are indispensable in the process of identifying metastasis.

Background & objectives: Undifferentiated carcinoma with osteo-
clast-like giant cells of the urinary tract are rare, with less than 15 cases 
described involving the renal pelvis. Another case is presented, with 
the aim of delving the clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical and 
biological behaviour of this entity.
Methods: A case of a 63-year-old male, with no medical history of 
interest, who attends the urology office due to haematuria and right 
flank pain. An ultrasound and a URO-TAC with contrast is requested, 
where a repletion defect of 3.3 x 2.5 cm in the right upper calicial 
group was detected. The patient underwent a right nephroureterectomy.
Results: Histological study revealed an eosinophilic biphasic 
tumour composed of a monotonous population of mononuclear 
cells with round-oval nuclei and slight nuclear pleomorphism, 
with prominent nucleoli, as well as numerous intercalated oste-
oclast-like giant cells. There were areas of necrosis with several 
mitoses per high magnification field. This lesion was associated 
with urothelial carcinoma (UC) in situ. The immunohistochemical 
study was positive for GATA3 and vimentin in the mononuclear 
component and positive for CD68 in the multinucleated giant cells. 
On the other hand, it was negative for ß-HCG and pankeratin in 
both components. The definitive diagnosis was Undifferentiated 
carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells (UCOGC).
Conclusion: UCOGC is diagnosed mainly in elderly patients 
with male predominance [3:1]. The intimate association of these 
tumours with UC and their immunohistochemical profile supports 
an epithelial origin for the mononuclear cells and non-neoplastic 
reactive histiocytic lineage for the osteoclast-like giant cells. The 
differential diagnosis is made with sarcomatoid carcinoma of the 
renal pelvis, UC with anaplastic giant cells and UC with divergent 
trophoblastic differentiation. It is important to keep this entity in 
mind because of its dismal prognosis.

Study of TERT mutations in uropathological biopsies. Use of a 
molecular technique in a daily practice
O.B. Popescu*, E. García Fernández, P. González-Peramato
*Hospital Universitario de Guadalajara, Spain
Background & objectives: TERT promoter mutations are the most 
common somatic alteration identified in urinary bladder cancer. We 
present a review of 34 urinary tract biopsies and resection specimens 
with benign and malignant results, between 2018 and 2022, diagnosed 
at a Tertiary Hospital.
Methods: We reviewed 34 specimens of 27 patients, including 26 
malignant lesions, 7 benign lesions such as hyperplasia, verrucous 
squamous hyperplasia, papilloma and 1 papillary neoplasm of low 
malignant potential. We also included one specimen of transure-
thral prostatic resection with neuroendocrine carcinoma and one 
lymph node metastasis of urothelial origin. TERT mutation analy-
sis was performed.
Results: The twenty-seven patients were represented by 5 female 
and 22 male. The average age was 63 years (range 13-89). Primary 
site was bladder for 23 specimens (67.64%) and upper urinary tract 
for 9 specimens (26.47%). One case corresponded to a lymph node 
metastasis by carcinoma of urothelial origin and one case was a 
neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate.
TERT mutation was positive in 16 malignant lesions (61.53% of 
all malignant lesions) and in verrucous squamous hyperplasia and 
was negative 6 benign lesions (85.71% of all benign lesions), 8 
malignant lesions (38.47% of all malignant lesions), 1 papillary 
neoplasm of low malignant potential.
Conclusion: TERT promoter mutations are the most com-
mon genetic alteration in urothelial carcinoma. We found 
TERT mutations occurring in papillary urothelial carcinoma, 
variant-predominant histology such as nested, neuroendocrine and 
clear cell carcinoma and sarcomatoid carcinoma of the bladder. The 
majority of benign lesions were negative. TERT analysis is very 
useful in small biopsies. It can also be useful in sarcomatoid car-
cinomas of the bladder and in metastases of unknown origin where 
the positivity for TERT mutation can support urothelial origin.

Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Prostate cancer is the second most com-
mon cancer in men. It generally metastasizes to the lymph nodes, bone, 
and liver. Ureteral metastasis from prostate cancer is extremely rare. 
We present a case of prostatic adenocarcinoma revealed by ureteral 
metastasis.
Methods: We report a case of a 58-year-old man with meta-
static prostatic carcinoma incidentally diagnosed following 
ureterectomy.
Results: Our patient, who has a history of nephrolithiasis, pre-
sented with acute renal failure. Ultrasonography and computed 
tomography showed right hydroureteronephrosis secondary to 
obstruction of the pelvic ureter; atrophy of the left kidney and 
hypertrophy of the prostate. Ureteral urothelial carcinoma was 
suspected. Because the right kidney was a solitary function-
ing kidney, our patient underwent segmental ureterectomy with 
lymph-node excision. Pathologic examination revealed ureteral 
and lymph-node metastases of prostate adenocarcinoma. Immu-
nohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis (positivity for PSA, 
P504s and negativity for GATA3 and p63). Subsequently, serum 
PSA test was made and its level was 41.14 ng/mL. Prostate MRI 
found a locally advanced prostatic tumour classified T4N+. The 
patient started hormone therapy.
Conclusion: Ureteral metastasis from prostatic adenocarcinoma 
is rare. It can present with obstructive symptoms or as an asymp-
tomatic mass on imaging. Due to the difficulty in making a pre-
operative diagnosis, it is typically diagnosed after nephroureter-
ectomy. Prostate cancer should be considered in the differential 
diagnosis of elderly men presenting with ureteral tumour. PSA 
test should be done on all patients over 50 to exclude the diagno-
sis of metastatic ureteral tumour from prostate cancer.

Recurrent deep angiomyxoma of the bladder neck presenting 
as voiding dysfunction: a case report
W. Lee*, Y. Lee, S. Choi
*College of Medicine Dankook University, Republic of Korea
Background & objectives: Deep (aggressive) angiomyxoma is a 
benign, locally infiltrative, myxoid soft tissue tumour that most com-
monly arises in the deep soft tissues of the pelviperineal region of 
women. Deep angiomyxoma of the bladder has been extremely rarely 
reported.
Methods: A 57-year-old male patient presented with recently 
aggravated voiding difficulty. Twelve years ago, the patient had 
undergone transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate and blad-
der tumour due to voiding symptoms. Computed tomography 
revealed a 3 cm sized heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the

bladder neck. TUR of the prostate and bladder tumour was per-
formed for the second time.
Results: Histologically, TUR tissue revealed an ill-defined, 
infiltrative tumour composed of bland spindle cells within an 
abundant myxoid matrix interspersed with prominent vessels. 
Immunohistochemically, the spindle cells were positive for pro-
gesterone receptor and negative for oestrogen receptor. The his-
topathology was the same as that of the initial TUR specimen. 
The diagnosis of recurrent deep angiomyxoma of the bladder 
neck was confirmed.
Conclusion: Though rare, deep angiomyxoma of the bladder 
neck should be considered as a cause of obstructive urinary 
symptoms.

Primary Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumour 
of the kidney: a rare case report
J. Baena-Del Valle*, D.M. Bertel-Rodriguez, M.A. Palau-Lazaro
*Fundacion Santa Fe De Bogota, Universidad De Los Andes, 
Colombia
Background & objectives: Ewing sarcoma/Primitive neuroectodermal 
tumour (ES/PNET) are undifferentiated tumours that originate from 
neuroectoderm. The occurrence in kidney is extremely rare (<1% of 
renal tumours), with less than 150 cases reported. We present a case 
of a young adult with a renal-ES/PNET.
Methods: A 18-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain 
and haematuria. A computed tomography showed a 20 x 14 x 10 cm 
mass on the left kidney. A left radical nephrectomy was performed. 
Histology showed a small round cell malignant tumour with areas 
of necrosis and frequent mitosis.
Results: Tumour cells were positive for CD99, synaptophysin and 
Fli-1. TLE-1, S100, AE1/AE3, EMA, CD34, desmin, CD45, GATA-
3, WT-1 and PAX-8 were negative. Ki-67 was 20%. Fluorescence 
in situ hybridization for the translocation EWS-FLI1/t(11;22) 
was negative. Due to the rarity of this tumour, neoplasms like 
blastemal-Wilms tumour, neuroblastoma, lymphoma, small cell 
carcinoma, rhabdoid tumour, desmoplastic small round cell tumour 
and synovial sarcoma, must to be excluded. Immunohistochemistry 
is helpful, but there could be immunophenotypic overlap that 
requires molecular testing.
t(11;22) has been reported in approximately 70% of the kidney ES/
PNET, but other members of the ETS genes have less frequently 
been reported as variants, supporting the diagnosis in this case.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of ES/PNET of the kidney depends 
on an integrated approach that includes histology, immunohisto-
chemistry and molecular/genetic testing. Accuracy in the diagnosis 
is critical because compared to other primary renal tumours, ES/
PNET have a poor prognosis and an specific multimodal therapy.

Paraganglioma of the urinary bladder: two cases report
J. Baena-Del Valle*, D.M. Bertel-Rodriguez, C.A. Medina-Mar-
quez, M. Plata-Salazar, M.A. Palau-Lazaro
*Fundacion Santa Fe De Bogota, Universidad De Los Andes, 
Colombia
Background & objectives: Paragangliomas are rare, especially in 
the bladder. They represent 0.05% of bladder tumours and less than 
1% of paragangliomas. Due to its rarity and symptomatic variability, 
preoperative diagnosis is often difficult. We present two cases of 
bladder paragangliomas in adults.
Methods: 2 women, 54 and 59 years-old, presented with abdominal 
pain. Laboratory studies were normal. In both cases a cystoscopy 
revealed lesions less than 5 cm in the bladder wall, and a tran-
surethral resection was performed. Histology showed solid nests 
and sheets of small granular cells with salt-and-pepper chromatin. 
Mitotic rate was low, and no necrosis or lymphovascular invasion 
was identified.
Results: Tumour cells were positive for chromogranin, synapto-
physin, CD56 and GATA-3. S100 highlighted the sustentacular 
cells, and Ki-67 was 2 - 5%. Keratin markers were negative. These 
findings were consistent with nonfunctional paragangliomas, and 
no recurrence has been reported so far.
Bladder paragangliomas arise from the chromaffin cells of the 
bladder, explaining their intramural location. In nonfunctional 
cases the most important differential diagnosis is urothelial car-
cinoma. Reactivity for CD56, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and 
S-100 are helpful in this distinction. Also, lack of reactivity with 
keratins, specially CK7, helps rule out other neuroendocrine 
neoplasms.
Conclusion: Bladder paragangliomas may present clinical, radio-
logical and pathological features similar to bladder cancer, with 
few cases reported in the literature. Early and correct identification 
is key to avoid misdiagnosis and overtreatment.
Complete surgical removal of the lesion is considered the definitive 
treatment, either by transurethral resection or partial cystectomy, 
but long clinical and biological follow-up is warranted, as local 
recurrence can occur very late after the surgery.

Intermediate-risk solitary fibrous tumour of the prostate pre-
senting as an intravesical prostatic protrusion: a case report
J. Baena-Del Valle*, D.M. Bertel-Rodriguez, M. Plata-Salazar, 
M.A. Palau-Lazaro
*Fundacion Santa Fe De Bogota, Universidad De Los Andes, 
Colombia
Background & objectives: Solitary Fibrous Tumour (SFT) of the 
prostate is rare, with approximately 50 cases reported, 14 confirmed 
after the discovery of the NAD2-STAT6 fusion. We present a case of 
a middle-age-adult with a SFT presenting as an Intravesical Prostatic 
Protrusion (IPP).
Methods: A 42-year-old man with a 5-year history of urinary reten-
tion and suprapubic pain, was diagnosed with a benign prostatic 
hyperplasia, and treated with alpha-blockers. One year later he had 
persistence of the symptoms and an ultrasound revealed an enlarged 
prostate with a lesion protruding into the urinary bladder lumen (17 
mm). A transurethral resection of the prostate was performed.
Results: Microscopic examination showed a mesenchymal neo-
plasm with variably cellular patternless pattern, cells were spin-
dled to ovoid with uniform nuclei, branching staghorn vessels, 
and areas of fibrosis, without necrosis. 7 mitosis per mm2 were 
identified. Neoplastic cells were diffusely positive for STAT6 
and CD34, and Ki-67 rate was 7%. A diagnosis of intermediate-
risk SFT was made. Patient is currently being followed up with 
no evidence of recurrence or metastasis.
Prostate-SFT mean age of presentation is 55 years, and most 
patients present with obstructive urinary symptoms. Presenting 
as an IPP is extremely unusual. Morphologic features are similar 
to extraprostatic SFTs and most of them are positive for STAT6, 
CD34, Bcl-2 and CD99.
Conclusion: Many metastatic risk models have been developed; the 
most widely used, also validated in extra thoracic SFTs, includes 
mitosis, patient age, and tumour size to classify tumours into low, 
intermediate, and high risk. Recurrence and metastasis are rare.

Spontaneous regression of primary renal cell carcinoma: two 
cases
S. Kılar Kösemen*, G. Gümrükçü
*Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 
2% of all new cancer cases in adults. Although spontaneous regression 
in primary RCC and metastases is rare, it is a well-known phenomenon.
Methods: We report two cases of spontaneous regression of RCC 
in an 81-year-old and a 70-year-old male that underwent partial 
nephrectomy for an incidental kidney mass. The entire lesion was 
sampled in both cases, and immunohistochemistry studies were 
performed.
Results: In the first case, a 4.5 cm haemorrhagic and necrotic 
mass separated from the parenchyma by a smooth thick fibrous 
capsule was observed macroscopically. No viable tumour cells were 
observed in H&E sections and immunohistochemistry studies. The 
case was evaluated as RCC showing spontaneous regression. Sub-
type couldn’t be determined.
In the second case, a 2.5 cm, off-white, hard tumoral mass 
surrounded by thin parenchyma was observed macroscopically. 
Tubular structures formed by cells with clear cytoplasm, which 
can hardly be distinguished between hyalinized and calcified areas, 
were seen in H&E sections. Cytoplasmic membranous staining with 
CA-IX was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. The case was 
diagnosed as RCC-clear cell type showing spontaneous regression.
Conclusion: Spontaneous regression was reported in partial or 
complete RCC metastases from time to time. However, spontaneous 
regression of primary RCC is extremely rare. Only 4 cases have 
been reported in the literature. Regressed renal cell carcinomas 
should be considered in the differential diagnosis of solitary renal 
lesions and the entire lesion should be sampled.

Tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma – a malignant entity with 
bland features and good prognosis
G. Fontinha*, R. Almeida, J. Gama, V. Sousa
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitario de Coimbra, Department of 
Pathology, Portugal
Background & objectives: The differential diagnosis for multicystic 
renal neoplasms includes adult cystic nephroma and the recently 
described multilocular cystic renal neoplasm of low malignant potential 
and tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma. The latter is an indolent entity 
with few reported cases.
Methods: In this case report we present the case of an otherwise 
healthy 66-year-old male with an incidental finding of a Bosniak 
IIF-III cystic renal lesion with 2.8 cm. The growing of the mass in 
subsequent imaging studies prompted a partial left nephrectomy in 
this asymptomatic patient.
Results: The gross examination showed a well circumscribed and 
completely excised multilocular cystic lesion with 3x2.6x0.9 cm. 
Histology revealed multiple cysts lined by a single layer of hobnail 
cells with conspicuous nucleoli at 100x magnification and eosino-
philic cytoplasm. No clear cell type of lining, areas of epithelial 
proliferation or intracystic structures were present. In the cyst 
walls there were tubular structures lined by flattened to cuboidal 
cell with no to little atypia. Immunochemical CD10, CK7, CK19, 
AMACR stains were positive in neoplastic cells while CD117, car-
bonic anhydrase IX and oestrogen and progesterone receptors were 
negative. Ki67 stain was positive in 1% of tumour cells. There was 
no colloidal iron staining.
Conclusion: While having good prognosis in most cases the exclu-
sion of non-malignant entities is warranted since recurrence and 
metastasis have been reported. This case underlines the incidental 
diagnostic aspect of this carcinoma which is assonant with its indo-
lent course. Recent studies have showed the tubulocystic renal cell 
carcinoma distinct genomic profile, but more is to be done in order 
to assert the prognosis of pure tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma 
and when in association to other entities.

Basal cell carcinoma of Prostate with MSMB-NCOA4 fusion 
and a probable basal cell carcinoma in-situ: case report
A.C. Loya*, V. Pedersen, K.S. Petersen, O. Østrup, K. Brasso
*Rigshospitalet, Denmark
Background & objectives: Basal cell carcinomas of prostate 
(BCCP) is very rare. Lower urinary tract symptoms, normal PSA 
& rarity of tumour renders diagnosis difficult. This is an attempt 
to describe a non-existent Basal cell carcinoma in situ (BCCIS) 
for first time ever.
Methods: Prostatectomy material from a 74-old man was evaluated 
histologically, immunohistochemically and molecular studies 
(Archer FusionPlex Solid Tumour panel, whole genome sequencing 
& Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Arrays). Needle biopsies of 
abdominal wall metastasis and prostatic needle biopsy performed 
in 2005 were also evaluated.
Results: Histology revealed a diffusely infiltrative tumour with solid 
growth pattern and glandular structures representing BCCIS. Tumour 
cells were positive for P40/P63/CK5/ & Vimentin. PSA/NKX 3,1/CK7/
CK20/GATA3/ & Uroplakin 2 were negative. A diagnosis of BCCP 
was rendered. Additionally, the glandular structures were seen 2-lay-
ered, the adluminal NKX 3,1 & PSA positive single cell layer of normal 
cubical cells and abluminal broader neoplastic cell layer positive for 
basal cell markers (Figures 3 and 4). These glands with prominent 
bilayering, noninfiltrative character, and a stiff basement membrane 
highlights a probable “Basal carcinoma in situ (BCCIS). Molecular 
examination detected MSMB-NCOA4 fusion. Patient had metastasis 
to abdominal wall 8 months later and showed similar features.
Conclusion: BCCP is an aggressive type of prostate cancer challeng-
ing to diagnose based on routine protocols. This results in delayed 
diagnosis & treatment and thus poorer prognosis. Patients with this 
subtype of prostate cancer need appropriately designed, and maybe a 
totally different follow-up regimen independent of PSA, as it’s of no 
use in BCCP patients. Finally, diagnosis of BCCIS, if agreed upon, 
needs to be studied in a larger cohort to justify its existence and its role 
as a precursor lesion.

Review of English literature for the Primary Urothelial Carcinoma 
of the Prostate.
Results: In this case report we present a 62 years old male, diag-
nosed with primary urothelial carcinoma of the prostate. The 
patient was diagnosed with hyperplasia of the prostate before 4 
years. The levels of PSA are normal. Symptoms worsened 6 months 
ago with haematuria, pain, frequent urination. Digital rectal exami-
nation revealed that the prostate is enlarged and hard in the left 
lobe. The transurethral prostatic resection was performed and after 
the histopathologic examination together with immunohistochem-
istry the patient was diagnosed with primary urothelial carcinoma 
of the prostate.
Conclusion: Primary urothelial carcinoma of the prostate is a very 
rare tumour with a poor prognosis. In this way an early diagnosis 
and differential diagnosis is very important and should be taken 
in consideration in cases of worsening symptoms in a patient 
suffering with dysuria and with a firm prostate.

*Pathology Department, Salah Azaiez Institute, Tunis, Tunisia/
Research Laboratory LR21SP01, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Papillary renal cell neoplasm with reverse 
polarity (PRNRP) is a recently described entity of renal tumour with 
unique morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular features. 
The objective is to emphasize on its pathological characteristics.
Methods: We report the case of a 40-year-old woman with an 
indolent renal nodule which was operated on by right partial 
nephrectomy. Gross examination revealed a 2 cm well limited 
tumour.
Results: On microscopy, the tumour show papillary and tubulo-
papillary architecture. Tumour cells were cubic and had predomi-
nantly eosinophilic cytoplasm, round to oval nuclei with stippled to 
clumped chromatin, minimal nuclear pleomorphism, inconspicuous 
nucleoli, and very rare mitosis. Tumour cells showed expression 
of CK7, GATA3 and PAX8. There were no expression of CD10, 
P504S, CK20, TFE3 and FH. Expression of INI1 and SDHB was 
retained. New Generation sequencing showed a KRAS c.35G>T, 
p.Gly12Val mutation. SNParray showed loss of chromosomes 1, 
7, 11, 13, 19 and 20. There were also segmental loss in 2p25-q23, 
3p12-p11, 5q22-q35, 6q, 9p, 10p15-q21, 17q21-q27, 18p-q12 and 
segmental gains in 4p13-q35, 6p25-p21 and 15q11-q15.The final 
diagnosis was PRNRP.
Conclusion: PRNRP is a recently described tumour, by Al-Obaidy 
et al in 2019, defined by a tubulo-papillary architecture, GATA3 
positivity and the presence of KRAS mutations. Approximately, 
100 cases of PRNRP have been reported on the literature and they 
all exhibit an indolent clinical behaviour. Thus, this entity must 
be more recognized by pathologists for a better clinical guidance.

Well differenciated neuroendocrine tumour of the kidney. 
Histological, immunohistochemical, molecular and electron 
microscopy, analysis of a single case in a universitary hospital
M. De Uribe Viloria*, E. García Fernández, P. González-Peramato
*Hospital Universitario La Paz, Spain
Background & objectives: Well differenciated neuroendocrine tumour 
of the kidney (WDNETK) not related to urothelial carcinoma is an 
extremely rare entity with less than 100 reported cases worldwide. It 
occurs in the renal parenchyma and shows neuroendocrine differentia-
tion based on morphology and immunohistochemistry.
Methods: We reviewed our files from 1970 to April 2022 found-
ing a single case of WDNETK. The diagnosis was achieved by 
using Hematoxilin-Eosin, immunohistochemical, molecular 
studies and electron microscopy. From the clinical history we 
obtained the age at diagnosis, symptomatology and radiological 
studies.
Results: A 45 year old female with a renal mass first diagnosed 
in US after an acute renal colic. A radical nephroureterectomy 
with regional lymphadenectomy was performed. The 
tumour showed organoid architecture, diffuse positivity for 
synaptophysin and CD56, focal for chromogranin A. GATA 3, 
TTF1, p63, PAX 8, CK7, CK 20 and cathepsine K were negative. 
The proliferation index (Ki 67) was close to 8% in hotspot areas. 
Necrosis and lymphovascular invasion were identified. TFE3 
and TFB were non rearranged by FISH. Following histological, 
immunohistochemical and molecular analysis the diagnosis of 
well differenciated neuroendocrine tumour of renal parenchyma 
was achieved. Four lymph nodes had metastasis.
Conclusion: WDNETK is an exceptionally rare entity and due 
to its rarity it poses both a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. 
Its main prognostic factors are stage and Ki 67 proliferation 
index and both should be reported. According to WHO 2022 
classification the threshold of 3% of Ki67 separates good from 
poor prognostic although there are no consensus to establish 
grades like in gastrointestinal well differentiated neuroendocrine 
tumours.

Changes of nerve density in prostate cancer
L. Krivošíková*, P. Janega, P. Babál
*Institute of Pathological Anatomy, Comenius University, Bra-
tislava, Slovakia
Background & objectives: Innervation and axonogenesis in prostate 
cancer might be a promising therapeutic target, prognostic marker, and 
replacement for reporting perineural invasion in small samples. We 
aimed to detect changes in nerve density in BPH, prostate cancer, and 
correlation with Gleason score.
Methods: We used patient samples of prostate cancer (n=34), 
BPH (n=18), and autopsy prostate samples without pathological 
changes (n=36). For immunohistochemical detection of 
nerves and nerve proliferation, we used double-staining 
using antibodies against S100 and PCNA. The nerve area was 
measured by histomorphometry with colour deconvolution to 
extract S100 positivity. The proliferation of nerves was analysed 
quantitatively.
Results: There was a significant decrease of nerve density in prostate 
cancer compared to normal prostate and BPH. We also found a non-
significant decline of nerve density with an increasing Gleason score.
There was higher nerve density in BPH than in normal prostate 
tissue, but the difference wasn’t significant.
There were only isolated PCNA-positive cells in nerve fibres, 
mostly in benign hyperplasia. However, because of the sparse 
occurrence of these cells, we didn’t quantify them.
Conclusion: We found a significant decrease of nerve density in 
prostate cancer without proof of axonogenesis. These findings 
are opposite to the results of other authors. However, almost 
all of the works are experimental, whereas there is a minimal 
amount of data about changes of the innervation of human

*Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, School of 
Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Greece
Background & objectives: Male sex differentiation is driven by tes-
tosterone and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) for the regression of 
Mullerian ducts in foetuses. Mutations inactivating AMH or its receptor 
AMHRII lead to rare Persistent Mullerian Duct Syndrome (PMDS) in 
otherwise normally-virilized 46, XY males.
Methods: A 21-year-old man was referred to a urologist for right 
cryptorchidism, an early clinical sign of PMDS. Laparoscopy 
revealed the atrophic testis in the inguinal canal attached to the 
uterus. Excision of the testis and uterus was done. We received tes-
tis (1.5x1.2x1 cm), spermatic cord (3 cm), an attached hypoplastic 
uterus (2.5x1.2x1 cm), and a fallopian tube (4 cm).
Results: Microscopically, the testis was atrophic with marked loss 
of germ cells, and with classical seminomatous germ cell tumour 
measured 1.3 cm. Cut sections of the uterus and fallopian tube 
showed the classical histology of these organs.
Conclusion: Though rare, every surgeon operating upon inguinal her-
nia or undescended testes, or cryptorchidism needs to know about the 
presence of the uterus in a phenotypic male patient at any age. A high 
degree of suspicion and awareness is needed to diagnose this condition. 
Patients with PMDS are at higher risk of testicular malignancy than 
patients with isolated undescended testis. Early treatment is needed to 
maintain fertility and prevent the occurrence of malignancy in the testis 
or in remnant Mullerian structures.

Collecting duct carcinoma, a great mimicker - a case report of 
a rare neoplasia and literature review
M. de Brito Pereira*, A. Alves, E. Vitorino, A. Canastra, A. Beltran
*Pathology Department, Hospital CUF Descobertas, Lisbon, 
Portugal
Background & objectives: Collecting duct carcinoma is a high-grade 
renal neoplasia, presumably arising from the Bellini ducts. It accounts 
for less than 1% of renal malignancies, yet the clinicopathological over-
lap with other high-grade malignancies makes the incidence of this 
lesion difficult to ascertain.
Methods: We report the case of a 69-year-old male without previ-
ous history of neoplastic lesions that presented in our institution 
with a history of gross haematuria. At admission, an imagologi-
cal evaluation was performed that revealed a cystic lesion with 
an internal solid component in continuity with the cystic wall. 
This lesion was classified as Bosniak IV. A tumorectomy was then 
performed.
Results: The superior pole of the kidney was occupied by a cystic 
lesion with a smooth surface. In section, a solitary white papillary 
projection was identified in the interior component of the cyst. 
The projection had continuity from the parenchyma to the adipose 
tissue.
Histologically, the lesion was adjacent to the renal medulla 
with a solid and tubo-papilary architecture and an desmoplastic 
infiltrating component. Composed of cuboidal cells, with 
eosinophilic cytoplasm and large nuclei with prominent nucleoli. 
Sarcomatoid differentiation was also present. The cells expressed 
diffuse positivity for PAX-8 (strong) and GATA3 (weak); negativity 
for p63, CK5, CK7, CA IX, CD117 e CD10. The diagnosis of 
collecting duct carcinoma was made.
Conclusion: Other clinicopathological overlapping entities, such 
as fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma, papillary 
renal cell carcinoma, mucinous tubular spindle cell carcinoma 
with high-grade transformation, high-grade unclassified renal cell 
carcinoma and metastatic carcinoma, must be considered in the 
differential diagnosis and excluded. At the time of this report, the 
patient presents no signs of disease progression.

Divergent infiltrating high grade urothelial carcinoma with 
small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma differentiation
A. Sykaras, S. Stefanakis, C. Kouvidou*
*Department of Pathology, Evangelismos General Hospital, Ath-
ens, Greece
Background & objectives: Approximately 25-30% of urothelial car-
cinomas (UC) show divergent differentiation that includes urothelial 
and non-urothelial (squamous, glandular or neuroendocrine) histologi-
cal variants. The vast majority of bladder neuroendocrine carcinomas 
(NECs) are usually admixed with a non-neuroendocrine component, 
mostly infiltrating UC.
Methods: A 60-year-old man presented with painless gross haema-
turia and CT and cystoscopy revealed an exophytic mass localized 
at the dome of the bladder. A transurethral resection of bladder 
tumour (TURBT) was performed and the surgical specimen was 
entirely submitted for microscopic examination in the pathology 
lab.
Results: Histological examination revealed a high-grade muscle-
invading UC with tumour cells arranged in nests and sheets. Inter-
estingly, four neoplastic foci had distinct morphological features 
and the typical appearance of small cell neuroendocrine carci-
noma (SmCC). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the 
SmCC component had a proliferation marker Ki-67 labelling index 
above 90% and expressed CD56 and CD117 but was negative for 
other neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin, synaptophysin and 
INSM1) and for TTF1 and LCA. On the contrary, the UC compo-
nent displayed focal and weak expression of CD117 and was CD56 
negative. Moreover, both the SmCC and UC components showed 
aberrant expression (strong and diffuse) of p53, overexpression of 
p16 and loss of RB1.
Conclusion: Although the presence of SmCC mixed with other bladder 
neoplasm should always be reported, it is controversial if the diagnosis 
should reflect the percentage of the SmCC component. We avoided the 
term “mixed SmCC-UC”, following the definition of mixed neuroendo-
crine-non neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs). Instead, the term “UC 
with SmCC differentiation” was used to highlight the focal distribu-
tion of the neuroendocrine component. The expression profile of p53 
and RB1 classifies this tumour in the neuroendocrine-like molecular 
subtype of muscle-infiltrative bladder cancer.

*Pathology Department, Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is 
the second most common type of renal carcinoma(RC), representing 
approximately 18.5% of RC. Metastatic PRCC involving temporal bone 
is extremely rare.
We aim to analyse the clinico-pathological features of inhabituel 
metastatic sites of PRCC.
Methods: We present a case of PRCC revealed by a temporal bone 
metastasis whose clinical and radiological appearances were mis-
leading in a 34 year old woman, without pathological past history. 
This case was diagnosed in our institution in 2022.
Results: Patient was referred to neurosurgery department for a 
rapidly evolving mass of the fronto-temporal region. The magnetic 
resonance imaging concluted to an osteosarcoma. Thus, patient 
underwent neurosurgery which revealed an haemorrhagic tumour 
appearing to be of muscular origin.
Grossly, specimen consisted of a whitish fribale lesion measuring 
4cm.
Histologically, the tumour was composed of papillae formed by 
delicate fibrovascular cores, lined by a single layer of tumour 
cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and enlarged hyper-
chromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Tumour cells expressed 
CD10, P504-S and focally CK7, TTF1 ans CK20 were negative 
evocating renal metastasis. Abdominal-ultrasound was performed 
showing a renal mass. Therefore, patient was referred to urologic 
department.
Conclusion: Lung metastasis and bone metastasis are the most 
most metastatic sites of PRCC. Metastatic PRCC involving the 
fronto-temporal bone is a rare condition and misdiagnosis is not 
uncommon. Clinical history information of the metastasis, morpho-
logical characteristics and combined immunohistochemistry are the 
key to identify the renaal origin of a metastatic PRCC.

Unusual presentation of ureteriris cystica associated with 
malignancy

Ruiz, A.P. Martínez Aracil, A.I. Ruiz de Angulo Otxaran, V. 
Moreno Nieto, M.A. Viguri Diaz, M.J. De Diego Rivas
*Araba University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: Ureteritis cystica is a rare urological dis-
ease and is usually seen as incidental finding. Its aetiology is not clearly 
known, but it is associated with chronic urothelial irritation caused by 
nephrolithiasis and urinary tract infections.
Methods: We present the case of 86-year-old who complained of 
haematuria. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a right-sided 
renal mass with extension into the renal vein and inferior vena 
cava. Nephroureterectomy and thrombectomy was performed. 
On the gross examination, two different lesions was observed: a 
multycistic-yellow polypoid mass protruding into the ureter lumen, 
and a solid tumour mass in the kidney.
Results: Postoperative histopathological examination revealed 
clear cell renal carcinoma, G1 according to WHO/ISUP (sized 11,5 
cm). The renal vein thrombus was composed of the same carcinoma 
cell and the perirenal fat and margin of the ureter were negative 
(pT3N0M0). Microscopic lymphovascular invasion was observed 
near the right renal hilum.
The ureteral lesion was composed of multiple dilated urothelial cysts, 
known as van Brunn nests, embedded below their mucosal lining, and 
filled with macrophages and eosinophilic and amorphous material 
content. The final diagnosis was polyoid ureteritis cystica (sized: 1,4 
cm).
Conclusion: Ureteritis cystica is a benign and indolent lesion char-
acterized by the formation of single or multiple cysts in the ureteral 
lumen. It is usually associated with inflammation/infectious dis-
eases. Although, in this case, it was is shown as a polypoid mass 
associated with a renal carcinoma.

Encrusted cystitis and pyelitis: study of 2 cases
S. Moussa*, O. Belkacem, A. Loghmari, W. Majdoub, S. Mestiri, 
M. Ben Othmane, S. Hmissa
*Pathology department, Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Encrusted urinary tract infections (EI) 
are an uncommon disorders characterized by the calcification of the 
urothelial wall. EI is usually due to Corynebacterium-urealyticum, a 
Gram-positive-bacillus, which has a major urease activity.
We aim to analyse clinico-pathological aspects of the EI.
Methods: Two cases of encrusted cystitis and pyelitis of 2 males 
aged 57 and 62 years old, respectively, without pathological past 
history, were diagnosed between 2014 and 2020 in our institution. 
The patients were referred to the urology department for a 
management of urosepsis.
Results: Physical examination showed systemic manifestation includ-
ing fever and pelvic pain. Urologic symptoms consisted of dysuria in 
two patients and macroscopic haematuria in one patient. Blood analysis 
showed a neutrophilic leukocytosis. Urinalysis revealed alkaline urine 
with pyuria and haematuria. CT-scan showed in all cases a calcified 
thickening of the urothelial wall and moderate bilateral and unilateral 
hydronephrosis, respectively. Thus, the diagnosis of urosepsis caused 
by perforated urinary EI was suspected. Bacterial culture results were 
positive to Corynebacterium-urealyticum in all cases. Adjusted antibio-
therapy was undertaken in all cases. Histological examination showed 
chronic cystitis comprising calcic deposits. The evolution was fatal 
in one patient due to septic shock and uneventful in another patient.
Conclusion: Encrusted cystitis and pyelitis is a rare entity 
characterized by a poor prognosis in case of delayed diagnosis 
and inappropriate treatment. Bladder perforation and urosepsis 
are a serious complications that can be fatal as described in 
our case.

Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate presenting as penile 
metastasis
J. Boavida*, T. André Sousa Oliveira, L. Correia
*Department of Pathology - Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN; 
Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal
Background & objectives: In spite of its rich vascularization, 
penile metastasis are extremely rare and are commonly from 
the prostate and bladder. Herein we present a case of ductal 
adenocarcinoma of the prostate presenting as a penile metastasis 
in a 83-year old patient.
Methods: A 83-year old patient with a history of chronic ure-
thral catheterization post-urethroplasty and a diagnosis of pros-
tate acinar adenocarcinoma(2019), for which he received com-
bined hormonal-radiation therapy, presented with an exofitic 
lesion of the glans (13 mm) and general stiffness of the penis. 
After imagiologic evaluation documenting the presence of 
S360

1 3
nodular lesions in the penile shaft, the patient underwent radi-
cal penectomy.
Results: Macroscopically, the entirety of the corpora caver-
nosa were occupied by a tumour that infiltrated the glans but 
spared the urethra. Histologic examination showed it was com-
posed of large and complex glands lined by tall pseudostrati-
fied columnar cells; moderate nuclear atypia with proeminent 
nucleoli was seen. Immunohistochemistry studies showed posi-
tivity for NKX3 and negativity for cytokeratins 7 and 20, PSA 
and GATA3. Given the clinical history and these histologic 
findings, a diagnosis of metastatic ductal adenocarcinoma of 
the prostate was made.
Conclusion: The prostate is the most common site of origin 
of secondary tumours of the penis, presenting ductal features 
in most cases. Our patient had a previous biopsy diagnosis 
of acinar adenocarcinoma, which showed foci of intraductal 
carcinoma; however, he was not submitted to radical 
prostatectomy hence we are not aware of the extent of the 
morphological spectrum that composes the primary tumour. 
Nevertheless, immunohistochemical analysis is essential 
in these cases to rule out urethral urothelial carcinomas, a 
histological pitfall.

Lobular breast carcinoma metastasis to the urinary bladder 
mimicking plasmacytoid variant of urothelial carcinoma
A.M. Gonçalves Pereira*, F. Galante Pereira, C. Padrão, J. Tinoco, 
R. Veiga
*Hospital Professor Doutor Fernando, Portugal
Background & objectives: Very few cases of breast cancer metastasis 
to the bladder are reported in the literature. With 13 recognized 
variants, urothelial carcinoma can be easily mimicked by metastasis, 
so a high level of suspicion is needed to avoid pitfalls.
Methods: A 67-year-old woman with history of mixed lobular and 
ductal breast carcinoma, in 2006, with multiples relapses over the 
years, presented to our institution with haematuria. Diagnostic 
exams showed, right uretero-hydronephrosis. Cystectomy showed 
a bladder lesion which was resected.
Results: Multiple fragments of tissue were analysed, which 
revealed, upon histologic examination, a diffuse infiltration of the 
submucosa and detrusor muscle of cords, solid sheets, and singly 
dispersed neoplastic cells, with eccentric hyperchromatic nuclei 
and dense eosinophilic cytoplasm, sometimes univacuolated. No 
evidence of urothelial carcinoma-in-situ was found. Immunohis-
tochemistry showed positivity for pan-cytokeratin’s AE1/AE3 and 
CAM5.2, while p40 was negative. GATA-3 was also positive. With 
the known history of breast cancer, oestrogen and progesterone 
receptors were performed, which were diffusely positive, thus 
proving the breast origin of the lesion. Bloodborne metastasis to 
the bladder are exceedingly rare and breast cancer represents a 
small minority of those.
Conclusion: This case encompasses an insidious metastasis 
pattern of lobular breast carcinoma and how it can overlap 
morphologically and immunohistochemically (GATA3+) with 
the plasmacytoid variant of urothelial carcinoma. This case-
report shows that a high level of suspicion and a careful clini-
cal investigation are essential to avoid misdiagnosis and adds 
to the few cases reported of breast cancer metastasis to the 
bladder. The patient recovered from her urinary symptoms but 
died from advanced metastatic breast cancer one month after 
this diagnosis.

Golebiewski, A. Durawa, E. Izycka-Swieszewska*
*Medical University of Gdansk, Copernicus Hospital, Gdansk, 
Poland
Background & objectives: The aim of this study was histopathologi-
cal evaluation of renal dysplasia and other changes in heminephrectomy 
specimens from the children with malformations or urodynamic disor-
ders, in context of clinical and modern radiological imaging (Hydro-
MRI, Urography MRI).
Methods: The material: 24 heminephrectomy cases (16 girls, 8 
boys; age 8 months -18 years), operated due to renal duplication, 
vesicoureteral reflux, ectopic ureter, hydronephrosis or afunctional 
renal pole. Multiple sections stained H-E and Masson trichrome 
were examined for the presence and degree of dysplasia, severity 
of inflammation, fibrosis, areas of cartilage, arteriolosclerosis, and 
dysmorphic vessels. Uro-MRI own scale analysis.
Results: Pathologically the presence of renal dysplasia was 
observed in 20 out of 24 cases, while radiological changes- in 17 
cases. In four cases dysplasia was classified as segmental and in 
the remaining 16 as focal. The percentage of area covered by dys-
plasia varied from 2 to 100%. Small multiple cysts were found in 8 
cases. All cases with renal dysplasia showed chronic pyelonephritis 
with lymphoid follicle formation. The degree of renal parenchymal 
fibrosis varied from minimal to severe. Areas of increased fibrosis 
were usually accompanied by intense chronic inflammation, more 
advanced arteriolosclerosis, and glomerular sclerosis. Cartilage 
foci were identified in three cases.
Conclusion: Renal dysplasia is a quite common finding in the 
paediatric chronic kidney disease connected to the urinary tract 
malformations such as vesicoureteral reflux, ureteral atresia, or 
duplication of the kidney. The percentage of renal parenchyma 
affected by dysplasia may be low, especially in kidneys with 
hydronephrosis, where renal dysplasia can be undetectable 
radiologically.

A. Baccouche*, S. Moussa, W. Majdoub, S. Mestiri, S. Ben Cheikh, 
A. Bdioui, O. Belkacem, S. Hmissa
*Pathology Department, Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Primary prostatic leiomysarcoma is an 
extremely rare malignancy that accounts for only 0.1% of all primary 
prostatic neoplasms. Clinical presentation is not specific mimicking 
other prostatic disorders.
We aim to analyse the clinical and pathological aspects of this 
rare entity.
Methods: We present a case of primary prostatic leiomyosarcoma 
in a 64 year old man, without pathological past history. This case 
was diagnosed in our institution in 2019.
Results: Patient presented at the urology consultation with lower 
urinary tract symptoms related to bladder obstruction. He reported 
no haematuria or perineal pain. Serum prostate-specific-antigen 
level was normal.
The diagnosis of benign prostatic hypertrophy was suspected and 
patient underwent prostatic transurethral resection.
Histological examination showed a large necrotic sarcomatous proliferation 
composed of spindle-shaped cells, with elongated plump nuclei, nuclear

pleomorphism and brisk bizarre multipolar mitotic activity. Some areas 
revealed an epithelioid morpholgy. The tumour infiltrates massively
the prostatic gland.
Immunohistochemistery showed positive staining for vimentine and 
smooth muscle actine. Tumour cells were negative for Cytokeratin 
and CD34.Subsequently, the diagnosis of high grade leiomyosar-
coma was made. Meanwhile, the patient had died.
Conclusion: Primary prostatic leiomyosarcoma is a rare aggres-
sive neoplasm with misleading clinical features which may delay 
the diagnosis. Generally, the overall prognosis is poor. There are 
no guidelines concerning the therapeutic approach since primary 
prostatic sarcomas are extremely uncommon.

Fumarate hydratase deficient renal cell carcinoma – a case of 
hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma - associated 
renal cell carcinoma?
D. Sá*, F. Costa, F.S. Vieira, J.R. Vizcaíno
*Centro Hospitalar Universitário do Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell 
carcinoma (HLRCC) is an inheritable autosomal dominant syndrome 
caused by germline mutations in the fumarate hydratase (FH) gene and 
is characterized by the development of cutaneous and uterine leiomyo-
mas and renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
Methods: We report a case of a 56-year-old man with a renal 
lesion measuring 10 cm associated with lymph node metastasis and 
peritoneal carcinomatosis, found incidentally on a CT scan in 2014. 
After 5 years of chemotherapy, a pancreatic lesion measuring 5 cm 
was also found on a follow-up CT scan. The patient was submitted 
to a total nephrectomy and splenopancreatectomy.
Results: We received a total nephrectomy specimen with a solid 
capsulated neoplasia on the upper pole of the kidney measuring 
4,5 cm with a white and firm cut surface that invaded the ipsilat-
eral adrenal gland. The splenopancreatectomy specimen showed a 
similar appearing neoplasia involving the pancreas, peripancreatic 
fat and lymph nodes. At histologic examination the neoplasia pre-
sented papillary, tubular, and solid architecture, cells with clari-
fied or eosinophilic cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli (grade 3 WHO/
ISUP) and perinucleolar halo. Immunohistochemistry revealed 
multifocal positivity for CAIX, AMACR, CK34βE12, CD10 and 
Vimentin in the neoplastic cells with negativity for CK7 and TFE3. 
There was loss of expression of Fumarate Hydratase.
Conclusion: Our patient had no history of cutaneous leiomyomas. 
As the germline mutation status is often unknown at the time of 
diagnosis, and not all cases are syndromic, the term FH-deficient 
RCC is preferred over HLRCC-associated RCC. FH-deficient RCCs 
demonstrate a variety of architectural patterns and therefore a low 
threshold for immunohistochemistry is recommended in difficult cases. 
The estimated lifetime renal cancer risk for FH mutation carriers is 
estimated to be 15-30%. Our patient is alive 9 months after the surgery.

A recently described entity: biphasic squamoid alveolar papil-
lary renal cell carcinoma
D. Sá*, J.R. Vizcaíno, F.S. Vieira
*Centro Hospitalar Universitário do Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Biphasic squamoid alveolar papillary renal 
cell carcinoma (BSA-PRCC) was first described in 2012 by Petersson 
et al. who reported two cases of tumours with a distinctly dual-cell 
population composed of alveolated islands of large squamoid cells sur-
rounded by smaller cells.
Methods: We herein report a case of a 61-year-old woman who 
was submitted to a renal ultrasound due to a six-month history 
of sustained weight loss. The ultrasound and subsequent CT scan 
revealed a renal mass in the lower pole of the kidney measuring 1,5 
cm. To remove this lesion, a partial nephrectomy was performed.
Results: We received a partial nephrectomy specimen almost 
totally occupied by a tumour measuring 1,8 cm with a solid and 
yellow-tan cut surface. Histologic examination showed a distinctly 
dual cell population, one of relatively uniform, small neoplastic 
cells with clarified cytoplasm and round low-grade nuclei form-
ing alveolar-like structures. The other, separated from the former 
by a slit space, composed of solid nests of larger squamoid cells 
with eosinophilic voluminous cytoplasm and large nuclei with 
prominent nucleoli (grade 2 WHO/ISUP). Immunohistochemistry 
revealed expression of CK7, AMACR, EMA, CK34βE12, CD10 
(focal) and Vimentin (focal) in the neoplastic cell with negativity 
for CAIX. Cyclin D1 highlighted the squamoid cell islands.
Conclusion: Biphasic squamoid alveolar papillary renal cell 
carcinoma has been mainly described as a morphological 
variant of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Its incidence has been 
estimated at less than 1% of papillary RCC. MET alterations 
and chromosome 7 trisomy have been recently reported in, 
respectively, 60% and 87,5% of BSA-PRCCs linking it to type 
1 papillary RCC. Metastases occur in 9,4% of the cases but 
fortunately our patient is currently free of disease 13 months 
after the surgery.

An unexpected presentation of renal cell carcinoma as a 
renal hilar lymph node metastasis without radiologically or 
macroscopically evident renal mass
E. Gedik*, E. Dicle Serbes, İ. Adanır, C. Cansız Ersoz, E. Süer, 
G. Kaygusuz, D. Enneli
*Ankara University Medical School Pathology Department, 
Turkey
Background & objectives: It’s extremely rare for renal cell 
carcinoma(RCC) to be diagnosed from metastasis without evidence 
of radiologically/macroscopically renal mass. The present case was 
diagnosed from lymph node metastasis, as there wasn’t any renal mass. 
It was striking with many other features.
Methods: A 73-year-old woman was admitted to the hospi-
tal with abdominal pain. CT, PET/CT scans revealed a well-
demarcated mass between the left kidney hilum and aorta (SUV-
max=30.6), with a radiological appearance of lymphadenopathy. 
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy from the mass revealed a poorly 
differentiated, malignant epithelioid tumour with a preliminary 
diagnosis of sarcoma, due to epithelial-marker negativity. Patient 
underwent left radical nephrectomy.
Results: Macroscopically, a solid hilar mass, 9,5cm in long diam-
eter, unrelated to the renal parenchyma/pelvicalyceal system was 
detected. No renal mass was noticed. Microscopically, tumour cells 
effacing the lymph node parenchyma were arranged in solid and 
alveolar pattern. They were polygonal with vesicular nuclei, promi-
nent eosinophilic nucleoli, abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, some 
with rhabdoid differentiation. Extensive necrosis was noted. Immu-
nohistochemically, Pancytokeratin, EMA, PAX-8,Vimentin,RCCag, 
CD10, were positive, suggesting that the tumour was RCC metas-
tasis. Based on these immunohistochemical findings, renal paren-
chyma was totally resampled, two distinct microscopic RCC foci 
(Low grade clear RCC-4mm, Chromophobe RCC-2mm) were 
S362

barely noticed in the renal cortex. Comparative NGS analysis of 
both metastatic and primary foci were planned.
Conclusion: Present case was interesting in different aspects. 
Unusual presentation posed a diagnostic pitfall. Despite of the 
metastatic foci forming a large mass with aggressive histologi-
cal features, primary tumour foci were innocent, with milimetric, 
hardly detected nodules, low-grade histological features. Another 
striking feature was that these millimetric renal nodules showed 
different RCC types. We shared this case to raise awareness about 
this very rare presentation of RCC and to emphasize the importance 
of extensive sampling of the renal parenchyma when required.

Metastasis of renal clear cell carcinoma to contralateral ure-
ter twenty years later after radical nephrectomy: a challenging 
diagnosis
Y. Fejji*, W. Majdoub, A. Baccouche, M. Krifa, S. Mestiri, O. 
Belkacem, A. Bdioui, S. Hmissa
*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, 
Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Metachronous metastasis of renal cell car-
cinoma (RCC) to the contralateral ureter is extremely rare. We report 
a rare case of RCC metastasized to the contralateral ureter twenty 
years later and highlight the clinicopathological features of this rare 
presentation.
Methods: A 58-year-old man with a history of a right radical 
nephrectomy for clear RCC 20 years ago and lost to follow-up 
presented an obstructive renal failure.
Results: MRI shows a left tumour of the upper ureter. The patient 
underwent a radical left nephroureterectomy. On gross examina-
tion, the upper ureter contained a white nodule extending over 1 
cm with foci of haemorrhagic changes. The microscopic exami-
nation shows compact nests and sheets of cells with clear cyto-
plasm and distinct membrane growing beneath the urothelium 
and limited to the muscular propria of the ureter consistent with 
a metastasis of a clear RCC. Immunohistochemistry confirmed 
the diagnosis of contralateral metastasis of clear cell renal car-
cinoma grade 2 of the ISUP grading system. Tumour cells were 
positive for CD10, EMA, and vimentin and negative for AMACR 
and CK7.
Conclusion: Although clear RCC can metastasize to any location 
within the body, involvement of the contralateral ureter is very 
rare. This unusual diagnosis should be considered in any patient 
after treatment for RCC. Clear cell RCC has a worse prognosis 
than papillary or chromophobe RCCs, when matched for stage, 
and is more likely to present at an advanced stage or with existing 
metastases

Primary small cell carcinoma of the kidney: a rare case 
report
S. Mabrouk*, T. Tlili, S. Yacoub, A. Ben Abdelkader, B. Sriha, 
M. Mokni
*Department of pathology, Farhat Hached university hospital, 
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Small cell carcinoma (SCC) is most com-
monly seen in the lung, but rare cases of extrapulmonary sites have 
also been reported. Primary SCC of the kidney is an extremely rare 
neoplasm representing < 1% of renal neoplasms.
Methods: A 27-year-old women without any previous disease, 
presented with a history of right lumbar abdominal pain for 2 
months. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed 
an ill-defined, large heterogeneous tumour in the upper pole of the 
left kidney, measuring 14,7cm and infiltrating the perirenal tissue. 
The patient underwent a left radical nephrectomy.
Results: Gross pathological examination of the surgical specimen 
showed a large mass measuring 10 cm. Cut sections were brownish 
with necrotic areas. The renal capsule was intact. On Histologic 
examination, the tumour was composed predominantly of nested 
growth pattern with ribbons associated with extensive necrosis 
areas. These nests are surrounded by delicate connective tracts in 
a neuroendocrine-like pattern. The tumour cells were small with 
indistinct cell borders, scant cytoplasm, hyperchromatic nuclei with 
fine granular chromatin, and high mitotic activity.
Immunohistochemical stains revealed that the tumour cells were 
strongly positive for CD56. The ki67 index was 60%. The tumour 
was staged as pT2a.
Conclusion: SCC of the kidney is a high neuroendocrine neoplasm 
with aggressive behaviour and a tendency to develop early nodal 
and disseminated metastatic disease. It is an extremely rare neo-
plasm, fewer than 60 cases have been reported in the literature.
The diagnosis of a SCC is histologic and immunohistochemical. 
SCC is mainly misdiagnosed as other small round cell tumours. 
However, it is much more important always to rule out the exist-
ence of a primary lung tumour metastatic to the kidney.

The Prevalence of CHEK 1 and CHEK 2 mutations in prostate 
cancer in Jordan population: a retrospective cohort study

*King Abdullah University Hospital, Jordan University of Science 
and Technology, Jordan
Background & objectives: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most 
common types of male cancers. This study aimed to investigate the 
occurrence of variations in mammalian checkpoint kinase 1/2 (CHEK1/
CHEK2) genes as key signal transducers inside the genomic integrity 
checkpoints in PCa.
Methods: FFPE-PCa specimens of radical prostatectomies from 74 
Jordanian patients were subjected to DNA extraction, polymerase 
chain reactions and Sanger sequencing to screen the mutations in 
selected exons of CHEK1 and CHEK2 tumour suppressor genes.
Results: The mean age of the study population was 72 years. 
The mean of the PSA was 60 ug/L. The analysis of the CHEK1 
and CHEK2 genes showed the presence of two point mutations 
in CHEK1 and CHEK2 genes (2/74, 2.8%). Specifically, F281L 
(T/C) (1.4%) homologous missense point mutation in the CHEK2 
gene and c.564A>AT (188 P>P/P) (1.4%) silent mutation in exon 6 
(kinase domain) of CHEK1 gene. However, the 1100delC mutation 
was not detected in the studied PCa samples.
Conclusion: We found, and in line with previous studies, lack of 
association between CHEK1 mutations and PCa development. The 
presence of 1.4% of mutation in CHEK2 in our results supported 
the possible role of genetic variants in this gene and the develop-
ment of PCa. Further studies are needed with larger cohorts to shed 
more light on these findings and to reveal the genetic predisposi-
tion of the CHEK2 gene in the development of PCa in Jordan and 
perform screening of more exons.

Automation meets reliability: use of OncomineTM Precision 
Assay on the GenexusTM System for accurate identification of 
cancer biomarkers in FFPE and liquid biopsy samples

Background & objectives: We report the use of the ­OncomineTM Pre-
cision Assay (OPA) with the ­GenexusTM System which provides a fast, 
accurate and comprehensive genetic profile across 50 key genes using 
DNA and RNA from FFPE tissues or liquid biopsy samples.
Methods: Contrived and clinical research samples with known var-
iants were used for the OPA FFPE and liquid biopsy workflows (n 
= 30). NA quantification was completed using the ­GenexusTM puri-
fication instrument’s ­QubitTM feature after purification. Extracted 
NA was transferred to the ­GenexusTM sequencer for library prepa-
ration, sequencing, variant and QC reporting using the onboard Ion 
Torrent™ analysis software.
Results: The OPA assay only required 10ng of DNA and RNA from 
FFPE samples and 20ng of cfTNA from liquid biopsy samples. 
­GenexusTM purification instrument onboard quantitation data 
showed successful extraction of NA exceeding the required yields 
for library preparation. Excess NA was automatically aliquoted 
into an archive plate and stored for future use. Sequencing results 
for four samples of FFPE or liquid biopsy were reported within 24 
hours. Both Control and clinical research samples showed expected 
assay metrics including read coverage, molecular coverage, and 
uniformity. The results reported all expected variants at correct 
allele frequencies, including BRAF V600E, KRAS G12C, PIK3CA 
N345K, and AKT1 E17K.
Conclusion: The ­GenexusTM system provides a user-friendly 
workflow with automated NA purification, quantitation, sample 
dilution, library preparation, sequencing, and data analysis with 
minimal hands-on time that can be performed with limited exper-
tise to obtain results within 24 hours. Reliable identification of 
variants from control and clinical research samples of FFPE and 
liquid biopsy origin with optimal assay metrics demonstrates the 
successful use of the OPA assay and ­GenexusTM system that can 
be confidently used in clinical oncology research.

RAS/BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer : assessment of its 
status in a north African population compared to European 
population

hezala, L. Chaabane, R. Ben Ghorbel, A. Ben Amara, K. Mrad
*Salah Azaiz Institute of Cancer, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Kras/Nras/Braf mutation screening is rec-
ommended in metastatic colorectal cancer for personalized medicine 
therapy. Since epidemiology of colorectal cancer in north African pop-
ulation is different from European population, we aimed to compare 
mutational status in the two populations.
Methods: Ras/Braf screening was achieved using the Idylla tech-
nologies on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections. Spot-
ting areas with the greatest amount of tumoral cells was performed 
on HE slides. A threshold of 10% tumoral cells was required. Then, 
1 x 5 μm tissue section was prepared from the corresponding par-
affin block.
Results: We tested Ras and Braf mutations in a series of 250 colo-
rectal patients with or without metastasis.
Our results showed 58% of Ras (Kras and Nras) mutations and 
3% of Braf V600 mutations. 56% of mutations were present in 
metastatic colorectal patients and 44% in non metastatic colorectal 
patients. Moreover it seems that we could not predict the type of 
mutation according to any histologic classification.
Conclusion: Ras/Braf mutation frequency in our population 
approaches occidental series.

Infantil de México Federico Gómez (HIMFG), Mexico
Background & objectives: Together, group 3 and group 4 medul-
loblastomas represent up to 70% of paediatric cases; however, their 
distinction can be challenging. The objective of the study is to evaluate 
five genes reported as potentially discriminated amongst both groups.
Methods: Seventy-five patients diagnosed with medulloblastoma 
and treated at Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez were 
included. Molecular classification was assessed by Polymerase 
Chain Reaction, based on 22 gene panel proposed by Northcott 
et al 2012, plus ANO2, DISC1, ARHGAP18, GMR8, PRDM6. 
The expression of the novel genes was evaluated between the four 
groups and compared with four cerebellar control samples.
Results: Using the 22 subgroup signature genes, samples were 
classified as 8/75 wingless, 27/75 sonic hedgehog, 22/75 group 3, 
and 18/75 group 4 medulloblastomas.
Thereafter, when compared between the four subgroups, mean 
fold change values for ANO2 were 4.00, 1.20, 8.46 and 10.18; for 
DISC1 were 17.36, 15.22, 12.28 and 19.72; for ARHGAP18 were 
2.52, 4.28, 14.71 and 8.59; for GRM8 were 152.9, 814.7, 230.6 
and 1381.9; and, for PRDM6 were 16.21, 11.57, 19.26, and 27.40, 
for wingless, sonic hedgehog, group 3, and group 4, respectively.
Consequently, the overexpression of ANO2, DISC1, GRM8 and 
PRDM6 were consistent with group 4, while overexpression of 
ARHGAP18 with group 3 subgroup assignment.
Conclusion: This study confirms differential expression of the 
five genes analysed between the four main molecular subgroups 
of medulloblastoma, furthermore, help to differentiate amongst 
groups 3 and 4.
Outputs provide continued support for group 3 and group 4 dis-
tinction. Next step is to validate the set of genes by methylation or 
with an independent validation cohort of medulloblastomas. Sup-
plementary studies may also provide insights to facilitate groups 3 
and 4 subtypification using the evaluated genes.
