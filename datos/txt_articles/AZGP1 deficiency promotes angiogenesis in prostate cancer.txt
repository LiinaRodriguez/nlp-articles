Abstract 
Background  Loss of AZGP1 expression is a biomarker associated with progression to castration resistance, develop‑
ment of metastasis, and poor disease-specific survival in prostate cancer. However, high expression of AZGP1 cells 
in prostate cancer has been reported to increase proliferation and invasion. The exact role of AZGP1 in prostate cancer 
progression remains elusive.
Method  AZGP1 knockout and overexpressing prostate cancer cells were generated using a lentiviral system. The 
effects of AZGP1 under- or over-expression in prostate cancer cells were evaluated by in vitro cell proliferation, migra‑
tion, and invasion assays. Heterozygous ­AZGP1± mice were obtained from European Mouse Mutant Archive (EMMA), 
and prostate tissues from homozygous knockout male mice were collected at 2, 6 and 10 months for histological 
analysis. In vivo xenografts generated from AZGP1 under- or over-expressing prostate cancer cells were used to deter‑
mine the role of AZGP1 in prostate cancer tumor growth, and subsequent proteomics analysis was conducted to elu‑
cidate the mechanisms of AZGP1 action in prostate cancer progression. AZGP1 expression and microvessel density 
were measured in human prostate cancer samples on a tissue microarray of 215 independent patient samples.
Result  Neither the knockout nor overexpression of AZGP1 exhibited significant effects on prostate cancer cell prolif‑
eration, clonal growth, migration, or invasion in vitro. The prostates of ­AZGP1−/− mice initially appeared to have grossly 
normal morphology; however, we observed fibrosis in the periglandular stroma and higher blood vessel density 
in the mouse prostate by 6 months. In PC3 and DU145 mouse xenografts, over-expression of AZGP1 did not affect 
tumor growth. Instead, these tumors displayed decreased microvessel density compared to xenografts derived 
from PC3 and DU145 control cells, suggesting that AZGP1 functions to inhibit angiogenesis in prostate cancer. Pro‑
teomics profiling further indicated that, compared to control xenografts, AZGP1 overexpressing PC3 xenografts are 
enriched with angiogenesis pathway proteins, including YWHAZ, EPHA2, SERPINE1, and PDCD6, MMP9, GPX1, HSPB1, 
COL18A1, RNH1, and ANXA1. In vitro functional studies show that AZGP1 inhibits human umbilical vein endothe‑
lial cell proliferation, migration, tubular formation and branching. Additionally, tumor microarray analysis shows 
that AZGP1 expression is negatively correlated with blood vessel density in human prostate cancer tissues.

Conclusion  AZGP1 is a negative regulator of angiogenesis, such that loss of AZGP1 promotes angiogenesis in pros‑
tate cancer. AZGP1 likely exerts heterotypical effects on cells in the tumor microenvironment, such as stromal 
and endothelial cells. This study sheds light on the anti-angiogenic characteristics of AZGP1 in the prostate and pro‑
vides a rationale to target AZGP1 to inhibit prostate cancer progression.

Background
The large discrepancy in prostate cancer (PCa) incident 
rates, estimated at 288,300 in 2023 in the U.S., and death 
rates, estimated to be 34700, demonstrates the need for 
prognostic biomarkers to select patients for observation 
or aggressive treatment [1]. In 2004, our group dem-
onstrated that loss of expression of zinc-alpha-2-gly-
coprotein (AZGP1) was a candidate biomarker of PCa 
aggressiveness [2]. Since that time, several large-scale 
studies have validated that loss of expression of AZGP1 
in PCa is a strong predictor of poor outcomes (including 
recurrence, metastasis, progression to castrate resistance, 
and PCaspecific death), as well as providing predictive 
value independent of clinical and pathological parame-
ters (such as tumor grade, stage, and pre-operative serum 
prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels) [3–12]. AZGP1 
is part of a commercial assay that has been used clini-
cally to predict PCa outcomes in several clinical settings, 
most commonly in selection of patients for active sur-
veillance [13]. In addition, AZGP1 loss has been found 
to be a predictor of poor outcomes in several malignan-
cies including gastric cancer [14], esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma [15], liver cancer [16], and bladder cancer 
[17].
While many prognostic biomarkers play roles in cancer 
progression, such as by driving proliferation or metasta-
sis, the role of AZGP1 in cancer aggressiveness remains 
unclear for PCa. In liver cancer, AZGP1 has been found 
to inhibit the TGF-β1-ERK2 pathway, PTEN/Akt path-
way, the CD44 signaling pathway [18, 19], and epithe-
lial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). thereby blocking 
lung metastasis [18]. However, in gastric cancer, over-
expression of AZGP1 has been reported to accelerate 
apoptosis and inhibit growth through modulation of the 
mTOR/PTEN signaling pathway [20]. In PCa, a single 
study has reported that AZGP1 can affect proliferation 
and invasion of PCa cells [21]. Strikingly, over-expression 
of AZGP1 in PCa cells increased aggressive behavior, 
contradicting the many clinical studies demonstrating 
that loss of protein and RNA expression of AZGP1 are 
associated with cancer progression and mortality [3, 
8, 10]. Given the limited investigations into the mecha-
nisms through which AZGP1 affects cancer behavior, 
its role remains poorly defined. To better understand 
whether AZGP1 plays a direct role in PCa progression, 
we investigated the effects of modulating expression of 
AZGP1 in vitro and in vivo.
Materials and methods
Cell culture
The human PCa cell lines PC3, DU145, LNCaP, C42B,, 
22Rv1 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
(HUEVEC) were obtained from American Type Cul-
ture Collection (Manassas, VA). PC3, LNCaP, C42B, 
and 22Rv1 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium 
(Invitrogen Inc., CA, USA) supplemented with 10% 
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U/ml penicillin/strep-
tomycin. DU145 were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified 
Eagle medium (Invitrogen Inc.) containing 10% FBS 
and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. HUVEC cells 
were grown in human large vessel endothelial cell basal 
medium (catalog no. M200500, Thermofisher Scientific) 
with low serum growth supplement (catalog no. S00310, 
ThermoFisher Scientific). The human LuCaP147 patient 
derived xenograft (PDX) was generously provided by Dr. 
Eva Corey [22]. Human LuCaP147 spheroids were main-
tained in ­StemPro® hESC SFM (Invitrogen Inc.) medium 
supplemented with 10 nM of R1881 and 2 μM of Y-27632 
as previously described [23]. All cells were maintained in 
a humidified 5% ­CO2 incubator at 37 °C and periodically 
monitored for mycoplasma contamination by polymer-
ase chain reaction (PCR) PCR. LuCaP147 spheroids pas-
saged less than 15 times and PCa cell lines with passages 
fewer than 20 were used in this study.
Plasmids, antibodies, chemicals
The control sgRNA (catalog no. K010) and sgAZGP1 
plasmids (sgAZGP1-T1: AGC​CAA​GGG​CCT​GAA​ACG​
CG and sgAZGP1-T2: GAC​AGG​AAG​TCT​CAG​CCC​
AT, catalog no. 12907111) were obtained from Applied 
Biological Materials USA Inc. (Ferndale, WA, USA). The 
control GFP (catalog no. LVCV-0) and AZPG1 cDNA 
(catalog no. HG13242-ACGLN) were procured from 
Sino Biologicals US Inc. (Houston, TX, USA). An anti-
AZGP1 antibody was purchased from OriGene (Rock-
ville, MD, USA). Anti-Ki67 (catalog no. 12202) and 
secondary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling 
(Danvers, MA, USA). Anti-CD31 (catalog no. ab182981) 
was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Polybrene

and puromycin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. 
Louis, MO, USA).
Lentiviral production
The sgAZGP1 and AZGP1 cDNA plasmids were ampli-
fied using a E.Z.N.A.® Plasmid DNA Maxi Kit (Omega 
Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, USA) following manufacturer’s 
instructions, and used to transfect 293 T cells using third 
generation lentiviral system with MDL, VSV, and Rev 
as described previously[24]. The medium was changed 
after 12 h and cells were maintained for additional 48 h. 
The supernatant was collected by centrifugation, filtered 
using a 0.45 µm membrane, and precipitated with PEG-
it™ Virus Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, 
Palo Alto, CA, USA). The lentiviruses were collected and 
used to transfect the PCa cells.
Generation of AZGP1 knockout and overexpressing cells
AZGP1 knockout cells were generated by sgAZGP1 len-
tiviral transduction. Specifically, LNCaP cells were trans-
duced with sgAZGP1 lentiviral particles for 72 h and cells 
were washed with PBS (3X) followed by puromycin selec-
tion for 5 days. The LuCaP147 cells were transduced in a 
similar manner except that no puromycin selection was 
performed due to its extreme toxicity to the spheroids. 
Similarly, PC3, DU145, LNCaP, and LuCaP147 cells were 
transduced with AZGP1 cDNA lentiviral particles to 
obtain AZGP1 overexpressing cells.
Reverse‑transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR) 
and real‑time quantitative RT‑PCR (RT‑qPCR)
The total RNA was isolated using a RNeasy Mini kit (Qia-
gen, Redwood City, CA, USA) according to manufac-
turer’s instructions. The complementary DNA (cDNA) 
was obtained using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse 
Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, 
MA, USA). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using a 
standard protocol from the SYBR Green PCR Kit (Ther-
moFisher Scientific) using the StepOnePlus Real-Time 
PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA). The 
primers used were: AZGP1, forward 5′- AAC​GAC​AGT​
AAC​GGG​TCT​CAC-3′; AZGP1, reverse 5′-TTG​GTT​
ATC​TGG​GCT​GCT​GG-3′; β-actin, forward 5′-GAT​
CAT​TGC​TCC​TCC​TGA​GC-3′; β-actin, reverse 5′-CGT​
CAT​ACT​CCT​GCT​TGC​TG-3′.
Proliferation assays
LuCaP147 control vector and LuCaP147 AZGP1-OV, 
LuCaP147 control sgRNA, LuCaP147 sg-AZGP1-T1 and 
LuCaP147 sg-AZGP1-T2 spheroids were dissociated 
into small clusters using Accutase (Cat# AT104, Inno-
vative Cell Technologies, San Diego, CA, USA). Cells 
(2 × ­104 cells/well) were transferred into 96-well plates 
and cultured in the medium for 9 days. Cell growth was 
measured with CellTiter-Glo® 3D Cell Viability Assay 
(catalog no. G96821, Madison, WI, USA) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions as a readout for LuCaP147 
spheroid proliferation.
LNCaP control vector and LNCaP AZGP1-OV, 22Rv1 
control vector and 22Rv1 AZGP1-OV, LNCaP control 
sgRNA, LNCaP sg-AZGP1-T1 and LNCaP sg-AZGP1-T2 
(1500 cells/well) were plated in 12-well plates and cul-
tured in triplicate as described above. Cells were trypsi-
nized and counted manually on days 2, 4, and 7.
HUVEC cells were cultured (800 cells/well) in 96-well 
plates and treated with or without AZGP1 protein (1, 
10  µg/mL, Catalog no. 13242-H08H, Sino Biological) 
in the medium for 7  days. Cell growth was measured 
with ­CyQUANT™ LDH Cytotoxicity Assay (catalog no. 
C20300, Thermofisher Scientific) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions.
Colony formation assay
LNCaP control vector and LNCaP AZGP1-OV, LNCaP 
control sgRNA, LNCaP sg-AZGP1-T1 and LNCaP sg-
AZGP1-T2, 22Rv1 control and 22Rv1 AZGP1-OV (4000 
cells/well) were plated into 6-well plates and cultured for 
11  days, with media exchanges every three days. Colo-
nies were washed with PBS (2X) and fixed with 4% (w/v) 
paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The 
fixed colonies were stained with 0.05% (w/v) crystal violet 
for 10 min and then washed with PBS (5X). The relative 
colony numbers were counted using Image J.
Cell migration detection by wound‑healing assay
PC3 control vector, PC3 AZGP1-OV, DU145 control 
vector and DU145 AZGP1-OV (2 × ­106 cells/well) were 
plated in 6-well plates. The next day, when cells at the 
bottom of the plate were close to 100% confluency, the 
plates were scratched with a 200 µL pipette tip. Pictures 
of the scratched areas were taken on day 0 and day 1 to 
measure the width of the wounded gaps. The degree of 
wound closure for each replicate, expressed as a percent-
age, was determined using Image J.
Transwell migration assay
PC3 control vector and AZGP1-OV cells (1 × ­105 cells), 
HUEVEC (1 × ­105 cells) were seeded in serum-free media 
onto 24-well transwell inserts (Transwell™ Permeable 
Polyester Membrane Inserts with 8 µm-pore size mem-
brane) (Corning, Corning, NY, USA). HUVEC cells were 
treated with or without AZGP1 protein (10 µg/ml). All 
the cells were incubated for 24  h. The remaining cells 
on top of the membrane were removed from the tran-
swell insert using cotton-tipped applicator. The transwell 
inserts together with cells that had migrated through

the membrane to the bottom of the inserts, and cells 
that had migrated to the bottom of the wells were then 
fixed with 4% PFA and stained with 0.01% crystal violet, 
followed by thorough washing with PBS and air drying 
for 10–15 min. The cells that had migrated through the 
membrane and into the bottom of the wells were imaged 
and counted by Image J.
Transwell invasion assay
BD Matrigel™ (30 µl, San Jose, CA, USA) was added to a 
24-well transwell insert (8 µm-pore size membrane) and 
solidified in a 37 °C incubator for 30 min to form a thin 
layer on top of the transwell membrane. PC3 control vec-
tor and AZGP1-OV (2 × ­105 cells) were seeded in serum-
free media on top of the transwell insert and incubated 
for 24 h. Cells that had migrated into the Matrigel layer 
were fixed in  situ and stained with 0.01% crystal vio-
let solution. The stained cells were imaged and counted 
manually.
In vitro angiogenesis assay
Matrigel (50  µL, Corning) was added to 96-well plate 
plates and incubated at 37 ºC for 1 h to form a gel layer. 
HUVEC cells in media (1.5 × ­104 cells) were added to 
the surface of the Matrigel layer. The cells were treated 
with AZGP1 protein (10  ug/ml) or media control and 
incubated at 37 ºC for 24 h. The cells were stained using 
calcein AM (C3099, ThermFisher Scientfic) and imaged 
microscopically.
PCa xenograft studies
NSG (NOD/LtSz-SCID IL-2Rγnull) mice were obtained 
from the Jackson Laboratory and were housed at the 
Veterinary Service Center of Stanford University. The 
use of animals in the study adhered to the guidelines 
and regulations established by the Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Stanford Univer-
sity. PC3 control vector, PC3 AZPG1-OV, DU145 con-
trol and DU145 AZGP1-OV (1 × ­106 cells), 22Rv1 control 
and 22Rv1 AZGP1-OV (2 × ­106 cells) were suspended in 
50% Matrigel (100 µL) and were injected subcutaneously 
into the dorsal flank of 10–12 week-old NOD.Cg-Prkdc 
scid Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJ (NSG) mice (The Jackson Labora-
tory, Sacramento, CA, USA). The tumor size was meas-
ured every 3–4 days using a Vernier caliper, and tumor 
volume was calculated as V = 1/2 × L × ­W2. At the end of 
experiment, mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were 
collected. Half of the tissues were formalin-fixed and 
paraffin-embedded and the other half snap frozen for 
proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry.
Western blots
PC3 control vector and AZGP1-OV cells, DU145 
control vector and DU145 AZGP1-OV cells, LNCaP 
control vector and LNCaP AZGP1-OV, LNCaP con-
trol sgRNA, LNCaP sg-AZGP1-T1 and LNCaP sg-
AZGP1-T2, LuCaP147 control vector and LuCaP147 
AZGP1-OV, LuCaP147 control sgRNA, LuCaP147 sg-
AZGP1-T1 and LuCaP147 sg-AZGP1-T2 cells were 
lysed in RIPA lysis buffer containing 1X protease and 
phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific). PC3 
control tumors and AZGP1-OV tumors were minced to 
small pieces and then dissolved in RIPA buffer contain-
ing 1X protease and phosphatase inhibitors with probe 
sonicator (Fisher Scientific). Protein concentration was 
measured by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
Protein samples in 1X Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-rad, 
Hercules, CA, USA) were heat-denatured at 95 °C for 
10 min. The protein lysates were loaded and separated 
by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose mem-
brane, and blotted with primary antibodies including 
anti-β actin (a00702, 1:1000 dilution, Genescript, Pis-
cataway, New Jersey, USA), anti-AZGP1 (TA8121185, 
1:1000 dilution, OriGene Technologies, Inc., MD, 
USA), and anti-AR (ab133273, 1:1000 dilution, Abcam, 
Boston, MA, USA) and secondary anti-mouse IgG con-
jugated to HRP (7076, 1:5000 dilution, Cell Signaling 
Technology, Inc, Danvers, MA, USA) or anti-rabbit IgG 
HRP conjugated antibodies (7074, 1:5000 dilution, Cell 
Signaling Technology, Inc, Danvers, MA, USA). West-
ern blot development and detection were performed 
using ­ECL™ Western Blotting Substrate (GERPN2106, 
Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA).

mouse 
(EM:02573, 
B6.129P2-Azgp1tm1.1Sbah/Orl)[25] 
was 
obtained from European Mouse Mutant Archive 
(EMMA). Heterozygous AZGP1 knockout female mice 
were obtained by breeding the heterozygous AZGP1 
knockout male mouse with wild type female C57BL/6 
mice. Homozygous AZGP1 knockout mice were 
obtained by cross-breeding male and female heterozy-
gous AZGP1 knockout mice, and the offspring were 
genotyped as described above. All mice used here were 
of C57BL/6 background. The genotypes of the offspring 
were determined by PCR using the Kapa Mouse Geno-
typing kit (Cliniscience, Nanterre, France) with AZGP1 
primers (AZGP1-forward 5′- ACT​CTG​TGC​CAG​GCT​

Hematoxylin and Eosin staining
The tissue sections underwent a sequential immer-
sion process in a series of solvents: Clearify (SKU #: 
CACLELT, Statlab LLC, Texas TX) for 5 min (2X), 100% 
ethanol, 95% ethanol and 75% ethanol for 2 min each 
(2X). The sections were stained with Harris hematoxy-
lin for 5 min, followed by 5–6 quick dips in acid alcohol 
(0.3%) and Scott’s Tap Solution for 3 min, Eosin solu-
tion for 30 s. Dehydration was performed by immersing 
the sections in 95% alcohol, 100% alcohol, and xylene 
for 2 min each (2X). Finally, the sections were air dried 
and mounted with a coverslip.
Immunohistochemistry staining
The tissue sections were baked at 60 °C for 60 min and 
sequentially immersed in clearify, 100% ethanol, 95% 
ethanol, and 70% ethanol (5 min). For antigen retrieval, 
the tissue sections were boiled in 0.01  M citrate buffer 
(pH 6.0) for 20 min, and slides were blocked in 5% goat 
serum and 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h. After that, the sec-
tions were incubated with a primary antibody AZGP1 
(TA8121185, 1:100 dilution, OriGene Technologies, Inc., 
MD, USA), CD31(1:100, ab182981, Abcam, Boston, MA, 
USA) in PBS containing 0.5% BSA overnight at 4 °C. The 
following day, the sections were washed with TBST(3X) 
and treated with 0.3% ­H2O2 in distilled water to block 
endogenous peroxidase activity. Subsequently, a second-
ary antibody was applied in PBS containing 0.05% BSA. 
DAB solution (catalog No. SK-4100, Vector Laborato-
ries) was used to develop the tissue slides. The slides were 
stained with Hematoxylin for 5 min, followed by immer-
sion in ­NaHCO3 solution for 3 min. The slides were then 
immersed in 75%, 95%, and 100% ethanol, and xylene, for 
5 min each (2X).
Immunofluorescence staining
All the steps were performed in the same manner as 
immunohistochemical staining up to primary antibody 
(anti-CD31, 1:200, catalog no. 77699S, Cell Signaling Inc) 
incubation at the end of day 1. The following day, the slides 
were washed with TBST (3X) and then incubated with sec-
ondary antibodies (catalog no. ab150077, Abcam) diluted 
with 1 × PBS containing 0.05% BSA (1:400) for 1 h at room 
temperature. The slides were washed with TBST (3X) and 
mounted with mounting medium with DAPI (catalog no. 
ab104139) and sealed with clear nail polish for image.
Sirius red staining
The tissue sections were baked at 60 °C for 60 min and 
hydrated by sequential immersion in clearify, 100% 
ethanol, 95% ethanol, and 70% ethanol for 2 times (5 min 
each). Slides were stained with Hematoxylin for 1 min, 
and immersed in ­NaHCO3 solution (50 mM) for 3 min. 
After washing for 10 min in running tap water, the slides 
were stained with picro-sirius red (catalog no. ab246832, 
Abcam) for one hour, and washed twice with acidified 
water (0.5% acetic acid). The slides were dehydrated in 
100% ethanol (5  min, 3X) and xylene (5  min, 2X) and 
were mounted and imaged.
Proteomic analysis
Proteins were extracted from control-GFP and AZPG1-
OV PC3 tumors by adding 800  µl of lysis buffer con-
taining 1.5% SDS buffer with protease inhibitor and 
homogenized using a probe sonicator (Fisher Scien-
tific). The supernatant was collected after centrifuged 
at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C and proteins were evalu-
ated by BCA protein assay according to manufacturer’s 
instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The protein was 
reduced using Tris(2carboxyethyl) phosphine (10  mM, 
TCEP, 
Sigma-Aldrich), 
alkylated 
iodoacetamide 
(15  mM, Acros Organics), and digested with trypsin 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The resulting tryptic pep-
tides were reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid (Fisher 
Scientific), and loaded into a C18 trap column (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) for LC/MS analysis on an Orbitrap 
Trybrid Eclipse mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific). The flow rate was 0.6  µl/min. Eluted peptides 
were ionized with a Nanospray Flex Ion Source (1.8 kV, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap 
Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The 
flow rate is 5  µL/min. 0.1% formic acid in water was 
used as mobile phase A and 0.1% formic acid in ace-
tonitrile was used as mobile phase B. The column was 
heated to 65 °C by a column heater (PST Phoenix S&T). 
The gradient program was set to 2% mobile phase B for 
the first 6 min, gradually increased to 35% mobile phase 
B over the next 80 min, then increased to 85% mobile 
phase B over 5 min with a 5 min hold at a constant flow 
rate of 0.3 µL/min.
Proteomics data analysis
For every LC–MS run, the raw data file obtained was 
subjected to two searches using Byonic 2.11.0 (Protein 
Metrics, San Carlos, CA). The first search was per-
formed against a Swiss-Prot database containing the 
reference human proteome (2022; 20,645 entries), while 
the second search was conducted against a Swiss-Prot 
database containing the reference mouse proteome 
(2022; 17,380 entries). The search parameters for the 
database included trypsin digestion with a maximum 
of two missed cleavages, a precursor mass tolerance 
of 0.5  Da, and a fragment mass tolerance of 10  ppm.

Additionally, fixed cysteine carbamidomethylation was 
specified, along with variable modifications such as 
methionine oxidation and asparagine deamination. To 
ensure high confidence in the peptide identifications, 
peptides with a false discovery rate (FDR) exceeding 
1% were filtered out. Furthermore, peptides identified 
in both the human and mouse database searches were 
eliminated, enabling a conservative analysis of human-
identified proteins with non-homologous mouse pep-
tides. This analysis was performed using an in-house R 
script, considering three biological replicates per cell 
line (control-GFP and AZGP1-OV PC3) and three tech-
nical replicates for each experimental condition. Protein 
levels were determined by examining the signals specific 
to each protein within the samples. To determine the 
relative abundance of proteins, these signals were com-
pared to the average signal observed across all samples. 
This enabled the evaluation of each protein’s abundance 
relative to the overall protein levels in the experimental 
dataset. To ensure comparability and facilitate statisti-
cal analysis, a normalization procedure was applied. The 
relative abundance values were adjusted to a normal 
distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation 
of 1. Finally, statistical analysis involved the application 
of the Student’s T-test for comparing pairs and Pear-
son’s correlation test for comparing the cell lines. For 
further analysis, only proteins demonstrating a signifi-
cance level below 0.01 were included in the subsequent 
analyses.
To assess the fold change and significance of proteins, 
we employed uncorrected t-test comparing control GFP 
PC3 cells (N = 9 biological replicates) with AZGP1-OV 
PC3 tumors (N = 9). For statistical analysis, we con-
ducted a multiple hypothesis correction separately for 
all data (gray) and exclusively for genes associated with 
angiogenesis (GO:0001525). To perform this correction, 
we utilized the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure with 
a false-discovery rate of 10% (FDR = 0.1) as described 
previously [26]. Heatmaps were generated by cluster-
ing genes hierarchically/agglomeratively using the ’aver-
age’ method and ’euclidean’ metric. For the enrichment 
analysis of genes involved in angiogenesis in control 
GFP and AZGP1-OV PC3 tumors, we employed a null 
hypothesis assuming that these genes were randomly 
selected from the distribution of proteins confidently 
measured in mass spectrometry. Out of the 2803 pro-
teins with sufficient signal-to-noise for quantification, 
94 were identified as angiogenesis-related, while 1282 
exhibited significant differences in protein expression 
(above the Benjamini–Hochberg multiple hypothesis 
cutoff). To model the count distribution, we employed 
a hypergeometric distribution (N = 2803, n = 1282, 
K = 94).
Transcriptomic data analysis
All transcriptome data were obtained from cBioPortal 
for Cancer Genomics (https://​www.​cbiop​ortal.​org/). The 
mRNA levels of AZGP1 in PCa and patient data were 
collected from the MSKCC Prostate Cancer Genomics 
Data Portal (http://​cbio.​mskcc.​org/​prost​ate-​portal/) for 
the MSKCC-PRAD dataset [27] and the Genomic Data 
Commons Data Portal (https://​portal.​gdc.​cancer.​gov) for 
the TCGA-PRAD dataset. The associations of AZGP1 
with disease-free survival and Gleason scores were deter-
mined by Python.
We identified transcripts correlated with AZGP1 gene 
expression using the bulk RNAseq data from the TCGA 
PRAD dataset. To measure correlations, we employed 
Kendall’s tau coefficient, a non-parametric rank cor-
relation test that is sensitive to non-linear relationships 
[28]. We assessed significance and controlled for false 
discoveries by shuffling AZGP1 expression values across 
samples and recalculating Kendall’s tau across the entire 
dataset. We determined significance for both positive 
and negative correlations separately. All analysis is per-
formed in Python 3.7.4 with the modules numpy (1.18.1), 
scipy (1.4.1), and pandas (1.2.3). Kendall’s tau was calcu-
lated with method set to ’kendall’ in pandas.DataFrame.

from GO:0001525. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment 
analysis and WikiPathways analysis was performed using

Patient
The study was performed with guidelines provided by 
Institutional Review Board at Stanford University (IRB: 
11612). All patients (n = 215) underwent prostate cancer 
surgery in1985-1997. Patient’s with postoperative mortal-
ity < 30  days, follow-up of < 3  years without recurrence, 
simultaneous with other types of cancers were excluded 
from the study.
Tumor tissue microarray staining and analysis
To determine the relationship between AZGP1 expres-
sion and microvessel density in human prostate cancers, 
we used a tissue microarray comprised of 215 patient 
samples from radical prostatectomies performed in men 
with clinically localized prostate cancer. The microar-
rays include up to four cores (0.6mm) from each case. 
The TMAs were stained for multiplexed immunofluo-
rescence (MxIF) imaging as previously described[30]. 
Briefly, multiplexed immunofluorescence was performed 
using a Cell DIVE imager (Leica Microsystems, Issaquah, 
WA) using a 20 × 0.75 NA objective. AZGP1 expression 
was captured by measuring quantitative fluorescence in 
the cancer epithelial cell compartment that had been seg-
mented by methods described previously[31, 32]. Blood

vessels were automatically segmented based on a combi-
nation of immunofluorescent staining for CD31, CD34 
and collagen IV, using a previously published deep learn-
ing framework[30]. Subsequently, the microvessel density 
was calculated as the number of segmented microvessels 
per core. Microvessel density was correlated with AZGP1 
protein expression by averaging log2 transformed inten-
sity in epithelial cells in each core. Correlation was meas-
ured using Pearson correlation on a continuous scale, 
and we also divided cores into two groups using median 
microvessel density, then compared AZGP1 intensity 
between the two groups (low/high) using the Wilcoxon 
test.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of the experimental data was per-
formed 
using 
GraphPad 
Prism 
software 
(Stata-
Corp., College Station, TX). All data are presented as 
mean ± standard error of the mean (S.E.M). For compari-
sons between two groups, an unpaired Student’s t-test 
was used. When comparing more than two groups, a 
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the 
Tukey’s test for post hoc analysis was applied to deter-
mine significant differences. ns: non-significant p > 0.05, 
*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.
Results
AZGP1 does not affect cell proliferation in PCa in vitro.
Loss of AZGP1 protein and RNA expression has been 
associated with adverse outcomes in PCa in multiple 
datasets. To investigate the functional role of AZGP1, 
we determined the expression levels of AZGP1 in vari-
ous PCa cell lines. Consistent with previous findings [21], 
both transcript and protein levels of AZGP1 were much 
higher in androgen receptor (AR)-positive cell lines 
(LNCaP, C42B and 22Rv1), compared to the AR-nega-
tive cell lines DU145 and PC3, determined by qPCR and 
western blot, respectively (Fig. 1A, B).
Knockout of AZGP1 in LNCaP cells did not change 
proliferation rates compared to wild-type LNCaP cells 
that expressed AZGP1 (Fig. 1C), suggesting AZGP1 is not 
required for LNCaP proliferation in vitro. The absence of 
expression of AZGP1 protein in the knockout cells was 
demonstrated by western blot (Fig.  1D). Interestingly, 
overexpression of AZGP1 in LNCaP cells also did not 
alter their rate of proliferation (Fig. 1E, F). Moreover, col-
ony formation assays using LNCaP cells, LNCaP AZGP1-
knockout or LNCaP cell overexpressing AZGP1 showed 
that changes in AZGP1 level did not affect LNCaP colony 
formation r growth (Fig. 1G–J). Similarly, overexpression 
of AZGP1 did not affect 22Rv1 cell proliferation and col-
ony formation ability (Additional file 1: Fig S1A–D).
Patient Derived Xenografts (PDXs) have demonstrated 
the ability to faithfully replicate the histological and 
molecular characteristics of the original tumors, includ-
ing responses to standard-of-care therapies [33]. The 
LuCaP147 PDX serves as an authentic model of human 
PCa subtype with an SPOP mutation and a hypermuta-
tor phenotype [22, 23]. We evaluated the effect of AZGP1 
on cell proliferation in LuCaP147 spheroids derived from 
a PDX tumor. LuCaP147 cells express moderate levels of 
AZGP1, and we therefore generated AZGP1 knockdown 
and over-expressing LuCaP147 cell lines and confirmed 
AZGP1 expression levels by qPCR and western blot 
(Fig.  1K, L). There was no significant impact of knock-
out or overexpression of AZGP1 on the proliferation 
of LuCaP147 cells (Fig.  1K–N). Therefore, in contrast 
to previous reports [21], we found that AZGP1 had no 
cell autonomous effects on PCa cell proliferation. These 
results suggest that the negative association of AZGP1 
with survival is mediated by mechanisms other than inhi-
bition of PCa proliferation.
AZGP1 does not affect PCa cell migration and invasion in 
vitro.
We tested the role of AZGP1 in PCa cell migration and 
invasion using PC3 and DU145 cell lines since they are 
highly invasive and migratory. Wound-healing assays 
demonstrated that overexpression of AZGP1 did not 
alter cell migration in either PC3 (Fig. 2A–C) or DU145 
cells (Fig. 2D–F). Likewise, transwell migration and inva-
sion assays showed that overexpression of AZGP1 had no 
significant effect on PC3 migration (Fig. 2G, H) and inva-
sion (Fig. 2I, J). Therefore, we observed no cell-autono-
mous effects of AZGP1 expression on cell migration or 
invasion in PCa cells, as had been reported previously 
[21].
AZGP1−/− mice show heterogeneous changes in 
mesenchymal composition
Although AZGP1 loss is associated with adverse clini-
cal outcomes, unexpectedly, we did not observe a direct 
effect of AZGP1 on the proliferation, clonal growth, 
migration, or invasion of PCa cell lines. Therefore, we 
used a mouse model to examine the role of AZGP1 in 
the prostate in  vivo, where the microenvironment is 
intact. ­AZGP1−/− mice were bred and genotyped using 
a targeting construct that specifically deleted the α1 and 
α2 domains of AZGP1 (Fig. 3A) [25] which produces a 
modified non-functional 550 kDa allele, compared to the 
wild-type allele of 450 kDa (Fig. 3B).
Since AZGP1 has never been assessed in nor-
mal prostate biology, we first examined the histol-
ogy of prostates from ­AZGP1−/− mice. Prostates from 
Page 8 of 19

male mice were harvested at 2 months, 6 months and 
10 months of age. Though there was a mild phenotype 
in 2 month-old prostates, significantly increased blood 
vessel density was observed in the mesenchyme of the 
prostates from 6 month-old to 10 month-old ­AZGP1−/− 
mice (Fig. 3C). This phenotype was present in the prox-
imal and distal regions of several lobes, though it was 
enriched in the proximal and periurethral region of 
the lobes. There were no significant differences in the 
epithelial anatomy of the dorsal and lateral prostate 
lobes between wild-type and ­AZGP1−/− mice. How-
ever, increased fibrosis and collagen deposition could 
be observed, which was most apparent proximally and 
near the base of the seminal vesicles. Similar to the 
endothelial phenotype, this was seen in the prostates 
of 6-month-old and 10-month-old ­AZGP1−/− mice, as 
confirmed by Sirius red staining (Fig. 3D).
AZGP1 inhibits angiogenesis in PCa xenografts
While in  vitro experiments suggested no effects of 
AZGP1 on cancer cell growth, AZGP1 knockout mice 
showed changes in the prostate stroma, and we tested 
whether altering expression of AZGP1 would affect PCa 
growth in vivo. Control PC3 and AZGP1-OV PC3 cells 
were implanted into the dorsal flank of 10–12 week-old 
NSG mice and propagated for 41  days. Similar to our

observations in vitro, we found no change in tumor size, 
weight or volume in AZGP1-OV PC3 group compared 
to controls (Fig.  4A–C). However, we noticed that the 
PC3-AZGP1-OV tumors were much more pallid com-
pared to the PC3 control tumors. We quantified the 
degree of redness in the PC3 control tumors compared 
to the PC3-AZGP1-OV tumors and confirmed that there 
was a significantly greater red-hued pixels in the low-
AZGP1-expressing controls compared to the AZGP1 
over-expressing xenografts (Fig.  4D). We reasoned that 
this difference was due to an increased number of small 
vessels per area, referred to as microvessel density, in the 
tumors. Immunohistochemistry confirmed increased 
expression of AZGP1 in the PC3-AZGP1-OV compared 
to controls (Fig. 4F). Interestingly, tumors expressing high 
levels of AZGP1 showed significantly lower microves-
sel density compared to the low-AZGP1 expressing 
controls, quantified by IHC using CD31 antibody and 
manual counting of vessels in 40X microscopy fields 
(Fig. 4E, F). These findings were also validated in xeno-
grafts of DU145 tumors that natively express low levels 
of AZGP1 and DU145 cells overexpressing AZGP1. Once 
again, over-expression of AZGP1 did not affect tumor 
size, volume or weight, but did decrease tumor redness

and microvessel density compared to controls, albeit to 
a slightly lesser degree compared to PC3 cells (Fig. 4G–
L). Similarly, over-expression of AZGP1 did not affect 
tumor growth for AR-positive 22Rv1 cells (Additional 
file  1: Fig. S1E, F). We did not observe any changes in 
tumor growth in AZGP-OV 22Rv1 tumors compared to 
control 22Rv1 tumors. AZGP1 did not affect microvessel 
denisty in 22Rv1 tumors (Additional file 1: Figure S1G-
H), although 22Rv1 cells express high levels of AZGP1 at 
baseline. Together these results suggest that AZGP1 does 
not affect growth in vivo; however, loss of AZGP1 expres-
sion appears to promote increased microvessel density 
and tumor vascularization.
AZGP1 regulates expression of proteins involved 
in angiogenesis in PCa xenografts
We performed mass spectrometry-based proteomic anal-
ysis using tumor tissues from the control and AZGP1-OV 
PC3 groups. The volcano plot in Fig.  5A demonstrated 
high expression of AZGP1 protein in the PC3-AZGP1-
OV cells, as expected, as well as proteins significantly 
upregulated and down-regulated in response to AZGP1 
overexpression. We cross-referenced the differentially 
expressed proteins in control PC3 and PC3-AZGP1-OV 
tumors and found significant overlap of proteins asso-
ciated with the angiogenesis pathway (GO:0001525) 
(Fig. 5A and B, p = 0.014 by hypergeometric distribution). 
Hierarchical clustering of tumors using the proteins iden-
tified in the angiogenesis pathway demonstrated clear 
segregation of AZGP1 overexpressing tumors from con-
trols for both up- and down-regulated proteins (Fig. 5C). 
Of the differentially expressed genes, 29 genes related 
to angiogenesis were downregulated and 25 genes were 
upregulated in the AZGP1-OV tumors compared to the 
PC3 control group tumors (Additional file  1: Table  1). 
Among the top differentially expressed angiogenesis-
related proteins, MMP9, GPX1, HSPB1, COL18A1, 
RNH1, and ANXA1 showed negative correlation with 
AZGP1 overexpression (Fig. 5D, and Additional file 1: Fig 
S2A–E), while SERPINE1, YWHAZ, EphA2, and PDCD6 
exhibited positive correlation with AZGP1 overexpres-
sion (Fig. 5E, F, and Additional file 1: Fig S2F–G). Down-
regulation of MMP-9 and upregulation of PDCD6 and 
EphA2 in AZGP-OV tumors were confirmed by West-
ern blot (Fig. 5G). Proteomic analysis of DU145 showed 
similar trends of these angiogenesis-related proteins, 
although several were not stastically significant likely 
due to the subtler differences in microvessel density in 
DU145 (Additional file 1: Fig S3). These results suggest 
that AZGP1 inhibits angiogenesis in PCa through regu-
lating known angiogenesis associated proteins.
AZGP1 inhibits HUVEC proliferation, migration and tube 
formation
To test directly the effects of AZGP1 on angiogenesis, we 
performed several angiogenesis assays using HUVECs 
in  vitro. After 7  days, AZGP1 inhibited the HUVEC 
growth, albeit to a small, but significant, degree (Fig. 6A). 
AZGP1 treatment effectively suppressed HUVEC tube 
formation ability and node formation, as depicted in 
Fig.  6B, C. A Transwell migration assay showed com-
parable numbers of cells migrating to the bottom of the 
transwells for AZGP1-treated and untreated HUVECs. 
However, the AZGP1-treated group showed significantly 
fewer cells migrated to the bottom of the wells compared 
to the non-treated control HUVECs (Fig. 6D–G). These 
results suggest that AZGP1 inhibits proliferation, migra-
tion, and tube and node formation of HUVECs.
AZGP1 expression is associated with an angiogenesis 
in human PCa tissues
To further investigate the relationship of AZGP1 expres-
sion with angiogenesis, we interrogated existing PCa 
transcriptome databases. We first confirmed that 
AZGP1 levels in localized prostate cancers were associ-
ated with clinical outcome and Gleason score. In both 
TCGA-PRAD and MSKCC-PRAD, we divided samples 
at the median AZGP1 expression level into high and low 
expression cancers and found that low AZGP1 expres-
sion was significantly associated with poor disease-free 
survival outcomes (Fig. 7A, B), Additionally, low AZGP1 
expression was associated with higher Gleason scores in 
both datasets (Fig. 7C, D).
With the knowledge that the transcript levels per-
formed as expected in TCGA PRAD dataset, we then 
identified genes significantly associated with AZGP1

expression levels by correlation analysis with Kendall’s 
tau. We performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment 
analysis to test whether AZGP1 expression in TCGA-
PRAD is correlated with angiogenesis-associated tran-
scripts in human PCa. By comparing transcript levels in 
the GO angiogenesis pathway with AZGP1-associated 
transcripts, we identified 74 common transcripts that 
were present in both gene lists (Fig. 7A). The GO term 
analysis of the biological function of these 74 genes 
revealed enrichment in blood vessel morphogenesis, 
blood vessel development, vasculature development, tube 
morphogenesis and development, endothelial and epithe-
lial cell migration, and response to growth factors (Addi-
tional file 1: Fig. S4). The molecular functions enriched 
included genes associated with enzyme binding, protein 
kinase binding, signal receptor binding, and transcription 
factor binding (Fig.  7E). Furthermore, a WikiPathways 
analysis demonstrated that the 74 genes were enriched 
several signaling pathways including VEGFA-VEGFR2, 
EGF/EGFR, Ras, EGFR, and ErbB (Fig.  7F). Together, 
these results suggest that AZGP1 works in part through 
constraining cancer progression though inhibiting angio-
genesis in human PCa.
We had noted above that the angiogenesis phenotype 
was found predominantly in AR negative PCa xenografts. 
To evaluate whether AZGP1 could affect microvessel 
density in AR + clinically localized human prostate can-
cer, we used the CellDIVE platform to perform multiplex 
immunohistochemistry analyses on a human prostate 
cancer tissue microarray (TMA) containing 215 cases. 
We have developed a deep-learning model to identify 
blood vessels based by combining CD31, CD34 and col-
lagen IV images and tabulated vessel numbers per core to 
capture microvessels[30]. Representative staining of high 
AZGP1 expression, captured based on quantitative fluo-
rescence and low numbers of microvessels (Fig. 7H) and

manually score AZGP1 protein expression into high and 
low categories, when we dichotomized our samples into 
high and low expression based on the median, we found 
that AZGP1 expression was inversely correlated with 
microvessel numbers in the cores (P < 0.0001, Fig.  7J). 
Analyzing AZGP1 expression as a continuous variable 
showed a modest, but highly significant inverse correla-
tion between AZGP1 expression and microvessel num-
ber (r = −0.19, p = 2 × ­10−7, Fig. 7K).
Discussion
Modulation of AZGP1 expression in  vivo results in 
changes in the stromal compartment of normal and 
malignant prostate tissues. In the AZGP1 knockout 
mouse, loss of expression is associated pergladular fibro-
sis over time as well as increased vascularity. In PCa cell 
lines that express little AZGP1 protein at baseline, over-
expression of AZGP1 significantly decreases microvessel 
density in mouse xenograft models. These findings are 
consistent with clinical data demonstrating that AZGP1 
loss is strongly associated with adverse outcomes in PCa 
and suggests that loss of expression promotes tumor 
angiogenesis. Furthermore, the inverse correlation of 
AZGP1 expression and microvessel density observed in 
localized human prostate cancers confirms the inhibitory 
effect observed in the animal models. In agreement with 
this hypothesis, low AZGP1 expression level in PC3 and 
DU145 tumor xenografts is associated with increased 
expression of angiogenic proteins. In addition, in TCGA-
PRAD, genes associated with AZGP1 expression overlap 
with many genes associated with angiogenesis, implying 
this observation is relevant to human early staged PCa.
Angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood ves-
sels, is crucial for various physiological and pathologi-
cal processes, including tumor growth and metastasis. 
It involves the migration, proliferation, and differentia-
tion of endothelial cells to form new blood vessels and 
supports tumor growth and metastasis by facilitat-
ing the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the growing 
tumor [35]. Many reports demonstrate that increased 
microvessel density in PCa is associated with adverse 
outcomes [36–39]. Proteomic analysis of AZGP1 over-
expressing cells showed repression of MMP9, GPX1, 
HSPB1, COL18A1, RNH1, and ANXA1, as well as 
increased expression of SERPINE1, YWHAZ, EPHA2, 
and PDCD6, and all of these proteins have been impli-
cated in angiogenesis. For example, MMP-9 causes 
release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to 
promote angiogenesis [40], and inhibition of MMP-9 
decreases both cell migration and angiogenesis in ret-
inoblastoma. [41]. GPX1-deficient mice display impaired 
angiogenesis, likely due to the inability of endothelial 
progenitor cells to stimulate angiogenesis because of 
elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [42]. 
ANXA1 has been implicated in vascular endothelial cell 
sprouting, and ANXA1 inactivation has been shown 
to impair angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis 
in mouse models [43]. ANXA1 has been demonstrated 
to promote endothelial tube formation and enhance 
VEGF secretion by activating the formyl peptide recep-
tor FPR2, and increased levels of ANXA1 correlate with 
angiogenesis in breast cancer [44]. On the other hand, 
PDCD6 shows increased expression in AZGP1 over-
expression, and has been reported to exert a suppressive 
effect on angiogenesis by binding to VEGFR-2, leading to 
the phosphorylation of PI3K and subsequent regulation 
of downstream signaling regulators. Overexpression of 
PDCD6 has shown to significantly inhibit VEGF-induced 
migration and tube formation of HUVECs[45]. Exami-
nation of transcripts correlated with AZGP1 expression 
in TCGA were enriched for key biological processes 
related to blood vessel development, vasculature forma-
tion, tube morphogenesis, and migration of endothelial 
and epithelial cells, confirming the association of AZGP1 
with angiogenesis in clinical samples. We have validated 
those findings in HUVECs, showing that administration 
of AZGP1 in the media inhibits HUVECs growth, migra-
tion, and tubular formation.
We found no evidence that AZGP1 affected cell growth, 
colony formation, migration or invasion, despite testing

the several PCa cell lines, spheroids from the human 
patient derived xenograft LUCaP147, and numerous 
repeats of these experiments. Our findings contrast with 
the previous publication where AZGP1 over-expression 
was reported to increase cell proliferation and migration 
in an androgen receptor (AR)-dependent manner [21]. In

addition, overexpression of AZGP1 did not have a signifi-
cant impact on tumor growth of PC3, 22RV1, and DU145 
xenograft models compared to vector controls with very 
low expression of AZGP1. Furthermore, our proteomic 
and transcriptomic analyses did not show a strong sig-
nal for pathways associated with cell proliferation, inva-
sion, or metastases. In other words, we could find no 
evidence of cell autonomous effects of AZGP1 expression 
in PCa. Instead, both the AZGP1 knockout mice and the 
xenograft models point to heterotypic effects of AZGP1 
on the prostate stromal microenvironment, where 
AZGP1 loss can promote proliferation of fibroblasts and 
angiogenesis.
The mechanisms underlying AZGP1’s effects on the 
prostate normal and tumor microenvironment are 
unclear. AZGP1 is a secreted glycoprotein [46] and 
could act as a ligand for specific receptors on fibroblasts 
or endothelial cells to directly affect angiogenesis and 
stromal cell growth [47]. For example, administration 
of exogenous AZGP1 to mice with ureteral obstruc-
tion decreases renal fibrosis, protecting against renal 
scarring and damage, implying it acts as a ligand in that 
it does not need to be expressed within a cell or tissue 
in order to show effects [48]. On the other hand, prot-
eomics and transcriptomics of AZGP1-expressing and 
non-expressing cells showed alterations in several pro-
teins implicated in angiogenesis and the extracellular 
matrix. One possible explanation of these findings is that 
AZGP1 acts indirectly in the cell by modulating effector 
proteins that mediate angiogenesis and stromal cell pro-
liferation. AZGP1 has significant homology to the class 
I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen-
presenting proteins, leading to speculation that AZGP1 
could also modulate the immune microenvironment 
[46]. However, since our in vivo experiments were con-
ducted in immune-deficient NSG mice, we were unable 
to test whether AZGP1 modulates the immune cell 
microenvironment.
Conclusions
We demonstrate that downregulation of AZGP1 does 
not impact cancer cell proliferation, migration, or inva-
sion in PCa. Rather, AZGP1 loss appears to affect fibro-
sis and angiogenesis in the normal prostate in an AZGP1 
knockout mouse model, and, importantly, angiogenesis 
in PCa cell line xenograft models and human surgical 
samples. Proteomics analysis of AZGP1 deficient and 
over-expressing PCa cell lines confirmed enrichment for 
pathways related to angiogenesis, including YWHAZ, 
EPHA2, SERPINE1, PDCD6, MMP9, GPX1, HSPB1, 
COL18A1, RNH1, and ANXA1.  AZGP1 suppresses 
the growth, migration, and tube formation capacity of 
HUVEC cells. Our findings provide valuable insights 
into the anti-angiogenic properties of AZGP1 in PCa 
and suggests that AZGP1 could represent a therapeu-
tic target in PCa. Further research is needed to eluci-
date the downstream signaling pathways involved in the 
anti-angiogenic function of AZGP1 for a comprehensive 
understanding of this important clinical biomarker of 
PCa aggressiveness.
