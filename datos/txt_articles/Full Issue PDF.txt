SUMMARY
Recent evidence demonstrates that low engraftment rates limit the efﬁcacy of human induced pluripotent stem
cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) for cardiac repair after myocardial infarction. In this study, we
attempted to overcome this limitation by enhancing the proliferative capacity of transplanted hiPSC-CMs. We
found that miR-590-3p overexpression increased the proliferative capacity of hiPSC-CMs. miR-590-3p over-
expression increased the number of engrafted cells and had a higher efﬁcacy for myocardial repair than control
cells. Moreover, we conﬁrmed the safety of using miR-590-3p-overexpressing hiPSC-CMs in pig hearts. These
results indicated that miR-590-3p overexpression stimulated hiPSC-CM cell cycle re-entry to induce cell pro-
liferation and increased the therapeutic efﬁcacy in MI. (J Am Coll Cardiol Basic Trans Science 2024;9:557–573)

espite signiﬁcant advances in dis-
ease management, end-stage heart
failure (HF) is the leading cause of
mortality worldwide because of the limited
regenerative capacity of the adult human
heart.1 In mammals, the proliferative capac-
ity of cardiomyocytes ceases in a short win-
dow after birth.2 As a result, injured hearts have a
limited ability to repair because they produce a
limited number of cardiomyocytes after myocardial
infarction (MI). Consequently, the ischemic site is
replaced by scar tissue without contractile function.
In recent years, concerted efforts have been made
to develop therapeutic strategies to promote myocar-
dial
regeneration.
Several
advanced
approaches,
including adult/somatic stem cell transplantation, in-
duction of the proliferation of endogenous cardio-
myocytes, and the transdifferentiation of resident
cardiac ﬁbroblasts into functional cardiomyocyte-
like cells, can improve cardiac function and reduce
cardiac ﬁbrosis in animal models of MI.3-5 However,
the therapeutic efﬁcacy of these methods is limited,
and these strategies have safety concerns, such as
an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia.6 There-
fore, it is crucial to develop novel, efﬁcient, and
safe
therapeutic
strategies
to
promote
cardiac
regeneration.
Transplanting human induced pluripotent stem
cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) into injured
myocardium is promising for end-stage HF treatment.
Unlike adult human cardiomyocytes, hiPSCs have
unlimited
self-renewal
capacity
and
can
readily
differentiate
into
cardiomyocytes
in
vitro
under
certain induction conditions. Theoretically, produc-
ing a clinically relevant number of hiPSC-CMs is
feasible through industrialization. CMs derived from
hiPSCs are structurally and functionally immature,
resembling fetal CMs, with a gene expression proﬁle
of a developing heart, small cell size, less organized
sarcomeres, small forces of contraction, and low
mitochondrial density compared with adult CMs.7 In
addition, although the long-term culture of hiPSC-
CMs stimulates cell maturation to some extent,8
metabolic maturation reduces the proliferation of
hiPSC-CMs and their ability to tolerate hypoxia.7 As a
result, only a small percentage of transplanted cells
survive at the injection sites, preventing harnessing
the full potential of hiPSC-CMs in cardiac regenera-
tion.9 Therefore, developing novel approaches to
enhance the engraftment rate of hiPSC-CMs during
cardiovascular disease treatment is critical.

However,

administration led to uncontrolled cardiac regenera-
tion in a pig model of MI.6
The role of miRNAs in regulating hiPSC-CM physi-
ology remains largely unknown. A previous study
performed miRNA functional screening and found
that miR-590-3p promoted cardiomyocyte prolifera-
tion.12 In addition, Lesizza et al14 reported that AAV6-
miR-590-3p stimulated endogenous cardiomyocyte
proliferation and improved cardiac function after MI.
However, little is known about the effect of miR-590-
3p on hiPSC-CM proliferation. In this study, we
investigated: 1) the ability of miR-590-3p to stimulate
hiPSC-CM proliferation; 2) the potential to transplant
miR-590-3p–overexpressing
(OE)
hiPSC-CMs
into
mouse and pig hearts; and 3) the ability of miR-590-
3p–OE hiPSC-CMs to promote cardiac repair in mouse
and pig models of MI.
METHODS
hiPSC CULTURE AND CARDIOMYOCYTE DIFFERENTIATION.
The hiPSC line RC01001-A (Nuwacell) was used in this
study. hiPSCs were maintained in Essential 8 medium
(Stemcell Technologies) and differentiated into car-
diomyocytes using the GiWi protocol.15 Differentiated
hiPSC-CMs were puriﬁed by metabolic selection be-
tween day 15 and day 25, as described previously.15
The purity of hiPSC-CMs was conﬁrmed by ﬂow
cytometry
using
a
FACSCalibur
ﬂow
cytometer
(Beckman Coulter). The maturation of differentiated
hiPSC-CMs was achieved by prolonging the culture
period (up to day 60).
PRODUCTION AND TRANSFECTION OF AAV6-miR-590-3P.
The plasmids AAV6-miR-590-3p and control AAV6
were purchased from GeneChem Technologies. AAV
packaging was conducted using AAV-293 cells, and
AAV particles were harvested from the supernatant
using an AAV Puriﬁcation Maxi Slurry Kit (AmyJet
Scientiﬁc).
The
concentration
of
particles
was
adjusted (1:100 to 1:1,000 dilution) to minimize cell
toxicity
and
achieve
transfection
efﬁciencies
of
>80%. After transfection, the expression of miR-590-
3p in hiPSC-CMs was detected by quantitative real-
time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION. Fluores-
cence in situ hybridization assays were performed to
detect miR-590-3p in heart tissues according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Brieﬂy, heart samples
were embedded in an optimal cutting temperature
compound for serial cryosectioning. The sections
(8 mm thick) were incubated with proteinase K (15 mg/
mL) at 37 C for 30 minutes. Then, miR-590-3p was
hybridized with a Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probe
(AmyJet Scientiﬁc). The sections were stained with
4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and imaged under an
inverted ﬂuorescence microscope (Leica).
IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE ANALYSES. Cell or tissue
samples were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde and
permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 at room tem-
perature for 15 minutes. After nonspeciﬁc antigen
blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 hour,
the samples were incubated with primary antibodies
(for details, see Supplemental Table 1) at 4 C over-
night and subsequently incubated with the corre-
sponding secondary antibodies at 37 C for 2 hours.
Wheat germ agglutinin (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) and
terminal
deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated
deoxyuridinetriphate
nick-end
labeling
(Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc) staining were performed using a
commercial kit. Nuclei were stained with 4’,6-dia-
midino-2-phenylindole.
MESSENGER RNA PROFILING. RNA sequencing of
control
and
miR-590-3p–OE
hiPSC-CMs
was
per-
formed using an Illumina 2000 and 2  100–base pair
paired-end sequencing (LC Sciences) as described
previously. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of
differentially
expressed
genes
was
performed
using
the
Lianchuan
Biological
Cloud
Platform
(LC Sciences).
ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS. Mice MI was induced in a
mouse model by ligating the left anterior descending
coronary
artery
(LAD)
as
described
previously.
Brieﬂy, M-NSG (NOD-PrkdcscidIl2rgem1/Smoc) female
mice (9-10 weeks old, provided by Shanghai Model
Organisms Center) were anesthetized with 2% iso-
ﬂurane and mechanically ventilated using an animal
ventilator
(Harvard
Apparatus).
The
heart
was
exposed by left thoracotomy, and the LAD was ligated
using an 8-0 Prolene suture (Ethicon). The animals
were randomly divided into 3 groups: an MI group (15
mL of phosphate-buffered saline), a control group
(5.0  105 wild-type hiPSC-CMs), and an miR-590-3p
group (5.0  105 miR-590-3p–OE hiPSC-CMs). After
cell delivery, the incisions were closed with 6-0 su-
tures. A sham group underwent all procedures except
LAD ligation.
Bama pigs (female; 20-25 kg) were used to evaluate
the therapeutic effect of hiPSC-CM transplantation on
MI. Brieﬂy, pigs were anesthetized with 2% isoﬂurane
and mechanically ventilated using an animal venti-
lator (Hallowell EMC). The heart was exposed by left
thoracotomy, and the LAD was occluded between
the ﬁrst and second diagonal coronary arteries with a
4-0 Prolene suture for 1 hour and then reperfused.

cells/heart, 8-10 points in the injured area) were
injected into the myocardium, and the incision was
closed. The animals received the following immuno-
suppressants: methylprednisolone sodium succinate
(2 mg/kg), tacrolimus (0.3 mg/kg), and mycopheno-
late mofetil (100 mg/kg). A telemetry device (Ensense
Biomedical Technologies) was implanted subcutane-
ously in the chest wall according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. The peripheral blood of each pig
was collected and analyzed at the Department of
Clinical Pathology of Shanghai General Hospital.
CARDIAC
FUNCTION
ANALYSES. Mice. Cardiac
function was assessed by echocardiography at indi-
cated timepoints. Mice were anesthetized with 2%
isoﬂurane and mechanically ventilated. Echocardi-
ography data were measured using a Visual Sonics
Vevo2100 system (Visual Sonics). Left ventricular
ejection
fraction
and
fractional
shortening
were
calculated using the following equations: ejection
fraction percentage ¼ [(LVEDV  LVESV)/LVEDV] 
100
and
fractional
shortening
percentage
¼
[(LVEDD  LVESD)/LVEDD]  100, where LVEDV and
LVESV are left ventricular end-diastolic and end-
systolic
volume,
respectively,
and
LVEDD
and
LVESD are left ventricular end-diastolic and end-
systolic diameter, respectively. An operator blinded
to the study groups performed all measurements.
Pigs. Cardiac
function
was
assessed
by
high-
resolution computed tomography (Siemens). Brieﬂy,
the animals were anesthetized with 2% isoﬂurane and
placed in the supine position. Before computed to-
mography
scanning,
an
iodinated
contrast
agent
(0.5 mL/kg; Abcam) was injected into the ear vein.
Cardiac function was analyzed with Vitrea Enterprise
Suite software (Siemens).
CELL ENGRAFTMENT. The engraftment of implanted
hiPSC-CMs was evaluated by bioluminescence live
imaging (BLI), immunoﬂuorescent staining, and qRT-
PCR. In BLI, luciferase-hiPSC-CMs were evaluated
using the IVIS Lumina III In Vivo Imaging System
(PerkinElmer) 7 and 28 days after cell delivery. The
average ﬂuorescence intensity of regions of interest
was quantitated. For histologic analysis, hiPSC-CMs
were stained with human-speciﬁc cardiac troponin T
and imaged using an inverted ﬂuorescence micro-
scope. The expression of the sex-determining region
Y (SRY) gene in the transplantation site was measured
to evaluate the engraftment rate of implanted hiPSC-
CMs, as described previously.

DUAL-LUCIFERASE
REPORTER
ASSAY. hiPSC-CMs
(5.0  104 cells/well) were seeded in 24-well plates
and cotransfected with TSC22D2 luciferase reporter
plasmids and miR-590-3p mimic or negative control
using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).
After 48 hours, luciferase activity was detected using
a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega).
Renilla luciferase activity was used as an inter-
nal control.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Data are presented as mean
 SD and analyzed using Graph Pad Prism software
version 9.0 (GraphPad Software Inc). The Shapiro-Wilk
test was used to assess normality. The unpaired Stu-
dent’s t-test was used for comparisons between 2
groups, and 1-way analysis of variance followed by the
Tukey’ post hoc test for multiple pairwise comparisons
was used for comparisons among >2 groups unless
otherwise speciﬁed. Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient
(r values with 95% CIs) was used to compare contin-
uous variables. A P value of <0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS
miR-590-3P IS ENRICHED IN THE FETAL HEART. To
assess the role of miR-590-3p in the cardiomyocyte
cell cycle, we ﬁrst measured its expression in human
hearts. Our results showed that miR-590-3p expres-
sion was signiﬁcantly higher in fetal hearts than in
adult hearts. Not surprisingly, the expression of the

proliferation genes cyclin B1 (CCNB1) and cyclin D1
(CCND1) was also signiﬁcantly higher in fetal hearts
than in adult hearts (Figure 1A). Next, we detected the
expression
of
miR-590-3p
during
mouse
cardiac
development by ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization and
qRT-PCR (Figure 1B). The miRNA ﬂuorescence in situ
hybridization assay demonstrated that miR-590-3p
was enriched in fetal mouse hearts (Figures 1C and
1D). Moreover, our qRT-PCR results demonstrated that
miR-590-3p expression was up-regulated in mouse
embryonic hearts and decreased after birth (Figure 1E).
We also investigated the correlation between the
expression of miR-590-3p and proliferation-related
genes in mouse hearts at different developmental
stages. The expression of CCNB1, CCND1, cyclin-
dependent kinase (CDK) 1, and CDK4 was linearly
correlated with that of miR-590-3p (Figures 1F to 1I).

PROLIFERATION. Next, we investigated
whether miR-590-3p overexpression promoted the
proliferation of hiPSC-CMs. For this purpose, hiPSCs
were differentiated into cardiomyocytes using the
GiWi protocol (Supplemental Figure 1A). miR-590-3p
overexpression was induced by AAV6-miR-590-3p
transfection and conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR 10 days after
transfection
(Supplemental
Figure
1B).
We
found
that
miR-590-3p–OE
hiPSC-CMs
were
immature
(Supplemental Figures 1C to 1E). Immunoﬂuorescence
analyses indicated that miR-590-3p overexpression
signiﬁcantly
increased
the
proportion
of
cells
expressing proliferation markers (Figures 2A to 2D).
We also assessed the effect of miR-590-3p on cell
apoptosis.
The
results
revealed
that
miR-590-3p
overexpression reduced the number of apoptotic
(transferase-mediated deoxyuridinetriphate nick-end
labeling–positive) cells in an ischemic and hypoxic
environment (Figures 2E and 2F). Moreover, qRT-PCR
analysis showed that miR-590-3p overexpression up-
regulated G1/S genes (CCND1 and CDK4) and G2/M
genes
(CCNA1
and
polo-like
kinase
1
[PLK1])
(Figures 2G and 2H), up-regulated the anti-apoptotic
gene Bcl-2, and down-regulated the pro-apoptotic
gene Bax in hiPSC-CMs (Figure 2I).
miR-590-3p
overexpression
up-regulated
1,304
genes and down-regulated 1,192 genes (Supplemental
Figures 2A to 2C). These genes were implicated in
cellular structure, excitation-contraction coupling,
and metabolism. Gene ontology enrichment analysis
showed
that
miR-590-3p
overexpression
affected
various biological processes, including cell prolifera-
tion and apoptosis (Supplemental Figure 2D). These
results are consistent with the ability of miR-590-3p
to
stimulate
cellular
proliferation
and
inhibit
apoptosis.
miR-590-3P PROMOTED hiPSC-CM PROLIFERATION
BY
REGULATING
THE
TSC22D2/PKM2
PATHWAY.
The molecular mechanism by which miR-590-3p reg-
ulates hiPSC-CM proliferation was investigated. We
performed a bioinformatics analysis to identify target
genes
using
4
target
gene
prediction
databases.
Ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 1 (ASB1),
transmembrane protein 18 (TMEM18), and TSC22
domain family member 2 (TSC22D2) were found in all
databases (Figure 3A). The results of qRT-PCR showed
that miR-590-3p decreased the expression of TMEM18
and TSC22D2 in hiPSC-CMs (Figure 3B). Further,
TSC22D2 expression was higher in cardiomyocytes
than
in
cardiac
ﬁbroblasts
and
endothelial
cells
(Figure
3C).
Therefore,
we
selected
TSC22D2
for
further studies and performed a dual-luciferase re-
porter
assay
to
assess
whether
TSC22D2
was
a
downstream target of miR-590-3p (Figure 3D). Our
results showed that the relative luciferase activity
decreased signiﬁcantly in cells expressing TSC22D2
and miR-590-3p (Figure 3E). A recent study reported
that
TSC22D2
inhibited
cellular
proliferation
by
regulating pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2).16 Relative
protein expression was measured by Western blot
analysis. The ﬁndings demonstrated that miR-590-3p
down-regulated
TSC22D2
expression
and
up-
regulated PKM2, cyclin B1, and cyclin D1, which
regulate cell proliferation (Figure 3F). Immunoﬂuo-
rescence
staining
showed
that
TSC22D2
over-
expression reversed the effect of miR-590-3p on
hiPSC-CM proliferation (Figures 3G and 3H).

indicated
that

day 28 post-MI, and miR-590-3p enhanced this ef-
fect (Figures 4C to 4G). The scar size was quantiﬁed
by histology (Masson’s tricolor staining). Control
hiPSC-CMs decreased the ﬁbrotic area, and miR-

enhanced
this
effect
(Figures 4H and 4I). These ﬁndings demonstrated

and immunoﬂuorescence staining were performed to
investigate
whether
miR-590-3p
overexpression
increased the number of engrafted hiPSC-CMs after
cell transplantation (Figure 5A). Luciferase-hiPSC-
CMs (5.0  105 cells) were injected into the infarcted
myocardium. BLI analysis showed that the luciferin
signal was higher in animals receiving miR-590-3p–
OE hiPSC-CMs than in controls at day 28 after cell
delivery (Figures 5B and 5C). In line with this obser-
vation, immunoﬂuorescence staining showed that the
area occupied by transplanted hiPSC-CMs (stained
with human-speciﬁc cardiac troponin T [green ﬂuo-
rescence]) was signiﬁcantly greater in mice receiving
miR-590-3p–OE hiPSC-CMs than in controls at day 28
after cell delivery (Figures 5D and 5E). qRT-PCR re-
sults demonstrated that the expression of the SRY
gene (transplanted cells indicator) demonstrated that
there were more miR-590-3p–OE hiPSC-CMs in the
heart
than
in
controls
after
transplantation
(Supplemental Figure 3). The results showed that
miR-590-3p promoted the proliferation and expan-
sion of the graft in vivo.
The ability of miR-590-3p to induce cellular prolif-
eration was assessed by measuring the number of
transplanted hiPSC-CMs expressing the proliferation
markers
Ki67
and
PH3
via
immunoﬂuorescence
staining. The expression levels of Ki67 and PH3 were
2- and 4-fold higher, respectively, in miR-590-3p–OE
cells than in control cells (Figures 6A to 6D). qRT-PCR
analysis indicated that the expression levels of the
proliferation-related genes CCNB1, CCND1, CDK4, and
PLK1 were remarkably higher in myocardium treated
with miR-590-3p–OE hiPSC-CMs than in hearts treated
with control cells (Supplemental Figures 4A to 4D).
We also assessed whether miR-590-3p–OE hiPSC-CMs
could induce the proliferation of endogenous car-
diomyocytes. The proportion of Ki67-positive endog-
enous cardiomyocytes was signiﬁcantly higher in the
infarct border zone of animals treated with miR-590-
3p–OE hiPSC-CMs (Figures 6E and 6F).
Angiogenesis plays a critical role in myocardial
repair following MI. Therefore, we measured micro-
vessel density by CD31 immunoﬂuorescence staining
in the infarct border zone at day 28 post-MI. The re-
sults showed that microvessel density was almost 2-
fold higher in the infarct border zone of animals
treated with miR-590-3p–OE hiPSC-CMs than in the
myocardium of animals treated with control cells
(Figures 7A and 7B).
The protective function of hiPSC-CMs on cardiac
hypertrophy was assessed by measuring the cross-
sectional surface area of native cardiomyocytes in
the infarct border zone. The cross-sectional surface
area of cardiomyocytes was signiﬁcantly smaller in
the infarct border zone of animals treated with miR-
590-3p–OE hiPSC-CMs than in animals treated with
control cells (Figures 7C and 7D). These results indi-
cated that miR-590-3p overexpression increased the
ability of hiPSC-CMs to promote angiogenesis and
inhibit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

PROLIFERATION IN A PIG MODEL OF MI. We evalu-

in
Figure
8A.
Cardiac
function
was
evaluated
28 days after MI by high-resolution computed to-
mography. Both control hiPSC-CMs and miR-590-3p–
OE hiPSC-CMs enhanced left ventricular ejection
fraction and left ventricular fractional shortening
while
reducing
LVEDV
and
LVESV.
In
addition,
cardiac function was better in the miR-590-3p–OE
hiPSC-CM
group
than
in
the
control
group
(Figures 8B to 8E). Similarly, the analyses of fresh
heart slides showed that hiPSC-CM transplantation
reduced scar size, and miR-590-3p–OE hiPSC-CMs
had
a
stronger
effect
on
scar
reduction.
Thus,
miR-590-3p–OE hiPSC-CM transplantation has ther-
apeutic potential for MI.
Analysis of Ki67 and PH3 expression by immuno-
ﬂuorescence staining showed that miR-590-3p signif-
icantly enhanced hiPSC-CM proliferation in porcine
hearts. (Supplemental Figures 5A to 5D). We next
assessed the safety of using miR-590-3p–OE hiPSC-
CMs in pig hearts. Blood cell analysis showed that the
number of monocytes increased slightly after hiPSC-
CM delivery, and this increase might be caused by the
surgical procedure (Supplemental Figures 6A to 6D).
The levels of serum chemistry in hepatic, renal, and
cardiac analyses did not change signiﬁcantly after
hiPSC-CM transplantation in the control and miR-590-
3p groups (Supplemental Figures 6E to 6H). In addi-
tion, continuous electrocardiogram recordings detec-
ted by a telemetry device showed that miR-590-3p–OE
hiPSC-CM transplantation did not cause an increase in
arrhythmic events (premature ventricular contrac-
tions
and
nonsustained
ventricular
tachycardia)
(Supplemental
Figures
6I
and
6J).
These
results
demonstrated the safety and efﬁcacy of the trans-
plantation of miR-590-3p–OE hiPSC-CMs.

DISCUSSION
Severe MI usually results in a signiﬁcant loss of car-
diomyocytes. During the early stage of MI, cardiac
ﬁbroblasts are activated and produce extracellular
matrix (ECM) in response to new hemodynamic con-
ditions.17 However, the loss of cardiomyocytes and
excessive ECM deposition causes changes in cardiac
structure, impairing function and ultimately leading
to HF. hiPSC-CM transplantation is a potentially
effective therapeutic strategy for heart tissue repair.
However, several critical issues need to be resolved
before clinical application. Our results demonstrated
that miR-590-3p enhanced the ability of hiPSC-CMs to
improve
MI
by
regulating
the
TSC22D2/PKM2
pathway.
Low engraftment rates after cell transplantation
are one of the primary obstacles to achieving the

functional regeneration of injured hearts through
stem cell therapy.18,19 This study provides the ﬁrst
evidence that miR-590-3p stimulates the proliferation
of hiPSC-CMs in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, miR-
590-3p increased the hiPSC-CM engraftment rate,
improving cardiac
function and reducing cardiac
ﬁbrosis and hypertrophy after MI.
In mammalian fetuses, approximately 3% to 15% of
cardiomyocytes are in the cell cycle,20 which in-
creases cardiac regeneration capacity by stimulating
cardiomyocyte division. Gene expression proﬁling
and proteomics analysis identiﬁed several factors
that
increase
the
proliferative
capacity
of
car-
diomyocytes, and in vivo studies demonstrated that
proliferative
genes
stimulated
mitosis
in
adult
mammalian cardiomyocytes after MI.21 Similar to
adult cardiomyocytes, the proliferative capacity of
hiPSC-CMs decreases with prolonged culturing, and
hiPSC-CMs initiate maturation and exit the cell cycle
after transplantation.22 Our results demonstrated the
ability of miR-590-3p to promote cellular prolifera-
tion. We found that the expression of miR-590-3p
decreased
during
cardiac
maturation.
Gain-of-
function experiments demonstrated that miR-590-3p
promoted hiPSC-CM proliferation. miR-590-3p also
increased the number of proliferating hiPSC-CMs
in vitro by more than 2-fold and increased the
engraftment rate of implanted hiPSC-CMs by more
than 1.5-fold in a mouse model of MI. Furthermore,
the expression of proliferation markers Ki67 and PH3
was
signiﬁcantly
up-regulated
in
cardiomyocytes
receiving miR-590-3p–OE hiPSC-CMs, suggesting that
paracrine
factors
secreted
by
hiPSC-CMs
induce
endogenous cardiomyocyte proliferation.
The effect of miR-590-3p on cell proliferation var-
ies depending on the disease model and cell type. For
instance, Salem et al23 demonstrated that miR-590-3p
promoted ovarian cancer growth and metastasis by
enhancing
tumor
cell
proliferation.23
Conversely,
Wang et al24 observed that miR-590-3p inhibited os-
teosarcoma
cell
proliferation
and
metastasis
by
regulating SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9).24
The varying effect of miR-590-3p on tumor cell pro-
liferation in different cancers may be related to the
target genes it regulates and the expression of target
genes in tumor cells. miR-590-3p promotes endoge-
nous cardiomyocyte proliferation in rodents. How-
ever, little is known about the function of miR-590-3p
in hiPSC-CM proliferation. Our results showed that
miR-590-3p
increased
hiPSC-CM
proliferation,
whereas other studies found that miR-590-3p pro-
moted hiPSC-CM proliferation to a small extent. This
discrepancy may be attributable to the different iPSC
cell lines used across studies and differences in gene
expression and biological functions among cell lines.
Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of the role of
miR-590-3p in iPSC cell lines can help develop hiPSC-
CM–based therapeutic strategies for MI.
Uncontrolled
cardiomyocyte
proliferation
in-
creases the risk of death in patients with MI. Gabiso-
nia et al6 reported that the expression of human
miRNA-199a in infarcted pig hearts stimulated cardiac
repair. However, the persistent and uncontrolled
expression of this miRNA resulted in the sudden
arrhythmic death of treated pigs. These results indi-
cate that achieving cardiac repair by stimulating
endogenous cardiomyocyte proliferation is attainable
in large mammals; however, the dosage of this ther-
apy needs to be tightly controlled. In our study, 5.0 
107 cells were transplanted into infarcted hearts.19
Previous studies reported that mechanical action
and electrical activity promoted hiPSC-CM matura-
tion. Moreover, graft cells matured 30 days after
hiPSC-CM transplantation in neonatal mice.25 These
results conﬁrm that the proliferative capacity of
hiPSC-CMs decreases after transplantation while their
contractile
and
metabolic
functions
increase.
Furthermore,
our
experimental
results
conﬁrmed
that miR-590-3p–OE hiPSC-CM transplantation was
not associated with an increase in arrhythmic events,
demonstrating that miR-590-3p–OE hiPSC-CM trans-
plantation is safe and effective for treating MI.
Cardiac
ﬁbrosis
causes
ventricular
systolic
dysfunction.
In
addition,
cardiac
overload
and
nutrient deﬁciency contribute to cardiomyocyte hy-
pertrophy in the peri-infarct zone. Therefore, even
after recovering from initial infarction, ﬁbrosis affects
the
viability
of
peri-infarct
zone
cardiomyocytes
through the disintegration of the ECM and replace-
ment of necrotic tissue by scar tissue.26 We found that
hiPSC-CM transplantation restored cardiac function,
increased
microvessel
density,
and
reduced
car-
diomyocyte hypertrophy and that miR-590-3p over-
expression enhanced these effects.
Because of differences in hemodynamic and elec-
trophysiologic properties between mice and humans,
research data from rodent models cannot be trans-
lated to humans.27 Nonetheless, preclinical animal
models, such as pigs and nonhuman primates, are
essential to assess clinical safety. Gabisonia et al6
reported that intramyocardial injections of miR-199a
induced
endogenous
cardiomyocyte
proliferation,
improving functional recovery in a pig model of MI.
However, uncontrolled endogenous cardiomyocyte
proliferation mediated by miR-199 overexpression
predisposed to ventricular arrhythmias, leading to
sudden death.6 Our study assessed the safety of using
miR-590-3p–OE hiPSC-CMs in pig hearts. The number

the pericardial ﬂuid; and the levels of hepatic, renal,
and cardiac markers have no difference between miR-

and

STUDY
LIMITATIONS. In
the
present
study,
we
analyzed the phenotype of the mouse/pig model 4
weeks after MI. Although miR-590-3p-OE hiPSC-CMs
showed a restorative effect on cardiac function in the
early stages of MI, further research is required to
assess myocardial recovery in the long run.
CONCLUSIONS
The results showed that miR-590-3p overexpression
promoted hiPSC-CM proliferation in vitro and in vivo.
Further, miR-590-3p improved the therapeutic effect
of hiPSC-CMs on MI by increasing the engraftment
rate. Importantly, we conﬁrmed the safety of using
miR-590-3p–OE hiPSC-CMs in pig hearts. These re-
sults demonstrate that the transplantation of miR-
590-3p–OE hiPSC-CMs
is potentially
effective
for
cardiac regeneration.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: We
have demonstrated that miR-590-3p–overexpressed
hiPSC-CMs enhance cardiac function 28 days after MI
in a preclinical pig model. With potential clinical trials
in the near future, the safety of the treatment was
also evaluated in this paper. We found that the
transplantation of miR-590-3p–overexpressed hiPSC-
CMs is potentially effective for cardiac regeneration.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: miR-590-3p
improved the therapeutic effect of hiPSC-CMs on MI
by increasing the engraftment rate. This may present
potential new strategies for treating MI, thus helping
the development of novel therapeutics.

EDITORIAL COMMENT
More Bang for the Buck
Using miRNA-Treated Human iPSC-Derived
Cardiomyocytes for Cardiac Repair*
Timothy J. Kamp, MD, PHD
A
lthough
reperfusion
remains
the
optimal
therapy
for
acute
myocardial
infarction
(MI), a substantial portion of patients are
unable to achieve prompt reperfusion, leading to
signiﬁcant MIs. Following an MI, necrotic tissue is
replaced by
ﬁbrous scar tissue rather than new
functional muscle because the adult human heart
lacks a regenerative capacity. Such loss of func-
tional muscle can initiate the progressive spiral to
heart failure
and
death despite
optimal
medical
and device therapy. Although heart transplantation
remains
an
option
for
end-stage
heart
failure,
limited donor organs and lifelong immunosuppres-
sion remain major limitations. Thus, the quest to
remuscularize the post-MI heart is being actively
pursued using a variety of innovative approaches.
Broadly, investigators are following 3 general strate-
gies: 1) reactivate proliferation of endogenous cardi-
omyocytes; 2) reprogram native cardiac cells such as
ﬁbroblasts
to
functional
cardiomyocytes;
and
3)
transplant human pluripotent stem cell-derived car-
diomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) or cardiac progenitor cells.
However, as the study by Zhang et al1 in this issue
of JACC: Basic to Translational Science suggests, a
combination
of
approaches
may
be
the
most
effective.
Over the past decade, great progress has been
made in developing approaches using hPSC-CMs to
regenerate injured heart muscle in a variety of an-
imal models. Despite a handful of phase 1 clinical
trials testing the safety of various approaches to
deliver hPSC-CMs to treat patients with heart fail-
ure, major roadblocks remain before the full po-
tential
of
this
approach
can
be
realized—
remuscularization of the damaged heart. Prominent
among the challenges are: 1) overcoming immuno-
logical barriers for an allogeneic cell product; and 2)
dosing and biomanufacturing limitations. The latter
challenge relates to the fact that despite efforts at
optimizing
cell
preparation
and
delivery
ap-
proaches,
intramyocardial
delivery
of
hPSC-CMs
leads to a relatively low survival rate for trans-
planted cells, <10% or lower. Thus, to realize sig-
niﬁcant remuscularization in large animal models,
investigators have used large doses, generally in the
range of 1 billion hPSC-CMs. Biomanufacturing ap-
proaches continue to improve, but the costs will
potentially be prohibitive with current technology
given that 1 billion hPSC-CMs must be generated
per patient and more than 1 treatment may be
needed.
Thus,
ways
to
enable
smaller
doses
of
hPSC-CMs to provide clinical beneﬁt are of great
practical
importance
to
advancing
this
potential
therapeutic avenue.
As
in
normal
development,
differentiation
of
hPSCs to CMs leads to cells that are initially pro-
liferative, but as they mature, the cells exit the cell
cycle and stop dividing. The hPSC-CMs that have
been tested for cell therapy, although immature,
have
largely
stopped
proliferating.
If
instead
of
nonproliferating CMs, a population of proliferative
CMs could be transplanted and the cells continue to
divide, there could be more beneﬁt per dose. A
number
of
experimental
approaches
have
been
demonstrated to reactivate proliferation in quies-
cent CMs, including forced expression of certain

microRNAs (miRs).2 MiRs are small RNAs of 18-22
nucleotides that are noncoding and typically act by
binding
the
30-untranslated
region
of
target
messenger
RNAs,
leading
to
degradation
and/or
translational repression. Prior research showed that
delivery of miR199a-3p or miR-590-3p in the post-
MI
adult
mouse
heart
induced
endogenous
car-
diomyocyte proliferation, reduced infarct size, and
improved cardiac function.2 Can forced expression
of proliferation-inducing miRs in hPSC-CMs main-
tain
the
hPSC-CMs
in
a
proliferative
state
and
improve dosing requirements?
Zhang et al1 tested AAV6-mediated delivery of
miR-590-3p to hiPSC-CMs and demonstrated that
forced
expression
of
miR-590-3p
did
lead
to
increased proliferation of the hiPSC-CMs in culture.
Furthermore, by characterizing the potential targets
of miRNA-590-3p, they demonstrated that the target
TSC22 domain family member 2 is down-regulated,
which leads to up-regulation of pyruvate kinase
M2 and downstream cell cycle genes. Next, the in-
vestigators tested delivery of hiPSC-CMs transduced
with miR-590-3p to mouse hearts at the time of
surgically induced MI. They found evidence using
bioluminescent imaging of a luciferase reporter as
well as histology that the miR-590-3p-expressing
hiPSC-CMs formed larger grafts containing prolifer-
ating CMs at 28 days, which was accompanied by a
signiﬁcantly greater improvement in cardiac func-
tion
relative
to
treatment
with
nontransduced
hiPSC-CMs. The study then tested the same strategy
delivering
miR-590-3p
hiPSC-CMs
to
pig
hearts
following
surgically
induced
MI
and
showed
remarkable improvements in cardiac function rela-
tive to sham control and improved relative to non-
transduced hiPSC-CMs. This was accomplished in
the porcine model with a dose of 50 million hiPSC-
CMs, which is 10-20–fold lower than effective doses
in prior large animal studies. Furthermore, the in-
vestigators
did
not
ﬁnd
signals
for
toxicity,
including a lack of induced ventricular tachycardia.
The ﬁnding that proliferating hiPSC-CMs are able to
form larger grafts than nonproliferating hiPSC-CMs is
consistent with recent studies that used an alternative
approach to activate proliferation: overexpression of
the key cell cycle gene, CCND2.3 Interestingly, the
study by Zhao et al3 demonstrated that an effect of
CCND2 overexpression was to stimulate the release
of exosomes containing miR302b-3p and miR373-3p,
which increase the proliferation of CMs. But uncon-
trolled proliferation of hiPSC-CMs or native CMs can
lead to adverse outcomes, as was highlighted by
overexpression of miR-199a-3p in post-MI pig hearts
resulting in sustained ventricular tachycardia and
death despite signiﬁcant cardiac regeneration.4 Thus,
it will be essential to advance strategies that control
the degree and timing of hiPSC-CM proliferation.
Additionally, not all approaches to induce prolifera-
tion of hPSC-CMs will exert equal effects and safety.
For example, miRs target large gene regulatory net-
works, and each “proliferation”-inducing miR may be
associated with distinct risk proﬁles. Perhaps the fact
that miR-590-3p has been demonstrated to inhibit
proliferation of hepatocellular cancer cells and is being
tested as an anticancer therapy suggests that it might
help counter a concern from hPSC-related therapy:
tumor
formation.5
Additionally,
therapy-induced
ventricular tachycardia, whether primarily from the
hPSC-CM graft or from continued proliferation of CMs,
will be an important safety outcome that undoubtedly
will differ among the distinct strategies. Although it is
encouraging that Zhang et al1 did not observe ven-
tricular tachycardia in the porcine post-MI model with
1 month of observation, longer and larger studies are
needed
to
conﬁrm
this
safety
readout.
Overall,
exciting progress in advancing cardiac regeneration
therapies to clinical application continues, but the
biological complexities and practical realities require
continued
effort
to
fully
realize
the
remarkable
promise.

HIGHLIGHTS

Prospective associations between
individual CVD risk factors in early life
and EAA in midlife suggest that childhood
BMI and TGs may affect adulthood EAA,
pointing to potential precision strategies
to decelerate the biological aging
process.

Simultaneously measured CVD risk factors
and EAA provide temporal evidence that
CVD risk factors such as BMI, TGs, and
HDL-C act as upstream determinants
rather than consequences of EAA.

The mediating effect of EAA in the
association between childhood CVD risk
factors and subclinical atherosclerosis
implicates EAA as a potential molecular
link between early life CVD risk and the
development of subclinical disease in
adulthood.

SUMMARY
Although epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) might serve as a molecular signature of childhood cardiovascular
disease (CVD) risk factors and further promote midlife subclinical CVD, few studies have comprehensively
examined these life course associations. This study sought to test whether childhood CVD risk factors predict
EAA in adulthood and whether EAA mediates the association between childhood CVD risks and midlife sub-
clinical disease. Among 1,580 Bogalusa Heart Study participants, we estimated extrinsic EAA, intrinsic EAA,
PhenoAge acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel), and GrimAge acceleration (GrimAgeAccel) during adulthood. We
tested prospective associations of longitudinal childhood body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipids, and
glucose with EAAs using linear mixed effects models. After conﬁrming EAAs with midlife carotid intima-media
thickness and carotid plaque, structural equation models examined mediating effects of EAAs on associa-
tions of childhood CVD risk factors with subclinical CVD measures. After stringent multiple testing cor-
rections, each SD increase in childhood BMI was signiﬁcantly associated with 0.6-, 0.9-, and 0.5-year
increases in extrinsic EAA, PhenoAgeAccel, and GrimAgeAccel, respectively (P < 0.001 for all 3 associa-
tions). Likewise, each SD increase in childhood log-triglycerides was associated with 0.5- and 0.4-year
increases in PhenoAgeAccel and GrimAgeAccel (P < 0.001 for both), respectively, whereas each SD increase
in childhood high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was associated with a 0.3-year decrease in GrimAgeAccel
(P ¼ 0.002). Our ﬁndings indicate that PhenoAgeAccel mediates an estimated 27.4% of the association
between childhood log-triglycerides and midlife carotid intima-media thickness (P ¼ 0.022). Our data
demonstrate that early life CVD risk factors may accelerate biological aging and promote subclinical
atherosclerosis. (J Am Coll Cardiol Basic Trans Science 2024;9:577–590) © 2024 The Authors. Published

ardiovascular disease (CVD) remains
the leading cause of mortality glob-
ally,1
with
major
risk
factors
including high blood pressure (BP), adverse lipid pro-
ﬁle, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body mass
index (BMI) contributing heavily to its global disease
burden.2,3 Evidence suggests that CVD events are the
consequence of a lifelong atherosclerotic process,
starting with the development of related risk factors
during early life.4 Carotid intima-media thickness
(cIMT) is a noninvasive measurement of subclinical
atherosclerosis,5,6
which
has
been
reproducibly
linked to early life CVD risk factors and shown to pre-
dict
the
development
of
clinical
CVD
events.
Although the associations of CVD risk factors with
subclinical CVD have been well established, the mo-
lecular
mechanisms
underlying
these
relations
remain an area of active investigation. Improved
mechanistic understanding is needed for the devel-
opment of novel therapeutic strategies that might
delay or even reverse the lifelong atherosclerotic pro-
cess. Furthermore, work in this area could enhance
early detection efforts.
Unlike the human genome, the methylome can be
inﬂuenced by environmental factors7-9 in addition to
genetics, making it an attractive target for disease
prevention research. The past decade has given rise
to an abundance of “epigenetic clocks,” which are
composed of DNA methylation (DNAm) sites that
predict
chronological
age

accuracy.10-14 Deviation of chronological age from
epigenetic clock age, termed epigenetic age acceler-
ation
(EAA),
has
been
identiﬁed
as
a
powerful
biomarker of aging-related disease and mortality.15,16
Most commonly, EAA has been estimated based on
clocks derived from Horvath (Horvath DNAmAge),11
Hannum et al (Hannum DNAmAge),12 Levine et al
(PhenoAge),16 and Lu et al (GrimAge),17 with each EAA
measure composed of distinct methylation sites that
reﬂect both unique and common aging-related pro-
cesses. For example, intrinsic epigenetic age accel-
eration (IEAA) represents aging independent of blood
immune cell composition,18 while extrinsic epige-
netic age acceleration (EEAA) estimates aging taking
into account blood immune cell-type composition.
PhenoAge acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel) and GrimAge
acceleration
(GrimAgeAccel)
were
developed
to
correlate with aging-related physiological dysregula-
tion16 and mortality,17 respectively. A growing body
of published data has reported associations between
EAA measures and CVD,19-21 along with its risk fac-
tors.20,22 Despite their potential clinical signiﬁcance,
existing works are predominantly based on cross-
sectional
associations
and
lack
temporal
clarity.
Recent studies leveraging longitudinal data have re-
ported prospective associations of EAA with CVD and
overall cardiovascular health (CVH).19,23 However,
longitudinal associations of EAA with individual CVD
risk factors remain unknown, and whether EAA could
mediate associations between individual CVD risk
factors and CVD has not been studied.
Here, we report the results of our investigation into
the associations between early life CVD risk factors,
EAA measures, and subclinical CVD among a biracial
sample of participants from the on-going BHS (Boga-
lusa Heart Study). Our unique study design leveraged
multiple measures of individual CVD risk factors and
EAA collected across the life course to examine lon-
gitudinal and temporal relationships between these
variables. Furthermore, we conﬁrmed associations of
EAA with subclinical CVD in the BHS and further
explored the mediating effects of EAA on the associ-
ations between early life CVD risk factors and the
development of subclinical CVD.
METHODS
STUDY
PARTICIPANTS. The BHS is a population-
based long-term study examining the natural history
of CVD and its risk factors from childhood to adult-
hood among residents of Bogalusa, Louisiana. From
1973 to today, 9 surveys were conducted in children
and adolescents aged 4-17 years, and 11 surveys were
conducted among adults aged 18-51 years who had
been
examined
previously
as
children.
Detailed
description of the BHS design and methods have been
reported previously.24 This study included a total of
1,580 participants from the BHS who had at least 1
measure of clinical CVD risk factors, including BMI,
systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure
(DBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(HDL-C),
tri-
glycerides (TGs), and glucose in childhood and at
least 1 assessment of genome-wide DNAm in adult-
hood. Among these participants, we examined the
prospective relationship of childhood CVD risk factors
with
adulthood
EAA.
Of
the
1,580
participants
included in the prospective analyses, 688 had at least
2 simultaneously collected measures of identiﬁed
clinical CVD risk factors and DNAm spanning young
adulthood through midlife, contributing to cross-
lagged panel analyses that were employed to sup-
port causal inference. A total of 1,485 participants had
available EAA and subclinical atherosclerosis mea-
surements
for
cross-sectional
analyses
aimed
to
conﬁrm these associations in the BHS, and among
them, 531 participants had temporally appropriate
CVD risk factor, EAA, and subclinical CVD risk factor
data for mediation analyses. Figure 1 provides a visual
schematic of our unique study design.
Informed consents were obtained from all the BHS
participants after detailed explanation of the study.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board at Tulane University.
MEASUREMENT OF EAA. DNAm proﬁling was con-
ducted using whole blood samples obtained in up to 3
BHS visit cycles, including the 2004-2006, 2008-2010,
and 2013-2016 visits, using methods detailed in a
previous report.18,25 In brief, DNA was extracted from
whole blood using the PureLink Pro 96 Genomic DNA
Kit
(Life
Technologies,
Thermo
Fisher
Scientiﬁc)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Following
DNA extraction, the Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450
BeadChip (Illumina) was used for whole genome
DNAm quantiﬁcation. Samples were processed at the
Microarray Core Facility, University of Texas South-
western Medical Center at Dallas. Generated raw data
were
processed
and
normalized
using
Illumina’s
GenomeStudio
Methylation
Module
software
to
generate a ﬁnal matrix of beta estimates for each
cytosine-phosphate-guanine site. Following epige-
netic proﬁling and normalization, EEAA, IEAA, Phe-
noAgeAccel, and GrimAgeAccel at each study visit
were calculated using Horvath’s online DNA Methyl-
ation Age Calculator.26 This calculator incorporates
an internal normalization procedure to further con-
trol batch effects using a modiﬁed beta mixture

RISK
FACTORS
AND
COVARIATES. In
the
ongoing
BHS,
demographic
characteristics such as age, sex, race, and lifestyle risk
factors including smoking and drinking status, as well
as medical history are collected using standardized
questionnaires at each visit. Smoking and drinking
status were categorized as never or ever. During a
physical examination, anthropometric measures were
obtained with participants in light clothing without
shoes. At each visit, body weight and height were
measured twice to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm,
respectively. BMI was calculated by dividing mean
body weight in kilograms by mean height in meters
squared. In childhood, BP was measured in duplicate
from the right arm using a mercury sphygmoma-
nometer while participants were in a relaxed, sitting
position. In adulthood, BP was measured in triplicate
on the right arm of participants using the Omron HEM
907XL digital BP device after 5 minutes in the sitting
position. For 12 hours prior to the study visit, partic-
ipants were advised to avoid eating, smoking, intake
of caffeine and alcohol, and physical activity.28,29
Fasting blood samples are collected by venipuncture
by trained personnel. Plasma glucose and serum total
cholesterol, HDL-C, and TGs are measured by stan-
dard enzymatic procedures. LDL-C is estimated using
the Friedewald equation.30
MEASUREMENT OF SUBCLINICAL ATHEROSCLEROSIS.
Carotid ultrasonography was performed on a subset
of BHS participants by trained personnel at the 2008-
2010 and 2013-2016 study visits. Ultrasound mea-
surements included maximum cIMT at diastole from
the far walls of the common carotid artery, carotid
bulb, and internal carotid artery segments bilaterally.
The mean of the maximum cIMT test reading from the
3 left and 3 right far walls of the common, bulb, and
internal segments were used for the analysis. Carotid
plaque was deﬁned as a cIMT $1.5 mm at any of the 6
measured sites.5

Study Design
In the BHS (Bogalusa Heart Study), 1,580 participants were included in the analyses to detect prospective association between childhood
cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) and 4 forms of midlife epigenetic age accelerations (EAAs). The childhood CVRFs were aggregated using
area under curve (AUC) method. Temporal relationships between factors with signiﬁcant associations were further investigated among 688
participants using the cross-lagged panel analysis with simultaneously measured CVRFs and EAAs at the 2004-2006, 2008-2010, and 2013-
2016 visits. A total of 1,485 participants were used to access the cross-sectional association between carotid intima media thickness (cIMT)
or presence of carotid plaque and EAA. Mediation effects of identiﬁed EAA measurements were then evaluated among 531 participants.

estimate for each participant using methods devel-
oped speciﬁcally for the BHS and employed exten-
sively in this cohort.31-33 In brief, growth curves of
CVD risk factors measured multiple times during
childhood (when a participant was <18 years of age)
were constructed using a random effects model in
SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute, Inc). The mixed model
regresses the continuous risk factor on ﬁxed and
random effects of age and its higher order terms. The
model allows the intercept, linear, and nonlinear
parameters to vary from individual to individual,
with the random effect coefﬁcients representing the
difference between the ﬁxed parameters and the
observed values for each individual. To avoid collin-
earity of age with its higher order terms, age was
centered to the mean age of BHS participants in
childhood. Quadratic growth curves were ﬁtted for all
factors in race-sex groups. The AUCs were calculated
as the integral of the curve parameters during the
follow-up period for each participant.
Prospective associations of early life CVD risk
factors with adulthood EAA. Associations of the
early life CVD risk factors (as continuous AUC values)
with EAA were tested using multiple linear mixed
effects
models
that
leveraged
up
to
3
repeated
adulthood measures of EAA. An autoregressive cor-
relation matrix was used to account for the repeated
measures
within
individuals.
Multiple
covariates
measured simultaneously with EAA were adjusted.
Model 1 was adjusted for age, sex, and race. Model 2
additionally accounted for smoking and drinking
status. A Bonferroni correction to account for testing
each EAA measure for association with 7 CVD risk
factors was employed, with a P value threshold of
7.1  103 used for determining statistical signiﬁ-
cance. The results of mixed effects models are pre-
sented as regression coefﬁcient (beta) and SE. To
further support temporal inference for identiﬁed as-
sociations between clinical CVD risk factors and EAA,
simultaneously collected measures of CVD risk fac-
tors and EAA at 2 time points, spanning young
adulthood
through
midlife,
were
leveraged
to
conduct cross-lagged panel analyses.34 Speciﬁcally,
participants who attended at least 2 study visits
where CVD risk factors and EAA were concurrently
measured were included in this analysis. If data were
available for more than 2 visits, data from the ﬁrst and
last available visits were used. Figure 2A provides a
schematic of the conceptual model underlying the
cross-lagged

using
BMI
as

example. This analysis examines reciprocal, longitu-
dinal relationships between CVD risk factors and

performed to test whether differences in time in-
tervals between exams inﬂuenced results of the
cross-lagged analysis. We conducted the ﬁrst sensi-
tivity analysis among a subset of the cross-lagged
analysis
participants
who
attended
the
2
most
recent study visits between 2008-2010 and 2013-2016.
Our second sensitivity analysis utilized data from all
participants included in the original cross-lagged
modelling approach, additionally including time in-
terval between visits as a covariable in the analysis.
Associations of EAAs with subclinical atherosclerosis.
Cross-sectional associations between EAA and the
continuous cIMT, as well as the discrete carotid pla-
que phenotypes, were examined using multiple linear
and logistic regression models, respectively. Two
multivariable models were utilized: model 1 adjusted
for age, sex, and race; and model 2 adjusted for
covariates
in
model
1,
along
with
smoking
and
drinking
status.
These
analyses
were
conducted
based on data obtained from the most recently
completed study visit for each participant.
Mediation
effects
of
EAA. To
assess
whether
identiﬁed EAA measures (longitudinally associated
with a CVD risk factor and cross-associated with
cIMT) mediated the associations between early life
CVD risk factors and midlife cIMT, we conducted
mediation
analyses
based
on
the
path
diagrams
illustrated in
Figure
2B,
again
using
BMI
as
an
example. For these analyses, measurement of cIMT at
the 2013-2016 visit was assessed as the outcome, the
EAA measurement in a visit prior to the cIMT mea-
surement was assessed as the mediator, and the AUC
of childhood CVD risk factors, measured when par-
ticipants were 18 years of age or less, were assessed as
the exposure. Here, the beta coefﬁcient for the asso-
ciation between the childhood CVD risk factor AUC
and midlife cIMT is deﬁned as total effect (denoted as
c in Figure 2B). The indirect effect is estimated as the
product of
coefﬁcients
a and
b derived
from
2
regression models, the ﬁrst regressing EAA on BMI
AUC and adjusting for covariables and the latter
regressing of cIMT on EAA after controlling for BMI
AUC
and
covariables.
Two
sets
of
covariables
measured simultaneously with EAA were included in
the
mediation
analyses.
Covariables
in
model
1
included age, sex, race, and model 2 further included
smoking and drinking. Prior to conducting the medi-
ation analyses, continuous variables were standard-
ized using Z-transformation. The mediation effect
was estimated as the percentage of the contribution
of the indirect effect to the total effect, with statisti-
cal
signiﬁcance
determined
using
the
bootstrap
method with 1,000 bootstrap iterations.36 The anal-

DESCRIPTION OF PARTICIPANTS. Table 1 describes
the characteristics of the 1,580 BHS participants at
their baseline and most recently completed study
visits. Among this biracial cohort, 43.8% were male
and 32.9% were African American. With a median
follow-up of 38.8 (Q1, Q3: 34.9, 40.8) years, the mean
ages at baseline, the 2004-2006, 2008-2010, and 2013-
2016 study visits were 9.7, 39.5, 43.5, and 48.2 years,
respectively. As expected, BMI, SBP, DBP, LDL-C,
TGs, and glucose were higher in the 3 midlife visits
compared to the baseline visit. In this population,
EAA variability was substantial, with each SD increase
corresponding to an absolute increase of 4-5 years in
accelerated aging across measures of midlife visits.
On average, cIMT were 0.8 mm, 0.7 mm, and 0.9 mm,

ASSOCIATION OF EARLY LIFE CVD RISK FACTORS
AND EAA. Associations between childhood CVD risk
factor AUCs and adulthood EAA are shown in Figure 3
and Supplemental Table 1. Childhood BMI demon-
strated signiﬁcant or nominally signiﬁcant associa-
tions with all measures of EAA. For example, in the
fully adjusted model (model 2), each SD increase in
early
life
BMI
AUC
was
associated
with
0.27
(P ¼ 5.402  103), 0.63 (P ¼ 2.624  107), 0.88
(P ¼ 6.062  1011), and 0.52 (P ¼ 3.196  107) years
increased IEAA, EEAA, PhenoAgeAccel, and GrimA-
geAccel, respectively. Early life log-transformed TG
AUC consistently associated with both PhenoAgeAccel
and GrimAgeAccel across models, with each SD incre-
ment increase conferring a respective 0.50 (P ¼ 5.506 
104) and 0.43 (P ¼ 9.269  105) year increase in the
EAA measures. Likewise, early SBP AUC was associ-
ated with IEAA (0.27; P ¼ 6.498  103) and PhenoA-
geAccel (0.52; P ¼ 1.216  104), and each SD increase in
early HDL-C was associated with 0.32 (P ¼ 2.125  103)
years decreased GrimAgeAccel in the fully adjusted
models. There were no consistent associations of early
life DBP, LDL-C, or glucose with adulthood EAA.
To further discern the temporal relationships of
BMI, SBP, TGs, and HDL-C with EAA, we carried out
cross-lagged panel analyses utilizing simultaneous
measurements of these variables collected at the 2
most distant time points in young adulthood through
midlife. The path coefﬁcients between selected CVD
risk factors and EAA are presented in Table 2. In the
fully
adjusted
model,

TGs, and HDL-C were not statistically signiﬁcant in
either of the models tested, providing no evidence of
EAA temporally preceding these measures. No sex-
based differences were present (data not shown).
Findings of sensitivity analyses restricting the cross-
lagged panel analyses to only those with EAA and
CVD risk factor measures at the 2 most recent study
visits (Supplemental Table 2) and adjusting for time
interval between study visits (Supplemental Table 3)
were consistent with those of the main analysis.
CROSS-SECTIONAL
ANALYSES
EXAMINING
ASSOCIATIONS OF EAA WITH cIMT AND CAROTID
PLAQUE. Associations of EAA with the continuous
and discrete measures of subclinical atherosclerosis
are shown in Supplemental Table 4. Our results
demonstrated strong and consistent associations of
EEAA, PhenoAgeAccel, and GrimAgeAccel with both
cIMT and carotid plaque in the BHS participants. For
example, each SD increase in EEAA, PhenoAgeAccel,
and GrimAgeAccel was cross-sectionally associated
with a 0.034 mm (P ¼ 1.660  105), 0.034 mm
(P ¼ 1.443  105), and 0.046 mm (P ¼ 1.031  106)
increase in cIMT, respectively, in the fully adjusted
model (model 2). Similarly, each SD increase in in
EEAA, PhenoAgeAccel, and GrimAgeAccel was cross-
sectionally associated with 1.26-fold (P ¼ 3.173 
104), 1.39-fold (P ¼ 2.540  107), and 1.49-fold
(P ¼ 6.902  108) higher odds of carotid plaque in
the fully adjusted model. There was no evidence of
associations between IEAA and either cIMT or ca-
rotid plaque.
MEDIATION ANALYSES. Prior to mediation analyses,
we
conﬁrmed
results
of
previous
studies,38-42
demonstrating signiﬁcant associations of childhood
BMI, BP, lipids, and glucose AUC with adulthood
cIMT in the BHS (Supplemental Table 5). The results
of analyses investigating the potentially mediating
effects of identiﬁed EAA measures on known associ-
ations of childhood BMI, TGs, and HDL-C with cIMT
are shown in Figure 4 and Supplemental Table 6. In
model 1, PhenoAgeAccel and GrimAgeAccel had sig-
niﬁcant mediation effects (P ¼ 0.014 and P ¼ 0.016,
respectively) on the associations between childhood
BMI and cIMT, with trends that were similar and
marginally signiﬁcant in model 2. PhenoAgeAccel was
identiﬁed as a signiﬁcant mediator of the association
between childhood TGs and cIMT (P ¼ 0.006) in
model 1 and remained signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.022) in model
2 (Supplemental Table 6). Mediation effects of EEAA
on BMI-cIMT associations of GrimAgeAccel on TG-
cIMT associations and of GrimAgeAccel on HDL-C-
cIMT were not observed in this small subsample.
DISCUSSION
In the current study examining the relation of indi-
vidual early life CVD risk factors with multiple mea-
sures of epigenetic aging, we found that increased
childhood
BMI,
SBP,
TGs,
and
HDL-C
predicted
accelerated epigenetic aging in adulthood. Further-
more, through the implementation of discrete time

structural equation models, our ﬁndings support
increased BMI, TGs, and HDL-C as upstream de-
terminants, rather than downstream consequences of
accelerated epigenetic aging. As expected, EAA mea-
sures were cross-sectionally associated with subclin-
ical atherosclerosis in the midlife BHS cohort. Further
analyses
demonstrated
that

effects
of
PhenoAgeAccel on the association of childhood TGs
and BMI with subclinical atherosclerosis in midlife. In
total, these ﬁndings provide temporal evidence of
EAA as a molecular footprint of adverse childhood
CVH, while further implicating EAA as a mechanism
linking early life CVD risk factors to later life sub-
clinical atherosclerosis.
Our work not only supports but expands on recent
ﬁndings from the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk
Development in Young Adults) study.23 In CARDIA,
Joyce et al
23 identiﬁed prospective associations

between a composite CVH score during young adult-
hood and GrimAgeAccel, with further evidence that
GrimAgeAccel mediated associations of CVH score
with subclinical atherosclerosis, as measured by cor-
onary artery calciﬁcation. We extend CARDIA’s ﬁnd-
ings to demonstrate that prospective associations of
clinical CVD risk factors with adulthood EAA can be
observed even earlier, starting in childhood. Further-
more, rather than examining a composite CVH score,
our study looked at individual CVD risk factors to
pinpoint the clinical measures that might be driving
CVH-EAA associations. Our analyses suggest that early
life BMI and TGs, but not BP and glucose, may be most
relevant in accelerating epigenetic aging across the life
course. Furthermore, our cross-lagged panel analyses,
which leveraged repeated simultaneously measured
CVD risk factors and EAA, provides temporal evidence
supporting CVD risk factors as upstream determinants
rather than consequences of EAA. Like CARDIA, EAA
measures in the BHS were also associated with sub-
clinical atherosclerosis, here measured as cIMT and
the discrete carotid plaque endpoint. Whereas power
was somewhat limited for our mediation analyses, our
ﬁndings suggest that measures of EAA may, in part,
link childhood BMI and TGs to subclinical atheroscle-
rosis in adulthood. In total, these ﬁndings continue to
highlight the relevance of early life CVD risk factors in
subclinical atherosclerosis, while pointing out speciﬁc
risk factors that might be pivotal in decelerating
epigenetic aging for the prevention of CVD.
Although we are among the ﬁrst to identify pro-
spective and temporal associations between early life
BMI and accelerated epigenetic aging in midlife,
several studies have reported cross-sectional associ-
ations of these 2 variables.43-47 For example, Quach
et al49 identiﬁed associations of EEAA and IEAA with
higher BMI among participants of the WHI (Women’s
Health Initiative). In one of the few longitudinal
studies in this area, Quach et al49 further examined
whether BMI at baseline predicted EEAA and IEAA
after 2.7 years follow-up among a small subsample of
participants of the InCHianti study (N ¼ 239). In
contrast
to
our
ﬁndings,
no
associations
were
observed.48 Given the small sample size and limited
follow-up time, it is unclear whether this study was
sufﬁciently powered for such analyses. Consistent
with our ﬁndings that suggest increased EAA as a
downstream consequence but not upstream deter-
minant of increased BMI, Simpkin et al49 found no
associations between EAA (measured at age 7) and
change in BMI through 17 years of age using models
with or without adjustment for cell counts. Overall,
our ﬁndings contribute additional information to the
growing evidence of an association between obesity
and epigenetic aging, providing compelling new data
that
implicate
obesity
as
precursor
to
this
phenomenon.
Our study also identiﬁed prospective and temporal
associations of early life TGs and HDL-C with EAA.
Like BMI, TGs have been associated with measures of

EAA in several cross-sectional studies,16,18,20,21,48,50
including the work of Quach et al48 in the WHI.
Furthermore, in a recent CARDIA study, Gao et al51
examined
associations
of
early
adulthood
lipid
levels
with
midlife
GrimAgeAccel.
Like
us,
they
identiﬁed strong associations between early life TGs
and HDL-C with midlife GrimAgeAccel, with their
analyses
focused
on
young
adulthood
TG
levels
compared to our focus on childhood.
As expected, increased EAA was associated with
subclinical atherosclerosis in our cross-sectional an-
alyses of BHS participants, including both cIMT and
carotid plaque. Numerous reports have identiﬁed
associations between EAA and measures of both
subclinical and clinical CVD.19,20,23,52-55 For example,
a 2018 report by Roetker et al19 identiﬁed baseline
cross-sectional associations between EAA and cIMT
among African American participants of the ARIC
(Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study. Like-
wise, analyses by Joyce et al23 suggested an associa-
tion
(and
mediating
effect)
of
GrimAgeAccel
on
coronary artery calciﬁcation in CARDIA participants.
In one of the only studies to investigate prospective
associations of EAA with clinical CVD events, the
ARIC study went on to demonstrate that each 5-year
increase in IEAA and EEAA was associated with,
respectively, 17% and 22% increased risks of fatal
coronary heart disease.19 In aggregate, we conﬁrm
previous associations and present new evidence for a
role of EAA in subclinical CVD in a rural cohort.
We identiﬁed a signiﬁcant mediating effect of EAA
on the relationship of increased early life TGs and
BMI with midlife subclinical atherosclerosis. We re-
ported the signiﬁcant mediation effects of both Phe-
noAgeAccel and GrimAgeAccel on the associations
between childhood BMI and midlife cIMT. To our
knowledge, only the previous study by Gao et al,51
which focused speciﬁcally on TGs and the GrimA-
geAccel measure alone, has investigated mediation of
EAA in CVD risk factor-subclinical (or -clinical) CVD
associations. In CARDIA, Gao et al51 showed that
GrimAgeAccel mediated 17% of the association be-
tween early life TGs and subclinical atherosclerosis.
Although this mediation was not signiﬁcant in the
current study, it is worth noting that the estimated
effect size was similar to that reported in CARDIA,
with a mediation effect of 16.8% in our most compa-
rable model. Given the smaller sample size of the
BHS, we may have been underpowered to detect this
signal. PhenoAgeAccel was identiﬁed as a signiﬁcant
mediator, explaining 27.4% of the association be-
tween childhood TGs with midlife cIMT in the BHS. In
total, our ﬁndings implicate EAA as a potential mo-
lecular link between early life CVD risk and the
development of subclinical disease in adulthood.
Given the small sample size for this analysis and
generally
marginally
signiﬁcant
signals,
despite
rather large mediation effect sizes, more research in
this area is warranted.
The associations of accelerated epigenetic aging
with CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD were not

homogeneous across measures. For instance, SBP
showed a signiﬁcant association with IEAA and Phe-
noAgeAccel, but no association was found with EEAA
or GrimAgeAccel. On the other hand, BMI exhibited
strong associations with all 4 EAAs. This was not all
together unexpected given a general lack of overlap
of methylation sites across the 4 different EAA mea-
sures.14,56-58 Furthermore, recent work by Liu et al56
demonstrated both similarities and differences in
the aging processes reﬂected across various measures
of EAA. For example, gene coexpression analyses
identiﬁed consistent enrichment across epigenetic
clocks for biological pathways,56 including immunity
and inﬂammation,59 chromatin modiﬁcation,60 and
autophagy.61 However, correlations with gene coex-
pression for these shared biological pathways varied
in magnitude across clocks.56 Furthermore, in vitro
experiments identiﬁed strong associations of Pheno-
Age but not other epigenetic clocks with mitochon-
drial
dysfunction
and
cellular
senescence,56
molecular mechanisms that may play key roles in
the development of CVD.62-68 In total, these ﬁndings
provide impetus for future work to integrate EAA
measures with other multiomics data, which might
reveal further molecular insights into the relation-
ships observed here.
Our study has several important strengths. The
unique longitudinal design of the BHS enabled a
unique investigation into the inﬂuence of childhood
CVD risk factors on EAA, as well as the potentially
mediating effect of this molecular footprint on sub-
clinical disease. By leveraging an average of 3-4
measures of CVD risk factors in childhood and up to 3
adulthood measures of EAA, our study was able to
powerfully and precisely investigate associations be-
tween early life CVD risk factors and epigenetic aging
in a biracial, rural cohort. Furthermore, the BHS
offered simultaneously collected measures of CVD
risk factors and EAA to more clearly articulate the
temporal relationship between these variables for the
ﬁrst time.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. Blood samples from childhood
were not available in BHS participants, so we could
not adjust for baseline EAA in our investigation of the
association between early life CVD risk factors and
midlife EAA. Likewise, whereas apolipoprotein B or
direct LDL measurements would offer greater accu-
racy in our analyses compared to relying on the
Friedewald equation for estimating LDL-C, particu-
larly in cases of hypertriglyceridemia, these data are
not available in the BHS.69 Furthermore, we note
caution in drawing conclusions regarding associa-
tions between HDL-C and subclinical CVD given null
associations observed in randomized clinical trials
and
Mendelian
randomization
studies.70
Because
only smaller subsamples had appropriate data avail-
able for the cross-lagged panel and mediation ana-
lyses, nonsigniﬁcant ﬁndings do not clearly suggest a
lack of association and could instead reﬂect a lack of
statistical power. Further research to investigate the
promising marginally signiﬁcant ﬁndings identiﬁed
here may be warranted.
CONCLUSIONS
Our study provides compelling early evidence that
accelerated epigenetic aging in adulthood is inﬂu-
enced by childhood BMI and TG levels. Furthermore,
our data suggest that EAA may mediate the associa-
tions of these childhood CVD risk factors and the
development of subclinical disease. In total, our
ﬁndings provide information on unique strategies
that might decelerate the biological aging process
early in life, while pointing to potentially modiﬁable
molecular mechanisms that could be targeted for
precision disease prevention across the life span.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: CVD re-
mains the leading cause of mortality globally. Evidence
suggests that CVD events are the consequence of a life-
long atherosclerotic process, starting with the develop-
ment of related risk factors during early life. Although the
associations of CVD risk factors with subclinical CVD have
been well established, the molecular mechanisms un-
derlying these relations remain an area of active investi-
gation. Improved mechanistic understanding is needed
for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that
might delay or even reverse the lifelong atherosclerotic
process. The past decade has given rise to an abundance
of epigenetic clocks, which are composed of DNAm sites
that accurately predict chronological age. Deviation of
chronological age from epigenetic clock age, termed EAA,
has been identiﬁed as a powerful biomarker of aging-
related disease and mortality. Although EAA might serve
as a molecular signature of childhood CVD risk factors and
further promote midlife subclinical CVD, few studies have
comprehensively examined these life course associations.
The current report comprehensively examines these as-
sociations, providing compelling early evidence that
accelerated epigenetic aging in adulthood is inﬂuenced by
childhood BMI and TG levels and might further mediate
the associations of these childhood CVD risk factors with
the development of subclinical disease.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: This study highlights
epigenetic age acceleration as a molecular signature of
suboptimal early life CVH that might promote midlife
subclinical disease. Further research is warranted to
explore the promising translational potential of this
research, which might include assessing interventions
targeting EAA to mitigate the risk of accelerated biolog-
ical aging and subsequent development of subclinical
atherosclerosis. Furthermore, investigating the down-
stream proteins and metabolites that inﬂuence EAA could
uncover additional novel therapeutic targets for pre-
venting or delaying the onset of CVD in later life.

EDITORIAL COMMENT
Early Life Cardiovascular Risk Factors and
Midlife Epigenetic Aging
An Enduring Legacy*
Paul S. de Vries, PHD,a Anthony S. Zannas, MD, PHDb,c
A
ging can be seen as a progressive deteriora-
tion of our physiological functions. Although
a person’s chronological age based simply on
their date of birth is a strong predictor of this process,
there can be interindividual differences in the speed
at which biological aging occurs. To capture such
interindividual differences, several composite epige-
netic markers have been developed that combine
the DNA methylation status of multiple sites across
the human genome to predict age-related traits. The
ﬁrst-generation measures of epigenetic aging, such
as the ones developed by Horvath1 and Hannum
et
al,2
were
derived
by
regression
models
that
merely predict chronological age, whereas second-
generation measures, such as the widely used Pheno-
Age and GrimAge, further predicted health span and
lifespan by including in their regression health and
mortality endpoints.3,4 For all these markers, the de-
gree to which epigenetic age outpaces chronological
age—that is, the individual’s “epigenetic age accelera-
tion”—is used as a measure of biological aging.
Following these developments, an exponentially
increasing number of studies have repeatedly found
associations between accelerated epigenetic aging
and a variety of age-related traits, independent of
chronological age.3 For example, studies have shown
cross-sectional associations between epigenetic age
acceleration and cardiovascular risk factors.5 Epige-
netic aging has also been associated with measures of
subclinical atherosclerosis and with risk of incident
clinical coronary heart disease.6 What has remained
understudied, however, is whether cardiovascular
risk factors early in life can result in enduring effects
on epigenetic age acceleration that are still detectable
later in life.
In this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science,
Sun et al7 provide novel insights into this research
gap. The investigators used the Bogalusa Heart Study,
a population-based, prospective cohort study that has
followed 1,580 participating children from 1973 on-
ward. They studied cardiovascular risk factors during
childhood in relation to epigenetic age acceleration in
midlife. They found that unfavorable metabolic pro-
ﬁles in childhood, including increased body mass in-
dex (BMI), systolic blood pressure, and triglycerides,
and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
predicted
midlife
epigenetic
age
acceleration,
as
measured with 3 of the 4 aforementioned markers
(Hannum,
PhenoAge,
GrimAge).
They
performed
cross-lagged panel analyses, a well-suited and so-
phisticated
approach
for
clarifying
temporal
re-
lationships, thereby providing evidence that BMI,
triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol are more likely to be determinants rather than
consequences of epigenetic age acceleration. The in-
vestigators further found that cardiovascular risk
factors during childhood were associated with carotid
intima media thickness, a measure of subclinical
atherosclerosis.
They
found
that
PhenoAge
and
GrimAge mediated up to 27% of the associations of
BMI and triglycerides with subclinical atheroscle-
rosis. Together these ﬁndings extend prior work and
suggest a temporal relationship and potential causal

pathway through which cardiovascular risk factors
early in life can exert enduring effects on epigenetic
aging, thereby contributing to atherosclerosis risk
later in life.
Although the study by Sun et al7 provides valuable
insights,
it
also
reveals
lingering
questions
that
should be clariﬁed by future research. First, although
the longitudinal design reduces the likelihood of
reverse
causation,
these
analyses
may
still
be
vulnerable to confounding. Orthogonal approaches
for causal inferences such as Mendelian randomiza-
tion for time-varying exposures could further support
and
clarify
the
underlying
causal
relationships.8
Second, it is unclear whether the observed associa-
tion and mediation is explained by an overall effect
on biological age or a more speciﬁc effect on epige-
netic age. This question is relevant because different
markers of biological aging have been suggested to
have independent or even additive effects on disease
risk.9 To better characterize such effects, future
studies should integrate epigenetic with other estab-
lished measures of biological age such as telomere
length and proteomic age. Finally, the investigators
used carotid intima media thickness as a measure of
subclinical atherosclerosis. Given that carotid intima
media thickness is not a particularly strong predictor
of
clinical
events,
it
would
be
worthwhile
to
demonstrate this same mediation by epigenetic age
acceleration with other measures of atherosclerosis
such as coronary artery calciﬁcation or harder end-
points of cardiovascular disease such as clinical cor-
onary heart disease events.
Keeping these unresolved questions in mind, the
ﬁndings from Sun et al7 underscore the importance of
preventing or ameliorating cardiovascular risk early
in life and may help guide health policies. Early
studies suggest that epigenetic aging can be modu-
lated by simple lifestyle interventions, such as diet
and exercise.10 Although the clinical beneﬁts of such
modulation remain to be determined, evidence to
date raises the intriguing possibility that epigenetic
aging can be leveraged as a biomarker to monitor
early interventions and promote health across the
lifespan.

SUMMARY
Using a translational approach with an ST-segment myocardial infarction (STEMI) cohort and mouse model of
myocardial infarction, we highlighted the role of the secreted IL-6 and MCP-1 cytokines and the STAT3 pathway
in heart macrophage recruitment and activation. Cardiac myocytes secrete IL-6 and MCP-1 in response to
hypoxic stress, leading to a recruitment and/or polarization of anti-inﬂammatory macrophages via the STAT3
pathway. In our preclinical model of myocardial infarction, neutralization of IL-6 and MCP-1 or STAT3 pathway
reduced infarct size. Together, our data demonstrate that anti-inﬂammatory macrophages can be deleterious in
the acute phase of STEMI. (J Am Coll Cardiol Basic Trans Science 2024;9:593–604) © 2024 The Authors.

espite
recent
advancements
in
post-myocardial
infarction
(MI)
care, many patients continue to
experience complications such as heart fail-
ure or stroke in the following years. MI has
reportedly
triggered
sterile
inﬂammation,
potentially contributing to adverse effects.
Circulating cytokines have been broadly studied for
their
potential
role
as
prognostic/diagnostic
bio-
markers post-MI1-4 because some of them, such as
interleukin (IL)-6 or monocyte chemoattractant pro-
tein (MCP)-1, have been demonstrated to be corre-
lated with worsening post-MI recovery.5-10
Encouraging outcomes have emerged using the
IL-6
receptor
inhibitor
tocilizumab,
exhibiting
improved myocardial salvage index in ST-segment
elevation MI (STEMI) patients,11 as well as attenu-
ated inﬂammatory response, primarily percutaneous
coronary
intervention
(PCI)-related
troponin-T
release
in
non-STEMI
patients.12
Despite
these
promising
results,
it
is
noteworthy
that
these
clinical
trials
targeted
the
IL6-receptor
rather
than directly addressing the cytokine IL-6 itself.
Thus, a comprehensive understanding of IL-6 and
MCP-1 roles in sterile inﬂammation occurring during
MI
is
imperative
for
optimizing
therapeutic
approaches.
In the context of MI, it is reported that IL-6 and
MCP-1
are
released
by
cardiac
ﬁbroblasts
or
by
resident,
as
well
as
circulating,
immune
cells,
whereas cardiomyocytes are mainly described to
release damage-associated molecular pattern mole-
cules.13 Although few studies have demonstrated the
secretion of IL-6 and MCP-1 by adult cardiomyocytes
(CMA) in normal conditions,14 only 1 study using
human atrial cardiomyocytes has shown IL-6 pro-
duction.15
However,
no
studies
under
hypoxia-
reoxygenation (HR) conditions have investigated the
secretion of IL-6 and MCP-1 by CMA. Both IL-6 and
MCP-1 are recognized for attracting leukocytes to
sites of damage or infection.16-18 Among the down-
stream signaling pathways activated by MCP-1 and IL-
6, the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (JAK/STAT3) pathway has been iden-
tiﬁed in nonischemic diseases19,20 and serves as a key
regulator of immune and inﬂammatory pathways.21
JAK/STAT3
signaling
has
also
been
described
to
drive the polarization of macrophages. However,
depending on the pathologies, either inhibition or
activation
of
this
pathway
increases
anti-
inﬂammatory polarization.22 Although a study on
rats demonstrated that the inhibition of JAK/STAT3
leads to anti-inﬂammatory macrophage polarization
in MI,23 the role of this signaling pathway must be
well understood. Macrophages’ polarization is usu-
ally described as undergoing dynamic changes after
reperfusion
in
MI,
transitioning
from
a
proin-
ﬂammatory phase in the early days to a subsequent

has
been
questioned
by
studies
reporting
that
macrophage inﬁltration can be advantageous and
deleterious depending on the kinetics of inﬁltration
and on the activation states.26,27
In this study, we investigated whether high levels
of IL-6 and MCP-1, along with the activation of their
respective downstream signaling pathways, orches-
trate macrophage recruitment and differentiation and
exacerbate MI injuries. Initially, we establish a cor-
relation between the circulating levels of IL-6 and
MCP-1 and the occurrence of major adverse cardio-
vascular events (MACE) such as all-cause mortality,
MI, hospitalization for heart failure or stroke within
the ﬁrst year post-STEMI. Using a murine model of MI
and an in vitro coculture model, we showed that
injured
cardiomyocytes
release
IL-6
and
MCP-1,
consequently triggering the recruitment and differ-
entiation of anti-inﬂammatory macrophages via the
STAT3 signaling pathway. Finally, our study demon-
strated that inhibiting IL-6/MCP-1/STAT3 pathways
reduced the population of anti-inﬂammatory macro-
phages and decreased the infarct size.
METHODS
A HUMAN COHORT OF STEMI PATIENTS. Sera sam-
ples from patients of a previously described HIBISCUS
cohort (coHort of patients to Identify Biological and
Imaging markerS of CardiovascUlar outcomes in ST
elevation myocardial infarction) was used.1 Brieﬂy,
239 patients were included with STEMI and under-
went coronary angiography with a subsequent pri-
mary PCI for revascularization. The primary endpoint
was all-cause of death, rehospitalization for heart
failure, recurrent infarction, and stroke. MACE was
assessed
within
the
12
months
after
the
index
hospitalization.
Clinical
follow-up
was
prospectively
recorded.
MCP-1 and IL-6 concentrations were quantiﬁed using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and
biochemical
analyses
(C-reactive
protein
and
troponin I) were performed at the Hospices Civil de
Lyon Laboratory. Further details are provided in the

MOUSE
CYTOKINES
QUANTIFICATION. Circulating
concentrations of IL-6 and MCP-1 in mouse sera
stored at 80C were quantiﬁed at different time
points using ELISA according to the manufacturers’
instructions (Invitrogen for IL-6 and R&D systems for
MCP-1). The minimum detectable concentration is
0.666 pg/mL for MCP-1 and 4 pg/mL for IL-6.
HEART mRNA QUANTIFICATION. Mice (n ¼ 8/group)
were randomly assigned to 2 groups: a control group
without ischemia (normoxia) and a second group
corresponding to IR 1 hour. At T ¼ 0 and T ¼ 1 hour,
mice were anesthetized and then euthanized. RNA
extracted from hearts were used to quantify the
expression
of
IL-6
and
MCP-1
(Supplemental
Methods).
IN
VITRO HR ON CMA. The HR sequence was per-
formed using a hypoxia incubator (Eppendorf Galaxy
48R). CMA were isolated from hearts as described in
the Supplemental Methods. CMA were then incu-
bated in 500 mL of hypoxia buffer (140 mmol/L NaCl,
5 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L HEPES,
2 mmol/L CaCl2) for 1.5 hours at 0.5% of oxygen.
Following hypoxia, reoxygenation was performed by
adding 1.5 mL of complete medium (DMEM F12, 10%
fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin). CMA
then were placed in a normoxic incubator for 24
hours, and the conditioned medium was collected
and directly frozen at 20C until use.

conditioned medium diluted to one-half in com-
plete medium for 24 hours. Macrophages were then
harvested, and the cell suspension was stained for

STATISTICS. Continuous human data are expressed
as median and 95% CI, median (IQR), or mean  SD
according to their distribution.
Within-group comparisons were performed using a
paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test, whereas
differences between groups used the Wilcoxon rank
sum test or unpaired t-test.
Kaplan-Meier methods (log-rank test) were used to
compare MACE between groups. Cox proportional
hazards models were used to obtain the HR and
95% CI for adjusted models predicting MACE.
For in vitro macrophage recruitment experiments,
2-way repeated measures analysis of variance with
Sidak’s post hoc test for multiple pairwise compari-
sons was performed. For in vitro macrophage activa-
tion
experiments
at
24
hours,
2-way
repeated
measures analysis of variance with Dunnett’s post

was
performed. Linear regression was used to evaluate
slope differences for infarct size. Statistical analyses
were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.01 (Graph-

signiﬁcant.
RESULTS
ELEVATED LEVELS OF IL-6 AND MCP-1 IN THE BLOOD
POSITIVELY
CORRELATE
TO
WORSE
OUTCOMES
AMONG STEMI PATIENTS. Supplemental Tables 1 and 2
provide an overview of the demographic character-
istics
of
the
study
population
(Supplemental
Appendix). The mean age was 59  12 years, and
79.5% of the cohort was composed of men. There
were 160 patients with TIMI ﬂow grades 0 or 1 at
admission (66.9%), and 231 had TIMI ﬂow grades $2
after PCI (96.7%).
We ﬁrst assessed the temporal variation of IL-6 and
MCP-1 concentrations in STEMI patients’ sera over
the
course of the ﬁrst
month. As illustrated in
Figure 1A, the IL-6 level reached a peak at 24 hours,
median value of 5.4 pg/mL (95% CI: 4.2-6.0 pg/mL),
compared with the admission level value of 1.2 pg/mL
(95% CI: 1.1-1.5 pg/mL; P < 0.001). Likewise, the
circulating
level
of
MCP-1
was
also
increased
(Figure 1B) compared with the admission level with a
median value of 77.1 pg/mL (95% CI 69-84.5 pg/mL;
P < 0.001 at 24 hours).
Across the entire cohort, a total of 32 patients
encountered MACE during the 12-month follow-up.
As shown in Figure 1C, patients who experienced
at least 1 adverse cardiac event within the 12-month
follow-up
period
exhibited
elevated
blood
IL-6
levels in their blood (median value of 6.3 pg/mL;
95% CI: 4.8-19 pg/mL) at 48 hours compared with
patients without clinical outcomes (median value of
3.7
pg/mL;
95%
CI:
3.1-4.3
pg/mL;
P
<
0.001).
Additionally,
blood MCP-1
levels were
higher
in
patients who experienced MACE (median value of
98.7 pg/mL; 95% CI: 77.6-120.4 pg/mL) at 24 hours
than in patients without MACE (median value at
74.0 pg/mL; 95% CI: 66.6-82.8 pg/mL) at 24 hours;
P ¼ 0.021 (Figure 1D).
When patients were dichotomized according to the
median value of IL-6 or MCP-1 concentration in blood
at 24 hours, patients with an IL-6 value above the
median had a signiﬁcantly larger infarct size and a
reduced left ventricular ejection fraction than those
with a low level of IL-6 (Supplemental Figures 1A
and 1B). Moreover, MCP-1 level was not associated
with signiﬁcant differences neither in infarct size
(Supplemental Figure 1C) nor in left ventricular ejec-
tion fraction (Supplemental Figure 1D).
As displayed in Figures 1E and 1F for IL-6 and
MCP-1, respectively, patients with IL-6 or MCP-1
levels that exceeded the median were observed to
more likely experience MACE over the 12 months’
follow-up
(unadjusted
HR:
2.3;
95%
CI:
1.1-4.8;
P ¼ 0.039 and unadjusted HR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.1-5.0;
P ¼ 0.027, respectively). With a Cox proportional
hazards model incorporating IL-6 and MCP-1 levels at
24 hours, we successfully illustrated that patients
with IL-6 or MCP-1 levels above the median were
more at risk of experiencing an adverse cardiac event
within the ensuing 2 years in contrast to patients with
a level under the median value (HR: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.6-
6.4; P ¼ 0.003) as shown in Figure 1G. In a multivar-
iable Cox regression model including age >65 years,
sex, troponin peak level, TIMI ﬂow grade >2 after PCI,
ischemic time, and anterior MI, IL-6þMCP-1 serum
level at 24 hours above the median value remained
associated with an increased risk of experiencing the
composite
HR
endpoint
during
the
follow-up
(adjusted HR: 5.3; 95% CI: 1.9-14.4; P ¼ 0.003).

Interestingly, the HR indicated that the combined
association of MCP-1 and Il-6 served as a better pre-
dictor
of
secondary
events
than
either
cytokine
considered independently, to a similar extent as the
troponin peak (Figure 1H).
Together, these results demonstrate that IL-6 and
MCP-1 levels collected at 24 hours after STEMI are
associated with worse clinical outcomes. However,
mechanistic explanations were lacking, prompting us
to utilize preclinical models of MI to address the
question.
TEMPORAL SERUM AND EXPRESSION PROFILES OF
IL-6 AND MCP-1 IN A MURINE MI MODEL. In a mouse
model
of
MI,
blood
samples
were
collected
at
different time points as displayed in Figure 2A.
Both IL-6 and MCP-1 median blood levels peaked 3
hours after reperfusion (373.7 pg/mL; Q1-Q3: 183.3-
624.5 pg/mL; P ¼ 0.001 and 46.6 pg/mL; Q1-Q3: 30.1-
107.8 pg/mL; P ¼ 0.001, respectively) when compared
with sham 0 control (Figures 2B and 2C).
Furthermore, both IL-6 and MCP-1 mRNA median
expression was signiﬁcantly increased in the ischemic
compared with the sham hearts (26.4; Q1-Q3: 11.0-
45.4 vs 0.04; Q1-Q3: 0.03-0.04; P < 0.001 and 26.0;
Q1-Q3: 15.4-36.0 vs 0.9; Q1-Q3: 0.8-1.9; P ¼ 0.011,
respectively) (Figures 2D and 2E).
IL-6 AND MCP-1 RELEASED BY INJURED CMA TRIGGER
MACROPHAGE RECRUITMENT AND DIFFERENTIATION
MACROPHAGES VIA ACTIVATING THE STAT3 SIGNALING
PATHWAY. Using an in vitro model of isolated CMA
subjected to HR sequence (Figure 2F), we observed an
increase
in
both
IL-6
(Figure
2G)
and
MCP-1
(Figure 2H) concentrations, quantiﬁed by ELISA, in
comparison to the normoxic condition (P < 0.010 for
IL-6 and P < 0.050 for MCP-1).
We
tested
whether
IL-6
and
MCP-1
could
trigger macrophage recruitment using conditioned
medium obtained from CMA exposed to 24 hours of
HR in vitro (Figure 3A). We speciﬁcally measured
the effect on pro- or anti-inﬂammatory macrophages
following
macrophages
phenotype
validation
by
ﬂow cytometry (Supplemental Figure 2A). As illus-
trated in Figure 3B, in vitro injured CMA preferen-
tially
recruited
anti-inﬂammatory
macrophages
(median 9,563 macrophages/mm2; Q1-Q3: 5,240-11,737
macrophages/mm2) compared with proinﬂammatory
macrophages (median 1,519 macrophages/mm2; Q1-
Q3: 52-2,250 macrophages/mm2; P < 0.001). This
effect was partially inhibited by neutralizing anti-
bodies against IL-6 or MCP-1. The IL-6 neutralizing
antibody
led
to
a
32.1%
reduction
of
anti-
inﬂammatory macrophage recruitment by CMA at 24
hours (Figure 3C), without impairing proinﬂammatory
macrophage recruitment (Supplemental Figure 2B).
Meanwhile, the MCP-1 neutralizing antibody led to a
44.2% reduction of anti-inﬂammatory macrophages
(P ¼ 0.002) and 29.8% reduction of proinﬂammatory
macrophages (P ¼ 0.005) (Figure 3D, Supplemental
Figure 2C). The inhibition of the STAT3 signaling
pathways by the STATTIC antagonist reduced anti-
inﬂammatory macrophage recruitment at 24 hours
(P ¼ 0.044) (Figure 3E), whereas it had no signiﬁcant
effect on proinﬂammatory macrophage recruitment
(Supplemental
Figure
2D).
These
results
suggest
that IL-6– and MCP-1–mediated anti-inﬂammatory
macrophage recruitment mostly relies on STAT3-
dependent pathways.
Subsequently, we treated naive macrophages (M0)
with conditioned medium obtained from injured
CMA with or without neutralizing antibodies (anti–
IL-6 and anti–MCP-1) or STATTIC (Figure 3F). The
conditioned medium speciﬁcally stimulated the dif-
ferentiation of anti-inﬂammatory (CD86, CD206þ)
macrophages compared with the control medium
(Figure 3G). This effect was slightly mitigated by the
presence
of
the
neutralizing
antibodies
(19.84%;
P ¼ 0.1316 for IL-6 and 11.3%; P ¼ 0.6611 for MCP-1).

REDUCING THE RECRUITMENT AND ACTIVATION OF
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY
MACROPHAGES
AT
THE
ONSET OF REPERFUSION DECREASED INFARCTION
SEVERITY. Combined
anti–IL-6
and
anti–MCP-1
neutralizing antibodies or STATTIC treatment were
injected 5 minutes before reperfusion. Infarct size
quantiﬁcation
was
performed
after
24
hours
of
reperfusion (Figure 4A). The distribution of infarct
size as a function of the area at risk was slightly, but
signiﬁcantly, decreased in the groups treated with
STATTIC or the combination of neutralizing anti-
bodies compared to control IR (P ¼ 0.0061 and
P ¼ 0.0081, respectively) (Figure 4B). Calculation of
the infarct size as a ratio of area of necrosis over area
at risk conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant effect of both STATTIC
and neutralizing antibody treatment; P ¼ 0.0148 and
P ¼ 0.0484, respectively (Figure 4C). These results
demonstrate
that
IL-6,
MCP-1,
and
the
STAT3
signaling pathway are involved in worsening reper-
fusion injuries.
The
isolation
of
immune
cells
from
area
at
risk from ischemic hearts provided further valida-
tion that the STATTIC treatment seems to increase
the
proportion
of
proinﬂammatory
macrophages
while efﬁciently decreasing the number of anti-
inﬂammatory macrophages (Figures 4D and 4E).
DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrates that IL-6 and MCP-1
blood levels positively correlate with worsened out-
comes in STEMI patients. This cytokine release at a
systemic level is partly due to the capacity of injured
CMA to release IL-6 and MCP-1 in the acute phase of
MI. Our study highlights the substantial contribution
of IL-6, MCP-1, and the STAT3 pathway in both the
recruitment and the activation of anti-inﬂammatory
macrophages. Consequently, our ﬁndings unveil an
unexpected perspective where rapid activation of
anti-inﬂammatory macrophages is detrimental in the
context of MI.
Indeed, 1 study9 has described that the time course
of 3.5 days induced considerable variability concern-
ing the kinetics we describe in the present study.
Within our investigation, we observed that the peak
of blood MCP-1 concentration occurred 24 hours post-
MI and reverted to its basal level after 48 hours. It is
worth noting that a single blood sampling within
these ﬁrst 3.5 days would have missed the variation in
MCP-1 level. However, this study has also described
that an elevated level of MCP-1 is associated with
MACE.
Only 1 translational study assessed MCP-1 levels in
both mice and 21 human MI samples.14 This study
showed that the heart produces MCP-1 in healthy
states and post-MI conditions. However, the in-
vestigators chose an animal model of permanent
ligation which, in the absence of reperfusion, was not
representative of STEMI patients.
Regarding IL-6, a canine model of MI showed up-
regulation
of
IL-6
mRNA
in
the
myocardium
following MI.30 In dobutamine stress echocardiogra-
phy, IL-6 has been associated with an increased risk
of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary
artery disease,31 and IL-6 is also correlated with he-
modynamic impairment after injection of dobut-
amine
in
patients
with
chronic
heart
failure.32
Elevated
IL-6
levels
have
been
described
in
unstable coronary artery disease and are associated
with an increased risk of cardiac events and mortal-
ity.33,34 Plasma levels of IL-6 was elevated after sur-
gery in pulmonary venous efﬂuents from 7 patients
immediately and after uncomplicated coronary artery
bypass grafting.35 These studies show the elevation of
IL-6 during a coronary artery disease.
The novelty of our study is presenting 5 sampling
times to obtain the kinetics for each cytokine. More-
over, the study considers only STEMI patients, not all
causes of coronary artery disease. We highlight that
the combined association of MCP-1 and Il-6 served as
a better predictor of secondary events than either
cytokine
considered
independently,
to
a
similar
extent as the troponin peak. Our methodology and
selected models enabled us to unravel the reasons
and consequences of the burst of IL-6 and MCP-1 in
STEMI patients.
Data from our in vitro model show that injured
CMA release IL-6 and MCP-1 in response to IR.
Although the primary characterization of CMA re-
volves around their contractile function, their role
in cytokine production remains poorly described. A
limited number of studies have shown that myo-
cytes can release IL-6,15,36 but none has investigated
this
mechanism
under
hypoxic
conditions.
Our
study is the ﬁrst to demonstrate that CMA secrete
both MCP-1 and IL-6 in response to an IR stress.
Besides, we show a synergistic interplay between
these 2 cytokines in terms of macrophage recruit-
ment and activation. Indeed, MCP-1, and to a lesser
extent IL-6, drives the recruitment of macrophages
by CMA. In parallel, IL-6 and STAT3 participate in
differentiating
anti-inﬂammatory
macrophages

CMA. Much like preceding studies, we could not
conﬁrm
STAT3
involvement
in
MCP-1–mediated
recruitment
of
anti-inﬂammatory
macrophages.
However, we successfully demonstrate its involve-
ment
in
the
polarization
of
macrophages,37-39
In vivo, our results reveal that STAT3 inhibition by
STATTIC proves comparably efﬁcacious to the dual
inhibition
achieved
by
anti–IL-6
and
anti–MCP-1
neutralizing antibodies. Consistent with our in vitro
results, the in vivo results indicate that the reduc-
tion of anti-inﬂammatory macrophages in the area
at risk is mainly attributed to the inhibition of the
IL-6/MCP-1/STAT3 pathways.
Surprisingly, our results challenge the conven-
tional notion that anti-inﬂammatory macrophages are
inherently beneﬁcial while proinﬂammatory ones are
deleterious. Instead, the kinetics of intervention are
likely the key. Indeed, it has been shown that a
decrease in proinﬂammatory macrophages, paralleled
by an increase of anti-inﬂammatory macrophages
6 days post-MI, reduced ﬁbrosis and increased cardiac
function.12 This may suggest a dynamic shift in the
role of the anti-inﬂammatory macrophages where
their function during early reperfusion phase differs
from their role during the subsequent remodeling
phase.
STUDY STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS. The strength
of the present study lies in its translational approach.
We have used a cohort of 239 well-characterized
STEMI patients with a clinical follow-up combined
with in vitro and in vivo preclinical models in mouse.
However, we can see some limitations in our study.
Even if we consider that the rate at 1 month for each
cytokine could indicate a reference close to basal
level, the study lacks a control population. Moreover,
the
phenotype
of
anti-inﬂammatory
macrophage
subtypes is complex and could beneﬁt from more
reﬁned characterization in future studies.
CONCLUSIONS
Our study demonstrates the signiﬁcance of timing
of therapeutic targeting as pivotal factors in the
success
of
clinical
studies
aiming
to
target
inﬂammatory processes. Furthermore, our experi-
mental ﬁndings propose that the simultaneous tar-
geting of
multiple
functions, encompassing
both
recruitment and differentiation, could yield syner-
gistic effects. These insights shed light on potential
avenues for reﬁning therapeutic strategies in the
context of inﬂammation-related interventions.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Targeting inﬂammation in
cardiovascular disease could pave a new way in therapeutic treatment, but a
better understanding of the phenomena remains necessary. Our present
study describes the early kinetics of 2 cytokines highly involved in MI
response: IL-6 and MCP-1. We demonstrate the highly dynamic release of
those 2 cytokines within the ﬁrst month post-STEMI. Elevated levels of IL-6
and MCP-1 24 hours post-admission are correlated to MACE. Using a pre-
clinical model of STEMI, we demonstrated that IL-6 and MCP-1 kinetics are
similar in mice. With our in vitro model, we show that cytokines are released
by injured cardiac myocytes and induce anti-inﬂammatory macrophage
recruitment and differentiation via the STAT3 signaling pathway. Counter-
intuitively, we demonstrate that this anti-inﬂammatory signaling in the
acute phase of MI can be deleterious, highlighting once more the
complexity of targeting inﬂammation in cardiovascular diseases.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Two important points for future clinical
trials can be highlighted in this study. First, the precise description of the
kinetics of IL-6 and MCP-1 can help in the design of future studies targeting
those cytokines to deﬁne the right time of treatment. Secondly, our pre-
clinical data suggest that synergistic approaches targeting several cytokines
could be of interest to improve treatment efﬁcacy.

n recent decades, there has been a progressive
understanding of the complex interplay between
cytokines
and
chemokines
released
after
an
acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and their prog-
nostic role during the post–myocardial infarction
(MI) period.1 The acknowledgment of inﬂammation’s
crucial role in prognosis has steered the scientiﬁc
community’s efforts toward identifying the optimal
target, potentially through inhibition, to mitigate
the extent of adverse outcomes resulting from inﬂam-
mation after an AMI.
Various
inﬂammatory
pathways
have
been
described to be used in the post-MI phase. From a
pathophysiology viewpoint, these pathways can be
separated into those acting via interleukin (IL)-6 and
those operating independently of it.2 IL-6 plays a
pivotal role in the inﬂammatory signaling implicated
in the initiation and progression of cardiovascular
disease. IL-6 orchestrates the recruitment of immune
cells to the damaged myocardium, while also stimu-
lating the production of acute-phase proteins such as
C-reactive
protein,
which
act
as
inﬂammation
markers. Furthermore, IL-6 inﬂuences the differen-
tiation
and
activation
of
immune
cells,
thereby
contributing to the inﬂammatory environment within
the infarcted tissue. Increased levels of IL-6 are
related to adverse clinical events following AMI,3
while
IL-6
inhibition
with
tocilizumab
has
been
correlated with improved myocardial salvage index in
patients with ST-segment elevation MI.4 Similarly,
monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, a che-
mokine released by cardiac ﬁbroblasts, contributes to
the recruitment of monocytes and macrophages to
the site of injury and promote inﬂammation. Of note,
an elevated baseline MCP-1 level is linked to tradi-
tional atherosclerosis risk factors and an elevated risk
for death or MI, regardless of baseline variables.5
One of the downstream pathways through which
IL-6/MCP-1 can act is the Janus kinase protein/signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
pathway. Janus kinase protein/STAT3 plays a multi-
faceted role in AMI. Following an AMI, STAT3 acti-
vation has been associated with both cardioprotective
and detrimental effects. On one hand, it can promote
cell survival, reduce apoptosis, and facilitate cardiac
repair
and
regeneration
after
injury.
However,
excessive STAT3 activation can contribute to adverse
cardiac remodeling, ﬁbrosis, and inﬂammation. The
intricate balance of STAT3 signaling in AMI suggests
its potential as a therapeutic target for modulating
postinfarction outcomes.6
In a study reported in this issue of JACC: Basic to
Translational Science, Paccalet et al,7 examined the
prognostic role of IL-6 and MCP-1 in patients with
ST-segment elevation MI, showing that the levels of
IL-6 and MCP-1 in the blood levels peak at 24 hours
and positively correlate to worse outcomes, respec-
tively. This knowledge might be already well recog-
nized, but the investigators went a step further; using
a murine model of MI and an in vitro coculture model,
they proved that the production of IL-6/MCP-1 by the
injured cardiomyocytes acts via the STAT3 pathway,
and this signaling pathway is involved in worsening
reperfusion injuries. The investigators found that the
use of IL-6-neutralizing antibody led to a 32.1%
reduction of anti-inﬂammatory macrophage recruit-
ment by cardiac myocytes at 24 hours post-MI,
without
impairing
proinﬂammatory
macrophage

recruitment. Likewise, the MCP-1-neutralizing anti-
body led to a 44.2% reduction of anti-inﬂammatory
macrophages (P ¼ 0.002) and a 29.8% reduction
of
proinﬂammatory
macrophages
(P
¼
0.005).
Furthermore, the inhibition of the STAT3 signaling
pathways by the STATTIC antagonist reduced anti-
inﬂammatory macrophage recruitment at 24 hours
post-MI (P ¼ 0.044), whereas it had no signiﬁcant
effect on proinﬂammatory macrophage recruitment.
The
investigators
conclude
that
these
results
suggest
that
IL-6-
and
MCP-1-mediated
anti-
inﬂammatory macrophage recruitment relies mostly
on STAT3-dependent pathways. Finally, they report
that reducing the recruitment and activation of anti-
inﬂammatory macrophages at the onset of reperfu-
sion, either by treatment with STATTIC or with the
combination of neutralizing antibodies, the severity
of
the
infarction
decreases
(P
¼
0.0061
and
P ¼ 0.0081, respectively).
The major advantage of this research is the use of
the translational nature of research, merging pre-
clinical and clinical studies. The investigators show
that this is probably one of the ways to improve the
translational aspect of research, as understanding the
underlying mechanism using a preclinical model
could massively accelerate therapeutic research. An
additional beneﬁt of this study compared with pre-
vious research is the examination of the secretion
kinetics of the 2 cytokines, IL-6 and MCP-1, at
5 different sampling times, with the last one at
1 month, which allowed temporal distance from the
acute event and a better understanding of these cy-
tokines’ secretion kinetics. Besides, the study dem-
onstrates that the combination of IL-6 and MCP-1 has
a more robust predictive power than either cytokine
alone. A limitation of the study is the absence of a
control group, while the complex phenotype of anti-
inﬂammatory
macrophage
subtypes
may
require
more reﬁned characterization in future studies.
Finally, the big question that arises with this study
is again the complexity of targeting inﬂammation in
cardiovascular diseases. The study results challenge
the traditional belief that anti-inﬂammatory macro-
phages are inherently advantageous, while proin-
ﬂammatory ones are harmful, showing the dynamic
shift in the role of the anti-inﬂammatory macro-
phages
whereby
their
function
during
the
early
reperfusion phase differs from their role during the
subsequent remodeling phase.
Undoubtedly, future areas of development remain,
and further investigations are necessary to address
unresolved inquiries. However, a signiﬁcant conclu-
sion from this study is that effectively targeting mo-
lecular inﬂammation mediators demands a thorough
comprehension of the dynamic inﬂammatory process
and the involvement of these mediators in its various
stages.
Despite
signiﬁcant
advances,
our
under-
standing of cardiac immunity remains incomplete,
highlighting
a
signiﬁcant
gap
in
achieving
safe
and effective treatments for
patients
with heart
inﬂammation.

SUMMARY
Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) face a high risk of cardiovascular disease. Previous studies reported
that endogenous thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) involves right ventricular remodeling and dysfunction. Here we show
that a murine model of CKD increased myocardial TSP1 expression and produced left ventricular hypertrophy,
ﬁbrosis, and dysfunction. TSP1 knockout mice were protected from these features. In vitro, indoxyl sulfate is
driving deleterious changes in cardiomyocyte through the TSP1. In patients with CKD, TSP1 and aryl hydrocarbon
receptor were both differentially expressed in the myocardium. Our ﬁndings summon large clinical studies
to conﬁrm the translational role of TSP1 in patients with CKD. (J Am Coll Cardiol Basic Trans Science

C
hronic kidney disease (CKD) is a
global public health problem that
signiﬁcantly shortens lifespan pri-
marily by increasing the risk of cardiovascu-
lar disease (CVD),1 particularly manifesting
as myocardial ischemia and/or heart failure
(HF). Patients with CKD are more likely to
die from CVD than progress to end-stage kid-
ney disease, with 50% of deaths due to car-
diac events.2 CKD resulting in chronic HF is
known as cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) type
43 and has been increasingly identiﬁed as a
marker of higher morbidity and mortality.1,4
Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and dia-
stolic
dysfunction
are
the
major
factors
contributing to development of heart failure
with
preserved
ejection
fraction
(HFpEF)
and sudden cardiac death through ischemia
and arrhythmia.5 A linear relationship be-
tween worsening glomerular ﬁltration rate
and LV function confers poor clinical out-
comes and the highest mortality.6,7
The molecular pathways that coordinate
pathophysiological
changes
and
develop-
ment
of
LVH
continue
to
expand
and
involve
mitogen-associated protein kinases ([MAPKs], espe-
cially
extracellular
signaling-related
kinase
[ERK]
1/2),8 oxidative stress, and the aryl hydrocarbon re-
ceptor (AhR).9 More recently, cardiac stress has been
shown
to
initiate
metabolic
alterations
in
car-
diomyocytes that promote senescence, leading to a
functional decline that includes hypertrophic growth,
b-galactosidase expression, and secretion of proin-
ﬂammatory
cytokines
(senescence-associated
secretory phenotype [SASP]).10 A growing body of
evidence
indicates
that
uremic
toxins
represent
important, nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors
in CKD because they have demonstrable cytotoxic
effects,11 are associated with cardiovascular mortal-
ity,12 and fail to be effectively cleared by dialysis,
particularly protein-bound subgroups such as indoxyl
sulfate (IS).13 IS is the best characterized toxin,
derived from dietary intake of the essential amino
acid tryptophan and converted to indole by the in-
testinal microbiome. In
the
absence
of
effective
tubular secretion, serum concentrations are >50
higher in CKD compared to healthy control subjects12
and are associated with LV dysfunction and cardio-
vascular mortality.12,14 Regression of LVH after kid-
ney transplantation and normalization of cardiac
parameters suggests that CKD-speciﬁc uremia is a
primary
driver
of
cardiac
pathology.15
Thrombo-
spondin 1 (TSP1) is a well-characterized extracellular
matrix
glycoprotein
secreted
by
cells.
However,
rather than providing structural integrity, it prefer-
entially regulates signaling pathways to alter cell
adhesion, proliferation, and viability in response to
injury.16 The cardiac extracellular matrix provides
scaffolding for cardiomyocyte attachment, ventricu-
lar geometry, and function, which regulates diastolic
performance and inﬂammation.17 We recently re-
ported induction of right ventricular TSP1 expression
in an animal model of pulmonary hypertension and
disruption of TSP1 signaling provided protection.18
Plasma TSP1 is elevated in patients with CKD;19
however, the protein did not appear to be derived
from ﬁbrotic renal parenchyma. Further work has

dialysis-dependent patients with CRS compared to
those without, and levels were predictive of cardio-
vascular mortality.14 However, little is known about
the
speciﬁc
effects
of
TSP1
on
the
LV
or
car-
diomyocytes in the context of CKD. We now implicate
TSP1 in a mouse model of CRS, where the hypertro-
phied LV is a signiﬁcant source of TSP1 expression,
accompanied by oxidative stress, ﬁbrosis, and SASP.
These ﬁndings were mitigated in thrombospondin-1
knockout (TSP1KO) mice. In vitro we demonstrate a
direct relationship of IS, induction of TSP1, and AhR
activation in cardiomyocytes that drives hypertrophy
and SASP, highlighting this pathway as a driver of
uremic cardiomyopathy.
METHODS
ANIMALS. TSP1KO (B6.129S2-Thbs1tm1Hyn/J) mice on a
C57BL/6J background (back-crossed for 15 genera-
tions) were originally purchased from the Jackson
Laboratory and were maintained by Australian Bio-
Resources. Age-matched (6-8 weeks) male littermate
control (wild-type [WT]) and (homozygous) TSP1KO
mice were transferred to Westmead Institute for
Medical
Research,
housed,
and
acclimatized
for
2 weeks in the biological facility under a 12-hour light/
dark cycle with access to standard chow and water ad
libitum under approved protocols (no. 4281 Western
Sydney Local Health District and no. 1594 University
of Sydney). All animal studies were performed in
accordance with the Australian code for the care and
use of animals for scientiﬁc purposes developed by
the National Health and Medical Research Council.
CRS MODEL USING 55/6NX. In this study, 156 mice
were used, including 98 WT mice and 58 TSP1KO mice
(Supplemental Table 1). Age-matched (8- to 10-week-
old) male mice were randomly assigned to sham and
5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx) groups. The 5/6Nx model is
characterized by high mortality.20 We altered the
conventional
method
of
nephrectomy,21
which
signiﬁcantly
reduced
mortality
to
10%
to
w15%
(Supplemental Figure 1A). Animals were anesthetized
with isoﬂurane and oxygen, the left kidney exposed
and exteriorized through a left ﬂank subcostal inci-
sion, and connective tissue and adrenal gland sepa-
rated by using normal saline-soaked cotton bud
instead of iris scissors to prevent the injury to renal
pedicle.21 The upper and lower renal poles were
removed using iris scissors. Hemostasis was achieved
with direct pressure, the kidney returned to the
abdomen, and the incision closed with 5/0 mono-
ﬁlament nylon. At day 8 following the initial surgery,
a right total nephrectomy was performed through a
separate ﬂank incision. In sham-operated mice, the
kidneys were exposed in 2 separate surgeries but not
resected, as described previously.19,21 Among 108
mice receiving 5/6Nx, 25 were euthanized (mostly on
the second postoperative day) owing to illness and/or
>25% body weight loss and were excluded from
analysis (Supplemental Table 1). Additional data were
also excluded in some experiments because of histo-
logical artifact, poor resolution of echocardiography
images, or an insufﬁcient quantity of serum/urine
specimens collected.
Body weight and blood pressure using the tail-cuff
plethysmography
(CODA
machine, Kent Scientiﬁc
Corporation) were measured weekly.21 In some ex-
periments, mice were euthanized at week 2 or 6, and
tissues were harvested as illustrated in the study
design (Supplemental Figure 1B). Metabolic caging
was performed at week 10 before transferring to
Sydney Imaging Facility at the Charles Perkins Centre
for an additional 2 weeks of acclimatization and
echocardiography. At week 12, echocardiography was
performed
(Vevo
2100
Echocardiography
Imaging
System, VisualSonics), and then mice were eutha-
nized. Heart and wet lung weights were recorded
along
with
tibial
length.
Organs,
plasma,
and
urine were then processed for analysis and stored
at 80
C. The estimated percentage of removed
kidney was calculated by following formula: per-
centage of removed kidney ¼ weight of excised kid-
neys (left excised kidney þ right kidney)  100 / total
weight of 2 kidneys (left excised þ left remnant þ
right kidney), as described in our recent report.21
ASSESSMENT OF RENAL FUNCTION AND PROTEINURIA.
Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, alkaline phos-
phatase, serum calcium, urinary protein, and creati-
nine were determined using the Siemens Atellica
System (Westmead Hospital).
ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY. Mouse
plasma IS was measured by enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay according to manufacturer protocol
(#MBS720905, MyBioSource, Inc). Brieﬂy, kit contents
and samples were brought to room temperature. One
hundred microliters (100 mL) of IS standards or sam-
ples were added to the enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay plate in duplicate and incubated at 37 C
for 1 hour. The plate was washed 5 with buffer,
followed by the addition of conjugate and incubation
at 37 C for 20 minutes. Following addition of stop
solution, the plate was read at 450 nm.
HIGH-FREQUENCY ULTRASOUND ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY.
Animals were assessed at week 12 under general
anesthesia induced with isoﬂurane and O2 titrated to
effect. Animals were placed supine on an adjustable
stage with the tail of the animal facing toward

the operator and limbs secured to electrocardiogram
probes. The Vevo2100 ultrasound system (Visual-
Sonics) and linear transducer (MS550D, MicroScan, 40
MHz, VisualSonics) were used to acquire LV para-
sternal
long-axis
B-mode/echocardiogram-gated
kilohertz visualization images and short-axis mid-
papillary
echocardiogram-gated
kilohertz
visualization/M-mode images. Pulse-wave and tissue
Doppler images were obtained in apical 4-chamber
view using a linear transducer 57 MHz (VevoF2, Vis-
ualSonics) as previously described.22 All images were
acquired by an operator blinded to the treatment
group.
Short-axis
mid-papillary
M-mode
analyses
(Supplemental Figure 1C) were carried by selecting
autoLV from 3 cycles of each cine loop. Pulse-wave
and tissue Doppler images (Supplemental Figures 1D
and 1E) analyses were carried out to measure dia-
stolic (dys)function. VevoLAB software (VisualSonics)
was used for data analysis, and average data from 3
cine loops are presented for each mouse.
HEART
HISTOPATHOLOGY. Formalin-ﬁxed
kidney
and heart tissue embedded in parafﬁn were sectioned
at 4 mm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or
picrosirius red using standard methods.19,21 Slides
were viewed under brightﬁeld conditions. Picrosirius
red staining area and intensity were measured and
quantiﬁed
using
ImageJ
(National
Institutes
of
Health) as previously described.19 Picrosirius red
stained images (magniﬁed 80) were also used to
measure the cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes
using
ImageJ.
Assessors
were

to
treat-
ment groups.
CELL
CULTURE. Human
primary
cardiomyocytes
(PromoCell) were subcultured according to manufac-
turer’s instructions. Cells were used at passages 3-6.
Cells at w70% conﬂuency in 6-well plates were
treated
with
recombinant
human
TSP1
(Athens
Research and Technology), IS (Sigma Aldrich) for 24
hours. In some experiments, cells were pretreated
with anti-TSP1 (#ab85762) and sarcomeric (#ab68167)
antibodies were from Abcam at 1 mg/mL or mouse
immunoglobulin G1 isotype control (#02-6100, Invi-
trogen) prior to treatment. For small interfering RNA
(siRNA) experiments, cells were plated in media

50%-60% conﬂuence using Lipofectamine 2000 and
TSP1 or control siRNA (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Cells were exposed to siRNA for
48 hours prior to experimental use.
Human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (Clo-
netics, Lonza) were used in subsequent experimental
work owing to the unavailability of human car-
diomyocytes
(HCMs)
in
Australia.
Human
aortic
vascular smooth muscle cells were subcultured ac-
cording to manufacturer’s instructions to detect the
involvement of AhR in IS-induced TSP1 expression.
Cells were used among passages 3-6. For this experi-
ment,
cells
were
pretreated
with
AhR
inhibitor
(StemRegenin 1, ab142174, Abcam) (10 mmol/L) for 2
hours and then treated with IS (10 mmol/L) for 24
hours.
Human
cardiac
ﬁbroblasts

were
sub-
cultured according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells were used among passages 4-8. Cells at w70%
conﬂuency were treated with recombinant human
TSP1 (Athens Research and Technology) for 24 hours.
Cell viability and senescence assays. Cell meta-
bolic activity was measured using a XTT Cell Viability
Kit (Cell Signaling Technology), and senescence was
assessed with a Mammalian b-Galactosidase Assay Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Brieﬂy, 104 cells/well were
seeded into a 96-well microplate. Serum-starved cells
were treated with TSP1 (0.2-10.0 nmol/L) or IS (1-
500 mmol/L) for 48 hours. Cell proliferation and
senescence were determined at the 450 nm and
405 nm, respectively, using Proteomics SpectraMax
iD5 Plate Reader (VWR International).
Cells were stained using a Senescence-b-Galacto-
sidase Staining Kit (Cell Signaling Technology) ac-
cording to manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were
then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and im-

HUMAN
DATA. The
raw
expression
data
were
accessed form the Gene Expression Omnibus using
the accession code GSE160145 and imported into R
version 4.2.0 (R Foundation).26 The raw reads were
normalized using DESeq’s Median of Ratios method
and variance stabilization transformation performed
using the DESeq2 package in R. Differential genes
were identiﬁed between patients listed with CKD and
healthy patients. Genes with a log-fold change >2,
and an adjusted P < 0.05 using the Benjamini-
Hochberg false discovery rate were determined to be
differentially expressed. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test
was used to identify enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes pathways27 between healthy and
patients with CKD. Gene Set Enrichment Analyses
was executed using the clusterProﬁler package in R28
on the list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
between healthy and patients with CKD using Gene
Ontology pathway database.29 Data used for this
study are publicly available using the Gene Expres-
sion Omnibus accession code listed. The code used to
generate analysis and ﬁgures is available online.30 No
other clinical data or demographics were available for
this patient cohort.
HUMAN PLASMA TSP1 AND ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY
CORRELATION. The study was approved by the Hu-
man Research Ethics Committee of Western Sydney
Local Health District (HREC LNR/12/WMEAD/114 and
LNRSSA/12/WMEAD/117
[3503]).
In
brief,
patients
were recruited from nephrology outpatient clinics at
Westmead Hospital and did not have an intercurrent
illness. All subjects were previously recruited, and
their plasma TSP1 levels were measured and pub-
lished.19
Patients
with
echocardiography
studies
within 3 months of venopuncture and not associated
with acute illness or cardiovascular deterioration
were used for analysis.
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS. Statistical analyses were
performed using GraphPad Prism software (version
10.0.3; GraphPad Software Inc). Data are presented as
mean  SD or median (25th, 75th percentiles) (box
plot) dependent on data distribution. Between-group
comparisons used unpaired Student’s t-test or Wil-
coxon rank-sum test, whereas within-group compar-
isons used paired Student’s t-tests. One- or 2-way
analysis of variance was used to compare >2 groups
with Sidak’s or Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple
pairwise comparisons. Spearman’s correlation coefﬁ-
cient (r) was used to evaluate the association of 2
continuous variables as determined through linear
regression. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to pre-
sent survival curves with groups compared using the
log-rank test. A value of P < 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.
RESULTS
DEVELOPMENT OF EQUIVALENT CKD IN WT AND
TSP1KO MICE. A 5/6Nx model recapitulates features
of CKD and induces cardiac remodeling. Removal of
70%-80% of total kidney mass at multiple time points
(Figure 1A) demonstrated reduced body weight in
WT- and TSP1KO-5/6Nx mice compared to sham-
operated control mice, although weight reduction
was
less
in
TSP1KO-5/6Nx
mice
compared
to
WT-5/6Nx mice (Figure 1B). Acute elevation of serum
urea and creatinine was seen at 2 weeks post-5/6Nx
(Figures 1C and 1D), which reduced with time. Serum
urea, serum creatinine, polyuria, and decreased urine
creatinine/plasma creatinine ratio was equivalent in
both genotypes post-5/6Nx (Figures 1C to 1E). TSP1 is a
well-recognized activator of oxidative stress,23 but

there were no differences in reactive oxygen species
in the remnant kidney of WT- and TSP1KO-5/6Nx
mice (Figure 1F). Photomicrographs of the remnant
kidney over time are demonstrated in Figure 1G. At
12 weeks following 5/6Nx, the renal parenchyma
demonstrated ﬁbrosis and tubular atrophy in addition
to changes in glomerular morphology that included
tuft shrinkage and glomerulosclerosis in both geno-
types (Figure 1G). Plasma TSP1 was up-regulated only
in WT-5/6Nx mice (Figure 1H). As expected, plasma IS
was up-regulated in WT-5/6Nx and TSP1KO-5/6Nx
mice compared to WT-sham and TSP1KO-sham mice,
respectively (Figure 1I).
GENETIC DISRUPTION OF TSP1 SIGNALING LIMITS
CARDIAC PATHOLOGY IN A MOUSE MODEL OF CRS.
Given equivalent renal dysfunction between WT- and
TSP1KO-5/6Nx mice, we then explored changes in
cardiac phenotype. Representative sections demon-
strated LVH (Figure 2A) and increased cardiomyocyte
cross-sectional
area
only
in
WT-5/6Nx
mice
(Figure 2B, Supplemental Figure 2A), accompanied by
increased heart weight (compared to tibial length)
(Supplemental Figure 2B). Perivascular and intersti-
tial ﬁbrosis was demonstrated in WT-5/6Nx hearts
(Figure 2C), which was corroborated by signiﬁcantly
elevated collagen I, ﬁbronectin, a-smooth muscle
actin, and transforming growth factor-b (Figure 2D).
LVH and ﬁbrosis were abrogated in TSP1KO-5/6Nx
hearts.
Immunohistochemical
staining
revealed
marked myocardial TSP1 expression, localized to the
cardiomyocytes and interstitial, vascular, and peri-
vascular spaces only in WT-5/6Nx mice (Figure 2E,
Supplemental Figure 2C), conﬁrmed by quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (Figure 2F) and Western
blotting (Figure 2G) of LV tissue.
TSP1 IS REQUIRED TO PROMOTE LVH, DIASTOLIC
DYSFUNCTION, AND SENESCENCE IN MICE WITH
CRS. Systolic
and
diastolic
pressure
and
mean
arterial pressure and heart rate were not statistically
signiﬁcantly lower in TSP1KO mice compared to WT
mice (Figure 3A, Supplemental Figure 2D). Echocar-
diography performed at week 12 conﬁrmed the his-
tological evidence of LVH, with increased EF and
fractional shortening exclusively in WT-5/6Nx mice
(Figure 3B, Supplemental Figure 2E). Consistent with
previous
reporting,31
this
was
accompanied
by
decreased LV systolic internal diameter and systolic
volume (Supplemental Figure 2F). LV diastolic inter-
nal diameter and volume were preserved in TSP1KO-
5/6Nx mice (Supplemental Figure 2G).
Diastolic dysfunction frequently correlates with
heightened interstitial ﬁbrosis, concentric hypertro-
phy, and atrial enlargement. The early ﬂow velocity
(E) of the mitral valve exhibited no signiﬁcant vari-
ance among the groups (Supplemental Figure 3A).
Doppler assessment of LV ﬁlling velocity, determined
by the ratio of early (E) to late (A) diastolic transmitral
Doppler
ﬂow
velocities
(E/A),
and
isovolumetric
relaxation time was signiﬁcantly increased in WT-5/
6Nx mice compared to sham-operated mice, but not
in TSP1KO-5/6Nx mice (Figure 3C).
The septal mitral annular velocity (e0) demon-
strated a signiﬁcant reduction in WT-5/6Nx, TSP1KO
sham, and TSP1KO-5/6Nx mice when compared to
WT-sham mice (Supplemental Figure 3B). Moreover,
the E/e0 ratio was signiﬁcantly increased solely in WT-
5/6Nx mice (Figure 3C), indicating the onset of dia-
stolic dysfunction, with no such elevation observed
in TSP1KO-5/6Nx mice. Furthermore, lung weight was
increased in WT-5/6Nx mice (Figure 3D), which is
suggestive of increased lung congestion and HFpEF.
LVH increases cardiomyocyte contractile machin-
ery32 that is governed by overexpression of MHC and
a-actinin, which provide adenosine triphosphate hy-
drolysis33 and anchor actin ﬁlaments to the sarco-
meric
Z-disk,34
respectively.

LV tissue demonstrated signiﬁcantly greater oxida-
tive stress in the form of H2O2, which was mitigated in
TSP1KO-5/6Nx tissue; superoxide moiety measure-
ments were equivalent (Figure 4A). Tissue nonspeciﬁc
alkaline phosphatase is associated with systemic
inﬂammation37 and positively correlates with car-
diovascular events.38 WT-5/6Nx mice demonstrated
elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, which was
abrogated in TSP1KO-5/6Nx animals (Figure 4B). His-
tologic examination also revealed areas of hetero-
topic
ossiﬁcation
only
seen
in
WT-5/6Nx
hearts
(Supplemental Figure 3E).
Reactive oxygen species and inﬂammation activate
a broad variety of hypertrophy signaling kinases,39
including MAPK signaling cascades, which are cen-
tral regulators of pathological LVH.40 MAPK ERK is
also linked to TSP1 activity and H2O2availability.41
pERK
expression
was
up-regulated
only
in
WT-
5/6Nx
hearts
(Figure
4C).
To
demonstrate
that
this effect could be replicated in vitro, we incu-
bated HCMs with IS or TSP1, and both up-regulated
pERK (Figures 4D and 4E), which was mitigated
with anti–thrombospondin 1 antibody ([aTSP1Ab],
which demonstrates direct inhibitory42 and steric
hindrance43
effects
on

activity)
or
siRNA
(Figures 4F and 4G). These data suggest that the effect
of IS was dependent on intact TSP1 signaling.
CRS IS ASSOCIATED WITH AhR ACTIVATION. IS is a
ligand and potent agonist of AhR, and this interaction
is clinically relevant in CKD44 because it regulates the
cell cycle and responsiveness to oxidative stress.45
AhR regulates TSP1 gene promoter activity,46 and
MAPK activation has also been shown to facilitate
AhR activity,47 suggesting bidirectional potentiation
of signaling. Immunohistochemical staining revealed

activation
in
WT-5/6Nx
hearts, which was mitigated in TSP1KO-5/6Nx hearts
(Figure 5A). IS and TSP1 were both capable of up-
regulating AhR activation in HCMs (Figure 5B), and
IS-induced AhR activation was mitigated by TSP1
siRNA (Figure 5C). Human vascular smooth muscle
cells
exposed to
an
AhR
inhibitor
demonstrated
reduced TSP1 expression, even when concurrently
treated with IS (Supplemental Figure 4A), supporting
the notion that AhR is required for TSP1 activation.
The proinﬂammatory cytokine proﬁle characteristic
of SASP remained intact with induction of TNF-a,
interleukin-6, interleukin-1b, and CCL2 with IS, but
this was limited in the presence of AhR inhibitors
(Supplemental Figure 4B).
IS INDUCES CARDIOMYOCYTE HYPERTROPHY AND
SASP MEDIATED BY TSP1. Our global KO mouse did
not distinguish which cells were driving LVH in CRS;
however, we initially focused on pathologic signaling
within cardiomyocytes. We evaluated the response of
HCMs to IS and TSP1, demonstrating up-regulation of
TSP1 in response to both (Figure 6A, Supplemental
Figure 5A) at concentrations found in patients with
CKD.48 A positive feedback loop in response to
exogenous
TSP1
is
counterintuitive
to
cellular
response to injury, but this remains a robust obser-
vation in other cell types.18,49 IS-mediated induction
of TSP1 was limited by TSP1 siRNA and aTSP1Ab at
protein (Figure 6B) and transcript levels (Figure 6C).
Similar to our in vivo ﬁndings, a-actinin expression
increased with exogenous IS (Figure 6D) or TSP1
(Supplemental Figure 5B), and the response was
decreased by TSP1 siRNA or aTSP1Ab (Figure 6E).
Morphometric analysis revealed signiﬁcant increases
in HCM surface area in response to TSP1 or IS, and
effect of IS was again mitigated with TSP1 siRNA
(Figure 6F). TSP1, but not IS, signiﬁcantly increases
the messenger level of atrial and brain natriuretic
peptides in HCMs (Figure 6G).
IS
down-regulated
HCM
metabolic
activity
(measured via MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-
diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] incorporation) at
all concentrations (Figure 7A), and TSP1 demonstrated
an effect at 2.2 nmol/L (Figure 7B). TSP1 siRNA treat-
ment reduced IS-induced effects (Figure 7C). Limited
synthetic capability reﬂects cellular senescence, and
prematurely senescent cardiomyocytes accumulate in
cardiomyopathies,50 becoming pathogenic by intro-
ducing chronic inﬂammation (also known as SASP).
HCM senescence in the context of uremic toxins has
not been previously explored. IS (Figure 7D) and TSP1
(Figure
7E)
signiﬁcantly
increased
senescence-
associated b-galactosidase in HCMs, and the effect
was abrogated by siRNA (Figure 7F) or aTSP1Ab
(Figure 7G). Messenger RNA levels of interleukin-6
and -1b, TNF-a, and CCL2 were increased following
incubation with IS (Figure 7H) and decreased when
cells were pretreated with aTSP1Ab.
We also investigated the effect of TSP1 on human
cardiac ﬁbroblasts, demonstrating a small, but sig-
niﬁcant decreased MTT incorporation (Supplemental
Figure 6A) and increased senescence (Supplemental
Figure 6B).
TSP1 AND AhR ARE RELEVANT IN HUMAN CRS. We
have previously published that plasma TSP1 levels
inversely correlate with estimated glomerular ﬁltra-
tion rate.19 Analysis of a subgroup of these patients
(Supplemental Table

demonstrated an inverse
relationship between plasma TSP1 and LVEF, as well
as a direct correlation between plasma TSP1 and LV
mass index (Figure 8A). There was no signiﬁcant
correlation
between
plasma

from

dependent patients with CRS. The principal compo-
nent analysis is shown in Supplemental Figure 7B.
TSP1 and AhR gene expression was signiﬁcantly up-
regulated in patients with CKD compared to healthy
control subjects (Figure 8B). DEGs between healthy
and CRS hearts, including TSP1 and AhR, were iden-
tiﬁed in a volcano plot (Figure 8C). A heatmap from a
subset of CRS patients also demonstrates the distri-
bution of DEGs (Supplemental Figure 7C). The top 12
DEGs in CRS hearts are listed in Supplemental Table 3.
A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed on candi-
date DEGs to establish enriched pathways in the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database
(Figure 8D). DEGs were predominantly enriched in
cytokine- and ECM-receptor interactions, as well as
p53 signaling. Gene set enrichment analysis was also
used to determine enriched pathways within the
Gene Ontology database (Supplemental Figure 7D),

DISCUSSION
The
excess
burden
of
cardiac
disease
in
renal
impairment is well established, and patients experi-
ence morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular
events rather than renal failure per se.1 Uremia-
speciﬁc toxins, particularly IS, are involved in the
pathogenesis of CRS, and here we show, for the ﬁrst
time, that the matrix protein TSP1 is necessary to
drive cardiac pathology. In vivo, WT mice subject to
5/6Nx demonstrated LVH, diastolic dysfunction, up-
regulated myocardial TSP1 and AhR expression, mal-
adaptive oxidative stress, SASP, and ﬁbrosis. TSP1KO
mice were protected from cardiac pathology despite
equivalent renal dysfunction. Our in vitro results
demonstrated that IS, through TSP1, promoted car-
diomyocyte hypertrophy and SASP with activation of
ERK and up-regulated AhR. Importantly, blockade of
TSP1
signaling
reversed
abnormal
cardiomyocyte
ﬁndings associated with IS exposure. Analysis of an
independent RNA-sequencing data set from explan-
ted human hearts showed increased expression of
TSP1
and
AhR
in
samples
with
CRS
patients
(compared to healthy control subjects). Differential
gene expression analysis in CRS hearts were linked
with cytokine, extracellular matrix, and p53 signaling
pathways, which we identiﬁed as relevant signaling
pathways in vivo and in vitro. We believe these data
uncover a novel mechanism that implicates TSP1 as a
driver of LVH, positioning it as a potential biomarker
of
disease
and
a
prospective
target
for
clinical
intervention.
Our ﬁndings are clinically relevant: we have pre-
viously
published
that
plasma
TSP1
correlated
inversely with estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate.19
We extended these ﬁndings to demonstrate correla-
tion with both reduced EF and increased LV mass.
Large cohort studies have previously published that
patients with CKD can present with HFpEF or HF with
reduced EF, and similar relationships were observed
for estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate and protein-
uria in terms of all-cause hospitalization regardless of
EF.51,52
There
are
also
reports
of
bimodal
pre-
sentations of EF in CKD patient populations with an
increased prevalence of HFpEF.52,53 Consistent with a
recent report,54 we observed diastolic dysfunction
and markers of HFpEF only in WT-5/6Nx mice, which
might be a function of animal age (<6 months old),

genotype
(C57BL/6
background),
diet
(standard
chow), and duration of CKD (12 weeks). Other fea-
tures, including impaired exercise capacity caused by
skeletal muscle weakness, malnutrition (failure to
gain weight), inﬂammation, and dehydration (due to
polyuria),55,56 may be additional confounding factors,
and these require further investigation.
TSP1
is
a
matrix
glycoprotein
produced
by
numerous cell types18,25,57 that activates transforming
growth factor-b to induce ﬁbrosis,57 limits cellular
proliferation,49 increases redox stress,25 and pro-
motes inﬂammatory responses,58 all of which we
demonstrate in the cardiac pathology of our murine
CRS model. In this study, we also establish that TSP1
is upstream of ERK1/2 activation and AhR (with likely
bidirectional signaling), which are complicit in the
development of SASP and cardiac dysfunction. Our
use of a global TSP1KO mouse did not deﬁne the cell
type responsible for TSP1 secretion, although we
focused on cardiomyocyte phenotype in vitro. How-
ever, all nucleated cells produce TSP1 in response to
external stressors59 (eg, hypoxia, inﬂammation, hy-
perglycemia), and it may be that paracrine signaling,
particularly
SASP-derived
products,10
among
car-
diomyocytes,
ﬁbroblasts,
and
endothelial
cells,
cooperatively
contributes
to
adverse
cardiac
remodeling.60
We
were
able
to
deﬁnitively
demonstrate
a
permissive cardiorenal phenotype following 5/6Nx in
WT mice. The 5/6Nx model is typically associated
with high mortality,20 presumably due to acute ure-
mia following excision of the contralateral kidney.
However,
alterations
in
our
surgical
technique
signiﬁcantly
improved
survival
to
>85%-90%.
TSP1KO mice are resistant to acute kidney injury;61
therefore, the induction of equivalent renal injury
through a reduction in functional renal parenchyma
was only possible using a 5/6Nx model. Measure-
ments of renal dysfunction were equivalent, sup-
porting the use of global KO animals for this study.
Accumulated toxins are the cause of uremia in
CKD, and robust evidence establishes uremic toxins
as central to the deranged molecular pathways in
both CVD and CKD.14 IS is the best characterized
uremic toxin, from both epidemiologic and molecular
perspectives. It promotes expression of proﬁbrotic
genes
(through
Smad-dependent
transforming
growth factor-b),57,62 up-regulating inﬂammation63
and cellular senescence64,65 via reactive oxygen spe-
cies and p53 pathways66,67 (although not demon-
strated in cardiomyocytes). Interestingly, the cellular
effects of IS mimic those seen with TSP1, but the role
of TSP1 in CKD-induced cardiac pathology is unex-
plored. In this study, absence of TSP1 attenuated
features of CRS-induced LVH and mitigated expres-
sion
of
deranged
molecular
pathways
without
altering blood pressure, supporting a cardiac effect
that is independent of the vasculature (but not
necessarily vascular responsiveness).
We have previously reported the induction of car-
diac TSP1 in animal models with right ventricular
dysfunction,18 and disruption of TSP1 signaling pro-
vided cardioprotection in the same setting.68 How-
ever, the role of TSP1 in preclinical models of pressure
overload–induced LV dysfunction is discordant,69,70
with TSP1KO mice exhibiting early hypertrophy and
late dilation despite less type 1 collagen deposi-
tion.69,70 However, our CRS model is not deﬁned by
increased afterload (hypertension), which is consis-
tent with published reports.21,71,72 Histopathologic
studies have shown that cardiomyocyte diameter and
resting tension are both increased in HFpEF.73-75
Higher cardiomyocyte resting tension has been pre-
sumably related to sarcomeric protein phosphoryla-
tion that was observed in patients75 and preclinical
models.76 In our study, both myocyte diameter and
sarcomeric actinin were increased in WT-5/6Nx mice,
but were mitigated in TSP1KO-5/6Nx mice. Diastolic
dysfunction
can
result from
abnormal
relaxation
and/or
increased
myocardial
stiffness,
ultimately
leading to elevated LV ﬁlling pressures and HFpEF.
LV ﬁlling pressure is assessed by E/A, isovolumetric
relaxation time, and the E/e0 ratio, which constitutes
key
hemodynamic
abnormalities
associated
with
diastolic dysfunction. These parameters can effec-
tively stratify HF phenotypes, including those with
both reduced and preserved EF,77-79 and have been
applied in small animal studies.80 In our study, E/A,
isovolumetric relaxation time, and E/e0 ratio were
increased in WT-5/6Nx mice but not in TSP1KO-5/6Nx
mice.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. Uremia is a complex condition
with
multiple
systemic
abnormalities,
including
cardiomyopathy. Animal models, including 5/6Nx
may not fully mimic the progressive nature of hu-
man uremic cardiomyopathy owing to differences in
comorbid conditions, including hypertension. Dif-
ferences in disease duration and severity of kidney
injury
can
also
affect
the
relevance
of
research
ﬁndings.
The tissue architecture and mechanical cues in the
heart and blood vessels inﬂuence cellular phenotype
and cross-talk, but these factors are absent in cell
culture systems, limiting the relevance of ﬁndings.
Uremic cardiomyopathy involves interactions among
multiple cell types, which may not be fully captured
when
studying
cell
types
individually.

studies are required to accurately deﬁne the culprit
cell promoting the cardiac pathology seen in CRS. In
addition, lack of concurrent clinical details in the
patient cohort warrant large clinical studies that will
appropriately deﬁne the place of TSP1 as a potential
biomarker of disease.
CONCLUSIONS
Collectively our results suggest that TSP1 is driving
the cellular effects of IS through activation of ERK
and AhR, supporting our hypothesis that TSP1 is a
missing link between CKD and development of CVD,
particularly LVH. The mechanisms that underscore its
development include oxidative stress, senescence,
and inﬂammation.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Patients with
CKD continue to experience dramatically reduced life expectancy
owing to concomitant CVD, termed CRS. Despite a consensus
deﬁnition, there has been minimal progress in our understanding
of the pathophysiology and no speciﬁc therapeutic interventions
that improve outcomes. Here we demonstrate that the uremic
toxin IS is driving deleterious changes in cardiomyocyte pheno-
type through the matrix protein TSP1. These ﬁndings provide a
potential therapeutic target for CRS.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Patients with HFpEF are
vulnerable to the development of renal dysfunction during
treatment for decompensation, and renal-associated mortality is
higher in patients with HFpEF. We have identiﬁed a novel
pathway that drives uremic toxin-induced changes in cardiac
pathology through the protein TSP1. Our mechanistic data lend
support for testing monoclonal antibodies or peptidic inhibitors
that block the actions of TSP1 (and therefore IS), limit develop-
ment of LVH, and potentially improve survival in CRS.

EDITORIAL COMMENT
Thrombospondin-1 in Chronic Kidney
Disease Driven Cardiac Dysfunction
More Than Just a Biomarker?*
Attila Kiss, MD
C
hronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 15% to
20% of adults globally and increases the
risk
of
various
cardiovascular
diseases
(CVDs); consequently, cardiorenal syndromes encom-
passes conditions in which failure of either the kid-
neys or the heart leads to failure of the other organ.1
In general, progressive deterioration of the left ven-
tricular (LV) pump function leads to insufﬁcient
perfusion of the kidney and renal dysfunction entails
increased blood pressure, ﬂuid retention, and eleva-
tion of uremic toxins levels in the circulation, which
eventually foists increased workload on the heart
and results in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, stiffness,
metabolic
alterations,
and
extracellular
matrix
(ECM) remodeling with concomitant cardiac ﬁbrosis.1
Current treatments for chronic CKD involve lifestyle
changes, medication, and dialysis, which can delay
disease progression but they do not usually rescue
the adverse cardiac remodeling. Consequently, CKD-
driven cardiac dysfunction is still largely incurable;
therefore, there is an urgent need for evidence-
based therapies to identify, treat, and signiﬁcantly
improve both the cardiovascular and kidney dysfunc-
tion among patients with CKD.
To better understand the progression of cardio-
vascular dysfunction in CKD, and eventually reduce
the premature mortality in patients with CKD, it is
also important to identify one or likely more highly
sufﬁcient/selective circulating biomarkers. Accord-
ingly, previous studies summarized the use of serum
biomarkers (eg, atrial and B-type natriuretic peptide,
isoforms of troponins, adiponectin, plasma growth
differentiation factor-15, ECM proteins) for cardio-
vascular disease risk prediction in CKD.2,3 Most car-
diovascular
diseases
(eg,
CKD)
involve
severe
remodeling of the ECM, culminating in the formation
of ﬁbrotic tissue that is deleterious to organ function
and ECM protein may serve as a biomarker for disease
progression4 and targeted therapy for heart failure in
CKD.
In
addition,
the
accumulation
of
non-
hemodialyzable uremic toxins, such as indoxyl sul-
fate and p-cresyl sulfate, in the circulation and in
tissues serves as a biomarker and is associated with
the progression of CKD, and CVD in patients with
CKD.5
The ECM network is composed mainly of collagen,
which provides a scaffold for the cellular constituents
of the heart and, furthermore, contributes to the
effective
transmission
of
the
contractile
force.
Collagen type I and type III are highly abundant in the
heart, and responsible for the elasticity of the matrix
network as well as cardiomyocyte stiffness and me-
chanical compliance. Besides collagens, the ECM also
includes nonstructural proteins such as glycosami-
noglycans, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins. How-
ever, despite its high clinical signiﬁcance, the exact
underlying signaling mechanisms of cardiac ECM
remodeling, ﬁbrosis still remains elusive in CKD.
A recent study in this issue of JACC: Basic to
Translational Science by Julovi et al6 demonstrated
for the ﬁrst time that the disruption of ECM glyco-
protein thrombospondin (TSP)-1, which in general
may
be
secreted
by
various
cells,

cardiomyocytes, ﬁbroblasts, and smooth muscle cells
in the myocardium, provides cardioprotection in a
mouse model of CKD.
When extrapolating from preclinical (animal study
and using human cardiomyocytes) ﬁndings to pa-
tients with CKD, the authors also issue the differen-
tial protein levels of circulating TSP-1 and myocardial
gene expression of TSP-1 among patients with CKD in
comparison
with
healthy
patients,
consequently
higher levels of TSP-1 in plasma associated with a
lower LV ejection fraction and an increase in LV mass
index,
respectively.
Surprisingly,
TSP-1
knockout
mice do not show renal protection, despite its detri-
mental role in renal ﬁbrosis7 and ischemic acute kid-
ney injury. Furthermore, TSP-1 upregulation in the
kidneys is associated with aging, and subsequently
renal dysfunction.7 Accordingly, CKD and CVD are
common in older people, and their prevalence in-
creases in parallel with age. This is a very important
and
thought-provoking
issue
with
regard
to
the
ﬁndings of Julovi et al,6 and one can speculate
whether TSP-1 upregulation in plasma may reﬂect
renal failure rather than cardiomyocyte dysfunction/
cardiac
ECM
remodeling
in
patients
with
CKD.
Consequently,
using
renal
tissue–speciﬁc
TSP-1
knockout
mice
with
advanced
age
theoretically
poses an attractive alternative to clarifying the un-
realized renal beneﬁts of TSP-1 downregulation and
simultaneously raise awareness of the progression of
CKD-driven LV hypertrophy and dysfunction.
One of the greatest fundamental ﬁndings by Julovi
et
al6
was
to
recognize
the
molecular
signaling
mechanism that mitigates TSP-1 upregulation in car-
diomyocytes. Accordingly, nonhemodialyzable ure-
mic toxins, for example, indoxyl sulfate binds to aryl
hydrocarbon receptor in cardiomyocytes, a ligand
activated transcription factor that may be involved in
the
regulation
of
TSP-1.
Consequently,
its
over-
expression resulted in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy
and diastolic dysfunction in association with cardiac
ﬁbrosis in a mouse model of CKD and isolated human
cardiomyocytes, respectively. Consistent with that
ﬁnding, the observed impaired LV function and hy-
pertrophy are associated with plasma indoxyl sulfate
upregulation in a rat model of CKD.8 Although not
explicitly stated in the report, we raise the question of
whether indoxyl sulfate solely regulates the expres-
sion of TSP-1 in cardiomyocytes or whether its over-
expression also contributes to the enhancement of
pro-inﬂammatory
and pro-ﬁbrotic
mechanisms
in
different cells types in the heart tissue? The authors
did not provide further evidence or investigate why
the high levels of indoxyl sulfate even in TSP-1
knockout
mice
still
resulted
in
a
strong
car-
dioprotection. A question that emerges from these
ﬁndings is whether and to what extent the TSP-1
plays a role in cardiac dysfunction in CKD, whether
TSP-1 in cardiomyocytes affects the phenotypes of
neighboring cells and microenvironment (eg, in car-
diac ﬁbroblasts). Indeed, cardiomyocytes are critical
contributors to the myocardial ﬁbrotic programs,9 in
response
to
injurious
stimuli
(mechanical
stress,
metabolic dysfunction, and inﬂammatory cytokines)
that might induce the cardiac ﬁbroblast activation
(ﬁbroblasts to myoﬁbroblast transition) and eventu-
ally
cardiac
ﬁbrosis
as
well
as
cardiomyocyte
stiffness.
A ﬁnal question addressed by the present study6 is
whether TSP-1 might be a trigger for senescence in the
heart and demonstrated that senescence and pro-
inﬂammatory markers in the heart tissue were miti-
gated in TSP-1 knockout mice with CKD. In line with
that, differentially expressed gene expression anal-
ysis in the human dataset also conﬁrmed the poten-
tial role of senescence in the progression of CKD and
the risk for CVD in CKD. These ﬁndings raise the
question of the probability of senolytic treatment10 to
alleviate the effects of TSP-1 in adverse cardiac
remodeling in CKD.
In summary, the ﬁndings of Julovi et al6 provide a
ﬁrst piece of evidence that a novel signaling pathway
drives uremic toxin; for example, indoxyl sulfate-
induced
cardiomyocyte
dysfunction
through
the
upregulation of the ECM protein TSP-1. These ﬁnd-
ings were also conﬁrmed in patients with CKD,
lending support to the premise that further stimula-
tion of testing monoclonal antibodies or inhibitors
that block the actions of TSP-1. However, further
multicenter, randomized clinical trials are warranted
to conﬁrm the interaction between indoxyl sulfate
and TSP-1 and to prove evidence that TSP-1 levels are
gradually increasing in CKD and CKD-driven cardiac
hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction.

SUMMARY
RNA-binding proteins play multiple roles in several biological processes. However, the roles of RBM15—an
important RNA-binding protein and a signiﬁcant regulator of RNA methylation—in cardiovascular diseases
remain elusive. This study aimed to investigate the biological function of RBM15 and its fundamental mecha-
nisms in myocardial infarction (MI). Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing was used to explore the
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) difference between MI and normal tissues. Our ﬁndings showed the elevated level
of m6A in MI, and its transcription proﬁle in both MI and normal tissues. RBM15 was the main regulator and its
overexpression attenuated apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and improved cardiac function in mice after MI. Then,
we used one target NEDD8 activating enzyme E1 subunit and its inhibitor (MLN4924) to investigate the impact
of RBM15 targets on cardiomyocytes. Finally, the enhanced m6A methylation in the presence of RBM15
overexpression led to the increased expression and stability of NEDD8 activating enzyme E1 subunit. Our
ﬁndings suggest that the enhanced m6A level is a protective mechanism in MI, and RBM15 is signiﬁcantly
upregulated in MI and promotes cardiac function. This study showed that RBM15 affected MI by stabilizing its
target on the cell apoptosis function, which might provide a new insight into MI therapy.

C
oronary heart disease, leading to
myocardial infarction (MI) ,is a ma-
jor contributor to morbidity and
mortality on a global scale.1 In the United
States, severe ischemia and loss of cardio-
myocytes cause nearly 735,000 annual inci-
dences
of
irreversible
tissue
damage,
resulting in hypertrophy, ventricular remod-
eling, dilatation, and heart failure.2 After the ischemic
injury, the myocardium undergoes a sequence of mo-
lecular and cellular interactions after different stages
of tissue repair.3 The pathophysiology and pathogen-
esis of MI are complex and diverse, mainly including
the production of reactive oxygen species, apoptosis,
autophagy,
inﬂammatory
response,
mitochondrial
dysfunction, and immune response.4 Some useful
clinical biomarkers and key molecules for MI diag-
nosis, including NPPB, TNNT2, ANGPT2, and THBS2,
have been identiﬁed already.5-9 Although advances
in MI treatment, such as stem cell therapies, have
improved the prognosis of MI, patients with exten-
sive myocardial injury are still at a high risk of chronic
heart failure.10-12 In recent years, multiple studies
have found that epigenetic regulation is not only
involved in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy,
hypertension, heart failure, and other cardiovascular
diseases, but also plays an important role in MI.13
Epigenetics refers to the heritable
changes in
the
phenotype
when
the
DNA
methylation,
histone
modiﬁcation,
noncoding
RNAs,
and
N6-
methyladenosine (m6A) methylation occur on. An
essential epigenetic change known as m6A takes place
when the adenosine base is methylated at the N6
position.14,15 Evidence has shown that m6A-related
proteins play a critical role in diverse biological
functions, especially in the development and pro-
gression of diseases, such as in promoting gastric
cancer
progression,
inhibiting
pancreatic
cancer
tumorigenesis,
or
promoting
proliferation
and
tumorigenicity of endometrial cancer.16-18 Consistent
with its roles, m6A is emerging as an important
pathway mediating cardiovascular diseases.19-21 Sig-
niﬁcant functions are performed by regulators of
m6A, the most common kind of RNA modiﬁcation.
These
functions
include
destruction,
translation,
localization, transportation, and RNA processing.22,23
The m6A RNA editing was discovered in the 1970s
and has recently emerged as a signiﬁcant regulator in
gene expression.24,25 It is a dynamic and reversible
modiﬁcation mechanism, and its biological functions
are mediated through m6A-related proteins, named
“writer, “eraser,” and “reader.”26 The formation of
m6A was modulated by 3 categories of proteins: 9

methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), METTL14, and
Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP) plays an
important role on the cardiac function after MI.27
However, there is less research about other methyl-
ation regulators, such as RBM15. Therefore, in the
present research, we investigated the role of RBM15
in the incidence and progression of MI and provided a
novel insight toward myocardial protection.
RBM15 is an RNA-binding protein that can alter-
natively splice c-Mpl messenger RNA (mRNA) to in-
ﬂuence
the
process
of
acute
megakaryocytic
leukemia.28 Moreover, RBM15 is a methylation regu-
lator, although it is named m6A methylase, the real
function of adding m6A is from METTL3.29,30 Thus,
we
investigated
whether
the
role
of
RBM15
in
myocardial protection is signiﬁcant and whether it
could regulate m6A process in MI. In this regard, we
found that MI tissues exhibited much higher m6A
methylation levels compared with normal myocar-
dium tissues. The expression of RBM15 was substan-
tially upregulated among m6A-related proteins. The
developmental expression of RBM15 decreased cell
apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Then, m6A-seq
characterization of MI tissues revealed that RBM15
regulated a target gene NEDD8 activating enzyme E1
subunit 1 (NAE1) involving the p53 signaling pathway.
Moreover,
the
expression
of
NAE1
decreased
apoptosis
via
the
mechanism
of
increased
m6A
methylation. Taken together, these results charac-
terize RBM15 as a signiﬁcant factor attenuating the
apoptosis of cardiomyocytes under MI.

POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION. The m6A modiﬁ-
cation level of a gene was assessed using the Magna
methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) Kit
(Millipore, cat. #CR203146). For this purpose, cells
were collected, double-washed with ice-cold PBS, and
centrifugated at a centrifugation rate of 1,500 rpm for
5 minutes at 4 C. Then, the supernatant was dis-
carded, and the cells were mixed with RIP lysis buffer
(100 mL) and incubated on ice for 5 minutes. The ob-
tained cell preparation was stocked at 80C for
future analysis. Then, the m6A antibody (8 mg) was
added to a tube containing magnetic beads, which
was then subjected to rotation at room temperature
for 30 minutes. Antibody-coated beads were double-
washed with RIP buffer and resuspended in RIP
buffer (900 mL) mixed with cell lysate (100 mL), fol-
lowed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes
at 4 C and rotation at 4 C overnight. Subsequently,
the beads were again washed with a high-salt buffer,
and RNAs were extracted with RIP wash buffer.
Finally, the RNA enrichment analysis was performed
by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).

fractions were fragmented into w100-nt-long oligo-
nucleotides using divalent cations at an elevated
temperature. The RNA fragments were then ﬁltered
and subjected to incubation with an m6A-speciﬁc

the RNA-antibody mixture was further incubated
with protein-A beads. Moreover, RNA was washed
with elution buffer (1  immunoprecipitation buffer
and 6.7 mM m6A) and precipitated using ethanol
(75%). The immunoprecipitation fragments contain-

complying with strand-speciﬁc library preparation.
The average insert size for the paired-end libraries
was w100  50 bp. Finally, an Illumina Novaseq 6000

DATA ANALYSIS. First, Cutadapt and Perl scripts were
used for the quality control of the reads to remove the
adaptor, low-quality bases, and undetermined ba-
ses.31 HISAT2 was used for the purpose of mapping
reads to the genome with default parameters.32 The
m6A peaks were obtained by the R package exome-
Peak.33 The peak annotation was done with gene
architecture by ChIPseeker.34 Then, StringTie was
performed to measure the expression levels for all
mRNAs from input libraries by calculating the frag-
ments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped
reads.35 Finally, the differentially expressed mRNAs
with a fold-change of 2 and a P value of <0.05 were
selected with the aid of the edgeR package in R.36
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. All
data are shown as mean  SEM. All statistical an-
alyses, unless otherwise indicated, were performed
by GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software). Sta-
tistical signiﬁcance was calculated by 2-tailed un-
paired Student’s
t
test if
2
independent
groups
were compared. One-way analysis of variance was
used for comparisons among multiple groups. Post
hoc analyses were performed using Holm-Sidak’s
post hoc test for multiple pairwise comparisons or
by controlling the false discovery rate using the
method
of
Benjamini,
Krieger,
and
Yekutieli.
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to reveal
the survival rate of each group in vivo. P values
of <0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant
(*P
<
0.05,
**P
<
0.01,
***P
<
0.001).
The
signiﬁcant threshold in multiple tests were set by a
false discovery rate of <0.05.
RESULTS
HIGHLY EXPRESSED m6A-RELATED PROTEIN RBM15
IN MI. To study the presence of the m6A modiﬁcation
during MI, we successfully constructed mice models
of MI. We conﬁrmed the occurrence of the m6A
modiﬁcation during the MI process by methylated RIP
sequencing
(MeRIP-Seq);
speciﬁcally,
1,538
m6A
peaks were observed in MI compared with the con-
trol, and 45.93% of the m6A peaks occurred in the 3’
untranslated region (Figure 1A). We found 167 upre-
gulated
genes
and
49
downregulated
genes
(Figure 1B). In total, the m6A sequence identiﬁed that
397 transcripts were upregulated, while 252 tran-
scripts
were
downregulated
(Supplemental
Figure 1A). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed
that the differentially expressed m6A-related tran-
scripts were enriched in gene sets involved in extra-
cellular
space,
extracellular
matrix,
and
positive
regulation of apoptosis cell clearance, revealing that
m6A regulation might have an impact on apoptosis
(Supplemental Figure 1B). Moreover, Kyoto Encyclo-
pedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed
that the differentially expressed m6A-related tran-
scripts
were
involved
in
histidine
metabolism,
hypoxia-inducible factor-1 signaling pathway, com-
plement and coagulation cascades, and extracellular
matrix-receptor interaction (Supplemental Figure 1C).
When
mapping
the
m6A
methylomes,
the
m6A
consensus sequence RRACH motif was identiﬁed to
be highly enriched within m6A sites in the immuno-
puriﬁed mRNA (Figure 1C).
Furthermore, an elevated total m6A mRNA level
was identiﬁed in MI (Figure 1D). Then, the expressions
of
m6A-related
proteins
such
as
some
“writers”
(METTL3, METTL14, WTAP and RBM15), “erasers”
(FTO and ALKBH5), and “readers” (YTHDF1, YTHDf2,
YTHDF3, YTHDC1, and YTHDC2) in MI tissues were
assessed with qPCR (Figure 1E). The expression of
METTL3 and RBM15 increased dramatically in MI
among other methylase-related proteins (Figure 1E).
Because we have investigated the role of METTL3 in
MI, in this research we paid attention to RBM15. Then,
we assessed the protein expression of RBM15 by
Western
blotting,
which
also
showed
a
highly
elevated expression level in MI tissues (Figure 1F). To
investigate potential diagnosis or treatment roles of
RBM15 in a clinical context, we examined serum from
patients with ST-segment elevation MI and healthy
individuals
using
enzyme-linked
immunoassay.
Finally, we observed that the RBM15 level increased

remarkably (Figure 1G). To imitate the MI circum-
stances, neonatal rat left ventricle myocytes (NRVMs)
under hypoxia conditions at different time points
(1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours) were set to assess the
expression of RBM15; we found the highly elevated
expression
level
after
3
hours
(Supplemental
Figure 1D). These results proved that RBM15 might
have an important role in the m6A modiﬁcation in MI.
THE
EFFECTS
OF
OVEREXPRESSING
RBM15
ON
CARDIOMYOCYTES UNDER HYPOXIA. To investigate
the biological roles of RBM15 in cardiomyocytes,
RBM15 silencing and overexpression were established
via
transfection
into
NRVMs
(Supplemental
Figures 2A to 2D). Subsequently, loss- and gain-of-
function assays were carried out for the purpose of
identifying the role of RBM15 in NRVMs under hyp-
oxic conditions. Considering the key role of bcl-2,
cleaved-caspase3, and bax in mediating apoptosis,
Western
blotting
analysis
conﬁrmed
that
RBM15
overexpression
attenuated
apoptosis
activity
of
NRVMs
when
treated
in
hypoxic
conditions
(Figure
2A).
Furthermore,
lactate
dehydrogenase
release assays showed that RBM15 overexpression
also decreased apoptosis of NRVMs (Figure 2B). The
results from the CCK8 assay also suggested that
RBM15 decreased the apoptosis of NRVMs under
hypoxic conditions (Figure 2C). Subsequently, we
used a terminal uridine nick-end labeling (TUNEL)
assay and ﬂow cytometry to further demonstrate the
protective effect of RBM15. After hypoxia treatment,
there were few TUNEL-positive nuclei in NRVMs that
overexpressed
RBM15
(Figure
2D).
Representative
ﬂow cytometry plots were generated for control and
NRVMs overexpressing RBM15; they demonstrated a
decreased number of apoptotic cells in the RBM15-
overexpressing treated group (Figure 2E). Hence,
those in vitro results showed that RBM15 could
ameliorate hypoxia-induced cell death.
APOPTOSIS OF NRVMs WITH SILENCED RBM15 UNDER
HYPOXIC
CONDITIONS. To
further
investigate
the
functional role of RBM15 in NRVMs, we used small
interfering (si)-RBM15 to demonstrate whether the
effects of RBM15 knockdown are the opposite from
those of RBM15 overexpression. To this end, we
performed
Western
blotting
and
identiﬁed
the
apoptosis-related markers including bax/bcl-2 and
cleaved-caspase3. We found that the RBM15 knock-
down
remarkably
promoted
NRVMs
apoptosis
following hypoxia (Figure 3A). Similar to the Western
blotting results, the lactate dehydrogenase release
assay and CCK8 assay showed that RBM15 silencing
increased cell death (Figures 3B and 3C). The TUNEL
assay and ﬂow cytometry showed the same results,
indicating that RBM15 knockdown promoted NRVMs
apoptosis after hypoxic treatment (Figures 3D and 3E).

AFTER

RBM15. The
protective
effects
of
RBM15
over-
expression in cells under hypoxia allowed us to
further analyze its effect on the infarction-induced
cardiac dysfunction. Then, we successfully estab-
lished the mouse MI model overexpressing RBM15
(Supplemental
Figures
2E
and
2F).
Given
that
glycogen
consumption
can
cause
hypoxia-
and
glycolysis-induced damage of NRVMs at the very
beginning of MI, apoptosis was assessed through
Western blot and TUNEL assays on the infarcted tis-
sues and remote areas. We found that, 1 week after
MI, the expression levels of cleaved-caspase3 and bax
signiﬁcantly decreased, whereas the expression level
of bcl-2 increased in the RBM15-adeno-associated vi-
rus 9 (AAV9) group (Figures 4A to 4F). The TUNEL
assay showed that the number of TUNEL-positive
nuclei in the RBM15-AAV9 group was lower than
that of the NC-AAV9 group (Figure 4G). Thus, the
in vivo results showed that RBM15 was able to
ameliorate MI-induced cell death.
At weeks 1, 2, and 4 after MI , serial echocardiog-
raphy and hemodynamic measurements were used to
evaluate the cardiac function in mice from the indi-
cated groups. We found that the cardiac function was
improved by RBM15 overexpression, as indicated by

higher EF%, FS% and lower LVIDd, LVIDs at week 4
after MI (Figures 5A to 5E, Supplemental Figures 3A to
3E, Supplemental Table 5). The effects of RBM15 on
the post-MI outcomes were further conﬁrmed by
assessing smooth muscle/collagen through Masson
staining. The smooth muscle/collagen ratio in the
normal saline (NS) group was considerably lower than
that in the sham group (Figures 5F and 5G). Further-
more, hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed
to evaluate the cell morphology of the myocardium.
For
example,
the
cardiomyocytes
were
arranged
regularly in the sham group, showing obvious nuclei
and no inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration. In contrast, the
MI, MI with NS, and MI with NC-AAV9 groups dis-
played major myocardial cell necrosis, disordered
myocardial ﬁber arrangement, and quantities of in-
ﬂammatory cell inﬁltrations. The cardiomyocytes in
MI within the RBM15-AAV9 group showed a much
more orderly arrangement with a remarkable reduc-
tion
in
the
range
and
degree
of
cell
necrosis
(Figure 5H). Finally, the probability of survival of each
group was analyzed and showed that the mortality
rate of mice with injection RBM15 after MI was
decreased at the ﬁnal point (Figure 5I, Supplemental
Table 6). Taken together, these in vivo data indi-
cated that RBM15 dramatically decreased infarction
and improved cardiac function.
ANALYSIS OF DOWNSTREAM TARGETS OF RBM15 IN
CARDIOMYOCYTES. To investigate downstream tar-
gets
of
RBM15,
the
precise
mechanisms
of
the
observed RBM15-dependent phenotypes were further
investigated with the aid of an integrated combined
MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq. MeRIP-seq revealed 1,538
differential m6A peaks with increased abundance,
whereas RNA-seq uncovered 851 upregulated tran-
scripts (Supplemental Tables 7 and 8). We focused
more on oncogenes whose methylation and expres-
sion proﬁles were regulated by RBM15. Thus, only
those transcripts that had both hypo-m6A peaks and
elevated
expression
levels
upon
RBM15
over-
expression
were
considered.
All
differentially
expressed gene fold changes are shown in Figure 6A.
Then, we conducted the enrichment analysis of all
the RBM15-upregulated genes into GO term annota-
tion. The top 10 enrichment GO terms are shown in
Figure 6B, and we found that gene sets were mainly
involved in iron-sulfur cluster assembly, negative
regulation
of
phosphorylation,
and
regulation
of
apoptosis
process.
Moreover,
we
performed
text
mining to ﬁnd any relationship between MI and the
signiﬁcantly enriched GO terms. For example, it has
been reported that the ischemic-reperfusion injury
results in oxidative damage led by cysteine ligands of
the
iron-sulfur
cluster.37
In
MI,
PPM1L
could
inhibit IKKb’s phosphorylation and activation by
binding to it, thereby leading to the impairment of
nuclear factor kB signaling activation and inﬂamma-
tory suppression.38
To further systematically screen biological func-
tions, we searched for all differentially expressed
genes
in the protein-protein interaction
network
(Figure 6C). Each protein cluster is shown in a distinct
color, and the cluster enrichment function is labeled
in the corresponding colored boxes. Moreover, KEGG
analysis showed that localization, immune response,
and metabolic process were related to the RBM15
regulation process (Figure 6D). Importantly, ﬁltering
the 1538 increased m6A peaks with the 851 upregu-
lated genes resulted in the identiﬁcation of 25 genes
(Figure 6E). Among these 25 genes, we chose one of
the highly conserved genes, named NAE1, in the
regulation of the apoptotic process to investigate the
details of the regulation (Supplemental Figures 4A
and 4B).
ENHANCED NAE1 EXPRESSION BY RBM15 THROUGH
STABILIZING ITS mRNA. To demonstrate whether
RBM15 regulates NAE1 mRNA, we ﬁrst found that the
NAE1 mRNA expression level increased dramatically
in the infarction area in the MI model (Figure 7A), and
its level decreased after silencing RBM15 in NRVMs
under hypoxic conditions (Figure 7B). In contrast,
NAE1 mRNA expression level increased dramatically

after overexpressing RBM15 in NRVMs under hypoxic
condition (Figure 7C). To investigate the RNA-binding
role of RBM15 in NAE1 mRNA, we performed RIP-
qPCR, and found that RBM15 could bind quantities
of NAE1 mRNA (Figure 7D). After treatment with
actinomycin D (a transcription inhibitor), the qPCR
analysis revealed that the expression of NAE1 signif-
icantly decreased after silencing RBM15, indicating
that
RBM15
can
maintain
the
stability
of
NAE1
(Figure 7E). Taken together, our ﬁndings revealed that
RBM15 enhanced NAE1 expression via stabilizing
its mRNA.
APOPTOSIS OF CARDIOMYOCYTES AFTER INHIBITION
OF NAE1. Given that the GO and KEGG analyses
showed that NAE1 might be involved in the apoptosis
pathway, we further investigated whether NAE1, a
downstream target of RBM15, has an effect on car-
diomyocyte apoptosis under hypoxia. The role of
NAE1 in the protective effect on NRVMs was validated
by infecting the cells with adenoviruses expressing
NAE1 or siRNA. The Western blotting data proved the
upregulated expression of NAE1 and a remarkable
decrease in proapoptosis markers (cleaved-caspase3,
bax) in NRVMs (Figure 8A). In contrast, we used
siNAE1-1 and siNAE1-2 to infect NRVMs, and after
hypoxia treatment, we found that the NAE1 knock-
down promoted apoptosis of NRVMs (Figure 8B).
Furthermore, the lactate dehydrogenase release and
CCK8
assays
were
used
to
assess
the
NRVMs
apoptosis, and the results indicated that the NAE1
overexpression was able to decrease apoptosis of
NRVMs (Figures 8C to 8F). To further examine the
proapoptosis effect of the NAE1 knockdown, NRVMs
were treated with MLN4924 (the NAE1 inhibitor) at
different concentration points. We found that the
levels of NAE1 signiﬁcantly decreased and proa-
poptosis markers, including cleaved-caspase3 and
bax signiﬁcantly increased (Figure 8G). These data
demonstrated that NAE1 inhibition enhanced the
death of NRVMs.
DISCUSSION
Despite signiﬁcant advances made in early detection
and treatment over the course of the last decade, MI
continues to be a primary cause of death and dis-
abilities.39 Many investigators are actively looking for
potential markers and investigating the components
of immune cell inﬁltration of MI, both of which have
the potential to have a signiﬁcantly beneﬁcial impact
on the long-term survival of patients with MI. Many
studies have reported the potential of using mRNA as
a potentially useful indicator of diseases in the car-
diovascular ﬁeld, particularly MI. A growing body of
data shows that m6A regulators exhibit a wide range
of regulatory effects on the diversity of biological
activity. However, few people have been able to un-
derstand the role of m6A regulators in MI.40 The m6A
plays a modulatory role in nearly all stages of the RNA
life
cycle,
including
mRNA
processing,
nuclear
export, translation modulation, and even the phase
separation potential of mRNA.41-43 It has been re-
ported that m6A plays an important role in cardio-
vascular
diseases,
not
only
as
a
biomarker
in
diagnosis of MI, but also as a medicine in treatment of
cardiac remodeling.44,45 Shi et al44 used comprehen-
sive analysis of m6A regulators expression to identify
distinct molecular subtypes of MI, and they found
several genes were signiﬁcantly related to the devel-
opment of MI, with being regulated by m6A methyl-
transferases.
In
the
present
research,
we
also
observed the differences in m6A modiﬁcation in
MeRIP of MI and sham control tissues. Moreover,
RBM15 was screened as a dramatically changed m6A-
related protein. Given that we have demonstrated
METTL3, the main m6A methyltransferase regulated
the myocardial remodeling after MI, we investigated
the role of RBM15 in MI. We found that the expression
level of RBM15 was signiﬁcantly upregulated in MI.
The GO analysis and KEGG analysis revealed that
many
apoptosis-related
genes
during
MI
were
remarkably regulated by m6A. Overexpression of
RBM15 decreased the cardiomyocytes’ apoptosis. This
observation was further corroborated by in vivo
ﬁndings that the heart function was improved in the
MI
mice
overexpressing
RBM15.
Later,
NAE1—an
RBM15 target—was found by ﬁltering MeRIP-seq and
RBM15-RIP-seq.
We
found
that
RBM15
positively
regulated the stability of the target NAE1 mRNA.
Notably, similar to RBM15, the overexpression of

NAE1 showed a protective effect on NRVMs apoptosis
under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, functional
evaluations
such
as
NAE1
silencing
and
using
MLN4924 (NAE1 inhibitor) demonstrated that NAE1
played a key role in MI. However, in addition to NAE1,
other potential downstream targets of RBM15 might
play crucial roles in mediating RBM15 functions in MI
protection. Nevertheless, clarifying the exact under-
lying
mechanisms
requires
further
systematic
investigations.
Recently, a growing body of work has indicated the
essential role of m6A in human diseases.46-48 The
regulation process involves 3 major m6A regulators,
including
methyltransferase,
demethylase,
and
methylation
recognition
enzymes.
The
methyl-
transferases
include
METTL3,
METTL14,
WTAP,
RBM15, and RBM15b, but the latter 3 do not have the
ability to transfer m6A to mRNA. By adding m6A to
related
mRNAs,
METTL3
affects
the
alternative
splicing, stable or translation of those mRNA to
regulate various diseases.43,49-51 During this process,
METTL14 mainly binds to some sites in METTL3 to
form a new complex, but WTAP and other proteins
such as RBM15 or RBM15b probably recruit some fac-
tors to assist in the m6A regulation process.52-54
Although
some
researchers
have
reported
that
WTAP and RBM15 can add m6A to mRNA to regulate
some diseases, they have only found that related
phenotypes changed, but they have not investigated
whether the exact process of adding m6A involves
WTAP or RBM15 or not.55,56 Therefore, we preferred
to name RBM15 as the m6A regulator, which can assist
the m6A adding process.
The present research discussed the regulatory role
of RBM15 in the protection from MI and the upregu-
lation of the expression of its targets. It has been re-
ported that RBM15 can facilitate the access of DEP5 to
mRNA with its nuclear export factor function.57 Yang
et al58 have demonstrated that Circ-CTNNB1 facili-
tates RBM15-mediated m6A modiﬁcation to drive
aerobic
glycolysis
and
osteosarcoma
progression.
Additionally, studies related to RBM15 have focused
mainly on its function as an RNA-binding protein, and
RBM15 has a great effect on megakaryoblastic leuke-
mia and hematopoietic development.59-61 Therefore,
in this study, we used RIP assays and multiple loss- or
gain-of-function experiments to show that RBM15 can
bind NAE1 mRNA and stabilize mRNA to decrease
cardiomyocytes
apoptosis.
NAE1
decreases
cell
apoptosis mainly through inhibiting the p53 pathway
and Akt pathway to regulate the myocardial function
in MI.62-64 Moreover, we found that RBM15 promoted
Akt pathway to exert myocardial protective effect
(Supplemental Figures 5A and 5B). Finally, these
ﬁndings envision the RBM15 as a candidate drug for
the treatment of MI.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. Although we also found that
overexpressing RBM15 could increase the total m6A
level in cells, and NAE1 was screened from MeRIP-
seq, which could be regulated by RBM15, we only
drew a conclusion that RBM15 participated in NAE1’s
m6A regulation process because the main methyl-
transferase
was
METTL3.
Lacking
the
advanced
technologies, we merely showed that RBM15 partici-
pated in NAE1’s m6A regulation process. In terms of
the present m6A research, how to study the dynamic
regulation of m6A is extremely important, because
the dynamic regulation of methylation and deme-
thylation should be involved in the occurrence and
development of diseases. In the future, we will
explore more mechanisms of RBM15 in assisting
NAE1’s m6A regulation process. However, our study
successfully demonstrated the role of RBM15 in MI
protection, suggesting a viable potential for devel-
oping targeted therapies against MI.
CONCLUSIONS
The present research shed light on an RNA-binding
protein, namely, RBM15, which plays a modulatory
function in the regulation of NAE1 mRNA. Regarding

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Despite the
large number of drug therapies available for the treatment of MI,
there remains a compelling need for establishing a novel and
effective therapies to improve the efﬁcacy of existing ones.
Among many antitumor drugs, the pharmacological basis of
many drugs is to promote the apoptosis of tumor cells or inhibit
the proliferation of corresponding blood vessels through RNA
modiﬁcation. However, in the cardiovascular ﬁeld, there is no
RNA modiﬁcation drug for the treatment of MI.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: The enhanced m6A methyl-
ation in the presence of RBM15 overexpression led to the
increased expression and stability of NAE1, contributing to less
myocardial ﬁbrosis, cell apoptosis, and cardiac dysfunction. Our
ﬁndings suggest that the enhanced m6A level is a protective
mechanism in MI, setting the stage for the therapeutic targeting
of the MI. Finally, pharmacological inhibitors of the molecules
involved the pathway are being tested and are primed for testing
for the beneﬁcial effects in patients with MI.

EDITORIAL COMMENT
Potential of Epigenetic Therapy in
Alleviating Cardiac Death and Fibrotic
Remodeling in Myocardial Infarction*
Olivier Morel, MD, PHDa,b,c

espite
signiﬁcant
advancements
in
the
management
of
ST-segment
elevation
myocardial infarction (STEMI), the devel-
opment of effective cardioprotective strategies re-
mains
an
ongoing
challenge.
Although
prompt
reperfusion therapy, primarily achieved through pri-
mary percutaneous coronary intervention, has trans-
formed
the
acute
management
of
STEMI
by
salvaging jeopardized myocardium and improving
patient outcomes, patients often experience postre-
perfusion
adverse
cardiac
events.
These
events,
including myocardial stunning, reperfusion injury,
and adverse ventricular remodeling, contribute to
ongoing morbidity and mortality. Despite various
pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches
targeting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,
sympathetic nervous system, inﬂammation, angio-
genesis,
mitochondrial
function,
cytochrome
c
release, and delivery of supersaturated oxygen, clin-
ical trials have yielded limited success, emphasizing
the
need
for
novel
strategies
to
enhance
cardioprotection.1,2
Over the past decade, we have gathered signiﬁcant
insight into how epigenetic events contribute to
the
pathogenesis
of
cardiovascular
disease.3,4
Epigenetics involves regulatory networks governing
gene
expression
and
cellular
behavior
through
reversible modiﬁcations of genomic DNA and his-
tones.5 An essential epigenetic change, known as N6-
methyladenosine (m6A), occurs when the adenosine
base is methylated at the N6 position. The m6A
modiﬁcation
is
a
dynamic
and
reversible
post-
transcriptional modiﬁcation process regulated by 3
distinct protein complexes: writers (enzymes that add
chemical modiﬁcations), readers (effector proteins
that bind to modiﬁed macromolecules), and erasers
(enzymes that delete chemical modiﬁcations), which
tune important biological processes by adding or
removing the m6A sites. Among the proteins involved
in
m6A
modiﬁcation,
methyltransferases
play
a
crucial role in catalyzing the methylation of RNAs.
Writers consist of large methyltransferase complexes
in which the RNA-binding protein (RBM15) acts as a
scaffold for methyltransferase-like proteins such as
METTL3 and METTL4, facilitating their recruitment
and the methylation of mRNA molecules. Signiﬁcant
functions performed by regulators of m6A include
destruction, translocation, transportation, and RNA
processing.5,6
In this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science,
Cheng et al7 provide pioneering data on the protec-
tive
role
of
RBM15
in
limiting
cardiomyocyte
apoptosis following myocardial infarction (MI).7 Us-
ing mouse models of MI, the investigators highlighted
the signiﬁcance of m6A modiﬁcation during the pro-
gression of myocardial ischemia, identifying 1,538
m6A peaks in MI tissues compared with control tis-
sues. Additional analysis revealed the up-regulation
of 167 genes and the down-regulation of 49 genes.

vestigators emphasized the enrichment of differen-
tially expressed m6A-related transcripts in genes

involved
in
extracellular
matrix
remodeling
and
apoptosis. Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and
Genomes
(KEGG)
analysis
highlighted
the
involvement of differentially expressed m6A-related
transcripts
in
pathways
such
as
histidine
meta-
bolism, the HIF-1 signaling pathway, complement and
coagulation
cascades,
and
extracellular
matrix–
receptor interactions.
To ascertain the relevance of this pathway in
humans, RBM15 levels were quantiﬁed by enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay in 50 STEMI patients
and 50 age-matched control patients with comparable
cardiovascular risk factors, revealing a signiﬁcant in-
crease of RBM15 in STEMI patients. Overexpression of
RBM15 attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis under
hypoxic conditions ex vivo and adverse myocardial
remodeling in mice, whereas silencing RBM15 (si-
RBM15) provided the opposite effect. The importance
of this pathway was underscored in mice through a
functional approach using serial echocardiography
and hemodynamic measurements coupled with his-
tological analysis. To establish a model of cardiac
overexpression
of RBM15, adenovirus-RBM15
was
injected into the mouse myocardial tissue at 3 to 5
points using an insulin needle. Western blot and
quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses were
conducted
to
determine
the
peak
expression
of
RBM15 3 weeks after injection. Subsequently, MI was
induced using left coronary artery ligation, unveiling
delayed improvement in heart function, reduced
cardiac ﬁbrosis at 4 weeks, and enhanced 60-day
survival
associated
with
RBM15
overexpression.
Furthermore,
analysis
of
downstream
targets
of
RBM15 in neonatal rat left ventricle cardiomyocytes
identiﬁed NEDD8 activating enzyme E1 subunit 1
(NAE1) as a crucial regulator of apoptosis. Elevated
NAE1 mRNA expression within the infarct area tissue,
coupled with ex vivo analysis illustrating enhance-
ment of NAE1 via RBM15-mediated mRNA stabiliza-
tion, provided additional insight into the mechanistic
basis of RBM15-mediated cardioprotection. Finally,
the inhibition of NAE1 demonstrated a noteworthy
reduction in cardiomyocyte apoptosis, underscoring
the
signiﬁcance
of
this
pathway
in
post-MI
remodeling.
Although a translational approach was undertaken,
the study faced challenges in obtaining extensive
human data regarding RBM15 expression throughout
the progression of MI. The study lacked information
on RBM15’s expression in human ischemic myocar-
dial tissue, and this could be a valuable addition to
future studies. The characterization of STEMI pa-
tients would have beneﬁted from further elaboration,
particularly
in
assessing
coronary
reperfusion
(TIMI ﬂow grade, blush), infarct size, left ventricular
ejection fraction. A key point, likely to drive future
study design, is the relationship between RBM15
levels and key prognostic biomarkers of MI, such as
natriuretic peptides, cardiac troponin I, C-reactive
protein, or interleukin 6. Although not reported here,
this warrants further discussion and exploration.
Despite these limitations, this study elucidated a
novel and important pathway involved in mitigating
cardiac death and ﬁbrotic myocardial remodeling. It
aligns with previous research demonstrating the sig-
niﬁcance of METTL3 up-regulation in heart failure
and
m6A
modiﬁcations
in
various
experimental
models and human tissues, emphasizing the potential
clinical relevance of targeting these pathways in the
context of MI.3,6 Whereas the Cheng et al7 study
focused on the primary role of writers in regulating
m6A
modiﬁcation
and
lacked
evidence
for
any
modiﬁcation of erasers proteins within myocardial
tissue, another recent study provided convincing
data showing a key role for the eraser fat mass and
obesity-associated protein (FTO), an m6A demethy-
lase.8
FTO
expression
was
found
to
be
down-
regulated in heart failure, leading to an aberrant in-
crease in global cardiac m6A levels, as well as m6A
levels in selective contractile transcripts, resulting in
decreased protein expression. Loss of FTO resulted in
abnormal calcium handling and sarcomere dynamics,
leading to impaired contractile function. By contrast,
overexpression of FTO in failing murine myocardium
attenuated ischemia-induced cardiac remodeling and
loss of cardiac contractile function, demonstrating
the therapeutic potential of FTO.8
Beyond
apoptosis
regulation
and
calcium
handling, recent evidence highlighted the importance
of epigenetically regulated networks in governing the
functional phenotype shift of cardiac macrophages.9
The transition of cardiac macrophages to a repara-
tive phenotype plays a crucial role in resolving in-
ﬂammatory responses and facilitating efﬁcient tissue
repair
following
MI.
Notably,
nucleophosmin
1
(NPM1) has been implicated in promoting athero-
sclerosis through the induction of vascular inﬂam-
mation via the nuclear factor-kB signaling pathway.10
Conversely, NPM1 plays a critical role in controlling
the inﬂammatory phenotype of cardiac macrophages,
thereby antagonizing cardiac repair. Macrophage-
speciﬁc deletion of NPM1 emerges as a promising
strategy for promoting cardiac repair and alleviating
post-MI cardiac dysfunction and adverse remodeling.
The epigenetic machinery, mediated by the NPM1–
KDM5b
interaction,
governs
cardiac
macrophages
transition and post-MI tissue repair via metabolic
reprogramming. NPM1 acts as an epigenetic factor

targeting
the
Tsc1
gene,
then
recruiting
histone
demethylase KDM5b, to form an inhibitory epigenetic
complex that ultimately suppresses reparative tran-
sition via the mTOR pathway. Antisense oligonucle-
otides and NPM1 inhibitors demonstrated therapeutic
efﬁcacy in promoting cardiac repair in wild-type mice
after MI.9
Collectively, these innovative studies offer novel
and pertinent insights into how epigenetic therapy
could mitigate adverse cardiac remodeling in MI and
alleviate inﬂammation-related damage. Historically,
many therapies that showed promise in experimental
models failed to translate successfully from bench to
bedside and have consequently been consigned to the
graveyard of therapies. Let us remain hopeful that the
fate of epigenetic therapies will diverge from this
trend.

SUMMARY
Hemodynamic shear stress is a frictional force that acts on vascular endothelial cells and is essential for
endothelial homeostasis. Physiological laminar shear stress (LSS) suppresses endothelial inﬂammation and
protects arteries from atherosclerosis. Herein, we screened differentially expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs)
that were signiﬁcantly altered in LSS-stimulated endothelial cells and found that circRNA-LONP2 was involved
in modulating the ﬂow-dependent inﬂammatory response. Furthermore, endothelial circRNA-LONP2 overex-
pression promoted endothelial inﬂammation and atherosclerosis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circRNA-
LONP2 competitively sponged miR-200a-3p and subsequently promoted Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1,
Yes-associated protein 1, and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 expression, thereby inactivating nuclear factor
erythroid 2–related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 signaling, promoting oxidative stress and endothelial inﬂam-
mation, and accelerating atherosclerosis. LSS-induced down-regulation of circRNA-LONP2 suppresses endo-
thelial inﬂammation, at least in part, by activating the miR-200a-3p–mediated nuclear factor erythroid 2–
related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 signaling pathway. CircRNA-LONP2 may serve as a new therapeutic target
for atherosclerosis. (J Am Coll Cardiol Basic Trans Science 2024;9:652–670) © 2024 The Authors. Published by

emodynamic shear stress is a frictional
force that acts on vascular endothelial cells
(ECs) and is essential for endothelial ho-
meostasis under normal physiological conditions.
The physiological level of laminar shear stress (LSS)
inhibits atherosclerosis by reducing the expression
of inﬂammatory molecules, including adhesion mole-
cules, that guide leukocytes to migrate through arte-
rial walls.1 Conversely, low oscillating shear stress
(OSS) promotes endothelial inﬂammation and the
development of atherosclerosis.2-4 However, the mo-
lecular mechanisms underlying the ﬂow-dependent
regulation
of
vascular
function
are
not
fully
understood.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of
endogenous noncoding RNAs that present a cova-
lently closed loop structure via back-splicing the 30
end of RNAs with the 50 end.5-8 Previous studies have
shown
that
circRNAs
regulate
gene
expression
through various mechanisms, including acting as
microRNA (miRNA) sponges, interacting with pro-
teins, and encoding proteins.9-11 circRNAs play crucial
regulatory roles in cardiovascular diseases, including
atherosclerosis.12-14
However,
the
role
of
circRNAs in mediating the effects of shear
stress on endothelial inﬂammation remains
unclear.
In the current study, we ﬁrst screened
differentially expressed circRNAs that were
signiﬁcantly altered in LSS-stimulated ECs
and identiﬁed that circRNA-LONP2 may be
involved in modulating the ﬂow-dependent
inﬂammatory
response.
Furthermore,
endothelial
circRNA-LONP2
overexpression
promoted endothelial inﬂammation and the
development of atherosclerosis in vitro and
in
vivo.
Mechanistically,
we
found
that
circRNA-LONP2
acts
as
a
competing
endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to sponge miR-
200a-3p,
thereby
increasing

METHODS
CELL CULTURE. Human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs)
(catalog no. 8000) and human aortic ECs (catalog no.
6100) were purchased from ScienCell Research Lab-
oratories and cultured in an EC culture medium
containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% EC growth
supplement, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (catalog
no. 1001; ScienCell Research Laboratories). HUVECs
from passages 5 to 7 were used for all experiments.
The cells were cultured in a carbon dioxide incubator
(5% carbon dioxide) at 37C.
Mouse aortic ECs (MAECs) (catalog no. BNCC359881;
Bena Culture Collection) and Lenti-X 293T cells (cata-
log no. 632180; Takara Bio) were cultured in high-
glucose Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle medium (catalog
no. C11995500BT; Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (catalog no. A31608-02; Gibco) and 1% peni-
cillin/streptomycin (catalog no. 15140122; Gibco).
THP-1 cells (catalog no. SCSP-567) were purchased

ANIMAL
STUDIES. Animal
experiments
complied
with animal welfare regulations. The animal experi-
mental protocol was reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Sun
Yat-Sen University, approval no. SYSU-IACUC-2021-
000608) and by the Animal Research Committee of
the
Eighth
Afﬁliated
Hospital
of
Sun
Yat-sen
University (approval no. 2021-010-01). Male ApoE/
genetically engineered mice (7-8 weeks old, weighing
32  3 g) were bred following the guidelines of the
China Animal Protection Association. ApoE/ mice
were carefully kept in a speciﬁc pathogen-free grade
animal facility at the Animal Center of Sun Yat-Sen
University and fed a high-fat diet from the time
of purchase.
ApoE/ mice were subjected to partial carotid ar-
tery ligation surgery15 on the left carotid artery (LCA)
5 weeks later; they were simultaneously injected in
situ with recombinant adeno-associated virus vector
9
(AAV9)
with
SLRSPPS
peptide
modiﬁcation
(AAV9SLRSPPS)-Tie2-circRNA-LONP2 (1  1010 vector
genomes) or AAV9SLRSPPS-Tie2-control (1  1010 vector
genomes). High-fat feeding continued for 6 weeks
postoperatively. The ApoE/ mice were then sacri-
ﬁced, and the bilateral carotid arteries were harvested
for further histologic and immunoﬂuorescent staining
analyses. Atherosclerotic plaques of the LCA and right
coronary artery were identiﬁed by using Oil Red O
staining; the intima and media areas of the LCA and
right coronary artery were examined by using hema-
toxylin and eosin staining. Further details are pro-
vided in the Supplemental Appendix.
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS. All
experiments
were
independently repeated at least 3 times, and the data
were statistically processed with GraphPad Prism 8.0
(GraphPad Software). Data were tested for normality
by using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Data are presented as
mean  SEM, and differences between groups were
tested for signiﬁcance by using the two-tailed Stu-
dent’s t-test (two groups). One-way analysis of vari-

RESULTS
CircRNA-LONP2
IS
DOWN-REGULATED
BY
ATHE-
ROPROTECTIVE
LSS. To
identify
the
changes
in
circRNA expression patterns after shear stress stim-
ulation, we conducted circRNA microarray analysis
using RNA extracted from HUVECs cultured for 24
hours under static or LSS conditions. A total of 84
differentially expressed circRNAs were detected with
>1.5 fold change and P < 0.05, including 65 up-
regulated
and
19
down-regulated
circRNAs
(Figures 1A and 1B). We conﬁrmed that several circR-
NAs do have differential expression, including the
highly abundant circRNA-LONP2 (circBase identiﬁer:
hsa_circ_0008558),
which
was
signiﬁcantly
down-
regulated in LSS-stimulated ECs compared with the
static
control
(Figure
1C).
circRNA-LONP2
was
selected for further investigation because of its rela-
tively high expression level in ECs (Supplemental
Figure
1)
and
important
impact
on
EC
function
(Figure 2, Supplemental Figure 2).
Upon examining ECs at different time points after
LSS stimulation, we found that long-term (24 hours
and 48 hours) LSS stimulation reduced circRNA-
LONP2 expression, whereas short-term LSS (3 hours
and 6 hours) had no effect (Figure 1D). The levels of
linear LONP2 messenger RNA (mRNA) did not change
in ECs that received LSS stimulation for 24 hours
compared with those in static controls. These results
suggest
that
circRNA-LONP2,
but
not
the
linear
LONP2 transcripts, may be related to mediate the ef-
fects of LSS.
Several RNA-binding proteins have been reported
to be involved in circRNA production, including
quaking (QKI),16 fused in sarcoma (FUS),17 double-
stranded RNA-speciﬁc adenosine deaminase (ADAR),
and
ATP-dependent
RNA
helicase
A
(DHX9).18
Therefore, we investigated the mRNA expression of
these RNA-binding proteins in response to different
shear stress stimuli. Our results reveal the opposite
effects of LSS and OSS on the mRNA levels of ADAR,
DHX9, FUS, and QKI in ECs (Supplemental Figure 3),
suggesting that shear stress regulates circRNA-LONP2
expression through the aforementioned proteins.
We then assessed the exon structure of circRNA-
LONP2, which is derived from exons 8, 9, 10, and 11
of
LONP2.
Using
divergent
primers
and
Sanger
sequencing, we conﬁrmed head-to-tail splicing of
circRNA-LONP2 and validated the whole structure of
circRNA-LONP2 (Figure 1E, Supplemental Figure 4).
Polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that
divergent primers could amplify circRNA-LONP2 in
reverse-transcribed RNA (complementary DNA), but
not in genomic DNA, indicating that this RNA is cir-
cular in form (Figure 1F). Figures 1G and 1H illustrate
the resistance of circRNA-LONP2 to exonucleolytic
degradation, conﬁrming its circular nature. In addi-
tion, nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation (Figure 1I) and
RNA-ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (Figure 1J)
showed
that
circRNA-LONP2
was
preferentially
located in the cytoplasm of ECs, indicating that the
cytoplasm is the main site for the biological effects of
circRNA-LONP2.
CircRNA-LONP2 MODULATION OF THE FLOW-DEPENDENT
INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE. To investigate the biolog-
ical functions of circRNA-LONP2, small interfering
RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the back-spliced junction of
circRNA-LONP2 were used to speciﬁcally knock down
circRNA-LONP2
expression
in
ECs.

(qRT-PCR)
showed
that
circRNA-LONP2
silencing
reduced the mRNA levels of KEAP1, and inﬂammatory
genes vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)
and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)
increased the mRNA levels of the antioxidative stress
and
anti-inﬂammatory
genes
NRF2
and
heme
oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and had no signiﬁcant effects on
the mRNA levels of LONP2 (Figure 2A). Interestingly,
Western blot analysis revealed that circRNA-LONP2
silencing
reduced
the
protein
levels
of
VCAM-1,
ICAM-1, and KEAP1 while promoting the protein
expression of NRF2 and HO-1 in HUVECs and human
aortic ECs (Figures 2B and 2C).
After conﬁrming the high circularization efﬁciency
(approximately 75%) (Supplemental Figure 5) and
high
splicing
accuracy
(approximately
92.5%)
(Supplemental Figure 6) of transcripts generated from
the
circRNA-LONP2
overexpression
vector,
we
investigated whether circRNA-LONP2 overexpression
had opposite effects. As expected, circRNA-LONP2
overexpression signiﬁcantly up-regulated the mRNA
and protein levels of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and KEAP1 but
down-regulated those of NRF2 and HO-1 (Figures 2D
to 2F).
To distinguish the effects of circRNA-LONP2 from
its linear counterpart, a plasmid with the reverse
circularization sequence deletion (R-deletion) was
constructed, allowing the plasmid to produce only
linear transcripts for use as a control in circRNA-
LONP2 overexpression experiments (Supplemental
Figure
7A).
qRT-PCR
showed
that
the
wild-type
(WT) vector, but not the R-deletion mutant (MUT),
signiﬁcantly overexpressed circRNA-LONP2, whereas
the R-deletion MUT signiﬁcantly overexpressed the
linear transcript (Supplemental Figure 7B). As ex-
pected, no signiﬁcant differences were detected be-
tween the R-deletion group and the control group
(Supplemental Figures 7B and 7C), suggesting that the
linear
counterpart
of
circRNA-LONP2
does
not
modulate endothelial inﬂammation and oxidative
stress.
Furthermore,
circRNA-LONP2
silencing
signiﬁcantly reversed the inﬂammation and oxidative
stress
of
ECs
induced
by
circRNA-LONP2
over-
expression but had no effect on the expression of the
linear transcripts (Supplemental Figures 7D and 7E).
These results suggest that circRNA-LONP2, but not its
counterpart, is the major cause of inﬂammation and
oxidative stress in ECs.
In addition, knockdown of endogenous circRNA-
LONP2 attenuated tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)–
induced protein expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in
ECs,
which
brought
about
reduced
adhesion
of
monocytes to ECs (Figure 2G). Consistently, circRNA-
LONP2
overexpression
partially
counteracted
LSS-induced
repression
of
VCAM-1,
monocyte
chemoattractant protein 1, and E-Selectin (SELE)
expression
(Figure
2H,
Supplemental
Figure
8).
Considering that oscillatory shear stress (OSS, 0.5 
5 dyne/cm2) up-regulated the expression levels of
circRNA-LONP2 (Supplemental Figure 9), we investi-
gated whether knockdown of circRNA-LONP2 could
partially reverse the pro-inﬂammatory effects of OSS.
As
expected,
circRNA-LONP2

Taken
together, our results suggest that circRNA-LONP2
regulates ﬂow-dependent inﬂammatory responses.
CircRNA-LONP2 REGULATED ENDOTHELIAL INFLAMMATION
VIA THE NRF2/HO-1 AXIS. Because circRNA-LONP2 is
derived from the back-splicing of its linear transcript,
we tested whether the linear LONP2 transcript me-
diates the function of circRNA-LONP2. Our data show
that silencing or overexpression of circRNA-LONP2
has
no
effect
on
mRNA
levels
of
linear
LONP2
(Figures 2A and 2D). Consistently, LSS down-regulated
the expression of circRNA-LONP2 without affecting
the
mRNA
level
of
linear
LONP2
(Supplemental
Figure
10).
These
results
suggest
that
shear-
sensitive
circRNA-LONP2
modulates
endothelial
inﬂammation independently from linear LONP2.
To investigate the possible mechanisms underlying
circRNA-LONP2–induced
endothelial
inﬂammation,
we further performed Western blot analysis of the
nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of ECs transfected
with circRNA-LONP2 siRNA or control siRNA. The
purity of the nuclear and cytosolic fractions was
conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis using antibodies
against
the
nuclear
(Lamin
B1)
and
cytoplasmic
(GAPDH
[glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate
dehydroge-
nase]) marker proteins. As expected, the knockdown
of circRNA-LONP2 attenuated TNF-a–stimulated nu-
clear factor-kB (NF-kB) p65 translocation into the
nucleus,
while
promoting
NRF2
nuclear
trans-
location, suggesting that circRNA-LONP2 may induce
endothelial inﬂammation by modulating the nuclear
translocation of NRF2 and NF-kB (Figure 3A).
A previous study reported that the NRF2/HO-1
pathway
has
anti-inﬂammatory
properties.19
We
therefore explored whether circRNA-LONP2 regulates
endothelial
inﬂammation
through the
NRF2/HO-1
axis. As expected, inhibition of NRF2 or its down-
stream target, HO-1, by siRNA signiﬁcantly abrogated
the
anti-inﬂammatory
effects
of
circRNA-LONP2
siRNA in ECs (Figures 3B and 3C). Collectively, these
data show that circRNA-LONP2 regulates endothelial
inﬂammation via the NRF2/HO-1 axis.
Given
that
circRNA-LONP2
works
through
the
NRF2/HO-1 axis, we performed a reactive oxygen

species assay to determine if oxidative stress was
reduced after circRNA-LONP2 silencing in HUVECs.
As shown in Figure 3D, silencing of circRNA-LONP2
reduced the TNF-a–induced reactive oxygen species
levels in ECs. These results suggest that circRNA-
LONP2 modulates endothelial inﬂammation by regu-
lating the oxidative stress state of ECs.
CircRNA-LONP2 INDUCED ENDOTHELIAL INFLAMMATION
THROUGH
THE
miR-200A-3p/KEAP1/NRF2
PATHWAY.
Because circRNA-LONP2 was observed to be prefer-
entially located in the cytoplasm of ECs, we hy-
pothesized that circRNA-LONP2 may regulate gene
expression by acting as miRNA sponges. The star-
Base database20 was used to predict the targets of
circRNA-LONP2, and 5 broadly conserved miRNAs
(miR-10a-5p, miR-10b-5p, miR-141-3p, miR-200a-3p,
and miR-216b-5p)
that
directly bind to
circRNA-
LONP2
were
selected
for
further
analysis
(Figure 4A). To identify miRNAs that might bind to
circRNA-LONP2, we designed an MS2 RNA pull-down
assay. A vector was constructed expressing circRNA-
LONP2 labeled with MS2 RNA hairpins (circRNA-
LONP2-MS2-PD)
and
a
control
vector
expressing
circRNA-LONP2
(circRNA-LONP2-PD).
By
labeling
circRNA-LONP2
with
the
MS2
structure
and
co-
expressing MS2-binding protein (ie, MS2-BP) fused
to a GST tag (ie, MS2-BP-GST), we were able to use
glutathione magnetic beads to pull down miRNAs
that interact with circRNA-LONP2.
In addition, to avoid nonspeciﬁc pull-down of
linear transcripts, one-half of the MS2 sequence was
cloned at the 50 end of circRNA-LONP2 and the other
half at the 30 end; thus, only circRNA-LONP2 (whose 50
end and 30 end are connected to form a closed loop by
back-splicing) transcripts, rather than its linear tran-
scripts, can form intact MS2 (Figure 4B, Supplemental
Figure 11A). The results showed speciﬁc enrichment
of circRNA-LONP2 and miR-200a-3p, miR-10a-5p, and
miR-10b-5p in the MS2-labeled circRNA-LONP2-MS2-
PD group compared with the control (Figure 4C,
Supplemental Figure 11B). Because miR-200a-3p was
the most enriched miRNA in the circRNA-LONP2 pull-
down assay, ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization assays
were performed to conﬁrm the interaction, revealing
the co-localization of circRNA-LONP2 and miR-200a-
3p (Figure 4D). We further performed dual-luciferase
assays using reporters containing WT and MUT miR-
200a-3p binding sites of circRNA-LONP2 to verify
the interaction between circRNA-LONP2 and miR-
200a-3p.
The
results
proved
that
miR-200a-3p
mimics could signiﬁcantly down-regulate the lucif-
erase activity of the WT group, but not the MUT
group, indicating that circRNA-LONP2 may indeed
bind miR-200a-3p (Figure 4E).
Given the apparent interaction between circRNA-
LONP2 and miR-200a-3p, we investigated the bio-
logical
function
of
miR-200a-3p.
We
found
that
transfection of ECs with miR-200a-3p mimics signiﬁ-
cantly down-regulated the RNA levels of circRNA-
LONP2,
KEAP1,
VCAM-1,
and
ICAM-1
while
up-regulating the RNA levels of NRF2 and HO-1
(Figure
4F).
In
addition,
overexpression
of
miR-
200a-3p promoted NRF2 and HO-1 protein expres-
sion while suppressing the protein expression of
VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and KEAP1 (Figures 4G and 4H). The

cell phenotype induced by miR-200a-3p was similar
to that induced by circRNA-LONP2 silencing, sug-
gesting that miR-200a-3p mediates the regulatory
effect of circRNA-LONP2 on EC function. As expected,
transfection with miR-200a-3p inhibitors signiﬁcantly
rescued
the
inhibitory
effects
of
circRNA-LONP2
silencing on KEAP1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 protein
expression,
while
abolishing
circRNA-LONP2
silencing-induced NRF2 and HO-1 protein expression
(Figures 4I and 4J). Thus, the antioxidative and anti-
inﬂammatory effects of circRNA-LONP2 silencing in
ECs were mediated by miR-200a-3p.
Interestingly, we found that miR-10a-5p and miR-
10b-5p
could
also
be
pulled
down
by
circRNA-
LONP2, although not as efﬁciently as miR-200a-3p.
Previous studies have shown that miR-10a exerts
anti-inﬂammatory effects in cultured human aortic
ECs.21-23 To test whether circRNA-LONP2 also regu-
lates endothelial inﬂammation by sponging miR-10a-
5p and miR-10b-5p and to further show that the
anti-inﬂammatory effects of circRNA-LONP2 silencing
in ECs are mediated by miR-200a-3p, circRNA-LONP2-
MUT1 (circRNA-LONP2 with mutated miR-200a-3p
binding
sites)
vectors
and
circRNA-LONP2-MUT2
(circRNA-LONP2 with mutated miR-10a/b-5p binding
sites) vectors (Figure 4K) were constructed. Western
blot
analysis
revealed
that
a
mutation
in
the
miR-200a-3p binding site largely blocked the pro-
oxidative and pro-inﬂammatory effects of circRNA-
LONP2,
whereas
a
mutation
in
the
miR-10a/b
binding site had no effect (Figure 4L), suggesting
that circRNA-LONP2 promotes oxidative stress and
endothelial inﬂammation by sponging miR-200a-3p.
Notably, previously studies reported that circRNA-
LONP2 directly interacts with pri-miR-17 and miR-
27b-3p.24,25 Consistent with these ﬁndings, our data
indicated that primary miR-17 and miR-27b-3p, but
not miR-17-3p or miR-17-5p, were pulled down by
circRNA-LONP2
in
HUVECs,
albeit
with
lower
enrichment
compared
with
miR-200a-3p
(Supplemental Figure 11B). To examine the roles of
pri-miR-17
and
miR-27b-3p
in
circRNA-LONP2–
induced endothelial oxidative stress and inﬂamma-
tion,
circRNA-LONP2-MUT3
(circRNA-LONP2
with
mutated
miR-27b-3p
binding
sites)
vectors
and
circRNA-LONP2-MUT4 (circRNA-LONP2 with mutated
pri-miR-17
binding
sites)
vectors
(Supplemental
Figure 11C) were constructed. Western blot analysis
revealed that these mutations had no effect on the
pro-oxidative
and
pro-inﬂammatory
effects
of
circRNA-LONP2 (Supplemental Figure 11D), suggest-
ing that pri-miR-17 and miR-27b-3p are not involved
in
circRNA-LONP2–induced
endothelial
oxidative
stress and inﬂammation.
We further investigated whether the expression
levels of miR-200a-3p can be regulated by circRNA-
LONP2 or LSS. As shown in Supplemental Figures 12
and 13A to 13C, although circRNA-LONP2 was more
abundant than miR-200a-3p, knockdown or over-
expression of circRNA-LONP2 had no effect on the
expression of miR-200a-3p. Furthermore, LSS had no
effect
on
the
expression
of
miR-200a-3p
(Supplemental Figure 13D). These data indicate that
shear-sensitive circRNA-LONP2 modulates endothe-
lial inﬂammation without affecting the expression of
miR-200a-3p.
Because miR-200a-3p was found to target KEAP1,26
we hypothesized that circRNA-LONP2 induced endo-
thelial
inﬂammation
through
the
miR-200a-3p/
KEAP1/NRF2 pathway. To conﬁrm that KEAP1 is
regulated by miR-200a-3p, luciferase reporters con-
taining WT or MUT 30-untranslated region of KEAP1
were
constructed.
Dual-luciferase
reporter
assays
showed that the luciferase activities of the KEAP1 WT

(Figure 4M). In addition, we found that circRNA-
LONP2
overexpression
or
knockdown
further
increased or reduced the luciferase activity of the
KEAP1 WT reporter (Figures 4N and 4O). These results
revealed that circRNA-LONP2 serves as a sponge for

to
regulate
KEAP1

promote
endothelial inﬂammation via the ceRNA mechanism
in ECs.
CircRNA-LONP2 ACCELERATES THE PROGRESSION
OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS. A previous report showed
that AAV9SLRSPPS could efﬁciently target ECs.27 To
study the function of endothelial circRNA-LONP2 in
atherogenesis, ApoE/ mice with partial ligation of
the
LCA
were
infected
with
AAV9SLRSPPS-Tie2-
circRNA-LONP2
or
AAV9SLRSPPS-Tie2-control
(Figures 5A and 5B). The murine Tie2 promoter was
used to drive endothelial circRNA-LONP2 expression
in
ApoE/
mice.
Endothelial
overexpression
of
circRNA-LONP2
was
conﬁrmed
by
qRT-PCR
and
ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (Figures 5C and 5D).
Six weeks after ligation, the plaque area, neointima
size, and intimal lipid deposition in ApoE/ mice
infected with AAV9SLRSPPS-Tie2-circRNA-LONP2 were
signiﬁcantly aggravated compared with those in the
control
group
(Figures
5E
to
5G,
Supplemental
Figure 14). In addition, immunoﬂuorescence stain-
ing showed that circRNA-LONP2 increased the pro-
tein levels of the pro-inﬂammatory markers Vcam-1
(Figure 5H) and Icam-1 (Figure 5I) and mononuclear
phagocytes marker Mac-3 substantially (Figure 5J) in
the ligated LCA of ApoE–/– mice, while decreasing the
protein levels of antioxidative and anti-inﬂammatory
Nrf2 (Figure 5K) and Ho-1 (Figure 5L), without signif-
icantly affecting the protein expression of Keap1
(Figure 5M). These data suggest that circRNA-LONP2
accelerates
the
progression
of
atherosclerosis
by
inducing oxidative stress and endothelial inﬂamma-
tion. Furthermore, these results reveal that there is
an additional pathway by which circRNA-LONP2 reg-
ulates
NRF2
signaling
without
affecting
KEAP1 expression.
CircRNA-LONP2
MODULATES
OXIDATIVE
STRESS
AND
ENDOTHELIAL
INFLAMMATION
VIA
THE
miR-200A-3p/YAP1/EZH2
AXIS. Although
miR-
200a-3p was conserved across most vertebrates, the
miR-200a-3p
binding
site
was
not
conserved
in
mouse Keap1, suggesting that mouse Keap1 mRNA is
not a target of miR-200a-3p. Indeed, although the
overexpression
of
circRNA-LONP2
increased
the
mRNA levels of Vcam-1 and Icam-1 while reducing the
mRNA levels of Nrf2 and Ho-1, it did not affect the
mRNA levels of Keap1 in MAECs (Figure 6A). Consis-
tently, immunoﬂuorescence staining showed that
circRNA-LONP2 has no effect on protein levels of
Keap1 in mice (Figure 5M). These data suggested that
the regulatory effects of circRNA-LONP2 on the pro-
gression of atherosclerosis in mice are not mediated
by Keap1 but by other miR-200a-3p targets.
A previous report has shown that miR-200a-3p in-
hibits inﬂammation and the formation of atheroscle-
rotic lesions by targeting EZH2.28 EZH2 functions as a
histone H3 Lys27 (H3K27) trimethyltransferase that
transcriptionally represses NRF2 expression in lung
cancer.29 In addition, YAP1, which promotes the
development of atherosclerotic lesions,30 has been
identiﬁed as a target of miR-200a-3p.31 YAP1/TAZ
promotes the transcription of EZH2 in lung cancer.32
Therefore,
we
further
explored
whether
EZH2
and YAP1 are involved in the pro-oxidative and
pro-inﬂammatory effects of circRNA-LONP2. As ex-
pected, overexpression of miR-200a-3p decreased
EZH2
and
YAP1
protein
expression
(Figure
6B).
Consistently, silencing circRNA-LONP2 down-regu-
lated YAP1 and EZH2 (Figure 6C), whereas the over-
expression of circRNA-LONP2 had the opposite effect

by using Western blot analysis. (C and D) Protein levels of Keap1, Nrf2, Ho-1, Vcam-1, Icam-1, Yap1, and Ezh2 in MAECs transfected with mouse Yap1 siRNA (si-Yap1),
mouse Ezh2 siRNA (si-Ezh2), or si-NC were analyzed by using Western blot analysis. (E) MAECs transduced with mouse Yap1 or mCherry (ctrl) lentivirus for 24 hours
were transfected with mouse Ezh2 siRNA or control siRNA for an additional 48 hours. Protein levels of Keap1, Nrf2, Ho-1, Vcam-1, Icam-1, Yap1, and Ezh2 were
determined by using Western blot analysis. (F and G) MAECs transduced with mouse circRNA-Lonp2 or mCherry (ctrl) lentivirus for 24 hours were transfected with
mouse si-Yap1 (F), mouse si-Ezh2 (G), or control siRNA for an additional 48 hours. Protein levels of Keap1, Nrf2, Ho-1, Vcam-1, Icam-1, Yap1, and Ezh2 were determined
by using Western blot analysis. (H to J) MAECs transfected with circRNA-Lonp2 or ctrl lentivirus (H), miR-200a-3p inhibitor or negative control (NC) inhibitor (I), Yap1 or
ctrl lentivirus (J) were exposed to atheroprotective LSS (15 dyne/cm2) for 24 hours. The protein levels of Vcam-1, Mcp1, Nrf2, Keap1, Ho-1, Yap1, and Ezh2 were
detected by using Western blot analysis. Unpaired 2-tailed Student’s t-test was used for statistical analyses. Values are mean  SEM. n ¼ 3. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;

(Figure 6D). Furthermore, the overexpression of hu-
man circRNA-LONP2 increased mRNA levels of Yap1
and Ezh2 in MAECs (Figure 6E). Collectively, these
data suggest that EZH2 and YAP1 are conserved
downstream targets of circRNA-LONP2.
We
further
explored
whether
mouse
circRNA-
Lonp2 has a similar function. Although there were
some mismatches between the human and mouse
Lonp2 genome sequences, the binding sites of miR-
200a-3p
in
human
circRNA-LONP2
and
mouse
circRNA-Lonp2
were
conserved
(Supplemental
Figure
15).
We
found
that
circRNA-Lonp2
was
expressed
in
MAECs
and
in
the
mouse
aorta
(Supplemental Figure 16). The overexpression of
mouse
circRNA-Lonp2
up-regulated
Ezh2,
Yap1,
Vcam-1, and Icam-1, while down-regulating Nrf2 and
Ho-1 at the protein level, without affecting Keap1
expression in MAECs (Figure 6F). These data suggest
that, in mice, circRNA-Lonp2 promotes oxidative
stress and endothelial inﬂammation by targeting Yap1
and Ezh2 rather than Keap1.
Next,
we
investigated
whether
circRNA-LONP2
functions by targeting YAP1/EZH2 in both humans
and mice. Silencing YAP1 or its downstream target
EZH2 decreased the mRNA and protein levels of
VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, while increasing the mRNA and
protein levels of NRF2 and HO-1, without affecting
the mRNA and protein levels of KEAP1 in HUVECs
(Figures 6G to 6J). Moreover, silencing of YAP1 or
EZH2
by
siRNA
signiﬁcantly
abrogated
the
pro-
oxidative and pro-inﬂammatory effects of circRNA-
LONP2 in HUVECs (Figures 6I and 6J). Consistent
with
these
data,
immunoﬂuorescence
staining
showed
that
circRNA-LONP2
signiﬁcantly
up-
regulated Yap1 and Ezh2 in mice (Figures 6K and 6L).
Collectively, these data suggest that circRNA-LONP2
functions by targeting YAP1/EZH2 in both humans
and mice.
To show the causal relationship between Yap/
Ezh2 expression and Nrf2 activation in mouse ECs,
we conducted a series of gain-of-function and loss-
of-function experiments as well as rescue experi-
ments. Overexpression of Yap1 or its downstream
target Ezh2 increased the protein levels of Vcam-1
and Icam-1, while decreasing the protein levels of
Nrf2
and
Ho-1,
without
affecting
Keap1
protein
expression in MAECs (Figures 7A and 7B). Silencing
of Yap1 or Ezh2 had the opposite effect (Figures 7C
and 7D). Moreover, silencing of Ezh2 signiﬁcantly
abrogated the pro-oxidative and pro-inﬂammatory
effects of Yap1 in MAECs (Figure 7E). Consistent
with these data, silencing of Yap1 or Ezh2 signiﬁ-
cantly
abrogated
the
pro-oxidative
and
pro-
inﬂammatory effects of mouse circRNA-Lonp2 in
MAECs (Figures 7F and 7G). In addition, circRNA-
Lonp2
overexpression
partially
counteracted
the
LSS-induced repression of Vcam-1, Mcp-1, Yap1, and
Ezh2 protein expression, as well as partially atten-
uated the LSS-induced up-regulation of Nrf2 and
Ho1 protein expression, with no effect on Keap1
protein expression in MAECs (Figure 7H). Consis-
tently, miR-200a-3p inhibitor transfection or Yap1
overexpression
partially
counteracted
the
anti-
oxidative and anti-inﬂammatory effects of LSS in
MAECs (Figures 7I and 7J). Taken together, these
results indicate that shear-sensitive circRNA-LONP2
regulates oxidative stress and endothelial inﬂam-
mation via a conserved signaling mechanism, the
miR-200a-3p/YAP1/EZH2 axis.
DISCUSSION
LSS inhibits endothelial inﬂammation and protects
arteries
from
atherosclerosis;33-35
however,
the
mechanism of this effect is unclear. CircRNAs are key
regulators of vascular homeostasis and atheroscle-
rosis,36,37 but their role in mediating the action of LSS
has not been explored. In this study, we ﬁrst revealed
that LSS down-regulated circRNA-LONP2 expression,
inhibiting oxidative stress and endothelial inﬂam-
mation
by
activating
the
miR-200a-3p–mediated
NRF2/HO-1 signaling pathway. These ﬁndings pro-
vide strong evidence for the atherogenic effects of
endothelial circRNA-LONP2 and suggest it as poten-
tial target for atherosclerotic therapy.
Although atherosclerosis is associated with many
systemic risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia,
hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and aging, this
process primarily occurs near arterial branches, bi-
furcations, and curvatures, where the blood ﬂow is
disturbed, generating OSS that drives atherosclerosis
by inducing vascular inﬂammation and oxidative
stress.38 OSS triggers endothelial inﬂammation by up-
regulating the expression of endothelial adhesion
molecules (VCAM-1 and ICAM-1), facilitating mono-
cyte adhesion to ECs.39 Activation of NF-kB signaling
is crucial in OSS-induced inﬂammation.40 NRF2 is
activated by LSS, which induces activation of anti-
inﬂammatory and antioxidant gene expression and
protects cells from oxidative stress and inﬂammatory
damage.41-43 NRF2 activates the transcription of a
series of antioxidant genes and is the main regulator
of the cellular antioxidant defense system.44 Under
normal conditions, NRF2 is sequestered in the cyto-
plasm by KEAP1, which prevents NRF2 from nuclear
translocation and facilitates its proteasomal degra-
dation.45 In response to LSS stimulation, NRF2 is
activated
by
dissociation
from
KEAP1
and

translocation into the nucleus, which induces the
expression of antioxidant genes.41,43
In addition to its antioxidant effects, NRF2 inhibits
the NF-kB signaling pathway through a variety of
mechanisms. First, NRF2 inhibits oxidative stress-
mediated NF-kB activation by reducing intracellular
reactive oxygen species levels.46 Second, NRF2 in-
duces
up-regulation
of
cellular
HO-1
expression,
preventing degradation of IkB-a.47 Thus, targeted
activation of NRF2 may protect the arterial vascular
system from atherosclerosis through its antioxidant
and anti-inﬂammatory effects. We found that LSS-
induced
down-regulation
of
circRNA-LONP2
sup-
presses endothelial inﬂammation, at least in part by
activating the NRF2/HO-1 signaling pathway. These
ﬁndings suggest that circRNA-LONP2 can serve as a
therapeutic target in atherosclerosis.
miRNAs are a class of small, noncoding RNAs, each
about 22 nucleotides long, that are active in post-
transcriptional gene silencing.48,49 miRNAs respond
to shear stress regulation and participate in vascular
EC
inﬂammation.50-52
miR-200a-3p
is
highly
conserved among vertebrate species and reportedly
targets KEAP1,26,53-55 YAPI,31,56,57 and EZH2.28 How-
ever, the role of miR-200a-3p in mediating the effects
of shear stress on endothelial inﬂammation remains
unclear. LSS suppresses YAP1, which interrupts in-
ﬂammatory signaling pathways and prevents athero-
sclerosis progression.58 EZH2 is down-regulated by
LSS to prevent apoptosis in ECs59; EZH2 down-
regulation
also
enhances
activation
of
atherosclerosis-protective MAPK7 signaling, confer-
ring an antiatherosclerotic effect.60 Consistent with
these previous ﬁndings, we found that miR-200a-3p
targets and inhibits KEAP1, YAP1, and EZH2 expres-
sion in ECs and that transfection with miR-200a-3p
mimics
activated
NRF2
signaling.
In
addition,
knockdown of NRF2 or its downstream HO-1 signiﬁ-
cantly
attended
the
anti-inﬂammation
effect
of
circRNA-LONP2 knockdown. Together, these results
establish
the
previously
unknown
functions
of
circRNA-LONP2
in
regulating
NRF2
signaling
via
sponging miR-200a-3p and endothelial inﬂammation
via NRF2 signaling. Interestingly, we uncovered 2
mechanisms (conserved and species-speciﬁc mecha-
nisms) by which circRNA-LONP2 modulates NRF2
signaling. First, circRNA-LONP2 regulates the nuclear
transport of NRF2 via the miR-200a-3p/KEAP1 axis
(human-speciﬁc
regulatory
mechanism).
Second,
circRNA-LONP2 regulates NRF2 expression via the
miR-200a-3p/YAP1/EZH2 axis (a conserved regulatory
mechanism in both humans and mice). Our ﬁndings
highlight
species-speciﬁc
differences
in
circRNA-
LONP2–regulated NRF2 signaling.
Previous
studies
reported
that
circRNA-LONP2
directly interacts with and promotes the processing
of
primary
microRNA-17
in
colorectal
carcinoma
cells24 and directly interacts with miR-27b-3p to
accelerate the progression of esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma through the miR-27b-3p-ZEB1 axis.25
Although our data conﬁrm that circRNA-LONP2 can
interact with pri-miR-17 or miR-27-3p, the mutation
experiments rule out a role for pri-miR-17 or miR-27-
3p in mediating circRNA-LONP2–induced vascular
endothelial
inﬂammation
and
oxidative
stress.
Further research is needed to explore the role of
circRNA-LONP2 in vascular ECs through its interac-
tion with pri-miR-17 or miR-27-3p.
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. First, although most of the
circRNA-LONP2 was located in the cytoplasm, a small
number of circRNA-LONP2 were still located in the
nucleus. Further experiments are required to explore
the function of circRNA-LONP2 in the nucleus. Sec-
ond, the mechanism of how LSS mediates circRNA-
LONP2 reduction remains unclear. Further studies
are needed to explore the potential role of ADAR,
DHX9,
FUS,
and
QKI
in
shear
stress–mediated
circRNA-LONP2 regulation. Third, the ceRNA hy-
pothesis suggests that gene expression is optimally
regulated when miRNA and ceRNA are expressed
almost equally.61,62 However, our study showed that
circRNA-LONP2 is approximately twice as abundant
as
miR-200a-3p
in
HUVECs.
Further
studies
are
needed to explore the effects of other factors on
ceRNA activity, such as the subcellular location of
circRNA-LONP2
and
miR-200a-3p,
miR-200a-3p/
circRNA-LONP2
afﬁnity,
RNA
editing,
and
RNA-
binding proteins. Finally, although our in vitro and
in vivo experiments showed that circRNA-LONP2
promotes oxidative stress and endothelial inﬂamma-
tion and accelerates the progression of atheroscle-
rosis, further research is needed to explore the
clinical value of circRNA-LONP2.
CONCLUSIONS
The current study found that antiatherosclerotic LSS
signiﬁcantly
down-regulated
the
expression
of
circRNA-LONP2, and the reduction of circRNA-LONP2
alleviated oxidative stress and endothelial inﬂam-
mation by enhancing the activity of miR-200a-3p,
which
targets
KEAP1,
YAP1,
and

mRNA
for
degradation
and

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Hemodynamic
shear stress is a frictional force that acts on vascular ECs and is
essential for endothelial homeostasis under normal physiological
conditions. circRNAs are powerful regulators of vascular ho-
meostasis and atherosclerosis; however, their roles in mediating
the effects of LSS remain unexplored. This study provides the
ﬁrst evidence that circRNA-LONP2 modulates the ﬂow-
dependent endothelial inﬂammatory response and accelerates
the progression of atherosclerosis, suggesting a clinical signiﬁ-
cance of circRNA-LONP2 in atherosclerosis.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: OSS induces circRNA-LONP2
expression and promotes atherosclerosis; however, LSS inhibits
circRNA-LONP2 expression and has anti-atherosclerosis proper-
ties. We propose that endothelial-speciﬁc knockdown of
circRNA-LONP2, or its downstream targets KEAP1, YAP1 or EZH2,
might be a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent or treat
atherosclerosis.

EDITORIAL COMMENT
Stressing the Circle
Circular RNA-LONP2 Role in Atherosclerosis*
Simona Greco, PHD, Fabio Martelli, PHD
A
therosclerosis
is
a
chronic
inﬂammatory
disease affecting the vascular wall of large-
and
medium-sized
arteries.
This
disease
leads to myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and
peripheral arterial disease, representing the leading
cause of morbidity and mortality in developed coun-
tries.1 Hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and dia-
betes mellitus are among the systemic risk factors
predisposing to atherosclerosis. Atheromas preferen-
tially form in arterial regions in which the blood
ﬂow is disturbed, whereas arterial regions exposed
to stable ﬂow remain healthy.2 In particular, early
atherosclerotic lesions appear nonrandomly in the ar-
tery, with a strikingly localized pattern that follows
the geometry of branched or curved points. In light
of this ﬁnding, it is possible to classify the near-wall
shear stress proﬁles in atheroprone and atheropro-
tected arterial geometries.2
The blood ﬂow imposes a stress on the endothe-
lium with frictional forces or wall shear stresses.
There are several blood ﬂow patterns, ranging from a
time-averaged unidirectional laminar ﬂow, usually
occurring in unbranched arterial regions, to a dis-
turbed ﬂow, occurring in branched or curved arteries.
These ﬂow patterns result in laminar shear stress
(LSS) and low-magnitude and oscillatory shear stress
(OSS), respectively.
Shear stress stimulates various mechanosensors,
such as ion channels, nicotinamide adenine dinucle-
otide
phosphate
oxidase
and
xanthine
oxidase,
receptor tyrosine kinases, G proteins, and cell/cell
and cell/matrix adhesion complexes. These mecha-
notransduction
mechanisms
link
the
externally
applied mechanical stress to intracellular and intra-
nuclear events.3
Different
spatial
and
temporal
patterns
of
shear stresses, despite the common mechanosensors
and
mechanotransducers,
trigger
distinguishable
gene expression patterns. Indeed, LSS upregulates
atheroprotective genes, such as endothelial nitric
oxide synthase, the Krüppel-like factor family (KLF2
and KLF4), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
2–like bZIP transcription factor 2 (NRF2 or NFE2L2),
and superoxide dismutases (MN-SOD and EC-SOD),
and downregulates proatherogenic genes, such as
those related to coagulation, leukocyte diapedesis,
and smooth muscle cell proliferation. Conversely,
OSS enhances proatherogenic genes, such as vascular
cell adhesion protein 1 and intercellular adhesion
molecule 1 and suppresses atheroprotective genes.
Thus, LSS plays a crucial role in vascular homeostasis,
whereas
OSS
leads
to
vascular
dysfunction
and
disease.
Although the interconnection between hemody-
namics, endothelial pathobiology, and atherogenesis
has been extensively investigated, more in-depth
research is needed to understand the
molecular
mechanisms underpinning the responses to different
ﬂow
patterns.
Speciﬁcally,
among
the
emerging
players, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are particularly
promising4; ncRNAs are mainly categorized according
to their sequence length into small or long ncRNAs.5
Small ncRNAs include microRNAs (miRNAs), and
long ncRNAs include linear long ncRNAs and circular
RNAs
(circRNAs).
circRNAs
identify
single-strand
covalently closed molecules generated through the
back-splicing of linear RNA precursors. Accordingly,
circRNAs are resistant to exonucleases, which makes
them
signiﬁcantly
more
stable
than
their
linear
counterparts and promising biomarkers. circRNAs
can act as miRNA sinks or sponges, thus actively

competing
with
miRNA
targets.6
Several
ﬂow-
sensitive miRNAs and few long ncRNAs have been
found to regulate endothelial function and athero-
sclerosis,4 whereas the role of circRNAs remains
unclear.
In this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science,
Wang et al7 report that ﬂow-sensitive circRNA-LONP2
modulates the inﬂammatory response induced by
shear stress and the development of atherosclerosis
both in vitro and in vivo. By microarray proﬁling in
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs), they
identiﬁed
several
circRNAs
modulated
by
LSS
compared
to
the
static
condition,
among
which
circRNA-LONP2
was
signiﬁcantly
downregulated.
Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain
reaction experiments showed instead that the linear
form of LONP2 was not modulated, indicating inde-
pendent circRNA-LONP2 modulation, a telltale of
signiﬁcant
biological
function.
Importantly,
the
circRNA exon structure was conﬁrmed by divergent
primers and Sanger’s sequencing, whereas the exo-
nucleases degradation resistance proved the circular
structure, and the in situ hybridization results indi-
cated the cytoplasmic localization.
The atheroprotective LSS and the atheropromoting
OSS
had
a
different
impact
on
circRNA-LONP2
expression;
the
former
reduced
and
the
latter
increased the circRNA expression. Gain- and loss-of-
function experiments showed that in human ECs the
inhibition
of
circRNA-LONP2
expression
reduced
the messenger RNA levels of the proinﬂammatory
VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 and increased the messenger
RNA levels of the antioxidative stress and anti-
inﬂammatory genes NRF2 and heme oxygenase 1,
whereas circRNA-LONP2 overexpression had oppo-
site effects. The increase of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1
messenger RNA levels mediated by OSS was coun-
teracted by circRNA silencing. The effects of the
circRNA-LONP2–mediated
generation
of
reactive
oxygen species on endothelial inﬂammation was
demonstrated by silencing cirRNA-LONP2 expression,
which attenuated the tumor necrosis factor alpha–
induced expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in ECs,
reduced reactive oxygen species levels, and reduced
the adhesion of monocytes to the cocultured ECs.
These data suggest that circRNA-LONP2 regulates
ﬂow-dependent inﬂammatory responses.
The ability of circRNAs to act as a miRNA sink or
sponge, thus actively competing with miRNA targets,
has been demonstrated in several cardiovascular
systems.5,6 An MS2-RNA tagging strategy was used to
pull down miRNAs interacting with circRNA-LONP2;
among them, miR-200a-3p was particularly prom-
ising
and
was
further
characterized.
First,
the
phenotype
induced
by
miR-200a-3p
that
mimics
transfection in ECs was similar to that induced by
circRNA-LONP2
silencing.
Moreover,
miR-200a-3p
inhibition prevented the anti-inﬂammatory effects
of circRNA-LONP2 silencing. miR-200a-3p levels did
not
change
in
circRNA-LONP2
gain-
and-loss-of
function
or
under
LSS,
indicating
that
circRNA-
LONP2 inﬂammatory action is mediated by miR-
200a-3p interaction without affecting the expression
of the miRNA. This is an interesting mechanistic
detail because miRNA/circRNA interaction has often
been reported to lead to the decrease of miRNA
levels.5,6
Under normal conditions, NRF2 is retained in the
cytoplasm
by
kelch-like
Ech-associated
protein
1
(KEAP1), which triggers NRF2 proteasomal degrada-
tion. Upon ECs exposure to LSS, NRF2 dissociates
from
KEAP1
and
translocates
into
the
nucleus,
inducing the expression of antioxidant genes and
inhibiting nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
of

B
cells
signaling
pathway
through
multiple mechanisms.
KEAP1
messenger
RNA
was
experimentally
demonstrated as a circRNA-LONP2 target; accord-
ingly,
miR-200a-3p
mimics
signiﬁcantly
down-
regulated KEAP1 and upregulated NRF2, indicating
that circRNA-LONP2 induced endothelial inﬂamma-
tion through a miR-200a-3p/KEAP1/NRF2 pathway in
humans.
The apolipoprotein E-deﬁcient (ApoE/) mouse
model
displays
impaired
lipoprotein
clearance
causing the increase of cholesterol ester-enriched
particles in the blood, which, in turn, facilitates the
development
of
atherosclerotic
plaques.
In
the
experimental model adopted by Wang et al,7 ApoE/
mice, 6 weeks after the partial ligation of the left
common carotid artery, developed a plaque-laden
area. The overexpression of circRNA-Lonp2 by an
endothelial-retargeted adeno-associated virus vector
9 under the control of the endothelial-speciﬁc Tie2
promoter expanded the plaque area, the neointima
size, and the lipid deposition. Moreover, the circRNA-
forced
expression
increased
the
proinﬂammatory
markers Vcam-1 and Icam-1 and the mononuclear
phagocytes marker Mac-3, whereas it reduced Nrf2
and Ho-1 without affecting the expression of Keap1.
Interestingly, circRNA-Lonp2 regulated Nrf2 expres-
sion in mice via an alternative pathway (present in
mice
and
humans).

showed
that
circRNA-Lonp2 regulated oxidative stress and endo-
thelial inﬂammation via a miR-200a-3p/Yap1/Ezh2
axis. The mechanistic redundancy of NRF2 regula-
tion by circRNA-LONP2 is indicative of the impor-
tance of the identiﬁed pathway upon shear stress.
The study limitations are well considered by the
authors, including the need for further investigations
to evaluate the potential role of RNA-binding proteins
in ﬂow-mediated circRNA-LONP2 expression. More-
over,
the
clinical
signiﬁcance
of
circRNA-LONP2
dysregulation needs to be investigated in humans.
However, this study constitutes a signiﬁcant ad-
vancement in the ﬁeld, being the ﬁrst to identify
an arterial ﬂow-sensitive circRNA with a role in
vascular remodeling, suggesting circRNA-LONP2 as a
potential antiatherosclerotic therapeutic target. This
is particularly relevant in the prospect of the rapidly
evolving ﬁeld of RNA therapy, exploring approaches
to target the circRNA back-splicing junction with
techniques such as RNA interference and antisense
oligonucleotides.9

HIGHLIGHTS

Using a U-Net–based pipeline, we
developed a computational tool called
CardioCount that allows for objective and
consistent scoring of nuclei counts in
microscopic images of cardiac tissue.
CardioCount is available to run either
through a Google Colab notebook or
locally by downloading from GitHub.

We used CardioCount to determine
whether reduced capillary density in the
failing heart is associated with CEC cell
loss or CM hypertrophy. We found that
CM and CEC nuclear density
proportionally decrease in the failing
heart, suggesting that vascular
rarefaction and CM hypertrophy are inter-
related.

We used CardioCount to conﬁrm prior
work suggesting the cardiac cell cycling in
the human heart is increased with
mechanical unloading. However, we did
not observe any change in cycling rates of
CMs or CECs after LVAD placement.

When cycling was present in failing
hearts, we found that individuals with
higher levels of CM cycling also had
higher levels of CEC cycling, suggestive of
coupled growth of CMs and CECs in the
adult human heart.

SUMMARY
The adult mammalian heart harbors minute levels of cycling cardiomyocytes (CMs). Large numbers of images
are needed to accurately quantify cycling events using microscopy-based methods. CardioCount is a new deep
learning–based pipeline to rigorously score nuclei in microscopic images. When applied to a repository of
368,434 human microscopic images, we found evidence of coupled growth between CMs and cardiac endo-
thelial cells in the adult human heart. Additionally, we found that vascular rarefaction and CM hypertrophy are
interrelated in end-stage heart failure. CardioCount is available for use via GitHub and via Google Colab for
users with minimal machine learning experience. (J Am Coll Cardiol Basic Trans Science 2024;9:674–686)

A
lthough the innate regenerative capacity of
the mammalian heart is limited, multiple
groups have identiﬁed a low, but present,
level of cardiomyocyte (CM) turnover in the adult hu-
man heart.1-4 While such a low level of cycling has
largely been considered insigniﬁcant, recent genetic
ablation experiments in adult mice suggest that rare
cycling
CMs
promote
functional
recovery
after
injury.5 However, the impact of CM cycling on human
cardiovascular outcomes is unknown.
Elegant transgenic, fate-mapping methods have
been developed to trace and quantify CM prolifera-
tion in adult mice and zebraﬁsh.5-8 However, such
methods are not feasible for assaying CM cycling in
the human heart. Traditional methods to quantify
cycling cells from human tissue sections require
manual curation of microscopic images. However, for
low-frequency events, such as CM cycling, manual
methods are often insufﬁcient. Because of the sheer
labor required to score thousands of images, manu-
ally curated assessments often lack the sensitivity to
identify subtle phenotypes and could be subject to
biases if readers are not sufﬁciently blinded. Not
surprisingly, there can be wide variance in the fre-
quency estimates of rare events such as CM cycling
from lab to lab.9 A potential solution is to apply
automated image segmentation routines to score mi-
croscopy images more quickly, reproducibly, and
objectively. Once computationally prohibitive, better
computing power has reinvigorated computer vision
by enabling deep learning methods. Deep learning has
subsequently been widely applied to various appli-
cations in biology, including image segmentation.10
However, these image analysis tools, although high-
ly accurate, can be sensitive to imaging conditions and
often require signiﬁcant computational resources.
To
address
these
issues,
we
developed
Car-
dioCount, a deep learning routine to score CM cycling
in the human heart. CardioCount is a U-Net–based
deep learning model with a ResNet50 backbone that
was previously utilized to identify solar panels from
drone imagery.11 CardioCount identiﬁes nuclei from
antibody-labeled ﬂuorescent images and can coloc-
alize nuclear objects from multiple image channels.
Inspired by the DeepLearning4Mic project, the soft-
ware can run on Google Colab’s cloud resources and
score thousands of images with few local computa-
tional tools.12 We show that CardioCount is highly
versatile and can be adapted to different image
acquisition setups and to different species via trans-
fer learning. To demonstrate the functionality of our
deep learning model, we used CardioCount to assay
10,305 mm2 of human cardiac tissue obtained from
patients with and without end-stage heart failure
(HF), including some who received left ventricular
assist devices (LVADs). Using this tool, we conﬁrm
that loss of capillary density marks end-stage HF, but
vascular rarefaction results from the proportional
changes of cardiac endothelial cells (CECs) and CMs.
Additionally, we demonstrate that as in zebraﬁsh and
mice, CM cycling is coupled with CEC cycling in the
human heart.

METHODS
HUMAN CARDIAC SAMPLES. Human tissue samples
were obtained from the Duke Human Heart Re-
pository.13 Heart tissue was collected from unused
donor hearts without HF (control hearts), from pa-
tients with end-stage HF who underwent LVAD im-
plantation (pre-LVAD), and from LVAD recipients
who underwent LVAD explantation (post-LVAD).
HISTOLOGY
AND
IMMUNOSTAINING. Cryosections
of fresh, frozen, human cardiac tissue were ﬁxed with
4% paraformaldehyde, washed and permeabilized
with 0.1% Tween (phosphate-buffered saline and
Tween [PBST]), and subjected to heat-induced anti-
gen retrieval with citrate buffer. After additional
washing with PBST, the samples were blocked with
5% bovine serum albumin for an hour and incubated
overnight with primary antibodies. Samples were
then washed with PBST and incubated with second-
ary antibodies and DAPI (1:5,000) for 1 hour. Cry-
osections from neonatal mouse hearts were processed
as previously described.14 Primary antibodies used
for this work included: anti-PCM1 (Sigma-Aldrich,
HPA023370, 1:100); anti-Erg (Abcam, ab92513, 1:25);
anti-CD31 (BD Bioscience, 553370, 1:100), anti-Ki67
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, 4-5698-82, 1:100), anti-
Tnnt (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, CT3,
1:25),
and
anti-Cre
(Cell
Signaling
Technologies,
15036, 1:50). Secondary antibodies were conjugated to
Alexa-488 (Invitrogen, A21208, 1:1000), Alexa-594
(Invitrogen, A11037, 1:200), Alexa-633 (Invitrogen,
A21052, 1:200), or Alexa-647 (Invitrogen, A21472,
1:200). To ensure quality control within each staining
batch, a human colon tissue sample was included as a
positive control for anti-Ki67 immunostaining.
MICROSCOPY. Stained
human
tissue
samples
were imaged with a Zeiss CSU-X1 spinning disk
confocal microscope or a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal mi-
croscope. Stained murine sections were imaged with
a Zeiss CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal microscope, a
Zeiss AxioImager M1 epiﬂuorescent microscope, or a
Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope.
DEVELOPMENT OF CardioCount. Images (N ¼ 1,333)
stratiﬁed across all patients were manually curated
for ground truth by generating ground truth masks
with Fiji/ImageJ (330 images for the Erg model, 330
images for the PCM1 model, and 667 images for the
Ki67 model).15 Ten percent of the annotated data set
was set aside for testing, 70% was used for training,
and the last 20% was held for validation and hyper-
parameter selection. Raw RGB images (red: Erg or
PCM1 for cell identity of CECs or CMs respectively,
green: Ki67 for cell cycling, blue: DAPI for nuclei)
were converted to 2 channel images (either RB to
train the Erg and PCM1 models, or GB to train the Ki67
model). Two channel images and their corresponding
ground truth masks were used to train a U-Net–based
convolutional neural network (CNN), as described
previously.11,16
After training CNNs for each marker, the entire
data set of 368,434 images was passed through each
model. The probability map outputs from the CNN for
these images were converted to object maps through
a postprocessing pipeline by binarizing the images,
grouping positive pixels into objects, and assigning a
conﬁdence score to each object. An object conﬁdence
threshold score was used to classify each object as a
true positive (TP), false positive (FP), or false negative
(FN) based on an intersection over union of 0.2
calculated
as
TP/(TPþFPþFN).
Precision
(TP/
[TPþFP]), and recall [TP/(TPþFN)] were
used to
determine the F1 score (2TP/[2TPþFPþFN]), which
was used to measure model accuracy and was calcu-
lated for each set of hyperparameters on the valida-
tion set. Hyperparameters that were tuned included:
architecture type, learning rate, class weight ratio,
loss weights, and the ratio between loss weights.
Final models were selected by the highest F1 score on
the validation set. To colocalize nuclear objects and
identify double-positive cells, nuclei of Ki67þ cells
were ﬁltered by the presence of a centroid of an Erg or
PCM1 nucleus within the borders of the Ki67þ nu-
cleus. All code scripts are available on GitHub.
MURINE
CARDIAC
SAMPLES. Cardiac
tissue
from
neonatal mice was collected and processed as previ-
ously described.14 For AAV experiments, neonatal ICR
mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1011 vg of
AAV.cc47
encoding
Cre
recombinase
carrying
pAAV.cTNT.iCre.17,18 Neonatal hearts were collected
9 days after injection. pAAV.cTNT.iCre was a gift from
William Pu (Addgene plasmid # 69916).
ADAPTATION OF CardioCount TO MURINE CARDIAC
IMAGES. CNNs
for
murine
cardiac
images
were
initially trained using optimized hyperparameters
and model weights from the corresponding human
data set. A total of 50 murine images were annotated
and used as input. Five images were held out for the
test set, while the training and validation sets were
split in a 7:2 ratio. For transfer learning, a learning
rate sweep was performed for the encoder (1E-2, 5E-3,
2.5E-3,
1E-3,
5E-4,
2.5E-4,
1E-4,
and
5E-5).
The
learning rate for the decoder was set as 10 times that
of the encoder. Following the learning rate sweep, a
class weight ratio sweep was performed with various
background-to-foreground ratios (1:500, 1:250, 1:100,
1:50, 1:25, 1:10, 1:5, 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1). Postprocessing

was done as described for the human nuclear seg-
mentation pipeline. The optimal model on the vali-
dation set was then run on the testing set for the
F1 statistics.
DEVELOPMENT OF AREA SEGMENTATION PIPELINE.
To compute tissue area for nuclear density calcula-
tions, we developed an area calculation algorithm
that calculates percent tissue coverage, deﬁned as the
number of pixels covered by tissue divided by the
total number of pixels in the image. Segmentation
and calculation of percent tissue coverage in images
were calculated using an algorithm developed using
the scikit-image, NumPy, and OpenCV libraries in
Python.19-21 First, images were normalized by multi-
plying
pixels
by
255
and
dividing
by
the
95th
percentile of the pixel in the thresholded image, un-
less the image was considered a background image
(more than 97% of pixels are near black). A series of
dilation, area closing, binary erosion, area opening,
binary dilation, binary erosion, area opening, and
area closing was used in sequence to obtain the
segmented image. Human veriﬁcation of a set of
random samples was conducted to ensure the areas
calculated were appropriate.19-21
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Continuous data are pre-
sented as mean  SD or median with 25th and 75th
percentiles (Q1-Q3). Statistical analyses between un-
paired data were conducted using Welch’s t-test for
normally distributed data or a Wilcoxon rank sum test
otherwise. Shapiro-Wilk’s test was used to evaluate
data distribution. Categorical data are presented as
count (%) and were analyzed using the Fisher exact
test. Paired data were analyzed by ﬁtting generalized
additive models with random effects. Pearson’s cor-
relation coefﬁcient (r) was used to evaluate the as-
sociation between continuous variables using linear
regression. If data were not log scalable due to zero-
valued datapoints, a small positive constant was
added to each datapoint to ensure normally distrib-
uted axes after log transformation. Statistical ana-
lyses
and
plot
generation
were
performed
in
R
software (R Project for Statistical Computing) using
the dplyr, ggpubr, ggplot2, and mgcv packages.22-25
An a priori P value <0.05 was used to determine
statistical signiﬁcance.
STUDY APPROVAL. All human subjects research was
approved by the Duke University Medical Center
Institutional Review Board (Pro00005621). Informed
consent was obtained for all subjects. All animal
studies were approved by the Duke University Insti-
tutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

CYCLING
CELLS IN THE HUMAN HEART. Based on the low rates
of CM cycling previously reported, we reasoned that
large amounts of cardiac tissue would need to be
assayed to determine whether intrinsic rates of CM
cycling vary between individuals. We leveraged the
Duke Human Heart Repository, a bank of cardiac tis-
sue specimens that contains tissues from individuals
with various etiologies of HF as well as nonfailing
cardiac
tissue
samples.13
Baseline
characteristics
for
the
population

are
provided
in
Supplemental Table 1. We assayed a total of 12 non-
failing control hearts and 32 hearts from patients
undergoing LVAD implantation for end-stage HF
(Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Figure 1). Pa-
tients with HF were age matched to patients without
HF, with an average age of 54.1  9.7 years for the 32
HF patients and 53.6  8.7 years for the patients
without HF. In general, patients with HF had a lower
left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
(17.5%
[10.0%-
20.0%] vs 55.0% [55.0%-62.5%]; P < 0.001, Wilcoxon
rank sum test), had larger left ventricular diameters
as measured by left ventricular internal end-diastolic
diameter (6.60 [5.90-6.85] cm vs 4.50 [4.48-4.58] cm;
P < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test), and were more
likely to have type II diabetes mellitus (56.3% vs
8.3%; P ¼ 0.006, Fisher exact test). On average, pa-
tients with LVADs were diagnosed with HF 4.9  5.8
years before LVAD implantation.
From each individual, we immunostained cry-
osections with PCM1 to mark CM nuclei, Erg to mark
CEC nuclei, and Ki67 to mark cycling nuclei.2,26,27 In
total, we imaged 83.1  36.9 mm2 of cardiac tissue per
individual, for a total of 10,305 mm2 across 368,434
images. To score such a large number of images, we
developed a customized U-Net–based deep learning
algorithm based on prior work used to identify solar
panels from satellite images (Figure 1).11 Broadly, we
established an approach to identify speciﬁc types of
nuclei by colocalization of a cycling marker with a
cell-type speciﬁc nuclear marker. We adapted this
framework to develop speciﬁc models for resolving
PCM1þ CM nuclei, Ergþ CEC nuclei, and Ki67þ cycling
nuclei. As ground truth for model training and vali-
dation, we manually curated a library of 1,333 images
(330 images for Erg, 330 images for PCM1, and 667
images for Ki67). Seventy percent of each data set was
used for model training, with 20% set aside for vali-
dation and hyperparameter testing and 10% held out
for ﬁnal model F1 score statistics. Training data were

passed through a U-Net CNN to determine model
weights and to generate probability maps of nuclei
locations. Raw probability maps were then converted
into nuclei objects. Models were optimized based on
precision-recall curves and tuned by sweeping across
hyperparameters for learning rate, loss weights, loss-
weight ratio, and class-weight ratio (Supplemental
Figure 2A). Final models for identifying CM, CEC,
and cycling nuclei achieved F1 scores of 0.85, 0.86,
and
0.89,
respectively
(Figure

MYOVASCULAR
RATIO

LARGELY
MAINTAINED
DURING
DISEASE. HF
is
a
progressive
disease,
marked
by
CM
hypertrophy
and
loss
of
CMs.
Numerous studies have cited vascular rarefaction, or
the loss of capillary density, as a marker of more
advanced
disease.28-30
However,
whether
this
decrease in capillary density is associated with CEC
loss or CM hypertrophy has yet to be resolved. To
address this outstanding question, we used Car-
dioCount to compare CEC and CM densities from pre-
LVAD implantation HF samples to control samples.
CEC and CM densities were computed by dividing
nuclei counts by tissue areas calculated by a custom
area segmentation pipeline. As expected, based on
the CM hypertrophy known to occur in HF (Figures 2A
and 2B), the density of CM nuclei was decreased by
w33% in samples from patients with HF (135.1 [102.0-
155.5]
CM
nuclei/mm2
vs
201.5
[181.6-229.3]
CM
nuclei/mm2; P < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test)
(Figure 2C). When we evaluated CECs, we noted a
similar decrease in nuclear density, with a w54.8%
decrease in patients with HF compared with control
patients (306.1  60.9 CECs/mm2 vs 138.2  61.2
CECs/mm2;
P
<
0.001,
2-sided
unpaired
t-test)
(Figure 2D). Based on the overall similarity in this
decline, we compared the ratio of CEC/CM nuclei
across patients. Patients without HF had largely the
same ratio as those with HF (1.45  0.46 CECs/CM vs
1.16  0.53 CECs/CM; P ¼ 0.123, 2-sided t-test)
(Figure 2E), indicating that vascular rarefaction is
either secondary to CM hypertrophy or due to a
proportional loss of CECs and CMs. However, we
noted a wider spread in the CEC:CM ratio among
patients with HF compared with control patients,
suggesting heterogeneity in the CEC:CM ratio within
HF patients. When we evaluated which clinical fac-
tors might be related to CEC:CM ratio, only N-termi-
nal
pro–B-type
natriuretic
peptide
(NT-proBNP)
levels—a marker clinically used to mark ventricular
stress and identify HF patients at high risk31,32—were
signiﬁcantly correlated, with a decrease of 0.562
CECs per CM per doubling of NT-proBNP (r ¼ 0.547;
P ¼ 0.007) (Figure 2F).
MYOVASCULAR
DYNAMICS
ON
LVAD
SUPPORT.
LVADs are surgically implanted pumps that improve
survival in patients with advanced HF. Blood is drawn
into the LVAD from the left ventricle through an
inﬂow cannula and propelled into the aorta, effec-
tively decompressing the left ventricle. In select
patients, LVADs have been associated with reverse
remodeling and recovery of ventricular function.33
Histologically, LVAD support leads to regression of
CM hypertrophy and increased capillary density.34
Because our samples from the LVAD cohort were
collected at the time of LVAD insertion, we had a
unique opportunity to use CardioCount to evaluate
myovascular dynamics after LVAD support in in-
dividuals by also assaying LVAD explanation sam-
ples from the same individual. We
obtained 20
matched pre-LVAD and post-LVAD cardiac tissue
samples
from
the
same
patient
along
with
an
additional 5 unmatched pre-LVAD tissue samples and
7 unmatched post-LVAD tissue samples. On average,
sex, age, race, and heart size measured by left ven-
tricular internal end-diastolic diameter were consis-
tent. However, post-LVAD patients compared with
pre-LVAD
patients
had
lower
NT-proBNP
levels
(3,550  4,040 pg/mL vs 11,300  14,600 pg/mL)
(Supplemental Table 2).
Consistent with prior work, we found that LVAD
support resulted in an increase in the density of
CM nuclei (126.6  39.3 CMs/mm2 vs 177.7  50.9
CMs/mm2; P < 0.001, 2-sided paired t-test) and the
density of CEC nuclei (138.2  61.2 CECs/mm2 vs 222.1
 116.8 CECs/mm2; P ¼ 0.002, 2-sided paired t-test)
(Figures 3A to 3D).34 We did not observe any changes in
CEC:CM ratio with LVAD support (1.16  0.53 CECs/CM
vs 1.27  0.59 CECs/CM) (Figure 3E).
Although CMs in the postnatal mammalian heart
have largely exited the cell cycle, recent work has
measured a low, but present, rate of CM turnover in
the adult human heart,1 including a recent report that
the rate of CM cycling increases with LVAD support.4
Thus, we sought to characterize cellular cycling in our
cohort by colocalizing Ki67þ nuclei with CECs and CM
nuclei. Overall, we found evidence for rare cycling
CMs and CECs either before or after LVAD support
(Figures 4A to 4D). However, we noted considerable
heterogeneity among patients with regards to CM and
CEC cycling. We have recently described that coupled
expansion of CMs and CECs is required for cardiac
growth
and
regeneration
in
neonatal
mice.14
To
determine whether CEC and CM cycling might be

coupled in the adult human heart, we regressed CEC
and CM cycling rates for each patient. We found a
modest correlation between CM cycling rate and CEC
cycling rate (r ¼ 0.59; P ¼ 0.002) (Figure 4E), with a
doubling in CEC cycling rate corresponding to a 1.47-
fold increase in CM cycling rate, suggesting that
coupled expansion of CECs and CMs also occurs in
diseased human hearts.
TRANSFER LEARNING ALLOWS CardioCount TO BE
GENERALIZED TO OTHER DATA SETS. Because our
models for CMs, CECs, and cycling cells have the
same underlying architecture and perform similarly
despite different staining morphologies, we reasoned
that our models could be repurposed for additional
applications using transfer learning. We ﬁrst assayed
the ability to score neonatal mouse hearts, which
have smaller nuclear morphology and higher cell
density than human myocardial tissue. Starting with
the machine learning models trained on the human
data set, we tuned the model hyperparameters with
limited training/validation sets of neonatal mouse
heart
images
(Figures
5A
to
5C,
Supplemental
Figure 3). Combined training and validation set sizes
of 0, 10, 15, 30, and 45 were used to train the model,

whereas a testing set of 5 images was used to evaluate
the transfer learning trained model. As expected, the
model without transfer learning performed consis-
tently worse than the other models; however, we did
see a plateau in F1 score improvement after a transfer
learning data set size of 15 images (Figure 5B). The
neonatal mouse Erg data set consisted of images with

To enhance use, we developed an easy-to-use user
interface for CardioCount in Google Colab, a free,
cloud-based notebook environment that provides GPU
access and directly integrates with Google Drive. The
Google Colab implementation of CardioCount is aimed
towards users with minimal machine learning experi-
ence or command line expertise. Users can upload
their images to Google Drive and directly run the pre-
viously described human or mouse models on data sets
through the Google Colab interface. Users can also
perform transfer learning or train machine learning

models from scratch without the need for any software
setup on their local computers. One caveat to using the
software is that it remains limited by Google’s resource
partitioning, including memory and computational
resources. The Google Colab CardioCount software
works optimally for smaller image sets where fewer
computational resources are needed to process the
images. The full code scripts needed to run the ma-
chine learning pipelines on larger data sets are avail-
able on GitHub and can be implemented locally.
DISCUSSION
Assays
of
cellular
cycling
and
proliferation
are
fundamental for tissue regeneration research. Or-
gans, such as the heart, with low basal proliferation
rates are particularly problematic because an accurate
assessment of rare events requires surveying large
amounts of tissue to quantify enough events for ac-
curate estimates, much less to be able to compare
treatment effects. To address the need for automated
and accurate scoring of cellular cycling, we developed
CardioCount, a deep learning–powered pipeline to
score cells from antibody-labeled immunoﬂuorescent
cardiac tissue. We adapted a prior machine learning
platform used to identify solar panels from satellite
images to identify labeled nuclei. We were able to use
this framework to develop highly accurate models for
identifying and scoring CMs, CEC, and Ki67þ cells in
cardiac tissue sections with test set F1 scores of >0.85
on each of the 3 data sets. Our work differs from prior
machine learning approaches that identify CM nuclei
after immunostaining for sarcomeric proteins—spe-
ciﬁcally our models are based on nuclear markers and
enable colocalization of different immunostains.36
Our approach compares well with other prominent
deep learning and cell segmentation techniques such
as Cellpose, Mesmer, and CellProﬁler, which regularly
segment cells on data sets with F1 scores of 0.4 to 0.9
on general segmentation tasks with broad, diverse
data sets.37-40 Of note, our model assays CM cycling
and
cannot
differentiate
CM
proliferation
from
endocycling, which typically requires lineage tracing
approaches
or
cardiac
dissociation
to
determine
cellular ploidy.
To test the utility of our tool, we sought to address
a long-standing question regarding the cellular basis
for the vascular rarefaction that occurs in progressive
HF. Consistent with prior work, we were able to
identify decreases in both CM and CEC nuclear den-
sity in patients with HF. When we evaluated the
overall CEC:CM ratio, we did not observe signiﬁcant
differences between end-state HF and control hearts,
with approximately 1.2 to 1.3 CECs/CM, a ﬁgure that
compares
favorably
with
other
approaches1,41
(Figure 2). Our data suggest that vascular rarefaction
may be a marker of CM hypertrophy or an indicator of
proportional loss of CECs and CMs. However, we also
noted that the CEC:CM ratio is highly related to NT-
proBNP levels, a biomarker that clinically relates to
higher
ﬁlling
pressure
and
worse
prognosis
(Figure 2F). Thus, our work is also consistent with
prior studies suggesting that reduced coronary ﬂow is
related to worse HF and may further suggest that
individuals
with
extremely
elevated
NT-proBNP
levels might beneﬁt from mechanical or molecular
revascularization
approaches.
One
potential
confounder to our work is we assume that the pro-
portion of mononuclear (w74% in the normal heart)
and multinucleated CMs stays constant during HF.42
Finally, we evaluated cellular dynamics of mechani-
cal unloading with LVAD support. Unlike prior work,
we did not identify a signiﬁcant increase in CM
cycling after LVAD support (Figure 4). However,
different patient populations and different pump
management strategies might partially explain why
our results differ from prior work. Importantly, we
did note that CEC and CM cycling are associated in
the human heart, consistent with prior work in pre-
clinical
models
and
raising
the
possibility
that
revascularization strategies might be an important
adjunct
to
tissue
regeneration
approaches
(Figure 4E).14
Our goal was to establish a platform that could
broadly be used to score tissue sections. Towards that
goal, we have made our platform available using
Google Colab to minimize the entry barrier in terms of
computational resources and setup. We have also
developed a transfer learning module to enable users
to develop customized models for their own tissues of
interest and imaging setups. As proof of principle, we
applied our method to neonatal mouse section images
under different microscopy conditions and show that
our platform can be highly accurate even when
trained with a small number of training images uti-
lizing transfer learning. Overall, the use of accurate
and reproducible algorithms for image quantiﬁcation
has the potential to improve experimental rigor and
precision.
Although our models are highly promising, we
acknowledge several limitations. CardioCount is a
nuclei-based
model,
meaning
that
CM
counts

reported are only a proxy for the total number of CM
cells obtained in the images. For this reason, the
model works best on nuclear markers and may not be
readily transferable to other types of markers. Addi-
tionally, though we expect the general approach of
our model to work for other data sets, our models
were speciﬁcally trained on human and mouse car-
diac data and therefore may require larger amounts of
training data if transfer learning were to be applied to
noncardiac
contexts.
Finally,
our
Google
Colab
implementation of the machine learning training re-
mains limited by the hardware Google provides on its
free tier to Google Colab users. The Colab notebook
works optimally only on smaller image sets, and for
larger image sets, the scripts likely need to be run
locally.
CONCLUSIONS
We developed CardioCount, a deep learning–based
computational pipeline that can be used to segment
nuclei
and
count
cells
from
diverse
microscopy
setups. Using this tool on a large data set of human
myocardium, we were able to make unique observa-
tions regarding the composition of human cardiac
tissue, including coupled growth between CECs and
CMs, the lack of any association between LVAD sup-
port and CM cycling, and ﬁndings suggestive of
vascular rarefaction as a marker of CM hypertrophy.
CardioCount is publicly accessible via GitHub or
Google Colab, and we hope this platform can be
used
broadly
for
similar
applications
of
tissue
segmentation.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Cardiovascular
disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and understanding
cardiac tissue composition and cycling is essential for developing
effective therapies. Current methods to quantitatively assay
cardiac tissue composition by histology rely on manual scoring,
often limiting the amount of tissue that can be assayed. We built
a deep learning tool to score large amounts of cardiac tissue.
When applied to images of failing hearts, we ﬁnd that end-state
heart failure is associated with a decrease in capillary density, but
that this is proportional to changes in myocyte nuclear density.
We also show that there is coupled cycling of cardiac endothelial
cells with cardiomyocytes in the human heart, like our previous
observations in zebraﬁsh and mice. Taken together, we ﬁnd that
the cellular makeup of the failing heart is dynamic and provides a
resource for largescale histologic assessment of the heart.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: We developed an objective and
consistent machine learning model that can segment and count
nuclei in thousands of microscopic images. Tools like this will
allow for rigorous assessment of cardiac cell composition and
will allow for robust, and unbiased, estimates of rare events such
as cardiomyocyte cycling. This resource can enhance the rigor of
translational studies that rely on quantitative assessments of
cardiac tissue. Due to the generalizability of the CardioCount
framework, CardioCount may also be applied more broadly for
nuclear segmentation of tissue sections in other contexts.

EDITORIAL COMMENT
Deep Image Segmentation for
Cardiomyocyte Proliferation*
Md Abul Hassan Samee, PHD,a James F. Martin, MD, PHDa,b,c,d
T
he adult mammalian heart has limited regen-
erative capacity, which derives from the
long-lived nature of adult cardiomyocytes
(CMs). Indeed, CM renewal occurs at a minimal, albeit
measurable, level in the adult human heart.1 Investi-
gating whether CM renewal is associated with other
measures of improved cardiovascular outcomes is
challenged by the technical difﬁculty in accurately
quantifying CM cell division. Current methods for
counting CMs, although rigorous in the right hands,
are technically challenging and error prone. In mice,
the technical challenges are helped by advanced
transgenic fate-mapping techniques, which enable
more precise tracking and quantiﬁcation of CM divi-
sion but are obviously unavailable to human samples.
Manual
curation
can
compromise
sensitivity;
introduce potential bias; and, unsurprisingly, lead to
substantial
interlaboratory
discrepancies
in
CM
cycling estimates. One solution to these challenges
lies at the intersection of cardiovascular biology and
machine
learning.
The
exponential
growth
in
computational power and advancements in deep
learning–based image analysis have catalyzed the
adoption of automated image segmentation tech-
niques,
propelling
the
ﬁeld
toward
more
rapid,
reproducible, and unbiased analyses. In this issue of
JACC: Basic to Translational Science, Karpurapu et al2
have demonstrated some signiﬁcant advances in this
direction.
Karpurapu et al2 focused on the dynamics of
myovascular
cells,
speciﬁcally
CMs
and
cardiac
endothelial cells (CECs), in human heart failure and
after mechanical unloading by a ventricular assist
device.2 The authors developed CardioCount, a deep
learning–based pipeline for identifying nuclei from
antibody-labeled ﬂuorescent images and colocalizing
nuclear objects from multiple image channels. Car-
dioCount leverages the U-Net architecture3 with a
ResNet50
backbone.4
Brieﬂy,
the
U-Net
is
an
“encoder-decoder” architecture. First, an input image
is gradually down-sampled (reducing the spatial res-
olution) while maintaining necessary contextual in-
formation. This part of the model is called an encoder.
Next, from reduced images, a decoder restores the
spatial
resolution
and
combines
features
newly
discovered by the encoder to produce a “segmenta-
tion mask.” U-Net is a classical and widely adopted
convolutional
neural
network
architecture
for
biomedical image segmentation. Residual networks
have also been shown to work well for U-Nets. Thus,
CardioCount’s success is intuitive. As training data,
the
authors
manually
curated
the
segmentation
masks in about 1,000 images. These images used
speciﬁc markers to identify CM and CEC nuclei and
Ki67 to mark nuclei in the cell cycle. They applied the
trained model on w368,000 images obtained from the
Duke Human Heart Repository.
Karpurapu et al2 found an interesting coupling
between CMs and CECs in the adult human heart,
suggesting that the dynamics of these cell types are
inter-related in the heart failure samples. They found
that CM and CEC nuclear density in the failing heart
decrease proportionately, suggesting a biologic link
between vascular rarefaction and CM hypertrophy.
Furthermore, in failing hearts exhibiting cell cycling,

individuals with higher levels of CM cycling also had
higher levels of CEC cycling, supporting a coordinated
growth dynamic between CMs and CECs in the adult
human heart.
Overall, CardioCount is an impressive feat and an
important addition to the list of tools deploying deep
learning methods in cardiovascular research. Further
advancements will require addressing a few aspects
of the methodological approach and selecting best
practices. First, as the authors noted, manual cura-
tion is a source of bias, yet they started with manually
curated “ground truth” images. When multiple hu-
man annotators perform curation, which is preferred
to a single annotator, unavoidable variations are
introduced
into
the
model.
Uncertainty-aware
Bayesian segmentation approaches could help build
a
more
rigorous
model
in
these
cases.
Another
approach to minimize the variability is “scribble
segmentation.”5 Rather than drawing precise bound-
aries, human annotators draw small scribbles within
the objects of interest, and the model identiﬁes
boundaries. However, we acknowledge that address-
ing these issues is difﬁcult, and an optimal approach
probably does not currently exist.
We think the ﬁeld essentially needs “human-in-
the-loop artiﬁcial intelligence” in which human ex-
perts remain and iteratively improve models like
CardioCount. An initial model is trained using the
best available options and resources, but groups of
human experts continue providing feedback to the
model, and the model is retrained to incorporate that
feedback. Building a supportive framework for the
CardioCount user community will be crucial for the
tool’s success.
Another methodological concern is the limited
training data size, but in the future, researchers
following up on CardioCount can use generative
adversarial networks-based approaches.6 Thirdly, in
the current work, the authors could have offered a
more careful inspection of the cases in which Car-
dioCount “makes mistakes.” The model’s precision,
recall, and F1 score are satisfactory, but it is a missed
opportunity not to ask how the accuracy metrics
could be improved. Inspecting a model’s mistakes is
often a rewarding experience. It reveals the model’s
limitation and indicates if there is any fundamentally
challenging
aspect
of
the
data
that
requires
a
different type of model. Finally, although there is a
strong rationale for using U-Net, we think it is another
missed opportunity not to try alternative methods
such
as
Mask
R-CNN.7
Benchmarking
multiple
methods can reveal the relative strengths and weak-
nesses of the primarily chosen method and lead to a
better solution.
In conclusion, the community welcomes tools like
CardioCount. These tools can open new avenues for
therapeutic intervention and offer unprecedented
insights into the development and regeneration of
the human heart. Future studies will incorporate
improved statistical and machine learning method-
ologies and validate the ﬁndings of these tools.

Soluble Programmed
Death-1 Predicts Clinical
Outcome After STEMI
In the aftermath of ST-segment elevation myocardial
infarction (STEMI), an inﬂammatory response occurs,
and it is now considered an important prognostic
element and a predictor of mortality. Programmed
death (PD)-1 is an inhibitory receptor of the CD28
family and is expressed on antigen-activated T lym-
phocytes.
PD-1
inhibits
T-cell
receptor
kinase-
dependent signals after binding with its ligands.1 It
is
considered
as
a
checkpoint
protein,
down-
regulating effector T cells and maintaining immune
tolerance.2 We hypothesized that PD-1, through its
immune exhaustion function, may have a role at the
acute phase of STEMI. Our aim was to determine the
plasma level of soluble PD (sPD)-1 after STEMI and its
relation with infarct size and clinical events.
We conducted a prospective monocentric study
including 286 patients from 2016 to 2020. The study
was approved by our ethics committee (Hospices
Civils de Lyon, CPP Sud-Est-III). A cohort of STEMI
patients who underwent primary percutaneous cor-
onary intervention were included. Plasma samples
were collected and stored at –80C. We assessed
sPD-1 levels at 2 time points: discharge from hos-
pital (48 hours after admission) and 1 month. An
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems)
was used for analysis. Patients underwent cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging at 1 month in which
infarct size and left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF) were assessed. Clinical events were pro-
spectively collected. Statistical analyses were con-
ducted
by
using
GraphPad
Prism
version
10.2.0
(GraphPad).
The
Wilcoxon
signed
rank
test
(matched pairs) was used to compare sPD-1 levels at
different time points. Comparison of Kaplan-Meier
curves for the cumulative incidence of the com-
posite endpoint was performed by using the log-
rank test. A P value <0.05 was considered statisti-
cally signiﬁcant.
The mean age of the study cohort was 59  12
years; 53.2% had anterior MI. Median LVEF was 53%
(25th to 75th percentiles [Q1-Q3]: 46%-59%), and
infarct size was 14.0% of the left ventricle (Q1-Q3:
7.0%-23.2%). Median plasma sPD-1 levels were 183.8
pg/mL (Q1-Q3: 112.5-264.5 pg/mL) at discharge from
the hospital with a signiﬁcant increase 1 month after
STEMI
(244.4
ng/mL;
Q1-Q3:
154.3-364.7
ng/mL;
P < 0.001) (Figure 1A). No correlation between sPD-1
and
infarct
size
(r
¼ 0.02;
P
¼ 0.75)
or
LVEF
(r ¼ –0.04; P ¼ 0.55) was found at discharge. Similar
results were observed at 1 month. There were 28
major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) during
the 2 years of follow-up (7 MIs, 3 ischemic strokes, 14
hospitalizations for heart failure, and 4 all-cause
deaths). Patients with sPD-1 levels greater than or
equal to the median value (183.8 pg/mL) were more
likely to experience MACE at 2 years after STEMI (HR:
2.2; 95% CI: 1.05-4.6; P ¼ 0.045) (Figure 1B). In a
multivariate model including age, sex, creatinine ki-
nase peak, and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction
ﬂow, sPD-1 level at discharge greater than or equal to
the median value was an independent factor of
increased risk of adverse events (adjusted HR: 2.3;
95% CI: 1.01-5.1; P ¼ 0.048). Similarly, sPD1 levels
greater than or equal to the median value at 1 month
after STEMI was associated with an increased risk of
experiencing MACE in univariable and multivariable
models,
respectively
(HR:
4.0
[95%
CI:
1.5-11.1;
P
¼
0.02];
adjusted
HR:
3.5
[95%
CI:
1.1-11.3;
P ¼ 0.04]).
Myocardial injury after MI leads to the activation of
the immune system to promote tissue repair and
restore homeostasis. PD-1 is viewed as an immune
gatekeeper with studies describing its role in pre-
venting an uncontrolled inﬂammatory reaction.3 We
showed, for the ﬁrst time, that STEMI leads to an
increase
in
sPD1
plasma
level
between
hospital
discharge and 1 month. Our preliminary data suggest
that sPD1 plasma level in STEMI patients might be an
independent
prognosis
biomarker,
reﬂecting
the
magnitude of the T-cell inhibition process. These re-
sults are in line with previous data exploring the role
of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer therapies.4
It remains uncertain whether the measured sPD-1 was
biologically
active,
including
its
potential

SUMMARY
A central paradigm of cardiovascular homeostasis is that impaired nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability results in a wide array
of cardiovascular dysfunction including incompetent endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, thrombosis, vascular
inﬂammation, and proliferation of the intima. Over the course of more than a century, NO donating formulations such as
organic nitrates and nitrites have remained a cornerstone of treatment for patients with cardiovascular diseases. These
donors primarily produce NO in the circulation and are not targeted to speciﬁc (sub)cellular sites of action. However, safe,
and therapeutic levels of NO require delivery of the right amount to a precise location at the right time. To achieve these
aims, several recent strategies aimed at therapeutically generating or releasing NO in living systems have shown that
polymeric and inorganic (silica, gold) nanoparticles and nanoscale metal-organic frameworks could either generate NO
endogenously by the catalytic decomposition of endogenous NO substrates or can store and release therapeutically
relevant amounts of NO gas. NO-releasing nanomaterials have been developed for vascular implants (such as stents and
grafts) to target atherosclerosis, hypertension, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, and cardiac tissue engineering. In
this review, we discuss the advances in design and development of novel NO-releasing nanomaterials for cardiovascular
therapeutics and critically examine the therapeutic potential of these nanoplatforms to modulate cellular metabolism, to
regulate vascular tone, inhibit platelet aggregation, and limit proliferation of vascular smooth muscle with minimal toxic
effects. (J Am Coll Cardiol Basic Trans Science 2024;9:691–709) © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier on

espite the increasing use and sig-
niﬁcant advances made in inter-
ventional and surgical procedures,
cardiovascular disease (CVD) has remained a
major cause of morbidity and mortality glob-
ally for decades.1 The ageing population in
both developed and developing countries
has also led to a signiﬁcant rise in the preva-
lence of cardiovascular diseases. The endo-
thelium plays a crucial role in maintaining
vessel homeostasis, regulating the delicately
balanced
processes
of
vascular
tone
and
platelet
activation.
Vessel
homeostasis
is
maintained by the release of various vasoac-
tive factors from the endothelium. Vasoac-
tive factors can be vasodilatory, including nitric
oxide
(NO),
prostacyclin,
endothelium-derived
hyperpolarizing factor, or vasoconstrictive, including
thromboxane A2 and endothelin-1.2,3 NO is one of the
most
important
vasodilatory
factors
in
coronary
endothelium and is constitutively generated through
the conversion of L-arginine and molecular oxygen to
NO and L-citrulline catalyzed by the enzyme nitric
oxide synthase (NOS). The essential cofactor tetrahy-
drobiopterin is a key regulator of cellular redox
signaling
and
is
crucial
for
the
maintenance
of
vascular function, because tetrahydrobiopterin deﬁ-
ciency causes uncoupling of the NOS enzyme result-
ing in production of the superoxide anion radical
(O2
.) instead of NO.4 The 3 distinct isoforms of NOS
in mammals are neuronal NOS, inducible NOS, and
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).5 In the
vasculature, eNOS in endothelial cells is the primary
source of NO and is a crucial regulator of blood pres-
sure, cellular proliferation, and vascular tone. NO
continuously diffuses to vascular smooth muscle cells
where it stimulates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) to
produce cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP),
thereby activating protein kinase G, which then phos-
phorylates
multiple
target
proteins
resulting
in
smooth
muscle
relaxation
and
vasodilation.2,5
Neuronal
NOS,
the
main
endogenous
source
of
myocardial NO, regulates cardiac inotropy and relax-
ation, and modulates intracellular Ca2þ homeostasis
and signaling pathways including nitroso-redox bal-
ance.6 Hence, it is no surprise that low bioavailability
of NO critically drives the progression of CVD. A full
exploration of the critical roles of NO and the mecha-
nisms that regulate NO bioavailability in cardiovascu-
lar systems are beyond the scope of this review, but
these
topics
have
been
extensively
reviewed
elsewhere.5,7,8
NO down-regulates the expression of the pro-
thrombotic protein tissue factor and inhibits the gene
expression of adhesive proteins by endothelial cells,
thereby exerting anti-inﬂammatory effects by inhib-
iting the adhesion of leukocytes. NO also inhibits
mast cell activation and mast cell-dependent inﬂam-
matory events that contribute to destabilization of
the
atherosclerotic
plaque.9,10
NO
has
anti-
proliferative effects on smooth muscle cells (SMCs)
and
therefore
prevents
neointima
hyperplasia
in
response to injury.11 Thus, NO has wide-ranging vas-
oprotective, antiatherosclerotic, and antithrombotic
roles.11 Drugs that may release or produce NO locally
represent a signiﬁcant breakthrough for the control
and treatment of CVD. However, their overall success
is limited by the physicochemical properties of NO,
which as a diatomic gaseous molecule with one un-
paired electron, is highly reactive with free radical
oxygen-centered
species.12
Thus,
NO
has
a
high
diffusion rate, but a short biological half-life (in the
order of 0.5-5 seconds), thereby limiting the diffusion
distance to around 200 mm. NO can be rapidly
oxidized to highly toxic nitrogen dioxide in the
presence of molecular oxygen. Due to such limita-
tions, there is a growing interest in developing novel
formats for the controlled, predictable, and targeted
release of NO. Over the last few decades, different NO
delivery systems have been devised and investigated
in
the
form
of
NO
donors
(such
as
organic
nitrates,
nitrites,
thionitrites,
S-nitrosothiols
(RSNOs), N-diazeniumdiolates (NONOates), metal-NO
complexes,13,14
NO-releasing
nonsteroidal
anti-
inﬂammatory drugs,15 small molecule gas-releasing
prodrugs,16 peptides,17 proteins,18 polymeric mem-
branes,19 hydrogels,20 scaffolds, and nanoparticles
(silica, gold, liposomes, dendrimers, and so on)21 to
store and release NO in a controlled and therapeuti-
cally meaningful manner.
Among the previously listed approaches, nano-
particles
(NPs)
have
garnered
attention
recently
because of their remarkable features, which include
ultra-small size, high surface area, chemical reac-
tivity, and ease of functionalization. The storage and
release of NO by NPs heavily depends on these
fundamental features as well as the NO source. NPs
offer several advantages over conventional donor
drugs, such as the ability to control release rates and
to target speciﬁc sites of action. Targeted delivery of
NO-releasing NPs has been widely reviewed for can-
cer,22 antimicrobial,23 and medical devices24; how-
ever, the study of NO-releasing/generating NPs for
CVD is still in its infancy. In this review, we explore
the basic concept of NPs and their key characteristics
for use in biomedical applications. In particular, we
highlight recent developments in the ﬁeld of NO-
releasing/generating
NPs

controlled, and long-term release kinetics of NO along
with potential future directions.
CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF NO DONOR DRUGS
To provide context, we will ﬁrst brieﬂy discuss the
most clinically important NO interventions for the
treatment of CVD. At the simplest level, NO is used,
nonformulated, as a medical gas for the treatment of
pulmonary arterial hypertension and hypoxic new-
borns.25
Administration
by
inhalation
provides
selectivity, particularly because NO is rapidly inacti-
vated in blood, which minimizes systemic adverse
effects but also limits the utility of this approach for
other conditions.8
Low molecular weight organic nitrates, eg, glyceryl
trinitrate (GTN), have been in clinical use since the
1870s, although the NO-dependent mechanism was
not understood until the late 1970s.8 GTN releases 1
molar equivalent of NO upon activation by mito-
chondrial enzymes, and sublingual GTN has been
extensively
used
to
treat
acute
angina
pectoris
providing rapid relief of symptoms for a short dura-
tion. Other nitrates, such as isosorbide dinitrate and
isosorbide-5-mononitrate, are slower onset, but with
a prolonged duration of action making them more
suitable for angina prophylaxis (eg, via oral or trans-
dermal delivery).26
Nitrates are also used in the treatment of heart
failure, because they cause vasodilation, thereby
reducing venous return, unloading the heart and
increasing stroke volume.27 The combined use of oral
isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine has been shown
to improve cardiac function and survival in patients
with chronic congestive heart failure,28 particularly in
African-American patients, in whom NO bioavail-
ability may be disproportionately impaired.29 Intra-
venous nitrates may also be used for the treatment of
acute heart failure to alleviate pulmonary congestion.
However, caution is required in conditions where
excessive cardiac unloading may result in hypoten-
sion, eg, left ventricular hypertrophy and severe
aortic stenosis.27
Continuous administration of virtually all organic
nitrates results in gradual loss of efﬁcacy because of a
complex and multifaceted phenomenon termed ni-
trate tolerance (reviewed by Munzel et al30). Classi-
cally, this is observed as a rebound effect, whereby
withdrawal of nitrates results in anginal symptoms
that are worse than before treatment. Hence, dosing
regimens for angina typically incorporate a nitrate-
free period (eg, overnight) to minimize tolerance,
but
with
the
commensurate
loss
of
24-hour
protection.
Multiple
mechanisms
are
likely
to
contribute
to
nitrate
tolerance;
these
include
impaired
enzymatic
drug
activation
resulting
in
reduced NO production, and nitrate resistance caused
by desensitization of the sGC signaling pathway.31,32
Another key contributor is nitrate pseudotolerance,
which arises from overcompensation by neurohor-
monal pathways in response to sustained vasodila-
tion,
eg,
increased
sympathetic
stimulation,
activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone sys-
tem, and increased sensitivity to endogenous vaso-
constrictors. It is likely that an increase in oxidative
stress underpins many of these mechanisms, with
nitrate treatment shown to increase production of
superoxide anion via nicotinamide adenine dinucle-
otide phosphate oxidases and mitochondria. This
superoxide
rapidly
reacts
with
NO,
effectively
reducing NO bioavailability, but also forming perox-
ynitrite (ONOO), which promotes NOS uncoupling
and a vicious cycle of more superoxide generation. In
addition, superoxide and peroxynitrite inhibit sGC in
smooth muscle cells and reduce generation of the
vasodilator prostacyclin.30,33 Hence, the administra-
tion of organic nitrates that also have antioxidant
activity (eg, pentaerythritol tetranitrate) or in com-
bination with antioxidant compounds may be partic-
ularly
advantageous.
Common
but
debilitating
adverse effects such as headache and hypotension
also limit the use of nitrates with severity varying
dependent on pharmacokinetic proﬁle and vascular
selectivity.30
Other
associated
classes
of
drug
augment
NO
signaling, eg, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, which
increase
cGMP
levels
by
preventing
enzymatic
degradation, or Vericiguat, which stimulates soluble
guanylate cyclase
to restore cGMP levels. These
agents may have utility in circumventing nitrate
tolerance by improving NO sensitivity alongside the
use of neurohormonal inhibitors to combat pseudo-

convert it to nitrite, which in turn can be reduced to
NO in blood and tissues via a variety of mechanisms.5
NO-RELEASING COMPOUNDS IN DEVELOPMENT
Over the past few decades, NO donors and precursors,
such
as
diazeniumdiolates
(NONOates),
S-nitro-
sothiols (RSNOs), and arginine, have emerged as
potent enhancers of NO signaling. The chemical
structures of the most commonly used NO donors are
shown in Figure 1. Among these, NONOates are
commonly studied because of their capability to
release NO rapidly under physiological conditions
(37 C, pH 7.4). NONOates are adducts of NO dimer
bound to nucleophilic residue via a nitrogen atom.
When hydrolyzed, they release 2 molar equivalents of
NO per mole of donor,35 and the release rate can be
precisely controlled from seconds to days by chang-
ing the amount and degree of both hydrogen bonding
and amine precursors.
RSNOs represent the addition of NO to a cysteine
peptide via a S-NO bond. They can be low or high
molecular weight depending on the “R” group, which
will therefore greatly inﬂuence the biological prop-
erties. RSNOs can be endogenous or laboratory syn-
thesized and act as NO donors and/or mediators of
NO-signaling via post-translational modiﬁcation of
proteins. Important examples include S-nitroso-N-
acetylpenicillamine
(SNAP),
S-nitrosoalbumin,
S-nitrosohemoglobin, S-nitrosocysteine, and S-nitro-
soglutathione (GSNO).36,37 RSNOs do not undergo
spontaneous release of NO because of the low energy
S─NO bond (z150 kJ mol1).38 However, NO release
can be facilitated in several ways: 1) transition metal
ion-mediated catalysis (eg, by Cuþ); 2) interactions
with ascorbate; and 3) photocatalysis.39
Despite the clinical utility of low molecular weight
NO donors, they have a number of limitations, eg,
their stability under biologically relevant conditions
and limited NO payloads. NO release is typically un-
controlled and nonspeciﬁc, limiting the delivery of

address
these
clinical
challenges,
low
molecular
weight NO donors can be conjugated or loaded to a
variety of nanoparticles for targeted, controlled, and
sustained delivery of NO.
NANOMATERIALS AND THEIR
FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES
Nanomaterials are very small-scale chemical sub-
stances, typically 1 to 100 nm in at least 1 dimension.
Nanomaterials can be classiﬁed based on their origin
(natural
or
synthetic/engineered),
composition
(organic,
inorganic),
size,
or
applications
(bio-
materials, electronic materials, magnetic materials).40
NPs are further classiﬁed by dimensions, such as zero-
dimensional (eg, quantum dots),41 1-dimensional (eg,
nanotubes, nanorods),42 2-dimensional (eg, graphene,
boron
nitride,
molybdenum
disulﬁde),
or
3-
dimensional (eg, foam, aerogels, hydrogels, poly-
meric nanocomposites).43 The archetypal examples of
organic NPs are polymeric, dendrimer, liposomes, and
lipid NPs, whereas the archetypal examples of inor-
ganic NPs are mesoporous silica NPs, quantum dots,
carbon nanotubes, and metal-organic frameworks
(MOFs) (Figure 2).
Engineered
nanomaterials
are
designed
and
assembled to optimize interactions with functional
payloads and to take advantage of the unique prop-
erties of their ultra-small size and high surface-to-
volume
ratios.
These
result
in
high
chemical
reactivity
and
quantum
conﬁnement
effects,40
whereby the motion of electrons is restricted to spe-
ciﬁc energy levels, which signiﬁcantly enhances op-
tical, electrical, and magnetic properties.44,45 Thus,
NPs possess physicochemical and mechanical prop-
erties that are unique and tuneable.46
Nanomaterials are generally prepared by 2 main
wet chemical methods: the top-down and bottom-up
approaches. The top-down approach involves the
decomposition of larger precursors into smaller units,
and then these units are converted into NPs. Typical
examples of this approach are grinding,47 chemical
vapor deposition,48 or physical vapor deposition.49
The bottom-up approach, also known as the “build-
ing-up” approach, involves the disintegration of a
molecular precursor into smaller constituent parts
that are then grown into colloids. Typical examples of

this approach are chemical reduction,50 the sol-gel
method,51 biochemical synthesis,52 and spinning.53
To date, a large number of nanomaterials have been
used in a wide variety of commercial applications
including
sunscreens,
cosmetics,
sporting
goods,
stain-resistant clothing, tires, and electronics, as well
as in medicine.
Polymeric NPs can be assembled to precisely con-
trol drug release, and they have good biocompati-
bility.
Different
drugs
and
biomolecules
can
be
incorporated into the core of NPs, which are conju-
gated to a polymeric matrix or nanoﬁber. The conju-
gation of particles with polymers improves their drug
loading efﬁcacy for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic
molecules. Such NPs can be further classiﬁed into
different
morphologies such
as micelles
or
den-
drimers, which are highly branched, highly symmet-
rical, tree-like macromolecules also referred to as
hyperbranched polymers.54 Dendrimers have widely
been reported to have high drug storage capacity and
to transport the drug with minimal toxicity to normal
cells.55 Liposomes have been one of the most widely
used
nanocarriers
because
of
their
multilayered
morphologies that are largely adaptable to cellular
environments56 and the layered morphologies also
allow rapid cell inﬁltration.57 Excellent biocompati-
bility and biodegradability, as well as an inert nature,
make liposomes a viable nanocarrier material without
further modiﬁcations. Liposomal formulations have
been reported as drug carriers for the controlled
release
of
biomolecules
and
some
have
been
approved
for
clinical
applications,
eg,
liposomal
amphotericin is used to reduce side-effects.
Inorganic NPs, such as silica, silver, gold, iron, ti-
tanium, carbon nanotubes, and graphene, have been
developed in a wide variety of sizes and shapes and
have also been utilized for drug delivery, light-
mediated therapeutics (photodynamic therapy and
photothermal
therapy),
and
diagnostics
(cardiac
magnetic resonance, ﬂuorescence imaging). Among
the new class of nanomaterials, MOFs, comprising
metal ions coordinated to organic linkers to form 1-,
2-, or 3-dimensional structures, have also received
attention because of their exceptionally high speciﬁc
surface area, tunable surface chemistry, and ease of
functionalization with biomolecules.58
The ease of chemical modiﬁcation on the surface
of NPs facilitates the tailoring of the storage/release
capacity, ﬂux, and duration of NO. An early study on
the development of NO-releasing materials was re-
ported by Larry Keefer and his team59 where they
used a polymeric matrix for the storage of NO (in the
form of N2O2
) to adjust the time course of NO
release. Organic NPs largely comprise polymeric NPs,
micelles, liposomes, dendrimers, nanoﬁber compos-
ites,
and
hydrogels.60
Typical
examples
of
NO-releasing inorganic NPs are metallic NPs (gold,61
silver,62 copper63), mesoporous silica,64 zeolites,65
and MOFs.66 An early study on the therapeutic
potential
of
NO-releasing
NPs
in
CVD
was
reported by Taite and West67 in 2006. They used
a
peptide
synthesis
approach
in
which
9-
ﬂuorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc groups) were used
to protect the N-terminus, thereby allowing the for-
mation
of
a
branching
structure
of
dendrimers.
Dendrimers prepared in this way were used for the
targeted release of NO over approximately 60 days
to control vascular SMC proliferation and inhibit
platelet adhesion to thrombogenic surfaces. In 2009,
Nishikawa
et
al68
fabricated
polysiloxane
NPs
(average size of 80 nm) by the reaction of sugar-
lactones
with
amine-functionalized
polysiloxane
and studied localized NO release triggered by poly-
siloxane
NPs
in
human
aortic
endothelial
cells,
revealing that NPs entered into cells via pinocytosis
vesicles and that the cellular uptake of NPs mediated
NO release, ie, that the enzymatic activity of eNOS
can be triggered by targeting caveolae with NPs.
STRATEGIES FOR NO RELEASING AND
GENERATING NANOMATERIALS
There are 2 major approaches to exploit the thera-
peutic release or generation of NO using NPs: cata-
lytic
and
noncatalytic.66
Within
the
catalytic
approach there are 4 main strategies:
1. Enzyme prodrug systems—In these systems, NO-
releasing prodrugs are immobilized onto the sur-
face of NPs for subsequent enzymatic activation.
For example, prodrugs that are converted in vivo
to spontaneous NO-releasing compounds via the
action of esterases69 or glycosylated NONOates
that are activated by endogenous b-galactosidase.
To provide greater tissue speciﬁcity, glycosylated
NONOates have been chemically modiﬁed so they
are only cleaved by a speciﬁc mutant galactosi-
dase. This mutant enzyme was implanted in tis-
sues within a hydrogel, such that systemic delivery
of glycosylated NONOate produced only local NO
generation.70
2. The attachment of transition-metal ions to NPs—
Endogenous
S-nitrosothiols
can
spontaneously
decompose to NO in a reaction that is catalyzed by
Cu2þ.71 Using this approach, Jiang et al72 reported
the generation of NO from a layer-by-layer struc-
ture of copper-loaded titanium nanotubes (average
diameter 30 nm).

3. Nanozymes—These are nanomaterial-based artiﬁ-
cial enzymes which effectively mimic the catalytic
sites of natural enzymes. They offer advantages in
terms of cost-efﬁcient synthesis, stability in bio-
logical media, and biodegradability (see special-
ized reviews for more on this topic73-75).
4. External stimuli—Several external stimuli, such as
light, ultrasound, and x-rays, have also been used
to achieve control over the NO release kinetics.
The NO release proﬁle from the donors can be
changed by varying the intensity of these stimuli.
There has been widespread interest in developing
such external stimuli responsive NO release in
cancer and infections; however, they have not
been explored for CVD (see specialized reviews for
more on this topic76,77). A few studies have re-
ported the catalytic generation of NO by incorpo-
rating nanozymes such as titanium dioxide ﬁlms,78
a copper-catecholic-selenocystamine framework,79
electrospun Cu-MOF NPs into poly(ε-caprolactone)
(PCL),80 and PCL-based vascular graft under the
catalysis of ascorbic acid.81
The
noncatalytic
approach
involves
chemical
modiﬁcation of NPs to store NO sources (eg, NO gas,
NONOates, SNAP) via encapsulation into the cavities
or surface, which is then released in tissues upon
interaction with moisture, light, or ultrasound. For
example, to achieve the controlled, slow, and sus-
tained release of NO, studies have demonstrated the
use of sequestered NO gas82 and of RSNOs using thiol
functionalized
dendrimers83
or
gadolinium-oxide-
based paramagnetic NPs.84 Because of their high
speciﬁc surface area, nanomaterials such as MOFs
have the ability to store the largest amounts of NO.
This storage capacity is also dictated by the type of
NO source, stability, and storage conditions. Hence,
leaching of the payload is a limitation when using low
molecular weight NO donors such as organic nitrates.
One unique approach has utilized magnetic NPs
complexed to lentivirus for targeted gene delivery of
eNOS speciﬁcally to endothelial cells (ECs). In an
initial study, aortic ECs were transfected under cell
culture conditions, such that they became strongly
magnetic and overexpressed functional eNOS pro-
tein. These cells were then administered into the
lumen of a perfused aorta where the endothelium had
been injured and a specially designed array of mag-
nets used to encourage EC recolonization in the
desired radial formation on the vessel wall. In both
ex vivo and in vivo experiments, improvements were
observed in endothelial layer regeneration and in
endothelial-dependent relaxation.85 Subsequent ex-
periments eschewed the cell therapy approach for
direct administration of lentiviral-magnetic NP com-
plexes to isolated perfused vessels. Application of the
magnetic ﬁeld was able to enhance contact time and
improve gene transfection efﬁciency without the
need to stop ﬂow, resulting in improved vascular
function.86 These strategies have the potential to
greatly improve targeting of gene therapy to the
damaged endothelium. However, transgenic eNOS
may still become uncoupled and dysfunctional if
there is an insufﬁcient supply of substrates and co-
factors in the damaged vessel.
Both catalytic and noncatalytic approaches offer
advantages and limitations (schematically shown in
Figure 3). For instance, low concentrations of endog-
enous NO substrates at diseased sites restrict the
clinical use of some catalytic approaches (eg, for the
prevention of restenosis). Similarly, the requirement
for continuous release of NO over extended periods,
such as days, weeks, and months, has not been fully
demonstrated using noncatalytic approaches. Table 1
summarizes the NO release proﬁles of various types
of nanoformulations for use in different cardiovas-
cular disease models.
APPLICATION OF NO-RELEASING AND
-GENERATING NANOPLATFORMS FOR
CARDIOVASCULAR THERAPEUTICS
CARDIOVASCULAR
STENTS. In the cardiovascular
ﬁeld, stents are the most widely investigated appli-
cation
for
NO-releasing
NPs.
Stents
are
inserted
following angioplasty and conventionally consist of a
metal expandable tubular mesh, which acts as a
scaffold to hold open the vessel and thereby maintain
blood ﬂow.87 Although a substantial improvement on
balloon angioplasty alone, bare-metal stents may
themselves induce vascular damage and inﬂamma-
tion
leading
to
thrombosis,
intimal
hyperplasia
(characterized by SMC proliferation and collagen
deposition), and renarrowing of the blood vessel, a
phenomenon known as in-stent restenosis.88 Reste-
nosis is most common within 12 months of stent im-
plantation when it affects up to 20% of patients.89 In
the last 2 decades this has been reduced to w2% by
the use of drug-eluting stents, eg, paclitaxel and
sirolimus analogues,90 which suppress local immune
responses and are potent inhibitors of SMC prolifer-
ation. These drugs are incorporated into a polymer
coating between 4 and 22 mm thick,89 from which they
are eluted at a controlled rate. However, issues
remain with drug-eluting stents, and the cumulative
risk of restenosis creeps up after the ﬁrst year because
of neoatherosclerosis, which is driven by a number of
factors, such as chronic inﬂammation and suboptimal

endothelialization, but also by hypersensitivity re-
actions to polymer components and ﬂow disturbances
caused by the stent itself, leading to platelet activa-
tion and stent thrombosis.91,92 Given that millions of
patients worldwide receive a stent annually, even a
1% to 2% restenosis rate is a sizeable problem, with
10% to 20% of these patients going on to develop
recurrent restenosis.89
It should be noted that the use of drugs to inhibit
SMC proliferation may also inhibit endothelial cell
adhesion and proliferation.92 Therefore, current ap-
proaches can be viewed as a double-edged sword.
Timely endothelialization of the vessel wall and the
stent
surface
is
important
because
a
healthy,
conﬂuent endothelial layer produces NO to reduce
vascular permeability, inﬂammatory cell activation,
platelet aggregation, and SMC hyperplasia.93,94 Mul-
tiple preclinical studies have shown that exogenous
NO promotes EC proliferation and migration, both in
cell culture and in response to vascular injury.95 In
part, this reﬂects an effect of NO to promote EC
survival
by
preventing
apoptosis,
via
both
cGMP-mediated
mechanisms
to
modulate
anti-
apoptotic protein kinases and by S-nitrosation of
caspases to prevent activation.96 Hence, an ideal
treatment would enhance healing and rapid endo-
thelialization as well as reduce SMC hyperproliferation
and thrombogenesis, which makes the use of stent
coatings that release or generate NO an attractive
proposition.
Stents are typically fabricated by laser cutting
stainless
steel,
titanium-nickel,
tantalum,
or
platinum–iridium alloys.92 Nanomaterial-based coat-
ings have been devised to release or generate NO in a
controlled
manner.
In
particular,
layer-by-layer
coating using polymers, polymeric NPs, and other
classes of NPs have the potential to extend the NO
release proﬁle from hours to days and weeks.60
Modifying the surfaces of cardiovascular implants to
release NO depends on the mechanical properties of
FIGURE 3

NO can be generated via catalytic decomposition of natural sources of NO using nanozymes. Nanozymes are NP-based artiﬁcial enzymes that
efﬁciently mimic the catalytic sites of naturally occurring enzymes. NO can also be delivered via incorporation of NO sources into
nanoparticles.

the materials, such as stiffness, hardness, mechanical
strength, viscoelasticity, shape memory behavior,
and surface chemistry, which in turn determine the
biological fate of such materials.97 The Seifalian lab-
oratory has pioneered the use of NO-releasing NPs for
stents and vascular grafts,98 demonstrating polymeric
NPs, nanoﬁbers, and hydrogels for the storage of
SNAP and GSNO and the controlled release of NO. The
results of these preclinical studies are discussed in
the following text and in the next section.
Elnaggar et al99 used a method based on layer-by-
layer deposition of liposomes (of sizes z120 and
20 nm) for the sustained release of NO from a modi-
ﬁed stent. They coated stents with liposomes (the
thickness of the layer was higher than z10 nm)
encapsulating NONOate, which was trapped between
layers of poly-l-lysine and hyaluronic acid–dopamine,
providing a NO release proﬁle of up to 5 days. In vitro
results using human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs) exhibited signiﬁcantly more endothelial
cell proliferation and distinctly inhibited SMC prolif-
eration. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis
of on-stent endothelial layer formation demonstrated
the
effects
of
NO
on
rapid
reendothelialization.
Studies in pigs demonstrated efﬁcacy in promoting
arterial
healing
and
preventing
neointimal
thickening.
Fan et al100 reported the immobilization of nano-
scale copper-based MOF (size range 10-500 nm) onto
the surface of a titanium stent using polydopamine as
a
coating
matrix,
thereby
allowing
the
copper-
catalyzed generation of NO from endogenous sour-
ces. Cu-MOF were prepared by conversion of Cu(OH)2
to
CuBTC
(BTC—1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic
acid)
through
an
acid
base
reaction.
Copper-catalyzed
generation of NO from the surface of modiﬁed 316 L
stainless stent resulted in suppression of platelet
aggregation via NO-cGMP signaling and considerably
reduced thrombosis in an ex vivo extracorporeal cir-
culation model (Figure 4), as well as reducing neo-
intimal hyperplasia in an arteriovenous shunt model.
However, this approach relies on a plentiful supply of
endogenous RSNO around the implanted stent, and
further optimization is required to generate thera-
peutically relevant amounts of NO at the site of ac-
tion. The efﬁcacy of in vivo endothelialization of this
copper-based MOF coating was demonstrated by the
formation
of
an
endothelial
layer
on
the
stent
(conﬁrmed by SEM) in comparison to the attachment
of red blood cells and platelets on the uncoated stent.
In a similar approach, a copper-catecholamine-
selenocystamine
framework
crosslinked
with
3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine was coated onto the
surface of a stainless-steel stent through a dip-
coating method by immersing the framework and
stent into the reaction solution (dissolving Dopa hy-
drochloride,
selenocystamine
hydrochloride,
and
CuCl2$2H2O in Tris buffer) at room temperature for
24 h. This framework facilitates the interface with
glutathione peroxidase (GPx) to promote catalytic
activity, thereby resulting in controlled and slow
release of NO from the coating.79 This conferred good
antithrombogenic activity, improved HUVEC migra-
tion, and inhibited proliferation of human umbilical
artery
smooth
muscle
cells
in
vitro,
as
well
as
improved antithrombogenicity, anti-restenosis, and
endothelialization in rats in vivo. The formation of an
endothelial layer on the stent surface was conﬁrmed
morphologically by SEM. Thus, effective suppression
of restenosis and promotion of reendothelialization
can be achieved by the continuous generation of NO
in a controlled manner with a copper-catecholamine
framework coated stent.
Microscale
polymeric
materials
or
ﬁbers
that
release or generate NO have also been explored for
stent applications. Examples include poly(lactic-co-
glycolic
acid)
(PLGA),101
poly(vinyl
alcohol)
and
poly(vinyl
pyrrolidone),102
thermoplastic
poly-
urethanes,103
poly(methyl
methacrylate),104
and
metallic thin ﬁlms including titanium dioxide,78 and
readers are referred to specialized reviews on this
topic.98,105,106 Such polymeric materials have shown
promising results on re-endothelialization, but have
limitations because of the accumulation of acidic
degradation by-products, which alter pH and NO
release kinetics. The NP approach advocated in this
review
provides
additional
beneﬁts
in
terms
of
tunable properties, ease of functionalization, and
high speciﬁc surface area to carry large quantities of
NO. It is notable that the release rate of NO from NP-
based stent coatings was similar to that of endothelial
cells, ie, in the range of 0.5 to 4.0  1010 mol cm2
min1.100
Despite
promising
results
using
NO-producing
stents in vitro and in animal models, the clinical
translation of this approach presents a number of
challenges and issues for further study. For example,
efﬁcacy may be limited by uneven distribution of
catalytic complexes, limited NO source reservoir or
NO-release kinetics, coating stability, biocompati-
bility, and, in particular, the potential formation of
toxic nitrosamines and peroxynitrite during degra-
dation.98 Formulations must also be stable during
storage and robust enough for percutaneous appli-
cation even in difﬁcult to reach vessels.

properties. However, the hydrophobicity of PCL may
induce thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia, for which
the protective effect of NO has been investigated.107
Seifalian et al98,107,108 have developed a class of
polymeric nanocomposites, such as polyhedral olig-
omeric silsesquioxane poly(carbonate-urea)urethane
(POSS-PCU), to modify a variety of surgical im-
plants, aimed at releasing NO in a targeted manner.
de Mel et al108 reported the incorporation of SNAP
and GSNO into POSS-PCU–based bypass grafts for the
in situ release of NO in the presence of pulsatile ﬂow.
This study revealed that NO release from POSS-PCU
helped
inhibit

SMC
adhesion

cell
adhesion
tested
in
endothelial progenitor stem cells and SMCs. The
release proﬁle reported in this study was 10 nmol/L
NO over the ﬁrst 10 minutes with a continuous
diminution up to day 7. Clearly, a longer duration of
NO release from vascular grafts would be desirable.
Zhan et al80 investigated the potential of electrospun
Cu-MOF NPs (average size 438 nm) into PCL. MOF
NPs were prepared by the reaction between organic
molecules and metal ions, and vascular scaffolds
were prepared by electrospinning PCL and MOF NP
solution. This approach helped avoid the interaction
of Cu-MOFs with serum and considerably slowed the
leaching of copper ions, thereby allowing for longer-
term NO catalytic capacity in serum over 6 hours.
This composite promoted accelerated endothelial cell
migration and supported the monolayer development
of endothelial cells in HUVECs and human SMCs as
well as rat abdominal artery replacement and arte-
riovenous shunt models. The formation and coverage
of a conﬂuent layer of endothelial cells on grafts were

MYOCARDIAL
ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION
INJURY
AND
MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION. Following a myocardial
infarction, timely reperfusion of the occluded coro-
nary artery is the most effective intervention to
minimize ischemic injury. However, reperfusion it-
self also induces injury because of a variety of cellular
stresses, such as high intracellular calcium, rising pH,
and generation of ROS, that culminate with mito-
chondrial
depolarization
and
cardiomyocyte
cell
death. Such damage is termed ischemia/reperfusion
(I/R) injury, and multiple lines of evidence suggest a
protective effect of NO.109,110
For example, canonical NO signaling via eNOS and
protein
kinase
G
helps
mediate
ischemic
pre-
conditioning,
whereby
brief
periods
of
ischemia
before
an
infarct
reduce
subsequent
myocardial
injury.111 NO generation via eNOS is also integral to the
RISK (Reperfusion Injury Salvage Kinase) pathway,
which when stimulated during early reperfusion, ul-
timately inhibits mitochondrial depolarization and
limits cell death.112 NO is also thought to have direct
cardioprotective effects via S-nitrosation of thiols in
key mitochondrial proteins, in particular, complex I.
Rapid reactivation of complex I early during reperfu-
sion is a major source of H2O2, which contributes to
oxidative damage and cell death; however, reversible
S-nitrosation mitigates against this by maintaining

complex I in a low activity state.113 This protective
effect has been elegantly demonstrated by the Mur-
phy laboratory, which has created MitoSNO by cova-
lently linking SNAP to a triphenylphosphonium cation
group, providing mitochondrial targeting because of
its lipophilicity and positive charge. When MitoSNO
was given to Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts at
the point of reperfusion, it signiﬁcantly reduced
infarct size and improved functional recovery.114 This
provides proof-of-concept for the mitochondrial tar-
geting of NO during early reperfusion, although, as
with all potential I/R therapies, it is inherently difﬁ-
cult to target the site of injury at a time when blood
ﬂow is impaired.
Although the previous example is a small molecule
approach, there is potential to target these pathways
using NPs. Schoenﬁsch laboratory has developed and
patented wide-ranging innovative NPs (porous silica,
dendrimers, and other polymeric NPs) for the storage
and release of NO, which have primarily been tested
for the treatment of bacterial infections.23 In 2010,
they explored the ability of functionalized dendrimer
NPs for reduction of I/R injury in the isolated,
perfused rat heart.83 Dendrimers were prepared by
following a thiol-yne chemistry method. Each multi-
branched
dendrimer
was
designed
to
optimize
cellular uptake and bioavailability and was conju-
gated to 64 molecules of SNAP. Hearts were also
exposed to varying concentrations of reduced gluta-
thione (GSH), which represents an important variable
in vivo, because it can chemically reduce S-nitro-
sothiols
(such
as
SNAP)
through
direct
trans-
nitrosation.115 Thus, NO release was found to be much
higher
in
the
presence
of
GSH
compared
with
dendrimer-SNAP alone, and the GSH levels effec-
tively determined NO release kinetics.83 Optimal
doses of dendrimer-SNAP and GSH were determined
to establish a proof-of-principle reduction in infarct
size,
although
low
experimental
numbers
urge
caution with interpretation of these ﬁndings. Further
work is needed to determine the cellular uptake and
fate of these dendrimers and for conﬁrmation in
clinically-relevant in vivo models.
It should be noted that NO may represent a double-
edged sword in I/R injury. Cardioprotection depends
on the timely and temporary delivery of controlled
amounts of NO to the mitochondria. However, the
coexistence of excess superoxide anion radicals can
lead to formation of highly toxic peroxynitrite.116
Peroxynitrite is a powerful oxidizing and nitrating
agent that can target multiple substrates resulting in
membrane lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial damage,
disturbances in cell signaling, apoptosis, and necro-
sis. Therefore, the release of NO from NPs using
exogeneous NO sources will need to be ﬁne-tuned to
achieve optimal therapeutic effects for I/R injury.
TISSUE ENGINEERING. Cardiovascular tissue engi-
neering holds promise for the repair and regeneration
of injured myocardium, heart valves, and blood ves-
sels, but this requires strong coupling with sur-
rounding native tissues. In particular, vascular grafts
can be problematic for small diameter vessels because
of issues of patency, so there is interest in developing
scaffolds to mimic the extracellular matrix that can
either be seeded with stem cells in vitro or that pro-
mote natural angiogenesis to grow new vessels in
situ. Challenges include biocompatibility, promoting
endothelialization while suppressing SMC hyperpla-
sia, and preventing hypercoagulation.117 Hence, it is
no surprise that NO-generating/releasing scaffolds
have been developed for vascular tissue engineering.
Scaffolds are 3-dimensional porous networks formed
from natural or synthetic materials, which provide an
ideal 3-dimensional microenvironment to promote
cell–cell communication, cell attachment, migration,
differentiation, and proliferation. Such scaffolds for
cardiac
tissue
engineering
applications
generally
comprise of natural or synthetic materials, including
polymers, collagens,
silk, alginate, chitosan,
and
hydrogels, because of their good mechanical strength
and favorable degradation proﬁles.118 Scaffolds have
been used extensively for cardiac tissue engineering
applications, speciﬁcally in ischemic heart diseases,
and
cardiac
patches,119-123
but
there
are
limited
studies using NO-based technology.
The group of Shen and colleagues has published a
series of papers117,124-126 using an electrospun scaffold
of PCL/keratin mats (size 457  53 nm) functionalized
with gold NPs (size 22.1  4.5 nm)117 for use as tissue-
engineered vascular grafts. This represents a typical
application
for
cardiovascular
tissue
engineering
where vascular or stem cells are seeded onto biode-
gradable
scaffolds
to
regenerate
vascular
tissues
instead of an autologous blood vessel.127 In recent
years, keratin, a natural component of human hair,
skin, and nails, has been appreciated as a biomaterial
providing excellent biocompatibility and biodegrad-
ability. Moreover, cysteine is a key component of
keratin, which further facilitates the decomposition
of endogenous sources of NO, catalyzed by the gold
NPs. These functionalized scaffolds were able to
catalyze
NO
generation
when
tested
in
vitro,
improving
HUVEC
growth
and
inhibiting
human
umbilical
artery
smooth
muscle
cells
viability.117
Further work is required to realize the potential for
use in tissue engineering by testing the effects on
endothelialization and SMC proliferation in vivo.

approaches, micron-sized materials have been used

amount of NO.117,124,131
OTHER
APPLICATIONS
OF
NO-RELEASING
NPs.
Angiogenesis is characterized by the growth of new
blood vessels sprouting from other pre-existing small
vessels and plays a critical role in the response to
tissue ischemia and wound healing as well as being a
major goal in tissue engineering. Angiogenesis is
promoted by several growth factors, such as vascular
endothelial growth factor and basic ﬁbroblast growth
factor, which stimulate quiescent endothelial cells
into
a
highly
proliferative
state.132
NO
is
an
important regulator of endothelial function affecting
angiogenesis.133,134 Yang et al135 developed NONOate-
incorporated
methoxy
poly(ethylene
glycol)-b-
poly(lactic-co-glycolic
acid)
(mPEG-PLGA)
NPs
of
200 nm size with NO release of w80% in 24 hours.
The induction of angiogenesis was evaluated by tube
formation, which shows the formation of capillary-
like structures. They demonstrated that the tubular
formation increased 190% in NO-releasing NP-treated
groups in comparison to the control group. The in-
duction of angiogenesis was evaluated ex vivo using
rat aorta treated with NO-releasing NPs and revealed
sprouting angiogenesis. In another study, Lee et al136
reported DETA NONOate incorporated mPEG-PLGH-
thiobenzamide NPs of 140 nm size and showed that
NO-releasing NPs released up to 20 nmol over 72
hours
and
exhibited
enhanced
angiogenesis
compared with the control groups in both in vitro
(HUVECs and 3T3-L1) and ex vivo (rat aorta) models.
Endothelial dysfunction associated with a deﬁ-
ciency of NO is broadly acknowledged as an integral
ﬁrst step in the development of atherosclerosis.137
Hence,
several
groups
have
experimented
with
the
systemic
administration
of
NP
NO
donors.
Rink et al138 described the synthesis of RSNO phos-
pholipid (S-nitrosylated 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-
phosphonitrosothioethanol)
within
an
outer
phospholipid shell composed of a naturally abundant
high-density lipoprotein (HDL). HDL NPs were syn-
thesized by reductive methylation of apolipoprotein
A-I by 3H-formaldehyde. Such NO-releasing HDL NPs
retain
many
of
the
properties
of
natural
HDLs,
thereby improving biocompatibility and targeting to
the vasculature. ApoE knockout mice were fed a high-
fat diet for 18 weeks, with treatment given by intra-
venous injection 3 times/wk from week 12 onwards.
Compared with vehicle-administered control sub-
jects, treatment with functionalized HDL NPs reduced
atherosclerotic plaque burden by 42%.138
Mohamed et al139 developed NO-releasing poly-
meric NPs based on a polyvinylpyrrolidone composite
incorporating nitrite and a reducing agent as the NO
source. Polymeric NPs were prepared via ionotropic
gelation technique. In aqueous solution, steady-state
NO release was obtained within 7 minutes and lasted
for 2 hours, followed by a 50% lower release phase
that was sustained for at least 8 hours. NO-releasing
NPs caused dose-dependent relaxations of pulmo-
nary arteries taken from mice with hypoxia-induced
pulmonary artery hypertension without altering the
viability of endothelial cells.
Huang et al82 formulated liposomes comprising
phospholipids and cholesterol that encapsulate NO
gas.
Liposomes
were
prepared
by
modiﬁed
pressured-freeze method. NO-release kinetics could
be controlled via the incorporation of argon, with
formulations releasing 1.6 mmol over 60 minutes
and providing sustained and slow release over 8
hours. Delivery of NO to vascular smooth muscle
cells
was
7-fold
higher
using
the
liposomes
compared with uncaged NO, and remained high
even in the presence of hemoglobin, indicating that
this formulation improves bioavailability by pro-
tecting against NO scavenging. Efﬁcacy was tested
in a rabbit model of carotid artery vascular balloon
injury, where NO-releasing liposomes were incu-
bated in the artery for 2 minutes immediately after
injury, and the damage was assessed by histology
2 weeks later. NO-releasing liposomes signiﬁcantly
reduced neointimal hyperplasia, and there was a
41% reduction in arterial wall thickening.82 Table 1
summarizes NO-releasing NPs for use in cardiovas-
cular applications.

Promising proof-of-principle data have been pre-

tions, and this reﬂects the need for additional pre-
clinical studies to overcome a number of limitations
and unknowns.
For example, there are many variables in NP design
that require optimization for any given application,
eg, nanomaterial selection, structural design, physi-
cochemical properties, and fabrication procedures.

clearly deﬁned kinetics and duration. It is a major
limitation that we lack methods for real-time moni-
toring/tracking of NO release in vivo, where there are
also challenges with systemic administration and
concerns about long-term toxicity. It is therefore
important to understand issues relating to cellular
accumulation, breakdown, and elimination of NPs.
Large
animal
work
is
needed
to
generate
more
meaningful and translatable ﬁndings, particularly in
relation to the development of stents, but also for I/R
therapies.
One major barrier to progress with NO-releasing
nanoformulations is the need for multidisciplinary
teams
spanning
materials
science,
engineering,
chemistry, biotechnology, pharmacology, and car-
diovascular medicine. It is hoped that interdisci-
plinary
fellowships
will
help
bridge
that
gap.
Nevertheless, we believe that recent advances in
nanotechnology, particularly in relation to materials
and fabrication techniques, will boost research into
NO-releasing/generating formulations. For example,
since the discovery of graphene in 2003, it has been
widely investigated for image-guided drug delivery
and sensing applications mainly for cancer and in-
fectious diseases. However, graphene-based nano-
materials have not yet been developed for NO storage
and release purposes despite highly favorable char-
acteristics, eg, ultra-small size, exceptionally high
surface area, and a wide variety of shapes and mor-
phologies (graphene quantum dots, graphene oxide,
reduced graphene oxide, porous graphene nano-
sheets, graphene nanoplatelets, graphene aerogels/
hydrogels, graphene foam).
NO-releasing NPs could also be extended to other
CVD applications, such as angina and peripheral
vascular disease. Modiﬁcation of NPs may help mini-
mize toxicity and adverse effects, eg, by favoring
speciﬁc
metabolic
pathways
or
preventing
drugs
crossing the blood-brain barrier. It is also possible to
adapt NPs as a delivery vehicle for other payloads
such as hydrogen sulﬁde, carbon monoxide, nucleic
acids, siRNA, DNA, peptides, proteins, and antibodies.
Clearly this ﬁeld is still in its infancy, but the detailed
study of NPs for cardiovascular disease applications is
an attractive prospect that promises to open up a new
paradigm of highly tunable drug delivery.

STATE-OF-THE-ART REVIEW
Advances in Clinical Imaging of
Vascular Inﬂammation
A State-of-the-Art Review
Henry W. West, BMEDSCI, MBBS, PHD,a,b,* Katerina Dangas, BA,a,* Charalambos Antoniades, MD, PHDa
HIGHLIGHTS

Vascular inﬂammation is a druggable target involved in the development and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques. Noninvasive
imaging methodologies that quantify vascular inﬂammation can help in risk stratiﬁcation and guide treatments.

Molecular imaging using PET/PET-CT/PET-MRI adds signiﬁcantly to the understanding of disease pathogenesis and is
considered the gold standard in visualizing inﬂammation noninvasively. However, the practical limitations of its clinical
deployment limit its use in clinical practice.

CT imaging allows high-resolution investigation of plaque structure, allowing detection of high-risk features. CT pheno-
typing of PVAT for the assessment of vascular inﬂammation allows detection of residual inﬂammatory risk. This method is
used in clinical practice.

CMR allows structural assessment of large vessels, but its limited spatial and temporal resolution restricts its use for
assessment of coronary plaque or coronary inﬂammation.

Ultrasound offers an attractive perspective for assessment of vascular inﬂammation at low cost and with no radiation, but
current approaches do not offer an alternative to PET imaging– or CT imaging–based methods for assessment of coronary
inﬂammation.
SUMMARY
Vascular inﬂammation is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease, particularly atherosclerotic disease, and early
detection of vascular inﬂammation may be key to the ultimate reduction of residual cardiovascular morbidity and mor-
tality. This review paper discusses the progress toward the clinical utility of noninvasive imaging techniques for assessing
vascular inﬂammation, with a focus on coronary atherosclerosis. A discussion of multiple modalities is included:
computed tomography (CT) imaging (the major focus of the review), cardiac magnetic resonance, ultrasound, and
positron emission tomography imaging. The review covers recent progress in new technologies such as the novel CT
biomarkers of coronary inﬂammation (eg, the perivascular fat attenuation index), new inﬂammation-speciﬁc tracers for
positron emission tomography–CT imaging, and others. The strengths and limitations of each modality are explored,
highlighting the potential for multi-modality imaging and the use of artiﬁcial intelligence image interpretation to improve
both diagnostic and prognostic potential for common conditions such as coronary artery disease. (J Am Coll Cardiol Basic

ascular inﬂammation plays a critical role in
the development and progression of various
cardiovascular diseases, most importantly
atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). Accu-
rate noninvasive assessment of vascular inﬂamma-
tion
has
been
a
challenge
for
clinicians
and
researchers due to the limitations of traditional imag-
ing modalities, with invasive assessment limited to
surgical patients in highly controlled research set-
tings. With the advent of more advanced imaging
technologies such as multi-detector computed to-
mography (CT) scanners and molecular imaging using
selective radiotracers in positron emission tomogra-
phy (PET), it is now possible to directly assess
vascular biology and inﬂammation, including in the
coronary tree. Furthermore, the burgeoning ﬁeld of
CT radiomics has the potential to augment noninva-
sive inﬂammation detection for improvements in pa-
tient care. Concurrently, molecular imaging with PET
has experienced tremendous growth in recent years,
with numerous radiotracers and imaging technolo-
gies being developed for the detection of vascular
inﬂammation.
Intravascular
ultrasound
is
also
becoming increasingly available during invasive angi-
ography, presenting a signiﬁcant opportunity for the
use of ultrasound-based methods for the indirect
detection of the high-risk (and presumably inﬂamed)
coronary plaque.
In the current state-of-the-art review, an overview
is provided of the advances in all imaging technolo-
gies used for the detection of vascular inﬂammation,
with a speciﬁc focus on coronary artery inﬂammation.
The review focuses on CT imaging techniques, which
have seen huge interest in recent years, but it also
includes dedicated discussion of magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), PET-CT and PET-MRI, and ultrasound.
Highlighted also is the recent progress in human
translational applications of each imaging modality,
evaluating their strengths and limitations in the
assessment of vascular inﬂammation.
INTRODUCTION TO VASCULAR INFLAMMATION
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inﬂammatory condition
of the vasculature. It is highly patterned in its path-
ophysiology, forming characteristic lesions within the
arterial system all around the body. Broadly, athero-
sclerosis
encompasses
the
stages
of
endothelial
dysfunction, formation of fatty streak, plaque devel-
opment (atheroma and ﬁbroatheroma), and plaque
disruption
and
thrombosis,
including
the
patho-
physiological processes that underpin these transi-
tions.
The
spectrum
of
disease
caused
by
atherosclerosis
is
vast,
including
myocardial
infarction (MI), stroke, and peripheral arterial
disease, which, among other related condi-
tions, comprise cardiovascular disease, the
leading cause of morbidity and mortality
globally.1
Since the pioneering work of Russell Ross,
vascular inﬂammation has played a causal
role in the pathogenesis of all stages of
atherosclerosis and plaque rupture.2-4 How-
ever, our understanding has ﬂourished since
Ross’s canonical response-to-injury hypoth-
esis,5,6
which
suggested
that
endothelial
dysfunction (caused by genetics, vascular
injury,
elevated
low-density
lipoprotein
[LDL-C] levels, free radicals from cigarette
smoking, and hypertension, among others)
causes collagen exposure and platelet adhe-
sion,
aggregation,
and
degranulation
to
initiate
atherosclerosis.
Adhesion
markers
(intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular
cell
adhesion
molecule
[VCAM-1]),
in
conjunction with chemotactic agents (che-
mokine [C-C motif] ligand 5) secreted by
platelet degranulation, then act to stimulate
neutrophil and macrophage migration and
subendothelial accumulation of monocytes
and LDL-C, initiating the inﬂammatory pro-
cess.7 Other cytokines such as chemokine
(C-C motif) ligand 2 are also released by
neutrophils and smooth muscle cells (SMCs)
and stimulate further leukocyte chemotaxis.
The evolution of plaque then begins in the
arterial intima, which contains a lipid-rich
core
from
accumulation
of
LDL-C
within
macrophage foam cells underneath a ﬁbrous
cap formed from SMC migration and prolif-
eration (Figure 1).
This canonical view of the initiation of athero-
sclerosis has been updated to reveal a complex
interrelated network of pathways involving not only
the innate immune system but also adaptive immu-
nity (T- and B-cell responses), thrombo-inﬂammation
(platelet-triggered processes), and C-mediated pro-
cesses, among others. The role of B cells in athero-
sclerosis
is
complex,8
as
some
B-cell
responses
targeting oxidation-speciﬁc epitopes might be disease
protective, whereas other downstream pathways may
be
pro-atherosclerotic.
Furthermore,
antibody-
independent roles include cytokine production and
T-cell regulation that secondarily mediate athero-
sclerosis.
B-cell
depletion
therapies
have
been
investigated,
but
further
isolation
of
the
pro-
atherosclerotic pathways may be even more useful
in generating targeted therapies. A role for T helper 1

cells is also being established.9 Platelets have been
known to be critical in the early stages of athero-
sclerosis by releasing chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5,
a critical chemokine for promoting monocyte adhe-
sion; increasingly complex roles are being eluci-
dated.10 The role of these cell-mediated pathways
and others (eg, protein kinase C) have been reviewed
in detail elsewhere.11
The role of inﬂammation also extends to athero-
sclerotic
disease
progression.7
Activated
macro-
phages
that
ingest
lipid
molecules
subsequently
secrete chemokines and cytokines and drive lipid
accumulation.12,13
Notably,
however,
the
role
of
macrophages in atherosclerosis is highly complex,
with both pro- and anti-atherosclerotic functions.
One recent study suggests that mural cell–driven
macrophage
niches
may
be
protective
against
chronic inﬂammation.14 Furthermore, as SMCs and
macrophages apoptose and a necrotic core grows,
senescent SMCs release pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
and matrix metalloproteinases.15 Oxidized LDL-C also
triggers the nuclear factor kB signaling pathway,
promoting the transcription of the NOD-, LRR-, and
pyrin domain–containing 3 (NLRP3) inﬂammasome
and pro–interleukin-1, triggering downstream path-
ways, which include the release of neutrophil extra-
cellular traps. These traps further induce cytotoxicity
by priming the NLRP3 inﬂammasome in macrophages
and inducing platelet activation and the tissue factor
pathway inhibitor.7
Finally, inﬂammation is also a critical driver of
vulnerable plaque rupture, which is a key pathogenic
mechanism
of
acute
coronary
syndromes
(ACS).
When the weakened cap breaks, procoagulant mole-
cules in the blood are exposed to tissue factor within
the lipid-rich core; platelet aggregation and throm-
bosis ensue. Superﬁcial erosion is a second mecha-
nism by which plaque progression occurs; depletion
of neutrophils has been shown to prevent this pro-
cess, further highlighting the role of inﬂammation.16
Vascular inﬂammation is therefore causally impli-
cated in atherosclerosis from inception to complica-
tion. Clinical studies have concordantly conﬁrmed
the clinical relevance of inﬂammation in atheroscle-
rotic cardiovascular disease. Elevation in inﬂamma-
tory markers predicts outcomes in patients with
ACS.17-19 Inﬂammation also affects cardiovascular risk
factors, possibly by decreasing nitric oxide bioavail-
ability
in
the
vascular
endothelium.20
Vascular
inﬂammation has furthermore been shown to affect
serum lipid levels and lipoprotein function. It causes
LDL-C to be more easily oxidized,21 as the ability of
HDL to prevent the oxidation of LDL-C is diminished.
It follows that lipid-modifying statins trigger clini-
cally signiﬁcant anti-inﬂammatory processes.22
Therefore, targeting these complex pathways pro-
vides
a
promising
route
toward
diagnosing
and
treating the disease. Our growing understanding of
the complex interconnected pathways that give rise
to the modern view of atherosclerosis serves as a
potential avenue for precision medicine. Inﬂamma-
tion had been largely overlooked until recent years
but has become a fast-growing target for innovation
in diagnostics and treatment. In particular, the po-
tential to further stratify CAD according to the pres-
ence
of
inﬂammation
may
be
critical,
as
anti-inﬂammatory treatments for atherosclerosis are
recommended in clinical guidelines.23 Its potential
applications
are
also
being
investigated
beyond
ischemic heart disease to include cardiometabolic
disease.24
CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN
INFLAMMATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS:
INSIGHTS FROM RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS
The advance in understanding of the cellular mech-
anisms of the chronic inﬂammatory process under-
lying atherosclerosis is increasingly being translated
into actionable clinical discoveries. Phase 3, double-
blind,
randomized
controlled
clinical
trials
have
now
shown
that
targeting
speciﬁc
inﬂammatory
pathways can improve clinical outcomes and reduce
cardiovascular events in select populations. Impor-
tantly, different anti-inﬂammatory strategies may
have varying agent-related effectiveness due to di-
versity
in
underlying
mechanisms,
speciﬁcally
whether
they
prevent
early
disease
progression,
lessen plaque formation, or reduce late-stage plaque
rupture to prevent acute cardiac events. This scenario
highlights a major challenge in clinical trials for anti-
inﬂammatory agents: what is the population of rele-
vance for the speciﬁc agent, and what is the relevant
outcome that the agent may modify?
The ﬁrst trial to test a clinical treatment strategy
based on inﬂammatory markers was JUPITER (Justi-
ﬁcation for the Use of Statin in Prevention: An Inter-
vention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin). In 17,802
patients selected per LDL-C level <130 mg/dL and
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level $2 mg/L,
rosuvastatin 20 mg was associated with a reduction in
the rate of primary endpoint (MI, stroke, arterial
revascularization,
hospitalization
for
unstable
angina, and cardiovascular death) compared with
placebo
(rosuvastatin
vs
placebo
1.31
vs
0.77).25
However, it was unclear whether it was an on-target

effect due to LDL-C reduction or a pleiotropic effect of
reducing
inﬂammation,
generating
the
need
for
investigation
and
development
of
targeted
anti-
inﬂammatory treatments.
Notably,
CANTOS
(Canakinumab
Anti-
inﬂammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study) investi-
gated
the
impact
of
an
interleukin-1b–targeted
monoclonal antibody (canakinumab) on cardiovas-
cular outcomes, in 10,061 patients with a previous MI
and C-reactive protein level $2 mg/L.26 The trial
compared 3 doses (50, 150, and 300 mg) of canaki-
numab administered subcutaneously every 3 months
vs placebo on the primary endpoint of nonfatal MI,
nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. Canakinu-
mab 150 mg every 3 months was found to signiﬁcantly
reduce recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events
(MACE) by 17% (HR: 0.83; P ¼ 0.005). This study was
the ﬁrst to show that anti-inﬂammatory drug treat-
ment reduces cardiovascular risk, although the rela-
tively modest reduction in MACE, with no signiﬁcant
effect on cardiac mortality, questioned the use of
high-sensitivity
C-reactive
protein
for
patient
selection; this introduced the need for more precise
and sophisticated methods to identify those patients
with high coronary inﬂammation who would beneﬁt
the most from targeted treatment. The CANTOS trial
has revived the need to develop imaging biomarkers
of coronary inﬂammation for use as a companion or
complementary diagnostic tool.27
However, the story is not that simple. CIRT (Car-
diovascular Inﬂammation Reduction Trial) investi-
gated low-dose methotrexate vs placebo in 4,786
patients with previous MI or multivessel coronary
disease with diabetes or metabolic syndrome; it
found
no
reduction
in
the
composite
primary
endpoint (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovas-
cular death) with methotrexate.28 An ancillary study
found that impaired coronary ﬂow reserve was inde-
pendently associated with increased inﬂammation
and myocardial strain, which may have implications
in heart failure.24 The contrasting results of the CIRT
and
CANTOS
trials
show
that
anti-inﬂammatory
therapies effective against atherosclerosis must be
biochemically targeted to the speciﬁc inﬂammatory
FIGURE 1
Simpliﬁed Schematic of Vascular Inﬂammation Driving Atherosclerosis
Endothelial dysfunction results in collagen exposure and adhesion of circulating immune cells to the vascular wall at sites of up-regulation of adhesion markers such as
intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule. The immune cells that migrate into the arterial wall along with circulating low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) initiate inﬂammatory responses in the subendothelial space. This mechanism drives the creation of foam cells and the organization of
healing processes such as ﬁbrotic change within the intima and the migration of smooth muscle cells into the atherosclerotic site. The inﬂuence of this process extends
beyond the arterial intima and affects the arterial media and adventitia, including perivascular adipose tissue. eNOS ¼ endothelial nitric oxide synthase;

pathways
validated
in
the
disease.
Whereas
the
interleukin-1b to NLRP3 inﬂammasome pathway tar-
geted by canakinumab is genetically and cellularly
validated as a critical driver of atherosclerosis, this is
not the case for nucleic acid synthesis targeted by
methotrexate. Similarly, the phospholipase inhibitor
darapladib29 and p38 mitogen-activated protein ki-
nase blocker losmapimod30 also yielded neutral re-
sults as they act on pathways not likely critical in the
pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Thus, additional
cellular work may be a critical hypothesis generator
for future drug development.
Colchicine is a potent anti-inﬂammatory drug tar-
geting cyclooxygenase-2 with wide-ranging clinical
utility, including in gout and pericarditis. It is an
effective tubulin disruptor and also a known inhibitor
of leukocyte migration and of the NLRP3 inﬂamma-
some. This drug has shown promise in mitigating
vascular
inﬂammation
in
2
key
trials.
COLCOT
(Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial) found
that
0.5
mg
daily
colchicine
vs
placebo
in
patients <30 days after a MI signiﬁcantly reduced the
risk of ischemic cardiovascular events (cardiovascular
death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, MI, stroke, and
urgent hospitalization for angina leading to coronary
revascularization) with colchicine than placebo.31 The
effects of colchicine also translate to patients with
chronic coronary disease, as shown by the LoDoCo2
(Low-Dose
Colchicine
2)
trial,32
which
compared
0.5 mg colchicine daily vs placebo in those with
chronic coronary disease. These 2 trials conﬁrmed
that anti-inﬂammatory treatments can be used in
cardiovascular risk management and led to the in-
clusion of colchicine in the European Society of Car-
diology 2021 prevention guidelines (with a Class IIb
indication) as a therapeutic option on top of statins,
in patients at very high risk.33
Furthermore, REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardio-
vascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention
Trial), which assessed icosapent ethyl in patients
with
hypertriglyceridemia,
found
a
striking
risk
reduction of ischemic heart disease; however, the
result was not found to be related to reduction in
triglyceride level.34 It is indeed possible that this ef-
fect is mediated through the anti-inﬂammatory ef-
fects of this agent.
Finally, the ZEUS (Effects of Ziltivekimab vs Pla-
cebo on Cardiovascular Outcomes in Participants
With Established Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Dis-
ease, Chronic Kidney Disease, and Systemic Inﬂam-
mation) trial investigating the novel interleukin-6
inhibitor ziltivekimab vs placebo on primary out-
comes of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and
nonfatal stroke is ongoing.35 The results of this phase
3 trial have the potential to further shift the view of
atherosclerosis from a lipid storage disease to an in-
ﬂammatory one.
Overall, clinical practice changes with phase 3
randomized clinical trials. The most recent European
Society of Cardiology guidelines reﬂect this paradigm
shift by recommending colchicine in high-risk in-
dividuals
with
atherosclerotic
cardiovascular
dis-
ease.33 However, the direction of anti-inﬂammatory
treatments to individuals with pathology that is
amenable to such therapy is paramount. The side ef-
fect proﬁles of many anti-inﬂammatory treatments
are not to be neglected, including infection risk and
gastrointestinal complication resulting in poor toler-
ability. Furthermore, biologics are expensive thera-
pies that require increased selectivity, which can be
accomplished
by
personalized
medicine.
Further
work is needed to develop reliable investigations to
accurately
identify
those
patients
with
arterial
inﬂammation who would respond to such therapies.
Emerging imaging techniques that allow measure-
ment of cardiovascular inﬂammation are expected to
soon

us
to
more

strategies.
NONINVASIVE DETECTION OF
VASCULAR INFLAMMATION
Noninvasive imaging techniques for the assessment
of vascular inﬂammation have garnered signiﬁcant
interest in the research and clinical communities over
recent years. As our understanding of the funda-
mental roles of inﬂammation in atherosclerosis and
other
vascular
conditions
such
as
vasculitis
has
improved, so has the impetus to use noninvasive
means to assess human inﬂammatory load, particu-
larly in the coronary arteries and the aorta. The
noninvasive assessment of coronary artery inﬂam-
mation has already been shown to provide signiﬁcant
opportunity for enhanced CAD risk stratiﬁcation,
personalized therapy decision-making, and enhanced
monitoring of therapeutic efﬁcacy36 (discussed in this
section of the review).
We provide a review of the major noninvasive im-
aging modalities available to researchers and clini-
cians to visualize vascular inﬂammation in vivo with
a focus on both the molecular mechanisms that these
imaging modalities rely upon and their clinical ap-
plications. Invasive modalities such as intravascular
imaging techniques are not included in this review.
The noninvasive imaging modalities for the detection
of vascular inﬂammation discussed here are summa-
rized in the Central Illustration along with their
strengths and weaknesses.

CT IMAGING. The use of CT imaging to visualize the
heart and vascular structures has increased dramati-
cally in recent decades owing to improved imaging
technology and widespread utility of CT scanners
across a broad range of clinical indications.
Coronary
computed
tomography
angiography
(CTA) has become the noninvasive imaging modality
of choice for the noninvasive examination of the
coronary arteries. The currently accepted broad in-
dications for coronary CTA in clinical practice that are
relevant to inﬂammatory vascular disease include: 1)
suspected or known CAD (to evaluate the severity and
extent of CAD, particularly in patients with symptoms
such as stable chest pain, shortness of breath, and
exercise intolerance); 2) assessing the anatomy of the
coronary arteries before revascularization procedures
such as coronary artery bypass surgery or percuta-
neous coronary intervention; 3) preoperative evalu-
ation for noncardiac surgery to assess the presence
and
severity
of
CAD
in
patients
scheduled
for
noncardiac surgery; and 4) monitoring the progres-
sion
of
CAD
or
assessing
the
effectiveness
of
treatment, including lifestyle changes, medication, or
revascularization procedures.
It is important to note that coronary CTA is not
always the ﬁrst-line imaging modality for all these
broad indications in all settings. The choice of imag-
ing test often depends on an individual patient’s
disposition.
Beyond the indications listed here, the role of CT
imaging has recently expanded to include the direct
noninvasive imaging of vascular inﬂammation. CT
imaging offers unparalleled potential for widespread
clinical uptake of vascular inﬂammation assessment,
upheld by the existing reliance on CT scans in clinical
guidelines for the investigation of chest pain world-
wide.37,38 Advances that allow these scans to be further
utilized for the visualization of coronary inﬂammation
would improve and streamline clinical practice and
add immense value for patients and clinicians.
Currently, when plaque is visualized with coronary
CTA, plaque risk is stratiﬁed to assess plaque stability
and therefore risk of cardiac events. High-risk plaque
(HRP)
features
include
low
attenuation,

remodeling, spotty calciﬁcation, and the napkin ring
sign
(ringlike
peripheral
higher
attenuation
with
central low attenuation), among others. On the other
hand, calciﬁcation signiﬁes stability and low inﬂam-
mation. However, HRP features are not reliable in
assessing plaque inﬂammation. The absence of these
features does not necessarily correlate with lack of
inﬂammation because by the time plaque appears,
vascular inﬂammation has been ongoing for some
time. Indeed, recent studies show that the traditional
stenosis-based approach has failed to identify at-risk
patients
(Coronary
Artery
Disease
Reporting
and
Data System 2.0 [CAD-RADS 2.0])39 and furthermore
failed to improve clinical outcomes beyond symptom
improvement in patients with stable CAD (ISCHEMIA
[International Study of Comparative Health Effec-
tiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches]).40
Therefore,
to
maximize
prevention
of
cardiac
events,
imaging
biomarkers
speciﬁc
to
vascular
inﬂammation are needed to detect coronary inﬂam-
mation before plaque formation is detectable.
Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) can detect sig-
nals of disease emanating from the vascular wall. In
brief, in conditions of cardiovascular disease, the
arterial
wall
releases
various
mediators
such
as
oxidation products (eg, 4-hydroxynonenal), which
diffuse to PVAT, inducing the transformation of adi-
pocytes from quiescent lipid-storage cells to active
biosynthetic cells that secrete antioxidant adipokines
such
as
adiponectin.
These
adipokines
are
then
transported back to the vascular wall, acting as a de-
fense mechanism against vascular oxidative damage.
Inﬂammatory molecules originating from the vascular
wall also diffuse into adjacent adipose tissue, pre-
venting pre-adipocyte differentiation into mature
adipocytes within PVAT. In addition, these inﬂam-
matory molecules stimulate perivascular lipolysis,
generating a gradient of adipocyte size surrounding
the inﬂamed artery. The adipocyte size gradient in
PVAT close to the inﬂamed artery results in a higher
lipid/water ratio in the layers of PVAT adjacent to the
inﬂamed vascular wall. The gradient changes in
PVAT’s structure and composition around inﬂamed
arteries could act as an internal “thermometer” of
vascular inﬂammation if it can be visualized and
quantiﬁed noninvasively.
One of the key advances that has facilitated CT
imaging to becoming a “one-stop-shop”41 for imaging
of the vasculature, particularly the coronary arteries,
is the fundamental but often overlooked fact that
three-dimensional medical images, like all images,
are data sets.
The ﬁrst major imaging technology that utilizes
coronary
CTA
for
the
detection
of
vascular
inﬂammation is the perivascular fat attenuation in-
dex (FAI). This noninvasive, CT imaging–derived
biomarker relies on attenuation mapping of peri-
coronary
adipose
tissue
(PCAT)
composition
to
extract information about the inﬂammatory status of
the adjacent coronary artery.42,43 The premise of this
work emerges from the understanding that adipose
tissue
is
a
key
regulator
of
cardiometabolic
health.44,45 PVAT is the adipose tissue that forms a
contiguous entity with the arterial adventitia and
plays a key role in vascular homeostasis and athero-
genesis by regulating the local microenvironment
through the release of bioactive adipokines,46,47 as
well as gaseous and other lipid messengers.42,44
Studies
that
used
18F-ﬂuorodeoxyglucose
(18F-FDG) PET-CT imaging to visualize inﬂammation
in PVAT (as outlined later in this review) have high-
lighted signiﬁcant relationships between this inﬂam-
mation
and
a
range
of
clinically
signiﬁcant
cardiovascular disease endpoints.48 Importantly, our
group showed that the paracrine interactions be-
tween
the
arterial
wall
and
the
PVAT
are
bidirectional.43,46,47,49 We found that in the presence
of increased vascular oxidative stress, lipid peroxi-
dation
products
such
as
4-hydroxynonenal
are
increasingly produced and diffuse from the vascular
wall
to
the
PVAT.50
These
substances
activate
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor-g
signaling in PVAT adipocytes, which results in an up-
regulation and increased secretion of the antioxidant
adiponectin from the perivascular adipocytes.51 Adi-
ponectin can then diffuse back to the vascular wall
and proximal myocardial tissue and reduce superox-
ide production by suppressing the activity of nico-
tinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases,
as well as by improving the coupling of endothelial
nitric
oxide
synthase
in
the
vascular
endothe-
lium.46,47,52
During
the
process
of
shifting
the
phenotype of PVAT adipocytes from energy storing to
active secretory cells, their dimensions, shape, and
content change, becoming smaller in size and with
reduced intracellular lipid content.
The ability to evolve in response to signals from
the cardiovascular system is also shown by the ability
of adipocytes to activate lipolysis and reduce adipo-
genesis in the presence of exogenous inﬂammation
and circulating molecules such as brain natriuretic
peptide.49 Importantly, we have also shown that if
vascular inﬂammation is present, the release of pro-
inﬂammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis fac-
tor-a, interleukin-6, and interferon gamma blocks the
ability of perivascular pre-adipocytes to differentiate
into mature lipid-laden adipocytes.43 Indeed, per re-
sults of paired PVAT biopsies from a site attached to

the right coronary artery, perivascular adipocytes
were signiﬁcantly smaller and less well differentiated
compared with adipocytes from epicardial adipose
tissue biopsies obtained >2 cm away from any coro-
nary artery (non-PVAT); this was evidenced by a
lower relative expression of the adipocyte differen-
tiation
markers
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor–g and fatty acid binding protein-4. This
gradient in PVAT composition reﬂects the inﬂamma-
tory burden of a given coronary segment and has
highlighted PVAT as a biological sensor of coronary
artery
inﬂammation.
If
these
gradients
of
PVAT
composition around the coronary arteries is visual-
ized and quantiﬁed using noninvasive imaging, we
would be able to detect or even quantify coronary
artery inﬂammation noninvasively, leading to a new
generation of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of
cardiovascular events.
These laboratory ﬁndings have been translated to
coronary CTA through the segmentation and analysis
of PVAT along the coronary vessels using predeﬁned
validated Hounsﬁeld unit (HU) cutoffs (–190 to –30
HU).43,53 The perivascular FAI utilizes coronary CTA
to track spatial changes in PVAT composition that are
induced by inﬂamed coronary vessels as outlined
earlier.43 The FAI relies on the concept that the
inﬂammation-induced changes in adipocyte size are
associated with a detectable shift in CT attenuation
toward a less negative HU range (toward –30 HU). The
perivascular FAI (calculated by using the CaRi-HEART
medical device; Caristo Diagnostics54) captures and
interprets these attenuation gradients in the peri-
vascular space, with high perivascular FAI linked to a
higher inﬂammatory burden43,55 (Figures 2A to 2E).
Importantly, there is strong evidence that CAD is
associated with a higher perivascular FAI compared
with healthy individuals.43 In addition, perivascular
FAI is signiﬁcantly increased around culprit/unstable
lesions in patients presenting with acute MI, and
perivascular FAI exhibits dynamic changes around
culprit
coronary
lesions,
decreasing
signiﬁcantly
when measured 5 weeks after the index event. It is
interesting to consider the concept of the vulnerable
arterial plaque in light of these ﬁndings, as this has
dominated clinical thinking around ACS for decades.
It will be of tremendous importance whether inﬂam-
matory imaging, such as FAI, can assist in identifying
coronary lesions at increased risk of rupture or,
perhaps
more
importantly,
superﬁcial
erosion.56
Whether CT imaging will be useful in noninvasive
differentiation of ACS etiology (ie, plaque erosion vs
rupture) remains to be seen. However, it is important
to note that perivascular FAI provides a measure of
vascular inﬂammation and CAD risk regardless of the
presence of any detectable coronary plaque, sug-
gesting that patient vulnerability extends beyond
immediately
detectable
plaque(s).
This
has
been
conﬁrmed by others,56,57 including a recent study of
765 coronary lesions by Kuneman et al,58 which found
that mean unadjusted PCAT attenuation is signiﬁ-
cantly
increased
across
culprit
lesion
precursors
compared with non-culprit lesions in patients with
ACS and vs lesions of patients with stable CAD, sug-
gesting a higher intensity of inﬂammation.
Perivascular FAI has also been shown to accurately
predict plaque progression41 and discriminate stable
vs unstable atherosclerotic plaques in 2 independent
cohorts (Figures 2F to 2H). These ﬁndings validate the
utility of FAI for the detection of both global coronary
artery inﬂammatory burden and clinically relevant
plaques.
The utility of FAI for cardiac mortality risk pre-
diction has also been explored. Stratifying by high vs
low FAI is shown to be able to predict risk of cardiac
mortality (Figures 3A to 3D), with high FAI being
associated with higher risk. This prognostic value was
even incremental to current clinical risk factors (Duke
CAD Index and HRP features on coronary CTA).
Furthermore, HRP features on coronary CTA in
conjunction with FAI show promise as a powerful
clinically
relevant
merged
analysis
for
CAD
risk
stratiﬁcation (Figures 3E to 3G). A recent narrative
review suggests that a technology to improve plaque
risk evaluation with coronary CTA would be of great
use.59 Such ﬁndings have been conﬁrmed by other
studies, including the landmark SCOT-HEART (Scot-
tish Computed Tomography of the Heart) trial,60 in
which PCAT attenuation of the right coronary artery
was predictive of MI events (HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.08-
2.22; P ¼ 0.017, per 1 SD increment). In multivariable
analysis,
adding
PCAT
of
the
right
coronary
artery
70.5
HU
or
higher
to
model
including
low-attenuation plaque burden led to improved pre-
diction of future MI (HR: 11.7; 95% CI: 3.3-40.9;
P < 0.0001). In a 2022 meta-analysis of 9 studies by
Sagris et al,61 the power of FAI to identify stable and
unstable coronary plaques (via the mean difference in
attenuation) was tested. FAI was found to be signiﬁ-
cantly higher in unstable plaques compared with
stable plaques with a mean difference of 4.5 HU
(95% CI: 1.10-7.89; I2 ¼ 88%). Higher pericoronary FAI
values offered incremental prognostic value for MACE
in studies with prospective follow-up (HR: 3.29;
95% CI: 1.88-5.76; I2 ¼ 75%) among 6,335 patients.
Other groups have investigated the application of
FAI
to
conﬁrm
the
hypothesis
behind
the
biomarker.57,62 In a validation of the link between
coronary artery inﬂammation and PVAT phenotype,

higher perivascular fat radiodensity has been shown
to strongly correlate with both increased plaque
inﬂammation
as
assessed
by
18F-sodium
ﬂuoride
(18F-NaF) uptake on PET-CT imaging63 and the pro-
gression of total and noncalciﬁed atherosclerotic
plaque burden in the adjacent vessel.64 It is note-
worthy that in symptomatic patients undergoing
cardiac CT imaging, the information captured by
perivascular
FAI
is
independent
of
coronary
calciﬁcation42,43 or systemic markers of inﬂammation
such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.42
Measuring
perivascular
attenuation
in
clinical
practice is problematic, however, as it is affected by
factors such as technical scan acquisition settings,
image postprocessing, and local anatomical and bio-
logical factors.65 This has led to the development of a
fully corrected metric of coronary inﬂammation, the
FAI Score, which allows us to individualize the

inﬂammatory burden of each coronary artery relative
to the patient and use it as a clinical biomarker of
coronary inﬂammation.65 Indeed, the FAI Score has
received regulatory clearance (CE Mark) for use in
clinical practice in the United Kingdom, Europe, and
Australia, as the clinical metric of coronary inﬂam-
mation obtained from coronary CTA. The medical
device that measures the FAI Score (CaRi-HEART)
incorporates these measurements and patient risk
factors into a prognostic model of coronary athero-
sclerosis to generate the individualized patient risk
for heart attack over a ﬁxed period (using the CaRi-
HEART risk calculator). The performance and prog-
nostic value of the FAI Score in predicting cardiac
mortality have been validated within the 2 original
validation cohorts (Erlangen, n ¼ 1,872; Cleveland
Clinic, n ¼ 2,040).65
Pericoronary FAI has been shown to be responsive
to established CAD treatments, including 3-hydroxy-
3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (ie,
statins). In a retrospective analysis of 108 patients
who underwent coronary CTA,66 FAI was signiﬁcantly
lower in noncalciﬁed plaques and mixed plaques
when statin therapy was commenced (68.0  8.5 HU
vs 71.5  8.1 HU [P < 0.001] and 70.5  8.9 HU vs
72.8  9.0 HU [P ¼ 0.014], respectively). This in-
dicates potential for perivascular FAI as an imaging
biomarker
to
monitor
statin
response.
Indeed,
Figure 4B presents a single case in which FAI was used
to
monitor
the
therapeutic
response
to
statins
through inﬂammatory burden in the right coronary
artery. Currently, there is no direct noninvasive im-
aging test that clinicians can use to assess for poten-
tial response to such treatments.
The precise role for the perivascular FAI Score for
assessment
of
coronary
artery
inﬂammation
in
clinical
practice
is
in
progress,
with
promising
workstreams now being developed. Figure 4A pre-
sents the proposed workstream for incorporating in-
ﬂammatory imaging into clinical CT imaging with
automated artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) performing both
quantitative plaque analysis and inﬂammatory im-
aging with FAI. The associated personalized risk
would then be calculated when clinical risk factors
are entered by clinicians,67 as PVAT inﬂammatory
imaging is most powerful when integrated with pla-
que metrics and clinical risk factors (Figure 4B).
A recent clinical consensus statement from the
European Society of Cardiology Working Group on
Coronary
Pathophysiology
and
Micro-circulation
outlined current and future clinical applicability of
AI technologies that integrate PVAT information into
prognostic models.68 The goal is to provide clinically
meaningful information in primary and secondary
prevention of atherosclerotic heart disease, which
offers the best high-level guidance for clinicians yet.
A relevant meta-analysis recently tested all current
clinically available approaches to vascular inﬂamma-
tion detection and assessed their prognostic value.69
The measurement of vascular inﬂammation in addi-
tion to clinical risk factors was found to signiﬁcantly
enhance risk discrimination for cardiovascular events
(Figure 5). PVAT assessment with CT imaging yielded
the highest C-index values of all means assessed.
Thus, coronary CTA biomarkers such as HRP features
and pericoronary fat imaging through the FAI (alone
or
in
combination)
enhance
cardiovascular
risk
discrimination
beyond
circulating
biomarkers
of
inﬂammation.

to compute many hundreds of shape-, attenuation-,
and texture-related features for a given anatomical
volume or segmentation.70 Many radiomic features
used together can be employed for disease diagnosis
or prognostication. The ﬁeld of radiomics was devel-
oped for the large-scale analysis of geospatial satellite
imagery and ﬁrst applied to health care in the ﬁeld of
cancer imaging.71 Radiomic approaches have now
been implemented in coronary CTA with the aim of
detecting biological mechanisms, including vascular
inﬂammation occurring around the coronary arteries.
Ultimately, the goal is to detect the residual inﬂam-
matory risk that continues to drive high morbidity
and mortality associated with CAD.72
Using AI for radiotranscriptomic phenotyping of
PVAT in risk prediction can potentially generate more
advanced biomarkers for comprehensive PVAT phe-
notyping. This approach promises to unlock detection
of precise subtypes of vascular pathology that deter-
mine texture and composition of PVAT through per-
ivascular lipolysis, adipogenesis, edema, ﬁbrosis, and
angiogenesis. Basic science techniques such as RNA
sequencing and histology serve to establish the bio-
logical “ground truth” of vascular pathology to which
the radiomic signature of PVAT on coronary CTA is
trained to speciﬁcally detect.
In
cardiovascular
imaging,
the
term
“radio-
transcriptomic” was introduced to describe this pro-
cess
of
training
radiomic
signatures
against
the
transcriptomic proﬁle of the tissue. Figure 6A outlines
the development pipeline for radiotranscriptomic
imaging biomarkers. Two lines of work are needed:
tissue samples from relevant PVAT with deep RNA
sequencing and CT imaging of the relevant PVAT
segments with full radiomic feature extraction. To
limit analysis to radiomic features that have potential
value as imaging biomarkers, ﬁltering steps are un-
dertaken to exclude the following: 1) features that are
not stable in test–retest analyses; 2) features that are
highly correlated with each other; and 3) features that
are signiﬁcantly correlated with other measures of
adipose tissue volume. Importantly, recursive feature
elimination with a random forest algorithm and
repeated 5-times cross-validation have been shown to
be a reproducible means to generate a ﬁnal list of
relevant radiomic features. Two examples of the
development
of
radiotranscriptomic
imaging
bio-
markers are outlined here, the fat radiomic proﬁle
(FRP) for CAD risk and the C19-RS for vascular
inﬂammation attributable to COVID-19 infection.
In work that extended the use of CT radiomics
beyond the power of a single radiomic feature for the
assessment of changes in perivascular adipocytes that
are reacting to vascular inﬂammation, we have re-
ported the ﬁrst study to apply complete radiomic
feature quantiﬁcation of coronary CTA scans for the
purpose of better detection of vascular inﬂamma-
tion.73 Radiomic signatures derived via a machine
learning approach were able to detect coronary artery
inﬂammation, and features of radiomic texture were
found to be related to adipose tissue ﬁbrosis and
vascularity, as measured through gene expression in
tissue samples obtained during cardiac surgery. An
AI-derived algorithm, the FRP, was applied to the
SCOT-HEART trial, in which it signiﬁcantly improved
major
adverse
cardiac
event
prediction
beyond
traditional risk stratiﬁcation that included risk fac-
tors, coronary calcium score, coronary stenosis, and
HRP features on coronary CTA (D[C-statistic] ¼ 0.126;
P < 0.001).74 This represented an improvement in
cardiovascular disease risk prediction beyond the
current state of the art.
Notably, it was found that FRP was unlike peri-
vascular FAI in relation to its responsiveness to
therapy, as the FRP was not altered up to 6 months
after an index cardiac event while FAI was shown to
improve during this time; this suggests that FRP is
detecting PVAT changes beyond coronary inﬂamma-
tion alone, changes that are not captured by FAI and
that are less susceptible to current treatment strate-
gies for CAD. These ﬁndings have been conﬁrmed by
other groups, including Lin et al,75 who recently
showed in a prospective case-control study that pa-
tients with acute MI have a distinct PCAT radiomic

inﬂammation and prognosis in patients with COVID-
19 infection.76 This is another example of how radio-
transcriptomics
can
be
harnessed
for
vascular
inﬂammation in a non-atherosclerosis setting. This
technology will facilitate more effective trials of
treatments and could identify patients at long-term
risk of complications arising from their infection
who may respond to therapy. An AI-powered radio-
mic “ﬁngerprint” of the perivascular space (C19-RS),
trained
using
as
ground
truth
a
transcriptomic
signature of cytokine-driven inﬂammation (derived
from RNA sequencing of human internal mammary
arteries), had a striking prognostic value in conditions
triggering
acute
vascular
inﬂammation
such
as
COVID-19.76 Technologies such as C19-RS are appli-
cable to any type of contrast chest CT scan, gated (eg,
CT coronary angiogram) or nongated (eg, CT angio-
gram of the pulmonary artery). It is important to note
that C19-RS identiﬁes an entirely distinct inﬂamma-
tory phenotype from the pericoronary FAI and the
FRP, with no overlap in radiomic features.
Indeed, patients with COVID-19 infection have
much higher scores for C19-RS compared vs those
without (Figure 6B). The score was found to have
prognostic value for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19
in 2 testing cohorts (high [$6.99] vs low [<6.99] C19-
RS; HR: 3.31 [95% CI: 1.49-7.33; P ¼ 0.0033] [Figure 6C]
and HR: 2.58 [95% CI: 1.10-6.05; P ¼ 0.028, respec-
tively), adjusted for clinical factors, biochemical bio-
markers of inﬂammation and myocardial injury, and
technical parameters. C19-RS was also predictive of
in-hospital death for high vs low C19-RS groups in the
SARS-CoV-2–positive study arm population who did
not receive dexamethasone treatment (Figure 6D) and
those who did receive dexamethasone treatment
(Figure 6E). HRs in Figures 6D and 6E are adjusted for
age >65 years, sex, cardiovascular risk factors (hy-
pertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and body mass
index), C-reactive
protein
plasma
concentrations,
white blood cell count, history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and tube voltage. The risk was
validated in an external sample from geographically
distinct locations for in-hospital death for high vs low
C19-RS groups (n ¼ 104 with 34 deaths) (Figure 6F).
Finally, C19-RS was strongly associated (R ¼ 0.61;
P ¼ 0.00031) with a whole blood transcriptional
module representing dysregulation of coagulation
and
platelet
aggregation
pathways.
This
radio-
transcriptomic signature for in-hospital mortality in
acute COVID-19 worked even when applied in non-
gated CT angiograms of the pulmonary arteries.
Texture radiotranscriptomics can also be used to
capture and quantify microcirculation in the peri-
vascular space, in addition to lipolysis/adipogenesis,
ﬁbrosis, and edema, offering additional prognostic
value over the perivascular FAI Score for cardiac
events.
Machine
learning/radiotranscriptomic
ap-
proaches are anticipated to revolutionize the utiliza-
tion of adipose tissue as a tool for exploring vascular
biology.
COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES
ULTRASOUND. Contrast-enhanced
ultrasound
has
been investigated for visualization of inﬂammation in
vessels affected by atherosclerosis. Although the
techniques that have been developed have been
useful in researching vascular inﬂammation, their
clinical utility has not been fully realized. The po-
tential future applications of ultrasound are particu-
larly of interest as it could serve as a low-cost
noninvasive
modality
for
vascular
inﬂamma-
tion detection.
The initial utility of ultrasound was in detection of
early inﬂammation in the murine aorta, a classic an-
imal model for cardiovascular disease. More recently,
microbubbles targeted at VCAM type 1 (VCAM-1), a
chemokine expressed by activated endothelial cells in
atherosclerosis,77 have facilitated use of ultrasound
scans
to
evaluate
arterial
inﬂammation
initially
in vitro.78 Noninvasive ultrasound has since been
shown to detect VCAM-1 on human carotid arterial
tissue
using
specialized
microbubbles
with
a
maleimide-thiol
conjugation
of
an
anti–VCAM-1
nanobody.79,80
Further
in
vitro
research
using
contrast-enhanced ultrasound and von Willebrand
factor A1–bearing microbubbles has been shown to
detect activated platelets on vascular endothelium
and indicate lesion severity in a rodent model of
atherosclerosis.81 The use of microbubbles has not yet
been validated in vivo in humans.
A recent translational study by Punjabi et al82
described
the
ability
of
VCAM-1–targeted
micro-
bubbles to detect treatment response to the glucagon-
like peptide-1 agonist liraglutide by monitoring the
VCAM-1 signal. This work shows the power of using
biochemically targeted ultrasound imaging to prove
molecular involvement in vivo. Intercellular adhesion
molecule 1–targeted nano-ultrasonic contrast also has
potential
for
future
technological
innovation
to
further
our
bottom-up
understanding
of
atherosclerosis.83
Furthermore, echocardiographic molecular imag-
ing of vascular endothelium has recently been shown
to detect reductions in pro-inﬂammatory signals (eg,
P-selectin, VCAM-1, von Willebrand factor) as a result
of anti–interleukin-1b therapy.84 Ultrasound there-
fore has the potential to evaluate the effects of

on
pro-
atherosclerotic
inﬂammation,
which
is
critical
to
spurring
future
development
of
inﬂammation-
targeted therapies.
Clinically,
the
utility
of
advanced
ultrasound
techniques for detecting carotid disease is being
increasingly
appreciated.
Intraplaque
neo-
vascularization is a marker of carotid instability, a
known
precursor
to
embolic
stroke,
but
is
not
detectable
with
Doppler
ultrasound;
contrast-
enhanced ultrasound can detect it only invasively.
Recently, however, superb microvascular imaging, a
noninvasive
technique
that
removes
noise
while
preserving low-velocity ﬂow signal, has been shown
to accurately detect intraplaque neovascularization.85
A prospective cohort study comparing superb micro-
vascular imaging against existing validated methods
for detecting carotid plaque instability (eg, contrast-
enhanced ultrasound, carotid-MRI and PET-18F-FDG,
histology) is currently being conducted; the results
have signiﬁcant potential implications for detection
of carotid inﬂammation and risk prediction of carotid
ischemic events beyond extent of stenosis.86
Overall, although the results to date suggest that
any
ultrasound-based
method
of
inﬂammation
detection can be expected to have limited sensitivity
relative to other imaging modalities, this is an area
that could yield promising results in the future. This
is especially true given that intravascular ultrasound
has not yet been tested with the techniques discussed
herein but could provide an exciting avenue for
further research with greater resolution of the rele-
vant tissues in real time.
MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING. Along with echo-
cardiography
and
PET,
CMR
imaging
is
widely
considered a key tool for the diagnosis of inﬂamma-
tory myocardial disease, with a Class I recommenda-
tion for the assessment of myocarditis and storage
diseases in the current European Society of Cardiol-
ogy guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of
acute and chronic heart failure.87 Despite CMR being

shown to be an excellent noninvasive tool for the
detection of myocardial inﬂammation in myocarditis,
its utility in clinical detection of vascular inﬂamma-
tion has not been successfully achieved, as the means
through which CMR detects myocardial disease do
not map well to the pathobiology underlying the
vascular
inﬂammatory
processes
occurring
in
atherosclerosis. In detecting myocarditis, CMR does
not directly assess immune cells but instead enables
the assessment of macroscopic responses to inﬂam-
matory processes and myocardial injury at a low-
resolution tissue level. The images acquired allow
the identiﬁcation of gross myocardial edema, vaso-
dilation, ﬁbrosis, and necrotic activity within the
myocardium.
Speciﬁc
CMR
sequences
have
been
shown to be useful for the assessment of inﬂamma-
tory pericardial disease. Such sequences include late
gadolinium enhancement, T2 short tau inversion re-
covery, and viability phase-sensitive inversion re-
covery, which are also sequences that have been
assessed
for
coronary
artery
inﬂamma-
tion detection.88
The
use
of
non–PET-MR
speciﬁcally
for
early
detection of vascular inﬂammation is therefore very
limited. Researchers continue to investigate means to
allow the analysis of standard CMR acquisitions to be
used for the identiﬁcation of vascular inﬂammation
as it would be an excellent addition to the clinical
value
achieved
from
this
commonly
performed
noninvasive modality. Compared with CT imaging,
CMR offers superior soft-tissue contrast, potentially
allowing improved detection of HRP characteristics
such
as
intraplaque
hemorrhage,
thrombus,
and
positive remodeling in large vessels. Importantly,
CMR does not involve exposure to ionizing radiation;
thus, if accurate means to assess both vascular plaque
and
the
associated
inﬂammation
burden
were
discovered, they stand to be very powerful clinical
tools.
PET-CT
IMAGING. Molecular imaging technologies
have emerged in the last decades as highly accurate
techniques for the investigation of vascular inﬂam-
mation
in
a
noninvasive
manner,89
allowing
detection
of
clinically
relevant
atherosclerotic
inﬂammation,90
with injectable
tracers
that bind
pathophysiology-speciﬁc receptors. The tracers are
then detected via PET. The exact mechanisms of the
relevance of PET to cardiology have been thoroughly
reviewed elsewhere.91 The most common intravenous
tracer agent used in PET is 18F-FDG. This agent can
noninvasively assess arterial inﬂammation as well as
other inﬂammatory processes throughout the body.

18F-FDG uptake reﬂects glucose metabolism, which is
particularly
increased
in
inﬂamed
atherosclerotic
disease exhibiting the retention of macrophages and
hypoxic stress.
18F-FDG has been used to assess the activity of
metabolically
active
inﬂammatory
cells
and
has
shown a preference for inﬂamed coronary plaque in
patients who have undergone proper preparation
(low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet to suppress myocar-
dial uptake of the tracer).92 Currently, 18F-FDG PET-
CT imaging is used in the clinic to assess myocardial
viability and blood ﬂow, as well as to detect and
monitor noncoronary conditions such as sarcoidosis
and myocarditis. It is also well validated for the
identiﬁcation of carotid plaque instability.85
Another
radiotracer,
gallium-68-labeled
DOTA-
TATE (68Ga-DOTATATE), can also provide clinically
useful images of vascular inﬂammation. This tracer is
widely used in imaging neuroendocrine tumors and
binds to the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SST2),
which is expressed by M1 pro-inﬂammatory macro-
phages. PET-CT images using 68Ga-DOTATATE have
been found to produce better image quality than
18F-FDG and can be used to identify inﬂamed coro-
nary lesions93 and residual inﬂammation in myocar-
dial tissue after an acute MI.94 Figure 7 illustrates the
use of 68Ga-DOTATATE for detection of coronary ar-
tery vascular inﬂammation compared with 18F-FDG.
Several other radiotracers have also shown promise
in imaging inﬂammation within the coronary wall.
For instance, 18F-NaF, which has a strong afﬁnity for
the vascular wall, has been shown to incorporate into
hydroxyapatite
in
areas
of
arterial
wall
micro-
calciﬁcation. Imaging with 18F-NaF has shown prom-
ising
accuracy
in
detecting
the
culprit
coronary
lesions and abdominal aortic aneurysms,95 with 18F-
NaF PET-CT imaging being the ﬁrst noninvasive im-
aging method to identify and localize ruptured and
high-risk coronary plaque.96 18F-NaF has been used to
investigate
developing
microcalciﬁcation
in
the
vasculature. Work from Dweck et al97 showed that
coronary uptake was associated with cardiovascular
risk, describing signiﬁcant associations between cor-
onary arterial NaF uptake and prior coronary events,
angina status, and Framingham risk scores. Recent
work from the same group has shown that in a small
cohort of patients with established CAD pooled from a
prospective observational study,
18F-NaF PET pro-
vides powerful independent prediction of fatal or
nonfatal MI.98 18F-ﬂuciclatide, a PET tracer that binds
to avb3 integrin, is also considered a promising tool
for identifying high-risk coronary plaque.99 Indeed,
small
studies
in
humans
have
shown
that
the
quantiﬁcation
of
avb3
integrin
expression
with
18F-ﬂuciclatide PET has potential to assess plaque
vulnerability
and
disease
activity
in
aortic
atherosclerosis.100
There is early evidence to suggest that the 18 kDa
translocator protein could be used as a target for
imaging inﬂammation using a speciﬁc PET-CT tracer.
For example, 11C-PK11195 has been used to this end,
although primarily in carotid disease cases. PET-CT
imaging using 11C-PK11195 has been found to distin-
guish between recently symptomatic and asymp-
tomatic plaque in carotid disease populations.101,102
Other experimental techniques have also been
explored to visualize coronary artery inﬂammation
using PET-CT imaging, such as visualizing chemokine
receptors, which are up-regulated in pro-inﬂammatory
macrophages, in experimental nanoplatforms,103 or
visualizing endothelial activation and inﬂammation
using
18F-labeled small VCAM-1 afﬁnity ligands.104
Magnetic resonance and optical detection technolo-
gies can be combined with PET to visualize inﬂamma-
tion by using 64Cu-labeled 20 nm magnetoﬂuorescent
polysaccharide-containing
nanoparticles,105
which
have been found to accumulate in macrophages in
atherosclerotic lesions in apolipoprotein E knock-out
mice.
Single-photon emission CT imaging/CT imaging
that uses
111In- and
123I-radiolabeled compounds is
another
experimental
approach
to
noninvasively
visualize coronary artery inﬂammation. These com-
pounds target activated matrix metallopeptidases
and allow
the
detection and tracking of
plaque
composition in response to treatment.106
Although
18F-FDG PET-CT imaging and increas-
ingly 18F-NaF are widely used for myocardial assess-
ment, the other mentioned techniques are currently
experimental
and
restricted
by
their
high
costs,
limited availability, and required expertise. As we
have discussed,
18F-FDG accumulation occurs with
PET-CT imaging in vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque.
From a clinician’s perspective, the main obstacle to
wider adoption of these techniques is a lack of clinical
availability, lack of expertise, and, most importantly,
a paucity of clinical evidence to show the trans-
lational potential of these PET-CT techniques for
reduction of either primary or secondary cardiovas-
cular risk.
PET-MRI TECHNOLOGY. As discussed earlier in rela-
tion to PET-CT imaging, 18F-FDG can assess arterial
inﬂammation in vivo because tracer uptake reﬂects,
at least in part, the presence of invading inﬂamma-
tory cells, including macrophages and foam cell for-
mation.107
MRI
can
also
provide
atherosclerotic
plaque detection and characterization; thus, hybrid

PET-MRI technology has the potential to simulta-
neously provide anatomical and functional informa-
tion.108 However, data on vascular PET-MRI remain
scarce,
with
the
focus
of
research
on
carotid
atherosclerosis.109
In recent work focused on the detection of vascular
inﬂammation in patients with large vessel vasculitis,
it has been shown that PET-MRI can be used to detect
active inﬂammation via the detection of SST2 as a
novel
inﬂammation-speciﬁc
molecular
marker.110
SST2
is
expressed
by
inﬂammatory
macrophages
activated in vitro, and SST2 staining colocalizes with
CD68þ macrophages within inﬂamed atherosclerotic
plaques. Of the somatostatin receptor PET tracers
used
for
clinical
neuroendocrine
tumor
imaging,
68Ga-DOTATATE has the highest binding afﬁnity for
SST2. A novel 18F click-labeled octreotide radioligand
called 18F-FET-bAG-TOCA has also shown high SST2-
binding afﬁnity and favorable tracer kinetics. SST2
PET-MRI was found to be consistent with 18F-FDG
PET-CT imaging in patients with large vessel vascu-
litis. Resolution of the PET-MRI clinical images was
found to be suitable for coronary and intracranial
arteries.
Other experimental PET-MRI probes are currently
in development for inﬂammatory purposes. These
include
18ﬂuorine-ﬂuoromethylcholine,
which
has
shown better identiﬁcation of atherosclerotic plaque
and
lower
myocardial
uptake
compared
with
18F-FDG in murine models. Current trials of this
probe include a PET-MRI study recruiting those with
ACS who will undergo optical coherence tomography
to investigate if intravascular ﬁndings of high-risk
plaque
correlate
with
18ﬂuorine-ﬂuoromethylcho-
line uptake on PET-MRI (NCT03252990). There are
also a number of small clinical studies investigating
the use of cell adhesion motifs for inﬂammatory
imaging
in
atherosclerosis.
One
of
the
most
advanced is tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), which
was originally identiﬁed as the sequence within
ﬁbronectin that mediates cell attachment. The RGD
motif has now been found in numerous other pro-
teins and has been identiﬁed as a key molecule that
supports cell adhesion within atherosclerotic plaque.
An ongoing 18F-FPPRGD2 study is exploring the use
of these probes in both PET-MRI and PET-CT imag-
ing in a cohort of carotid endarterectomy patients
(NCT02995642).
CONCLUSIONS
The ﬁeld of noninvasive clinical imaging of vascular
inﬂammation
has
undergone
signiﬁcant
advance-
ments in recent years (Table 1). The integration of
various imaging modalities into clinical practice such
as CT and molecular imaging with PET-CT imaging
has allowed for a more comprehensive and accurate
assessment of the presence and extent of vascular
inﬂammation, particularly in the coronary arteries.
The application of image analysis techniques on im-
aging data sets (eg, perivascular FAI Score and radi-
otranscriptomic phenotyping from routine coronary
CTA) have shown very promising results in the use of
vascular inﬂammation as part of CAD risk stratiﬁca-
tion. Ongoing studies are expected to validate their
clinical
utility,
economic
feasibility,
and
overall
impact on clinical management in primary and sec-
ondary prevention.
