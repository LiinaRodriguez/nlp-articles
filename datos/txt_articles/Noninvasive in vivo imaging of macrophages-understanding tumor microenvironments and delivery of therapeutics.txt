Abstract
Macrophages are pivotal in the body’s defense and response to inflammation. They are present in significant 
numbers and are widely implicated in various diseases, including cancer. While molecular and histological 
techniques have advanced our understanding of macrophage biology, their precise function within the cancerous 
microenvironments remains underexplored. Enhancing our knowledge of macrophages and the dynamics 
of their extracellular vesicles (EVs) in cancer development can potentially improve therapeutic management. 
Notably, macrophages have also been harnessed to deliver drugs. Noninvasive in vivo molecular imaging of 
macrophages is crucial for investigating intricate cellular processes, comprehending the underlying mechanisms 
of diseases, tracking cells and EVs’ migration, and devising macrophage-dependent drug-delivery systems in living 
organisms. Thus, in vivo imaging of macrophages has become an indispensable tool in biomedical research. The 
integration of multimodal imaging approaches and the continued development of novel contrast agents hold 
promise for overcoming current limitations and expanding the applications of macrophage imaging. This study 
comprehensively reviews several methods for labeling macrophages and various imaging modalities, assessing 
the merits and drawbacks of each approach. The review concludes by offering insights into the applicability of 
molecular imaging techniques for real time monitoring of macrophages in preclinical and clinical scenarios.

Introduction
The activity and profile of immune cell infiltrates in 
tumors significantly influence cancer outcomes. Non­
invasive molecular imaging has proven beneficial for a 
comprehensive understanding of tumor-immune cell 
interactions. Molecular Imaging utilizes techniques to 
visualize the cells, either through modification of the 
cell (i.e. transfection of genetic reporters) or loaded with 
imaging agents before being injected into subjects. These 
immune cells then navigate the bloodstream and target 
specific sites in the tumor microenvironment (TME). 
Additionally, they can act as therapeutic vehicles due to 
their intrinsic surface properties, which facilitate chemi­
cal conjugation and targeted delivery of therapeutic 
agents [1–3]. Presently, antitumor immunity in cancer 
patients is assessed using tissue biopsies and blood bio­
markers. However, these invasive methods lack spatial 
information and do not provide a comprehensive view 
of the TME, particularly regarding the tumor’s potential 
heterogeneity. Thus, as an alternative strategy, noninva­
sive methods for imaging immunoregulatory cells, such 
as macrophages and cytotoxic immune cells, are being 
promoted and have shown promise in preclinical and 
clinical settings [1, 4].
Molecular imaging involves noninvasive monitoring 
and recording of the biological processes at the cellular 
and molecular levels in intact living cells [5]. It has been 
widely used in both animal models and clinical settings. 
Noninvasive molecular imaging methods include fluores­
cence, bioluminescence, magnetic resonance, and nuclear 
imaging. Additionally, when coupled with comprehen­
sive vascular assessment, multimodal imaging provides 
more accurate information on tumor biology, enhanc­
ing the clinical value of molecular imaging [6]. Intrigu­
ingly, molecular imaging of the migration and infiltration 
of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including cytotoxic 
T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages, has 
shown success preclinically and clinically, demonstrating 
great potential in the field [1, 7, 8]. Activated T cells are 
major contributors to antitumor immunity, making their 
tracking of particular interest. For example, upregulated 
surface protein markers (e.g., OX40, ICOS, and CD25) 
or secreted markers (e.g., IFN-γ and Granzyme B) are 
attractive targets for the noninvasive imaging of activated 
T cells [1]. Additionally, optical imaging of NK cells, 
either transfected with fluorescence or luminescence 
genes or labeled with dyes, has facilitated tracking their 
migration and infiltration in tumors [5, 7].
Macrophages, the predominant myeloid population of 
tumor-infiltrating innate immune cells, are categorized 
into tumor-promoting and tumor-inhibiting macro­
phages. Both categories have been imaged by targeting 
the CD11b+ myeloid cells in the TME [9]. The tumor-
promoting population, known as tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs), is the most abundant myeloid 
population infiltrating the TME, and their abundance 
correlates with poor patient survival in most cancers [9–
11]. TAMs have been implicated in developing resistance 
to therapies, including resistance to immune checkpoint 
inhibitors in several cancer types [12, 13]. Hence, track­
ing macrophages and their function within tumors is 
crucial for comprehending the TME, elucidating underly­
ing disease mechanisms, and designing potential macro­
phage-based therapies and drug-delivery systems.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized membra­
nous vesicles released by almost all cells into extracellular 
space and invitro into culture media. EVs are generally 
classified into exosome (small EVs), microvesicles and 
apoptotic bodies based their biogenesis. Exosomes are 
released into extracellular space upon fusion of multi­
vesicular bodies and the plasma membrane are released 
from the surface of cells. Whereas apoptotic bodies 
released during the cells undergoing apoptosis. EVs 
plays a vital role in cell-to-cell communication in adja­
cent and distance cells as they carry various biologically 
active materials such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids 
[14, 15]. Recent evidence indicates that EVs play a cru­
cial role in key physiological and pathological processes, 
including cellular homeostasis, infection, and cancer. The 
growing recognition of EVs as potential biomarkers and 
therapeutic tools has sparked increased interest in their 
study [14, 16, 17].
We aim to delve into recent findings regarding the 
association of TAMs with cancer pathology and pro­
gression and their utilization in drug-delivery strategies. 
Barone et al. [18] focused mostly on the EV categories 
that are utilized for cancer research and TAM-EV based 
nanomedicines for cancer treatment. In current review, 
we emphasize the various noninvasive methods for imag­
ing macrophages and their EVs in cancer. We also portray 
how these methods hold tremendous potential for broad 
clinical applications and provide valuable insights into 
characterizing biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In 
summary, this review offers a comprehensive analysis of 
preclinical theranostic approaches for TAMs, highlight­
ing diverse imaging strategies and their clinical relevance 
in ongoing human trials. The knowledge gained would 
help understand the immunosuppressive effects exerted 
by TAMs on cytotoxic immune cells, thereby contribut­
ing to the battle against tumor progression.
Macrophages
Macrophages are multifunctional immune cells found 
in mammalian tissues. Initially described by Elie Metch­
nikoff as phagocytic cells [19], early research focused on 
their roles in host defense against infections, regulating 
housekeeping genes to remove apoptotic cells and extra­
cellular matrix (ECM) remodeling [20]. However, recent 
Page 3 of 25
Gangadaran et al. Biomarker Research           (2025) 13:20 
studies have expanded our understanding of macro­
phages, highlighting their generic roles in metabolism, 
tissue homeostasis, and development [21, 22]. Tissue-
resident macrophages are known to be involved in the 
development of organs such as the brain, bone, and ova­
ries, as well as in tissue repair by sensing damage signals 
[20, 23]. They release growth factors that aid in functions 
like neuronal patterning, branching morphogenesis, 
bone morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and adipose tissue 
formation [23]. In addition to their physiological roles, 
macrophages contribute to the pathology of various dis­
eases, including osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, fibrosis, 
and cancer [20]. While macrophage activation through 
cytokines and bacterial products was initially found to 
kill cancer cells, later studies revealed that macrophages 
are often present in leukocyte infiltrates within tumor tis­
sues. Upon interaction with the TME, these infiltrates are 
driven toward an immunosuppressive TAM phenotype, 
facilitating cancer progression and therapy resistance [8, 
24, 25].
Classification of macrophages
Macrophages are classified into two main categories: 
macrophage 1 (M1) and macrophage 2 (M2). These clas­
sifications reflect the diversity of macrophages represent­
ing the extreme states of in vitro polarization [26]. This 
categorization has also been adopted to classify macro­
phages in vivo (Fig.  1A). Treatment with proinflamma­
tory cytokines (e.g., TNF and interferons) or bacterial 
products (e.g., lipopolysaccharide) induces the polariza­
tion of macrophages to an M1 phenotype. Meanwhile, 
immunoregulatory cytokines such as TGFβ, IL-4, and 
IL-10 induces an M2 phenotype in the macrophages. This 
M2 polarization promotes the secretion of proangiogenic 
factors (e.g., VEGF) and tissue-remodeling enzymes (e.g., 
matrix metalloproteinases), which facilitate tumor pro­
gression [27–29]. In contrast, M1 macrophages release 
anti-angiogenic factors, such as IL-12 and CXCL10, and 
are associated with antitumor immunity [30].
Interestingly, TAMs do not strictly conform to the M1 
and M2 phenotypes. Single-cell sequencing has been 
employed to address this limitation, allowing for a more 
detailed classification of macrophages into additional 
subtypes: M2a, M2b, M2c, and M2d [31–33]. Despite the 
different subtypes’ characterization, understanding each 
subtype’s precise function in tumor survival and progres­
sion remains challenging [34]. Moreover, TAM subpopu­
lations often coexpress both M1 and M2 gene signatures, 
underscoring the heterogeneity of TAMs [35], thereby 
suggesting new directions for targeted therapy.
TAMs
As mentioned above, TAMs are significant components 
of the TME and are associated with poor prognosis and 
drug resistance in tumors [36]. In patients with classic 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma, an increase in TAMs is strongly 
associated with shortened survival, highlighting TAMs as 
biomarkers for risk stratification [37]. Tumor cells secrete 
growth factors and cytokines that attract macrophages 
and induce them into a protumorigenic profile, contrib­
uting to poor clinical outcomes in various cancers [38, 
39].
TAMs are derived from two major macrophage popu­
lations. One population consists of macrophages that dif­
ferentiate from yolk sac–derived precursors, which can 
self-renew during a steady state and an infection. The 
other population originates from bone marrow-derived 
monocytes (BMDMs), which give rise to macrophages 
in the intestine and dermis [40]. For example, in glioblas­
toma, a grade IV lethal form of brain tumor, TAMs are 
primarily derived from monocytes that extravasate from 
the blood circulation and infiltrate the inflamed brain tis­
sue, where they were differentiated from bone marrow-
derived macrophages [13, 41]. However, understanding 
the specific origin of macrophages for different cancer 
subtypes remains limited [40].
Activated TAMs can produce various factors that gen­
erate the hallmarks of cancer, including inducing angio­
genesis, sustaining proliferative signaling, disrupting the 
immune system, evading growth suppression, enhanc­
ing metastasis and invasion, and suppressing cell death 
pathways [42]. For instance, cancer cells secrete suc­
cinate to polarize macrophages into TAMs, promoting 
cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis through 
the PI3K-HIFα axis [43]. Similarly, the secretion of the 
allergic mediator, histamine, by cancer cells and the neu­
rotransmitter GABA by B cells contributes to the gen­
eration of tumor-promoting TAMs [44, 45]. Additionally, 
beyond polarization, cancer cells stimulate TAM ampli­
fication by secreting colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1, 
a key regulator that sustains the protumorigenic func­
tions of TAMs), the E3 ligase Cop1, and the metabolite 
β-glucosylceramide, all of which enhance TAM activity 
[46–48]. Zhu et al.. recently reviewed the pivotal role of 
macrophages in the innate immune system and the TME, 
particularly in thyroid cancer (TC). Their review high­
lights the dual nature of TAMs in TC progression, exam­
ining their polarization, gene mutations, and M2-like 
TAM-centered therapeutic strategies [49]. Finally, intra­
vital imaging studies have demonstrated long-term phys­
ical interactions exist between TAMs and CD8+ effector 
T, leading to T-cell exhaustion [50] (Fig. 1B).
Macrophages and drug delivery
Due to the phagocytic activity of macrophages, their 
tumor homing capability, and their efficacy in killing 
cancer cells, macrophages especially the M1 subtype, 
have been widely exploited as carriers or vehicles for

drug delivery [51, 52]. These drug-delivery systems uti­
lize the surface protein markers of macrophages to tar­
get cancers. Apart from the macrophages themselves, 
macrophage-derived EVs, the secretory vesicles released 
from macrophages, play an important role in intercellular 
communication and are broadly used for drug-delivery 
vehicles in cancerous diseases. EVs in general are classi­
fied into the following categories based on their size: (i) 
exosomes (30–150  nm), (ii) microvesicles or ectosomes 
(50 nm–1 μm), and (iii) apoptotic bodies (50 nm–5 μm) 
[53, 54]. Among these, exosomes originate from late 
endosomes and are secreted by the fusion of late endo­
somes with the plasma membrane [55]. Therefore, mac­
rophage derived EVs, especially the exosomes, inherit 
the phenotypic and functional properties of their par­
ent macrophage subtype, and could be used in studying 
TAM function in the TME and in delivering therapeutics. 
Additionally, macrophage membranes have been used 
to coat nanoparticles directly, which serve as anticancer 
drug-delivery vehicles [53].
Macrophage-mediated drug delivery
As previously stated, macrophages are efficient and ver­
satile carriers for anticancer drugs. They can circulate 
in the bloodstream alongside red blood cells and neu­
trophils and target cancer cells by binding their α4β1 
integrins to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 on cancer 
cells. M1-like macrophages derived from BMDMs and 
the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 are widely used for 
tumor-targeting applications [53, 56]. These direct carri­
ers of anticancer drugs are generated by incubating the 
macrophages with the drugs. In one study, doxorubicin 
(DOX)-loaded RAW 264.7 macrophages prolonged the 
survival of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, with DOX-loading 
not significantly affecting macrophage viability and func­
tion [57]. Additionally, DOX-loaded M1 macrophages 
transferred DOX to ovarian cancer cells through a tun­
neling nanotube pathway, similar to virus transfer, which 
inhibited tumor invasion more efficiently than liposome-
DOX [58]. Despite these benefits, the use of RAW 264.7 
cells remains controversial due to their transformed 
nature, which means they lack some of the phenotypical 
and functional characteristics of primary macrophages. 
Moreover, using primary macrophages presents its chal­
lenges, including the potential for inflammation, develop­
ment of a pro-tumorigenic phenotype leading to immune 
tolerance, and possible off-target effects [59–61].
Besides the mentioned drawbacks, when macrophages 
are used as direct carriers, the cytotoxic effects of drugs 
on macrophages remain a bottleneck and require moni­
toring [53]. As a result, most applications use macro­
phages as indirect carriers wherein nanoparticles (NPs) 
containing drugs are loaded onto macrophages to help 
reduce drug toxicity and increase the drug dose. For 
example, macrophages loaded with N-succinyl-N′-octyl 
chitosan (SOC)-paclitaxel (PTX) demonstrated higher 
therapeutic efficiency than PTX-loaded macrophages due 
to their higher drug-loading efficiency [62]. Moreover, 
NP-loaded M1-like macrophages could cross the blood-
brain barrier, showing favorable brain distribution and 
enhanced survival in glioma-bearing mice treated with 
DOX-loaded M1 macrophages [63]. The macrophages 
endocytosed and released the loaded drugs; however, 
most drugs were degraded during this process, which 
remained the study’s limitation. This issue was potentially 
overcome by Doshi et al., who developed phagocytosis-
resistant backpacks, wherein loaded microparticles were 
attached to the macrophages’ surface rather than the 
drug being engulfed [64] (Fig. 2).
Macrophage-derived EVs mediated drug delivery
As described earlier, M1-like macrophage-derived exo­
somes (M1-exos) have surface membrane properties like 
their parent macrophages and could be used as therapeu­
tic anticancer agents. For instance, a nanoformulation 
of M1-exos loaded with PTX efficiently treated drug-
resistant tumors [65]. However, this study used exosomes 
from RAW 264.7 cells. It remains to be seen if using 
macrophage exosomes derived from BMDMs would 
yield better outcomes. Surface receptors could also be 
targeted, for example, M2-polarized TAMs express 
higher levels of the interleukin-4 receptor (IL4R) than 
M1-polarized macrophages [66] In a study by Gunassek­
aran et al., engineered M1-derived exosomes transfected 
with NF-κB p50 siRNA and miR-511–3p, termed Exo(si/
mi), were utilized to promote M1 polarization and tar­
get IL4R. Whole-body fluorescence imaging revealed 
that DiD-labeled IL4R-Exo(si/mi) exosomes successfully 
reprogrammed tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) 
into an M1 phenotype, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. 
IL4R-Exo(si/mi) exosomes were efficiently internalized by 
M2 macrophages, leading to a decrease in M2 markers, 
an increase in M1 markers, and more efficient suppres­
sion of target genes compared to control exosomes. Fur­
thermore, imaging demonstrated that IL4R-Exo(si/mi) 
exosomes accumulated in tumors more effectively than 
untargeted exosomes. Notably, systemic IL4R-Exo(si/
mi) administration hindered tumor growth, lowered M2 
cytokines and immune-suppressive cell levels, and ele­
vated M1 cytokines and immune-stimulatory cell levels, 
significantly outperforming control exosomes. Despite 
not thoroughly addressing the polarization mechanisms 
and their effects on the TME, the study highlights IL4R-
Exo(si/mi) as a promising cancer immunotherapy strat­
egy [67].
Aside from acting as drug carriers, M1-exos release 
antitumor 
cytokines, 
enhancing 
their 
cytotoxic 
effects [68]. M1-exos can also serve as adjuvants for 
Page 6 of 25
Gangadaran et al. Biomarker Research           (2025) 13:20 
cancer vaccines; however, the mechanistic understand­
ing behind this remains limited [69]. Exosome-mediated 
therapy in tumors also faces cost-benefit due to the low 
yield. To address this, exosome-mimetic nanovesicles 
have been developed to overcome the low yield problem 
in exosome purification. In a study by Choo et al., such 
M1-exo-mimetics polarized M2-like macrophages to an 
M1-like phenotype, thereby enhancing the efficacy of 
anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapies [70]. 
Taken together, macrophage-derived exosomes target 
malignant tumors and modulate the immunosuppressive 
TME [53] (Fig. 2).
Noninvasive in vivo imaging modalities: 
monitoring macrophage migration and infiltration 
into tumors
The utilization of light for visualizing cells and tissues 
has been a consistently insightful and straightforward 
method in basic research and medical diagnostic imag­
ing. In vivo monitoring of macrophage migration and 
infiltration into tumors can be achieved through the vari­
ous noninvasive molecular imaging methods discussed 
below. These techniques facilitate visualization and quan­
tification of the behavior and dynamics of TAMs in the 
TME, providing valuable insights into tumor progression 
and therapeutic responses.
Fluorescence imaging
Over the past decade, significant advancements in the 
engineering and application of fluorescent proteins have 
expanded their utility in imaging, enabling more precise 
visualization of biological processes [71, 72]. These pro­
teins have revolutionized the ability to track and study 
cellular and molecular processes in real-time, offer­
ing unprecedented insights into biological systems. In 
vivo fluorescent imaging with living organisms mirrors 
the principles of fluorescence microscopy [73], which 
involves transducing cells of interest with green or red 
fluorescent proteins or reporter genes for live imaging 
[74]. Additionally, fluorescent agents such as dyes Cya­
nine 5, Cyanine 7, and DiR: 1,1’-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3’,3’-
tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodide, with appropriate 
emission wavelength and photostability, are employed for 
in vivo cell imaging investigation [75, 76]. Overall, fluo­
rescence imaging offers comparatively lower expenses 
and high spatial resolution, which is particularly evident 
when investigating reporter gene systems in small ani­
mals like rodents. Furthermore, unlike bioluminescence 
imaging (discussed below), fluorescence imaging does 
not require a substrate. However, its sensitivity is com­
promised by autofluorescence issues [77] (Table 1). Flu­
orescence imaging techniques are widely used to track 
TAMs in cancer studies. A study by Sun et al. conducted 
Fig. 2  Drug delivery using macrophages or their EVs. Recent understanding of macrophages seems diverse in terms of functions in many diseases. 
Macrophages have gained increasing interest as critical therapeutic targets. When developing drug carriers, understanding their biological roles in bio­
distribution, cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking, and drug release is essential for efficient targeting. Macrophage-derived EVs also play a vital role in 
tumor progression. Their use as natural nanovesicles for therapeutic drug loading has many benefits in blood-brain barrier penetration, whereas other 
synthetic nanoparticles showed failed blood-brain barrier penetration. Created with BioRender.com

fluorescent imaging of TAM in breast tumor-bearing 
mice, using CD206 antibody-coated NIR-emitting fluo­
rescent dye (NIRF) and dye-IgG as controls. Both probes 
were intravenously injected into the mice. In vivo NIRF 
imaging revealed that signals were present as early as 2 h 
post-injection and continued to be detecTables 8 and 24, 
and 48 h., the time point at which TAMs were detected in 
the tumors (Table 2). While the control dye-IgG was also 
detected in the tumors at all the mentioned time points, it 
was present at significantly lower levels. Ex vivo imaging 
further confirmed a two-fold greater signal in the tumor 
following NIRF-CD206 injection than dye-IgG. Addi­
tionally, the NIRF-CD206 signal colocalized with F4/80+ 
TAMs, unlike the controls. Therefore, the study showed 
that CD206-targeted molecular imaging could sensi­
tively detect the dynamic changes in TAMs. A similar 
approach was utilized in the study by Zhang et al., where 
an antibody of CD206-NIRF dye was used to visualize the 
TAM in the mouse breast tumor. The CD206-NIRF dye 
was intravenously injected into the mice and imaged after 
24  h. In vivo fluorescent imaging showed a significant 
dye accumulation in the tumor region and lymph node 
(LN) metastasis compared to the free dye. Thus, this 
study also confirmed that CD206-targeted imaging can 
sensitively detect TAMs in the tumors and LN metasta­
sis [112] (Table 2). However, given the heterogeneity of 
TAMs within and across tumors, the technique utilized 
in the abovementioned studies offers limited potential 
for clinical translation. Safety of most of fluorescent dyes 
(except indocyanine green) is not validated for human 
use. Moreover, shared markers between immune cells 
make the method susceptible to a lack of sensitivity.

(BMV083-Cy5) in breast orthotopic tumor-bearing mice 
for TAM identification. The BMV083-Cy5 probe was 
intravenously injected into the orthotopic tumor-bear­
ing mice, and an in vivo fluorescent signal was detected 
in the tumor 10  h post-injection (Table  2). Since fluo­
rescence imaging suffers from the limitation of lower 
sensitivity than bioluminescence (Table  1), the authors 
labeled the 4T1 tumor cells with luc-GFP to demarcate 
the tumor boundary using luciferase bioluminescence, 
while the localization of the BMV083 was determined 
by Cy5 fluorescence. Interestingly, the BMV083 sig­
nal primarily colocalized with the F4/80+ macrophages, 
establishing TAMs as the significant source of cyste­
ine cathepsin activity in the TME [113]. However, the 
authors identified F4/80hi as the primary BMV083+ cells 
and classified them M2-macrophages. This classification 
remains a shortcoming given the redundancy of F4/80 
expression on other macrophage subtypes, including 
M1-macrophages [114]. A potential method to overcome 
such limitation could involve conjugating fluorescent 
probes to antibodies or ligands specific to macrophage 
surface markers or TAM-related antigens, allowing for 
highly specific targeting [112, 115, 116]. Another study 
by Zambito et al. utilized a similar combination of fluo­
rescence and bioluminescence imaging to track TAMs. 
The authors used engineered macrophages (BMC2) as 
sensors for metastatic melanoma, demonstrated through 
dual-color in vivo imaging. Macrophages expressing the 
green click green luciferase and labelled with the NIR dye 
were attracted to melanoma cells expressing near-infra­
red click beetle luciferase, detectable through real-time 
imaging up to 72  h after injection (Table  2). The study 
shows potential in early detection and effective treat­
ment strategy for melanoma, which usually suffers from 
poor prognosis upon metastasis. Thus, optical imaging 
can potentially detect noninvasive metastatic melanoma 
using circulating macrophages [76].

In human hepatoma tumor-bearing mice, the in vivo 
fluorescent imaging of TAM was conducted by intrave­
nously injecting deoxy mannose (DM), a high-affinity 
ligand of mannose receptor, labeled with the NIR dye 
cyanine 7 (Cy7). The authors observed specific signals 
in the tumor as early as 1 h. post-injection, which gradu­
ally stabilized at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h (Table 2), and the fluo­
rescence slightly decreased over time. Ex vivo imaging 
further confirmed the presence of TAMs in the tumors 
using DM-Cy7 [117]. Now, mannose receptors may also 
be present on other immune cells or cell types within the 
TME [118]. Thus, the specificity of mannose labeling for 
TAMs must be carefully validated when such methods 
are translated into clinical studies.
Thus, fluorescence imaging alone, and in combination 
with bioluminescence, offers a powerful tool for study­
ing TAMs in the TME and in monitoring treatment out­
comes. However, the method suffers from limitations of 
photobleaching, which shortens the duration of in vivo 
imaging experiments [5, 7, 119, 120]. Additionally, tissues 
may exhibit autofluorescence, which can interfere with 
specific signal detection [78, 121, 122] (Table 1).
Bioluminescence imaging
Bioluminescence imaging operates through light produc­
tion from enzymatic oxidation reactions involving lucif­
erases such as Firefly luciferase (Fluc), Renilla luciferase 
(Rluc), Gaussia luciferase (Gluc), and their substrates 
like D-Luciferin or coelenterazine [123]. These lucifer­
ase enzymes can function as molecular reporting devices 
when introduced into a biological system, typically 
through transfection with their encoding genes [124, 
125]. In contrast to fluorescence imaging, biolumines­
cence doesn’t rely on an external light source. This, cou­
pled with the absence of endogenous bioluminescence in 
tissues, allows for greater sensitivities and higher signal-
to-background ratios compared to fluorescence tech­
niques [83, 126, 127]. However, as mentioned above, the 
clinical translatability of bioluminescence may be limited 
by substrate requirements and the spatial resolution for 
detailed cellular imaging is compromised compared to 
fluorescence imaging techniques. Moreover, enzymes 
such as luciferases and their cofactors, which are com­
monly used in the bioluminescence imaging modality, are 
of foreign origin and can trigger an immune response in 
the host [85–87]. This antigenic stimulation may result 
in the production of neutralizing antibodies, potentially 
causing hypersensitivity and inflammation, thereby limit­
ing their use in clinical studies (Table 1).
In a study by Choi et al., genetically labeled RAW 264.7 
cells with enhanced firefly luciferase (effluc), referred 
to as Raw/effluc, were used. The study visualized the 
intravenously injected Raw/effluc cells in the murine 
colon (CT26) tumor-bearing mice using bioluminescent 
imaging in vivo. The findings demonstrated increased 
prostate cancer targeting of the genetically engineered 
Raw/effluc cells, resulting in increased tumor size. Con­
sequently, in mice monitored by bioluminescent imaging, 
macrophage cells migrated to the colon tumor and trans­
formed into tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), 
thereby promoting tumor growth [128]. While the study 
was restricted to a preclinical setting and requires further 
validation in human colon cancer samples, it does dem­
onstrate the potential of reporter gene-based methods in 
tracking TAM dynamics in tumors.
Taken together, bioluminescence imaging offers advan­
tages such as low background signal and reduced false-
negative results when imaging macrophages or TAMs. 
Additionally, it allows for the long-term, longitudinal 
study of macrophage or TAM behavior without the need 
for repeated injections [88, 120, 126] (Table 1). Thus, the 
choice between fluorescence or bioluminescence imag­
ing techniques or a combination strategy depends on the 
research question, the biological system under study, and 
the desired imaging parameters (Table 1).
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
Magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, utilizes strong 
magnetic fields and radio waves to generate highly 
detailed images of the body’s internal structures with 
exceptional clarity and resolution. Unlike X-rays, CT 
scans, or PET scans, MRI does not involve ionizing radia­
tion. Instead, it capitalizes on the behavior of hydrogen 
atoms in the body’s tissues when subjected to magnetic 
fields(1H-MRI). In MRI cell tracking, iron oxide nanopar­
ticles are frequently employed as contrast agents. These 
nanoparticles contain unpaired electrons that align with 
the applied magnetic field, creating local magnetic field 
inhomogeneities. These inhomogeneities affect the relax­
ation times (T1, T2, and T3*) of nearby hydrogen nuclei, 
enhancing image contrast and enabling precise cell track­
ing [5, 129–131]. Superparamagnetic iron oxides (SPIOs), 
ranging from 50 to 100 nm, and ultra-small paramagnetic 
iron oxides (USPIOs) with diameters less than 50 nm are 
widely employed in MRI for cell tracking due to their 
magnetic properties [132]. However, despite high ana­
tomical resolution, MRI suffers from certain disadvan­
tages. This includes lower sensitivity compared to PET or 
SPECT, and longer scanning times [133]. Apart from the 
mentioned shortcomings, MRI also suffers from chemi­
cal shift artifacts. These artifacts arise due to differences 
in the resonance frequencies of hydrogen nuclei in vari­
ous chemical environments, such as fat and water. The 
variations in local magnetic fields experienced by protons 
in these environments cause slight frequency differences, 
which can distort images and lead to spatial misregistra­
tion or signal cancellation [92, 93] (Table 1).

Where optical imaging (fluorescence and biolumines­
cence) has limited tissue penetration [7, 120, 134], MRI 
provides excellent tissue permeation, making MRI more 
suitable for visualizing macrophages and TAMs in deep 
tissues [7, 129]. Accordingly, in a study by Cho et al., 
peritoneal macrophages from BALB/c nude mice were 
evaluated for viability, phagocytotic capacity, and migra­
tory activity using the MRI. The T2* of labeled macro­
phages was assessed using a clinical 1.5 T MR scanner. 
Specifically, the authors induced metastatic lymph nodes 
(LNs) in the nude mice and intravenously administered 
2 × 106 macrophages labeled with 50 mg Fe/mL ferromag­
netic iron-oxide nanocubes (FIONs). After one day, 3D 
T2*-weighted gradient-recalled-echo MR images were 
acquired, and the percentage of pixels below the signal 
intensity threshold was recorded as FION hypointensity. 
Though the study did not differentiate between the M1 
or M2 categories of macrophages in their results, nor did 
it address the time-dependent changes in the injected 
macrophages, it did observe that the FION-labeled mac­
rophages targeted the primary tumors and LN metasta­
ses (12% FION-macrophage hypointensity compared to 
2% of FIONs alone). Thus, the study implied that mac­
rophages could be clinically helpful in delivering thera­
pies to both tumors and LN metastases [135] (Table 2), 
although the clinical translation of this method remains 
underexplored.
As described earlier, TAMs encompass diverse sub­
types, including M2 macrophages, which are known to 
fuel tumor growth and metastasis through proangiogenic 
and growth factor secretion. Consequently, M2 mac­
rophage depletion has been widely explored as a novel 
anticancer strategy [136], for instance, in a study by Mel­
ancon et al. This study crafted a dual magneto-optical 
probe, PG-Gd-NIR813, to aid in the noninvasive visual­
ization of TAMs after intravenous injection. In rats with 
C6 tumors, PG-Gd-NIR813 showed maximum tumor 
uptake at 48 h (Table 2), as confirmed by in vivo/ex vivo 
optical imaging and T1-weighted MRI. The probe accu­
mulated in necrotic tumor regions and was reduced upon 
macrophage depletion achieved by clodronate liposomes. 
Furthermore, immunostaining linked PG-Gd-NIR813 
with TAM markers CD68, CD163 and CD169. How­
ever, the probe didn’t efficiently differentiate between 
the tumor-infiltrating monocytes, as indicated by the 
CD68 staining, which is a macrophage/monocyte marker. 
Moreover, monocytes also express CD163 and CD169 
during inflammation [137, 138], which further under­
scores the probe’s limitation. Nonetheless, the technique 
highlights PG-Gd-NIR813’s potential for imaging antitu­
mor responses and as a carrier for immunotherapeutic 
targeting TAMs [116].
In another study by Agighi et al., 20 patients (10 
lymphoma, 10 bone sarcoma) were examined using 
ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI 24–48  h after injection, 
followed by tumor biopsy/resection and macrophage 
staining. The potential of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI 
to distinguish tumors with different TAM content was 
evaluated by comparing the T2* relaxation times of lym­
phomas and bone sarcomas. Strikingly, the tumor T2* 
values positively correlated with the CD68+ (r=-0.68, 
P = 0.031) and CD163+ (r=-0.76; P = 0.010) TAM quanti­
ties, as observed by histopathology. Although the authors 
utilized CD68+ and CD163+ markers for TAMs, which 
lack a macrophage-specific expression [137, 138]. Addi­
tionally, both bone sarcomas and lymphomas displayed 
different MRI enhancements and TAM density (P < 0.05). 
Now, whether these differences existed due to differences 
in the tumor composition or TAM phenotypes (M1 or 
M2) is not commented upon. Nonetheless, the study pro­
vides clinical evidence of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI as 
a useful method for categorizing patients with TAM-rich 
tumors for immune-targeted treatments and tracking 
therapy responses [139].
In another study, the iron-oxide nanoparticle uptake 
was compared between F4/80- mammary carcinoma 
cells and F4/80+ TAMs. Remarkably, TAMs phagocy­
tosed iron-oxide nanoparticles more effectively (dR2 
TAM > dR2 cells; P < 0.05) than the tumor cells in vitro. 
The observed MRI enhancements at 1 and 24  h post-
injection correlated with TAM presence and were hin­
dered upon TAM depletion by the CSF1 antibody. These 
results suggest that TAM-mediated uptake of contrast 
agents acts as a primary source of MRI signal enhance­
ment and could serve as a new biomarker for progno­
sis, treatment guidance, and immune-targeted therapy 
assessment for breast cancer [140]. However, the effects 
of the probe uptake on the TAM phenotype and whether 
this uptake is specific to a particular subset of TAM 
remain unexplained. A similar correlation between 
TAMs and the MRI-iron oxide probe uptake was 
reported by Leftin et al. In their study, the authors char­
acterized TAMs by analyzing iron distribution on MRI 
with and without the administration of dextran–ultra-
small superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) in ortho­
topic MMTV-PyMT murine mammary tumors. The 
specific experimental details are summarized in Table 2. 
Notably, the + USPIO group showed increased clusters 
of iron deposits at the tumor’s outer edges compared 
to the − USPIO group. This correlated positively with a 
higher frequency of iron+CD68+ and iron+CD206+ in the 
+ USPIO group than in the − USPIO group. While these 
results cannot be generalized to different tumor types 
due to the heterogeneity of the TME and the TAM com­
position, the authors suggested that spatial iron deposit 
distributions rather than the average of the region of 
interest enhance TAM characterization in breast cancer 
models [141].

Intriguingly, despite the many advantages of ¹H-MRI, 
its relatively low sensitivity has driven the development 
of various contrast agents. The introduction of a “sec­
ond color” MRI method has addressed several limita­
tions associated with traditional contrast agents, such 
as the need for pre-scans and the potential for artifacts 
caused by localization ambiguity. This advancement 
enhances the ability to distinguish between different tis­
sue types and improves overall imaging accuracy. In this 
context, ¹⁹F-MRI strategies, alongside ¹H-MRI, have gar­
nered significant attention. The advantages of ¹⁹F atoms 
include their absence in the human body and the linear 
relationship between ¹⁹F concentration and MRI signal, 
which enables quantitative analysis, compared to SPIO 
cell tracking which is semi-quantitative in nature. How­
ever, to achieve an adequate signal-to-noise ratio, high 
concentrations of ¹⁹F- based contrast agents may be nec­
essary, which can lead to increased cytotoxicity in vivo. 
This trade-off between signal strength and potential tox­
icity remains a challenge in the application of ¹⁹F- based 
contrast MRI for in vivo imaging. Moreover, the stability 
of labeled nanoemulsions within the body, including their 
metabolism and clearance rates, needs to be carefully 
monitored to ensure reliable tracking over time [94–96]. 
Nonetheless, given the high sensitivity and specificity of 
¹⁹F- based contrast MRI, it is often employed in under­
standing TAMs in multiple tumor models. Makela et al. 
employed ¹⁹F- based contrast MRI to assess the density 
and distribution of macrophages within murine breast 
cancer tumors and associated metastases in vivo. The 
study involved implanting three murine breast cancer cell 
lines with varying metastatic potentials (4T1, 168FARN, 
and 67NR) into the mammary fat pads of mice. In vivo 
whole-body ¹⁹F- based contrast MRI was performed on 
tumor-bearing mice 24 h after the intravenous injection 
of a perfluorocarbon (PFC) agent, which was selectively 
taken up by macrophages in situ. The results showed 
that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were pre­
dominantly located in the periphery of primary tumors, 
with higher TAM numbers detected in the more aggres­
sive 4T1 tumors. Interestingly, tumors exhibited sig­
nificantly greater ¹⁹F signal intensity (spins/mm³) when 
smaller, suggesting increased TAM infiltration in early-
stage tumors. Additionally, ¹⁹F signals were observed in 
lung metastases of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, and fluores­
cence microscopy confirmed the presence of PFC-posi­
tive macrophages. These findings indicate that ¹⁹F-MRI 
can effectively detect and monitor TAMs in individual 
tumors, enabling the identification of tumors with sub­
stantial TAM infiltration. This technique could serve as a 
potential biomarker for tumor characteristics and might 
be applicable to other tumor types as well [142]. A recent 
study by Croci et al. utilized ¹⁹F- nanoparticle MRI to 
noninvasively track TAMs in glioma models. The authors 
intravenously injected ¹⁹F-PFC-containing nanoparticles 
(NPs) into tumor-bearing mice, successfully tracking 
TAMs over time and in response to radiotherapy. Addi­
tionally, they employed multispectral MRI with two dif­
ferent ¹⁹F-PFC-NPs to identify spatially and temporally 
distinct TAM niches in radiotherapy-recurrent murine 
gliomas. This approach enabled a deeper understand­
ing of the dynamic behavior and distribution of TAMs in 
the context of tumor recurrence and treatment response 
[143].
Thus, MRI-based TAM characterizations hold signifi­
cant implications in the realm of nanoparticle-enhanced 
macrophage imaging in cancer research. This is primarily 
due to the increased spatial resolution and contrast that 
MRI offers over optical imaging methods, as summarized 
in Table 1.
Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)
Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-
invasive imaging technique that complements standard 
MRI by analyzing the biochemical composition of tis­
sues. While MRI provides detailed anatomical informa­
tion, MRS focuses on measuring the concentration of 
specific metabolites within cells or regions of interest, 
offering deeper insights into cellular metabolism, pathol­
ogy, and disease progression. MRS detects signals emit­
ted by nuclei such as hydrogen (¹H), phosphorus (³¹P), or 
carbon (¹³C) when exposed to a magnetic field. These sig­
nals arise from variations in the chemical environment, 
known as “chemical shifts,” which result in distinct peaks 
on the MRS spectrum [97, 98]. Table 1 provides an over­
view of the key features of MRS, along with its advan­
tages and limitations.
Given its ability to assess physiological status, MRS 
has been utilized to investigate metabolic differences 
between M1 and M2 macrophages [99, 100]. However 
not many studies have employed MRS to investigate the 
physiology and detect the composition of TAMs in the 
TME. Nonetheless, a few studies, in combination with 
MRI, have incorporated MRS into multi-modal imag­
ing strategies for macrophages. Liu et al. developed MRI 
probes designed to assess nitric oxide (NO) in macro­
phages, enabling real-time monitoring of macrophage 
phenotypic changes within tumors. Arginine metabolism 
differs between macrophage phenotypes, with M1 mac­
rophages producing NO and M2 macrophages generat­
ing urea [144]. During tumor treatment, the phenotypic 
shift from M2 to M1 macrophages involves increased 
expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), result­
ing in the intracellular production of NO from arginine 
[145]. To exploit this mechanism, the authors created a 
NO-responsive nanoprobe based on ultrasmall super­
paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. This molecular 
imaging nanoprobe was specifically designed to quantify 
Page 14 of 25
Gangadaran et al. Biomarker Research           (2025) 13:20 
macrophage repolarization by targeting the redox-active 
NO as a chemical marker. Equipped with O-phenylene­
diamine groups, the nanoprobe reacted with intracellular 
NO during the M2-to-M1 transition, triggering electrical 
attraction and colloidal aggregation of the nanoparticles. 
These structural changes lead to significant alterations 
in T1 and T2 relaxation times in MRI, allowing precise 
quantification of macrophage polarization. In a 4T1 
breast cancer model, this MRI nanoprobe effectively 
visualized macrophage polarization and predicted treat­
ment outcomes in immunotherapy and radiotherapy 
settings [146]. Future research could explore the applica­
bility of this strategy across other tumor models, broad­
ening its clinical potential. Moreover, identifying key 
metabolic differences between TAM subtypes could fur­
ther enhance the design of MRI-based probes, enabling 
more precise targeting and monitoring of macrophage 
polarization within the tumor microenvironment.
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI)
Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is an advanced imag­
ing technology that directly detects magnetic nanopar­
ticles (MNPs), such as iron oxide, with high sensitivity 
and non-invasiveness. This modality uses superparamag­
netic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as tracers, which 
exhibit no remanent magnetization after the removal of 
the magnetic field, making them particularly suitable for 
imaging applications. The technique applies a spatially 
varying magnetic field to the imaging region, creating a 
field-free region (FFR) or field-free point (FFP). When 
MNPs are exposed to oscillating magnetic fields, they 
produce harmonics in their response signal. The scan­
ner detects only these nonlinear signals from the MNPs, 
effectively ignoring background signals from surround­
ing tissues or structures, resulting in high specificity 
[101–103].
While MRI remains the gold standard for high-res­
olution, whole-body imaging and superior soft-tissue 
contrast, the high sensitivity of MPI in detecting even 
minute concentrations of MNPs, coupled with its ability 
to avoid background noise, has made it an increasingly 
popular tool for analysing TAMs in the TME in preclini­
cal studies (Table  1). The technique was first employed 
by Yu et al. for in vivo cancer imaging using systemically 
administered tracers. They developed long-circulating, 
MPI-tailored SPIOs, which were intravenously injected 
into tumor-bearing rats. The tumors were distinctly high­
lighted, achieving a tumor-to-background ratio of up to 
50. Additionally, the nanoparticle dynamics within the 
tumor were well characterized, showing an initial wash-in 
at the tumor rim, peak uptake at 6 h, and eventual clear­
ance beyond 48 h. Although the authors did not inves­
tigate whether tumor-associated cells, such as TAMs, 
contributed to the observed signal, the study effectively 
demonstrated the quantitative capabilities of MPI using 
compartmental fitting in vivo [104]. In another study, 
Makela et al. compared the detection capabilities of MRI 
and MPI for iron-labelled macrophages associated with 
cancer. In their study, imaging was conducted on 4T1 
tumor-bearing mice 16–21 days post-cancer cell implan­
tation and 24 h after intravenous administration of either 
Ferucarbotran, a superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), 
or Ferumoxytol, an ultra-small SPIO. Living mice were 
imaged using a 3T clinical MRI system (General Electric, 
n = 6) and an MPI system (Magnetic Insight, n = 10). Fol­
lowing imaging, tumors and lungs were excised, further 
imaged using MPI, and analysed through histology. The 
study concluded that MPI provides quantitative in vivo 
data on iron labelling of macrophages, a level of informa­
tion unattainable with MRI. Additionally, Ferumoxytol 
nanoparticles outperformed Ferucarbotran in enabling 
the MPI-based detection of macrophages labelled in 
vivo [105]. Interestingly, in recent years there has also 
been advancements in generating more optimized SPIO 
and USPIO for MRI/MPI, which perform better than 
ferumoxytol, like ferucarbotran as depicted by the study 
mentioned above [147]. These include gadolinium, iron 
and manganese-based agents (Table 1) [148], which over­
come the shortcomings of ferumoxytol.
Although limited studies have specifically investigated 
TAM phenotypes and behaviour within tumors using 
MPI, the technique holds significant future potential. For 
example, due to its quantitative capabilities, MPI could 
be utilized for macrophage-mediated tumor therapy and 
detection. In a notable study, Zu et al. designed a super­
paramagnetic Fe3O4 nanocluster@poly(lactide-co-gly­
colide acid) core–shell nanocomposite loaded with the 
chemotherapy drug doxorubicin. This innovative system 
served as both a drug delivery platform and an MPI quan­
tification tracer. The nanocomposite’s degradable nature 
in a mildly acidic microenvironment (pH = 6.5) facilitated 
sustained doxorubicin release and gradual decomposition 
of the Fe3O4 nanocluster, leading to measurable changes 
in the MPI signal. The study demonstrated a strong linear 
correlation (R² = 0.99) between MPI signal changes and 
the doxorubicin release rate over time. Furthermore, in a 
murine breast cancer model, they monitored drug release 
and its therapeutic effect on tumor cells through MPI, 
highlighting the feasibility of in vivo drug release tracking 
in a cancer therapy context [149]. Future research could 
focus on leveraging such nanocomposite systems to 
deliver MPI tracers alongside therapeutic agents within 
macrophages. This approach could not only enhance 
tumor cell killing through combined drug action and 
macrophage-intrinsic tumor-clearing mechanisms but 
also enable real-time tracking of macrophage dynam­
ics and efficacy in tumor clearance. Such advancements 
Page 15 of 25
Gangadaran et al. Biomarker Research           (2025) 13:20 
could pave the way for improved preclinical and clinical 
applications of MPI in cancer therapy.
Nuclear imaging: positron emission tomography (PET) and 
single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
PET scanning involves measuring the concentration 
of positron-labeled molecular probes, like ligands or 
substrates, attached to specific target proteins or con­
fined within cells of interest. In contrast, SPECT imag­
ing agents are labeled with γ-emitting radionuclides 
(e.g., technetium-99m (99mTc), iodine-123 (123I), and 
iodine-131 (131I)), whereas PET tracers utilize positron-
emitting radionuclides (e.g., fluorine-18 (18F), iodine-124 
(124I), and copper-64 (64Cu)) [5]. Unlike MRI and opti­
cal imaging methods described above, PET and SPECT 
require only small quantities of imaging agents (rang­
ing from nanograms to milligrams) [133]. Consequently, 
radionuclide-based imaging agents employed in PET or 
SPECT studies are generally safe, and involve a small 
amount of radiation, which unlikely to induce pharmaco­
logical effects; The radiation dose during scanning must 
be carefully managed to avoid disrupting the biological 
system and causing toxicity, PET and SPECT studies use 
very small amounts of tracers, which generally not pro­
duce pharmacological effects [133, 150, 151].
Like MRI, nuclear imaging methods offer the advan­
tage of deep tissue penetration, making them suitable for 
imaging macrophages or TAMs in deep-seated tumors 
[152]. Since PET/SPECT primarily provides 3D func­
tional information about the tissue of interest with rela­
tively poor resolution, therefore, combining it with MRI 
or CT, which offers high-resolution structural details, 
creates a powerful hybrid imaging modality. This inte­
gration enables simultaneous acquisition of functional/
metabolic 
and 
anatomical/structural 
information, 
enhancing diagnostic accuracy and utility [111] (Table 1). 
Nonetheless both, PET and SPECT alone or in combi­
nation with MRI is widely used to track TAMs in thera­
pies. For instance, Lee et al. investigated the delivery of 
photothermal therapy (PTT) using radioiodine-labeled 
gold nanoparticles (124I-Au@AuCBs) loaded onto macro­
phages (Raw 264.7). These 124I-Au@AuCB-labeled mac­
rophages were then intratumorally injected into murine 
colorectal carcinoma (CT26/FM) tumors, followed by 
PET/CT scans (Table 2), which revealed an even distri­
bution of the probe within the tumor lesions. Upon NIR 
laser irradiation (6.0 W cm− 2, 808 nm) to the tumor site, 
the authors reported potent antitumor effects. While the 
impact of transferred macrophages on the host immune 
system and long-term effects remain unaddressed, these 
findings underscored the potential of 124I-Au@AuCBs 
theranostic materials, highlighting the benefits of mac­
rophage-mediated drug deliveries coupled with PET/CT 
for various conditions, including cancer [153].
Apart from tracking therapeutic macrophages, nuclear 
imaging techniques are often used to track the behavior 
of TAMs within the TME. Pérez-Medina et al., two differ­
ent radiolabeled reconstituted high-density lipoprotein 
(rHDL) nanoparticles containing 89Zr (called 89Zr-PL-
HDL and 89Zr-AI-HDL), were intravenously injected into 
mice bearing the orthotropic breast (4T1) tumors. Quan­
titative PET imaging and histological analysis, which 
included ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 
(Iba-1) as a macrophage marker [154], demonstrated 
that 89Zr-PL-HDL displayed significant colocalization 
with macrophage-rich regions. However, the study also 
noted an uptake by a cell subtype referred to as mono­
cyte-derived cells. Consequently, while the technique did 
not sufficiently separate different immune cell types that 
take up the probe in tumors nor differentiate between 
M1 or macrophage M2 subtypes, the use of the 89Zr-
rHDL imaging agents for quantitative macrophage PET 
imaging exhibited substantial potential in noninvasively 
monitoring the complex behaviors, functional states, and 
interactions of macrophages within the TME [155]. Cou­
pling macrophage-specific antibodies to PET/CT probes 
has gained importance due to the specificity it offers. In 
a previous study, single-domain antibody fragments of 
the cross-reactive antimacrophage mannose receptor 
(MMR, CD206), a C-type lectin receptor on M2 mac­
rophages that plays a critical role in pathogen recogni­
tion, antigen presentation, and immune regulation [156, 
157], were linked to the PET tracer 18F-fluorobenzoate 
(18F-FB). The 18F-FB-antiMMR was injected into mouse 
lung carcinoma (3LL-R) tumor-bearing mice (both wild 
type and MMR-deficient), followed by PET imaging 
at 3  h. (Table  2). Notably, there was significant tumor-
specific retention in the wild-type mice (3 times higher 
mean uptake) compared to the MMR-deficient mice. This 
confirmed the specificity of the 18F tracer specificity for 
MMR and TAMs, respectively, highlighting its potential 
for precise macrophage imaging in patients [158]. How­
ever, the use of short half-life radionuclides (e.g. 18F) in 
PET/CT makes such approaches unsuitable for longitudi­
nal studies (Table 1).
Another study by Kim et al. developed a poly-glucose 
nanoparticle labeled with 64Cu (referred to as Macrin) 
for tracking TAMs using a quantitative PET imaging 
approach. Macrin and its analogs were injected intrave­
nously into mice bearing murine colon adenocarcinoma 
(MC38) tumor, a TAM-rich model [12]. PET/CT imaging 
was acquired 24 h after injection (Table 2), revealing high 
Macrin accumulation in the cancer. Furthermore, Macrin 
imaging was utilized to monitor the response of macro­
phages to chemotherapy and γ-irradiation treatments. 
While the clinical relevance of Macrin requires validation 
and potential side effects need assessment in patients, it 
presents a promising selective and translational method 
Page 16 of 25
Gangadaran et al. Biomarker Research           (2025) 13:20 
for quantifying TAMs and guiding therapeutic decisions 
[159].
SPECT imaging is also utilized to track TAMs within 
the TME in combination with macrophage-specific anti­
bodies. For instance, Zhang et al. developed M2-tar­
geted probes for SPECT imaging using an anti-CD206 
monoclonal antibody to track TAMs within the TME. 
They evaluated the specificity and potential applications 
of these probes in murine breast (4T1) tumor mod­
els, including subcutaneous tumors and LN metastasis. 
Following cyclophosphamide treatment, the authors 
observed a significant increase in M2 macrophage infil­
tration in relapsing 4T1 tumors but not in non-relapsing 
ones. Using the synthesized SPECT probes, they sen­
sitively detected M2 macrophage infiltration in relaps­
ing tumors and LN metastasis. Importantly, early tumor 
relapse prediction through the molecular imaging of 
M2 macrophages enabled effective tumor eradication 
when combined with radiotherapy. Therefore, M2 mac­
rophage–targeted imaging facilitates noninvasive predic­
tion of post-chemotherapy tumor relapse and sensitive 
detection of metastatic LNs in vivo, offering insights 
into cancer progression, early resistance prediction, and 
implications for cancer therapeutics [112].
In another study, mannosylated liposomes (MAN-LIPs) 
were utilized, which specifically accumulated in TAMs in 
a mouse model of pulmonary adenocarcinoma. These 
liposomes contained 64Cu for PET imaging, followed by 
microscopy analysis. Interestingly, MAN-LIPs predomi­
nantly gathered in TAMs with minimal accumulation in 
distant lung areas at 6  h. after injection (Table  2). This 
study demonstrates that MAN-LIPs offer a promising 
approach for delivering imaging agents to lung TAMs 
and potentially for therapeutic agent delivery to the TME 
[160]. However, the clinical implications of this approach 
and the long-term effects of the probe on TAM pheno­
type and function require further investigation.
Tumor hypoxia and aerobic glycolysis are known resis­
tance factors in cancer treatment. Apart from explicitly 
targeting TAMs using MMR, this marker can also be uti­
lized to differentiate the targeting of TAM subsets within 
the TME. Interestingly, TAMs located in hypoxic regions 
and exhibiting elevated MMR expression play a substan­
tial role in shaping the TME due to their strong proangio­
genic characteristics. A study by Movahedi et al. utilized 
MMR-specific nanobodies (Nbs) labeled with 99mTc for 
in vivo TAM imaging. The 99mTc-labeled a-MMR Nb cl1 
was injected intravenously in lung carcinoma (TS/A and 
3LL-R) tumor-bearing mice, and SPECT imaging was 
performed 1 h after injection (Table 2). Both TS/A and 
3LL-R tumors exhibited substantial uptake of the 99mTc-
labeled a-MMR Nb cl1 in WT animals (2.02 ± 0.11), 
compared to the MMR-deficient mice (0.06 ± 0.01). His­
tology revealed that within tumors, the labeled Nbs were 
specifically labeled as MMR-positive TAMs (Ly6Cint 
MHCIIlo). Notably, the anti-MMR Nbs accumulated 
in hypoxic regions, precisely targeting proangiogenic 
MMR-positive TAMs. Taken together, anti-MMR nano­
bodies can be utilized to target selectively and image 
TAM subpopulations in vivo and study metabolic repro­
gramming in tumors [161] (Table 1).
As stated above, TAMs preferentially localize in 
hypoxic and metabolically distinct regions of the TME, 
further exacerbating these conditions. For instance, Jeong 
et al. reported a strong correlation between CD68+ TAM 
immunostaining and 
18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) 
uptake on PET imaging (FDG SUVmax; rho = 0.369; 
P < 0.001 and 40% TLG uptake; rho = 0.355; P < 0.001) 
in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The authors 
suggested that TAMs increase tumor cell glycolysis by 
secreting TNFα and elevate tumor hypoxia by enhanc­
ing AMP-activated protein kinase and PPARγ coactivator 
1-α. Furthermore, depletion of TAMs not only eliminated 
tumor-associated hypoxia but also increased PD-L1 
expression on cancer cells and T-cell infiltration, mak­
ing PD-L1 antibodies more effective. Therefore, TAMs 
can significantly impact tumor metabolism and compli­
cate responses to anticancer therapies, including immu­
notherapy [162]. Although the depletion of TAMs in 
patients is challenging, the study indicates the potential 
of developing combination therapies for cancer patients.

In vivo molecular imaging of macrophage-derived 
extracellular vesicles in targeting tumors: insights 
from fluorescence imaging modality
Understanding the fate of macrophage-derived EVs 
within living organisms, particularly their propensity to 
accumulate at tumor sites, is crucial for optimizing EV 
derivation and administration protocols to improve their 
therapeutic efficacy. EVs, in general, face challenges such 
as rapid clearance by the body, which limits their ability 
to target tumors effectively [163–166]. Moreover, given 
these limitations, the clinical translation of macrophage-
EV-based therapies remains limited, with most studies 
still at the preclinical stage. Intriguingly, fluorescence 
imaging is commonly used to track macrophage-EVs in 
vitro and in vivo, while other modalities remain under­
explored. This reliance on fluorescence imaging under­
scores the need for further research into alternative 
imaging techniques that could enhance the tracking and 
efficacy of macrophage-EV-based therapies.
To address the issue of EV-tumor targeting, various 
strategies have been developed to monitor and enhance 
Page 17 of 25

macrophage-EV targeting for therapeutic purposes. A 
study by Baek et al. demonstrated that proinflammatory 
macrophage (M1)-derived nanovesicles (M1-NVs) can 
boost antitumor effects through a surface modification 
technique using polyethylene glycol (PEG). The authors 
labeled both the bare M1-NVs and PEG- M1-NVs with 
DiR dye and injected them intravenously into colon 
cancer-bearing mice. They generated M1 macrophages 
through LPS/IFNγ treatment of RAW 264.7 cells, a 
method that could modify macrophage behavior but was 
not addressed in the study. Nonetheless, in vivo fluores­
cence imaging showed that PEG- M1-NVs targeted the 
tumor within 3  h., while no signal was detected in the 
tumors of mice injected with bare M1-NVs, even after 
24  h. (Table  3). These results indicate that PEG signifi­
cantly enhances M1-NVs’ ability to target tumors in vivo, 
Fig. 3  Noninvasive in vivo imaging of macrophages and TAMs. TAM-directed imaging and therapy are interdependent and can improve clinical out­
comes. In vivo imaging such as optical in vivo imaging system (IVIS), PET/CT, and microscopic analysis can be helpful to monitor and track down the TAM 
population in tumors noninvasively. In addition, TAM-directed imaging can be designed to target macrophages with drugs, leading to the modulation of 
TAM, thereby resulting in combined diagnostic and therapeutic effects for better outcomes. Created with BioRender.com

potentially advancing EV-based therapeutics for various 
diseases, including cancer [167]. However, the generation 
of M1 cells in vitro and the costly nature of exosome iso­
lation limit the method’s translational potential.
Another study that utilized fluorescence imaging to 
track macrophage-EV-based therapy comes from Li et 
al., who developed a novel approach using macrophage-
derived exosomes coated with poly (lactic-co-glycolic 
acid) for targeted chemotherapy of triple-negative breast 
cancer (TNBC). TNBC, the most aggressive breast can­
cer subtype, lacks effective therapeutic targets, leaving 
chemotherapy and surgery as the primary options. Yet, 
chemotherapy faces limitations like poor targeting and 
high toxicity. In vivo, Cy5.5 labeled PL-D (DOX loaded 
PLGA nanoparticles), EP-D (macrophage exosome 
coated nanoparticle), and MEP-D (c-Met binding pep­
tides were decorated on the macrophage exosome) were 
administered via the tail vein to nude mice with MDA-
MB-231 tumors. After 4  h., MEP-D exhibited robust 
fluorescence at the tumor site, indicating its notable 
targeting efficacy. Notably, MEP-D showed consistently 
higher fluorescence intensity at the tumor site compared 
to PL-D or EP-D at various time points up to 24 h. These 
findings suggest that MEP-D demonstrates a strong abil­
ity to target tumors [168]. However, similar to the study 
by Baek et al., this approach requires further valida­
tion in pre-clinical settings to establish its translational 
potential. Apart from targeting tumors, macrophage-
derived EVs have also been utilized to deliver drugs to 
tumor sites for TNBC. For instance, Gong et al. devel­
oped a strategy to enhance exosome binding to integrin 
αvβ3 by creating A15-modified Exo (A15-Exo) for pre­
cise co-delivery of doxorubicin (Dox) and cholesterol-
modified miRNA 159 (Cho-miR159) to TNBC cells. 
Fluorescence imaging showed that 2 h. after IV adminis­
tration (Table 3) of free Cy5-Cho-miRNA, Exo-Cy5-Cho-
miRNA, or A15-Exo-Cy5-Cho-miRNA in nude mice 
with MDA-MB-231 tumors, there was a substantial accu­
mulation of Cy5 fluorescence in the tumor areas in the 
A15-Exo-Cy5-Cho-miRNA group, contrasting with liver 
or kidney accumulation in other groups. Further results 
demonstrated that A15-Exo-Cy5-Cho-miRNA efficiently 
suppressed tumor growth and enhanced the survival rate 
of mice with tumors [169].
A study by Li et al. coupled tumor targeting with ther­
apy by employing a straightforward method to encapsu­
late folate (FA)-modified EVs for targeting tumors. These 
EVs were loaded with the photosensitizer protoporphyrin 
IX (PpIX) and doxorubicin (Dox) for therapeutic out­
comes. Macrophages effectively convert 5-aminolevulinic 
acid (5-ALA) into protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) through the 
mitochondrial heme synthesis pathway. Therefore, mac­
rophages were incubated with Dox, 5-ALA, and DSPE-
PEG-FA in the culture medium. The macrophages then 
secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) with surface modi­
fications targeting tumors through folate (FA) while also 
encapsulating biosynthesized PpIX and Dox, referred to 
as PpIX-DOX@FA-EVs. Free PpIX, PpIX-DOX@EVs, and 
PpIX-DOX@FA-EVs were intravenously injected into 
mice bearing 4T1 tumors (Table 3). Fluorescence imag­
ing revealed that PpIX-DOX@FA-EVs swiftly gathered at 
the tumor location within 4 h. post-injection, with nota­
bly lower concentrations observed in healthy organs such 
as the heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys. This demonstrates 
the efficient delivery of therapeutic molecules to tumor 
sites, achieving effective anti-cancer treatment [170].
Table  3 offers an overview of research efforts dedi­
cated to visualizing and monitoring macrophage-derived 
EVs migration and infiltration in the context of tumors. 
Notable EV studies in clinical trials highlight the diverse 
therapeutic potential of EVs across various applications, 
including cancer therapy, neuroprotection, ischemic 
recovery, and regenerative (Table 4). These studies dem­
onstrate the translational capabilities of EVs, showcasing 
their roles in targeted immunotherapy, drug delivery and 
tissue repair. By leveraging these insights, the transla­
tional pathway for macrophage-derived EVs can be fur­
ther advanced, paving the way for their development into

derived EV visualization is imperative to unlock their full 
potential in both basic science and clinical applications.
Clinical implication
In applying and evaluating macrophage efficacy in 
humans, tracing and localizing the macrophages are 
essential. Several studies have assessed the macrophages 
in humans [139, 162], highlighting their significance and 
potential therapeutic interventions. These studies have 
utilized advanced imaging techniques for diagnosis and 
monitoring of macrophage distribution, behavior, and 
response to treatments, providing valuable insights into 
their roles and potential as therapeutic targets in clinical 
settings (Table 5). For instance, ferumoxytol, developed 
initially as an iron supplement, can also be used as a T2 
MRI contrast agent. Given macrophages can engulf that 
ferumoxytol, it effectively demonstrates the quantity of 
TAMs [140, 180]. This dual functionality makes feru­
moxytol a valuable tool for both therapeutic and diag­
nostic purposes, providing insights into macrophage 
presence and activity in TME. Indeed, Aghighi et al. 
conducted a ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI post-contrast 
versus pre-contrast (P = 0.036) in 25 patients, includ­
ing 12 with lymphoma and 13 with bone sarcoma. They 
demonstrated T2* signal enhancement on MR images

correlated significantly with the density of CD68+ and 
CD163+ TAMs (P < 0.05) [139]. However, whether this 
approach can be extended to studying other tumor types 
remains controversial. Intriguingly, ferumoxytol has been 
associated with MRI artifacts in the brain [181, 182], 
which limits its utility in understanding TAMs in brain 
tumors. Additionally, 18F-FDG PET/CT is the most pop­
ular radiotracer for representing cellular glycolysis. Jeong 
et al. demonstrated a strong correlation between CD68+ 
TAM immunostaining and 18F-FDG PET/CT uptake 
in 98 matched tumors of patients with NSCLC [162]. 
Indeed, while both 18F-FDG PET/CT tracers correlated 
well with TAM density, they are not specific for TAMs 
and have not been tested clinically. As of now, FDA-
approved specific agents for in vivo macrophage imag­
ing in humans are still limited. Hence, there is a pressing 
need for the development of more specific agents tailored 
to target TAMs selectively.
Moreover, the limited tissue penetration of optical 
imaging tracers may pose challenges for clinical transla­
tion. However, recent advances have shown the utility of 
fluorescent imaging for evaluating surgical margins in the 
surgical field [183, 184]. Given that TAMs are one of the 
constituents of cancer lesions, achieving precise resec­
tion of TAMs could be a method for complete tumor 
resection [34]. Fluorescent imaging systems thus offer 
several advantages in the surgical setting and improve 
surgical outcomes. Table 5 compiles select clinical trials 
actively employing fluorescent imaging strategy for track­
ing TAMs and aiding in cancer diagnosis.
Future perspectives
The future of advances in noninvasive, in vivo macro­
phage imaging holds tremendous potential in further 
illuminating TME and advancing cellular-based drug-
delivery systems. As technology continues to evolve, sev­
eral exciting perspectives emerge that could transform 
cancer research and therapy. Combining different imag­
ing modalities, such as MRI, PET, CT, and optical imag­
ing [112, 160–162], could provide a more comprehensive 
and nuanced view of macrophage behavior and its inter­
actions within tumors. This multimodal approach would 
leverage the strengths of each technique, enhancing 
spatial and temporal resolutions while mitigating their 
limitations [192, 193]. The development of more sophis­
ticated nanoparticle-based contrast agents and molecular 
probes has the potential to enable ultra-high-resolution 
imaging at the molecular level. These agents could be 
engineered to target specific macrophage subsets or 
markers, allowing for deeper insights into their roles in 
various disease states. Such advancements hold promise 
for unraveling the complexities of the TME and identify­
ing targets for cancer treatment.
The integration of machine learning and artificial intel­
ligence (AI) algorithms could revolutionize macrophage 
image analysis. These tools could facilitate the identifica­
tion of subtle changes in macrophage behavior, aiding in 
the early detection of disease progression and providing 
insights into treatment responses [194, 195]. Advance­
ments in real-time imaging technologies could offer 
a dynamic, moment-to-moment view of macrophage 
behavior within tumors. These developments could lead 
to a more precise understanding of their responses to 
therapies, allowing for rapid adjustments in treatment 
strategies.
As immunotherapies continue to transform cancer 
treatment, integrating macrophage imaging with immu­
notherapeutic strategies could unlock new avenues for 
synergistic therapies. Monitoring macrophage responses 
could guide the timing and combination of treatments, 
maximizing their impact on tumor clearance [12, 112, 
140, 155, 158, 160]. The ability to track macrophage 
behavior in real-time could promote personalized treat­
ment regimens. Multimodal imaging enables a cus­
tomized approach to assessing TAMs. By tailoring the 
combination of imaging techniques to a patient’s specific 
tumor characteristics, clinicians can decide and imple­
ment optimal treatment strategies, improving patient 
outcomes while minimizing adverse effects. This inte­
grated approach has the potential to significantly enhance 
the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies and improve the 
precision of treatment protocols.
The prospects for advances in noninvasive, in vivo 
macrophage imaging are up and coming. By harnessing 
the power of evolving imaging technologies, artificial 
intelligence, and innovative drug-delivery strategies, our 
understanding of TME may be deepened, revolutionizing 
cancer treatment. As these visions become realities, they 
hold the potential to improve precision medicine sig­
nificantly, enabling therapies to be tailored to the unique 
characteristics of each patient’s disease.
Conclusion
The remarkable advancements in noninvasive, in vivo 
macrophage imaging have led to a profound understand­
ing of the TME and catalyzed significant developments 
in cellular-based drug-delivery systems. By visualizing 
and monitoring macrophage dynamics within these com­
plex ecosystems, crucial insights into the intricate inter­
play between immune cells and cancer cells have been 
uncovered. This newfound knowledge has not only deep­
ened our comprehension of tumor progression, immune 
response, and therapy resistance but has also opened 
avenues for innovative therapeutic strategies. Moreover, 
through the development of targeted contrast agents and 
molecular probes, the specificity and sensitivity of mac­
rophage imaging have enhanced, improving our ability to

Gangadaran et al. Biomarker Research           (2025) 13:20 
decipher their multifaceted roles within the TME. Fur­
thermore, the synergy between noninvasive imaging and 
cellular-based drug-delivery systems have advanced per­
sonalized medicine. By harnessing the unique properties 
of macrophages as carriers, therapeutic payloads can be 
precisely delivered to tumor sites, minimizing off-target 
effects while maximizing therapeutic outcomes. The ver­
satility of macrophages in modulating their cargo and 
response to various stimuli has facilitated the design of 
multifunctional drug-delivery platforms that can adapt to 
the dynamic TME. Essentially, the convergence of non­
invasive in vivo macrophage imaging and cellular-based 
drug delivery systems holds great promise in enhancing 
cancer diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment with high 
precision and efficacy. By elucidating the intricate inter­
actions within the TME and leveraging the potential of 
macrophages as therapeutic carriers, we stand at the 
threshold of a transformative era in cancer research and 
treatment.
