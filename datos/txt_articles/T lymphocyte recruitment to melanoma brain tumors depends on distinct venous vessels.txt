In brief
How T cells are recruited to brain tumors
from the blood remains unclear. Messmer
et al. identify peritumoral venous vessels
(PVVs) as key structures for T cell
recruitment to melanoma brain tumors.
PVVs are the sites of T cell extravasation
and facilitated rapid T cell migration
under immune checkpoint inhibition.
T cell recruitment and antitumor immunity
were dependent on ICAM-1.

SUMMARY
To improve immunotherapy for brain tumors, it is important to determine the principal intracranial site of T cell
recruitment from the bloodstream and their intracranial route to brain tumors. Using intravital microscopy in
mouse models of intracranial melanoma, we discovered that circulating T cells preferably adhered and ex-
travasated at a distinct type of venous blood vessel in the tumor vicinity, peritumoral venous vessels
(PVVs). Other vascular structures were excluded as alternative T cell routes to intracranial melanomas.
Anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors increased intracranial T cell motility, facilitating migration
from PVVs to the tumor and subsequently inhibiting intracranial tumor growth. The endothelial adhesion
molecule ICAM-1 was particularly expressed on PVVs, and, in samples of human brain metastases,
ICAM-1 positivity of PVV-like vessels correlated with intratumoral T cell inﬁltration. These ﬁndings uncover
a distinct mechanism by which the immune system can access and control brain tumors and potentially in-
ﬂuence other brain pathologies.
INTRODUCTION
Brain metastasis is a frequent complication of melanoma and is
associated with a poor prognosis for patients, with a median sur-
vival of 4–6 months.1,2 The brain has long been considered an
immune-privileged organ.3 However, recently a lymphatic sys-
tem of the meninges composed of lymphatic vessels located in
close proximity along the superior sagittal sinus, which allows
immune surveillance of brain-derived antigens, was discovered
both in mice4,5 and in humans.6,7 Clinical trials of melanoma
brain metastases patients showed that treatment with immune
checkpoint inhibition (ICI) leads to intracranial responses in up
to 50%–65% of patients.8,9 Although these preclinical and clin-
ical observations highlight the potential of immunotherapeutic
approaches for the treatment of intracranial melanoma, the
exact anatomical and molecular mechanisms of immune cell
recruitment to intracranial tumor lesions are currently still not
identiﬁed. To improve immunotherapy for brain tumors, it is
important to address critical unresolved questions in brain tumor
immunology: what is the principal intracranial site of T cell

recruitment from the blood stream and what ‘‘route’’ do T cells
use to access brain tumors? Can multiparameter imaging be
used to better understand how anti-programmed cell death pro-
tein 1 (PD-1)/cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) immune
checkpoint inhibitors enhance immunological control of brain tu-
mors, as recently demonstrated in another approach for predic-
tion of overall efﬁcacy of PD-1 blockade?10
To unravel these basic cellular mechanisms, we established
mouse models of intracranial melanoma using intravital two-
photon microscopy (IVM). By visualizing spatiotemporal dy-
namics of T cell recruitment to brain tumors, we uncovered sites
of intraluminal T cell attachment and extravasation in distinct,
intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)-expressing peritu-
moral venous vessels (PVVs), and the PVV perivascular space
as a site of increased T cell abundance and T cell motility,
contributing to efﬁcient tumor homing and intracranial tumor
growth suppression.
RESULTS
Model allows real-time tracking of the interplay of brain
tumor growth and inﬁltrating T cells
To study T cell dynamics and brain tumor growth in intracranial
melanoma in vivo, we established an adoptive T cell transfer
(ACT) model with two glycoprotein100 (gp100)-antigen-express-
ing syngeneic melanoma cell lines (Figure S1A). To mimic the sit-
uation in patients, a subcutaneous (s.c.) extracranial tumor was
implanted followed by an intracranial tumor injection (TI) into
the mouse brain cortex (Figure 1A), which enables more efﬁcient
T cell homing to brain tumors.11,12 Adoptively transferred ﬂuores-
cent premelanosome protein (pmel)-1 CD8+ T cells (Figures S1B
and S1C), speciﬁcally targeting gp100, were visualized by per-
forming IVM in mice treated with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 ICI
or isotype (Iso) control antibodies (Figure 1A). Brain tumor growth
(Figure 1B) and T cell inﬁltration in relation to the brain and tumor
microenvironment (Figures 1C and S1D) could be readily de-
tected at subcellular resolution and followed over time. This
methodology allowed dynamic insights into the intracranial anti-
tumor effects of ICI treatment (Figures 1B, 1D, and S1E). ICI
increased the number of brain-homing, antigen-speciﬁc, pmel-
1-transferred T cells as early as 1 day after ACT, which became
pronounced
in
the
subsequent
3
days
in
both
models
(Figures 1E and S1F). The growth of extracranial tumors was
also reduced (Figures S1G and S1H). In contrast, adoptive trans-
fer of tumor-antigen-unspeciﬁc OT-I T cells did not lead to a sig-
niﬁcant effect of ICI treatment compared with Iso control on brain
tumor growth (Figure 1F) and resulted in a much lower OT-I T cell
inﬁltration in the brain tumor microenvironment (Figure 1G).
Microregional presence of tumor-speciﬁc pmel-1 T cells was
associated with a reduction in tumor growth or even tumor
regression over time (Figures 1H–1J), supporting the concept
that the transferred pmel-1 T cells exert antitumor effects in
the brain and indicating a selective entry of antigen-speciﬁc
T cells into the brain parenchyma as key mechanism of antitumor
immunity.
To study brain-homing and dynamic T cell-tumor-cell interac-
tions of endogenous T cells, we next generated a transgenic
T cell reporter mouse line. Lymphocyte protein tyrosine kinase
(LCK)-Cre 3 Lox-Stop-Lox (LSL)-tdTomato mice express ﬂoxed
tdTomato and Cre recombinase under a lymphocyte LCK pro-
motor (Figure 1K), resulting in tdTomato expression in 92.4%–
99.1% of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells isolated from lymph nodes
and spleen (Figures S2A–S2C) but only in 0.5%–2.8% of non-T
cell leukocytes (Figure S2D). Spectral ﬂow cytometry of the im-
mune composition of the brain tumors revealed similar speci-
ﬁcity of tdTomato expression within the brain tumor microenvi-
ronment,
with
the
vast
majority
of
tdTomato+
CD45+
leukocytes being T cells, while only 2.83%–4.27% were NK1.1
positive and thus belonged to natural killer (NK) or NK T cells
(NKT); contributions of other immune cell types, such as granu-
locytes, macrophages, B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), or micro-
glia, remained negligible (Figures S2E and S2F).
Repetitive imaging of the whole tumor, peritumoral-, and non-
affected brain areas enabled the tracking of T cell inﬁltration and
dynamics at high resolution over 2 weeks in vivo (Figures 1K, 1L,
S3A, and S3B). The tumor growth of both extracranial (Fig-
ure S3C) and intracranial (Figure S3D) melanomas in these
LCK-Cre 3 LSL-tdTomato mice was inhibited under ICI treat-
ment as compared with Iso control treatment, demonstrating
that ICI treatment effectively inhibited intracranial tumor growth
even without additional ACT administration. In summary, intra-
vital imaging of these mouse models allowed dynamic insights
into T cell-tumor interactions of both adoptively transferred
and endogenous T cells and demonstrated the antitumor effects
of ICI treatment in the murine brain.
T cells accumulate in the perivascular space of
distinct PVVs
Four-dimensional imaging of T cell recruitment in both models
revealed a particularly high density of T cells at a distinct anatom-
ical site that was identiﬁed as large PVVs (Figures 2A and 2B),
with a mean diameter of 78.3 ± 12.48 mm and blood ﬂow veloc-
ities of 13.8 ± 1.3 mm/s (Figures S3E–S3G), compatible with their
venous nature,13 which drained into larger venous vessels and
ﬁnally into the sagittal venous sinus. PVVs were detectable as
early as 1 day following tumor implantation (Figure 2B), indi-
cating that these are pre-existing blood vessels of the brain.
Far less T cells were observed in brains of non-tumor-bearing
mice receiving no therapy (Figures S3H–S3L). In healthy brains,
accumulation of endogenous T cells around venous vessels
anatomically similar to PVVs could also be observed (Figures
S3H and S3I), suggesting that T cells already accumulate around

these vessels in absence of a brain tumor and increasingly so
when a tumor is present. In accordance with previous ﬁndings,14
we observed an increased T cell density in the brains of non-tu-
mor-bearing mice around the sagittal venous sinus and at the
brain surface, while only very few T cells were found in the
cortical capillary bed (Figures S3H–S3L). Cortical sham injection
of PBS did not increase T cell inﬁltration to the brain signiﬁcantly
compared with the already very low baseline T cell inﬁltration
before injection (Figures S4A–S4C), indicating that local inﬂam-
mation induced by the procedure of the injection alone, or the
prior surgical procedure, was minimal and did not relevantly
affect T cell inﬁltration to the brain.
To elucidate local T cell dynamics and the exact route of T cells
to intracranial tumors, we determined the number of pmel-1
T cells in different peritumoral and intratumoral regions at different
time points following ACT under ICI treatment and Iso control (Fig-
ure 2C). Starting 2 days post ACT, T cell density at PVVs was
signiﬁcantly increased compared with the interspace region be-
tween PVV and tumor, intratumoral, peritumoral capillary bed,
the sagittal venous sinus, and the peritumoral brain surface under

ICI treatment. With time, the T cell density at PVVs increased even
more, the interregional spatiotemporal dynamics suggesting a
PVV-induced T cell recruitment to the tumor region (Figure 2C).
This was not seen in Iso-treated control mice (Figure 2C). Semi-
automated analysis of inﬁltration dynamics of the more frequently
detectable endogenous T cells in the LCK-Cre 3 LSL-tdTomato
model conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant increase in T cell inﬁltration at
PVVs in comparison with the capillary bed as early as days 3, 5,
and 7 (Figure 2D, before treatment). Under ICI treatment, T cells
in the vicinity of PVVs further increased and remained continu-
ously higher than those in other regions over time (Figure 2D, up-
per right), whereas under Iso control treatment, T cell inﬁltration at
PVVs decreased over time and was not signiﬁcantly increased
anymore at later time points (Figure 2D, lower right). In summary,
early T cell accumulation at PVVs suggests a distinct role of these
venous vessels for T cell recruitment to melanoma brain tumors,
particularly under ICI treatment.
ICI treatment increases distinct parameters of T cell
motility
An important aspect of lymphocyte homing and effector func-
tionality is motility, with stationary or motile phenotypes that
are linked to different functions,15 which has not been studied
in the context of brain tumors yet. In general, T cell motility pat-
terns have rarely been studied in the context of other can-
cers.16–18 ICI treatment moderately increased the overall fraction
of motile transferred antigen-speciﬁc pmel-1 T cells in vivo, in
both models of intracranial melanoma (Figures 3A–3D).
Limiting the analysis to intratumoral T cells, those displayed a
higher fraction of stationary T cells on day 9 compared with day
12 (Figures 3E and 3F), indicating intratumoral antigen recogni-
tion on target cells early after ACT.16,17 By analyzing the overall
dynamics of only those motile T cells that are en route to the tu-
mor, we found that the T cell mean velocity and mean displace-
ment were signiﬁcantly higher in ICI vs. control groups for both
melanoma models (Figures 3G–3J). T cell track straightness,
an indicator for directed T cell movement, was signiﬁcantly
increased under ICI treatment at distinct time points in both tu-
mor models (Figures 3K and 3L). Together, this suggests an
increased potential for T cells to reach their target under ICI treat-
ment, either by direct effects on T cells or indirect effects on the
microenvironment.
T cells extravasate from PVVs and migrate particularly
quickly in their perivascular space
Intravascular T cell rolling or crawling, necessary for T cell extrav-
asation to the brain,19,20 almost exclusively occurred at PVVs
(Figures 4A and 4B), whereas at peritumoral capillaries, sites of
perivascular tumor growth or intratumoral vessels (Figures 4B
and 4C), fast-moving intraluminalT cellscould mostlybeobserved
without showing signs of stable attachment to the vascular wall.
Bona ﬁde T cell extravasation events were exclusively observed
at PVVs, most prominently 1 day post ACT (Figures 4A and 4B;
Videos S1, S2, S3, and S4). By comparing T cell motility of
pmel-1 T cells at different brain and tumor regions (Figures 4D–
4G), a spatial effect on T cell motility could be detected. T cells
at PVVs and at PVV-associated peritumoral regions displayed
the highest motility, which decreased with increasing proximity
to the tumor, such as at the tumor edge, and exhibited lowest
values intratumorally (Figures 4E–4G; Video S5). T cells at the tu-
mor edge had a signiﬁcantly higher track straightness under ICI
compared with the Iso control (Figure 4G), suggesting that ICI fa-
cilitates T cell homing to tumor target cells.
Taken together, our data collectively indicate that PVVs pro-
vide structures that allow T cell migration at a fast pace once ex-
travasated from the blood vessels. All in all, PVVs provide the ba-
sis for ICI-mediated efﬁcient recruitment of high numbers of
T cells to brain tumors and their subsequent antitumor effects.
PVVs with high T cell density are characterized by high
vascular ICAM-1 expression
Next, we sought to investigate the molecular mechanism of T cell
extravasation at PVVs, considering potential known molecules of
lymphocyte-vascular interactions.21,22 ICAM-1 expression was
evident for endothelial and adjacent abluminal cells in PVVs of
cortically growing melanoma tumors (Figure S5A) but not clearly
associated with any other blood vessel type or region in the brain
or brain tumor (Figures S5A and S5B). Further analysis revealed
that ICAM-1 expression colocalized partially with CD13 pericyte
staining at PVVs of cortical tumors (Figures S6A–S6C). When a
melanoma tumor grew in the striatum after local injection there,
T cells inﬁltrated the tumor effectively (Figures S6D and S6E),
similar to the situation found in cortical tumors. Again, T cells
clustered particularly on large ICAM-1-positive vessels in the
peritumoral region of the striatal tumors (Figures S6F–S6H).
This indicated that (1) PVV structures are not limited to the cortex
and its pre-existent large venous vessels and (2) ICAM-1 might
be relevant for their function.
To further assess the immune cell composition of those tumors
and tomolecularlycharacterizevascularendothelialcellsandperi-
cytes in respect of their expression of the adhesion molecules
ICAM-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and to
assess the expression of PD-1 and the ICAM-1 ligand lymphocyte

TyrKO melanoma, measured by IVM real-time time series analysis and T cell tracking. Angiogram was obtained through intravenous TRITC-dextran
(shown in blue).

spectral ﬂow cytometry of intracranial melanomas in LCK-Cre 3
LSL-tdTomato mice on day 10 post cortical TI (Figures 5 and
S6I). ICAM-1, but not VCAM-1, was highly expressed in endothe-
lial cells (Figure 5A) and ICAM-1 also, relevantly, from pericytes
(Figure 5B) in the brain tumor hemisphere. ICI treatment did not
signiﬁcantly affect ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 expression on endothelial
cells (Figure 5A), while it increased ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expres-
sion on pericytes (Figure 5B). Nevertheless, on endothelial cells,
ICAM-1 expression (but not VCAM-1 expression) was moderately
increased in the tumor and its microenvironment as compared
with the contralateral non-tumor hemisphere (Figures 5C and
5D). On pericytes, ICAM-1 expression was even more robustly
increased in the tumor hemisphere as compared with the non-tu-
mor hemisphere (Figures 5E and 5F), and the low pericytic
VCAM-1 expression also somewhat increased after ICI treatment
inthe tumor hemisphere (Figure 5F). Analysis ofsurface markers of
other major immune cell subpopulations revealed that the tumor-
bearing hemisphere was mainly inﬁltrated by microglia, T cells,
and macrophages,while other immune cell types such as granulo-
cytes,Bcells,DCs,and NKcellscould onlybedetectedatverylow
frequencies (Figures 5G and 5H). ICI treatment signiﬁcantly
increased the percentage of LFA-1, PD-1 double-positive CD4+
T cells (Figure 5I), with a similar trend in CD8+ T cells (Figure 5J).
Together, these data support a mechanism where regionally
increasedICAM-1expressionintwomaincelltypesofthevascular
wall and, potentially, other cell types that were not investigated
here, attracts a higher numbers of activated T cells that express
the ICAM-1 ligand LFA-1, resulting in increased T cell entry into
the brain and efﬁcient recruitment to intracranial melanoma
tumors, particularly under ICI treatment.
Finally, to provide further evidence for the relationship of
ICAM-1 expression of PVVs and T cell recruitment at this very
site, we performed longitudinal IVM of intraluminal ICAM-1
expression by in vivo immunostaining through intravenous injec-
tion of a ﬂuorescent anti-ICAM-1 antibody (Figures 6A–6D).
These experiments conﬁrmed that high ICAM-1 signals were
detectable at the endothelial lining of PVVs (Figure 6E), specif-
ically at those PVVs where also a high abundance and dynamics
of perivascular T cells could be observed, while PVV regions with
less T cell accumulation exhibited less ICAM-1 staining (Figures
6A–6F; Video S6). No such relation was detectable at brain sur-
face capillaries and no correlation with vascular diameter was
observed (Figures 6G–6I), and an intravenous (i.v.) injection of
a ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-coupled Iso control antibody
did not result in signal accumulation above background at PVVs
and other vessel types (Figures S7A–S7C). All in all, vascular
ICAM-1 expression at PVVs was associated with efﬁcient T cell
recruitment to intracranial melanoma tumors, particularly under
ICI treatment.
ICAM-1 is required for efﬁcient T cell recruitment to
PVVs and antitumor immunity
To validate the functional relevance of ICAM-1 for ICI-mediated
T cell recruitment to the brain, ICAM-1 was functionally blocked
in vivo by i.v. injection of a neutralizing anti-ICAM-1 antibody or
Iso control into intracranial and extracranial HCmel12 TyrKO-
melanoma-bearing mice, and brain tumor growth and T cell inﬁl-
tration were analyzed by IVM. ICAM-1 blocking had no relevant
effect on extracranial-ﬂank tumor growth (Figure 6J). In contrast,
ICI-treatment-induced complete regression of brain tumor
growth was substantially attenuated by ICAM-1 blockade (Fig-
ure 6K). Brain inﬁltration of T cells closely localized at PVVs at
day 5, an early time point important for the recruitment of acti-
vated T cells, was signiﬁcantly reduced under anti-ICAM-1
blockade (Figure 6L). In summary, while additional effects of
ICAM-1 blockade on tumor growth in the brain might also
contribute, these ﬁndings suggest that speciﬁc molecular fea-
tures of PVVs, particularly high ICAM-1 expression that allows
vascular adhesion and extravasation of circulating T cells, are
responsible for efﬁcient T cell recruitment to brain tumors as a
prerequisite for their antitumor activity.
ICAM-1 expression on PVVs correlates with T cell
inﬁltration in human brain metastases
Finally, to elucidate the expression patterns of ICAM-1 in
patients with brain metastases, we ﬁrst analyzed single-cell
RNA sequencing datasets published by Gonzalez et al.23 This
study characterized the tumor microenvironment of brain metas-
tases in patients, providing well-deﬁned transcriptional proﬁles
of three distinct endothelial cell populations with arterial mixed/
capillary (EC-1), venous (EC-2), or arterial (EC-3) phenotype in
the brain.23 Further in silico analyses of these datasets revealed
expression of ICAM-1 on endothelial cells (EC-1–3) in brain tu-
mors of all entities, with particularly high ICAM-1 expression in
the venous EC-2 cell population of breast and lung cancer brain
metastasis (Figure 7A). In melanoma samples, highest expres-
sions could be observed in both venous and arterial ECs, while
all other cell populations exhibited only low ICAM-1 expression
(Figures 7A and 7B). ICAM-1 expression of the venous EC-2
cell population was, however, heterogeneous in all entities (Fig-
ure 7B), which would be consistent with a situation where only a
fraction of venous ECs, like those found in PVVs, relevantly
express ICAM-1.
Next, we set out to investigate whether these higher ICAM-1
expression levels could indeed come from PVV structures,
consistently found in the mouse models investigated, in the hu-
man disease. Multiparametric immunoﬂuorescence staining was
performed on tissues of ten patients with melanoma brain me-
tastases where both solid tumor tissue and adjacent brain tissue
region was not included in the analysis. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test, dots represent individual mice, for numbers of observed mice and vessels

tients,
we
were

ICAM-1
expression
on
peritumoral blood vessels (Figures 7C and 7D), in accordance
with our ﬁndings from the preclinical models. The majority of
large
venous
vessels,
but
only
a
small

of
peritumoral capillaries, stained positive for ICAM-1 (Figure 7D).
The extent of intratumoral T cell inﬁltration correlated with
ICAM-1 positivity of the PVV-like large venous vessels in the
peritumoral region, reaching statistical signiﬁcance only for this
vessel type (Figures 7E and 7F). In accordance with our
ﬁndings from the mouse models of melanoma brain tumors,
PVV-like vessels could also be identiﬁed in samples of human
brain metastases and ICAM-1 positivity of these vessels was
also associated with T cell recruitment to the brain tumors.
DISCUSSION
In this study we dynamically investigated the interplay of T cell
inﬁltration and melanoma brain tumor growth in real time over
prolonged periods of time using two mouse models that we
generated. This revealed a speciﬁc T cell brain entry and tumor
homing mechanism via distinct anatomical structures, PVVs.
Mechanistically, the leukocyte adhesion molecule ICAM-1, high-
ly expressed at the endothelial lining of T cell-rich PVVs and
increased also in brain pericytes and potentially other cells in
the tumor microenvironment after checkpoint blockade, drives
PVV-related T cell homing to brain tumors, facilitating their full
antitumor activity. Similar PVV-like structures could also be
found at the interface between the brain metastasis and brain
in cancer patients.
The mechanisms of T cell surveillance of the healthy brain14
differ from T cell recruitment to brain tumors: in the brain tumor
setting, we neither observed T cell recruitment from the sagittal
sinus area (the place of lymphatic structures in the brain4,5) nor
from leaky, strongly pathologic tumor microvessels24,25 but
exclusively at pre-existing large venous vessels that we have
termed PVVs in this tumor context. In accordance with our study,
the general importance of blood vessels for immunotherapy of
brain tumors has recently been demonstrated by a preclinical
study of glioblastoma26: Ma et al. have shown that vascular
normalization by targeting p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4), and
thereby increasing the vascular expression of adhesion mole-
cules, including ICAM-1, in a preclinical model of glioblastoma,
can improve chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy.
The discovery of PVVs reported here can also help to explain
how meningeal vessels at the brain surface can become a critical
place for the neuroimmune interface,14,27–29 here in the context of
antitumor immunity in the brain. However, we also demonstrate
here that PVV structures are not limited to the brain surface.
Different tissue architecture in different organs provides a vari-
ability of structures that can be exploited as guidance, or repre-
sent challenges, for immune cell recruitment to reach their target
site. Especially, extracellular matrix components30 and blood
vessels31 were shown to be used as guiding paths for immune
cells to reach their destinations, such as for guiding T cells to
T cell zones in the spleen. It is therefore conceivable that PVVs
in the brain provide similar structures. It has been shown recently
that myeloid cells derived from the bone-marrow niche adjacent
to the brain and spinal cord can migrate through meningeal bar-
riers to the brain parenchyma under inﬂammatory conditions.32
Whether PVVs could act as a scaffold for facilitating migration
of these myeloid cells to brain tumors, or whether the bone-
marrow niche could also supply lymphocytes to the brain via
these routes, remains to be elucidated.
Intravital multi-photon imaging has recently proven to be a
powerful tool to elucidate lymphocyte migration within inﬂamed
lymph nodes33 as well as the dynamics of antitumor immunity
in the living animal, for example, by visualization of spreading of
T cell-derived interferon (IFN)-g and its effect on tumor cells.34
Speciﬁcally, a balanced regulation of T cell motility and dynamics
is important for efﬁcient T cell activation and the ability to conduct
antitumor effector functions. This has been studied in short-term
experiments using in vivo and ex vivo imaging for different as-
pects of T cell function, such as circulating to and within second-
ary lymphoid organs,18,31,35,36 antigen recognition at antigen-pre-
senting cells in lymphoid organs,37 migration and extravasation
from the blood,38 trafﬁcking to and within an extracranial
tumor,16,17,30,39,40 and engaging with extracranial tumor target
cells.17,41–44 Concluding from these studies, T cell motility seems
to be regulated depending on the context. During antigen search
and migration phases in the tumor periphery and during migration
to lymphoid organs, T cell motility is high. For allowing efﬁcient
antigenic contacts at antigen-presenting cells in lymphoid organs
or at target cells, T cell motility decreases to allow the formation of
stable immune synapses and stable interactions with antigen pre-
sented on target cells. In line with these previous imaging studies
of extracranial solid tumors, our work demonstrates the impor-
tance of a distinct interpretation of T cell movement patterns
and motility features, depending on their localization and stage
in the cancer-immunity cycle.45 Gaining more insight into these
major immune functions within the brain is important to under-
stand the prerequisites for effective intracranial immune re-
sponses and, subsequently, for the development of better thera-
peutic strategies for the treatment of brain tumors.
It has been demonstrated before that CTLA-4 expression
could affect T cell migration and motility in seemingly contrasting
ways. CTLA-4 has been shown to interfere with T cell activation
by limiting T cell dwell times at antigen-presenting cells
ex vivo46–50; however, increased T cell velocities were also asso-
ciated with successful anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy in extracra-
nial melanoma.18 Moreover, in vivo microscopy revealed that
anti-PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy restored
CD8+ T cell motility in the spleen following persistent viral-infec-
tion-induced exhaustion.51
The results of this study also point toward potential strategies
to improve immunotherapies for brain cancer. One strategy
could be to further increase ICAM-1-dependent T cell homing
to the brain by speciﬁc extracranial T cell priming,12 including

(I and J) PD-1 and LFA-1 expression of CD4+ T cells (I) and CD8+ T cells (J) were quantiﬁed in the tumor hemisphere. For statistical analysis multiple unpaired t
tests were used, n = 6 mice per group. See also Figures S5 and S6.

vaccination approaches. For the application of cellular therapies,
such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies or T cell
receptor (TCR)-T cell therapies, it might be beneﬁcial to engineer
these cells to express elevated levels of the ICAM-1 ligand LFA-1
to better equip them for brain homing. Those strategies can be
tested.
All in all, our study indicates that, in brain tumors, increased
T cell motility under ICI treatment is beneﬁcial for intracranial
antitumor immunity as it enables T cells to extravasate at PVVs
via an ICAM-1-guided mechanism and exploit the PVV perivas-
cular space as a fast track within the brain for efﬁcient homing
to the intracranial tumor. Thus, the discovery and characteriza-
tion of PVVs as an exquisite site of T cell recruitment helped to
decipher key features of antitumor immunity against melanoma
brain tumors; it is exciting to learn whether this mechanism
also applies to other malignancies in the brain and beyond.
Last but not least, those insights can be used to develop
improved antitumor immunotherapies.
Limitations of the study
Our study unravels T cell motility patterns in real time and over
several days in a living animal, in cancer and in the brain.
Although signs of surgery-induced inﬂammation were minimal
in our experiment, we cannot fully exclude that T cell trafﬁcking
might have been altered to some extent by the surgical proced-
ures necessary to achieve intravital imaging of the brain. Howev-
er, the additional murine and human immunohistological studies
conducted here conﬁrmed that T cell-rich PVV structures can be
found around many melanoma brain tumors, independent of
prior surgery. As pmel-1 T cells recognize melanocytic antigens,
adoptive transfer in C57BL/6 mice might also lead to off-tumor
autoreactive responses. Although signs of autoimmunity, i.e.,
loss of skin pigmentation, were not observed upon pmel-1
ACT, we cannot completely exclude ACT-mediated off-tumor ef-
fects. Only male mice were used for in vivo experiments in this
study; therefore, it is unclear whether the ﬁndings presented
here can be fully generalized to both sexes. Finally, this study
demonstrates the expression of ICAM-1 on endothelial cells
and pericytes, but future studies are required to study how ICI al-
ters expression of ICAM-1 on other cell types, such as myeloid
cells, and how this effects T cell dynamics and antitumor
response.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND STUDY PARTICIPANT DETAILS
Animals and surgical procedures
For adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) male C57BL/6J mice (>8 weeks of age, >20g body weight, Janvier Labs) were used as acceptor
mice. Homozygous pmel-1 mice (B6.Cg-Thy1a/Cy Tg(TcraTcrb)8Rest/J (RRID:IMSR_JAX:005023),53 male, >6 weeks of age, inhouse
bred, and homozygous OT-I mice (C57BL/6-Tg(TcraTcrb)1100Mjb/J)54 (kind gifts from Prof. Michael Platten, Heidelberg, Germany)
were used as T cell donors.
To visualize endogenous T cells, a transgenic mouse line in which Cre recombinase was expressed under a lymphocyte protein
tyrosine kinase (LCK) promotor B6.Cg-Tg(Lck-cre)548Jxm (RRID:IMSR_JAX:003802)55 (a kind gift from Prof. Ana Martin-Villalba)
was crossed with a transgenic mouse that expressed ﬂoxed tdTomato (tdTom) B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze mice (RRI-
D:IMSR_JAX:007914)56 (a kind gift from Dr. Darjus Tschaharganeh). This resulted in the T cell reporter mouse line (B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)
26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze Tg(Lck-cre)548Jxm) LCK-Cre+/- x lox-stop-lox (LSL)-tdTomato+/+ or +/-, here referred to as LCK-Cre x LSL-
tdTomato.
Animals were housed under speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions at the DKFZ animal care facility. All animal procedures were
approved by the Regierungspraesidium Karlsruhe, Germany (local governmental authority for laboratory animal research).
Chronic cranial window implantation
LCK-Cre x LSL-tdTomato mice (>8 weeks of age, >20g body weight) and C57BL/6J acceptor mice underwent surgical procedure to
implant a chronic cranial window (6 mm diameter) and a titan ring for painless head ﬁxation during IVM as described before.59 To
ensure equal experimental settings without inﬂammation, mice were allowed to recover for at least 3 weeks following cranial window
surgery until ﬂank tumor inoculation and cortical tumor injections were performed.
Flank tumor inoculation
For ﬂank tumor inoculation, mice were anesthetized using isoﬂurane (maximum 5% in 0.5 l/min O2 for initiation, followed by maximum
2% in 0.5 l/min O2) and the ﬂank was shaved and disinfected. A volume of 100 ml comprising 150,000 murine melanoma cells in a
1:1 mixture with Matrigel (Corning) was injected subcutaneously (s.c).
Cortical and striatal tumor injection
For cortical tumor injection (TI) two days post s.c. ﬂank tumor injection, mice were anaesthetized with a Ketamin/Xylazin mix (Ketamin
100 mg/kg, Xylazin 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) and the window cover glass was carefully removed. Fluorescently labeled mu-
rine melanoma cells resuspended in PBS were centrifuged at 500 rcf, PBS supernatant was removed and pelleted cells were directly
loaded into a 10 ml Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, WICOM Heppenheim, Hamilton Bonaduz 701 10mL, Ref.: 80300). 0.1-0.2 ml of pelleted
cells were stereotactically injected into the mouse cortex using a motorized Stoelting QSI Quintessential Stereotaxic Injector (Stoelt-
ing No 53311) at an injection speed of 0.1 ml/min at a depth of approximately 500 mm with an angle of 45 into the parietal lobe, re-
sulting in 30,000- 100,000 cortically injected cells. The tumor injection site was in the center of the hemisphere accessible through the
window approx. 1 - 1.5 mm lateral of the sagittal sinus and approx. 0.5 -1 mm distal from large cortical vessels, as rupture of these
vessels during the injection procedure could lead to fatal bleeding. The window was resealed with a new 6 mm cover glass. Injections
into the striatum were performed in mice without cranial windows. The skull was exposed by creating a small incision in the skin along
midline of the skull. Using a surgical drill, a small hole was created in the mouse skull and subsequently 30,000-100,000 ﬂuorescent
tumor cells were injected as described above, however at a depth of 3 mm to reach the striatum. Following injection, the skin is
sutured.

Adoptive T cell transfer
To follow ex vivo labeled ﬂuorescent T cells that speciﬁcally recognize the melanoma antigen gp100, adoptive T cell transfer of
ex vivo stimulated CD8+ pmel-1 T cells was performed.60 For ACT with antigen-unspeciﬁc T cells, CD8+ OT-I T cells were isolated
from OT-I transgenic mice. On day 5 post cortical ﬂank tumor injection, lymphocytes were isolated from spleen and inguinal, axial,
mesenteric and cervical lymph nodes of naı¨ve pmel-1 or OT-I donor mice. The organs were meshed through a 70 mm cell strainer
to generate a single cell suspension, erythrocytes were lysed by incubating in ACK lysing buffer (Gibco, # A104920) on ice for
90 sec. The cells were cultured in vitro for three days at 37 C, 5% CO2 in RPMI1640 (PAN-Biotech #P04-18500) supplemented
with 10% FBS (Gibco, #10500-064, Lot 08Q5107K), 100 U ml1 penicillin, 100 mg ml1 streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 mM
2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 25mM HEPES buffer (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 0.1M
non-essential amino-acid (Gibco), 2 mg/ml hgp10025-33 peptide (GenScript, #RP20344) or 2 mg/ml SIINFEKL peptide
(Ovalbumin257-264, Sigma-Aldrich, #S7951) for pmel-1 or OT-I T cells respectively, and 30 U/ml IL-2 (Proleukin, Novartis) for
in vitro stimulation. On day 8 post cortical tumor inoculation, in vitro activated lymphocytes were harvested and CD8+ T cells
were enriched by using a ‘‘CD8a+ T Cell Isolation Kit, mouse’’ (MACS Milteny Biotec, # 130-095-236) according to manufacturer’s
instructions, ﬂuorescently labeled with 1 mM-2.5 mM CellTracker Green CMFDA Dye (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, #C2925), and
subsequent ACT was performed by intravenous injection of 5 x 106 T cells in 100 ml PBS in the lateral tail vein of tumor bearing
acceptor mice.
In vivo two-photon laser scanning microscopy (IVM)
For IVM mice were anesthetized using isoﬂurane (maximum 5% in 0.5 l/min O2 for initiation) for painless ﬁxation in a custom-made
holder. Then anesthesia was continued through a nose mask with maximum 2% isoﬂurane in 0.5 l/min O2 for imaging using a Zeiss
LSM 7 MP equipped with a Chameleon Ultra II laser or a Discovery NX laser (both from Coherent), a 20x/1.0 W-Plan-Apochromat
objective (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) and using BP500-550nm / BP575-610nm optical ﬁlters (Carl Zeiss Microscopy). To visualize vascu-
lature in vivo, i.v. injection of 100 mL of tetramethylrhodamine-isothiocyanate-Dextran (5 mg mL, TRITC Dextran; average MW:
500,000, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) into the lateral tail vein was performed directly prior to imaging. TRITC injection was omitted when
anti-ICAM-1 FITC was injected. For visualization of GFP, CMFDA and tdTomato an excitation wavelength of 950 nm was used,
for ICAM-1-FITC 750 nm and for TRITC-Dextran 850 nm was used. Lowest adequate laser power and a gains ranging from 600
to 800 was used for image acquisition. Z steps were 3-10 mm depending on the experiment (10 mm for volume measurements
and timeseries, 3 – 5 mm for stacks of speciﬁc regions).
ACT model mice were analyzed regularly between day 5 and day 14 post cortical tumor injection by IVM, LCK-Cre x LSL-tdTomato
mice were analyzed regularly between day 1 and day 14 post cortical tumor injection.
Immune-checkpoint therapy
For immune checkpoint therapy, animals were treated by intraperitoneal injection with 250 mg anti-PD-1 (BioX Cell #BE0146, RRI-
D:AB_10949053, Lot 665417S1, Lot 695318A1) and 100 mg anti-CTLA-4 (BioX Cell #BE0164, RRID:AB_10949609, Lot 63617J2),
or isotype antibodies (BioX Cell #BE0089, RRID:AB_1107769, Lot 686318F1; BioX Cell #BE0086, RRID:AB_1107791, Lot
645417J3) for the ICI and control group respectively, starting from day 7 post cortical injection every two days until the end of the
experiment.
Monitoring of ﬂank tumor size
Using caliper measurement every 2-4 days post s.c. ﬂank tumor injection, the long tumor diameter D and the short tumor diameter
d were measured respectively, and the tumor volume was calculated as: Volume = (D 3 d2)/2.
Cell lines
The murine melanoma cell lines Ret (a kind gift from V. Umansky, Mannheim, Germany), Ret CM TyrKO, HCmel1252 (a kind gift from J.
Landsberg and T. T€uting, Bonn, Germany, genetically modiﬁed by D. Hinze to generate HCmel12Tyr-/- (HCmel12 TyrKO) cells) and
HCmel12 TyrKO were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, #105000-064, Lot 08Q5107K),
100 U ml1 penicillin, 100 mg ml1 streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% L-Glutamine at 37C and 5% CO2. To avoid interference
of pigmented cells with ﬂuorescence microscopy, Tyrosinase was stably knocked out in Ret CM and HCmel12 cells using
CRISPR-Cas9 technology. For Ret CM TyrKO cells, four brain passages were performed to increase brain tropism.61 For IVM exper-
iments, Tyrosinase KO (TyrKO) cells were transduced with expression vectors for red ﬂuorescent protein (tdTomato) or green ﬂuo-
rescent protein (GFP).
GL261 gp100-over-expressing cells (a kind gift from Prof. Michael Platten) and the murine tdTomato-expressing brain-passaged
mammary adenocarcinoma E0771 cell line (a kind gift from Cyrus M. Ghajar) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10 % (FBS), 100 U ml1 penicillin, and 100 mg ml1 streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 C, 5% CO2. All
cells were regularly tested in-house for mycoplasma contamination by PCR.
Brain metastasis patient samples
The utilization of FFPE tumor material for the immunohistochemical analyses was approved by the ethics committee of the University
of Dresden (EK 48022018). The studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

METHOD DETAILS
Immuno-blotting
For melanoma antigen gp100 expression analysis, cell pellets were lysed with protein lysis buffer and diluted with L€ammli-Buffer 1:4.
Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay and a total of 50 mg of protein was loaded per well on a 10% SDS-acryl-
amide gel. Gel electrophoreses was performed at 120 V in running buffer. Protein was transferred from the gel to a nitrocellulose
membrane by semi-dry blotting. The membrane was blocked with 5% powdered milk for 45 min at room temperature (RT), subse-
quently membrane was incubated with anti-gp100 antibody (Abcam, ab137078, RRID:AB_2732921, Lot GR304976-9) (diluted
1:1000 in 5% milk) at 4C over night. After washing three times with TBS-T, the membrane was incubated with secondary anti-rabbit
IgG horse radish peroxidase (HRP) antibody (Novus Biologicals, NB7160, RRID:AB_10124655, Lot P39) (diluted 1:5000 in 5% milk)
for 45 min at RT. HRP signal was developed with ECL Substrate and images were taken by ChemiDoc MP imaging system (BioRad).
After stripping with stripping buffer (62.5 mM TRIS HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.7% beta-mercaptoethanol) at 50C for 30 min, the mem-
brane was incubated with mouse anti-b-actin IgG1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, # sc-47778, RRID:AB_2714189) (diluted
1:1000 in 5% milk) overnight at 4C and subsequently with secondary antibody anti-mouse IgG1 HRP (Bethyl Laboratories, #A90-
205P, RRID:AB_10634122, Lot A90-205P-3) (diluted 1:5000 in 5% milk) for 45 min at RT and images were taken with ChemiDoc
MP (Bio-Rad Laboratories) imaging system.
Flow Cytometry
For ﬂow cytometric analysis of pmel-1 T cells, lymphocytes were isolated from lymph nodes (inguinal, axial, cervical, mesenteric) and
spleen of pmel-1 homozygous mice. The organs were meshed through a 70 mm cell strainer for producing a single cell suspension,
erythrocytes of spleen samples were lysed by incubating in ACK lysing buffer (Gibco, # A104920) on ice for 90 seconds. The cells
were cultured in vitro for three days as described above (see Adoptive T cell transfer section). In vitro activated lymphocytes and
lymphocytes freshly isolated from a pmel-1 mouse (unstimulated control) were harvested and CD8+ T cells were enriched by using
a ‘‘CD8a+ T Cell Isolation Kit, mouse’’ (Milteny, # 130-095-236). Cells were washed with PBS and blocked with anti-CD16/anti-CD32
(eBiosciences, 14-0161-85, RRID:AB_467134) for 20 min on ice and were incubated with antibody panels 1 and 2 (see table below,
surface marker staining) for 45 min on ice.
For ﬂow cytometric analysis of tdTomato expression in lymphocytes isolated from LCK-Cre x LSL-tdTomato mice, lymphocytes
were isolated from lymph nodes (inguinal, axial, cervical, mesenteric) and spleen of two LCK-Cre-/- x LSL-tdTomato+/+ mice as nega-
tive controls, as described above. After erythrocyte lysis, lymphocytes were washed with PBS and blocking and ﬂow cytometry stain-
ing with surface marker panel 3 (see table below) were performed as described above.
For compensation, single color stainings were measured using OneComp eBeads (Invitrogen, #01-1111-42) and ArC Amin-reac-
tive Compensation Bead kit (Invitrogen, A10346). Cells were analyzed on a BD FACS Canto II equipped with UV (405 nm), blue
(488 nm) and red (633 nm) laser and subsequent data analysis was performed using FlowJo software v10.9.0.
For spectral ﬂow cytometric analysis of immune cells, endothelial cells and pericytes isolated from the brain of LCK-Cre x LSL-
tdTomato mice with HCmel12 TyrKO GFP brain tumors, mice were sacriﬁced on day 10 post cortical tumor injection by cardiac perfu-
sion with PBS. The brain was isolated, the two hemispheres were separated and a region of approx. 4 x 4 mm around the tumor in-
jection site was isolated from the cortex, and a region of equivalent size and location was isolated from the contralateral non-tumor
bearing hemisphere. To enrich immune cells from each hemisphere, the hemispheres were cut into small pieces and each sample
was digested in 3 mL 50 mg/mL Liberase TL (Roche) for 30 min at 37C. Subsequently the brain tissue was meshed ﬁrst through a
100 mm cell strainer, then through a 70 mm cell strainer and cell strainers were washed with Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS).
After washing with HBSS, the digested brain tissue was centrifuged for 30 min at 1467 x g on a 25% Percoll continuous gradient
without active deceleration. After centrifugation, the myelin layer on top was removed carefully. The rest of the sample was topped
up to 50 mL with PBS and centrifuged at 500 x g for 10 min. After enrichment of immune cells and myelin removal, the cells were
blocked with human anti-CD16/ anti-CD32 for 15 min on ice, then surface marker staining with the antibodies of panel 4 was per-
formed for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed with PBS, ﬁxed using BD Cytoﬁx/Cytoperm and were kept on ice until data was acquired
using an ID7000 Spectral Cell Analyzer (Sony Biotechnology) equipped with 5 lasers. FlowJo Version v10.9.0 (was used for data
analysis, gates were set according to the appropriate ﬂuorescence minus one (FMO) controls).

In vivo antibody staining
For in vivo antibody staining of vascular ICAM-1, 100 mg anti-ICAM-1 FITC (Invitrogen #11-0541-82, RRID:AB_465094, Lots 2083928,
2238585) or respective isotype control antibody (Invitrogen #11-4031-82, RRID:AB_470004, Lots 1995330, 2122634) were injected
into the lateral tail vein of LCK-Cre x LSL-tdTomato mice on day 10 post cortical TI. ICAM-1 FITC signal was analyzed by IVM before
and 1-3h post i.v. injection of labeled anti-ICAM-1 antibody.
In vivo functional ICAM-1 blocking
For functional blocking of ICAM-1 in vivo, HCmel12 TyrKO tumor bearing LCK-Cre x LSL-tdTomato mice with chronic cranial window
were injected with 100 mg anti-ICAM-1 (CD54 (ICAM-1) monoclonal antibody, functional grade; clone YN1/1.7.4; eBioscience
#16-0541-85; Lots 2362876, 2452206; RRID: AB_468980) or isotype control antibody (Rat IgG2b kappa isotype; clone eB149/
10H5; eBioscience #16-4031-85; Lot 2345592; RRID: AB_470152) i.v. per mouse and timepoint. Antibody injections started at
day 3 post cortical TI and were continued every three days until the end of the experiment. T cell inﬁltration and brain tumor growth
were followed by IVM.
Immunoﬂuorescence
For immunoﬂuorescence analysis HCmel12 TyrKO tdTomato cells were injected s.c. into the ﬂank of male C57BL/6 mice >8 weeks of
age, followed by cortical injection through a drill hole two days later, as described below. On day 8, ACT was performed as described
above and mice were sacriﬁced by intracardiac perfusion with PBS and 4% PFA. The brains were isolated and were incubated with
4% PFA at RT for 4h. After incubation in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4C, the brains were frozen in TissueTek Freezing medium
and 10 mm thick coronal brain sections were cut with a Cryo-microtome Leica CM3050 S. Sections were air dried for 20-30 min at RT
and subsequently blocked with 3% BSA in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS at RT for 1h. Primary antibodies (Goat anti m/r CD31 (R&D,
#AF3628, RRID:AB_2161028, Lot# YZU0119021) 1:200, Goat anti m CD13(R&D, #AF2335, RRID:AB_2227288, Lot#VRR0322032)
1:200, Rat anti-ICAM-1 (Invitrogen, #14054182, RRID:AB_467301, Lot# 2177738) 1:25 diluted in blocking solution) were incubated
on slides over night at 4C. Slides were washed three times with 0.3% TritonX-100 in PBS (PBS-T) before secondary antibody incu-
bation diluted 1:400 in blocking solution (AF488 Donkey Anti-Goat (Invitrogen, #A11055, RRID:AB_2534102, Lot#2211210), Dy-
Light650 Donkey anti-Rat (Invitrogen, #SA5-10029, RRID:AB_2556609, Lot# VH3056141) for 1h at RT, subsequent washing with
PBS-T for 5 min at RT and incubation with 1 mg/ml DAPI in blocking buffer for 5 min at RT. After two more washing steps with
PBS-T, a cover slip was mounted with Vectashield mounting medium. The images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 780 spinning
disk microscope and 63x oil-immersion objective (1.4 Oil Plan-Apochromat). Fiji (ImageJ)58 was used for image processing by rolling
ball background subtraction and maximum intensity projection (MIP) of up to 3 z-planes and brightness and contrast adjustments.
Multiparametric immunoﬂuorescence
Formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks were cut into 3–5 mm sections. Multi-parametric immunoﬂuorescence stain-
ings of human brain metastasis samples were performed on the Ventana Ultra Instrument (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Tissues were
deparafﬁnized and antigen retrieval was performed in the cell conditioning 1 solution (Roche). Incubation of each primary antibody
followed for 32 min at 36C. Then, the appropriate secondary antibody (OmniMap anti-mouse or anti-rabbit, ready-to-use, all from
Ventana Medical Systems) was applied for 12 min. Finally, one of the tyramide signal ampliﬁcation (TSA) ﬂuorophores (Akoya Bio-
sciences, OPAL520, OPAL540, OPAL570 or OPAL690) was added to the tissue slides for 8 min. Stripping of the primary and sec-
ondary antibodies took place by heating the slides at 100C in the cell conditioning 2 solution (Roche) for 24 min. This sequence
of steps (except deparafﬁnization and antigen retrieval) was repeated for each primary antibody. Finally, all tissue slides were coun-
terstained with spectral DAPI (Akoya Biosciences) and coverslipped with ﬂuoromount medium (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, Ala-
bama, USA). The primary antibodies used for the multiplex immunoﬂuorescence stainings are summarized in the table below. The
utilization of FFPE tumor material for the immunohistochemical analyses was approved by the ethics committee of the University
of Dresden (EK 48022018). The studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

All stained sections were whole scanned (3100 magniﬁcation) using the Vectra 3 automated quantitative pathology imaging sys-
tem (Akoya Biosciences). Relevant areas were marked in the phenochart software (Akoya Biosciences) and scanned (3200 magni-
ﬁcation) for all patient slides. The analysis of stainings was performed using the inForm software (Akoya Biosciences) and ImageJ/Fiji.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Image Processing and Quantiﬁcation
Image processing was always performed on the whole image. Tile scan images were stitched using ZenBlack (Carl Zeiss Microscopy).
For clearance of channel overlap channel subtraction was performed on two-photon microscopy images using ZenBlack (Carl Zeiss
Microscopy) or Fiji.58 A Gaussian Filter was applied for smoothing using Imaris (Bitplane) or Fiji. Tumor volume was analyzed from
three-dimensional two-photon microscopy images by intensity thresholding in Fiji. Pmel-1 T cells were counted manually using Fiji.
For the analysis of ICAM-1 in vivo staining, ICAM-1 signal intensities of two-photon images were measured by analyzing peak in-
tensities at the vessel walls using Fiji. To balance out batch differences between mice, ICAM-1 signal intensities at vessel walls of
PVVs were normalized to mean ICAM-1 signal intensities at brain surface capillaries of the respective mouse. T cell signal in the peri-
vascular space within 30 mm of distance from the vessel wall was measured as mean intensity of a binary T cell mask generated by
thresholding using Fiji.
For microregional tumor volume measurement over time, regions of interest of 0.00401802 mm3 were chosen and the same re-
gions of interest based on the vasculature were followed over time from day 9 to day 12 post cortical tumor injection and thresholding
was used to quantify tumor volume per region, while transferred T cells of day 10 datasets were counted manually.
Semi-automated three-dimensional T cell tracking of two-photon timeseries images of the ACT model was performed using Imaris
(Bitplane). We deﬁned transferred T cells with mean velocity R 50 nm/s and mean displacement R10 nm/s as ‘‘motile’’ and T cells
with a mean velocity < 50 nm/s and mean displacement < 10 nm/s as ‘‘stationary’’, as these cells stayed within distance of approx-
imately one cell length during a typical time series duration of 25 min. To ensure that T cells that travelled further from its track origin
but returned to its origin were not deﬁned as stationary, the mean velocity threshold of 50 nm/s was included into this deﬁnition.
Videos from IVM timeseries data were made after pre-processing with Fiji, Zen Black (Zeiss) and Imaris (Bitplane) with Adobe Pre-
miere Pro.
For spatio-temporal analysis of the distribution of transferred pmel-1 T cells at distinct vessel types (Figure 2C), regions of interest
(ROIs) containing distinct vessel types were selected manually and volumes of each ROI were determined. T cells were counted
manually for each ROI and local T cell density was calculated as T cell number of one ROI / volume (mm3) of the respective ROI.
For spatio-temporal analysis of the distribution of endogenous T cells of LCK-Cre x LSL-tdTomato mice at distinct vessel types in
the LCK-Cre x LSL-tdTomato model (Figure 2D), IVM images were preprocessed using machine learning in Ilastik57 for pixel classi-
ﬁcation of vessels and T cells. Segmented images were further analyzed using Arivis Vision 4D (Arivis AG) by 3D modeling of the
vasculature structure and image regions were manually cut to only include distinct vessel types (PVVs, intratumoral vessels, peritu-
moral capillaries and the sagittal sinus). Subsequent distance map calculations were performed for each vessel type and the volume
of T cells within 15 mm proximity of the respective blood vessels according to the distance map was measured and to account for
differences in vessel numbers and sizes the T cell volume was normalized to the respective vessel surface area for quantiﬁcation.
IVM images of T cell inﬁltration and brain tumor volume of mice under functional in vivo ICAM-1 blockage were pre-processed as
described above, then machine learning based pixel classiﬁcation of T cells and tumor cells was performed using Ilastik. Pixel prob-
ability maps were used to generate binary images using thresholding in Fiji. Distance map calculation in Fiji was used to determine a
200 mm margin around the binarized tumor volume to deﬁne the region of interest, in which the T cell volume was determined. Using
the 3D Voxel Counter Plugin in Fiji, the volumes of the tumor region of interest and the cumulative T cell volumes were determined. For
quantiﬁcation of T cell inﬁltration, the cumulative T cell volume was normalized to the volume of the tumor region of interest. If brain
tumors had regressed completely, the tumor region of interest of a timepoint when tumor mass was still detectable was used at the
estimated location.
For quantiﬁcation of multiparametric immunoﬂuorescence images of human melanoma brain metastasis patient samples intratu-
moral and peritumoral areas were deﬁned manually by assessing distribution and morphology of nuclei, expression of MelanA/
HMB45 as tumor markers and presence of GFAP expression. For quantiﬁcation of vessels Ilastik pixel classiﬁcation and object
detection was used to detect and quantify capillary vessels, large vessels and T cells. As segmentation of individual T cells located
in T cell clusters of highly inﬁltrated tissue was not very accurate, the area covered by T cell per area analyzed was used to quantify
T cell inﬁltration.
