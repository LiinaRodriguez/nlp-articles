According to WHO and other key statistics, cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 
10 million deaths in 2020. By identifying cancer early, it is more likely to respond to treatment, resulting in a 
better chance of survival as well as a lower cost of treatment. Early detection of cancer and avoiding delays in 
treatment can significantly improve the lives of cancer patients. Nanomaterial-based sensors with the ability to 
extract and identify tumor-specific biomarkers, circulating tumor cells, or extracellular vesicles secreted by the 
tumor have the potential to diagnose cancer considerably earlier and enhance patient long-term survival. In this 
review, we provide the application of nanosensors for the early detection of cancer and the recent techniques for 
clinically diagnosing cancer patients’ biomarker levels. Furthermore, the presented works are compared based on 
their sensitivity and selectivity in the detection of different kinds of cancer biomarkers.   
1. Introduction 
1.1. Invention and general development procedure of nanosensors 
Nanosensors are devices that utilize nanotechnology to detect and 
respond to specific physical, chemical, or biological stimuli at the 
nanoscale level. The invention and development of nanosensors involve 
a multi-step procedure, which can be summarized as follows:  
• Conceptualization and Design: The first step is to conceptualize the 
idea for a nanosensor and define its intended purpose and target 
application. This involves identifying the specific analyte or stimulus 
to be detected and determining the desired sensitivity, selectivity, 
and operational parameters. The sensor design also considers the 
appropriate nanomaterials, transduction mechanisms, and fabrica­
tion techniques to achieve the desired functionality. 
• Nanomaterial Selection: Nanosensors often incorporate nano­
materials that exhibit unique properties at the nanoscale. These 
materials can include nanoparticles (e.g., metal, semiconductor, or 
carbon-based), nanowires, nanotubes, or two-dimensional materials 
(e.g., graphene). The choice of nanomaterial depends on factors such 
as their sensing capabilities, compatibility with the target analyte, 
stability, and ease of fabrication. 
• Sensing Mechanism: Nanosensors employ various sensing mecha­
nisms to detect and transduce the target stimulus into measurable 
signals. These mechanisms can include optical, electrical, magnetic, 
thermal, or mechanical principles. For example, optical nanosensors 
may rely on changes in light absorption, fluorescence, or surface 
plasmon resonance, while electrical nanosensors may measure 
changes in electrical conductivity or capacitance.  
• Fabrication Techniques: Nanosensors are typically fabricated using 
nanofabrication techniques, which allow precise control over the 
size, shape, and composition of the nanostructures. Common fabri­
cation techniques include top-down approaches (e.g., electron beam 
lithography, focused ion beam milling) and bottom-up approaches 
(e.g., chemical vapor deposition, self-assembly). These techniques 
enable the production of nanosensors with high precision and 
reproducibility. 
• Surface Functionalization: Nanosensors often require surface func­
tionalization to enhance their selectivity and sensitivity towards the 
target analyte. Functionalization involves modifying the nano­
sensor’s surface with specific receptors or recognition elements that 
can interact selectively with the analyte of interest. These receptors 
can be antibodies, enzymes, DNA sequences, or molecularly 
imprinted polymers.  
• Signal Transduction and Readout: Once the target stimulus interacts 
with the nanosensor, the resulting changes in the sensor’s properties

or signals need to be transduced and measured. This can involve 
converting physical or chemical changes into electrical signals, op­
tical signals, or other measurable outputs. Signal transduction 
methods may include electrical measurements, spectroscopy, imag­
ing techniques, or mass-sensitive detection methods. 
• Testing and Optimization: After fabrication, the nanosensors un­
dergo rigorous testing to evaluate their performance, sensitivity, 
selectivity, and response time. The sensors are exposed to known 
analytes or stimuli under controlled conditions to validate their 
functionality. Based on the test results, iterative optimization pro­
cesses are carried out to improve the sensor’s performance and 
reliability. 
• Integration and Packaging: Once the nanosensors have been devel­
oped and optimized, they can be integrated into larger systems or 
devices for practical applications. This may involve incorporating 
the sensors into microfluidic platforms, wearable devices, or elec­
tronic circuits. The packaging of nanosensors ensures their protec­
tion, stability, and ease of use in real-world environments.  
• Commercialization and Scaling: Successful nanosensor technologies 
can undergo commercialization and scaling to enable mass produc­
tion and widespread adoption. This involves manufacturing pro­
cesses, quality control measures, and establishing supply chains to 
meet market demands. 
It’s important to note that the development of nanosensors is a highly 
interdisciplinary field, involving expertise from various disciplines such 
as nanotechnology, materials science, chemistry, physics, biology, and 
engineering. 
1.2. Working principle of nanosensors 
A nanosensor can measure down to the level of single molecules. A 
nanosensor consists of a sensor, analyte, transducer, and detector. 
Typically, nanosensors work by tracking the electrical changes in the 
sensor materials. By diffusing from the solution to the sensor surface, the 
analyte reacts specifically and efficiently, resulting in a change in the 
physicochemical properties of the transducer surface, which in turn al­
ters the optical or electronic properties of the transducer surface, 
causing an electrical signal which can be detected[1]. 
1.3. Recognition elements/sensing elements 
Nanosensors can detect several analytes and be selective, some of 
them can detect only one type of analyte and are known as single sen­
sors, while others can detect many types of analytes and are known as 
multiplex sensors. A nanosensor’s recognition element reveals its 
selectivity and specificity. Many recognition elements have been used in 
the design of nanosensors, including antibodies, aptamers, enzymes, and 
some functional proteins. The most common recognition elements in 
nanosensors are aptamers and antibodies[2]. 
1.4. Nanosensor types 
Nanosensors can be defined and categorized by their constituent 
materials, their detection targets, and the signals they use to transmit 
information. Materials that are used to fabricate nanosensors are 
including silicon nitride cantilevers, metallic/ magnetic nanoparticles, 
nanotubes, nanochannels, and others. The detection target of nano­
sensors can be antibodies, peptides, biological molecules, dangerous 
inorganic analytes, aptamers, enzymes, and others[3]. 
1.4.1. Nanosensors based on nanoparticles and nanoclusters 
Noble metal nanoparticles have excellent size-dependent optical 
properties that have been used to make optical nanosensors. Several 
factors affect the spectrum of a phenomenon called localized surface 
plasmon resonance (LSPR), including the size, shape, and material of the 
particles and their environments. Single-molecule limit of detection for 
large biomolecules can be obtained by LSPR nanosensors due to their 
high sensitivity. In addition to metal nanoparticles, semiconductor 
quantum dots have been used to build optical nanosensors based on 
fluorescence measurements and nanoscale probes containing dyes are 
being developed as optical sensors to detect analytes whose fluorescence 
is quenched in contact with analyte; nanoparticle films have been used 
for gas sensors; magnetic nanoparticles bound to biorecognition mole­
cules (i.e. DNA, enzymes, etc.) have been used to enrich the analyte to be 
detected[4]. 
Nanosensors based on nanoparticles and nanoclusters offer several 
benefits and drawbacks. Here are some of the key points to consider:  
• Benefits:  
1. Sensitivity: Nanoparticles and nanoclusters possess high surface-to- 
volume ratios, which enhance their sensitivity to changes in the 
surrounding environment. This makes them excellent candidates for 
detecting and measuring small quantities of analytes or signals.  
2. Selectivity: Functionalizing nanoparticles and nanoclusters with 
specific molecules or coatings allows for high selectivity in sensing 
particular substances or target analytes. This enables precise detec­
tion and discrimination of various chemicals, biomarkers, or 
pollutants.  
3. Miniaturization: Nanosensors can be miniaturized to extremely small 
sizes, enabling their integration into various devices and systems. 
This feature is particularly advantageous for applications where 
space is limited, such as wearable devices, medical implants, or 
environmental monitoring in confined spaces.  
4. Versatility: Nanoparticles and nanoclusters can be engineered with 
different materials and structures, providing versatility in sensor 
design and functionality. They can be tailored to respond to specific 
stimuli, including light, temperature, pressure, or chemical in­
teractions, expanding their applicability to diverse sensing scenarios. 
5. Real-time monitoring: The small size and rapid response of nano­
sensors make them suitable for real-time monitoring applications. 
They can provide continuous, instantaneous data collection, allow­
ing for immediate detection of changes or events.  
• Drawbacks: 
1. Signal-to-noise ratio: Nanosensors, particularly those based on in­
dividual nanoparticles, can be susceptible to noise and interference. 
Background signals, fluctuations, or impurities in the environment 
can affect the accuracy and reliability of measurements, requiring 
careful signal processing and calibration.  
2. Stability and reproducibility: Nanoparticles and nanoclusters may 
exhibit variations in their physicochemical properties, leading to 
challenges in reproducibility and long-term stability of sensor per­
formance. Manufacturing processes need to be optimized to ensure 
consistent sensor behavior across different batches.  
3. Cost: The production and functionalization of nanoparticles and 
nanoclusters for sensing applications can be expensive, especially 
when large quantities or specific materials are required. The cost 
factor may limit their widespread adoption, particularly in resource- 
constrained settings.  
4. Integration challenges: Integrating nanosensors into existing systems 
or devices can be technically complex. Ensuring compatibility, 
power supply, and data transmission with other components or 
electronics may present challenges that need to be addressed during 
the design and implementation stages.  
5. Biocompatibility and toxicity: When considering nanosensors for 
biomedical applications, the biocompatibility and potential toxicity 
of nanoparticles or nanoclusters must be thoroughly evaluated. The 
interaction between the nanosensors and living systems should be 
carefully assessed to ensure their safe and effective use.

It’s important to note that the benefits and drawbacks can vary 
depending on the specific application and the type of nanoparticles or 
nanoclusters used. Ongoing research and technological advancements 
aim to address these challenges and further enhance the capabilities of 
nanosensors for various fields. 
1.4.2. Nanosensors based on carbon nanotubes, nanofibers, and nanowires 
Carbone nanotubes (CNTs) are robust and have inert structures, but 
their electrical properties are highly sensitive to the effect of charge 
transfer and chemical doping by various molecules. Accordingly, most 
carbon nanotube-based sensors are field effect transistors (FET). To 
make CNTs selective to the target analyte, functionalization of them is 
an effective method. The molecular recognition interactions between 
functionalized CNT and target analytes are used to develop various types 
of sensors. For example, researchers decorated single-walled carbon 
nanotubes (SWCNTs) with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to obtain nano­
sensors[5]. They have been used to maximize gas sensor responses in 
exhaled breath analysis for the detection of volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs) which are biomarkers for various diseases; for example, acetone, 
hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and toluene can be used as biomarkers for 
evaluating diabetes, halitosis, kidney malfunction, and lung cancer, 
respectively[6,7].

material, has great potential to be used in chemical and biological sen­
sors. Researchers have developed sensing devices with exceptionally 
high speed, using the distinctive 2D structure of graphene oxide (GO) 
combined with its superpermeability to water molecules (“Ultrafast 
graphene sensor monitors your breath while you speak”). It has been 
discovered that chemical vapors change graphene transistor noise 
spectra, allowing scientists to detect many vapors with a single device 
made of pristine graphene - no functionalization of the graphene surface 
necessary (“Selective gas sensing with pristine graphene”)[8]. 
M. Khazaei et al.

unique properties of graphene. However, they also have certain draw­
backs that need to be addressed. Let’s explore both the benefits and 
drawbacks of nanosensors based on graphene:  
• Benefits:  
1. High Sensitivity: Graphene is an exceptional material known for its 
high sensitivity to various stimuli. Graphene-based nanosensors can 
detect even small changes in temperature, pressure, strain, or 
chemical composition, making them highly sensitive sensors for a 
wide range of applications.  
2. Fast Response Time: Graphene’s thin and two-dimensional structure 
enables rapid response to changes in the environment. Nanosensors 
based on graphene can detect and transmit signals quickly, making 
them suitable for real-time monitoring applications.  
3. Wide Detection Range: Graphene-based nanosensors can detect a 
broad spectrum of signals, including electromagnetic waves, gases, 
chemicals, and biomolecules. This versatility makes them valuable in 
diverse fields, such as environmental monitoring, healthcare, and 
industrial applications. 
4. Miniaturization: Graphene is a two-dimensional material, which al­
lows for the development of nanoscale sensors. These nanosensors 
can be integrated into tiny devices and systems, enabling miniatur­
ization and integration into various platforms, including wearable 
devices and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.  
5. Low Power Consumption: Graphene-based nanosensors typically 
have low power requirements due to their small size and efficient 
signal transduction mechanisms. This low power consumption is 
advantageous for applications that require prolonged battery life or 
energy-efficient operation.  
• Drawbacks:  
1. Scalability: While graphene-based nanosensors show great promise, 
scaling up their production and integration into practical devices can 
be challenging. Achieving large-scale, cost-effective fabrication 
methods while maintaining high-quality graphene is an ongoing 
research area. 
2. Signal-to-Noise Ratio: Graphene-based nanosensors can be suscep­
tible to noise interference, affecting the signal-to-noise ratio and 
potentially limiting their sensitivity. Shielding techniques and care­
ful design considerations are necessary to mitigate this issue.  
3. Stability and Durability: Graphene is prone to degradation under 
certain environmental conditions, such as humidity and exposure to 
reactive substances. Ensuring the stability and long-term durability 
of graphene-based nanosensors remains a technical challenge.  
4. Specificity: Graphene-based nanosensors may face challenges in 
achieving high selectivity and specificity for target analytes. Over­
coming cross-reactivity and interference from background signals is 
crucial for reliable and accurate sensing.  
5. Cost: Currently, the production of high-quality graphene at large 
scale can be expensive, limiting the widespread adoption of 
graphene-based nanosensors. However, ongoing research and tech­
nological advancements are expected to address this drawback in the 
future. 
It’s important to note that research in graphene-based nanosensors is 
rapidly evolving, and ongoing advancements may help address some of 
the current drawbacks. As the field progresses, the benefits of nano­
sensors based on graphene are expected to outweigh their limitations, 
leading to innovative applications in various domains. 
1.4.4. Nanosensors based on bulk nanostructured materials 
While nanoparticles have several properties that make them useful 
for nanosensor applications, their catalytic behavior is the most 
important in electrochemical sensors. The design of gas diffusion elec­
trodes can be improved through the use of platinum nanoparticles 
supported on materials such as porous carbon or noble metals. 
Furthermore, nanoparticles have a high surface area, making them ideal 
for immobilizing molecules, polymers, or biomaterials to produce 
composite materials with tailored surface properties. For instance, the 
modification of metal nanoparticles with pre-designed receptor units 
and assembly on surfaces could lead to improved electrochemical sen­
sors. Proper functionalization of nanoparticles can also allows the 
making of highly-selective and sensitive electroanalytical procedures. 
Eventually, amplifying labels of limited stability, such as liposomes or 
enzymes can be replaced with an equivalent or improved sensitivities 
with stable nanoparticles[4]. 
Nanosensors based on bulk nanostructured materials offer several 
benefits and drawbacks. Let’s explore them:  
• Benefits:  
1. Enhanced Sensitivity: Bulk nanostructured materials possess a high 
surface-to-volume ratio, which results in an increased number of 
active sites for sensing. This higher surface area enables the detection 
of lower concentrations of analytes, leading to improved sensitivity 
compared to conventional sensors.  
2. Improved Selectivity: Nanosensors based on bulk nanostructured 
materials can exhibit enhanced selectivity by modifying the surface 
chemistry or functionalizing the materials. This allows for specific 
interactions with target analytes, reducing interference from other 
substances and improving the accuracy of sensing.  
3. Faster Response Time: The reduced size and enhanced surface area of 
bulk nanostructured materials enable faster diffusion and interaction 
with analytes. As a result, nanosensors based on these materials can 
provide real-time or near real-time measurements, making them 
suitable for rapid detection applications.  
4. Miniaturization and Integration: Bulk nanostructured materials can 
be fabricated into miniature sensor devices. Their small size and 
compatibility with microfabrication techniques enable the integra­
tion of multiple sensors onto a single chip. This miniaturization and 
integration facilitate portability, cost-effectiveness, and the devel­
opment of sensor arrays for multi-analyte detection.  
5. Versatility: Bulk nanostructured materials can be engineered with a 
wide range of properties and functionalities. By tailoring the 
composition, structure, and surface properties, nanosensors can be 
designed to detect various analytes, including gases, chemicals, 
biomolecules, and even specific types of nanoparticles.  
• Drawbacks: 
1. Fabrication Challenges: The synthesis and fabrication of bulk nano­
structured materials can be complex and require specialized tech­
niques. Achieving a high degree of control over the material 
structure and properties can be challenging, which may limit the 
scalability and commercial viability of these sensors.

be expensive and time-consuming. Additionally, the use of certain 
rare or exotic materials in their synthesis may further increase the 
cost of production. These factors can limit the widespread adoption 
of nanosensors based on bulk nanostructured materials, particularly 
in cost-sensitive applications.  
4. Standardization and Quality Control: Due to the evolving nature of 
bulk nanostructured materials and their fabrication techniques, 
standardization and quality control measures can be lacking. 
M. Khazaei et al.

different batches or manufacturers can be a concern, hindering 
widespread adoption in certain industries.  
5. Potential Toxicity: While many bulk nanostructured materials have 
been extensively studied for their safety, it is essential to consider the 
potential toxicity of certain nanoparticles. Some nanosensors based 
on bulk nanostructured materials may contain elements or com­
pounds that can be harmful to humans or the environment. Proper 
risk assessment and mitigation strategies should be implemented to 
ensure safe usage. 
Overall, nanosensors based on bulk nanostructured materials hold 
significant promise for a wide range of applications, but challenges 
related to fabrication, stability, cost, standardization, and safety need to 
be addressed for their successful integration into various industries and 
everyday life. 
1.4.5. Nanosensors based on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) 
MOFs are organic-inorganic hybrid crystalline porous materials that 
are composed of a regular array of positively charged metal ions sur­
rounded by organic ‘linker’ molecules. The metal ions form nodes that 
connect the linkers’arms to create a repeating, cage-like structure. Since 
MOFs have hollow structures, they have an extraordinary amount of 
internal surface area, making them ideal for gas sensing. Researchers 
can produce materials that selectively absorb particular gases into 
custom-made pockets within the structure by constructing the MOF from 
various metal atoms and organic linkers[9]. 
Nanosensors based on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offer 
several benefits and drawbacks. Here are some of them:  
• Benefits:  
1. High surface area: MOFs have an exceptionally high surface area due 
to their porous structure, providing a large number of active sites for 
sensing. This high surface area allows for enhanced sensitivity and 
detection of analytes.  
2. Tailorable properties: MOFs can be easily synthesized with tunable 
properties such as pore size, composition, and functionality. This 
flexibility enables the design of nanosensors specific to a wide range 
of target analytes, enhancing their selectivity and sensitivity.  
3. Versatile analyte detection: MOF-based nanosensors can detect 
various analytes including gases, ions, small molecules, and bio­
molecules. This versatility makes them suitable for applications in 
environmental monitoring, healthcare diagnostics, and chemical 
sensing.  
4. Signal amplification: MOFs can act as amplifiers by selectively 
capturing target analytes and concentrating them in their pores. This 
property can enhance the sensor’s signal response, improving the 
detection limits and overall sensitivity.  
5. Stability and recyclability: MOFs exhibit high stability, making them 
suitable for repeated use and recycling. This characteristic is bene­
ficial for the development of reusable nanosensors, reducing costs 
and environmental impact.  
• Drawbacks:  
1. MOF degradation: Some MOFs may exhibit instability under certain 
environmental conditions, such as exposure to high humidity or 
extreme pH levels. This can limit their long-term functionality and 
reliability as nanosensors. 
2. Slow response time: The diffusion of analytes into the porous struc­
ture of MOFs can lead to slower response times compared to other 
sensing platforms. This characteristic may hinder their application in 
scenarios requiring real-time or rapid detection.  
3. Fabrication challenges: The synthesis and fabrication of MOF-based 
nanosensors can be complex and time-consuming. Achieving 
uniform and controlled growth of MOF films or integrating MOFs 
onto sensor platforms can present technical challenges, potentially 
limiting their scalability.  
4. Interference and selectivity: While MOFs can offer high selectivity, 
they may also exhibit interference from other molecules present in 
the sample matrix. The design and optimization of MOFs for specific 
analytes can be challenging, requiring careful consideration of po­
tential interferences.  
5. Cost considerations: Some MOF materials, particularly those based 
on rare or expensive metals, can be costly to produce. This factor may 
impact the scalability and commercial viability of MOF-based 
nanosensors for certain applications. 
It’s worth noting that research and development in the field of MOF- 
based nanosensors are ongoing, and efforts are being made to address 
some of the drawbacks mentioned above. Continued advancements in 
MOF design, fabrication techniques, and integration strategies are ex­

applications. 
2. Applications of nanosensors in the early diagnosis of cancer 
Nanosensor technology is being researched for its potential medical 
applications in various areas including diagnosis, for example, antibi­
otics, hormones, DNA, antibodies, disease markers, and others; investi­
gating biomolecular interactions and biochemical assays including 
nucleic acids, enzyme assays, proteins, antigen–antibodies, and drug 
carriers; gas monitoring; and others. This review aims to provide in­
formation on the different applications of nanosensors in the early 
diagnosis of cancer. 
2.1. Cancer detection 
According to the World Cancer Report from the World Health Or­
ganization (WHO) and other key statistics, cancer is a leading cause of 
death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020. In 
2020, the following new cases of cancer were most prevalent:  
• Breast (2.26 million cases);  
• Lung (2.21 million cases);  
• Colon and rectum (1.93 million cases);  
• Prostate (1.41 million cases);  
• Skin (non-melanoma) (1.20 million cases); and  
• Stomach (1.09 million cases). 
The leading causes of cancer deaths in 2020 were:  
• Lung (1.80 million deaths);  
• Colon and rectum (916,000 deaths);  
• Liver (830,000 deaths);  
• Stomach (769,000 deaths); and  
• Breast (685,000 deaths)[10]. 
By identifying cancer early, it is more likely to respond to treatment, 
resulting in a better chance of survival as well as a lower cost of treat­
ment. Early detection of cancer and avoiding delays in treatment can 
significantly improve the lives of cancer patients[10]. 
Implementing evidence-based strategies for early diagnosis, cancer 
prevention, and management of patients with the disease can help to 
reduce and control cancer. However, there is extensive knowledge about 
the reasons for cancer, preventing, and managing the disease, and only a 
few significant improvements have been made in curing the disease. It 
has been proven that early detection is the only way to improve quality 
of life and life expectancy. For this purpose, nanosensors and highly 
sensitive nanomaterial-based devices have been developed to detect 
circulating tumor cells (CTCs), biomarkers, or tumor-derived vesicles 
M. Khazaei et al.

which are released comparatively early from the tumor into the blood 
which will make a significant change in the morbidity and morality of 
the disease[11]. 
2.1.1. Lung cancer 
Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in 
the world, making up almost 25% of all cancer deaths. A greater number 
of people die from lung cancer each year than from prostate, breast, or 
colon cancer combined. This situation is mainly because of the late stage 
of diagnosis. Unfortunately, traditional screening methods such as low- 
dose computed tomography (LDCT) and chest radiography (CXR) have 
been indicated to be ineffective in directly detecting lung tumors before 
spreading and become incurable. For example, the obtained images from 
CT often display many small lung nodules and at a very early stage, it’s 
not easy to realize which of these nodules are lung cancer and which are 
benign. Consequently, it’s still necessary to take a biopsy from the 
abnormal tissue to finally detect cancer which is complicated, incon­
venient, expensive, and can lead to morbidity and even mortality 
because of bleeding[12]. 
2.1.1.1. The biomarkers and detection targets for Lung cancer. Lung 
cancer is a complex disease, and several biomarkers and detection tar­
gets have been identified to aid in its diagnosis and monitoring. Here are 
some commonly studied biomarkers and detection targets for lung 
cancer:  
1. Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA): CEA is a glycoprotein that can be 
elevated in the blood of individuals with lung cancer. It is used as a 
tumor marker for various cancers, including lung cancer.  
2. Cytokeratin Fragment 21–1 (CYFRA 21-1): CYFRA 21-1 is a soluble 
fragment of cytokeratin 19, and its levels can be measured in blood 
samples. Elevated levels of CYFRA 21-1 are associated with lung 
cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
3. Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE): NSE is an enzyme found predomi­
nantly in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. Increased levels of NSE 
in blood can indicate the presence of small cell lung cancer (SCLC).  
4. Progastrin-Releasing Peptide (ProGRP): ProGRP is a precursor of 
gastrin-releasing peptide and is found at elevated levels in the blood 
of individuals with SCLC. It is used as a biomarker for the diagnosis 
and monitoring of SCLC. 
5. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutations: EGFR muta­
tions are genetic alterations commonly found in lung adenocarci­
noma. Testing for these mutations is essential for targeted therapy 
selection, as certain EGFR inhibitors are effective against tumors 
with specific mutations.  
6. Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) Rearrangements: ALK gene 
rearrangements occur in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. Identi­
fying ALK rearrangements helps in selecting patients who may 
benefit from targeted therapies that inhibit the ALK fusion protein.  
7. Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Expression: PD-L1 is a protein 
expressed on the surface of cancer cells. Testing for PD-L1 expression 
helps in determining the eligibility of patients for immunotherapy 
with immune checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab or 
nivolumab.  
8. Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs): CTCs are cancer cells that detach 
from the primary tumor and enter the bloodstream. Detection and 
characterization of CTCs can provide valuable information about the 
presence and progression of lung cancer.  
9. Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA): ctDNA refers to small fragments of 
tumor DNA released into the bloodstream. Analysis of ctDNA allows 
for non-invasive monitoring of genetic alterations and treatment 
response in lung cancer patients. 
It’s important to note that the availability and utility of specific 
biomarkers and detection targets may vary depending on the type and 
stage of lung cancer, as well as individual patient characteristics. 
Healthcare professionals rely on a combination of clinical evaluation, 
imaging tests, and laboratory analyses to diagnose and manage lung 
cancer effectively. 
In the last decade, researchers have worked on developing different 
kinds of nanosensors for the early detection of lung cancer. MicroRNAs 
(miRNAs) are highly conserved and tiny noncoding RNAs that regulate 
gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by binding to the 3′-UTR 
of target mRNAs. A growing body of evidence indicates that they play a 
crucial role in various pathological processes, including human cancer. 
Anran Gao et al.[13] used silicon nanowire field-effect (SiNW-FET) de­
vices to develop multiplexed electrical detection of lung cancer bio­
markers. The SiNW arrays were fabricated by an anisotropic wet etching 
technology using self-stop limitation and integrated with poly­
dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chips with mass reproducible ability and low- 
cost character. The nanosensors could sensitively and rapidly detect as 
low as 0.1 fM lung cancer biomarker miRNA−126 and 1 fg/ml carcino 
embryonic antigen (CEA) with good specificity. The ability of the 
nanosensors was investigated in both ideal and clinically relevant 
samples and they demonstrated high performance in detecting lung 
cancer. Jesse D. Kirkpatrick et al.[14] used activity-based nanosensors 
for the urinary detection of lung cancer in mice via noninvasive pul­
monary protease profiling. The multiplexed nanosensors performed 
with sensitivity up to 95% and specificity of 100% for the diagnosis of 
localized disease in two autochthonous human lung adenocarcinoma 
(LUAD) models representing Kras/Trp53 and Alk-mutant disease. 
Zhuang Hao et al.[15] designed an electrolyte-gated graphene field 
effect transistor (GFET) nanosensor using aptamer for the rapid, highly 
sensitive, and specific detection of a lung cancer biomarker interleukin-6 
(IL-6) with enhanced selectivity and stability. First, they examined the 
capability of the nanosensors in measuring the IL-6 concentration and 
whether the nanosensors could respond to the change in IL-6 concen­
tration in <10 min. Then, they investigated the stability of the nano­
sensors by storing the nanosensors in a 1× PBS buffer for 24 h and they 
were still capable of fast detecting IL-6. Finally, the high specificity of 
the nanosensors to IL-6 over non-target molecules was verified. Tumor 
cells that split away from the primary tumor and extravasate into and 
circulate through the bloodstream are called Circulating tumor cells 
(CTCs). 
Understanding the metastatic cascade of CTCs has tremendous po­
tential for the identification of targets against cancer metastasis. Chris­
topher M. Earhart et al.[16] developed a magnetic sifter, which is a 
small microfluidic chip with a dense array of magnetic pores labeled 
with magnetic nanoparticles that showed a high-efficiency detection of 
tumor cells. 
Hypoxia is mainly known as one of the substantial features in most 
cancers including NSCLC. Yantao Li et al.[9] suggested O2 concentration 
sensors monitor NSCLC excited by near-infrared (NIR) light to eliminate 
the negative effect of UV or visible light, based on the fact that Infrared 
light penetrates deeply into tissues, damages minimally and has a high 
spatial resolution. They used biological metal-organic frameworks (bio- 
MOFs) as the matrix. Then they fabricated a core/satellite nano­
structure, where many upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) were 
attached as antennas onto the surfaces of bio-MOFs including O2 in­
dicators. These nanosensors could successfully track in vivo NSCLC le­
sions without long-term biotoxicity. 
Ann-Katrine Jakobsen et al. [17] used nanosensors to investigate the 
TOP1 (Topoisomerase I) and TDP1 (Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1) 
activities in cryosections from NSCLC tissue samples which were 
collected at Aarhus University Hospital in 2011 including 24 paired 
tissue samples (one adjacent non-tumor and one tumor sample from 
each patient). Their results showed that both TOP1 and TDP1 were 
upregulated in the tumor tissue compared to the adjacent non-tumor 
tissue in NSCLC. Eisa Zarepour et al.[18] proposed a method to design 
a terahertz Wireless NanoSensor Network (WNSN) for monitoring 
human lung cells and they also showed that there is a temporal sweet 
M. Khazaei et al.

spot in the respiration cycle that can be used to reduce the transmission 
power of nanosensors. In this study, an online algorithm is proposed to 
estimate the sweet spots and periodic channel that allows a high power 
reduction. 
The calpain protein is a calcium-dependent, non-lysosomal cysteine 
protease (proteolytic enzyme) found ubiquitously in mammals and 
many other organisms. One of the major isoforms of calpain is Calpain 2 
(CAPN2). CAPN2 has been proposed as a tumor marker linked to 
angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and migration in NSCLC. Seung-Hae 
Kwon et al.[19] designed a human serum albumin-based active cal­
pain 2-triggered nanosensor (HSA −
CAPN2) for early detection of 
CAPN2 in tumor tissues. The results of in vivo and in vitro experiments 
showed that the HSA −CAPN2 could be effective too for early detection 
and potential drug carrier to active CAPN2-enriched cancer. 
Human exhaled breath contains >3000 VOCs, these VOCs are 
directly or indirectly related to internal biochemical processes in the 
body. Using electronic noses (E-noses) could be a potential way to 
screen/analyze systemic diseases and various respiratory by studying 
the signatures of breath. Silvano Dragonieria et al.[20] used a Cyranose 
320 containing a nanocomposite array with 32 polymer sensors as E- 
nose and their study demonstrated that an E-nose can discriminate pa­
tients with lung cancer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) patients. S. Chatterjee et al.[21] developed an E-nose by the 
assembly of conductive polymer nanocomposite (CPC) quantum resis­
tive sensors (QRS). The sensors developed in this study appeared to be 
great candidates for the detection of lung cancer by VOC analysis in 
breath with a sensitivity of 2.5 ppm, low consumption, a couple of 
seconds response time, and a large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR ≥10). 
Andras Bikov et al.[22] investigated the effects of expiratory flow rate, 
breath hold, and inclusion of anatomic dead space on the exhaled levels 
of some volatile compounds and electronic nose data. 27 patients with 
lung cancer (60 ± 10 years) and 37 healthy subjects (44 ± 14 years) 
participated in the study. Breath-hold, the inclusion of anatomic dead 
spaces, and expiratory flow rate all significantly altered “breathprints” 
in healthy individuals (p < 0.05), but not in lung cancer patients (p >
0.05). These factors also significantly affected the discrimination ability 
of the electronic nose in the detection of lung cancer. According to G. 
Peng et al.[23] and Orna Barash[24] et al., gold nanoparticles (GNPs) 
sensors can distinguish between breath VOCs of healthy individuals and 
those from lung cancer patients. Nam-Hoon Kim et al.[25] introduced 
highly selective and sensitive sensors using Pd-functionalized WO3 
nanofibers (NFs). First, they synthesized WO3 NFs by electrospinning 
method, and then Pd catalysts were loaded inside and/or outside of the 
WO3 NFs. Catalytic Pd-loaded WO3 NFs showed a good response time in 
a humid condition which makes them suitable to be used in exhaled 
breath sensors to detect toluene. Consequently, the Pd-added WO3 NFs 
are applicable for use in exhaled breath sensors for the detection of lung 
cancer. 
F.L. Liu et al.[26] presented a highly selective SWNTs biosensor to 
detect both polar and nonpolar VOCs molecules. To develop this sensor, 
pentadecane (C15H32) and tricosane (C23H48) were coated on the surface 
of SWNTs. The prepared device was exposed to representative VOCs 
nonpolar molecule decane and polar molecule 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene 
which are two lung cancer biomarkers. The results showed that the 
functionalized-SWNTs had a noticeable sensitivity towards VOCs mol­
ecules and exhibit a higher selectivity towards polar VOCs biomarkers. 
Nisreen Shehada et al.[27] used a modified SiNW FET to detect many 
diseases including lung cancer, asthma, gastric cancer, and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease. The best obtained sensors were exam­
ined under real-world clinical conditions using breath samples from 374 
patients. The results showed that the SiNW FETs could distinguish and 
detect between almost all comparisons with >80% accuracy. Alaa 
Gharra et al.[28] used a nanosensor-array system including layers of 
GNPs for the detection of lung and gastric cancers. 545 breath samples 
from 426 adult participants (158 lung cancer patients, 115 gastric 
cancer patients, and 153 healthy volunteers) were collected at the 
Jiangyin Hospital. 
Applications of nanosensors in the early detection of lung cancer are 
also summarized in Table 1. 
In lung cancer detection, electrochemical methods can detect spe­
cific lung cancer biomarkers in breath or blood samples, aiding in early 
diagnosis and monitoring of treatment response. Fluorescence tech­
niques enable targeted imaging of lung cancer cells or tumor markers, 
assisting in precise localization and staging. Image-based methods assist 
in analyzing lung images to detect tumors, assess their size and location, 
and guide treatment planning. 
2.2. Breast cancer 
Globally, there were 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast can­
cer in 2020 and 685,000 deaths. The number of women diagnosed with 
breast cancer in the past five years reached 7.8 million at the end of 
2020, making it the most prevalent cancer in the world. At the end of 
2020, breast cancer was the most prevalent cancer in the world, with 7.8 
million women alive and having been diagnosed in the past 5 years. 
Globally, breast cancer causes more disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) for women than any other form of cancer. In every country of 
the world, breast cancer can occur at any age after puberty, but it is more 
prevalent in older women. 
2.2.1. The biomarkers and detection targets for Breast cancer 
Breast cancer biomarkers and detection targets are important tools in 
the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of breast cancer. Here are some 
commonly used biomarkers and detection targets for breast cancer: 
1. Estrogen Receptor (ER): ER is a hormone receptor that helps deter­
mine whether a breast cancer tumor is hormone receptor-positive or 
hormone receptor-negative. ER-positive tumors can be treated with 
hormone therapies that target this receptor.  
2. Progesterone Receptor (PR): Similar to ER, PR is a hormone receptor 
that helps classify breast cancer tumors as hormone receptor-positive 
or hormone receptor-negative. PR-positive tumors may respond to 
hormone therapies.  
3. Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2): HER2 is a 
protein that plays a role in cell growth and division. Overexpression 
or amplification of HER2 is associated with aggressive breast cancer. 
HER2-positive breast cancers can be treated with targeted therapies 
like trastuzumab (Herceptin).  
4. Ki-67: Ki-67 is a protein that indicates the level of cell proliferation or 
growth. It is used as a marker to determine the growth rate of breast 
cancer cells and is often associated with a more aggressive disease.  
5. BRCA1 and BRCA2: BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that are associated 
with an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Mutations in 
these genes are often found in hereditary breast and ovarian cancers 
and may influence treatment decisions.  
6. CA 15–3 and CA 27.29: These are tumor-associated antigens that can 
be measured in the blood. Elevated levels of these antigens may 
indicate the presence of breast cancer and can be used for monitoring 
disease progression or treatment response. 
7. Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs): CTCs are cancer cells that have de­
tached from the primary tumor and entered the bloodstream. 
Detection and analysis of CTCs can provide valuable information 
about disease progression, metastasis, and treatment response.  
8. Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA): ctDNA refers to fragments of tumor 
DNA that are released into the bloodstream. Analysis of ctDNA can 
provide information about tumor genetic mutations, treatment 
response, and minimal residual disease.  
9. Mammographic Density: Mammographic density refers to the 
amount of fibrous and glandular tissue compared to fatty tissue in the 
breast. High mammographic density is associated with an increased 
risk of breast cancer and can be used as a risk assessment tool. 
M. Khazaei et al.

Yu Chen et al.[6] used a nanoscale-gated biological field effect 
transistor for the detection of the breast cancer serum biomarker protein 
CA15.3 down to levels of concentration <20 units/ml. They used a “top- 
up” method to fabricate the nanoscale biosensor with complete control 
of the geometry by lithography and standard semiconductor processing 
techniques in a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)- 
compatible process. The nanowires were functionalized with CA15.3 
and 3-aminopropyl- triethoxysilane (APTES) was used to silanize the 
device. 
The chemical energy needed to power the cell’s biochemical re­
actions is mainly produced by a type of membrane-bound cell organelles 
known as mitochondria. This energy is stored in adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) which is a small molecule. 
Wrong functioning of mitochondria can result in many diseases, such 
as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, Leigh syndrome, lactic acidosis, 
hepatopathy, stroke-like episodes, tubulopathy, and cancer. Therefore, 
understanding the relationship between mitochondrial pH (pHm), tu­
moral metabolism, and cancer is very important. Consuelo Ripoll et al. 
[40] designed a nanosensor with a double modification of the quantum 
dot (QD) surface. On the one hand, the surface of the QD surface was 
modified with mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) which affects the photo­
luminescence (PL) lifetime of the QDs. On the other hand, for specific 
mitochondrial delivery, Szeto-Schiller (SS) peptides were added to the 
surface. This nanosensor was used to correctly measure the intra­
mitochondrial pH using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy 
(FLIM) that can serve as a potential biomarker for the early detection of 
different metabo phenotypes in breast cancer cell lines. 
Yu-Husan Kuo et al.[41] developed a CMOS-based capacitive nano- 
biosensor for the first time for early detection of miRNA-195, as the 
breast cancer-specific biomarker in blood. They combined CMOS inte­
grated circuits and an interdigitated electrode (IDE) as a nano-sensor. 
The advantages of this nanosensor are compactness, miniaturization, 
high specificity, and high sensitivity. Their results showed that the limit 
of detection (LOD) could be as low as 0.617 fM proving that the nano­
sensor had high specificityand high sensivity and could be a good option 
for early detection of breast cancer. 
Due to its superior temporal and spatial resolution, optical fluores­
cence imaging is one of the most widely used methods for imaging in 
vivo. Because it is non-invasive and real-time, this approach is a desir­
able imaging modality for medical applications like biosensing, cancer 
diagnostics, and medical testing. The vast majority of fluorescence 
probes, which are necessary for optical fluorescence imaging, are visible 
(400–700 nm). When imaging inside the body, visible light has several 
limitations, though. The opacity of biological components including 
hemoglobin and water increases as they absorb light within the visible 
range. Additionally, due to the scattering of visible light caused by these 
elements within biological tissue, the penetration depth of visible 
fluorophores is decreased. Additionally, biological tissues exhibit self- 
fluorescence (also known as autofluorescence) in the visible range due 
to the presence of several luminous macromolecules that affect any 
images that are captured. Light scattering and autofluorescence are 
diminished by NIR light because biological components in tissue absorb 
it less. As a result, research into developing fluorescent probes that emit 
in the NIR has increased. NIR–I, or the first NIR optical window, in­
cludes wavelengths between 700 and 950 nm. The second NIR optical 
window, or NIR-II, covers the wavelength range of 1000 nm to 1700 nm. 
The attenuation coefficient of biological elements falls even lower 
within this range, lowering the opacity of tissue and the quantity of light 
scattering within it. Biological tissue’s autofluorescence is likewise 
decreased by the NIR-II wavelength range, which has better picture 
quality and a deeper penetration depth than visible light and NIR–I. 
Research on NIR-II fluorescence probes is currently being hampered by 
the lack of readily available probe material and the high cost of imaging 
equipment. 
In the research of Mingming Luan et al.[42], a multicolor fluorescent 
nanoprobe based on AuNPs was designed and synthesized for simulta­
neously and visually detecting breast cancer cells’ proliferation marker 
Ki-67 mRNA and invasion marker urokinase plasminogen activator 
(uPA) (Fig. 1). The fluorescence responses of the nanoprobe to Ki-67 and 
uPA targets were examined to experiment with the ability of the 
nanoprobe to simultaneously detect the respective targets. The

fluorescence recovery and kinetic profile were observed and the 
nanoprobe could respond rapidly to the DNA targets in 10 min and uPA 
targets in 30 min (Fig. 2). The feasibility of the nanoprobe to detect Ki- 
67 mRNA and uPA in vivo was evaluated with the fluorescent imaging of 
the xenograft mouse models injected with the nanoprobe after the mice 
were treated with curcumin and tamoxifen and the results demonstrated 
that the nanoprobe was a convenient and reliable way to screen anti­
tumor drugs. 
Squaraine dyes are a class of organic dyes showing intense fluores­
cence, typically in the red and NIR region. Squaraines typically include 
two electron donors and an electron-accepting squaric acid in a 
donor−acceptor−donor (D −A −D) structure. Defan Yao et al.[43] used 
a molecular engineering strategy to develop squaraine dyes with NIR-II 
emission. The squaraine dye SQ1 can be encapsulated as SQ1 nanoprobe 
through facile nanoprecipitation and targeting peptide decoration, 
which shows NIR-II/PA bimodal imaging capabilities and favorable 
photothermal effects. NIR-II imaging in mice showed that the SQ1 
nanoprobe was suitable for tumor-targeting and imaging angiography. 
Furthermore, in both PA imaging and PTT of solid tumors, the SQ1 
nanoprobe achieved excellent photothermal conversion under NIR 
irradiation. 
Due to the intrinsic advantages in both photothermal therapy and 
NIR-II/PA bimodal imaging, the SQ1 nanoprobe possesses good appli­
cation potential in the theranostics of breast cancer and lung metastasis 
(Fig. 2). 
Nuno Ferreira et al.[44] introduced a label-free nanosensor for the 
early detection of breast cancer. In this study, nata de coco was used to 
produce bacterial nanocellulose (BC) membrane, and then silver nano­
particles were in-situ-synthesized into BC as Surface-enhanced Raman 
spectroscopy (SERS) substrates. To examine the synthesized composites 
as SERS substrates, R6G was used as a test molecule. Rhodamine 6G 
(R6G) concentrations as low as 10−11 M were detected using enhance­
ment factors of 104 to 10.5 Exosome samples from breast cancer cell 
cultures MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A (nontumorigenic breast epithe­
lium) were evaluated on the synthetic substrates, and the resulting 
Raman spectra were subjected to statistical principal component anal­
ysis (PCA). A low-cost, green, label-free diagnosis method with prom­
ising applicability in the clinical diagnosis of breast cancer was 
developed by combining PCA with Raman intravariability and inter­
variability in exosomal samples. Using real-time in situ imaging of MMP- 
2 and uPA, Renhui et al. [45] constructed a fluorescent nanoprobe using 
a gold‑selenium (Au–Se) bond to assess the invasive potential of breast 
cancer cells. 
They functionalized Au NPs with two different selenol-modified 
short peptide chains via Au–Se bond formation. The other end of the 
peptide chains was labeled with rhodamine B (RhB) and fluorescein 
isothiocyanate (FITC), respectively. In the bound state, the two dyes 
were quenched by Au NPs. In the presence of uPA and MMP-2, the 
peptide chain labeled with RhB and the peptide chain labeled with FITC 
could be specifically cleaved by uPA and MMP-2, respectively, trig­
gering fluorescence recovery. Compared with the Au–S nanoprobe, the 
Au–Se nanoprobe possessed better resistance to glutathione (GSH) 
interference, making the imaging results more reliable. 
Ping Zhou et al.[46] developed a two-color nanoprobe based on Au 
NPs to screen the influence of different nutrient and oxygen conditions 
on the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells by detecting the 
changes in MMP-2 and RAB-22a mRNA levels in living cells. This probe 
included Au NPs and two molecular beacons (MBs) labeled with two 
different dye molecules. To detect RAB-22a mRNA and MMP-2 mRNA, 
DNA1, and DNA2 were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (MB-RAB-22a) and 
Cy5 (MB-MMP-2), respectively. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (human 
breast cancer cell lines) were incubated with different concentrations of 
oxygen and nutrients, and then fluorescence imaging assays were used 
to evaluate invasion and migration. 
Leila Eskandari et al.[47] prepared DNA-functionalized AuNPs as the 
target-specific probes, for detecting RNA of activated leukocyte cell 
adhesion molecule (ALCAM) gene which is a detectable biomarker in the 
tumor of patients with breast cancer. Their result showed the detection 
of different concentraions of ALCAM target by the nanoprobes and the 
LOD of the method corresponded to 300 fmol/mL of synthetic ALCAM 
target which proves the method had a high sensitivity. Mohammad 
Keshtkar et al.[48] designed a nanoprobe with conjugation of AS1411 
aptamer on the surface of Fe3O4@Au nanoparticles using the gold–sulfur 
chemistry for specific targeting of mouse mammary carcinoma (4 T1). 
Thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay of 4 T1 and HFFF-PI6 cells was used 
to assess in vitro cytotoxicity of the nanoprobe. For 4 T1 cells, at a 
concentration of 60 μg/mL, the nanoprobe had cytotoxicity effects, at 
concentrations from 10 to 45 μg/mL, cell toxicity was low or moderate. 
MTT results for HFFF-PI6 cells showed that up to 60 μg/mL, the 
nanoprobe had no cytotoxicity effects. 
The cluster determinant 44 (CD44) antigen is a cell-surface glyco­
protein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration. 
In humans, CD44, which is a receptor for hyaluronic acid and can also 
interact with other ligands, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 
collagens, and osteopontin, is encoded by the CD44 gene in 
Chromosome. 
Variations in CD44 are reported as cell surface markers for some 
breast and prostate cancer stem cells. In breast cancer research CD44+/ 
CD24- expression is commonly used as a marker for breast cancer stem 
cells (CSCs) and is used to sort breast cancer cells into a population

enriched in cells with stem-like characteristics15 and has been seen as 
an indicator of increased survival time in epithelial ovarian cancer pa­
tients. In women with endometriosis, Endometrial cells show greater 
expression of splice variants of CD44 and enhanced adhesion to peri­
toneal cells. 
Eunjung Kim et al.[49] used hyaluronic acid (HA)-based nano­
containers containing miR-34a beacons (bHNCs) to design a smart 
nanoprobe, which is used for the intracellular recognition of miR-34a 
levels in metastatic breast cancer (Fig. 3). These nanocontainers 
include 1) binding to CD44receptors, 2) internalization into an endo­
some, 3) disassembling under pH reduction, leading to the destabiliza­
tion of endosome membranes, and 4) finally displacement of miR-34a 
beacons from the nanocontainer permitting them to transport into the 
cytoplasm and bind intracellular miR-34a. Specifically, HA as a non­
immunogenic, nontoxic, and biodegradable biopolymer with a wide 
range of molecular weight (103 ~ 107 Da) has a high affinity for the cell 
surface adhesion molecule CD44. Since CD44 molecule is highly avail­
able in tumor cells with metastatic phenotype but hardly is seen in 
healthy tissue, is used as the determinant of progression to the meta­
static breast cancer. 
Table 2 also provides a summary of nanosensor applications in the 
early diagnosis of breast cancer. 
In breast cancer, electrochemical methods can detect specific bio­
markers in blood or tissue samples, aiding in early diagnosis and 
monitoring of treatment response. Fluorescence techniques enable tar­
geted imaging of breast cancer cells or tumor markers, assisting in 
precise localization and characterization. Image-based methods assist in 
analyzing mammograms and other breast images to detect tumors, 
assess their size, location, and guide treatment planning. 
2.3. Colorectal cancer 
Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as colon cancer, bowel cancer, 
or rectal cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum. 
2.3.1. The biomarkers and detection targets for Colorectal cancer 
In the case of colorectal cancer, several biomarkers and detection 
targets have been identified. Here are some commonly studied bio­
markers and detection targets for colorectal cancer:  
1. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA): CEA is a glycoprotein that is often 
elevated in patients with colorectal cancer. It can be measured in the 
blood and is used as a tumor marker to monitor disease progression 
and response to treatment.  
2. Fecal occult blood test (FOBT): This is a non-invasive screening test 
that detects the presence of hidden blood in the stool, which may be 
an indication of colorectal cancer or other gastrointestinal disorders. 
FOBT can be used as an initial screening tool, but it is not specific to 
colorectal cancer. 
3. DNA-based tests: Various DNA-based tests can be used to detect ge­
netic alterations associated with colorectal cancer. These include:  
a. Microsatellite instability (MSI): MSI is a condition characterized 
by the presence of alterations in the length of microsatellite DNA 
sequences. It occurs in a subset of colorectal cancers and can be 
detected using PCR-based tests.  
b. DNA methylation markers: DNA methylation is an epigenetic 
modification that can be altered in colorectal cancer. Specific 
DNA methylation markers, such as the methylated form of the 
SEPT9 gene, can be detected in the blood or stool samples and 
used as a screening tool.  
4. Immunohistochemistry (IHC): IHC involves the use of antibodies to 
detect specific proteins in tissue samples. In colorectal cancer, IHC 
can be used to assess the expression of proteins such as MLH1, MSH2, 
MSH6, and PMS2, which are associated with Lynch syndrome, a 
hereditary form of colorectal cancer.  
5. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA): ctDNA refers to small fragments of 
DNA released into the bloodstream by cancer cells. Detection and 
analysis of ctDNA can provide information about the genetic alter­
ations present in the tumor and can be used for monitoring disease 
progression and treatment response.

6. Other biomarkers: Several other biomarkers are being investigated 
for their potential role in colorectal cancer detection and monitoring. 
These include microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and specific pro­
teins like Guanylyl Cyclase C (GCC) and KRAS mutations. 
The main methods for diagnosis of colon cancer are serological 
markers, radiological techniques, endoscopy and biopsy. These strate­
gies have several advantages but they are not able to achieve very early 
diagnosis, which requires very sensitive and specific analytical methods. 
Based on a covalently modified anti-human epithelial cell adhesion 
molecule (EpCAM) antibody nanoparticle, Liang Tao et al. [104] created 
a sensitive and specific sensor for colon cancer colo205 cells combining 
fluorescence microscopy imaging and flow cytometer (FCM). They used 
NaIO4 oxidation and the conventional glutaraldehyde methods for the 
covalent immobilization of anti-EpCAM monoclonal antibodies onto 
core-shell silica nanoparticles. To compare these two methods, they used 
fluorescence microscopic imaging. Their result showed that the NaIO4 
oxidation approach preserves antibody activity better than the glutar­
aldehyde procedure. Their results also showed that the nanosensor could 
increase the signal intensity obviously and distinguish three kinds of 
target cells (colo205, sw480, and NCM460) well. 
Kelly E. van Keulen et al.[105] reported that VOCs in breath could 
potentially serve as a noninvasive diagnostic biomarker for the detection 
of advanced CRC and adenomas. They collected five hundred and eleven 
breath samples using an e-nose from adult colonoscopy patients, without 
inflammatory bowel disease or (previous) malignancy. 
Cytidine has been recognized as an early biomarker of colon cancer. 
Yuan Xiang et al.[106] developed a highly sensitive Fe3O4/Au/Ag5 NPs- 
based SERS method to determine cytidine in urine for screening colon 
cancer risk in an early stage. First, they removed urea using the adopted 
diazo chemical reaction because it would interfere Raman’s detection of 
cytidine. According to their result, the lowest detectable concentration 
of cytidine could reach 1 nM. 
Payal Gulati et al.[107] fabricated a genosensor using vertically- 
aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes (VA-MWCNTs)-based electrodes 
for an early diagnosis of CRC by targeting a specific DNA sequence, 
carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM5) 
which is a glycoprotein, a specific tumor marker for colorectal cancer. In 
this study, chemical vapor deposition was used to synthesize VA- 
MWCNTs and the nanotube patterns were transferred from solid Si/ 
SiO2 substrate to flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate by 
hot compress method. They also optimized the probe binding conditions 
and the electrode’s electrochemical condition to improve the efficiency 
of the genosensor. To investigate the hybridization event on the elec­
trode material, the cyclic voltammetry was obtained by changing the 
concentration of the target DNA and the sensor showed a LOD of 920 nM 
concentration of DNA. 
Ayemeh Bagheri Hashkavayi et al.[108] developed electrochemical 
aptasensor by fabricating an aptamer–cell–aptamer sandwich architec­
ture on an SBA-15-3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (SBA-15-pr-NH2) and 
AuNPs modified graphite screen printed electrode (GSPE) surface for the 
early diagnosis of CT26 cancer cells. In this study, SBA-15, a kind of 
mesoporous silica was synthesized and functionalized with 3-aminopro­
pyltriethoxysilane and AuNPs were electrochemically deposited on the 
SBA-15-pr-NH2 modified GSPE surface. The results of cyclic voltam­
metry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated that 
the nanosensor could detect CT26 cells in the concentration ranges of 
10–1.0 × 105 cells/ml and 1.0 × 105–6.0 × 106 cells/ml, respectively. 
Mucin-1 (MUC1), an essential transmembrane glycoprotein, was 
regarded as a promising biomarker for colon, breast, ovarian, and lung 
cancers and can strongly hybridize with aptamer DNA (aptDNA) of 
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA, generated by aptDNA and linked DNA (L- 
DNA)) to rerelease free L-DNA. In a study by Li-Yan Huang et,[37] 
altrimeric acid and 4,4-dipyridyl were used as the linking agent, to 
chelate Zn2+ with trimeric acid to form Zn-based metal-organic frame­
works with pyridine (Zn-Bp-MOFs), which were then aminated with 
APTES and finally grafted with zinc meso-tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl) 
porphine (Zn-TP) by sulfonamide bonds. This biosensor was used for 
detetction of MUC1 and showed a broad dynamic linear range (1 pg 
mL−1–10 ng/mL), the LOD down to 0.23 pg mL−1, excellent stability, 
and selectivity, as well as great recovery in the diluted serum samples. 
In colorectal cancer, electrochemical methods can detect specific 
biomarkers in blood or fecal samples, aiding in early diagnosis and 
monitoring of treatment response. Fluorescence techniques enable tar­
geted imaging of colorectal cancer cells or tumor markers, assisting in 
precise localization and staging. Image-based methods assist in 
analyzing colonoscopy or imaging studies to detect tumors, assess their 
size, location, and guide treatment planning. 
2.4. Other cancers 
Liver cancers are malign tumors that grow inside or on the surface of 
the liver. Liver tumors are discovered by medical imaging (often by 
accident) or present themselves symptomatically as abdominal pain, 
abdominal mass, nausea, jaundice, or liver dysfunction. It is important 
to distinguish liver cancers from liver metastases, which originate in 
another organ of the body and migrate to the liver. Liang Tao et al.[109] 
developed an ultrabright fluorescent mesoporous silica nanoparticle 
(FMSN) combined with anti- CD112 monoclonal antibodies and with 
anti-CD155 monoclonal antibodies by the NaIO4 oxidation method to 
detect liver cancer SMMC-7721 and HHCC cells, respectively. A three- 
step hydrolysis method was used to synthesize the FMSNs. Based on 
fluorescence microscopy imaging, modified FMSNs were able to clearly 
distinguish between CD112 and CD155 on the surface of liver cells. 
Furthermore, in vivo imaging in mice was used to evaluate the perfor­
mance of the modified FMSN and the results demonstrated that the 
nanosensors could target tumor tissue in mice. 
>238,000 patients are diagnosed with ovarian cancer worldwide, a 
disease that is responsible for >151,000 deaths each year. In the United 
States, this disease ranks top among gynecologic malignancies and is the 
sixth most common cause of cancer-related deaths in females. These 
terrible statistics are because the majority of cases are discovered at an

advanced stage. >60% of diagnoses are at stage III or later which is 
higher than any other form of cancer. The average 5-year survival rate 
across all populations is only 46%. If the diagnosis occurs at stage I, 
however, the 5-year survival rate is 92%. Current screening methods 
include transvaginal ultrasonography and cancer antigen 125 [CA-125 
or mucin 16 (MUC16)] serum testing. However, the U.S. Preventive 
Services Task Force recommends against these methods because of poor 
sensitivity, and high false-positive rates for detecting small lesions. 
These methods neither reduce mortality nor change the patient 
outcome. 
Patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) exhibit 
poor 5-year survival rates, which may be remarkably improved by early- 
stage diagnosis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved 
biomarkers for HGSC, HE4 (human epididymis protein 4) and CA-125 
(cancer antigen 125) do not generally appear at detectable levels in 
the serum until the advanced stages of the disease. Consequently, new 
methods are needed for early-stage detection to reduce the burden of 
ovarian cancer. In the research of Ryan M. Williams et al.[110], a carbon 
nanotube-based sensor to noninvasively detect the ovarian cancer 
biomarker HE4 in vivo was prepared (Fig. 4). SWCNTs was used to 
transduce the binding of HE4 to an immobilized antibody via modula­
tion of the intrinsic NIR emission of the nanotubes. The nanotube- 
antibody complexes could detect HE4 in ascites and serum from pa­
tients with ovarian cancer. 
Sibel Büyüktiryaki et al.[111] applied an imprinting method for the 
detection of CA 125. Methacryloyl antipyrine terbium (III) [(MAAP)2-Tb 
(III)] and methacryloyl antipyrine europium (III) [(MAAP)2-Eu(III)] 
were used as new metal-chelating monomers by metal coordination. To 
find CA 125, phosphoserine (PS) was used as a template. PS imprinted 
CNT and Fe2O3 nanoparticles (SPN) have cavities that are selective for 
CA 125. LOD of PS imprinted CNT nanosensor for PS and CA 125 were 
1.77 10−10 M and 0.49 UmL−1, respectively. The feasibility of the 
nanosensors for clinical applications has been investigated by spiked 
human serum samples with different concentrations of CA 125 (in pH 
7.4 PBS). 
Prostate cancer (CaP) is the third most common type of cancer in 
men with the age over 50 years and one of the major health concerns in 
the world. Screening and early diagnosis methods such as prostate- 
specific antigen (PSA) are one of the common methods to reduce the 
mortality rate of prostate cancer, but there is a need for improved bio­
markers that can identify aggressive disease. Zahra Akbari jonous et al. 
[112] designed an electrochemical biosensor for the detection of PSA 
using a sandwich-type electrode composed of anti-total PSA monoclonal 
antibody, reduced graphene oxide/ gold nanoparticles (RGO/AuNPs), 
and anti-free PSA antibody. The nanosensor showed excellent selectivity 
for PSA in comparison to the other tumor markers such as CEA, BHCG, 
CA125, Alb, and CA19–9. The LOD was 0.2 and 0.07 ng/mL for total and 
free PSA antigen, respectively. 
The work presented by Lingyun Xu et al.[113] developed a magneto- 
nanosensor (MNS) based multiplex assay to measure protein and auto­
antibody biomarkers from human serum for CaP diagnosis. They 
selected 4 candidate autoantibodies against 4 proteins (PARK7, 
TARDBP, TLN1, Talin 1, and CALD1) that were shown to be associated 
with CaP and paired them with total PSA (includes both complexed and 
uncomplexed forms) and free- PSA (uncomplexed to chaperone pro­
teins) to develop a panel for the detection of CaP. As a class of enzymes, 
proteases play a key role in every hallmark of cancer; their activity 
might be used as a biomarker. Jaideep S. Dudani et al.[114] designed an 
injectable activity-based nanosensors (ABNs) to measure protease ac­
tivity in vitro using in vivo urinary readouts and fluorescence. They 
applied this nanosesnor array in xenograft mouse models to classify 
aggressive CaP. 
Thyroid cancer incidence rates have increased rapidly worldwide in 
the past few decades in comparison with other types of cancers. The 
most common type of thyroid cancer is papillary thyroid carcinoma 
(PTC) followed by follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). While FTC ac­
counts for just 10%–15% of thyroid cancer cases, it is a more aggressive 
disease than PTC and is associated with poorer long-term patient sur­
vival, necessitating timely diagnosis and treatment. Epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) is a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor that is 
responsive to extracellular growth factors, regulating key oncogenic 
processes including survival, proliferation, migration, and metabolic 
activity. EGFR dysregulation is a hallmark of many cancer types 
including head, breast, neck, lung, and pancreatic cancer, and it is thus a 
valuable biomarker that can help discriminate between malignant and 
benign lesions. Importantly, FTC nodules exhibit increase EGFR 
expression relative to follicular thyroid adenoma (FTA) nodules. Yang 
Gui et al.[115] prepared a targeted affibody-Au-Tripod nanoprobe to 
facilitate the targeted photoacoustic imaging (PAI) of epidermal EGFR- 
positive cells and tumors in vivo in mice and yielded strong PA signals. 
Pancreatic cancer begins in the tissues of the pancreas, an organ in 
your abdomen behind the lower part of the stomach. In addition to 
assisting digestion, the pancreas releases hormones that regulate blood 
sugar level. Mingmin Wu et al.[116] designed a nanosensor for the 
detection of trypsin as a biomarker of pancreatic diseases or pancreatic 
cancer based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) be­
tween UCNP and AuNP. A trypsin-sensitive peptide DDDDARC was used 
to link UCNP and AuNP and form the non-fluorescent UCNP-peptide- 
AuNP nanosensor. The nanosensor showed great selectivity and sensi­
tivity for trypsin and its inhibitors with a LOD of 4.15 ng/mL for trypsin. 
Other applications of nanosensors in the detection of cancer bio­
markers are also summarized in Table 3.

3. Conclusions and future directions for nanosensors 
This study provides a summary of recent developments in cancer 
diagnostics using nanotechnology. The development of nanotechnology- 
based tests for cancer diagnosis has received a lot of attention over the 
past ten years. A variety of NP-based assays demonstrated improvements 
in terms of selectivity and sensitivity compared to the currently avail­
able cancer diagnostics in the clinic or provided completely new capa­
bilities that were not possible with conventional methods. By enabling 
early detection, these developments will increase the survival rate of 
cancer patients. These developments could also be used to track the 
growth of cancer and how it responds to therapy, which could aid in the 
creation of more effective cancer treatment plans. The last ten years 
have seen significant advancements in the field of nanotechnology- 
based cancer diagnostics, and our knowledge of it has grown signifi­
cantly. Nanotechnology-based cancer detection is about to enter the 
clinic, even though only a small number of NP-based assays have pro­
gressed to clinical trials. This is due to strong cooperation among re­
searchers, engineers, and physicians. Nanotechnology offers excellent 
prospects to enhance cancer diagnosis, which will ultimately increase 
the survival rate of cancer patients because of its high sensitivity, 
specificity, and multiplexing measuring capacity. In conclusion, the 
expanding field of study focused on the creation of nanodevices is 
having and will continue to have a major influence on the creation of 
nanosensors for the early detection of cancer and the monitoring of 
therapeutic drugs. Nanosensors have made significant advancements in 
various fields, including healthcare, environmental monitoring, and 
industrial applications. However, they still face several challenges that 
limit their widespread adoption. Here are some of the main challenges 
associated with current nanosensors and potential ways to improve 
them:  
• Sensitivity and Detection Limits: Enhancing the sensitivity and 
detection limits of nanosensors is crucial for detecting low concen­
trations of analytes. Improvements can be made by optimizing the 
choice of materials, developing novel transduction mechanisms, and 
exploring advanced signal amplification techniques.  
• Selectivity and Specificity: Nanosensors often encounter challenges 
in distinguishing between similar analytes or suppressing interfer­
ence from the sample matrix. Incorporating highly selective recog­
nition elements, such as specific biomolecules or functionalized 
nanoparticles, can improve selectivity and specificity.  
• Stability and Durability: Nanosensors should be stable and durable, 
especially in harsh environments or during long-term use. Re­
searchers can focus on developing robust nanomaterials, protective 
coatings, or encapsulation strategies to enhance the stability and 
lifespan of nanosensors.  
• Scalability and Cost-Effectiveness: Manufacturing nanosensors on a 
large scale with consistent performance and at a reasonable cost is a 
challenge. Streamlining fabrication processes, exploring scalable 
nanomaterial synthesis techniques, and leveraging economies of 
scale can help address these challenges. 
• Integration and Miniaturization: Integrating nanosensors into com­
plex systems or devices, and achieving miniaturization, is essential 
for their practical applications. Advances in microfabrication tech­
niques and nanomaterial integration methods can facilitate the 
seamless integration of nanosensors into various platforms.  
• Biocompatibility and Safety: In biomedical applications, ensuring 
the biocompatibility and safety of nanosensors is crucial. Conducting 
comprehensive toxicity studies and utilizing biocompatible materials 
are important steps towards addressing these concerns.  
• Power Supply and Energy Efficiency: Nanosensors often require a 
power source, and optimizing power supply and energy efficiency is 
essential for their long-term operation, especially in remote or 
implantable applications. Exploring low-power design strategies and 
energy harvesting techniques can help mitigate power-related 
challenges. 
• Data Handling and Interpretation: Nanosensors generate large vol­
umes of data, requiring efficient data handling, processing, and 
interpretation. Developing advanced algorithms, data analytics 
tools, and machine learning techniques can facilitate real-time 
analysis and extraction of meaningful information from nanosensor 
data.

• Standardization and Regulatory Frameworks: Establishing stan­
dardized protocols and regulatory frameworks for nanosensors is 
crucial for ensuring their reliability, reproducibility, and safety. 
Collaborative efforts among researchers, industry, and regulatory 
agencies can help in defining guidelines and standards for nano­
sensor development and deployment.  
• Real-World Integration: Bridging the gap between laboratory 
research and real-world applications remains a challenge. Collabo­
rations between academia, industry, and end-users can facilitate the 
translation of nanosensor technologies into practical solutions 
addressing specific societal needs. 
By addressing these challenges, researchers and engineers can 
continue to improve nanosensors, expanding their capabilities and 
enabling their broader adoption in various fields.
