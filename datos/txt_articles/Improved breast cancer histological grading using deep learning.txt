Background: The Nottingham histological grade (NHG) is a well-established prognostic factor for breast cancer that is
broadly used in clinical decision making. However, w50% of patients are classiﬁed as grade 2, an intermediate risk
group with low clinical value. To improve risk stratiﬁcation of NHG 2 breast cancer patients, we developed and
validated a novel histological grade model (DeepGrade) based on digital whole-slide histopathology images (WSIs)
and deep learning.
Patients and methods: In this observational retrospective study, routine WSIs stained with haematoxylin and eosin
from 1567 patients were utilised for model optimisation and validation. Model generalisability was further
evaluated in an external test set with 1262 patients. NHG 2 cases were stratiﬁed into two groups, DG2-high and
DG2-low, and the prognostic value was assessed. The main outcome was recurrence-free survival.
Results: DeepGrade provides independent prognostic information for stratiﬁcation of NHG 2 cases in the internal test
set, where DG2-high showed an increased risk for recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 2.94, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 1.24-
6.97, P ¼ 0.015) compared with the DG2-low group after adjusting for established risk factors (independent test data).
DG2-low also shared phenotypic similarities with NHG 1, and DG2-high with NHG 3, suggesting that the model identiﬁes
morphological patterns in NHG 2 that are associated with more aggressive tumours. The prognostic value of DeepGrade
was further assessed in the external test set, conﬁrming an increased risk for recurrence in DG2-high (HR 1.91, 95% CI
1.11-3.29, P ¼ 0.019).
Conclusions: The proposed model-based stratiﬁcation of patients with NHG 2 tumours is prognostic and adds clinically
relevant information over routine histological grading. The methodology offers a cost-effective alternative to molecular
proﬁling to extract information relevant for clinical decisions.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer histological grade is a well-established clinical
variable in breast cancer that comprises information from
three aspects, namely, the degree of tubule formation,
nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic counts. Compared with
other widely used prognostic factors that only consider a
single aspect such as age, tumour size or lymph node status,
histological grading takes both morphology and prolifera-
tion into consideration, and therefore contributes with
unique prognostic signiﬁcance and is broadly utilised in
clinical decision making.1,2 The most broadly adopted
grading classiﬁcation system is the Nottingham grading
system, modiﬁed by Elston and Ellis from the Bloome
Richardson grading system, and its prognostic value has
been validated in studies with varied populations.
A higher Nottingham histological grade (NHG) is associ-
ated with poor prognosis, and it is an indication for more
aggressive treatment, while lower grade indicates lower risk
of recurrence and allows for more conservative treat-
ment.3,4 However, grading is conducted manually by pa-
thologists and is associated with a substantial uncertainty
indicated by large interassessor variability.5-8 Previous
studies have found higher concordance in identifying the
most aggressive tumours (NHG 3), and lower concordance
in distinguishing between NHG 1 and 2 tumours.9,10
The intermediate group (NHG 2) accounts for approxi-
mately half of the patient population,11,12 but exhibits
larger variation with regard to morphological patterns and
survival outcomes13 in comparison with NHG 1 and 3. As
histological grade remains central in determining thera-
peutic regimens,14 the heterogeneity in the NHG 2 group

poses challenges for deciding optimal treatment for indi-
vidual patients. Therefore multiple approaches to address
these uncertainties, and to reduce both overtreatment and
undertreatment, have been proposed. Gene expression
proﬁling has been applied to dichotomise patients with
NHG 2 tumours into groups with different outcomes.13,15 It
has also been suggested that NHG 2 could be eliminated
altogether.16 Gene expression assays, including Oncotype
Dx and Prosigna, can predict risk of recurrence and death in
patients with intermediate risk tumours.17-19 However,
molecular
diagnostics
remain
expensive
and
time-
consuming
compared
with
histopathology-based
di-
agnostics for routine clinical applications.
The emergence of digital pathology20 and routine
acquisition of high-resolution whole-slide histopathology
images (WSIs) now enables application of advanced image
analysis in the standard clinical setting. Advances in artiﬁcial
intelligence have also opened up new opportunities for
histopathology image analysis using deep learning.21,22
Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently
been applied successfully for detection and pathological
classiﬁcation across multiple cancer types23-26 including
breast cancer.27,28 Deep CNNs offer cost-effective solutions
for improved cancer diagnostics based on routine histopa-
thology slide images.
In this study, we propose a novel deep learning-based
approach, DeepGrade, for histological grading of breast
cancers based on digitised haematoxylin and eosin (HE)-
stained WSIs, with a particular focus on improving prog-
nostic stratiﬁcation of NHG 2 tumours. The model was
developed for classiﬁcation of NHG 1 and NHG 3 morpho-
logical patterns, followed with restratiﬁcation of NHG 2
tumours using the learned patterns. The proposed model
was validated in independent internal and external test data
with respect to patient outcomes.
METHODS
Patients
The study comprises female patients with primary invasive
breast cancer as primary diagnosis from four different
studies and sites: ClinSeq breast cancer study (ClinSeq-
BC)15,29 (N ¼ 256), TCGA breast cancer study30 (TCGA-BC)
(N ¼ 559), SöS-BC-1 breast cancer cohort phase I (SöS-BC-1)
(N ¼ 752) and a subset of the SCAN-B study,31 consisting of
patients diagnosed in Lund (Sweden) (N ¼ 1262, external
test set) (Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.
org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.007).
ClinSeq-BC
includes
patients diagnosed in Stockholm South General Hospital in
2012 or had surgery between 2001 and 2008 at the Kar-
olinska University Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden); SöS-BC-1
is a retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed at the
Stockholm South General Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden)
between April 2012 and October 2014 and between
October 2015 and May 2018. SCAN-B enrolled patients
diagnosed as having primary invasive disease from 2010 to
2019; here we only include patients diagnosed in Lund
(Sweden). Clinical and imaging data from the Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) were
retrieved from the TCGA database and from pathology re-
ports with approval by the TCGA data access committee
(dbGAP projectID:5621). Clinical data for ClinSeq-BC, SöS-
BC-1 and SCAN-B cohorts were retrieved from the Swedish
National Breast Cancer Registry. HE-stained formalin-ﬁxed
parafﬁn-embedded
(FFPE)
histopathology
slides
from
resected tumours were digitised in-house for ClinSeq-BC,
SöS-BC-1 and SCAN-B. Available WSIs from TCGA-BC were
downloaded from https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/ in year
2019. Only WSIs that contained invasive cancer were
included. WSIs from patients treated with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and WSIs scanned at 20 were excluded.

(Supplementary Figures S1 and S2, available at https://doi.
org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.007). Only one WSI image is
included for each patient.
WSI preprocessing: overview
WSIs were tiled into tiles of 598  598 pixels with a down-
sampled resolution equivalent to 20  (271  271 mm). All
tiles were automatically quality controlled with respect to
sharpness. Colour normalisation was applied to adjust for
stain and scanner colour variability (Supplementary Figure S3,
available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.007).
Areas in slides containing invasive cancer, annotated by pa-
thologists or predicted by model, were included in analyses
(Supplementary Figure S4, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.annonc.2021.09.007, Supplementary Table S2, avail-
able at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.007).
Optimisation of the DeepGrade CNN model for histological
grade
Tumours of NHG 1 and NHG 3 from ClinSeq-BC, TCGA and
SöS-BC-1 were randomly split into training set (N ¼ 844,
70.6%), test set 1 (N ¼ 136, 11.4%) and test set 2 (N ¼ 215,
18.0%) on a patient level (Supplementary Table S3 and S4,
available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.007).
The training set was further split into training (N ¼ 674,
56.4%) and tuning set (N ¼ 170, 14.2%). For ClinSeq-BC, we
used the ground truth annotated by pathologists to extract
tiles within tumour regions; for TCGA-BC and SöS-BC-1, we
applied the trained invasive cancer detection model to
generate tumour regions and extract tiles from such regions
(Supplementary Figure S5, available at https://doi.org/
10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.007). Several CNN architectures
were evaluated in the tuning set (Supplementary Table S5,
available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.007).
The Inception V3 model32 demonstrated the best prediction
performance. As it is also widely adopted with overall
satisfactory performance for various prediction tasks in
previous studies,24,23 it was used in all of the base models in
the ensemble. Tiles in the training and tuning sets were
used to optimise the DeepGrade model, an ensemble
including 20 deep CNN base models (InceptionV3 model32
with weights initialised from a model pretrained by
ImageNet33) for classiﬁcation of NHG 1 and 3. By averaging

over a number of models in the ensemble, improvements in
prediction performance can be achieved by reduction of
variance. AUCs for each deep CNN model were summarised
in Supplementary Table S6, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.annonc.2021.09.007. Deep learning was performed
using the Keras (2.2.4) framework with TensorFlow (1.12)
backend.
Histological grade prediction by CNN models
Tile-level predicted class probabilities from the ensemble
were averaged. Slide-level predictions were based on the
upper quartile of the tile-level distribution for each slide.
Classiﬁcation performance was assessed by slide-level
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the
area under the curve (AUC) (‘pROC’ package in R). Boot-
strapping (2000 samples) was performed to estimate the
95% conﬁdence interval (CI) of AUC.34 Optimal threshold for
binary class label (NHG 1 and 3) assignment was deter-
mined by Youden’s method.35 Re-stratiﬁcation of NHG 2
tumours from ClinSeq-BC and TCGA-BC was achieved by
dichotomisation [DeepGrade 2 (DG2)-high or DG2-low] us-
ing the estimated classiﬁcation threshold.
Survival analysis and statistical tests
We analysed and compared recurrence-free survival (RFS)
rates among patients in clinically assigned histological
grades (NHG), as well as between NHG 2 tumours that
were predicted as high grade (DG2-high) and low grade
(DG2-low) by DeepGrade. Clinical outcome data were
available in ClinSeq-BC and TCGA-BC; survival analysis was
performed on these two data sources together. A recur-
rence event was deﬁned as having locoregional or distant
relapses, contralateral tumours or death. A death without
any detected metastasis was assumed to have experienced
a tumour metastasis before death.15,36 The time-to-event
period was deﬁned as the number of days between the
initial diagnosis date and the date of one of the following
events: local or regional relapse, distant metastasis, death
or last follow-up. KaplaneMeier curves were generated to
visualise survival outcomes between groups (R-packages
‘survminer’ and ‘survival’). Multivariate Cox proportional
hazards regression models were used to estimate adjusted
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CI (R function ‘coxph’ and R-
package ‘forestmodel’). Other risk factors included in the
model were age, tumour size, lymph node status, human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status and es-
trogen receptor (ER) status. Tumour size was dichotomised
into categories with tumour diameter 20 mm or <20
mm; lymph node status was dichotomised as having or not
having lymph node metastases; HER2 status was deter-
mined using immunohistochemical staining in conjunction
with FISH test (decided in clinical routine); ER status was
determined based on a 10% cut-off for positively stained
cells
by
immunohistochemical
staining.
Patients
with
missing data in any of the risk factors were excluded in the
multivariate Cox regression analysis. Patient characteristics
after
removing
missing
data
are
summarised
in
Supplementary Table S7, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.annonc.2021.09.007.
To compare differences in distribution for categorical
variables,
Fisher’s
exact test
or chi-square
test
was
employed depending on whether the minimum value in a
subgroup is smaller than 5. To test for difference in mean
age, the t-test was applied. To test for differences in Ki67
score, the ManneWhitney U test was used. The two-sided
P value was reported and a P value <0.05 was considered
as statistically signiﬁcant. Analyses were performed using R
(3.6.3).

RESULTS
A deep CNN ensemble model for discrimination between
NHG 1 and 3 tumours
An ensemble consisting of 20 deep CNN models for binary
classiﬁcation of NHG 1 and NHG 3 based on routine HE WSIs
was optimised (DeepGrade). The DeepGrade model was
applied for re-stratiﬁcation of NHG 2 tumours into two groups:
DG2-high, sharing similarity with NHG 3, and DG2-low, sharing
similarity with NHG 1. The prognostic performance of Deep-
Grade for NHG 2 stratiﬁcation was evaluated based on time-to-
event analysis (RFS) in independent test data (Figure 1). The
number of available training tiles in ClinSeq-BC, TCGA-BC and
SöS-BC-1 datasets were 1.56 million (M), 4.39 M and 3.25 M,
respectively. The ROC-AUC ranged from 0.919 (95% CI 0.884-
0.955) to 0.937 (95% CI 0.887-0.987) (independent test data,
Supplementary Figure S6, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/
j.annonc.2021.09.007, Supplementary Table S8, available
at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.007), indicating
good performance in classiﬁcation of NHG 1 and 3.
HE-stained routine WSIs can be applied to re-stratify
patients with NHG 2 tumours into two groups with
signiﬁcant difference in outcomes
DeepGrade was then applied to re-stratify NHG 2 cases into
two groups based on the assumption that the model has
capacity to capture morphological patterns related to NHG
1 and 3 also present in NHG 2. Out of 372 NHG 2 cases
(independent test data), 242 (65.0%) were classiﬁed as
DG2-low and 130 (35.0%) were classiﬁed as DG2-high. The
prognostic performance (RFS) of DeepGrade was visualised
by KaplaneMeier curves, and independent prognostic value
was evaluated by multivariable Cox proportional hazards
models, adjusting for established risk factors, including age,
tumour size, HER2 status, ER status and lymph node status
(Figure 2). The Nottingham histological grade was prog-
nostic in stratiﬁcation of NHG 3 and NHG 1, with an esti-
mated HR of 3.74 (95% CI 1.12-12.55, P ¼ 0.033, N ¼ 670,
Figures 2A and 3A). The DeepGrade model (DG2-low, DG2-
high) was found to be an independent prognostic factor for
stratiﬁcation of NHG 2 with an HR of 2.94 (95% CI 1.24-6.97,
P ¼ 0.015, N ¼ 305; Figures 2B and 3B). We also evaluated

prognostic performance in the NHG 2 ER-positive (ERþ)
subgroup (HR 3.21, 95% CI 1.32e7.79, P ¼ 0.010, N ¼ 287;
Figures 2C and 3C), and in the smaller NHG 2 ER-positive
and node-negative (ERþNodee) subgroup (HR 3.03, 95%
CI 0.91-10.10, P ¼ 0.071, N ¼ 183; Figures 2D and 3D).
Same analyses were repeated in the HER2-negative (HER2e)
patients in ERþHER2e and ERþHER2eNodee subgroups,
with an HR of 3.68 (95% CI 1.49-9.07, P ¼ 0.005, N ¼ 262,
Supplementary Figure S7A and C, available at https://doi.
org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.007) and 3.14 (95% CI 0.95-
10.41, P ¼ 0.061, N ¼ 166; Supplementary Figure S7B and D,
available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.007),
respectively. These results suggest that the DeepGrade model
offers independent prognostic stratiﬁcation of the NHG 2
group, with an HR comparable to that observed between
NHG 1 and 3.
Characterisation of DG2-low and DG2-high groups
The DG2-low and DG2-high cases were characterised to
ascertain potential differences in clinical variables and
intrinsic molecular subtypes.17 We observed no signiﬁcant
differences in Ki67 scores (Figure 4A, Supplementary
Table S9, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.
2021.09.007) between DG2-low and DG2-high (P ¼ 0.625,
ManneWhitney U test). The Ki67 score was signiﬁcantly
higher in DG2-low compared with NHG 1 (P ¼ 2.80  103),
while the Ki67 score in DG2-high was signiﬁcantly lower
than in NHG 3 (P ¼ 2.94  104, ManneWhitney U test).
The distribution of intrinsic molecular subtypes in DG2-low
and NHG 1 was not signiﬁcantly different, with luminal A
being the dominating intrinsic subtype (Figure 4B, P ¼
0.618; Fisher’s exact test). By contrast, we observed a dif-
ference in subtype distribution between DG2-high and NHG
3 (P ¼ 2.20  1016, Fisher’s exact test), where DG2-high
had a higher proportion of luminal A and lower propor-
tion of basal-like subtypes compared with NHG 3. Luminal B
was present in a higher proportion in DG2-high compared
with DG2-low. These results indicate that DG2-low shares
strong similarities with NHG 1 and DG2-high with NHG 3.
The
ﬁndings
also
suggest
that
DeepGrade
identiﬁes
morphological patterns in NHG 2 associated with more
aggressive tumours.
Furthermore, we assessed if the NHG subcomponent
scores (mitotic count, nuclear pleomorphism and tubular
formation) in the NHG 2 group were associated with DG2-
low and DG2-high. Only the score for the mitotic count
subcomponent (P ¼ 6.54  103, Fisher’s exact test) was
statistically different in DG2-high compared with DG2-low
(Figure 4C, Supplementary Table S10, available at https://
doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.007). Finally, we investi-
gated
if
the
sum
of
NHG
subcomponent
scores
(Supplementary Methods, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.annonc.2021.09.007) provided prognostic stratiﬁca-
tion of NHG 2, as a potential alternative to DeepGrade. NHG
2 tumours were dichotomised into ScoreSum-low (6) and
ScoreSum-high (7). No signiﬁcant difference in RFS could
be detected between these two groups (multivariable

Stained histopathology slides from breast cancer surgical specimens were scanned, tumour regions were segmented and image tiles were extracted. Patients with
tumours graded as Nottingham histological grade (NHG) 1 and 3 were used to optimise the DeepGrade model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble
including 20 base models. The DeepGrade model was subsequently applied to re-stratify NHG 2 cases. Finally, time-to-event analysis was applied to evaluate the

indicating
that prognostic stratiﬁcation of NHG 2 cannot be achieved
based on the NHG score sum. This suggests that DeepGrade
captures independent prognostic information for stratiﬁca-
tion of NHG 2 cases, and more importantly, these features
are not substitutable by factors included in routine patho-
logical assessment.
Validation of DeepGrade in an external cohort
To evaluate the generalisability of the DeepGrade model, we
analysed WSIs from 1262 patients in the SCAN-B Lund
cohort, representing a completely independent external
study material. The cohort is population representative and
the digitised WSIs were only used for the purpose of testing
the model performance.
We ﬁrst applied the DeepGrade model to classify NHG
1 and NHG 3 patients, and the resulting AUC was 0.907
(95% CI 0.885-0.930; Supplementary Figure S9A, available
at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.007), which
demonstrated that the model was able to provide clas-
siﬁcation performance comparable with the internal test
data. In addition, the RFS between DeepGrade-classiﬁed
NHG 1 and 3 patients was similar to that with clinically
assigned NHG 1 and 3 (Supplementary Figure S9B-E,
available
at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.
007).
The DeepGrade model was applied to re-stratify the NHG
2 group (N ¼ 608) and to evaluate prognostic performance
(Figures 5 and 6). A total of 376 (61.8%) patients were
classiﬁed as DG2-low, and 232 (38.2%) patients as DG2-high.
The DeepGrade model (DG2-low, DG2-high) provided
signiﬁcant prognostic value for stratiﬁcation of NHG 2 (P ¼
0.0045, log-rank test; Figure 5B) with an HR of 1.91 (95% CI
1.11-3.29, P ¼ 0.019, N ¼ 583; Figure 6B). In comparison,
the prognostic value comparing NHG 3 and NHG 1 was
found to have an HR of 1.59 (95% CI 0.78-3.24, P ¼ 0.201,
N ¼ 1191; Figure 6A).

HR was 1.66 (95% CI 0.96-2.88, P ¼ 0.070, N ¼ 567;

further evaluated in the ERþHER2e subgroup (HR 1.79, 95%
CI 1.02-3.12, P ¼ 0.041, N ¼ 538), and the ERþHER2e

DISCUSSION
In this study, we developed and validated a novel method,
DeepGrade, for histological grading of breast tumours,
focused on re-stratiﬁcation of NHG 2 cases. We demon-
strated that DeepGrade-based stratiﬁcation of NHG 2 (in-
termediate risk) cases provides independent prognostic
information of a magnitude comparable to that observed
between NHG 1 and 3. We also showed that the DG2-low
and DG2-high groups share clinical phenotype characteris-
tics with NHG 1 and 3, while none of the routine clinical
variables provided information that could be used for
prognostic stratiﬁcation of NHG 2. The morphological
characteristics of NHG 1 and 3 are usually clearly distin-
guished by pathologists, whereas NHG 2 has more vague
and variable characteristics. DeepGrade captures morpho-
logical features in NHG 2 tumours that are shared with the
more well-deﬁned NHG 1 and 3 groups, and exploits these
to enable consistent and precise stratiﬁcation of NHG 2.
Because the NHG-associated morphologies encompass a
continuous spectrum, rather than distinct deﬁned groups,
the application of a computer model to capture NHG-
related patterns is most likely required to consistently
distinguish subtle grade-related morphological differences.
These results were further veriﬁed in a completely inde-
pendent external test set.
We found that DeepGrade provided independent prog-
nostic value when applied for stratiﬁcation of the NHG 2
group (HR 2.94), which was of a comparable effect size to
previously
reported
studies

gene
expression
proﬁling. Wang et al.15 proposed a model based on a 34-
gene panel (RNA sequencing) that dichotomised NHG 2
tumours into a high- and a low-risk group with an HR of

Index (GGI)] dichotomised NHG 2 cases into two groups
with an estimated HR of 3.61.13 Another RNA-seq based
method
(EndoPredict)
for
ER-positive,
HER2-negative
tamoxifen-treated patients has a reported HR of 5.07 for
NHG 2 cases.37 These studies have consistently reported
that NHG 2 tumours can be further stratiﬁed with inde-
pendent prognostic value. In contrast to molecular-based
assays, DeepGrade only requires HE-stained FFPE sections,
which are part of the routine diagnostic work-up, thus
providing a rapid and cost-effective alternative that could
increase access to improved diagnostics.
Furthermore, we found that the subcomponent scores of
nuclear pleomorphism and tubule formation were not
signiﬁcantly different between DG2-low and DG2-high, and
that stratiﬁcation of NHG 2 could not be achieved by
dichotomisation based on NHG score sum 6 and 7. The
results suggest that the stratiﬁcation provided by the
DeepGrade model is not solely based on the NHG sub-
components, rather, the representations of morphological
patterns that the model captures is, at least to some extent,
independent of the established NHG criteria. Other risk
factors including tumour size and lymph node stage were
also similar between DG2-low and DG2-high, indicating that
DeepGrade could discern more subtle features, and provide
improved capability for tumour grading.
Despite the similarity in morphologies, we identiﬁed
notable differences in the distribution of intrinsic subtypes.
DG2-low shared a similar molecular subtype distribution
with NHG 1. The DG2-high group shared a similar distri-
bution of HER2-enriched and luminal B subtypes as the
NHG 3 group, whereas the frequency of the basal-like
subtype was lower in the DG2-high group compared with
the NHG 3 group. Basal-like tumours are typically associ-
ated with a high Ki67 score,38,39 and we also observed a
signiﬁcant difference in Ki67 score between DG2-high and
NHG 3. It should be noted that basal-like tumours have
distinct morphological features including severe nuclear
atypia and expression of basal cytokeratins.40 The luminal B
subtype, by contrast, is deﬁned by more subtle morpho-
logical features, and cannot always be easily distinguished
from the luminal A subtype by microscopic assessment. As
luminal A tumours are associated with lower grades and
good prognosis whereas HER2-enriched and basal-like tu-
mours typically have higher grade and poorer prognosis,41
these results further support that DeepGrade identiﬁes
aggressive morphological patterns. High-grade morpholog-
ical features are considered as indications for adjuvant
systemic chemotherapy,14,42 suggesting a potential for
DeepGrade to strengthen information relevant for thera-
peutic selection.

(A) Violin plot showing distribution of Ki67 (data only available in ClinSeq-BC). The distribution was different between NHG 1 and DG2-low (P ¼ 2.80  103, Manne
Whitney U test), and different between DG2-high and NHG 3 (P ¼ 2.94  104, ManneWhitney U test). No signiﬁcant difference between DG2-low and DG2-high was
observed (P ¼ 0.625, ManneWhitney U test). (B) Distribution of intrinsic subtypes. DG2-low was similar to NHG 1 with the majority being luminal A (P ¼ 0.618, Fisher’s
exact test). DG2-high has a larger proportion of HER2 and basal type compared with DG2-low. The subtype distribution for NHG 3 is signiﬁcantly different with DG2-high
(P ¼ 2.20  1016, Fisher’s exact test). (C) Distribution of three NHG subcomponent scores with respect to mitotic count, nuclear polymorphism and tubular formation.
Only the score for mitotic count was found to be signiﬁcantly different between DG2-low and DG2-high (P ¼ 6.54  103, Fisher’s exact test). Basal, basal-like; DG,

The prognostic performance of DeepGrade was further
validated in an external cohort, which conﬁrmed indepen-
dent prognostic value between re-stratiﬁed NHG 2 (DG2-
low and DG2-high) patients (HR 1.91).
A central objective in modern breast oncology is to de-
escalate adjuvant therapy for patients with ER-positive/
HER2-negative tumours with few or no lymph node metas-
tases. This comprises the absolutely largest group of breast
cancer patients. In a population-based register study of
pathology data with over 45 000 patients in Sweden,11
>60% of the ERþ HER2e patients were reported as
NHG2. This clearly shows that methods to identify high- and
low-risk patients in this patient group could contribute to
clinical decision making of adjuvant chemotherapy. Over the
past decade, gene expression proﬁling assays have become
available in clinical practice for stratiﬁcation of the same
patient group into a low- and high-risk group, to supplement
therapeutic decision making.43 The majority of tumours
considered for gene expression proﬁling in routine health-
care are NHG 2. Gene-expression proﬁling takes 1-2 weeks in
the clinical setting and is associated with signiﬁcant costs.
The DeepGrade model provides prognostic stratiﬁcation
for NHG 2 patients, and related subgroups, in a relatively
short time.
Timewise, the proposed workﬂow required, on average,
1.24 and 16.4 min to predict tumour and carry out risk strat-
iﬁcation on one GPU card, respectively. Signiﬁcant gain in
speed can be achieved by parallelising the computation with
multiple GPUs. The direct compute costs are estimated to be
<V1 in a public cloud infrastructure. Hence, it offers a
potentially cost-effective alternative to gene expression
proﬁling. Although the process can be considered time-
consuming compared with pathologists, we believe that the
additional stratiﬁcation provides pathological information that
is needed for clinical decision making in general, and for de-
escalation of chemotherapy in particular.

This study has limitations. The study is based on retro-
spective materials because prospective studies are chal-
lenging due to the need for long follow-up times. Ductal
carcinoma in situ annotations in slide images were not
available, which could cause a conservative underestima-
tion of the prognostic performance of DeepGrade. Only
ClinSeq-BC has pathologist annotation of invasive cancer
areas, which were used to exclude benign regions in sub-
sequent analysis. An invasive detection model was opti-
mised based on the annotated ClinSeq-BC study and
applied to WSIs in all other studies to outline tumour
regions. Hence, it is not impossible that the DeepGrade
model could achieve better performance if we would
perform manual annotations of cancer regions on all WSIs,
as these are expected to be more precise. The DeepGrade
model performance has not been possible to test sys-
tematically
across
different
types
of
slide
scanners,
although images from multiple scanners were included in
the study.
In conclusion, improved stratiﬁcation of intermediate risk
breast cancer patients has the potential to reduce over-
treatment and undertreatment by adjuvant chemotherapy.
The DeepGrade model provides independent prognostic
stratiﬁcation for NHG 2, and offers a potential cost-effective
alternative to gene expression proﬁling, which could in-
crease access to pathological information needed for clinical
decision making in general, and for de-escalation of
chemotherapy in particular.
