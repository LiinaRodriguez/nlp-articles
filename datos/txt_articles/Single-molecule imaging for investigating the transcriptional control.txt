ABSTRACT
Transcription is an essential biological process involving numerous factors, including transcription factors (TFs), which 
play a central role in this process by binding to their cognate DNA motifs. Although cells must tightly regulate the kinetics 
of factor association and dissociation during transcription, factor dynamics during transcription remain poorly char­
acterized, primarily because of the reliance on ensemble experiments that average out molecular heterogeneity. Recent 
advances in single-molecule fluorescence imaging techniques have enabled the exploration of TF dynamics at un­
precedented resolution. Findings on the temporal dynamics of individual TFs have challenged classical models and 
provided new insights into transcriptional regulation. Single-molecule imaging has also elucidated the assembly kinetics 
of transcription complexes. In this review, we describe the single-molecule fluorescence imaging methods widely used to 
determine factor dynamics during transcription. We highlight new findings on TF binding to chromatin, TF target search, 
and the assembly order of transcription complexes. Additionally, we discuss the remaining challenges in achieving a 
comprehensive understanding of the temporal regulation of transcription.

INTRODUCTION
Transcription is a highly regulated process typically initiated by 
transcription factors (TFs) or activators that bind to cognate-binding 
motifs (Lambert et al., 2018). The classic model of transcriptional 
activation posits that TFs and coactivators recruit chromatin re­
modelers and histone-modifying enzymes to reorganize nucleo­
somes, thereby increasing chromatin accessibility (reviewed in 
Roeder, 2019). Transcriptional activation ultimately facilitates the 
assembly of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) preinitiation complex 
(PIC), which is capable of initiating RNA synthesis at the tran­
scription start site within the core promoter (reviewed in Hahn, 2004; 
Orphanides et al., 1996; Schier and Taatjes, 2020; Thomas and 
Chiang, 2006). The Pol II PIC consists of Pol II and general tran­
scription factors (GTFs) including TBP, TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIF, 
TFIIE, and TFIIH. GTFs confer Pol II promoter specificity (reviewed 
in Schier and Taatjes, 2020; Thomas and Chiang, 2006). The 
prompt recruitment and release of each factor is crucial for the 
precise and timely synthesis of transcripts. However, the kinetics of 
factor association and dissociation during transcription remain lar­
gely uncharacterized.
Most models explaining the mechanisms of transcriptional 
regulation are based on ensemble experiments that measure 
the population-averaged behavior of heterogeneous molecules. 
For example, although an invaluable assay for studying TF- 
chromatin 
interactions, 
chromatin 
immunoprecipita­
tion quantifies the average signal of TF-DNA interactions across 
a population of molecules (Park, 2009). This can mask mole­
cule-to-molecule variability and heterogeneity, which are im­
portant for understanding stochastic processes, such as 
transcription (Coulon et al., 2013; Levsky and Singer, 2003; Liu 
and Tjian, 2018; Swift and Coruzzi, 2017).
Recent advances in single-molecule fluorescence imaging 
have revealed the movement dynamics of individual molecules 
during transcription with unprecedented resolution (Basu et al., 
2024; Chen et al., 2014; Cisse et al., 2013; Donovan et al., 
2023; Gebhardt et al., 2013; Lerner et al., 2020; Pomp et al., 
2024; Tang et al., 2022; Versluis et al., 2024). These findings 
have challenged the classic view of TF dynamics (Perlmann 
et al., 1990) and have provided new insights into the mechan­
isms underlying transcriptional regulation. While TF binding to 
its cognate DNA sequences is typically viewed as stable, single- 
molecule fluorescence imaging has uncovered transient inter­
actions of TFs with chromatin, occurring in the order of seconds 
(Chen et al., 2014; Dufourt et al., 2018; Loffreda et al., 2017). In 
this review, we describe in vitro and in vivo single-molecule

fluorescence imaging techniques that are currently used to 
elucidate the dynamics of factor association and dissociation 
during transcription and highlight key findings on TF kinetics. 
We also address the assembly order of the Pol II PIC, as re­
vealed by single-molecule fluorescence imaging. We conclude 
with questions that need to be further investigated to better 
understand the kinetics of transcriptional regulation.
SINGLE-MOLECULE METHODS TO VISUALIZE FACTOR 
DYNAMICS DURING TRANSCRIPTION
Transcription is a stochastic process that is driven by a het­
erogeneous population of molecules with dynamic interactions. 
Single-molecule fluorescence imaging assays enable us to di­
rectly measure the kinetics of molecular interactions at a single- 
molecule resolution, allowing us to identify the mechanisms 
underlying transcriptional regulation (Table 1). Various single- 
molecule fluorescence imaging assays using total internal re­
flection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy have been developed 
(Kudalkar et al., 2016; Reck-Peterson et al., 2010; Tokunaga 
et al., 1997). TIRF uses an evanescent wave generated when 
an excitation light is totally internally reflected at the solid-liquid 
interface (Axelrod, 2008). The evanescent wave has the same 
wavelength as the excitation light. Because the intensity of an 
evanescent wave decays exponentially with the distance from 
the interface, the thickness of the excitation depth is limited to 
approximately 100 nm, which restricts the illumination space 
and thus enhances the signal-to-noise ratio (Reck-Peterson 
et al., 2010). This background elimination feature of TIRF en­
ables the acquisition of images at a single-molecule resolution. 
TIRF is a useful tool for studying cellular processes occurring at 
or near the plasma membrane, such as cytoskeleton assembly, 
cell-cell interactions, and vesicle trafficking (Li et al., 2015; 
Pellinen et al., 2006; Rappoport and Simon, 2003; Yamada and 
Nelson, 2007). With the development of in vitro systems that 
recapitulate biological reactions in the nucleus, TIRF has been 
used to study transcription. One in vitro single-molecule imaging 
approach utilizing TIRF is colocalization single-molecule spec­
troscopy (CoSMoS) (Friedman and Gelles, 2015) (Fig. 1A). The 
CoSMoS measures the interaction kinetics between individual 
molecules at the single-molecule level. It has been used to 
elucidate the assembly mechanisms of macromolecular com­
plexes involved in biological processes such as transcription, 
cotranscriptional processes, and DNA replication (Baek et al., 
2021; Friedman and Gelles, 2012; Hoskins et al., 2011; 
Revyakin et al., 2012; Ticau et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016). 
TIRF has also been used to perform single-molecule fluores­
cence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) (Ha et al., 1996) 
(Fig. 1B). The smFRET assay on a TRIF microscope measures 
the dynamics of the intra- or intermolecular interactions of the 
surface-immobilized molecules within the 10 nm range (Holden 
et al., 2010). The smFRET TIRF studies identified the structural 
dynamics of TFs, Pol II, and nucleosomes during transcription 
(Andrecka et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2021; Crickard et al., 2017; 
Kilic et al., 2018; Malkusch et al., 2017; Xiong et al., 2024). 
Collectively, in vitro single-molecule imaging approaches have 
provided important kinetic information on the interactions of TFs 
with chromatin and the assembly of transcription complexes 
(Table 1).
To overcome the limitations of limited depth of illumination in 
TIRF, a single-molecule imaging technique called highly inclined 
and laminated sheet (HILO) microscopy has been developed 
(Tokunaga et al., 2008). HILO microscopy illuminates a cell with 
a thin and inclined sheet of a laser beam, thus enabling the 
acquisition of single-molecule images of nuclear proteins in 
living cells. Over the past decade, HILO microscopy has been 
widely used to perform single-molecule tracking (SMT) (or 
called single-particle tracking to elucidate the kinetics of TFs 
and transcription complexes in live cells (reviewed in Dahal 
et al., 2023). The development of super-resolution microscopy 
techniques, such as photoactivated localization microscopy and 
stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, has further ex­
panded the capabilities of SMT assays (Betzig et al., 2006; 
Fujiwara et al., 2023; Klein et al., 2011; Rust et al., 2006; Shroff 
et al., 2008). In SMT, individual molecules visualized as fluor­
escent spots are monitored over time, and a temporal sequence 
of spot locations or a 2D trajectory is generated. Recent ad­
vances in determining the axial position using feedback-tracking 
methods have enabled the generation of 3D trajectories (Hou 
et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2023).

Multiple types of kinetic information can be obtained from 
SMT trajectories, including the number of diffusive states, dif­
fusion coefficients of each state, fractions of each state, re­
sidence time, trajectory radius, and displacement anisotropy. 
The type of kinetic information on molecular diffusion depends 
on the image acquisition parameters. High-speed measure­
ments with a short interval of milliseconds (fast tracking) capture 
fast-diffusing molecules, whereas low-speed imaging (slow 
tracking) measures subpopulations bound to chromatin or other 
nuclear structures (Fig. 1C). In general, TFs exhibit 3 diffusive 
states: an unbound state, in which TFs freely diffuse in the 
nucleoplasm, a nonspecific bound state, in which TFs search 
for their target via transient interactions with chromatin, and a 
specific bound state, in which TFs stably bind to chromatin (Lu 
and Lionnet, 2021). The frequency and duration of TF occu­
pancy can be extracted from slow-tracking data. Histones in a 
nucleosome are typically used as references for the static state 
to measure the average diffusion coefficient of bulk chromatin 
(Hansen et al., 2017; Izeddin et al., 2014). Evaluating the TF 
movements under various image acquisition conditions is im­
portant for avoiding any bias arising from technical limitations. 
For example, fast tracking can underestimate the residence 
time owing to photobleaching; whereas slow tracking can lead 
to overestimation of the residence time of chromatin-bound 
molecules by missing transiently bound molecules.
Other widely used single-molecule fluorescence imaging 
assays for transcriptional studies include fluorescence recovery 
after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence correlation 
spectroscopy (FCS) (Axelrod et al., 1976; Magde et al., 1974; 
Peters et al., 1974). FRAP and FCS typically use confocal mi­
croscopy (Braeckmans et al., 2007; Kubitscheck et al., 1998; 
Wedekind et al., 1994; Yu et al., 2021). FRAP measures the 
diffusion dynamics of fluorescently labeled proteins in living 
cells (Fig. 1D). Specifically, a small area of interest in the cell is 
photobleached using a high-power laser, and the fluorescence 
recovery of the photobleached area is monitored over time. The 
scanning laser beam and pinhole of a confocal microscope 
enable photobleaching of a specific area within a cell with high 
spatial resolution. This precise photobleaching capability is 
beneficial for FRAP experiments. The rate of fluorescence re­
covery represents the mobility of the labeled proteins, as de­
termined by diffusion and binding kinetics (Wachsmuth, 2014). 
FRAP has been successfully used to quantify the dynamics of 
TFs and chromatin regulators in living cells, including the im­
mobile fraction, recovery half-life, diffusion coefficient, and as­
sociation and dissociation constants (Cheutin et al., 2003; 
Raccaud et al., 2019; Stenoien et al., 2001; Versluis et al., 2024; 
Voss et al., 2011). FCS is a complementary approach to FRAP 
in that it is effective for measuring fast diffusion dynamics ran­
ging from microseconds to seconds (Elson, 2011). FCS detects 
fluctuations in the fluorescence intensity within a limited volume 
at the femtoliter level (Elson, 2011) (Fig. 1E). The diffusion of 
fluorescently labeled proteins through focused light causes 
changes in the fluorescence intensity. The confocal beam and 
pinhole provide a confined detection volume and ensure that 
only the emission light from this focused detection volume 
reaches the detector. FCS quantifies the diffusion coefficients 
and different diffusing populations of proteins from the temporal 
autocorrelation of the fluorescence intensity over time traces 
(Singh et al., 2017; White et al., 2016). FRAP and FCS are 
useful to cross-validate their measurements (Stasevich 
et al., 2010).
Each single-molecule fluorescence imaging assay offers 
unique capabilities for measuring distinct characteristics of 
factor dynamics during transcription. TIRF-based CoSMoS and 
smFRET are specialized in measuring the dynamics of mole­
cular interactions. CoSMoS is useful for studying the assembly 
kinetics of macromolecular complexes, whereas smFRET is 
beneficial for detecting conformational and structural dynamics. 
However, these assays have limited applications in vivo. SMT is 
a powerful technique for measuring in vivo diffusion kinetics of 
TF and chromatin interactions. While SMT tracks individual 
molecules, FRAP and FCS are useful for studying molecular 
dynamics in a specific region within living cells. A limitation of 
FRAP is the use of high laser power for photobleaching, which 
can lead to photodamage. FCS, on the other hand, captures 
rapid diffusion more effectively but is highly susceptible to 
background signals.
REGULATION OF TF BINDING STABILITY ON CHROMATIN
TFs are master regulators of gene expression. Understanding 
the high-resolution kinetics of TF behavior can provide me­
chanistic insights into TF-mediated transcriptional activation. 
Single-molecule fluorescence imaging techniques have re­
vealed that TFs interact transiently with chromatin rather than 
exhibiting stable binding (Callegari et al., 2019; Chen et al., 
2014; Mir et al., 2018; Paakinaho et al., 2017; Raccaud et al., 
2019; Sugo et al., 2015). The average residence time of TFs on 
chromatin is in the order of seconds (Lu and Lionnet, 2021). For 
example, p53 has an average residence time of 3.1 s (Loffreda 
et al., 2017). Pioneer factors, such as FoxA1, Sox2, and Oct4, 
have residence times of approximately 10 s (Chen et al., 2014; 
Swinstead et al., 2016; Teves et al., 2016). The Drosophila 
pioneer factor Zelda shows an even more transient interaction 
with chromatin with a residence time of 0.696 s (Mir et al., 
2017). However, some TFs remain bound to the chromatin for 
longer periods. For instance, the GAGA factor (GAF), a Dro­
sophila pioneer-like factor, has a residence time of 130 s, which 
is several times longer than the typical TF residence times 
(Tang et al., 2022). This prolonged residence time is likely at­
tributable to the multimerization of GAF, which increases the

local concentration of its DNA-binding domain, thereby in­
creasing binding stability. Similarly, dimerization of c-Fos in 
MDA-MB-231 cells enhances its binding stability to chromatin 
(Shao et al., 2021). Transient interactions between individual 
TFs and their target sites might allow TFs to respond to 
changes in local concentrations or cellular states with high 
sensitivity. Although not yet generalizable to all TFs, several 
studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between TF 
binding stability and transcriptional output (Donovan et al., 
2019b; Hipp et al., 2019; Popp et al., 2021). For example, in 
human U2-OS cells, an increase in VP64 concentration and 
residence time was associated with higher transcription bursting 
frequency and transcription output (Popp et al., 2021). Notably, 
the efficiency of transcription activation was more affected by 
VP64 residence time rather than by its concentration. Further 
studies examining the functional consequences of changes in 
TF dynamics on transcriptional output will provide a more pre­
cise connection between TF dynamics and function.
Recent single-molecule imaging studies have demonstrated 
that TF binding stability is dynamically regulated by cellular 
states and environmental factors. In mouse fibroblasts, chro­
matin-bound serum response factor (SRF) is classified into 3 
populations based on its residence time: short-, intermediate-, 
and long-bound (Hipp et al., 2019). Each fraction responds 
differently to upstream signaling pathways. The residence time 
of long-bound SRF increases upon growth factor stimulation, 
whereas the inhibition of Rho-GTPase signaling reduces the 
residence time of the long-bound fraction. Inhibition of MAPK 
signaling decreases the residence time of intermediate-bound 
SRF. This differential regulation of SRF dissociation rates by 
different signaling pathways results in differential gene activa­
tion (Hipp et al., 2019). Similarly, in mouse mammary carcinoma 
cells, different types of glucocorticoid differentially affect the 
residence time of activated glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) on 
chromatin (Stavreva et al., 2019). Cortisol stimulation leads to a 
longer residence time of the GR than dexamethasone stimula­
tion. The glucocorticoid-dependent GR residence time is posi­
tively correlated with the duration of transcriptional bursting 
(Stavreva et al., 2019). Additionally, the GR residence times 
vary depending on the activation phase, being longer during the 
early phase than during the later phase. Signaling pathways 
and extrinsic ligand cues dynamically regulate the stability of 
TF-chromatin interactions to modulate gene expression.
TFs mediate gene activation in concert with their interacting 
partners, such as other TFs, cofactors, and coactivators. These 
interactions influence the binding kinetics of each partner. In 
mouse embryonic stem cells, an enhanceosome assembles in a 
stepwise manner, with Esrrb binding after Sox2 and Oct4 (Xie 
et al., 2017). Sox2 depletion reduced the residence time of 
Esrrb in chromatin (Xie et al., 2017). Coactivators also influence 
TF residence times. In the secretory cells of Drosophila larval 
salivary glands, the TF Scalloped (Sd) interacts with the coac­
tivator Yorkie (Yki) at active transcription sites (Manning et al., 
2024). Increased Yki expression doubled the Sd residence time, 
resulting in higher gene expression than in cells with normal Yki 
expression.
Chromatin states surrounding TF binding sites are another 
factor that regulates TF binding stability. In yeast, the RSC 
complex remodels chromatin states, thereby destabilizing the 
interaction between the yeast TF Ace1p and chromatin (Mehta 
et al., 2018). The RSC-mediated dissociation of Ace1p allows 
transcription reinitiation, as Ace1p can rebind to the promoter. 
The knockdown and knockout of Rsc2p, a subunit of the RSC 
complex, increased the residence time of Ace1p. The delayed 
exchange between Rsc2p and Ace1p decreased transcription 
burst frequency. These results suggest that changes in the 
chromatin state by chromatin remodelers influence TF re­
sidence times on chromatin, contributing to the dynamic reg­
ulation of transcription activation. An in vitro study using 
reconstituted nucleosomes revealed that the position of a cog­
nate DNA motif influences TF binding stability through position- 
dependent cooperativity of Sox2 and Oct4 (Li et al., 2019). In 
the study, when the Sox2:Oct4 motif was positioned at the end 
of the nucleosomal DNA, Oct4 stabilized Sox2 binding. In 
contrast, when the Sox2:Oct4 motif was located in the nucleo­
somal dyad, Oct4 did not affect the residence time of Sox2. To 
summarize, the binding stability of TFs is regulated at multiple 
levels, including their intrinsic binding affinities for binding sites, 
upstream signaling pathways, interacting factors, and chromatin 
states (Fig. 2A).
ROLES OF CHROMATIN IN TF TARGET SEARCH
A current TF target search model proposes that TFs utilize a 
trial-and-error mechanism that involves a combination of 3D 
diffusion in the nuclear space and 1D diffusion, either sliding or 
hopping along the DNA, to locate their binding sites. TFs exhibit 
distinct 3D and 1D diffusive states depending on the biological 
conditions. For example, an in vitro single-molecule fluores­
cence imaging study using naked DNA revealed that upon ac­
tivation, p53 exhibited a 4-fold reduction in 3D diffusion and a 
1.5-fold increase in 1D diffusion (Itoh et al., 2016) (Fig. 2B). 
Activated p53 showed an increased search distance by inter­
mittent hopping along the DNA groove rather than by con­
tinuous sliding (Subekti et al., 2020). Additionally, the kinetics of 
TF target search are influenced by chromatin density (Fig. 2B). 
Live-cell imaging studies have revealed that TFs such as p53 
and p65 exhibit distinct behaviors related to chromatin density 
upon activation (Mazzocca et al., 2023). Specifically, p53 
showed opposite diffusion patterns in the chromatin-dense and 
chromatin-poor regions. p53 molecules with slow diffusion, high 
anisotropy, and compact exploration were more prevalent in 
chromatin-dense regions than in chromatin-poor regions. These 
slow-diffusing p53 molecules in chromatin-dense areas had a 
higher chance of transitioning to the chromatin-bound state. 
Unlike p53, chromatin enrichment of p65 was not dependent on 
its diffusion speed, as both slow- and fast-diffusing p65 mole­
cules were found in chromatin-poor regions.
The effects of nucleosomes on TF search kinetics are TF- 
specific. In vitro studies using reconstituted nucleosomes re­
vealed that the yeast TF Rap1 displays no differences in as­
sociation rates between naked DNA and nucleosomes, 
suggesting that Rap1 target search is independent of the nu­
cleosomal presence (Mivelaz et al., 2020). In the study, unlike 
Rap1, Reb1 and Cbf1 showed approximately 50- to 100-fold 
reductions in association rates with reconstituted nucleosomes

compared with naked DNA, whereas their residence time on 
nucleosomal DNA increased (Donovan et al., 2019a). The in­
creased residence time of Cbf1 was attributed to direct inter­
actions between its basic helix-loop-helix domain and histones 
(Donovan et al., 2023).
ASSEMBLY ORDERS OF POL II PIC
Timely association and dissociation of various regulatory factors is 
essential for precise transcription processes. Identification of the 
association kinetics of each factor suggests binding order(s) during 
transcription complex assembly (Fig. 2C). Recent single-molecule 
fluorescence imaging studies have provided deeper insights into 
the stepwise assembly model of Pol II PIC. Sequential binding of 
TFIIA and TFIIB was confirmed by the in vitro study using a DNA 
template containing the consensus TATA, initiator motif, and 
downstream promoter elements, TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIF, and Pol 
II (Zhang et al., 2016). Interestingly, TFIIB binding was highly tran­
sient and repetitive, with an interval of 3 s. This transient on/off TFIIB 
binding was stabilized by the subsequent binding of Pol II and TFIIF. 
A single-molecule fluorescence imaging study using yeast nuclear 
extract identified branched pathways of TF-dependent PIC as­
sembly, where Pol II and TFIIF initially bind to the upstream acti­
vating sequence (UAS) and then join the PIC at the core promoter 
(Baek et al., 2021). TFIIE can bind to a Pol II•TFIIF complex, either 
at the UAS or the core promoter. Additionally, TFIIF can simulta­
neously associate with or after Pol II binding. The assembly of the 
Pol II•TFIIF•TFIIE complex does not require a core promoter, but 
the core promoter makes the complex more stable. Unlike other 
factors, TFIIH binding to DNA requires the core promoter. This 
spatiotemporally coordinated PIC assembly has also been ob­
served in living yeast (Nguyen et al., 2021). TBP, TFIID, TFIIA, and 
TFIIB reconfigure promoter structures for PIC formation. The 
mediator controls the recruitment of Pol II, TFIIF, and TFIIE. Inter­
estingly, the observed association rates of Mediator and TFIID are 
0.01 s−1 (or 1 event every 100 s) and the average time of asso­
ciation and dissociation of PIC components is a few seconds. 
These findings suggest that PIC formation is infrequent but occurs 
efficiently once TFIID and Mediator are nucleated.
CONCLUSION
The development of single-molecule fluorescence imaging techni­
ques, along with advances in fluorescent dyes and labeling 
methods, has enabled the identification of the kinetics of molecular 
interactions during transcription at a single-molecule resolution, 
providing insights that cannot be obtained from ensemble experi­
ments. Single-molecule studies have uncovered unexpectedly short 
residence times of TFs on chromatin, as well as 1D and 3D target 
search modes, and the hierarchical and branched assembly of Pol 
II PIC. Additionally, various environmental cues and chromatin 
states dynamically regulate TF kinetics.
Despite the significant advances in our understanding of the 
temporal characteristics of heterogeneous populations of TFs 
and transcription complexes, several challenges remain un­
addressed. Single-molecule fluorescence imaging results can 
vary based on experimental conditions such as dye labeling 
methods, image acquisition parameters, and experimental 
specimens. Using orthogonal methods for cross-validation and 
conducting extensive control experiments concurrently is cru­
cial. Another challenge involves data analysis and modeling, 
which can introduce biases in data interpretation. For example, 
the analysis of TF residence time distribution using a bi-ex­
ponential model assumes the presence of 2 TF subpopulations: 
specific and nonspecific binding fractions. However, this model 
is often too simplistic to capture the stochastic and complex 
nature of TF behaviors. Instead, a power-law model, which 
assumes a continuous distribution of TF residence times, could 
provide a more accurate analysis of TF residence times (Garcia 
et al., 2021a, 2021b). A comparison of single-particle tracking 
methods 
has 
revealed 
differences 
between 
algorithms 
(Chenouard et al., 2014). There is no universally best particle 
tracking method; rather, factor and data-specific approaches 
are necessary. These approaches should consider particle 
shape and size, frame rate, background uniformity, and photo­
bleaching. The recent development of deep learning-assisted 
methods has enabled more precise analysis, including photo­
bleaching correction, trajectory generation, and classification of 
TF diffusion models, allowing for more reliable interpretations of 
single-molecule imaging data (Liu et al., 2022). Other questions 
that remain unaddressed include the differential TF dynamics 
across various cell types and their contributions to gene ex­
pression variability, the roles of long noncoding RNAs in reg­
ulating TF dynamics, detailed kinetics of TF-TF interactions in a 
single enhancer region, and assembly dynamics of transcription 
elongation and termination complexes.
