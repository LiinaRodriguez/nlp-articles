Abstract
The clinical success of immune checkpoint blockade against diverse human cancers highlights the critical importance 
of insightful understanding into mechanisms underlying PD-L1 regulation. IFN-γ released by intratumoral lymphocytes 
regulates PD-L1 expression in tumor cells through JAK-STAT-IRF1 pathway, while the molecular events prime IRF1 to 
translocate into nucleus are still obscure. Here we identified STXBP6, previously recognized involving in SNARE com-
plex assembly, negatively regulates PD-L1 transcription via retention of IRF1 in cytoplasm. IFN-γ exposure stimulates 
accumulation of cytosolic IRF1, which eventually saturates STXBP6 and triggers nuclear translocation of IRF1. Nuclear 
IRF1 in turn inhibits STXBP6 expression and thereby liberates more IRF1 to migrate to nucleus. Therefore, we identified 
a novel positive feedback loop between STXBP6 and IRF1 in regulation of PD-L1 expression in cancer. Furthermore, we 
demonstrate STXBP6 overexpression significantly inhibits T cell activation both in vitro and in vivo. These findings offer 
new insight into the complexity of PD-L1 expression in cancer and suggest a valuable measure to predict the response to 
PD-1/PD-L1-based immunotherapy.

Introduction
The PD-1/PD-L1 antibody-based tumor immunotherapy is 
prosperous currently [1, 2], the clinical outcomes of which 
vary greatly depending on tumor types and individual con-
ditions. Cell surface PD-L1 abundance is well-recognized 
as one of the critical determinants of therapeutic responses 
[3, 4]. Therefore, the comprehensive understanding into the 
regulatory mechanisms underlying PD-L1 expression is of 
essential importance to decipher tumor immune evasion and 
instruct immunotherapy [5, 6]. So far multiple signaling 
and mechanisms have been unraveled in control of PD-L1 
expression. In nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma and 
primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, chromosome 
9p24.1 is selectively amplified which links to aberrant high 
expression of PD-L1 along with PD-L2 and JAK2 [7, 8]. 
Oncogenic transcription factors, including MYC [9], HIF1α 
[10, 11] and NF-κB [12, 13] involving in PD-L1 transcrip-
tion are identified along with their respective responsive ele-
ments. More recently, the post-transcriptional regulation of 
PD-L1 by multiple microRNAs has also been documented 
[14, 15], and its importance has been underlined by the 
finding of structural variations (SVs) in 3′ region of PD-L1 
[16], which associates with elevated PD-L1 transcripts and 
sophisticated immune evasion highly likely through dis-
rupting the interaction between PD-L1 and unidentified 
microRNAs. At protein level, type III transmembrane pro-
tein CMTM6 increases cell surface PD-L1 through either 
promoting recycling endosomes [17] or inhibiting ubiquit-
ination-mediated degradation [18]. Likely, cell cycle kinase 
cyclin D/CDK4-dependent phosphorylation stabilizes SPOP, 
which thereby promotes PD-L1 degradation via ubiquitin/
proteasome system [19].
In addition to the intrinsic regulatory mechanisms, 
interplays between immune cells and cancer cells in tumor 
microenvironment constitute a fundamental dimension in 
control PD-L1 abundance [20, 21]. The interferons released 
from tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes trigger PD-L1 induc-
tion in cancer cells and thereby inhibit the anti-tumor 
immune response [22]. Among which, type II IFN-γ binds 
to IFNGR1/2 receptors and stimulates phosphorylation of 
JAK1/2, subsequently phosphorylated receptors recruit 
and phosphorylate STAT1/3 [23]. Activated STAT dimers 
migrate into nucleus and transcriptionally activate IFN-γ 
inducible genes, such as IRF1. The systematic mapping of 
JAK1/JAK2-STAT1/STAT1/STAT2/STAT3-IRF1 axis with 
shRNA screening has highlighted its importance for clini-
cal responses to PD-1 blockade therapy [24]. IRF1-deficient 
tumor fails to up-regulate PD-L1 and is more susceptible 
to T cell-mediated killing, which is rescued by induced 
expression of PD-L1 [25]. However, as a critical interferon 
response mediator, the molecular events underlying nuclear 
transportation of IRF1 largely remains elusive. Here we 
unravel a novel mechanism that STXBP6, a protein previ-
ously recognized involving in SNARE complex formation 
[26, 27], controls IRF1 subcellular distribution and there-
fore negatively regulates PD-L1 expression in multiple can-
cers. We further identify a positive feedback loop between 
STXBP6 and IRF1 in response to IFN-γ stimulation. Our 
study offers new insight into the complexity of PD-L1 
expression in tumor.
Materials and methods
Cell culture
HCT116, HepG2, 769p, A2780, HeLa, MCF7 and MDA-

ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine 
serum. Cell identity was authenticated by STR profiling 
method by SYSU and possible mycoplasma contamina-
tion was regularly excluded by PCR analysis. Cell transfec-
tion was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)

Western blots
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing proteinase 
inhibitor cocktail (Roche) on ice for 30 min and debris 
was removed by refrigerated centrifugation. The superna-
tant was quantitated with BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo 
Fisher) and denatured in SDS sample buffer at 100 ℃ for 
5 min. The protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE 
and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore). Membranes 
were briefly blocked with 5% skim milk and incubated with 
indicated antibodies (mouse anti-HSP90, 610418, BD Bio-
sciences; mouse anti-PD-L1, UMAB228, Origene; mouse 
anti-STXBP6, sc-271959, Santa Cruz; mouse anti-Lamin

rabbit anti-IRF1, D5E4; goat anti-rabbit, 7074; horse anti-
mouse, 7076; Cell Signaling Technology), and blots were 
visualized using ECL (Millipore).
Immunoprecipitation
Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 ℃. 
After refrigerated centrifugation for 15 min, the supernatant 
was transferred into new tubes and incubated with indicated 
primary antibodies (mouse anti-STXBP6, sc-271959; mouse 
anti-IRF1, sc-514544; Santa Cruz) on rotator overnight at 
4 ℃, followed by addition of Dynabeads Protein G and incu-
bation for another 2 h at 4 ℃. Beads were washed with 0.2% 
Triton X-100 three times and co-immunoprecipitated pro-
tein species were eluted with SDS sample buffer containing 
50 mM DTT for 10 min at 70 ℃, and subjected to western 
blots detection as previously described.
Orthotopic 4T1 xenograft animal model
Animal study was approved by the Sun Yat-sen Uni-
versity Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
(SYSU IACUC). Female BALB/c mice (6-week-old) 
were purchased from Vital River Laboratory. 4T1 cells 
(5 × 106 eV or STXBP6-overexpressing) were s.c. inoculated 
into the mammary gland and allowed to grow for 15 days. 
Tumor progression and body weight of tumor-bearing mice 
was regularly monitored, and xenograft tumor volume was 
estimated as length × width2 × 0.5.
Micro‑metastasis evaluation
Lung and liver tissues from aforementioned 4T1 tumor mice 
were collected, washed with 1 × HBSS buffer, and minced 
into small pieces in 6-cm petri dish. After transfer into a new 
15 ml tubes, lung tissues were digested with collagenase 
type IV/elastase (1 mg/ml collagenase type IV and 6 U/ml 
elastase, Worthington) on rotator at 4 ℃ for 75 min, and liver 
tissues were digested with collagenase type I/hyaluronidase 
(1 mg/ml collagenase type I from Worthington and 1 mg/
ml hyaluronidase from Sigma-Aldrich) on rotator at 37 ℃ 
for 30 min. Enzyme-digested samples were filtered with 
70 μm cell strainer and washed with 1 × HBSS buffer. After 
brief centrifugation, the sample pellets were resuspended in 
complete modified RPMI medium supplemented with 60 μM 
6-thioguanine (Sigma-Aldrich), and followed by consecutive 
culture for 2 weeks. The clonogenic 4T1 cells were stained 
with crystal violet and counted.
Immunofluorescence
Mice were euthanized at day 15 post-implantation follow-
ing SYSU IACUC guideline, xenograft tumors were col-
lected in base molds pre-filled with Tissue-Tek CRYO-
OCT (SAKURA) and subjected to cryosection with NX50 
Cryostat (Thermo Fisher). Tissue sections were fixed with 
4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) plus 0.3% Triton X-100, and 
sequentially blocked with 3% BSA/0.05% Tween-20 and 
normal rat serum (Sigma). Incubation with anti-CD8 pri-
mary antibody (MCA609G, Bio-Rad) was performed at 
4 ℃ overnight, and followed by incubation with goat anti-
rat AF488 secondary antibody (A-11006, Invitrogen) for 
another h at room temperature. Slides were then mounted 
with ProLong Gold/DAPI (P36931, Invitrogen) and ana-
lyzed under (LSM800, Carl Zeiss).
Flow cytometry
Cells (pre-treated with either vehicle or 500 IU/ml IFN-γ for 
48 h) were trypsinized and harvested, followed by PBS wash 
to remove any residual components from culture medium. 
Cell pellets were resuspended in staining buffer (2% BSA in 
PBS) and 100 μl aliquot was incubated with PE-labeled anti-
PD-L1 antibody (329705, BioLegend) at 4 ℃ in the dark for 
15 min. After wash with staining buffer twice, cells were

resuspended in staining buffer for flow cytometry analysis 
on Gallios (Beckman Coulter).
PD‑1 binding assay
HCT116 (EV and STXBP6-overexpressing) and HepG2 
(control and STXBP6-knockdown) cells were placed on 
coverslips and pre-treated with IFN-γ for 48 h. After fixa-
tion with 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature, cells were 
sequentially incubated with recombinant human PD-1 Fc 
protein (1086-PD, R&D Systems) for 1 h and anti-human 
AF594 (A-11014, Thermo Fisher) for another 1 h at room 
temperature. Coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold/
DAPI (Invitrogen) and representative images were captured 
under confocal microscope (LSM800, Carl Zeiss).
Jurkat co‑culture IL‑2 production
HCT116 (EV and STXBP6-overexpressing) and HepG2 
(shNT, shSTXBP6-1 and shSTXBP6-2) cells were pre-
treated with IFN-γ for 24 h and then co-cultured with Jur-
kat cells at the ratio of 2:1 Jurkat: HCT116/HepG2. Jurkat 
cells were activated in advance with PMA (25 ng/ml, P1585, 
Sigma-Aldrich) and PHA (1 μg/ml, L2769, Sigma-Aldrich) 
for 24 h. Secreted IL-2 was determined at 48 and 72 h later 
with IL-2 Human ELISA Kit (Invitrogen) as recommended 
by provider.
Luciferase assays
Both PD-L1 (HPRM40139), STXBP6 (HPRM43060) pro-
moter reporter plasmids and secreted alkaline phosphatase 
(SEAP)-driven Gaussia luciferase (reference) were obtained 
from GeneCopoeia. The truncate mutations were gener-
ated by PCR splicing method and scrambled mutations 
were generated by mutagenesis PCR method, respectively. 
PD-L1 promoter reporter (wild type or truncate mutations) 
plasmids were co-transfected with either empty control or 
STXBP6-overexpressing plasmids into HCT116 for 6 h, and 
followed by IFN-γ exposure for 24 h. STXBP6 promoter 
reporter (wild type or scrambled mutations) plasmids were 
transfected into HCT116 cells for 6 h and subjected to IFN-γ 
exposure for 24 h. The culture medium was collected for 
relative luciferase activity determination with Secrete-Pair 
Luminescence Assay Kit (GeneCopoeia) in accordance with 
the manufacturer’s manual.
Immunohistochemistry
Human liver tumor tissue array was obtained from Alena-
Bio. The immunohistochemistry procedure was performed 
with Biotin-Streptavidin HRP Detection Systems (ZSGB-
BIO) and strictly complied with the provider’s instruction. 
Briefly, tissue section was first heated at 60 ℃ for 30 min, 
and followed by deparaffinization with xylene and rehydra-
tion with gradient ethanol solution. Antigen retrieval was 
performed in sodium citrated solution (0.01 M, pH 6.0) 
at 98 ℃ for 15 min in microwave oven. The endogenous 
peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% ­H2O2 in methanol 
at room temperature for 10 min, and tissue sections were 
blocked with 10% FBS in a humidified chamber at room 
temperature for 1 h. The primary antibody (mouse anti-
PD-L1, 405.9A11, Cell Signaling Technology; rabbit anti-
STXBP6, HPA003552, Sigma-Aldrich) was then incubated 
at 4 ℃ overnight, and followed by 15 min of incubation 
with biotin-labelled secondary antibody. After incubation 
with HRP-streptavidin at room temperature for 15 min, the 
section was detected with diaminobenzidine (DAB) and 
counterstained with hematoxylin. Images were captured 
under DMi8 Inverted Microscope (Leica).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Nuclear extracts were prepared from indicated cells using 
Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit (Beyo-
time). Oligo probes (with or without biotin labelling) 
were synthesized by Synbio. EMSA was performed with 
Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (GS009, Beyotime) follow-
ing the manufacturer’s instruction. For binding reaction, 
10 μg nuclear extracts, 20 fmole biotin-labeled probes, 
4 pmol competitor probes and 1 μg IRF1 antibody (D5E4, 
Cell Signaling Technology) were used. The mixtures 
were then resolved by 4% non-denaturing TBE-PAGE 
gel and transferred to nylon membrane (Beyotime). After 
crosslinking in UV-light cross-linker (Fisher Scientific) for 
45 s (254 nm, 120 mJ/cm2), the bands were detected with 
ECL Reagent (Millipore) and visualized using ChemiDoc 
Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
ChIP assay was performed using EZ-Magna ChIP A/G 
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Kit (17–10086, Mil-
lipore) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. 
Crosslinked chromatin was extracted from 1 × 106 cells 
and sheared into 200 ~ 1000 bp fragments by ultrasonica-
tion. 2 μg IRF1 antibody (sc-514544x, Santa Cruz) and 
20 μl protein A/G magnetic beads were then applied for 
incubation at 4 ℃ overnight with rotation. Immunopre-
cipitated complex was eluted and DNA fragments were 
recovered with Proteinase K digestion at 62 ℃ for 2 h. 
After purification using spin column, 2 μl DNA species 
were subjected to real-time PCR analysis as previously 
described.

Results
STXBP6 negatively regulates PD‑L1 expression
We first evaluated the potential impact of STXBP6 on 
PD-L1 expression in human colorectal carcinoma cell, 
HCT116 and hepatocellular carcinoma cell, HepG2. Sta-
ble cell lines of HCT116 with STXBP6-overexpression 
and HepG2 with STXBP6-knockdown were established 
in view of their endogenous expression levels and vali-
dated by both real-time PCR and western blots (Fig. 1a, 
Huh7 and HT29 cells in Figure S1). PD-L1 induction by 
IFN-γ was significantly compromised in STXBP6-procif-
icient HCT116 cells, while tremendously augmented in 
two individual STXBP6-silenced HepG2 cells (Fig. 1b, 
similar observations were obtained in Huh7 and HT29 cell 
shown in Figure S2). The inhibitory effect of STXBP6 on 
IFN-γ-stimulated PD-L1 expression was further validated 
at protein level (Fig. 1c). Likewise, cell surface PD-L1 
interrogated with both affinity antibody (Fig. 1d, S3) and 
recombinant human PD-1 Fc protein (Fig. 1e) exhibited 
consistent changes in both cell lines exposed to IFN-γ 
treatment. The functional influences of both STXBP6-
proficiency and -deficiency on T cell were evaluated by 
co-culture system, and secretory IL-2 was measured which 
represented a key player in the cell-mediated immune 
response in allograft rejection and indicated local immune 
activation [28]. STXBP6-overexpression significantly 
stimulated the secretion of IL-2 in Jurkat: HCT116 co-
culture medium, and opposite effects were observed in 
STXBP6-silenced HepG2 cells (Fig. 1f, S4). In addition, 
we also noticed the negative correlation between STXBP6 
and PD-L1 transcripts in panel of cell lines originating 
from breast, renal, cervical, ovarian cancers (Fig. 1g). The 
in vivo relevance was further confirmed by immunohisto-
chemical analysis, in which strong STXBP6 signaling was 
detected in the PD-L1-negative tissue section, and vice 
versa (Fig. 1h), and significantly negative correlation was 
observed based on IHC scores. Transcriptome analysis of 
clinical tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium 
(ICGC) on UCSC Xena platform revealed weak but sig-
nificant correlation between STXBP6 and PD-L1 mRNAs 
in range of cancer types (Fig. 1i), indicating a universal 
mode-of-action of STXBP6 on PD-L1 regulation.
The inhibitory effect of STXBP6 on PD‑L1 
is dependent on IRF1
We started the mechanistic investigation into inhibitory 
effect of STXBP6 on PD-L1 transcription with identifica-
tion of the critical cis-element on PD-L1 promoter. To this 
purpose, we generated serially truncate mutants of PD-L1 
promoter luciferase reporter plasmids, and co-transfection 
with STXBP6-expressing vector significantly inhibited wild-
type PD-L1 promoter-driven luciferase activity upon IFN-γ 
exposure (Fig. 2a). All truncations except for the -292 to -92 
nt deletion were shown to be subjected to the inhibition by 
STXBP6. Meanwhile, the induction of luciferase expression 
by IFN-γ was almost completely abrogated by destruction 
of -292 to -92 nt, which was in agreement with previously 
identified IRF1 responsive sites in this region. To pinpoint 
the sequences responding to STXBP6, we further conducted 
two-round EMSA assay with biotin-labelled overlapping 
probes spanning the region -292 to -92 nt. Incubation with 
nuclear extracts from HCT116 significantly retarded the 
mobility of fragments -215 to -148 nt, and prominent shift 
was observed with probe 3–2 (− 187 to – 148 nt, Fig. 2b). 
Notably, this shift was greatly abolished in the STXBP6-
overexpressing cells in comparison with control (Fig. 2c), 
suggesting the inhibitory effect of STXBP6 was highly 
likely mediated by disruption of interaction between trans 
factors with their cis-elements. Close inspection of this 
region yielded three putative IRF1 binding sites (JASPAR 
[29], Fig. 2d), which prompted us to clarify whether IRF1 
involved in STXBP6-regulated PD-L1 expression. Addi-
tion of IRF1-specific antibody in binding reaction led to 
remarkable super shift of retarded band, indicating that IRF1 
was indeed complexed with probe 3–2 (Fig. 2e). The IRF1 
expression remained constant at both transcript and protein 
levels in the context of either STXBP6-overexpression or 
-knockdown (Fig. 2f), which excluded the possibility that 
STXBP6 inhibited PD-L1 transcription through down-reg-
ulation of IRF1. However, we did detect the decrease of 
IRF1 occupancy on PD-L1 promoter in STXBP6-proficient 
HCT116 cells and increase in STXBP6-deficient HepG2 
while compared to control cells (Fig. 2g), suggesting that 
association of IRF1 with responsive element was compro-
mised by STXBP6.
Retention of IRF1 in cytoplasm by STXBP6
Next, we analyzed the subcellular localization of IRF1 and 
the absolute majority of intrinsic IRF1 was found in cyto-
plasm as indicated by immunofluorescence. With IFN-γ 
exposure, the small portion of induced IRF1 translocated 
into nuclear (circled) while the rest stayed outside nuclei 
(Fig. 3a). Interestingly, STXBP6 abundance remarkably 
influenced the re-distribution of IRF1 upon IFN-γ treatment,

and intranuclear IRF1 levels were tremendously decreased in 
STXBP6-overexpressing HCT116 and induced in STXBP6-
silenced HepG2 (Fig. 3b, c). We further conducted subcel-
lular fractionization analysis to validate the translocation 
of IRF1, western blots consolidated the immunofluores-
cence results (Fig. 3d). Notably, STXBP6 and IRF1 mani-
fested evident co-localization in naïve HCT116 and HepG2 
(Fig. 3e), which prompted us to speculate that cytosolic 
STXBP6 might restrain translocation of IRF1 into nucleus 
directly. To verify this hypothesis, we performed reciprocal 
immunoprecipitation with both anti-IRF1 and anti-STXBP6 
antibodies followed by western blot detection. The presence 
of STXBP6 in IRF1-immunoprecipitate was confirmed in 
lysates derived from both HCT116-STXBP6 and HepG2 
Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy	
1 3
cells, and IRF1 was detectable in STXBP6-immunoprecip-
itate as well (Fig. 3f). The interaction with STXBP6 might 
serve as fundamental mechanism to prevent unexpected 
entrance of IRF1 into nucleus and therefore abnormal acti-
vation of interferon signaling.
Nuclear IRF1 in turn inhibits STXBP6 expression
Surprisingly, we noticed that STXBP6 transcripts were sig-
nificantly down-regulated along with PD-L1 up-regulation 
by IFN-γ in both HCT116 and HepG2 cells (Fig. 4a, S5 left). 
Consistently, STXBP6 proteins accordingly decreased upon 
IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 4b, S5 right). Next, we employed two 
independent JAK2-specific inhibitors, AZD1480 and Fed-
ratinib, to simultaneously dose HCT116 and HepG2 cells 
while exposed to IFN-γ. As expected, both AZD1480 and 
Fedratinib potently inhibited IRF1 induction by IFN-γ at 
both transcript (Fig. 4c, S6) and protein (Fig. 4d) levels. 
Most importantly, the repressed STXBP6 in IFN-γ-exposed 
cells was almost completely restored by co-treatment with 
either AZD1480 or Fedratinib (Fig. 4e, S7), hinting the 
dependence of STXBP6 inhibition on JAK/STAT signaling. 
The assembling evidences were in support of the divergent 
roles of IRF1 in gene transcriptional regulation as either 
activator or repressor [30–34]. With aid of online bioinfor-
matics algorithm (JASPAR), we identified two putative IRF1 
binding sites (-1573 to -1562 nt and –1360 to -1349 nt) on 
STXBP6 promoter (Fig. 4f). STXBP6 promoter reporter 
luciferase was significantly inhibited by IFN-γ exposure 
in HCT116 cells, while scrambled mutation introduced 
in site 1 rather than site 2 completely abrogated this effect 
(Fig. 4g), which indicated the region -1573 to -1562 nt was 
the responsive element upon JAK/STAT signaling activa-
tion. We further analyzed the direct binding of IRF1 to 
STXBP6 promoter with ChIP assay. Results showed that 
STXBP6 promoter was greatly enriched in the IRF1 immu-
noprecipitated complex while exposed to IFN-γ for 24 h in 
both HCT116 and HepG2 cells (Fig. 4h). We noticed that 
despite of abundantly intrinsic IRF1 without IFN-γ expo-
sure, there was not evident enrichment of STXP6 promoter 
in this context which was mainly due to cytosolic subcel-
lular localization of non-induced IRF1. Upon stimuli like 
IFN-γ, IRF1 was dramatically induced and a small fraction 
translocated into nucleus to activate downstream signaling 
pathway. Meanwhile, intranuclear IRF1 specifically bound 
to STXBP6 promoter and suppressed its transcription. The 
down-regulated STXBP6 further facilitated the translocation 
of cytosolic IRF1 to augment the IFN-γ response.
STXBP6 promotes tumor specific T cell activity 
via suppression of PD‑L1 expression
To examine the influences of STXBP6 on tumor progression 
in vivo, we established STXBP6-overexpressing stable cell 
line derived from mice mammary carcinoma 4T1. The tumor 
growth was significantly suppressed in STXBP6-proficient 
group in comparison with control mice in the orthotopic 
xenograft tumor model with BALB/c mice (Fig. 5a). Con-
tinuous monitoring up to 15 days post-implantation consist-
ently displayed remarkable retardation of tumor progression 
in STXBP6-overexpressing mice than control (Fig. 5b) while 
with comparable body weights were recorded during experi-
mental window (Fig. 5c). Mechanistically, we demonstrated 
that STXBP6 over-expression significantly enhanced ­CD8+ 
T infiltration and accumulation in tumor mass (Fig. 5d). 
In view of the highly metastatic nature, we further evalu-
ated the distant dissemination of 4T1 cells in response to 
STXBP6 overexpression with quantitation of the clonogenic 
metastatic colonies in 6-thioguanine-containing medium. 
Likewise, both lung and liver metastasis were greatly com-
promised by ectopic STXBP6 (Fig. 5e). The persistently 
stable overexpression of STXBP6 and therefore inhibited 
PD-L1 levels in 4T1 xenograft tumor was validated at the 
endpoint of experiment (Fig. 5f).

Discussion
The clinical successes of immunotherapy against number of 
human cancers are heavily relied on the increasingly insight-
ful understanding of tumor immunology and especially 
mechanisms underlying immune escape of tumor cells. Here 
we unveiled that STXBP6, which was previously character-
ized involving in SNARE complex formation and exocytosis, 
potently retained IRF1 in cytoplasm and therefore inhibited 
PD-L1 expression. In response to IFN-γ stimuli, IRF1 increas-
ingly accumulated in cytoplasm and eventually saturated 
STXBP6, which consequently led to nuclear translocation of 
IRF1. Nuclear IRF1 then exerted transcription repressor role 
on STXBP6 expression in addition to transcriptional activa-
tion of interferon stimulated genes. The decrease in STXBP6 
further liberated more IRF1 to migrate to nucleus. Therefore, 
cytosolic STXBP6 constitutively blocked unexcepted entrance 
of IRF1 to nucleus, and upon IFN-γ stimuli, the positive feed-
back loop between induced IRF1 and STXBP6 predominantly 
instructed PD-L1 transcription (Fig. 6).
So far, the molecular events prime IRF1 for translocation 
into nucleus were relatively obscure. Based on frequent pat-
tern mining and linear motif scoring algorithm (seqNLS from 
Machine Learning & Evolution Laboratory, USC) [35], a pos-
sible nuclear localization signal (120–139 aa) was predicted 
positioning in the middle of IRF1 amino acid sequence. This 
prediction was consistent with a previous functional domain 
analysis performed by Schaper et al., who showed the NLS 
segment (116–139) was sufficient for nucleus localization 
of fused reporter GFP [36]. Accordingly, we hypothesized 
the intrinsic nuclear trafficking feature of IRF1, which was 
concealed by interaction with STXBP6 to retain IRF1 in

cytoplasm and exert yet unrecognized roles. IFN-γ stimu-
lated accumulation of cytosolic IRF1 and eventually led to 
active nuclear translocation of unbound IRF1 and activation 
of positive feedback loop between IRF1 and STXBP6. An 
alternate mechanism governed IRF1 translocation has been 
propose by Negishi et al. in elucidation of synergistic effect 
between IFN-γ and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in host defense 
against pathogens [37]. It’s suggested that via complexation 
with MyD88 adaptor, IRF1 was licensed and more effectively 
translocated to nucleus as indicated by photoconversion assay, 
which then enhanced target genes expression through coop-
eration with NF-κB in granulocyte/macrophage colony-stim-
ulating factor-cultured bone marrow-derived dendritic cells 
(GM-DCs). The authors also inferred that licensing of IRF1 
might involve undefined modification such as phosphorylation 
while unlicensed IRF1 was distributed mainly in cytoplasm 
and slowly migrated into the nucleus. This was in line with 
our data in respect of the cytosolic localization of constitutive 
and vast majority of IFN-γ-induced IRF1 via interaction with 
STXBP6. We have not experimentally addressed further 
whether MyD88 was involved in this scenario and instead pro-
posed a competitive relation between MyD88 and STXBP6 in 
determination of IRF1 subcellular distributions in the context 
of TLR activation. Low abundance of IRF1 was primarily 
retained in cytoplasm by STXBP6, while accumulated IRF1 
was competitively liberated through interaction with MyD88. 
The positive feedback loop between IRF1 and STXBP6 pro-
posed here was further endorsed by investigation from Luo 
et al., whose results showed that sequential treatments with 
two doses of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) significantly pro-
moted the nuclear concentration of IRF1 albeit predominantly 
cytoplasmic localization after first round of treatment [38]. It’s 
reasonable to speculate that initially brief exposure to ATRA 
down-regulated STXBP6 and therefore released the inhibitory 
effects on nuclear migration of induced IRF1 by subsequent 
stimulation.

Involvement in SNARE complex assembly was the solely 
recognized biological role of STXBP6 so far. The subsequent 
investigation provided suggestive evidence of STXBP6 SNP 
rs749373 for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) risk along 
with susceptible IRF8 loci [39]. Emerging evidences sup-
ported the critical involvements of IRF1 as an important 
inflammation mediator in SLE as well, as IRF1 fundamen-
tally interacted with multiple chromatin modifying enzymes 
in dysregulation of epigenome in this disease [40, 41]. Liu 
et al. demonstrated that enhanced inflammasome activity in 
monocyte derived from SLE patients was mediated by type 
I interferon-induced up-regulation of IRF1 [42], and higher

activation of the interferon-gamma signaling pathway was 
characterized in SLE with a high type I IFN score [43]. 
Based on our results in cancer, here we offered a hypothesis 
that STXBP6 and IRF1 might cooperate in the similar way 
in SLE in controlling IRF1 subcellular localization and the 
downstream signaling, which warranted further experimental 
clarification. Besides, given the functional diversity of IRF1 in 
host response to viral and bacterial infections, cell prolifera-
tion, apoptosis, DNA damage and repair, which necessarily 
depended on nuclear localization, the potential involvements 
of STXBP6 in these processing were to be defined in the 
future.
Summarily, we identified a positive feedback loop between 
IRF1 and STXBP6 in regulation PD-L1 expression in diverse 
human cancers, and suggested the anti-tumoral properties of 
STXBP6 via negative control of PD-L1 expression and there-
fore activation of tumor immune response. This was partially 
supported by three independent DNA methylation studies. 
Fernandez et al. first adopted an in vitro model of human 
breast epithelial cell transformation and identified DNA 
methylation and down-regulation of STXBP6 in transformed 
cells [44]. The following study performed by Lenka et al. ana-
lyzed the differentially methylated regions and differentially 
expressed genes in lung tumor with both methylated DNA 
immunoprecipitation combined with microarray (MeDIP-
chip) and gene expression microarray, and identified 4 candi-
date genes (STXBP6, BCL6B, FZD10, and HSPB6) that were 
significantly hypermethylated and downregulated [45]. The 
higher percentage of methylation in STXBP6 promoter was 
subsequently validated by Wang et al. in lung adenocarcinoma

In this regard, DNA demethylation would be a promising strat-
egy to treat STXBP6-low cancers. Our findings highlighted 
that STXBP6 level might be a valuable measure to predict the 
response to PD-1/PD-L1-based immunotherapy.
