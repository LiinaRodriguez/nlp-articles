BACKGROUND: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of death in women and novel imaging biomarkers are urgently required.
Here, we demonstrate the diagnostic and treatment-monitoring potential of non-invasive sodium (23Na) MRI in preclinical models
of breast cancer.
METHODS: Female Rag2−/−Il2rg−/−and Balb/c mice bearing orthotopic breast tumours (MDA-MB-231, EMT6 and 4T1) underwent
MRI as part of a randomised, controlled, interventional study. Tumour biology was probed using ex vivo ﬂuorescence microscopy
and electrophysiology.
RESULTS: 23Na MRI revealed elevated sodium concentration ([Na+]) in tumours vs non-tumour regions. Complementary proton-
based diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) linked elevated tumour [Na+] to increased cellularity. Combining 23Na MRI and DWI
measurements enabled superior classiﬁcation accuracy of tumour vs non-tumour regions compared with either parameter alone. Ex
vivo assessment of isolated tumour slices conﬁrmed elevated intracellular [Na+] ([Na+]i); extracellular [Na+] ([Na+]e) remained
unchanged. Treatment with speciﬁc inward Na+ conductance inhibitors (cariporide, eslicarbazepine acetate) did not affect tumour
[Na+]. Nonetheless, effective treatment with docetaxel reduced tumour [Na+], whereas DWI measures were unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS: Orthotopic breast cancer models exhibit elevated tumour [Na+] that is driven by aberrantly elevated [Na+]i.
Moreover, 23Na MRI enhances the diagnostic capability of DWI and represents a novel, non-invasive biomarker of treatment
response with superior sensitivity compared to DWI alone.

BACKGROUND
Metastatic breast cancer represents the leading cause of cancer-
related death in women worldwide [1], with the triple-negative
subtype associated with particularly poor prognosis [2]. Current
standard care pathways involve mammography, ultrasound,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biopsy for diagnostics
[3]. The inclusion of additional MRI modalities in care pathways
can
improve
outcomes
via
early
diagnosis,
structural
and
morphological assessment of tumours and monitoring of therapy
response [4]. Additional non-invasive MRI biomarkers could
therefore contribute a signiﬁcant clinical improvement.
Recent MR advances have aimed to address the unmet clinical
need for better patient stratiﬁcation. Dynamic contrast-enhanced
(DCE) 1H MRI, metabolic imaging (PET/MR) and hyperpolarized
pyruvate (13C labelled) approaches provide functional information
about neoangiogenesis [4] and tumour metabolic activity [5],
respectively. Unfortunately, these three approaches are invasive
and often limited by safety concerns (e.g. gadolinium-based
contrast agent accumulation) and/or requirements for complex
equipment [6]. As such, non-invasive, proton-based diffusion-
weighted imaging (1H DWI), which determines the local restriction
of water within a tissue through quantiﬁcation of the apparent
diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC), is now commonly used clinically for
detecting malignant breast lesions [4, 7]. Low ADC values are
correlated with malignancy and correspond with small extra-
cellular volume fractions and high cellularity [8–10]. Furthermore,
DWI demonstrates improved predictive value over conventional
DCE MRI [11].
Moving away from conventional proton-based imaging, pre-
vious studies indicate that non-invasive
23Na MRI of tumour
sodium concentration ([Na+]) could be a biomarker of malignancy
in breast cancer [8, 12, 13]. The receptivity of 23Na MRI is orders of
magnitude lower than that of 1H MRI [14] due to the lower tissue
concentration of Na+ vs H+ and the inherently lower gyromagnetic
ratio. However, technological advances (increased magnetic ﬁeld
strength, improved imaging gradients for fast-readout strategies)

have enabled 23Na imaging within clinically reasonable timeframes
[15]. Indeed, clinical evidence indicates that [Na+] is elevated
within malignant lesions compared with benign lesions [8, 12, 13];
moreover, two prospective clinical studies suggest that response to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy correlates with a decrease in tumour
[Na+] [12, 16]. Intriguingly, low ADC correlates with elevated total
tissue [Na+] in malignant lesions [8], suggesting a link between
high cell density and tumour [Na+]. As a result, 23Na MRI may have
utility for breast cancer diagnosis, risk-stratiﬁcation and monitoring
treatment response. However, elevated breast tumour [Na+]
remains poorly characterised, and urgent supporting data are
required for this approach to gain clinical footing and to
understand the underlying pathophysiology.
Identifying the location of tumour Na+ accumulation is critically
important for determining its pathophysiological impact. Increases
in total tumour [Na+] could reﬂect changes in intracellular sodium
([Na+]i), extracellular sodium ([Na+]e), or an increase in the
extracellular compartment volume [17]. Altered [Na+]i or [Na+]e
would have dramatic functional implications for tumour biology;
elevations in [Na+]e are proinﬂammatory, inhibit immune cell
function [18], and promote resistance to chemotherapy [19],
whereas elevations in [Na+]i (reported in cultured cancer cells
[20, 21] and in ex vivo tumour samples [22]) could reﬂect
alterations in processes dependent on the inward Na+ gradient
[17, 23]. Regarding the latter, many characteristics of invasive
tumours (e.g. cell migration, acidiﬁcation of the tumour micro-
environment) are regulated by inward Na+ transport [20, 24]. The
Na+ dependent Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1) regulates tumour pH
and metastasis [25]; NHE1 blockade with cariporide inhibits
tumour growth [26] and sensitises cancer cells to chemotherapy
[27]. Moreover, voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSCs) expressed in
breast cancer cells pass a persistent inward Na+ current, regulate
metastatic cell behaviour
and are inhibited
using existing
antiepileptic medications [20, 23, 28–31]. Determining the precise
location and mechanism of tumour Na+ accumulation could
therefore reveal novel druggable targets.
In this study, we used mouse models of breast cancer to assess
whether the effects of chemotherapy on breast tumour [Na+] are
reproducible beyond early clinical observations [12, 16] and
investigated whether speciﬁcally targeting Na+ conductance
mechanisms affects tumour [Na+]. To date, these questions have
not been addressed in preclinical in vivo models of breast cancer.
Our results indicate that multiple orthotopic tumour models
(MDA-MB-231, EMT6, 4T1) exhibit elevated tumour [Na+], thus
recapitulating the clinical picture. We provide ex vivo evidence
that the elevated tumour [Na+] reﬂects high [Na+]i rather than
[Na+]e and show that effective treatment with the chemother-
apeutic drug docetaxel reduces tumour [Na+] but is not reﬂected
by MR changes in ADC. Importantly, we show that while tumour
[Na+] has a similar predictive capacity to ADC for classifying
malignant regions, the combination of these parameters provides
superior prediction accuracy. These ﬁndings indicate that 23Na MRI
has utility as a non-invasive biomarker for both malignant disease
and treatment response, and position aberrant intracellular Na+
handling as a critical feature of malignant breast tumours that may
represent an important therapeutic target.
METHODS
Cell culture
All cells were cultured in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of air/CO2 (95:5%) at
37 °C and routinely tested for mycoplasma using the DAPI method. Cell
line sources, media and supplements are described in Supplementary
Methods.
Orthotopic breast tumour model
Rag2−/−Il2rg−/−(bred in-house, Balb/c background strain) or Balb/c
(Charles River Laboratories, UK; acclimatised for 2 weeks) mice were
housed in individually ventilated cages with enrichment (3–5 mice per
cage) in temperature-controlled rooms with access to water and food ad
libitum. At >6 weeks of age, female mice were anaesthetised (2%
isoﬂurane in oxygen (2 l/min)) and 5 × 105 MDA-MB-231 (Rag2−/−Il2rg−/−),
1 × 105 EMT6 or 1 × 105 4T1 (BALB/c) cells (suspended in Matrigel, 50% v/v
in saline, 50 µl of volume) were injected into the left inguinal mammary fat
pad. Animal weight, condition and tumour growth (calliper measurement)
were monitored daily. Where possible, tumour volume was calculated from
weekly multislice 1H scans; otherwise, tumour volumes were calculated
from calliper measurements (modiﬁed ellipsoidal formula, volume = 1/2
(length × width2) [32]. Mice were euthanized at <5 weeks after cell
implantation or at 15-mm tumour diameter and tumours isolated.
Drug treatment interventional studies
Tumour-bearing mice were randomised (blocked by cage) to receive either
vehicle or drug treatment from day 7 post tumour cell implantation
(docetaxel 10 mg/kg in 1:1:20 ethanol:Tween 20:5% glucose in H2O once
weekly i.p., total 18 mice across six cages, docetaxel n = 11, vehicle, n = 7;
cariporide 3 mg/kg in 50:1 PBS:DMSO once daily i.p., total 10 mice across 3
cages, cariporide n = 5, vehicle, n = 5; ESL, 175 or 200 mg/kg in 0.5%
methylcellulose suspension once daily p.o., total 7 mice across 2 cages, ESL
n = 4, vehicle, n = 3). No power calculation for sample sizes was performed
as there is no prior study on which this could be based. Drug stocks were
prepared as follows: docetaxel, ethanol (ﬁnal dilution 4% v/v); cariporide,
DMSO (ﬁnal dilution 2%); ESL was directly suspended in the vehicle.
MRI
All experiments were performed on a 7T preclinical MRI system (Biospec
70/30 USR AVANCE III, Bruker Biospin) with a 12 channel RT-shim system
(B-S30) and preinstalled 660mT/m imaging gradient set (BGA-12s, Bruker).
Data were captured using Paravision 6.0.1 software. Details of the MRI
transceive coils used and all acquisition sequence settings for 23Na MRI and
1H DWI are described in Supplementary Methods.
All live-animal experiments were performed with a NaCl phantom (50
mM, 1.5-ml centrifuge tube, inner diameter 8.2 mm) to enable normal-
isation of signal between animals. Imaging was performed at 2, 3 and
4 weeks (MDA-MB-231 xenografts) or at 7 days (4T1 and EMT6 xenografts)
post implant. Animals without palpable tumours were excluded. Mice were
anaesthetised (2% isoﬂurane in 2 l/min O2) and breathing monitored using
a pressure-sensitive pad (MR-Compatible Model 1025 Monitoring and
Gating System, SAII, NY, USA) throughout. Body temperature was
maintained at 37 °C using a water-heated bed.
Ex vivo SBFI ﬂuorescence imaging
Following euthanasia (week-4 MRI timepoint), tumours were isolated and
sliced (200 µm) in chilled phosphate-buffered saline using a 5100 MZ
vibratome (Campden Instruments Ltd). Tumour slices were loaded with
SBFI-AM (10 µM) in HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution (HEPES-
PSS: 144 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.28 mM CaCl2, 5 mM HEPES
and 5.6 mM glucose, pH 7.2) with 0.08% Pluronic F-127 for 2 h at 37 °C,
then rinsed and incubated in fresh HEPES-PSS for 40 minutes. Microscopy
equipment used for SBFI ﬂuorescence imaging is described in Supple-
mentary Methods.
Na+-free HEPES-PSS was prepared by replacing NaCl with equimolar N-
methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG, 144 mM). HEPES-PSS for calibrating [Na+]i was
prepared containing 10, 20 and 50 mM NaCl, with additional KCl added in
place of omitted NaCl (149.4 mM NaCl + KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.28 mM CaCl2,
5 mM HEPES, 5.6 mM glucose, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH). Following
baseline measurement, slices were perfused with 10 mM [Na+]e. Na+
ionophores
(gramicidin,
3 µM;
monensin,
10 µM)
were
applied
to
equilibrate [Na+]i and [Na+]e and a Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor (ouabain, 1
mM) was applied to inhibit Na+ efﬂux. [Na+]e was sequentially changed to
20 mM and 50 mM [33]. [Na+]i was calibrated in situ to control for
differences between cells using the ﬁnal three acquisition frames for each
perfusion phase.
Ion-selective microelectrodes
Methods for producing Na+ ion-selective microelectrodes and use of
associated recording hardware are described in Supplementary Methods.
Isolated tumours were sliced (500 µm) as described for ex vivo SBFI
ﬂuorescence imaging and then maintained at 30 °C at an interface
between HEPES-PSS perfusion and humidiﬁed air. Electrodes were
calibrated with HEPES-PSS of variable [Na+] (48, 96, 144 and 192 mM, no

replacement ion) prior to and after recording. Sensitivity (mV/mM) typically
changed by no more than 5% over the duration of an experiment.
Recordings were taken from the top surface of tumour slices and from
different locations within each slice. The junction potential offset between
the bath and calibration tube was subtracted from the recorded voltage.
All recordings were made within 90 min of euthanasia.
Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
Total tissue [Na+] was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS, 7700x, Agilent). ICP-MS analysis and quantiﬁcation
of tissue [Na+] are described in Supplementary Methods.
LC-MS analysis of plasma and tumour [licarbazepine]
Tissue samples from xenograft tumours were snap-frozen and homo-
genised in chilled 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 5, 1:4 w/v). Lysate
preparation and analysis by LC-MS are described in Supplementary
Methods.

and
plasma
[licarbazepine]
are
reported
as

licarbazepine per mg tumour (ng/mg) and ng/µl, respectively.
Immunohistochemistry
Cryoprotected tumour samples (sequential overnight incubations in 4%
paraformaldehyde, 10% sucrose, 30% sucrose) were embedded and frozen
in optimal cutting temperature embedding compound (VWR Interna-
tional). Samples were sectioned (12 µm, LEICA CM1950 cryostat) onto
SuperFrost Plus™Adhesion slides (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA) and
immunohistochemistry performed using a rabbit anti-Ki67 primary anti-
body (1:500; Abcam AB15580) with an Alexa-568-conjugated goat anti-
rabbit secondary antibody (1:500; Invitrogen). Sections were mounted in
Prolong Gold with DAPI (Invitrogen) and scanned (Zeiss AxioScan.Z1 slide
scanner, ×20 magniﬁcation).
Data analysis
MRI image processing, within the MATLAB R2019b (MathWorks, MA)
environment, was performed blinded. Regions of interest (ROI) covering
the tumour, phantom and contralateral non-tumour tissue were manually
selected using geometry matched, high-resolution 1H TurboRARE struc-
tural images (see Supplementary Methods). Per subject, mean and
maximum 23Na signal data from these ROIs were all normalised by the
phantom ROI (50 mM NaCl). ROI size was also used to estimate tumour
volume. For data acquired using the
23Na surface coil, images were
corrected for B1 ﬁeld inhomogeneity prior to processing. Field correction
utilised a prior 1/r2 correction based upon images from a suitable 1 M NaCl
phantom.
DWI data were analysed using RStudio version 1.2.5033 (RStudio Inc.,
MA). ADC was calculated from the mean ROI signal, S, as ADC = −ln(S/S0)/
b, where b corresponds to the calculable degree of diffusion weighting
applied (based upon diffusion gradient timings and applied gradient
strength—see Supplementary Methods) in s/mm2 and S0 is the signal
intensity with b = 0 (also commonly referred to as an A0 image).
Classiﬁcation analysis was completed in RStudio version 1.2.5033.

23Na MRI reveals elevated [Na+] in orthotopic xenograft tumours. 23Na imaging was performed in Rag2−/−Il2rg−/−mice bearing
orthotopic MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumours at 2, 3 and 4 weeks post implantation. Representative images are shown for MRI performed using
a bespoke 3 cm 23Na surface coil (a, 23Na 2D gradient-echo cartesian acquisition (2D cartesian)) or a commercial dual-tuned 1H/23Na volume
coil (b, 23Na 2D cartesian; c 23Na 3D gradient-echo spiral out acquisition (3D spiral)). Regions of interest (ROIs) are annotated (tumour, red
region; non-tumour, blue region). Mean and maximum 23Na signals were normalised to a NaCl phantom (50 mM) to provide a concentration
measurement. Mean and maximum 23Na signals for tumour vs non-tumour regions are shown for the 23Na surface coil (d, e, 23Na 2D cartesian,
n = 3 mice at all timepoints) and dual-tuned 1H/23Na volume coil (f, g 23Na 2D cartesian. Week 2, n = 5; week 3, n = 6; week 4, n = 5. h, i 23Na

and non-tumour at each individual timepoint calculated using an unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test. A mixed-effects model indicated that
the effect of time was not statistically signiﬁcant.

determined with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). We followed
this approach due to the limited size of the training datasets (Fig. 2e, f). A
further independent test set (vehicle group, Fig. 4) was used to
compare models trained on maximum 23Na signal vs ADC. Principal
component analysis was performed using the prcomp() function
and “factoextra” package [34]. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with
LOOCV was performed using the “MASS” package [35]. The receiver-
operating characteristic curve was determined using the “ROCR”
package [36].
To calibrate [Na+]e, ISME recordings from standards were ﬁtted to a non-
linear regression (Padé (1,1) approximant), and tumour slice recordings
were interpolated. Similarly, SBFI ﬂuorescence recordings for each
calibration step were ﬁt to non-linear regression (n = 3 experiments,
one-phase
association)
and
resting
[Na+]i
(baseline
ﬂuorescence)
interpolated.
Quantiﬁcation of Ki67-positive nuclei (as a percentage of nuclei count,
DAPI) was performed using ZEN 3.2 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and
ImageJ 1.53c (NIH, public domain) particle count (50 pixels minimum size)
with the Classic Watershed method applied [37].
All statistical comparisons were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.3.1
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Normal data distribution was
conﬁrmed using Shapiro–Wilk tests. Statistical comparisons at each
independent timepoint were performed with unpaired, two way Student’s
t tests. Correlations were assessed using Pearson’s r tests. Comparisons
between tumour models (Fig. 6) were performed using one-way ANOVA
with post hoc Tukey test for multiple comparisons.

RESULTS
23Na MRI reveals elevated tumour [Na+] in a preclinical model
of triple-negative breast cancer
Orthotopic MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumours represent a model of
highly invasive, triple-negative breast cancer. Across a 4-week
longitudinal study, 23Na MRI revealed tissue [Na+] is signiﬁcantly
elevated within MDA-MB-231 xenografts compared with contral-
ateral non-tumour regions (Fig. 1a–c, tumour growth shown in
Supplementary Fig. 1a). 23Na signal was linear with [NaCl] (0–100
mM, Supplementary Fig. 1b–e). The observation that [Na+] was
signiﬁcantly elevated within tumours was independent of coil
setup, readout method and TR. A 3 cm
23Na surface coil (B1
corrected,
23Na 2D gradient-echo Cartesian acquisition [2D
Cartesian], Fig. 1a) revealed signiﬁcantly elevated maximum 23Na
signal (increased 2.5-fold at week 3, Fig. 1e) and mean 23Na signal
(increased 0.9-fold at week 3, Fig. 1d) in tumour regions compared
with non-tumour regions. A dual-tuned linear 1H/23Na volume coil
(23Na 2D Cartesian, Fig. 1b) also detected a signiﬁcantly higher
mean
23Na signal (increased 1.3-fold at week 3, Fig. 1f) and
maximum 23Na signal (increased 1.6-fold at week 3, Fig. 1g) in
tumour regions compared with non-tumour regions.
23Na 3D
gradient-echo spiral out acquisition [3D spiral] with the dual-tuned
volume coil (Fig. 1c) also found signiﬁcant elevations in both mean
23Na signal (increased 0.5-fold at week 3, Fig. 1h) and maximum
23Na signal (increased 0.8-fold at week 3, Fig. 1i) in tumour regions
compared with non-tumour regions. Lower normalised
23Na
signals from 3D spiral acquisition reﬂect variable T1 relaxation
times between phantom and tissue and a shorter acquisition
repetition time (23Na 2D Cartesian, TR = 50 ms; 23Na 3D spiral, TR
= 10 ms). Shorter TR times for the 3D acquisition were required to
increase the number of scan repetitions within a set 10-min
scanning period. Core temperature was monitored/maintained
using pumped warm water. No subject displayed signs of
excessive heating due to RF exposure. It is noted that in order
to minimise T1 saturation inﬂuences, within-group comparisons

[Na+]i is elevated in live xenograft tumour slices. a Following week-4 imaging, tumours were acutely isolated, divided and prepared
for inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, b) analysis or ex vivo measurements of [Na+]i and [Na+]e. Healthy mammary
glands (HMGs) from naive female mice were included in ICP-MS analysis. c Total tissue [Na+] in MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumours (n = 10) and
HMGs (n = 11). d MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumour slices (200 µm) were loaded with SBFI-AM (10 µM) and immobilised for imaging. Baseline
SBFI ﬂuorescence was recorded during perfusion with HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution (PSS) containing 144 mM NaCl. e To
calibrate [Na+]i for each cell in situ, perfusion was switched to 10 mM NaCl, followed by application of the ionophores (red arrow) gramicidin
(3 µM), monensin (10 µM) and ouabain (1 mM). Tumour slices were sequentially perfused with 20 mM and 50 mM NaCl. The ﬁnal three frames
acquired during each phase were used to determine the average ﬂuorescence for each calibration step. f [Na+]i during the baseline PSS phase
(red point) was calibrated (n = 3 slices from two separate animals, 11–16 cells per experiment, F/F0) using non-linear regression (one-phase
association). g Concurrently, Na+ ion-selective microelectrodes (ISMEs) calibrated with PSS of variable [Na+] (48 mM, 96 mM, 144 mM, 192 mM,
no replacement ion) were used to measure [Na+]e (red point) in MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumour slices (500 µm, n = 6 slices from six separate
animals, 12 recordings per slice; h). Recordings were interpolated using non-linear regression (Padé (1,1) approximant). Data represent group

same coil/sequence parameters over the longitudinal growth
measure. Signals are presented normalised to the in-plane
phantom ROI (50 mM). Thus, while data may not be quantitative
in terms of absolute mM concentrations, normalised changes over
time remain a valid observation (T1 tissue times are not expected
to vary much over 5 weeks). Results thus conﬁrm elevated tumour
[Na+] within the MDA-MB-231 preclinical breast cancer model.
23Na MRI improves the predictive potential of ADC for the
classiﬁcation of malignant lesions
Low ADC correlates with high cellularity, malignancy and elevated
tumour [Na+] [8–10, 38]; 1H DWI is used as an adjunct imaging
modality for assessing malignant breast lesions in the clinic [7]. To
determine whether tumour [Na+] is similarly an important
biomarker of malignancy, we used machine learning approaches
to compare the predictive power of tumour [Na+] vs ADC in
classifying tumour (MDA-MB-231 xenografts) vs non-tumour
regions. Across all timepoints, ADC was consistently signiﬁcantly
lower in tumour regions than in non-tumour regions (0.7-fold
lower at week 3, Fig. 2a, b), as expected. Interestingly, tumour
volume was not correlated with either ADC (Fig. 2c) or 23Na signal
(Fig. 2d), indicating that both parameters were independent of
tumour size. However, In line with clinical observations [8], ADC
(all timepoints/regions pooled) was inversely correlated with both

maximum 23Na signal (r = −0.750; Fig. 2e) and mean 23Na signal
(r = −0.697; Fig. 2f).
To compare whether the mean or maximum
23Na signal
performed better at classifying tumour vs non-tumour regions, we
used data from Fig. 2e and f to train two single-variable LDA
models and performed LOOCV. The maximum
23Na signal
achieved a classiﬁcation accuracy of 92.9%, whereas the mean
23Na signal achieved 89.3%. It was hypothesised that the reduced
classiﬁcation accuracy of mean 23Na signals was a consequence of
tumour heterogeneity and/or partial volume effects due to slice
thickness used. Notably, current technology levels and 23Na-MR
signal insensitivity necessitates the use of low-resolution imaging
and thick imaging slices to compensate and improve SNR. The
maximum 23Na signal was therefore carried forward for compar-
isons with ADC. Principal component analysis of maximum 23Na
signal and ADC reported clear separation of tumour and non-
tumour regions (95% concentration ellipses, Fig. 2g). The distinct
opposing direction and similar size of the associated loading
vectors (Fig. 2g, black arrows) demonstrate that maximum 23Na
signal and ADC are inversely correlated yet hold almost equivalent
dominance along principal component 1, suggesting that these
variables are equally important for explaining variance between
the tissue groups.
To test the comparative predictive capacity of maximum 23Na
signal vs ADC, we trained LDA models (data from Fig. 2e) and
classiﬁed novel data taken from an independent experimental
cohort (docetaxel vehicle group, Fig. 4). LDA models trained on
maximum 23Na signal alone or ADC alone achieved accuracies of
81.2%, while the model trained on a combination of both
parameters achieved an accuracy of 96.9%. The maximum 23Na

signal or ADC single parameter models achieved sensitivities of
0.76 and 0.71 and speciﬁcities of 0.87 and 0.93, respectively,
whereas the combined parameter model achieved a sensitivity of
0.94 and a speciﬁcity of 1.0. Moreover, the area under the ROC
curve (AUC) for each of the models was 0.92 for 23Na, 0.95 for ADC,
and 1 for the two parameters combined (Fig. 2h; confusion
matrices presented in Supplementary Fig. 2). Together, these data
indicate that the model that incorporates both parameters is
optimal, with greater accuracy, speciﬁcity, and sensitivity for
determining malignant lesions from non-tumour regions.
Elevated tumour [Na+] is due to increased [Na+]i
In agreement with 23Na MRI, inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS) identiﬁed signiﬁcantly higher total tissue
[Na+] in MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumour samples (46.9 ± 5.4 mM)
compared with healthy mammary glands from naive mice (29.7 ±
1.9 mM, Fig. 3a −c). Identifying the compartmentalisation of this
Na+ accumulation is critically important to determine its impact
on tumour pathophysiology. Because low ADC in tumours
indicates a larger intracellular volume fraction (IVF) compared
with non-tumour regions, elevated tumour [Na+] is unlikely to
reﬂect an increased extracellular volume fraction (EVF). We
hypothesised that elevated tumour [Na+] instead reﬂects an
increased [Na+]i. To test this, we used complementary ex vivo
approaches to measure [Na+]i and [Na+]e within acutely isolated
live MDA-MB-231 tumour slices.
The Na+ selective dye SBFI-AM (10 µM) and in situ calibration
(dynamic range comparable to that previously described [33]
Fig. 3d −f) revealed that resting [Na+]i in tumour slices was 25.9 ±
1.0 mM (n = 3 slices, 11 −16 cells per slice, two separate animals;
Fig. 3f). This is higher than that expected in healthy mammalian
cells (5 −15 mM) [39] and yet is in line with previous in vitro
ﬂuorescence studies in cancer cell lines [20, 21, 40]. In contrast,
Na+-selective microelectrodes [41] (Fig. 3g) showed that tumour
slice [Na+]e was 157.8 ± 1.0 mM (n = 6 slices, 12 recordings per
slice, six separate animals; Fig. 3h). This is within the expected
serum [Na+] range for female BALBc mice [42]. These results
indicate that elevated tumour [Na+] is due to increased [Na+]i
while [Na+]e is unchanged.
Detection of docetaxel treatment response by 23Na MRI in
MDA-MB-231 xenografts
Two prospective clinical studies with small-cohort sizes (n = 15 [12]
and n = 5 [16] patients) found that elevated [Na+] in malignant
breast lesions was reduced in patients responding to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. We sought to determine whether chemotherapy
response can be detected using 23Na MRI in tumour-bearing mice
using a randomised, controlled, interventional study approach.

Mice received docetaxel (10 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle once weekly
from week 1 post MDA-MB-231 xenograft implantation. Docetaxel
treatment signiﬁcantly inhibited tumour growth; at week 3,
tumour volume within the treatment group was 32.2% of that
within the vehicle group (Fig. 4e). Docetaxel treatment also
signiﬁcantly reduced Ki67-positive nuclei within tumour sections
by 52.7% (Fig. 4f, g) despite no change in nuclei count (Fig. 4h).
Moreover, docetaxel treatment conferred a signiﬁcantly lower
maximum
23Na signal within tumour regions compared with
control mice (37.8% lower at week 3, Fig. 4a, c), suggesting that
localised changes in tumour [Na+] reﬂect clinical response.
However, no difference was observed between docetaxel and
control groups for either mean tumour 23Na signal (Fig. 4b) or
isolated tissue sample [Na+] (ICP-MS, Supplementary Fig. 3). The
difference between the maximum and mean
23Na signals
potentially reﬂects important intratumoural heterogeneity requir-
ing improved MRI resolution to probe further.
Previous studies indicate that low ADC correlates with elevated
Ki67 expression [43]. We performed DWI to assess whether
treatment response was reﬂected in ADC. In agreement with the
tumour section nuclei counts, there was no difference in ADC
between the control and docetaxel groups (Fig. 4d). These data
indicate that the docetaxel-induced change in tumour [Na+] was
not due to altered cellularity, suggesting that tumour [Na+] might
provide improved treatment monitoring over ADC.
Effect of cariporide and eslicarbazepine acetate on tumour
[Na+]
Many Na+ channels and transporters that utilise the inward
electrochemical Na+ gradient are implicated in tumour progres-
sion [17]. Thus, elevated tumour [Na+]i could reﬂect increased Na+
transporter activity. We, therefore, investigated whether inhibition
of either NHE1 (cariporide) or VGSCs (eslicarbazepine acetate, ESL)
reduces elevated [Na+] within MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumours.
ESL and its major active metabolite (S)-licarbazepine [44] inhibit
inward Na+ current in MDA-MB-231 cells [45], and was selected
due to its preferred use in the clinic compared to older VGSC-
inhibiting antiepileptic medications such as phenytoin [46].
Moreover, cariporide was administered at a dose that previously
exhibited efﬁcacy in in vivo models of cancer [26, 27].
ESL treatment (200 mg/kg daily p.o. from day 7 post implant) had
no effect on the mean (Fig. 5a, b) or maximum (Fig. 5a, c) tumour
23Na signal compared with untreated control mice. Similarly, ESL had
no effect on tumour volume (Fig. 5d). Cariporide (3 mg/kg daily i.p.
from day 7 post implant) also did not reduce mean or maximum
tumour 23Na signal compared with untreated control mice; in fact,
there was a signiﬁcant increase in mean 23Na signal at week 2 and
maximum 23Na signal at week 3 (0.55- and 0.44-fold, respectively;
Fig. 5e −g). Nevertheless, cariporide had no effect on tumour
growth, in agreement with previous ﬁndings (Fig. 5h) [47]. There was
also no effect of ESL (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b) or cariporide
(Supplementary Fig. 4c, d) on VGSC gating or current density
measured in ex vivo tumour slices. This was despite achieving plasma
[licarbazepine] (1 hour post dosing: plasma, 6.5 ± 0.9 ng/µl; tumour,
4.5 ± 0.8 ng/mg, n = 3 tumours) comparable to that showing clinical
antiepileptic efﬁcacy [48]. Similarly, docetaxel had no effect on VGSC
gating or current density in treated ex vivo tumour slices compared
to controls (Supplementary Fig. 4e, f), suggesting that the docetaxel-
induced change in tumour [Na+] is not mediated via an effect on
VGSCs. Taken together, these data indicate that ESL and cariporide at
the current doses elicit no detectable decrease in tumour [Na+], and
suggest that targeting multiple Na+ transporters may be required to
alter elevated tumour [Na+] in vivo.
Tumour [Na+] is elevated across multiple murine models of
breast cancer
To conﬁrm the clinical relevance of these ﬁndings, we next
assessed whether elevated tumour [Na+] is a common feature
across other orthotopic murine models of breast cancer. We
selected the EMT6 (Fig. 6a) and 4T1 (Fig. 6b) murine mammary
carcinoma cell lines, which form solid tumours in immunocompe-
tent BALB/c mice. These cell lines give rise to luminal A tumours
that are weakly ER-positive, claudin-low (EMT6) and ER-negative
and non-claudin low (4T1). Moreover, these models exhibit
signiﬁcant
immunogenicity
and
leucocytic
inﬁltration,
with
EMT6-derived tumours exhibiting higher GR1 + granulocyte and
CD3 + T-cell inﬁltration [49].
EMT6 and 4T1 tumours grew rapidly after implantation (Fig. 6f),
reaching a similar size at 1 week post implant to MDA-MB-231
cells at 4 weeks post implant; no difference was observed in Ki67
density between the two models (Fig. 6g). At 1 week post implant,
23Na MRI revealed elevated [Na+] in both EMT6 (Fig. 6a) and 4T1
(Fig. 6b) tumours. In 4T1 tumours, mean
23Na signal was
signiﬁcantly elevated compared with non-tumour regions (0.5-
fold increase, Fig. 6c). Similarly, maximum
23Na signal was
signiﬁcantly elevated (onefold increase, EMT6; 1.8-fold increase,
4T1; Fig. 6d) within tumour regions compared with non-tumour
regions. Interestingly, 4T1 tumours exhibited signiﬁcantly higher
mean 23Na signal compared with EMT6 or MDA-MB-231 tumours
(0.7-fold and 0.2-fold increases, respectively; Fig. 6c). These results
suggest that although elevated tumour [Na+] is consistent across
multiple models of breast cancer, the absolute tumour [Na+] is
variable, hinting at important underlying biological differences in
tumour Na+ handling. However, in contrast to the MDA-MB-231
model, no signiﬁcant difference was observed in ADC between
tumour and non-tumour regions in EMT6 and 4T1 models (Fig. 6e).
Similar to [Na+], these data suggest that tumour ADC is variable
across these models. Importantly, however, given that elevated
tumour [Na+] was identiﬁed by 23Na MRI in the 4T1 model but no
difference was seen in ADC, 23Na MRI might in certain cases be
better positioned than DWI to discern malignancy.
DISCUSSION
This study is the ﬁrst to demonstrate that tumour [Na+] is elevated
relative to non-tumour regions in the orthotopic MDA-MB-231
xenograft and 4T1 and EMT6 allograft models of breast cancer.
Moreover, while supervised classiﬁcation algorithms trained on
23Na MRI data achieved similar accuracy to those trained on DWI
data (ADC) in distinguishing tumour vs non-tumour regions, a
model trained on both parameters combined achieved superior
classiﬁcation accuracy, suggesting that 23Na MRI holds promise as
a novel diagnostic readout. Using a randomised, controlled study
approach, we show that docetaxel, a clinically used antineoplastic
drug that disrupts microtubule formation, reduces maximum
tumour [Na+] while slowing tumour growth rate but has no effect
on ADC. These ﬁndings suggest that 23Na MRI also has utility as a
readout of response to chemotherapy, and may be better suited
for this purpose than DWI. These ﬁndings broadly conﬁrm for the
ﬁrst time in a randomised, controlled, interventional study design,
the chemotherapy response effect reported in previous small-
cohort clinical observational studies [12, 13]. We show in intact
breast tumour slices that elevated tumour [Na+] reﬂects increases
in [Na+]i, while [Na+]e is unaltered. This aberrant intracellular Na+
handling sheds light on a previously underappreciated character-
istic of malignant breast lesions and has considerable implications
for pathophysiological processes linking ion homoeostasis to
tumour cell function.
The ﬁnding that tumour [Na+] is elevated within mouse models
of breast cancer is consistent with previous clinical breast cancer
studies [8, 12, 13]. Ouwerkerk et al. reported that mean total tissue
[Na+] was ~53 mM (n = 19 patients) in malignant lesions and ~26
mM in benign lesions (n = 3 patients) [13]. Similarly, Zaric et al.
reported a mean total tissue [Na+] of ~69 mM in malignant lesions
compared with ~35 mM in normal glandular tissue (n = 17
patients) [8]. These values are broadly in agreement with our

ICP-MS and 23Na MRI data. However, our ﬁnding that maximum
23Na signal improves distinction of tumour vs non-tumour regions
compared to mean 23Na signal potentially reﬂects considerable
heterogeneity of [Na+] within tumours. Indeed, despite the limited
spatial resolution, we observed clear variability in 23Na signal
across the tumour regions (Figs. 1, 4, and 6). This heterogeneity
could also explain why docetaxel treatment conferred a reduced
maximum 23Na signal within tumours despite no difference in
mean 23Na signal. This has broader implications for prognosis,
since intratumoural heterogeneity is considered a key contributor
to resistance to chemotherapy [50], and suggests a potential link
between local changes in tumour [Na+] and cancer cell function
that could be discerned using
23Na MRI. The realisation of
improved spatial speciﬁcity for 23Na MRI would enable incorpora-
tion of tumour [Na+] heterogeneity within more complex
analyses. Indeed, a recent study coregistering tumour section
histology with 1H parameters (including DCE MRI and DWI) found
that DCE MRI could distinguish distinct tumour subregions [51].
Inclusion of (or replacement with) non-invasive 23Na readouts
would offer an important additional dimension to such functional
imaging methods. We note that future work should quantify 23Na
T1 relaxation parameters to better describe absolute millimolar
tissue concentrations from
23Na MRI data. However, current
technology limits and the insensitivity of 23Na MRI necessitates the
use of short TR times to increase averages to gain SNR - especially
when multiparametric measures (e.g. diffusion, 23Na and structural
imaging) are required from the same animal model. Future work
could also explore use of Tm3+ based complexes/shift reagents
with chemical shift-based imaging to separate blood pool, intra
and extracellular compartments of the Na+ signal [52].
This study establishes that elevated tumour [Na+] coregisters
with a low ADC within preclinical models of breast cancer, and
that these parameters are inversely correlated across non-
cancerous and malignant lesions, recapitulating previous clinical
observations [8]. These ﬁndings suggest a functional link between
high cellularity and Na+ accumulation in tumours, supporting the
notion that elevated tumour [Na+] is likely due to changes within
the intracellular compartment. Interestingly, principal component
analysis revealed that ADC and maximum 23Na signal held almost
equivalent importance when explaining variance across all regions
(tumour and non-tumour). LDA models trained on either 23Na
signal or ADC were comparable in their ability to correctly classify
regions. However, a model trained on both variables achieved
superior classiﬁcation accuracy. One can therefore hypothesise
that their predictive resolutions do not completely overlap (see
Supplementary Fig. 2) and are complementary.
While recent recommendations have been published [53], there
is as yet no clearly established consensus on optimal DWI
methodology or a threshold ADC value with which to denote
malignancy [54]. DWI sensitivity and ADC quantiﬁcation are
inﬂuenced by differences in methodology (i.e., choice of b values,
magnet strength) and tumour heterogeneity [55, 56], thereby
preventing the establishment of a generalised threshold ADC value.
Moreover, a negative correlation between ADC and high cellularity
is not universally apparent in all cancer subtypes [38]. Taken
together with the improved statistical discrimination of 4T1 and
EMT6 tumours by 23Na MRI vs DWI, our classiﬁcation results suggest
that combining DWI with 23Na MRI could improve speciﬁcity and
predictive accuracy in the clinic, enabling superior non-invasive
diagnostic and treatment monitoring beyond DWI alone.
This study is the ﬁrst to report an effect of docetaxel on tumour
[Na+] in the preclinical setting. Two small, prospective clinical
studies in patients with breast cancer previously measured
signiﬁcant reductions (27%, n = 15 patients [12]; 21%, n = 5
patients [16]) in total tissue [Na+] using
23Na MRI following
response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In this study, docetaxel
treatment conferred slower tumour
growth and decreased
maximum tumour 23Na signals (37.8% lower than the vehicle
group at week 3). However, we do not currently know the
mechanism underlying this, nor whether the decrease in tumour
[Na+] contributes to, or is a consequence of, treatment response.
Nonetheless, treatment with docetaxel did not decrease ADC,
suggesting a mechanism other than altered cellularity; for
example, decreased tumour vascularity (docetaxel is antiangio-
genic). These data suggest that, in certain circumstances, 23Na MRI
may be better positioned to discern treatment response than DWI.
Beyond breast cancer, contrasting observations have been
made in ﬁbrosarcoma and gliosarcoma models where cyclopho-
sphamide or carmustine treatment, respectively [57, 58] led to a
correlated increase in both 23Na signal and ADC. The authors
concluded that
23Na signal and ADC both report the same
physiological event, namely decreased cellularity and increased
EVF. This is in contrast to the present study, where tumour ADC
was unchanged yet maximum 23Na signal decreased following
docetaxel treatment. These conﬂicting ﬁndings suggest that
tumour [Na+] responses differ depending on cancer type and
choice of chemotherapeutic intervention.
This study provides direct evidence from intact, live MDA-MB-
231 tumour slices that elevated tumour [Na+] arises due to an
intracellular accumulation of Na+; [Na+]i was 25.9 mM within the
tumour slices (expected upper physiological bound for [Na+]i is
~15 mM [39]). This is in agreement with our DWI results, which
suggest that EVF is decreased in tumours vs non-tumour regions,
and that elevated tumour [Na+] must therefore reﬂect an increase
in either [Na+]i or [Na+]e. Moreover, tumour slice [Na+]e was
within the expected physiological range for female BALB/c mouse
serum (~157 −160 mM [42]), indicating that elevated tumour
[Na+] is not due to changes in [Na+]e. Interestingly, our observed
[Na+]i is similar to that recently extrapolated (~30 mM) from
complementary 23Na and 1H DCE MRI approaches in patients with
triple-negative breast cancer [59]. Furthermore, although at the
limit of statistical distinction, intracellular-weighted 23Na imaging
determined that [Na+]i is elevated in prostate tumours compared
with adjacent healthy tissue [60]. Given the small size of MDA-MB-
231 xenograft tumours, similar [Na+]i measurements could be
enabled by improvements to 23Na contrast to noise ratio that are
subsequently sacriﬁced to increase spatial resolution [61].
Using a simpliﬁed model, the relative EVF to IVF of xenograft
tumours can be estimated from values obtained from the present
study.
If
total
tissue
[Na+] = (1 −EVF) × [Na+]i + EVF × [Na+]e,
where EVF = 1 −IVF [13], EVF and IVF can be resolved for given
values of [Na+]i, [Na+]e and total tissue [Na+]. For our tumour slice
[Na+]i and [Na+]e values (25.9 and 157.8 mM, respectively) and the
observed total tumour [Na+] (46.9 mM), we expect an EVF of 0.159
and IVF of 0.841. Keeping these EVF and IVF values constant and
rearranging the above equation for healthy mammary gland
[Na+]i (total tissue [Na+] = 29.7 mM) with an assumed [Na+]e of
158 mM [42] returns a value of 5.4 mM; this is within the expected
physiological range [39]. However, this simpliﬁed model does not
take into account changes to the EVF:IVF ratio in tumours relative
to healthy tissue, nor the blood or ductal compartments. Using
shift reagents, one can quantify the contribution of these
compartments with magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging
[62]; however, this would be invasive and therefore of limited
clinical use.
An elevated [Na+]i has important implications for cancer cell
function, as it would impact upon processes governed by Na+-
linked channels and transporters [17]. For example, Na+/K+ ATPase
is the predominant consumer of intracellular ATP [63], and its
activity increases across the [Na+]i physiological range (5 −15 mM)
[64], suggesting full activation in tumours exhibiting a [Na+]i of
~26 mM. This has important implications for aberrant cancer
metabolism [17], Similarly, mitochondrial Na+/Li+/Ca2+ exchanger
activation by elevated [Na+]i (Km ~ 12 mM) [65] could alter
mitochondrial function and bioenergetics. Processes altered by
elevated [Na+]i could therefore represent novel therapeutic loci.
A.D. James et al.
346
British Journal of Cancer (2022) 127:337 – 349
On the other hand, the elevated [Na+]i could reﬂect increased
Na+ channel or transporter activity [17]. For example, cancer cell
pH and migration are regulated by the activity of NHE1 [25], and
VGSCs aberrantly expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells pass a persistent
inward
Na+
current
and
regulate
metastasis
[23,
29–31].
Pharmacological data suggest that functional VGSCs may also
be present in 4T1 cells [66]; however, their expression status in
EMT6 cells is unknown. Plasma membrane Na+ channels and
transporters are attractive pharmacological targets as they are
easily accessible to small-molecule inhibitors and are already
targeted by clinically approved drugs. However, in contrast to
docetaxel, selective inhibition of either NHE1 or VGSCs (cariporide
or ESL, respectively) did not reduce elevated tumour [Na+] in the
present study at clinically relevant doses. On the other hand, we
saw no effect of docetaxel treatment on VGSC gating properties or
peak current density in ex vivo tumour slices, despite a decrease in
maximum tumour 23Na signal (evidence suggests taxanes can
modulate VGSC activity in MDA-MB-231 cells [67]). Although we
cannot rule out subtle, localised changes in [Na+] beyond the
sensitivity of the present MRI approach, these results suggest that
alternative
Na+-dependent
transporters
are
responsible
for
elevated tumour [Na+]i [17].
In conclusion, this study highlights
23Na MRI as a novel
diagnostic biomarker for breast cancer diagnosis and readout of
response to chemotherapy. In addition, we elevate the importance
of altered [Na+]i handling in breast tumour pathophysiology, and
identify altered tumour [Na+] as a common characteristic of
preclinical breast cancer models. The inclusion of non-invasive
23Na MRI in the patient care pathway may therefore represent an
important clinical reﬁnement in the ﬁght against breast cancer.
Supported by these results, the future development of non-
invasive 23Na MRI with improved contrast to noise ratio [61]
(sacriﬁced to increase spatial resolution) will further empower its
use for diagnostics and exploring tumour heterogeneity and
function.
