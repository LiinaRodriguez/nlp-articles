Diagnostic Pathology
Artificial intelligence’s impact on breast 
cancer pathology: a literature review
Amr Soliman1, Zaibo Li1 and Anil V. Parwani1* 
Abstract 
This review discusses the profound impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on breast cancer (BC) diagnosis and manage-
ment within the field of pathology. It examines the various applications of AI across diverse aspects of BC pathology, 
highlighting key findings from multiple studies. Integrating AI into routine pathology practice stands to improve 
diagnostic accuracy, thereby contributing to reducing avoidable errors. Additionally, AI has excelled in identifying 
invasive breast tumors and lymph node metastasis through its capacity to process large whole-slide images adeptly. 
Adaptive sampling techniques and powerful convolutional neural networks mark these achievements. The evaluation 
of hormonal status, which is imperative for BC treatment choices, has also been enhanced by AI quantitative analysis, 
aiding interobserver concordance and reliability. Breast cancer grading and mitotic count evaluation also benefit 
from AI intervention. AI-based frameworks effectively classify breast carcinomas, even for moderately graded cases 
that traditional methods struggle with. Moreover, AI-assisted mitotic figures quantification surpasses manual counting 
in precision and sensitivity, fostering improved prognosis. The assessment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in triple-
negative breast cancer using AI yields insights into patient survival prognosis. Furthermore, AI-powered predictions 
of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response demonstrate potential for streamlining treatment strategies. Addressing 
limitations, such as preanalytical variables, annotation demands, and differentiation challenges, is pivotal for realizing 
AI’s full potential in BC pathology. Despite the existing hurdles, AI’s multifaceted contributions to BC pathology hold 
great promise, providing enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and standardization. Continued research and innovation 
are crucial for overcoming obstacles and fully harnessing AI’s transformative capabilities in breast cancer diagnosis 
and assessment.

Graphical Abstract
Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has caused a paradigm change 
in the world of industrial activity, and its remarkable 
effects are expected to spread to the field of pathology in 
medicine. AI is the capacity of robots to emulate or equal 
human intelligence (HI) [1]. Machine learning, deep 
learning, neural networks, natural language processing, 
computer vision, and cognitive computing are all key 
components of AI. The main goal of AI is to create tech-
nology that enables computer systems to function intel-
ligently and independently, producing results that are on 
par with, if not better than, those of HI [2, 3].
Deep learning aims to enhance accuracy and minimize 
human error, alongside pathologists without replacing 
their role, fostering a collaborative approach for improved 
diagnostic outcomes [1]. Deep learning has emerged as a 
promising tool for assisting in the diagnosis and grading 
of breast cancer (BC), identifying lymph node metasta-
sis, and providing prognostic and predictive information. 
This is significant as BC is the leading cancer type among 
women (over 10% in several European countries and the 
US) [4–6]. The use of AI algorithms in BC is also gain-
ing popularity. Integrating these AI algorithms into the 
digital workflow can greatly help pathologists by making 
their work more efficient and accurate. It reduces repeti-
tive tasks such as counting mitoses and detecting lymph 
node metastases and helps reduce diagnostic errors. 
Researchers have used large, high-quality datasets to 
develop computer programs that can detect metastasis to 
lymph nodes [7]. Additionally, AI algorithms can provide 
new tools for pathologists to handle emerging assess-
ments. Moreover, these algorithms may even be able to 
replace some expensive molecular tests used in breast 
pathology [8]. Breast cancer treatment has evolved, with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) now commonly used, 
especially for locally advanced cases. With the help of AI, 
it has become possible to predict the effect of neoadju-
vant chemotherapy [9].
However, the large variability in digital images caused 
by variations in preanalytical laboratory techniques, 
staining methods, and scanners might make subsequent 
image analysis difficult, which is a major factor in the lack 
of robustness validation for many AI systems [10–13].

2.	 Predictive (Table 2): It explores the use of AI to pre-
dict specific outcome or treatment response in BC 
patients. This includes the quantification of biomark-
ers including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone 
receptor (PR), HER2 and Ki-67 (some of these are 
also prognostic factors) for targeted therapy, the 
response to NAC and risk categorization for adjuvant 
chemotherapy in ER-positive/HER2-negative breast 
cancer.
3.	 Prognostic (Table  3): This review investigates the 
use of AI to assess prognostic features in BC, such as 
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), mitosis count-
ing and grading levels.
Subsequently, we elucidate the existing commercial 
platforms (Table  4) that facilitate the incorporation of 
artificial intelligence into breast cancer research.
AI in breast cancer diagnosis
Accurate histopathological diagnosis is crucial for BC as 
patient numbers surge and pathologist resources dwindle 
[3]. Therefore, efforts have been made to overcome this 
concern. Fondón et  al. [16] presents a computer-aided 
diagnosis (CAD) tool for automated malignancy assess-
ment of breast tissue samples. The method utilizes histo-
logical images and calculates three sets of features related 
to nuclei, color regions, and textures. The method was 
evaluated rigorously using cross-validation and exter-
nal image sets, achieving accuracy levels ranging from 
61.11% to 75.8%. The results demonstrate the tool’s capa-
bility to accurately distinguish between four malignancy 
levels (normal, benign, in situ, and malignant) and out-
perform other state-of-the-art methods based on feature 
extraction. This approach has the potential to enhance 
the CAD of BC and improve early diagnosis, contribut-
ing to the prevention of avoidable deaths. Another study, 
conducted by Cruz-Roa et  al. [11] introduce a method 
called high-throughput adaptive sampling for whole-
slide histopathology image analysis (HASHI). Traditional 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) struggle with 
large WSIs due to the enormous number of parameters 
required. HASHI addresses this issue by using an effi-
cient adaptive sampling method and a powerful CNN-
based classifier. The method was trained and validated 
on three different data cohorts involving nearly 500 cases 
and independently tested on 195 studies from The Can-
cer Genome Atlas. The results showed that the adaptive 
sampling method effectively handles WSI, achieving 
comparable accuracy with fewer samples. The HASHI 
demonstrated 
effectiveness 
and 
robustness 
across 
different sites, scanners, and platforms, with an average 
Dice coefficient of 76% on an independent test dataset. 
The efforts have even been extended to include a study 
performed in the Middle East, specifically in Morocco, by 
El Agouri et al. [17]. This study aims to develop a deep 
learning-based approach for the efficient classification 
of BC histopathological images. Despite the limited data 
size used in this study, the classification model demon-
strated good generalization performance, high accuracy, 
and sensitivity in detecting carcinoma rates, indicating 
the potential of the model to assist the pathologist in pre-
cise BC diagnosis.
The transition from the preinvasive stage of ductal 
carcinoma in  situ (DCIS) to invasive ductal carcinoma 
(IDC) is a pivotal event in breast cancer progression [28]. 
Myoepithelial cells play a crucial role in the clinical diag-
nosis of DCIS and IDC. Their presence serves as a signifi-
cant diagnostic criterion for pathologists. Additionally, 
when evaluating fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology 
smears, the number of myoepithelial cells aids in differ-
entiating between benign proliferative breast disease and 
invasive tumors [29]. A study conducted by Yamamoto 
et al. [14]. demonstrated that machine learning systems 
can classify different histological types of intraductal 
proliferative lesions based solely on subtle morphologi-
cal variations observed in myoepithelial cells that cannot 
be detected by the human eye and without considering 
epithelial tumor cells. This study reveals that myoepithe-
lial cell nuclei in DCIS lesions exhibit a distinct flattened 
shape that can be recognized through computational 
methods. Additionally, a biological mechanism based on 
paracrine cross-talk mechanism has been proposed to 
explain the progression of DCIS to IDC. This highlights 
the potential of using machine learning algorithms to 
enhance our understanding of BC pathology and improve 
diagnostic accuracy in identifying specific subtypes of 
intraductal proliferative lesions.
Metastasis location is crucial in BC staging, for which 
patch-based frameworks are commonly used. These 
frameworks extract fixed-size patches from whole slide 
images to train a CNN classifier that detects tumor 
regions. Histopathologists analyze whole slide images 
to identify tumor features and metastasis regions, but 
this process is time-consuming and prone to errors [30]. 
Additionally, efficiency is a challenge due to overlapping 
regions, leading to computational redundancy. Wang 
et al. [4] addressed this challenge by introducing a new 
two-stream network for identifying tumor metastasis 
cells in whole slide images. Scan-based frameworks uti-
lize fully CNNs for faster inference by using arbitrary 
image blocks. Multiresolution image pyramids, combin-
ing multiple magnification patches, can improve perfor-
mance and promise in BC metastasis location tasks and

achieve impressive results, with a high FROC score. This 
method also indicates a faster inference time compared 
to existing approaches. Moreover, the study demon-
strated the effectiveness of the high magnification net-
work, which also contributed to the high FROC score. A 
recent application, by Challa et al. [18] proposes the use 
of a digital imaging analysis “metastasis AI” detection app 
(Visiopharm Integrator System metastasis AI algorithm) 
to screen lymph nodes for metastases in BC patients, 
aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and pathologists’ 
efficiency. The AI algorithm demonstrated an overall 
sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%, 
making it a promising screening tool before pathologists’ 
review of H&E-stained slides. The app’s integration with 
the clinical workflow reduced the need for immunohisto-
chemical staining in some cases. However, the study had 
limitations, including a retrospective design and the need 
for pathologists to carefully review and confirm positive 
cases identified by the AI algorithm. Steiner et  al. [15] 
reviewed lymph node metastasis in two modes: unas-
sisted and assisted by the algorithm. The results showed 
that the algorithm-assisted pathologists had higher accu-
racy, especially in detecting small cancer cells. The review 
time per image was also shorter with the algorithm’s 
assistance. Pathologists found it easier to classify images 
when using the algorithm. Overall, the study suggests 
that using a deep learning algorithm can improve accu-
racy and efficiency in digital pathology.
Prediction of breast cancer behavior
The Ki-67 index is used to provide information about 
the growth rate and aggressiveness of the tumor. How-
ever, the evaluation of Ki67 proliferation has long been a 
subject of uncertainty among pathologists, necessitating 
the development of a standardized method to assess this 
important factor. A study by Abele et al. [10] assessed the 
Mindpeak Breast Ki-67 RoI and Mindpeak ER/PR RoI 
for quantifying Ki-67, ER, and progesterone receptor PR 
in breast cancer. This tool demonstrates reliability and 
receives confirmation from most pathologists across a 
wide range of image variances and indicates the potential 
of AI assistance to enhance interobserver agreement and 
improve the reliability of immunohistochemical scoring 
in real-world clinical settings. However, could we depend 
only on AI for this analysis? In this retrospective study, 
by Bodén et  al. [19] Ki67 areas were assessed using a 
human-in-the-loop digital image analysis (DIA) method, 
and the results were compared with visual and automatic 
approaches. The analysis revealed that visual estimation 
performed significantly worse than DIA alone and DIA 
with human-in-the-loop corrections, as indicated by a 
higher standard deviation of the error in the Ki67 index. 
While the addition of human-in-the-loop corrections 
did not improve the overall results, it proved valuable 
in addressing major DIA errors related to faint staining 
and tumor-stroma separation on an individual case basis. 
The study suggests that human-in-the-loop corrections 
primarily serve to rectify significant weaknesses in DIA 
applications rather than refining quantifications. A recent 
study by Shafi et al. [20] used Visiopharm automated ER 
DIA, having a fully automated digital workflow with elim-
inating manual intervention for ER immunohistochem-
istry. The process involves scanning ER IHC slides and 
streaming them directly into the digital platform with-
out downloading/uploading. The results demonstrate a 
high concordance (93.8%) between automated DIA and 
pathologists’ manual scoring, making it a reliable tool for 
determining ER status in breast carcinoma. While there 
are some pitfalls identified, adjustments to the algorithm 
or manual annotation can address them effectively. The 
integration of automated DIA into routine clinical work-
flow is shown to be feasible, potentially saving time and 
labor for pathologists. Moving to HER2, this is the first 
study to investigate the correlation between the response 
to anti-HER2 NAC and HER2 protein expression using 
digital image analysis (Visiopharm HER2-CONNECT 
App) in HER2 + BC patients. The study demonstrates an 
excellent correlation between HER2 DIA connectivity 
and clinical outcomes in patients treated with anti-HER2 
NAC. This DIA provides an objective and quantita-
tive assessment of HER2 protein expression and shows 
potential as a predictive factor for achieving a pathologi-
cal complete response (pCR). Additionally, HER2 DIA 
values are moderately associated with HER2 FISH copy 
numbers/ratios, suggesting that HER2 copy number may 
be more accurate in predicting HER2 protein expression 
than the HER2/CEP17 ratio [13]. To validate this applica-
tion, one of the largest studies in this regard involved 612 
invasive breast carcinomas. The data demonstrate that 
HER2 IHC DIA is a reliable method for measuring HER2 
protein expression, with excellent concordance (87.3%) 
with pathologists’ manual scoring and a 16% reduction in 
equivocal case numbers. The study also shows that HER2 
IHC DIA accurately distinguishes HER2 FISH-positive 
and -negative cases, although a small number of discord-
ant cases (0.8%) were observed. The HER2 IHC connec-
tivity value correlates better with HER2 copy number 
than the HER2/CEP17 ratio, suggesting that it may be a 
more accurate predictor of HER2 protein expression and 
response to anti-HER2 targeted therapy [12].
Predicting the effectiveness of NAC prior to admin-
istration is crucial to avoid unnecessary treatments. 
A promising approach was conducted by Shen et  al. 
[9] This study aims to predict the effectiveness of NAC 
in BC patients using AI analysis of H&E images of pre-
chemotherapy needle biopsies. A novel pipeline system 
Page 12 of 18
Soliman et al. Diagnostic Pathology           (2024) 19:38 
has been developed, consisting of three independent 
models focusing on different cancer atypia characteris-
tics. This system achieved an impressive 95.15% accuracy 
in predicting NAC response in a test set of 103 cases. 
The authors suggest that this AI system could contrib-
ute to personalized medicine in NAC therapy for breast 
cancer. A recent study by Aswolinskiy et  al. [22] intro-
duces interpretable computational biomarkers such as 
TILS, PROACTING segmentation-based biomarkers 
and mitotic count derived from H&E stained slides, for 
predicting the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
in breast cancer. The approach contrasts with existing 
deep-learning models, offering greater interpretability 
through hypothesis-driven biomarkers. The PROACT-
ING biomarkers show potential in predicting patho-
logical complete response (pCR). Particularly, the TILs 
biomarker exhibits promising sensitivity in TNBC and 
Luminal B cohorts, suggesting its clinical application 
for distinguishing responders from non-responders and 
reducing overtreatment. The study emphasizes the broad 
applicability of computational biomarkers, especially in 
routine clinical practice with H&E staining, and high-
lights considerations for improved model applicability 
and TIL scoring interpretation. Another study by Sae-
dnia et  al. [23] introduces a hierarchical deep learning 
framework for predicting breast cancer response to NAC 
using digital histopathological images. Unlike the previ-
ous study, this model incorporates a patch-level pro-
cessing module, a tumor-level processing module, and 
a patient-level response prediction module, providing 
a comprehensive approach. The use of a self-attention-
guided convolutional network based on the CoAtNet 
architecture at the patch level, coupled with ViT models 
at the tumor level, enhances the extraction of local infor-
mation within tumor patches. The study emphasizes the 
significance of combining convolutional and self-atten-
tion modules, demonstrating superior performance in 
extracting informative features. Importantly, the hierar-
chical model outperforms two-level and patch-level-only 
models in predicting NAC response. The study further 
explores the importance of systematic strategies for fus-
ing patch and tumor-level information on both tumor 
and patient levels, showcasing the necessity of a nuanced 
approach for more accurate predictions. Last, this recent 
study by Huang et al. [21] uses AI algorithms to achieve 
the same purpose. This approach provided robust and 
reproducible feature extraction, including information 
about the tumor immune microenvironment, such as 
TILs by developing of a whole slide image (WSI) feature 
extraction pipeline, named IMPRESS, that quantita-
tively evaluates histopathological features extracted from 
both H&E-stained and IHC-stained WSIs. Unlike previ-
ous studies, this research leverages the paired H&E and 
IHC images, enabling a robust and reproducible feature 
extraction pipeline at the WSI level. The integration of 
IHC-stained images provides detailed tumor immune 
micro-environment information, enhancing the char-
acterization of the tumor microenvironment. The study 
further demonstrates the interpretability and predictive 
accuracy of the AI-based automatic feature extraction 
pipeline, outperforming models based on pathologists’ 
assessments and producing abundant reproducible inter-
pretable features. Additionally, the investigation of clin-
icopathologic features in two breast cancer subtypes, 
HER2 + and TNBC, unveils common and different fea-
ture behaviors, highlighting the immunogenic nature of 
breast cancer.
Whitney et  al. [31] investigated the use of computer 
analysis to predict BC risk categories determined by the 
Oncotype DX test. They extracted various nuclear mor-
phology features from 178 patients’ images and used 
machine learning classifiers to identify the most dis-
criminating features. The study found that computerized 
image analysis could potentially predict the Oncotype DX 
risk categories for early-stage estrogen receptor-positive 
breast cancer. The accuracy of the models ranged from 75 
to 86% when tested on an independent validation set.
AI and breast cancer prognosis
AI has the potential to serve as an assisting tool for 
pathologists in grading breast carcinoma, contributing 
to a more standardized and efficient diagnosis and sub-
sequent predictable prognosis. Breast carcinoma with a 
moderate grade (known as NHG 2) has been an area of 
concern. They are often difficult to categorize using con-
ventional methods because they have similarities with 
low-grade (NGH1) and high-grade tumors (NHG3) [6]. A 
study conducted by Mantrala et al. [27] focused on eval-
uating the concordance between AI and pathologists in 
grading breast carcinoma. The study developed an auto-
mated framework based on deep learning to assess the 
Nottingham Grading System (NGS). The results revealed 
a moderate level of concordance for the overall grading. 
Importantly, there were no significant differences in con-
cordance between pathologists alone and pathologists 
combined with AI. Wang et al. developed a new method 
called DeepGrade to classify this specific category 
(NHG2) more accurately. This method helps provide 
more consistent and precise grading. The results show 
that DeepGrade can also predict the prognosis of NHG2 
tumors as effectively as other methods that analyze gene 
expression using regular stained tissue samples, which is 
faster and more cost-effective. DeepGrade can also pro-
vide additional information about the aggressiveness of 
the tumor, which can help doctors make decisions about 
Page 13 of 18
Soliman et al. Diagnostic Pathology           (2024) 19:38 
	
the best treatment options, especially for certain types of 
BC and de-escalation of chemotherapy in particular [6].
The evaluation of mitosis in BC is important for prog-
nosis, as it serves as a significant prognostic marker. 
Counting mitotic figures helps determine the grading 
of the tumor and aids in treatment decisions. Inter- and 
interlaboratory variation in manual mitotic count pre-
sents a challenge, which AI coupled with whole slide 
imaging aims to address. Pantanowitz et  al. [24] evalu-
ated the use of AI in quantifying mitotic figures in whole 
slide images of invasive breast ductal carcinoma. In this 
study, readers of different expertise levels then counted 
mitotic figures with and without AI assistance. The find-
ings demonstrated improved accuracy, precision, and 
sensitivity with AI support across all experience levels 
while also reducing false positives and saving 27.8% of 
time. The study concludes that AI can enhance the preci-
sion and efficiency of mitotic figure quantification, lead-
ing to standardized pathology practices and generating 
enthusiasm among pathologists for integrating AI into 
routine tasks such as mitotic counting. Even in phyllodes 
tumors, accurate mitosis counting is important for grad-
ing. This study, by Chow et al. [25], aimed to determine 
the best method for counting mitotic figures in phyllodes 
tumors using digital pathology. They compared count-
ing mitoses in 10 high-power fields (HPFs) and counting 
mitoses on the WSI. Both methods showed similar cor-
relations with tumor grade, stromal atypia, and stromal 
hypercellularity. However, neither method showed signif-
icant correlations with patient age or tumor size.
Approximately 15% of breast cancers are classified 
as triple-negative, which has an aggressive nature and a 
high risk of recurrence [32]. Tumor-infiltrating lympho-
cytes are considered an important prognostic biomarker 
for TNBC [33, 34]. A higher density of TILs is associ-
ated with an improved prognosis [35]. Consequently, it 
is fundamental to assess the quantity of TILs accurately 
and precisely to better understand and manage TNBC. 
Balkenhol et al [26] explored diverse methods for objec-
tively assessing TILs using immunohistochemically 
stained sections, correlating findings with patient out-
comes. Employing automated deep learning analysis for 
TIL assessment, we scrutinized CD3, CD8, and FOXP3 
markers in various tumor regions. Results revealed a 
consistent negative correlation between TIL abundance 
and recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival 
(OS), irrespective of markers or measurement regions. 
Ratios between markers (CD3/CD8) were found to be 
poorly prognostic and discouraged. Despite the recog-
nized prognostic value of TILs in breast cancer, a lack of 
standardized assessment methods hinders comparability 
across studies. Current protocols, such as those proposed 
by the International TIL Working Group (ITWG) [36], 
often prioritize feasibility and cost reduction. This com-
putational pathology approach demonstrated the robust-
ness of TILs as biomarkers, unaffected by methodological 
variables, suggesting potential for data-driven optimiza-
tion of assessment protocols. Focusing on TNBC, exclu-
sively assessing tumor stroma, as per ITWG guidelines, 
did not compromise prognostic value. The study suggests 
that TILs serve as reliable biomarkers, emphasizing their 
stability across markers and measurement regions. While 
influenced by the Immunoscore consortium’s method-
ology used in colon cancer [37], this study found both 
intra-tumoral and margin TILs to contain prognostic 
information. Combining multiple markers through ratios 
did not enhance prognostic value, questioning the need 
for more than one marker in TNBC TIL assessment. Uti-
lizing multiplex immunohistochemistry and deep learn-
ing, the aim is to minimize human subjectivity. Despite 
concerns about accessibility, the study anticipates wide-
spread AI implementation in pathology diagnostics, 
translating results into essays using straightforward 
staining protocols.
Limitations
The integration of AI-driven solutions in BC diagnos-
tics is transforming the landscape of pathology practices. 
These innovative tools empower healthcare profession-
als, improve accuracy, and provide standardized assess-
ments, leading to better patient care and outcomes. As 
AI technology continues to advance, we can expect even 
more sophisticated solutions that further revolutionize 
BC diagnostics and treatment approaches, offering hope 
for a future where BC becomes more manageable and 
treatable.
1-	Both pathologists and the AI tool encountered chal-
lenges in scoring due to restrictions stemming from 
various preanalytical variables. Poor sample qual-
ity, staining artifacts, the presence of air bubbles, 
and unfamiliar staining patterns posed difficulties 
in accurately assessing the samples. These factors 
adversely affected the performance of both human 
pathologists and the AI tool in scoring the samples. 
It highlights the importance of addressing preanalyti-
cal variables to improve the accuracy and reliability 
of scoring methods in pathology [10–13].
2-	In terms of metastatic localization and marking 
numerous pixels in each image, such extensive man-
ual annotation can be challenging and may hinder 
the efficiency and scalability of the algorithm. This 
process is labor-intensive and time-consuming [4]. 
In addition, the multiple-pipeline AI system to pre-
dict the efficacy of NAC relies partially on manual 
sampling of ROIs from annotated cancer regions [9]. 
Page 14 of 18
Soliman et al. Diagnostic Pathology           (2024) 19:38 
Additionally, automatic annotations for ductal carci-
noma (DCIS) in situ were not available through using 
Deep Grade method to categorize the breast NHG2 
tumors and method of HASHI to detect the inva-
sive part. This limitation could affect the accuracy of 
the method and to overcome it, manual annotations 
DCIS would be necessary [6, 11].
3-	Standardization of mitosis counting and lack of 
agreement on area size for mitosis counting: There is 
a need to establish standardized methods for count-
ing mitoses, including determining the area to count 
in the whole WSI. It is recommended to count multi-
ple screens at × 40 magnification to achieve a 3 mm2 
area size, equivalent to 10 high-power fields (HPF) 
of a standard microscope with a 0.62 field diameter 
[38]. The use of H&E-stained tissue sections may lead 
to the potential omission of mitotic figures due to tis-
sue or imaging artifacts. The incorporation of addi-
tional biomarkers, such as Phosphorylated Histone 
H3 (PHH3), could have helped objectively confirm 
the presence of mitotic figures [24].
4-	Regarding the use of this innovative crowdsourcing 
dataset method called scalable variational Gaussian 
processes (SVGPCR), the process of quantizing seg-
mentation annotations to the patch level results in a 
loss of detail, which may limit its effectiveness in rep-
resenting fine details in segmentation problems [39].
5-	The lack of a uniform and established assessment 
method for TILs in BC leads to difficulty in compar-
ing studies and a need for guidance in larger valida-
tion studies. A study, by Balkenhol et al. [26] focused 
specifically on TNBC, and the generalizability of the 
findings to other BC subtypes is unknown. The seg-
mentation of tumor cells using automated algorithms 
was not optimal for some tumors, potentially intro-
ducing noise to the analysis.
6-	The algorithm used in the study of Steiner et al. [15] 
could detect metastatic tumors but did not provide 
information on the positioning of these foci within 
the lymph nodes or specific diagnostic features. 
Additionally, there is increasing worry about the 
potential for overreliance on the algorithm, and the 
impact of this issue has not been investigated yet by 
researchers.
7-	Some issues do not directly limit the use of AI in 
pathology. For instance, incorporating a broader 
range of cases can improve the representation and 
generalizability of AI models. Furthermore, consider-
ing additional prognostic features and investigating 
the influence of staining and scanning variations can 
help optimize the performance and applicability of 
AI algorithms in real-world clinical settings [31].
Future directions
Exploring accuracy improvements in AI assistance 
through controlled ROI selection, investigating the 
impact of AI tools on diagnostic speed and interob-
server variance, addressing ethical considerations, and 
ultimately enhancing overall accuracy for personalized 
patient treatment [10]. Regarding fast cancer metastasis 
detection, further research is needed to limit the use of 
pixel annotations through the usage of a two-stream net-
work for learning histopathological images, especially in 
metastasis localization. This approach can enhance effi-
ciency and facilitate faster analysis of large-scale data-
sets. This approach holds the potential for accelerating 
the identification of cancer metastases and could have 
broader implications for high-throughput histopatho-
logical image analysis [4]. The prospect is not limited 
to detection only but should extend to determine the 
clinical utility and value of assistive tools. By developing 
tools that offer detailed information about tumor foci, 
such as their position in relation to lymph nodes or spe-
cific diagnostic characteristics (extranodal extension and 
lymphovascular invasion), the accuracy of diagnoses can 
be improved. It is also important to assess how assistive 
reads impact the use of additional diagnostic tests, the 
categorization of prognosis, and the organization of cases 
based on algorithm predictions. These evaluations will 
provide valuable insights into the benefits of intelligent 
tools in digital pathology [15, 18].
In the multiple AI pipeline system to predict the NAC 
response, the task involves developing an AI system capa-
ble of automatically identifying and classifying specific 
nuclear phenotypes exhibited by different cancer sub-
types. This requires implementing advanced automation 
techniques within the AI system, enabling it to analyze 
and interpret complex nuclear features from histopatho-
logical images or other relevant data sources. By achiev-
ing full automation, the AI system would streamline the 
process of identifying distinct nuclear phenotypes asso-
ciated with various cancer subtypes, potentially leading 
to more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment 
strategies [9].
Further research is needed to establish a standardized 
and data-driven approach for assessing TILs as prog-
nostic biomarkers in breast cancer. Larger studies are 
required to evaluate the superiority of different image 
analysis algorithms in predicting survival outcomes. 
Exploration of additional markers and measurement 
regions may provide further insights into the prognos-
tic value of TILs. The implementation of AI and digital 
pathology techniques, along with multiplex immunohis-
tochemistry, may contribute to the widespread adoption 
of automated TIL assessment in pathology laborato-
ries. Prospective validation studies can build upon these 
Page 15 of 18
Soliman et al. Diagnostic Pathology           (2024) 19:38 
	
findings and help refine the methodology for TIL assess-
ment, leading to improved patient outcomes and person-
alized treatment strategies [26].
In terms of Phyllodes Tumor Mitoses counting, further 
research with larger sample sizes and broader timeframes 
is needed to validate the findings and ensure generaliza-
bility. The development and validation of an AI algorithm 
for accurate mitosis counting in phyllodes tumors could 
potentially improve efficiency and consistency in pathol-
ogy practice [25]. Currently, there is a need to establish 
consistent methods for counting mitotic figures in whole 
slide images (WSIs) used for cancer diagnosis. Determin-
ing the appropriate area to count, selecting hotspots, and 
deciding on the counting approach requires evidence-
based studies. Unfortunately, there is no agreement on 
the size of the area to count using WSI, with different 
studies using varying sizes [40–42]. Until standardized 
guidelines are developed, it is recommended to count 
multiple screens at × 40 magnification, which would pro-
vide an area size of 3 mm2, equivalent to 10 high-power 
fields (HPF) of a standard microscope with a 0.62 field 
diameter [38].
Using Oncotype DX to integrate morphological and 
molecular measurements and improve BC risk assess-
ment, particularly for intermediate-risk patients, can 
leverage image analysis and genomic data analysis to 
enhance risk stratification and treatment decisions. The 
study highlights the need to further explore the impact 
of staining and scanning variations on features and clas-
sification results, aiming for more robust AI-based 
pathology analysis. Future research could investigate the 
correlation between identified features and long-term 
disease recurrence or patient outcomes, establishing a 
direct link between AI-based risk assessment and clinical 
outcomes [31].
Integrating AI with human expertise can enhance the 
accuracy and precision of the process. Specifically, in 
tasks such as detecting DCIS and nonmalignant tumor 
presentations, manual annotation of regions of interest 
(ROIs) remains necessary. Human involvement ensures a 
comprehensive understanding of complex cases that may 
require expert judgment and interpretation. Thus, the 
collaboration between AI and human experts allows for 
improved outcomes in these challenging areas of diagno-
sis and assessment [11].
Current commercially available AI platforms/algorithms 
in breast pathology
Advancements in AI are revolutionizing BC diagnostics, 
significantly improving accuracy, efficiency, and consist-
ency in pathology analysis. Several innovative AI-based 
tools are commercially available, offering pathologists 
and oncologists valuable support in the fight against 
breast cancer.
Mindpeak (Hamburg, Germany) has made a significant 
contribution to BC diagnostics with its suite of automated 
image analysis software modules. The modules, including 
Mindpeak Breast HER2 ROI (region of interest, Mindpeak 
Breast Ki-67 HS, and Mindpeak Breast ER/PR, enable the 
automated analysis of digital histopathology images of 
human invasive breast carcinoma tissue samples without

the need for manual fine-tuning in each lab. This stream-
lines the analysis process, making it more efficient and 
consistent across different institutions. Furthermore, 
Mindpeak’s forthcoming Metastasis Detection software is 
expected to aid cancer experts in detecting and visualiz-
ing metastases associated with breast cancer [10].
OWKIN (Paris, France) RlapsRisk™ BC is an innova-
tive AI diagnostic tool designed to assist pathologists 
and oncologists in determining the most appropriate 
treatment pathway for early BC patients. The test is spe-
cifically tailored for adults with ER + /HER2- BC and has 
demonstrated superior cumulative sensitivity compared 
to standard clinical scoring systems. This tool offers new 
possibilities in personalized treatment planning, empow-
ering healthcare professionals to make better-informed 
decisions for patients with early breast cancer.
Visiopharm, Fig.  1, (Hovedstaden, Denmark) offers 
a range of AI applications for BC diagnostics, certified 
under IVDR, ensuring adherence to rigorous regulatory 
standards. The Visiopharm ER APP [20] aids in determin-
ing ER positivity and negativity in BC tumors, providing 
primary outputs such as the percentage of positive tumor 
nuclei and Allred score, which is a combination of inten-
sity and proportion score. The HER2 IHC app utilizes 
the HER2-CONNECT™ algorithm for automated image 
analysis of HER2-stained BC tissue sections, providing 
discrete scores corresponding to the HER2 IHC score 
per ASCO/CAP guidelines. Both applications streamline 
the analysis process and eliminate the need for manual 
outlining of tumor regions, saving time and increasing 
efficiency for pathologists [12, 13]. Visiopharm Invasive 
Tumor Detection (PDS) and Metastasis Detection APP: 
Visiopharm’s Invasive Tumor Detection (PDS) is an 
automated and objective method for accurately identify-
ing invasive tumor regions. It employs a physical double 
stain of p63 + CK7/19 to detect invasive tumor compo-
nents, excluding noninvasive components, and signifi-
cantly improves workflow efficiency for pathologists. The

Metastasis Detection APP simplifies lymph node assess-
ment by accurately detecting and measuring metastases 
in H&E-stained lymph nodes associated with breast and 
colorectal adenocarcinoma. It improves sensitivity and 
specificity compared to manual methods and streamlines 
slide sorting, making it a valuable addition to the diag-
nostic workflow [18].
The Paige (New York, United States) Breast Suite 
includes Paige Breast and Paige Breast Lymph Node. 
Paige Breast effectively detects premalignant and malig-
nant neoplasms, highlighting areas of cancer for con-
fident identification. On the other hand, Paige Breast 
Lymph Node uses the same technology employed in 
detecting prostate cancer to identify metastases in lymph 
node slides with over 98% sensitivity. These applica-
tions enhance diagnostic confidence, prioritize cases for 
review, and ultimately lead to better patient outcomes. 
Both applications are CE-IVD and UKCA marked, ensur-
ing adherence to the highest quality standards.
IBEX, Fig 2, (Tel Aviv, Israel) GALEN™ BREAST is 
another cutting-edge AI-based diagnostic tool designed 
to improve productivity and shorten turnaround time 
for pathologists. The tool offers a wide array of features, 
including case prioritization, slide viewer, IHC preor-
dering, cancer heatmaps, grading, measurements, non-
cancer findings, and AI-driven reporting. With its high 
performance in detecting invasive cancer and DCIS, 
IBEX GALEN™ BREAST provides unparalleled support 
to pathologists in accurate diagnosis and treatment plan-
ning. However, there are still limitations of AI applica-
tions for breast pathology.
The adoption of AI in pathology practice holds several 
expected benefits, including automation, elimination of 
tedious tasks, improved accuracy, and efficiency. There 
is significant enthusiasm among pathologists regarding 
the potential of AI in routine practice. Further research 
is needed to assess the impact of AI on patient outcomes 
and evaluate whether existing scoring systems need revi-
sion in light of AI’s potentially higher accuracy. Stand-
ardization efforts should be pursued, including defining 
equivalent units of measurement between glass slides 
and WSIs to ensure consistency in quantifying mitoses. 
The successful integration of AI into routine workflows 
requires continued learning and exploration of best prac-
tices. Challenges related to data quality, algorithm valida-
tion, and regulatory considerations need to be addressed 
to ensure reliable and ethical implementation of AI in 
pathology [24].
Conclusion
In summary, this review highlights the potential of AI in 
assisting pathologists in various aspects of BC diagnosis 
and assessment. While AI has demonstrated improved 
accuracy, efficiency, and standardization in the realm of 
BC, challenges remain in addressing preanalytical vari-
ables, manual annotation requirements, and limitations 
in differentiating certain types of breast lesions. Further 
research and development are needed to overcome these 
limitations and fully harness the potential of AI in BC 
pathology.
