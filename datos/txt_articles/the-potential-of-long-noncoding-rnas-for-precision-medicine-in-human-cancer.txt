Precision medicine promises to better classify patients by individual clinical and biological biomarkers, which 
may provide an accurate assessment of disease risk, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment response. Cancer 
frequently displays substantial inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity and hence oncology is well suited for 
application of precision approaches. Recent studies have demonstrated that dysregulated lncRNAs play pivotal 
roles in tumor heterogeneity. In this review, attention is focused on the potential applications of lncRNAs as 
biomarker candidates for cancer risk evaluation, detection, surveillance and prognosis. LncRNAs are often stable 
in clinical samples and easily detected. The functional implications and therapeutic potential of targeting 
lncRNAs in human cancer are further discussed. Finally, existing deficiencies and future perspectives in trans­
lating fundamental lncRNA knowledge into clinical practice are highlighted.   
1. Introduction 
Precision medicine, which relies on individual differences in ge­
netics, environments and lifestyle, classifies patients into precise groups 
that will potentially benefit from specific disease prevention and treat­
ment protocols [1]. The rapid advancement of genome sequencing 
technology and bioinformatics algorithms have encouraged creative 
approaches to precision medicine. Powerful genomics, proteomics, 
metabolomics and diverse cellular assays enable scientists and clinicians 
to more precisely target specific diseases [2]. Importantly, precision 
medicine consists of not only precise treatment, but it also, by necessity, 
encompasses precise diagnoses [3]. Precision medicine therefore pos­
sesses the potential for broad application in a variety of medical spe­
cialties, including cardiology, endocrinology and oncology [4–7]. 
Oncology was one of the first fields proposed for the application of 
precision medicine. Cancer is a common disease and one of the leading 
causes of death globally [8]. Despite the extraordinary amount of money 
and effort expended to improve therapeutic efficacy in cancer, the sur­
vival outcome for many cancer patients has shown limited improve­
ment. Although a much greater understanding of the molecular 
mechanisms of cancer progression has been put forward, little can be 
translated into clinical practice [9]. This may be partly due to the 
complexity of molecular and cellular heterogeneity of cancer cell clonal 
selection. Tumors exhibit molecular and cellular heterogeneity between 
different patients (inter-tumor heterogeneity) and even within each in­
dividual tumor (intra-tumor heterogeneity) [10]. Tumor heterogeneity 
has obvious consequences for cancer stem-like populations, resulting in 
treatment resistance, metastasis and recurrence [11–13]. Darwinian-like 
clonal evolution is presumably a major generator of tumor heteroge­
neity. The selective pressures of mutational diversity and adaptions to

the microenvironment including therapeutic pressures drive the tem­
poral evolution of cancer cell clonality [9]. Clonal evolution in cancer 
therefore provides both challenges and opportunities for successful 
treatment [14]. Consideration of the epigenetic and genetic heteroge­
neity in cancer may hold the key to more precise and efficacious diag­
nostic and therapeutic approaches [15]. 
The genomic characteristics of cancer form an important component 
of precision oncology. Whilst up to 70% of the genome is transcribed, 
the proportion of protein-coding elements in the genome is only 
approximately 1.5% [16]. However, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are 
constitutively expressed and play critical roles in multiple biological 
functions [17]. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) belong to the ncRNA 
family and are defined as endogenous cellular RNAs of more than 200 
nucleotides in length [18]. LncRNAs may be transcribed from several 
DNA elements such as enhancers, promoters, introns, and intergenic 
regions in eukaryotic genomes (Fig. 1). The transcribed lncRNAs may be 
further processed by different mechanisms, such as cleavage by RNase P 
to generate mature ends, formation of small nucleolar RNA and protein 
(snoRNA/snoRNP) complex caps at their ends, and formation of circular 
structures (Fig. 1) [19]. Genome-wide studies have revealed that more 
than 80% of cancer-associated genetic aberrance occurs in non-coding 
regions [20]. Accumulating evidence has indicated that lncRNAs are 
critical regulators of cellular processes implicated in cancer develop­
ment and progression. Notably, aberrant expression of lncRNAs is 
associated with tumor cell genomic stability, proliferation, survival and 
motility [21]. Furthermore, lncRNAs may also perform important 
functions in angiogenesis, immune cell infiltration and immune sur­
veillance [22,23]. Single-cell sequencing studies also suggest marked 
heterogeneity in lncRNA expression between individual cancer cells 
[24]. Hence, lncRNAs may be more cell-type specific than 
protein-coding genes [24], rendering them appropriate for use in pre­
cision oncology. However, clinical practice has to date mostly focused 
on protein-coding genes and there is currently a paucity of effort to 
translate lncRNAs to clinical utility. In this review, cancer-related 
lncRNAs have been grouped into five areas of utility in precision 
oncology, including cancer risk, detection, prognosis, targeted therapy 
and immunotherapy. The possible roles and potential applications of 
some important and well-characterized lncRNAs in precision oncology 
have been summarized. This review aims to expand the perspectives of 
the potential use of lncRNAs in precision oncology and facilitate di­
rections for future research. 
2. LncRNA in cancer risk evaluation 
Disease prevention will presumably benefit the population more 
than attempted disease treatment. The risk of cancer development is 
contributed by both exogenous environmental influences and endoge­
nous genetic composition [25]. One of the goals of precision oncology is 
to evaluate cancer predisposition and guide intervention for 
risk-reduction, which may effectively obviate cancer development. Ge­
netic evaluation of specific cancer-risk has become clinically available 
over the last few decades. For example, people with mutations in 
BRCA1/2 display remarkably increased risks in breast and ovarian 
cancer [26,27]. Furthermore, the risk for gastric cancer development is 
dramatically increased in E-cadherin (CDH1) mutation carriers [28]. 
Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of ge­
netic polymorphisms (mainly composed of single nucleotide poly­
morphisms, SNPs) associated with susceptibility to disease. More than 
90% of these SNPs are located outside of the protein-coding regions 
[29]. Characterizing cancer risk-associated SNPs provides an opportu­
nity to develop methods of risk evaluation in precision oncology. Thus, 
genetic polymorphisms in lncRNAs may also be utilized for estimation of 
cancer susceptibility. For example, lncRNA HOX transcript antisense 
intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) was initially identified for possessing roles in 
the initiation and progression of various malignancies [30,31]. The 
tagging SNP (tagSNP) rs920778, rs1899663 and rs4759314 of lncRNA 
HOTAIR were identified to be significantly associated with the risk of 
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) [32]. Guo et al. further 
demonstrated that the tagSNP rs12826786 polymorphism in HOTAIR 
endowed a genotype-specific effect on HOTAIR expression and was 
associated with increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia 
[33]. Further studies also demonstrated a strong correlation between 
tagSNPs of HOTAIR and the susceptibility to develop colon and gastric 
cancers [34,35]. Additionally, genetic variants of HOTAIR are also 
associated with the risk of other cancers, including cervical, oral and 
breast cancers [36–38]. 
LncRNA H19, a maternally expressed imprinted gene, is located on 
chromosome 11 and involved in cancer progression [39]. Ariel et al. 
reported that patients with increased numbers of H19-positive cancer 
cells are at higher risk for early recurrence of bladder cancer [40]. The 
polymorphisms in lncRNA H19 have also been reported to correlate with 
the susceptibility to develop various cancers. The polymorphism (SNP) 
rs2107425 has been identified to be significantly associated with breast 
cancer risk [41]. SNP rs2107425 is located approximately 2 kb upstream 
of the lncRNA H19 locus. Other H19 polymorphisms have also been 
reported including H19 rs2839698 and rs217727. Encyclopedia of DNA 
Elements (ENCODE) DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) sequencing and 
ChIP-Seq data analysis demonstrated that H19 rs2839698 and rs217727 
may affect the recruitment of transcription factors and subsequently 
modulate the expression of H19 [42]. Whereas H19 rs217727 exhibits 
no significant association with cancer susceptibility [42], H19 
rs2839698 was reported to be associated with increased risk of gastric 
and colorectal cancer in the Chinese population [43,44]. However, in 
Caucasians, the H19 rs2839698 exhibits the opposite association with 
cancer risk [45]. A further meta-analysis using published data confirmed 
that H19 rs2839698 may modify cancer susceptibility based on ethnicity 
[42]. 
LncRNA PCAT1 was first identified as a prostate-specific lncRNA that 
may contribute to prostate cancer progression [46]. Several putative 
functional genomic polymorphisms of lncRNA PCAT1, such as 
rs2632159, rs1026411, rs1902432, rs710886 and rs16901904, have 
been identified to be associated with the risk of human cancer devel­
opment. A case-control study was employed to determine the associa­
tions between these tagSNPs and prostate cancer risk, wherein PCAT1 
rs1902432 was identified to be significantly associated with increased 
risk of prostate cancer development [47]. A recent study systematically 
revealed that rs1026411 and rs710886 are also associated with sus­
ceptibility to NSCLC, while rs1026411 is associated specifically with the 
risk of lung adenocarcinoma [48]. The SNPs of lncRNA associated with 
cancer susceptibility are summarized in Table 1. 
Genetic polymorphism of lncRNAs is therefore an important

contributor to cancer risk and evaluation thereof. Distinct genetic vari­
ants are associated with susceptibility to the development of different 
cancers. However, it is insufficient to simply determine the presence of 
specific lncRNA polymorphisms. The functional mechanisms and clin­
ical utility of these genetic variants should be sufficiently understood to 
allow appropriate interpretation of these lncRNA polymorphisms for 
specific individuals. 
3. LncRNAs in cancer detection 
Cancer is a common disease and the leading cause of death world­
wide. The high mortality rate of human cancer is partly due to the fact 
that a majority of cases are detected at advanced stages. There is an 
urgent need for convenient, rapid and highly specific early detection 
biomarkers for precision oncology. Accumulating evidence has sug­
gested that various RNA molecules may serve as biomarkers for the 
detection of human cancer. In particular, extracellular RNAs in body 
fluids, such as serum, urine or saliva, may serve as non-invasive bio­
markers for early detection of cancers [49]. mRNA determination has 
been previously employed in tumor prognosis. Previous studies have 
also demonstrated that multi-gene expression profiles may serve in 
cancer subtype classification. For example, a 50-gene panel, PAM50, has 
been successfully utilized in the classification of breast cancer [50]. 
Similarly, the expression of 31 genes involved in cell cycle progression 
has been applied to prostate cancer prognosis [51]. 
In addition to mRNAs, lncRNAs may also possess utility in the 
detection and prognosis of cancer. LncRNA PCA3 is a prostate cancer 
specific lncRNA that is highly expressed in prostate tumors [52]. 
Furthermore, PCA3 may also be detected in the urine of prostate cancer 
patients [53]. Hence, PCA3 may serve as a potential biomarker for 
prostate 
cancer 
screening 
and 
detection. 
Although 
serum 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been well applied as a prostate 
cancer biomarker, the specificity of PSA is low. Compared to PSA, PCA3 
exhibits higher specificity and easy accessibility with no biopsy 
required. Indeed, it has been reported that PCA3 may serve as a first-line 
biomarker with improved specificity and sensitivity compared to PSA 
[54]. In addition, a PCA3 score was strongly correlated with prostate 
tumor volume and may be able to improve active surveillance of the 
disease [55]. The transcription-mediated amplification (TMA)-based 
PCA3 urine test was the first RNA-based cancer detection assay from 
body fluid that arrived to clinical practice [56]. Combining PCA3 with 
other clinical biomarkers may provide more accurate detection of 
prostate cancer. 
LncRNA HULC is another cancer-related lncRNA that can be found in 
the blood of hepatocellular carcinoma patients [57], indicating that 
HULC may serve as a potential non-invasive biomarker for cancer 
detection. Additionally, combined detection of HULC and Linc00152 in 
serum achieves a more accurate prediction for the occurrence of hepa­
tocellular carcinoma compared to HULC alone [58]. HULC may also 
serve as a serum biomarker for early detection of gastric cancer. Serum 
HULC levels are strongly correlated with H. pylori infection, tumor size 
and metastatic stage in gastric cancer patients. Both the sensitivity and 
specificity of HULC are higher than CEA and CA72-4 for gastric cancer 
detection [59]. A recent study also revealed higher HULC levels in 
cancer tissue and serum of pancreatic cancer patients. HULC was related 
to the size and grade of tumor and exhibits clinical utility for pancreatic 
cancer detection [60]. 
Compared with single lncRNA quantification, panels of multiple 
lncRNAs might be more appropriate for cancer detection and/or diag­
nosis. A panel containing 3 lncRNAs (MEG3, SNHG16 and MALAT1) has 
been utilized for the detection of bladder cancer from serum samples 
[61]. In addition, a microarray followed by qRT-PCR analysis identified 
a combination of two lncRNAs (uc004cox.4 and GAS5) in the urine with 
high accuracy for the detection of bladder cancer [62]. A panel of three 
lncRNAs (PCAT-1, UBC1 and SNHG16) in exosomes has been deter­
mined by a multivariate logistic regression model to predict bladder 
cancer [63]. Panels of multiple lncRNAs have also been applied to the 
detection of hepatocellular and colorectal carcinomas [64,65]. 
Currently, several of these fundamental studies have been translated 
into the clinical setting for cancer detection. Clinical trials are underway 
in lung cancer diagnosis using serum exosomal lncRNAs (https:// 
clinicaltrials.gov/) (NCT03830619). Furthermore, lncRNA CCAT1 or 
HOTAIR is trailing for colorectal cancer (NCT04269746) or thyroid 
cancer (NCT03469544) detection, respectively. 
Compared to protein biomarkers, lncRNAs are easy to detectable at a 
very low abundance. The PCR technique enables the lncRNA sequences 
to be amplified and thus detected with high sensitivity. Unlike protein 
biomarker detection, which requires specific antibodies, the cost of PCR 
used for lncRNA detection is much lower. Moreover, deep sequencing 
technology enables the quantification of lncRNA expression at the whole 
genomic level. Novel lncRNA biomarkers may potentially be identified 
from deep sequencing data and be developed to improve cancer 
detection. 
4. LncRNAs in cancer prognosis 
Determination of prognosis improves the understanding of the clin­
ical outcomes and benefits clinicians to adopt effective intervention 
methods. Increasing studies have paid attention to comprehensively 
evaluate clinical prognosis using various biomarkers [66]. Several gene 
expression panels have been developed to classify cancer into different 
groups and refine prognosis estimation based on current guidelines. For 
example, the 70-gene signature (MammaPrint™) was developed to 
predict the risk of recurrence in breast cancer patients [67]. Emerging 
evidence has suggested that lncRNAs are also abnormally expressed and 
play critical roles in cancer progression. Thus, measurement of lncRNAs 
may be considered to improve the assessment of cancer prognosis. 
In colorectal cancer, patients with similar histopathological charac­
teristics may exhibit significantly different prognoses after surgery. 
Studies have identified oncogenic lncRNAs that are associated with 
prognosis in colorectal cancer. Colon cancer associated transcript-1 
(CCAT1) was first described as a lncRNA that is highly expressed in 
colorectal cancer compared to normal tissues [68]. Elevated CCAT1 
levels were observed in the primary tumor, blood, and metastases of 
colorectal cancer patients. CCAT1 has also been reported to correlate

with lymph node metastasis, clinical stage and survival in colorectal 
cancer [69]. Thus, CCAT1 may serve as a valuable prognostic indicator 
for colorectal cancer. Nearly half of patients with advanced colon cancer 
tend to develop liver metastases. However, there are no effective bio­
markers that can predict the susceptibility for liver metastatic. Cancer 
liver metastasis associated transcript-3 (CLMAT3) is a lncRNA that has 
been demonstrated as a prognostic biomarker for liver metastasis of 
colorectal cancer. CLMAT3 is significantly upregulated in the primary 
tumor of colon cancer patients with liver metastasis and consequently 
predicts shorter overall survival time for these patients [70]. LncRNA 
DANCR (differentiation antagonizing non-protein coding RNA) has been 
identified to be involved in the maintenance of stemness of normal and 
liver cancer cells [71]. Furthermore, DANCR is upregulated in colon 
cancer tissue and correlates with tumor stage and poor survival out­
comes in colon cancer patients [72]. Another promising prognostic 
marker for colon cancer is lncRNA FTX, which is conserved and encoded 
within the X-inactivation center. FTX is markedly upregulated in colon 
cancer tissue and predicts poor survival outcomes [73]. 
Mammary carcinoma is heterogeneous cancer that can be classified 
by various methods into molecular subtypes. A well-established mo­
lecular classification has been developed to classify patients into at least 
four subtypes including luminal A, luminal B, HER2-amplified and 
basal-like [74]. However, the prognosis of patients may differ even in 
the same subtype. Further prognostic markers are therefore needed to 
accurately predict prognosis and provide clinical guidance. A 4-lncRNA 
panel (RP11-434D9.1, LINC00052, BC016831 and IGKV) has been 
identified enabling classification of triple negative breast cancer [75]. 
LncRNA SPRY4-IT1 is increased in breast cancer tissue and is associated 
with tumor size and the pathological stage of breast cancer [76]. 
Additionally, lncRNA H19 is increased in the plasma of breast cancer 
patients and H19 levels are markedly decreased in postoperative 
compared to preoperatively drawn plasma [77]. An additional study 
utilizing an omics-based analysis identified a 12-lncRNA signature that 
is highly predictive of tumor recurrence and survival outcomes of breast 
cancer patients [78]. In clinical trials, the mRNA-lncRNA integrated 
signature has been developed to classify triple negative breast cancer 
patients and guide the therapeutic regimen (https://clinicaltrials.gov/) 
(NCT02641847). 
In addition to colon and breast cancer, lncRNAs have also been 
developed as prognostic biomarkers in various other cancer types. In 
hepatocellular carcinoma, a comprehensive systematic review and 
meta-analysis identified a panel of 45 lncRNAs that could be potential 
non-invasive prognostic biomarkers [79]. LncRNA NEAT1 is upregu­
lated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and predicts poor prognosis [80]. 
Furthermore, lncRNA Sox2ot (Sox2 overlapping transcript) has been 
reported to predict poor prognosis in lung, liver and gastric cancer [81]. 
Further information of the association between lncRNAs and cancer 
prognosis is summarized in Table 2. These findings lead to potent pos­
sibilities for lncRNAs in precise evaluations of cancer prognosis. 
5. Targeted therapy potential of lncRNAs 
Recent advances in the understanding of lncRNAs in cancer provide 
renewed therapeutic opportunities. Several lncRNA-targeting strategies 
have been proposed. 
Post-transcriptional targeting is one approach for lncRNA targeted 
therapy, which provides a straightforward method to modulate lncRNA 
expression [82]. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and siRNAs are the 
most common means for post-transcriptional regulation. ASOs bind to 
RNA in a base-paired manner, triggering an RNaseH-mediated RNA 
degradation. The metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 
1 (MALAT1) is a highly conserved lncRNA that is involved in the 
metastasis of various cancers. Targeting MALAT1 by ASOs markedly 
reduced the growth of primary breast tumors and lung metastasis in the 
MMTV–PyMT transgenic mouse model [83]. Another example is ASO 
targeting of the leukemia-induced non-coding activating RNA 1 
(LUNAR1). Knockdown of lncRNA LUNAR1 by ASOs was shown to 
inhibit cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo by repression of the 
IGF1R [84]. Mammary tumor-associated RNAs (MaTARs) is a super­
family of lncRNAs that is associated with human breast cancer. 
ASO-mediated knockdown of 20 MaTARs members significantly 
reduced the proliferation and invasion of mouse mammary cancer cells 
[85]. Additionally, ASO-mediated downregulation of lncRNA SChLAP1 
also significantly limited tumor formation and metastasis in prostate 
cancer [21]. 
siRNAs are double-stranded RNAs that specifically repress target 
RNAs in a RISC complex dependent manner. Targeting MALAT1 using 
specific siRNAs significantly inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation 
and invasion [86]. Furthermore, siRNAs directed against HOTAIR 
inhibited the invasion of breast cancer cells [30]. shRNA mediated 
HOTAIR depletion also inhibited the growth of gastric tumors in vivo 
[87]. 
The CRISPR/Cas9 system has also been developed to target the 
genomic DNA of lncRNAs. CRISPR/Cas9 interference has been used to 
knockout an array of lncRNAs in 7 human cell lines (six cancer cell lines 
and one iPSC line), wherein about 500 lncRNAs were identified to be 
required for cancer cell proliferation [88]. LncRNA NEAT1 was reported 
to regulate the replication stress response of cancer cells. NEAT1 dele­
tion by the CRISPR/Cas9 system dramatically abrogated the metastatic 
ability of squamous cell carcinoma cells [89]. Gastric cancer 
metastasis-associated long non-coding RNA GMAN is upregulated in 
gastric cancer and associated with poor prognosis. Delivery of a 
CRISPR/Cas9 system targeting GMAN in a mouse model suppressed 
gastric cancer metastasis [90]. Additionally, the CRISPR/Cas13 system, 
which directly targets RNAs, has been developed and may be another 
promising approach to deplete lncRNAs in laboratory and clinic [91]. 
Furthermore, phase I/II clinical trials are underway in patients with 
pancreatic, ovarian and bladder cancer for lncRNA H19 targeted therapy

based on intratumoral administration of the BC-819 plasmid [92]. The 
schematic of different approaches to target lncRNAs is summarized in 
Fig. 2. 
A large proportion of protein targets in basic research are as yet 
undruggable. One of the main advantages of lncRNA targeting is that it 
can easily modulate the expression or activity of targeted proteins [93]. 
Another deficiency of protein targeted therapy is that many small 
molecule inhibitors possess poor specificity, especially in proteins pos­
sessing similar structural domains. Through careful design, the speci­
ficity of targeted lncRNA can be efficiently improved. Moreover, 
compared to protein-coding genes, lncRNAs are apparently more 
tissue-specific [94]. LncRNA targeted therapy may therefore exhibit less 
on-target and off-target toxicity compared to small molecule drugs. 
Therefore, consideration for lncRNA targeting in cancer is warranted 
and it may emerge as a promising therapeutic approach in oncology. The 
targeted strategy and therapeutic potential of lncRNAs in human cancer 
are listed in Table 3. 
6. LncRNAs in immunotherapy 
Tumor immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors 
(ICIs), has improved the therapeutic outcomes in various cancers. 
Nevertheless, the response rate of immunotherapies is not optimal with 
only 15%–40% patients benefiting from tumor immunotherapy [95]. 
Whilst the majority of patients develop intrinsic or acquired resistance 
to immunotherapy, the mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance are 
not clear. Accumulating evidence has suggested that lncRNAs may play 
critical roles in immunological surveillance and resistance to immuno­
therapy. Therefore, understanding lncRNA regulated immunotherapy 
resistance may provide opportunities to both identify patients that may 
respond to immunotherapy and develop strategies to overcome immu­
notherapy resistance. 
Aberrant expression of lncRNAs has been found both in cancer cells 
and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Cancer cell endoge­
nous lncRNAs play critical roles in regulating immunotherapy resis­
tance. Antigen presenting cell (APC) infiltration and the antigen 
presentation process have been reported to be affected by lncRNAs 
expressed in cancer cells. For example, elevated expression of lncRNA 
LINK-A in triple-negative breast cancer cells correlates with decreased 
APC infiltration, facilitating the escape of breast cancer cells from im­
mune surveillance [96]. The expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells was also 
modulated by lncRNAs. In large B-cell lymphoma and pancreatic cancer, 
MALAT1 has been observed to act as a miR-195 sponge to promote the 
expression of PD-L1 [97]. In pancreatic cancer, it was demonstrated that 
the expression of PD-L1 was also regulated by lncRNA LINC00473 [98]. 
T cells are the direct effector cells that recognize cancer cells and exert 
cytotoxic activity. LncRNAs also modulate T cell activation. Lnc-sox5 
was demonstrated to be upregulated in colorectal cancer, and lnc-sox5 
deletion results in enhanced cytotoxicity of CD3+CD8+ CTLs at the 
tumor site [99]. 
The aberrant expression of lncRNAs in the immune cells of the tumor 
microenvironment may also regulate the immunotherapeutic response. 
LncRNA NEAT1 was demonstrated to be upregulated in the peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Deple­
tion of NEAT1 in CD8+ T-cells significantly attenuated the apoptotic 
process in T-cells and enhanced cytotoxic activity [100]. The NF-κB 
interacting lncRNA NKILA is upregulated in tumor-specific CTLs and 
promotes their apoptosis process, resulting in shorter survival outcomes 
in patients with breast cancer and NSCLC [101]. LncRNAs also regulate 
the recruitment and activity of immunosuppressive cells. LncRNA 
Olfr29-ps1 is highly expressed in MDSCs and promotes MDSCs to 
differentiate into monocytic MDSCs, which plays a key role in immune 
suppression [102]. Lnc-chop also regulated the differentiation of MDSCs 
[103]. Furthermore, lncRNA PVT1 has been reported to regulate the 
granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs). PVT1 is 
transcriptionally regulated by HIF-1α in G-MDSCs, and upregulated 
PVT1 promotes increased levels of Arg1 and ROS in these cells [104]. 
7. Conclusion and perspectives 
With the advancement of genome sequencing technology, lncRNAs 
have been identified to play critical roles in the initiation and progres­
sion of cancers. We illustrate here that lncRNAs exhibit strong potential 
applications in all aspects of precision oncology. However, several lim­
itations of lncRNAs in cancer studies should also be considered. Firstly, 
the majority of long lncRNAs are expressed at very low abundance, 
which leads to the concern of whether they are functionally relevant to 
clinical oncology [105]. Secondly, most of the downstream effector 
molecules of lncRNAs are proteins. Careful attention should be paid to 
determine whether a lncRNA or a more direct downstream protein is 
better as the therapeutic target. Thirdly, the ASOs or siRNAs in targeting 
lncRNA therapy exhibit poor membrane permeability. These targeting 
molecules are mainly enriched in the cytoplasm, which makes it difficult 
to target sub-nuclear lncRNAs [106]. Lipid-based or polymer-based 
nanoparticles that are capable of carrying ASOs or siRNAs may facili­
tate the application of lncRNA targeted therapy. 
Although a considerable number of lncRNAs have been well studied, 
a large portion of the annotated lncRNAs have not yet been functionally 
characterized.

characterization of lncRNAs in cancer will benefit the application of 
precision oncology. These efforts will be facilitated by large-scale RNA- 
Seq followed by loss-of-function studies. Additionally, while most re­
ports are focused on the functional roles of a single lncRNA in cancer 
progression, a combination of multiple lncRNAs to form biomarker 
panels might improve the potential translation to clinical practice. 
Furthermore, precision oncology approaches should utilize all molecu­
lar classes of biomarkers. DNA, mRNA, lncRNAs and proteins all func­
tion in concert to drive the various biological processes required for 
cancer progression. Biomarker panels including all molecules of utility 
are therefore attractive to optimize risk prediction, detection, prognosis 
and treatment in precision oncology. Interdisciplinary technology 
should also be applied to precision oncology. For example, machine 
learning or other intelligent algorithms could be applied to improve the 
integration of information derived from various biomarkers in large 
scale cohort studies. The aim of precision oncology should be to trans­
late molecular biomarkers to clinical application, providing improved 
predictive or therapeutic precision. However, studies with negative re­
sults are generally not well published, which may result in over­
estimation of the potential of the application of lncRNAs in precision 
oncology. Potent algorithms for evaluating patient risk, detection, 
prognosis and targeted therapy are essential to introduce and improve 
precise approaches to oncology.
