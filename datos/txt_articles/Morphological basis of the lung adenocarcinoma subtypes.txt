SUMMARY
Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), which accounts for a large proportion of lung cancers, is divided into ﬁve
major subtypes based on histologic characteristics. The clinical characteristics, prognosis, and responses
to treatments vary among subtypes. Here, we demonstrate that the variations of cell-cell contact energy
result in the LUAD subtype-speciﬁc morphogenesis. We reproduced the morphologies of the papillary
LUAD subtypes with the cellular Potts Model (CPM). Simulations and experimental validations revealed
modiﬁcations of cell-cell contact energy changed the morphology from a papillary-like structure to micro-
papillary or solid subtype-like structures. Remarkably, differential gene expression analysis revealed sub-
type-speciﬁc expressions of genes relating to cell adhesion. Knockdown experiments of the micropapil-
lary upregulated ITGA11 gene resulted in the morphological changes of the spheroids produced from
an LUAD cell line PC9. This work shows the consequences of gene mutations and gene expressions on pa-
tient prognosis through differences in tissue composing physical forces among LUAD subtypes.
INTRODUCTION
Despite recent improvements in treatment, lung cancer has been the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.1 Among them, non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) (WHO classiﬁcation) accounts for most lung cancer cases, as determined by small biopsies and cytology samples for
pattern typing, such as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.2 Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) represents about 40–50% of all lung
cancers3,4 and is classiﬁed into ﬁve major subtypes with distinct characteristics: lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma (LPA), acinar-predom-
inant adenocarcinoma (APA), papillary-predominant adenocarcinoma (PPA), micropapillary-predominant adenocarcinoma (MPA), and solid-
predominant adenocarcinoma (SPA). LPA is low-grade with a good prognosis; APA and PPA are intermediate grades; MPA and SPA are high-
grade with a poor prognosis. In addition, MPA has high metastatic potential.2,5 The histological subtypes correlate with clinical courses, and
each subtype has different responses to treatments. Thus, understanding the morphogenesis of each subtype should lead to a better under-
standing of subtype-speciﬁc characteristics, better predictions of clinical outcomes, and the development of better subtype-speciﬁc clinical
treatments.
Several studies have reported comparisons of RNA expressions and genomic analysis of lung cancer tissues and showed that the LUAD
subtypes can be classiﬁed into three groups based on the RNA expression and somatic genome signature analysis, including a transition-high
subtype, a transversion-high subtype, and a structurally altered subtype.6–8 The three groups somewhat correlate with the histological sub-
types and underlying mutations. However, it is difﬁcult to predict the changes in tissue architectures of the LUAD subtypes by the classiﬁcation
from mass RNA expression data and genome analyses without knowing which part of the data we should focus on. Tissue architectures are
emergent from the interactions among cells, surrounding tissues, and the local environment without requiring external directing inﬂuences.9
Tissue self-organization is a process where the overall architecture arises from local cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The proliferation of
cells, cell deaths, cell sorting, and adhesions of each cell type produce pressure and surface tension leading to rearrangements. Such forces
produce tissue patterns due to mechanical and spatial constraints. In normal tissues, the tissue architectures are maintained by balanced cell
proliferation, differentiation, and death rates. Cancer tissue is also self-organized but driven by disturbed balances.10 The physical forces pro-
duced from these cellular properties directly control the tissue self-organizations, and the gene expressions controlling the forces are the
points to which we should focus. Therefore, understanding how gene expression changes result in particular morphological changes requires
understanding cell-cell interactions at the tissue level.
The cellular Potts model (CPM) is a multicell-scaled computational model that represents cells on a regular lattice and can describe com-
plex cellular and multicellular behaviors.11,12 Simulations of the CPM incorporate mechanical forces and cell-cell interactions, which enable

the CPM to reproduce the multicellular patterns of tissue development including cell sorting,11 cyst formation,13 tubular formation,14 and
vascular network formation.15 We have used the CPM implementation in CompuCell3D (CC3D)16 to develop our models. CC3D is an
open-source, cross-platform, CPM implementation that includes extensive control and visualization tools embedded in a user-friendly graph-
ical user interface.
Here we develop CPMs that reproduce the tissue architectures of the ﬁve major LUAD subtypes. We started with PPA as the base model
and showed that modiﬁcations of speciﬁc parameters resulted in the establishment of the other four subtypes. The hypotheses we used to
reproduce the tissue architectures were validated by immunostaining of patient tissue sections, and the genes responsible for the tissue ar-
chitectures were identiﬁed by gene expression studies across the LUAD subtypes. Our work shows the consequences of gene mutations and
gene expressions on patient prognosis through differences in tissue composing physical forces among LUAD subtypes.
RESULTS
Hypotheses to establish LUAD CPMs
We initially set up hypotheses to implement in CPMs to reproduce the tissue architectures of the ﬁve LUAD subtypes (Figure 1). The lung
epithelial layer is composed of a single layer of lung columnar epithelial cells, and LUAD is caused by the abnormal proliferation of cancerous
columnar epithelial cells. The ﬁrst morphology, PPA, is composed of papillae with stromal tissue. We hypothesized that PPA is caused by two
processes: (1) Cell division causes the cancer epithelial layer lengthening and (2) increased tension force caused by the lengthening leads to
protrusions of the epithelial layer (Figure 1A). These two hypotheses are a common basis for the tissue morphogenesis of the ﬁve LUAD sub-
types, and we included additional hypotheses to reproduce the other four subtypes (see Table S1). The second morphology, MPA, is
composed of smaller papillae without stromal tissue. In addition to the PPA hypotheses, we considered two additional possibilities for
MPA: (1) Cell proliferation is too fast to produce protrusions that include stromal cells and matrix and (2) lower adhesion between cancer
epithelial cells, stromal cells, and matrix resulted in epithelial protrusions without stromal cells and matrix (Figure 1B). The third morphology,
APA, is composed of mucus-ﬁlled papillae. For APA, we hypothesize that cancer cells differentiate into secretory cells and secrete mucus in
the papillae (Figure 1C). The fourth morphology, SPA, is composed of aggregations of cancer cells. We considered two possibilities: (1) High
cell proliferation makes aggregates of cancer cells and (2) Cells are less differentiated and have low cell polarity, resulting in loss of epithelial
characteristics and aggregated tissue architecture (Figure 1D). In the ﬁfth and ﬁnal morphology, LPA, cancer cells proliferate along the surface
of intact alveolar walls. Our hypothesis for LPA is that the cell division rate is low and is almost the same as that of the normal lung epithelial cell
death rate, resulting in the slow replacement of the normal lung epithelial cell layer with the cancer cell layer. The hypotheses for all ﬁve mor-
phologies are summarized in Table S1.

Tissue architecture reproduction of LUAD subtypes with CPMs
To reproduce the epithelial cell layer, compartmentalized cells were used for the cancer cells and the normal lung epithelial cells. These cells
were composed of apical, basal, lateral, and cytosolic compartments in the model (inset of Figure 2). The normal and cancer virtual epithelial
cell types have similar characteristics and are long columnar cells with lateral connections to adjacent cells to create the epithelial layer, apical
membranes facing the luminal side, and basal membranes adhering to the stromal tissue (Figure 2A). In addition, the model included non-
compartmentalized stromal cells, portions of extracellular matrix (ECM), and portions of mucus. For simplicity, the ECM and mucus portions
were modeled as cells. The luminal space was ﬁlled with CompuCell3D ‘‘Medium’’, which is a special cell type without volume or surface
constraints.
The simulations started with ﬁve cancer cells in the lung epithelial layer. The proliferation of cancer cells lengthens the epithelial layer
creating tension. The excess amount of epithelial layer was emergently folded, creating protrusions while retaining the connection to the un-
derlying stromal tissue. Thus, a lengthened epithelial layer produced papillae with stromal tissue, which is the major characteristic of PPA
(Figure 2B). We deﬁned the PPA-reproducing CPM as the base model and modiﬁed the parameters of that base model to reproduce the
other LUAD subtypes.
First, we increased the proliferation rate of the cancer cells. A 3-fold increase in the proliferation rate (33 growth) produced protrusions
without stromal cell inclusions, which is similar to the characteristics of MPA (Figure 2C). The same result was produced by reduced adhesion
of the cancer cells to the stromal tissue (low adhesions to stromal tissue) without modifying the proliferation rate from the base model (Fig-
ure 2D). The reduction of adhesion was reproduced by increasing the contact energy j value between the two tissue types. Since CPM tries to
minimize system energy, increasing a contact energy j value results in decreased adhesion. A 10-fold increase in the proliferation rate (103
growth), or reduced epithelial polarity (low polarity), produced mass aggregations of cancer cells, which is characteristic of the SPA phenotype
(Figures 2E–2G). The polarity control was also reproduced by modifying the contact energies. APA-like papillae ﬁlled with mucus were repro-
duced by the base model after the addition of mucus secretion by the cancer cells (Base model + mucus, Figure 2H). The parameters modiﬁed
for the various models are given in Table S2, and the movie of the models is given in Video S1.
We scored the tissue architecture characteristics of each LUAD subtype by measuring the cell-cell interactions of each cancer cell with the
following two criteria: (1) The types of neighbor cells and (2) The number of neighbor cancer cells (Figure S2). These scores allow the classi-
ﬁcation of the individual simulations as having produced one of the ﬁve LUAD phenotypes (Table S3). In the base and the base plus mucus
models, higher percentages of cancer cells interact with both luminal and stromal tissue or mucus (Figure 2I). In the 103 growth and the low
polarity models, higher percentages of cells interact with only cancer cells and with a higher number of cancer cells (Figures 2I and 2J). In the
33 growth and the low adhesions to stromal tissue models, most cells interact with luminal or stromal tissue, and the number of cancer cell-
cancer cell interactions was intermediate (Figures 2I and 2J). We also show the relationship between the parameters and the cell-cell contacts
in Figures S2H–S2J. Overall, faster growth rate, higher adhesion energy of cancer cells to stromal tissue, and lower polarity relate to mass
aggregation of cancer cells (Figures S2H–S2J). Our hypotheses of tissue morphogenesis mechanisms successfully reproduced the distinct
tissue architectures of four of the LUAD subtypes observed in clinical samples. However, we failed to reproduce the LPA tissue architectures
with our hypotheses that the balanced rate of cancer cell proliferation and normal lung epithelial cell death leads to the LPA phenotype. With
that hypothesis, cancer cells produced PPA-like papilla structures that contain protrusions partially ﬁlled with stromal tissue (Figure 2K).
Higher cell death rates and stromal tissue proliferation are important to reproduce the tissue architecture of the LPA and
the PPA, respectively
We retrospectively collected tissue samples from patients with the ﬁve LUAD subtypes for immunoﬂuorescence microscopy experiments. Tis-
sue sections of each LUAD subtype were stained with epithelial cancer markers, pan-KERATIN and EpCAM, a proliferating cell marker, KI67,
and an apoptotic cell death marker, cleaved-Caspase-3 (Figures 3A and 3B). We analyzed KI67 or cleaved-Caspase-3 positive cells in both
cancer cells and cancer-related stromal cells. To measure the positive cell ratio in each cell type, we manually segmented the cancer cell layer
and the stromal cell layer in the immunostained images (Figure S3). The segmented images were converted to binary data, and pixels were
counted with ImageJ (Figure S3). Although we did not consider the proliferation of stromal cells in our models, we detected KI67-positive
stromal cells in most of the tissue sections (Figures 3A and 3C). The ratio of KI67-positive stromal cells and cancer cells was well correlated
(Figures 3C and 3D), suggesting stromal and cancer cells are often proliferating at comparable rates. In the models, we found the MPA and
SPA subtypes were reproduced by the increased proliferation rate or the modiﬁcations of cell-cell contact energy for the adhesion/polarity
reduction (Figures 2C–2F). On the other hand, we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in the ratio of KI67-positive proliferating cells among the
ﬁve subtypes, suggesting that the proliferation rate is not important to the morphogenesis of the MPA and SPA subtypes (Figure 3D). Unlike
KI67-positive cells, there was no correlation between the ratios of the cleaved-Caspase-3-positive dying cancer cells and stromal cells (Fig-
ure 3E). Interestingly, among the ﬁve subtypes, LPAs had signiﬁcantly higher percentages of cleaved-Caspase-3-positive cells (Figure 3F). The
ratio of KI67 or cleaved-Caspase-3-positive tumor and stromal cells are shown in Figures S3I and S3J.

Next, we applied the conditions that we found in the immunostaining to the CPM simulations. We increased the cell death rate of cancer
cells ten times with the addition of mild contact inhibition in the second LPA model. The contact inhibition was achieved by a 0.3% reduction of
growth rate when the cancer cells attached to cancer cells or normal epithelial cells in the model. The second model produced almost a single

cancer layer which replaced the normal lung epithelial cells (Figure 4A and Video S1). Compared to the initial LPA model, a higher percentage
of cells faced both luminal space and stromal tissue indicating a lower production rate of papilla structures (Figures 4B, S4A, and S4B). The
cancer cell-cancer cell interactions in the second model were smaller compared to the initial model (Figures 4C, S4A, and S4B). These charac-
teristics are a good ﬁt for the tissue architectures of the LPA subtype. The line plots shown in Figures S4C and S4D are the cellular number
changes during the second LPA simulations. Compared to the initial LPA model, the timing of cell divisions was desynchronized because
of the mild contact inhibition in the second LPA model (Figures S4C and S4D), which helped to reduce the sudden increase of tension force,
caused by synchronized cell proliferation, and reduced production of PPA-like structures. Figure 4D shows a longer simulation result of the PPA
model. Unlike the original shorter simulation result shown in Figure 2B, the longer simulation resulted in stromal cell-less protrusion formation
(Figure 4D and Video S1). To account for this, we added a process of stromal cell proliferation, which was shown in our immunostaining exper-
iments (Figure 3), to the PPA model. In the second model, papillae contained stromal tissue even in the longer simulations (Figure 4E).
Differential gene expressions of LUAD subtypes correspond to the CPM predictions
In our model simulations, we deﬁned PPA as the base model, and modiﬁcation of distinct parameters in the base model reproduced other
LUAD subtypes. To validate this approach, we have compared gene expressions in PPA to the other LUAD subtypes. We used published
LUAD gene expression and mutation data that contains 15 PPAs, 4 LPAs, 3 MPAs, 32 SPAs, and 27 APAs.8 The volcano plots were using dif-
ferential gene expression data, and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses were performed with genes plotted with red dots in Figures S5A–S5D. In
the comparison of PPAs and LPAs, we found LPAs express more genes in the immune system with Gene Ontology (GO) analyses17 (Figure 5A),
which suggests higher immune response-related cancer cell deaths. Thus, the LPA-speciﬁc gene expression patterns may correspond to the
observation of a high cell death rate of LPA in our immunoﬂuorescent staining data (Figure 4A). For the reproduction of MPA and SPA, our

model predicted that modiﬁcations of cell-cell contact energy resulted in low adhesion of cancer cells to the stromal tissue, and low polarity,
respectively (Figures 2 and 3), and both properties relate to the cellular surface regulations. GO analyses showed that MPAs expressed more
genes relating to extracellular and plasma membrane regulations compared to PPAs, like ‘‘collagen-containing ECM’’, ‘‘basement mem-
brane’’, and ‘‘external side of the plasma membrane’’ (Figure 5B). SPAs also expressed more genes relating to extracellular and plasma mem-
brane regulations than PPAs (Figure 5C). Compared to SPAs, PPAs expressed more genes relating to the apical plasma membrane (Fig-
ure 5C), suggesting that SPAs reduced apico-basolateral polarity compared to PPAs. This ﬁnding correlates well with our model
prediction of low cell polarity in SPAs (Figures 2F and 2G). We found that APAs have higher gene expressions relating to the GO term of
the endoplasmic lumen (Figure 5D). The GO term relates to the production of secretory proteins whose expressions were predicted in
our model hypothesis of higher secretion in APAs (Figure 1C; Table S1).
Figure 5E shows the mutation rate of genes in each LUAD subtype. The mutation rates of cancer driver genes show some subtype spec-
iﬁcity. Each subtype tends to have several speciﬁc mutations: LPAs with RBM10 and PIK3CA, APAs with TP53 and EGFR, PPA with EGFR and
KEAP1, MPA with KEAP1, STK11, and SMARCA, and SPA with TP53, STK11, and SMARCA4 mutations. The total mutation rates were high in
APA and SPA subtypes, which have a higher rate of TP53 mutation (Figure 5E; Table S4). We found some high mutation rate cell-cell adhesion-
related genes including ADGRL2 in APA, TMTC1 and ADGRL3 in MPA, and PCDHGA9 in SPA subtypes (Figure 5E; Table S5). These mutations
can directly participate in subtype-speciﬁc morphogenesis. In addition, we found high mutation rate transcription factor genes in each sub-
type (Figure 5E; Table S4). The mutation of transcription factors including chromatin remodeling proteins like CTCF and SMARCA4 can con-
trol the subtype-speciﬁc morphogenesis through gene expression modiﬁcations. While we see the tendency of subtype-speciﬁc mutation
patterns in the average data, each patient had different patterns of the combination of mutations, showing that the relationship between
mutations and morphology is not simple (Figure S5E).
To understand the relationship between cancer-driver gene mutations and the LUAD subtype morphologies, we focused on genes that
relate to cell-cell adhesion. From the GO classiﬁcations shown in Figures 5A–5D, we focused on the extracellular and plasma membrane reg-
ulatory classiﬁcations whose signiﬁcance was validated by fold changes, p-values, and false discovery rates. We found 6, 30, and 17 candidate
genes relating to MPA, SPA, and PPA morphologies, respectively (Table S5). We compared the expression levels of these 53 genes with or
without each driver gene mutation. As shown in Figures 5F and S5F, the cancer driver gene mutations were mostly correlated with the reduc-
tion of the cell-cell adhesion gene expressions. Expression levels of MPA and SPA-upregulated genes were reduced in patients with PIK3CA,
EGFP, or KEAP1 mutations, and expression levels of MPA-upregulated genes were reduced in patients with STK11 or SMARCA4 mutations
(Figure 5F). Especially, 5 of the 6 MPA-upregulated genes, 18 of the 30 SPA-upregulated genes, and 9 of 17 PPA-upregulated genes were
downregulated in PIK3CA, KEAP1, and SMARCA4 mutations, respectively, suggesting that the strong negative correlation of these subtype
morphologies with the mutations (Figure 5F). In contrast, expression levels of some PPA-upregulated genes were increased in patients with
EGFP mutations, and some outlier genes with increased expression in mutation samples were found (Figures 5F and S5F). These results sug-
gest that the mutations of cancer driver genes control LUAD morphology through gene expression changes of cell-cell adhesion genes.
Effects of subtype-speciﬁc expressing adhesion molecules in patient prognosis
From the morphology-related 53 genes listed in Table S4, we focused on one MPA, two SPA, and one PPA-related genes that directly affects
cellular adhesion(Figure 6). MPA genesinclude ITGA11,which is not expressed in normal alveolar epithelial cells, is a receptor for collagen,and
promoted tumorigenicity and metastasis in a study of NSCLC.18 We used the online database Kaplan-Meier plotter to investigate the relation-
ship between gene expressions and patient prognosis.19 We found that ITGA11 expression was signiﬁcantly associated with the prognosis of
LUAD patients in both individuals who smoked and those who never smoked (Figure 6A). SPA genes include THBS2 and CDH2. THBS2 me-
diates cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and is reported as a correlated factor of LUAD patients’ prognosis.20 Unlike the report, we did not
ﬁnd a signiﬁcant association between THBS2 expression and patient prognosis with total data (top panel of Figure 6B). However, signiﬁcant
associations were found between smoked and never-smoked datasets (middle and bottom panels of Figure 6B). N-Cadherin, coded by the
CDH2 gene, mediates cell-cell adhesion and has been reported as one of the genes important to LUAD prognosis.21 We found CDH2 expres-
sion especially associated with smoked LUAD patient prognosis (Figure 6C). We also found that CEACAM8 expression was high in the PPA
subtype compared to the SPA subtype. CEACAM8, also known as CD66b, mediates cell adhesion and cell migration. We found low expression
ofCEACAM8associatedwiththeLUADpatientprognosis(Figure6D).WeanalyzedalldifferentialgeneslistedinTableS5(datafromFigureS6),
and Figure 6E and Table S5 show the summary of all differential gene results, showing that most of the PPA and MPA/SPA upregulated genes
have positiveandnegativeeffectsonpatient survival,respectively (PPA:positive84.2%,negative15.8%,MPA:positive 20%,negative80%,SPA:
positive 10%, neutral: 16.7%, negative: 73.3%). We also explored the expressions of the morphology-related genes and clinical outcomes. We
found 12 out of 19 PPA upregulated genes negatively 5 out of 6 MPA upregulated genes and 23 out of 30 SPA upregulated genes positively
correlate to higher cancer grade (Figure S6E). We also found 5 PPA upregulated genes negatively and 3 MPA and 15 SPA upregulated genes
positively correlated to metastasis (Figure S6E). We also show the relationships of the gene expressions and contralateral lung metastasis and
liver metastasis and found the overall negative correlation to these factors in PPA genes (Figures S6F and S6G). We did not ﬁnd any correlation
between these genes and other clinical factors including metastasis to other organs and survival time.

genes in the LUAD morphogenesis, we performed shRNA knockdown (KD) of MPA-upregulated ITGA11 in a lung cancer cell line PC9. PC9
is one of the most popular lung cancer cell lines and was established from an LUAD patient.22 However, there is no information about the
histological subtype. Using these cells of unknown LUAD subtype, we selected stable transformant cell lines of control-shRNA and shRNA
against ITGA11. ITGA11-KD cells not only have the reduction of ITGA11 level (37.4 G 0.1% of control-shRNA, Figure 7A) but also have
higher CDH2 expression (386.2 G 1.4% of control-shRNA, Figure 7A). The high CDH2 expression may compensate for the reduced cellular
interaction in ITGA11-KD cells. ITGA11 is one of the MPA-upregulated genes, and the ITGA11-KD cell line also has increased expression of
the SPA-upregulated CDH2 gene (Figure 7A). Thus, the ITGA11-KD cell line can be a model of PPAs or SPAs, and the control shRNA cell
line can be a model of MPAs. We cultured the control and ITGA11-KD cells in the medium containing 2% methylcellulose (MC).23 In the
MC media, cells do not have any scaffold and adhere to each other to produce spheroids (Figure 7B). Each type of cell shows distinctly
shaped spheroids even though the culture started from the same number of cells (Figures 7B and S7A–S7E). The control-shRNA stable PC9
cells produced spheres with protrusions (Figures 7B and S7A). On the other hand, ITGA11-KD cells produced spheres without protrusions
(Figures 7B and S7B), suggesting altered cellular adhesion compared to control-shRNA cells. The structural differences can be measured
by the ratio of the perimeter and area of the spheroids. Since the perimeter is related to both the structural complexity and the area of
spheroids (Figure S7F), we normalized the perimeter and the area of each spheroid (see STAR methods). The left graph in Figure 7C shows
a signiﬁcantly higher ratio of the relative perimeter vs. relative area of control-shRNA spheres compared to that of ITGA11-KD spheres due
to complex morphology in the control-shRNA cells.
To check the stromal-cancer interaction, we cultured a mixture of the stable PC9 cell lines and stromal cells (mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts,
MEFs). When the stable PC9 cell lines were cultured with MEFs in MC media, the mixed culture sphere was shaped like a mushroom, which
consists of a cap and a stalk (lower panels in Figure 7B). The structures were slightly different between the two cell types: the cap of ITGA11-
KD + MEF had more protrusions compared to that of control-shRNA + MEF (lower panels in Figures 7B, 7C, and S7C–S7E). The structural
difference appeared to be a result of the cell-cell interaction difference between MEFs and the shRNA stable transformants of PC9. To visu-
alize the distribution of both mixed cell lines, we pre-stained PC9 cell lines and MEFs before the start of spheroid cultures. The confocal mi-
croscope images show distinct distributions of PC9 cell lines (green cells in Figure 7D) in the mixed spheres. Compared to both cell lines, the
control shRNA cells distributed more evenly than the ITGA11-KD cells in each spheroid (Figure 7D). The ITGA11-KD cell distribution was
patchy and peripheral (lower columns of Figure 7D). We detected each green labeled PC9 cell with Imaris 3D image analysis software and
measured the distances to the nearest neighbor cells. As shown in Figure 7E, we ﬁnd the standard deviations of the distances were larger
in the ITGA11-KD cells, suggesting the uneven distribution (p < 0.01, F-test, Figure 7E). To explain the difference in the distributions, we simu-
lated the expected structures of mixed culture of the stromal cells and PPA, MPA, and SPA cells with CPMs of ‘‘base’’, ‘‘low adhesion to stromal
tissue’’, and ‘‘low polarity’’, respectively. The simulation was started from the even distribution of stromal cells and the LUAD cells (left panel of
Figure 7F), and both cell types proliferate at the same rate. We simulated the three models for 4000 steps and found the SPA model (‘‘low
polarity’’) produces a more even distribution of LUAD cells compared to the other two models (Figure 7F) in the simulated spheres. The
sphere model’s morphological changes were not a simple model capable of producing all LUAD subtypes, but we show that the genetic
alteration of one of the cell-cell adhesion molecules resulted in the changes of SPA-like distribution to PPA or MPA-like distribution.
DISCUSSION
Physical forces produced by cellular proliferation and cell-cell adhesion are the direct executors of tissue self-organization. In cancer cells, the
forces are modiﬁed by altered gene expressions that are caused by sequential accumulation of somatic mutations. LUAD is classically divided
into ﬁve subtypes based on the histomorphologic characteristics.24 The efforts to classify LUAD subtypes with RNA and genomic information
resulted in the classiﬁcation of three groups. The three groups show some sort of association with certain tissue types, but each subgroup
contains a mixture of multiple tissue types.6–8 In this study, we analyzed the physical forces with CPMs, found parameters that need to be
focused, searched genes related to the parameters, and found correlations between the speciﬁc gene expressions and the somatic muta-
tions. With the strategy, we found clues of entire processes of cancer tissue morphogenesis in the ﬁve LUAD histological subtypes.
It is widely accepted that tumorigenesis is a multistep process that depends on a sequential accumulation of mutations within cells. The
mutations result in increased cellular proliferation, decreased death, and changes in cell-cell adhesions and cell polarity. In our base CPM, the
cancer cells have the same properties as normal epithelial cells except for an increased cellular proliferation. With properties of cellular

polarity, interactions, and the spatial constraint of maintaining a surface, PPA-like papillae were emergent due to pressure and surface tension
produced by cell proliferation (Figure 2B). In addition, we did not change epithelial properties in the models that reproduce APA and LPA
morphologies (Table S2). Thus, the PPA, APA, and LPA cell properties are expected to be mostly the same as that of normal lung epithelial
cells except for the increased proliferation, mucus secretion, and high cell death ratio, respectively. Note that the PPA, APA, and LPA patient
prognoses are comparatively good among the ﬁve subtypes of LUAD.5
We initially assumed a higher proliferation rate is an important factor contributing to producing morphologies including MPA-like papillae
which do not contain stromal tissues and SPA-like cancer cell aggregates. However, the staining of patient tissues showed varying KI67 pos-
itive proliferating cancer cell ratios in each LUAD subtype, and the average KI67 positive cell ratios were relatively low in the MPA and SPA
subtypes (Figures 3C and 3D). This result was also supported by transcriptome analysis that did not show differential expression of prolifer-
ation-relating genes (Figure 5). This required us to change our focus from the proliferation rate to the strength of cell-cell adhesions for the
reproduction of the morphologies of MPA and SPA. Cell-cell adhesion contributes to the polarity of cells and is generally reduced in cancer
cells.25 Changes in the cellular adhesion alter the local mechanical forces, which results in modiﬁcation of overall tissue architectures. In our
CPM, changes in cell-cell contact energy resulted in cell-cell adhesions and cellular polarity differences that produced dynamic changes in
PPA-like tissue structure, to MPA-like and SPA-like tissue structures (Figures 2D–2F and 2G).
Classically, the adhesion protein E-Cadherin was thought of as a central player of tumorigenesis because of the role of contact inhibition on
cell proliferation in monolayer culture.26 However, recent 3D culture studies demonstrate that E-cadherin-mediated adhesion is not sufﬁcient
for conferring proliferation arrest.27,28 In comparison to the PPA subtype, we found differential expressions of 6 and 30 extracellular and
plasma membrane-related genes that regulate cell adhesion and polarity in the MPA and the SPA subtypes, respectively (Figures 5D–5I;
Table S5). Interestingly, these genes upregulated in MPA and SPA were mostly associated with a poor prognosis, and the genes upregulated
in PPA were mostly related to a better prognosis (Figure S6; Table S5). These results suggest that the up and downregulated adhesion/po-
larity-related genes as a whole control pathological and tumorigenic differences between the LUAD subtypes.
We showed the knockdown of the MPA-speciﬁc gene, ITGA11, resulted in the morphological changes of spheroids shown in Figures 7 and
S7. As we show in Figure 7A, the ITGA11-KD also resulted in the higher expression of the SPA-upregulated CDH2 gene, suggesting further
alterations of other adhesion gene expressions to compensate for the reduced adhesivity by the KD. ITGA11 promotes the adhesion of cells
to the ECM, and N-cadherin, encoded in the CDH2 gene, promotes homophilic adhesion of the expressing cells. Thus, the KD PC9 cells have
higher homophilic adhesion and lower adhesion to MEFs in sphere culture (Figures 7D and 7E). The properties were reﬂected in the overall
morphologies of the KD PC9 cell spheroids: packed smooth surface at single cultures and production of repulsive protrusions at mixture cul-
ture with MEFs (Figures 7B and 7C). As our expectation, the modiﬁcation of the adhesion relating genes changed cell-cell contact and re-
sulted in the difference in tissue self-organizations.
We are also curious about somatic mutations that produce gene expression changes promoting the subtype-speciﬁc tissue architecture
changes of LUAD. Our mutational analysis also shows the subtype-speciﬁc enrichment patterns of the mutations of cancer driver genes and
other genes (Figure 5E). Cellular proliferation and cell-cell adhesions work together to produce cancer (abnormal) morphologies. Most de-
tected cancer driver mutations are related to cellular proliferation. Although some of the mutation genes are related to cell-cell adhesion,
there is a gap between the accumulation of cancer driver mutations and subtype-speciﬁc gene expression changes of the cell-cell adhe-
sion-related genes. Matano et al. reported engineered mutation induction of cancer driver genes into human colon organoids to produce
tumors in transplanted mice.29 However, the driver mutation inductions alone cannot change the global gene expression and metastatic
property of engineered organoids. In the mutations and expressions correlation analysis, we found negative correlations between cancer
driver gene mutations and the subtype-speciﬁc cell-cell adhesion gene expressions (Figure 5F). We also found subtype-speciﬁc mutations
in transcription factors and chromatin remodeling genes in the LUAD data (Figure 5E; Table S5), suggesting that chain reactions of transcrip-
tion and epigenetic modiﬁcations would be necessary to promote the subtype-speciﬁc gene expression differences, and these processes
may take a long time.
The negative correlation between the mutation and gene expressions can be useful to improve pathological methodologies based on
artiﬁcial intelligence (AI). Developments in AI have enabled computational detection of tumors in hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained slide
imaging, which is called computational pathology. Comparing the tumor detection rates, AI achieved a 92.4% sensitivity while a pathologist
achieved 73.2%.30 Recently, Fujii et al. reported that detections of BRAF and microsatellite instability mutations of colorectal cancer were
achieved by the computational pathology from HE-stained patient slides.31 The correlation of morphology and cancer driver mutations in
LUAD were also reported.32 AI perhaps could identify the mutations and morphological relationships, but it is difﬁcult to interpret what fea-
tures the AI is focusing on and how the differences are produced. The negative correlations of the cancer driver mutations and the subtype-
speciﬁc cell-cell adhesion gene expressions are one of the insights into the morphological different appearances that could be incorporated
to improve the accuracy of the computational pathology. Not only the pathological improvements, but the ﬁndings of negative and positive
metastasis-related genes (Figures S6E–S6G) also provide us with potential clinical targets to prevent metastasis of LUAD cancer cells in the
patients.
The sequential accumulation of mutations ampliﬁes the alteration of cellular properties including proliferation, cell death, adhesion, and
polarity. The cellular properties, especially adhesion and polarity, affect the mechanical forces that are important for tissue morphogenesis.
These forces have both a direct effect on tissue morphology as well as indirect effects through mechanosensory receptors and other feedback
mechanisms. The mechanosensory receptors alter gene expression through signal transduction or stretching of chromatin creating additional
changes to the factors contributing to the morphology of the tissue.33,34 Thus, the study of cancer tissue architecture requires understanding

the orchestrated effects of the immediate effects of changes in processes like adhesion, as well as the feedback-mediated mechanisms giving
rise to additional changes in the critical morphological controlling process.
We have collected clues on several aspects of LUAD including cellular forces, gene expression changes, and cellular morphology. CPM
simulations and experimental validations revealed two basic sources of LUAD morphogenesis: tension forces produced by cellular prolifer-
ation and cell-cell contact energy. The tension force works as a common morphogenetic source, and the differences in cell-cell contact energy
produce subtype-speciﬁc morphologies. In addition, the unique excess rate of cell death produces the outlier LPA morphology. The com-
bination of hypothesis-driven computational modeling, with purpose-driven experimentation for reﬁnement and validation, highlights the
power of the simultaneous use of both approaches. Approaches such as this are critical to increase our mechanistic understanding of normal
and abnormal tissue morphologies. Increased mechanism-based understanding is likely to lead to better clinical interventions.
Limitation of the study
As with all computational models, only objects and processes included in the model can affect model outputs. Therefore, results are limited
by our understanding of the key characteristics of the biological system. We have used bulk tissue RNA data to help deﬁne the model and this
assumes a level of cellular homogeneity that may be incorrect. In the future, single-cell RNA data may help expand our understanding of cell-
to-cell variability and allow more precise deﬁnition of cell behaviors. Alternatively, in the absence of single-cell RNA data, our model could
incorporate small changes in the parameters for individual cells. For example, different cell-cell adhesions or cell proliferation rates (chosen
from a distribution about our best estimate of optimal values) for each cell to establish if model outputs are critically dependent on homo-
geneous cells, or if cell-to-cell variability is tolerated.
In addition, we have not exhaustively explored parameter space and hence have not produced or examined all possible tissue morphol-
ogies that the base model might produce. To this end, we are exploring clustering methods to better understand the output morphologies.
We are exploring both traditional clustering using user-deﬁned descriptors of ﬁnal cell layouts, such as the neighbor counts used in this study
(see Figures 2I and 2J), as well as unsupervised machine learning to cluster the simulation output images into morphologically distinct cell
layout classes. Great strides have been made in image clustering using machine learning techniques and, to our knowledge, those techniques
have not been applied to the analysis of computationally produced tissue images such as those shown in Figures 2A–2H.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND STUDY PARTICIPANT DETAILS
Case and data selection
55 cases of non-small cell lung cancer data from Japanese patients who underwent lung cancer resection at Kansai Medical University Hospital
between 2009 and 2015 were extracted from our institutional database for retrospective chart review and used in this study. That is,
completely resected pTNM (pathological stages (pStages)) pathologically with a pathological diagnosis of NSCLC. In this paper, the main
study was conducted using samples of lung adenocarcinomas, which were classiﬁed into the following histopathological types: lepidic
(LPA), acinar (APA), papillary (PPA), micropapillary (MPA), and solid (SPA) adenocarcinomas. 11 cases for each subtype, 30 males, 25 females,
and ages from 52 to 86 patients’ data were used. Distributions of ages for each subtype are not signiﬁcantly different. The average and the
standard deviation of ages for each subtype are 69.73 G 7.73 for LPA, 67.64 G 10.35 for APA, 69.00 G 8.00 for PPA, 65.45 G 7.31 for MPA, and
67.53 G 8.06 for SPA.
METHOD DETAILS
Cellular potts model
For our simulations we used CompuCell3D (CC3D) software (https://compucell3d.org/).16 CC3D is an implementation of the Cellular Pots
Model (CPM) that simulates cells as sets of pixels in a 2D or 3D lattice. To reproduce the apical – basal – lateral morphology of the epithelial
cell layer, compartmentalized cells were used for both the cancer and normal lung epithelial cells. These two cell types consisted of apical,
basal, lateral, and cytosolic sub-compartments in the model (inset of Figure 2A). The two virtual epithelial cell types have similar characteristics
and are columnar epithelial layer cells. They have lateral adhesions to adjacent epithelial cells, apical membranes facing the luminal side, and
basal membranes connecting to the stromal tissue (Figure 2A). In addition, the model included non-compartmentalized stromal cells, and
portions of extracellular matrix and mucin, which were modeled as small pseudo-cells. The luminal space was ﬁlled with CC3D ‘‘medium’’,
which is a special cell type that lacks volume constraints. Cell compartments and compartment aggregates (‘‘compartmental cells’’) and reg-
ular non-compartmental, cells included target volume and energy scaling factor parameters along with deﬁnitions of adhesion energies both
within compartment cells (e.g., between the cytosolic and basal sub-compartments) as well as adhesions between different cells. Note that no
surface constraints were used on any of the cells, cell compartments or pseudo-cells.
The models are two dimensional (2D) and were run on a square lattice measuring 500 by 500 pixels. A lattice pixel represents approxi-
mately 1 mm and cells were typically about 10x10 pixels, though the exact sizes change for different cell types and state during model execu-
tion. The columnar epithelial cells were nominally 10 pixels wide and 30 pixels tall. The CPM ‘‘neighbor order’’ was three, meaning each pixel
functionally has 12 neighbor pixels over which effects can be felt. The CPM algorithm is an energy trajectory that samples a time course of
plausible conﬁguration and is not a pure energy minimizer. The range of acceptable conﬁguration energies is controlled by a Bohltzman Dis-
tribution using a ‘‘Potts Temperature’’. This ‘‘temperature’’ controls acceptable ranges of energies that the simulation can access. A Potts
‘‘temperature’’ of 10 was used for most of our simulations. The Simulations were run for between 5000 and 50,000 Monty Carlo Steps
(MCS) with each MCS representing approximately 2 h of simulated time. Therefore, simulations typically represented a time course in the
range of two months to one year. Our key time calibration is a 24-h mitosis cycle for cell division. Beyond that basic timescale, we accelerated
times somewhat to make simulations more practical. Since the CPM is a stochastic model, we ran 10 replicate simulations for each parameter
set. Metrics, such as cell counts, were averaged over the replicates.
The source code for all the CC3D models is available as a ZIP archive from https://hdl.handle.net/2022/29394.
The cell types, parameters, and variables used in the simulations are available in the source code ﬁles and are summarized in the Supple-
mental Tables listed below.

Fluorescent immunostaining analysis
2 mm diameter circular tissue columns were extracted from the parafﬁn blocks of the 55 LUAD tissues and embedded into single blocks to
produce tissue microarrays (TMAs). Each TMA contains one tonsil tissue and 11 tissues from one of the LUAD subtypes. Sections from TMAs
were stained with primary, and ﬂuorescent labeled secondary antibodies. We used the following dye and antibodies: Hoechst 33342 (Thermo
Fisher, #H1399), anti-Pan-Keratin (Cell Signaling, #4545), cleaved-Caspase-3 (Asp175) (Cell Signaling, #9661), and EpCAM (MOC-31) (Invitro-
gen, #MA5-12442). Fluorescent images were obtained through an upright microscope (BX63; Olympus) with a cooled charge-coupled device

(CCD) camera (ORCA-R2; Hamamatsu Photonics) and a 10x, 0.40 NA, objective (Olympus). Obtained images were analyzed with Spectral
Unmixing Plugin installed in ImageJ.35
Lung adenocarcinoma cell culture and knockdown (KD) experiments
We cultured PC9 lung adenocarcinoma cells with RPMI1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin
(PC9 culture media). We used lentivirus vectors to express shRNAs. Lentivirus vectors were produced by transfections of packaging plasmids
and a transfer plasmid with EndoFectin lenti (GeneCopoeia, #EF001) transfection reagent into Hek293TA packaging cells (GeneCopoeia).
Hek293TA cells were cultured with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Lentivirus containing me-
dium was harvested after 48 h of transfection and concentrated with 8% polyethylene glycol. Infected PC9 cells were selected with 1 mg/mL
puromycin (InvivoGen, ant-pr-1). We used the following packaging vectors and transfer vectors: psPAX2 (Addgene, Plasmid #12260), pCMV-
VSV-G (RIKEN BRC, RDB04392), scramble shRNA (Addgene, Plasmid #1864),38 and shRNA expressing transfer plasmid (Sigma-Aldrich,
MISSION shRNA) for ITGA11 (TRCN0000057757).
Materials
psPAX2 was a gift from Didier Trono (Addgene plasmid # 12260; http://n2t.net/addgene:12260; RRID:Addgene_12260). The pCMV-VSV-G
was provided by the RIKEN BRC through the National BioResource Project of the MEXT, Japan (cat. RDB04392).
Spheroid culture and analysis
Cell lines were cultured in 2% methylcellulose (MC) containing PC9 culture media. MC media was produced as described.23 Brieﬂy, 2 g MC
(M0512; Sigma-Aldrich) was bottled with stirrer bar and autoclaved. 100 mL PC9 culture media was applied in the bottle, and the
solution was stirred overnight to dissolve the MC in a refrigerator (4C). Cells were suspended in the culture media at the concentration of
0.5 3 105 cells/mL. Then, 1 mL each droplet was added into the MC media, and cultured for one week. Each droplet grew as a spheroid.
The bright ﬁeld images were obtained with an inverted microscope (CKX53; Olympus) with a CCD camera (DP23M; Olympus), a 43, and
a 103 objectives (Olympus).
Pre-staining of the PC9 cell lines and MEFs were performed before starting of the mixture cultures. Suspended single cells of PC9 cell lines
and MEFs were placed in separate 1.5 mL tubes and incubated with 1 mM MitoTracker (ThermoFisher) and 13 Track It Red (Cell Explorer Live
Cell Tracking Kit Red Fluorescence, AAT Bioquest), respectively, in a CO2 incubator at 37C for 1 h. The stained cells were mixed at 1:1 ratio
and cultured for one week in MC media. The ﬂuorescent images were obtained with FV3000 scanning confocal microscope (Olympus) with a
103 objective (Olympus), a 488, and a 561 lasers (Olympus).
The perimeter and area of each spheroid were analyzed with ImageJ. The structural differences can be measured by the ratio of perimeter
and area of the spheroids. Since the perimeter is not only related to the structural complexity but also the size of spheres, we normalized the
perimeter (P) and the area (A) of each spheroid. Assuming the shape of each spheroid is a circle, we estimated the radiuses (R) from the perim-
eter and the area separately. The equation for the radiuses from the perimeter (Rp) and the area (Ra) are:
Rp = P
2p; Ra =
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
A=p
p
The two radiuses (Rp and Ra) estimated separately from P and A were divided by Ra to calculate normalized radiuses (nRp and nRa). We
calculated the normalized perimeter (nP) and the normalized area (nA) with the two different normalized radiuses.
nP = 2pRp; nA = pRa2
The ratio of nP and nA (nP/nA) is used as the index of the structural complexity of each spheroid.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Analysis of differential gene expressions and mutations among the LUAD subtypes
We used RNA expression data of the LUAD subtypes reported by Soltis et al.,8 which contains sequencing data of RNA extracted from 4 lepi-
dic, 27 acinar, 15 papillary, 4 micropapillary, and 32 solid predominant adenocarcinoma tissues. The data was downloaded from dbGap study
accession #phs003011.v1.p1, from the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons at https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/APOLLO-
LUAD-2022.
To ﬁnd the differentially expressed genes between each combination of the LUAD subtypes, we performed likelihood ratio tests using the
edgeR R package.36 The differential gene data were used to draw volcano plots with the Enhanced Volcano R package.37 Gene ontology (GO)
analyses for differentially expressed genes were calculated with the ClusterProﬁler R package.17 Differential genes with p-values smaller than
0.05 were analyzed. We used the Cellular Component sub-ontology dataset for the analyses. In Figure 5, the GO terms were replotted against
the p-values and p-adjusted values with Igor Pro 4.04 (WaveMetrics). The graphs were edited by Illustrator CS 5.1 (Adobe) to modify the size of
each circular marker and add the annotation of GO terms. The sizes of circular markers and the annotations were relative to the number of the
signiﬁcant genes in each GO term.

were detected from the list of mutation genes with online tool intOgen.33 Heat maps for the somatic synonymous mutation results were
created with the online tool Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus).
Survival analysis
The correlations between the differential genes and survival in the LUAD patients were determined with Kaplan-Meier Plotter.19 We used
gene chip analyzed mRNA expression of the differential genes from a total of 1162 LUAD patients. We also analyzed patients’ smoking
histories.
Mutation analysis
We used data reported by Soltis et al.8 Gene expressions data of 53 genes listed in Table S5 was divided to two groups dependent on the
existence of non-synonymous mutation in each cancer driver gene. Expression levels (FPKM values) of the each two group were compared
with Student’s t test. Average FPKM value of non-synonymous mutation group was divided by that of no mutation/synonymous mutation
group to calculate fold change for each gene.
3D analysis of ﬂuorescent stained spheroids and statistical analysis
3D spheroid images obtained by FV3000 scanning microscope (Olympus) were analyzed by Imaris 10.0 software. Each ﬂuorescent spot was
detected, and average distance to 9 nearest neighbors of each spot was measured. The software output the mean and standard deviation
(SD) of the distance for all spots in single spheroid. We analyzed 8 spheroids for each experimental condition.
The total mean value was calculated from total sum of distances and total number of spots. The total SD value was calculated from total
sum of squared deviation and total number of spots. Students’ t-test was performed by the calculation of the statistic amount from the total
number of spots, the total averages, and the total SD values, and the statistic amount was compared to studentized range list. F-test was
performed by the calculation of the statistic amount from the total sum of squared deviation and the total number of spots, and the statistic
amount was compared to F-distribution list.
