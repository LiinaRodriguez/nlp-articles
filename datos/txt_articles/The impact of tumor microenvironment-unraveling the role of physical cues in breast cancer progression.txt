receptors: estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor 
(PR). Luminal-like tumors (luminal A and luminal B) make 
up ~ 70% of all breast tumors [3–5]. Luminal A tumors are 
generally associated with a more favorable prognosis and 
typically express ER and PR. In contrast, luminal B tumors, 
while also expressing ER, display lower expression of PR 
and exhibit a higher rate of proliferation than luminal A 
tumors, resulting in a less favorable prognosis [3–5]. HER2 
positive tumors, which comprise ~ 15% of all breast cancers, 
express high levels of HER2 but lack ER, and PR expres­
sion [3–5]. These tumors are associated with a less favor­
able outlook compared to luminal tumors. Triple-negative 
breast cancer (~ 15% of all breast cancers) lacks expression 
of ER, PR, and HER2, making targeted therapies ineffec­
tive and resulting in worse survival rates compared to other 
subtypes [3–5].
The lack of strategies to clinically interrupt and treat the 
metastatic spread of tumor cells accounts for the vast major­
ity of breast cancer-associated deaths. This is supported 
by data showing that the 5-year survival rate for women 
diagnosed with distant-stage breast cancer is 29% versus 
85–99% for those diagnosed with local- or regional-stage 
disease [6]. During metastasis, a tiny fraction of tumor cells 
splits away from the primary tumor region enters the cir­
culation (intravasation) and exits (extravasation) to form a 
secondary tumor at a distant region (Fig. 1) [7, 8]. These

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven­
tion, breast cancer is the second leading cause of death 
among women in the US. Breast cancers are often classi­
fied based on their invasive potential. Ductal carcinoma in 
situ is a non-invasive type of breast cancer characterized 
by the uncontrolled proliferation of neoplastic epithelial 
cells, which remain localized within the mammary ducts 
[1]. In contrast, invasive breast cancers originate primarily 
in the milk ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma) or breast lob­
ules (invasive lobular carcinoma) and can spread to nearby 
breast tissues or even metastasize to other body parts [1, 
2]. Breast cancers can also be categorized into different 
subtypes based on the expression levels of the human epi­
dermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and two hormone

Abstract
Metastasis accounts for the vast majority of breast cancer-related fatalities. Although the contribution of genetic and epi­
genetic modifications to breast cancer progression has been widely acknowledged, emerging evidence underscores the piv­
otal role of physical stimuli in driving breast cancer metastasis. In this review, we summarize the changes in the mechanics 
of the breast cancer microenvironment and describe the various forces that impact migrating and circulating tumor cells 
throughout the metastatic process. We also discuss the mechanosensing and mechanotransducing molecules responsible for 
promoting the malignant phenotype in breast cancer cells. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the mechanobiology 
of breast cancer carries substantial potential to propel progress in prognosis, diagnosis, and patient treatment.

physical cues, including interstitial fluid pressure, matrix 
stiffness, solid stress, viscoelasticity, confining 3D topogra­
phies, hydraulic resistance, extracellular fluid viscosity, and 
drag forces (Fig. 2; Table 1) [9, 10].
Emerging evidence demonstrates that tumor cells pos­
sess the ability to sense and interpret these signals through 
mechanosensors and mechanotransducers, including mech­
anosensitive ion channels (e.g., ion channels that belong to 
the transient receptor potential (TRP) family), ion transport­
ers, focal adhesions, cytoskeletal elements, nuclear proteins, 
and transcription factors. In response to physical stimuli, 
these molecules can initiate signal transduction, modulate 
the intracellular ion concentration (e.g., calcium, sodium, 
and chloride), influence cellular tension, volume, and shape, 
and trigger transcriptional changes, thereby contributing to 
therapeutic resistance and mediating profound changes in 
cellular functions, including division, and migration (see 
sections below). This review describes the contributions 
of the aforementioned physical cues to breast tumor pro­
gression and discusses the underlying mechanosensing 
mechanisms. In our opinion, unraveling the diverse mecha­
noresponses of breast tumor cells will facilitate the develop­
ment of new therapeutic approaches to combat breast cancer 
progression.

2  Interstitial fluid pressure
The hydrostatic and osmotic pressure differences between 
the vasculature and the surrounding tissue move fluid out 
from the blood vessels to the interstitium, allowing the sup­
ply of nutrients and oxygen to the resident tissue cells [11]. 
The lymphatic system serves the purpose of maintaining 
interstitial fluid homeostasis and removing unwanted waste 
products. As a result, the IFP of normal breast parenchyma is 
~ 0 mm Hg [12]. The increased demands of growing tumors 
in nutrients and oxygen triggers the formation of new blood 
vessels, a process called angiogenesis. The tumors’ tortuous 
and hyperpermeable vessels [13–16] and the near absence 
of functional lymphatic vessels [17, 18] raise the interstitial 
fluid pressure (IFP) within breast tumors (Table 2). Using

antibody [30, 39, 40]. In addition to antiangiogenic agents, 
certain chemotherapeutic agents have shown promising 
results in suppressing IFP. Taxanes, such as paclitaxel and 
docetaxel have been found to inhibit angiogenesis at low 
concentrations [41–44], and promote vascular decompres­
sion, effectively suppressing IFP in mouse mammary car­
cinoma [45]. These positive outcomes have been extended 
to breast cancer patients, where paclitaxel administration 
resulted in a ~ 40% reduction in IFP and improved tumor 
oxygenation [46]. However, it is important to note that not 
all chemotherapeutic agents have the same impact. For 
instance, doxorubicin does not elicit significant effects on 
oxygen levels and fails to ameliorate IFP in breast cancer 
patients [46].
Despite the well-established increase in IFP within 
breast tumors, our understanding of how breast cancer cells 
respond to this physical stimulus remains elusive due to the 
scarcity of reliable in vitro platforms that permit adjustment 
of pressure independent of changes in pH or the dissolved 
concentration of gases. Moreover, experiments are often 
performed under supraphysiological pressures [47–49] that 
are orders of magnitude larger than those sensed by tumor 
cells in vivo. Recent work has revealed that breast tumor 
cells possess the ability to detect subtle hydrostatic pressure 
changes, as low as 0.02 mmHg [50]. This extraordinary sen­
sitivity is mediated by the activation of the mechanosensi­
tive transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M 
member 7 (TRPM7), which in turn triggers calcium ions 
(Ca2+) influx, thereby promoting a thicker actomyosin cor­
tex [50]. Considering these intriguing findings, it is reason­
able to expect that the substantially higher IFP levels found 
within tumors would have a profound impact on tumor cell 
behavior. Indeed, exposure of tumor cells to elevated, yet 
physiologically relevant, pressure, using a pressurized cul­
tured system that maintains a constant pH, has been found 
to increase or decrease cell proliferation, depending on the 
cancer cell type [51]. Moreover, increased pressure has been 
shown to enhance cancer cell migration and resistance to 
the anticancer drug doxorubicin by upregulating the water 
channel aquaporin 1 [52] and the efflux transporter ABCC1 
[53], respectively. Further research is needed to fully eluci­
date the effects of IFP on breast cancer metastasis as well 
as the mechanisms governing pressure-induced responses.
3  Extracellular matrix stiffness
The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a key component of the 
tumor microenvironment, providing structural support and 
acting as a reservoir of cues, including biophysical signals 
such as matrix stiffness and viscoelasticity. The ECM of the 
healthy mammary gland includes glycosaminoglycans and 
a small number of patients, Jain’s group has reported that 
IFP scales with breast tumor aggressiveness [19]. In this 
study, the IFP range was between 4 and 33 mm Hg, with the 
highest pressure measurements recorded in advanced breast 
tumors [19]. These findings have been corroborated by oth­
ers, who have demonstrated elevated IFP in invasive ductal 
carcinomas relative to benign tumors or noninvasive carci­
nomas and a positive correlation between tumor size and 
IFP [12]. In addition to human breast tumors, IFP increases 
in experimental models of breast cancer, such as severe 
combined immunodeficient mice bearing highly invasive, 
triple-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer tumors 
[20] and BN472 rat mammary carcinomas [21].
Micropuncture and wick-in-needle are the gold standard 
techniques for measuring IFP. Despite yielding the most 
reliable values and being less traumatic, micropuncture is 
limited by its depth of penetration which does not exceed 
1 mm [11]. Thus, researchers gravitate towards the wick-
in-needle technique which enables deeper penetration. 
Noninvasive methods for assessing IFP include intravoxel 
incoherent motion-diffusion weighted imaging [22], ultra­
sound poroelastography [23] and contrast-enhanced mag­
netic resonance imaging [24].
Although the IFP is relatively uniform throughout the 
breast tumor, it decreases significantly at its edge [25]. This 
pressure gradient triggers outward convection, creating 
a barrier to effective drug delivery [26, 27] and influenc­
ing breast cancer cell behavior (see also the “Drag forces” 
section below). A strategic way to circumvent the impaired 
transport of therapeutic agents is to reduce IFP and thereby 
improve tumor perfusion. This can be achieved using 
antiangiogenic agents which promote vascular normaliza­
tion [28, 29]. For instance, the administration of the anti- 
VEGF-receptor-2 antibody DC101 enhances penetration of 
therapeutic molecules and nanomedicines up to the size of 
~ 12  nm [30]. Abraxane, formulated with albumin-bound 
nanoparticles and the cancer chemotherapy agent paclitaxel, 
is a nanomedicine within this size range that has been effec­
tive in breast cancer treatments [30–32]. Targeting VEGF 
due to its over-secretion during tumor progression has also 
prompted the use of bevacizumab, an anti-human VEGF 
monoclonal antibody that reduces the growth of tumor ves­
sels [33, 34]. Bevacizumab has been used in many breast 
cancer clinical trials in combination with chemotherapy. 
However, these combination therapies have not shown a 
significant increase in overall survival compared to chemo­
therapy alone [35–38]. This lack of significant improvement 
may be attributed to the activation of VEGF-independent 
angiogenic pathways, the recruitment of proangiogenic stro­
mal cells, the induction of vasculogenesis or even the dose 
of the antiangiogenic agent used, which may reduce the size 
of blood vessel pores, further obstructing the delivery of this

(Table 3). Besides CAFs, breast cancer cells can also trig­
ger ECM stiffening by increasing the tension of ECM fibers 
[71]. The quantification of ECM stiffness can serve as a 
valuable diagnostic and prognostic marker for breast can­
cer [72–74], improving physicians’ clinical assessment of 
tumor status and their capability to predict patient outcomes.
Stiffness measurements have demonstrated that the 
invasive front of HER2 positive and triple-negative human 
breast cancers is stiffer compared to luminal A and lumi­
nal B breast tumors [75]. Elevated stiffness promotes breast 
tumor progression by increasing angiogenesis and vascular 
permeability [76] as well as breast cancer cell prolifera­
tion [77], stemness [78], and metastasis [70]. Importantly, 
matrix stiffness can activate the epithelial to mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) program, resulting in a partial EMT state 
[79], which is distinguished by the simultaneous presence 
of both epithelial and mesenchymal traits, enabling a more 
efficient collective cell migration and invasion [80]. This 
stiffness-induced hybrid EMT state can be regulated at least 
in part by the transcription factor Twist1 [79]. In soft envi­
ronments, Twist1 remains cytoplasmic by binding to Ras 
GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 2 (G3BP2) [79]. 
However, matrix stiffening promotes the dissociation of the 
Twist1-G3BP2 complex, and the translocation of Twist1 
to the nucleus, where it initiates EMT, thereby promot­
ing breast tumor invasion and metastasis [79]. In addition, 
breast cancer cells that express the EMT transcription fac­
tors Twist1, Snail1, and Six1 can enhance the migratory and 
metastatic potential of neighboring, non EMT tumor cells 
by activating the GLI-induced transcription factor in a non-
cell autonomous manner [81].
proteoglycans (e.g., hyaluronan and versican), fibrillar col­
lagens (e.g., type I and type III collagen), basement mem­
brane proteins (e.g., collagen type IV and laminins), and 
fibronectin [56]. During breast cancer, tumor cells recruit 
resident fibroblasts [57], adipocytes [58], and/or bone 
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells [59], transform­
ing them into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which 
in turn reshape and remodel the tumor microenvironment. 
To induce this transformation, tumor cells secrete signaling 
molecules (e.g., Wnt7a [60], and osteopontin [61, 62]), and 
release exosomes containing miRNAs (e.g., miR-9 [63] or 
miR-125b [64]) and proteins like survivin [65].
Typically, CAFs overexpress alpha-smooth muscle actin 
(α-SMA), Vimentin, platelet-derived growth factor recep­
tor α (PDGFRα), PDGFRβ, Tenascin-C, Caveolin 1, fibro­
blast activation protein (FAP), and ferroptosis suppressor 
protein 1 (FSP1) [66]. However, it is important to note that 
while these markers are commonly associated with CAFs, 
they are not limited exclusively to this cell type. Other cell 
types, such as normal fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and 
pericytes, also express them. In addition to their role in 
promoting breast cancer cell proliferation [67] and mediat­
ing inflammation [68], breast CAFs deposit collagen type 
I and fibronectin [58], secrete matrix metalloproteinases 
(MMPs) [69], and promote collagen crosslinking (e.g., via 
lysyl oxidase (LOX)) [70]. These alterations in the tumor 
ECM induce an increase in its stiffness, typically evalu­
ated using techniques that either require direct contact with 
the sample (e.g., atomic force microscopy), or measure the 
tumor mechanical properties in a contact-free manner (e.g., 
shear wave elastography, magnetic resonance elastography)

Substrate stiffness can also act as a guiding cue for 
migrating tumor cells. Research indicates that cells respond 
to stiffness gradients through a process called durotaxis 
(from Latin “durus” meaning hard and Greek “taxis” mean­
ing arrangement), initially observed using fibroblasts [82]. 
While certain tumor cells, like MDA-MB-231 cells, dis­
play positive durotaxis by moving from soft (0.5 kPa), to 
stiff (22 kPa) substrates [95, 96], others, such as U-251MG 
glioblastoma brain tumor cells, undergo negative durotaxis, 
migrating from 22 kPa regions towards softer, 10 kPa, areas 
[96]. Recent work has significantly advanced our under­
standing of the intricate mechanisms that govern these 
diverse durotactic responses. By employing a combination 
of experimental and computational approaches, the Odde 
lab demonstrated that cells preferentially move toward areas 
of optimal stiffness, where they produce maximum traction 
forces [96]. For U-251MG cells, this optimal stiffness has 
been found to be ~ 10 kPa, while for MDA-MB-231 cells, 
it is ~ 20 kPa. Interestingly, negative durotaxis of U-251MG 
cells can be reversed by a partial reduction in myosin motors 
which increases the optimal stiffness of these cells. On the 
other hand, talin knockdown promotes negative durotaxis 
of MDA-MB-231 cells by suppressing adhesion reinforce­
ment, which is observed on ~ 20 kPa substrates [96].
Therapeutic approaches aimed at targeting CAFs and 
their products show promise in suppressing breast tumor 
progression. Attractive targets include members of the 
LOX family, namely LOX and LOX-like 2 (LOXL2), 
which mediate collagen and/or elastin crosslinking [97, 
98], thereby contributing to ECM remodeling in the tumor 
microenvironment. Chemical inhibition of LOX activity 
using β-Aminopropionitrile (BAPN) has been shown to 
increase tumor latency and decrease tumor incidence in the 
mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Neu model [70]. 
BAPN also re-sensitizes triple-negative breast cancer cells 
to chemotherapy as seen in different triple-negative breast 
cancer models, including chemoresistant xenografts, synge­
neic tumors and PDX models [99]. Moreover, in a xenograft 
mammary 4T1 tumor model, it has been demonstrated that 
the concurrent administration of BAPN and the enzyme-
responsive drug (NQO1-SN38), designed to target breast 
tumors with the topoisomerase I inhibitor SN38, results in 
a cooperative reduction in tumor growth [100]. The cop­
per chelator tetrathiomolybdate, which blocks the copper-
dependent catalytic activity of LOX, is presently undergoing 
a phase II study (NCT00195091) involving patients with 
breast cancer at moderate to high risk of recurrence. Fur­
thermore, chemical or genetic inhibition of LOXL2 sig­
nificantly reduces metastasis in orthotopic and transgenic 
breast cancer models [101]. Elevated LOXL2 expression in 
estrogen receptor-negative breast tumors is strongly associ­
ated with unfavorable outcomes, including poor prognosis, 
Cells perceive elevated stiffness primarily through integ­
rins, which promote cell spreading and Ras homolog family 
member A (RhoA)-dependent cytoskeleton tension [82–85, 
77]. As a result, increased stiffness triggers the transloca­
tion of the transcription factor co-activators Yes-associated 
protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-
binding motif (TAZ) to the nucleus where they interact with 
the transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) fam­
ily of transcription factors to induce gene expression [85]. 
In contrast, low stiffness increases the activity of the Ras-
related GTPase RAP2 which inactivates RhoA and induces 
the phosphorylation of the large tumor suppressor kinase 
1/2 (LATS1/2). In turn, LATS1/2 phosphorylate YAP/TAZ 
to inactivate them, promoting their cytoplasmic localization 
[86].
Elevated YAP nuclear levels have been detected in CAFs 
within adenoma and carcinoma lesions in mice as well as 
in stromal fibroblasts of human breast cancer. Interventions 
aimed at reducing YAP levels or increasing their activity 
in CAFs provide evidence that YAP is essential for CAFs-
dependent tumor cell invasion, matrix stiffening, and angio­
genesis [87]. Interestingly, in contrast to CAFs, YAP nuclear 
intensity exhibits a significant decrease in both ductal car­
cinoma in situ and in invasive ductal carcinomas [88, 89]. 
This decrease is likely attributed to the loss of stress fibers 
and the reduction of nuclear area, which are observed in 3D 
environments but not on 2D surfaces [89]. The loss of YAP 
in breast cancer leads to increased tumor cell invasion, pro­
liferation, resistance to chemotherapeutics, and protection 
against cell death, suggesting that YAP acts as a tumor sup­
pressor [88].
Matrix stiffness has been shown to strongly influence the 
migration of breast cancer cells. Experiments conducted 
using a polyacrylamide-based microchannel device that 
allows independent control of substrate stiffness and chan­
nel dimensions revealed that optimal migration of triple-
negative MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 human breast cancer 
cells occurs at intermediate stiffness [90]. This biphasic 
stiffness dependence finds its explanation in the motor-
clutch model. According to this model, myosin motors, 
actin cytoskeleton, and cell adhesion molecules like inte­
grins (clutches) cooperate and coordinate to facilitate cell 
migration [91–93]. The motor-clutch model predicts that 
cells generate maximal traction force at intermediate stiff­
ness [92]. Moreover, it demonstrates that a change in the 
number of motors and clutches can alter the optimal stiff­
ness for cell migration [92]. While these predictions have 
been experimentally confirmed [93], it has been observed 
that the optimal stiffness is often masked because, beyond 
a certain stiffness threshold, talin mediates adhesion rein­
forcement, leading to an increase in cell traction [94].

in measuring solid stress in vivo, its clinical applicability 
is hindered by the need for intravital window implantation.
In vitro and in vivo studies have provided valuable 
insights into how compressive stress affects breast cancer 
cell behavior. Initial studies using cancer cells embedded 
in non-degradable agarose gels showed that compressive 
stress exerted by the confining matrix on the mammary 
tumor spheroids suppresses proliferation and survival [117, 
118]. However, more recently, it has been shown that tumor 
cells, including MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 breast cancer 
cells, display increased proliferation when subjected to 
confining stress from stiff (> 30 kPa), degradable, 3D, hyal­
uronan-based gels, compared to softer (~ 4 kPa) hydrogels 
[119]. These stiff gels activate the mechanosensitive ion 
channel (MIC) TRPV4, which upregulates the activity of 
the phatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3k)/Akt pathway, trigger­
ing the expression of heat shock protein-(HSP-) 70, which 
protects against stress-induced cell death [119]. Moreover, 
HSP-70 enhances tumorigenicity and metastasis in murine 
models and promotes the expression of stemness markers 
(Nanog, Oct3/4, and SOX2) in stiff hydrogels by increasing 
the activity of the transcription factor signal transducer and 
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) [119]. The disparity in 
findings across studies could stem from the characteristics 
of the hydrogel system used, such as its degradability and its 
initial stiffness. Additionally, differences in cell lines (e.g., 
P53 status) could lead to divergent cell responses to solid 
stress.
Furthermore, the application of external compressive 
stress of 0.77 kPa has yielded diverse migratory responses in 
breast cancer cells. While highly aggressive triple-negative 
4T1 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells show increased 
migration under this stress, non-metastatic, luminal A 
MCF7 breast cancer cells experience a significant reduc­
tion in motility [120]. Compression-induced invasion and 
migration of breast cancer cells are attributed to the activa­
tion of the MIC Piezo 1 [121] and the formation of leader 
cells, which possess filopodia at their leading-edge, thereby 
driving persistent and directional motility [120]. Interest­
ingly, the application of low-magnitude compressive stress 
(0.03 kPa) on weakly adhesive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer 
cells decreases their motility, highlighting the critical role of 
cell-matrix interactions in stress-dependent cell responses 
[122].
Besides its role in regulating cell division, viability, and 
motility, compressive forces can also influence gene expres­
sion [123]. Compression- or actomyosin-mediated nuclear 
flattening alters the permeability across nuclear pore com­
plexes, resulting in active nuclear import of key transcrip­
tion regulators such as YAP, SMAD3, Twist1, and Snail 
[124, 125]. Compressive stress also induces promoter hyper­
methylation of microRNA-9 (miR-9) precursors, leading to 
decreased overall survival, and reduced metastasis-free 
survival, suggesting that LOXL2 could serve as a valuable 
prognostic marker for metastasis in breast cancer cases. The 
antibody simtuzumab, targeting extracellular LOXL2, has 
undergone clinical trials in combination with gemcitabine 
for patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma or 
with FOLFIRI (folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan) for 
patients with KRAS mutant colorectal cancer [102, 103]. 
However, the addition of these chemotherapeutics does 
not yield improved clinical outcomes, presumably because 
simtuzumab exclusively inhibits extracellular LOXL2. 
Phase I and phase II trials are also underway to assess the 
safety and pharmacokinetics of small molecule inhibitors of 
LOXL2, such as GB2064 (NCT04679870) and PXS-5382 A 
(NCT04183517). It is noteworthy that as of now, these 
inhibitors have not been tested for breast cancer treatment.
4  Solid stress: compressive and residual 
stress
Breast cancer growth as well as collagen and hyaluronan 
deposition within the confined tissue environment results in 
the buildup of mechanical stress (aka solid stress) within 
tumors. This stress squeezes lymphatic and blood vessels, 
elevating IFP, hindering the effective delivery of chemother­
apeutics, and promoting hypoxia [111, 112]. Two primary 
factors contribute to solid stress: compressive and residual 
stress [111, 113–115]. Compressive stress arises from the 
surrounding healthy tissue as it counteracts tumor growth. 
Residual stress is generated from intratumoral cell-cell, 
cell-ECM interactions, and consequently, persists even after 
tumor excision [115]. In human breast tumors, this stress is 
estimated to range from 10 to 19 kPa [115]. Although ultra­
sonography has enabled the in situ evaluation of 1D pro­
file of solid stresses within glioblastoma tumors [111], the 
estimation of both the isotropic and anisotropic components 
of the stress tensor exerted on cells and tissues remained 
elusive until recently. This has been addressed through the 
use of multimodal intravital microscopy of deformable and 
adjustable in size fluorescently-labelled polyacrylamide 
beads that allow spatiotemporal measurements of solid 
stress applied to relatively small animal tumors in vivo 
[116]. This innovative technique has revealed that the solid 
stress imposed on murine breast tumors is ~ 2 kPa, a mag­
nitude 5 to 8 times higher than the stress that individual 
cancer cells sense within the primary tumor [116]. Intrigu­
ingly, breast cancer cells in metastatic lung tumors experi­
ence higher magnitude of solid stress compared to those in 
the primary tumor, underscoring the key role of the local 
microenvironment in modulating solid stress during cancer 
progression [116]. Despite the significance of this method

relative to benign and normal tissues [139–141]. Moreover, 
the indentation method has revealed that human breast 
tumors exhibit stress relaxation half time of ~ 10 s [142].
The Chaudhuri lab investigated the effects of viscoelas­
ticity on tumor cell behavior using alginate gels with vary­
ing stress relaxation times. They found that the 2D motility 
of HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells, MDA-MB-231 breast can­
cer cells, and normal breast epithelial MCF-10 A cells is 
faster on fast- (~ 100 s) relative to slow-relaxing (~ 2,000 s), 
soft (2 kPa) substrates [143]. This effect is attributed to the 
increased formation of nascent adhesions and filopodia at 
the cell periphery and cell front, respectively [143]. In addi­
tion to promoting cell migration, fast- (~ 60 s) but not slow- 
(~ 6,000 s) relaxing hydrogels allow breast cancer cells to 
grow in size and divide in 3D confining environments. Cell 
growth, controlled by sodium-hydrogen ion exchangers 
(NHEs), induces MIC-dependent activation of the PI3K/
Akt pathway, which in turn supports the cytoplasmic local­
ization of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1, resulting in tumor 
cell proliferation [142]. Furthermore, measurements have 
shown that human breast tumors display plastic deforma­
tion (i.e., permanent deformation when subjected to external 
forces) [144], likely due to the increased collagen concen­
tration and crosslinking observed in the breast tumor micro­
environment which can enhance plasticity [145]. To model 
this plastic behavior, 3D hydrogels composed of reconsti­
tuted basement membrane and alginate are used. Increased 
plasticity has been shown to facilitate protease-independent 
migration of breast cancer cells by promoting the formation 
of invadopodia protrusions, which in turn generate contrac­
tile forces to create migratory paths for the cells [144].
6  Cellular confinement
Microscopy techniques, including intravital microscopy, 
have revealed that metastatic cancer cells traverse microen­
vironments that impose different levels of confinement on 
cells. Examples of such environments are microvessels with 
diameters smaller than the size of tumor cells [146], nar­
row (~ 1–5 μm-sized) gaps between endothelial cells [147], 
micropores with diameters ranging from 1 to 20 μm [148], 
ECM fibers [149], and longitudinal, channel-like tracks with 
widths ranging from 3 to 30 μm [150]. Advances in pattern­
ing, materials and microfabrication techniques have enabled 
researchers to isolate and investigate the effects of confine­
ment on tumor cell behavior. In vitro models to study con­
finement-induced responses include micropatterned lines 
[151], 2D micropatterned substrates [85], uni-axial com­
pression [152], polydimethylsiloxane [153–156]- or poly­
acrylamide [90]-based microchannel devices, microniches 
[157, 158], and natural hydrogels [148, 159]. These versatile 
miR-9 downregulation, which increases VEGFA expression 
[126]. This mechanism, which is observed in breast CAFs, 
as well as in luminal B (BT-474) and triple-negative (MDA-
MB-231) breast cancer cells, but not in HER2 (SK-BR-3) 
and luminal A (MCF7) tumor cells, may contribute to angio­
genesis in breast tumors [126].
Interventions aimed at blocking collagen and hyaluronan 
production, such as a neutralizing antibody against TGF-β 
[127], the angiotensin inhibitor losartan [128–131], or the 
antifibrotic drugs tranilast and pirfenidone [132–134] have 
shown promising results in alleviating solid stress and 
increasing breast tumor blood supply and drug delivery. As a 
result, these interventions boost the efficacy of chemothera­
peutic agents, markedly suppressing breast tumor growth in 
preclinical animal models of breast cancer [127–132, 134]. 
Importantly, a clinical study has demonstrated that combin­
ing radiotherapy with higher doses of the TGFβ-blocking 
antibody fresolimumab (10  mg/kg) increases overall sur­
vival significantly in metastatic breast cancer patients com­
pared to those undergoing radiotherapy and receiving lower 
doses of fresolimumab (1 mg/kg) [135]. Furthermore, in a 
phase II study, the combination of chemotherapy (albumin-
bound paclitaxel and gemcitabine) along with pegvorhyal­
uronidase alfa (PEGPH20), an agent designed to degrade 
hyaluronan, has been shown to improve progression-free 
survival in pancreatic cancer patients, especially those with 
hyaluronan-high tumors [136]. However, the potential effi­
cacy of such approach for breast cancer patients remains to 
be determined.
5  Viscoelasticity
Various living tissues and natural ECMs exhibit both vis­
cous (fluid-like) and elastic (spring-like) behavior. While 
purely elastic materials recover their shape following stress 
application, viscoelastic materials display (a) a time-depen­
dent stress decrease in response to a constant strain (aka 
stress relaxation), (b) a time-dependent strain increase under 
constant stress (aka creep), and (c) an energy dissipation 
and a delayed response as the materials undergo loading 
and unloading (aka hysteresis) [137]. Stress relaxation tests 
have revealed that the time it takes for biological tissues to 
relax to half the magnitude of the initially applied stress var­
ies significantly. For instance, the relaxation time can range 
from seconds in the brain, to minutes in the liver, and hours 
in the skin, with faster stress relaxation indicating increased 
viscoelasticity [138]. Although the investigation of the role 
of viscoelasticity in health and disease has recently just 
begun, techniques such as shear wave elastography, and 
magnetic resonance elastography have demonstrated that 
malignant breast tumors exhibit more viscoelastic behavior

composed of A- (A, C, C2) and B- (B1, B2, B3) type lam­
ins, a mesh-like network of intermediate filament proteins 
[175, 178, 179]. Lower levels of lamin-A induced by the 
PI3K/Akt pathway facilitate nuclear deformation in con­
finement, support breast cancer cell invasion and associate 
with reduced disease-free survival [174]. B-type lamins can 
also enhance nuclear stiffness, thereby impacting confined 
migration [180, 181]. Other factors contributing to nuclear 
rigidity include the chromatin organization [182] and the 
LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) com­
plex [183]. It is worth noting, that in addition to nuclear 
stiffness, A-and B-type lamins regulate other hallmarks of 
cancer, including cell proliferation and chromatin organi­
zation [184–186], underscoring their multifaceted role in 
tumor progression. Importantly, high lamin-B1 has been 
found to predict unfavorable outcomes in patients with dif­
ferent types of cancer [187].
Confinement exerts stress on the nucleus, triggering the 
formation of nuclear protrusions (aka nuclear blebs), which 
lack lamin B1 and nuclear pores and lead to transient rup­
tures of the nuclear envelope [188–190]. Actomyosin con­
tractility can compromise nuclear integrity by squeezing the 
nucleus dorsoventrally [191, 192], pulling it [193] or pro­
moting the nuclear influx of cytoplasmic constituents, which 
in turn pressurizes the nucleus, leading to its rupture [155]. 
Seminal studies have demonstrated that nuclear ruptures 
occur at sites characterized by pronounced curvature [194], 
leading to DNA damage and genomic instability [188–190]. 
These adverse effects stem from the entry of the cytoplasmic 
exonuclease TREX1 into the nucleus, which induces DNA 
cleavage [195], as well as the translocation of DNA repair 
factors such as Ku70, Ku80, and BRCA1 to the cytoplasm 
[190, 194]. Nuclear deformation can promote DNA damage 
even without instances of nuclear envelope ruptures. This 
type of DNA damage is more evident in MDA-MB-231 or 
BT-549 breast cancer cells, manifesting at replication forks 
and causing replication stress [196]. Although confinement 
suppresses MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation [160], it proves 
ineffective in inducing death in these cells as they harbor 
mutations in the gene encoding P53 [160]. P53 mutations 
are highly prevalent in breast tumors [197] potentially 
granting a survival advantage to breast cancer cells as they 
navigate mechanically challenging microenvironments.
Accumulating evidence suggests that tumor cell expo­
sure to confinement can promote breast cancer progression. 
The invasive front of confined breast tumors exhibits pro­
nounced nuclear deformation, nuclear rupture, and DNA 
damage [195]. A key player in the formation of invasive 
breast tumors is TREX1, which mediates confinement-
induced DNA damage, collagen degradation, and the 
acquisition of a hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal pheno­
type [195]. Additionally, confinement triggers resistance 
tools enable in-depth studies of cellular responses to 1D, 2D 
or 3D confinement [85, 148, 152, 159, 160], moderate or 
tight confinement [157, 158, 153–155, 160], short- or long-
term confinement [153–155, 160], and confining pores or 
channels [148, 159, 153–155]. Additionally, recent research 
has delved into the interplay between confinement and other 
physical cues (e.g., stiffness [90], viscoelasticity [142], and 
viscosity [161]) in relation to cancer cells, revealing their 
combined contributions to different cell processes.
It is well established that breast cancer cells alter their 
migration modes and mechanisms to adapt to 3D confine­
ment. Inhibition of key regulators of 2D cell locomotion 
such as actin polymerization, cell-matrix adhesion, and 
myosin contractility fail to block confined migration of 
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells [153], suggesting the 
existence of alternative mechanisms facilitating their move­
ment. The Osmotic Engine Model (OEM) predicts that 
confined cell migration is facilitated by directed water per­
meation driven by a gradient of aquaporins, ion transporters, 
and ion channels [162]. Consistent with the OEM, experi­
ments have demonstrated that in confinement, aquaporin 
5 and the sodium-hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1) localize 
at the cell front, promoting isosmotic cell swelling [162]. 
On the other hand, aquaporin 4 and the SWELL1 chloride 
channel (LRRC8A) accumulate at the cell rear mediating 
cell shrinkage [163]. Dual depletion of NHE1 and SWELL1 
markedly suppresses breast cancer cell migration, extrava­
sation, and metastasis, underscoring the pivotal role of this 
migration mechanism in breast cancer progression [163]. 
Furthermore, while in 2D/unconfined environments breast 
cancer cells maintain a mesenchymal migration phenotype 
characterized by actin-rich protrusions and adhesion to the 
substrate [7], in confinement, cells switch to an amoeboid/
bleb-based migration mode [152, 164, 165]. Amoeboid 
cells exhibit weak adhesions, show high dependence on 
actomyosin contractility, and utilize spherical bulges known 
as membrane blebs for efficient migration, invasion, and 
extravasation [166–168]. Amoeboid-based migration of 
breast cancer cells has been found to correlate with lymph 
node metastasis [169].
Tumor cell migration speed scales with pore size in 3D 
hydrogels. However, in the absence of matrix degradation, 
pore sizes smaller than 7 µm2 impede cellular locomo­
tion because the nucleus, which is the stiffest and largest 
cell organelle, acts as a rate-limiting barrier to migration 
[170–172]. Consistent with these findings, migration stud­
ies conducted in confining microenvironments have dem­
onstrated an inverse correlation between nuclear rigidity or 
nuclear volume expansion with migration efficiency [173–
177]. The nuclear lamina, which lines the inner surface of 
the nuclear envelope, is the main determinant of nuclear 
stiffness, providing structural support to the nucleus. It is 
1 3

migratory paths that would otherwise demand more energy 
[201]. Hydraulic resistance also alters the migration phe­
notype of confined MDA-MB-231 cells [202], by inducing 
the transition from an amoeboid phenotype to a mesenchy­
mal phenotype [202]. This switch is controlled by TRPM7-
dependent Ca2+ influx and requires actin polymerization, 
myosin recruitment and the formation of focal adhesions at 
the interface between the cell and the lateral channel walls. 
This redistribution of actomyosin contractility decreases 
cortical contractility, promoting amoeboid to mesenchymal 
transition [202]. Although the magnitude of hydraulic resis­
tance experienced by migrating breast cancer cells in vivo 
is currently unknown, mathematical modeling indicates that 
depending on the interstitial fluid viscosity and matrix per­
meability, the hydraulic resistance within 3D matrices could 
potentially match or even exceed that observed in micro­
channels [50, 203]. This suggests that hydraulic resistance 
could significantly impact cell migration and decision-mak­
ing in vivo.
8  Extracellular fluid viscosity
In basic cell culture, the medium typically used matches the 
viscosity of water (~ 0.7 cP at 37 oC). However, in vivo, 
the viscosity of extracellular fluids is higher than 0.7 cP 
(Table 4). Extracellular fluid viscosity is further elevated in 
tumors as recently demonstrated in a study that employed 
new viscosity-sensitive fluorescent probes for noninvasive 
imaging of murine breast tumors [204]. Shear wave elastog­
raphy also showed that malignant breast tumors display a 
shear viscosity ~ 3 times higher than benign tumors and ~ 6 
times higher than normal breast tissue (8.22 Pa∙s, 2.83 Pa∙s, 
1.41 Pa∙s, respectively) [140]. This increase in extracellu­
lar viscosity can be attributed to the accumulation of ECM 
degradation products [205]or macromolecules (e.g., Mucins 
[206]) caused by the collapse of the lymphatic drainage 
system [17, 18]. Furthermore, clinical studies have shown 
that increased plasma viscosity correlates with poor sur­
vival in breast cancer patients [207]. Despite these findings, 
the impact of fluid viscosity on breast cancer progression 
remains largely unexplored. Recent work has shown that 
elevated viscosity increases the migration of both cancer­
ous and non-cancerous cells [161, 208, 209]. This finding 
is counterintuitive, as higher viscosity is known to suppress 
the movement of particles in fluids.
to chemotherapeutics [198] and to programmed cell death 
triggered by loss of adhesion (aka anoikis) [199] which in 
turn facilitates breast cancer metastasis [199]. Collectively, 
confinement is a pathophysiologically relevant cue that can 
influence tumor progression significantly by altering the 
modes and mechanisms of cancer cell migration, promoting 
genomic instability, and inducing gene expression changes, 
which trigger EMT and provide resistance to therapeutic 
agents.
7  Hydraulic resistance
Tumor cells migrate through confining, water imperme­
able channels by generating pressure at their leading-edge 
(PLE), which enables them to push the column of fluid ahead 
of them (Fig. 2). Assuming that cells are impermeable to 
water, PLE=P1 + < v > AR, where P1 is the upstream pres­
sure (Fig. 2), <v > is the average fluid/cell velocity (since 
the fluid moves at the same speed as the cell), A is the cross-
sectional area and R is the hydraulic resistance (i.e., the 
external load that resists cell/fluid movement) which, for 
rectangular channels, is proportional to the channel length 
L. This equation implies that if < v>, P1 and A are constant, 
it becomes easier for cells to migrate through channels with 
lower resistance, as they would need to generate less PLE. 
Indeed, when neutrophil-like cells (HL-60 cells) encounter 
channels with varying levels of hydraulic resistance, they 
preferentially select the path of least resistance. Intrigu­
ingly, when the hydraulic resistance is infinite, nearly all 
cells move towards the lower hydraulic resistance geom­
etries [200].
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, much like immune 
cells, demonstrate a preference for low resistance chan­
nels [50]. Using trifurcating Ψ-like microchannels, the 
Konstantopoulos lab studied how tumor cells respond to 
channels with different resistances. Their research revealed 
that the branch channel with the higher resistance triggers 
the TRPM7-mediated influx of Ca2+, resulting in the local 
formation of a thicker cortical actin network enriched with 
elevated levels of myosin II-A. This increase in actomyosin 
contractility guides cells towards low resistance channels 
[50]. Tumor cell migration along the path of least resistance 
is energetically favorable [201]. However, increasing cell 
compliance or reducing matrix stiffness suppresses ener­
getic costs, blinding MDA-MB-231 cells to hydraulic resis­
tance and enabling them to navigate through high-resistance

reduction in intravasation and metastatic lesion formation 
[220]. TRPM7 elicits its effects by triggering Ca2+ influx in 
response to fluid shear, thereby activating RhoA-dependent 
contractility and the calmodulin/IQGAP1/Cdc42 pathway 
[220]. This shear-sensing mechanism allows cells to reverse 
their migration direction, effectively avoiding entry into 
high-shear environments [220].
The increased shear stress in the circulatory system can 
pose a threat to circulating tumor cells (CTCs), triggering 
apoptosis or necrosis [221, 222]. Although breast cancer cell 
lines exhibit increased resilience to physiologically relevant 
shear stress compared to normal epithelial cells [223], lamin 
A/C knockdown exacerbates shear stress-mediated tumor 
cell death [223], suggesting that elevated lamin A/C levels 
could aid breast CTCs in withstanding shear forces in the 
circulation. CTCs that survive the harsh conditions induced 
by elevated shear stress acquire stem cell-like properties 
and display a mesenchymal phenotype [224, 225]. These 
shear stress-induced changes involve the activation of Jun 
N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling and the downregulation 
of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and glycogen 
synthase kinase (GSK)3β [224, 225].
The impact of shear stress on cell migration varies 
depending on the specific breast cancer cell line. Highly 
invasive triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells respond to 
15 dyn/cm² by increasing their migration velocity, whereas 
normal MCF-10 A epithelial cells and less aggressive tri­
ple-negative MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells show only 
slight or no increase in motility under the same conditions, 
respectively [226]. MDA-MB-231 cells even respond to 
lower shear stress values (1.8 dyn/cm2) by adhering more 
to the substrate and reorienting the Golgi marker GM130 
in the direction of flow [227]. Shear stress regulates breast 
cancer cell adhesion to endothelial cells. Optimal tumor cell 
adhesion is observed under low flow conditions, typically 
encountered in the venous but not arterial system [228, 229]. 
However, efficient extravasation also requires remodeling 
of the endothelium, a process that occurs at higher blood 
flow velocities and involves the engulfment of tumor cells 
by endothelial cells [229]. Thus, an optimal flow velocity 
range of 400–600 μm/s has been found to favor both tumor 
cell arrest within vascular regions and endothelial remodel­
ling, leading to extravasation and metastasis [229].
While the effects of shear forces on tumor cell behav­
ior are well-established, the impact of pressure drag on 
these cells remains largely unexplored. Computational 
fluid dynamics simulations have revealed that the pore size 
within a 3D matrix governs the relative magnitude of shear 
and pressure drag acting on a cell [230]. These simulations 
indicate that within highly confined matrices, such as those 
encountered in vivo, the force resulting from the pressure 
drop across the cell dominates over the total shear force 
Cells sense elevated viscosity through their actin cyto­
skeleton, which rapidly reorganizes into a dense network 
that polarizes and activates NHE1 [161]. In turn, NHE1 pro­
motes cell volume expansion, which increases membrane 
tension, resulting in TRPV4-mediated calcium influx and 
the activation of actomyosin contractility [161]. Moreover, 
elevated viscosity suppresses membrane ruffling, allowing 
the cell membrane to stay adjacent to the substrate, thus 
increasing integrin-substrate engagement [208]. These vis­
cosity sensing mechanisms enhance cell traction force, pro­
mote cell spreading, and allow breast cancer cells to migrate 
faster on 2D substrates and in confining microchannels 
[161, 208]. Furthermore, breast cancer cells develop YAP-
dependent viscous memory that enhances their migration in 
zebrafish, extravasation in chick embryos and lung metas­
tasis in mice [161]. These studies suggest that the elevated 
extracellular fluid viscosity within breast tumors triggers 
cancer cell invasion and metastasis. However, it remains 
unclear how this physical signal affects other hallmarks of 
cancer, including drug resistance and angiogenesis.
9  Drag forces: shear and pressure drag
Pressure gradients are highly prevalent within the human 
body, serving as the driving force behind fluid flow, includ­
ing transmural, interstitial and blood flow. Moving bodily 
fluids display significant disparities in velocities, often dif­
fering by several orders of magnitude. Techniques such as 
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and dynamic 
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have 
demonstrated that interstitial fluid generally moves at a rela­
tively slow velocity, ranging from 0.1 to 10 μm/s, depend­
ing on the species under consideration [214]. In the context 
of cancer, the pressure buildup within the tumor relative to 
the surrounding tissue leads to a notable increase in intersti­
tial flow, typically by 3–5 times [215]. Blood flow is much 
faster, reaching speeds of several mm/s in capillaries or 
cm/s in veins and arteries [216–218].
Moving fluid is known to exert drag forces on tumor 
cells in the direction of flow due to the combined effects 
of shear and pressure forces. While shear forces act tan­
gentially to the cell’s surface, pressure drag acts normal to 
it. The shear stress, representing shear force per unit area, 
is particularly elevated near the vessel wall with values 
ranging from 1 to 4 dyn/cm2 in veins, and 4–30 dyn/cm2 
in arteries [219]. As cells attempt to invade a blood vessel, 
they encounter shear forces acting on them. The diminished 
shear sensitivity of tumor cells like MDA-MB-231 cells 
or HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells allows them to enter high-
shear environments [220]. However, ectopic expression of 
TRPM7 restores their shear sensitivity, leading to a marked 
1 3

their metastatic spread [233]. In contrast, upstream migra­
tion of tumor cells is regulated by focal adhesions, which 
polarize at the upstream side of the cell [234]. Cell migra­
tion against the flow can be observed in high-density cul­
tures [234]. This behavior is consistent with results obtained 
from densely seeded suspensions of MDA-MB-231 cells 
in collagen gels, where cells tend to stay in high-pressure 
environments and do not move with the flow [235, 236]. 
These intriguing findings imply that the elevated IFP within 
the tumor may act as an anti-metastatic signal, hindering 
tumor cell escape. Furthermore, flow conditions that pro­
mote invasion of MDA-MB-231 aggregates in collagen 
gels trigger the upregulation of mesenchymal (Vimentin 
[230]. Hence, in these microenvironments, pressure drag 
accounts for the majority of the total drag experienced by 
the cell. By employing 3D hydrogels typically characterized 
by small, micron-sized pores, the Kamm and Swartz labs 
have shown that (patho)physiologically relevant flow veloc­
ities can trigger migration of MDA-MB-231 in the upstream 
(against the flow) and downstream (with the flow) direction 
[231, 232]. Downstream migration is mediated by self-
secreted ligands, specifically CCL19 and CCL21, which 
bind to the chemokine receptor CCR7 [233]. These ligands 
are distributed downstream due to convective flow, resulting 
in an autologous chemotaxis mechanism, which can direct 
tumor cells towards the draining lymphatics, facilitating

techniques used to assess the biophysical characteristics 
of the tumor microenvironment with image-based tools 
(mammography, MRI and ultrasound), and machine learn­
ing algorithms could further accelerate the development of 
advanced prognostic and diagnostic tools for breast cancer. 
Furthermore, recent advancements in microfluidics have 
led to the development of an assay that screens potential 
antimetastatic drugs and predicts the metastatic propen­
sity of isolated breast cancer cells [239]. This technique 
has the potential to complement existing diagnostic assays 
and determine whether a patient is at an increased risk of 
metastasis [239]. In conclusion, a comprehensive under­
standing of the implications of the physical traits of breast 
cancer holds significant promise for driving advancements 
in diagnosis, prognosis, treatment selection, and ultimately 
improving patient outcomes.

invasion [237].MDA-MB-231 cells also undergo pheno­
typic transitions in 3D hydrogels under the influence of 
physiologically relevant flows. While in the absence of flow, 
cells migrate using a mesenchymal phenotype, cell expo­
sure to flow promotes a faster amoeboid-based migration 
[238]. Collectively, these findings highlight the significant 
influence of pressure-driven flow fields on various aspects 
of breast cancer progression.
10  Conclusions and future directions
While the existence of physical stimuli within the breast 
tumor microenvironment and throughout the metastatic cas­
cade has been acknowledged for several decades, our under­
standing of their role in breast cancer remains incomplete. 
Recent advances in bioengineering have provided power­
ful tools to tune biophysical and topographical cues of the 
microenvironment, opening up new avenues to explore how 
these signals contribute to tumor progression. However, 
these techniques often permit the investigation of only one 
factor at a time, hindering our ability to unveil the intricate 
interplay of various physical factors in cancer. Furthermore, 
little is known about the role of physical signals in the pro­
gression of different breast cancer molecular subtypes. Tai­
loring treatments according to the distinct features of the 
breast tumor microenvironment and its interactions with dif­
ferent molecular subtypes of breast cancer may facilitate the 
development of personalized medicine approaches.
Although a plethora of tumor cell mechanosensors have 
been identified, including focal adhesions, ion channels, 
actin cytoskeleton, nuclear proteins, and transcription fac­
tors, more research is needed to uncover how breast cancer 
cells convert biophysical signals into biochemical cues to 
mediate short- and long-term mechanoresponses (Table 5). 
Gaining a deeper understanding of the crosstalk between 
different mechanosensors may inspire the development of 
new therapeutic strategies to block tumor progression. To 
date, the focus of new drug development and therapies has 
primarily revolved around targeting tumor growth, often 
overlooking metastatic spread, which accounts for the 
vast majority of breast cancer-associated deaths. Given the 
established role of confined cell migration in breast cancer 
metastasis [239], it is critical to identify interventions that 
can target and modulate cell motility.
Physical signals hold significant potential as valuable 
diagnostic and prognostic markers for breast cancer. For 
example, magnetic resonance elastography has proven effec­
tive in identifying malignant tumors by detecting alterations 
in stiffness within the breast tissue [74, 240]. Integrating
