Abstract:  
Circulating tumor DNA holds substantial promise as an early detection biomarker, particularly for 
cancers that do not have currently accepted screening methodologies, such as ovarian, pancreatic, and 
gastric cancers. Many features intrinsic to ctDNA analysis may be leveraged to enhance its use as an 
early cancer detection biomarker: including ctDNA fragment lengths, DNA copy number variations, and 
associated patient phenotypic information. Furthermore, ctDNA testing may be synergistically used with 
other multi-omic biomarkers to enhance early detection. For instance, assays may incorporate early 
detection proteins (i.e., CA-125), epigenetic markers, circulating tumor RNA, nucleosomes, exosomes, 
and associated immune markers. Many companies are currently competing to develop a marketable 
early cancer detection test that leverages ctDNA. Although some hurdles (like early stage disease assay 
accuracy, high implementation costs, confounding from clonal hematopoiesis, and lack of clinical utility 
studies) need to be addressed before integration into healthcare, ctDNA assays hold substantial 
potential as an early cancer screening test.

1.    Introduction 
  
There is a great need to develop accurate tests for the early detection of cancer as therapy is more likely 
to be successful when tumors are small, less complex, and non- metastatic.  Circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA) is emerging as one of the most promising biomarkers for early cancer detection, since tumors 
secrete ctDNA into the bloodstream before they are visible on imaging, signs of disease are detected, or 
both (Fiala, Kulasingam, & Diamandis, 2018). ctDNA is released into the bloodstream during tumor 
apoptosis or necrosis and by circulating tumor cells.  ctDNA comprises only a fraction of total cell-free 
DNA (cfDNA) as cfDNA also includes DNA sloughed off from non-tumor cells. The detection and analysis 
of ctDNA, or “liquid biopsy,” has shown excellent correlations with solid tumor molecular pathology. For 
example, ctDNA levels are higher in patients at advanced stages of breast, colorectal, pancreatic and 
gastro-esophageal cancer than in early stage patients (Cheng, Su, & Qian, 2016).  
Cell-free DNA was originally identified in blood in 1948 (Sorenson, et al., 1994) but was not used 
to detect tumor-specific mutations until the mid-1990s (Mandel, et al., 1948). A substantial portion of 
ctDNA technology was developed through work to advance noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) in 
prenatal diagnostics. Initially, NIPT sequencing was based primarily on whole chromosome aneuploidies, 
with a focus on chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y (Zhao, et al., 2015). NIPT was also developed to detect 
microdeletion and duplication syndromes (Zhao, et al., 2015). As NIPT became more widespread, it was 
noted that some women had genetic abnormalities (often copy number variations [CNVs]) in their 
plasma that did not relate to fetal abnormalities. Some of these abnormalities were determined to 
originate from undiagnosed maternal cancer (Amant, et al., 2015; Bianchi, et al., 2015), highlighting the 
rationale and clinical significance of ctDNA as an early diagnostic platform. At the same time, as the 
sequencing of plasma DNA advanced, mutation-specific testing for cancer diagnostics was also being 
developed. 
ctDNA is now a frequently utilized, clinically accepted alternative to tissue biopsies for tumor 
genotyping and guiding treatment decisions in patients with metastatic cancer (Cheng, Su, & Qian, 2016; 
Kuderer, et al., 2017; Aggarwal, et al., 2019). Although it holds significant promise as a biomarker for 
early cancer detection, the need for further research and development remains. There are two broad 
approaches for ctDNA analysis. One approach is tumor-guided analysis of plasma DNA i.e. to start with 
prior knowledge of mutations specific to each patient’s tumor. This is frequently done by first evaluating 
a biopsy or tumor specimen, choosing markers to probe (i.e., to indicate the presence of mutations), and 
evaluating those markers in the plasma (McDonald, et al., 2019). Another approach is tumor-
independent analysis and assumes no prior knowledge of mutations in the original tumor. In some 
cases, such analysis is guided by prior knowledge of common mutations routinely found in cancer 
subtypes such as mutations in the KRAS2, CDKN2A, and TP53 genes for pancreatic cancer. To develop an 
early detection test for previously undiagnosed cancer, the second method would need to be employed, 
and would require the use of a very broad panel of the most frequently mutated genes for the relevant 
malignancy. The purpose of this review is to describe the current development and utility of methods to 
identify ctDNA for the early detection of solid tumors, without a priori knowledge of a particular 
cancer’s mutational profile. 
  
  
2. Current uses of cell-free DNA in cancer diagnostics 
  
2.1 Disease diagnosis and tracking 
Unlike DNA extracted from traditional tissue biopsy, which evaluates only a small section of the tumor, 
ctDNA offers an unbiased representation of all mutations from across the patient’s entire tumor burden 
Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof
(Murtaza, et al., 2015; De Mattos-Arruda, et al., 2019). Despite the pathologic discrepancies found 
between tissue and ctDNA based mutation detection (Kuderer et al., 2017), ctDNA is frequently used to 
inform clinical decision making in late-stage disease diagnostic settings, particularly when biopsies are 
difficult to obtain or in situations where the primary location of the cancer is unknown (Cheng, Su, & 
Qian, 2016). 
ctDNA can also be used for detecting metastases, monitoring treatment efficacy, and 
determining the best therapeutic approach to minimize therapy costs and side effects (Fiala, 
Kulasingam, & Diamandis, 2018). In contrast to tissue biopsy, which is invasive and thus may not easily 
be used to monitor tumor development over time, ctDNA may be better able to monitor resistance to 
current treatment. For instance, KRAS mutations in gastrointestinal cancer patients may indicate 
resistance, and changes in the variant allele fractions of PIK3C mutations in breast cancer patients may 
indicate relapse (Heizer,  Haque, Roberts, & Speicher, 2019 ).  
  
2.2 Minimal residual disease identification 
After surgical resection, it is difficult to determine which patients have achieved remission as compared 
to those who have minimal residual disease. Studies have shown that the presence of ctDNA after 
surgery, which can be detected in plasma months earlier than recurrent tumors can be identified by 
imaging, is highly correlated with risk of relapse (Fiala, Kulasingam, & Diamandis, 2018; Diaz & Bardelli, 
2014). Furthermore, ctDNA has a half-life of about 2 hours, which is shorter than that of other cancer 
protein biomarkers, so it provides a more accurate picture of current tumor burden (Cheng, Su, & Qian, 
2016; Dawson, et al., 2013).   
In addition, ctDNA has been shown to be a reliable residual disease biomarker after neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy in non-metastatic breast cancer (McDonald, et al., 2019). Using a personalized tumor-
derived somatic mutation profile of 6 to 115 DNA variants per patient, McDonald et al., detected ctDNA 
in pre-treatment plasma samples from 32 of 32 patients (100%). After completion of neoadjuvant 
therapy, plasma concentrations of ctDNA were lower in those who achieved pathological complete 
response compared to those with residual disease (p = 0.0057, AUC = 0.83) (McDonald, et al., 2019). 
   
  
3.   Clinical areas that may uniquely benefit from early cancer detection using cell-free DNA.  
 
Novel early detection strategies targeting ctDNA may prove beneficial particularly for cancers with 
limited screening options. Cohen et al. (2018) developed an early cancer detection test termed 
“CancerSEEK” with a major goal of targeting difficult-to-screen cancers. Using a 61-amplicon panel they 
analyzed blood samples to detect common mutations in several subtypes of solid tumors including 
breast, colorectal, esophagus, liver, lung, ovary, pancreas, and stomach, for which they did not have any 
prior knowledge of tumor-specific mutations. The detection rate was further enhanced by an additional 
set of eight common protein cancer biomarkers: cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), carcinoembryonic antigen 
(CEA), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), myeloperoxidase (MPO), 
osteopontin (OPN), prolactin (PRL), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1) (Cohen, et al., 
2018). Their test showed 99% specificity with only 7 false positives out of 812 healthy controls, with 
sensitivities ranging from 33% for breast cancers to 98% for ovarian cancers. Overall, the authors 
identified cancer-specific profiles that could be used for the early detection (stage I-III) of over 82% of 
the cancers evaluated (Cohen, et al., 2018). A major finding of the study was that rates of early 
detection were 69% or better in some of the hardest to detect cancers, such as ovarian, hepatic, 
Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof
pancreatic, esophageal, and gastric cancers, which currently have no guideline-recommended screening 
options.   
High-risk populations, in particular, may benefit from early cancer detection using ctDNA. For 
instance, a patient with a known germline mutation leading to cancer predisposition (e.g., 
a BRCA1 mutation that causes breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility) may be evaluated using targeted 
ctDNA analyses to detect second hits in the gene (Slavin, et al., 2018). cfDNA evaluation can also identify 
germline mutations (similar to more standard peripheral leukocyte analyses) which may be used to 
assess an individual’s risk for specific cancers, as well as their potential pharmacogenetically-mediated 
response to early therapeutic options if needed (Slavin et al., 2018). 
  
  
4.    Optimizing cell-free DNA for early cancer detection  
 
The ability to use a single independent biomarker to predict clinical outcomes has a long history in 
clinical medicine, with many biomarkers showing significant promise but ultimately failing to 
demonstrate clinical utility (Burke,2016). In this light, the development of ctDNA as a stand-alone, 
clinically relevant biomarker for early cancer detection may prove challenging. However, there are some 
intrinsic qualities of ctDNA that may help enhance its ability to be used as an independent biomarker 
that go beyond the exploitation and evaluation of targeted tumor-specific mutations. In addition, 
evaluating patient risk profiles and integrating ctDNA assays with orthogonal multi-omic assays (major 
category examples shown below) have the potential to further enhance the utility of ctDNA as an early 
cancer detection tool (Figure 1). 
  
4.1 Intrinsic assay features 
 
DNA fragment length 
Mouliere et al. (2018) argued that current methods to enhance early cancer detection using 
ctDNA have focused on genomic alterations, ignoring differences in the fragment lengths of ctDNA. They 
noted that in NIPT, circulating fetal DNA is shorter than circulating maternal DNA, and this difference in 
the size of the DNA fragments can be exploited to increase the sensitivity of NIPT. They hypothesized 
that differences in cell-free DNA fragment lengths could similarly be incorporated to increase the 
sensitivity of ctDNA detection. Specifically, they determined that ctDNA fragments are enriched 
between 90 and 150 base pairs. After developing a way to select cfDNA fragments of specific sizes, they 
found that the detection of ctDNA improved, with the ctDNA fraction having at least a two-fold median 
enrichment in more than 95% of cases (Mouliere, et al., 2018). More recent studies have evaluated 
differences in cell-free DNA fragmentation for direct detection of ctDNA in patients with early stage 
cancers (Cristiano, et al., 2019). 
 
Copy number variation 
 
Molparia et al. (2017) argued that the detection of tumor-derived copy number variation (CNV; 
i.e., large gains or losses of DNA sequence, including sequence encoding genes) has the potential to 
greatly enhance ctDNA-based screening for multiple cancer types compared to regular ctDNA targeted 
mutation analysis. This is because ctDNA comprises only a small fraction of cfDNA (<1%) during the early 
stages of cancer, which presents a challenge for the development of a high-sensitivity test based on a 
mutational assay alone. For example, a fraction of 0.1% ctDNA in cfDNA correlates with only 1–5 copies 
Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof
of a ctDNA locus per 1 mL of blood, which is much lower than the error rate of standard next-generation 
sequencing (Molparia, Nichani, & Torkamani, 2017). Therefore, leveraging CNV analyses (both across the 
entire genome and at specific chromosomal loci) with targeted mutational testing may enhance 
detection of ctDNA.   
 
Mathematics and modeling 
 
Mathematical and computational modeling of ctDNA holds promise as a tool to advance the field 
of early cancer detection and enhance its use as a biomarker of disease progression. In recent years, 
some mathematical models have been developed that use ctDNA dynamics to make predictions of 
tumor volume (Sharon S. Hori & Gambhir, 2011; Lutz, Willmann, Cochran, Ray, & Gambhir, 2008). In 
particular, it has been reported that a higher concentration of ctDNA is associated with later stages of 
cancer in addition to greater tumor size (Abbosh et al., 2017; Bettegowda et al., 2014; Fiala & Diamandis 
2018). Sun et al. showed that metastatic cell growth patterns were consistent with increased ctDNA 
concentration in blood and used a stochastic mathematical model to predict progression free survival in 
metastatic melanoma (Sun, Bao, & Shao, 2016). Hori et al. developed a mathematical model of ctDNA 
kinetics to examine 1) the role of ctDNA shedding from both tumor and healthy cells, 2) ctDNA entry 
into the vasculature, and 3) elimination of ctDNA from plasma (Sharon S. Hori & Gambhir, 2011; Sharon 
Seiko Hori, Lutz, Paulmurugan, & Gambhir, 2017). This model allows a distinction between aggressive 
versus non-aggressive tumors using blood biomarker sampling data alone. Overall, combining liquid 
biopsy findings with mathematical models of tumor growth and ctDNA kinetics may provide novel 
opportunities to enhance early detection strategies and tumor progression predictions.  
 
Phenotypic variables 
 
            ctDNA algorithms could also incorporate demographic information to better interpret patient 
cancer risk profiles. For instance, because men are not at risk for ovarian cancer, ctDNA findings 
indicative of ovarian cancer in men may be quickly categorized as false positives or potentially due to 
another cancer. Likewise, ctDNA risk profiles indicative of embryologic tumors, such as Wilms tumors, 
would be unexpected in elderly patients. Additionally, as mentioned above, identifying germline 
mutations in cancer driver genes (e.g., germline mutations in BRCA1) may help focus ctDNA detection 
methodologies by looking for downstream second hits in the same gene or subsequent pathway errors. 
  
4.2 Enhancing ctDNA analysis using multi-omics approaches 
There are many ways in which ctDNA-based early cancer detection assays may be improved. Many of 
these strategies involve combining ctDNA detection strategies with the identification of other 
biomarkers or analytes that are thought to be associated with tumorigenesis. We hypothesize that 
leveraging the inherent specificity of somatic mutations in ctDNA together with other biomarkers that 
offer higher sensitivity may yield an effective cancer detection strategy. One possible framework may be 
to enrich for patients at high-risk of developing cancer using more permissive, higher sensitivity tests 
such as protein biomarkers. A follow-up higher specificity test such as analysis of tumor-specific 
mutations in ctDNA can then be performed in this selected population, to achieve greater effective 
diagnostic accuracy. Many emerging biomarkers have demonstrated synergistic potential with ctDNA for 
early cancer detection some of which are highlighted in the following sections 
Proteins 
Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof
As noted above, adding alternative biomarkers to increase the sensitivity and positive predictive 
value of ctDNA assays is an obvious way to develop tests that can detect multiple cancer types while 
maintaining low false positive rates. Proteins, such as those used in the CancerSEEK assay described 
above, have the longest history as potential early cancer detection biomarkers (Cohen, et al., 2018). As 
such, they were some of the first biomarkers to be incorporated into ctDNA assays (Cohen, et al., 2018).  
 
Epigenetics  
 
Genome-wide hypomethylation analysis may be a potentially cost-effective cancer biomarker. 
Specifically, Chan et al. (2013) used plasma hypomethylation (which can be detected at low sequencing 
depths and for a relatively low cost) to identify cancer that had not metastasized, achieving 74% and 
94% sensitivity and specificity, respectively. Similarly, hypermethylation at certain CpG islands may serve 
as a useful biomarker. Hypermethylation can contribute to the silencing of tumor suppressors which are 
typically unmethylated in healthy patients (Dong & Ren, 2018). For example, hypermethylation of the 
promoter region of the MLH1 gene occurs in around 15% of sporadic colorectal cancers. MLH1 is a 
tumor suppressor that, when methylated (turned off), reduces the ability of cells to perform appropriate 
DNA mismatch repair functions. The loss of effective mismatch repair can lead to genomic mutations 
and downstream carcinogenesis (Crucianelli, et al., 2014).  
 
RNA 
 
Increasing evidence has found that tumors release large amounts of RNase-resistant RNA into 
the blood, which can be used for cancer diagnosis and prognosis  (Kishikawa, et al., 2015). RNA has 
shown strong potential as an early cancer detection biomarker. Kishikawa et al. (2015) found that 
circulating RNA levels were found to be significantly higher in the plasma and serum of patients with 
cancer than in that of healthy controls (Kishikawa, et al., 2015). Some specific RNA biomarkers have 
been shown to be associated with the presence of cancer. For example, metastasis-associated lung 
adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), which is a long non-coding RNA, is upregulated in patients with 
breast cancer (Huang et al., 2016). Arun et al. (2016) also showed that tumor growth slowed, and 
metastasis was reduced when MALAT1 was knocked out by antisense oligonucleotides in mouse 
mammary carcinoma (Arun et al., 2016).  
Similarly, microRNAs (miRNAs) can be used as an early detection biomarker. miRNAs are often 
down- or up-regulated in cancerous cells compared to healthy cells. For example, oncogenic miRNAs 
like miR-21 play a role in the progression and metastasis of colon cancer: making them excellent 
biomarkers for early detection (Toiyama, et al., 2013; Hur, et al., 2015; Toiyama, et al., 2017; Nagaraju et 
al., 2016). The down-regulation of miRNA-141 was also found to be correlated with increased lymphatic 
invasion of pancreatic cancer cells (Nagaraju et al. 2016).   
 
Nucleosomes 
 
Nucleosomes, as well as post-translational modifications to nucleosomes, have the potential to 
be used to enhance ctDNA early detection assays. For example, McAnena et al. (2017), showed that 
H4K16ac levels were low or absent in most breast cancer tumors, whereas the loss of H4K20me3 was 
associated with reduced survival and increased invasiveness. This makes the two nucleosome 
components good biomarker candidates for early breast cancer detection and treatment response 
(McAnena, Brown, & Kerin, 2017).  
 
Exosomes 
Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof
 
Exosomes are microvesicles found in healthy and cancerous cell secretions. Tumor exosomes 
also appear to play a role in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and escape from immune 
surveillance (Abusamra et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006). Exosomes, unlike the whole cell, are rich in 
transcripts specific to tumors. These tumor-specific transcripts could potentially be used to aid in cancer 
detection. For example, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is routinely used to diagnose prostate cancer and 
predict responses to treatment. However, it has a low specificity leading to the need for additional 
predictive biomarkers for prostate cancer detection (Nilsson et al., 2009).  Nilsson et al., (2009) analyzed 
RNA in urine exosomes to determine if the presence of known predictive biomarkers for prostate cancer 
could be detected and found two prostate cancer-specific biomarkers: PCA-3 and TMPRSS2: ERG. In 
another example, analysis of miRNA in colorectal adenomas found that exosomal miR-21 correlated 
significantly with total adenoma number as well as adenoma size and that miR-21 indicated the 
presence of high-risk adenomas (Uratani, et al., 2016). 
 
Autoantibodies 
 
Autoantibodies target tumor-associated antigens and can be found in the sera of patients with 
cancer in the early stages of the disease (Tan, Low, Lim, & Chung, 2009). In some cases, autoantibodies 
have been found as early as five years before the onset of cancer (Fernandez Madrid, 2005). One of the 
benefits of using autoantibodies for early cancer detection is that they are more highly concentrated in 
the serum than autoantigens and are thus more easily detected. This discrepancy occurs because the 
immune system can amplify the production of autoantibodies in response to the presence of a single 
antigen (Tan, Low, Lim, & Chung, 2009).  
Autoantibody signatures have been shown to potentially be able to distinguish between 
confined and disseminated disease (Wilson et al., 2018). For instance, IgA-reactive antigens were seen 
much more frequently in early-stage plasma samples as compared to late-stage plasma samples (Wilson 
et al., 2018). 
 
 
5.    The race to develop an early cancer detection test 
 
An early cancer detection test could provide an immense, universal benefit to humankind. As such, the 
technology could be very lucrative, and many companies have raised significant venture capital hoping 
to be the first to complete early detection trials, publish results, and release a clinical test available to 
the average patient/consumer. For example, the billion-dollar biotechnology company GRAIL, Inc., 
(https://grail.com) has set out to develop a ctDNA-based multi-cancer screening test using advanced 
next generation sequencing approaches and machine learning (Aravanis, Lee, & Klausner, 2017). 
Ongoing studies are evaluating data from hundreds of thousands of patients to create a reference 
library for mutations found in the blood of cancer patients with the most common cancers  (Aravanis, 
Lee, Klausner, 2017).   
Another company, Thrive Earlier Detection Corp. (https://thrivedetect.com), developed 
CancerSEEK (see above) and received $110 million in funding in 2019 to further develop and 
commercialize the technology to detect mutations and protein biomarkers associated with colon and 
pancreatic cancers (Cohen et al., 2018). In early 2019, CancerSEEK received Breakthrough Device 
Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration, which is granted to devices that are 
more effective than others on the market for the treatment and diagnosis of life-
threatening/debilitating 
diseases

https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/how-study-and-market-your-

developing an early ctDNA detection test, such as the planned LUNAR-2 assay from Guardant Health, Inc 
(https://guardanthealth.com/solutions/) 
and 
a 
multi-omics 
assay 
by 
Freenome, 
Inc 
(https://www.freenome.com/).  
Currently, on ClinicalTrials.gov, there are over 30 active trials in various stages of recruitment 
evaluating plasma-based DNA methods for early cancer detection (see https://clinicaltrials.gov/). Some 
notable large trials include: 1) GRAIL, Inc.’s the “Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas Study,” the “STRIVE 
Study”: a prospective cohort of 100,000 women enrolled at time of their screening mammogram, the 
“SUMMIT study”: a United Kingdom-based prospective cohort study of 50,000 older adults without 
cancer at time of enrollment, and “Development of a blood test to improve the performance of breast 
cancer screening,” 2) Guardant Health, Inc.’s “Biomarkers for the stratification in lung cancer” and 
“ECLIPSE study: Evaluation of the ctDNA LUNAR Test in an Average Patient Screening Episode,” 3) 
Memorial Sloan Kettering’s “A study of blood-based biomarkers for pancreas adenocarcinoma,” and 4) 
Freenome Inc.’s “AI-EMERGE: Development and Validation of a Multi-analyte, Blood-based Colorectal 
Cancer Screening Test.”  
In the United States, any new diagnostic biomarker must move through a multitude of clinical 
phases of test development and, ultimately regulatory approval. Pepe MS, et al., 2001, proposed 
guidelines for early cancer detection biomarker development (Pepe, et al., 2001). The developmental 
phases include 1) preclinical exploratory studies, 2) clinical assay development and analytical validation, 
3) retrospective longitudinal repository studies and clinical validation, and 4) clinical utility studies, 
including both prospective screening and cancer control studies (Pepe, et al., 2001). Concomitantly, 
laboratory developed biomarker tests must also be developed following proper institutional (i.e., 
institutional review boards) and governmental ((i.e., clinical laboratory improvement act (CLIA) and the 
Food and drug administration (FDA)) regulations. Some resources regarding the clinical development 
and regulation of diagnostic biomarkers include Mazzone PJ, et al., 2017 (Mazzone, et al., 2017) and 
https://www.fda.gov/science-research/about-science-research-fda/biomarkers-fda. 
 
6. Potential hurdles  
 
Some significant barriers stand in the way of developing ctDNA-based early cancer detection tests. As 
noted above, one major barrier is that an early detection test must be able to identify multiple cancer 
types without prior knowledge of any specific cancer mutations. Considering the current expense of 
ctDNA studies, it would not be cost-effective to evaluate all coding regions of all genes associated with 
cancer. Furthermore, the depth of sequencing required to detect true “needle in the haystack” 
mutations substantially drives up sequencing costs. Although the costs of sequencing will decrease over 
time, current approaches will likely reduce the cost of ctDNA testing by focusing on specific genes, parts 
of genes, or gene mutations rather than all known cancer-associated genes. Therefore, this method is 
less likely to detect uncommon cancers with unusual cancer profiles, for which tumor-specific mutations 
may be unknown. 
A second major barrier is clonal hematopoiesis, which refers to the clonal expansion of 
abnormal blood cells in an individual (Jaiswal, et al., 2014). Clonal hematopoiesis has been shown to 
complicate ctDNA results (Hu, Y et al., 2018). For example, Hu et al. (2018) determined that in patients 
with non-small cell lung cancer the majority of JAK2 mutations, and a proportion of TP53 mutations, 
detected through cfDNA may be due to clonal hematopoiesis. Both cancer and clonal hematopoiesis 
increase with age, making it difficult to determine whether certain mutations are a result of the aging 
Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof
process or if they are due to the presence of a malignancy.  Furthermore, clonal hematopoiesis also 
increases as a result of cancer treatment and is likely to confound ctDNA results for individuals who have 
previously been treated for cancer and are being screened for a second malignancy (Jaiswal, et al., 2014; 
Weitzel, et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2018). Razavi P, et al., 2019, showed clonal hematopoiesis can be 
identified, and removed as a confounder from ctDNA detection, using matched cfDNA and white blood 
cell sequencing (Razavi, et al., 2019).  
A third hurdle is that for early detection, precancerous lesions and early-stage cancers may not 
ultimately shed enough ctDNA due to lower disease burden, making early detection a challenge.  
Therefore, limitations in circulating ctDNA concentrations may necessitate utilization of a combination 
of various analytes to achieve required sensitivity and specificity for a robust early-detection assay.  
Despite these limitations, the methods described above, including layering multi-omic 
technologies are expected to help overcome these hurdles and enhance early cancer detection.  
 
7. Conclusion 
 
ctDNA holds great promise as an early detection biomarker, particularly for diseases that do not have 
currently accepted screening options, such as ovarian, pancreatic, and gastric cancers. In conjunction 
with other non-DNA based biomarkers, ctDNA holds substantial potential to be a key component of 
early cancer detection assays. However, for ctDNA to be routinely used for early detection, more data 
are needed to establish its clinical utility. Until there is clear evidence of clinical utility, access to these 
technologies may be limited to their necessary evaluation in clinical trials.
