Myocardial pathology in pregnancy - an autopsy study
P. Zare*, P. Vaideeswar
*Seth G.S. Medical College and K.E.M. Hospital, India
Background & objectives: Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is an
idiopathic left ventricular systolic dysfunction leading to cardiac failure in
last trimester of pregnancy or in the postpartum period. Aim is to identify
the clinical presentation and pathological features of PPCM among the
maternal deaths.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective autopsy study of pathologically
diagnosed cases of PPCM in maternal deaths in tertiary centre from 2012 to
2020. Analysed detailswere demographics, duration andtype of symptoms,
clinical diagnosis and investigations. The hearts were dissected by the
inflow-outflow method. Samples were taken from right and left ventricular
myocardia and examined by routine and/or special staining techniques.
Results: Among the 425 autopsies performed, 25 patients (5.8%) were
diagnosed as PPCM on clinico-pathological basis. The mean age was
26.9 years. Among these, 5 (20%) patients were clinically diagnosed as
PPCM or dilated cardiomyopathy, where an echocardiology showed an
ejection fraction <45%, presented with dyspnoea and had associated
pregnancy-related disorders like eclampsia and acute fatty liver. In the
remaining 20 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made on the assessment
of cardiac pathological features. The patients had varied clinical presen-
tation associated with preeclampsia, puerperal sepsis and postpartum
haemorrhage. Histologically, 12 hearts (48%) had myocarditis, while 13
(52%) had histological features of dilated cardiomyopathy. Among the
latter, 7 hearts had mural thrombi.
Conclusion: Recent research has suggested the important initiating and
driving factor for PPCM is the shift in angiogenic balance and develop-
ment of anti-angiogenic environment. Even with the substantial advance-
ment in understanding the pathogenesis of this relatively uncommon con-
dition, this enigmatic entity significantly causes morbidity and mortality
so cautious diagnosis is of paramount importance. This study is an at-
tempt to highlight the pathological features of PPCM cases to aid further
understanding of this condition.

*ISGlobal, Spain
Background & objectives: Complete autopsy is frequently not feasible in
COVID-19. Minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) may be an
alternative. We aimed to compare the MITS performance versus the com-
plete autopsy in COVID-19 deaths and evaluate the safety of the procedure.
Methods: We conducted MITS to 12 adults who tested positive pre-
mortem for COVID-19. MITS was performed in a standard well-
ventilated autopsy room, and the personnel used only reinforced protec-
tive equipment. In nine cases, a complete autopsy was performed after the
MITS. A thorough histological evaluation was conducted, and the pres-
ence of COVID-19 was evaluated by PCR in a range of samples.
Results: The diagnoses of the MITS matched almost perfectly those of
the complete autopsy in COVID-19-associated deaths. In nine patients,
COVID-19 was in the chain of events leading to death, being responsible
for diffuse alveolar damage and mononuclear T-cell inflammatory re-
sponse in the lungs. No specific COVID-19 features were identified by
MITS nor complete autopsy in any organ. Three deaths were not related
to COVID-19. All the personnel involved in the MITS tested repeatedly
negative for COVID-19.
Conclusion: MITS is a useful tool to evaluate COVID-19-related deaths
in settings where complete autopsy is not feasible. The results of this
simplified and safer technique are comparable to those of the complete
autopsy.

Pandemics of our times: AH1N1 influenza versus COVID-19 – fea-
tures of fatal cases in Romania

M. Cioplea, L. Sticlaru, A. Cioroianu, C. Mogodici, S.A. Zurac
*Colentina University Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: During the last two decades, we faced two
severe pandemics of air-borne infections: 2009-2010 pandemic of
AH1N1 influenza (AI) and the present COVID-19 pandemic. Both dis-
eases had a high mortality, but there are significant differences of char-
acteristics between fatal cases.
Methods: We examined records from 97 consecutive fatal cases of AI
that underwent post-mortem examination in our department in 2009 and
2010 and from 125 consecutive fatal cases of COVID-19 from our hos-
pital (only 8 of them underwent autopsy). Demographic, clinical and
pathological data were compared.
Results: Significant differences (AI versus COVID-19) were found be-
tween sex ratio (M:F of 1.7:1 versus 1.1:1), age (medium age of 42.01
versus 69.91). Pregnancy and post-partum period was a risk factor only
for AI (9 out 36 women versus none in COVID-19 group). Obesity was
frequent in both groups: (20.6% versus 21.6 considering that Romania
has an obesity incidence of 9.4%). Some comorbidities were found in
both groups (AI versus COVID-19): diabetes (10.3% versus 39.2%),
malignancies (6.2 versus 22.4), and cardiovascular diseases (20.6% ver-
sus 63.2%). Histologic findings showed differences regarding thrombo-
sis: only 6 out 97 cases of AI and all 7 cases of COVID-19, while DAD
was more extensive in AI.
Conclusion: AI fatal cases were younger, healthier persons with very few
severe comorbidities. While pregnancy and post-partum period is a risk
factor for death in AI, obesity was equally affecting both groups.
Knowing these characteristics, we can better tailor prophylaxis and

Multiple organ pathology in SARS-COV-2: reports of 232 autopsy
cases
E. Kogan*, Y. Berezovskij, T. Demura, S. Demura
*Sechenov University, Russia
Background & objectives: Pathological anatomy of SARS Cov-2 infec-
tion is still being investigated.
Methods: We report data of 232 autopsy of patients died from the
COVID-19 infection confirmed by PCR during life and/or by examining
paraffin blocks of lung tissue. Majority of patients were more than 65
years and had comorbid conditions (diabetes mellitus, obesity, ischemic
heart disease and etc). Using macro- and microscopic studies, specific
features of pathological processes in organs were identified.
Results: Lungs - diffuse alveolar damage, disseminated coagulopathy;
lymphocytic alveolitis, viral-bacterial pneumonia, interstitial fibrosis and
disregeneration changes of the lung epithelium; heart – lymphocytic
endomyocarditis and coronoratis with thrombosis, ischemic damage of
cardiomyocytes; brain – degeneration of neurons, vesculitis, edema and
encephalitis in 3 cases; kidney – collaptoid glomerulopathy and
tubulonecrosis; liver – steatohepatitis, foci of necrosis; endocrine system
– adrenalities, lymphocytic thyroiditis, insulinitis; skin and skeletal mus-
cle tissue – vasculitis. Coagulopathy associated to SARS Cov-2 was
found in all organs.
Conclusion: The obtained data reveal the mechanisms of organs damage
and individual aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis. The thanatogenesis of
the disease and the main causes of death are discussed, including acute
cardiopulmonary failure, acute renal failure, pulmonary thromboembo-
lism, shock involving multiple organ failure and sepsis.
The critical importance of autopsy is emphasized, which provides valu-
able information on the morphological substrate for this infection closely
associated with possible clinical manifestations.

*Department of Pathology, Institut Curie, Paris, France
Background & objectives: This study aimed to clinically validate the
performance of a multi-feature AI-based solution on detection of invasive
and in situ ductal carcinoma or atypical ductal hyperplasia against rigor-
ous ground truth (GT) established by multiple blinded expert pathologists
in breast biopsies.
Methods: Performance of the AI solution was prospectively tested on breast
biopsies from 2 medical institutions in different geographies. AI results were
compared against the ground truth (GT) established by consensus of two
subspecialist breast pathologists. The study endpoints were detection of inva-
sive carcinoma (IDC, ILC) and DCIS/ADH. ADH and DCIS low grade were
pooled together because of similar clinical management.
Results: Six pathologists participated in the study and reported on 417
breast biopsies (872 H&E slides), including 135 invasive, 137
DCIS/ADH, and 145 benign diagnoses. 10 (2.4%) cases had discrepan-
cies on invasive diagnosis, and 15 (3.6%) cases had discrepancies on
DCIS/ADH diagnosis between the two specialist pathologists necessitat-
ing a third assessment by a specialist to establish GT. 4 of these cases also
necessitated a committee decision since there was no majority even after 3
reviews. The AI solution demonstrated high performance when compared
with the GT with AUC as high as 0.994 for the detection of invasive
carcinoma, with specificity and sensitivity up to 95.4% and 98.4%
respectively.
Conclusion: This blinded multi-site study reports the successful clinical
validation of a multi-feature AI-based solution in detecting and automat-
ically imparting clinically relevant diagnostic parameters regarding inva-
sive and in situ breast carcinoma, offering an important tool for computer-
aided diagnosis in routine pathology practice.

Digital pathologist training program on the evaluation of PD-L1 ex-
pression by VentanaPD-L1 (SP142) in triple negative breast cancer
M. Viegas*, D.F. Schmitt, H. Pereira, S. Pinto Torres, A.S. Rebelo, D.
Matos, A. Dias
*Roche Diagnostics, Portugal
Background & objectives: Unresectable locally advanced or metastatic
triple negative breast cancer may presents expression of PD-L1≥1 in the
immune cells. Pathologist training is critical for right interpretation of PD-
L1 expression. We report the results of the training in Portugal for the
Ventana PD-L1 test (SP142).
Methods: In each training there were 10 to 12 pathologists-during 1 day-
using a novel digital training platform–Pathomation. The Sessions
consisted of 1) consensual analysis of 10 known cases 2) self study - 4
known cases followed by trainer-led group discussion 3) pre test – 8
unknown cases followed by trainer-led group discussion 4) proficiency
test – 28 cases followed by discordant case review with the trainer.
Results: Between March 7, 2019 and February 19, 2020, 6 training
sessions were held including 64 pathologists from 30 institutions nation-
wide. 100% of the pathologists met the approval criteria of the Roche
International Pathologist Training Program (score ≥85% on the
Proficiency Test). The overall percent agreement, positive percent agree-
ment and negative percent agreement at the Proficiency test was 97%,
97.5% and 96.5%, respectively.
Conclusion: The assessment of PD-L1 expression on IC is a new concept
for pathologists. This training program showed excellent pathologist’s
concordance scores, establishing the feasibility and effectiveness of such
trainings in triple negative breast cancer.

Correlation of tumour subtype with long-term outcome in small
breast carcinomas: a Swedish population-based retrospective cohort
study

Blomqvist, L. Holmberg, F. Wärnberg, M. Sund
*Department of Medical Biosciences/Pathology and Department of
Surgery and Perioperative sciences/ Surgery Umeå University, Sweden
Background & objectives: Breast cancer (BC) is increasingly detected
at stage 1, hence treatment decisions are more often influenced by tumour
biology than stage. Our study aims to explore if there is any association
between tumour subtype and outcome in these small tumours.
Methods: We classified samples from 445 women with unifocal, node
negative BC <15 mm, treated 1986-2004 into surrogate molecular sub-
types (Luminal A-like, Luminal B-like, Her2-positive, and triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC)) by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridiza-
tion. Information on treatment, overall survival, breast cancer-specific
survival (BCSS) and incidence of locoregional and distant metastasis
were gathered from medical records.
Results: Median follow-up for women alive was 19.8 years and no pa-
tient was lost to follow up. Tumour subtype was not associated with
overall survival. Luminal B-like and TNBC were associated with a two-
and threefold higher incidence of distant metastasis at 20 years, in
Virchows Arch
comparison to Luminal A-like BC, respectively. Women with TNBC and
Luminal B-like tumours had worse breast cancer specific survival but this
was not statistically significant. Her2-positive subtype had no certain
association with any outcome despite the fact that no woman received
Her2-targeted therapy.
Conclusion: TNBC or Luminal B-like tumours behave more aggressive-
ly than Luminal A-like tumours, even at stage 1. Prospective studies are
needed to clarify if this means these women benefit from adjuvant che-
motherapy. Women with Her2+/ER+-tumours do not seem to have an
increased risk of distant metastasis or death, absent targeted treatment.

Cystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis: a retrospective reassess-
ment of granulomatous mastitis patients
Z.C. Olgun*, A. Aydin, H. Baysal, B. Baysal, G. Kir
*Medeniyet University, Prof. Dr. Suleyman Yalcin City Hospital,
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Cystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis
(CNGM) is an increasingly recognised subtype of granulomatous mastitis
often associated with Corynebacterium species. CNGM usually occurs in
reproductive age women and typically characterised with pain, discharge,
mass formation, nipple retraction and sinuses at unilateral breast.
Methods: A retrospective search for breast specimens with granulomatous
inflammation from 2010 to 2020 was performed. Through this ten year
period there were 108 female patients diagnosed with granulomatous mas-
titis whose slides were available for review. Haematoxylin and eosin slides
were reviewed for typical histological features of CNGM. Slides which
were suspicious of CNGM were stained with gram for microorganisms.
Results: Thirty-five (32,4%) cases were identified as CNGM with char-
acteristic suppurative lipogranulomas that are composed of central lipid
vacuoles rimmed by neutrophils and an outer cuff of epithelioid histio-
cytes. Mean age was 34,6 (23-51 years), all patients were at a reproduc-
tive age, except one. Gram stains revealed organisms in 14 (48,2%) of 29
cases. The patients had various management approaches, including sur-
gery, steroids and antimicrobials. Nine (25.7%) patients received antibi-
otics, six (17.1%) patients received local and two (5.7%) patients received
systemic steroids, nine (25.7%) patients underwent segmental mastecto-
my. Eight (22,9%) patients had recurrent disease.
Conclusion: Although there is no consensus in the treatment of CNGM,
Prolonged antibiotic therapy with lipophilic antibiotics as Doxycycline,
Clarithromycin, Rifampicin and Co-trimaxazole are used for mostly iso-
lated Corynebacterium species. Collaborative communication between
specialists to accurately diagnose and manage these patients is essential
to decreasing potential morbidity.

breast after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
G. Kir, Z.C. Olgun*, H. Seneldir, S. Koca, I. Tosun, O. Alimoglu
*Medeniyet University, Prof. Dr. Suleyman Yalcin City Hospital,
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Mucinous breast carcinoma (MBC) accounts
for approximately 2% of all breast cancers. There is limited data in the
literature regarding the response and outcomes of MBC after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (NAC).
Methods: Eight patients with localized non-metastatic MBC who had
been treated with NAC between 2010-2019 were identified. Paraffin
blocks were available for all of the patients, as were H&E and
immunohistochemistry slides of both their core biopsies and mastectomy
or breast-conserving surgery specimens.
Results: Sevenpatients had a consistent pathologic response score at both the
primary tumour site and the axillary lymph nodes after the NAC. Four pa-
tients had no pathologic response at both the primary tumour site and the
axillary lymph nodes. Three patients had a partial pathologic response at both
the primary tumour site and the axillary lymph nodes. One patient had a
partial pathologic response at the primary tumour site but she did not have
axillary lymph node involvement. Two patients, who had no pathologic
response, had recurrent disease after 26 and 31 months of follow-up after
surgery and they both died after 65 and 66 months of follow up, respectively.
Conclusion: In our series, none of the patients achieved a complete
pathological response of the primary tumour and/or the axillary LNs.
We observed that the pathological responses of the primary tumour and
axillary LNs of the patients were correlated.

Lineage-specific methylation profiles in phyllodes tumours of the
breast and their mimics
J. Hench, T. Vlajnic, S.D. Soysal, E. Obermann, S. Frank, S. Muenst*
*Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland
Background & objectives: Phyllodes tumour (PT) poses a diagnostic
challenge, as there are no generally accepted criteria to distinguish PT
from fibroadenoma (FA) or to separate between benign, borderline, and
malignant PT. DNA methylation analysis represents an important tool to
objectively classify tumours.
Methods: We used fresh/frozen as well as formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded patient samples to determine DNA methylation patterns of 41
PT (22 initially diagnosed as benign, 8 borderline, 10 malignant, 1 not
specified) on a standard microarray. 11 FA , 6 primary breast sarcomas
and 1 metaplastic carcinoma were included as reference. Identified CNV
aberrations were confirmed with fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH).
Results: In analogy to other tumour entities, PT and FA show distinct DNA
methylation profiles reflecting a breast-specific signature as well as tumour-
derived patterns. PT/FA form a molecular subgroup distinct from normal
breast tissue and invasive breast cancer. Whereas the histologically malignant
PT are enriched for complex copy number alterations, the benign PT and FA
feature less prominent to no copy number variants and their methylation
signature shows a higher similarity to physiological breast tissue.
Conclusion: DNA methylation profiling allows distinction of two PT
categories (benign/malignant). Of note, elimination of the diagnostically
problematic category of borderline PT allows optimized prognostic pa-
tient stratification. The significant molecular overlap between benign PT
and FA prompts for omission of their diagnostic distinction. Moreover,
methylation and subsequent FISH analysis shows recurrent genomic ab-
errations limited to the neoplastic stromal cells, such as 1q gains (includ-
ing the MDM4 locus), as well as CDKN2A deletions and EGFR ampli-
fications, which may be exploited therapeutically.

Repeatable study of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes in breast cancer
after neoadjuvant therapy based on artificial intelligence
M. Zhao, Y. Liu*
*The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, China
Background & objectives: Visual quantitative assessment of tumour-
infiltrating lymphocyte(TILs) in breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy
lacks accuracy and repeatability. This study compared the difference and
repeatability of visual assessment (VA) and Artificial intelligence(AI)
assisted interpretation of TILs of breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy
under microscope.
Virchows Arch
Methods: This study included 50 patients with invasive breast cancer in
the fourth hospital of Hebei Medical University from 2014 to 2015 and
underwent surgical resection after neoadjuvant therapy. Nine pathologists
of different levels used evaluate TILs of breast cancer after neoadjuvant
therapy by VA and AI-assisted. In this study, SPSS 26.0 and GraphPad
Prism 8.0.1 were used for statistical analysis.
Results: Nine pathologists in the VA group and the AI-assisted group
found that the TILs of 50 cases of breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy.
The Friedman M test further showed that the interpretation results of the 9
pathologists in the VA group were significantly different (P<0.001), the
interpretation results of the 9 pathologists in the AI-assisted group were
no significant difference (P=0.416). There was no significant difference
only between senior pathologists in the VA group in the TILs interpreta-
tion. The ICCs of TILs interpretation for breast cancer after neoadjuvant
therapy between all pathologists in AI-assisted group and the gold stan-
dard were higher than 0.9.
Conclusion: AI significantly improves the consistency and repeatability
of the interpretation results of TILs by pathologists. It can be seen that AI-
assisted pathologists is a good way to improve the consistency and re-
peatability of the TILs interpretation results of breast cancer.

A nomogram for predicting the subgroups of ER low positive breast
cancer based on clinicopathological characteristics
S. Niu, Y. Liu*
*The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, China
Background & objectives: The purpose is to establish a nomogram to
predict the expression status of ER based on clinicopathological charac-
teristics, and to identify patients with ER low positive whose clinicopath-
ological characteristics are similar to ER-negative patients.
Methods: 450 invasive breast cancer patients who had surgical treatment
in the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University in 2012. ER-negative
groups and ER-positive groups of patients were randomly divided into
training cohort and verification cohort at a ratio of 7:3. The effectiveness
of the nomogram is evaluated by calculating the area under the ROC
curve (AUC).
Results: Tumours with obvious nuclear polymorphism, mitosis>20/10
HPF, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes>40%, and necrosis are often ER-
negative. The AUC of the nomogram in the training cohort and validation
cohort were 0.804 (95% CI 0.750-0.858) and 0.828 (95% CI 0.752-
0.903), respectively. By calculating the Yorden index, the best cut-off
value for predicting ER expression status is 0.59. The nomogram was
used to predict subgroups of patients with ER low positive breast cancer.
164 (63.08%) patients had negative predicted results, and 96 (36.92%)
patients had positive predicted results. Among patients with ER low pos-
itive, those with negative predicted results have lower expression of
ESR1 mRNA, cannot benefit from endocrine therapy and have a poor
prognosis.
Conclusion: Based on clinicopathological characteristics, we have devel-
oped and verified a nomogram that predicts the expression status of ER in
patients with invasive breast cancer. It can be used to identify patients
with ER low positive whose clinicopathological characteristics are similar
to ER-negative patients and will help guide individualized and precise
treatment of ER low positive breast cancer patients.

Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), CCC Erlangen-
EMN, Germany
Background & objectives: In breast cancer (BC), therapy decision de-
pends on prognostic and predictive biomarkers including surrogate
subtyping by immunohistochemistry (IHC)& grading. In intermediate
risk hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 negative BC, decision for
adjuvant chemotherapy can be supported by multigene expression tests.
Methods: 142 BCs with intermediate clinico-pathological risk were in-
vestigated using Prosigna® testing in a prospective multicenter study.
Prosigna® molecular subtyping was compared with local and two central
(C1 and C6) surrogate subtypes [each IHC (HR, HER2, Ki-67) subtyping
and von Minckwitz (IHC+grading) subtyping] utilizing inter-rater reli-
ability (IRR) analysis. Moreover, impact of Prosigna® test results on
treatment decision on chemotherapy was studied.
Results: For 119 cases, Prosigna® and surrogate subtyping were avail-
able. According to local IHC, 35.4% were Luminal A-like, 64.6%
Luminal B-like (local von Minckwitz subtype: 31.9% Luminal A-like/
68.1% Luminal B-like). In contrast to local and C1, C6 surrogate
subtyping assigned >66.7% of cases to Luminal A-like. Best agreement
occurred between Prosigna® (53.8% Luminal A/44.5% Luminal B) and
C1 von Minckwitz subtyping (Cohen’s kappa= 0.455). Chemotherapy
and endocrine therapy were recommended to 44.2% and 88.6% of
Prosigna® Luminal A and Luminal B cases, respectively. For local
Luminal A-like cases, chemotherapy and endocrine therapy were recom-
mended if Prosigna® testing classified them as Luminal A with
high/intermediate risk or upgraded to Luminal B subtype.
Conclusion: IRR between Prosigna® subtypes and surrogate subtyping
was fair to moderate depending on surrogate subtyping method and cen-
ter. Cases of high Prosigna® risk group were mostly of Prosigna®
Luminal B subtype. For Luminal A-like subtypes of breast cancer
assessed locally using IHC/von Minckwitz subtyping, adjuvant chemo-
therapy and endocrine therapy were recommended if multigene expres-
sion analysis using Prosigna® assay classified those cases as Prosigna®
Luminal A at high/intermediate risk or upgraded to Prosigna® Luminal B
breast cancer.

Prognostic factors of luminal A and luminal B intrinsic breast cancer
subtypes of Croatian patients: a 5-year experience from Osijek
R. Gudelj*, J. Rajc, M. Bakula, R. Alaghehbandan
*Department of Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Osijek University
Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, University of Osijek, Croatia
Background & objectives: Prognosis and treatment of breast cancers are
associated with clinico-pathologic and biological characteristics of the
tumour. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and prognostic
parameters of luminal breast cancers among Croatian breast cancer
population.
Methods: A large retrospective cross-sectional study including 1248
cases of primary breast cancer treated at Osijek University Hospital was
conducted during 2016–2020. The clinico-pathologic and immunohisto-
chemical (IHC) and dual in situ hybridization (DISH) data were extracted
from pathology reports to study the luminal subtypes A and B. The cross-
tabulated statistics of the observed characteristics were performed be-
tween the two subtypes.
Results: Luminal cancers comprised 89% (1006/1130) of the total num-
ber of cases. Of 1006 cases of luminal cancers, 717 cases (71.3%) were
luminal B, while 289 (28.7%) were luminal A. Age profile of Luminal A
and B cancers were similar (62.8 vs 62.7 years). Luminal B cancers were
associated with higher grade (22.9% grade III in luminal B compared to
6.6% in luminal A), micropapillary and metaplastic histology, and high
Virchows Arch
frequency of nodal metastasis (39.8% in luminal B compared to 23.3% in
luminal A).
Conclusion: Luminal B is the most frequent subtype of breast cancer in
Croatian patients. They were associated with adverse clinico-histologic
parameters such as higher grade and nodal metastasis. Our findings sug-
gest that, despite lack of molecular studies in routine practice, IHC/ISH-
based typing are sufficient for prognostic and therapeutic stratifications in
breast cancers in Croatia.

*Pathology Department, Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Centro
Hospitalar e Universitário Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Up to 30% of women with breast cancer
develop brain metastases (BCBM), and the overall prognosis remains poor.
Different markers are on trial for guiding treatment and provide prognos-
tic information.
Methods: A retrospective transversal study was completed using archival
biological material from 114 patients with BCBM, diagnosed between
2000 and 2016 at the Coimbra University Hospital. Expression of CD44,
CD133, ALDH1, PD-L1, Her-2, ER, PR, CA9 marks were assessed by
immunohistochemistry. Clinical and pathological data was retrieved from
the hospital database. The local ethical committee (CHUC-136-20) ap-
proved this study.
Results: One hundred and one (89%) metastases were located in the brain
parenchyma and 13 (11%) in the bone. The most common site was the
cerebellum (34.7%). The median age of presentation was 56 years (32-80
years). After a median follow-up of 10 months (0-225months) the overall
survival (OS) was of 10±1.3months. The overexpression of CD44 was
associated with a worse OS (7±2.2vs 12±1.8months, p = 0.047), on uni-
variate analysis; however multivariate analysis did not confirm this find-
ing (HR 1,543, 95%CI 0.99-2.4, p=0.055). The remaining markers did
not exhibit statistical correlation.
Conclusion: BCBM have a very poor outcome. Cancer stem cell
markers, such as CD44, may have prognostic impact on survival in pa-
tients BCBM. The conjugation with other markers may help in patients’
stratification and therapy.

*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Instituto Português de Oncologia de
Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Lisboa, Portugal
Background & objectives: Tumour-associated macrophages (TAM)
may have a significant role in carcinogenesis and could be a potential
therapeutic target in breast carcinoma (BC). We evaluated the clinico-
pathological features and correlated them with TAM M1(pro-inflamma-
tory) and M2(immunosuppressive) in molecular subgroups of BC.
Methods: We evaluated 60 untreated BCs; 20 Triple-negative (TN), 20
HER2-enriched (HER2+) and 20 Luminal (ER+). Medical records and
histological slides were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry for CD68, pan-
macrophage; CD163, CD206, M2 and CD80, M1, was performed.
Expression was determined by counting the absolute number of intra-
tumoral macrophages in ten high-power-field “hot-spots”. Fisher’s exact
test was used for groups comparison.
Results: Patients´ median age was 62,7 years. The median follow-up was
75,65 months (9-250). TN tumours presented with higher stages than ER+
tumours (p=0.026), were frequently bilateral (30%) and BRCA1/2 mutated
(30%). TN carcinomas were larger than ER+/HER2+ carcinomas
(p=0.008; p=0.041) and more necrotic than ER+ carcinomas (p<0.001).
Ki67 was not significantly different among TN/HER2+ tumours but it
was higher than ER+ tumours (p<0.001). The number of CD68/CD163
positive cases was higher in TN than ER+ tumours (p=0.008). No statistical
difference was found between TN and HER2+ groups. CD80 and CD206
TAM were rare and neither relevant nor different among the 3 groups.
Conclusion: CD163 is more frequent in TN tumours, confirming the
relationship between M2 macrophages and tumour aggressiveness in
BC. CD163 allows a better estimation of M2 macrophages than
CD206. CD80 was not useful in the evaluation of BC TAM.

*Pathology Department, Bellvitge Universitary Hospital, IDIBELL,
Spain
Background & objectives: On core needle biopsies (CNB), B3 diagnos-
tic category involves a spectrum of lesions with uncertain malignant
potential. We aim to describe B3 lesions, diagnosed on CNB between
2002- 2018, and the final diagnosis on vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB)
and/or tumourectomy (TM).
Methods: We collected information on CNB, VAB and TM of patients
diagnosed with: in-situ lobular carcinoma/atypical lobular hyperplasia
(LCIS/ALH), radial scar (RS), papillary lesion with/without atypia
(PAP), flat epithelial atypia (FEA), atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH),
and fibroepithelial lesion with stromal hypercellularity (FELSH). We
contrasted diagnoses of CNB and excision, comparing the percentage
of intraductal (IDC) and invasive carcinoma (INVC) by B3 groups.
Results: We identified 410 patients (mean age 48,4 years) diagnosed with
LCIS/ALH: 30(7,3%); RS: 63(15,4%); PAP: 66(16,1%); FEA:
60(14,6%); ADH: 74(18,1%), and FELSH: 117(28,5%). 382 (85,9%)
showed pure B3 lesions, and 58 (14,1%) combined. Among the 305
(74,4%) patients with excision data: 53 (12,9%) underwent to VAB-only,
238 (58,1%) TT, and 14 (3,1%) VAB+TT. None of the patients treated by
VAB-only showed carcinoma. On excision (VAB/TT), diagnoses includ-
ed: 57 (18,7%) benign lesions (B2), 184 (60,3%) B3 lesions, and 64
(20,9%) carcinoma: 30 (9,8%) INVC, and 34 (11,2%) IDC. Patients with
LCIS/ALH showed the highest percentage of INVC (24%) at excision,
and those with ADH showed the highest percentage of IDC (33,3%).
Conclusion: In our series, the most frequent B3 diagnoses on CNB were
fibroepithelial lesions, and atypical ductal hyperplasia. Most of the le-
sions identified were pure. Overall, the percentage of upgrade, including
invasive and intraductal carcinoma, among our patients with B3 diagnosis
was 20,9%, being higher among those with LCIS/ALH and ADH.

*University of Birmingham, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: There is little information on the impact of
COVID-19 on breast pathologists. This survey assesses the effect of the
COVID-19 pandemic on UK and Ireland-based breast pathologists in
order to optimise working environments and ensure preparedness for
potential future pandemics.
Methods: A 35-question survey on working practices during the COVID
19 first wave including redeployment, professional development, train-
ing, health and safety & wellbeing was distributed to consultant breast
Virchows Arch
pathologists on the National Coordinating Committee for Breast
Pathology and the Association of Breast Pathology databases, and re-
sponses collected anonymously.
Results: There were 135 responses from breast pathologists based in the
UK and Ireland. Most participants (75.6%) stated that their workload had
decreased, and their productivity dropped. 86/135 were given the option
of working from home and 36% of those who did reported improved
efficiency. Multidisciplinary team meetings (MDTMs) largely moved to
virtual platforms (77.8%) with fewer members present (41.5%). Online
education including webinars and courses were popular and utilised by
92.6%. 16.3% of pathologists reported shortages of masks, visors or
gowns as the commonest health and safety concern. 33.3% felt that
COVID had a significant negative impact on their physical and mental
health. 10.4% were redeployed/retrained.
Conclusion: Going forward, most respondents were keen to adopt flex-
ible working hours, virtual MDTMs, remote working and digital pathol-
ogy. 57% felt their pathology departments were not adequately prepared
for a potential surge in activities due to patient treatment backlogs.
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted on UK breast patholo-
gists and their practice. It is important to apply flexible working patterns
and environments that improve productivity and mental health. The
changes suggested should be considered for long-term shaping of breast
pathology services.

Leptomeningeal metastasis of breast carcinoma
E. Dvindenko*, D. Gracez, D. Pereira, S. André
*Instituto Português de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Portugal
Background & objectives: Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) is an
uncommon complication of breast carcinoma (BC) associated with poor
outcome. We evaluated the clinicopathological features of BC associated
with LMC and correlated them with patient survival.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients with LMC
from BC diagnosed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 2000 to 2019 with
available histology of primary BC. Clinical data (age, genetic
susceptibility, neoadjuvant therapy, metastasis, and follow-up) was
accessed from clinical records. CSF slides were reviewed as well as slides
from primary BC and other distant metastasis.
Results: Thirty-one female patients with mean age at diagnosis of 51 years
(29-81) were included. BRCA1/2 mutations were confirmed in 25% of the
patients. Twelve patients had neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Besides LMC,
fifteen patients had M1 disease, mostly lung (33.3%). Mean interval be-
tween BC diagnosis and LMC (MID) was 56 months (4-161). The median
overall survival after LMC (OSLMC) was 3 months (0–13); six months
OSLMC was 19.3%. Most tumours were invasive carcinoma of no special
type (87.1%), 55.5% grade 3. The proportion of Luminal, HER2+ and TN
was 74.2%, 12.9% and 16.1%, the respective MID was 60.8, 31.8 and 34.4
months and the OSLMC was 3.6, 1 and 1.2 months.
Conclusion: The percentage of patients with confirmed BRCA1/2 muta-
tions is high in this series. As described in literature, prognosis of patients
with LMC is poor, as less than 20% of the patients were alive 6 months
after positive CSF. Luminal subtype represented the majority of cases,
had the longest interval between BC diagnosis and LMC and the longest
survival after positive CSF.

In situ-like morphology in invasive ductal carcinoma: association
with HER2 gene aberrations and neuroendocrine differentiation
M. Bugdayci Uner*, S. Yıldırım, K. Kösemehmetoğlu
*Department of Pathology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Invasive ductal carcinoma, NOS may exhibit
a unique ductal carcinoma in-situ-like morphology characterized by lack
of myoepithelial layer. Herein we described clinicopathological and im-
munohistochemical features, as well as hormonal and HER2 status of
these tumours.
Methods: Slides of tissue microarrays constructed using 3-mm cores of
26 tumours of 15 female patients were immune-stained for SMA,
synaptophysin, and c-erbB2 and subjected to dual HER-2 Gene amplifi-
cation FISH Probe Kit (Health Care). All slides were scored by two
pathologists and also scanned and reviewed via Olympus VS120 auto-
mated slide scanner.
Results: The mean age was 51,1(25-76). Mean tumour size was 3,2(0,1-
14) cm. Fifteen tumours were grade 3; 9 were grade 2; 2 were grade 1.
Seven (58%) cases showed synaptophysin expression, one of which dif-
fuse and strong, while 6 cases had focal synaptophysin expression. All
but 3 cases(2 c-erbB2+ and 1 triple-negative) were ER/PR+. Two
cases(%29) revealed HER2 overexpression (Her2/Cep 17 ratio >4, group
5), while 5 cases fell into group 4 (Her2/Cep 17 ratio <2, HER2>4 and
<6), and the rest were non-amplified (group 5). Nine(64%) tumours, 4 of
which expressed synaptophysin, showed polyploidy in a range of 3 to 6
CEP17 copy numbers. Seven(47%) cases showed lymph node metastasis.
Conclusion: Given the fact that neuroendocrine marker expression in
breast carcinoma is around 10-30%, synaptophysin expression seems to
be slightly overrepresented in this group of tumours. Besides, tumours
with HER2 polyploidy revealed higher neuroendocrine differentiation
(44%) than the euploid ones. There are some overlapping morphological
and immunophenotypical features with invasive solid papillary carcino-
ma. In our study group with this particular morphological appearance,
synaptophysin expression and chromosome 17 polyploidy seem to be a
unique-promising finding for further research.

*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Malignant breast papillary neoplasm is a rare
type of invasive breast carcinoma. It is characterized by predominant
papillary architecture.
The aim of our study was to discuss the clinicopathological features of
malignant breast papillary neoplasms.
Methods: In a retrospective study, we report 27 cases of malignant breast
papillary neoplasm between 2001 and 2020 obtained from files of
Pathology Department of Farhat Hached University Hospital (Sousse,
Tunisia).
Results: The patients mean age was 57.35 years. The mean size of tu-
mours was 3.89 cm (ranged between 2.2 and 14 cm). There were 15 cases
of invasive papillary carcinoma, 8 cases of encapsulated papillary carci-
noma (including 3 with adjacent invasive carcinoma of no special type), 3
cases of solid papillary carcinoma and one papilloma with ductal carci-
noma in situ.
Immunostaining with myoepithelial markers, including Ck5/6 and
p63 demonstrated the absence of myoepithelial cells both in the
papillary fronds and at the periphery of the lesion in encapsulated
papillary carcinoma.
Hormonal receptors were positive in 7 cases of invasive papillary carci-
noma and 6 cases of encapsulated papillary carcinoma.
Conclusion: The diagnostic of papillary malignant tumours is chal-
lenging due to their broad spectrum of clinical, imaging, and histo-
logic characteristics. Their prognosis is better than the invasive car-
cinoma of no specific type, but their evaluation remains a problem-
atic. Although many of them can be categorized based on H&E-
stained sections alone, others require immunostaining. Further stud-
ies are needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of these lesions and the
potential tools to stratify them.

*Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of
British Columbia, Royal Columbian Hospital, Canada
Background & objectives: Papillary lesions of the breast are a hetero-
geneous group. The histologic distinction between papillary breast le-
sions remains challenging. The aim of this study was to determine the
rate of malignancy in excised papillary lesions and associated factors in
Vancouver, Canada.
Methods: This is a retrospective study of all breast papillary lesions
diagnosed on core biopsy between 2017 and 2019 in Fraser Health in
Greater Vancouver area, with a 1.8 million population. Cases were cate-
gorized into benign, atypical, and malignant. Patient demographics, his-
topathologic, and radiologic findings were analysed.
Results: This is a preliminary analysis of 57 cases of papillary lesions,
including 29 (50.9%) benign, 26 (45.6%) atypical, and 2 (3.5%) ductal
carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Mean age was 59.3 years. The age profile of
those with benign pathology was significantly younger (53.3 years) than
those with malignant (63.5 years) (p=002). The upgrade rate in benign
lesions to atypia/malignancy was 17.2% (5/29). Atypia on core needle
biopsy was significantly associated with a final malignancy diagnosis
(p<0.001). Upgrade rate to invasive carcinoma was found in 4/28
(14.3%) lesions with atypia. Final resection diagnosis with atypia/
malignancy was significantly associated with lesions >10 mm and pa-
tients older than 55 years (p<0.01).
Conclusion: The overall risk of malignancy is significantly associated
with older age, larger lesion, and the presence of atypia on core needle
biopsy. The indications for surgical resection can be justified as age > 55
years and mass size > 10 mm, even in benign lesions in core biopsy. We
suggest that close observation without surgery is sufficient for younger
women with a small papilloma without atypia.

Vitamin D deficiency and its correlation with morphological changes
in peripheral arteries in the patients with a critical limb ischemia
S. Temirov, B. Magrupov*, B. Tursunov
*Center for the development of professional skills of medical staff,
Republican Research Center of Emergency Medicine, Uzbekistan
Background & objectives: Assessment of the vitamin D deficiency and
morphological changes of arterial wall may help to clarify the reasons of
aggressive course of the peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with
diabetes mellitus (DM).
Methods: A morphological analysis performed in 44 arteries of 17 am-
putated lower limbs in patients with DM. Evaluated in 30 patients with
CLI levels of Vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphorus, and
cholesterol in the blood. Patients divided into two groups: patients with
CLI and DM (19) and patients with CLI by pure atherosclerotic lesion of
peripheral arteries (11).
Results: In 14 out of 17 vessels, calcification of the middle layer of the
tibial arteries was revealed. The level of vitamin D is 11.16 ng / ml, in
patients with diabetes - 8.42 ng / ml and without diabetes - 17.10 ng / ml.
In chronic renal failure, vitamin D levels were below normal. In patients
with chronic renal failure and diabetes, severe vitamin D deficiency in
85.8%, and without diabetes - 33.3%. The content of calcium, phospho-
rus, cholesterol is within normal limits. The level of parathyroid hormone
is increased in patients with diabetes - 79.17 ± 11.7, in patients without
diabetes - 62.86 ± 22.11 pg / ml.
Conclusion: Thus, this allows one to suspect a direct connection between
vitamin D deficiency and CLI, especially in patients with DM. Given the
presence of severe medicalcinosis, apparently it is necessary to reconsider
the algorithm of therapy in patients with DM with CLI, by including Vit
D for long life therapy.

COVID-19-associated pathology of heart
A. Kukleva*, E. Kogan, O. Blagova, Y. Berezovskij
*Sechenov University, Russia
Background & objectives: New coronavirus infection is accompanied
by the development of a wide range of cardiovascular lesions. We studied
the clinical and morphological features of SARS-CoV-2-associated pa-
thology of heart, determining the presence of viral RNA and proteins in
myocardial tissue.
Methods: The study was based on 55 autopsies with a confirmed coro-
navirus RNA in the myocardium (paraffin blocks). The average age of the
patients was 72.8±14.1 years. Men predominated (52,7%).
Immunohistochemical determination of the surface markers of CD3,
CD20, CD45, CD 68, perforin, TLR-4, TLR-9 and SARS-CoV-2 nucle-
ocapsid and spike-protein were presented.
Results: Lymphocytic viral myocarditis was detected in 35 cases
(63.3%), including 8 cases with lymphocytic pericarditis and 11 cases
with lymphocytic endocarditis. Coronariitis was found in 37 cases
(67%) and endotheliitis in 8 cases (14.5%). Lymphomacrophage infiltra-
tion of myocardium (more than 7 CD3+ T-lymphocytes, more than 14
CD45+ lymphocytes and more than 7 CD68+ macrophages per 1 mm2)
were found in cases with myocarditis. Virus proteins were identified in
macrophages of the inflammatory infiltrate and endothelial cells. Chronic
ischemic heart disease and hypertensive cardiomyopathy were detected in
32 cases. There were also of sludge phenomenon, coronary artery throm-
bosis and DIC syndrome in all cases.
Conclusion: Morphological and molecular findings confirm that
COVID-19-associated pathology of heart may be presented by viral myo-
carditis, endo- and pericarditis.
Funding: The research was supported by RFBR grant №20-315-90021

Post-Covid syndrome with persistence of SARS-Cov-2 in the myo-
cardium and development of chronic myoendocarditis
E. Kogan*, O. Blagova, A. Kukleva, T. Demura, N. Zharkov, V. Fomin
*Sechenov University, Russia
Background & objectives: Possibility of the development of post-
COVID-19 myoendocarditis is discussed in the literature. Purpose: to
study morphological and molecular features of myoendocarditis and its
possible mechanisms (including persistence of SARS-Cov-2 in the myo-
cardium) in the long-term period after acute COVID-19.
Methods: Five males (age 45.8±14.4) diagnosed with post covid myo-
carditis were included in the study. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was
confirmed by positive PCR in myocardial biopsy. The average time of
admission after COVID-19 was 4 months. The diagnosis of myocarditis
was confirmed by right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. The PCR for
cardiotropic viruses and PCR with immunohistochemical study for
SARS-Cov2 were used
Results: Three patients had no evidence of heart disease prior to COVID-
19; another two patients had moderate arrhythmias or heart failure in the
absence of evidence of myocarditis. The symptoms started 2-9 months
following COVID-19. SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected in 5 biopsies.
The longest period of virus persistence after COVID-19 was 9 months.
By using antibodies to spike and nucleocapsid antigenes, coronavirus was
Virchows Arch
detected in cardiomycytes, endothelium and macrophages. Lymphocytic
myocarditis was confirmed immunohistochemically; giant cell myocar-
ditis with atrial standstill was detected in one more case. Three patients
had also signs of endocarditis, one case of infective endocarditis and two
cases nonbacterial lymphocytic endocarditis with parietal thrombosis.
Conclusion: COVID-19 can lead to chronic myoedocarditis of varying
severity. Post covid myocarditis manifests itself as isolated arrhythmias or
systolic dysfunction with heart failure and characterized by prolonged
persistence of coronavirus (up to 9 months) in combination with high
immune activity. Prolonged post covid endocarditis associated with myo-
carditis, presents as non-bacterial thromboendocarditis or meets the
criteria of infective endocarditis. SARS-Cov-2 persistence and autoim-
mune mechanisms play a significant role.

Aortic dissection and sudden cardiac death in the young
M. De Gaspari*, S. Rizzo, G. Thiene, C. Basso
*Università di Padova, Italy
Background & objectives: The link between bicuspid aortic valve
(BAV) and aortic dissection (AD) was raised by early autopsy studies
leading to the concept of BAV-related aortopathy. To assess the burden of
BAV in juvenile SD and its histopathologic features.
Methods: The juvenile SCD Registry was searched for AD. Aortic di-
ameters were measured at 4 different levels. Histopathological analysis
was performed on the ascending aorta. Histopathologic changes of the
tunica media in terms of mucoid extracellular matrix accumulation
(MEMA), elastic fibre fragmentation and/or loss, and smooth muscle cell
(SMC) nuclei loss were assessed.
Results: Among 816 SCD cases, 27 had aortic rupture including 24 AD
(29.4%). Risk factors were BAV in 9 (37.5%), hypertension in 5 (21%),
isolated isthmic coarctation in 2, pregnancy in 2, Marfan syndrome in 2,
Turner Syndrome in 1, familial aortic dissection in 1 and idiopathic in 2.
BAV-AD had significantly larger aortic diameters than BAV-non AD
(P< 0.05). The proximal ascending aorta was significantly larger in
Marfan-AD than in BAV-AD (p=0.03). Among histopathological chang-
es of the tunica media, MEMA and elastic fragmentation were higher in
Marfan (0.005 and 0.004) and SMC nuclei loss was higher in BAV
(0.008). SMC apoptosis was higher in BAV than in controls (p= 0.004).
Conclusion: Juvenile SCD due to AD mostly recognizes a congenital or
genetic background, with BAV identified in 37.5% of cases. Significantly
smaller aortic diameters are observed in BAV than in Marfan syndrome
patients and SMC loss is the more distinctive histopathologic feature.

Adequacy of cytology samples for molecular alterations in lung non-
small cell carcinoma
K. Tilley*, M. Elgoweini
*NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Department of Pathology, United
Kingdom
Background & objectives: Ancillary studies are essential for therapeutic
guidance in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCC). Cytology is frequent-
ly the only material available for mutational analysis. The aim was to
evaluate the adequacy of cytological samples for mutational alteration
detection in lung NSCC.
Methods: A search was performed electronically on the departmental da-
tabase for cytology samples with a diagnosis of NSCC for 18 months from
April 2019. The data collected from cytology reports included the amount
and type of the sample, type and adequacy of tumour as well as the results
of ancillary investigations including PDL1, ROS1, ALK and EGFR.
Results: 117 cytology samples with NSCC were received during this
period. A total of 87 cases required mutational analysis. However, these
tests were not requested by the reporting pathologist in 6/87 cases (7%)
due to insufficient tumour content. 74 of the remaining 81 cases (91.4%)
were fully adequate for all requested tests. 7/81 samples (8.6%) showed
partial to complete inadequacy, with PDL1 having the highest inadequacy
rate (100%) while EGFR showed the lowest (20%). 2 out of the 3 samples
with complete inadequacy were from bronchial washings/ brushings in
which 12 and 15mls of fluid was received. While the third, was 20mls
from a lymph node by transbronchial fine needle aspiration.
Conclusion: Cytology is a minimally invasive approach for the diagnosis
and staging of non-small cell lung carcinoma. Our results demonstrate
that cytology samples can provide sufficient material for detection of
mutational alterations especially when biopsy is not available.

The prevalence and age distribution of high-risk human
papillomavirus infection from Turkish women with normal cytology
H. Seneldir*, G. Kir
*Istanbul Medeniyet University, Turkey
Background & objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the
prevalence and age distribution of high-risk human papillomavirus
(hrHPV) infection from Turkish women with normal cytology.
Methods: Our study population consisted of 6273 women with normal
cytology and adequate hrHPV molecular testing.
The cases were divided into 6 groups according to their age ranges as
under 25 years old, 25-29 years old, 30-45 years old, 45-54, 55-65 and
over 65 years old. Groups were compared with hrHPV positivity and type
16/18 positivity.
Results: HrHPV was detected in 689 (10.98 %) of 6273 cases. The
positivity of hrHPV were 26.3% in group 1 (<25 years), 16.83% in group
2 (25-29 years), 10.7% in group 3 (30-45 years), 8.46% in group 4 (45-54
years), 10.72% in group 5 (55-65 years) and 4.65% in group 6 (> 65).
There was statistically significant difference in the rates of hrHPV be-
tween group1 and the other groups (p <0.05). There was statistically
significant difference in the rates of hrHPV of group2 and the other
groups (p <0.05) . There was statistically significant difference in the
rates of type 16 between groups 1 and the other groups (p <0.05) .
Conclusion: According to meta-analysis studies, hrHPV positivity was
reported to be approximately 6.6% in women with normal cytology. This
rate ranges from 1.4% to 25.6%; more frequently in societies with low-
medium socioeconomic status. In our study, regardless of age groups, this
rate was found to be 10.98%, and it can be found in accordance with the
literature.

Background & objectives: The goal of this study was to determine the
accuracy of liquid-based Pap test and HPV genotyping for high-grade
squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) or severe and opportunity of
the reflex mRNA expression analysis by quantitative PCR among post-
menopausal women.
Methods: Histological follow-up results of 31 postmenopausal women
with Pap test CellPrep and HPV testing results with HPV QUANT-21
Quantitative Real-Time PCR Kit were analysed. All cases were tested for
the expression of the 21 genes (Ki-67, STK-15, CCNB1, CCND1, MYC,

ual media.
Results: We discovered that in histologically confirmed HSIL cases
(n=10) there was the highest prevalence (100%) of hrHPV types with
significant load of hrHPV 16 and 33. HPV-associated were 2 (100%)
squamous cell carcinomas and 1 (50%) endocervical adenocarcinomas.
At the threshold of LSIL positivity for histologically confirmed HSIL +,
considering false positive conclusions about the presence of HPV in the
case of a benign process (n = 10), the sensitivity was 88.24% for HPV
DNA testing and 87.50% for cytology. The combined evaluation of the
21- gene expression panel allows, according to the discriminant analysis,
to carry out the correct differentiation for HSIL+ from LSIL or less in
100%.

Background & objectives: Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) is a rare skin
cancer that frequently exhibits locoregional and distant recurrence, with-
out a clearly defined treatment. Few cases of pancreatic metastases from
MCC have been reported in the literature.
Methods: We present a case of a 63-year-old man with an enlarged right
inguinal lymph node. Excisional biopsy diagnosed a metastatic MCC.
Additional workup did not reveal the primary lesion and he was submit-
ted to adjuvant radiotherapy. A follow-up computed tomography(CT)
scan revealed a tissue densification in the right inguinal region and a
12x9cm mass involving the pancreatic body and tail.
Results: A positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed intense
pancreatic uptake. An endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was performed, show-
ing an 8.6x8.3cm, hypoecoic, heterogeneous, ill-circumscribed lesion with
local vascular spread. EUS-elastography revealed a predominantly hard
pattern. A EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration with cytoblock was per-
formed. Morphologically, the tumour displayed neuroendocrine architec-
ture with mostly solid formations of small to medium round cells, with a
high nuclear-cytoplasm ratio. It was mitotically highly active (>10 mitoses/
mm2) and contained abundant necrosis. Immunostains for chromogranin
and synaptophysin showed granular cytoplasmic staining and cytokeratin
20 demonstrated a dot-like perinuclear pattern, supporting the diagnosis of
metastatic MCC. The patient was evaluated for systemic therapy.
Conclusion: MCC is a rare and aggressive neuroendocrine tumour of the
skin that typically affects Caucasian patients over the age of 65 years. It
commonly appears as a red to violaceous, indurated dome-shaped nodule
or plaque on sun-exposed areas of the head and neck, with a high inci-
dence of local recurrence, regional lymph node, and distant metastases.
Metastatic spread to the pancreas is exceptional and its impact on prog-
nosis and surveillance is unknown.

Pleomorphic adenoma: What features accompany false-positive and
false-negative cases in cytological specimens?
I. Kholova*, E. Tommola, S. Tommola
*Pathology Department, Fimlab Laboratories, Tampere, Finland
Background & objectives: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a well-
established tool for preoperative diagnosis for salivary gland lesions.
Pleomorphic adenoma (PA) is the most common salivary gland tumour
comprising 45-74% of all salivary gland tumours with diagnostic accu-
racy of FNA to be 89.5-96.2%.
Methods: Specimens from parotid gland and submandibular gland with both
cytological diagnosis and histological follow-up were searched over a ten-
year-period (2009–2018) from a laboratory information system of Pathology
Department, Fimlab Laboratories, Tampere and PA cytological and histolog-
ical diagnoses were matched to determine concordant and discordant cases.
Results: Either cytological or histological PA diagnosis was given in 189
cases with 174 concordant cases and 14 discordant cases: 4 false-positive
cases and 10 false-negative cases. Cell type predominance was more
often myoepithelial in true-positive cases (65%, 13/20) and epithelial
both in false-negative cases (73%, 8/11, p=0.001) and in false-positive
cases (75%, 3/4, p=0.013). Only 10% (2/20) of true positive cases did not
show matrix in cytology whereas 64% (7/11) of false-negative cases did
not show matrix in cytology (p<0.001). Nuclear changes were rare in true
positive cases (10%, 2/20) and common in false-negative cases (73%,
8/11, p=0.002) and false positive cases (75%, 3/4, p=0.018).
Conclusion: Statistical analysis showed diagnostic accuracy of 96.6% for
FNA cytology regarding PA diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity were,
respectively, 94.6% and 98.2%. Positive predictive value and negative
predictive value were, respectively, 97.8% and 95.6%.

Cytomorphology, immunophenotype and cytogenetic profile of leu-
kemic serous effusions
K. Kaur*, T. Patel, S. Patra, P. Trivedi
*Gujarat cancer and research institute, India
Background & objectives: Serous effusions in leukaemia can be due to
infections, therapy, volume overload, lymphatic obstruction or malignan-
cy having implications on treatment and mortality. The objective of the
present study is to highlight the cytomorphology, immunophenotype and
cytogenetics in leukemic serous effusions.
Methods: Present study is retrospective and descriptive. We reviewed all
the serous effusions which were reported as suspicious or positive of
leukemic infiltration from 2016 to 2019 for cytomorphological features.
CSF and effusions involved by lymphomas were excluded. Cyto-
diagnosis was compared with primary proven diagnosis (by ancillary
techniques) and disconcordant cases were analysed.
Results: Out of total 9723 effusions, only 0.4% (n=40) showed leukemic
involvement and included 9 cases of AML, 3 of B-ALL, 13 T-ALL, 2
MPAL, 6 CML, 5CLL, one each of CMML and AML with myelodysplasia.
The most common site of involvement was the pleural cavity (n =30), follow-
ed by the peritoneal cavity (n=7) and the pericardial cavity (n =3). T –ALL
(41.9%) was the most common leukaemia involving pleural fluid followed by
AML (23.3%). CML (42.8%) was the most common leukaemia involving
the ascitic fluid followed by B-ALL (28.6%). Accurate diagnosis was given
on cytomorphology in 72.5% (29/40) cases and 15.0% (6/40) were reported
as NHL.
Conclusion: Cytology is an effective tool available to make a diagnosis
of LSE. Nuclear indentations in large atypical cells and cells with eosin-
ophilic granular cytoplasm with sparse or abundant eosinophils in the
background are an important clue in favour of leukaemia over lymphoma.

*First Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, The National and
Kapodistrian University of Athens - "Laikon" General Hospital of
Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: This is a retrospective study conducted in the
Cytopathology Department of Laiko Hospital in order to compare the
conventional cytospin method and the liquid-based urinary cytology in
diagnosing bladder cancer by using The Paris System of urinary cytology
classification.
Methods: We have searched our laboratory files in 2020 and we have
retrieved 100 cases of void urinary cytology classified according TPS and
including 35 TPS2, 25 TPS3, 20 TPS4 and 20 TPS5 cases. The number of
cases chosen from each category was arbitrarily decided in order to com-
pare the two methods in a meaningful manner.
Results: In the study material risk of malignancy (ROM) was 5.7% for
TPS2, 28% for TPS3, 55% for TPS4 and 95% for TPS5. Agreement rate
between cytospin and the original diagnosis was 86% and between
Thinprep and the original diagnosis 82%. No significant differences were
observed among the two techniques and their combination regarding
sensitivity and specificity, with a mild advantage for the cytospin method.
Intra-observer reproducibility and repeatability for the TPS was high.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that no significant differences exist
concerning sensitivity and specificity among the two techniques used,
when applying the TPS criteria. The TPS is a reliable classification
scheme for either conventional/cytospin or liquid-based cytology or even
the combination of them.

Immunocytochemical expression of Galectin 3 in the thyroid
fine-needle aspiration (FNA) specimens
S. Erdogan-Durmus*
*Basaksehir Cam and Sakura City Hospital, Department of Pathology,
Cytopathology Division, Turkey
Background & objectives: Galectin3 is a human lectin that is related to
malignant transformation in thyroid gland and its expression in thyroid
carcinomas was known. The aim of this study to examine the diagnostic
utility of Galectin3 in the thyroid FNA specimens.
Methods: Fifteen papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) and 5 benign fol-
licular nodules that diagnosed cytolomorphologically from 19 patients
were evaluated. All slides prepared by liquid based cytology (LBC)
(Surepath, BD®) and there were no cell blocks.
Immunocytochemical (ICC) analysis was performed with avidin-biotin-
peroxidase complex on second slides that prepared by LBC, using the
antibody Galectin 3 (Ventana Medical Systems®, Clon: 9C4).
Results: The mean age of patients was 44.1 ± 14.8 (Range 22-72 years).
There were 4 male 15 female patients. Fourteen (93.3%) of the 15 PTC
aspirates showed strong cytoplasmic and/or nuclear immunoreactivity for
Galectin 3. The all of benign aspirates were negative. Focal positivity was

Cytohistological correlation of salivary gland lesions
J. Dos Santos*, G. Miranda, T. Amaro, F. Magalhães, M. Honavar
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Hospital Pedro Hispano (ULSM),
Portugal
Background & objectives: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is an accurate
minimally invasive technique used in the management of salivary gland
tumours. Our aim is to study the utility of FNA in the diagnosis of salivary
glands lesions through cytohistological correlation.
Methods: A total of 124 patients (69 women and 55 men; aged 22-92
years) with salivary gland lesions underwent surgery between 2010 and
2020: 68 had previous FNA. These FNA diagnosis were categorized
according to the The Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland
Cytopathology and correlated with the surgical specimen diagnosis.
The risk of malignancy (ROM) for each category was determined.
Results: FNA results: 11 non-diagnostic (ND), 1 non-neoplastic (NN), 3
atypia of undetermined significance (AUS), 44 benign neoplasms (BN), 8
salivary gland of uncertain malignant potential (SUMP), 0 suspicious for
malignancy (SM) and 1 malignant (M). Histopathological follow-up: 55
benign tumours (32 pleomorphic adenomas, 16 Warthin tumours, 3 basal
cell adenomas, 1 canalicular adenoma, 1 papilloma, 1 myoepithelioma, 1
sialolipoma), 6 malignant tumours (2 acinic cell carcinomas, 3
mucoepidermoid carcinomas, 1 carcinoma ex adenoma pleomorphic) and
7 inflammatory conditions. Excluding the ND, AUS and SUMP, 41 out of
46 (89%) cytological diagnoses had concordant histology. ROM for each
category: ND 9.1%, NN 100%; AUS 0%; BN 6.8%, SUMP 0%, M 100%.
Conclusion: The percentage of concordant cases are within the range of
published data. ROM by categories were different from the ones recom-
mended by The Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland
Cytopathology. These results can be attributed, at least in part, to the
small sample size. Most of the salivary gland lesions can be accurately
diagnosed via FNA. In difficult cases, FNA is a useful diagnostic tool for
risk stratification of these lesions.

Secretory carcinoma of the parotid gland: a tumour with many
diagnostic clues
A. Ali*, A. Kempalingaiah, F. Al-Hashimi
*Broomfield Hospital, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Secretory carcinoma is a rare tumour mostly
affecting the parotid gland. It remains under-reported in the literature. We
present a secretory carcinoma diagnosed on a cytology to increase aware-
ness of its unique cytological features, key diagnostic, and molecular
characteristics.
Methods: An ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of a parotid lump
was obtained from a non-smoker elderly woman with past medical his-
tory of breast cancer. She presented with a history of a unilateral progres-
sively enlarging parotid lump over several months.
Results: The cytology sample showed clusters and papillary configuration of
small to medium sized uniform cells with vacuolated cytoplasm. The lesions
cells characteristically lacked zymogen granules. The cells exhibit prominent
hobnailing. The cells show pale vacuolated to eosinophilic cytoplasm.
Immunocytochemistry showed positive staining for S100 and CK7, and
patchy positivity for Mammoglobin. The cells were negative staining for
DOG-1. Molecular testing confirmed the diagnostic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.
Conclusion: Cytological diagnosis of salivary gland tumours possess
major challenge, even for head and neck specialists. Diagnosing a rare
tumour like secretory carcinoma requires a high index of suspicion and
awareness of its characteristic cytological and histological diagnostic fea-
tures. Confirming ETV6-NTRK3 fusion remains the gold standard for
diagnosis, which can be done on both cell block and tissue samples.

Parraga-Ramirez, E. Poblet
*Department of Pathology, Morales Meseguer University Hospital, Spain
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Physical examination continues to be essen-
tial in clinical diagnosis. Adequate examination is a basic prerequisite for
performing the fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology technique on pal-
pable lesions. With the goal of contributing to medical training, a simu-
lation module was designed.
Methods: Taking advantage of the FioNA® simulator for FNA, modifi-
cations to the model were made. Handmade simulated lesions were de-
signed, creating different clinical scenarios (neoplasms, cysts, and
adenopathies) and providing a variety of tactile sensations (shape/size/
consistency/demarcation/movement). It was evaluated for face and con-
tent validity by 30 specialists. Additionally, 23 third-year medical stu-
dents were assessed after receiving basic theoretical training in palpation.
Results: The external aspect (appearance, location, degree of realism, and
tactile sensation) of the modified model used to acquire palpation skills
received an average rating of 8.9/10 (σ 0,78); the item that received the
lowest valuation was the feeling when palpating (8.4/10; σ 1.9). The
educational value (use for training, variety of exercises, and preparation
for real-life procedures) was validated by all of the specialists. All but one
of the physicians rated the variety of exercises as adequate. Moreover, the
simulator was perceived as intuitive (9.2/10).
Regarding participant assessment, average student scores were 3.6/5
(range 1.2-4.6; σ 0.97); only 4 students received an unsatisfactory result
(a score less than 2.5)
Conclusion: It is possible to adapt a palpation module to the FioNA®
simulator for skills assessment.
This study showed face and content validity of this prototype for explor-
atory purposes.
Given that FNA is a routine medical procedure, formal training to acquire
palpation skills seems appropriate.

Ungarreevittaya, A. Khayat, R. Bhan, J. Rogola, R. Alaghehbandan*
*Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of
British Columbia, Royal Columbian Hospital, Canada
Background & objectives: Atypia of Undetermined Significance/
Follicular Lesion of Undetermined Significance (AUS/FLUS) is a chal-
lenging category comprised of a heterogeneous group of lesions. This
study’s objective was to evaluate the malignancy rate of the AUS/
FLUS in fine needle aspiration (FNA) of thyroid nodules.
Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study assessing malig-
nancy rate in thyroid nodules FNA performed in Fraser Health in Greater
Vancouver area, with a 1.8 million population, during a six-year period
(2014-2019). FNA results were correlated with clinical outcome in sub-
sequent years including repeat FNA, surgery, and clinical/imaging fol-
low-up. Clinical and radiologic factors were compared to identify
malignancy-related features.
Results: This is a preliminary analysis of 61 cases of AUS/FLUS. Mean
age was 60.2 years, with 50/61 (82%) being female. Repeat FNA was
performed on 21 (34.4%) nodules, and 30 (49.2%) underwent surgery. Of
21 repeat FNAs, 5 were AUS/FLUS, 7 benign, and 5 suspicious for
follicular neoplasm or malignancy. 7 of 30 patients who underwent im-
mediate surgery had papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma. The up-
grade rate to malignancy was 11.5% (7/61). There were no significant
differences in age, sex, and nodule size between benign and malignant
cases. The rate of malignancy was 14.3% (3/21) in patients underwent
surgery, while it was 10% (4/40) for patients underwent repeat FNA
(P>0.05).
Conclusion: The malignancy rate of AUS/FLUS in the study is consis-
tent with the recommended range proposed by the 2017 Bethesda System
for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology. Demographic and radiologic
findings were not significantly associated with upgrade malignancy risk.
No significant difference was found in malignancy risk between those
who underwent immediate operation following the AUS/FLUS diagnosis
versus patients with repeated FNA after the initial diagnosis.

Cutaneous metastases of internal malignancies: a single institution
experience
A. Vernemmen*, X. Li, G. Roemen, A. zur Hausen, V. Winnepenninckx,
I. Samarska
*Department of Pathology, GROW-School for Oncology and
Developmental Biology, Maastricht University Medical Center+,
The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Cutaneous metastases of internal malignan-
cies are infrequent. Therefore, the diagnosis can sometimes be challeng-
ing, especially in cases with an unknown primary cancer. This clinico-
pathological study aimed to review the cases of cutaneous metastases of
internal malignancies in our institution.
Methods: The retrospective review included all cases of skin metastases
from non-cutaneous primary neoplasms diagnosed in the Department of
Pathology at the Maastricht University Medical Center+ from 2006 to
2021. The clinicopathological data were collected, and appropriate im-
munohistochemical or molecular procedures were performed to confirm
the primary origin of the metastases.
Results: We identified 132 cases of cutaneous metastases of non-
cutaneous internal malignancies (74 female; 31 male patients; median
age of 68.5 years [range 29 to 90 years]). Among the female patients,
the most common primary tumour was breast cancer (46.2%), followed
by lung (15.0%), tumours of gynecological (7.5%) and gastrointestinal
origin (5.4%). Among the male patients, the most common primary sites
were gastrointestinal and lung origin (altogether 46% of the specimen). In
the majority of the cases, a primary tumour was known. However, in 11
cases, the cutaneous metastasis seemed to be the first presentation of the
clinically silent malignancy (8.3%), leading to the diagnosis of a primary
non-cutaneous malignancy.
Conclusion: Breast and gynecological tumours are the leading origins of
cutaneous metastases in female patients, which is in line with previously
published data. Lung and gastrointestinal cancer are among the most
common primary tumours, demonstrating skin metastases in both female
and male patients. Infrequently, cutaneous manifestation could be the first
sign of a clinically silent visceral malignancy; therefore, broad immuno-
histochemical profiling and a high level of awareness are necessary for a
precise diagnosis.

Nuclear protein in testis (NUT) expression and loss of C-terminus
yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) in a subset of hidradenomas
A. Sykaras*, C. Vourlakou, E. Gioti, N. Stavrinou, I. Nitsios, C.
Kouvidou
*Evangelismos General Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: YAP1-NUTM1 fusion transcripts were re-
cently identified in poromas, porocarcinomas, poroid hidradenomas and
poroid hidradenocarcinomas. Adnexal tumours harbouring YAP1-
NUTM1 fusions display immunohistochemical loss of YAP1 C-
terminus and expression of NUT. Our aim was to analyse YAP1 and
NUT expression in hidradenomas.
Methods: Our cohort included sixteen hidradenomas. We performed
IHC for YAP1 (using an antibody specific for C-terminus YAP1) and
Virchows Arch
NUT on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded sections. We considered as
YAP1 C-terminus negative cases with total loss of YAP1 C-terminus in
tumour cells and positive staining in internal control (stromal and endo-
thelial cells). NUT1 positive cases displayed strong and diffuse nuclear
NUT expression.
Results: Four hidradenomas (4/16) had abolished YAP1 C-terminus ex-
pression whereas the rest (12/16) displayed cytoplasmic and nuclear (to a
lesser extent) staining of comparable intensity to internal positive control.
Robust nuclear NUT expression was detected in all (4/4) YAP1-negative
hidradenomas. All cases that retained YAP1 C-terminus expression were
negative for NUT (0/12). In summary, 25% of hidradenomas had a YAP1
negative/ NUT positive immunohistochemical profile.
Conclusion: YAP1-NUTM1 fusions are implicated in the pathogenesis
of benign and malignant adnexal tumours. Immunohistochemical expres-
sion of NUT with parallel loss of YAP1 C-terminus in these tumours is a
useful diagnostic tool and represents a surrogate marker for the presence
of YAP1-NUTM1 fusion. Our findings indicate that a YAP1-NUTM1
fusion may be present in hidradenomas. Combined immunohistochemi-
cal and molecular analysis facilitates the diagnosis and may shed light to
the genetic events driving the development of hidradenomas.

Clinicopathologic features and overal survival relationship in meta-
static melanoma
S. Kestel*, P. Uyar Göçün, Ö. Erdem
*Gazi University Hospital, Pathology Department, Turkey
Background & objectives: Melanoma can metastasize both hematoge-
nous and lymphatic routes. Five-year survival for melanoma with distant
metastasis was reported as 22.5%. The present study evaluates the rela-
tionship between clinicopathologic parameters and overall survival for
metastatic melanoma patients.
Methods: In this study, 122 metastatic melanoma cases (45 F, 77 M) that
were metastatic at the time of diagnosis or consulted for molecular path-
ological analysis in the Gazi University Hospital, Pathology Department,
were included. Pigmentation, necrosis, perivascular pseudorosette,
tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), pleomorphism, cell type, cyto-
plasmic and nuclear features, mitotic count were evaluated. Survival anal-
ysis was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Results: The mean age of diagnosis at the time of metastasis was 55.95 ±
1.35 years (range 19-89). At the end of the study, 26 (21.3%) of the
patients were alive, whereas 96 (78.7%) were deceased. The diagnosis
age of greater than 60 years had shorter overall survival than the patients
with the diagnosis age of 31-60 years (p=0.013). Lung and central ner-
vous system metastasis had a worse overall survival than lymph node,
skin, and subcutaneous soft tissue. In contrast, liver, bone marrow, and
paranasal sinus metastasis had shorter overall survival than lymph node
metastasis. Perivascular pseudorosette formation was noticed in 64 met-
astatic melanoma cases and reduced overall survival time (p=0.002).
Conclusion: Ishida et al. described the perivascular pseudorosette forma-
tion of primary melanoma as a case report. Lugassy and Barnhill reported
that angiotropism is seen more frequently in metastatic melanoma than
melanoma without metastasis. This difference leads to an argument that
melanoma metastasis pathways could include other options besides
lymphovascular invasion. The reduced overall survival in metastatic mel-
anoma that formed perivascular pseudorosette might support the idea of
melanoma extravascular metastasis pathway in which melanocytes have a
perivascular arrangement and show angiotropism.

NTRK - fused spitz tumours – histopathological, immunohistochem-
ical and molecular features
H. Jawad*, K. Pilson, A. Casey, S. Ni Mhaolcatha, S. L McCarron, C.
O'Brien, S. Finn, C.C. Heffron
*Cork University Hospital, Ireland
Background & objectives: Kinase fusions have been identified in Spitz
tumours with subsequent studies aiming to characterise morphological
features which may correspond to these fusions. The aim of our study
was to examine the immunohistochemical and histopathological features
of NTRK-fused Spitz tumours.
Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis of NTRK, ALK, ROS1 and
BRAF with follow up molecular analysis was performed on 153 Spitz
tumours over 8 years. We examined the histopathological features of the
nine Spitz lesions with an NTRK fusion and compared them with those
with ALK (7 cases) or ROS1 fusions (9 cases) and those without a kinase
fusion to determine discriminating features.
Results: NTRK fusions were identified in 5.8% (9/153) of our Spitz
tumours. The majority of Spitz tumours with an NTRK fusion occured
on the extremities (77.8%). The majority of the NTRK-fused tumours
(55.6%) were compound with spindle cell morphology. Filigree-like rete
ridges were noticed in 55.6% of the lesions. 71.4% of the cases demon-
strated a lobulated nest while only 16.7 % of the cases shows rosette-like
configuration. In all the cases, immunohistochemistry for the pan NTRK
antibody showed membranous and cytoplasmic staining in all cells. In
88.9% of the cases the intensity of the staining was strong (3+). Molecular
studies confirmed 8/9 of the cases to have an NTRK fusion.
Conclusion: NTRK-fused Spitz tumours have distinctive histological
features including lobulated nests and filigree-like rete ridges. The pan
NTRK immunohistochemical antibody showed strong membranous and
cytoplasmic staining in lesional cells and thus may be a useful tool in the
arsenal in the diagnosis of Spitz tumours particularly when access to
molecular testing may be limited.

Retrospective study of 31 cases of pityriasis lichenoides from a
Portuguese dermatopathology department and review of the
literature
C. Faria*, J. Calvão, O. Tellechea, M.J. Julião, J.C. Cardoso
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário, Portugal
Background & objectives: Pityriasis lichenoides is an infrequent derma-
tosis whose clinical spectrum encompasses an acute form characterized
by haemorrhagic, crusted and/or necrotic papules that resolve with
varioliform scars, and a chronic form presenting with scaly papules.
Histopathological diagnosis can be challenging.
Methods: We describe 31 patients with histopathologically confirmed
diagnosis of pityriasis lichenoides diagnosed from 2010 to 2020. Our
series had a female predilection, representing 61% of total patients and
a broad age distribution at the time of diagnosis, between 5 and 67 years-
old. Twenty three percent of the cases were diagnosed at paediatric age.
Results: Pityriases lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) represents
19,4% (six cases), including a 5-year-old boy and a 67 year-old woman.
Histopathology revealed a dense dermal inflammatory cell infiltrate with
extension into the epidermis, showing basal vacuolar change, focal
spongiosis, apoptotic keratinocytes and focal epidermal necrosis.
Edema of the papillary dermis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis were also
common findings.
Pytiriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) accounts for 80,6% of cases, with
characteristic macules and papules with central mica-like scale.
Microscopically it showed a predominantly lymphocytic perivascular in-
filtrate without vasculitis and minimal exocytosis of lymphocytes.
Occasional extravasated erythrocytes were present.
No cases of the ulceronecrotic variant of PLEVA were reported and no
cases progressed to lymphoma.
Conclusion: The diagnosis can be difficult, because clinical correlation is
essential to confirm both forms, especially PLC, that presents more subtle
histopathological findings. Erythema multiforme and lymphomatoid
papulosis are the main differential diagnosis in PLEVA.
Our study also reveals that the majority of cases presented exacerbations
and remissions in both forms of the disease (81%) with appearance of
Virchows Arch
new lesions that were responsive to treatment, predominantly oral antibi-
otics and topical corticosteroids.

Primary and Metastatic Cutaneous Lymphomas: a 10-year study
from a tertiary center in Coimbra
C. Faria*, J. Calvão, O. Tellechea, M.J. Julião, J.C. Cardoso
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário, Portugal
Background & objectives: Primary cutaneous lymphomas represent a
diverse group of extranodal lymphomas and should be distinguished from
secondary involvement, although the histopathology might be identical in
both cases. Careful assessment of histology and clinical features are the
mainstay of diagnosis.
Methods: Retrospective study of 118 patients with histopathological di-
agnosis of primary and metastatic cutaneous lymphomas from 2010 to
2020. There was not a significant sex predilection, with 51,6% being male
patients; the youngest patient had 7 years old and the oldest one had 90
years old at the time of diagnosis.
Results: Primary cutaneous lymphomas represent 68,6%, while second-
ary involvement represents 31,4%. Mycosis fungoides is the most com-
mon diagnosis (33%), followed by primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-
cell lymphoproliferative disorders (16,9%). Primary cutaneous diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma, leg type represents 5,9%, primary cutaneous
follicle center lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma NOS account
for 3,4% each, extranodal marginal zone lymphoma 2,5%, and intravas-
cular large B-cell lymphoma, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lym-
phoma, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, and primary cuta-
neous gamma delta T-cell lymphoma represent 0,8% each.
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (11%), follicular lymphoma (7,6%),
extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (3,4%) and angioimmunoblastic
T-cell lymphoma (1,7%) were the most frequent cases with secondary
skin involvement.
Conclusion: The majority of primary cutaneous lymphomas has a good
prognosis. In our series, mortality rate was 17,3% for primary lymphomas
associated to progression of disease and late stage diagnosis and 54% for
secondary involvement.
Primary cutaneous or secondary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and
peripheral T-cell lymphoma NOS had the worse outcome. However,
more than half of mycosis fungoides had recurrent disease, seven of
each died due to other comorbidities related to immunosuppression,
such as organ transplantation and other non-lymphoproliferative
neoplasms.

Marino, R. Franco, D. Massi, Italian Melanoma Intergroup (IMI) study
group
*University Hospital of Padua, Italy
Background & objectives: Atypical Spitz tumours (AST) are
melanocytic proliferations with uncertain malignant potential.
Activating NTRK1/NTRK3 fusions act as oncogenic events in Spitz le-
sions and are targetable with kinase inhibitors. We aimed to define the
optimal approach for their detection in ASTs.
Methods: 180 FFPE AST samples were screened with pan-TRK immu-
nohistochemistry. The positive cases were further analysed with FISH
(NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 probes), two different NGS panels for
solid tumours, and specific real time RT-PCR panel to confirm the pres-
ence of NTRK fusions.
Results: Overall, 26 ASTs showed pan-TRK immunostaining. NTRK1
fusions were detected in 14 of these cases showing cytoplasmic immu-
noreaction, whereas NTRK3 was detected in the only case showing
nuclear immunoreaction. The molecular tests resulted all positive in only
2 ASTs (included the NTRK3 translocated one), whereas FISH and real
time RT-PCR were concurrently positive in another 2 cases. In 6 ASTs
NTRK1 fusions were detected only by FISH, in 3 cases by both NGS and
real time RT-PCR, and in the remaining one only by real time RT-PCR.
Conclusion: The frequency of NTRK fusions in ASTs is 8%, with a clear
prevalence of NTRK1 compared to NTRK3 alterations. Pan-TRK immu-
nohistochemistry is a good test to screen ASTs. The confirmation of
NTRK fusions may require the use of different techniques.

Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) features of inflammatory
skin disorders overlap with horizontal histopathological sections
(HHSs)
R. Caltabiano*, G. Broggi, F. Lacarrubba, A.E. Verzì, G. Micali
*University of Catania Section of Anatomic Pathology, Italy
Background & objectives: RCM shows the epidermal layers and papil-
lary dermis with a horizontal “point of view”. The aim of this study was to
compare the RCM features of skin inflammatory diseases with HHSs,
that reflected the same observation plane as RCM.
Methods: Two 5-mm punch biopsies were performed in 19 selected
patients (7 females and 12 males) affected by psoriasis (five cases), ecze-
ma (five cases), discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) (3 cases) and
molluscum contagiosum (MC) (6 cases). One biopsy was processed for
vertical histopathology for diagnostic confirmation, one underwent extra
paraffin-embedding for horizontal histopathology.
Results: A strong correlation between RCM features and HHSs was seen.
RCM in eczema cases showed at the level of stratum spinosum
hyporefractive areas with broadband intercellular spaces, with scattered
round-polygonal mildly refractive cells, reflecting the spongiotic features
and the presence of scattered lymphocytes intermingled with
keratinocytes, seen on HHSs. On both techniques, dermal psoriasiform
papillae were superficially visible, dilated and filled with tortuous vessels.
DLE RCM epidermal images showed roundish areas filled with hyper-
refractive amorphous material (follicular plugging) and partial disappear-
ance of the dermal papillae. RCM in MC cases exhibited roundish lobules
filled with bright cells, corresponding to the histopathological lobulated
squamous-cell hyperplasia, composed of large keratinocytes with
Henderson-Paterson bodies.
Conclusion: This comparative study between horizontal histopathology
and RCM imaging is useful to further validate the diagnostic use of RCM
in dermatological clinical practice. The possibility to create a panel of
morphological matches between these two techniques may also improve
the accuracy of the dermatologists in choosing the best site for biopsy
sample, or in promptly recognizing a potential relapse of disease.

Does the sampling method have any impact on the evaluation of skin
biopsies?
B. Calim Gurbuz*, B. Aytekin, T. Soylemez Akkurt
*Basaksehir Cam and Sakura City Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Skin diseases are common health problems.
They are evaluated with punch biopsies, especially in clinically challeng-
ing situations. There are different sampling methods for skin biopsies.
The aim of this study is to compare two different techniques with the
clinicopathologic findings.
Methods: 608 skin punch biopsies of 529 patients between May 2020
and March 2021 were included in the study. 339 biopsies were sampled
without cutting, while 269 biopsies were cut into two equal parts. The
site, diameter, preliminary diagnosis were collected from the clinical data.
The histopathological findings were obtained from pathology reports.
The results were statistically analysed.
Virchows Arch
Results: Of the 529 patients, 54% were female and the average age was
42,8+ 19,8 (range 0-91). The lower extremity was the most common biopsy
site (229 patients, 43%). The average biopsy diameter was 1.05 cm (range
0.1-2 cm). Perivascular dermatitis was the most common histopathologic
diagnosis (176 biopsies, 29%). The number of serial sections were signifi-
cantly lower in the group which underwent macroscopic cutting technique
(p=0.001). Clinicopathologic discordance was seen in 103 biopsies (17%).
More sections were significantly requested in case of clinicopathologic in-
compatibility (p=0.01). When compared to interphase and psoriasiform
group, more extra sections were evaluated in bullous dermatitis (p=0.01).
Conclusion: In this study, we evaluated big number of biopsies with
different sampling methods. Our findings suggested that dividing biop-
sies into two equal parts reduced the necessity of extra sections. Besides
the sampling methods, one of the reason for extra sections was clinico-
pathologic discordance. The other reason was some lesions tend to appear
in focal areas and they can show up in extra sections. If suitable condi-
tions are provided, applying the cutting method can reduce expenses and
shorten pathology report time.

MLH1/PMS2 expression could tell classical NTRKs fusion in fluo-
rescence in situ hybridization positive colorectal carcinomas
Y. Fu*, X. Pu, X. Fan
*Department of Pathology, China
Background & objectives: To gain insight into the clinicopathologic pro-
file of colorectal carcinomas harbouring oncogenic NTRK fusions based on
eastern populations as well as make the best testing algorithm for the screen.
Methods: We use pan-Trk immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) respectively to screen NTRK fusions in a large,
unselected cohort of 819 colon cancers, either IHC or FISH positive cases
were further detected by next-generation sequencing (NGS).
Results: IHC staining was observed in ten cases, FISH positive was
observed in 13 cases, total of 18 cases were under both a DNA-based
and an RNA-based NGS assay. For clinicopathologic characteristics, be-
sides MMR status (p=0.001), there is no difference between NTRK
fusion-positive and negative cases. Nevertheless, classical fusion cases
prefer to low differentiation (p=0.001) and different pattern of
growth(p˂0.001). Besides, we found all five classical NTRK fusion cases
and only one sub-classical case were harbouring MLH1/PMS2 deficien-
cy. When combining FISH and MMR status, besides one sub-classical
case, all five classical fusion were all detected, which means
MLH1/PMS2 expression could further narrow classical fusions in FISH
NTRK fusion positive cases.
Conclusion: Combine FISH and MLH1/PMS2 IHC would be a good
testing algorithm for the screen effective NTRK fusions. Finally, if pa-
tients are going to undergo TRK-based targeted therapy only RNA-based
NGS for detection of the specific fusion could tell the precise rearrange-
ment information.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positivity in gallbladder
carcinoma is associated with papillary structure and shows bidirec-
tional prognostic value
L. Chen*, Y. Hou, J. Huang
*Zhongshan Hospital, China
Background & objectives: Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is associated
with poor prognosis. HER2 is a promising therapeutic targe for GBC. The
objective of this study is to explore HER2 status in a cohort of patients
with GBC and its correlations with clinicopathological features.
Methods: High-output tissue microarrays were constructed for 306 cases
of GBCs. HER2 expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry
(IHC), and HER2 gene amplification was analysed using fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) in accordance with the up-to-date consensus for
HER2 testing in gastric cancer. Correlations between HER2 status, clin-
icopathological parameters, and survival data were analysed.
Results: Of 306 GBC cases, 223 (72.9%) were adenocarcinomas, of
which, 62 (27.8%) cases were papillary adenocarcinomas or had partial
papillary structure. HER2 positivity was observed in 16.1% (36/223) of
patients with adenocarcinomas. However, HER2 positivity was higher in
adenocarcinomas with papillary structures (41.9%, 26/62, P < 0.001).
Survival data were available for 143 radical resected primary gallbladder
adenocarcinoma cases with 24 HER2-positive tumours; the five-year sur-
vival rate was 52.9%. In stage 0-II, the HER2-positive group had a similar
prognosis to that of the HER2-negative group (P = 0.354). The HER2-
positive group had a lower mortality rate in stage III (P = 0.005), but
higher mortality in stage IV (P =0.005).
Conclusion: HER2 positivity was significantly higher in patients with
gallbladder adenocarcinoma with a papillary structure. The prognostic
value of HER2 was discordant among different clinical stage in GBC,
showing no predication in the early stages, better in stage III, but worse in
stage IV.

BRAF mutational testing practices in metastatic colorectal cancer
M. Hummel*, S. Hegewisch-Becker, J.H. Neumann, A. Vogel, K.
Jöhrens
*Institute of Pathology, Charité - Universitätsmedizin, Berlin, Germany
Background & objectives: The metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)
treatment landscape is rapidly evolving. Molecular testing is critical for
guiding treatment decisions according to current guidelines. Determining
BRAF mutation status is of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance. Many
methods exist for BRAF mutational testing.
Methods: BRAF mutation testing practices in BEACON CRC study
and BRAF ring trial (Quality Assurance in Pathology, QuIP) for
mCRC 2020 were reviewed. We evaluated the methods used for
BRAF status determination from 510 samples in BEACON CRC
study, the largest Phase III trial in BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC. We
evaluated real-world BRAF diagnostic testing practices in mCRC
across 53 sites in Germany.
Results: In the BEACON CRC study, 50.5% of BRAF tests were
performed alongside those for other gene alterations. Single gene
detection was used in 48.8% of samples; IHC employing antibod-
ies for detecting the mutated BRAF protein was used in 0.7% of
samples. Discrepancies were observed between local and central
testing, with confirmation of a locally detected BRAFV600E mu-
tation in 90.7% of samples. Most discrepancies were due to in-
sufficient neoplastic tissue in the sample. In the BRAF ring trial
for mCRC, a broad range of methods for BRAF testing were used
(NGS, PCR, IHC), with varying reliability. Molecular testing was
the most reliable method (100% of positive tests vs 67% for
IHC).
Conclusion: BRAF mutational testing is necessary in all patients with
mCRC before initiation of first-line treatment. There are a large number
of methods available for determining BRAF mutational status; however,
the reliability of the tests vary. The BRAF ring trial for mCRC demon-
strated the need for standardization of diagnostic procedures. Other tests
are preferred over IHC for testing of genetic alterations in mCRC; the
BRAF antibody IHC test may be useful for screening, however, molec-
ular testing is the gold standard.

Ex vivo sentinel lymph node mapping and one-step nucleic acid am-
plification (OSNA) for ultrastaging in gastric cancer
B. Märkl*, B. Grosser*, K. Bauer, D. Vlasenko, G. Schenkhirsch, A.
Probst, B. Kriening
*Institute of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, University Hospital
Augsburg, Germany
Background & objectives: One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA)
is an established method for molecular lymph node (LN) staging by
detecting cytokeratin 19 (CK19) mRNA. In this study, the effectiveness
of OSNA with ex vivo SLN mapping is compared with conventional
histology including immunohistochemistry.
Methods: LNs were retrieved from gastrectomy specimens in an unfixed
state and after ex vivo SLN mapping using methylene-blue. LNs were
sectioned to provide samples for histological investigation and OSNA.
After fixation, further LNs were dissected to gain sufficient LN counts.
Results: In total, 334 LNs were retrieved in fresh state from 41 patients.
SLN detection was successful in 29 out of 40 cases, with a correct LN
status prediction in 23 cases (79%). The low ex vivo SLN detection rate
resulted in an overall accuracy of only 58%. Excluding one case with
failure likely caused by processing error, OSNA showed a high effective-
ness with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rates of 85.4%, 93.5%, and
92.4%, respectively. The LN status could be predicted in all but one case,
in which the single positive LN was not eligible for OSNA testing. OSNA
evaluation led to upstaging from N0 to N+ in three cases (14%).
Conclusion: The ex vivo SLN protocol used resulted in a relatively poor
detection rate. However, the OSNA method was not compromised by this
detection rate and proved to be a safe method for LN staging in gastric
cancer. The OSNA method has the potential to surpass conventional
techniques.

Predictive value of NLR, TILs (CD4+/CD8+) and PD-L1 expression
for prognosis and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAD-CT)
in locally advanced Gastric Cancer (LAGC)
M. Martini*, I.V. Zurlo, A. Strippoli, A. Cocomazzi, G. Tortora, E. Bria,
M. Basso
*Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli, IRCCS, UCSC, Italy
Background & objectives: The combination of perioperative chemo-
therapy plus complete surgical resection is currently accounted as the
first-choice strategy in patients with LAGC. Nevertheless, the partial
response rate makes it necessary to search parameters to select patients
who would benefit most from NAD-CT.
Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis on a cohort of 65
LAGC cases, EBV negative and without MMR defect, submitted to
NAD-CT plus surgical resection. We evaluated the neutrophil-
lymphocytes ratio (NLR) in peripheral blood (before and after treatment)
and the TILs density (CD4/CD8 tissue ratio) and PD-L1 expression by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) on bioptic tissues before the treatment.
Results: Our results were correlated with the biological features, histo-
logical response (TRG) and clinical outcome (PFS and OS). We found
that NLR, TILs and PD-L1 expression showed a significant correlation
with TNM stage, lymphovascular invasion and response to NAD-CT
(TRG). Correlating the NLR, TILs and PD-L1 expression with PFS and
OS, we found that patients with lower NLR levels (<2.5 ratio), lower TILs
(<0.2 ratio) and higher PD-L1 level (CPS≥1) had a significantly better
PFS and OS than those with higher NLR, higher TILs and lower PDL1
expression (p<0.0001). Multivariate and multiple regression analyses
confirmed the predictive and prognostic role of all three parameters, es-
pecially when all three parameters are combined.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that pre-treatment NLR, TILs and
PD-L1 expression, are predictive and prognostic parameters in NAD-CT
treated LAGC suggesting a pivotal role of the systemic and tumour
microenvironment (TME) immunological profile in the response to che-
motherapy.

*Department of Human Pathology in Adult and Developmental Age
“Gaetano Barresi”, Section of Pathology, University of Messina, Italy
Background & objectives: Autophagic related proteins (ATGs) have
been analysed in differentiation and cancer progression. The aim of the
present study is to investigate a cohort of gastric carcinomas (GC) by five
ATGs antisera evaluating their possible relationship with final outcome of
patients.
Methods: 123 GCs has been studied by ATG antisera utilizing Masuda's
criteria that define positive cases those in which at least two out of five
protein expressions were documented. Sensitivity, specificity and effi-
ciency (expressed as a result in percentage of what could be ideally
expected, hence with 100% as ideal case) of each immunohistochemical
expression of autophagy-related-proteins have been evaluated.
Results: The immunohistochemical signature for autophagy (A-IHC)
was 49.59% as whole. The percentage of A-IHC ranged from 31% for
poorly cohesive carcinomas to 56% for adenocarcinomas. High values for
sensitivity, specificity and efficiency were recorded relatively to LC3A/B,
Beclin-1 and p62. In univariate analysis of GC, grade, stage, Ki67 ex-
pression, HER2 status as well as A-IHC appeared as prognostic signifi-
cant parameters with a high p-value (p < 0.001). Finally, in multivariate
analysis HER2 status, stage and A-IHC emerged as independent prog-
nostic variables. In the comparison of survival curves, GC cases immu-
noreactive for A-IHC exhibited a shorter survival with a worse outcome.
Conclusion: A-IHC could represents an additional morphological tool to
provide prognostic elements in order to identify patients affected by ag-
gressive with shorter survival and worse outcome.

Prognostic significance of the lymph node ratio in stage III colorectal
adenocarcinoma
A.F. Beirat, J.Z. Amarin, H.H. Suradi, Y.Z. Qwaider, M. Al-Hussaini*
*King Hussein Cancer Center, Jordan
Background & objectives: The lymph node ratio (LNR) may offer su-
perior prognostic stratification in colorectal adenocarcinoma compared
with the N stage. However, candidate cut-off ratios require validation.
Our aim was to study the prognostic significance of LNR at a cut-off ratio
of 0.10.
Methods: We reviewed the pathology records of all patients with stage
III colorectal adenocarcinoma who were managed at the King Hussein
Cancer Center between January 2014 and December 2019. We then stud-
ied the clinical characteristics of the patients, correlates of the lymph node
count, prognostic significance of positive lymph nodes, and value of
sampling additional lymph nodes.
Results: We included 226 patients. The number of lymph nodes sampled
was < 12 in 13 cases (5.8%) and ≥12 in 213 (94.2%). The median number
of lymph nodes sampled varied according to tumour site, neoadjuvant
therapy, and the pathologist’s level of training. According to the TNM
system, 142 cases were N1 (62.8%) and 84 were N2 (37.2%). The LNR
was < 0.10 in 98 cases (43.4%) and ≥0.10 in 128 (56.6%). Survival
distributions differed according to LNR (p = 0.022) but not N stage (p
= 0.065). In adjusted analyses, both N stage and LNR predicted overall
survival (p = 0.044 and p = 0.010, respectively).
Virchows Arch
Conclusion: The LNR is a robust predictor of overall survival in patients
with stage III colorectal adenocarcinoma. At a cut-off ratio of 0.10, the
LNR offers better prognostic stratification compared with the N stage and
is less susceptible to variation introduced by the number of lymph nodes
sampled, which is influenced by both clinical characteristics and grossing
technique.

Snaebjornsson, M.M. Laclé
*Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Utrecht,
The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is a risk
factor for lymph node metastasis in T1 colorectal cancer (CRC). When
LVI is present in the local resection, complementary surgery needs con-
sideration. We aimed to study the inter-laboratory variation in the assess-
ment of LVI.
Methods: All synoptic pathology reports of locally resected T1 CRCs
between 2015 and 2019 were retrieved from the Dutch Pathology
Registry (PALGA). Absolute proportions of LVI per laboratory were
determined and compared between the laboratories. Multivariable logistic
regression was performed to adjust for case mix. Additionally, a ques-
tionnaire about assessment methods and criteria for LVI was circulated
among 50 pathologists.
Results: In total, 5917 T1 CRCs from 35 laboratories were included. Of
these T1 CRCs, 18.3% were reported to have LVI (range 7.1% - 43.5%).
After adjustment for case mix, still 37% of laboratories (n=13) reported a
proportion of LVI outside the 95% confidence interval limits of the over-
all national proportion. In a subgroup of 3459 patients where LVI would
have been the decisive factor for additional surgery (i.e., patients without
other high-risk factors), case-mix adjusted proportions of LVI varied
between the laboratories by a factor of nine (range 4.6% – 41.7%). The
questionnaire showed considerable differences between pathologists in
definitions and methods used to assess LVI.
Conclusion: The results of this nationwide study show that substantial
inter-laboratory variation in the assessment of LVI in T1 CRC exists,
independent of case mix. This variation might be partly explained by
differences in assessment methods and criteria, suggested by the results
of our questionnaire. This underlines the importance of standardization of
the assessment of LVI, because the observed variation may lead to un-
wanted differences in treatment of patients with T1 CRC.

*Radboud University Medical centre, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: No consensus exists on different tumour
regression grading (TRG) systems for therapy effects of neoadjuvant
chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The aim is
to identify tumour regression patterns of oesophageal adenocarcinoma in
response to nCRT, and their association with survival.
Methods: Patients with a potentially curable oesophageal adenocarcino-
ma (cT1-4N0-3M0) who achieved partial response to nCRT combined
with surgery in the period 2005–2018 were included. Two representative
H&E slides of the surgical specimen were selected per case for
histomorphologic assessment of the regression pattern. Scoring of
regression patterns was performed by two observers according to a pre-
defined three-step flowchart.
Results: In total, 110 cases were included. Histopathology review
showed two major regression patterns: fragmentation (60%) and shrink-
age (40%). There was an excellent interobserver agreement using the
flowchart (κ=0.87). Compared to patients with a shrinkage pattern, pa-
tients with a fragmented regression pattern had a significantly higher
pathological stage (stage III/IV: 52% vs 16%; p<0.001), less downstaging
(48% vs 91%; p<0.001), higher residual tumour cells in the muscularis
(88% vs 32%; p<0.001) and subserosa (67% vs 16%; p<0.001), and a
higher risk of disease recurrence (RR 2.83, 95% CI 1.5-5.5). Patients with
a shrinkage pattern had a better overall survival compared to patients with
a fragmentation pattern (5-years: 80% vs 30%, p=0.002).
Conclusion: We established a reproducible classification of tumour re-
sponse that was associated with downstaging and better prediction of
patient outcome.

The prediction model for gastric cancer development based on gas-
tritis assessment and miR-21 expression
A. Shimanskaya, S. Mozgovoi*, V. Rubtsov, E. Pomorgaylo, A.
Kononov
*Omsk State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: The accuracy of gastric cancer risk evalua-
tion can be increased by joint assessment of gastritis parameters, includ-
ing corpus-predominant gastritis index (CGI), gastritis OLGA staging
and miR-21 expression with gastric cancer risk stratification.
Methods: All parameters were assessed in 62 cases of chronic gastritis
(CG) and 60 resected gastric samples (adenocarcinoma). Samples local-
ization in both group corresponded to the OLGA staging protocol. miR-
21 expression was evaluated by qRT-PCR, normalized to RNU6B.
Multiple logistic regression was used for predictive potential assessment
and nomogram construction.
Results: Predictor variables showed significant positive association
with gastric cancer: OLGA stage (OR = 8.07, CI [1.52-42.85]; p=
0.013), CGI (OR = 11.77, CI [2.59-53.6]; p= 0.001) and miR-21
expression (OR= 13.56, CI [4.6-40.04]; p 0.000002). Parameters af-
ter model accuracy estimation were as follows: -2 Log likelihood -
58,3, criterion χ2 - 110,84 (p=0.00001), ROC curve AUC - 0.97,
sensitivity 93%, specificity 90%. The constructed nomogram indi-
cates gastric cancer risk by connection the value of OLGA stage
(right axis) with the expression level of miR-21 (left axis) and tai-
lored to the CGI value. Indication and stratification of gastric cancer
risk based on the result value.
Conclusion: The predictive statistical model and the nomogram based on
previously defined parameters allows to perform stratified assessment of
gastric cancer risk with having high validity. This approach can be used in
organizing strategies for secondary prevention of gastric cancer.

A. Kononov
*Omsk State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: Amplification of HER2 is suitable not only
for gastric cancer, but for precancerous changes also. The aim of the study
was to reveal the usefulness and patterns of HER2 protein and gene
expression on the spectrum of carcinogenesis.
Virchows Arch
Methods: Gastric biopsy samples (n=111) were included in the
study: atrophic gastritis (26), uncertain/indefinite dysplasia (21);
intestinal type adenomas and non polipoid lesions with low-
grade dysplasia (18) and high-grade dysplasia (23); early invasive
adenocarcinoma (23). Serial sections of tissues were used for rou-
tine examination, HER2 immunohistochemistry and silver-
enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH) with adapted manual tissue
microarray technique.
Results: Overexpression of HER2 (2+ and 3+) with the presence of a
membrane or basolateral immunohistochemical pattern were found in 14
cases: 5 among invasive carcinoma group with SISH confirmation of all
2+/3+ positive cases, 1 in indefinite, 3 in high grade dysplasia and 2 in
low grade. The presence of non-conventional staining variants of HER2
expression were revealed in 52 cases: apical label (the apical edge of the
cell), cytoplasmic (diffuse staining of cell cytoplasm), “strip form” (focal
cytoplasmic staining of the cell, forming a strip) and nuclear staining.
There were no statistically significant differences in the expression of
HER2 between different categories of dysplasia and invasive adenocar-
cinoma (p<0,05).
Conclusion: We did not reveal the presence of classical significant HER2
overexpression during early precancerous changes. Non-conventional
HER2-staining needs more data and additional analysis for practical in-
terpretation and realisation of appropriate follow up strategy. These re-
sults defined the possibility of using this marker for differential diagnos-
tics in the situations of small volume or low informative biopsy material
according to its high specificity.

*Department of Pathology, Medical Research and Educational Center,
Lomonosov Moscow State University, Russia
Background & objectives: Gastric adenocarcinoma associated with the
Epstein-Barr virus is a separate molecular subtype of gastric cancer with a
characteristic set of genetic disorders and clinical and morphological fea-
tures. In this study we performed EBER identification in patients from the
Russian Federation.
Methods: We used samples of surgical material from 233 patients from
Russian Federation with a verified gastric cancer. EBER chromogenic
hybridization in situ (EBER-CISH) was performed in each case. The
results of EBER identification were compared with the main clinical
and morphological characteristics of gastric cancer.
Results: A total of 18 EBER-positive gastric adenocarcinomas and 215
negative cases were identified using EBER-CISH. The frequency of oc-
currence (incidence) was 7.73%. As in other described patient popula-
tions the identified EBV-associated gastric adenocarcinomas were char-
acterized by a less aggressive phenotype. EBER identification in gastric
adenocarcinomas was statistically significantly associated with the ab-
sence of distant metastases (p=0.047). Among all 18 identified cases of
EBV-associated adenocarcinomas there were no cases with distant me-
tastases and, accordingly, IV stage tumours. There were no statistically
significant differences for other TNM clinical stages. This fact can be
explained by the significant dominance of 106 cases of III stage tumours
in our sample.
Conclusion: It is known that the prevalence of EBV-associated gastric
adenocarcinoma differs depending on the population. The results obtain-
ed showed that the incidence of EBV-associated gastric adenocarcinoma
in the studied sample of cases from Russian Federation is 1.27% lower
than the world average of 9%.

Immunohistochemical markers as additional criteria for evaluation
of efficacy of GERD-related therapy
S. Mozgovoi*, I. Lapteva, I. Matoshina, M. Livzan
*Omsk State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: Pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux dis-
ease (GERD) has close association with intercellular contacts and appro-
priate level of epithelial proliferation. The aim was to determine the po-
tential of histopathological changes and IHC markers for assessment of
the effectiveness of GERD treatment.
Methods: 23 patients with GERD-related symptoms and endoscopic
signs and 15 patients as controls were included. Standard proton pump
inhibitor (control group) and in combination with chondroitin sulfate and
hyaluronic acid on a bioadhesive carrier (study group) were used.
Mucosal biopsies from distal esophagus were taken for analysis by his-
topathology and claudin-1, claudin-4 and Ki-67 expression assessment by
immunohistochemistry.
Results: GERD-specific alterations in the esophageal mucosa were con-
firmed. Regression of clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological param-
eters was noted in both groups after 4 weeks from the onset of treatment
(p < 0,05). In both groups expression levels of claudun-1 and claudin-4
were statistically higher after therapy (p < 0,05). Migration of claudin-1
expression towards the upper layers of esophageal mucosa was revealed
also. The Ki-67 level was lower after treatment, especially at the margins
of the erosions (p < 0,05). The expression levels of both claudins did not
correlate with clinical features and had a weak correlation with histopath-
ological parameters including dilated intercellular spaces.
Conclusion: The absence of significant differences between treatment
options concerning reverse development of morphological parameters
were established. Taken together, the expression of tight junction-
related component (claudins) and Ki-67 can be used as additional criteria
for evaluation of efficacy of GERD therapy.

Assessment of the density of the population of cancer-associated fi-
broblasts near the tumour budding in colorectal cancer
N. Oleynikova, I. Mikhailov*, P. Malkov, N. Danilova
*Department of Pathology, Medical Research and Educational Center,
Lomonosov Moscow State University, Russia
Background & objectives: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are cells
with mesenchymal properties located in the tumour stroma. One of
CAF`s marker is podoplanin (POD). Tumour budding (single cells are
located in the invasive edge of the tumour) is an independent prognostic
factor.
Methods: We used Double Stain IHC Kit: M&R on human tissue
(ab210058) with antibodies PCK (Dako, to identify buds) and POD
(Abcam, as CAF marker) in 43 colorectal cancer. POD expression was
evaluated by quantitative method (by color separation and half-counting
of the area in the field of view in the LAS X program) in invasive region
and around buds.
Results: The aim was assessment of the density of CAF near the buds.
POD around bud was negative in 30,4%, weak in 21,7%, moderate in
30,4% and significant (17,4%). A statistically significant relationship
(p<0.01) was found between the level of POD around the tumour budding
and its level in the invasive region. No significant differences in the
density of CAF depending on the presence of the mucinous component,
detected by the c2method(p=0.98). In most mucinous adenocarcinomas,
a significant POD reaction was observed directly around the mucinous
complexes and mucus lakes (p=0,85). We detected a relationship
(p=0,023) between presence of buds and depth of tumour invasion(T),
and on the presence of metastases(N).
Conclusion: Using the duplex stain technology, the expression of POD
around tumour budding was demonstrated for the first time, which allows
Virchows Arch
us to judge the density of CAF. It was shown that the density of the POD
expression around the tumour budding significantly corresponds to the
reaction in the invasive region, which indicates that there is no need to
evaluate it specifically around the tumour buds. For the first time, we
described a more significant reaction near mucinous complexes.

Lymph node molecular analysis of colorectal carcinoma in situ
M.T. Rodrigo Calvo*, S. Lopez-Prades, K. Saez De Gordoa, A. Diaz
Lorca, I. Archilla, E. Ortiz, P. Alonso, S. Lahoz, M. Cuatrecasas
*Hospital del Clínic, Spain
Background & objectives: Colorectal carcinoma in situ (pTis) is con-
sidered to have little or no risk of lymph node (LN) metastasis. However,
lymphatic vessels proliferate in the lamina propria through a process of
"aberrant lymphangiogenesis". We aimed at characterizing pTis LNs with
OSNA.
Methods: In this observational and retrospective study, LNs from pTis
CRC surgical specimens were freshly dissected. Part of the LN was used
for conventional histological stage with H&E (pN) and the rest used for
analysis with the OSNA (One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification) molec-
ular assay, based on RT-LAMP PCR, for amplification of CK19 mRNA.
Results: LNs from 39 CRC pTis were analysed by H&E and OSNA.
Mean age was 68.6 years-old, 59% (23) men, 41% (16) women; 56% (22)
were right-sided, 23% (9) transverse, 15% (6) left-sided, and 6% (2)
rectal. All carcinomas were low grade. All cases were pN0 by H&E.
OSNA was positive in 11 (28%) cases, with a total tumour load (TTL),
defined by the amount of CK19 mRNA copies/μL in all LN of a given
case, was between 400 and 4270 copies/μL. No patient received adjuvant
therapy. All patients are alive without disease at 1 to 5 years follow-up.
Conclusion: We demonstrate the presence of tumour cells in regional
lymph nodes in exceedingly early stages of the disease, detected only
by molecular methods. We corroborate our previous observations of the
prognostic value of the amount of tumour burden in LNs, demonstrating
that TTL values <6000 copies/μL are not associated to risk of recurrence.

Entire Lymph Node Molecular Analysis (ELNMA) of colorectal car-
cinoma. Correlation with pN staging using immunostained cytology
smears. A multicentre study
S. Lopez-Prades*, M.T. Rodrigo Calvo, K. Saez De Gordoa, Á. Romo
Navarro, I. Archilla, J. Ruiz Martín, J. Tarragona, S. Lahoz, M.
Cuatrecasas
*Hospital Clinic, Spain
Background & objectives: All lymph node (LN) molecular staging
studies using OSNA from colorectal cancer (CRC) have used half LN
obtaining 15-50% overstaging. We aimed at analysing the entire LN with
OSNA as well as providing the pN staging with cytological smears.
Methods: This ongoing multicenter and prospective ELNMA (Entire
Lymph Node Molecular Analysis) study includes non-metastatic CRC pa-
tients without neoadjuvant treatment. LNs are freshly dissected, cut in half
and cytological smears are performed. Then, the whole LN is processed
with the OSNA assay. Each slide contains smears from 6 LNs, which are
stained with cytokeratin 19 (CK19) immunocytochemistry for pN staging.
Results: We analysed 980 fresh LNs from 53 patients (mean 18 LN/
patient); 57% (30) men, with a mean age of 71.36 years. By cytology,
81% (43) cases were pN0, 15% (8) pN1a+b, and 4% (2) pN2a+b. The
concordance between OSNA and cytology was 96% (51). All OSNA
negative cases (41; 77%) were negative by cytology, and two presented
isolated tumour cells (ITC) on cytology smears, pN0(i+). OSNA positive
cases (12; 23%) had total tumour loads (TTL, amount of CK19 mRNA in
all LNs/patient) of 410 to 88.000 copies/μL, with 83% (10) concordance
with the cytology. The remaining 2 cases were pN0 by cytology, with
TTL of 410 and 5800 copies.
Conclusion: LN cytology smears stained with CK19 immunocytochem-
istry allows performing the pN stage based on the number of positive LNs
and enables to use the entire LN for the OSNA assay, with 96% concor-
dance. LN molecular analysis identifies 4% (2) of patients who were pN0
by morphological methods. Although preliminary, these results show the
utility of molecular LN staging, which could be used for stage II CRC,
where conventional H&E pN staging is less sensitive for the detection of
micrometastasis.

pT1 CRC patients at risk of recurrence are identified with lymph
node molecular analysis. A multicentre study
K. Saez De Gordoa*, M. Rodrigo-Calvo, I. Archilla, S. Lopez-Prades, A.
Diaz Lorca, J. Tarragona, I. Machado, J. Ruiz Martín, S. Lahoz, D.
Zaffalon, M. Pellisé, M. Cuatrecasas
*Pathology Department, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain
Background & objectives: A high percentage of early colorectal carci-
nomas (pT1) undergo surgery, with no clear impact on survival.
Molecular analysis of lymph nodes of pT1 surgical resections was per-
formed in order to identify cases at risk of recurrence to optimize patient’s
management.
Methods: In this multicentre retrospective study we analysed the lymph
nodes (LN) from pT1 CRC surgical specimens treated either primary by
endoscopic resection or by surgery using the OSNA (One Step Nucleic
Acid Amplification) assay, which detects mRNA from CK19. LNs were
freshly dissected, using half for the OSNA assay and the other half for
H&E analysis.
Results: Eighty-nine pT1 CRCs were included, 50 treated with endosco-
py followed by surgery and 39 treated primarily with surgery. Mean age
62.6 years, 55% male, 49% in the left colon, 37% right, and 14% rectal.
22 cases (25%) had positive LNs with OSNA, 5 of them also with H&E.
The total tumour load (amount of CK19 mRNA in all LNs of a patient)
was low, but for 3 cases with ≥6000 copies. LNs were positive with H&E
in 9% (n=8), two of them were negative by OSNA. At follow-up (5
months to 8 years), 82 patients are alive without disease, 3 died of other
causes, and 4 were lost to follow-up.
Conclusion: We detected 25% lymph node positivity with the OSNA
assay, 16% more than with H&E. The total tumour loads (TTL) were low
in all patients except in 3 cases with TTL > 6000 copies/μL, which is
associated with a higher risk of recurrence and worse survival according
to previous studies. These patients would be candidates for closer follow-
up. Molecular LN analysis from early CRC provides more information
than H&E about the real nodal status and could help in patient’s
management.

The relationship of clinicopathological features and the Ki67 prolif-
eration index with prognosis in colorectal carcinomas
T. Kebat, G. Dal*, M. Yıldırım, A. Argon
*Izmir Bozyaka Training Research Hospital, Pathology Department,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Colorectal cancers are very common. Many
histopathological and molecular features that can be used to predict the
prognosis. It was aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of the
histopathological features and the immunohistochemical Ki67 prolifera-
tion index in colorectal cancers.
Methods: A total of 196 patients who underwent resection for colorectal
adenocarcinoma in one centre from 2006 to 2012 were included in this
study. All of the cases were evaluated in terms of age, sex, localization,
tumour size, growth pattern, histological grade, LVI and PNI, surgical
margin positivity, pT, pN, stage, recurrence, metastasis, site of metastasis
and immunohistochemical Ki67 proliferation index.
Virchows Arch
Results: In statistical analysis, female gender, polypoid growth pat-
tern, medullary histological type, absence of lymphovascular and
perineural invasion, negative surgical margin, low pN grade and no
metastasis were found to be associated with long disease-free and
overall survival time. Although high Ki67 proliferation index was
associated with poor differentiation and surgical margin positivity,
it was not associated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall
survival (OS).
Conclusion: The results of our study show that the Ki67 proliferation
index is not more important in predicting DFS and OS than histological
features. Our study has a feature to shed light on the literature in terms of
being a study in which many histopathological features were evaluated in
a large series. However, it should not be forgotten that the search for new
target molecules that will predict the behaviour of tumours and prevent
the progression of the tumour continues.

Incidental primary tumours of the appendix: analysis of 4047 appen-
dectomy specimens in a 15-year retrospective study
C. Alves-Vale*, M. Brito Pereira, F. Tortosa, P. Borralho
*Pathology Department, CUF Descobertas Hospital, Lisbon, Portugal
Background & objectives: Acute inflammation is the most frequent
finding in appendectomy specimens. Nonetheless, it is well known that
tumours may be incidentally found. The main goal of this study was to
characterise the primary tumours diagnosed in appendectomies per-
formed in our institution.
Methods: A retrospective review was conducted for all appendecto-
mies received in our department between January 2006 and December
2020. Patients with clinical and radiological suspicion for neoplasm
were excluded. Reports with incidental histopathological diagnosis of
neoplasm were further analysed, and nomenclature was updated ac-
cording to the 5th edition of WHO Classification of Tumours
(Digestive System).
Results: A total of 4047 surgical specimens were retrieved.
Appendiceal tumours were found in 73 cases (overall incidence of
1,80%), including appendectomies performed for acute appendicitis
or at staging procedures for extra-appendiceal malignancies. The me-
dian age was 52 years (range 14-95), without age predilection (M/F
ratio =1,03). Neuroendocrine tumours were the most frequent entity
(n=29, comprising 39,72% of all incidental findings). Additional di-
agnoses include low-grade mucinous neoplasm (n=17), high-grade
mucinous neoplasm (n=1), adenocarcinoma (n=8, comprising 3 gob-
let cell adenocarcinomas, 3 adenocarcinomas NOS and 2 mucinous
adenocarcinomas), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=1, initial
presentation). Sessile serrated lesions (n=15, low-grade dysplasia in
4) and hyperplastic polyps (n=2) were also described.
Conclusion: Incidental primary tumours of the appendix are rare. Our
incidence correlates with that described in the literature. These neo-
plasms may be diagnosed in different clinical settings, isolated or in
combination with additional histopathological processes. Therefore,
careful macroscopic and microscopic examination should be per-
formed in all appendectomy specimens, independently of the preop-
erative diagnosis.

*CHUC, Portugal
Background & objectives: Colon cancer comprises molecular alter-
ations that guide treatment in advanced stages. Regarding
synchronous tumours, there is no consensus about testing all or
only the advanced CRC. We aim to assess mutational concor-
dance in synchronous CRC.
Methods: In the last two years, at our institution, eight patients, aged
between 44 and 79 year-old with synchronous CRC were tested for
KRAS and BRAF mutations. Clinical and pathological data was retrieved
from the hospital database. The local ethical committee (CHUC 137-20)
approved this study.
Results: Seven patients presented two synchronous tumours, in which
three had mutational concordance: one was wild-type for KRAS/BRAF,
other had the same mutation in KRAS (p.Gly12Asp) and the remaining
one was wild-type for KRAS, having both neoplasms BRAF V600E
mutation.
The group composed of four patients with mutation discrepancy only had
KRAS mutation in one tumour: two patients with pGly13Asp mutation,
one patient had p.Gly12Asp and p.Gin61Arg and the last one
p.Gly12Val.
The youngest patient presented a three synchronous tumours with muta-
tional discordancy: two had NRAS mutation and the other KRAS
mutation.
Conclusion: Synchronous colorectal neoplasias seem to exhibit a differ-
ent gene mutational signature. As the treatment approach is tailored ac-
cording to this information, as such, it is crucial to test all tumours in
synchronous cases.

Sessile serrated lesions (SSL) of the colon and their way towards
malignancy - immunohistochemical features
D. Raduta*, S. Zurac, C. Socoliuc, B. Mateescu, A. Bengus, M. Filip, R.
Ardeleanu, A. Cernat, C. Popp
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Serrated neoplasia pathway leads to approx-
imately 30% of all colorectal carcinomas.
The aim of this study was to evaluate MLH1, BRAF and p53 status by
immunohistochemistry in sessile serrated lesions and to identify molecu-
lar alterations as steps towards malignancy.
Methods: We designated a retrospective case control study, in-
cluding 11 sessile serrated lesions with dysplasia. For each patient
with dysplasia we included a non-dysplasia patient matching sex
and age.
Immunostaining of MLH1, BRAF and p53 was done on all 22 cases and
we evaluated the percent of nuclear loss of MLH1, cytoplasmic positivity
of BRAF and nuclear positivity of p53.
Results: Fourteen patients had microsatellite instability with surprisingly
higher nuclear loss of MLH1 in non-dysplastic crypts (65%), comparative
to the rate found in those dysplastic (55%).
p53 mutation was noticed in 9 lesions, mostly dysplastic with a double
nuclear positive rate (30%) compared to only 15% in non-dysplastic
crypts. One third of p53 mutated SSL are microsatellite stable (MSS),
all of them with dysplasia.
Half of the SSL with intense cytoplasmic positivity of BRAF were also
p53 positive, almost all cases being dysplastic.
Almost 1/3 of cases were MSS (5 non-dysplastic and 3 dysplastic) with
BRAF cytoplasmic positivity in 70% of the cells in dysplastic crypts and
54% in non-dysplastic.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that loss of MLH1 expression in non-
dysplastic crypts in SSL could precedes the development of MLH1-
deficient dysplasia and further to adenocarcinoma. SSL with microsatel-
lite stability, but BRAF mutated, has poor prognostic. p53 mutation is
common in MSS/BRAF mutant SSL.
Including immunohistochemical evaluation of BRAF V600E and
Tp53 mutation and loss of MLH1 expression may be the key to
identify sessile serrated lesions with higher potential to progression
into carcinoma.

Density of CD8+ infiltration in the peritumoral mucosa in gastric
cancer is significantly associated with lymphovascular invasion
I. Mikhailov*, N. Danilova, N. Oleynikova, P. Malkov
*Department of Pathology, Medical Research and Educational Center,
Lomonosov Moscow State University, Russia
Background & objectives: The immune microenvironment of
peritumoral tissues is an important trend in gastric cancer research, as
immune cells in peritumoral tissues probably take part in epithelial-
mesenchymal transition, metastasis and other processes of tumour
progression.
Methods: We used samples of surgical material from 134 patients with a
verified gastric cancer. Immunostaining for CD8 (clone C8/144B) were
performed in each case. The immunostaining results were evaluated using
an automatic LASX morphometric analysis system. The results of the
morphometric analysis are presented as the average area of the selected
colour range objects in three fields of view.
Results: By conducting morphometric analysis it was found that the
average area of CD8+ cells in the peritumoral mucosa in tumours with
lymphovascular invasion is 6598.01 sq. microns, and in tumours without
areas of lymphovascular invasion the average area of CD8+ cells is
4012.45 sq. microns. This difference is characterized by a high statistical
significance p=0.0085. But when we assessed the density of CD8+ cell
infiltration in the centre of the tumour tissue there were no significant
differences in lymphovascular invasion.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that the presence of a high density of
CD8+ infiltration of the peritumoral mucosa in gastric cancer may be an
indirect sign of the presence of lymphovascular invasion. This fact also
indicates a possible significant role of inflammatory infiltrate cells in the
peritumoral mucosa for accelerating the processes of invasion and
metastasis.

SOX9 mutation correlates with good prognosis and immune infiltra-
tion in stage II colon cancer
I. Archilla*, M. Cuatrecasas, S. Lahoz, C. Parra, A. Mas, J. Camps
*Pathology Department, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain
Background & objectives: The identification of molecular biomarkers is
essential for a better therapeutic management of early-stage colon cancer
(CC) patients. This study aims to characterize SOX9 mutational status,
immunohistochemical (IHC) expression and its association with recur-
rence in stage II CC.
Methods: 84 chemotherapy-naive stage II CC were included. Tissue
microarrays comprising normal mucosa, bulk of the tumour and invasive
front were constructed for 71 cases and stained with SOX9 and CD8
antibodies. The remaining cases were whole-sectioned and stained with
CD8. DNA-sequencing was performed in 44 cases using a panel of 48
CC-related genes that included SOX9.
Results: SOX9 was overexpressed by IHC in both SOX9 mutated and
wild-type CC when compared to colonic mucosa (P<0.001), being higher
when SOX9 was mutated (P<0.001). Recurrent cases showed higher
SOX9 IHC expression in the bulk of the tumour (P=0.023) but not in
the invasive front. DNA-sequencing revealed SOX9 mutation in 8 cases,
of whom only 1 showed disease recurrence (P=0.046). Consistently,
SOX9 mutations were associated with longer overall survival (P=0.029)
in a validation cohort of 1095 colorectal cancers from the MSK-
IMPACT. SOX9 mutated tumours showed higher CD8 lymphocytic in-
filtration analysed by IHC. Likewise, colorectal tumours from the TCGA
(N=449) harbouring SOX9 mutations exhibited increased expression-
based ImmunophenoScores compared to wild-types (P=0.016)
Conclusion: SOX9 is overexpressed by IHC in stage II CC and it is
associated with the presence of gene mutation. SOX9 mutated tumours
exhibit higher levels of cytotoxic lymphocytes and less frequency of
recurrence, which highlights the potential value of SOX9 as a biomarker
of relapse-free in early-stage CC.

"The imitation game" in mucosal prolapse syndrome: many faces of
one clinical entity
Z. Gahramanli*, C. Cansiz Ersoz, S. Ersoz, B. Savaş, A. Ensari
*Ankara University School of Medicine, Turkey
Background & objectives: Mucosal prolapse syndrome (MPS) is an
umbrella term for rectal mucosal disorders comprising solitary rectal ulcer
syndrome (SRUS), proctitis cystica profunda, inflammatory cloacogenic
polyp, and inflammatory cap polyposis. Histopathological features of
MPS causing resemblance with other disorders including neoplasias were
reviewed.
Methods: In this study, the medical records of 100 patients based on
endoscopic, clinical and histological findings were reviewed retrospec-
tively between 2015-2020. Histopathological features including
fibromuscular obliteration, angulated crypts, serrated epithelial change
(SEC), surface ulceration, muscularis mucosa thickening, mucin lakes
and vascular changes were evaluated by an experienced team, while
resemblance with other disorders was determined by a junior pathologist.
Results: Gender distribution was approximately equal (48% males, 52%
females) with a median age of 54 years. The most common symptom was
abdominal pain and constipation (61%), followed by rectal bleeding
(16%) and weight loss (%6). Endoscopically only 40% of cases showed
ulceration which correlated with histopathology (41%). Fibromuscular
obliteration and crypt distortion were seen in almost all cases (%99 and
%98%, respectively) while angulated crypts were noted in 92%, and SEC
in 93% of cases. Majority of the cases (57%) showed resemblance with
serrated polyps (43% hyperplastic polyps, 14% SSL) while 43% had the
potential to be mistaken for an adenoma (27%) or dysplasia and/or neo-
plasia (15%).
Conclusion: The results of the study suggest that not all MPS cases have
an ulcerated or polypoid appearance endoscopically. However, histopath-
ologic features including complex crypt architecture, SEC, regeneration,
acellular mucin may imitate polyps and/or neoplasia. Therefore, pathol-
ogists should be aware of the “imitation game” this entity likes to play
before making an erroneous diagnosis. This is particularly true for un-
trained eyes who are likely to have difficulties at recognizing this benign
entity.

Congenital enteropathies: a multidisciplinary approach for diagnosis
E.N. Kozan*, C. Tuna Kirsaclıoglu, Z. Kuloglu, B. Savaş, A. Kansu
Tanca, A. Ensari
*Ankara University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Congenital enteropathies constitute a hetero-
geneous cluster of disorders that are rare, typically presenting with severe
diarrhea in infancy. A detailed clinicopathologic documentation of rare
congenital enteropathies with special emphasis on the role of pathologist
in the diagnostic team is presented.
Methods: Clinical, histopathological, and genetic characteristics of 27
cases of congenital enteropathy comprising microvillus inclusion disease,
abetalipoproteinemia, chylomicron retention disease, primary immunode-
ficiency, early onset IBD, DGAT1 deficiency, prolidase deficiency,
RIPK1 gene defect were documented. All patients had duodenal and/or
colonic biopsies which were evaluated for villus morphology, brush bor-
der, endocrine cells, epithelial changes, type and degree of inflammation,
granulomas, lipid accumulation.
Results: Mean age of admission was 1.19 decimal years. Diarrhea was
watery in 74%, fatty in 18.5%, bloody in 11.1% and started within two
months of birth in %59,2. Consanguinity and sibling death due to diarrhea
was present in 74% and 25.9%. Endoscopically, 88% showed duodenal,
Virchows Arch
51,8% had colonic mucosal abnormalities with 20% requiring repeat
biopsies for diagnosis. Genetic diagnosis (SAR1B, STX, MTP, CYBB,
MYO5B, dGAT, RIPK1, PEPD mutations, IL-10 R, IL-21 deficiencies)
was possible in 55.5%. Histopathologically, villous and brush border
abnormalities were observed in 14.8% and in 18.5%, respectively while
40.7% showed active colitis. Electron microscopy revealing microvillous
inclusions and lipid vacuolization was diagnostic in 14.8% of the cases.
Conclusion: Diagnosis of congenital enteropathies is difficult and re-
quires close collaboration between the members of an experienced mul-
tidisciplinary team comprising paediatric gastroenterologists, immunolo-
gists, geneticists, and pathologists. In the present series, pathologic diag-
nosis was possible in 37% of the cases suggesting that overlaps in the
histopathology of these entities are common and full picture may not be
present in initial biopsies. Therefore, the pathologist should be aware of
such pitfalls and should employ sophisticated techniques for an accurate
diagnosis, as necessary.

Mesenchymal tumours of the digestive system: not all are GISTs!
E.D. Kuz*, S. Yuksel, G. Kaygusuz, B. Savaş, A. Ensari
*Ankara University Medical School, Turkey
Background & objectives: Mesenchymal tumours of the digestive system
among which GISTs are the most common, show great diversity similar to
their soft tissue counterparts. We share our sixteen years’ experience by
presenting a large cohort of mesenchymal tumours of digestive system.
Methods: A total of 851 mesenchymal tumours was diagnosed in our
institution between 2005-2021. We encountered 19 out of 26 types of
mesenchymal tumours included in WHO blue book of GI tract. Five
additional sarcomas (dedifferentied, well-differentiated liposarcomas,
myxoid, pleomorphic liposarcomas and undifferentiated pleomorphic
sarcoma) were identified as well. Retroperitoneum-only tumours were
excluded. Tumours were analysed for age, gender, and localization.
Results: Among 851 cases, mean age was 62.91 (Range:5-98) and 54.8%
were women. Top five localizations were stomach (27.3%), colon
(25.7%), liver (20.3%), small intestine (14.5%), esophagus (9.8%) while
pancreas (0.6%), anal canal (0.5%), appendix (0.4%) and biliary tract
(0.3%) were rare. Five most common diagnoses were GISTs (%24.7),
hemangiomas (18.2%), leiomyomas (16.3%), lipomas (15.7%) and in-
flammatory fibroid polyps (IFP) (8.5%). Stomach was the most common
site for GIST (65.2%), followed by small intestine (20.5%) and colon
(5.2%). Hemangiomas preferred liver (96.1%). Esophageal leiomyomas
(50.4%) outnumbered colonic (28.1%) and gastric ones (16.5%). Colon
was the predominant site for submucosal lipomas (78.4%). IFPs were
mostly encountered in stomach (68.1%).
Conclusion: The present series contains a whole spectrum of mesenchy-
mal lesions ranging from benign lesions like angiomyolipomas or
perineuromas to malignant ones like angiosarcomas or even rhabdomyo-
sarcomas. The majority was benign mesenchymal tumours with fewer
sarcomas similar to the literature. As expected, GISTs were the most

colorectal carcinoma
S. Demir*, I. Aydin, N. Ekinci, I.E. Cakir, A. Akder Sari
*Izmir Katip Celebi University, Ataturk Training and Research Hospital,
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: While the overall incidence of colorectal car-
cinoma (CRC) tends to decrease by the help of screening methods, the
incidence under the age of 50 is gradually increasing. Young-onset CRCs
tend to present at advanced stages and generally follow poor prognosis.
Methods: All patients aged under 50 years who were diagnosed with
CRC in resection specimens between 2006-2019 were included in the
study. Data were obtained from the hospital database. The cases were
reviewed according to clinicopathological characteristics.
Results: A total of 188 young-onset CRCs were identified which consti-
tuted 15.8% of all CRCs. The ratio of young onset cases from 2006-2019
per year was as follows: 15.9%, 13.6%, 11.6%, 12.5%, 11.7%, 23.7%,
17.9%, 16.9%, 27%, 12.5%, 8.7%, 15.8%, 13.7%, 20.8% respectively.
The most common histological type was adenocarcinoma (84%), follow-
ed by mucinous (13.3%) and signet-ring cell carcinoma (2.7%). Male to
female ratio was 51.6 vs 48.4%. According to the stage, the distribution
was as follows; stage 1(8%), stage 2(36.7%), stage 3(41%) and stage
4(14.4%). Mismatch repair gene (MMR) immunohistochemical status
information was available for 44 patients performed after 2017. MMR-
deficiency was detected in 12/44 (27%) of them.
Conclusion: According to our single centre data, in contrast to the liter-
ature, the incidence of young onset CRCs is variable and does not seem to
follow an increasing trend. Also, presentation at early stage vs advanced
stage seem to be similar. These variations could be due to epidemiological
differences. The rate of microsatellite instability is in keeping with the
literature and it is approximately 2 times higher in comparison to reported
ratios in adult population.

Pancreatobiliary adenocarcinomas: an immunomarker panel
proposal
M. Pinho*, R. Moiteiro da Cruz, S. Carneiro, C. Ferreira, R. Luís
*Department of Pathology, Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN, Portugal
Background & objectives: Pancreatobiliary adenocarcinomas comprise
various entities that largely share an inconspicuous evolution leading to
abrupt disease in metastatic setting, posing particular challenges to the
histopathological differential diagnosis. Herein, we propose a panel of
immunomarkers for a reliable approach to such tumours.
Methods: Tissue microarrays (TMAs) of 3mm diameter cores were pre-
pared from surgical specimens of 45 primary pancreatobiliary adenocar-
cinomas of the liver, extrahepatic bile ducts, gallbladder, ampulla of Vater
and pancreas, along with 5 colorectal and 5 gastric adenocarcinomas,
included as controls. A panel of CK7, CK20, CK19, CDX-2, SATB2,
Villin, CEAp, IMP3, S100p and Ca19.9 was evaluated.
Results: All TMAs were independently assessed by two observers:
undisputable staining (whether focal or diffuse) was considered pos-
itive, whereas complete or near total absence of expression was
deemed negative; instances with equivocal staining were disregarded.
The majority of markers displayed high positive predictive values,
when compared to both proximal and distal gastrointestinal tract tu-
mours (CK7: 100%, CK19: 91%, villin: 71%, CEAp: 83%, IMP3:
83%, S100p: 88% and Ca19.9: 92%) as well as when plotted only
against gastric carcinomas (CK7: 100%, CK19: 98%, villin: 83%,
CEAp: 92%, IMP3: 83%, S100p: 95%, Ca19.9: 94%). The remaining
markers also presented robust overall negative predictive values
(CK20: 98%, CDX-2: 92%, SATB2: 97%).
Conclusion: A panel comprising the aforementioned antibodies may
provide compelling evidence for a definite diagnosis of
pancreatobiliary adenocarcinomas in metastatic setting, both through
the presence and absence of immunoexpression. However, we are
aware our data stems from a restricted series and limited framework,
particularly regarding the imbalanced number of gastrointestinal con-
trols, and does not reflect the heterogeneity inherent to distinct grades
and entities, namely pertaining to different organs and tumoral
microenvironment.

Clinicopathological characterization of steatohepatitic variant of he-
patocellular carcinoma (SH-HCC)
L. Trapani*, A. Beaufrère, C. Hobeika, F. Cauchy, V. Paradis
*Department of Pathology, Beaujon Hospital, France
Background & objectives: Steatohepatitic hepatocellular carcinoma
(SH-HCC) is a recently described variant of HCC with no consensus
definition and unclear prognosis. The objectives of this study were (1)
to evaluate the frequency of SH-HCC and its prognosis, (2) to describe
their histological characteristics.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective study including 298 patients
surgically treated for HCC between 2012 and 2019. Histological features
of tumours were reassessed by two pathologists. The diagnosis of SH-
HCC was retained if at least 4 of the 5 described criteria were present
(steatosis, ballooning, Mallory-denk bodies, fibrosis, inflammation) and
if the SH contingent was >50% of the tumour area.
Results: Of the 298 HCCs, 39 (13%) were classified as SH-HCC. SH-
HCCs were observed more frequently in a context of metabolic syndrome
and chronic alcohol intake compared to other HCCs (56% vs 26%,
p<0.001 and 28% vs 15%, p=0.039, respectively). Ballooning, fibrosis
and inflammatory were observed in all SH-HCCs whereas steatosis and
Mallory-denk bodies were observed in 92% and 74% of SH-HCCs. No
significant difference was observed with other HCCs in terms of
histoprognostic factors such as tumour differentiation (well-differentiated
tumour, 41% vs 31%, p=0.239). SH-HCCs had similar recurrence-free
and overall survival compared to other HCCs (14 months vs 13 months,
p=0.985 and 23 months vs 24 months, p=0.894, respectively).
Conclusion: SH-HCC is a relatively frequent variant (13% of HCCs in
our cohort) with specific macroscopic and microscopic features that
distinguishing it from other HCCs. It occurs mainly in a context of met-
abolic syndrome or chronic alcohol intake. SH-HCC seems to have a
similar prognosis compared to other HCCs, particularly in terms of
histoprognostic factors and survival.

Ferroptosis in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: an immunohisto-
chemical study
S. Sarcognato*, D. Sacchi, L. Fabris, G. Zanus, E. Gringeri, M. Niero, M.
Guido
*Department of Pathology, Azienda ULSS2 Marca Trevigiana, Treviso,
Italy
Background & objectives: Ferroptosis is a regulated, iron-mediated, cell
death, induced by glutathione peroxidase4 (GPX4) inhibition. GPX4 is
overexpressed in aggressive cancers and directly inhibited by ferroptosis-
inducer drugs. We investigated ferroptosis markers in intrahepatic chol-
angiocarcinoma (iCCA), since no data are reported so far.
Methods: Sixty-twoconsecutivepatients,whounderwenthepatic resection
for iCCA, were retrospectively enrolled. Immunostaining for transferrin-
receptor 1 (TFR1) and GPX4, and Pearls histochemical stain for iron depo-
sition were performed to evaluate ferroptosis. Immunostaining for STAT3
was performed to investigate the well-known anti-apoptotic background
of iCCA, which justifies its chemotherapy resistance.
Results: STAT3 was expressed in the majority of cases (88.7%),
confirming the anti-apoptotic milieu in iCCA. A high STAT3 expression
was associated with a worse prognosis (OS p = 0.006; DFS p = 0.001).
None of the cases showed iron deposition, and a complete negativity for
TFR1 was observed in 93.5% of cases. GPX4 was overexpressed in
72.6% of cases, and its overexpression correlated with poor histological
prognostic parameters, such as vascular and perineural invasion and high
grade (p <0.005 for all) and a worse prognosis (OS p = 0.005; DFS p =
0.0002).
Conclusion: Our study firstly demonstrated that ferroptosis is not an
activated form of regulated cell death in iCCA. GPX4 overexpression is
observed in most cases and correlates with poor outcome. These promis-
ing results pave the way to the possible therapeutic use of ferroptosis
inducers in iCCA to overcome cancer cell drug resistance.

EUSFNB of pancreatic lesions: a prolific outcome
T. Pasupati Meenakshi*
*Clinipath Sdn Bhd, Malaysia
Background & objectives: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-
needle biopsy (FNB) is replacing conventional EUSFNA in the diagnosis
and management of pancreatic mass. The aim is to document the diag-
nostic precision, accuracy and IHC studies of EUS-FNB of pancreatic
lesions when compared to EUSFNA.
Methods: This is a cross sectional study of EUSFNB samples of pancreas
received in Clinipath laboratory in the year 2020, with clinical, CT scan
and endoscopy correlation. A total number of 131 EUSFNB samples of
pancreatic lesions were documented for histological features and IHC
outcome, the latter performed, wherever it was deemed necessary.
Results: A wide range of pancreatic lesions, mostly well to poorly dif-
ferentiated primary adenocarcinomas of the pancreas, along with a small
number of neuroendocrine tumours were documented. Spindle cell tu-
mours, mucinous cystic neoplasms, serous papillary lesions, lymphomas,
and cases of chronic pancreatitis were also seen. Metastatic lesions from
the lung and kidney were also noted. IHC helped to differentiate the
primary and metastatic lesions with precision. Correlation with clinical
picture, tumour markers and CT scan findings were undertaken in all
cases.
Conclusion: EUSFNB has emerged to be the most safe, reliable diagnos-
tic procedure replacing the conventional EUSFNA and cell block of pan-
creatic lesions in Malaysia. The precision of the procedure and accuracy
of the results of EUSFNB samples have considerably increased in the
year 2020. This initial study carried out for the first time in Malaysia in a
private laboratory set up is to document the increasing diagnostic capa-
bility of EUSFNB in the management of pancreatic lesions.

Integrated signature of tumour budding and immunoarchitectural
features significantly improves prognostic stratification of patients
with pancreatic cancer
E. Karamitopoulou-Diamantis*, A. Andreou, M. Tinguely, B. Gloor
*University of Bern, Switzerland
Background & objectives: Tumour budding and the immune cell infil-
trates are known to be important prognostic factors in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, they are assessed independently.
Here we combine their assessment in order to achieve a more precise risk
stratification for PDAC-patients.
Methods: We evaluated the cell-cell interactions and spatial relationship
between tumour budding cells and immune cells at the tumour centre
(TC) and invasive front (IF) of two PDAC-cohorts (n=112:training and
n=30:validation) by using multiplex immunofluorescence for CD3, CD4,
CD8, FOXP3, CD68, CD206, PD-1, PD-L1 and pancytokeratin, follow-
ed by automated image analysis for quantification, proximity analysis and
a Random-Forest variable selection approach.
Results: High numbers of tumour buds (HR=4.678; 95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.204-17.644), low numbers of CD3+CD8+PD-1-T cells
within a radius of 50 μm from the budding cells at the TC (HR=5.010;
95% CI 1.315-19.585) and high CD68+CD206+ tumour associated mac-
rophages (TAMs) (HR=5.563; 95% CI 1.544-23.742) within a radius of
50 μm from the budding cells at the IF area, were associated with reduced
disease specific survival. A prognostic signature integrating all the above
three parameters achieved a more significant cohort stratification
(HR=11.585; 95% CI 3.649-46.813). This was confirmed in the valida-
tion cohort (HR=10.333; 95% CI 2.742-38.563).
Virchows Arch
Conclusion: An Integrated Budding Immune Signature (IBIS) stratified
PDAC-patients into prognostic subgroups more efficiently than each bio-
marker alone, improving the prognostic power and risk stratification in-
dependently of other known prognostic factors, including tumour grade
or tumour stage.

High tumour mutational burden identifies a subset of pancreatic
cancer patients with prolonged survival and improved anti-tumour
immunity
E. Karamitopoulou-Diamantis*, A. Andreou, M. Tinguely, B. Gloor
*University of Bern, Switzerland
Background & objectives: Imunotherapy in pancreatic cancer (PC) has
focused on microsatellite-instable (MSI-high) cases, representing <2% of
patients. Identifying microsatellite-stable (MSS) PCs with high tumour
mutational burden (TMB-H) and exploring their microenvironment
might expand the number of PC-patients that could benefit from
immunotherapy.
Methods: We evaluated TMB in 110 MSS PC-specimens using the
Oncomine Tumour Mutation Load Assay (ThermoFisher) and the
Comprehensive Cancer Panel. Moreover, whole tissue sections of 12
TMB-H cases (i.e. TMB≥10; TMB-H) and 15 cases with low TMB
(TMB<10, TMB-L) were immunoprofiled by multiplex immunofluores-
cence for CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, CD20, CD68, PD-1, PD-L1 and DC-
LAMP, followed by automated image analysis.
Results: Twelve TMB-H cases (10.9%; median TMB: 14.87, range:
10.21-34.96) were detected. TMB-H cases exhibited significantly in-
creased CD3+CD4+FOXP3- T cells (P=0.0398), CD20+ B cells
(P=0.0296) and DC-LAMP+ dendritic cells (DC; P=0.0093) when com-
pared with TMB-L cases. No significant differences were observed re-
garding all other immune cell infiltrates or their subsets. No correlation
was found between TMB and the PD1/PD-L1 staining pattern. TMB-H
cases exhibited an improved overall survival (median OS:27 months,
range:5-171) and progression free survival (median PFS:21.5 months,
range:3-165) compared with the TMB-L cases (median OS:13 months,
range:3-161; median PFS:6.5 months, range:3-157), each P<0.001.
Conclusion: TMB-H PCs display improved anti-tumour immunity
mediated by increased DC numbers, which have the capacity to ini-
tiate and regulate T cell responses, and increased counts of CD3+
CD4+FOXP3-T cells, known to exhibit direct cytotoxicity against
tumour cells as well as potentiate the DC. Moreover, CD20+ B cells
and DC can prime T cells to target tumour cells due to antigen pre-
sentation. These results partially explain the improved survival of
TMB-H patients and suggest that they might be good candidates for
immunotherapy.

Intra and extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma distinction – useful an-
cillary markers
J. Gama*, R. Oliveira Caetano, P. Teixeira, F. Silva, R. Martins, J.G.
Tralhão, M.A. Cipriano
*Pathology Department, Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Centro
Hospitalar e Universitário Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Cholangiocarcinoma originates anywhere in
the biliary tract epithelium. Frequently the pathologist is questioned if the
tumour sample is from a primary liver tumour or a metastasis. This study
assessed the value of ancillary techniques in that distinction.
Methods: A retrospective transversal study was completed using ar-
chival biological material from 32 patients with cholangiocarcinomas,
16 intra-hepatic (IHC) and 16 extra-hepatic (EHC), 25 male and 7
female, diagnosed between 2009 and 2014 at the Coimbra
University Hospital.
Expression PAS/D, EMA, Gamma-GT markers were assessed by histo-
and immunohistochemistry. Clinical and pathological data was retrieved
from the hospital database.
Results: The median age of presentation was 69.7±9.7years. After a
median follow-up of 12±29.4months, the overall survival (OS) was 12
±3.7months. There was no difference in survival between the IHC and
EHC (p=0.168).
EMA expression was associated with the site of origin: apical
EMA expression in 56.3% of IHC and complete EMA expression
in 87.5% of the EHC (p=0.012). The complete EMA expression
was also associated with a worse OS (5 vs. 66months, p=0.008)
on univariate and multivariate analysis (HR=3.2, 95% CI 1,21-
8.09, p=0.013).
Expression of Gamma-GT was present in 43,8% of IHC and 6,3% of
EHC (p=0.019).
PAS/D did not disclose statistical correlation with either OS or tumour
location.
Conclusion: The expression of Gamma-GT and EMA were helpful in
determining the origin of cholangiocarcinoma, and EMA complete ex-
pression was predictor of worse OS. These markers should be tested in
any cholangiocarcinoma biopsy.

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas – a 21-year long
experience in a tertiary Portuguese institution
R. Moiteiro da Cruz*, M. Pinho, R. Luís, C. Ferreira
*Department of Pathology, Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN; Faculdade
de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal
Background & objectives: Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) of
the pancreas is a rare low-grade malignant tumour which accounts for
0,9-2,7% of all exocrine pancreatic neoplasms, with higher incidence in
women of young age. Herein, we present our expertise through a 21-year
long series.
Methods: Data of all cases of SPN diagnosed in our institution pertaining
to the period of 2000-2020 were retrieved. The clinicopathological, gross
and histopathological features along with performed immunomarkers
(beta-catenin, CD56, CD10, progesterone receptors (PR), chromogranin
and synaptophysin) were reviewed and summarized; additionally, the
expression of galectin-3, AMACR and TFE-3 was also retrospectively
evaluated in different tumour areas.
Results: A total of 9 cases were assessed: 6 patients were female
(mean:30years; range:12-58years) and 3 were male (mean:50years;
range:31-75years). The tumours were large (sized 3-8cm;
mean:5cm), unifocal, well-demarcated and cystic-solid, with no
preferential topography. Histologically, the classical features were
present; most had perineural invasion and focal pancreatic infiltra-
tion, along with singular findings: areas of oncocytic differentia-
tion, strands of neoplastic cells within a myxoid/edematous stroma,
extracellular iron deposits and infrequent mitoses (range:0-4 high-
power-fields). Beta-catenin, CD56, CD10, PR, AMACR and TFE-3
were diffusely positive, whereas focal expression for synaptophysin
and negativity for galectin-3 and chromogranin were observed.
Noteworthy, nodal, and hepatic metastases were reported in two
cases.
Conclusion: Histological features of SPN are quite specific, al-
though diverse. The differential diagnosis becomes intricate in the
presence of small-solid lesions or large-unilocular cysts, especially
in male patients. Beta-catenin, AMACR and TFE-3 can aid pathol-
ogists to differentiate this entity from other pancreatic circumscribed
tumours, namely neuroendocrine tumours; interestingly, galectin-3
was negative in all cases, unlike reported in the literature. SPN may
uncommonly behave aggressively with no well-established malig-
nant criteria; however our case with hepatic metastization showed
a higher mitoses count.

Diagnostic challenges in ichthyosiform dermatoses
A. Cohn*, C. Salavastru, M. Gherghiceanu
*Emergency University Hospital, Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Neonatal and infantile erythroderma is a rare
skin disorder, frequently associated with ichthyoses or immunodeficiency
syndromes. This study emphasizes the ultrastructural features found in
ichthyosiform conditions in order to establish a relationship between
electron microscopy findings and genetic mutations.
Methods: Two infants with clinical ichthyosiform dermatoses, one with
erythroderma, were biopsied for diagnostic purpose. Skin biopsy speci-
mens were processed at "Victor Babeș" National Institute of Pathology
for both light microscopy and electron microscopy (EM) studies. Clinical
data were gathered from patients’ medical record. The cases were evalu-
ated according to age, sex, clinical diagnosis, genetic profile, and histo-
pathologic and ultrastructural findings.
Results: Case 1: A 7-day-old boy with erythroderma was ultimately
diagnosed with Omenn syndrome (RAG-1 gene mutation). Light micros-
copy revealed acanthosis, parakeratosis, and perivascular lymphocytic
infiltrate in the dermis. EM showed an increased number of lamellar
bodies in stratum granulosum (SG). Lipid vacuoles were found in stratum
corneum (SC), both intercellular and intracellular.
Case 2: Skin biopsy from a 2-month-old boy presents microscopically
orthohyperkeratosis with lipid droplets in SC and a reduced SG.
Ultrastructural study of SG revealed a decreased number of keratohyalin
granules and keratinocytes with cytoplasmic vacuoles and angulated,
electron-lucent structures. Cholesterol clefts, aggregates of membranous
structures and lipid vacuoles were found in corneocytes.
Conclusion: This study highlights the significant overlap between ultra-
structural features found in Omenn syndrome and autosomal recessive
congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) type I.
The second case presents particular EM findings, consistent with ARCI
type II/III. Even if the initial presentation pointed towards ichthyosis
vulgaris, the diagnosis of ARCI was genetically confirmed by NIPAL-4
gene mutation. At follow-up, the patient developed erythroderma.
As etiologic diagnosis of ichthyosiform conditions is often difficult, EM
examination may point out some genetic defects before becoming clini-
cally apparent.

TROP2: a potential new marker in diagnosis of thyroid neoplasms
Z. Turan*, S. Erkilic
*Department of Pathology, Medical Faculty, Gaziantep University,
Turkey
Background & objectives: The human trophoblast cell surface antigen
(TROP-2) which is a transmembrane glycoprotein, has recently been
investigated as a useful marker of thyroid epithelial neoplasms. In this
study, we aimed to show the diagnostic utility of TROP2 in thyroid
neoplasms.
Methods: A total of 306 cases, including 170 cases of different PTC
variants, 50 cases of benign and non-neoplastic lesions, and 86 cases of
other neoplasms (NIFT-P, follicular carcinoma, Hürthle cell carcinoma,
poorly differentiated carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma, and medullary
thyroid carcinoma), were included in this study. Only membranous stain-
ing with TROP2 was considered positive.
Results: In PTC, classical(n=35), tall cell(n=41), follicular(n=39),
solid(n=19), hobnail(n=10), Warthin-like(n=10), columnar(n=7) and
oncocytic variant(n=9), respectively, 100%, 97.6%, 5.1%, 42.1%, 90%,
90%, 28.6% and 33.3% positivity were seen. A negative reaction was
observed in all 50 cases of benign and non-neoplastic lesions (follicular
adenoma(n=10), Hürthle cell adenoma(n=10), hyperfunction(n=10) and
multinodular goiter(n=20)). Negative reactions were observed in 83
(n=86) of other thyroid neoplasms which consist of NIFT-P(n=20), fol-
licular carcinoma(n=18), Hürthle cell carcinoma(n=18), poorly differen-
tiated carcinoma(n=10), anaplastic carcinoma(n=10) and medullary thy-
roid carcinoma(n=10). Only focal positivity were seen in 3 Hürthle cell
carcinoma cases. The sensitivity for tall cell and classical variant was
97.5% and 100%, respectively, and specificity was 100% for both.
Conclusion: TROP2 was seen to be a very useful marker in differentiat-
ing PTC, especially in particular variants (classic, tall cell, hobnail and
Warthin-like variant), from benign and non-neoplastic lesions and other
neoplasms of the thyroid.

Poor prognostic factors of papillary thyroid microcarcinomas
Z. Turan*, S. Erkilic
*Department of Pathology, Medical Faculty, Gaziantep University,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PMC),
by definition, are tumours 1 cm or less and are considered to have a good
prognosis. However, PMCs may sometimes cause lymph node metasta-
sis, distant metastasis, and even disease-related death.
Methods: Pathology reports of patients who underwent thyroidectomy
were analysed. 1194(44.9%) of 2660 papillary thyroid carcinoma cases
were PMC. 58 cases (4.85%) who had lymph node metastasis and/or re-
ceived multiple doses of radioactive iodine (RAI) and/or tumour-related
death, were re-examined in detail, and were assigned as the study group.
The remaining 1136 cases were included in the study as control group.
Results: In the study group, 44 had lymph node metastases, 4 had distant
metastases, 14 had disease-related death. The remaining 14 patients received
multipledosesofRAItherapyforrecurrencesorothercauses.Thetumourwas
bilateralin29patients(50%)andmultifocalin36patients(62%).Microscopic
extrathyroidal extension (ETE) was detected in 32 patients (55.2%). 32 pa-
tients (55.2%), whether focal or diffuse, had a tall cell histological variant
component. Tumour diameter was >0.5 cm in 35 patients (60.3%).
We found that aggressive course of the tumour was associated with; age
at diagnosis (≥55 age), bilaterality, male gender, tumour diameter (>0.5
cm), microscopic ETE, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis,
tumour-thyroid capsule relationship, and aggressive histological variants.
Conclusion: Although a very good prognosis is mostly observed in pap-
illary microcarcinoma, it should be kept in mind that some clinical and
histomorphological features may cause poor clinical course.

Extra-adrenal paraganglioma clinical and histopathological fea-
tures: a 16-year period institutional case review series
T. Oliveira*, J. Boavida, D. López-Presa
*Department of Pathology, Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN, Portugal
Background & objectives: Extra-adrenal paragangliomas are non-
epithelial tumours originating from paraganglion cells of the auto-
nomic nervous system, with a biological behaviour ranging from
indolent to metastasizing. Herein, we reviewed and evaluated 36
paraganglioma cases received by our institution during a 16-year
period (2000-2015).
Virchows Arch
Methods: The clinical history and slides of all cases were reviewed by an
anatomic pathology resident and a senior pathologist and assessed for:
tumour size, location, multifocality, microscopic characteristics, catechol-
amine secretion profile, Grading of Adrenal Pheochromocytoma and
Paraganglioma (GAPP) score, hereditary conditions, metastasis and
cancer-related death.
Results: Eighteen cases were from the head and neck (13 from the carotid
body, 3 jugulotympanic, 1 laryngeal and 1 non-specified), 3 were thoracic
and 15 were abdominal/pelvic. Two and one patients had a Succinate
dehydrogenase complex subunit D (SDHD) and subunit B (SDHB) gene
mutations, respectively, and 1 had Von Hippel Lindau disease; save for
the later, they had multiple tumours and a mean age of 38 years. GAPP
score grading was feasible on 14 cases: 6 were well-differentiated and 8
were moderately differentiated type. All three patients that showed me-
tastasis were moderately differentiated type and sporadic, of which only
one died due to disease progression.
Conclusion: In our study, the factors that were possibly related to a worse
prognosis were the GAPP score grade, size, and location. While these
tumours are biologically unpredictable, multivariable prognostic tools,
such as the GAPP score, can aid in outlining an appropriate patient’s
management. Despite its small sample size, our case series’ findings are
consistent with current reported data.

G. Pennelli
*University of Padua, Department of Medicine (DIMED), Pathology
Unit, Via Gabelli 61, 35121 Padova, Italy
Background & objectives: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is
an indolent neoplasm with lymph-node and distant metastases and
there is no effective therapy to achieve a remission in advanced
stages. Our study paid attention on the role of the immunoregulatory
PD1 / PD-L1 axis.
Methods: The study considered 130 patients with histological diagnosis of
MTC (104 sporadic and 26 hereditary MTC) with a follow-up time of 39
months. All patients were characterized for clinical-pathological variable
and disease progression at the end of follow-up. Immunohistochemical
analysis were performed for CD8, PD-1 and PD-L1. PD1 and PD-L1
staining was evaluated according to the Combined Positive Score system.
Results: The immunoreaction for PD-L1 was positive in 32.3% of MTC.
PD-L1 was more expressed in patients with sporadic disease (p = 0.01)
and in patients with aggressive disease characterized by the presence of
lymph node metastases (p < 0.0001) and elevated Calcitonin values at
diagnosis (p = 0.003). The expression of PD-L1 correlated with the ex-
pression of PD1 (p <0.0001) and the presence of positive CD8 T lym-
phocytes (p < 0.0001). At the end of follow-up, PD-L1 positivity corre-
lated with the progression of disease. At the multivariate analysis, the loss
for PD-L1 expression, together with a lower stage at diagnosis, were the
only prognostic markers associated with biochemical cure.
Conclusion: This study confirms the importance of the PD-L1 / PD1
interaction also in MTC. The correlation between PD-L1 expression
and disease progression opens the way to the possibility of using immu-
nomodulatory drugs with PD-L1 as target in MTC, which could signifi-
cantly modify the clinical course of the disease, especially in those pa-
tients who cannot be already cured.

*Voronezh State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: The study of age-related changes in the thy-
roid tissue is important for understanding the essence of the processes
occurring in the organ. Is there a relationship between background chang-
es and nodal pathology?
Methods: The material was 73 thyroid glands, autopsy material without
clinical and laboratory signs of endocrine pathology. Follicle diameter,
epithelial height, colloid accumulation index, follicular epithelium vol-
ume and stromal volume were studied in histological preparations. Age-
related changes were analysed both in the background tissue and in nod-
ular pathology, taking into account age groups.
Results: In the age group over 60 years old, there was increased the
volume of stroma, decreased of the epithelium volume, a decreasing the
height of the epithelium and increasing the diameter of the follicles com-
pared with the group under 60 years old. Characteristics of the nodes: the
same morphological indicators demonstrated that the decreasing func-
tional activity in the tissue of the nodes does not occur with age, as in
the background tissue. There is no pronounced process of sclerosis.
Decreasing the size of follicles, the index of colloid accumulation, in-
creasing volume of the epithelium speaks of a higher functional activity
of the nodules in the group over 60 years old.
Conclusion: Age-related changes in the background tissue of the organ
indicate a natural decrease in the functional abilities of the thyroid gland.
The data obtained may be a manifestation of adaptive intraorgan
restructuring, which allows the thyroid gland to maintain a high level of
functional activity, despite the natural processes of extinction.

Clinicopathological and biological features of well-differentiated
Grade 3 neuroendocrine neoplasms of various primary origins
V. Delektorskaya*, E. Evdokimova, G. Chemeris, E. Artamonova
*National Medical Research Center of Oncology, Russia
Background & objectives: Grade 3 neuroendocrine tumours (G3
NETs) represent a group of well-differentiated neuroendocrine neo-
plasms that demonstrate a Ki-67 index higher than 20%. Little is
known regarding clinicopathological differences between G3 NETs
from different primary sites, most commonly gastroenteropancreatic
(GEP) and lung.
Methods: The study included 71 resected G3 NET cases, which
were reviewed for morphology and immunohistochemistry and
graded according to the WHO 2019 criterions. Median age at the
diagnosis was 50 ± 12 (range 20 – 73 ) years and 48 (65.8%) were
females. The results were correlated with clinicopathologic data, Ki-
67 index, somatostatin receptor 2A expression and disease-free sur-
vival (DFS).
Results: Of the 71 well-differentiated G3 NET cases, 40 (56.3%) were
GEP, 17 (23.9%) lung, 12 (16.9%) other (ovary, thymus, unknown pri-
mary). The most common primary site was pancreas, followed by gastric.
The mean Ki-67 index was 35.4% (min. 23.0% - max. 65.0%). Metastatic
disease was present in 45 (67.4%) patients. We found that tumours arising
from GEP site, compared to lung, had significantly worse survival
(p<0.05). Median DFS in GEP, lung and all other sites of G3 NETs
was 9.7, 16.6 and 2.5 months, respectively. The most of G3 NET patients
(56, 78.8%) had SSTR 2A-positive immunohistochemical status. SSTR
2A expression did not correlate to clinical parameters, Ki-67 index, DFS
survival.
Conclusion: Well-differentiated G3 NENs with elevated proliferation
may develop anywhere in the digestive tract, lung, and rare sites. G3
NENs of different primary origins are a heterogeneous group of neo-
plasms regarding clinicopathological and biological characteristics, be-
haviour and survival outcomes. Among G3 NEN cohort, tumours which
originate from a GEP site have a worse survival compared to lung. The
most of G3 NETs have SSTR 2A-positive status which provides addi-
tional important information and can help guide management of these
group of patients.

Taulí I3PT, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Sabadell, Spain
Background & objectives: The diagnosis of Non-Invasive Follicular
Thyroid Neoplasia with Papillary Nuclear Features (NIFTP) is based on
morphological criteria that may be subjective. The aim of our study was
to assess the concordance between pathologists regarding this entity and
its diagnostic criteria.
Methods: After a previous multicentre study about NIFTP incidence,
slides considered representative of typical NIFTP (8), doubtful for
NIFTP (8) or without NIFTP criteria (6) were selected and reviewed by
8 pathologists with special dedication to endocrine pathology, assessing
nuclear criteria, presence of papillae, psammoma bodies, capsule, capsu-
lar invasion, vascular invasion and diagnosis. Brennan-Prediger kappa
coefficient was established to assess agreement.
Results: The overall agreement reached a kappa value of 0.60. For the
different variables, kappa values were: nuclear shape: 0.33; nuclear mem-
brane: 0.39; chromatin: 0.25; nuclear score: 0.16; papillae: 0.48;
psammoma bodies: 0.77; capsule: 0.50; capsular invasion: 0.60; vascular
invasion: 0.86 and diagnosis: 0.25. When grouping the cases according to
initial diagnosis, kappa values improved in the typical and non-NIFPT
groups in terms of overall agreement (0.63 and 0.62), presence of papillae
(0.67 and 0.65), capsular invasion (0.66 and 0.67) and vascular invasion
(0.93 and 1) respectively, and only in the typical group in terms of diagnosis
(0.33), being 0.17 in the doubtful group and 0.24 in the non-NIFTP group.
Conclusion: The degree of agreement regarding NIFTP and bordering
entities (hyperplastic nodule, follicular adenoma, follicular or well differ-
entiated tumour of uncertain malignant potential, subtypes of papillary
carcinoma, follicular carcinoma) among pathologists with special dedica-
tion to endocrine pathology was moderate, with the lowest values being
observed in the nuclear characteristics and the highest values in the pres-
ence of psammoma bodies, capsular invasion and vascular invasion.
Fortunately, the two latter criteria are the most significant to determine
a diagnosis of carcinoma.

and Technology of Targu Mures, Romania
Background & objectives: Cervical clear cell carcinoma is an HPV-
independent adenocarcinoma. While recent studies have focused on gastric
type endocervical adenocarcinomas (GTA), little is known about CCCs.
We analysed clinico-pathologic parameters and outcomes of CCCs com-
pared to GTA and HPV-associated endocervical adenocarcinoma (HPVA).
Methods: 58 CCCs were collected from 14 international institutions.
Correlation between various parameters to overall (OS) and recurrence
free survival (RFS) was retrospectively analysed using univariable and
multivariable methods. OS and RFS were also compared to those of 36
GTA and 173 HPVA.
Results: Most cases were treated with radical surgery (84.5%), 55.2% adju-
vant therapy, were FIGO stage I (70.7%), Silva C pattern (75.9%), and
histologic grade 3 (96.6%). Lympho-vascular invasion was present in 31%
and lymph node metastases in 22.4%; 10.3% had pelvic metastases, 32.8%
had recurrences and 18.96% died of disease. There were no statistically
significant differences in OS and RFS between CCC and GTA at 5 and 10
years (p=0.313 and p=0.508 respectively), but there were significant differ-
ences in OS and RFS between CCC and HPVA (p=0.003 and p=0.032
respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that OS in influenced by recur-
rence (p=0.009), while RFS is influenced by FIGO stage (p=0.025).
Conclusion: CCCs have poorer outcomes than HPVA but similar out-
comes to GTA. Oncologic treatment significantly influences RFS in uni-
variate analysis but is not an independent prognostic factor in multivariate
analysis. Since current therapies do not improve outcome in patients with
CCCs, new oncologic strategies are needed.

cance in endocervical adenocarcinoma (ECA): a retrospective study
of 2019 FIGO low-stage 416 cases

*Department of Pathology, University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences
and Technology of Targu Mures, Romania
Background & objectives: FIGO2019 update on cervical cancer staging
removed horizontal tumour extent (HZTE) as a staging variable in micro-
scopic disease (stage IA) due to its poor reproducibility. We aimed to
investigate the association of HZTE with survival outcomes in patients
with ECAs.
Methods: We retrospectively analysed 416 cases of stage I ECAs from
16 international institutions. Clinico-pathologic parameters and HZTE
were retrieved from pathology reports and stage was assigned using
2019 FIGO criteria. Correlation between HZTE, prognostic parameters,
overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) were performed
using univariable and multivariable analyses.
Results: 71 (56.3%) stage IA cases had HZTE <7 mm and 55 (43.7%) ≥7
mm, while 23 stage IB cases (7.9%) had HZTE <7 mm and 267 (92.1%)
≥7 mm (p=0.0001). 4 (3.2%) stage IA patients developed recurrence
compared to 41 (14.1%) stage IB patients (p=0.002). Of the 4 stage IA
patients with recurrences (1 IA1, 3 IA2), 3 had tumours with HZTE <7
mm, one of which was IA1. One stage IA2 case had tumour with HZTE
≥7mm. 14 stage IB patients died of disease, all with HZTE ≥7 mm, while
no stage IA patients died of disease. In multivariate analysis OS and RFS
were not influenced by HZTE.
Conclusion: HZTE does not improve the prognostication of patients with
stage IA cancer as per the 2019 FIGO staging system and does not add
meaningful prognostic information in early-stage microscopic lesions.
Consequently, the FIGO rationale to remove this variable from the stag-
ing exercise is justified for ECAs.

Abreu, C. Bartosch
*Department of Pathology, IPO-Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Uterine leiomyosarcomas (uLMS) have var-
iable expression of hormonal receptors. High tumour expression is asso-
ciated with good response to hormonal therapy. In this study we aimed to
Virchows Arch
evaluate the concordance of hormonal receptors’ expression between
primary uLMS and matched recurrences/metastases.
Methods: Retrospective cohort study (1980-2019), including 29 uLMS
patients with recurrent/metastatic disease confirmed by histology; 24 with
available primary uLMS. Clinical files and histological slides were
reviewed. Immunohistochemistry study with antibodies for
oestrogen(ER) and progesterone(PR) receptors was performed. ER/PR
were evaluated in primary uLMS and all recurrence/metastatic samples,
both using a binary classification (positive/negative) and categories of %
positive tumour cells.
Results: Most primary tumours were ER/PR positive (ER: n=21, 87.5%;
PR: n=17, 70.8%), with a variable proportion of expression (ER/PR:
median=30-40%, range: 0 to 90-100% tumour cells). Thirteen (44.8%)
patients had biopsies from more than one metastasis. ER/PR positivity
was observed in 19 (65.5%) of first metastases. Most primary tumours
had concordant expression with first metastasis (n=16, 66.7%), but 8 had
discordant results: 7 changed from positive to negative and 1 from neg-
ative to positive. Within those that lost ER/PR expression in metastases, 5
had less than 30-40% of positive tumour cells in primary uLMS. Three
showed discordant expression between different metastases of the same
patient.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that concordance between primary
uLMS and metastasis is moderate. This variation most likely is due to
biological subclonal selection or changes in metastatic tumour cells, but
pre-analytical sample conditions may also influence results. If hormonal
therapy guided by hormonal receptors’ expression is considered for pa-
tient management in metastatic uLMS, ER/PR evaluation in metastasis
may be useful.

Macroscopic and histological sentinel lymph node processing in en-
dometrium carcinoma - pathological routine aspects of ultra-staging
T. Rau*, M.V. Deppeler, F. Siegenthaler, S. Imboden, A. Papadia, M.D.
Mueller
*Institute of Pathology, University Bern, Switzerland
Background & objectives: Molecular characterization of endometrial
carcinoma should be balanced by complete conventional histopathologi-
cal parameter of the TNM-system. Sentinel lymphadenectomy represents
a safe and informative compromise for pN evaluation. The various
ultrastaging options enclose macroscopic preparation, frozen section,
step-sectioning and pan-cytokeratin immunohistochemistry.
Methods: 834 sentinel lymph nodes from 206 patients treated at the
University Hospital Inselspital Bern between 2012-2020 were processed.
Macroscopic treatment allowed for complete (26.9%), bi-valved (37.6%)
or lamellated (35.5%) lymph nodes. Histologically, specimen were treat-
ed with frozen section (5.8%), with step sectioning in 3 steps with 200
microns distance (95.1%) and pan-cytokeratin immunohistochemistry
(93.4%), referenced to the first HE (100%).
Results: In total 73 positive lymph nodes were found (8.8%), which
could be split to 42 macroscopic, 6 micro metastasis and 25 lymph nodes
with isolated tumour cells. In comparison of macroscopy, significantly
higher detection rates were found in lamellated sentinel lymphnodes
(p<0.004). In the small part of frozen section no macro metastasis were
missed and even 2 micro metastasis detected. Pan-cytokeratin immuno-
histochemistry mainly contributed to the detection of isolated tumour
cells and some micrometastasis, but also highlighted relevant pitfalls like
endosalpingiosis, mesothelial inclusions etc. An added value to
macrometastasis detection by immunohistochemistry was not found,
which in 92.9% of cases were detected with the first HE before step
sectioning.
Conclusion: Prior to considerations of ultra-staging in terms of immuno-
histochemistry, routine workup of sentinel lymphadenectomy starts with
appropriate grossing with lamellation. Frozen section is a robust tech-
nique in terms of macro-metastasis detection. The roles of micro-
metastasis and isolated tumour cells have yet to be clarified in terms of
prognostication.

Gori, P. Cassandrini, G. Zamboni
*Dept of Pathology-IRCCS Ospedale Sacro Cuore-Don Calabria, Negrar,
Italy
Background & objectives: BRCA1/2 test on ovarian cancer tissue is
recommend at the time of diagnosis to predict response to PARP-
inihibitors. As malignat ascites is a rich souce to characterized cancer
cells, we aim to investigate BRCA1/2 status on this material.
Methods: 24 cases of high-grade serous carcinoma with neoplastic asci-
tes were selected for the study. 5/24 of ascites were neoplastich rich
(neoplastic cells >50% x 4), 16/24 had an intermediate cellularity (20-
50%) and 3/24 had a poor neoplastic cellularity (< 20%). NGS techniques
were used and BRCA1/2 variants were compared with data previously
obtained from peripheral blood/tumour tissue.
Results: 21/24 cases were informative for BRCA1/2 status: 10 were
BRCA1/2 positive and 11 were BRCA1/2 negative. The concordance
of BRCA1/2 between malignant ascites and tumour tissue/blood was
100%. Among the BRCA1/2 positive cases, 9 had germline mutation
and 1 had somatic mutation. Of the 3/24 non informative cases 2/3 had
poor neoplastic cellularity and 1/3 was neoplastic rich.
Conclusion: Malignant ascites is a good source of neoplastic cells to
characterize BRCA1/2 status. As the paracentesis is quick, easy to per-
form, the NGS analysis on cytologic material can be considered compa-
rable to that obtained in conventional neoplastic materials. This open new
prospective to study BRCA1/2 status at the time of diagnosis and follow
the evolution of BRCA1/2 mutation during therapy in ovarian cancer as
well as in other neoplasia eligible to PARP-inhibitors therapy.

Gori, P. Cassandrini, Z. Gianfranco, G. Zamboni
*Dept of Pathology-IRCCS Ospedale Sacro Cuore-Don Calabria, Negrar,
Italy
Background & objectives: Endometrial serous carcinoma (ESC) shares
with ovarian serous carcinoma morphology, p53 mutation and behaviour
but few data are available on somatic-BRCA 1/2 status. We evaluated
BRCA 1/2 status by Next Generation Sequencing technique (NGS) in a
cohort of ESC.
Methods: From a cohort of 104 cases of high-grade endometrial carci-
noma, 80 cases fitted the morphological criteria of serous carcinoma or
mixed carcinoma with a serous component. 64 cases were eligible for
molecular studies: 48 serous carcinoma, 12 carcinosarcoma and 4 mixed
tumour serous-endometrioid. DNA was extracted from paraffin tissue and
BRCA 1/2 genes were sequenced using NGS techniques.
Results: 62/64 (96.8%) cases were informative for BRCA 1/2 status:
5/62 (8%) had a pathogenetic variant, 2/5 in BRCA1 and 3/5 in
BRCA2. 5/5 (100%) BRCA1/2 positive had a pure serous histology;
5/62 (8%) had a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) (3 cases with a
pure serous histology and 2 cases were carcinosarcomas). 8/48 (16%) of
serous carcinoma were BRCA 1/2 positive/VUS. 52 cases (84%) were
BRCA 1/2 negative.
Conclusion: Somatic-BRCA 1/2 mutation is present in 16% of the cases
and in 8% as a pathogenetic variant. If we consider endometrial
Virchows Arch
carcinoma with pure serous histology 10.4% harbour a pathogenetic
variant of BRCA1/2 which is the same incidence reported in the
literature for high grade serous tubo-ovarian carcinoma. Those data
open the scenario of a possible predictive value for target therapy
with PARP-inhibitors.

Placental pathologic findings of women with SARS-CoV-2 infection
during pregnancy and early neonatal follow-up
F. Pereira*, C. Padrão, M. Roquette, L. Monteiro
*Hospital Prof. Doutor Fernando Fonseca, Portugal
Background & objectives: Transplacental transmission of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been suggested
in very rare cases reported. Our aim is to evaluate the histopathologic
findings in the placentas of women with prenatal SARS-CoV-2 infection
and its repercussions on foetuses.
Methods: The study included placentas received for one year in our
hospital. Clinical data, histopathologic placental findings, immunostain-
ing for the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein and foetal infection rates were col-
lected. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed in all live births.
Nucleocapsid protein and spike protein antibodies, and SARS-CoV-2
RT-PCR in some samples from the placenta, foetus blood or foetus fluids
were also tested.
Results: Eighteen patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests at most 10
days before labour were included. The placentas were divided in two
groups depending on the immunohistochemical result for SARS-CoV-
2: negative (n=16) and positive group (n=2). One patient experienced
minor symptoms, fourteen were asymptomatic and the remaining are
unknown. The placentas were subsequently subdivided based on medical
history or maternal complications usually associated with placental path-
ological findings. There were 10 placentas cases with maternal
malperfusion (8 in the negative and 2 in the positive group), 3 had foetal
malperfusion (all in the negative group), 10 had inflammatory alterations
(8 in the negative and 2 in the positive group) and 7 had other findings.
Conclusion: Although the placental/foetal transmission seems to be rare,
probably due to the physical and immunological barrier of the placenta,
our data suggests the increased presence of maternal/foetal vascular
malperfusion and histiocytic intervillositis in placentas delivered from
SARS-CoV-2-positive women. All live foetuses had negative nasopha-
ryngeal swabs despite five positive cases to nucleocapsid antibodies (to-
tals=4, IgG=1) due to maternal immunization. At the date of the abstract,
we still don't have the results from placenta, foetus blood or foetus fluids
for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR.

Claudin-18 as a surrogate marker for endocervical gastric-type
carcinoma

Park, R.A. Soslow
*Department of Pathology, The Jikei University School of Medicine,
Japan
Background & objectives: Claudin-18 has been shown to be frequently
expressed in gastric and pancreatobiliary carcinoma. This study was car-
ried out to investigate whether Claudin-18 could be a surrogate marker to
separate endocervical gastric-type carcinoma (GAS) from other types of
endocervical adenocarcinoma (ECA).
Methods: ECAs from 7 international institutions were reviewed by a
panel of pathologists for consensus histotype based on recently developed
International Endocervical Criteria and Classification (IECC). Tissue mi-
croarrays were constructed to analyse Claudin-18 expression using im-
munohistochemistry to simulate assessment in small biopsies. The stain-
ing was scored and any staining in >5% of tumour cells considered as
positive.
Results: Of 174 ECAs, 125 were of usual-type, 23 GAS, 7 clear cell and
19 other types. Claudin-18 expression was significantly frequent in GASs
(15/23, 65.2%) than in non-GASs (3/151, 2.0%; all usual-type) (p<0.01).
Positive and negative predictive values of Claudin-18 for GAS were
83.3% and 94.9%, respectively. All Claudin-18 positive GASs showed
strong and diffuse staining pattern with staining in more than 75% of
tumour cells. None of clear cell type showed positivity for Claudin-18.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that Claudin-18 is a promising surrogate
marker to separate GAS from other types of ECA, including clear cell-
type.

High-risk Human Papillomavirus detection in formalin-fixed paraf-
fin-embedded cervical tissues: performances of Aptima HPV assay
and Beckton Dickinson (BD) onclarity assay
G. Kir*, H. Gunel, Z.C. Olgun, W.G. McCluggage
*Istanbul Medeniyet University, Turkey
Background & objectives: There are many scenarios where high-risk
HPV (hrHPV) detection in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE)
specimens are important. However, there is no Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved and clinically validated technique for
detecting hrHPV in FFPE tissues.
Methods: We evaluated two commercially available HPV assays which
are FDA approved for use on cytology specimens, the Aptima HPV assay
and the BD Onclarity assay, to detect hrHPV in FFPE tissues of cervical
HSIL and SCC. A total of 189 cases were tested for hrHPV with the
Aptima HPV assay and a subset of cases(n=97) with the BD Onclarity
assay.
Results: The sensitivities of the Aptima and BD Onclarity HPV assays
were 99.4% (95%CI:96.46%–99.98%) and 75.9% (95%CI:65.27%–
84.62%), respectively; the specificity and positive predictive value of
the two assays were 100%. Negative predictive values of the Aptima
and BD Onclarity HPV assays were 97.3% (95%CI:83.61%–99.61%)
and 67.7% (95%CI:58.91%–75.47%), respectively. The kappa value for
comparison of the distribution of hrHPV types between the two assays
was high(ϰ:0.96). HPV16 was the most common hrHPV type for HSIL
and SCC cases. However, SCC cases had higher percentages of HPV16
and HPV18/45 and lower percentages of other hrHPV types compared to
HSIL cases.
Conclusion: Both assays are reliable methods for high-risk HPV detec-
tion and genotype determination in FFPE specimens, with high PPV and
specificity. The Aptima HPV assay has the advantage of higher sensitiv-
ity. As far as we are aware, this is the first study comparing the Aptima
HPV assay and the BD Onclarity assay in FFPE tissues. Our study results
should be tested and confirmed in larger cohorts.

*Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge-Idibell, Hospitalet de Llobregat,
Spain
Background & objectives: Endometrial carcinomas (ECs) harbouring
POLE mutations have been associated with an excellent prognosis, al-
though recurrent and metastatic cases have been described.
Methods: 41 POLE- mutated ECs were selected from our archives
(2000-2021). The following clinicopathologic criteria were evaluated:
histotype, grade, intratumoral heterogeneity (IH), serous-like (SA) and
clear cell-like areas (CCA), the presence of bizarre nuclei (BN), tumour
infiltrating-lymphocytes (TILs), peritumoral lymphocytes, MELF-type
invasion (MELF), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), MMR protein and
p53 expression, FIGO stage, adjuvant treatment, recurrence and status.
Virchows Arch
Results: Median age was 60.4 years. 31 patients were FIGO I-II and 10
FIGO III-IV stage. Median follow-up was 64 months. 36 patients are
alive (35 without disease, 1 with disease), 2 died from disease (DFD)
and 3 from unrelated causes.
35 cases were endometrioid carcinomas (EECs): 28 G3, 5 G1, 2 G2; 2
mixed carcinomas and 4 carcinosarcomas. 20 tumours showed IH, 4
CCA, 9 SA, 20 BN. 22 had LVI and 3 MELF. TILs were frequent.
8 cases were MMR-deficient, 7 p53-abnormal and 1 a multiple-classifier.
The most frequent pathogenic POLE mutations were: 26 V411L, 16
P286R and 4 A456P. The 2 patients who DFD showed non-pathogenic
mutations.
Conclusion: POLE-mutated ECs are typically high grade EECs in which
IH, increased TILs and BN are frequently observed. Abnormal p53 expres-
sion and/or loss of MMR protein expression in high grade tumours, does not
exclude POLE mutations. Patients with pathogenic POLE mutations have a
favourable prognosis, despite presenting advanced stage at diagnosis.

E. Bariani*, E. Piazzola, C. Di Pace, A. Caliò
*Department of Diagnostic and Public Health, Section of Pathology,
University of Verona, Italy
Background & objectives: Fumarate hydratase (FH)-deficient
leiomyoma is a distinct subtype of uterine leiomyoma occurring in spo-
radic and syndromic settings. Published studies reported a characteristic
morphology although its sensitivity remains questionable.
Methods: 1298 uterine samples (biopsy and surgical specimens) were
retrospectively found from a single academic institution's pathology da-
tabase between January 2018 and December 2020 identifying sixteen
FH-deficient leiomyomas in 14 women (1.08% of all samples; 1.2% of
surgical specimens). We evaluated clinical and histological characteristics
(evaluated from 1 to 8 slides per tumour, median=3), collecting data on
cytological and architectural features.
Results: Median age was 43 years (from 29 to 54), most nullipa-
rous(8/14). The average tumour size was 8 cm(from 0.7 to 12). In 9
patients, conventional leiomyomas were associated. None reported a fam-
ily or personal history of hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carci-
noma syndrome. All patients were alive without disease. Grossly, 13
tumours were white whorled (two tumours were yellowish, one was
spongy). Morphologically, the tumours were cellular(2), epithelioid(1),
with remarkable bizarre nuclei(1), micro-macrocystic(2). Staghorn-
shaped vessels were seen in 10, thick-wall vessels in 5, multiple micro-
vessels in 6 tumours, frequently in combination. Only one tumour
displayed an unremarkable vascular pattern. Prominent nucleoli were
easily encountered in 5 tumours, in the remaining cases were pinpoint.
Other focal features observed were palisading arrangement(3), inflamma-
tory infiltrate(5), nuclear pseudo-inclusions(5), scattered eosinophilic cy-
toplasmic globules(10). Necrosis was absent in all cases.
Conclusion: Morphological distinct features of FH-deficient were ob-
served in 6 tumours (37%). Most of the tumours resemble conventional
leiomyomas at low magnification with focal and subtle histological fea-
tures of FH-deficiency. The vascular pattern (staghorn-shaped, thick-
wall, and micro-vessels) is the most reliable finding.

Investigation of progestin-induced changes in the endometrial tran-
scriptome: Implications for personalized medicine in low-grade en-
dometrial neoplastic lesions
B. Djordjevic*, E. Olkhov-Mitsel, J. Mirkovic, Y. Amemiya, A. Seth
*Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Canada
Background & objectives: Mechanisms underlying resistance to pro-
gestin therapy in endometrial carcinoma (EC) are poorly understood. In
this study, we characterized progestin-induced transcriptomic changes in
neoplastic and non-neoplastic endometrium to distinguish physiological
effects of progestin from predictive biomarkers unique to lesional treat-
ment response.
Methods: We have previously examined the transcriptomic profile of
low-grade endometrial neoplastic lesions (LGENLs) – atypical hyperpla-
sias and FIGO grade1 ECs - that exhibited complete response (CR) to
progestin therapy. In this study, Pre- and post- progestin treated biopsy
samples of 4 patients with disordered proliferative and 4 with proliferative
phase endometrium underwent whole transcriptome RNA sequencing of
>20,000 human genes.
Results: Unsupervised analysis separated pre- and post-treatment non-neo-
plastic endometrium into 2 distinct clusters. Supervised analyses identified
2572 differentially expressed genes (P≤0.05, fold change≥2), which represent
a molecular signature of progestin effect. Of these, 391 (15%) also exhibited
progestin-induced changes in expression in CR LGENLs. Next, our analysis
focused on 73 progesterone-related pathway genes. Interestingly, comparing
the expression of these genes between non-neoplastic endometrium and
LGENLs post-treatment identified only 1 common gene, FOXO1, a known
marker of progestin response. Further, we found progestin-induced changes
in expression of PTN were unique to CR LGENLs while changes in FOS,
ADM, PIK3R3, PGR, PTGER2, CD38, TYMS, TLR2 and DSG2 expression
were unique to non-neoplastic lesions.
Conclusion: Non-neoplastic endometrium exhibits a much wider spec-
trum of DEGs than CR LGENLs, both globally and when focusing on
progesterone pathway genes, suggesting progestin response may be al-
ready impaired in LGENLs. Next, comparative analysis of transcriptomic
features that would differentiate non-neoplastic endometrium, CR and
non-responder LGENLs sampled prior to progestin therapy will be per-
formed to search for predictive biomarkers.

Institute for Cancer Research through funding provided by the

PD-L1 expression and mismatch repair status in endocervical clear
cell carcinomas
P. Bulutay*, N. Haberal, Ö. Özen, N. Kapucuoğlu
*Istanbul, Koç University Hospital, Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Endocervical clear cell carcinoma (cCCC) is
a rare tumour and resistant to conventional chemotherapy. PD-L1-
expression is used as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy.
Mismatch-repair-deficiency is associated with the immunotherapy re-
sponse. We evaluated PD-L1 expression and mismatch repair status in
cCCCs.
Methods: Immunohistochemical staining for PD-L1 (SP263 clone) ex-
pression was performed on a tissue microarray of 14 cCCC cases (6 mm
diameter two tissue cores from each case). Expression was scored in both
the tumour and tumour-infiltrating immune cells as follows; negative
(<1%), low (1-4%), intermediate (5-50%), and extensive (>50%) stain-
ing. Furthermore, tumoral mismatch repair status (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6,
PMS1) was evaluated.
Results: PD-L1 expression, either tumoral or tumour-infiltrating immune
cells, was present in 71.4% (10/14) of cCCCs. Most of the positive cases
showed PD-L1 expression in ≤50% (8/10) of the tumoral cells. Almost all
cases were accompanied by intermediate or low-level immune cell infil-
tration. PD-L1 expression in immune cells was present in 61.5% (8/13) of
the cases. Extensive PD-L1 expression was seen in 2 cases. They also had
mismatch repair deficiency (MSH2 loss, MLH1-PMS2 loss). Overall
mismatch repair deficiency was seen in 35.7% (5/14) of the cases. PD-
L1 expression was observed at all mismatch repair deficient cases except
one (4/5). However, 60% of the PD-L1 positive cases were remained
mismatch repair intact.
Virchows Arch
Conclusion: The prevalence in endocervical CCC is still
underinvestigated. We evaluated PD-L1 expression in 14 endocervical
CCCs and correlated with the mismatch repair status. We herein demon-
strate that some degree of tumoral and peritumoral immune cell PD-L1
expression is present in endocervical CCCs. This finding suggests a role
for further investigation of anti-PD-L1/PD-1 immunotherapies in the
treatment of PD-L1-positive cCCCs. Moreover, mismatch repair defi-
ciency may support this finding. Further studies in larger series are need-
ed to confirm our findings.

Lynch Syndrome screening algorithm in endometrial carcinoma can
be improved
C. Bartosch*, B. Oliveira, J. Costa, P. Lopes, C. Santos, A. Peixoto, C.
Pinto, C. Jeronimo
*Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto (IPO-P), Portugal
Background & objectives: Lynch syndrome(LS) screening in endome-
trial carcinoma(EC) starts with mismatch repair protein(MMR)
immunoexpression, followed by MLH1 methylation in ECs showing
MLH1/PMS2 expression loss. We aim to identify points of improvement
in LS screening algorithm, focusing on MMR immunoexpression pat-
terns and second allele MLH1 methylation.
Methods: All consecutive patients diagnosed with EC showing altered
MLH1 protein expression were selected (2009-2020, n=55). Clinical files
and immunohistochemistry slides were reviewed. DNA was extracted
from FFPE samples, and subjected both to bisulfite modification followed
by amplification by quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP), and
to Methylation-Specific Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe
Amplification (MS-MLPA).
Results: We were able to distinguish three MLH1 methylation groups:
the first, with patients whose tumours do not have methylation in any
alleles (n=20), the second with patients whose tumours had partial meth-
ylation (n=14), most probably in only one allele, and lastly, patients
whose tumour had methylation in both alleles (n=21). The vast majority
of patients that proceeded to germline testing belong to the first group,
and patients on the other groups were rarely tested.
Immunohistochemistry study showed that MLH1 expression can be
completely lost (n=44) but also presented as subclonal loss (n=6) and
decreased immunoexpression (n=5). All these patterns of
immunoexpression can be associated with LS.
Conclusion: LS screening in EC patients is highly dependent of immu-
nohistochemistry and MLH1 methylation results. All altered immunohis-
tochemistry patterns should be taken into account. Patients with partial
MLH1 methylation, most probably have only one methylated allele, as a
putative second hit, and thus may be considered for LS germline testing.
By including these patients in LS screening, we expect a small increase in
the number of patients diagnosed with LS; but importantly, identifying a
patient with LS, means identifying a family with LS.

*FSBI "National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynecology
and Perinatology after V.I. Kulakov" Ministry of Healthcare Russian
Federation, Russia
Background & objectives: The aim of the study was to conduct a retro-
spective comparative analysis of the cytological and histological diagno-
ses in women with cervical pathology associated with the human papil-
lomavirus (HPV).
Methods: A retrospective review was conducted for cervical biopsies
with their corresponding liquid-based cervical smears (SurePath) over a
2-year period (2018-2019). According to ASC guidelines, a discrepancy
assessment grid was prepared. Major cytology-histology discordance was
defined as a diagnosis of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion
(HSIL) or CIN2+ in one of the tests with negative result in the other.
Results: We analysed 3 groups based on the results of studies: the 1st
group included patients with complete coincidence of cytological and his-
tological diagnoses. The 2nd group - minor discrepancies, the 3rd group -
significant discrepancies. Of the 415 cervical biopsies with corresponding
Papanicolaou liquid-based smear, cytology-histology agreement was noted
in 194 (46.74%). Major discordance was observed in 29 cases (6.9%),
while 4.8% cases of cytological result "NILM" corresponded to the histo-
logical diagnosis of HSIL, and 2.1% of cases with a cytological findings of
HSIL, a histological findings was diagnosed with "benign" (chronic cervi-
citis). The minor discrepancies was 192 (46%).
Conclusion: We suppose that ASC guideline helps to standardise the con-
duct of cervical cytology-histology correlation internationally. Our compara-
tive analysis showed that in all groups there were cases of underdiagnosis and
overdiagnosis in cytological examination, however, there were few observa-
tions in which management of the treatment changed significantly due to
different cytological and histological diagnoses (6.9%).

Malignant mixed ovarian germ cell tumours: a 9 years’ experience
from a tertiary referral centre
I. Arora*, N. Sarwar, M. Seckl, B. Kaur
*Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Malignant mixed germ cell tumours
(MMGCT) of the ovary are relatively rare neoplasms accounting for less
than 5% of all ovarian cancers. We evaluated the incidence, clinico-
pathological characteristics, clinical outcome of MMGCT at our centre
and reviewed the existing literature.
Methods: Twenty-three cases of MMGCT were identified among 996 cases
of germ cell tumours (GCT) treated at our institute from 2012 -2020. Clinical
data including demographics, stage, type of surgery, chemotherapy regimens,
tumour marker levels, menstrual functions, fertility, and outcome were col-
lected for each patient from medical records and pathology reports.
Results: Ovarian MMGCT accounted for 2.3% of all GCT. Median age
was 27 years (range, 17-42). Most common presenting symptoms were
abdominal mass and pain (81%). Average tumour size was 16 cm (range,
6.8-30). Majority were stage I-II tumours (81%). Most frequent histolog-
ical combination was yolk sac tumour and immature teratoma seen in 12
patients (52%). Seventeen (74%) patients underwent complete surgical
staging. Fifteen (65%) received post-operative chemotherapy. Only one
patient received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. During a median follow-up
period of 32.4 months, 2 patients had recurrence. Eleven patients (61%)
developed chemotherapy complications. Median overall survival was
28.2 months. No adverse prognostic variables were identified, and 90%
patients had good overall survival.
Conclusion: MMGCT are rare tumours affecting adolescent females of
reproductive age, therefore fertility preservation and long-term survival is
extremely important. Majority of these tumours are diagnosed at an early
stage, have a good response to the standard treatment regimens and a
good clinical outcome. However, due to the rarity of the disease, there is
a clear need for more studies to better identify prognostic factors that will
further improve the clinical outcome of patients with advanced/relapsed
disease.

Association between immunohistochemistry in endometrial hystero-
scopic biopsies and pregnancy within six months

*Grupo Fleury, Brazil
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Chronic endometritis is a common disease
associated with infertility. Although the histopathological and immu-
nohistochemical evaluation are considered essential for its diagnosis,
the diagnostic criteria or sampling recommendations are not yet
defined.
Methods: This was a retrospective cohort evaluating women with infer-
tility submitted to hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy in the Fleury
Group, in Brazil, from 2012-2020. Variables of interest included: size of
the biopsy specimen, presence, and quantification of CD56- and CD138-
positive cells in the endometrial stroma, and evidence of pregnancy
within six months from the biopsy (assessed either by β-HCG or pelvic
ultrasound).
Results: We included 696 patients, with median age of 37-years and
median biopsy size of 5mm. CD56-positive and CD138-positive cells
were detected in 97.7% and 26.7% of the samples, respectively.
Samples with CD138-positive cells presented a higher quantification
of CD56-positive cells in the stroma (median[25th-75th percentiles]:
20%[14.25-25%] vs. 15%[10-25%]; p:0.013). Pregnancy testing was
performed in 202 patients, with positive results in 112. Patients with
positive testing presented more frequently CD138-positive cells in
the endometrial stroma (32.1% vs. 17.8%, p:0.020). Finally, a mul-
tivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of CD138-positive
cells was an independent predictive factor for pregnancy (p:0.018),
controlled by the phases of the endometrial cycle, CD56-positivity,
or size of the biopsy.
Conclusion: We found that the presence of CD138-positive cells was
associated with pregnancy within six months, regardless of the biopsy
size, indicating the impact of endometritis assessment even in hystero-
scopic biopsies.

*King Hussein Cancer Center, Jordan
Background & objectives: Many promising clinical trials of anti–PD-1/
PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies for endometrial cancer are ongoing.
Patients with endometrial carcinomas that express PD-L1 may respond
better to immunotherapy. Our aim was to investigate the differential char-
acteristics of PD-L1–positive endometrial carcinomas.
Methods: We reviewed records of patients with endometrial carci-
nomas who were managed at the King Hussein Cancer Center
(2007–2016) and performed immunohistochemistry for MLH1,
PMS2, MSH2, MSH6, p53, and PD-L1. We stratified patients ac-
cording to tumoral PD-L1 expression (< 1% or ≥1%), described the
clinical and tumoral characteristics of the strata, and tested associa-
tions using Pearson’s χ2 test.
Results: We included 231 women. According to Bokhman’s classification,
156 tumours (67.5%) were type I and 75 (32.5%) were type II. Of 156
endometrioid carcinomas, 52 (33.3%) were FIGO grade I, 83 (53.2%) were
grade II, and 21 (13.5%) were grade III. Overall, 89 cases (38.5%) were
MMR-deficient. PD-L1 was expressed in 49 cases (21.2%) and was associ-
ated with MLH1/PMS2 deficiency (p = 0.044) but not MSH2/MSH6 defi-
ciency (p = 0.59). p53 was mutant in 106 cases (46.5%) and mutation was
associated with MMR proficiency (p < 0.001) but not PD-L1 expression (p =
0.78). In patients with endometrioid carcinomas, PD-L1 expression was as-
sociated with FIGO grade (p = 0.008).
Conclusion: In conclusion, tumours with MLH1/PMS2 loss and high-
grade endometrial carcinomas were more likely to express PD-L1 in
tumour cells. The presence of either characteristic may signal a higher
likelihood of a favourable response should immunotherapy be
administered.

Clinicopathological implications of RHOA mutations
in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma: a meta-analysis
T. Ngo*, P. Nguyen, N. Tran, T. Nguyen, D. Lai, H. Vuong
*Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine, Vietnam
Background & objectives: Studies have shown that RHOA mutations
play a crucial role in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) path-
ogenesis. We aimed to pool data from these studies to compare clinico-
pathological features between the RHOA mutant and RHOA wild-type
groups in the AITL population.
Methods: We searched PubMed and Web of Science for the keywords
"RHOA AND lymphoma" and selected only studies reporting the clinical
significance of RHOA mutations in AITL. We calculated the odds ratios
(OR) or the mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CI), using a
random-effect model.
Results: Our pooled results showed a significant association between
RHOA mutations and a T-follicular helper cell (TFH) phenotype, espe-
cially CD10 (OR=5.16; 95% CI: 2.32-11.46), IDH2 mutations
(OR=10.70; 95% CI: 4.22 - 27.15), and TET2 mutations (OR=7.03;
95% CI: 2.14 - 23.12). Although DNMT3A together with TET2 and
IDH2 mutations are epigenetic gene alterations, we found an insignificant
association between RHOA and DNMT3A mutations (OR=1.72; 95%
CI: 0.73 - 4.05). No significant associations of RHOA mutations with
other clinicopathological features and overall survival were found.
Conclusion: RHOA mutations are strongly correlated with a TFH phe-
notype and epigenetic mutations such as TET2 and IDH2. Further studies
with large AITL samples should be conducted to validate the relationship
of TET2, DNMT3A, and RHOA co-mutations.

Clinicopathologic study of mantle cell lymphoma with EBV infection
X. Li*, Y. Li
*Chongqing University Cancer Hospital, China
Background & objectives: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) with EB virus
(EBV) infectionare rarely reported. Herein, we report the largest series of
analyses of the prevalence and clinicopathological features of mantle cell
lymphoma with EBV infection.
Methods: 138cases of MCL diagnosed in the first affiliated Hospital of
Chongqing Medical University and Chongqing University Cancer
Hospital from January 2014 to November 2019 were collected retrospec-
tively. Cases with EBV infection were screened by EBER ISH, then
double labelling of EBER(ISH) and CD79α(IHC) was performed, clini-
cal and pathological data were analysed.
Results: EBER ISH showed that there were 8 cases of MCL with EBV
infection (the infection rate was 5.8%), and all of them were non-neoplastic
bystander cells with positive EBV and there was no expression of LMP1
and EBNA2. All MCL with EBV infection have no abnormal immune
function and without other lymphomas, and their histopathological mor-
phology showed classic MCL. MCL with EBV infection and MCL without
EBV infection have statistically significant differences in LDH, anaemia
status, and MIPI grouping (P=0.008; P=0.02; P=0.001; P=0.011). The
differences were not statistically significant between two groups in age,
sex ratio, clinical manifestations and immunohistochemical phenotypes.
Conclusion: The incidence of MCL with EBV infection is low, and its
clinicopathological features are similar to those of MCL without EBV
infection. This study shows that the cells infected by EBV in MCL are
background cells rather than tumour cells, which is different from previ-
ous studies, indicating that tumour cells in MCL may not prone to EBV
infection.

Lymph node biopsies of primary immunodeficiency disorders: our
experience in a tertiary hospital
E. Garcia Fernandez*, P. Puente Lopez, G. Olmedilla Arregui, A. Robles
Marhuenda, E. Lopez Granados
*La Paz University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: There are more than 100 primary immuno-
deficiency disorders, our aim was to review the lymph node biopsies
diagnosed since 2016. We collected all the clinical information from
our database, molecular, immunohistochemistry studies and reviewed
all the slides from each case.
Methods: We found nine patients, 6 women and 3 men. Five cases had
variable common immunodeficiency (VCI), with a mean age of 43 (37-60
years-old). The other 4 cases were a Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CH); an
autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), a PI3K primary im-
munodeficiency and a humoral immunodeficiency not yet defined. These
cases were all children with ages from 2 to 12.
Results: At the lymph node biopsy the VCI cases had two type of pat-
terns, 3 cases had non-necrotizing granulomas and 2 cases follicular hy-
perplasia with ill-defined germinal centres. 1 patient had a TCR clone
with no histology of lymphoma.
The patient with CH had a T cell atypical population with a TCR clone.
She had a bone marrow transplant to treat her immunodeficiency. The
case of ALPS had an increase of doble negative T cell lymphocytes, the
PI3K had a follicular hyperplasia positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
and cytomegalovirus. The last case was diagnosed of lymphoproliferative
disorder EBV associated, clonal for IgH and was treated with Rituximab.
Conclusion: We present a series of cases of primary immunodeficiency
disorders, with a variable and complex histology. Of the nine patients
only 1 patient was diagnosed as a B cell lymphoma. To diagnose, treat
and follow up these patients it´s necessary to have a multidisciplinary
group of physicians like at our centre.

Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease - differential diagnosis
based on histopathological features
L. Rodríguez Merino*, I. Hernández Alconchel, S. Montes Moreno
*Servicio de Anatomia Patologica, Laboratorio de Hematopatologia
Traslacional, HUMV/IDIVAL, Spain
Background & objectives: International Consensus Diagnostic Criteria
for iMCD include lymph node Castleman Disease histopathological fea-
tures as major criteria. Our aim was apply those criteria in a series of 27
cases with a previous pathological diagnosis of Plasma Cell type
Castleman Disease (CD).
Methods: A retrospective series of 7 cases was analysed. Clinical and
laboratory criteria were collected and histopathological features (germinal
centre hyperplasia/regression, plasmacytosis, hypervascularity and follic-
ular dendritic cell prominence) were graded in the available lymph node
samples. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against CD20, CD3,
CD138, HHV-8, Ig isotype (IgG, IgG4, IgA, IgM, IgD), kappa, lambda
was performed in all cases.
Results: 15 out of 27 (55%) cases were HHV-8+, 7 /26%) plasma cell
neoplasia (PCN)/POEMS-related CD and 5 (19%) were iMCD. The iMCD
cases showed more frequently reactive germinal centres whereas the HHV-
8+ showed higher degree of hypervascularization. Clusters of IgM+lamb-
da+ cells were identified in all HHV-8+ cases. Lambda plasma cells were
identified in 3 out of 7 cases (43%) of PCN/POEMS-related CD. All 5
cases of iMCD were IgG+ and polytypic. The median number of IgG4+
cells was 14. 5 out of 23 cases (22%) had 30 or more IgG4 positive cells but
none had >100 IgG4+ cells. The IgG4/IgG ratio was below 0.4 in all cases.
Conclusion: HHV-8 CD and PCN/POEMS-related CD are the major
mimickers of iMCD in lymph node biopsies with plasma cell type CD
features. High grade of plasmocytosis is a common feature but the
presence of reactive germinal centres may support a diagnosis of
iMCD. Monotypic plasma cells are found in only 43% of PCN/POEMS
related cases. A dim increase in IgG4+ plasma cells is found occasionally
in CD but neither the histopathology nor the IgG4/IgG ratio fit with IgG4
related disease criteria.

Mandibular invasion in OSCC is associated with osteoclast count
and expression of its regulating proteins
W. de Kort*, W. Haakma, R. van Es, E. Driehuis, M. Gansevoort, S.
Willems
*Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University Medical
Center Groningen, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Oral squamous cell carcinoma(OSCC) fre-
quently invades the mandible. Osteoclast activation via RANKL/OPG/
RANK plays an important role in bone-invasion. The exact mechanism of
bone-invasion remains unclear. We elucidate the role of osteoclasts and
RANKL/OPG/RANK in the development of bone-invasion in OSCC.
Methods: OSCC-patients treated with resection were included and divid-
ed in three groups; Non-invasion (NI-group), erosion (E-group) and
bone-invasion (I-group). Tissue sections were stained with CathepsineK
(for counting osteoclasts), RANKL, OPG and RANK. Staining intensity
was scored in tumour-front, tumour-center, backside of tumour and nor-
mal mucosa. A qPCR was executed for RANKL, OPG and RANK in five
head and neck SCC organoids.
Results: The mean number of osteoclasts in CathepsinK stained sections
was 3.09 in the NI-group, 6.15 in the E-group and 10.58 in the I-group.
Compared to normal mucosa, the expression in all tumour regions was
higher for RANKL, in most of tumour regions for OPG and not higher for
RANK.
RANKL-expression in the tumour-front was higher than expression in the
backside of the tumour in the I-group. RANK-expression in the tumour-
front and the tumour-center was higher than expression in the backside of
the tumour in all groups.
qPCR showed a 20-35x higher RANKL expression in 3 out of 5 tumour
organoid samples compared to a normal squamous cell organoid line.
Conclusion: The number of osteoclasts and their regulating proteins
(RANK, RANKL and OPG) differ between OSCC patients with and
without bone-invasion. Our data suggest that tumour cells induce bone-
invasion in OSCC patients by stimulating osteoclast activation by regu-
lating the production of RANK, RANKL, and OPG proteins.

*First Department of Pathology, Medical School, National and
Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece, Greece
Background & objectives: Salivary gland tumours (SGTs) encompass
benign to highly malignant entities. The human PROX-1 gene belonging
to the homeobox transcription factor family, exerts lymphangiogenic,
angiogenic and possibly carcinogenic properties. The clinical significance
of PROX-1 expression was examined in SGTs.
Methods: PROX-1 protein expression was assessed immuno-
histochemically in 48 formalin fixed, paraffin embedded SGT tissue spec-
imens (30 benign and 18 malignant). PROX-1 positivity was correlated
with benign and malignant state, other clinicopathological parameters and
patients’ survival in malignant SGTs.
Virchows Arch
Results: PROX-1 positive immunohistochemical expression (nuclear,
cytoplasmic or nuclear and cytoplasmic) was noted in 27 out of 30
(90%) benign and 11 out of 18 (61%) malignant SGT cases, respectively.
PROX-1 positivity and cytoplasmic pattern of staining was more frequent-
ly noted in benign versus malignant SGT cases (p=0.017 and 0.05, respec-
tively). On the other hand, PROX-1 positivity in malignant SGT cases was
correlated with low grade of differentiation (p=0.048). The cytoplasmic
pattern of PROX-1 immunostaining was also linked to high histological
grade, although non-significantly (p=0.056). In malignant SGT cases, a
correlation between PROX-1 positivity and poor overall patients’ survival,
at a non-significant level though, was noted (p=0.084).
Conclusion: Our results suggest a link between PROX-1 expression and
carcinogenesis in the salivary glands, designating it as a possible diag-
nostic and prognostic biomarker. In addition, suppression of lymph- and
angiogenesis through PROX-1 targeting should be of great importance as
a potential future therapeutic strategy in malignant SGTs.

Iwai, S. Yamanaka, T. Daa, J. Fukuoka, M. Yasuda, H. Sugimura
*Department of Pathology, Shizuoka General Hospital, Japan
Background & objectives: Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) has several
histological subtypes. We established “SDC with rhabdoid features
(SDCRF)” as a new entity, and it showed no or aberrant expression of
cell-cell adhesion molecules. We aim to elucidate the clinicopathological
features of SDCRF.
Methods: We collected 417 cases of SDC as Japanese cohort, and ex-
tracted the cases with rhabdoid features(RF). We immunostained sections
for AR, HER2, EGFR, CK5/6, Ki-67, E-cadherin and beta-catenin, and
also examined CDH1 gene, genetically. According to Takase classifica-
tion, we subclassified into apocrine A, apocrine B, apocrine-HER2,
HER2-enriched, and double-negative subtypes. We analysed the out-
comes of SDCRF, compared with conventional SDC.
Results: Nineteen cases of SDCRF (4.6%) were extracted from our co-
hort. The mean age was 67-year-old (range; 36~86-year-old) with male
predilection. The primary site was mainly parotid gland (14 cases).
pStage 0-I, II, III, and IV were 3, 1, 2, and 11 cases, respectively. Eight
cases died of disease, whereas 8 cases harboured distant metastases re-
lapse. One, 11, 5, and 2 case belonged to apocrine A, apocrine B, apo-
crine-HER2, and HER2-enriched subtype, respectively. No or aberrant
expression of E-cadherin//beta-catenin were observed in 12//9 cases or 4//
7 cases, respectively. All cases never showed co-expression of
cytokeratin and vimentin. One nonsense mutation, six missense muta-
tions and one insertion were detected in CDH1 gene.
Conclusion: SDCRF was previously diagnosed as “poorly differentiated”
SDC, but all cases showed the common histology with RF. From no co-
expressionfor cytokeratinandvimentin, theywere not "true" rhabdoidcells.
SDCRFharbourednon-/less-cohesivecell-celladhesion.Therefore,SDCRF
indicated distant metastases relapse (8/19) rather than loco-regional relapse
(2/19). Although the proportion of the molecular subtypes of SDCRF were
not so different from that of conventional SDC, SDCRF indicated worse
outcomes than the latter, due to frequently distant metastases relapse.

Clinicopathological and genetic analyses of sinonasal gloman-
giopericytoma (SN-GAP): multi-institutional retrospective study on
beta-catenin and CTNNB1 gene
K. Kusafuka*, S. Baba, M. Nagase, J. Itakura, Y. Otsuki, H. Takahashi,
S. Yamanaka, M. Hamada, M. Yasuda, T. Iwasaki, M. Suzuki
*Department of Pathology, Shizuoka General Hospital, Japan
Background & objectives: Sinonasal glomangiopericytoma (SN-GAP)
was previously called “hemangiopericytoma (HPC)”, “solitary fibrous
tumour (SFT)”, or "glomus tumour (GT)" of the sinonasal cavity. This
tumour is very rare but an independent entity. We aim to elucidate the
clinicopathological and genetic features of SN-GAP.
Methods: We collected “GAP”, “HPC”, “SFT” and "GT" cases from a
pathology file of our institutions during 2000-2020 and from a set of
consultation files (K.K.), and re-estimated them, histologically and
immunohistochemically. Some cases were examined genetically for
CTNNB1 gene, using PCR-direct sequencing method. We compared
SN-GAP with other sinonasal spindle cell neoplasms, such as SFT or GT.
Results: Four cases were re-diagnosed as “SN-GAP”, with female pre-
dilection. Histologically, the tumours consisted of compactly fascicular
proliferation of short spindle-shaped myoid cells with mild atypia and
often showed perivascular growth pattern with staghorn-like blood ves-
sels. There was no evidence of necrosis nor anaplasia.
Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells were positive for vimentin,
alpha-smooth muscle actin, BCL-2, factor XIIIa and cyclin D1, but neg-
ative for cytokeratin, desmin, CD34, STAT6, and S-100 protein. Ki-67
labelling index was approximately 2-13%. The nuclear localization of
beta-catenin was observed in all cases. All cases, which could be exam-
ined, indicated the missense mutations [codon110C>G(p.Ser37Cys);
codon121A>G(p.Thr41Ala)] in exon 3 of CTNNB1gene. The outcome
was good in SN-GAP cases.
Conclusion: SN-GAP indicated the nuclear localization of beta-catenin,
and it was induced from the missense mutation in exon 3 of CTNNB1
gene, which codes beta-catenin. The combination of the immunostaining
for beta-catenin and the molecular examination for CTNNB1 gene muta-
tion are very specific and useful for differential diagnosis of SN-GAP
from other spindle cell neoplasms of sinonasal cavity; especially,
monophasic fibrous synovial sarcoma, GT, SFT, low-grade
myofibroblastic sarcoma and biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma.

Dyshormonogenetic goiter: a study of 4 cases
A. Bchir*, S. Mestiri, M. Belakhadher, T. Tlili, S. Chaieb, N.
Abdessayed, B. Sriha, M. Mokni
*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Dyshormonogenetic goiter (DG) is a rare
inherited disease. It is a thyroid enlargement due to defects in thyroid
hormones synthesis. The aim of our study is to highlight the clinico-
pathological characteristics of dyshormonogenetic goiter.
Methods: We describe 4 patients with dyshormonogenetic goiter. Data
were obtained from the files of Ear Nose Throat Department and
Pathology Department of Farhat Hached Hospital of Sousse, Tunisia.
Results: There were 2 male and 2 female patients. The average age was
16 years. Consanguinity and congenital hypothyroidism has been report-
ed in all patients. Neck swelling was the complaining symptom in all
cases. On macroscopic examination, the mean size was 7 cm.
Histologically; it was a multinodular goiter without any normal thyroid
tissue. Nodules were hypercellular with a solid or microfollicular patterns.
Colloid is minimal to absent. The follicular cells exhibit marked nuclear
atypia with bizarre nuclei. These nuclear atypia is more common in
internodular tissue. The nodules are entrapped with extensive fibrosis
which can simulate malignancy. 2 patients underwent total thyroidectomy
and the 2 others had partial thyroidectomy.
Conclusion: Dyshormonogenetic goiter is an autosomal recessive dis-
ease. It is a benign thyroid hyperplasia due to hereditary defects in hor-
mone synthesis. It is the second cause of congenital hypothyroidism after
Virchows Arch
thyroid dysgenesis. This disease affects more female than male. The mean
age of patients is 16 years. Histologically, this tumour is a multinodular
goiterwith markedly cellular parenchyma and extensive internodular fi-
brosis. Rare cases of thyroid cancers related to DG have been reported.
Treatment is based on surgery and L-thyroxin.

Warthin-like mucoepidermoid carcinoma - a morphologic spectrum:
report of 3 cases with histological and cytological findings and review
of the literature
K. Basak*, C. Aydin Mericoz, P. Fırat
*University of Health Sciences, Kartal Dr.Lütfi Kırdar City Hospital,
Department of Pathology, Istanbul, Turkey
Background & objectives: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) show-
ing Warthin's Tumour (WT) like features is a low-grade malignancy
which should be differentiated from WT. Morphological features may
be distinctly different in each case causing diagnostic difficulties. Three
cases are discussed in this presentation.
Methods: One case was a 16 year-old female, the other two cases were 27
and 53 year-old males. All presented with a mass in the parotid gland
which went to parotidectomy and all had pre-operative fine needle aspi-
rations. On histopathological examination first case was initially
interpreted as WT, the other two were morphologically consistent with
low grade MEC with WT-like features.
Results: Prominent lymphoid stroma and cystic pattern was the character
of these tumours. One case had the classical WT appearance with some
mucinous and squamous metaplasia which could only be interpreted as
MEC after the detection of MAML2 rearrangement by FISH. The other
two showed either focal or relatively diffuse usual low-grade MEC find-
ings, one of these cases was also confirmed by MAML2 rearrangement.
Cytologically one case was interpreted as non-informative due to pres-
ence of cyst fluid only, one case was suggestive of WT, only one case was
found to be suspicious for MEC which contained squamous and goblet
cells on a mucoid background. Cytological and histopathological features
revealed a spectrum.
Conclusion: Differentiating WT-like MECs from ordinary WTs may be
challenging. On one end of the spectrum they may look very much like
WT, on the other end, even though usual MEC features are present, still
WT-like appearance may pose diagnostic difficulty. Showing MAML2
rearrangement in these cases is very helpful. Presence of mucinous and
squamous cells in an otherwise WT-like looking tumour should be
alarming for MEC and if possible, each case should be analysed for
MAML2 rearrangement.

Deep proteomic profiling reveals two major subgroups in the extra-
cellular matrix of salivary gland carcinomas
C. Arolt*, F. Hoffmann, L. Nachtsheim, P. Wolber, O. Guntinas-Lichius,
R. Büttner, F. von Eggeling, A. Quaas, J.P. Klußmann
*Institute of Pathology, Medical Faculty, University of Cologne,
Germany
Background & objectives: The extracellular matrix (ECM) is an integral
component of the tumour microenvironment. As the ECM composition
of salivary gland adenocarcinomas (SGC) has not yet been addressed, we
set out to discover ECM profiles and putative therapeutic targets.
Methods: Using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS),
we quantitatively analysed the ECM proteins of 25 normal tissue samples
and 89 primary SGC, encompassing the eight most prevalent tumour
types. Among a total of 6478 unique proteins, we identified 329 ECM
components which were subsequently analysed.
Results: All tumours exhibited a highly dysregulated ECM with a mean
of 166.5 differentially expressed proteins per entity. PCA and hierarchical
clustering revealed two clusters of carcinomas, either with (MYO) or
without myoepithelial differentiation (non-MYO; purity: 100%,
93.75%). To asses whether a machine learning algorithm could detect
MYO and non-MYO based on ECM expression, we trained an elastic
net model which predicted tumour differentiation with an error rate of 3%
(area-under-the-curve: 0.996). While MYO exhibited a higher fraction of
upregulated collagens and glycoproteins, non-MYO displayed a higher
fraction of upregulated secreted factors. We identified several ECM com-
ponents known to promote tumour invasion, progression and
chemoresistance, thus representing putative therapeutic targets.
Conclusion: Using machine learning tools, we demonstrate for the first
time that SGC can be categorised in two classes based on their ECM
expression. Tumours with and without myoepithelial differentiation ex-
hibit dramatic differences regarding the ECM composition. Also, using
highly sensitive proteomic profiling we identify several putative thera-
peutic targets in the ECM of SGC. Thus, our work contributes to the final
goal of a personalised therapy for SGC.

Clinicopathological correlation of transoral robotic head and neck
cancer surgery
A. Ali*, M. Kadri, M. Kiakou
*Broomfield Hospital, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) has
revolutionised head and neck cancer surgery including both diagnostic
and therapeutic work. In this study we access the correlation between the
depth of resection, volume of resection, post-operative pain level and
length of stay (LOS).
Methods: A retrospective cohort study in a Head and Neck Cancer hub.
All 26 patients included had either diagnostic or therapeutic TORS at our
unit. The procedures were performed using the Da Vinci Si Surgical
System. Histological data included: specimen dimensions and volume,
presence of malignancy, depth of tumour, depth of resection. Patient-
reported pain score was recorded.
Results: The depth of muscle resection had a positive correlation (r=0.264)
with the LOS, this was not statistically significant (p=0.224). Similarly, the
volume of resection was positively correlated to the LOS (r=0.129), this
was not significant (p=0.529). Multivariate analysis using types of proce-
dure, depth of resection and volume of resection as independent variables
showed these variables not to have significant effect on the LOS.
Conclusion: The current study’s hypothesis was that the extent (depth
and volume and resection) of oropharyngeal resection is directly propor-
tional to the level of post-operative pain. Interestingly however, our study
showed that the depth of muscle resection did not affect the post-
operative pain level. Another interesting point was a weak positive cor-
relation between the volume of resection and pain, patient who had who
had both tonsillectomy and Tongue Base Mucosectomy (largest resection
volume) reported the least pain in our cohort.

Who was Arthur Carleton Crooke? A historical research after diag-
nosing a rare tumour
C. Pontinha*, M. Varela dos Santos, M. Mafra
*Central Lisbon University Hospital Centre, Portugal
Background & objectives: 36-year-old man admitted to Emergency
Department with acute heart faillure. The MRI revealed a selar mass
Virchows Arch
and the histopathological diagnosis of Crooke cell adenoma. The main
objective of this research is to find out who first described this entity.
Methods: Bibliographic research was performed at PubMed using the
terms "Crooke cell" and "Crooke cell adenoma". Articles that most em-
phasized the original description were selected.
Results: According to Bettendorf G, it was Herbert Evans, Harvey
Cushing and Dorothy Russel who encouraged Arthur C. Crooke (1905-
1990) to study pituitary histology at the beginning of his career. Crooke's
hyaline change, first described in 1936, represents an accumulation of
microfilaments around the nucleus in corticotrophs in response to an excess
of glucocorticoids. These cells are basophilic or amphophilic, PAS positive
and show strong imunoreactivity for ACTH and CK CAM 5.2 in a
juxtanuclear pattern. Despite Crooke's scientific work in the field of pitui-
tary pathology, his obituary highlights an even bigger contribution to
Medicine: the treatment of infertility with human gonadotrophins.
Conclusion: It was A.C. Crooke, a famous British endocrinologist, who
first described 85 years ago a group of characteristic cellular alterations in
the hypophysis of patients dying of Cushing's disease. According to the
4th edition of the WHO Blue Book, Crooke cell adenoma is the official
terminology for these rare corticotrophic adenomas with these cellular
alterations (largest case series of 36).

Evolution of gastric metaplasia definition and a meaning of the phe-
nomenon in a historical perspective
M. Stepanchenko, S. Mozgovoi*, A. Kononov, E. Abrosimova
*Omsk State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: Metaplasia is the replacement of one differ-
entiated somatic cell type with another differentiated somatic cell type in
the same issue. Historically, the development of submissions about meta-
plasia (intestinal metaplasia) was accompanied by a significant meaning
modification.
Methods: Content analysis through systematic review of publications
(Embase) by using key words "stomach/gastric" AND "metaplasia" was
carried out. Marked evolutionary modification of these terms was re-
vealed to the present time. A comparative method and a substantial anal-
ysis of sources were used to clarify the meaning of this phenomenon.
Results: Basic aspects of terms modification were identified and desig-
nated: general biological approach, pathology and epidemiology based
approach, association with stem cells and genetic regulation. Each period
was associated with basic values and features of the development of
medical knowledge. Expanding on earlier discussion that metaplasias
can develop when mature cells dedifferentiate and proliferate the modern
aspects of this process is discussed about contribution of huge number of
associated factors and conditions such as UACL, pseudopyloric metapla-
sia, TFF3-associates metaplasia etc. There are numerous similarities be-
tween gastric and esophageal intestinal metaplasia,suggesting an idea that
the mechanisms would be identical.
Conclusion: The main feature of metaplasia is changing in cellular iden-
tity associated with transcription factors that inhibit and/or maintain cel-
lular characteristics. Improved surveillance of metaplasia might lead to
cancer prevention. All elements in terminology system affect each other
with the following changes of conceptual apparatus (metaplasia -
transdifferentiation - epithelial-mesenchimal transition). It means chang-
ing not only the terminology itself, but significantly affects the assess-
ment of the pathological process via modern definitions and ideas.

Tortuous vessels in a historical university museum
R. Henriques De Gouveia*, T. Ferreira, L. Carvalho
*INMLCF & FMUC & CHLO, Portugal
Background & objectives: Varicose Veins of the limbs, already referred
to in Ebers papyrus (1550 B.C.), remain a major vascular nosologic
problem. The authors intend to draw attention to the issue, using the
resources of the "Museu de Anatomia Patológica" in Coimbra.
Methods: A retrospective study of the specimens - human liquid-fixed
and dehydrated (dried), as well as wax and clay artificial models or other
type - kept in the Pathology Museum was performed, concerning varices.
Photographs of the specimens were taken and the literature was reviewed.
Results: Nine (n=9) specimens were represented: eight as liquid-fixed in
glass containers and one case corresponding to a set of black-and-white
pictures showing varices and varicose ulcers with pre-surgery and post-
saphenectomy limbs representation.
Conclusion: Venous disease with multiple risk factors (from genetic
predisposition to professional long-standing position), presents diverse
macro and microscopic abnormalities and may complicate (ulcers, haem-
orrhage, thrombosis). Throughout centuries, various therapeutic measures
were applied (from Wiseman boot, passing by saphenectomy, to modern
non-surgical approaches). Yet, it remains a serious Public Health issue,
worldwide. Historical XIXth century Museum of Anatomical Pathology
(Faculty of Medicine-University of Coimbra) fulfil pedagogic mission, as
internationally, by displaying such specimens, also included in pre-
graduated and graduated teaching programs.

Lymphoid cells with Russell's bodies in the spleen of patients died
from COVID-19
M. Bobrovskikh, A. Bobrovskikh, A. Filin*
*Voronezh State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: Lymphoid cells containing aggregated im-
munoglobulins in the form of Roussel's bodies have been described in a
wide variety of diseases. With COVID-19 infection, this cellular response
in the spleen is poorly understood, which makes this study relevant.
Methods: Autopsy material of 34 spleens from persons who died from
COVID-19 in 2020 was examined. The material was obtained from 20
men and 14 women who died between the ages of 30 and 91. The dura-
tion of the illness ranged from 3 to 23 days. The material was stained with
hematoxylin-eosin. Part of the material was stained with PAS.
Results: In the red pulp of the spleen, among the relatively rare cells of
the lymphoid series, there are few lymphoid cells with Russell's bodies.
Sometimes, with significant emptying of the red pulp, large cells with
abundant cytoplasm of the "plasmablast" type and single large lympho-
blastic cells with a bright pink cytoplasm of the "flaming" type of cells
appear in the reticular stroma. According to our data, a comparatively
similar morphological picture of changes in the spleen does not depend
on gender, age of the deceased, duration of illness, background and con-
comitant diseases (such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hepatosis, diffuse and
macrofocal postinfarction cardiosclerosis).
Conclusion: The detection of lymphoid cells with Russell's bodies in the
spleen of patients who died from COVID-19 indicates their participation in
the pathogenesis of this infection as a morphological sign of progressive
suppression of the immune system in an unfavorable course of the disease.

*Humanitas University, Pieve Emanuele, Milan, Italy; IRCCS Humanitas
Research Hospital, Rozzano, Italy
Background & objectives: VETC is metastatic mechanism that involves
vessel remodeling and invasion; endothelial covering might also act as an
immune-modulator. To investigate this possibility, we studied the VETC
related intratumoural heterogeneity of the immune infiltrate.
Methods: We identified several VETC prevalent sarcomas (n=3
alveolar_soft-part_sarcomas(ASPS), n=2 de-differentiated_
liposarcomas(DDLPS), n=2 other high-grade), to regularize the inference
we included n=5 renal-cell_carcinomas(RCC). We trained an artificial-
neural-network(ANN) to recognize VETC with CD34 immunohisto-
chemistry. With a transformation matrix we assessed leucocytes density
(automatically with CD45). We then compared VETC_positive and neg-
ative areas using a multilevel-hierarchical probabilistic model controlling
for histology and case.
Results: Within the same tumour, the areas with VETC tend to have a
higher density of leucocytes with a mean z-score of 0.07 Vs -0.24 in the
VETC_negative_areas [with a 89% Compatibility Interval (CI) from
-0.47 to 0.67 Vs -0.73 to 0.28 respectively]. This was also true across all
the different histotypes: mean z-score in ASPS of VETC_positive_areas
was 0.15 compared to -0.14 of VETC_negative_areas [CI (-0.45_0.73)
Vs (-0.70_0.39)], in DDLPS VETC_positive_areas was 0.23 compared
to -0.37 of VETC_negative_areas [CI (-0.42_0.92) Vs (-1.19_0.18)], and
in RCC VETC_positive_areas was 0.17 compared to -0.04 of
VETC_negative_areas [CI (-0.32_0.71) Vs (-0.59_0.49)].
Conclusion: VETC_positive_areas had –within the same tumour, the
same host-response (patient) and also across different histologies– con-
sistently an higher immune infiltrate. This finding will prompt an accurate
characterization that might unravel potential sensitivity to drugs targeting
the VETC and modulating the immune infiltrate. More generally, we
dissected the tumour microenvironment heterogeneity automating the
tasks of image annotation and positive cell detection, an approach that
we anticipate to be easily scalable.

The impact of level 6 synoptic reporting system on turn-around-
times in a surgical pathology laboratory of a tertiary cancer centre
S. Rane*, S. Yadav, A. Shah, B. Narahari, D. Yadav, S. Desai
*Tata Memorial Centre-ACTREC, HBNI, India
Background & objectives: TAT, a critical quality parameter in clinical
laboratories, is affected by several pre-analytical, analytical and post-
analytical processes. In this work, we highlight the importance and impact
of data-driven IT systems, automation of data-recording, report genera-
tion processes on TAT.
Methods: We compared the TAT of reports generated in a level-6 syn-
optic reporting system (SRS) with that of a free-text platform (FTS). In
SRS, organ and cancer specific forms were used with entries being made
in customised forms with selections entered by pathologists. FTS entries
were primarily by typists from paper records made by pathologists.
Results: TAT was calculated as days from sample receiving to report
finalization. The median TAT for the FTS and SRS was 11 & 8 days
respectively. The proportion of reports finalized within the defined TAT
increased from 87% for the FTS to 93% in SRS. The most significant
impact was noted in the proportion of reports finalized in 5 days (4% vs
20%), in 8 days (28% vs 50%) and 11 days (50% vs 75%) in FTS vs SRS
respectively. Cases requiring decalcification also showed similar results.
There was also reduction in number of supplementary reports issued for
errors in main reports
Conclusion: The current benefit demonstrated in our work is primarily
due to the change in the data-entry processes, automated report
generation, reduction in the errors and subsequent time spent in verifica-
tion and correction of reports. Our work shows the benefit of segregation
of data entry processes from report generation processes in addition to
reduction of paper-trail due to introduction of an elaborate data-driven
reporting platform, enhancing the quality of services provided by a clin-
ical diagnostic laboratory.

F. Mundim*, F. Pereira, A. Mendonca, G. Salome, J. Oliveira, J. Araujo,
M.C. Andrade, P. Mundim, A. Pereira
*UNIVAS/UNIFENAS, Brazil
Background & objectives: Due to the high demand, importance, and
complexity of services in pathological anatomy, digital technologies have
become fundamental for improving quality. According to the present, the
objective was to develop an application for macroscopy of the female
genital system.
Methods: The study applied in the technological production modality.
Contextualized Instructional Design was chosen. The stages of develop-
ment were: Analysis: literature review in PubMed / MEDLINE, SciELO
and LILACS, Brazilian Society of Pathology and College of American
Pathologists; Design: content production; Development: selection of
tools; Implementation: configuration of tools and construction of down-
load environment; Transition: performance of functionality tests.
Results: AP Macroscopy application presents 54 screens and 55 images,
general information related to the macroscopy sector, and information
about 11 types of macroscopic procedures of the female genital system.
All of these 11 features: a brief introduction. Then, the procedures per-
formed, on the piece/fabric (sections, handling, paintings), and macro-
scopic descriptions with options (Radio-Buttin) to issue text of the com-
plete macroscopy. Subsequently, information about which sections to be
represented will appear and make available two galleries: one with illus-
trations illustrating the anatomy of the organ and the sections to be per-
formed and the other with photos of the organs and sections from the
beginning to the end of the procedure.
Conclusion: The AP Macroscopy application was built and consisted of
technological innovation in the macroscopic practice of pathological
anatomy laboratories that aims to improve exams and optimize the ser-
vice, open-collaborative online and shareable, contributing to an accurate
microscopic diagnosis and ideal treatment for the patient.

Development of CNN-based algorithm for automatic recognition of
the layers of the wall of the stomach and colon
I. Mikhailov*, A. Khvostikov, A. Krylov, P. Malkov, N. Danilova, N.
Oleynikova
*Department of Pathology, Medical Research and Educational Center,
Lomonosov Moscow State University, Russia
Background & objectives: Determination of foci of microinvasion of
adenocarcinoma in polyps with low and high grade dysplasia is a rather
difficult task, which can be tried to solve with the help of deep learning
based methods.
Methods: We use two datasets that are developed for the purpose of
whole-slide images (WSI) segmentation and tissue type recognition:
NCT-CRC-HE-100K and PATH-DT-MSU. Our PATH-DT-MSU dataset
contains 20 H&E WSI of digestive tract tumours with pixel-level annota-
tion of 6 tissue types. We solve the segmentation problem via classification
approach, with a simple AlexNet-based CNN trained for patch
classification.
Results: The main goal for developing these algorithms is to automati-
cally recognize the layers of the wall of the stomach and colon on WSI,
namely the lamina propria, muscularis mucosa, submucosa, own muscle
Virchows Arch
layer, subserous layer, serous membrane and adjacent areas adipose tis-
sue. Since pixel-wise annotation of typical WSI is too time-consuming,
we developed the patch classification model, applying which to overlap-
ping patches results in getting coarse segmentation with reasonable accu-
racy. To adopt the model trained on NCT-CRC-HE-100K to PATH-DT-
MSU we replace the last fully-connected layer and perform fine-tuning.
The overall test accuracy of WSI classification is 0.93 on NCT-CRC-HE-
100K and 0.8 on PATH-DT-MSU.
Conclusion: Thus, we managed to develop an algorithm that detects
layers of gastric mucosa and depth of invasion of intestinal-type gastric
tumours with acceptable accuracy. The use of developed post-processing
methods of segmentation contour analysis allows to detect depth of inva-
sion in some cases of diffuse-type tumours. Also the next step is to train
deep learning algorithms to segment tubular and papillary structures, low
and high grade dysplasia, foci of invasive adenocarcinoma.

The impact of different mounting methods in the quality of whole
slide images used for digital diagnosis in pathology
D. Ferreira*, J. Vale, M. Curado, A. Polónia, C. Eloy
*IPATIMUP, Italy
Background & objectives: The quality of digital images depends on
the quality of glass slide preparations, namely of the mounting. This
study compares glass coverslip, film coverslip, and liquid coverslip
methods, to evaluate which is better for diagnosis in a digital pathol-
ogy workflow.
Methods: Eighteen tissue samples of paraffin-fixed embed tissue proc-
essed paraffin blocks were prepared. From each block, three consecutive
3um sections were made and mounted using the three mounting methods.
The slides were scanned in 3DHISTECH P1000 scanner, originally cal-
ibrated for film coverslip, and evaluated by two experienced pathologists
on digital pathology.
Results: The film and liquid coverslip methods have similar results
concerning the presence of air bubbles, air drying artifacts, tissue exposed
and staining alterations. The glass coverslip method was the one with
more air bubbles. The liquid coverslip showed more often alterations on
the digital images, but like the other two methods, was found suitable for
diagnosis. The liquid coverslip was the one that produced whole-slide
images with the lower size.
Conclusion: The tested mounting methods generated glass slide prepa-
rations suitable to produce diagnostic quality digital images. The scanner
calibration according to the mounting method may interfere with the
quality of the digital image. Mounting methodology must be considered
when adopting a digital workflow.

rapid remote cytology diagnostics
M. Botteghi*, F. Trisolini, A. Paradiso, S. Martinotti, A. Procopio
*Università Politecnica delle Marche, Italy
Background & objectives: The ability to provide early diagnosis of
female tumours has a strong impact on survival. Telemedicine is of great
utility allowing for worldwide diffusion of good level healthcare prac-
tices. WorldConnex developed an integrated model for rapid accurate
PAPtest remote diagnostics.
Methods: Women book the PAPtest on a web portal that assigns the
collection center. The sample is taken and prepared using CYTOfast+
that produces high quality low-cost thin layer preparations. Slide are
digitized, virtual slides are collected providing an AI-assissted pre-
diagnostic support. A team of remote cytologists connected via WaidX
carry out the diagnosis and send the digital report to patients.
Results: We are validating the platform under a wide range of conditions,
including prohibitive settings of resource. The ongoing trial is highlight-
ing the full satisfaction of the involved healthcare professionals. The
integrated management chain of biological, digital and remote diagnostics
components allows to manage a high quality diagnostic process with a
time-to-response of 24 hours.
Conclusion: WaidX is a versatile telemedicine platform born from
WorldConnex experience in Digital Health, devoted to provide an-
swers to the huge need of telemedicine diffusion. Our project is char-
acterized by a high level of innovation which increases efficiency and
efficacy of healthcare practices and can boost the use of telepathology
both in developed and developing countries. Innovative solutions are
integrated into each element of the system to improve and optimize
diagnostic processes.

Mapping the evidence for the WHO Classification of Tumours: a
living evidence gap map by tumour type (WCT-EVI-MAP).
S. Armon*, F. Campbell, R. Cierco, I. Cree, I. Indave
*International Agency for Research on Cancer, WHO, France
Background & objectives: Decisions for the WHO-Classification-of-
Tumours (WCT) as global reference tool should be informed by best
available evidence, minimising risk of incorporating misinformation into
clinical decision's pathway. We aim to map the evidence-base of the
WCT, identifying gaps and pockets of low-level-evidence.
Methods: The WCT-EVI-MAP project will apply a mixed-method, step-
wise approach to adapt Evidence-Gap-Map (EGM) methodology to the
WCT. Steps include -development of a framework through expert con-
sultation (e-Delphi study), -retrieving of evidence applying a living ap-
proach (continuous search for new evidence), -mapping of evidence in
Mega-maps of group of tumour types using EPPIReviewer®, and de-
scriptive analysis of WCT pre-post WCT-EVI-MAP.
Results: The resulting EGMs will describe the body of evidence for
single tumour types, by research field and evidence-level in an easy-to-
read visual representation. Mega-maps will be combined to provide an
open-access online tool with living EGMs of the WCT. Dimensions of
the map defined through the first phase of expert consensus will include
evidence on epidemiology, molecular pathology, prognosis, as defined in
the 5th edition of the WCT and three levels of evidence (low, medium and
high) as defined by the current evidence pyramid. A strict multidisciplin-
ary approach will be applied, and the results will be integrated into the
strategic planning of the WCT 6th edition.
Conclusion: The WCT-EVI-MAP will represent a ground-breaking ad-
vance for the WCT and research in the field, positively impacting cancer
diagnosis and management. The online tool will increase the
discoverability and use of studies by the WCT decision-makers, research
commissioners and stakeholders. Such long-term, positive impact has
been already observed in other specialised fields with and constitutes an
additional step towards evidence-based pathology.

SimInPath: mobile application to assess skills in pathology
E. Alcaraz-Mateos*
*Department of Pathology, Morales Meseguer University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: As an academic subject, Pathology is emi-
nently theory based, and is routinely assessed in this fashion. The objec-
tive of this project was to design a non-profit application for mobile
devices to assess competencies/practical skills in the field of Pathology.
Methods: There was an initial phase of development for the application
and a second phase for testing.
Virchows Arch
A template for evaluation was created, including the descriptors for each
stage for the following skills: macroscopic dissection, palpation of suit-
able lesions for fine needle aspiration (FNA), FNA, ultrasound-guided
FNA, punch biopsy, and microscopic diagnosis. Each item could be
evaluated using a Likert scale.
Results: A private company was hired to develop the SimInPath®
(Simulation in Pathology) application, which took 6 weeks to complete.
The Android system for mobile devices (both smartphones and tablets)
was chosen as the platform for the application and it was made available
for download through the GooglePlay platform. It was determined that
the application would be free to download, avoiding advertising content.
In order to test the application, it was used to assess a group of students by
an evaluator scoring the different tasks. The students' scores, in the form
of checklists, were available for analysis after each assessment.
Conclusion: The SimInPath® application for mobile devices to assess
practical skills in Anatomic Pathology was designed and launched.
This non-profit tool could be used to implement simulation-based medi-
cal education in medical schools or during residency, and, indeed, it could
be used in the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) assess-
ment format.
In addition, it could provide greater visibility for the practical side of
Pathology with an increase in student interest in the field.

Comparative pan-tumour analysis of a PD-L1 22C3 antibody
laboratory-developed test protocol on the BenchMark XT and PD-
L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx
G. Vainer*, G. Zatara, L. Huang, S. Nuti, K. Emancipator
*Hadassah–Hebrew University Medical Center, Israel
Background & objectives: In the current analysis, we compared our PD-
L1 22C3 antibody–based laboratory-developed test (LDT) on the
Ventana BenchMark XT platform with PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx, an
FDA-approved companion diagnostic for pembrolizumab across multiple
tumour types.
Methods: Tumour specimens from multiple tumour types were stained
with the 22C3 antibody, scored per the previously described LDT
(Neuman T. J Thorac Oncol. 2016), and compared with PD-L1 IHC
22C3 pharmDx by a trained pathologist. PD-L1 was measured by com-
bined positive score (CPS). Assay agreement was measured after deter-
mination of PD-L1 status per the LDT and PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx.
Results: Samples from 404 patients with cervical cancer (CC) (n=77),
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (n=80), head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (n=126), and urothelial carcinoma (n=121) were evaluated. Pan-
tumour intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of PD-L1 as a continuous
variable was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.94%-0.96%); Spearman correlation was 0.95.
Among patients with CC, ICC was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88%-0.95%);
Spearman correlation was 0.93. The clinical interpretation of PD-L1 status
(CPS ≥10) for CC samples using the LDT and PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx
resulted in a negative percentage agreement of 91% (95% CI, 72%-97%), a
positive percentage agreement of 100% (95% CI, 93%-100%), and an
overall percentage agreement of 97% (95% CI, 91%-99%).
Conclusion: We demonstrated that our 22C3 antibody–based LDT on
the Ventana BenchMark XT platform yielded high concordance with the
FDA-approved PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx in a pan-tumour analysis and
in patients with CC alone. These findings suggest the comparability of
PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx with an LDT based on the 22C3 antibody
across several tumour types. This analysis will be expanded to include
additional indications for inclusion in the presentation pending data avail-
ability.

Exploratory biomarker analyses from a phase 2 trial evaluating
sotorasib in patients with pre-treated KRASG12C-mutated non-
small cell lung cancer (CodeBreaK 100)
M. Schuler*, A. Italiano, B. Li, G. Dy, F. Skoulidis, T. Kato, A.
Anderson, A. Ang, G. Ngarmchamnanrith, A. Addeo, J. Wolf
*West German Cancer Center and German Cancer Consortium (DKTK),
Germany
Background & objectives: In a phase 2 study (CodeBreaK 100/
NCT03600883), sotorasib demonstrated a 37.1% objective response rate
(ORR) and median progression-free survival of 6.8 months for pretreated
patients with KRASG12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
We report efficacy by baseline biomarker subgroups.
Methods: Eligible patients (advanced KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC;
prior therapies) received oral sotorasib (once-daily 960 mg).
KRASG12C mutant allele frequency (MAF), tumour mutational burden
(TMB), and gene mutations were analysed by next-generation sequenc-
ing. PD-L1 was assessed by PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx. Correlations
between response and PD-L1, MAF, TMB or co-mutations were
analysed. Association between MAF and response was analysed by lo-
gistic regression.
Results: ORR (95% CI) by subgroup was as follows. TP53 co-mutation
status: mutant (n=84 evaluable patients) 39.3% (28.8–50.5); wild-type
(n=20) 40.0% (19.1–63.9). STK11/KEAP1 co-occurring mutation status:
mutant/mutant (n=13) 23.1% (5.0–53.8); mutant/wild-type (n=22) 50.0%
(28.2–71.8); wild-type/mutant (n=7) 14.3% (0.4–57.9); wild-type/wild-
type (n=62) 41.9% (29.5–55.2). TMB level: <10 mutations/Mb (n=69)
42.0% (30.2–54.5); ≥10 mutations/Mb (n=15) 40.0% (16.3–67.7). PD-L1
level: tumour proportion score (TPS) <1% (n=44) 47.7% (32.5–63.3);
TPS 1–49% (n=33) 39.4% (22.9–57.9); TPS ≥50% (n=9) 22.2% (2.8–
60.0). Response was independent of KRASG12C MAF: odds ratio for
each 0.10 increase in MAF was 1.11 (95% CI 0.88–1.39). OS remained
immature.
Conclusion: In these exploratory analyses of the registrational phase 2
CodeBreaK 100 trial, the clinical benefit of sotorasib in KRASG12C-
mutated NSCLC was observed across a range of patient subgroups in-
cluding patients with low PD-L1 expression level and those with co-
occurring STK11 mutation. A signal of interaction between response rate
and KEAP-1 mutations merits further study in larger populations.

Clinicopathological features of four cases of BCOR-CCNB3-positive
sarcomas
B. Rekhi*, V. Vengurlekar, O. Shetty
*Tata Memorial Hospital, India
Background & objectives: Sarcomas with BCOR genetic alterations are
included in the recent WHO classification of soft tissue and bone tu-
mours. Currently, there is a single reported study from our country on
BCOR-CCNB3-positive sarcomas. We present clinicopathological fea-
tures of 4 additional such cases.
Methods: Nine cases of undifferentiated round to spindle sarcomas were
tested for BCOR-CCNB3 fusion by reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction. All these tumours were negative for EWSR1 gene rear-
rangement and a single case, also for SS18 rearrangement, by fluores-
cence in-situ hybridization.
Results: Four tumours occurred in 3 males(13-year-old, 7-year-old, and
16-year-old) and a single female(37-year-old), in tibia, femur, temporal
Virchows Arch
region, and thigh, respectively. Histopathologically, tumours were com-
posed of round(n=4), polygonal(n=2), to spindly cells(n=2) in a myxoid
matrix(n=3) with interspersed thin-walled vessels(n=4) and focal
necrosis(n=2). Immunohistochemically, tumour cells displayed dot-like
reactivity for MIC2/CD99 (4/4), positivity for SATB2 (3/4), BCOR (2/2),
focal positivity for EMA (1/3), and negativity for desmin (0/4) and
WT1(0/3). Therapeutically, 2 patients underwent neoadjuvant chemo-
therapy (99% response and 78% response), followed by surgical resec-
tion. Two patients were offered palliative radiotherapy, in view of metas-
tasis at presentation and unresectability. Three patients developed lung
metastasis and a single patient developed local recurrence.
Conclusion: Certain morphological features, such as spindle and polyg-
onal cells, in addition to round cells, along with myxoid stroma, interven-
ing vessels; dot-like immunoreactivity for MIC2, lack of EWSR1 rear-
rangement, and intraosseous location constitute as diagnostic clues for
BCOR-CCNB3-positive sarcomas. SATB2 and BCOR are useful
immunostains for triaging such cases for BCOR-CCNB3-fusion testing.

Development of an optimised diagnostic algorithm using multiplex
immunochemistry (IHC) for excluding diagnosis of carcinoma-of-
unknown-primary-origin, based on experience from the Phase II
CUPISCO trial
C. Pauli*, X. Matias-Guiu, M. Chenard, P. Banks, N. Chalabi, G. Erb, P.
Toro, H. Moch
*University and University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland
Background & objectives: High screening failure rates observed in
CUPISCO (PMID: 33687747; NCT03498521) highlight the need to im-
prove carcinoma-of-unknown-primary-origin (CUP) diagnosis (im-
proved accuracy; shorter time to diagnosis; reduced tissue consumption).
Therefore, we intended to optimise pathology work-ups via use of
brightfield multiplexed IHC.
Methods: A panel of experts evaluated over 800 pathology work-ups
from CUPISCO according to ESMO guidelines, in order to improve the
efficiency of establishing an appropriate diagnosis of non-CUP versus
real CUP cases. On this basis we developed a systematic diagnostic al-
gorithm utilising automated brightfield multiplexed chromogen-based
IHC assays to screen a broad spectrum of markers.
Results: We defined an algorithmic system featuring up to five sequential
multiplex IHC-testing panels, each analysing five markers, that would be
suitable for routine clinical use. A general panel including cytokeratin 7,
cytokeratin 20, vimentin, synaptophysin and thyroid transcription factor 1
enables an initial broad screening approach, subsequent to haematoxylin–
eosin stain interpretation and assessments of the patient’s clinical charac-
teristics. Then, more specific panels featuring markers for gastrointesti-
nal/pancreatic, lung/kidney or breast/gynaecological cancers can be se-
lected for further, more focused analyses. The results of our feasibility
testing, as well as the potential implications for patient management and
improving CUP diagnosis, will be presented.
Conclusion: The proposed methodology may improve the detection of
primary cancers in complex cases: avoiding the incorrect diagnosis of
CUP. The exclusionary diagnosis of CUP can be optimised and acceler-
ated by the use of an algorithmic progression via the application of se-
quential multiplex IHC panels. Such a system reduces the amount of
tumour tissue needed for preliminary assessment and preserves material
for further genomic testing. This will help to optimise the patient care
strategy; allowing access to molecular-guided therapies.

The emerging relevance of RNA modifications in tumour biology:
VIRMA contributes to testicular germ cell tumours aggressive phe-
notype and chemotherapy resistance

Silva, R. Guimarães, M. Cantante, I. Braga, C. Oing, D. Nettersheim,
L. Looijenga, R. Henrique, C. Jeronimo
*IPO Porto - Department of Pathology & Cancer Biology and
Epigenetics Group, Portugal
Background & objectives: Testicular germ cell tumours(TGCTs) are
developmental cancers, reflecting embryogenesis. The recent field of
RNA modifications is being increasingly implicated in such events. We
previously demonstrated the relevance of VIRMA in TGCT patient sam-
ples, and now investigate this in vitro/in vivo.
Methods: We study the role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and related
writers, readers and erasers in 4 cell lines representative of TGCTs, in-
cluding after treatment with ATRA and in isogenic clones made resistant
to cisplatin. Also, we investigate the immunoexpression of METTL3 in a
TGCT tissue cohort.
Results: We show differential expression of m6A players in cell lines
representative of seminoma/non-seminoma. We demonstrate shifts in ex-
pression during differentiation with ATRA treatment and also among
cells sensitive and resistant to cisplatin treatment, implicating m6A mod-
ification in the acquisition of therapy resistance. METTL3
immunoexpression was significantly higher in non-seminomas
(p<0.0001), but did not significantly impact relapse-free survival.
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockdown of VIRMA, a component of the
writer complex, resulted in disruption of the complex, decreased m6A
deposition, reduced tumour aggressiveness (decreasing viability and pro-
liferation) and potentiated response to cisplatin treatment (eliciting higher
DNA damage). We are currently further validating these findings in vivo,
using the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay model.
Conclusion: RNA modifications are a current hot topic in research, being
implicated in tumour genesis, biology and resistance to therapy, with
VIRMA being the major representative player in TGCTs. This is inter-
esting given the recent development of targeted drug compounds directed
at elements of the m6A methyltransferase complex, which can be
envisioned as clinically useful in this particular tumour model.

*Neogenomics Laboratories, USA
Background & objectives: NTRK fusions are oncogenic drivers and are
predominantly detected by NGS, PCR, or FISH. Larotrectinib, a first-in-
class, highly selective, CNS-active TRK inhibitor, demonstrated a 78%
objective response rate and a 36.8-month median PFS across multiple
solid cancers (July 2019 data-cut).
Methods: Details of the testing methods used to diagnose patients with TRK
fusion cancer enrolled in three larotrectinib clinical trials (NCT02122913,
NCT02576431, NCT02637687) are reported. NTRK status was determined
by local molecular testing. ETV6-NTRK3 fusions were considered inferred
based on FISH break-apart results for tumour types in which NTRK fusions
are pathognomonic. Data cut-off: 20 July 2020.
Results: The analysis included 225 patients (129 adults [57%]) with 19
different tumour types. Most common gene fusions were ETV6-NTRK3
(41%), TPM3-NTRK1 (16%) and LMNA-NTRK1 (8%); 54 different
fusion partners were identified, 39 (72%) of which were unique occur-
rences. Testing methodologies/incidence of fusion partners varied by
Virchows Arch
tumour type. Most common method was NGS (196/225, 87%: DNA in
53/196 [27%], RNA in 96/196 [49%], DNA/RNA in 46/196 [23%],
unknown in 1 [1%]) followed by FISH (14/225, 6%) and PCR (12/225,
5%). NanoString, Sanger sequencing and chromosome microarray were
each utilized once. ETV6 and/or NTRK3 FISH were employed for spe-
cific tumour types (eg. secretory breast, IFS, salivary gland), detecting
14% of ETV6-NTRK3 fusions.
Conclusion: NTRK gene fusions occur with many partners with the
majority occurring at a low frequency across multiple tumour types,
supporting the need for validated and appropriate testing methodologies
that work agnostic of 5’ partners.

The EGFR, ALK and ROS1 mutation profile of non-small cell lung
carcinomas in the Turkish population: a single-centre analysis
E. Gun*, I.E. Cakir
*Izmir Katip Celebi University, Turkey
Background & objectives: The management of non-small cell
lungcarcinomas(NSCLC) has changed with the identification of the mo-
lecular pathways which are now used in targeted-therapies. We aimed to
reveal the 2-year epidermal growth factor(EGFR),anaplastic lymphoma
kinase(ALK) and ROS proto-oncogene1(ROS1) mutation profile in the
Turkish population.
Methods: The histopathological and molecular data of all NSCLC cases
that were evaluated in our department between May 2019 and April 2021
were retrieved from the archives. The demographic data of the patients,
type (cell block, biopsy, resection) and the localization (primary/metasta-
tic) of the specimen in which the molecular testing was done, the histo-
pathological diagnosis, and the mutation rates were noted.
Results: A total of 129 NSCLC (95 adenocarcinomas, 20 squamous cell
carcinomas [SCC], 14 NSCLC,NOS), cases underwent molecular
testing(M/F:121/28, aged 40-87). The molecular testing was performed
on cell blocks obtained from cytological specimens in 46, biopsies in 69,
and resections in 14 cases. EGFR mutation was seen in 15 (11,6%) cases
(three exon 18[allcodon 719],five exon 19,two exon 20 [1 T790M, 1
codon 768] and five exon 21[4 L858R, 1 L861Q]). The mean age of
EGFR-mutant patients was 60 (45-76) with 25% of all females(n=7)
and 6.6% of all males(n=8). ALK mutation was detected in 5 (3,8%)
patients (M/F:2/3,mean 65,6years) whereas ROS1 mutation was detected
in 2 (1,5%) (1 male, 1 female).
Conclusion: It is well-established in the literature that EGFR-activating
mutation rates vary depending on the country/race. We concluded that the
EGFR-activating mutation rates of the Turkish population are similar to the
European molecular data instead of the Asian. The majority of the cases with
EGFR, ALK and ROS1 mutations were adenocarcinomas in our series, how-
ever exon 20 - T790M mutation in one case with SCC was seen. ALK and
ROS1 mutation rates also seem consistent with the literature.

Putative germline variants from tumour-only genel panel sequenc-
ing: results of a single-centre study
S. Dintner*, M. Schlesner, M. Harloff, T. Schaller, M. Frühwald, M.
Trepel, B. Märkl, M. Kuhlen, R. Claus
*University Medical Center Augsburg, Germany
Background & objectives: Multi-gene panel NGS from tumour tissues
has become the mainstay personalized oncology. However, when sugges-
tive VAF around 50% or higher are found it remains unclear whether
variants in cancer genes identified by tumour-only sequencing might
potentially be of germline origin.
Methods: A total of 2057 gene panel tumour-only NGS analyses from
adult and paediatric patients with solid tumours who were diagnosed
between 2018 and 2020 were reviewed. NGS of 83 cancer related genes
was performed. Results were reviewed for potential PGVs using follow-
ing criteria: Pathogenic variants with an allele frequency ≥40% and a
VAF to tumour purity ratio ≥50%.
Results: Putative PGVs with a VAF ≥40% and a VAF/tumour purity ratio ≥
50% were detected in 408 patients. The list of filtered putative PGVs included
those in cancers of high rates of susceptibility and with a high proportion of
patients with known inherited PGVs (breast, colorectal, ovary). Further filter-
ing by exclusion of genes with high prevalence and strong association with
syndromic phenotypes resulted in 250 PGVs in 46 genes. The identified
variants included those associated with genes with high germline conversion
rate (BRCA, PALB2) and to a lower degree those with lower reported
germline prevalence (EGFR, IDH1). In selected cases, the suspicious PGVs
were successfully verified by germline analysis.
Conclusion: Although tumour-only sequencing provides a cost-
effective approach to identifying somatic variants present in the
tumour, it will also detect any germline variants present. These
findings may influence patient care by impacting on systemic ther-
apy choices, surgical decisions, additional cancer screening, and
genetic counseling in families. The findings of this study suggest
that the application of systematic filter steps combined with auto-
mated flagging and concise manual review as proposed by current
guidelines can provide an opportunity to detect PGVs.

Lindert, R.A. Damhuis, S. Willems
*Department of Pathology, University Medical Centre Groningen,
The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Adequate and timely testing for genetic al-
terations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is necessary to consider
targeted therapy. Currently, within a 2017 cohort we assessed whether
molecular testing improved after 2015.
Methods: All stage IV non-squamous NSCLC with incidence year 2017
from the Netherlands Cancer Registry were matched to the Dutch pathol-
ogy registry (PALGA). Using information extracted from pathology ex-
cerpts, proportions of tumours tested for EGFR/KRAS, BRAF, and
HER2 mutation, ALK, ROS1, and RET rearrangement <3 months after
diagnosis were determined and variation between 42 laboratories was
assessed.
Results: Of 3746 identified patients, we have currently analysed
3647 (97%). Ninety-two patients were non-eligible after matching,
leaving 3555 (94%) patients. EGFR/KRAS testing was performed in
2992 patients (84%) (laboratory variation 68-100%). Of the
EGFR/KRAS wildtype tumours (n=1516), 1392 (92%) were tested
for BRAF (14-100%), 1309 (86%) for HER2 (18-100%), 1231
(81%) for ALK (50-100%), 952 (63%) for ROS1(3-100%), and
663 (44%) for RET (0-100%). The reason for not testing was not
reported for the majority of patients. Insufficient tumour tissue and
inappropriate specimen were the most stated reasons for not testing
within the reported group.
Conclusion: These data show significantly higher EGFR/KRAS, ALK
and ROS1 testing proportions compared to 2015. Further improvement
remains possible, in some laboratories more than in others, and especially
for ROS-1 and RET testing, to identify candidates for targeted therapy.
Initiatives for improvement will involve starting a dialogue with profes-
sionals on a regional level, where these findings and recommendations of
a best practice session will be discussed.

Prevalence of KRAS p.(G12C) in stage IV non-squamous NSCLC
patients in the Netherlands; a retrospective cohort study
B. Cajiao Garcia*, C.C. Kuijpers, A.J. van der Wekken, L. van Kempen,
E. Schuuring, S. Willems
*Department of Pathology, University Medical Centre Groningen,
The Netherlands
Background & objectives: KRAS is the most frequent mutation in
cancer, especially KRAS p.(G12C) (39%-42% KRAS-mutant
NSCLC). Recently, clinical trials with drugs specifically targeting
KRAS p.(G12C) showed promising responses. We aim to investi-
gate the prevalence of KRAS p.(G12C) mutations within a NSCLC
cohort.
Methods: Patients diagnosed with stage IV non-squamous NSCLC in
2013, 2015, and 2017 in the Netherlands were retrieved from the
Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) and the Dutch Pathology Registry
(PALGA). After matching of the databases pertinent clinical and patho-
logical variables were extracted. Testing rates and prevalence of KRAS
p.(G12C) were calculated from the collected data.
Results: A total of 10,851 tumours were selected from the NCR and
matched with PALGA. After exclusion of 596 non-eligible patients due
to exclusion criteria, 10,255 patients were included, of whom 7,908
(77%) were tested for KRAS mutations within 3 months after diagnosis.
Testing rate increased from 71.8% in 2013, to 80.9% and 83.3% in 2015
and 2017, respectively. An increase in the ≥65-year-old population
(50.2% (2013) to 57.5% (2017), p<0.01) and an increase in
histological/cytological specimen ratio (65.6% (2015) to 71.4% (2017),
p<0.01) was observed. In the total population the prevalence for KRAS
p.(G12C) was 15.5%.
Conclusion: Using data systematically collected in Dutch national cancer
and pathology registries, the prevalence of KRAS p.(G12C) mutations in
the entire population of patients with stage IV-NSCLC in the Netherlands
is 15.5%. Although the testing rate increased from 2013 to 2017, there
seems to be room for improvement although reasons why a test was not
requested was not systematically captured.

Camacho, A. Blanco, M. Gomez, E. Moragon, E. de Alava, B. Bellosillo*
*Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain
Background & objectives: Analysis of BRCA1/2 genes in ovarian can-
cer patients was historically assessed in the germ line and is now moving
to tumoral tissue. Our aim was to evaluate the sensitivity of mutation
detection by NGS approaches in FFPE tumoral samples.
Methods: Specimens from 81 previously characterized germline ovarian
cancer patients from three centers were included. Each center studied their
cases with the available NGS technique: customized hybrid capture based
panel (VHIO), BRCAplus amplicon panel, Qiagen (Hospital del Mar)
and Oncomine BRCA Research Assay, ThermoFisher (Virgen del
Rocio). Sequencing was performed on Illumina (capture panel and
Qiagen panel) or GeneStudio S5 systems.
Results: Of the 81 samples initially selected, 10 samples were not
evaluable due to insufficient quality of the DNA obtained from the sam-
ple. Of the remaining 71 samples (30 cases with BRCA1 germline mu-
tations, 17 cases with BRCA2 germline mutations, and 24 cases without
BRCA1 / 2 germline mutations), the previously identified germline mu-
tations were detected in 47/47 cases (100%). In addition, somatic muta-
tions were identified in 9 cases with no germline mutations, 5 in BRCA1
and 4 in BRCA2 with allelic frequencies between 20-47%. In addition, in
2 cases that presented germline mutations, a somatic mutation was also
detected (1 in BRCA1 and 1 in BRCA2)
Conclusion: These results indicate that the analysis in tumoral tissue has
adequate sensitivity for the detection of germline mutations in the
BRCA1/2 genes if the quality of the tissue DNA is sufficient.
Furthermore, the tumoral biopsy study allows us to identify somatic al-
terations in these genes.

Multiparametric (2+3) assessment of PD-L1 expression in tumour
tissue: a novel, rapid and easy-to-use algorithm to capture more of
the biological complexity and minimise inter- and intra-observer
variability
A. Baltan*, S. Costache, H. Haynes, K. Billingham, T. Thomas, A.
Chefani, V. Herlea, S. Wedden, C. D'Arrigo
*University Emergency Hospital, Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: PD-L1 counting of positive TC and/or IC is
difficult and time-consuming near the positivity thresholds, correlation
between small biopsy and excision can be poor and morphological data
are not captured. We describe a novel algorithm to address these issues.
Methods: We assessed %TC, %IC, extent, clustering and distribution (2
+3) by eyeballing using 7 bins for each parameter. Matched diagnostic
and excision biopsies were stained with on-label SP263 CDx and
digitised (3DHistech). An initial set of 20 cases were scored by all pa-
thologists. Non-concordant cases were reviewed and given a score by
consensus. Each pathologist then assessed 25 additional cases.
Results: Six consultant pathologists, two trainee pathologists and one
clinical scientist participated in the study. Training consisted of self-
learning using a short presentation; this suggests that the 2+3 system
[SW1]would be easy to introduce in the diagnostic routine. The 2+3
scoring algorithm was used on TNBC and NSCLC and showed excellent
inter- and intra-observer concordance when compared to established
CPS, TPS and IC/TC algorithms[SW2]. It also improved correlation be-
tween small biopsies and excision of the same tumour when compared to
established PD-L1 algorithms used in oncology.
Conclusion: The 2+3 algorithm is easy to use, reproducible, captures
more of the biological diversity and is less sensitive to tissue sampling.
It reduces the influence on the overall score of imprecisions in single
parameters. The 7 bins scale facilitates observer concordance.
Morphological parameters such as IC distribution, important in identify-
ing responders to immune checkpoint therapy, are part of the assessment
and may improve prediction. Clinical trials will provide the correct
weight to each parameter for best patient selection.

Diagnosis of membranous nephropathy and differentiation between
primary and secondary forms applying immunohistochemistry using
C4d and PLA2r antibodies

*Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade,
Serbia
Background & objectives: Appreciating a huge effort to clearly separate
primary from secondary membranous nephropathy (MN), due to direct
influence on patients' treatments, several biomarkers have been sug-
gested, including C4d and PLA2r.
Virchows Arch
Methods: Insufficient studies concerning the aforementioned
pathohistological approach have led us to explore the sensitivity and
specificity of recently proposed biomarkers in distinguishing primary
and secondary MN. We applied immunohistochemistry (C4d, 1:50,
ab167093, Abcam; PLA2r, 1:1000, ab188028, Abcam) using 21 kidney
biopsies (13 primaries, 8 secondary), as well as 40 renal samples of
various non-MN diagnosis.
Results: C4d and PLA2r were expressed in glomeruli in all MNs (21/21),
both primary and secondary. Furthermore, C4d was not observed among
non-MN cases, while PLA2r was detected in the majority of them (39/40
non-MN diagnoses: focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (n=5), minimal
change disease (n=3), mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (n=14),
IgA nephropathy (n=4), post-infective glomerulonephritis (n=4), hyper-
tensive nephropathy (n=1), diabetic nephropathy (n=2), rapidly progres-
sive glomerulonephritis (n=3), lupus nephritis (n=3)). These results indi-
cate the absolute specificity and sensitivity (100%) of C4d antibody in
diagnosis of MN regardless of the etiology. However, despite an absolute
sensitivity, PLA2r failed to differentiate primary from secondary MN due
to extremely low specificity (2.5%).
Conclusion: Confirmation of membranous nephropathy could be done
by C4d in each case, without false results, either positive or negative.
However, differentiation of primary from secondary MN is not reliable
using the proposed PLA2r method, thus seeking a better biomarker is
warranted.

Serbia
Background & objectives: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
could affect the integrity and function of many organs, including
the kidneys. Although the frequency of SLE is less common in
children than in adults, affected children develop lupus nephritis
(LN) significantly more often.
Methods: In order to analyse relevant clinical (gender, frequency of
LN as the first manifestation of SLE, proteinuria and serum creatinine
values) and pathohistological parameters (LN classes, activity and
chronicity index), this study included 217 biopsy samples of kidney
tissue. Patients were divided into two groups: patients under (n=35)
and over (n=183) 18 years.
Results: Among investigated clinical data, serum creatinine values
were significantly lower in the paediatric population (71.6±16.4
μmol/l) than in adults (115.5±64 μmol/l), p<0.001. Parameters
which define disease activity index were similar in both groups
with exception of interstitial infiltration that was significantly
higher in the adult group, p=0,003. Chronicity index (p=0,002) as
well as the tubulointerstitial parameters that determine it (tubular
atrophy (p<0,001) and interstitial fibrosis (p=0,011)) were also
higher in adults. Blood vessel involvement was frequently detected
in adult biopsies (p<0,001).
Conclusion: Serum creatinine values are significantly higher in the adult
population of LN. Pathohistological findings indicate that glomerular LN
lesions do not differ significantly in regard to activity and chronicity
index in paediatric and adult populations, but degrees of tubulointerstitial
lesions, either active or chronic, are significantly higher in adult-onset
LN.

NanoString transcriptome analysis with the B-HOT panel for clinical
diagnostics on for-cause kidney transplant biopsies

*Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Rotterdam,
The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Transcriptome analysis could help in diag-
nosing rejection and is an Additional Diagnostic Parameter for AMR.
NanoString is a novel and promising technique. We evaluated the com-
mercially available Banff-Human Organ Transplant Panel (B-HOT
panel) using NanoString on for-cause kidney transplant biopsies.
Methods: Transcriptome analysis using the B-HOT panel (770 tran-
scripts) of NanoString was performed on 96 formalin-fixed paraffin-em-
bedded for-cause kidney transplant biopsies retrieved from the archives of
the Erasmus MC Rotterdam and the University Hospital of Cologne.
Three groups were compared: antibody-mediated rejection (AMR,
n=32), T cell-mediated rejections (TCMR, n=32), and non-rejection (con-
trols, n=32). Data was analysed using the nSolver analysing software.
Results: 22 mRNA transcripts (CXCL1, FCGR3A, GNLY, ROBO4,
CCL3, CXCL10, TNF, CD74, PLAT, ICAM2, PSMB10, LST1,
CRIP2, EMP3, CX3CR1, HSPA12B, SH2D1B, LHX6, CD160,
S1PR5, TBX21, TRDC) were found to be differentially regulated
(upregulated) between AMR and controls after false discovery rate
(FDR) corrections. Eight (PSMB10, CX3CR1, TNF, CXCL11, GNLY,
CCL3, CD160, CXCL10) of these 22 transcripts were also found to be
upregulated in TCMR vs controls. No transcript was found to be differ-
entially regulated between AMR and TCMR after FDR correction.
Notably, even promising transcripts (TNFSF8, C9, TOX2, CD70)
showed overlap in expression between AMR and TCMR.
Conclusion: The B-HOT panel can help to distinguish kidney transplant
biopsies with rejection from biopsies without evidence of rejection.
Caution should be taken regarding the clinical value of this platform
regarding the more challenging and clinically important distinction be-
tween diagnosis of AMR (most cases of which show an additional com-
ponent of Borderline or TCMR) and pure TCMR or Borderline. The B-
HOT panel could help us identify the most promising transcripts for this
differential diagnosis on larger cohorts.

An audit of Electron Microscopic (EM) evaluation of native renal
biopsies
S. Singh*, C. Roufosse, A. Smith, H. Cook, L. Moran
*Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Aim: To carry out a retrospective survey of
native renal biopsies to determine the percentage of cases in which a) EM
evaluation was necessary to make the correct diagnosis; and b) EM eval-
uation provided clinically relevant additional information.
Methods: Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 100 consecutive native
renal biopsies. We excluded cases in which no sample was available for
EM or the EM sample was inadequate. We classified the EM as necessary
for diagnosis; adding information to diagnosis; and not necessary/not
adding information.
Results: In 81 cases, the main diagnosis was glomerular; tubulointerstitial
in 10; and in 9 it was mixed. In 20% of cases, correct diagnosis and
classification would not have been possible without EM evaluation. 19/
20 were glomerular diseases, and 1/20 was a tubulointerstitial disease. In
an additional 44% cases, EM evaluation provided clinically relevant in-
formation. Amongst cases where the main diagnosis was glomerular, EM
was necessary in 23% cases and helpful in other 47% and where it was
tubulointerstitial EM was necessary in 10% and added information in
30%. The most common situations where EM was neither necessary
Virchows Arch
nor helpful were ANCA- or anti-GBM- glomerulonephritis (n=5/5) and
IgA nephropathies (n=14/23)
Conclusion: EM is reported as essential for diagnosis in around 20% of
biopsies, and to add value in about 50%, although recent data is not
available. Our Trust carries out EM evaluation on all native renal biop-
sies, giving us the impetus to audit the contribution of EM in native renal
biopsy reporting. Our audit confirms the accuracy of published figures for
when EM is necessary or useful and supports continued practice of taking
a sample for EM in all native biopsies.

Heterozygous COL4A3 and COL4A4 patients with classic Alport
syndrome morphology – unexpected genetic testing results after kid-
ney biopsy

Đorđević, M. Ćorić, D. Galešić Ljubanović
*Department of Nephropathology and Electron Microscopy, Dubrava
University Hospital, Zagreb, Croatia
Background & objectives: Heterozygous Alport spectrum patients with
COL4A3 or COL4A4 mutations usually present as thin glomerular base-
ment membrane nephropathy on kidney biopsy. Here we present cases of
heterozygous patients with COL4A3 or COL4A4 mutations with classic
Alport syndrome morphology.
Methods: Fifteen patients, six males and nine females (age 2-47 years)
with pathohistological diagnosis of Alport syndrome (AS) were tested by
NGS sequencing (Illumina MiSeq platform) for COL4A3, COL4A4 and
COL4A5 mutations as a part of Croatian Science Foundation project
“Genotype-Phenotype correlation in Alport’s syndrome and Thin
Glomerular Basement Membrane Nephropathy”.
Results: At the time of kidney biopsy all patients presented with
haematuria and 8 of them with proteinuria. Only one patient had severe
decline in eGFR while all other patients had normal eGFR. There were 12
different mutations present (7 in COL4A3 and 5 in COL4A4), 6 of them
being novel, previously undescribed. In light microscopy 3 patients
showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. In three patients there were
interstitial foamy cells and only the oldest patient had significant intersti-
tial scaring (50%). All patients had classic Alport syndrome morphology
on electron microscopy. Immunohistochemical staining for COL4A3 and
COL4A5 was performed in four patients and showed normal distribution.
Conclusion: Diagnostic process of Alport spectrum disorders can be
challenging. Phenotype variability is very often among patients.
Although kidney biopsy gives insight in to the degree of kidney paren-
chyma damage genetic testing is necessary for complete diagnosis and
patient workup.

Vasileiadis, T. Johannes, A. Plesch, T. Lörch, W. Gwinner, J.H. Bräsen
*Nephropathology Unit, Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical
School (MHH), Germany
Background & objectives: Pathological diagnostics in kidneys are still
based on semi-quantitative eye-balling methods. In former studies, we
showed predictive value of precise immune cell quantification in allo-
grafts using digital semi-automated techniques. We now aim to achieve
fully automated segmentation workflow with CNNs.
Methods: Standard routine stains (immuno/histochemistry,
immunofluorecence) were digitized (20x) with Metafer, a commercial
scanning/imaging platform. Diagnostically relevant anatomical compart-
ments (cortex, medulla, glomeruli, tubuli (proximal/distal/collecting
duct), glomerular/peritubular capillaries, nuclei) were manually annotated
to generate data sets on human renal biopsies and nephrectomies. Data
were used to train multi-class semantic segmentation CNNs with broad
data augmentation to achieve a robustness against staining variances.
Results: On Jones-HE stains, a cortex-medulla-extrarenal CNN reveals
pixel based hit rates above 98%, detection of glomeruli show a hit rate
above 98%, a multi-class CNN for tubules, tubular membranes and
peritubular capillaries results in a hit rate close to 93% and pixelwise
nuclear-based cell detection shows hit rates above 98%. Identification
of cell location in interstitium, tubuli, glomeruli, peritubular and glomer-
ular capillaries reached very high hit rates: Glomerular endothelial cells
actually result in 83% true positives, 13% false negatives and 4 % false
positives. Ongoing work also includes detection of arteries and develop-
ment of classifiers for atrophic tubuli and immune-cell typing within
respective structures.
Conclusion: Structure segmentation based on CNNs can complement
and specify classical nephropathological diagnostics, especially for spa-
tial risk marker evaluation in early transplant biopsies.

Determination of antibodies that can be used in the differentiation of
primary and secondary membranous nephropathy and investigation
of the relationship of these antibodies with secondary causes
E. Köse*, Y. Yuyucu Karabulut, K. Turgutalp
*Mersin University Medical Faculty, Medical Pathology Department,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Membranous nephropathy (MN) is the most
common primary glomerular disease in adults that causes nephrotic syn-
drome. We aim to evaluate Phospholipase-A2 receptor (PLA2R),
Thrombospondin type-1 domain-containing 7A (THSD7A), and Neural
epidermal growth factor-like 1 protein (NELL1) in MN patients.
Methods: 122 cases of MN and 21 cases of Class V Lupus nephritis
diagnosed at Mersin University Medical Faculty Medical Pathology
Department between 2008 and 2020 are included in this study.
Immunohistochemical staining for PLA2R, THSD7A, and NELL1 was
performed on the tissue sections obtained from paraffin-embedded blocks
of renal biopsy materials.
Results: Percentage of cases positive for PLA2R, THSD7A, and NELL1
were found to be 64.9%, 6.7%, and 6.5% respectively. NELL1 positivity
was associated with female gender and Diabetes Mellitus. THSD7A pos-
itivity was associated with the absence of hypertension clinically and;
intraluminal/mesangial polymorphonuclear lymphocytes, interstitial in-
flammation, evidence of tubular damage, tubulitis, and calcifications his-
tologically. It was also associated with fibrinogen positivity in an immu-
nofluorescence study. PLA2R positivity was associated with lower serum
IgA antibody levels.
Conclusion: The traditional classification of membranous nephropathy
does not take associated antigen types and their unique clinical, histopath-
ological and immunological profiles into account. Associated antigens of
membranous nephropathy patients can be determined in most of the
membranous nephropathy patients and therefore should be the basis of
histopathological evaluation and clinical management.

Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: An optimal decentralized molecular kidney
transplant biopsy classifier allows the input of different gene expression
assays. We developed a classifier using the Banff-Human Organ
Transplant (B-HOT) gene panel extracted from a historical Molecular
Microscope® Diagnostic system (MMDx) microarray data set.
Methods: Gene expression data (GEO: GSE98320) from 1208 kidney
transplant biopsies was used to develop a classifier with genes that
matched those from the B-HOT panel. Tree-based models, random forest
and XGBoost, were trained to predict kidney transplant biopsy Banff
categories, including non-rejection, antibody-mediated rejection
(ABMR), T cell–mediated rejection (TCMR), and mixed rejection
(ABMR+TCMR). Performance was evaluated using nested cross-
validation.
Results: A multilabel random forest model trained on B-HOT panel
genes achieved a mean accuracy of 76.2%. However, both classifiers
could not predict ABMR+TCMR Banff category. Accuracy was im-
proved to 77.1% using only the MMDx genes included in the B-HOT
panel. Classification of rejection versus non-rejection and rejection sub-
types separately vastly improved overall performance for both random
forest and XGBoost. The best performance was achieved by XGBoost
using the B-HOT panel and synthetic minority oversampling for ABMR+
TCMR samples, with an accuracy of 93.6% for non-rejection and 95% for
rejection subtypes. Balanced accuracies of prediction were 95.9% and
90.8% for ABMR and TCMR, respectively.
Conclusion: A kidney transplant biopsy classifier using molecular data
of a historical data set obtained for the MMDx was developed using only
the genes included in the B-HOT panel. While comparison of perfor-
mance should be treated with caution due to differences in validation sets,
the performance of this classifier was higher compared to MMDx. This
work is one step closer to the development of a decentralized kidney
transplant biopsy classifier that is effective on data derived from different
gene expression platforms.

Kidney biopsy findings in SARS-Cov2 infected patients: a single cen-
ter case series of post/co-Covid glomerulopathies & kidney injury
M. Bugdayci Uner*, A. Saglam Ayhan, MD
*Department of Pathology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Covid19 is a multisystem disease, which
may also present with acute tubular injury. Besides, glomerular patholo-
gies associated with Covid-19 can be seen as a “second-hit” phenomenon.
Herein, we present 8 post/co-covid cases with glomerular, tubular and
vascular injury.
Methods: H&E, JMS, PAS, PAMS, MTC and immunofluorescent slides
(IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, C1q, Kappa and Lambda) of 8 cases with kidney
dysfunction after or during Covid19 proven by PCR positivity were re-
evaluated. Then, clinical findings (such as proof of covid19 pneumonia
via thorax CT, interval between beginning of Covid19 symptoms and
kidney dysfunction etc) were correlated with histopathological findings.
Results: The mean age of our cases were 64,1 yrs (27-90), and included 4
female and 4 male. Two patients (61 and 71) died while hospitalized in
intensive care unit. Six cases had covid19 pneumonia, almost all cases
had elevated serum creatinine levels, while some showed proteinuria.
Two cases were post-transplant while others were native biopsies.
Kidney biopsy findings demonstrated 3 main groups: 1) Post-covid
glomerulopathies with immune complexes: Anti-GBM disease (1 case),
IgA nephropathy (2 cases), Post-infectious glomerulonephritis (1 case),
IgG-kappa and C3-associated glomerulonephritis (1 case). 2)Post-covid
kidney findings without immune complexes: ANCA-associated pauci-
immune crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis (1 case), Acute tubular
injury (1 case) 3) Co-covid intimal endarteritis (1 case).
Conclusion: Even though, acute tubular injury is the most common his-
topathological finding in kidney involvement of covid19, viral induced
glomerulopathies must be kept in mind in SARS-Cov2 infection.
Especially in post-covid period, glomerulopathies associated with
Covid-19 can be seen as a “second-hit” phenomenon. Indirect damage
seems to have a role in endothelial injury via coagulation mechanisms,
and immune system-inflammation pathways (including complement).
Much more remains to be learned to elucidate the exact mechanisms
causing acute kidney injury in patients with COVID-19.

No brachyury expression in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour
H.G. Yeter*, B. Babaoglu, K. Kösemehmetoğlu, F. Soylemezoglu
*Hacettepe University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour (AT/RT)
shares some morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular fea-
tures with poorly differentiated chordoma (PDC). Here, we investigate
the expression of brachyury, which is known as a sensitive and specific
marker for notochordal differentiation, in AT/RT.
Methods: Forty-four tumour samples from 40 patients, diagnosed as AT/
RT between 2001-2020 were included in 3-mm tissue microarrays.
Immunohistochemical stainings for INI1 and two different clones of
brachyury (Abcam-ab209665 and Santa Cruz-A4) were performed.
Nuclear staining is counted as positive for both stains.
Results: Twenty-three patients were male and 17 were female. Patients
were aged 0 to 15 years (mean:2,85 years and median:1 year). Twenty-
seven of 44 tumour samples were located supratentorial; 15 were
infratentorial and 2 were spinal. Three cases (7,5%) were found to retain
INI1 expression. Two cases (4,5%), located at dorsal sellar region and
clivus, were found to be positive with brachyury, one of which demon-
strated diffuse and strong positivity, while the other showed focal (30%)
expression. These 2 cases were reclassified as PDC. Two different clones
of brachyury demonstrated similar results for all cases.
Conclusion: AT/RT’s one of the most challenging differential is PDC, a
recent entity characterized by sheets of epithelioid/rhabdoid cells with
accompanying inflammation, INI1 loss and brachyury positivity, when
located particularly in the infratentorial and spinal region. Brachyury is a
reliable marker in differentiating AT/RT from PDC, knowing that none of
the unquestionable supratentorial AT/RTs in our series showed brachyury
expression.

Elesclomol-induced increase of mitochondrial reactive oxygen spe-
cies impairs glioblastoma stem-like cell survival and tumour growth

Biffoni, R. Pallini, L. Ricci-Vitiani
*Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli, IRCCS, UCSC, Italy
Background & objectives: It has been widely demonstrated glioblasto-
ma stem-like cells (GSCs), a subpopulation of tumour cells endowed with
stem-like propertiesis responsible for tumour maintenance, progression
and contribute to GBM-associated neovascularization processes, through
different mechanisms including the trans-differentiation into GSC-
derived endothelial cells (GdECs).
Virchows Arch
Methods: In order to identify druggable cancer-related pathways in
GBM, we assessed the effect of a selection of 349 compounds on both
GSCs and GdECs. As a result of this screening, we selected elesclomol
(STA-4783) as the most effective agent in inducing cell death on both
GSC and GdEC lines tested.
Results: Elesclomol has been already described to be a potent oxidative
stress inducer. In depth investigation of the molecular mechanisms un-
derlying GSC and GdEC response to elesclomol, confirmed that this
compound induces a strong increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species (ROS) in both GSCs and GdECs ultimately leading to a non-
apoptotic copper-dependent cell death. Finally, we used our experimental
model of mouse brain xenografts to test the combination of elesclomol
and temozolomide (TMZ) and confirmed their efficacy in vivo.
Conclusion: In conclusion we think that our results support further evalu-
ation of therapeutics targeting oxidative stress such as elesclomol with the
aim of satisfying the high unmet medical need in the management of GBM.

Adult diffuse gliomas in the era of morphomolecular diagnosis –
lessons from a 2-year experience in a Portuguese reference centre
T. Maia*, D. Pereira, M. Mafra
*IPO Lisboa, Francisco Gentil, Portugal
Background & objectives: IDH1/2-mutations are frequent in adult dif-
fuse gliomas (ADG), particularly in younger patients (≤55yo). Both IDH-
mutation-status and 1p/19q-codeletion-status are strong prognostic/
therapeutic stratifiers. We aimed to evaluate: a)prevalence of IDH-
mutations across all age groups of ADG; b)morphophenotypic correla-
tions with IDH-mutation-status and 1p/19q-codeletion-status.
Methods: All consecutive cases of ADG with concurrent molecular test-
ing for IDH-mutation/ 1p/19p-codeletion diagnosed between March 2019
and February 2021 were reviewed and morphologically classified: a)pure
astrocytic (PA); b)oligoastrocytic/ambiguous (OA);
c)oligodendroglioma-like (ODG). An immunohistochemical (IHQ) panel
was applied to all cases: IDH1-R132H (iIDH), ATRX and p53. IDH1/2
molecular testing was performed by PCR-based sequencing. 1p/19q-
codeletion was evaluated by FISH.
Results: A total of 153 cases were reviewed: 34 were IDH-mutated (n=16
PA, n=3 OA, n=15 ODG), 27 in younger adults (prevalence=43.6%), 7 in
older adults (prevalence=7.7%, the oldest with 72yo) (n=1-PA non-1p/19q-
codeleted/n=6 OA/ODG-1p/19q-codeleted); 31 (91.2%) IDH-mutations
corresponded to IDH-R132H form, 3 to the IDH-R132S mutation variant.
iIDH-positivity was 100% specific and 100% sensitive for IDH1-R132H
mutation. The patterns iIDH-negative/ATRX-negative (n=6) and OA/
ODG-morphology/ATRX-positive/p53-negative (n=15) were 100% sen-
sitive to detect potential IDH mutations, iIDH-negative/ATRX-negative
pattern with overall specificity=50% and specificity=100% in non-
midline ADG. OA/ODG-morphology-ATRX-positive/p53-negative pat-
tern had sensitivity=100% and specificity=93.3% in predicting 1p/19q-
codeletion. PA, ATRX-negativity and p53-positivity were mutually ex-
clusive with 1p/19q-codeletion. PA morphology-iIDH-negative/ATRX-
positive (n=117) and OA-iIDH-negative/ATRX-positive/p53-positive
(n=2) were IDH-wildtype lacking 1p/19q-codeletion.
Conclusion: Prevalence of IDH-mutations in ADG with astrocytic
morphophenotypes (PA, iIDH-negative/ATRX-negative, OA-iIDH-neg-
ative/ATRX-positive/p53-positive) was lower than expected for younger
adults, rare in older adults as expected. Prevalence of R132H mutation
was similar to the literature.
IDH-mutation-status is reliably predicted/identified combining morphol-
ogy and immunophenotype, regardless of age.
1p/19q-codeletion is reliably predicted/excluded by specific
morphophenotypes.
The majority of ADG (89,5%) don´t need molecular testing for IDH-
mutations/ 1p/19q-codeletion, an important rationale to preserve tissue
in the foreseeable era of deeper molecular testing for targeted therapy.

Prognostic factors of the rare papillary tumour of the pineal region: a
systematic review and analysis
B. Montenegro, J.P. Dinis, N.J. Lamas*
*Anatomic Pathology Service, Department of Pathology, Centro
Hospitalar e Universitário do Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Tumours of pineal region are rare,
representing less than 1% of all intracranial tumours in adults. Here, we
aimed to compile current knowledge on the Papillary Tumour of the
Pineal Region (PTPR) to identify factors that influence death and
recurrence.
Methods: A search was performed in the databases PubMed, Scopus,
Web of Science and Google Scholar using the keywords “papillary pineal
tumour” and “papillary tumour of the pineal region”. 169 potentially
relevant articles were identified. The most relevant inclusion criteria were
the presence of histopathological and immunohistochemistry characteri-
zation and information on tumour size. Exclusion criteria comprised sys-
tematic reviews and Radiology-oriented articles.
Results: Twenty articles were included in the final analysis. A database
was created containing information on patient characterization, treatment,
follow-up, histopathological and immunohistochemistry data. Thirty pa-
tients were included, between 1 and 70 years, 14 of which were females
and 16 males. The descriptive and analytical statistics performed showed
that the presence of areas of necrosis, the expression of cytokeratins, higher
proliferative index and mitotic activity are associated with recurrence.
Conclusion: In patients with TPRP, the presence of necrosis seems to be
the factor that most influences the recurrence of the neoplasia, an aspect
that should be considered in the decision to start more aggressive thera-
pies earlier. This study has limitations conditioned by the reduced number
of cases published in the medical literature, so more comprehensive stud-
ies will be needed to confirm these findings.

Prognostic significance of the sarcomatous component in
gliosarcomas: clinicopathological and prognostic analysis of 25 cases
E. Gun*, F. Cakalagaoglu, A. Kahraman Akkalp, I.E. Sevin
*Izmir Katip Celebi University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Gliosarcoma is a rare central nervous system
neoplasm with biphasic glial and mesenchymal components.It is accepted
as a variant of glioblastoma multiforme(GBM) in the World Health
Organization 2016 classification. We aimed to evaluate the clinicopath-
ological and prognostic features of gliosarcomas.
Methods: All patients operated by our neurosurgery clinic between
January 2007 and January 2021 were retrospectively analysed. The de-
mographic, clinical, radiological, histopathological, immunohistochemi-
cal and molecular data of 25 patients diagnosed with gliosarcoma were
retrospectively analysed and statistically evaluated. The sarcomatous
component was grouped depending on the histopathological appereance
and prognostic studies were performed regarding these groups.
Results: There were 986 central nervous system tumours operated in our
hospital within 14 years. GBMs(n=232) constituted 23.5% wheras
gliosarcomas were 10.7% of GBMs (n=25,mean age 57,3,M/F:17/8).
The most common localization was the temporal region. The mean tu-
mour diameter was 5,7(2-9)cm. The primary tumour was gliosarcoma in
12 patients,and it developed secondary to GBM in 13 patients. The sar-
comatous component was grouped as conventional spindle cell
sarcoma(n=13),pleomorphic sarcoma containing pleomorphic cells(n=6)
and high-grade sarcoma with heterologous differentiation(n=6).
Virchows Arch
Recurrence was seen after an average of 3,6(±3,1)months. The mean
survival time was 4,8 months,those with a previous diagnosis of GBM
had shorter survival(p=0.028)and those with heterologous components in
sarcoma had longer survival. The shortest survival was in sarcoma con-
taining pleomorphic cells(p=0.024).
Conclusion: Gliosarcomas are extremely rare tumours which are only
available as case reports in the literature. Our study contributes to the
literature in terms of incidence and histopathological differentiation data.
Gliosarcomas should be diagnosed with a careful histopathological ex-
amination and differentiated from entities such as epithelioid sarcoma and
carcinoma. When mesenchymal differentiation is seen,the entire tissue
should be examined and the glial component should be searched, and
molecular studies such as IDH,as well as PTEN, TP53, TERT mutations
and CDKN2A deletion should be performed.

The immunohistochemical expression of Serin and Arginine-Rich
Splicing Factor 1 (SRSF1) is helpful in distinguishing diffuse astro-
cytomas and oligodendrogliomas from other gliomas
G. Broggi*, F. Certo, R. Altieri, G. Barbagallo, R. Caltabiano
*University of Catania Section of Anatomic Pathology, Italy
Background & objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the
immunoexpression of SRSF1 in a series of 102 cases of diffuse and
circumscribed adult gliomas, emphasizing the potential diagnostic role
of this protein in the differential diagnosis of brain tumours.
Methods: 42 IDH-wild type glioblastomas (GBMs), 21 IDH-mutant and
1p/19q codeleted oligodendrogliomas, 15 ependymomas, 15 pilocytic
astrocytomas (PAs), 5 sub-ependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs)
and 4 pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXAs) were retrospectively re-
trieved from the neuropathological archive of our Institution and stained
with anti-SRSF1 immunohistochemically antibody. The presence of
brown chromogen within the cell nuclei was interpreted as positive
SRSF1 staining.
Results: Most GBMs (34/42; 81%), oligodendrogliomas (15/21;
71%), SEGAs (4/5; 80%) and PXAs (3/4; 75%) showed strong
SRSF1 immunoexpression, while no detectable staining was found
in the majority of ependymomas (13/15; 87%) and PAs (10/15; 67%);
the remaining ependymoma and PA cases exhibited weak and focal
SRSF1 immunoexpression in 2/15 (13%) and 5/15 (33%) cases, re-
spectively. Interestingly, no high SRSF1 immunohistochemical ex-
pression was found in any case of PA or ependymoma. Based on our
findings, SRSF1 was a reliable immunomarker, both in confirming
the diagnosis of diffuse astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma and in
excluding other neuropathological entities, such as ependymomas
and PAs.
Conclusion: Apart from the morphological and molecular features of
gliomas, there are currently no specific immunohistochemical
markers for this heterogeneous group of tumours: thus, there is the
need to identify more specific and useful immunomarkers to distin-
guish each histological subtype from the others. The present study
strongly emphasizes the role of SRSF1 as a new and promising
immunomarker of diffuse gliomas and suggests that SRSF1 can be
exploitable as a diagnostic adjunct to conventional markers in neu-
ropathological daily practice.

Histone 3 thrimetilated in lysin 27 (H3K27me3) immunostaining is a
diagnostic and prognostic marker in diffuse gliomas with mixed or
oligodendroglial morphology
S. Ammendola*, N. Caldonazzi, M. Brunelli, P.L. Poliani, G. Pinna, F.
Sala, C. Ghimenton, A. Scarpa, V. Barresi
*Department of Diagnostics and Public Health, Section of Anatomic
Pathology, University of Verona, Italy
Background & objectives: Surrogate immunohistochemical markers for
1p/19q codeletion could simplify the differential diagnosis between as-
trocytoma and oligodendroglioma. H3K27me3immunohistochemical
loss has been associated with 1p/19qcodeletion.
We analysed the diagnostic and prognostic value of H3K27me3 immu-
nostaining in gliomas with oligodendroglial or mixed morphology.
Methods: H3K27me3 immunoexpression was analysed in 69 diffuse
gliomas with oligodendroglial or mixed morphology. All cases were im-
munostained for IDH1 R132H, ATRX and P53.
IDH1 R132H-negative cases underwent IDH1/2 gene sequencing. The
presence of 1p/19q codeletion was investigated with FISH or PCR-based
assays.
Statistical analyses were performed to assess the correlation between
H3K27me3 staining and clinical-pathologic data.
Results: H3K27me3 was lost in 58/60 oligodendroglial tumours with
retained (n=47) or non-conclusive (n=11) ATRX staining, 3/6 astrocytic
IDH-mutant with ATRX loss and 3/3 IDH-wt tumours. H3K27me3 was
retained in 2/60 oligodendroglial tumours, that also retained ATRX, and
in 3/6 astrocytic IDH-mutant tumours, two of which had lost and one
retained ATRX.
H3K27me3 retention was associated with a significantly shorter
recurrence-free survival (P< 0.0001), independently from IDH mutational
status, histological grade or 1p/19q codeletion.
Conclusion: A diagnostic workflow including H3K27me3 immunostain-
ing, after the assessment of IDH1/2 mutational status and ATRX staining,
is useful to reduce the number of diffuse gliomas that necessitate 1p/19q
codeletion testing.
According to this algorithm, gliomas IDH-wt and IDH-mutant with
ATRX loss are classified astrocytic; gliomas IDH-mutant with ATRX
retention and H3K27me3 loss are classified oligodendroglial; only glio-
mas IDH-mutant with retained or non-conclusive ATRX and retained
H3K27me3 necessitate 1p/19q codeletion testing. H3K27me3 loss is as-
sociated with longer recurrence-free survival.

Prognosis of patients with IDH-wildtype and IDH-mutant diffuse
gliomas: data from the King Hussein Cancer Center (2014–2019)
M. Al-Hussaini*, S. Al-Ghnimat, H. Sultan, J.Z. Amarin
*King Hussein Cancer Center, Jordan
Background & objectives: Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)
signal a better prognosis in diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumours.
Our aim was to study the prognosis of patients with IDH-wildtype and
IDH-mutant diffuse gliomas at the King Hussein Cancer Center.
Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of all Jordanian
patients with diffuse gliomas who were managed at our center (2014–
2019) and underwent IDH1 (R132H) immunostaining. We included the
following entities: diffuse astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblas-
toma, oligodendroglioma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma. We used
the Kaplan–Meier method to estimate the overall survival rates and the
log-rank test to perform pairwise comparisons.
Results: We included 181 patients. Glioblastoma was the most common
entity (n = 104), followed by anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 29), diffuse
astrocytoma (n = 24), oligodendroglioma (n = 15), and anaplastic
oligodendroglioma (n = 9). IDH-wildtype tumours outnumbered IDH-
mutant tumours 112 (61.9%) to 69 (38.1%). IDH mutation was most com-
mon in oligodendroglioma (93.3%), followed by anaplastic
oligodendroglioma (77.8%), diffuse astrocytoma (62.5%), anaplastic astro-
cytoma (51.7%), and glioblastoma (17.3%). IDH status statistically signif-
icantly stratified the overall survival of the full cohort (p < 0.001), patients
with any astrocytic tumour (p < 0.001), patients with a grade II or III
astrocytic tumour (p = 0.035), and patients with glioblastoma (p = 0.049).
Conclusion: IDH mutation signals a better prognosis in patients with a
diffuse glioma. This finding is concordant with the published internation-
al literature.

Lacrimal gland pleomorphic adenoma: factors leading to recurrence
and malignant potential
S. Flanagan*, S. Reilly, R. Ellard, N. Walsh, R. Khan, S. Kennedy
*Histopathology Department, St Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin,
Ireland
Background & objectives: Lacrimal gland pleomorphic adenomas
(LGPA) can undergo malignant transformation, most often in recurrent
cases. Complete excision is thus the recommended definitive diagnostic/
therapeutic approach when clinically/radiologically suspected.
This paper will investigate the potential factors associated with LGPA
recurrence and malignant transformation.
Methods: A retrospective review of histologically confirmed LGPA
cases occurring between September 1975 and January 2021 (46 years)
in a national tertiary referral centre for ophthalmic pathology was under-
taken. Where residual/recurrent LGPA or malignant transformation was
identified, patient records were accessed and further information includ-
ing; socio-demographics, presenting symptoms, diagnostic procedures,
radiology and clinical course was analysed.
Results: A total of 13 cases of LGPA were identified. Recurrent LGPA
occurred in 3 patients, no cases of malignant transformation were report-
ed. The recurrence time for LGPA ranged from 6 months to 15 years post
initial diagnosis. Recurrence occurred in 2 males and 1 female, all were
Irish Caucasians with ages ranging from 13 to 72 at the time of first
biopsy. The initial diagnostic procedure in all recurrences was incisional
biopsy. The reasons for incisional biopsy versus the recommended pri-
mary en bloc resection included clinical uncertainty and broad radiologic
differential. No recurrences were identified in LGPA cases which had
undergone outright complete excision.
Conclusion: LGPA should be considered as a potential diagnosis in
lacrimal lesions at all ages. In cases of clinical or radiological ambiguity,
second opinion from a specialist centre should be sought. Where neces-
sary, fine needle aspiration cytology is preferable to incisional biopsy due
to the associated potential for tumour displacement and subsequent in-
creased risk of recurrence. In situations where incisional biopsy is under-
taken, the suture track should be marked to facilitate identification and
removal of the entire track during subsequent resection.

Quick sectioning-free H&E imaging of bulk tissue using multiphoton
microscopy
M. Strauch*, J.P. Kolb, C. Rose, N. Merg, J. Hundt, C. Kümpers, S.
Perner, S. Karpf, R. Huber
*Medical Laser Center Lübeck, Germany
Background & objectives: Labour and time-intensive paraffin section-
ing is the foundation of today’s routine pathology workflow. To acceler-
ate this process, we create H&E images from bulk fresh or formalin-fixed
tissue without sectioning using a home-built multiphoton microscope
based on fibre laser technology.
Methods: To evaluate whether our multiphoton microscopy technique
can provide a fast alternative to paraffine or frozen sectioning, we com-
pare images of our system using H&E-stained formalin-fixed tissue as
well as acridine orange and sulforhodamine 101-stained fresh tissue to
classical formalin-fixed paraffin embedded sections.
Results: Our multiphoton microscope can acquire images of bulk acridine
orange and sulforhodamine 101 stained skin and kidney samples within less
than 1 hour. We gross the tissue block and stain it for 10 min without any
further processing. Afterwards the tissue is scanned by the microscope and
converted into a digital H&E image. The digital image can now directly be
analysed by a pathologist. Additionally, we compared multiphoton micro-
scope images of formalin-fixed H&E-stained tissue to paraffin-embedded
sections of the same block to assess the quality of our technique.
Conclusion: We create H&E-like images without sectioning the tissue
using a home-built multiphoton microscope. Two different staining
mechanisms have been tested to acquire high quality images. In the fu-
ture, we want to further improve our measurement speed and start a
clinical study on basal-cell carcinoma. The potential combination with
other imaging modalities such as fluorescent lifetime imaging and the
application of AI algorithms on the digital data might allow us to increase
the diagnostic accuracy of our method.

*Department of Pathology, Aretaieion Hospital, Medical School,
National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: COVID-19 pandemic has created the largest
disruption in education in human history. Quick and efficient modifica-
tions to teaching and assessment were devised to maintain biomedical
education continuity. We created a virtual pathology research project for
undergraduate (UG) biomedical sciences students.
Methods: The bespoke research project was based on fixed field images
from 20 digitised human nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) biop-
sies (n=40, training set and n=60, test set). Students were trained using a
web-based teleconference platform in four group sessions, followed by
one-to-one meetings, and self-studied using the free LITMUS NAFLD
Histopathology Atlas at the European Society of Pathology website
(https://tinyurl.com/LITMUS-Histology).
Results: Inter-observer variability between 3 stage 3 UG students and
three pathologists on semi-quantitative histological scoring of steatosis,
lobular inflammation (LI), hepatocyte ballooning (HB) and fibrosis was
assessed. The NASH CRN histological scoring system and Fleiss’s and
Cohen’s kappa statistics were applied. Results were discussed during
online adjudication meetings and multiple annotations were used on the
images in difficult cases. Following training, steatosis was the feature
with highest agreement (k=0.63) in the whole group, while moderate
agreement was achieved for LI (k=0.52), fibrosis (k=0.57) and HB
(k=0.46). All students efficiently prepared on time a 5,000-word disser-
tation, organized as an original research publication, and a power-point
presentation required for project assessment.
Conclusion: Novel educational initiatives have been employed to sustain
UG student theoretical and practical learning during Covid19 pandemic.
We have successfully modified a “wet” UG pathology research project
into a virtual “dry” project applying Cloud-based digital pathology imag-
ing and providing online pathology training and feedback sessions using
web-conference tools. Our methodology offers a digital alternative to
laboratory-based research teaching in pathology and may be further im-
proved for application in larger student groups.

Background & objectives: The impact of coronavirus infection SARS-
CoV-2 on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes is particular interest for
obstetricians, paediatricians and other scientists. The aim of study was
to reveal changes in the placenta and placental bed of women with con-
firmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods: The main group included 34 women (SARS-CoV-2 confirmed
by real-time PCR), a comparison group included 15 healthy women.
Histopathological examination of placenta and placental bed was carried
out. Staining method was performed on serial sections of paraffin blocks
with H&E. Immunohistochemistry with CD8 and CD3 was performed, as
well as real-time PCR. Statistical processing by Fisher's test
Results: In the main group an increase of complications (anaemia (48%)
and isthmic-cervical insufficiency (11.8%), preeclampsia (2.9%) and
threatening premature birth (11.9%)) was found. Microscopic examina-
tion showed an increase in the incidence of maternal malperfusion (cen-
tral infarctions (p = 0.00032), agglutination of villi (p = 0.00043), decid-
ual arteriopathy (p = 0.00069), intervillous thrombi (p = 0.00005)) and
foetal stromal-vascular lesions (obliterative angiopathy (p = 0.00033),
chronic willitis (p = 0.00002), chronic chorioamnionitis (p = 0.00001),
massive fibrinoid deposits in the uteroplacental region (p = 0.00001)).
Biopsys of the placental bed showed foci of lymphohistiocytic infiltration
and focal hemorrhages in the perivascular areas. Decidual arteriopathy
was detected in 18 cases.
Conclusion: Changes in the placenta in women with confirmed SARS-
CoV-2 infection in the third trimester of pregnancy are characterized by
the development of maternal vascular malperfusion, chronic inflamma-
tion in the form of focal villitis and interillusitis, obliterative angiopathy
and lesions of the decidual spiral arteries. These changes reflect an in-
creased risk for transplacental transmission of the virus and can lead to
long-term negative consequences for the foetus.

Impact of SARS-COV-2 on foetus and placenta of pregnant women
affected by COVID-19. Study of 177 cases received during the
pandemic

*Pathology Department, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: Placental pathology and vertical transmis-
sion in pregnant women infected by SARS-CoV2 has generated many
reports with nonspecific or contradictory results. The objective is to iden-
tify histological and molecular findings of infected placentas and its im-
pact on the course of pregnancy.
Methods: Placentas from 177 women infected with SARS-COV-2 were
reviewed, 66 of them with active infection within 10 days prior to deliv-
ery and 111 with past infection beyond this period. Two foetal autopsies
were submitted for pathological study. Placental infection was investigat-
ed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in all cases, RT-PCR in 27 cases, and
in situ hybridization (ISH) in 5 cases.
Results: Five placentas showed trophoblast necrosis with villous stroma
preserved, collapse of the intervillous space, intervillous fibrinoid deposi-
tion and variable polymorphous inflammatory infiltrates. These 5 placentas
were the only ones with SARS-CoV-2 infection identified by IHC and ISH
(granular cytoplasmic villous trophoblast staining) and RT-PCR. These 5
cases with placental infection belonged to the group of pregnant women
with active infection within 10 days prior to delivery. Two had focal lesions
(<20%) and the other three, which resulted in stillbirth, showed diffuse
lesions (> 80%). In two of the three deaths, an autopsy was performed
and infection of the foetal tissues was not demonstrated by IHC.
Conclusion: Placental SARS-CoV-2 infection has a characteristic histo-
logical pattern with villous trophoblast necrosis, intervillous space col-
lapse, and variable degrees of mixed inflammation and intervillous fibri-
noid deposition. Placental infection can be confirmed by trophoblast
cytoplasmic positivity with IHC and/or ISH for SARS-CoV-2. We pro-
pose the term "Diffuse Trophoblastic Damage" for extensive lesions,
which can be the cause of foetal death due to placental insufficiency. In
this study we have not been able to confirm the possible vertical trans-
mission of the virus.

Diffuse trophoblast damage is the hallmark
of SARS-CoV-2-associated foetal demise

Losa, M. Sesé, S. Ramón y Cajal-Agüeras, J. Ferreres Piñas
*Hospital Clinic, Spain
Background & objectives: Placenta pathology in SARS-CoV-2 infected
pregnancies seems rather unspecific. However, the identification of the
placental lesions due to SARS-CoV-2 infection would be a significant
advance in the management of these pregnancies and the identification of
the mechanisms in vertical transmission.
Methods: The pathological findings in placentas delivered from 198
SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women were investigated for the pres-
ence of lesions associated with placenta SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-
CoV-2 infection was investigated in placental tissues through immuno-
histochemistry and positive cases were further confirmed by in situ hy-
bridization. SARS-CoV-2 infection was also investigated by RT-PCR in
33 cases, including all the immunohistochemically positive cases.
Results: Nine cases were SARS-CoV-2 positive by immunohistochem-
istry, in situ hybridization, and RT-PCR. These placentas showed lesions
characterized by villous trophoblast necrosis with intervillous space col-
lapse and variable amounts of mixed intervillous inflammatory infiltrate
and perivillous fibrinoid deposition. Such lesions ranged from focal to
massively extended in five cases, resulting in intrauterine foetal death.
Two of the stillborn foetuses showed some evidence of SARS-CoV-2
positivity. The remaining 189 placentas did not show similar lesions.
Conclusion: The strong association between trophoblastic damage and
placenta SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that this lesion is a specific
marker of SARS-CoV-2 infection in placenta. Diffuse trophoblastic dam-
age, massively affecting chorionic tissue, can result in foetal death asso-
ciated with COVID-19 disease.

Paediatric Hodgkin Lymphomas: a 10-year retrospective study from
Coimbra
C. Faria*, A. Lai, B. Sepodes, G. Fontinha, M.J. Julião, M. Brito, R. Pina
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário, Portugal
Background & objectives: Hodgkin lymphomas are common lymphoid
neoplasms in children and adolescents worldwide. Two major types are
recognized: classic Hodgkin lymphoma and nodular lymphocyte pre-
dominant Hodgkin lymphoma. The improved therapeutic approach, ac-
cording to the correct diagnosis has led to a better prognosis.
Methods: From 2010 to 2020, there were 50 patients in total with histo-
pathological diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma. The neoplasm had a clear-
ly predilection for females, representing 62% of this retrospective study.
The youngest case was diagnosed in a 3 year-old child and the oldest one
in a 17 year-old adolescent.
Results: Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) represented 86% of cases
while nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma accounted
(NLPHL) for 10%. As for CHL, the vast majority were nodular sclerosis
subtype, representing almost 96% of the total cases, with mediastinal
involvement in almost all patients. There was also one case of mixed
cellularity subtype and another of lymphocyte-rich CHL.
Two patients had recurrent disease, one died without response to bone
marrow transplant and the other is currently being managed. Other two
cases had its diagnosis reviewed and modified to B-cell lymphoma
Virchows Arch
unclassifiable, one patient died due to progression of the disease and the
other had an effective response to treatment.
Conclusion: Hodgkin lymphoma remains a neoplasia with great overall
survival mainly at paediatric age. In our series, we conclude that it is
necessary to review some cases when treatment is not effective because
it might be present overlapping morphological and immunophenotype
features that represent exceedingly difficult cases, resulting as B-cell lym-
phoma unclassifiable.
Recurrent disease and immunosuppression related to treatment also rep-
resented defiant cases in our study, however, the majority of patients
remain relapse free after treatment, as expected.

*Pathology Department, Portuguese Institute of Oncology - Porto FG,
EPE (IPO-Porto), Portugal
Background & objectives: Hepatoblastoma, the most common primary
malignant liver tumour in children, occurs mainly in the first three years
of life, being associated with good survival rates. Since some subsets are
not responsive to therapy, understanding predictors of tumour behaviour
is mandatory.
Methods: Clinicopathologic features of 17 patients diagnosed with
hepatoblastoma at Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto (1999-2021)
were reviewed. Material was composed of liver biopsies (n=14), and
resection specimens (n=15) of primary tumour, as well as recurrence/
metastatic resection specimens (n=10). Besides the descriptive results
stated below, we further aim to correlate detailed histological findings
with tumour behaviour and clinical outcome.
Results: Mean age at presentation was 2.78 years (range:0.35-8.1) and
male:female ratio of 1.43:1. Most patients presented with abdominal
mass, fever and/or abdominal pain. AFP was increased in the majority
of cases. One with normal AFP was diagnosed with SCUD subtype. AFP
decreased in all patients after treatment. Two carried APC gene
mutations.
Hepatoblastomas were classified as epithelial (47%) or mixed epithelial
and mesenchymal (53%). Most common patterns were foetal (29,4%) and
mixed foetal and embryonal(37%); one SCUD and one macrotrabecular
case were identified. 23.5% had extramedullary hematopoiesis.
Heterologous elements present in 53%.
Metastasis occured in 23,5%; persistence in 5,8%. Survival rates were
92% at 5-years and 77% at 10-years follow-up.
Conclusion: Our data is in accordance with the literature, mostly dem-
onstrating good survival rates, primarily due to therapeutical improve-
ment. However, prognostic factors are still limited and mainly dependent
on clinical and imagiology factors, with limited pathology input. Due to
the rarity of disease, large multicentric collaborative studies are essential
to identify potential molecular markers and pathological features that
could predict tumour behaviour and improve even further therapy success
or develop targeted therapy strategies.

*Pathology Department, Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Centro
Hospitalar e Universitário Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Small-for-gestational age placentas com-
prises placentas whose weight is below 10th percentile and they are
correlated with various risk factors, most of them of maternal cause.
Our work attempt to characterize the maternal clinical conditions and
correlate with macroscopic/microscopic findings.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 418 singleton placentas from the
last year, excluding those which weight was above 10th percentile or
below 20+6 week gestational (WG) age. In those cases, we reviewed
maternal history, macroscopic and histologic report and if there was an
associated foetal autopsy.
Results: We obtained 137 small placentas (33%), with mean of 35WG
age; eighteen with autopsies (11 stillbirths; 7 medical termination of preg-
nancy). Only 19 cases were concomitant with foetal weight
<10thpercentile. Median maternal age was 32 years old (range 16-45 years
old), most of them were healthy (52cases - 38%). The large number of cases
were placentas with weight below 3rd percentile (102cases - 75%), the
majority were healthy mothers followed by the group with multiple pathol-
ogies. The most frequent histologic features in the first group was maternal
malperfusion (38%). Ten cases had no prior maternal history and no path-
ological findings; one was from an autopsy due to genetic alterations.
Conclusion: There are several well-known risk factors associated with
small-for-gestational age placentas, the majority associated with maternal
malperfusion; and our results are concordant. In 7.29% of the cases there
were no clear reasons for placenta's low weight, not even maternal histo-
ry, which suggests other factors may play a role. Despite some risk factors
can be manageable, cases still exist with increased risk of foetal morbidity
and foetal mortality.

Skin lesions in children: evaluation of clinicopathological findings
B. Calim Gurbuz*, B. Pehlivanoglu, T. Soylemez Akkurt
*Basaksehir Cam and Sakura City Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Paediatric skin diseases may show various
manifestations, occasionally affecting the patients’ quality of life.
Histopathological examination may be required for the diagnosis. The
aim of this study was to evaluate the spectrum of clinicopathological
features in paediatric skin lesions.
Methods: A total of 180 biopsies of 171 consecutive patients were
included. The clinicopathological findings were retrospectively evaluat-
ed and retrieved from clinical and pathological data. Neoplastic/
proliferative lesions (NPLs) (n=97) were grouped per their origin while
non-neoplastic (inflammatory) lesions (ILs) (n=83) were grouped based
on their pattern. The clinical and histopathological characteristics were
statistically analysed.
Results: 53% were male and median age was 10±4.9 y.o. (range 0-17).
ILs mainly involved the head and neck while NPLs were predominantly
located in lower extremity (p=0.001). The most common NPLs were
benign nevus (23%, n=22) and pilomatrixoma (15%, n=15). The most
frequent IL was spongiotic/psoriasiform dermatitis (45%). The mean di-
ameter of NPLs was 2.3 cm, connective tissue/skin appendage tumours
being the largest (p=0.02). Melanocytic lesions and cutaneous cysts were
significantly more common in children >12 y.o. (p<0.05). Juvenile
xanthogranuloma occurred only in children <6 y.o. Only one patient
had histopathological findings suspicious for mycosis fungoides. The
discordance rate between clinical and histopathological diagnoses was
higher for ILs (32% vs.21%).
Conclusion: Although the spectrum of skin lesions is very broad in
paediatric patients, most are benign in nature. The higher frequency
of melanocytic and/or cystic lesions among children >12 years old
may be attributed to increased self-care during puberty. Neoplastic/
proliferative lesions seem to be more easily and accurately recog-
nized by clinicians. However, multidisciplinary approach remains to
be the optimal method in diagnosis of skin lesions among children,
considering the relatively high rate of discordance between the clin-
ical and histopathological diagnoses.

A multi-modality approach for biopsy-based diagnostic and prognos-
tic prediction in early-stage lung adenocarcinomas
J. Wolf*, T. Trandafir, D. Mustafa, E. Andrinopoulou, M. Kros, A.
Dingemans, A. Stubbs, J. von der Thüsen
*Department of Pathology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Lung adenocarcinomas are variable in mor-
phology and genetics. In resected tumours, these parameters correlate
with prognosis and development of metastases. Deriving as much infor-
mation from a biopsy as possible could facilitate an early stratification of
patients for therapy and follow-up.
Methods: 200 patients with stage I and II adenocarcinomas were retro-
spectively included. Specimens (biopsies n=200; paired resections
n=125) were evaluated for growth pattern, nuclear grade, fibrosis, inflam-
mation and genomic alterations. Findings were compared using non-
parametric testing for categorical variables. Model performance was
assessed using the area under the curve for biopsies and resection speci-
mens and overall and progression free survival calculated.
Results: The overall growth pattern concordance between biopsies and
resections was 69.6%. Nuclear grade and degree of fibrosis correlated
with different types of growth pattern and had higher scores in paired
resections. EGFR mutations and MET exon 14 skipping mutations were
mainly found in lepidic predominant tumours. The dominant growth
pattern correlated with overall and progression free survival in resected
adenocarcinomas but not in biopsies. We further demonstrated similar
findings for nuclear grade and amount of fibrosis. Model performance
for the prediction of overall and progression free survival using all avail-
able information from biopsy specimens only was poor and resulted in an
average AUC of 0.58 and 0.57 respectively.
Conclusion: Our data confirm the prognostic relevance of growth pattern
and nuclear grade in resected adenocarcinomas. We further demonstrated
that the amount of fibrosis may predict overall and progression free sur-
vival. Contrary to our hypothesis, we could not confirm these findings for
biopsy specimens. Combining all biopsy specimen information did not
improve prediction of overall and progression free survival. For daily
practice, more robust (bio)markers are needed in biopsies to predict prog-
nosis and stratify patients for therapy and follow-up.

Different types of immune system regulations in severe Coronavirus
disease 2019

*Medical University Graz, Austria
Background & objectives: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a
severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-
2). While most patients exhibit mild or moderate symptoms, approxi-
mately 10-20 % progress to severe disease and 0.5-1 % of infected die.
Methods: To gain insight into the immune mechanisms underlying
Covid-19 related lung damage a systematic, pathological and whole tran-
scriptome analysis of autopsy materials was done collected from lung
samples of 20 individuals, who died from Covid-19. These were com-
pared to 13 patients from a different hospital, and reports on patients from
South America for differences in the type of immune reaction.
Results: Distinct pathological and molecular signatures were observed,
characterized by different stages of diffuse alveolar damage and dissemi-
nated intravascular coagulation with hyperinflammation, enabling stratifi-
cation of the deceased individuals. CD4+ lymphocytes predominated dur-
ing the early inflammation stages, in part expressing a memory signature.
Natural killer cells (NK) and B lymphocytes were absent. Upregulation of
the JAK3-STAT1-cGas-Sting-IL6 pathway was identified. This pathway
upregulates class one interferons, and prolongs inflammation, and can ac-
tivate coagulation by platelets. Genes involved in enhanced production of
cGAS and stability of cGAS and STING were upregulated in Covid-19
cases. Downregulation of cytokines regulated by vitamin D (VitD) was also
found, pointing to a potential role for VitD deficiency.
Conclusion: This integrated, multi-tiered analysis of autopsy mate-
rials provides insight into the lethal manifestation of Covid-19. It
allowed to separate patients prone to disseminated intravascular co-
agulation from those with a classical respiratory viral pneumonia
such as SARS-Cov1.

EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer transformation into
small-cell lung cancer after tyrosine kinase inhibitors: let us think
about liquid biopsy!
F. Pezzuto*, F. Fortarezza, F. Lunardi, V. Tauro, S. Frega, G. Pasello, F.
Calabrese
*University of Padova, Italy
Background & objectives: Tirosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are
employed extensively in mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
showing an indisputable benefit on tumour response. However, disease
progression always occurs after approximately 9–12 months of treatment
due to different mechanisms of resistance.
Methods: Herein, we describe two cases diagnosed as lung adeno-
carcinoma harbouring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mu-
tations and treated by TKI with clinical benefit for a short time. In
each case, liquid biopsy and subsequent transbronchial biopsy per-
formed at the time of disease progression were processed by molec-
ular analysis.
Results: CASE 1: A 39-year-old male nonsmoker with lung adenocarci-
noma, harbouring an EGFR exon 19-deletion mutation was treated with
Erlotinib. At recurrence after two years, a liquid biopsy detected the
T790M mutation, switching the treatment to Osimertinib. After two
months of unresponsiveness to Osimertinib, a re-biopsy was carried
out. CASE 2: A 63-year-old female nonsmoker with lung adenocarcino-
ma, harbouring an EGFR exon 19-deletion mutation, was treated with
Osimertinib. After a short period of clinical benefit, the patient underwent
liquid biopsy and an EGFR wild type was found without any resistant
mutant form. The mass was then re-biopsied. In both cases, the re-biopsy
showed a switch to small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC).
Conclusion: Several mechanisms of resistance can affect TKI treatment,
most commonly the acquisition of new mutations that overcome and/or
bypass the inhibition of the specific molecular pathway and/or the histo-
logical transformation into more aggressive forms (e.g. SCLC). At the
present time, “tissue is the solution”: histological analysis should be con-
sidered the first choice, whenever possible. Currently, liquid biopsy is
indeed unable to detect any histotype switch thus delaying alternative
treatments.

Oncogene driver testing in surgically early/locally advanced non-
small-cell lung cancer: a single centre experience
F. Pezzuto*, F. Lunardi, F. Fortarezza, M.J. Acosta, M. Lorenzi, E.
Faccioli, F. Rea, G. Pasello, F. Calabrese
*University of Padova, Italy
Background & objectives: Oncogene driver screening in advanced non-
small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a standard in practice in molecular
pathology. Herein, we describe our experience of biomarker screening in
surgically resected early/locally advanced NSCLC, whose molecular sta-
tus is presently largely unknown.
Virchows Arch
Methods: The study included naïve surgically resected NSCLC cases
consecutively recruited at the University Hospital of Padova (from 2017
to 2018; adenocarcinoma, stage I-IIIA). Must oncogene drivers, EGFR
gene alterations, ALK/ROS1 translocations, and PDL-1 tissue expression
were analysed in all cases. After surgery patients were treated with adju-
vant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy as opportune. Data on follow-up
and treatments were collected.
Results: Ninety-five cases (55 males, 40 females, median age: 70
years) were studied. Four cases were ALK translocated (4%).
Eighteen cases (19%) showed EGFR gene alterations in exons 18
(1 case), 19 (9 cases), 21 (6 cases), and in both 18 and 20 (2 cases).
In 6 of them (30%) PD-L1 was positive (tumour proportion score
>1%). At the average follow-up (45 months), 31 patients (33%)
showed an adverse event: death in 16 (17%) cases and disease recur-
rence in 15 (16%) cases, also in stage I (13 out of 31, 42%). Four of
them (13%) had an oncogene driver alteration.
Conclusion: Molecular analysis of oncogene drivers in surgically
resected NSCLCs, whose incidence is similar to that of advanced
stages, will be an additional important task for pathologists. This
is reinforced by successful data obtained from the recent trial that
demonstrated a benefit of adjuvant target therapy in completely
resected EGFR mutation-positive NSCLCs (Wu et al, NEJM,
2020). Oncogene driver alterations and PDL-1 analysis in resected
NSCLC may allow a better prognostic stratification, ensuring the
administration of the most effective targeted treatments.

Lower gene expression of angiotension-converting enzyme 2 receptor
in lung tissues of smokers with COVID-19 pneumonia

Rossato, R. Vettor, A.M. Cattelan, C. Del Vecchio, A. Crisanti, P.
Navalesi, D. Gregori, F. Calabrese
*University of Padova, Italy
Background & objectives: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2)
is the main cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and plays a critical role in
causing COVID-19. The role of smoking is controversial, thus we corre-
lated lung ACE-2 expression with several data to explore susceptibility to
infection.
Methods: This is a retrospective observational study on 29 consecutive
COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed autopsies performed at the University
Hospital of Padova from March to October 2020. SARS-CoV-2 genome
and ACE-2 mRNA expression were evaluated by Real-Time polymerase
chain reaction in lung tissue samples obtained from all patients and cor-
related with several clinical/pathological data with main focus on
smoking habit.
Results: Smoking habit was shown to be less frequent in high than
low ACE-2 expressors (14% vs 67%, p=0.014). Bayesian logistic
regression including smoking, age, gender, hypertension, and virus
quantity confirmed that smoking was the most probable risk factor
associated with low ACE-2 expression. A direct linear relation was
found between viral quantity and ACE-2 expression (p=0.028). No
other significant differences were found when ACE-2 expression
was correlated with remaining clinical data. Finally, considering
morphological features, high ACE-2 expressors showed more fre-
quently a prevalent pattern of vascular injury than low expressors
(56% vs 31%, p=0.049).
Conclusion: In conclusion, ACE-2 levels were decreased in the lung
tissue of smokers with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These results point
out complex biological interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE-2
particularly concerning the aspect of smoking habit and need larger pro-
spective case series and translational studies.
Funding: This research was partially supported by a fellowship from the
University of Padova/Intesa San Paolo Vita bank (2020A08).

*Sechenov University, Russia
Background & objectives: Lungs are the main portal of entry for
COVID-19.
Methods: Study was performed on lung tissue from 232 autopsy patients
withCOVID-19confirmedbyPCRduringlifeand/orbyexaminingparaffin
blocks of lung tissue. Conducted macro-, microscopic and immunohisto-
chemical (IHC) analysis (CD3, CD20, TLR4, TLR9, ki67, р6З, OCT4,
ALDH1) revealed the particularities of pathological changes in the lungs.
Results: Morphological examination revealed diffuse alveolar damage
(DAD)(in86%ofcases);disseminatedcoagulopathyinallcaseswiththrom-
bosis or thromboembolism of the pulmonary artery and haemorrhagic in-
farctsandhaemorrhages; lymphocytic alveolitiswithconcomitant vasculitis
of medium- and small-calibre pulmonary arterial branches in 92 %, viral-
bacterial pneumonia (20%), interstitial fibrosis (10%), and disregeneration
changesofthelungepithelium.IHCshowedhighexpressionofCD3,CD20,
TLR4, TLR9 in inflammatory infiltrate in all cases; low or negative ex-
pression of ki67, р6З, OCT4, ALDH1 in foci of disregeneration.
Conclusion: Discussed pathological processes in lung tissue may be
considered as stages of COVID-19 progression. The process in the lungs
can develop along three morphogenetic pathways, starting with the de-
velopment of DAD or lymphocytic alveolitis, or coagulopathy. The latter
variant of the onset of infection is most likely associated with intestinal
portal of entry. Wherein lung damage is secondary, and develops after
viremia, disseminated intravascular coagulation and cytokine storm.

Transthoracic fine needle aspiration and clot core biopsies of pulmo-
nary spindle and mesenchymal lesions: a Pandora’s box
K. Kaur*, T. Patel, P. Trivedi
*Gujarat cancer and research institute, India
Background & objectives: Pulmonary spindle cell and mesenchymal le-
sions represent a significant group of heterogeneous neoplasms with differ-
entials ranging from benign to malignant lesions. This study highlights the
role of FNAC and clot core biopsy in diagnosis of spindle-cell lesions in lung.
Methods: Present study is a retrospective study in which lung FNA with
spindle and mesenchymal cells from 2015-2020 were retrieved from cy-
topathology archives and reviewed. Granulomatous lesions, FNA from
mediastinum and chest wall were excluded. In our institute, fine-needle
aspiration (FNA) cytology was the first material available while final
diagnosis was rendered on clot core and IHC.
Results: 60 cases of FNA lung having spindle and mesenchymal cells as
key morphological feature were identified. Six (10.0%) benign and fifty-
four cases (90%) malignancies including 23 primary and 31 metastasis on
clot core and IHC. FNA was paucicellular in 12 cases, reported as benign
in 8 cases and malignant in 52 cases. One case of pulmonary blastoma
was reported as inflammatory pseudotumour on cytology, other case of
chondrosarcoma was reported as chondroid tumour. Most common pri-
mary malignancies sarcomatoid carcinoma and most common metastasis
was malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour. A single case of alveolar
soft part sarcoma, epitheloid sarcoma and neuroblastoma arising in a
teratoma were also identified.
Conclusion: FNA along with clot core plays a pivotal role in the subse-
quent pathway taken for diagnostic or therapeutic management of these
patients.

Virchows Arch
*Marmara University School of Medicine, Department of Pathology,
Istanbul, Turkey
Background & objectives: The use of PD-L1 immune-checkpoint in-
hibitors in NSCLC has marked an era. Testing for PD-L1 expression of
NSCLC is widely used, there may be inconsistencies between different
immunohistochemical assays, moreover, between different observers. In
this study, we aimed to measure inter-pathologist variability.
Methods: Pathological specimens that were diagnosed with NSCLC be-
tween 2017-2021 and had enough tumour tissue to stain with two clones
were included to study. According to the percentage of positive tumour cells
detected in each PD-L1 clone , semi-quantitative scoring was performed by
two pathologists individually and blindly. Cohen’s kappa analysis was per-
formed to measure consistency between two pathologists, EB and SB.
Results: There were 19 female and 83 male patients, with an average age
of 63.25 years. Of the 102 cases 47(46%) were small biopsy, 37(36,2%) as
resection and 7(6,8%) as cytology. The distributions of SP263 and E1L3N
scoring of EB and SB were as the following (respectively): for 1% cut-off
negative n=15/18 and n=20/34 and positive n=87/84 and n=82/68, for 50%
cut-off negative n=15/18 and n=44/62 and positive n=87/84 and n=58/40.
Interobserver agreement for the two clones, at 1% cut-off, agreement was
82,4%,for E1L3N and 93% for SP263, respectively (Cohen κ:0,55 and
0,76, respectively); at 50% cut-off, agreement was 91.2%and 86,3% for
E1L3N and SP263, respectively (Cohen κ:0,81 and 0,72, respectively).
Conclusion: The highest interobserver variability was observed for the
≥1% cut-off for positivity in assessment of NSCLC tissues stained by
E1L3N clone. We have shown a substantial to almost perfect interobserv-
er agreement in evaluating PD-L1 using SP263 for any cut-off value, and
a substantial agreement in evaluating PD-L1 using E1L3N clones when
we used ≥50% cut-off for positivity.

MUC4 and GATA3 immunohistochemical staining in the diagnosis
of sarcomatoid mesotheliomas: Case series of 5 patients with clinical
and pathologic correlation, and literature review
P. Gil Bernabe*, J. Martín López, G. Silvestre Egea, J.L. Rodríguez
Carrillo, D. García Fresnadillo, C. Salas Antón
*Hospital Universitario, Spain
Background & objectives: Diagnosing mesotheliomas is challenging,
especially sarcomatoid subtype, which poses a differential morphological
diagnosis with sarcomatoid carcinomas (SC) and sarcomas, and usually
lacks positive effusions. GATA3 and MUC4 expression has been de-
scribed as useful in the diagnosis of sarcomatoid mesothelioma (SM).
Methods: We studied 5 cases, previously diagnosed as SM based on
clinical and pathological criteria, between 2014 and 2020. Confirmation
was made with, at least two mesothelial markers (calretinin, WT1 or D2-
40) and two epithelial markers (BerEP4 and MOC31) in addition to,
GATA3 (clone L50-823), BAP1 (clone C-4), MUC4 (clone SP241, with
external control), EMA, Desmin and CKAE1-AE3 on complete sections.
Results: All cases were male, with ages ranging between 56-84 years at
diagnosis. Different presentation forms were seen: pleural masses (3),
pleuro-pulmonary nodule (1) or pleural nodule (1) with combined hemo-
thorax (1) or pleural effusion (4). None had positive pleural effusions.
Diagnosis was made by transthoracic core needle biopsy (2) or
videothoracoscopic biopsy (3).
Three showed focal positive immunostaining for epithelial markers
(EMA or CKAE1-AE3) and two showed focal positivity or complete loss
for mesothelial markers (calretinin, WT1, D2-40).
GATA3 expression was found in all cases (5/5). No obvious immuno-
staining for MUC4 could be demonstrated (0/5), while up to 40% of
sarcomatoid carcinomas are described as MUC4 positive.
Conclusion: Several risk factors were identified, such as smoking history
(4/5), prolonged asbestos occupational exposure (1/5) and working in
construction (2/5). All SM (100%) expressed GATA3 staining (only focal
and weakly in two of them), what suggests that GATA3 is a very sensitive
immunohistochemical marker, for the integrated clinical-radiological di-
agnosis of these neoplasms. Negativity for MUC4 does not exclude
sarcomatoid carcinoma, requiring additional techniques (BAP1, homozy-
gous deletion of P16 / CDKN2A, GATA3) to confirm/rule out MS.

The bronchoalveolar lavage in COVID-19 acute respiratory failure:
the role of pathologist
F. Fortarezza*, F. Pezzuto, F. Lunardi, A. Boscolo, N. Sella, E. Serra, P.
Navalesi, F. Calabrese
*University of Padova, Italy
Background & objectives: The occurrence of respiratory superinfections
represents an additional risk factor for fatal outcome in COVID-19 patients.
In this study we evaluate the role of the cytological examination of the bron-
choalveolar lavage (BAL) in a cohort of patients with severe COVID-19.
Methods: BAL from 10 mechanically ventilated patients were collected
following one of these criteria: radiology discordant from typical COVID-
19 pneumonia; immunosuppression; no improvement after 10 days of ven-
tilation; microbiological testssuspectedfor superinfection. For each case the
followingparameterswereevaluated:adequacy;quantificationoftheinflam-
matorycellsandlipid-ladenmacrophagesindex(LLMI); presenceof micro-
organisms,hyperplasticpneumocytes,erythrocytes,necroticmaterial,fibrin.
Results: Ten millilitres of liquid were used to prepare cytological smears
and cytoblock. Nine out the ten samples were adequate (upper airway con-
taminants <7%). Fungal hyphae (two morphologically compatible with
Candida spp and one with Aspergillus spp) were detected in three cases
through the special stains (i.e. PAS, Grocott). The LLMI was high (300)
in a patient in whom a lung aspiration was subsequently confirmed. The
remaining cases showed variable increases in neutrophilic granulocytes,
hyperplastic pneumocytes, fibrin or necrotic material. These latter features
are compatible with diffuse alveolar damage, due to SARS-CoV-2
infection.
Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic still represents a worldwide san-
itary challenge, particularly regarding the severe forms characterized by
acute respiratory distress syndrome. The occurrence of respiratory super-
infections represents an additional risk factor for fatal outcome. The cy-
tological evaluation of the BAL could represent an important surrogate of
biopsy to investigate pathological lesions of the deep lung compartment
in these severely compromised patients.

PD-L1 expression in squamous cell lung carcinoma in small biopsy
specimens
J. Džambas*, I. Aleksic
*Faculty of Medicine Military Medical Academy Belgrade, Serbia
Background & objectives: Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is a
predictive marker for immunotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer, in-
cluding squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC). The aim of this study is deter-
mining immunohistochemical PD-L1 expression in patients with SqCC
in small biopsy specimens.
Methods: There were 50 patients in this retrospective study. All the
patients were diagnosed SqCC on small biopsy specimens sampled dur-
ing bronchoscopy and confirmed on histologic material after surgical
resection. Small biopsy samples were stained immunohistochemically
with PD-L1 clone 28-8 antibody. Membranous PD-L1 expression on
tumour cells was evaluated and positivity was considered when expres-
sion was in more than 1% cells.
Results: Among patients 86% were male and 14% female. 52% were
smokers, 30% were former and 18% were non-smokers. Small-biopsy
samples of 26% patients were PD-L1 positive and 12% had histological
type in surgical specimen with- and 14% without keratinization. Most of
Virchows Arch
patients with PD-L1 positivity ,76.92% were male and 23.08% were
female. The majority of patients were former smokers (53.85%), follow-
ing smokers (30.77%) and non-smokers (15.38%). There was no statisti-
cally significant difference neither between gender (p=0.522) nor differ-
ent histological types of SqCC (p=0.624) between patients with PD-L1
positive and negative specimens. There was statistically significant dif-
ference between smoking habits of patients with PD-L1 positive and
negative specimens (p=0.042).
Conclusion: PD-L1 expression was positive in about one quarter of pa-
tients with squamous cell lung carcinoma. PD-L1 expression in squa-
mous cell lung carcinoma is linked to smoking habits and has no connec-
tion neither with histological type in surgical specimens of tumour nor
with gender.

Evaluation of STING immunohistochemistry as a potential biomark-
er to predict immunotherapy efficiency in lung non small cell
carcinoma

*Normandie Univ, UNIROUEN, INSERM U1245 and Rouen University
Hospital, Department of Pathology, F76000, Normandy Centre for
Genomic and Personalized Medicine, Rouen, France
Background & objectives: STING (STimulating INterferon Gene) plays
a key role in anti-tumoral immune response. PD-L1 is an imperfect bio-
marker for immunotherapies. Our objective was to evaluate STING im-
munohistochemical expression in non small cell lung carcinoma as a
biomarker to predict pembrolizumab efficacy.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study on 56 patients treated in
our institution by pembrolizumab as first line monotherapy. These pa-
tients had a locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with TPS PD-L1 >
50%. STING immunhistochemistry was evaluated on tumoral cells and
on tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). Pembrolizumab efficiency was
assessed using the CT scan for patient follow-up.
Results: STING expression by the tumoral cell was heterogenous: 21
samples dysplayed no STING expression, 3 dysplayed strong expression
32 weak to moderate. In most cases TIL dysplayed weak to moderate
STING expression. We did not observe any statistically significant cor-
relation between tumoral STING expression and clinical response to
pembrolizumab. There was no correlation between TIL STING expres-
sion and clinical response. Importantly, according to current
recommandations, all patients treated by pembrolizumab as first line
monotherapy dysplayed high PD-L1 expression. This PD-L1 high
immuno-expression in our patients could induce a bias explaining our
results.
Conclusion: Although pre-clinical studies tend to show a correlation
between STING expression by tumoral cells and clinical efficiency of
immune check point inhibitors (ICI), we found no correlation between
STING immunohistochemical expression and response to
pembrolizumab. Considering, the small number of patients studied, en-
larging this study to patient with other ICI treatment protocols could be
interesting.

Detection of MDM2 gene amplification on tissue microarray-based
fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) in well-differentiated and
dedifferentiated liposarcomas, displaying a wide morphological spec-
trum: a validation study
B. Rekhi*, N. Karnik, O. Shetty, S. Patkar
*Tata Memorial Hospital, India
Background & objectives: Liposarcomas, including atypical lipomatous
tumour(ALT)/well-differentiated liposarcomas(WDLPS) and
dedifferentiated liposarcoma(DDLPS) display a histomorphological
spectrum with their several diagnostic mimics. MDM2 gene amplifica-
tion characterizes ALT/WDLPS and as well as DDLPS. This study was
conducted to validate MDM2 gene testing in these tumours.
Methods: Twenty-eight cases, diagnosed as ALT/WDLPS(n=5) and
DDLPS(n=23), along with 10 other tumours were tested for MDM2 gene
amplification, using fluorescence in-situ hybridization FISH) on tissue mi-
croarrays (TMAs). Fourteen cases, diagnosed as ALT/WDLPS and
DDLPS, along with 49 other tumours were tested for MDM2 (IF2 clone)
immunostaining. Twenty tumours were tested for p16INK4a
immunostaining.
Results: FISH was interpretable in 25(89.2%) cases. Among 20 cases
diagnosed as DDLPSs, 19 displayed MDM2 gene amplification. Among
5 cases diagnosed as ALT/WDLPS, four showed MDM2 gene amplifica-
tion. Finally, 19 cases were confirmed as DDLPS and 4 as ALT/WDLPS.
Furthermore, 7/19 cases, confirmed as DDLPS and all 4 cases as ALT/
WDLPS, tested for MDM2 immunostaining, displayed its diffuse
immunoexpression, while a DDLPS showed its focal immunostaining.
None of the 49 controls displayed diffuse MDM2 immunoexpression.
ALL 16 DDLPSs and 4 ALTs/WDLPSs displayed p16INK4a immuno-
staining. Sensitivity for diffuse MDM2 immunostaining was 87.5% and
specificity was 100%. The sensitivity for MDM2 gene amplification was
94.7%. Sensitivity for p16INK4a was 100%.
Conclusion: This constitutes the first sizable study on MDM2 testing in
ALT/WDLPS and DDLPS from our subcontinent, using TMAs. MDM2
gene amplification testing is the diagnostic gold standard for
ALTs/WDLPSs and DDLPSs, particularly during diagnostic dilemmas.
Diffuse MDM2 and p16INK4a immunostaining, together seem useful for
triaging cases for FISH.

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: ten years’ experience of a
Portuguese tertiary institution
D. Gigliano*, A. Coutada, J. Vaz Silva, J. Azevedo, J. Vieira, M. Afonso
*IPO-PORTO, Portugal
Background & objectives: Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is
a mesenchymal neoplasm, characterised by locally aggressive growth,
frequent recurrences, and extremely rare metastases. We aimed to assess
the clinicopathologic features of all DFSPs diagnosed at our hospital in
the last 10 years.
Methods: A retrospective search of our database yielded a total of 68
DFSPs, diagnosed at our institution from 2011 to 2020. All cases were
reviewed clinicopathologically (including age, size and site of tumour,
morphology, surgical margins status, number of local recurrences and
distant metastases) and submitted to FISH analysis.
Results: Median age was 43.5 years (range 1-77) and male-to-female
ratio was 1.48:1. There was marked predilection for the trunk (62.7%),
with the remainder cases affecting limbs (23.9%) and head and neck
(13.4%). Median tumour size was 2.35cm (range 0,7-24). The cohort
included cases with classic morphology (54.4%), fibrosarcomatous trans-
formation (29.4%), melanin pigmentation (7.4%), myxoid change (3.0%)
and/or myoid nodules (3.0%). Hybrid morphology (DFSP with areas of
giant cell fibroblastoma) represented 8.8% of cases. Surgical margins
were positive in 40.3%. Local recurrence was seen in 53.0%, with mul-
tiple relapses in 13,2%. Distant metastasis occurred in one case of
fibrosarcomatous DFSP (1.48%). COL1A1 gene rearrangements were
identified in 95.5%.
Conclusion: Being aware of the wide morphological spectrum of DFSP
is necessary for a correct diagnosis. In harmony with literature, and prob-
ably due to the difficulty of achieving negative margins, recurrence rates
were remarkably high in our cohort, while distant metastases were excep-
tional. COL1A1 gene rearrangements were present in the vast majority of
Virchows Arch
cases. FISH analysis provided valuable information for the diagnosis in
challenging cases.

Clinicopathological features of dermatofibrossarcoma protuberans
treated with Imatinib
E. Dvindenko*, F. Santos
*Instituto Português de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Portugal
Background & objectives: Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is
a fibroblastic neoplasm carrying a COL1A1-PDGFB fusion and often
presenting with multiple recurrences. Although surgery remains the stan-
dard treatment, the recent introduction of Imatinib as a treatment option
has shown significant activity against locally advanced DFSP.
Methods: We retrospectively assessed five cases of DFSP diagnosed and
treated with Imatinib in our institution from 2010 to 2020. We reviewed the
medical records regarding demographics, clinical and radiologic features of
the tumour, treatment course and clinical response. Histological findings
from pre and post-Imatinib treatment surgical and biopsy specimens were
reviewed and morphological treatment response was recorded.
Results: All patients were male. Median age was 50 years (range 27-53).
All underwent treatment with Imatinib 400mg. Clinical reduction in tu-
mour size was seen in all cases. Fibrossarcomatous DFSP was diagnosed
in 3 patients, with COL1A1-PDGFB fusion detected in 2. One of these
cases showed significant response with hipocellularity, hyalinization, fi-
brosis, necrosis, chronic inflammation and hemosiderin deposition. Two
fibrossarcomatous cases had poor responses. The two remaining cases of
conventional DFSP showed partial response with areas of
hypocellularity, hyalinization and fibrosis, with focal residual tumour.
Four patients are alive and disease-free after a median of 46.4-months
follow-up and one patient died with metastatic disease
Conclusion: DFSP often presents with unresectable tumours. Some cases
benefit from adjuvant treatment with Imatinib, showing clinical responses
and allowing surgical resection with wider margins. Scarce data is avail-
able regarding histological features of treated DFSP. Most cases show
areas of hypocellularity, myxoid stroma, fibrosis, hyalinization and ne-
crosis, with variable foci of viable tumour. Larger series of treated DFSP
are needed in order to validate an adequate and standardized evaluation
system of histological treatment response.

Angiosarcoma of the breast: a single institution experience
A. Coutada*, S. Carvalho, D. Gigliano, J. Vaz Silva, J. Azevedo, R.
Isidoro, B. Ferreira, A. Ferreira, S. Conde, C. Leal, M. Afonso
*Pathology Department of the Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto,
Portugal
Background & objectives: Breast angiosarcoma is a rare tumour. It may
occur de novo, as a complication of prior radiotherapy for breast cancer or
in association with chronic lymphedema (Stewart-Treves syndrome).
Herein we describe a single institution experience over the past 20 years.
Methods: Retrospective analysis of all cases diagnosed at Portuguese
Oncology Institute of Porto between 2000-2020. Evaluation of clinico-
pathologic features, including age at diagnosis of breast cancer and
angiosarcoma, interval between radiotherapy and diagnosis of
angiosarcoma, treatment rendered for each neoplasm and time from di-
agnosis of angiosarcoma to death. Tumour size and grade, number of
local recurrences and metastasis were also assessed.
Results: Twenty cases were identified: 4 primary angiosarcoma (PAS)
and 16 secondary angiosarcoma (SAS), 2 associated with Stewart-Treves
syndrome. Median age (41 years vs 70 years) was lower in PAS and
median tumour size (5.85cm vs 4.3cm) was higher. The vast majority
of tumours (n= 17) were high grade. Median time from radiation to SAS
diagnosis was 6.3 years. Total mastectomy was the main surgical treat-
ment. Follow-up (median, 18.5 months) revealed that 4 patients (3 SAS)
recurred locally, 6 patients (4 SAS) had distant metastasis, and 11 patients
(9 SAS) died of disease, on average, 20 months after diagnosis. Median
overall survival: 29 months for PAS and 18 months for SAS.
Conclusion: Breast angiosarcoma is an aggressive tumour with poor
long-term prognosis. Primary tumours occur in younger patients.
Secondary tumours are more frequent and the incidence of radiation-
associated angiosarcomas seems to be increasing. The results of our series
are similar to those described in the literature.

An international validation study of automated cancer detection in
prostate biopsies
Y. Tolkach*, V. Ovtcharov, A. Pryalukhin, W. Hulla, M. Eich, P. Caie, E.
Runde, R. Büttner
*University Hospital Cologne, Germany
Background & objectives: Digital pathology provides an opportunity
for computational analysis of histological slides and the standardized
automation of some pathological tasks. In this retrospective study, we
validate a deep learning-based tool for prostate cancer detection from
patient biopsy samples.
Methods: A prostate cancer detection tool was developed and imple-
mented in HALO AI® and HALO AP® software (Indica Labs,
Albuquerque, US). Two external validation cohorts of patients with mul-
tifocal prostate biopsy were analysed: Cohort 1/Dataset 1 (n full cases =
65) digitized by Hamamatsu S360, Cohort 2 (n = 57) digitized by
Hamamatsu S360 (Dataset 2) and Leica GT450 (Dataset 3).
Results: Similar high accuracy metrics were received for all three datasets
implying good generalization among cases from different institutes and
digitized by different scanner systems. For Dataset 1, Dataset 2, and
Dataset 3, respectively: the negative predictive value was 0.99, 0.98,
and 0.97; sensitivity was 0.97, 0.94, and 0.91; specificity was 0.93,
0.94, and 0.96; overall accuracy was 0.941, 0.942, and 0.946. Domain
adaptation strategies for institution and scanner system improve the final
accuracies. Several cores were detected where tumour was missed by
pathologists (Cohort 1: n=7, Cohort 2: n=5). The average analysis time
was 1 minute / core in Cohort 1, and 2 minutes / core for Cohort 2.
Conclusion: The prostate cancer detection tool reported high accuracy for
prostate cancer detection in biopsy cases during external validation; inde-
pendent of the institute or scanner used. It is fully integrated into Indica
Labs’ digital pathology platform and can assist pathologists in the form of
pre-screening or quality control during analysis of prostate biopsy cases.

Large cribriform growth pattern does not have additional prognostic
value above small cribriform architecture on prostate cancer
biopsies
L. Rijstenberg*, T. Hansum, C. Kweldam, S. Remmers, M. Roobol-
Bouts, A. Van Leenders
*Department of Pathology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Invasive cribriform and intraductal carcino-
ma (IDC) are associated with adverse features in prostate cancer patients,
with large cribriform fields having the worst outcome in prostatectomies.
Our objective was to determine the impact of large cribriform pattern in
prostate cancer biopsies.
Methods: Aprostatebiopsycohort(n=1887)withlong-termclinicalfollow-
up was reviewed for Grade Group according to the 2014 ISUP guidelines.
Presence of small and large cribriform pattern were monitored, with large
cribriform pattern having at least twice the size of adjacent benign glands.
Virchows Arch
Hazard ratios (HR) for metastasis-free survival and prostate cancer-specific
mortality were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression.
Results: Cribriform growth was found in 280/1887 men: 1.1% in Grade
Group1,18.2%inGradeGroup2,57.1%inGradeGroup3,55.4%inGrade
Group4and59.3%inGradeGroup5.Largecribriformgrowthwasfoundin
47/1887 men: 0.5% in Grade Group 2, 9.8% in Grade Group 3, 18.1% in
Grade Group 4 and 17.3% in Grade Group 5. Presence of cribriform growth
showed significantly worse metastasis-free survival (small cribriform/IDC:
HR 3.04; large cribriform: HR 3.17) and prostate cancer-specific mortality
(small cribriform/IDC: HR 4.07; large cribriform: HR 4.13). Large cribri-
form fields did not have additional adverse prognostic value for metastasis-
free survival (P=0.77) or prostate cancer-specific mortality (P=0.96).
Conclusion: We demonstrate that both invasive cribriform and intraductal
carcinoma are associated with worse metastasis-free and disease specific-
free survival in a large prostate biopsy cohort. In contrast to radical prosta-
tectomies, the presence of large cribriform fields does not have additional
adverse prognostic value in prostate biopsies. This discordance could be
explained by cribriform pattern sampling artifacts and limitations of size
estimation on biopsies. Any cribriform growth pattern should therefore be
reported in prostate cancer biopsies without size limitations.

Epigenetics in renal cell tumours – expression patterns of histone
H2AX
M. Zivotic*, D. Dundjerovic, J. Filipovic, G. Nikolic, D. Petrovic, M.
Tubic, K. Ilic, S. Radojevic Skodric
*Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Serbia
Background & objectives: Epigenetic effects have been widely recog-
nized in Renal Cell Tumours (RCT), thus we investigated the expression
of H2AX histone in RCT and its correlation with demographic, clinical
and pathohistological characteristics regarding immunohistochemical
positivity.
Methods: The analysis included a total of 168 RCT (102 clear cell Renal
Cell Carcinomas (RCC), 7 papillary type I RCC, 15 papillary type II
RCC, 23 chromophobe RCC, 5 multilocular-cistic RCC, 6 collecting duct
carcinoma, 10 oncocytomas) and was performed on tissue microarray
slides using H2AX (1:1000, clon ab11175, Abcam) histone.
Results: Expression of H2AX in RCT was variable: in some tumours it
was not detected, while other tumours expressed it in diffuse or focal
patterns. Diffuse patterns were observed among patients with significant-
ly lower mean age (48.1 ± 25.2 years) compared to those with focal (58.6
± 16.2 years) and absent (59.7 ± 14.5 years) patterns, p=0.003. Moreover,
diffuse H2AX expression pattern was frequently associated with high
immunostaining intensity, while focal form mostly exhibited low
H2AX intensity level, p<0.001.
Conclusion: H2AX is decreased with aging, suggesting an involvement
of the current epigenetic mechanism in RCT development without spe-
cific influence on tumour morphology and biological behaviour.

Novel double staining (OCT4/CD34) for the detection of
lymphovascular invasion in OCT4(+) Germ Cell Tumours: technical
aspects, results and future prospective
C. Ricci*, M. Borsato, T. Franceschini, F. Giunchi, M. Fiorentino
*Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine
(DIMES), University of Bologna, Italy
Background & objectives: Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is
prognostically relevant in germ cell tumours (GCT) but studies showed
discrepant results and low agreement with H&E. We tested double
staining (DS) for OCT4/CD34 in GCT, providing the methodological
aspects, the results and its potential implications.
Methods: We retrospectively analysed 25 GCT [15 OCT4(+) and 10
OCT4(-)] diagnosed between January 2019-February 2021 at our
Institution. DS was performed on FFPE, 3-μm-thick sections
(BenchMark ULTRA), with OCT4 stain visualized with DAB and
CD34 one with FastRed. The slides (H&E and DS) were assessed by
two uropathologists (M.F., C.R.) to assess the LVI with the two different
techniques.
Results: Of the 15 OCT4(+) GCT tested, 15 (100%) stained with
OCT4 at DS. Conversely, 0/10 (100%) of the OCT4(-) GCT showed
any nuclear stain at DS. The normal parenchyma [OCT4(-)] and
GCNIS [OCT4(+)] served as internal controls. According to its nature
of “pan-lymphovascular” marker, C34 stained both lymphatic and vas-
cular structures. In all cases, DS showed results superimposable to the
single ones (OCT4 and CD34), with no discrepancies of nuclear and
cytoplasmatic stains. In the groups of OCT4(+) GCT, LVI was detected
in 5/15 (33.3%) and 7/15 (46.7%) cases with H&E and DS, respectively;
as results, one of the latter two changed its pT stage (1b to 2).
Conclusion: In conclusion, DS for OCT4/CD34 showed to be technically
reliable and potentially suitable for the evaluation of LVI in a significant
subgroup of GCT. Future studies on larger case series and with long-term
follow-up are needed to validate its prognostic implications (increase in
the number of cases positive for LVI and so pT2 at TNM staging, with
crucial therapeutic implications) and its effects on inter- and intra-
observer agreement in the LVI assessment of GCT.

Vessels encapsulating tumour clusters (VETC) in renal cell carcino-
ma (RCC). prognostic role and predictive value to tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKI) therapy. A Bayesian retrospective clinico-
pathological study

Colombo, P.A. Zucali
*Humanitas University, Pieve Emanuele, Milan, Italy; IRCCS Humanitas
Research Hospital, Rozzano, Italy
Background & objectives: VETC is a new metastatic mechanism in
HCC where it is prognostic and predictive of sorafenib response. VETC
is also present in RCC. We aim to investigate its prognostic and to model
its predictive to TKI response in RCC.
Methods: To evaluate the overall survival (OS) effect, we included 92
primary RCC from 2005 to 2007 (Surgical-Series) and all RCC patients
treated with first line TKIs at our center (TKI-series; Sunitinib, n=39;
Pazopanib n=17), and recorded the progression free survival (PFS).
VETC was assessed with CD34 immunohistochemistry and defined as
a continuous endothelial lining around tumour clusters.
Results: VETC+ cases had a worse prognosis in the Surgical-Series, with
a posterior probability density (PPD) of median OS of 88 months (mo)
(standard deviation, SD:16mo) for VETC+ Vs 136mo (SD:26mo) for
VETC-; the expected loss of median OS was 48mo (SD:31mo) for
VETC+RCC. Conversely in the TKI-Series, VETC+ showed longer
PFS: Sunitinib had a PPD of median PFS of 35mo (SD:11mo) for
VETC+ Vs 19mo (SD:5mo) for VETC-. Under Pazopanib a PPD of
median PFS of 20mo (SD:8mo) for VETC+ Vs 11mo (SD:7mo) for
VETC-. The expected gain of median PFS for of VETC+RCC, was
17mo and 9mo (SD: 12mo and 9mo), respectively for Sunitinib and
Pazopanib.
Conclusion: Our results confirmed the general adverse prognostic role of
VETC in RCC, however this phenotype gave a substantial PFS gain for
patients treated with TKI, similarly to what have been observed in HCC.
VETC could be a new predictive bio-marker that allows the delivery of a
personalized treatment: patients affected by RCC might directly benefit
from a better selection of already approved drugs.

PD-L1 expression and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes: combined
use as urothelial carcinoma biomarkers
F. Ramalhosa*, M. Garcia, M.B. Pimentão, P. Teixeira, R. Almeida, M.J.
Martins, V. Sousa
*Pathology Department, Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Centro
Hospitalar e Universitário Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) has
been associated with an increased survival rate and can be evaluated by
immunohistochemistry (IHC). The main goal is to correlate the expres-
sion of PD-L1 with tumour Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) (CD8 ex-
pression) in urothelial carcinoma (UC).
Methods: Forty-three samples of high grade UC diagnosed in 2019 and
2020 were selected from archive of the Pathological Anatomy Service
(SAP) of Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Coimbra(CHUC) and tissue
microarray (TMA) were constructed. PD-L1 immunostaining was per-
formed with different clones (SP142, SP263 and 22C3). The information
collected were organized in a database and subjected to statistical analysis
using the SPSS.
Results: TILs are greater in female patients, when using 20 lymphocytes /
High Power Field (HPF) cutoff (median expression). TILs positive cases
are lower in basal IHC subtype carcinomas (p=0.045, p<0.05) when
considering the cutoff of 50 lymphocytes / HPF and have a tendency to
be higher in histologic grade 2 tumours (p=0.0814). Positive correlations
between PD-L1 22C3 with CD8 expression (cutoff 50) (p=0.024, p<0.05)
and PD-L1 SP263 with CD8 (cutoff 50) (p=0.002, p<0.05) were found.
Conclusion: Higher TILs (CD8 expression) levels are correlated with
higher PD-L1 expression, highlighting their use as biomarkers.

Digital pathology reporting of TRUS biopsies of prostate
T. Pasupati Meenakshi*
*Clinipath Sdn Bhd, Malaysia
Background & objectives: Digital pathology is an integrated component
of primary reporting in Clinipath Pathology, Malaysia for the past two
years. Due to the Covid 19 pandemic outbreak in 2020, most of the TRUS
biopsies were reported digitally, away from the office.
Methods: An advanced Aperio AT2 slide scanner (Leica ), which has
been approved by FDA , is in usage for digital pathology reporting in
Clinipath. A total number of 119 TRUS biopsy cases, many of which had
a minimum of 12 cores and also targeted biopsies with MRI mapping for
precision and accuracy were reported, individually, as per latest
International guidelines.
Results: Digital pathology reporting of TRUS biopsies is as accurate as
conventional microscope reporting, and in many instances, more advan-
tageous. With an integrated Dragon Speech software, all cases were re-
ported with ease, without resorting to the conventional microscope for a
review. The response and acceptance from the urologists have been over
whelming.
Measurements of percentage of small malignant foci, and interpreta-
tion of Gleason pattern, coupled with digital photography has made
the system more rewarding. Constant and perpetual practice has
made the digital reporting more dependable, robust, and accurate
than conventional microscope reporting. IHC analysis with compar-
ison of various IHC markers in a single view is a prolific outcome of
digital reporting.
Conclusion: Digital pathology reporting OF TRUS biopsies of pros-
tate is simple, dependable, accurate and should be incorporated as a
regular primary reporting procedure, where digital pathology is
available. The accuracy and effectiveness are very advantageous
for the current demand of uropathology in many laboratories. This
will become the norm of future diagnostic digital pathology and
artificial intelligence(AI).

Incidental prostatic adenocarcinoma in cystoprostatectomy speci-
mens for bladder cancer: a 21-year institutional case review
T. Oliveira*, M. Pinho, D. López-Presa
*Department of Pathology, Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN, Portugal
Background & objectives: Radical cystoprostatectomy is recommended
as a treatment modality in high-risk non-invasive bladder cancer and in
muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Herein, we aimed to review all
cystoprostatectomy specimens received by our institution in a 21-year
period (2000-2020) for incidental prostatic neoplasia.
Methods: We reviewed the reports of 232 cystoprostatectomy specimens
for urothelial cancer and evaluated the prostate for the following param-
eters: presence of prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score, prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), prostate volume and percentage occupied
by tumour, number of tumour foci, laterality, invasion of extra-prostatic
tissues or seminal vesicles, positive surgical margins, staging, PSA levels
before surgery, relapse and metastases.
Results: In total, there were 67 patients (28.9%) with incidental prostatic
acinar adenocarcinoma, with a mean age of 70 years and an average total
PSA level of 2.2 ng/ml. There were 50 cases (74.6%) graded Gleason 6
and 17 cases (25.4%) graded Gleason 7. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia
(PIN) was highly associated with prostatic adenocarcinoma (85.7%)
while being present in only a minority of specimens without it (21.6%).
The tumours occupied, on average, 12.6% of the prostatic volume, were
mostly multifocal (53.7%), bilateral (59.7%) and stage pT2 (94.0%), with
only 4 cases (6.0%) being pT3. Only one patient showed biochemical
relapse (PSA: 146 ng/ml) and cervical bone metastases.
Conclusion: In our series, the incidental prostatic carcinomas were all
acinar adenocarcinomas, mostly small, bilateral, Gleason 6 and stage
pT2. These results are similar to the findings reported for radical
cystoprostatectomy specimens and autopsy series. The detection of these
tumours on cystoprostatectomy specimens is not an uncommon finding
and is to be expected in older patients. Although follow-up is warranted,
the concomitant urothelial carcinoma and its complications remain the
major risk factors to the patients’ overall survival.

Franciszek Łukaszczyk Memorial Hospital, Bydgoszcz, Poland
Background & objectives: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) continues to
pose a great challenge due to our limited understanding of its underlying
pathophysiology. We explored relationships between ACO2 protein ex-
pression and the clinical courses of RCC using the tissue microarray
(TMA).
Methods: The TMA contained 94 cores of primary tumour, matched
metastases and matched adjacent tissues derived from 31 RCC patients.
The mean follow-up was 84.1 months. Tumour samples were evaluated
for ACO2 expression using the H-score, and its correlations with clinico-
pathological data and survival data were analysed.
Results: All of the tissue samples showed ACO2 cytoplasmic expression,
with the median value of 139.7, 130.3 and 166.7 in primary tumour,
metastatic tissue and control group, respectively. Normal adjacent tissues
were characterized by significantly higher ACO2 expression comparing
to primary or metastatic RCC (p<0.05). The analysis demonstrated a
significant positive correlation between ACO2 expressions in primary
tumour and its metastases (p<0.05). The correlation between two vari-
ables was strong (r = 0.7301). The expression of ACO2 did not
Virchows Arch
significantly correlate with overall survival, tumour size or incidence of
capsular or vain invasion (p>0.05).
Conclusion: Significant alterations in ACO2 expression presumably oc-
cur in the early stages of RCC carcinogenesis. Taking into account the
physiological role of ACO2, its downregulation may constitute an adap-
tive trait of RCC to escape the equilibrium phase of immunoediting.

PTEN loss And PD-L1 expression among morphology patterns of
Gleason grade 4 prostate cancer
G. Kir*, G.E. Cecikoglu, A. Yildirim
*Istanbul Medeniyet University, Turkey
Background & objectives: The Gleason grading system is clearly ac-
cepted for the evaluation of prostate cancer architectural patterns. We
aimed to find out whether PTEN immunohistochemical loss of expres-
sion and PD-L1 expression is associated with specific histological
patterns.
Methods: The current study included consecutive 98 radical prostatecto-
my specimens between 2011 and 2017. We selected 151 foci with differ-
ent patterns from 98 radical prostatectomies. PTEN and PD-L1 immuno-
histochemistry were assessed on the different architectural patterns.
Results: There were foci with grade 3 pattern in 18 slides, foci with fused
gland pattern in 39 slides, foci with cribriform pattern in 28 slides, foci
with irregular gland pattern in 47 slides, foci with glomeruloid pattern in 4
slides, and foci with grade 5 pattern in 15 slides. Fifty foci (%33.3)
exhibited PTEN loss. PTEN loss was substantially associated with crib-
riform pattern (<0.001 ). Combined PDL-1 score was positive in 13% of
patients (1 foci with grade 3 pattern, 3 foci with fused gland pattern, 1 foci
with cribriform pattern, 7 foci with irregular gland pattern, 1 foci with
glomeruloid pattern, and 3 foci with grade 5 pattern).
Conclusion: Between the five different grades, Gleason grade 4 is cer-
tainly a heterogeneous group, containing different architectural patterns.
Lately, the cribriform pattern has attracted more attention as an indepen-
dent negative risk factor. The results of our study showed that PTEN loss
was significantly associated with cribriform patterns. We observed that
PD-L1 was most commonly seen in foci with irregular gland pat-
tern(44%) There was no statistically significant difference between six
histological patterns regarding PD-L1 positivity.

*Ankara Şehir Hastanesi, Turkey
Background & objectives: Since anterior aspect of prostate tissue is
irregular, measuring distance to anterior margin is controversial. Our
aim is to investigate the relation between PSA recurrence and distance
to the anterior margin in anterior dominant Grade Group 1(GG1) prostate
cancers.
Methods: A number of 20 GG1 radical prostatectomy specimens (RPs)
with anterior dominant tumour were included in this study from 836 RPs
from 2010 to 2016. PSA recurrence was defined as PSA level of greater
than or equal to 0.2 ng/mL. Slides were re-viewed in order to select the
closest margin. Scanned slides were marked by pathologists to acquire
digital measurements.
Results: Tumours of 9/20 cases were closer than 1 mm to the margin.
Among these 9 cases 3(33.3%) of them had PSA recurrence. The distance
from tumour to margin was greater than 1 mm in 11 cases. Out of these 11
cases one (9.09%) had PSA recurrence. The mean and median follow-up
for PSA recurrences of the cases was 6.8 and 6.5 years (range, 5-11
years). The PSA recurrence was found in 4(20%) cases. And 3 out for
4 had margin closer than 1 mm. The mean distance of recurrent 4 cases
was 1.15 mm (median 0.7;range, 0.26-2.93) compared to 1.64 mm (me-
dian 1.085; range, 0.05-4.29) for cases without PSA recurrence.
Conclusion: Although there are few numbers of anterior-dominant tu-
mour cases, the surgical margin distance at the anterior aspect of prostate
may have an impact on prognosis of such cases. The long-term follow-up
of the patients with GG1 P-Ca may reveal that the tumour distance to the
anterior margin can be an important prognostic feature, which should take
place in the radical prostatectomy reports in the future.

*Hacettepe University Med. Fac., Turkey
Background & objectives: SFT is a fibroblastic tumour characterized by
a haphazard proliferation of spindled to oval cells, staghorn
hemangiopericytoma (HPC)-like vasculature and STAT6 expression.
Although already published in case reports or small series, a comprehen-
sive series of primary renal SFT is lacking.
Methods: Fifteen primary kidney SFTs were reviewed for clinical, mor-
phological, and immunohistochemical features. STAT6 (BioSB, EP325,
1/250 and Santa Cruz, D-1, 1:800), CD34 (Leica, QBEND-10, 1/100) ,
BCL-2 (Invitrogen, BCL-2-100, 1/600) and PAX8 (CellMarque, MRQ-
50, 1/150 and Proteintech, 10336-1-AP, 1:800) immunostainings were
performed.
Results: Mean age was 50,3(17-83) with equal sex distribution. Mean
size was 9,3(2,5-23) cm. Tumours were mainly well-demarcated and
located at the hilus. Morphologically, they were grouped as 1) SFT-like
(5 cases) characterized by hypocellularity and abundant collagen; 2)
HPC-like(6 cases) showing hypercellular proliferation of small-ovoid
cells lacking collagen; 3) mixed SFT/HPC(4 cases). 40% had myxoid
degeneration and/or accompanying lymphocytes. All cases were positive
for CD34, BCL-2, and STAT6(focal, 27%). PAX8 was positive in 27%.
According to Demicco-grading, 12 cases(80%) were low-risk (all cases of
groups 1-2), while 2(13%) and 1(7%) were intermediate- and high-risk,
respectively. One high-risk patient died while 7 were alive for an average
follow-up period of 57 months.
Conclusion: Renal SFTs can exhibit SFT-like, HPC-like or mixed mor-
phology. Most cases (especially SFT-like and mixed HPC/SFT) are be-
nign but occasional malignant examples occur and it seems that current
SFT classification schemes effectively predict such behaviour in this
anatomical location as well. PAX8 positivity and only focal STAT6 ex-
pression in a subset of cases is an important diagnostic pitfall.

Significant inter- and intra-laboratory variation in Gleason grading
of prostate cancer: a nationwide study of 35,258 patients in
The Netherlands

Background & objectives: Gleason grading (GG) of prostate cancer
(PCa) is essential for patient treatment and prognosis. Studies showed
inter-observer variation in GG. As GG variation between pathology lab-
oratories has not been investigated, we analysed inter- and intra-
laboratory grading variation using nationwide data.
Methods: Needle biopsy reports (n=42,774) and corresponding prostate
specific antigen (PSA)-values were retrieved for January 2017–
Virchows Arch
December 2019 from the Dutch Pathology registry and The Netherlands
Cancer Registration.
We determined laboratory-specific proportions per histologic grade and
unadjusted odds ratios (OR) for International Society of Urological
Pathologists (ISUP) Grades 1 versus 2-5. Logistic regression was per-
formed to correct for case-mix variables.
Results: 38,321 Reports of 35,258 patients were included, of which
25,367 were narrative reports and 12,954 standardized, synoptic reports.
Laboratories assigned ISUP Grade 1 to 34.1% of patients on average,
ranging from 19.7-44.3%. Laboratory-specific ORs were significantly de-
viated for 22/40 laboratories, ranging from 0.48 (95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.39-0.59) to 1.54 (CI 1.22-1.93). Case-mix correction was performed
for 10,294 synoptic reports of 21 laboratories for variables PSA, age,
diagnosis year, number of biopsies and positive cores. Case-mix correction
altered the status of three laboratories. The range of adjusted laboratory-
specific proportions increased compared to unadjusted proportions (20.8%
vs. 17.7%). Within 15/21 (71.4%) laboratories that consented to intra-
laboratory analysis, significant inter-pathologist variation existed.
Conclusion: Substantial variation in PCa grading was observed between
and within Dutch pathology laboratories. Case-mix correction changed
the status of individual laboratories but did not change the magnitude of
the observed variation. Grade is an essential for treatment strategy and
patient prognosis. The observed variation suggests that patients might
receive different grading and subsequently different treatment depending
on laboratory and pathologist. Better standardization of PCa grading is
warranted to optimize and harmonize treatment.

Unexpected low metastatic potential to lymph-nodes of isolated tu-
mour cell and cluster-cord in ISUP 5 prostate adenocarcinoma (PC):
morphological analysis of a mono-institutional cohort of radical
prostatectomy (RP) with lymph-node metastasis (LNM)

Humanitas University, Rozzano Milan, Italy
Background & objectives: Gleason pattern 5 (GP5) includes distinct
morphologies, namely undifferentiated solid pattern (US), cribriform
with necrosis (CN), cluster and cord (CC), and isolated single tumour
cells (ISTC). We histologically characterized these different subtypes in
LNM comparing them with the primary tumour.
Methods: ISUP 5 were collected from a mono-institutional cohort of
2784 pts between 2014 and 2020, from which 79 PC with LNM cases
were identified. The different subtypes of GP, tumour volume, topo-
graphical distribution, intraductal component, pT, margin status, and vas-
cular invasion were determined both in LNM and primary tumour.
Results: In LNM, GP5 was documented in 22/79 cases, either alone or in
combination with other patterns. US, CN, ISTC and CC were document-
ed in 13 (16.4%), 8 (10%), 5 (6.3%), and 4 (5%) cases, respectively.
Primary PC harboured ISTC in 35/79 cases, but the same pattern was
rare in the associated LNM (3/35), only as minor component (alone in one
case, with CC in one, with US in one). ISTC did not show differences in
lymph-node topographical distribution (parenchymal, capsular, extra-
capsular) compared with other patterns. Overall, 53/79 (67%) LNM were
dominated by GP4, mostly represented by cribriform pattern. The pres-
ence of ISTC/CC did not correlate with pathological parameters analysed.
Conclusion: Our results showed that ISTC and CC patterns, although not
uncommon in the primary tumour, are unfrequently observed in the loco-
regional lymph-nodes. Although in limited cases, these preliminary data
could suggest that ISTC and CC use a different spreading way to dissem-
inate when compared with cribriform pattern. This low intrinsic capability
to spread into loco-regional lymph nodes could be modulated on a geno-
mic level, and further studies are ongoing to better understand the biology
of these subtypes of GP5.

*Department of Pathology, IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital,
Humanitas University, Rozzano Milan, Italy
Background & objectives: UC classification into Basal and Luminal
categories has shown variable sensitivity to chemotherapy. We conducted
a phenotypical analysis of UC cases from transurethral resection speci-
mens to evaluate the intra-tumour plasticity (switch) between the super-
ficial and deep component of the tumour.
Methods: High grade UC cases were analysed using a simple immuno-
histochemical score (Piescore) focusing on the expression of CD44, CK5/
6, CK20 and pPARg in superficial (pTa/T1) and muscle-invasive (pT2)
component of tumour to identify Luminal, Basal, Mixed, Null (Neu-like)
categories. To increase the specificity of the analysis, 20 cases were also
investigated with RT-PCR.
Results: Two hundred-eleven cases were collected. Superficial compo-
nent showed Luminal, Basal, Mixed and Neu-like phenotype in 99
(46.1%), 61 (28.9%), 33 (15,6%) and 18 (8.5%) cases, respectively.
RT-PCR analysis confirmed immunohistochemical results. From super-
ficial to deep component, a switch of phenotype was observed in 80/211
(38%) cases, from Luminal (42/80, 52.5%) to Neu-like (20), Basal (16),
and Mixed phenotype (6); from Mixed (29/80, 36.2%) to Basal (21),
Luminal (3), and Neu-like phenotype (5). Among 18 Neu-like, 4
(22.2%) acquired new phenotypes, while only 6/61 Basal tumours
switched. Papillary tumours switched more frequently than not-
papillary (52/112, 46.4% vs 26/99, 26.3%) (p=0.0385). Phenotypical
transition did not correlate to OS and PFS.
Conclusion: Piescore system revealed phenotypic plasticity through the
evaluation of a switch between superficial and deep component of the
same tumour. The switch is frequent in Luminal but not in Basal tumours.
After cystectomy, a protective effect of CD44 expression in OS
(p=0.0016) and in PFS (p=0.0042) was observed. This variability could
partially explain the sensitivity of a subset of Luminal UC to chemother-
apy: good responders could be "non-real" Luminal UCs, which acquire
Basal markers such as CD44.

*Ramón y Cajal University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: Ipsilateral synchronous renal clear cell renal
cell carcinoma (CCRCC) and papillary renal cell neoplasm with reverse
polarity (PRCNRP) is an exceptional finding in renal pathology.
PRCNRP, characterized by a hallmark mutation in KRAS, displays
unique morphology and immunoprofile.
Methods: We present an extremely rare case of coexisting PRCNRP and
CCRCC in the same kidney on a 77-year-old patient with no oncologic
medical history. Morphological and immunohistochemical features of
both tumours are described. Molecular analysis using an in-house next
Virchows Arch
generation sequencing (NGS) panel was performed in samples of normal
renal parenchyma and both neoplasms.
Results: Histologically, CCRCC showed a classic morphological and
cytological features and so did PRCNRP. The latter displayed a pure
papillary architecture with hyalinized fibrovascular cores. Papillae were
lined by a single layer of non-stratified tumour cells with large, eosino-
philic cytoplasm and apically located nuclei. Immunohistochemical stud-
ies showed positive staining for MUC1 and GATA3. Negative staining
for a-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase (AMARC) and vimentin was
described. NGS results evidenced mutations in CDH19, COL1A1 and
EGFR in both tumours and normal kidney. CCRCC also showed a
mutation in TAF1 gene. PRCNRP demonstrated the hallmark mutation
in KRAS.
Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the second reported
case of collided CCRCC and PRCNRP. Immunohistochemical and mo-
lecular studies evidenced not only characteristic features of both tumour
but confirmed the diverse oncogenic origin of each entity. PRCNRP has
arisen as a new and underdiagnosed entity in renal pathology, with dis-
tinctive molecular and pathologic findings. Early follow-up studies have
suggested better data in terms of recurrence and metastasis in comparison
with other papillary neoplasms.

Institutet/Digital Pathology, ContextVision, Sweden
Background & objectives: To better the concordance and objectiv-
ity in the evaluation of prostate core-needle biopsies, we devel-
oped an AI-based decision-support tool and algorithm to specifi-
cally detect and outline neoplastic glandular tissue using an in-
house high-resolution staining and annotation method - Master
Annotation.
Methods: To reduce the turnaround time and improve the objectivity of
our training data, we developed a patented multiplex-staining method to
train our algorithms to detect and outline suspicious glandular tissue
without basal cells and intraductal cancer.
Pathologists annotated, in high-resolution mode, of H&E whole-slide
images, assisted by re-stained and aligned immunofluorescence or con-
secutive chromogenic IHC whole slide images.
Results: The semantic segmentation algorithm, in INIFY® Prostate
(ContextVision, Sweden) was trained within a deep learning framework
developed in-house at ContextVision.
The algorithm was evaluated on 58 prostate slides, stained at five
different laboratories and scanned on three different WSI-scanners.
It achieved a median pixel-level sensitivity and specificity of
98.4% and 97.5%, respectively, on cancer images, and a specific-
ity of 99.0% on benign images, using a tolerance of 3 pixels (or
approximately 21 μm).
Conclusion: Master Annotation enabled a micron-level region of interest
and an augmented segmentation ground truth for our input-data of the
deep learning algorithm.
Using this approach, we have developed INIFY® Prostate, a CE
marked AI-based software that a clinical setting, predicts, outlines,
and quantifies suspected cancer areas in prostate biopsy H&E
stained whole slide images.

Institutet/Digital Pathology, ContextVision, Sweden
Background & objectives: Prostate cancer is the second most frequent
cancer for men in Europe but grading suffers from discordance and low
objectivity in the histopathologic evaluation.
FIRST PATH study aims to evaluate performance and usability of
INIFY-Prostate in the clinical pathology workflow.
Methods: The feasibility phase of the FIRST PATH study included 100
WSI's (59 benign, 41 cancer) from 12 retrospective anonymised cases.
Two study pathologists diagnosed all WSI's without INIFY, and then
after wash-out-period with the support of INIFY. A panel of 3 senior
pathologists did the final consensus diagnosis. All diagnoses in the study
were blinded (inter- and intra-pathologists).
Results: The diagnostic accuracy as well as diagnostic concordance of
pathologists with INIFY was higher than the corresponding values with-
out INIFY. The two study pathologists judged INIFY’s performance as
good/acceptable for 12 of 12, and 11 of 12 cases, respectively. In com-
parison to the reference diagnosis, seven (7) whole slide images (WSIs)
that were incorrectly diagnosed without INIFY, but were then correctly
diagnosed with INIFY, while only one (1) correct diagnosis without
INIFY rendered incorrect with INIFY.
The % tissue area of cancer given by the INIFY algorithm correlated well
with the pathologists’ estimates of % cancer length within the respective
cores (Spearman rank correlation 0.80, p<0.001).
Conclusion: Preliminary results indicate that INIFY Prostate Screening
performs well and gives good support to pathologists in the clinical
workflow. The observed improvements of diagnostic accuracy and con-
cordance between pathologists need to be confirmed in the full FIRST
PATH clinical study.

van der Wekken, on behalf of the UMCG Molecular Tumor Board
*Department of Medical Biology, University Medical Centre Groningen,
The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) pa-
tients with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene fusions respond
well to ALK inhibitors but commonly develop on-target resistance mu-
tations. The objective of this study is to collect clinical evidence for
subsequent treatment with ALK inhibitors.
Methods: Local experience with on-target ALK resistance mutations and
review of the literature identified 387 patients with ALK inhibitor resis-
tance mutations and subsequent treatment results. Clinical benefit of
mutation-inhibitor combinations was assessed based on reported re-
sponse, progression-free survival and duration of treatment.
Furthermore, this clinical evidence was compared to previously reported
in vitro sensitivity of mutations to the inhibitors.
Results: Of the 387 patients included in this analysis, 239 received a
different ALK inhibitor after developing on-target resistance to first line
ALK inhibitor therapy. Clinical benefit was reported for 177 (68%)
Virchows Arch
patients but differed for each mutation-inhibitor combination. Agreement
between in vitro predicted sensitivity of six published models and ob-
served clinical benefit ranged from 64 to 87%. The observed clinical
evidence for highest probability of response in the context of specific
on-target ALK inhibitor resistance mutations is presented.
Conclusion: Molecular diagnostics performed on tissue samples that are
refractive to ALK inhibitor therapy can reveal new options for targeted
therapy. The comprehensive overview of clinical evidence of drug
actionability of ALK on-target resistance mechanisms may serve as a
practical guide to select the most optimal drug for individual patients.

NTRK gene fusions in MLH1 deficient and BRAFV600E wild-type
colorectal cancers
I. Ukkola*, P. Nummela, M. Kero, S. Kytölä, P. Peltomäki, A. Ristimäki
*HUS - Helsinki University Hospital, Finland
Background & objectives: NTRK fusions are oncogenic drivers and
offer targets for cancer therapy. Since they are rare in colorectal cancer
(CRC), universal screening for these fusions in CRC seems impractical.
Our aim was to investigate NTRK fusions in a subset of CRC.
Methods: Pan-Trk (clone EPR17341, Roche, Ventana) immunohisto-
chemistry (IHC) and MLH1 promotor hypermethylation (MLH1ph) were
analysed in 63 CRC cases with deficient MLH1 (dMLH1) and
BRAFV600E wild-type (wt) status from CRCs resected at the Helsinki
University Hospital in 2018-2020. Pan-Trk immunopositive cases were
evaluated by targeted RNA-based NGS (Fusion Plex Comprehensive
Thyroid and Lung Kit, ArcherDX Inc.).
Results: Of the 63 dMLH1/BRAFV600Ewt CRCs seven (11.1%) cases
were Pan-Trk IHC positive and each of them was confirmed to harbor
NTRK1 fusion by NGS. Detected fusions involved LMNA-NTRK1,
TPM3-NTRK1 and PLEKHA6-NTRK1 each in two cases and
IRF2BP2-NTRK1 in one. MLH1ph status was determined using
methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
(MS-MLPA) with SALSA MS-MLPA Probemix ME011-D1 Mismatch
Repair Genes kit (MRC Holland) comprising 44 dMLH1/MLH1ph/
BRAFV600Ewt CRCs. All NTRK1 fusions were in the subgroup of
MLH1ph (7/44; 15.9%). Pan-Trk immunostaining pattern showed strong
or moderate cytoplasmic staining in TPM3-NTRK1 and IRF2BP2-
NTRK1 cases, stronger membranous than cytoplasmic staining in
PLEKHA6-NTRK1 cases, and the only cases showing perinuclear stain-
ing were the fusions for LMNA-NTRK1.
Conclusion: Our study shows that Pan-Trk IHC detects NTRK1 fusions
with 100% specificity in CRC. Our results confirm that NTRK1 fusions
are frequently detected in dMLH1/BRAFV600Ewt (11%) and especially
in dMLH1/MLH1ph/BRAFV600Ewt (16%) CRCs justifying screening
for NTRK fusions in these subsets of CRCs. Our findings of NTRK1
fusions with partners LMNA, PLEKHA6 and TPM3 in CRC are consis-
tent with previous studies but noteworthy, we introduce a novel
IRF2BP2-NTRK1 fusion in CRC.

Background & objectives: Molecular analysis of KIT and PDGFRA is
critical for tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment selection of gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (GISTs). We performed a nationwide real-world data
study into the application of predictive mutation testing and its impact
on treatment decisions.
Methods: Real-world clinical and pathology information was obtained
from GIST patients with initial diagnosis in 2017–2018 through database
linkage between the Netherlands Cancer Registry and the nationwide
Dutch Pathology Registry.
Results: Predictive mutation analysis was performed in 89% of the pa-
tients with high risk or metastatic disease. Molecular testing rates were
higher for patients treated in expertise centers (96%) compared to non-
expertise centers (75%, P<0.01). Imatinib therapy was applied in 81% of
the patients with high risk or metastatic disease without patient’s refusal
or adverse characteristics, e.g. comorbidities or resistance mutations.
Mutation analysis, that was performed in 97% of these imatinib-treated
cases, did not guarantee mutation-tailored treatment: 2% of these patients
had the PDGFRA p.D842V resistance mutation and 7% initiated imatinib
therapy at the normal instead of high dose despite of having a KIT exon 9
mutation.
Conclusion: In conclusion, nationwide real-world data show that over
81% of the eligible high risk or metastatic disease patients with GIST
receive targeted therapy, which was tailored to the mutation status as
recommended in guidelines in 88% of cases. Therefore, still 27% of these
GIST patients misses out on mutation-tailored treatment. The reasons for
suboptimal uptake of testing and treatment require further study.

ofanAI-basedtoolbypathologistsforreviewingandreportingprostatecore
needle biopsies (PCNBs) as compared with Standard of Care review on
microscope,alsoassessingimprovementsinefficiencyandturnaroundtime.
Methods: A two-arm prospective reader study comparing the performance
of pathologists using an AI-based solution workflow compared with the use
of standard of care (pathologists using a microscope). Both arms were com-
pared to ground truth (GT) established by consensus of two subspecialist
uropathologists. Rates of major discrepancies between each arm and GT, as
determined by an adjudicating expert uropathologist, were compared.
Results: Eight pathologists participated in the study and reported on 785
H&E slides from 100 PCNB consecutive cases. Each case was reported
twice, once in each study arm. The major discrepancy rates of the micro-
scope and of the AI-based solution arms against GT were 7.15% and
4.84%, respectively. The AI solution demonstrated very high perfor-
mance on prostate cancer detection with AUC=0.99, sensitivity of
95.5%, and specificity of 96.2%. Other endpoints included sensitivity
and specificity of both arms on cancer detection and grading. The study
demonstrated that reporting with the AI-based solution leads to >30%
efficiency gains and a significant decrease in TAT.

Conclusion: This is the first large-scale study, in which pathologists
perform full primary diagnosis with the support of an integrated AI-
based solution in a real world-like clinical setting, in a large network of
pathology laboratories. Importantly, diagnostic accuracy improvements
are observed in addition to significant efficiency gains for the pathologists
reviewing and reporting with the integrated AI solution.

Multiple-instance learning for assessing prognosis of ductal carcino-
ma in situ

Gavves, J. Teuwen, J. Wesseling, G.C. PRECISION Consortium
*Netherlands Cancer Institute, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: We propose a Deep Learning-based pipeline
to aid pathologists in the task of distinguishing Ductal Carcinoma in Situ
(DCIS) cases with low versus high risk of progression to ipsilateral
Invasive Breast Cancer (iIBC), using H&E whole-slide images (WSIs).
Methods: We use a Multiple-Instance Learning-based Deep Learning
pipeline to predict 10-year iIBC recurrence of DCIS from H&E stained
WSIs. We also explore automatic mammary duct detection as an input
selection strategy, and we compare it to standard WSI tiling. The resulting
models are trained and evaluated on 414 H&E stained WSIs provided by
the Netherlands Cancer Institute.
Results: All classification results are obtained on a validation set which
remains untouched until after model training and selection, and which
contains good balance between the positive and negative class. When using
detected ducts as its input, the proposed pipeline achieves up to 0.71 in area
under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (precision: 0.68; sensi-
tivity: 0.61; specificity: 0.75). Classification performance increases signif-
icantly when we exclude patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy from
both the training and validation sets. In this case the pipeline achieves up to
0.86 in ROC-AUC (precision: 0.89; sensitivity: 0.71; specificity: 0.89).
Conclusion: Our pipeline achieves remarkable classification perfor-
mance, substantially improving over both human assessment and over
the only comparable recent machine learning-based approach. Our results
show that a Multiple-Instance Learning pipeline using score average-
pooling aggregation is more likely to produce correct classifications for
the low-risk group when applying duct detection as an input selection
strategy as opposed to dense tiling, showing promise for tackling the

*Pathan B.V., The Netherlands
Background & objectives: An increasing number of pathology labora-
tories are fully digitised. In this study a mitosis algorithm primarily de-
veloped for breast carcinoma is applied to melanocytic lesions. This study
aims to study the added value of this algorithm in diagnosing melanocytic
lesions.
Methods: A set of 99 digitally scanned melanocytic skin lesions for
which a consensus diagnosis was reached was subjected to a mitosis
algorithm based on convolutional neural networks. Two academic and
six non-academic surgical pathologists specialized in dermatopathology
examined the WSI cases, first without and after a washout period of at
least 2 months with mitosis annotations based on the algorithm.
Results: The overall concordance of the pathologists with the consensus
diagnosis for all cases excluding nevoid melanoma (n=89) appears to be
comparable with and without the use of artificial intelligence (AI) (89%
vs. 90%). However, the concordance increases by using AI in nevoid
melanoma cases (n=10) (75% vs 68%). All but one pathologist reported
more dermal mitoses with the mitosis algorithm which on a regular basis
were incorrectly attributed to mitoses from mainly leukocytes. In 3 cases
the algorithm indicated a correct dermal mitosis in a melanocyte that was
not in accordance with the consensus diagnosis.
Conclusion: This study shows that in general cases pathologist perform
similarly with the aid of a mitosis algorithm. In nevoid melanoma cases,
pathologists perform better with the algorithm. This study shows that
pathologists need to be aware of potential pitfalls using CAD, e.g.
misinterpreting dermal mitoses in non-melanotic cells.

*University Hospital Tübingen, Germany
Background & objectives: Immunotherapies can induce long-lasting
remissions in advanced-stage cancer patients, but many patients do not
benefit. We reasoned that characterizing the tumour microenvironment
(TME) architecture at the single-cell level should reveal novel spatial
biomarkers of immunotherapy response.
Methods: We performed CODEX highly multiplexed tissue imaging to
investigate the TME in cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) patients
treated with pembrolizumab anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. 55 protein
markers were visualized simultaneously in a tissue microarray of matched
pre- and post-treatment skin biopsies from 7 responders and 7 non-re-
sponders. RNA sequencing was performed to extract cell-type specific
gene expression profiles by CIBERSORTx analysis.
Results: We identified and characterized 21 spatially resolved tumour and
reactive immune cell clusters in the CTCL TME. Advanced computational
analysis of tumour architecture revealed cellular neighbourhoods that dy-
namically changed during pembrolizumab therapy and were correlated
with response. Furthermore, a spatial signature of cell-cell distances be-
tween tumour cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and PD-1+CD4+ effector
T cells predicted therapy outcome. After treatment, in pembrolizumab re-
sponders PD-1+CD4+ effector T cells up-regulated the cytotoxic molecule
granzyme B, whereas in non-responders the frequency of ICOS+ Tregs
increased. In addition, CIBERSORTx analysis revealed that tumour cells
in responders, but not in non-responders, enhanced the expression of
immune-activating genes, particularly the T cell chemoattractant CXCL13.
Conclusion: The pre-existing immune status of the CTCL TME is asso-
ciated with specific immune cell types, cellular neighbourhoods and ar-
chitectural features that correlate with pembrolizumab response.
Multidimensional analysis of the TME enables discovering spatial pre-
dictive biomarkers and generating novel mechanistic hypotheses of im-
munotherapy response, paving the way for future studies functionally
addressing these cell types and their interactions.

Histocartography: an entity-based workflow for histology image
analysis
P. Pati*, G. Jaume, A. Foncubierta Rodriguez, M. Gabrani
*IBM Research Zurich, Switzerland
Background & objectives: Cancer diagnoses rely on phenotype and
topological distribution of histological entities. However, deep learning
Virchows Arch
techniques for cancer analysis operate at pixel-level which disregards the
notion of such entities. We propose Histocartography, a generalized
entity-based paradigm to address the aforementioned issue.
Methods: Histocartography begins with tissue pre-processing.
Subsequently, we construct entity-graph representation, where nodes
and edges depict histological entities and inter-entity interactions in the
tissue. The choice of entity type, entity embedding, and topological for-
mulation can be customized using task-specific pathological prior.
Afterward, Graph Neural Network (GNN) is employed to map
structure-to-function relationship. Finally, post-hoc graph explainability
techniques explain the GNN’s decision.
Results: We released Histocartography python package, a collection of
image-to-graph translation, state-of-the-art GNNs, and graph explainers
to facilitate interpretable entity-based analysis. A REST API prototype
with user-friendly interface is deployed to seamlessly onboard patholo-
gists. Currently, Histocartography supports entity-graphs using nuclei,
tissue regions, or both as entities for arbitrary image dimensions. We
included pre-trained GNNs to map breast tumour regions-of-interest onto
7 breast carcinoma subtypes. We include 4 graph explainers to generate
post-hoc explanations, and an explainability module to produce
pathologist-friendly quantitative measures. Average processing time for
a 1K´1K region-of-interest on an NVIDIA P100 GPU is 2s, 0.01s, 0.3s,
and 0.2s for cell-graph generation, GNN inference, explanation genera-
tion, and quantitative measurements respectively.
Conclusion: Histocartography lays the foundation for a one-stop solution
to access graph-based analysis in computation pathology. It enables de-
velopers to build customized graph representations and task-specific
GNNs. It provides an interpretable input space in terms of relevant histo-
logical entities to pathologists which they can relate to and reason with.
Finally, the explainability module generates easy-to-understand localized
explanations. Currently, the service only includes solutions for breast
carcinoma, and we are in process of extending to other organs, disease
types, and pathology tasks.

Adrenal gland developmental anomalies – rare necroptic findings
C. Amalinei*, A. Grigoras, L.A. Riscanu
*"Grigore T. Popa" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Iasi and
Institute of Legal Medicine Iasi, Romania
Background & objectives: Adrenal gland is formed of two
embryological-distinct layers: the cortex and medulla. Adrenal gland
anomalies are relatively rare and most cases are incidental autopsic find-
ings. We present two cases of developmental anomalies of the adrenal
gland diagnosed in our Department.
Methods: Necroptic examination has been associated to collection of
tissue specimens for microscopy, followed by routine hematoxylin-
eosin staining.
Results: The developmental anomalies of the adrenal gland occurred in
two subjects, a 69 and a 76-years old men. The histopathological exam-
ination revealed a fusion between renal and adrenal cortex in one case and
an area of adrenal tissue which was located under the liver capsule in
another case. Considering the adrenal gland embryological development,
ectopic adrenal tissues are usually found in the vicinity of the adrenal
gland or along the trajectory of embryonic migration, within or near the
urogenital tract. However, ectopic adrenal in the liver is also a possibility,
although extremely rare, as in a case of our report.
Conclusion: Incidental anomalies of adrenal gland are occasional find-
ings in forensic pathology. Adrenal-renal fusion and ectopic adrenal tis-
sue may be incidentally discovered during the necropsy, the microscopic
examination being important in certification of diagnosis. The differen-
tials from benign lesions to malignant and potentially lethal conditions are
important in the context of tanatogenesis.

C. Amalinei*, A. Grigoras, L.A. Riscanu, T. Iov, R.A. Balan
*"Grigore T. Popa" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Iasi and
Institute of Legal Medicine Iasi, Romania
Background & objectives: Haemangioma is a common benign vascular
tumour derived from blood vessel cells. The objective of our study is to
report the particular features of incidental haemangiomas necroptically
diagnosed, from our files.
Methods: The autopsic reports of our Department, from the last 5 years,
have been reviewed, and 47 cases of haemangiomas have been selected.
These cases have been investigated by routine paraffin-embedding,
followed by hematoxylin-eosin staining.
Results: The cases were diagnosed in 31 males and 16 females, age
ranging between 41 weeks gestational age up to 78 years old. Gross
findings were that of small, well delimited red-brown masses, of up to
2 cm diameter. The microscopic examination revealed the proliferation of
thin-walled blood vessels, lined by a single layer of flat endothelial cells,
without atypia, within the liver tissue, in a subcapsular location, in
84.09% of cases, with characteristic features for cavernous haemangioma
in 91.48% of cases and of capillary haemangioma in 8.51%. The other
cases revealed three rare locations, as following: left atrium cavernous
haemangioma, renal corticomedulllary junction capillary haemangioma,
and umbilical cord cavernous haemangioma.
Conclusion: Haemangiomaisthe mostcommonbenignlivertumour,butit
may develop in any location. Differentials should include other vascular
tumours, such as lymphangioma, benign (infantile) haemangioendo-
thelioma, hemangioblastoma, epithelioid haemangioendothelioma, and
angiosarcoma. Haemangiomas may be significant in legal medicine when

*"Grigore T. Popa" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Iasi and
Institute of Legal Medicine Iasi, Romania
Background & objectives: Central nervous metastases are relatively
frequent in forensics. We present the particular features of a female sub-
ject, of 69 years old, which presented multiple tumours, located in adrenal
gland, lung, pleura, and cerebellum, associated with lymphadenopathy.
Methods: Necroptic examination has been associated to collection of
tissue specimens for microscopy. Routine hematoxylin-eosin staining,
along with immunohistochemistry using a panel of markers
(Cytokeratin AE1/AE3, CK5, CK7, CK20, p63, TTF-1, Synaptophysin,
Chromogranin, Melan A, Calretinin, Inhibin, and S100) have been used
in order to discriminate between primaries and secondaries.
Results: The gross findings were that of multiple tumour masses with
variable areas of necrosis and adenopathy. The microscopic examination
of tumour cells showed variable nuclear atypia, eosinophilic cytoplasm,
the differential between a metastatic lung squamous cell carcinoma and a
metastatic malignant pheochromocytoma being investigated. The tumour
cells expressed diffuse, strong positivity of AE1/AE3 and CK5, focal
Virchows Arch
Melan A positivity, and also focal adrenal CK7 positivity. Negative stains
included CK20, p63, TTF-1, Synaptophysin, Chromogranin, Calretinin,
Inhibin, and S100. Accordingly, the diagnosis of poorly differentiated
lung squamous cell carcinoma with pleural invasion and lymph nodes,
adrenal gland, and cerebellum metastases has been certified.
Conclusion: Central nervous system metastases are mainly located in
brain hemispheres and spinal cord but, rarely, they may be located in
cerebellum, as seen in this case report. Immunohistochemistry is useful
to distinguish primary and metastases in cases with multiple dissemina-
tions, including adrenal gland, and AE1/AE3 and CK5 association shows
a high specificity in metastatic lung squamous cell carcinomas.

Location variability of incidental hydatid cysts
C. Amalinei*, A. Grigoras, L.A. Riscanu, B.G. Ioan
*"Grigore T. Popa" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Iasi and
Institute of Legal Medicine Iasi, Romania
Background & objectives: Hydatid cysts are incidental findings in fo-
rensics, involving liver and rarely lung, abdomen cavity, spleen, ovaries,
uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and broad ligaments. The aim of our study
is to report the features of incidental hydatid cysts from our files.
Methods: The reports from autopsies performed in the last 5 years in our
Department, have been reviewed, selecting 19 cases of hydatid cysts, with
cases age distribution between 37 to 89 years old, 4 females and 15 males.
The cases have been investigated by routine paraffin-embedding sections,
followed by hematoxylin-eosin and trichrome staining.
Results: The gross findings showed single cysts with maximum diameter
of 80mm, low consistency, with subcapsular liver location in 17 cases
(89.47%), while another case showed a subcapsular splenic location. In
one case, multiple cystic structures, of up to 30mm diameter, with par-
tially calcified wall, forming a tumour-like mass have been detected with-
in the anterior right ribs 1-3. The microscopic exam revealed laminated
membrane, inflammatory infiltrate rich in lymphocytes and eosinophils,
pericystic fibrosis, necrosis, and dystrophic calcifications. The endocyst
with the inner germinal layer and partially lithic scolices have been de-
tected in 63.15% of cases. Differential diagnoses included inflammatory
cysts, neoplastic diseases, and trauma-related lesions.
Conclusion: Incidental hydatid cysts or echinococcosis are relatively rare
in forensic pathology, usually being located in liver. These appear as
single or multiple cysts, associated with variable inflammation, fibrosis,
and calcification. However asymptomatic echinococcosis progression
may result in unexpected findings and locations and, as a consequence,
this diagnosis should be considered in endemic areas. The differentials,
from benign lesions to malignant and potentially lethal conditions, are
important in the context of causes of death.

*Clinical Department Unit of Pathological Anatomy, OSI Araba, Araba
University Hospital, Bioaraba Health Research Institute, Vitoria-Gasteiz,
Alava, Spain
Background & objectives: The novel coronavirus has caused million of
deaths since the start of the global pandemic. In this situation, the patho-
logical examination is more important than ever to understand the path-
ophysiology of this new disease.
Methods: 31 autopsies of patients who died with COVID-19 infection
were performed between May 2020 and February 2021. There were per-
formed 27 thoracic and 4 thoracoabdominal autopsies. All of them were
carried out in BSL-3 rooms. Patients had an age range between 44 and 89
years old, 28 of them were male and 3 were female.
Results: Lungs had a congestive appearance and were heavy.
Microscopically the most consistent finding in all cases was the presence
of diffuse alveolar damage. It was seen in an exudative phase with the
presence of hyaline membranes, in a proliferative phase with reactive type
II pneumocytes and even in a fibrotic phase. Eight patients showed acute
organizing and fibrinous pneumonia and sixteen patients showed throm-
botic phenomena. Microbiological cultures were performed and 28 pa-
tients had viral, bacterial and fungal superinfections what lead to pneu-
monia and lung abscesses. The lung parenchyma also showed the pres-
ence of multinucleated giant cells in ten cases. Emphysema, squamous
metaplasia and lambertosis were seen in 16 patients.
Conclusion: This study reveals the importance of the autospy in under-
standing the changes produced in the body by the SARS-CoV-2. The
lungs were the most affected organ with the presence of acute and chronic
processes. Also, as mentioned, many patients showed thrombotic phe-
nomena with lung thromboembolism. These findings are consisten with
the fact that the new coronavirus affects the vasculature exerting a
prothrombotic effect. All in all, further investigation are necessary in order
to shed light on this pandemic.

Histopathological clues in a case of ethylene glycol ingestion
D. Costache*, A.M. Vrâncianu, A. Simionescu, A. Tița, M. Bosa, L. Luca
*Pathology Department, Colentina University Clinical Hospital,
Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Ingested ethylene glycol(EG) is metabolised
into four organic acids: glycolaldehyde, glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid and
oxalic acid(OA), causing severe acidosis, central nervous system depres-
sion, cardiopulmonary and renal failure. OA precipitates as calcium ox-
alate monohydrate(COM) in the kidneys and other tissues.
Methods: We present a case of fatal EG poisoning of a 44-year-old male
found dead in his home. An autopsy was performed and samples of brain,
lung, heart, liver, spleen, stomach, kidney and adrenal were taken. The
organs were fixed in formalin, processed, embedded in paraffin and ex-
amined on H&E. Blood, urine and gastric content samples were sent for
toxicological examination.
Results: Microscopic examination revealed that the kidneys were the most
affected showing moderate chronic pyelonephritis, nephroangiosclerosis,
areas of acute tubular necrosis with extensive intratubular deposition of
translucent, colourless, refractile crystals of COM, with multi-coloured
birefringence under the polarized light.
Other findings were: cerebral cortex stasis, perineuronal and perivascular
oedema; meninges with arachnoid fibrosis, meningothelial hyperplasia
and psammoma bodies; atherosclerosis of the coronary artery branches,
hypoxic changes in cardiomyocytes, with moderate perivascular and in-
terstitial fibrosis and lipodystrophy; massive stasis and alveolar oedema
in the lungs with few vascular fibrin thrombi; a small cavernous hepatic
haemangioma and an adrenal cortical adenoma of 2 cm diameter.
Toxicological tests revealed lethal levels of EG.
Conclusion: EG can be found in many agents, such as antifreeze. Ingestion
ofEG,accidentalorinsuicideattempts,causespoisoningwhichcanbefatal.
COM accumulates in the kidney by attachment of crystals to tubular cell
membranes, followed by endocytosis, resulting in structural damage of
cell membranes, production of free radicals and lipid peroxidation, mal-
function in the mitochondria of proximal tubule cells and consequently,
renal tubular necrosis. Microscopic findings together with the toxicologic
report are diagnostic for EG poisoning.

Institute of Forensic Science, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia
Background & objectives: The objectives of this study were determine
the demographic characteristics of patients who died from isolated head
injuries having no surgery and to determine their survival time based on
histopathological changes in the injury hematoma and brain.
Methods: Between 2018 and 2019 the Department of Forensic Medicine
of the National Institute Forensic Science recorded 3895 deaths of which
810 cases had head trauma. A subset of 398 of these patients with isolated
headtraumawereanalysed.Thetissuesfrom50ofthesepatientsunderwent
histopathological analysis to determine the time from injury to death.
Results: Out of 398 cases studied, 326 (82%) were male, 72 (18%), were
female (male to female ratio 4.5:1) and most (n=119, 30%) were within
40-49 years of age (mean age 42±13.2). Trauma to the anterior head was
the most common location of injury (259, 65%). We identified 50 cases to
estimate time from injury to death by histological examination using
Martius Scarlet Blue stain. Among these cases 15 died between 0-6 hours
after head trauma, 3 died between 6-12 hours, 22 cases died between 12-
18 hours, 3 cases died between 18-24 hours, 2 case died 24-48 hours, and
5 cases died 48 hours after head injury.
Conclusion: Males who suffered death from traumatic head injuries from
blunt objects were most frequently identified in our research. Brain oede-
ma, subarachnoid haemorrhage, frontal skull fracture and brain contusion
were most common. The interval of time from the head trauma to death
was determined by the age of the fibrin using histochemistry stain.

experience
C. Dahlstedt-Ferreira*, S. Carralas Antunes, R. S. S. Oliveira, M.J. Brito
*Hospital Garcia de Orta, EPE, Portugal
Background & objectives: In the past decades, autopsy rates have de-
clined for a multitude of reasons. Despite technological diagnostic ad-
vances, the number of malignancies missed during clinical evaluation has
not declined. Hereby, we focused on haematolymphoid malignancies
(HLM) due the challenges they present.
Methods: The present study was an observational record-based study,
with consult of autopsy reports and patient’s medical files. We evaluated
all the autopsies performed at our institution over the last 12 years (2009-
2020), with the purpose of characterizing HLM in autopsy context. All
the data was analysed as frequency and proportion.
Results: Duringthisresearch,wefoundthat,since2009,366autopsieswere

[Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) and Plasma cell neoplasms (PCN)], 5
were under study for occult malignancy [(4 NHL and 1 Myeloproliferative/
myelodysplastic neoplasm/syndrome (MM/NS)] and the remaining 11
were not diagnosed/suspected clinically (8 NHL, 2 PCN and 1 MM/NS).
Conclusion: HLM usually course with nonspecific clinical manifesta-
tions being most of the time diagnostically challenging. Generally, they
have a poor clinical outcome and prompt treatment may be lifesaving.
With the present study we try to emphasize the persisting relevance of the
traditional postmortem examination, by shedding some light not only in
current pathology practice but also by contributing to the improvement of
the diagnostic approach in HLM.

*South Ural State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: The aim of study was to determine the mor-
tality structure in the autopsy cases of concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infec-
tion and malignant neoplasms.
Methods: We assessed 4695 autopsies. In all cases there was post-mortem
histological examination and the data of reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR). The SARS-CoV-2 was determined by RT-PCR
in 95% of cases. In 5% of cases there was just typical for COVID-19
clinical and morphological findings without RT-PCR determination.
Results: The overall number of autopsies with SARS-CoV-2 infec-
tion and malignant neoplasms was 94/4695 (2%). The median age
was 66 years (LQ-58,25; HQ-77,5). The coexisting SARS-CoV-2
infection and hemoblastosis was observed in 46% cases (ICD-10
С91 – 18%; С92-93 – 12%; C90 – 9%; С81-85 – 7%), colorectal
cancer in 12% cases (С18-С20), lung cancer in 10% (С34), CNS
malignancy in 5% cases (C70-72). The others malignancies were
observed in less than 5% of cases.
Pneumonia (31% cases), pulmonary embolism (25% cases), cancer me-
tastasis (13% cases) and shock (13% cases) occurred as a complication.
Conclusion: The most common concomitance of SARS-CoV-2 infec-
tion and hemoblastosis was revealed among all types of malignan-
cies. It may be connected with the immune dysfunction associated
with hemoblastosis.

*University of Fortaleza, Brazil
Background & objectives: Death verification services (DVS) supply
important epidemiological data to improve the healthcare system. In
Ceará, it has an important role in decreasing the index for death by ill-
defined causes. This study aims to understand the importance of this
institution’s implementation.
Methods: The present study consists of a literature review. The articles
studied were retrieved from the Scielo database. The descriptors Death,
Verification, Services and Importance were applied, utilizing the boolean
operator and. Government databases like DATASUS, official govern-
ment websites and literary works on the subject were also considered.
The period from 1996 to 2020 was the search limit.
Results: The DVS in Ceará was created in 2005. It works by identifying
the natural causes of death, providing data to the health system and im-
proving its coverage area throughout the state in 2014 with the Mobile
Death Verification Service. According to the government's mortality in-
formation system, in the nine years prior to the service's implementation,
the rate of ill-defined causes of death was 10% above the national target.
After the institution's first year of operation, the index dropped to 6.2%.
During the dengue outbreaks between 2011 and 2012, 214 post-mortem
examinations were performed of which 121 were confirmed as dengue
and 42.05% of those had no clinical suspicion.
Conclusion: The death verification service of Ceara has played a funda-
mental role in collecting data on the diverse types of natural deaths,
helping to trace an epidemiological profile that contributes to the im-
provement of public healthcare in the state.

Background & objectives: We report autopsy findings of primary amoe-
bic meningoencephalitis (PAM), caused by Naegleria fowleri, a rare re-
ported disease in Brazil with high mortality, associated with bathing on
still hot water.
Methods: Clinical, imaging, and autopsy recordings were reviewed. The
patient was a 19-year-old, male college student, immunocompetent, who
presented with progressive headache for three days, evolving with apha-
sia and motor deficit, after bathing on a lagoon during an expedition to the
state of Piauí, Brazil. MRI showed multifocal lesions with T2
hyperintensity, intralesional haemorrhage, and heterogeneous pattern of
enhancement.
Results: The patient was transferred to the ICU after presenting progressive
clinical worsening with intracranial hypertension. After three days, brain
biopsy was performed showing necrotizing encephalitis without any iden-
tified microorganism. Despite corticosteroid, antifungal and antibiotic ther-
apy, the patient rapidly progressed to death. Autopsy gross findings were:
purulent leptomeningeal exudate with haemorrhage along the cerebral
hemispheres, brain stem, cerebellum and upper spinal cord, congestion of
meningeal vessels, brain oedema with herniation of the uncus and cerebel-
lum. Cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum exhibited multiple necrotic and
lytic lesions. A diagnosis of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis caused
by Naegleria fowleri was based on epidemiological and histopathological
findings of multiple amoeba trophozoites without cystic forms.
Conclusion: Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is associated with
swimming in warm and fresh water where the free-living and thermophil-
ic amoeba Naegleria fowleri may enter the central nervous system
through the olfactory nerve epithelium. This is a rare case reported in
Brazil that shows the importance of considering PAM in the differential
diagnosis of necrotizing lesions of the central nervous system.

*Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, Russia
Background & objectives: The COVID-19 infection now is spreading
globally, threatening public health worldwide. Patients with COVID-19
experience acute respiratory syndrome accompanied by several
extrapulmonary symptoms. The aim of present study was to reveal diges-
tive system pathology in fatal cases of the COVID-19.
Methods: A full pathological post-mortem examinations were performed
in 47 fatal cases of the COVID-19. Medical records and clinical data were
studied. Gross pathology of the lungs, digestive system, other internal
organs and brain were examined. Tissue samples were taken for histolog-
ical study. Microscopy of H&E stained slides performed at x10, x20, x40.
Gastrointestinal tract pathology features were recorded and analysed.
Results: Our study has shown the features of pulmonary pathology in
majority of cases, including interstitial pneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage
and hyaline membranes formation. Gastrointestinal tract pathology was
found in 21% of cases (nine men and one woman). Foci of dystrophy
and necrosis, covered with fibrin films with an admixture of neutrophils
and mononuclear cell revealed in stomach and intestines. The glands of the
stomach were overflowing with mucous secretion, mucostasis was notice-
able in the goblet cells. In addition, lymphocytes, monocytes, leukocytes
infiltrations were common findings in oesophageal mucosa, stomach, in-
testines lamina propria. These changes were accompanied with interstitial
oedema, acute plethora of blood vessels, stasis of erythrocytes.
Conclusion: COVID-19 infection responsible for the significant growth
of patient’s morbidity and mortality worldwide. Post-mortem examina-
tion is an essential tool in understanding pathogenesis and
pathomorphology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
Although the infection primarily affects the respiratory system, it is also
a multi-organ pathology, including gastrointestinal pathology. The virus
associated cells and tissue injuries along with presence of hemodynamic
disturbances, inflammatory reactions significantly contributed to death.
Further studies of the relationship between gastrointestinal tract disorders
and COVID-19 are considered necessary.

Disseminated trichinosis - case report of an uncommon parasitosis
M. Varela dos Santos*, J. Santos, C. Pontinha, M. Oliveira
*Central Lisbon University Hospital Centre, Portugal
Background & objectives: Trichinosis is an often unrecognized parasit-
osis and public health hazard, transmitted by ingestion of the nematode
Trichinella. Although it is uncommon in well-developed countries, it is
still present in Europe in the XXIst century.
Methods: A 56-year-old Nepalese man presented to the emergency de-
partment with a 1-month history of generalized myalgia, fatigue and
diarrhoea: his last visit to Nepal occurred 7 months prior to the onset of
symptoms. He presented with fever and a rash in his left thigh, and
laboratory studies showed a white-cell count of 17,000/μL with 10.1%
eosinophils.
Results: The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with severe
sepsis and submitted to lower extremity fasciotomy - after 7 days of
treatment with antibiotics and supportive therapy, to which he did not
respond favourably, muscle biopsies were performed (left quadriceps
femoris): histopathological analysis showed muscle tissue with countless
encapsulated cysts of Trichinella species.
15 days after presentation the patient died and an autopsy was performed:
samples of various skeletal muscles were obtained, which showed muscle
tissue with encapsulated cysts of Trichinella species on the left quadri-
ceps, pectoral muscles, intercostal muscles, diaphragm and temporal mus-
cles. A diagnosis of disseminated trichinosis was made.
Conclusion: Trichinosis is a parasitic disease transmitted by ingestion of
viable Trichinella larvae in undercooked meat, with pork and wild boar
meat being the primary sources of infection worldwide. Symptoms are
nonspecific, which hinders the diagnosis, and severity depends on the
amount of larvae consumed and conditions of the host.
Histopathological analysis of skeletal muscle samples may, along with
serologic testing, confirm the diagnosis.

The importance of specialist autopsy service in identification of cause
of failure and adjustment of structure of novel mechanical assist
device
K. Wassilew*
*Denmark
Background & objectives: After years spent on development of an
optimised mechanical assist device, few fatal outcomes associated with
malfunctioning of this novel device were reported. The aetiology of the
device malfunction remained unidentified at the early stage of the product
launch.
Methods: After product launch of Heartmate 3, end-stage left ventricular
heart failure of an elderly patient was initially successfully treated with
mechanical unloading of the left ventricle by this novel device. But soon
after surgical implantation, the clinical condition of the patient deteriorat-
ed, with a fatal outcome. With consent of the patients' relatives an autopsy
was performed by a cardiovascular pathologist.
Results: A to date of necropsy not photodocumented twisting of the inner
membrane of the pumps‘ outflow graft was detected, which likely would
have remained undetected by trainee pathologists. The finding was met
with scepticism by cardiologists and surgeons, as well as by industry, and
was suggested to represent an autopsy artefact.
Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of specialist autopsy
service, proper (photo-)documentation and open interdisciplinary com-
munication in a highly specialised university hospital setting, together
with the importance to keep updated on novel clinical developments, in
Virchows Arch
order to diagnose and communicate postmortem findings confidently,
even if they appear alogical or unlikely, and proves the role of pathology
in preventing further fatal outcomes caused by design flaws of novel
devices in the follow-up phase of the product launch.

Immunohistochemical expression of vascular endothelial growth fac-
tor (VEGF-A) in triple negative breast carcinoma and its correlation
with clinical and pathological factors

*Clinical Service of Pathology, “Sf. Apostol Andrei” Emergency County
Hospital, Constanţa, Romania / Center for Research and Development of
the Morphological and Genetic Studies of Malignant Pathology,
“Ovidius” University of Constanţa, Romania
Background & objectives: Triple-negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) is
a BC subtype with no “tailored” therapy. Our objective is to evaluate
immunohistochemical expression of VEGF-A and to correlate it with
other prognostic factors, in order to establish its potential role as a
predictive/prognostic biomarker.
Methods: The present study is a retrospective research encompassing 35
cases of TNBC selected from our hospital, during 1995-2020. Clinical and
morpho-pathological data were extracted from electronic records. All cases
were retrospectively reviewed and selected samples were submitted for
immunohistochemical analysis using VEGF-A; P53; Ki67 biomarkers.
The SPPS23.0 software for Windows was used to run the statistical
analysis
Results: The mean age of cases included in our research was 64 years-old
and the overexpression of VEGF-A was noticed in 65.7% of cases. The
most important clinic-morphological features which have been correlated
with this pattern of expression were lymph node status, angiolymphatic
invasion and TNM stage (p ˂ 0.001). The vast majority of TNBC had a
high proliferation rate (82.85%) and it was established a perfect associa-
tion with overexpression of VEGF-A (p˂0.001). Immunohistochemical
evaluation of p53 mutational status revealed that 37.14% presented a
mutated immunostaining pattern, most of them with “over-expression”
p53 type (69.23%). The mutational pattern of p53 was also correlated
with overexpression of VEGF-A (p=0.010).
Conclusion: The need to discover new therapeutic targets for TNBC is
imperative because chemotherapy alone is not sufficient to significantly im-
prove the survival of these patients. An additional therapy based on VEGF
inhibitors may have an important clinical response, improving the quality of
life for these patients. VEGF-A biomarker can be used as a prognostic and
predictive biomarker, but further studies and clinical trials are required.

Mammary tuberculosis masquerading as a primary breast tumour
S. Barbu*, A.C. Lisievici, T. Georgescu, F. Pop
*Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Although over one billion people suffer from
tuberculosis worldwide, mammary tuberculosis is an uncommon disease
even in countries where the incidence of pulmonary and extrapulmonary
tuberculosis is high, accounting for less than 1% of breast conditions.
Methods: We report the case of a 49-year-old female patient presenting
with a solitary, palpable, ill-defined, firm lump situated in the central quad-
rant of the right breast and measuring approximately 2 cm. Imaging exam-
ination reported a BI-RADS 4c lesion and the patient was referred to the
surgery department where she underwent right breast lumpectomy.
Results: Histopathological examination revealed multiple epithelioid cell
granulomas composed of Langhans cells, caseous necrosis and lympho-
cytes, scattered throughout fibroadipose tissue. There was no evidence of
microcalcifications, epithelial hyperplasia or malignancy. The pattern of
distribution, presence of necrosis and lack of suppurative inflammation
excluded a granulomatous lobular mastitis. Immunohistochemical stains
confirmed the presence of epithelioid cells (CD68 positive) accompanied
by a polyclonal lymphocyte population (CD3 and CD20 positive). Since
anti-MPT64 was not available, Ziehl-Neelsen stain was performed, which
revealed several acid-fast bacilli. Based on our findings, the patient
underwent subsequent CT scans, which revealed patchy pulmonary con-
solidation as well as poorly defined linear and nodular opacities, consis-
tent with a post-primary pulmonary tuberculosis.
Conclusion: Extrapulmonary tuberculosis occurring in the breast is very
rare and it is an uncommon disease even in countries where the incidence
of pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis is high. The first case of
breast tuberculosis was reported in 1829 by Sir Astley Cooper. The dis-
ease occurs far more frequently in women, especially in their reproductive
period. Clinical and imaging data may mimic a malignant neoplasm, but
primary breast tuberculosis should be taken into consideration in patients
from endemic areas.

Neuroendocrine neoplasms of the breast: study of 12 cases
A. Bchir*, N. Abdessayed, Y. Fejji, T. Zahmoul, M. Mokni
*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Neuroendocrine neoplasms are a rare sub-
type of breast cancers. It includes all tumours with predominant neuroen-
docrine differentiation. These neoplasms are classified into neuroendo-
crine tumour and neuroendocrine carcinoma. The aim of our study is to
discuss the clinico-pathological characteristics.
Methods: This is a retrospective study of 12 cases. Data was collected
from files of pathology Department of Farhat Hached University Hospital
over a period of 2001 and 2020.
Results: The mean age was 66.47 years with extremities ranged
between 43 and 89 years. The mean size was 3.76 cm (1- 8.4 cm).
Nodule was the most common symptom. Tumours were bifocal in 4
cases. 2 cases had mucinous differentiation and 10 cases were pure
neuroendocrine carcinomas. 8 cases were neuroendocrine tumours
and 4 cases were neuroendocrine carcinoma. All tumours were pos-
itives for synaptophysin and chromogranin A. 6 tumours were clas-
sified as stage I, 4 were stage II, one was stage III and one was stage
IV. There were 7 cases of luminal A type, 4 cases of luminal B type
and 1 case of basal type.
Conclusion: Neuroendocrine neoplasms of the breast affect postmeno-
pausal women in the sixth to seventh decade of life. Clinical presentation
is similar to NOS. The diagnosis of neuroendocrine differentiation re-
quires expression of the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin or
chromograninA. The main differential diagnosis is a metastatic neuroen-
docrine tumour from a non-mammary site. Neuroendocrine tumours are
low grade tumours with an outcome similar to NOS. Neuroendocrine
carcinomas are high grade tumours. Its morphology and prognostic is
similar to small cell carcinoma of the lung.

Background & objectives: Mammary fibromatosisis a rare and locally
aggressive benign tumour; it originates from fibroblasts / myofibroblasts
within the breast parenchyma and does not metastasize.
Through this study we tried to improve and add to the knowledge of this
disease.
Methods: This study included 7 women with desmoid-type fibromatosis
of the breast collected over a period of 5 years (2016- 2020) in the
department of pathology of the university hospital of Monastir.
Results: Patient’s ages ranged from 26 to 46 years. Breast imaging exam-
inations suggested an invasive breast tumour, likely carcinoma, infiltrating
the muscles of the chest wall. An ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy
revealed a low-grade myofibroblastic proliferation consistent with breast
fibromatosis in two cases. Other patients did not have needle biopsies and
underwent surgery. They underwent tumourectomies, with a partial resec-
tion of the underlying musculature. Macroscopically, tumours were firm
and white measuring between 2 and 9 cm. A definitive diagnosis of breast
fibromatosis was established from serial paraffin sectioning and immuno-
histochemistry using β-catenin. In three cases surgical margins were pos-
itive and one among these cases showed a relapse after 12 months.
Conclusion: Desmoid-like fibromatosis is a rare breast neoplasm.
Despite its classification as an intermediate soft-tissue tumour, breast
fibromatosis does possess the potential for aggressive local behaviour.
Breast imaging examinations are not specific for fibromatosis and often
imitate breast cancer. Surgery remains a valid option, however, preserva-
tion of function and quality of life are essential. The role of adjuvant
therapy is also not entirely clear, and the optimal regimes, doses and
durations of systemic treatment of the disease require elucidation.

Male breast carcinomas – a 20-year long series in a tertiary
Portuguese hospital
J. Boavida*, R. Moiteiro da Cruz, L. Correia
*Department of Pathology, Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN, Portugal
Background & objectives: Male Breast Carcinomas (MBC) account for
<1% of all cancers in men, largely characterized based on data from
female counterparts. This study aims to review several cases of MBC
from 2000-2020 registered in our department and contribute to their
portrayal.
Methods: Through the National Oncologic Registry, we compiled every
case of MBC registered in our hospital between 2000 and 2020, and 45
out of 87 cases were selected to our study; only cases with a pathology
report from our department were chosen. Both biopsies and surgical
specimens were considered and all available clinicopathological features
were summarized and analysed, accordingly.
Results: Median age of diagnosis was 66,1 years (range 36-86
years), occurring equally on both sides, mainly in the subareolar
region (n=30). 32 cases were diagnosed with invasive breast carci-
noma of no special type, 3 were invasive special types (2 mucinous
and 1 micropapillary), 3 were invasive encapsulated papillary carci-
nomas and 7 were in situ lesions. Pertaining to invasive carcinomas,
33 were Luminal A, 4 were Luminal B and 1 was triple-negative; 15
had lymph node metastasis (sentinel/axillary nodes) and 4 had dis-
tant metastasis reported. To date, 17 patients passed away but it was
not possible to evaluate overall survival since most cases did not
have information regarding cause of death.
Conclusion: Our study provided data consistent with current knowl-
edge of MBC, with the majority of cases being invasive breast
carcinomas of no special type, with a higher frequency of Luminal
A molecular subtype; we additionally concluded that most cases
were classified as stage I. Noticeably, this cements our understand-
ing of these neoplasms and while female breast carcinomas remain
the main source of evidence for treatment algorithms, further re-
search is needed on the optimization of management and therapeutic
decision-making in men.

One-step-nucleic-acid amplification (OSNA) for intraoperative eval-
uation of sentinel lymph node in breast cancer patients treated with
neoadjuvant therapy
A. Cordoba*, A. Pasco, A. Larrea, I. Amat, R. Beloqui, T. Labiano, D.
Guerro Setas
*Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: The evaluation of sentinel node (SN) in
breast cancer (BC) by one-step-acid-nucleic-amplification (OSNA) after
neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) is controversial. We evaluate the results
obtained from the incorporation of OSNA for the study of GC in BC
patients treated with NAT
Methods: Since June 2018, a total of 163 BC patients have undergone
surgery after NAT. In 42 of them, GC study was performed intraopera-
tively using the OSNA method. Data on the primary tumour, its pheno-
type, response grade, GC involvement, axillary involvement in positive
cases and post-neoadjuvant cytokeratin 19 are studied.
Results: OSNA was feasible in all the 42 patients, displaying grade 1, 2
and 3 in 1, 20 and 21 cases, respectively. One case was luminal A, 6
luminal B phenotype, 16 luminal B-HER2, 8 pure HER2 and 11 triple
negative. They showed a Miller-Payne grade 5,4,3 and 1 in 25, 4, 12 and
1, respectively. All the cases with residual tumour were Cytokeratin 19
positive.
Nodes studied by OSNA were negative in 34 patients. Isolated cell group,
micrometastases and macrometastases were detected in 1, 5, and 2 cases,
respectively. Lymph nodes at subsequent lymphadenectomy were nega-
tive in 7 cases and micrometastasis was observed in one case.
Conclusion: it is necessary to detect small metastases after NAT to be
treated with lymphadenectomy. We consider that OSNA has all the char-
acteristics that have led to its implementation in non-NAT:
-It is carried out intraoperatively and allows the study of the whole lymph
node, avoiding surgery.
-It allows the detection of small metastases associated with false-negative
cases.
-The only disadvantage we observe is the impossibility of obtaining the
residual cancer burden (RCB) in positive patients, although we can de-
termine the RCB-Class.

literature review
P.E. Dacosta Escobar*, D.S. Melgar Rivera, L. Naranjo Ruiz-Atienza, S.
Ramón y Cajal-Agüeras, V. Peg Cámara
*Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: Metaplastic breast carcinoma corresponds to
0.2-1% of all infiltrating breast carcinomas. We review metaplastic car-
cinomas diagnosed in our centre the last 7 years, low-grade
adenosquamous carcinoma (LGASC) among them, to see their preva-
lence and clinical or immunohistochemical differences.
Methods: A retrospective study has been carried out of all the breast
tumours in our centre diagnosed between 2014 and 2021 and the age at
diagnosis was collected as well as the immunohistochemical study of
biomarkers (hormone receptors, HER2), P53 and Ki67.
Results: 29 metaplastic carcinomas were identified, 2 cases (6.9%)
corresponded to LGASC, 10 (34.5%) to sarcomatoid carcinomas, 9
(31%) to squamous carcinomas, 7 (24.1%) to spindle cell carcinomas,
8%) and 1 (3.4%) to fibromatosis-like carcinoma. The hormone receptors
were negative in 89.7% of the cases (100% in the case of LGASC) and
P53 showed an altered pattern in 37.9% (50% in LGASC). The average
Ki67 was 53.3% [5-95], being 6.5% in the LGASC.
Conclusion: LGASC is a rare tumour within metaplastic breast carcino-
ma, with 2 cases identified in the last 7 years in our centre. Their age of
onset was higher than the average for metaplastic carcinomas and,
Virchows Arch
although they showed a triple negative immunohistochemical profile,
their low proliferative index (6.5%) stood out.

Circulating soluble HLA-G is increased in HER2+ breast cancer
patients: a meta-analysis
I. Zidi, K. Tizaoui, S. Dhouioui*, H. Ouzari, N. Boujelbene
*Laboratory Microorganismes and Active Biomolecules, Sciences
Faculty of Tunis, University Tunis El Manar, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Soluble plasmatic molecule HLA-G(sHLA-
G) is often associated with aggressive cancer types. We aimed to under-
stand the real implication of sHLA-G in aggressive breast cancer (BC),
and to resolve the limitation of insufficient statistical power and reduced
sample size in individual studies.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic literature search in Pubmed,
Medline, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science databases was performed
to look up for relevant studies. We identified 5 studies with a total of 401
BC patients and 298 healthy controls. The study of sHLA-G levels asso-
ciation to HER2 status is determined by calculating standardized mean
differences (SMD) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval(CI).
Results: In overall population, sHLA-G is statistically increased in HER-
BC patients as well as in HER+ BC patients compared to healthy controls
(Respectively: SMD=1.964; %95CI= 0.368-3.560, P=0.016 and
SMD=1.459; %95CI=0.058-2.860, P=0.041). In overall population, the
sHLA-G is slightly higher in patients with HER+ vs. HER- without sig-
nificance (P=0.411). Interestingly, Asians demonstrated significant in-
crease of sHLA-G in HER+ patients compared to HER- patients
(SMD=0.477; %95CI=0.104-0.849, P=0.012). This increase may explain
the aggressiveness and the rapid progression of HER2+ BC compared to
HER2- BC. However, this result should be taken with cautious because of
reduced meta-analysed studies.
Conclusion: Our meta-analysis revealed an increased sHLA-G levels in
patients expressing HER2 compared to patients HER2- and healthy con-
trols. Our findings suggested the complementary targeted therapy against
HER2 and HLA-G in BC expressing HER2 and high sHLA-G levels.
Further larger studies and well-designed studies still needed to clearly
establish our findings.

A study on tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, PD-L1 and BRCA1 im-
munohistochemical expression in basal-like subtype of breast cancer
P. Dimitrova*, S. Popovska, I. Ivanov
*Medical University, Pleven, Bulgaria
Background & objectives: The aim of the study was to determine basal-
like subtype of breast cancer (BC), its tumour expression of breast cancer
1 (BRCA1) protein, the predominant type of lymphocytes and the expres-
sion of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) by immune cells.
Methods: We studied 100 patients with invasive BC, grouped into four
surrogate molecular subtypes - Luminal A-like and Luminal B-like,
HER2 positive non-luminal and triple negative (TN), determined by im-
munohistochemical (IHC) method.
IHC was performed to find basal-like subtype of BC, to distinguish PD-
L1 and BRCA1 antigens and to detect subtypes lymphocytes, using
CD20, CD3, CD4, CD8 and FoxP3 antibodies.
Results: In our cases, the basal-like BC were mainly TN (p<0.05), mostly
with special histological subtypes (p=0.036). Their immune response was
represented predominantly by high concentration of intratumoral cytotox-
ic CD8+ T-lymphocytes (p<0.05) and stromal PD-L1 positive immune
cells (p=0.008). In these tumours, the BRCA1 expression was more often
absent in the tumour cells (p<0.001).
The basal-like subtype of BC and IHC negative expression of BRCA1
were associated with <5-year survival (p=0.001 and p=0.017,
respectively).
Conclusion: The established dependencies can be incorporated in a prog-
nostic algorithm and predictive morphological screening, allowing better
selection of patients with BC for subsequent genetic analysis of BRCA1
gene and for application of appropriate therapy.

Vacuum assisted breast biopsy: diagnostic and therapeutic
D. Doutel*, S. Santos, G. Freire, J. Marques, S. André
*Instituto Português de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Portugal
Background & objectives: Vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VAB) plays
a diagnostic and therapeutic role. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy
of this procedure in the management of breast lesions at a single
institution.
Methods: We carried out a retrospective study, of 221 VAB (guided by
stereotaxis or ultrasound) performed at a single institution over 15
months. We reviewed the imaging characteristics of the lesions, as well
as the histological slides from VAB and respective surgical specimen,
when available. Post VAB surgery was performed based on the
imagiological follow-up.
Results: Imaging characteristics pre-VAB: microcalcifications (56,1%);
nodules (33%); architectural distortion (4,5%) and density asymmetries
(2,3%).
Diagnosis by VAB: benign (44,8%); uncertain malignant potential/B3
(22,2%) including 23 papillomas (10.4%); ductal carcinoma in
situ/DCIS (23,5%); invasive carcinoma not otherwise specified/IC
(9,5%).
In 70 cases (31,7%) post-VAB surgery was necessary: 2,8% were benign
lesions; 15,7% B3 lesions; 54,3% DCIS; 27,1% IC.
No malignancy was found on the surgical specimens of benign and B3
lesions. Of 19 papillomas, only 1 was incompletely excised with VAB.
In DCIS' surgical specimens, there was no residual lesion in 5,2%;
microinvasive carcinoma was found in 10,5% and IC in 10,5%, one of
these with a 3 mm axillary metastasis.
Conclusion: The low percentage of cases submitted to surgery post-VAB
proves its efficacy in the management of benign and also in B3 lesions,
with emphasis in the total excision of papillomas. Of the DCIS cases that
went through surgery, we found no residual tumour in 5,2% and malig-
nancy in 21,1%, half of these with microinvasion.

*Pathology Department, Bellvitge University Hospital, IDIBELL,
Barcelona, Spain
Background & objectives: RANK pathway inhibition could prevent
and/or treat breast carcinoma (BC) and regulate the tumour immune
crosstalk in BC. We are running D-BIOMARK, a prospective, random-
ized pre-operative study evaluating denosumab (anti-RANKL) and its
biological effects in early-stage BC.
Methods: Early-stage HER2-negative-BC, candidates to tumour excision
as first therapeutic approach were included. Patients were randomized
into two groups: 2:1 to denosumab: control (no treatment).
Experimental arm received 2 doses of subcutaneous denosumab 2-
4weeks before surgery. Clinicopathological parameters were recorded.
Ki67, cleaved caspase-3 and stromal tumour infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs) were assessed in biopsy and surgical resection specimen (pre-
and post-denosumab).
Results: We present results from the first 36 patients enrolled out of 60.
Clinical and tumour characteristics were well balanced between the
Virchows Arch
groups. No clinically relevant differences in Ki67 or cleaved caspase-3
were observed after denosumab treatment. Interestingly, an increase of
TILs was observed in the denosumab treated group (p=0.03, Paired t test),
but not in the control group (p=0.80). A 33% of patients treated
denosumab showed a ≥10% increase in TILs vs 0% in the control group
(p =0.05).
Conclusion: Short term neoadjuvant denosumab increases TILs in early
BC.

Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) expression in breast carci-
nomas with neuroendocrine morphologies: application and future
prospective

Enomoto, M. Saitoh, T. Tashima, Y. Tanisaka, Y. Horita, T. Hamaguchi,
H. Kagamu
*Saitama Medical University, Japan
Background & objectives: INSM1 was recently demonstrated to be a
better diagnostic and prognostic indicator for small cell pulmonary carci-
noma than the traditional ‘gold-standard’ neuroendocrine (NE) markers,
i.e. chromogranin A and synaptophysin.
Methods: Herein, for the first time, we present three cases with NE
phenotype mammary neoplasms in which the NE nature of the tumours
was confirmed solely by INSM1. This is also the first analysis to use
INSM1, a promising antibody with high sensitivity and specificity, in
the field of breast oncology.
Results: Three patients were, respectively, 42-, 58- and 64-year-old
Japanese women with breast tumours showing characteristic NE
morphologies: 1) Neuroendocrine tumour, grade 2, 2) Cellular mu-
cinous carcinoma, and 3) Neuroendocrine ductal carcinoma in situ.
On immunohistochemical examinations, these malignancies showed
diffuse nuclear expressions of INSM1, whereas chromogranin A and
synaptophysin staining did not correspond to distinct NE features in
the neoplastic cytoplasm, despite appropriate positive and negative
controls having been provided for these NE stained sections. In
addition, we could not detect INSM1-reactive cells in breast paren-
chyma surrounding the tumours.
Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) could be regarded as a rare, distinc-
tive type of aggressive mammary carcinoma.
Conclusion: Intriguingly, in the lung oncology field, it was very recently
reported that outcomes were significantly poorer in NEN patients with
high-INSM1 than those with low-INSM1 reactivity.
Based on the establishment of INSM1 accompanied by our current im-
munohistochemical results, the frequency of detecting NE differentiation
in systemic neoplasms, including breast NENs, is anticipated to increase.
Our observations might ultimately contribute to the development of novel
treatments including molecular-targeted therapies for these invasive tu-
mour entities.

Andriushchenko, A. Romaniuk, R. Moskalenko
*Sumy State University, Ukraine
Background & objectives: Recently, attention has been given to the
study of prolactin receptors (PRL-R) on the development of benign breast
tumours (BBT). The aim: to investigate the relationship between PRL-R
expression and the development of BBT.
Methods: 16 samples of BBT and 16 samples of intact tissue were taken
for the study. We considered serum PRL levels, according to which
patients were divided into two groups: group I - with normal serum
prolactin (8 women) and group II - with elevated serum prolactin (8
women). BBT tissue was examined using histological, immunohisto-
chemical methods and Western blotting.
Results: The middle age of the women in the BBT study was 27.9 ± 1.55
years, ranging from 19 to 39 years. Expression rates of PRL-R in BBT
tissue (39.97 ± 2.1) and intact MG tissue (35.56 ± 3.6) did not differ
significantly (p> 0.05). In women of group I, a strong positive association
was found between PRL-R expression in BBT tissue and serum prolactin
levels (p <0.05; p = 0.8). Comparison of middle PRL-R expression values
in benign tumour tissues and intact MG tissues of patients with elevated
PRL levels did not show a significant difference between these indicators
(p> 0.05).
Conclusion: Therefore, the level of PRL-R expression does not affect
benign pathology of the breast.

Background & objectives: N-myc downstream-regulated
gene1(NDRG1) is widely described as a distant metastasis suppressor
in breast cancer(BC). However, the related mechanism has not been fully
discovered yet. In our study, we purposed to investigate the relationship
between NDRG1 and lymph node BC metastasis.
Methods: NDRG1 levels in tissue microarrays from 358 BC patients
were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining with NDRG1
(ЕР200, Abcam, USA). NDRG1 staining was predominantly cytoplas-
mic/membranous. NDRG1-scoring was done according to the German
semi-quantitative scoring system (intensity and percentage of stained tu-
mour cells). Tumours with score 1–4 were considered as negative
(NDRG1-low), whereas tumours with score 5–12 were considered as
positive (NDRG1-high).
Results: NDRG1-high BC tumours were significantly more often detect-
ed (136 cases, 60.2%) in the patients group without lymph nodes
metastases(group 1) than in those with metastases(group 2)(62 cases,
47%)(p=0.015). The absence of NDRG1 expression was observed with
the same frequency in the two compared groups(18.1%). The intensity of
NDRG1 expression was higher in the group 1(25.7%) compared to the
group 2(21.2%). No significant difference was obtained(p = 0.576). The
significant difference was found in the two compared groups for moderate
and weak NDRG1 expression. In the group 2 weak intensity expression
of the marker was more often observed (34.8%), while in the group 1
moderate NDRG1 expression was more common (34.5%).
Conclusion: NDRG1 was a significant independent prognostic factor of
lymph nodes metastases in BC. The intensity of the marker expression
was statistically significant (p=0.015). In samples with NDRG1- moder-
ate expression the risk of lymph node metastasis was lower than when the
staining of tumour cells was weak (p=0.045). NDRG1-low expression
has a reverse correlation with breast cancer metastasis and progression,
and may serve as a predictive biomarker of lymph node involvement.

lar subtypes and clinicopathological features
V. Kometova*, L. Mikhaleva, M. Rodionova, M. Dardyk, V. Rodionov
*V.I. Kulakov NMRC of OGaP, Russian Federation
Background & objectives: Matrix metalloproteinase-2(MMP-2) is
gelatinase that plays a role in invasion and metastasis of cancer through
Virchows Arch
the destruction of basal membrane and extracellular matrix. The study is
aimed to investigate MMP-2 expression levels in breast cancer(BC) and
their relationship with molecular subtypes.
Methods: MMP-2 expression levels were studied in 358 tissue microar-
rays of BC specimens and their association with 5 molecular subtypes was
evaluated by immunohistochemical cytoplasmic staining with MMP-2
(EPR1184, Abcam, USA). MMP2-scoring was done according to intensity
of stained tumour cells. The staining scores for MMP-2 were negative in 96
cases(26.8%), mild in 184 cases(51.4%), and strong in 78 cases(21.8%).
Results: MMP-2 expression was increased in BC with HER2/neu
overexpression, regardless of hormon receptor status. Strong
MMP-2 expression was detected in 66.7% of luminal B HER2-
positive subtype BCs and in 53.3% of non-luminal HER2-positive
BC subtype. Only 1 case of BC with HER2/neu overexpression was
MMP2-negative (p<0.001). There were only 10 (6.2%) cases with
strong MMP2-expression and 76 (79.2%) MMP2-negative cases in
luminal-A subtype BC. Regarding luminal-A subtype, MMP-2-
negative and mild expression was observed in 45.8% and 93.8%
cases respectively in comparison to luminal-B Her2-negative BC
subtype (6.7% and 73.3%) (p<0.001). The number of MMP2-
negative cases was lower than in TNBC (6.7% and 30.6% respec-
tively), but without statistical significance(p=0.158).
Conclusion: MMP2-expression is associated with molecular BC sub-
types (p<0.001). MMP2-negative BC positively correlates with
luminal-A subtype. MMP-2 expression is increased in TNBC and in cases
with HER2 over-expression (p<0.001). Furthermore, strong MMP-2 ex-
pression correlates with larger tumour size (p<0.001), high-grade
(p<0.001) and tumours with lymph nodes metastases (p<0.001). No cor-
relation was found between MMP-2 expression and patient’s
age(p=0.061), tumour localization(p=0,113), number of tumour
nodes(p=0.619), hystologic BC type (p=0.417). These results suggest that
MMP-2 plays a role in the biology of BC.

Heterogeneity of Ki67 expression in local metastases of breast cancer
depends on the surrogate subtype of the primary tumour
K. Konyshev*, S. Sazonov
*Institute of Medical Cell Technologies, Ural State Medical University,
Russia
Background & objectives: Ki67 is an important prognostic and predic-
tive marker for breast cancer. Its heterogeneity could affect the treatment
results. Objective of the study: to discover Ki67 level stability in local
metastasis of Luminal A-like and Luminal B-like breast cancer primary
tumour.
Methods: 66 patients having breast cancer with local metastases
and Luminal A or Luminal B surrogate subtype of primary tumour
were included in the study. Antibodies to ER (1D5), PR (PgR636),
Ki67 (MIB-1) and Her2/neu (4B5) were used. Changes of Ki67
expression (threshold – 30%) in primary and metastatic tumours
were counted and compared in groups with different primary tu-
mour subtypes.
Results: In the group with Luminal A subtype of primary tumour Ki67-
status of primary tumour and metastases was discordant in 8 of 50 cases
(16,0%, 95% CI 7,6-29,7%), while in group with Luminal B subtype – in
11 of 16 cases (68,7%, 95% CI 41,5-87,9%). The difference of discov-
ered frequencies is statistically significant (Fisher exact probability test)
(p<0,01).
Conclusion: Proliferation status of breast cancer is discordant in primary
and metastatic tumour depending on the surrogate subtype of the primary
tumour. In cases with Luminal B subtype Ki67 status of the metastasis
changes more frequently than in cases with Luminal A subtype of the
primary tumour.

Study on the heterogeneity of expression of PD-L1 (Ventana SP142)
in breast cancer in space and time
J. He, Y. Liu*
*The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, China
Background & objectives: Tumour has a certain degree of heterogene-
ity, which brings a challenge for clinicians to choose PD-L1 detection
time for breast cancer patients. Therefore, the heterogeneous expression
of Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) in breast cancer needs to be studied in depth.
Methods: 124 surgical specimens, 5 tissues were penetrated in each case.
298 cases of primary breast cancer and its matched metastases were
stained with PD-L1 to explore the differences in expression. 71 cases of
PD-L1 positive invasive breast cancer specimens were included at differ-
ent temperatures and different time nodes. Compare the expression of
PD-L1 with the corresponding fresh slices.
Results: When the number of punctured tissues increased from 1 to 5, the
κ value of PD-L1 expression and PD-L1 expression in surgical specimens
gradually increased from 0.165 to 0.615, and κ was 0.499 for 3, reaching a
moderate consistency. The positive rate of PD-L1 in different metastatic
organs is different. With the extension of the storage time of paraffin
sections, the PD-L1 antigen is gradually lost, and the positive rate gradually
decreases. The expression of PD-L1 in slices stored at room temperature
for 1 and 2 weeks is more consistent than that of fresh slices (ICC≥0.9).
Conclusion: The expression of PD-L1 in primary breast cancer and
paired metastatic breast cancer is different, and the expression of PD-L1
in metastases needs to be reassessed. Long-term storage of paraffin sec-
tions will cause the expression level of PD-L1 to decrease and refrigerated
storage at 4°C or -20°C is recommended, and the storage time should not
exceed one month.

Changes in the positive rate of HER2 expression may indicate the
progression of early breast cancer
D. Han, M. Yue, M. Zhao, Y. Liu*
*The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, China
Background & objectives: To explore the relationship between the ex-
pression of HER2 and clinicopathological characteristics in patients with
microinvasive breast cancer and T1a breast cancer. To analyse the con-
sistency of HER2 expression in carcinoma in situ and invasion foci.
Methods: 217 cases of breast microinvasive carcinoma and T1a patients
admitted to the hospital from January 2015 to June 2020 in the Fourth
Hospital of Hebei Medical University were collected. Interpret the HER2
expression status of the carcinoma in situ and the infiltrated area respec-
tively. Combining pathological features and morphological features to
construct a nomogram to predict the HER2 expression status.
Results: High nuclear grade, comedy type necrosis, high TILs infiltration
and high proliferation index are more likely to have HER2 positive ex-
pression. There was no significant difference in the expression of HER2
in microinvasive breast carcinoma and T1a in carcinoma in situ and
invasive area. The overall agreement rate of HER2 expression of carci-
noma in situ and invasive area was 97.7%.The feature with the strongest
correlation with the HER2 positive rate is the diameter of the invasion
foci. When the diameter of the invasion foci>2mm, the positive rate of
HER2 decreases significantly (52.6%-16.1%, p<0.001). The molecular
type has changed (c2=9.725, p=0.045), and the lymph node metastasis
rate is increased (2.6%-8.9%, p=0.426).
Conclusion: The HER2 expression in the carcinoma in situ area can be
referred to. Compared with T1a stage breast cancer with an invasion foci
of 1-2 mm in diameter, breast cancer patients with an invasion foci of 2-
5 mm in diameter are more malignant, and HER2 targeted therapy is
recommended for HER2-positive breast cancer patients with an invasion
foci of 2 to 5 mm in diameter.

Establishment and verification of a prognostic prediction model for
non-pCR patients after neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer
J. Li, Y. Liu*
*The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, China
Background & objectives: The purpose is to establishment and verifi-
cation of a prognostic prediction model for non-pCR patients after neo-
adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.
Methods: Patients who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer
from 2009 to 2017 and were surgically removed after neoadjuvant
therapy. All pathological results included histological grade, Tils,
ER, PR, HER2 and Ki67. R language is used to calculate the calibra-
tion degree and ROC curve of the prediction model in the training set
and the verification set.
Results: In the training set, the prediction model's 3-year and 5-year
survival rate AUC values were 0.93 and 0.80, and the RCB classification
3-year and 5-year survival rate AUC values were 0.69 and 0.65. Relative
to the RCB classification, the prediction model can more accurately pre-
dict the OS of non-pCR patients after neoadjuvant treatment. The same
results are also shown in the classification of HR, HER2+ and TN. The
RCB classification predicts HR 3-year and 5-year survival rates AUC
values of 0.77 and 0.72; predicted HER2+ 3-year and 5-year survival
rates AUC values of 0.79 and 0.62; predicted 3-year and 5-year survival
rates of TN group AUC value of 0.83, 0.69.
Conclusion: We have combined a variety of prognostic factors re-
lated to breast cancer through R software and developed a more
accurate prediction model than RCB classification to evaluate the
prognosis of non-pCR patients after neoadjuvant treatment of
breast cancer and provide further clinical treatment Provide a basis
for decision-making.

*UGC Anatomía Patológica, Hospital Universitario de Jaén, Spain
Background & objectives: Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is the
most aggressive molecular type of breast cancer. Herein we assess the
prognostic role of NDRG1 (a gene of the TGF-beta pathway) and its
phosphorylated form (pNDRG1) in a series of TNBC.
Methods: Eighty-three cases of TNBC (All female, age: 23-86 years,
follow up: 66-264 months) were included in this study.
Immunohistochemistry for NDRG1 and pNDRG1 was performed, scor-
ing intensity and extension of the staining on digital images obtained with
a 3DHISTECH preparation scanner.
Statistical analysis assessed the association of the degree of staining with
survival, development of recurrence, metastases, and histological
parameters.
Results: Seventy-three cases were infiltrating ductal carcinoma
(85.9%), frequently in stages pT1 (31, 36.5%) and pT2 (36, 42.4%)
and there were lymph node metastases in 23 cases (28%) and distant
metastases in 1 case (1.2%). 34 (40%). patients died from disease
(DFD) during follow-up.
NDGR1 and pNDRG1 was detected in 67.5% and 67.5%, respectively
mainly at cytoplasmic level, with a lesser nuclear staining.
Nuclear NDRG1 expression is higher in DFD (11.92 vs 2.99%, p = 0.03)
and cytoplasmic in recurrences (35.82 vs 19.99%, p = 0.04). On the
contrary, pNDGR1 is higher in survivors without disease (30%)
compared to active disease (3.88%) or DFD (18.05%), although without
statistical significance.
Conclusion: NDGR1 expression in TNBC seems to be associated with
parameters of tumour aggressiveness, in contrast to the expression of its
phosphorylated form, which shows a trend to be expressed in cases with
better biological behaviour. Further studies on larger series are needed to
clarify its prognostic role in this area.

Digital image analysis is a robust method for evaluation of tumour-
associated macrophages in breast cancer
K.H.L. Nielsen*, P.S. Nielsen, T. Tramm
*Dept. of Pathology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark
Background & objectives: Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs)
may be of prognostic value in breast cancer. The objective was to inves-
tigate agreement between 1) estimation of CD68+ TAMs by “eye-
balling” and digital-image-analysis (DIA) and 2) assessment of TAMs
on tissue-micro-arrays (TMAs) and whole-slide-sections (WS).
Methods: Tumour-containing tissue blocks and TMAs (1 core/patient)
were available from 1167 BC patients. Immunohistochemistry for CD68
were performed on TMAs (991 pts.) and on corresponding WS from 234
patients. Fraction of CD68+ TAMs was estimated semi quantitatively by
2 observers (KH, TT) using light microscopy (“eyeballing”) and quanti-
tatively by DIA on scanned slides as a continuous area-fraction.
Results: Evaluation of CD68 was successful in 991/1167 TMA cores and
223/234 WS. Interobserver agreement for “eyeballing” on WS was mod-
erate with an intraclass-coefficient (ICC) of 0.72 (95%Cl: 0.65-0.78).
Kappa coefficient was 0.40 when grouping the results into 6 categories
(0-0.01, 0.02-0.10, 0.11-0.20, 0.21-0.30, 0.31-0.40, >0.41), increasing to
0.53 for 3 categories (0-0.10, 0.11-0.30, >0.31). A minority of tu-
mours(21/991) showed high level of TAMs (> 0.31).
Correlation between TMAs vs. WS was highly significant by
”eyeballing” as well as by DIA with Spearman correlation coefficients
of 0.55 and 0.62 (p<0.0001), respectively. A strong significant correlation
was found between DIA and “eye-balling” for both WS and TMAs
(p<0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test).
Conclusion: The interobserver agreement by “eye-balling” was moder-
ate, whereas correlation between “eye-balling” and DIA was highly sig-
nificant. The association between TMAs and WS by DIA and “eye-
balling” was found to be highly significant indicating that CD68-
assesment can be performed on, e.g., biopsies. This indicates that DIA
may be a useful tool for estimating TAMs with the perspective of deliv-
ering a more reproducible and quantifiable estimate and securing the
analytical validity of CD68 as a potential biomarker.

Background & objectives: Breast carcinoma is the most common ma-
lignant tumour in young women, with higher mortality rate compared
with older population. The aim of present study was to reveal the pecu-
liarities of breast cancer’ molecular phenotype in patients under 35 years
old.
Methods: We examined the pathologic features and molecular tumour’
phenotype in 35 young women (aged ≤35years) with invasive breast
cancer. Medical records were reviewed for clinical characteristics.
Breast tissue histological slides H&E stained observed under a micro-
scope. Hormonal status, Her2/neu status and Ki 67 were determined by
Virchows Arch
immunochemical (IHC) staining. Histologic grading of breast carcinoma
was performed by Elston and Ellis method.
Results: Among 1009 cases of breast cancer 35 young women were
selected for study group. The most frequent histological diagnosis was
invasive carcinoma of a nonspecific type (91%), invasive lobular carci-
noma was established in 8% of cases and 1 % -was mucous cancer.
Analysis of IHC studies revealed the predominance of the molecular
genetic subtype - luminal B HER2 positive with a high index of prolifer-
ative activity Ki-67 (52%). Luminal A was 32% of cases, triple negative
subtype was established in 8% of cases and HER2-positive in 8% of
cases. Most often, the molecular genetic subtype luminal B HER2-
positive corresponded to invasive nonspecific cancer with a high index
of proliferative activity.
Conclusion: Our findings have shown that the group of young women
presented with a different variation of molecular phenotypes compared to
the general population of women with breast carcinoma. The most com-
mon molecular genetic subtype of breast cancer in young women under
35 y.o. was luminal B HER2-positive molecular phenotype. These results
are discussed with regard to the pathogenesis and prognosis of the neo-
plasia in young women. The data obtained should be taken into account
when developing the adjuvant therapy algorithm.

Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, Italy
Background & objectives: ASCO/CAP guidelines recommend HER2
status assessment on newly diagnosed breast cancer due to its prognostic
and predictive impact. Currently, a combination of immunohistochemis-
try (IHC) and in-situ hybridization (ISH) is recommended. We evaluated
the reproducibility of HER2 assessment with IHC alone.
Methods: At our Institution, 1654 patients underwent both bioptical and
surgical procedure between January 2014 and December 2020. Patients
with in situ, microinvasive or multicentric carcinomas, and patients treat-
ed with neoadjuvant therapy were excluded. The final cohort comprised
923 patients. ErbB2 IHC staining was performed with Dako AcP A0485
on OMNIS platform and scored according to 2018 guidelines.
Results: Overall concordance for ErbB2 IHC was 88.95% (821/923), in
line with the literature-reported values for IHC alone. Revision of the 102
discordant cases revealed that only 7 (<1%) had the potential to signifi-
cantly impact on the therapeutic choices for the patient (either negative/
equivocal to positive or positive to negative changes between biopsy and
surgical specimen). All other discordant results were between negative
and equivocal status and, according to current guidelines for neoadjuvant
treatment, would have not resulted in either over-treatment or under-
treatment of the patient.
Conclusion: HER2 status has a tremendous impact on the prognosis and
treatment of the patient and must be assessed in a timely and precise
manner to ensure the best treatment is administered. Although the com-
bination of IHC and ISH is to be preferred for its accuracy, our data
suggests that IHC alone could be a valid alternative in settings in which
cost or availability do not allow for ISH testing on all newly diagnosed
cases, restricting ISH testing to equivocal cases.

Background & objectives: Current research in tumour microenviron-
ment (TME) of breast cancer focuses mainly on molecular subtype and
receptor status. In this work, we compare TME characteristics between no
special type and lobular breast cancer to ascertain if a correlation with
histotype exists.
Methods: At our Institution, 1724 patients underwent surgery for breast
cancer (January 2012-December 2018). Patients who received neoadju-
vant therapy were excluded. A final cohort of 1395 invasive breast cancer
was considered; 1047 were diagnosed as no special type, 190 as lobular,
and 158 as other histotypes. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs) were assessed semi-quantitatively and grouped into a "brisk" or
"non-brisk" category.
Results: Among the 1021 no-special type cases in which TILs were
assessed, "brisk" TILs were found to be associated with histologic grade
of the tumour: 7% in the G1 group (8/113), 19% of the G2 group (106/548),
and 48% of the G3 group (171/360). In contrast, grade did not seem to
impact the adaptive immune response in lobular carcinoma, and "brisk"
infiltrate showed an analogous distribution: 17% in the G2 group (27/155)
and 22% in the G3 group (7/32). This is not unexpected, as the no-special
type histotype includes most of the triple-negative and HER2-enriched in-
vasive breast cancer, which are found to be associated with increased TILs.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that in no-special type breast cancer TILs
appear to parallel histologic grade and could reflect the increased genomic
instability of high-grade cancers. In contrast, lobular carcinoma may rep-
resent a subtype of breast cancer in which adaptive immune response is
underregulated, possibly underlying a low genomic instability and con-
sequent low burden of neoantigens. As more therapies emerge for which
TILs could represent a predictive factor, a more comprehensive under-
standing of its significance in breast cancer is needed.

*Unit of Anatomic Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine,
Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, Italy
Background & objectives: The introduction of therapies targeting ge-
nomic instability (e.g. PARP inhibitors) has made it crucial to gain a
deeper understanding of the impact of genomic instability on breast can-
cer. Here we investigate the relationship of genomic instability with tu-
mour microenvironment.
Methods: At our Institution, 1724 patients underwent surgery for
invasive breast cancer (January 2012-December 2018). A cohort
of 1003 patients was analysed by immunohistochemistry and
grouped based on their molecular subtypes into three copy-number
alterations (CNA) patterns identified by Kwei et al. ("simple", "am-
plifier", and "complex"). Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs) were assessed semi-quantitatively and grouped into a "brisk"
or "non-brisk" category.
Results: In our cohort, "brisk" TILs were found to be significantly asso-
ciated with the CNA-associated patterns defined by Kwei et al. Infiltrate
was categorized as "brisk" in 15% in tumours belonging to the "simple"
pattern (59/402), in 34% of the tumours belonging to the "amplified"
pattern (184/534), and in 52% of the tumours belonging to the "complex"
pattern (35/67). Although the use of molecular classification as a surro-
gate for CNAs is not as precise as the actual genetic analyses, the corre-
spondence between these classes and the CNAs-associated pattern is
supported in the literature.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that genetic instability could have a role in
eliciting a strong stromal lymphocytic response in breast cancer, and we
postulate this to be due to an increased number of neoantigens contribut-
ing to generate and maintain this response. In light of the current and
upcoming therapies targeting genomic instability, the identification of
Virchows Arch
surrogate markers to evaluate this instability, including TILs, will become
crucial in the understanding and management of breast cancer.

*CHU Mongi Slim La Marsa, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Nottingham histologic grading has become
widely accepted as a powerful indicator of prognosis in breast cancer. The
objective of this study was to evaluate the interobserver variability of this
grade in scoring breast cancer in core biopsies among 2 pathologists.
Methods: This is a retrospective study of 65 cases of invasive ductal
carcinoma that were independently evaluated by two pathologists and
graded according to the Nottingham histologic system. A detailed histo-
pathological assessment was carried out and analysed statistically using
the Kappa agreement score.
Results: The mean size of biopsies was 15 mm. There was a substantial
agreement among the 2 pathologists in scoring tubular formation, pleo-
morphism, and final grading (Kappa=0.7, 0.65 and 0.8 respectively). A
fair agreement was noted in scoring mitosis (Kappa=0.35).
Conclusion: The interobserver variability of Nottingham grading in scor-
ing breast cancer in core biopsies remains good. The relatively weak
agreement in scoring mitosis is secondary to the small size of the mi-
cro-biopsies, not covering the 2 mm2 fields necessary to grade this pa-
rameter. This often leads to an extrapolation of the number of mitoses.

High tumour-stroma ratio in oestrogen receptor-positive breast can-
cer is correlated to poor histopathological parameters
G. Sarra*, S. Ben Slama, N. Ben Othman, A. Lahmar, D. Bacha
*CHU Mongi Slim La Marsa, Tunisia
Background & objectives: In breast cancer, attention has focused on the
prognostic value of tumour- stroma ratio (TSR), mainly in the triple-
negative subtype. The objective of this study was to determine the prog-
nostic value of TSR in oestrogen receptor (ER) positive invasive breast
carcinomas.
Methods: TSR was measured in hematoxylin and eosin-stained surgical
specimens of 70 consecutive EP positive breast carcinomas. Scoring per-
centages were given per 10-fold per image field. Tumours with a low ratio
had ≥50% of stroma and a high ratio had <50% of stroma. The relation-
ship of TSR to routinely used prognostic histopathological parameters
was analysed.
Results: All tumours were of no special type. The mean age of patients
was of 65 years. There was no multifocality. Sixty percent of tumours had
a high ratio and 40% a low ratio. High ratio tumours were significantly
correlated with large size (p=0.02), grade 3 (p=0.045), presence of vas-
cular invasion (p=0.0034) and lymph node metastasis (p=0.0012). No
significant association was found with the mitotic activity index and
HER2 status.
Conclusion: High TSR was related to poor histopathological parameters
in EP positive breast carcinomas, contrasting data in triple-negative breast
cancer, and highlighting the importance of considering ER status when
interpreting the prognostic value of TSR.

*CHU Mongi Slim La Marsa, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Breast cancer in young women has gained
increased attention with an attempt to improve diagnosis and prognosis.
The objectives of this study was to analyse the clinico-pathological fea-
tures of breast cancer occurring in young women under 30 years.
Methods: We retrospectively studied 27 cases of histologically con-
firmed breast cancer, collected during 8 years, in gynaecology and pa-
thology departments of our institution. All patients were under 30 years of
age at diagnosis. Clinical data, pathological investigations and outcome
statistics were analysed.
Results: The average age was 26.5 years. The tumour was T4 in 35% of
cases and M1 in 3 patients. Treatment was radical in 60% of cases.
Histological type was an invasive ductal carcinoma in all cases (grade
III 35 %). Lymph node involvement was noted in 27.5%.Phenotype
was:HER2 in 7 cases, triple negative in 8 cases, luminal A and B in 6
cases each. Chemo and radio therapies were performed in respectively 90
and 95% of cases, Hormone and targeted therapies were performed in
40% and 25% of cases respectively. Recurrences were noted in 25% of
cases, distant metastases in 45% of cases and disease related dealth in
12% of cases. BRCA1 was positive in 5 patients.
Conclusion: Breast cancer in young women seems to be highly hetero-
geneous and has potentially aggressive and complex biological features.

Association between positive lymph node ratio and prognostic clini-
copathologic factors in breast cancer with axillary involvement
T. Soylemez Akkurt*, B. Pehlivanoglu, B. Calim Gurbuz, H. Izol
Ozmen, C. Tanik
*Basaksehir Cam and Sakura City Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Recently, the ratio of the number of the
metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) to the total number of examined LNs
(LNR) has been suggested as a prognostic factor in breast cancer. Here,
we investigated the association between clinicopathological parameters
and LNR.
Methods: This study included 83 consecutive female patients with LN-
positive breast cancer who underwent partial/radical mastectomy with
axillary LN dissection. Clinicopathological parameters were retrospec-
tively retrieved from patient records. LNR was defined as the ratio of
positive nodes to total number of examined nodes. The relationship be-
tween LNR and clinicopathological parameters was statistically analysed.
Results: Median age was 51±1.7 years (range 30-82). The mean number
of LNR and positive LNs was 0.3 (0.04-1) and 4.4 (range 1-27), respec-
tively. More than half of the patients (51.8%, n=43) were pN1a. In uni-
variate analysis, larger tumour size (advanced pT), presence of
lymphovascular invasion (LVI), extranodal extension (ENE), and stage
were significantly associated with higher LNR (p<0.05). A positive LN
number of ≥4 was significantly associated with higher mitotic scores,
advanced pT, presence of LVI and perineural invasion, and ENE
(p<0.05). However, in multivariate logistic regression analysis, only
ENE was significantly associated with LNR and positive LN number
(p=0.011, OR=5.05, 95% CI=1.458–17.511, p=0.003, OR=7.135, 95%
CI=1.942–26.216, respectively).
Conclusion: Unfavourable histopathological features were associated
with LNR and the number of positive nodes but we could not verify most
of these associations by multivariate analysis due to small number of
patients. On the other hand, the significant association of ENE with
LNR and the presence of ≥4 positive LNs was confirmed by multivariate
analysis. We speculate that the presence of ENE in sentinel LNs may
provide a clue in predicting pN but prospective studies are needed to test
this hypothesis.

Dabbagh, S. Alhassoon, D. Al-Rimawi
*KHCC, Jordan
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: In 2006 we published our breast cancer
oestrogen receptors (ER)/progesterone receptors (PgR)/Her2 rates in
Jordan which were 50.8%/57.5%/17.5% respectively for ductal and
68%/90.9%/13.6% for lobular. An update of these rates is warranted in
view of remarkable socioeconomic and technical changes.
Methods: 1185 breast cancer cases were accessioned in our department
between January and December 2018. ER/PgR and HER-2/neu results
were retrospectively collected from patients’ pathology reports. They
were originally evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). In addition,
evaluation of HER2/neu was done by fluorescent in-situ-hybridization in
IHC equivocal cases. The testing was originally interpreted according to
the 2013 CAP-ASCO guidelines.
Results: 867 (73.2%) cases were ductal, 669 (77.2%) of which were ER-
positive, 663 (76.5%) PgR positive, 223 (25.7%) HER2/neu-positive and
86 (9.9%) were triple negative (TN). 86 (7.3%) were lobular carcinomas,
83 (96.5%) of which were ER-positive, 76 (88.4%) PgR positive, 5
(6.6%) were HER2/neu-positive and 2 cases (2.3%) were TN.
232 (19.6%) cases represented other variants, 32 (13.8%) of which were
TN.
The total number of TN was 120 (10.1%). The number of low ER (1-9%)
cases was 33 (2.8%), low PgR (1-9%) was 99 (8.4%). The number of
cases with low both ER and PgR status was 4 (0.3%). The number of
triple positive cases was 131 (11.1%).
Conclusion: There is a significant change in the rates of ER/PgR
between 2006 and 2018 (p= 0.0001 and 0.0043 respectively for the
ductal and <0.001 for ER in lobular). There is also a substantial
difference although not statistically significant in HER2 rates. The
reasons behind this change are not known but we may hypothesize
that improved IHC quality and the accumulated experience of pa-
thologists in addition to adoption of a more westernized lifestyle by
patients as possible contributors.

Analysis of prescribed adjuvant therapy for early triple-positive
breast cancer
M. Urezkova*, A. Artemyeva, T. Semiglazova, A. Kudaybergenova
*N.N.Petrov Center of oncology, Russia
Background & objectives: Adjuvant therapy - gold standard for BC
therapy. It is based on the stage and the surrogate tumour subtype. For
ВС with HR expression and HER2 overexpression (TPBC) the NCCN
protocols recommend a combination of chemotherapy, hormone and
targeted therapy.
Methods: The aim of our study was to investigate the regimens of adju-
vant therapy for TPBC that were prescribed to patients at our centre from
2012 to 2020. We selected patients with TPBC who received treatment at
our centre from 2012 to 2020 and did not receive neoadjuvant therapy.
Postoperative therapy (HT, TT and CT) appointments were monitored.
Results: The sample included 60 patients: pT1bN0 6.6%, pT1bN+
3.3%, pT1cN0 35%, pT1cN+ 13.3%, pT2N0 25%, pT2N+ 15%,
pT3N2 1.6%. Nobody received TT in the pT1b group, in the pT1c
group - 51.7%, in the pT2 group - 54.1%. HT in the pT1b group
received 66.6% of patients, pT1c group - 58.6%, pT2 group -
62.5%. Chemotherapy in the pT1b group received 50% of patients,
pT1c group - 65.5%, pT2 group - 66.6%. The pT3N2 patient received
a TT+CT. 36.6% of patients received a full combination of therapy,
30% - two types of therapy, 25% received one type of therapy, 1
patient didn't receive AT, 4 patients have no data.
Conclusion: Regardless of the pT category and the presence/absence of
metastases in the regional lymph nodes of the patient with TPBC in the
adjuvant mode, there are different treatment regimens. In only one third of
the cases the patients were prescribed a combination of chemotherapy,
hormone therapy, and targeted therapy. The presence of both hormonal
receptors and HER2 expression in such patients and possible cross-talk
between the signalling pathways of these receptors complicates the choice
of therapy in this group.

Yazici
*Izmir Katip Celebi University Ataturk Research and Training Hospital
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Fibroadenoma (FA) and phyllodes tumour
(PT) create diagnostic difficulties with core needle biopsies (CNB). The
aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of FA and PT diagnoses as
well as inter and intraobserver variability in CNBs.
Methods: Sixty-one patients were included in the study. Five breast
pathologists independently reviewed these in 3 rounds. Inter-observer κ
statistics were assessed and they were interpreted as follows: Kappa(K) ≤
0 as indicating no agreement and 0.01–0.20 as none to slight, 0.21–0.40
as fair, 0.41– 0.60 as moderate, 0.61–0.80 as substantial, and 0.81–1.00 as
almost perfect agreement.
Results: There was fair agreement between the pathologists with a κ
value of 0.21 in round 1, and 0.28 in round 3. But there was none to
slight agreement in round 2 (K =0.20). In the first round, the researchers
were given only the age of the patients, while in the second round no
information was given. The K values of stromal fragmentation, stromal
cellularity, mitosis and atypia which were evaluated in the 3rd round were
K = 0.73, 0.51, 0.47, and 0.40, respectively in the order of interobserver
agreement. While intraobserver agreement was fair (K= 0.37, 0.37, 0.31)
in 3 investigators, intraobserver agreement was moderate (K= 0.44,0.46)
in 2 investigators.
Conclusion: The intraobserver agreement of the diagnosis of FEL in
CNBs was found to be fair. To be able to diagnose FA and PT accurately
there are no definite criteria however when the age, the defined histolog-
ical criteria are given the agreement increases. The excisional biopsy is
still gold standard in the diagnosis of FA and PT.

MMP9 expression and extracellular matrix remodelling in aortic
diseases
B. Andrejic-Visnjic*, G. Samardzija, D. Tegeltija, B. Vukomanovic
Djurdjevic, M. Djolai
*University of Novi Sad, Serbia
Background & objectives: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) with
roles in both physiological and pathological processes, are specialized
for degrading various components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Its
synthesis and secretion may be affected by various endogenous or exog-
enous factors, including medications such as statins.
Methods: Aortic tissue of 40 patients with pathohistological diagnosis of
dissection, mild and severe atherosclerosis, aortitis, mucoid degeneration
and cystic medial necrosis was sampled. Tissue was stained with
hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemically for
MMP9. Epidemiological and clinically relevant data were obtained from
patients records.
Results: Majority of patients were 60-69 years old, predominantly males.
Most frequent diagnoses were atherosclerosis and dissection. MMP9 ex-
pression was noted rarely in mucoid degeneration and cystic medial ne-
crosis, while number of cells were increasing in cases of mild atheroscle-
rosis and aortitis, accompanied by mild to moderate ECM remodelling.
Virchows Arch
Most abundant immunopositivity for MMP9 was observed in inflamma-
tory cells in severe atherosclerosis and aortic dissection, followed by
intensive extracellular matrix remodelling. In cases of severe atheroscle-
rosis MMP9 expression was most prominent in macrophages in proxim-
ity of plaque. Application of statins in therapy, in most cases reduced
MMP9 expression in atherosclerosis.
Conclusion: MMP9 expression in aortic diseases is a major contributor
to ECM remodelling, while statins up to some point led to reduced
MMP9 expression.

Scanning electron microscopy in the diagnosis of complications of
coronary artery stenting
V. Ubaydullaeva, B. Magrupov*
*Center for the development of professional skills of medical staff,
Republican Research Center of Emergency Medicine, Uzbekistan
Background & objectives: Along with drug therapy and surgical
treatment of coronary artery disease (CHD), interventional cardi-
ology is actively being introduced into practice, where the most
effective way is stenting of the affected segments of the coronary
arteries.
Methods: A study of 45 stent coronary arteries (CA) with installed
stents was carried out at various times (from one day to 3 years)
in type 1 myocardial infarction (MI), using scanning electron mi-
croscopy (SEM).
Results: SEM helped to identify complications that developed during the
installation of stents, and made it possible to see the processes of throm-
bus formation, as well as the formation of neointima. Thus, in 26.6%,
type A dissection was observed, in 2% - CA perforation with the forma-
tion of pseudoaneurysm, in 8.2% - acute occlusion by a thrombus, in 4% -
stent deformation.
Conclusion: Serial scans made it possible to determine the nature of
the location of the stents in the affected areas of the coronary ves-
sels. The magnification of the image of the object under study by
several thousand times made it possible to objectively approach the
issues of the quality of manufactured stents, possible damage during
the installation of the latter into the lumen of coronary vessels, and
the processes of thrombus formation on stents without medicinal
coatings.

Podurovskaya, R. Serov, L.A. Bockeria
*National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynaecology and
Perinatology, Moscow, Russia
Background & objectives: The right ventricular (RV) myocardium
of children with Tetralogy of Fallot (TF) undergoes hemodynamic
overload immediately after birth, which results in significant mor-
phological changes. This study aimed to investigate the myocar-
dial morphology in children with TF and without cardiovascular
pathology.
Methods: RV myocardium of patients with TF (n=51, 3-33 months)
and without cardiovascular pathology (n=12, 1-36 months) were
studied. Masson-trichrome and H&E-staining were used to assess
the proportion of fibrosis and cardiomyocytes diameter.
Cardiomyocyte ploidy was counted on DAPI-stained cell suspen-
sion obtained from paraffin-embedded tissue. Tissue fragments
were also processed for electron microscopy. Significant correla-
tions were revealed using nonparametric statistics.
Results: In TF children myocardial fibrosis didn’t differ significantly
from the control (5,5±2,1% vs 5,8±3,2%), didn’t correlate with the age
and cardiomyocyte diameters, but correlated with myofibrils assembly in
cardiomyocytes. Fibrosis negatively correlated with low LVEF and O2
saturation. The cardiomyocyte diameter in TF children was significantly
larger than in control (10,5±2,1μm vs 5,7±0,9μm) and correlated with the
incidence of dyspnea-cyanotic attacks. The cardiomyocyte ploidy classes
2c:4c:8c:16c:32c in TF children was 22:49:24:4,5:0,5, in control -
71:2:6.2:0,8:0. In cardiomyocytes of TF children, ultrastructural signs
of incomplete differentiation were revealed: foci of myofibril assembly,
mitochondria, glycogen granules, centrioles in the sarcoplasm. The num-
ber of cardiomyocytes with areas without myofibrils decreased with age.
Conclusion: In RVOT myocardium of 1-2-year-old children with TF,
fibrosis corresponded to age control, but increased with hemodynamic
overload and hypoxemia. The diameter and ploidy of cardiomyocytes in
children with TF exceeded the age norm, and the number of tetra- and
octaploid cardiomyocytes was increased. Differentiation of
cardiomyocytes with the assembly of myofibrils and other ultrastructural
features was not only age-dependent but associated with hemodynamic
parameters of the severity of congenital heart disease.

Gender differences in changes in the structure of the media of the
ascending aorta in patients with its dilatation and/or dissection

Garmanov, V.A. Mironenko, R. Serov
*National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynaecology and
Perinatology, Moscow, Russia
Background & objectives: Dilation and/or dissection of ascending
aorta in women and men can be caused by various reasons, includ-
ing connective tissue dysplasia, and, accordingly, can have different
morphological manifestations, the study of which is the purpose of
this work.
Methods: Ascending aorta biopsies of 24 women (35-84 years) and
20 men (31-74 years) with aorta dilatation and/or dissection were
examined. The thickness of aortic media was measured, Masson-
trichrome, alcian blue and Weigert stain were used. The smooth
muscle cells presence, fibrosis, cystic media degeneration (CMD)
and elastic fibres were determined using a 4-point scale. The results
were processed statistically.
Results: The diameter of ascending aorta in women was 57±10mm, in men
53±6mm. Aortic media thickness in women (374-1597μm) and men (798-
1810μm) did not differ statistically. Aortic dissection was detected in 6/24
women and 4/20 men. In women aorta, CMD occurred significantly more
often than in men (13/24 vs 3/20), it correlated with an increase in the aorta
diameter. Smooth muscle cells loss and elastic fragmentation were identi-
fied. In men, aortic media petrification was revealed significantly more
often than in women, (11/20 vs 3/24), an increase in the ascending aorta
diameter correlated with elastic fragmentation. Aortic dissection in all pa-
tients was associated with smooth muscle cells loss, and media fibrosis.
Conclusion: The remodelling of the aorta with its borderline enlargement
in women and men was due to different changes in the aortic media
morphology, which were possibly hormone-dependent. In women,
changes in the structure of aortic media were characterized by more fre-
quent development of CMD and the accumulation of acidic glycosami-
noglycans, in men - with petrification of the aortic media. Aortic dissec-
tion in patients of both genders was due to focal necrosis, smooth muscle
cells loss, and media fibrosis.

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration
of intrapancreatic accessory spleen: a case series report and
review of the literature
P. Gil Bernabe*, G. Silvestre Egea, C. Gonzalez Lois, M.R. Sánchez
Yuste, J.L. Rodríguez Carrillo, M.d.C. Colomés Iess, J. Martín López
*Hospital Universitario, Spain
Background & objectives: Intrapancreatic accessory spleen is a benign
congenital anomaly that can pose a diagnostic challenge, both clinically
and in cytopathology. Clinical suspicion in the differential of a hypo-
echoic tail lesion should include this possibility but cytomorphologic
features allows for the diagnosis.
Methods: From two intrapancreatic accessory spleen (AS) diagnosed in
the last year in our department, we retrospectively review the literature
regarding the differential diagnosis of hypoechoic pancreatic tail lesions
and the main clinicopathological findings of AS. The clinical, endoscopic
and cytomorphologic features are described with the immunohistochem-
ical stains performed onto cell block material (CD3, CD20, CD8, CD56,
Synaptophysin).
Results: Two female patients, aged 61 and 67 years old, were diagnosed
of pancreatic AS in the last year. Both were evaluated by endoscopic
ultrasound fine needle aspiration cytology (EUS-FNA) with rapid on-
site evaluation (ROSE). The cytological smears revealed the presence
of a hematic background on which a lymphoid population with small cell
morphology predominated. Additionally, the presence of intermixed vas-
cular tracts and some groups of habitual pancreatic acinar morphology
were observed. Immunostaining of the cell block material confirmed the
described cytology consisting of B lymphoid aggregates (CD20+) togeth-
er with mature T lymphoid cells (CD3+) intermixed with vascular tracts
lined by endothelial cells of the splenic sinusoidal type (CD8+).
Conclusion: The diagnosis of pancreatic AS by EUS-FNA is infrequent
and the series describe a similar distribution based on sex and wide age
range presentation. They are usually small lesions (between 0.8 and up to 3
cm) of the pancreatic body or tail and the clinical differential diagnosis
include neuroendocrine or solid pseudopapillary neoplastic tumours. Some
cases show cystic changes and development of epidermoid cysts. Cytology
allows a specific diagnosis of the entity based on cytomorphological eval-
uation, avoiding unnecessary surgical interventions.

Investigation of HPV-positive ASC-US shows in every third case
squamous intraepithelial lesions – results of the German combined
screening
G. Richter*, N. Santos, D. Teschner, A. Katzenstein
*Institut für Pathologie Dr. med. Georg Richter, MIAC, Germany
Background & objectives: 2020 the combined screening with HPV test
and cytology for the early detection of cervical cancer was introduced in
Germany. With a cytology finding of atypical squamous cells and a posi-
tive HPV test a diagnostic colposcopy should be carried out.
Methods: In 2020 total of 62557 Pap smears were cytological examined
and HPV test was performed by using the HPV Aptima Test, which
discriminated HPV 16, HPV 18/45 and other types (16,18,31,
33,35,39,45,51,52,56,58,59,66,68). After diagnosis of atypical squamous
cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and positive HPV test col-
poscopy in a specialized centre within 3 months were recommended.
Results: In 2352 women (3,8 %) ASC-US were diagnosed and in 1017
cases a HPV positivity was found. In 110 Cases (11 %) HPV 16 were
detected, in 92 cases (9%) HPV 18/45 were detected and in 815 cases
(80%) “other types” were detected. In 383 cases a colposcopy were per-
formed and reported. In 272 cases (71 %) no essential lesion were
detected and in 68 cases (18%) a low grade intraepithelial lesion (SIL)
were diagnosed. In 43 cases (11%) a high grade SIL were diagnosed. No
invasive cancer were found.
Conclusion: In the first year of the combined German screening we detect-
ed 1017 (1,6%) women with HPV positivity and atypical squamous cells of
undetermined significance (ASC-US). After performing colposcopy 71 %
of these women were inconspicuous and in 29 % intraepithelial neoplasia
weredetected. In18%LSILandin11%HSIL werehistologicaldiagnosed.
No invasive cancer was found. These data seems to be an expression of the
importance of HPV positivity in ASC-US by detecting cervical lesions.

Utility of Ki-67, p53 and PTEN biomarkers in endometrial carcino-
ma by imprint cytology
D. Riga*, I. Vamvakaris, E. Psychogiou, K. Kosmas, V. Michelis
*Pathology Department, General Hospital Of Thoracic Diseases
“Sotiria”, Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: Worldwide, endometrial carcinoma is one of
the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women and a considerable
cause of death. Cytomorphology alone is not often sufficient to provide an
accurate diagnosis, thus immunocytochemistry is required for aim assist.
Methods: Endometrial samples freshly resected from 168 women who
underwent total abdominal hysterectomy were studied. The cytological diag-
nosis was confirmed by pathologists. Cytological imprint smears were ob-
tained by touching the cut surface of fresh cancer tissues. The specimens were
stained with Papanicolaou stain, Ki-67 (clone MIB-1, dilution 1:150), p53
(clone DO-7, dilution 1:50) and PTEN antibody (clone 6H2.1, dilution 1:80).
Results: Out of 168 cases, 123 were endometrioid and 45 non-
endometrioid carcinomas. The rate of positive expression of Ki-67
(85.5%) and p53 (82.4%) was high in type II tumours (P<0.001), in cases
of advanced and aggressive clinical stage and poor histologic differentiation
and in cases with myometrial infiltration depth >1/2 (P<0.001). Also, high
percentage of p53 (100%) positivity was found in all cases with positive
lymph node involvement. High rate of positive expression of PTEN was
observed in type I (43.4%) (P=0.910) and low-grade carcinomas (60.1%)
(P=0.03), in unaffected by the disease lymph nodes (P<0.001) as well as in
cases with myometrial infiltration depth <1/2 (P<0.001).
Conclusion: We believe that the use of Ki-67, p53 and PTEN antibodies
in addition to cytomorphologic features, appeared to be useful for the
diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma in endometrial cytology with imprint
smears and may help identify tumours with high malignant potential and
possible aggressive behaviour or ability to relapse offering valuable in-
formation, both in prognosis and treatment of patients with endometrial
carcinoma.

*Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided
transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) procedure is essential
to diagnose diseases with mediastinal involvement. Cancer in younger
patients comprises a distinct entity associated with poorer prognosis. This
study aimed to review clinicopathological data in young patients who
underwent EBUS-TBNA.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed EBUS-TBNA results over two
years (2019-2021) in patients aged under 55 years old. Rapid on-site
evaluation (ROSE) was performed in all cases. Cytopathologists selected
samples for ancillary studies. RT-PCR system (Therascreen/Idylla) was
Virchows Arch
used for EGFR, ALK and ROS1; after May 2020, Next Generation
Sequencing 52 gene-panel-based method was carried out (Oncomine
Focus Assay, Thermo Fisher Scientific l).
Results: We studied 60 patients (38M/22F) aged 30-54. Of total, 61.7%
showed negative for malignancy diagnosis; the reason for testing was a
suspected diagnosis of sarcoidosis in 12 cases. One bronchogenic cyst
was observed. In the remaining 23 cases (38.3%), 60.8% corresponded to
NSCLC (86.6% adenocarcinoma, 1 poorly differentiated carcinoma and
1 squamous carcinoma). Molecular testing on adenocarcinoma cases was
performed: 1 patient carrying EGFR deletion, another with BRAF muta-
tion and 2 more patients with KRAS mutation and ALK fusion, respec-
tively. 4.3% presented as small cell carcinoma and 8.7% as Hodgkin's
lymphoma. In addition, 1 NUT carcinoma, 3 metastases of renal cell
carcinoma and 2 of breast carcinoma were found.
Conclusion: EBUS-TBNA combined with ROSE has a high yield in the
diagnosis of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases with mediastinal
involvement. In younger patients, the former may present with nonspe-
cific symptoms and often have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis.
Molecular testing in lung cancer is mandatory, especially in young pa-
tients. Rare subtypes of lung carcinoma should be included in the differ-
ential diagnosis.

Young pathologist’s nightmare: unexpected dermatopathology cases
B. Calim Gurbuz*, C. Caytemel, O. Erdem
*Basaksehir Cam and Sakura City Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Dermatopathology encompasses a wide
group of neoplastic/non-neoplastic lesions. Accurate pathologic diagno-
sis may be difficult especially for young pathologists, as there are numer-
ous overlapping features. Our aim was to demonstrate some extraordinary
situations that we often encounter in daily routine.
Methods: Five patients with unexpected pathologic diagnosis were re-
trieved between May 2020 and March 2021. The gender, age,
site/characteristics of the lesions, preliminary diagnosis were collected
from clinical data. After the first histopathologic evaluation, connection
with the clinical diagnosis was established for all lesions. The second
biopsies were taken from three of the patients for confirmation.
Results: Three of the five patients were female and the age distribution was
between 6 and 64. The biopsy sites were lower extremity (three biopsies),
back(one biopsy), scalp(one biopsy). Two of the patients were children and
the preliminary diagnosis were traumatic panniculitis and vitiligo. The path-
ological diagnosisweregranuloma annulareandmycosisfungoides,respec-
tively.Whiletwoofthepatients’clinicaldiagnosiswerebasalcellcarcinoma
and necrobiosis lipoidica, the histomorphology was surprisingly compatible
with lichen planus in both biopsies. The preliminary diagnosis of the other
patientwassquamouscellcarcinoma.Thebiopsydemonstratedacantholytic
disease with suprabasal clefting. The results of blood tests and immunoflu-
orescence evaluation were also consistent with pemphigus vulgaris.
Conclusion: In the present case series, we evaluated the challenging spec-
trum of dermatopathology. Our cases suggested that the preliminary diag-
nosis is very important in skin lesions, but we should keep in mind the other
possibilities. Clinical appearance sometimes can have overlapping features,
and the experience of pathologist plays an important role in this situation.
Therefore, the combination of good clinicopathologic communication and
expert ideas is necessary in the management of challenging cases.

Background & objectives: Cutaneous metastases from a distant malig-
nancy are a diagnostic challenge for pathologists. Secondary tumour de-
posits in the skin represent advanced malignancy and the skin is an un-
common site of metastatic disease when compared to other organs (0.5-
2% through all malignancies).
Methods: The present study has analysed 41 cases of cutaneous metas-
tases from internal malignant neoplasms. Patient characteristics, tumour
localization, and clinical pre-diagnosis were evaluated.
Results: We evaluated 41 cutaneous metastases; the mean age of the
patients was 62. Nine cases (23%) presented as primary manifestations
of the tumour; biopsy evaluation in these cases suggested the possible
primary tumour site and triggered further evaluation. The most common
malignancy was breast carcinoma, and most common localization was
anterior chest wall through all patients as well as for female patients. The
most common malignancies were lung (n=5, 26%) and gastric carcino-
mas (n=5, 26%) for male patients, and the head and neck region was most
common localization. In our cohort, 32 patients were clinically suspected
of metastasis. However, 9 patients' clinical pre-diagnosis was primary
skin malignancies without metastasis suspicion.
Conclusion: The classic presentation of cutaneous metastases was a firm,
painless, flesh-coloured to an erythematous dermal nodule (or nodules).
There is usually a long-time lag between the diagnosis of the primary
malignancy and the recognition of the skin metastases. It is concluded that
cutaneous metastases occur rarely and the presentation of internal malig-
nancy with skin involvement is uncommon. Metastasis to the skin is often
a pre-terminal event that heralds poor outcomes.

Primary cutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma in Taiwan is more
often solitary and not ugly-looking
S. Chuang*, B. Chen, R.C. Wang, J. Jhuang
*Chi-Mei Medical Center, Taiwan
Background & objectives: Primary cutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lym-
phoma (PCGD-TCL) is a very rare and aggressive. Patients usually pres-
ent with multiple plaques, tumours, and/or subcutaneous nodules primar-
ily distributed over the extremities. We present the clinicopathological
findings of a small cohort of cases from Taiwan.
Methods: We investigated the clinicopathological features of PCGD-
TCL cases with chart review, extensive immunohistochemistry for phe-
notyping including T-cell receptor (TCR) βF1, TCR-γ, and TCR-δ, in
situ hybridization for EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER), treatment mo-
dality, and follow-up information.
Results: We identified six patients with a median age of 57. The
lesions presented in the head and neck regions (n=3) and extremities
(n=3). In five patients, the lesions were solitary, including two ul-
cerative. The tumour cells expressed CD3, CD8 (4/5), TIA-1 (5/6),
granzyme B (5/6), TCR-γ (3/3), and TCR-δ (4/6). In two cases, the
neoplastic cells expressed TCR-γ but not TCR-δ. Three cases par-
tially expressed βF1. All negative for EBER. Four cases were at
stage IE, and two at IIE. Excluding one recent case under chemo-
therapy, one died of lymphoma in 7 months, the remaining four
were in complete remission after radiotherapy, either alone or with
chemotherapy, in 6-126 months.
Conclusion: In this small series of cases from Taiwan, we found that five
of the six PCGD-TCL cases presented with a solitary lesion, clinically
mimicking lipoma or epidermal inclusion cyst in two cases. The clinical
presentation is distinct from the ugly-looking, frequently necrotic, multi-
ple tumorous lesions as reported in the literature. It is important to include
PCGD-TCL in the differential diagnosis of solitary cutaneous TCL and
perform extensive immunohistochemical study including cytotoxic
markers and TCR.

Pathological assessment of sentinel nodes in patients with cutaneous
melanoma in Russian cancer research centre
D. Chuglova*, V. Kushnarev, G. Zinovev, M. Ebert, A. Artemyeva
*N.N. Petrov National Medical Research Center of Oncology, Russia
Background & objectives: Evaluation of sentinel lymph node (SLN) is
crucial for cutaneous melanoma staging and treatment in patients with
clinically negative lymph nodes. We evaluated SLN of patients who
underwent SLN biopsy (SLNB) for skin melanoma between 2018 and
2021.
Methods: SLNB was performed in 303 patients, an average age of 53,7
years. Grossing of SLN depended on the size: those less than 5 mm were
taken entirely, 5-10 mm were bevalved and those larger than 10 mm were
grossed in bread loaf technique. After evaluation of the hematoxylin- and
eosin-stained sections (9 cut levels per block), immunohistochemistry
was performed.
Results: The stage distribution was following: pT1 - 65 (21,5%), pT2 - 98
(32,3%), pT3 - 74 (24,4%), pT4 - 58 (19,1%), in 6 cases stage was
unknown (pitfalls of primary tumour grossing). The average Breslow
index was 2,85 mm.
Metastasis was detected in 42 cases (13,7%), in 2 cases (4,8%) the ex-
cised tissue did not contain lymph nodes. Among all positive SLNs,
metastases up to 2 mm were detected in 11 cases (26,2%) by immuno-
histochemistry (S100, SOX10 or Tyrosinasa).
Conclusion: Pathological assessment of the sentinel lymph node for ma-
lignant melanoma is extremely important, but the process is unstandard-
ized yet.

Male patient with a primary apocrine sweat gland carcinoma of the
axilla: A case report of a rare entity
T.M. Costa*, D. Pinto
*Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Ocidental, Portugal
Background & objectives: Primary apocrine sweat gland carcinoma
(PASGC) is a rare neoplasm with only 51 cases reported in the literature.
It is often underrecognized, which can lead to undertreatment and enable
disease progression.
Methods: A 74-year-old man with a recent history of adenocarcino-
ma of the lung, in remission for the past 6 years, presenting at our
institution with a painless left axillary mass with 2cm, slowly grow-
ing for the past 3 years. On ultrasound examination, a diagnosis of
epidermal keratinocytic cyst was suggested, and the patient
remained on follow-up.
Results: As part of adenocarcinoma surveillance the patient was submit-
ted to PET-CT, which showed the axillary mass was avid and suspicious
for a metastatic neoplasm and was excised.
Macroscopic examination revealed a 2x2cm white nodule.
Histologically, the tumour was well-circumscribed but infiltrative and
centred in the dermis. Neoplastic cells showed an abundant, granular,
eosinophilic cytoplasm, and large nuclei with prominent nucleoli.
Immunohistochemically, they were positive for CK7, GCDFP-15, RA
and negative for RE, RP, CK20, TTF-1, CDX2, P40 and PAX-8.
Based on these findings, a diagnosis of apocrine carcinoma was made. A
full imagological workup of both breasts was performed, which found no
suspicious masses/nodules, enabling a final diagnosis of PASGC.
Conclusion: PASGC are indolent but malignant tumours, with frequent
local recurrence and lymph node metastasis. Due to their rarity, are often
clinically misdiagnosed, leading to delayed therapy. Furthermore, a dif-
ferential diagnosis with apocrine breast carcinoma cannot be made on
immunohistochemistry or morphology alone, requiring a full
imagological workup.
Surgical excision and lymph node dissection of clinically positive nodes
are considered the treatment of choice. Further reporting and literature
review are necessary to better understand the natural behaviour of this
disease.

The histopathological spectrum of inflammatory skin response to
tattoo pigment
D. Costache*, A.M. Vrâncianu, R. Șoană
*Pathology Department, Colentina University Clinical Hospital,
Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: With the rising popularity of skin tattoos, it is
expected that the rate of adverse reactions will rise. As newer inks are
utilized. This study will describe both the clinical and histopathologic
features of pathologic reactions to decorative tattoos.
Methods: There are six main categories of histopathologic reactions:
allergic hypersensitivity, granulomatous, interface, pseudolym-
phomatous, tumoral and infectious.
We present a series of six cases of tattooed skin biopsies from 3 male and
3 female patients with ages between 29-77 years old, with clinical diag-
noses of psoriasis/lichen planus, pseudolymphomatous reaction to tattoo,
acral melanoma/blue nevus, dermatofibroma/dermal nevus, eczema, for-
eign body granuloma.
Results: Microscopic examination revealed three cases of granulomatous
reaction(a foreign body granuloma with multinucleated giant cells and
two sarcoidal granulomas); a case of superficial perivascular lymphocytic
dermatitis; a case of dermatofibroma(with a dermal proliferation of fibro-
blasts and histiocytes, with storiform pattern) and a case of
pseudolymphomatous reaction.
Common skin reactions to tattoo include acute inflammatory reaction due
to the trauma caused by needles with/without superficial or deep local
infections, systemic infections, allergic contact dermatitis,
photodermatitis, granulomatous, lichenoid reactions and skin diseases
localized on the tattooed area (eczema, psoriasis, lichen, and morphea).
We also have to consider the possibility of the development of cutaneous
pseudolymphomatous reactions, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, or
even cutaneous neoplasms.
Conclusion: Knowing and understanding the histopathological spectrum
of skin reaction to tattoo pigment will increase clinical detection of situ-
ations requiring additional evaluation, whether it is for underlying infec-
tion, systemic involvement of disease, or to rule out a cutaneous malig-
nancy. In suspect cases, especially papulonodular lesions arising in
tattooed skin, early histopathologic diagnosis followed by excision of
the lesion is important.

Multinucleated cell angiohistiocytoma: a series of 15 cases
M.I. Craescu*, M. Frumosu, T. Tebeica
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Multinucleated cell angiohistiocytoma is a
rare benign tumour with subtle histopathological features, making it an
easy to miss diagnosis. The clinical appearance under the form of small
red papules often leads to it being confused with an inflammatory
disorder.
Methods: In this study, we reviewed a series of cases diagnosed over the
course of 5 years (2017-2021) in one Dermatopathology unit. We exam-
ined the HE sections and clinical photos of 15 cases, aiming to identify
common histopathological features that could aid in the diagnosis of this
proliferation.
Results: MCAH is characterised by a histiocytic proliferation with mul-
tinucleated cells and dilated small blood vessels. In our cases, the histio-
cytic proliferation was distinct with frequent angulated and wavy cells,
some with only a few scattered multinucleated cells present. There was a
perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, with half of our cases including fre-
quent mastocytes. Thickened collagen bundles, randomly distributed in
Virchows Arch
the upper dermis were also common. Less common histological features
were represented by the presence of neutrophils, sebaceous and basaloid
induction and also an exophytic, sessile architecture.
Clinically seven of our cases presented on the face and scalp, localisations
not frequently reported in literature for this tumour.
Conclusion: Multinucleated cell angiohistyocitoma is a proliferation that
does not have striking features and thus requires a more thorough exam-
ination. Most of the cases we examined were clinically suspected of being
inflammatory disorders, such as lupus erythematosus, lichen planus, sar-
coidosis or even lymphoproliferative disorders. For these reasons, we find
that this is an important diagnostic to be aware of.

Cutaneous metastases: a series of 74 cases
M.I. Craescu*, A.C. Lisievici, M. Frumosu, M. Leventer, G. Dodan, T.
Tebeica
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Metastasis is the final stage in the evolution
of malignant tumours and represents the main cause of cancer morbidity
and mortality. Accurate histopathological diagnosis is urgent and essen-
tial for proper treatment.
Methods: This is a retrospective study including 74 cases diagnosed in
our Pathology Department over a period of seven years (2015-2021). We
thoroughly reviewed the HE slides, immunohistochemistry slides and the
clinical information from the virtual database. Our aim was to observe
histopathological features and make clinical correlations.
Results: Most cutaneous metastases were those of malignant melanomas
(42%), followed by breast carcinoma (30%). The latter cases explain why
most of the cutaneous metastases were diagnosed in women (68%).
Histopathologically, most of the cases did not present with ulceration
(16%), epidermotropism (12%) or lympho-vascular invasion (19%).
The typical clinical presentation was that of a nodule, with few cases of
pigmented patches and dermatitis-like lesions.
The median age was 61 years, with one case of a 24-year-old without a
prior history of melanoma.
Most of the cases presented on the trunk (44%), followed by head and
neck (27%), extremities (14%), abdomen (11%), pelvis (4%).
Conclusion: Cutaneous metastases can be an important diagnosis to con-
sider even in cases without clinical suggestion ( one third of our cases) or
without former history of neoplasms (one fourth of our patients).
Although most metastases retain the histopathological features of the
primary tumours, some can have a deceivingly bland appearance.
Metastases of lobular breast carcinoma can mimic inflammatory disorders
such as granuloma annulare, morphea or lupus.

A breast lesion on the nape?
M. Feltri*, A. Bonometti, S. Fraticelli, M. Lucioni
*Anatomic Pathology Unit, Department of Molecular Medicine,
University of Pavia and Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico S. Matteo,
Pavia, Italy
Background & objectives: Endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland
carcinoma (EMPSG) is a rare lesion, often underrecognized, mostly
found in old women eyelid with heterogeneous growth pattern and con-
sidered the cutaneous analogue of solid papillary carcinoma of the breast.
Methods: We describe a case of a 75-years old woman complaining an
asymptomatic skin coloured slightly raised lesion on the nape that
underwent excisional biopsy. Gross examination revealed, in the dermis
a seemingly cystic lesion of 0,6 cm of diameter. Specimen was processed
according to routine procedure.
Results: Histological examination revealed, under a unremarkable epi-
dermis, a cystic nodule composed of medium sized cells with round
nuclei, sometimes prominent nucleoli, a discrete clear/eosinophilic cyto-
plasm and finely dispersed chromatin, organized in a predominant crib-
riform pattern and characterized by following immunohistochemical pro-
file: EMA+, BerEp4+, CK7+/-, GCDFP15-/+, WT1-/+, CK20-, TTF1-,
CEA-, Mammoglobin-, c-ErbB2-, positivity for oestrogen, progesterone
receptors, and variable positivity for chromogranin, synaptophysin and
androgen receptors. Moreover, PAS-Alcian stain revealed focal extracel-
lular mucin deposits. Proliferation index assessed with Ki67 antibody,
was low, about 5-10%. Provided the necessity to clinically exclude a
metastasis, a diagnosis of Endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carci-
noma was made.
Conclusion: Only 22 EMPSG are described in literature, 50% initially
misdiagnosed. Rare publications hypothesized the sequence carcinoma in
situ-invasive carcinoma-mucinous carcinoma and parallelism with breast
solid papillary carcinoma in situ-invasive solid papillary carcinoma-
mucinous carcinoma, based on phenotypical and immunohistochemical
similarities. Its outcome is favourable, with possible cutaneous recur-
rences and, because of its rarity, the molecular profile has not been studied
yet. Therefore, investigating its molecular and chromosome abnormali-
ties, could confirm breast-analogy and improve understanding the patho-
genesis of both lesions.

Cutaneous metastasis: a study of 58 cases diagnosed in our pathology
unit
M. Frumosu*, L. Sticlaru, A. Dragusin, M.I. Craescu, A. Dinculescu,
M.D. Petre
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Cutaneous metastasis can arise in a variety of
cancers, not infrequently being the first sign of malignancy. Patients most
commonly present with flesh-coloured nodules or plaque and only a part
of them are suspected of metastasis.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 58cases
diagnosed with cutaneous metastasis in our service during a twelve-
years period(2009-2020). Our objective was to collect data and establish
clinico-pathological correlations regarding cutaneous metastases diag-
nosed at Colentina-University-Hospital. We collected information from
our database(sex, age, clinical presentation, suggestion of metastasis,
presence of malignancy in the past) and methodically re-examined hema-
toxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry slides.
Results: The age distribution was 34-89 years(mean 65), the majority of
the patients were females(55,17%), 67,92% had clinical history of malig-
nancy, only 18,87% of cases were sent as cutaneous metastasis.76,36% of
cases were clinically described as single nodules, 9,43% as carcinoma
erysipeloides and 3,76% as alopecia neoplastica. Trunk was frequently
involved(23 cases), followed by head and neck(9 cases) and extremities(8
cases). Breast carcinoma(43,4%) and melanoma(22,64%) were the most
common tumours to present with cutaneous metastasis, followed by
gastro-intestinal carcinomas(20,75%) and prostatic adenocarcino-
ma(7,55%). The vast majority of the tumours weren't ulcerated and didn't
present necrosis(84,91%).81,13% tumours were associated with a signif-
icant reactive inflammatory process, 32,08% presented vascular invasion
and 11,32% perineural invasion.
Conclusion: In our study, most cases consisted of single nodules on the
trunk at patients who already had a diagnosis of a malignancy, the most
frequent being breast carcinoma and melanoma, as expected, accuracy of
the clinical diagnostic increased when dealing with patients with known
malignancies. It's important to further maintain a high level of suspicion
when dealing with patients who already had been diagnosed with a form
of malignancy in the past.

*Istanbul Medeniyet University Prof. Dr. Suleyman Yalcin City Hospital
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: With the increase of the coronavirus disease,
more extensive data has shared about the dermatological findings of the
disease. We aimed to describe histological features of cutaneous erup-
tions of the Covid 19 patients in our hospital.
Methods: We evaluated all skin biopsies which performed in hospital-
ized Covid-19 infected patients presenting concomitant cutaneous mani-
festations since March 2020. We reviewed 3 male and 2 female patients
with a mean age of 24 years (range from 3-52). All patients had a naso-
pharyngeal swab positive for Covid-19 before the occurrence of rash.
Results: Clinically, all five patients presented maculopapular rash of the
trunk and extremities. The latency between rash and onset of
extracutaneous Covid-19 symptoms ranged from 3 to 30 days.
Histologically, patients showed spongiotic dermatitis, basal vacuolar de-
generation, red blood cell extravasations, endothelial hyperplasia,
perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, scarce neutrophils and eosinophils
in a variable degree. Fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel walls was not found.
Histopathological features of cutaneous manifestations reported in our
study were unspecific.
Conclusion: Spongiosis and perivascular inflammatory infiltrate can be
observed in various eruptions such as viral rash and drug reaction.
Histopathological features of these two types of eruptions can also over-
lapping. Therefore, further studies are needed to clarify the relationship
between cutaneous rash and Covid-19 virus.

Study of the use of imiquimod for psoriasis model formation
M. Kostyaeva, A. Kosyreva, I. Kastyro*
*Peoples’ Friendship University of Russia, Russia
Background & objectives: In connection with a significant decrease in
the quality of life of patients suffering from psoriasis, it became necessary
to study the formation of a psoriasis model to study the possibilities of
therapy choosing.
Aims: to develop psoriasoform skin lesions in rats.
Methods: 20 female Wistar rats were used. A psoriasis model was
formed by applying a 10% solution of imiquimod to the back for 10
minutes once a day. 5 rats made up the control group (1gr). In 2nd group
the solution of imichimod was used for 1day, in 3rd group-3days, in 4th
group-5days. Histological preparations were stained with
hematoxylin&eosin.
Results: In 2gr, 2 animals showed an increase in cellularity in the dermis,
mild hyperaemia in the papillary layer of the dermis, and no
pathomorphological changes were found on the side of the epidermis.
In 3gr, the following changes in the epidermis were revealed in 3animals:
in one case-acanthosis, in two animals-a scab with the formation of
intraepidermal polymorphic cell proliferation. 4 animals in the dermis
had polymorphic cell infiltrates, diapedesic haemorrhages, oedema and
hyperaemia. In 4gr, 4 rats showed changes in the epidermis and in the
dermis. Acanthosis, spongiosis, and the formation of epidermal pustules
with exudate containing inflammatory cells were observed. In 2cases in
4gr,epidermal exfoliation, erosions, pustules & plaques was revealed.
Conclusion: The application of a 10% solution of imiquimod induces
changes in rats similar to those in the dermis and epidermis in human
psoriasis. Thus, changes in the skin after using a 10% solution of
imiquimod in rats can serve as a model for psoriasis.

The impact of hyaluronic acid and trehalosa on histological param-
eters of the skin
E. Kazachkov*, T. Zayats, G. Sychugov, Y. Kudrevich, O. Ziganshin
*South Ural State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: To study the morphological effects of the
skin biorevitalization to improve its quality and rejuvenation before and
after exposure.
Methods: The study involved 20 women aged 51. Biorevitalization was
carried out by using a single injection of hyaluronic acid and trehalose
under local anaesthesia. The skin was taken by punch biopsy before and 6
weeks after face injection. Slides were stained with hematoxylin and
eosin and Masson's trichrome.
Results: The average thickness of the epidermis was 70.21±3.38 μm
before the procedure and 85.13±7.01 μm after 6 weeks (p=0.05). The
average thickness of the papillary and reticular layer of the dermis was
97.62±7.98 μm and 667.88±48.16 μm before the procedure, respectively.
After the procedure, thickness decreased by 30% (p<0.05) and amounted
to 68,95±5.03 μm and 468.67±43.53 μm. Decreased dermis thickness
occurred due to decreased tissue oedema. In Masson's stained samples,
the bulk density of collagen fibres was 65.6±7.0% before the procedure
and increased to 74.4±5.8% after the procedure (p<0.01).
Conclusion: Hyaluronic acid and trehalose injections show significant
changes that include epidermis thickening, induration of the dermis, and
decreased tissue oedema.

H Syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis, a case
presentation
A. Al-Jawad, F. Al-Jaralla, H. Al-Hamami, F. Kubba*
*Ealing Hospital, London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust,
Middlesex, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: This is a rare autosomal recessive
genodermatosis with possible severe multisystem involvement. Its major
cutaneous signs are hyperpigmentation, induration, and hypertrichosis.
The cutaneous manifestations are very important as they are a pathogno-
monic clue for the diagnosis of this multisystemic syndrome.
Methods: A 13-year-old child presented with asymptomatic brown
patches and hypertrichosis over his legs, inner thighs and the back,
which appeared during infancy, associated with hearing loss since
birth. He was diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus at
the age of 7.
There was parental consanguinity and history of death of his sister from a
cardiac problem and similar skin findings.
Results: On examination, the child was short for his age. He had indu-
rated and hyperpigmented patches over the thighs, legs and the lower
back with hypertrichosis and enlarged ambiguous genitalia. No hallux
valgus was noted.
Abdominal examination revealed splenomegaly, but no hepatomegaly or
lymphadenopathy was present.
Abdominal ultrasonography confirmed splenomegaly and echocardiog-
raphy showed a pericardial mass.
Genetic study was not performed as it was not available to confirm the
SLC29A3 gene on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q22).
Histopathological examination of the involved skin showed mild
acanthosis, increased melanin deposition in the basal keratinocytes, and
nonspecific perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the superficial and mid
dermis with mild dermal fibrosis.
Conclusion: We presented a case of H syndrome, a rare autosomal re-
cessive genodermatosis.
Our diagnosis was based on the clinical and family history, clinical ex-
amination and investigations including a skin punch biopsy, and the pa-
tient was referred for the paediatrics department for further management
and follow up.
It is important to recognize this syndrome which presents with a wide
clinical variability and not to miss the characteristic skin findings which in
most cases are good clues to the diagnosis.

Lichenplanopilaris and telogen effluvium associated with severe
dysaethesia and a lipedematous scalp, a case report of alopecia with
multiple aetiological factors
F. Kubba*, A. Anton, M. Shetty, P. Dassan, F. Teixeira
*Ealing Hospital, London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust,
Middlesex, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: A 47-year-old female who presented with a
two-month history of diffuse scalp swelling which started after otitis
media, associated with constant pain radiating to the face. Later she de-
veloped two patches of hair thinning in the vertex and occiput.
Methods: Clinical examination revealed a boggy and extremely tender
scalp without erythema. There was reduced pin prick over V1 and V2
nerves. Other cranial nerves were normal on examination. CT scan and
MRI of the head revealed thickened scalp fat up to 13.7mm.
Vitamin D, iron, zinc and thyroid levels were normal. Antinuclear
antibodies(ANA) were borderline elevated. She had no anaemia.
Results: On microscopy, horizontal sections of the 4mm punch biopsy of
the thinned vertex hair patch showed mild folliculocentric lymphocytic
infiltrate with mild lamellar perifollicular fibrosis at the infundibulum, in
keeping with lichen planopilaris (scarring alopecia), supported by the
borderline elevated ANA levels.
Horizontal sections of the occipital hair loss patch biopsy showed seven
telogen hair follicles without fibrosis or inflammation, supportive of
telogen effluvium (nonscarring alopecia).
She was treated with gabapentin 400mg tablets TDS, greater occipital
nerve block to control pain and topical betamethasone for alopecia.
One case of lichen planopilaris with androgenetic alopecia has been re-
ported but such triple aetiology combination with lipedematous alopecia
has not been described before.
Conclusion: We report a case of scarring alopecia; lichen planopilaris,
associated with a nonscarring alopecia; telogen effulvium, in a back-
ground of severe hyperasthesia and lipedematous scalp, requiring
gabapentin and nerve block to control the severe pain.
Hair loss due to multiple aetiological factors is reported, but not in a
similar setting.
It is possible that severe occipital neuralgia together with the
lipedematous scalp may have resulted in nonscarring alopecia.
A good clinicopathological correlation when reporting similar cases is
very essential.

Fotiadou, S. Chatzopoulos, Z. Apalla, P. Hytiroglou
*2nd Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Aristotle University
of Thessaloniki, Greece
Background & objectives: The expression of type 1 interferon-related
proteins in alopecia areata (AA) lesions has been demonstrated and since
plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are premium producers of type I IFN
their presence in acute, intermediate and chronic AA lesions was
investigated.
Methods: Forty biopsy specimens, from a corresponding number of pa-
tients with AA lesions, were collected Twelve (30%) of them were cate-
gorized into acute, eleven (27.5%) into intermediate and 17 (42.5%) into
chronic stage of the disease, according to the duration of the lesions.
Immunohistochemical analysis with CD4, CD8, FOXP3 and CD123 an-
tibodies was performed in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
sections.
Results: The lymphocytic infiltration was perifollicular, and in 37.5% of
the cases an intrafollicular distribution was identified, as well.
Heterogeneity in lymphocytic density and distribution was present among
hair follicles of the same specimen. CD123+ cells were identified in
33.3% of the cases in a perifollicular distribution. Their presence was
associated with the chronologically determined stages of the disease
(p=0.022) more often observed in the intermediate stage of AA, followed
by the acute stage. Furthermore, an association of CD123+ cells and
FOXP3+ cells in the immune infiltrate surrounding the hair follicle was
found (p=0.013). No statistically significant association between
CD123+ cells and CD4+ or CD8+ cells or their ratio was found.
Conclusion: This study suggests a role of pDCs in the pathogenesis of
AA and a possible contribution in the initiation and in the early stages of
the disease, but not in maintaining the chronic process. Coexistence and
association of regulatory T cells and pDCs in a subset of AA lesions may
reflect the biology of an impaired immune microenvironment.

Audit of melanoma sentinel lymph node protocol pre- and post- up-
dated EORTC protocol at a tertiary centre
S.H. Lee*, S. Edwards
*The Royal Marsden Hospital, London, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: The sentinel lymph node is an important
prognostic marker in melanoma but approaches to pathological handling
are varied. This study compares the positive detection rate and workload
between the previous local protocol at Ninewells Hospital and updated
EORTC protocol.
Methods: The records of 58 consecutive patients with primary cutaneous
melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy at
Ninewells Hospital and Medical School in East Scotland between 01/
09/2017-01/11/2020 were reviewed. A positive detection rate of metas-
tasis in SLN biopsy and the number of slides generated per case were
compared between the previous local protocol and the updated EORTC
protocol.
Results: SLN protocol was performed on a total of 108 sentinel lymph
nodes (previous protocol n=45, new protocol n=63). With use of the
previous local protocol, 8.89% of sentinel lymph nodes (4/45) demon-
strated metastatic melanoma deposit. With implementation of the updated
EORTC protocol, 12.69% of sentinel lymph nodes (8/63) showed meta-
static deposit. The new protocol is associated with a higher detection rate
(+3.81%) but this was not significant (Chi squared p=0.53). However, the
average number of slides generated in the old protocol was 38 slides per
lymph node but just 11 slides per lymph node on the new protocol (p=
<0.001, Welch’s t-test).
Conclusion: The new EORTC protocol is proven to be non-inferior in
detection of positive nodes but generates significantly fewer slides than
the previous local protocol. The findings add evidence to support the use
of the updated EORTC protocol for evaluating SLN. Studies with greater
power would clarify whether the new protocol also has increased sensi-
tivity to nodal disease.

*Department of Pathology, Emergency Clinical County Hospital
Timisoara, Romania
Background & objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
clinical and histological features of the primary cutaneous melanomas
associated with sentinel lymph node metastases.
Methods: From the database of our pathology department, we selected
the cases diagnosed as primary cutaneous melanomas, followed by sen-
tinel lymph nodes excision from 2018 to 2020. We evaluated 26 cases
with positive sentinel lymph nodes and 31 cases with negative sentinel
lymph nodes.
Virchows Arch
Results: The first group included 14 females and 12 males (median age:
63,1 years). For the second group (20 females and 11 males), the median
age was 55 years (p=0.0162). In the group with positive sentinel lymph
nodes we noticed more often the nodular subtype (50%; p=0.0145), a
Breslow index >4 mm (69,2%; p<0.001), ≥5 mitosis/mm2 (65,4%;
p=0.0126), ulceration (77%; p=0.0275), lymphovascular invasion
(19,2%; p=0.0106), satelites (27%; p=0.0103) and pT4 stage (69%;
p<0.001). In the second group: superficial spreading type, vertical growth
phase (67.7%), Breslow index >4 mm (13%), ≥5 mitosis/mm2 (32,3%),
ulceration (48,5%), satelites (only 3,2%), early stages (61,2%),
lymphovascular invasion absent. In both groups, the Clark level IV
predominated.
Conclusion: In our study, the most important factors that can predict
metastases in sentinel lymph nodes are the Breslow index and the path-
ological stage. The clinicopathological characteristics that affect the out-
come of the patients are an advanced age at diagnosis, satelitosis,
lymphovascular invasion, mitotic rate, the nodular subtype, and
ulceration.

*Pathology Clinical Service of Constanta "St. Andrew" Clinical
Emergency County Constanta, Romania
Background & objectives: Anti-programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1)
therapy markedly improves prognosis in patients with the most aggres-
sive tumours - melanomas. Our study is ongoing to better understand the
role of PD-L1 as an immune-oncology marker, in combination with other
prognostic features.
Methods: Retrospective evaluation of 31 cases of melanoma performed
at our hospital in Constanta between 2018 to 2019. Data retrieved includ-
ed clinical history and histological features such as Breslow tumour thick-
ness, Clark level of invasion, greater dimension, pTNM stage, inflamma-
tory infiltrate, lymphovascular and perineural invasion, number of mito-
ses. Histological and immunohistochemical studies (PD-L1 and CD8 )
were followed by statistical analysis.
Results: Of 31 cases, 57% were females, 43% were males, with anatom-
ical sites such as posterior thorax 40%, followed by head and neck 23% of
cases and less frequent in other sites. Between the four histologic types of
melanoma encountered in our study we established some statistically
significant differences of PD-L1 expression specially between invasive
superficial spreading melanoma with vertical growth nodule/nodular mel-
anoma and acral melanoma /in situ melanoma. The Breslow tumour
thickness is the only reliable and recognized prognostic feature in mela-
noma, showing in this study a general negative correlation with the PD-
L1 expression, with a rising percentage of negative expression cases in
melanomas with higher values of Breslow.
Conclusion: An integrated analysis of both PD-L1, CD8 and TIL’s are be
useful elements for predicting prognosis in patients with melanoma. Our
findings suggest that there is a high variation of PD-L1 expression in
melanoma, depending on the morphology, but further studies are needed
in a larger cohort of melanoma patients, in order to validate a predictive
value of the immunohistochemical PD-L1 expression.

The intricate aspects of diagnosing a nevoid malignant
micromelanoma: a case report
D. Nicolcea*, D. Szilagyi, L.M. Marghidanu
*Department of Pathology, Emergency County Hospital "Pius Brinzeu",
Timisoara, Romania
Background & objectives: Micromelanomas, having a diameter under 5
mm, are a new topic of interest in dermatopathology, raising awareness
around early detection of this potentially fatal cancer. A nevoid
micromelanoma poses a triple threat, considering its benign-looking fea-
tures, rarity and small size.
Methods: This study reports a 34-year old Caucasian female, who
presented to the hospital with multiple cutaneous lesions, four on her
right upper arm and two on her right lower leg. Examination reveals
the lesions were varying in size (from 4 mm to 7 mm) and macro-
scopic appearance (some nodular, some polypoid and one white
plaque, with a grey halo).
Results: On histopathological examination, the results were as follows:
three of the lesions were compound nevi, two were intradermal nevi, one
of which was associated with a basal cell carcinoma with multiple risk
factors, and the white, 4 mm, plaque was diagnosed as MELTUMP. A
second opinion was requested and the lesion was ruled out as a nevoid
malignant melanoma (Breslow index 0.8 mm, pT1b). To support the
diagnosis, immunohistochemical analysis was performed, which showed
melanocytic proliferation positive for S100 and MelanA, mitoses present,
diffuse positivity for HMB45, indicating absence of cell maturation, Ki67
proliferating index of 5%, CD 45 positivity for chronic inflammation and
CD 34 not supporting vascular invasion.
Conclusion: This particular case emphasizes the attention that should be
given to benign-appearing nevi, especially those under 5 mm, in view of
the fact that micromelanomas can be easily disregarded as benign, be-
cause of their low advancement in evolution and small size. In order to
achieve early diagnosis of skin neoplasms, the entire arsenal at the pa-
thologist's disposal should be used, as it can help improve the patient's
diagnosis and prognosis.

Clinical and histopathological features of nodular melanoma: a ret-
rospective study from a Romanian tertiary centre
A.M. Pop*, A.C. Tinca, O.S. Cotoi
*George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, and
Technology of Târgu Mureș, Romania
Background & objectives: Nodular melanoma (NM) is the most inva-
sive melanoma subtype, often diagnosed in advanced stages, which
causes a consistent proportion of deaths related to melanoma. This study
aimed to identify the clinicopathologic features of NM diagnosed in a
Romanian tertiary centre.
Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on all cases of NM diag-
nosed between 2017-2020 in the Department of Pathology of the Mureș
County Clinical Hospital. The following variables were recorded: demo-
graphic data, tumour localization, Breslow thickness, Clark level of inva-
sion, mitotic rate, presence of ulceration, tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs) and regression.
Results: The study group included 34 patients with NM (18 females and
16 males), with a mean age of 65.9±17.2 years. The most frequent tumour
site was the trunk (47.1%), followed by the limbs (35.3%). Most of the
tumours had a Breslow thickness >4.0 mm (55.9%) and a Clark level of
IV (64.7%). The mean mitotic rate was 7.2±5.1 mitoses/mm2 (range 1-
22) and there was a significant positive moderate correlation between
mitotic rate and Breslow thickness, with Spearman correlation coefficient
r=0.43 (0.098-0.677), p=0.01. Ulceration was present in 25 cases
(73.5%). Most tumours presented brisk TILs (41.2%). Regression was
observed in 2 cases (5.9%) and one NM was associated with nevus
(2.9%).
Conclusion: The aggressive phenotype of NM is confirmed by the high
Breslow thickness, frequent ulceration, increased mitotic rate and low
association with regression and nevus remnants. Therefore, NM should
Virchows Arch
be regarded as a de novo malignancy with high metastatic potential and
delayed diagnosis.

Immunohistochemical expression of matrix-metallo-proteinases in
melanocytic nevi with intravascular protrusions and intravascular
nevus cell aggregates compared to common melanocytic nevi
O. Stefan*, G. Tudor, M. Cioplea, A. Cioroianu, C. Caruntu, D. Boda, L.
Cristina, A. Toma, A. Savin, S.A. Zurac
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Matrix-metallo-proteinases play a significant
role in the progression of melanocytic lesions. The aim of this study is to
evaluate MMP expression in common melanocytic nevi (CMN) with
intravascular protrusions (IVNP) and intravascular nevus cell aggregates
(IVNcA).
Methods: We performed a case control study including 30 CMN with
IVNP and IVNcA and 30 paired CMN without IVNP and IVNcA and
stained them for MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-11 and MMP-13. Two
investigators utilizing a modified Sinicrope's method scored the uptake of
immunostains. Data was analysed using a paired Student's t test. The level
of significance was set at p<0.05.
Results: We found that MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-11 were
overexpressed in melanocytic nevi with IVNP and IVNcA compared to
CMN (p = 0.004, 0.004 and 0.002, respectively). Interestingly, MMP-9
was overexpressed in common melanocytic nevi without intravascular
protrusions and aggregates (p = 0.002). There was no statistically signif-
icant difference in the expression of MMP-13 in both study groups (p =
0.2691).
Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the majority of the analysed
MMPs are differentially expressed in melanocytic nevi with intravascular
protrusions and aggregates compared to CMN. This suggests that MMP-
2, MMP-3 and MMP-11 play an important role in the pathogenesis of
benign melanocytic lymph node deposits.

*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: We evaluated TIMPs expression as players
in tumour progression in common melanocytic nevi (CMN) versus CMN
with intravascular protrusions (IVNP) and intravascular nevus cell aggre-
gates (IVNcA).
Methods: Our study (case control type) includes 60 cases of CMN, half
of them with IVNP and IVNcA; TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 expres-
sions were investigated. All cases were seen by two investigators; a mod-
ified Sinicrope's score was used. Data was analysed using a paired
Student's t test for a level of significance of p<0.05.
Results: TIMP-1 was overexpressed in CMN nevi without IVPN and
IVNcA (p = 0.002). TIMP-3 has a tendency towards overexpression in
CMN with IVNP and IVNcA (p = 0.0106). No statistically significant
difference in the expression of TIMP-2 in both study groups (p = 0.8249)
was present.
Conclusion: TIMP-3 is overexpressed in CMN with IVNP and IVNcA
compared with CMN without IVNP and IVNcA, TIMP-1 has the oppo-
site manifestation while TIMP-2 has no significant variation; the impor-
tance of this differences in the expression of TIMPs in the pathogenesis of
vascular affinity of melanocytes needs further research.

Neto, T. Johnston Leitão, E. Sérgio da Silva
*Unisalesiano, Brazil
Background & objectives: Leishmaniasis presents itself from small skin
lesions to visceral disorders that can evolve to death. To evaluate the
association of histopathological criteria with the results of polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) of clinically suspected cases of cutaneous leishman-
iasis (CL).
Methods: An observational, cross-sectional, and retrospective study that
evaluated, by PCR and histological examination, skin samples received
during 9 years of clinically suspected cases of CL.
Results: The data showed full agreement between histopathological results
and PCR when amastigote structures were identified. Moreover, the eval-
uated histological variables did not show statistical significance with the
result of the PCR when considered individually: ulceration (P = 0.231),
epidermal hyperplasia (P = 0.595), hyperkeratosis (P = 0.103), presence of
granuloma (P = 0.280), neutrophils (P = 0.475), histiocytes (P = 0.241),
lymphocytes (0.543), plasmocytes (0.291), and necrosis (0.746).
Conclusion: The data from the present study highlight the high specific-
ity of microscopy analysis with 100% agreement with the PCR result for
clinically suspected cases in an endemic Brazilian region. However, a
histopathological finding in isolation cannot predict PCR positive results.

Background & objectives: Mast cell participate in inflammatory bowel
disease pathogenesis by releasing various inflammatory mediators.
Dextran sulphate sodium induced colitis in laboratory animals is com-
monly used IBD model. The aim of the study is mast cells quantification
in chronic mouse/rat DSS model.
Methods: Animals were exposed to DSS in drinking water in three cycles
of five-day duration. FFPE tissue sections were toluidine blue and PAS
stained. Disease activity was evaluated using score (Int Pharmacol (2009)
9:1444). Mast cell number and percentage of degranulated mast cells was
evaluated by digital image analysis (Calopix software, TRIBVN, France).
Statistical evaluation was performed using GraphPadPrism software.
Results: Disease activity score was significantly higher in DSS groups of
mice and rats in comparison to negative control groups.
In murine naïve and DSS-treated mice colon toluidine-stained mast cells
were present in peri-intestinal fat tissue, mainly situated near vessels. In
DSS-treatedanimals, numberofmast cellsslightlyincreased, while percent-
ageofdegranulatedmastcellswasnotstatisticallyhigherthaninnaïvemice.
In rat naïve colon toluidine-stained mast cells were found in submucosa
and peri-intestinal fat tissue. In distal colon of naïve rats most mast cells

were degranulated. Percentage of degranulated mast cells in proximal
colon submucosa significantly increased in DSS group compared to
naïve animals.
Conclusion: In this study differences in mast cell number, distribution
and degranulation status in naïve colon and DSS-colitis between mice and
rats were highlighted. Also, most of the mast cells in naïve and DSS-
colitis groups were degranulated (activated) in distal colon part.

Background & objectives: The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-
19) is an ongoing pandemic, generating an unprecedented health crisis,
especially among patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). To better man-
age the evolving crisis, a state of emergency was declared in Romania on
March 16, 2020.
Methods: The state of emergency had profound effects on oncology
patients, particularly for CRC patients. Briefly, this study evaluated the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on CRC patients in the largest hos-
pital in western Romania. We performed a cross-sectional analysis on
colorectal (CR) resection specimens received in our pathology depart-
ment between March 16, 2018 and March 16, 2021.
Results: In 3 years of study data, 1035 CR resection specimens were
examined: 733 were CR adenocarcinomas, 14 malignant CR tumours
other than adenocarcinomas, 46 tumour recurrences, 28 specimens with
direct invasion/metastases from other cancer and 214 were benign or non-
neoplastic specimens. Only CR adenocarcinomas were selected,
analysing the distribution and clinico-morphological features over 3 time
periods: March 16, 2018-15 March 2019, March 16, 2019-15
March 2020 and March 16, 2020-16 March 2021. A slight decrease in
the number of specimens was noted in the last year of the pandemic
compared to previous years with two exceptions: March 2020, before
the announced lockdown and June 2020, after the lockdown ended.
Conclusion: A difference was noted regarding the surgical treatment
when between 2018-2020 elective surgeries were more frequent, while
between 2020-2021 emergency interventions were more frequent.
Finally, regarding CRC and COVID-19 pathological overlap, 6 patients
had COVID-19 before hospitalization, 2 were infected at the time of
surgery and 7 presented nosocomial infection. No specific histological
findings were identified.
In conclusion, the impact of COVID-19 on the management of CRC
patients was noticed in our hospital, but the overall impact was minor.

Secondary appendiceal tumours: clinico-pathological spectrum of 20
cases in a 30-year single centre retrospective study
C. Cerezo*, Y. Rodriguez, M. Bronte, C. Fuertes, G. Aisa, M.C. Llanos,
A. Panizo
*Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: Secondary appendiceal tumours (SATs) is an
uncommon entity. It often causes acute appendicitis. In this study, we
report the clinical and histopathologic features of secondary neoplasms
involving the appendix.
Methods: We performed a single-centre, retrospective study of patients
with confirmed SATs over a 30-year period of time. Direct extension of
neoplasms originating in organs in proximity were excluded. The follow-
ing parameters were recorded: patient clinical history, the appendiceal
wall involvement, primary tumour site, and histologic type.
Results: The study consisted of 20 cases. The median age was 65
years.14 presented acute abdomen/appendicitis at diagnosis. Primary sites
were gastrointestinal (n=6, 3 gastric signet-ring; 3 rectal adenocarci-
nomas), gynaecological (n=3, 1 ovarian clear cell carcinoma, 1 endome-
trial carcinoma; 1 leiomyosarcoma), pancreas-biliary tree (n=3), genito-
urinary (n=2, 1 urothelial carcinoma; 1 seminoma), lung (n=1 small cell
carcinoma), breast (n=1), mesothelioma (n=1), and 3 adenocarcinomas of
unknown origin. The wall involvement was: subserosa only (n=7),
subserosa-muscle layer (n=7), subserosa-submucosa (n=3) and
subserosa- mucosa (n=3). 13 SATs were synchronous and 5 were
metachronous. Follow-up was available in all patients: 16 died of disease
(median:2,5 months), 2 were free of disease and 2 in progression.
Conclusion: Although appendiceal metastasis are rare, it often results in
acute abdomen-appendicitis. Familiarity and awareness of SATs is vital
for accurate pathological diagnosis. The most frequent primary site in or
series is the gastrointestinal tract. The SATs were usually associated with
widespread disease and poor prognosis.

Maria-Alexandra, S.M. Sabo, D. Raduta, C. Popp
*Colentina University Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM) is a pre-
cancerous lesion, metaplastic areas expressing an impaired balance be-
tween apoptosis and proliferation. We aimed to investigate anti-apoptotic
activity in areas of IM, trying to identify patients with higher risk of
evolution towards malignancy.
Methods: Immunostaining for bcl-2, Ki67 and MUC4 was performed on
20 biopsies showing chronic gastritis with extensive IM, separated in two
groups: 10 cases Helicobacter pylori positive (HP+) and 10 cases
Helicobacter pylori negative (HP-). Bcl-2 and MUC4 positivity in meta-
plastic epithelium were scored as 0/1+/2+/3+/4+. Ki67 expression was
quantified as the percentage of positive tumour nuclei.
Results: Analysing comparatively the two groups, HP+ cases had a
higher degree of severity of gastritis (average score 2.4 compared to
0.6) and more important glandular atrophy (average score 0.4 compared
to 0). The mean score of bcl-2 and MUC4 positivity in the metaplastic
epithelium was more important in the HP+ group (1.3 versus 0.9 for bcl-2
and 1.6 versus 1.2 for MUC4, respectively). In the HP+ group, Ki67
expression in metaplastic epithelium was significantly higher than in
HP- group. Practically, HP+ group had a high proliferation rate associated
with a high anti-apoptotic activity.
Conclusion: The alteration of the balance between apoptosis and cell
proliferation is crucial in the development of gastric cancer; following
the dynamics of anti-apoptotic markers in gastritis with intestinal meta-
plasia we can ensure a good surveillance of patients at high risk for
dysplasia and gastric cancer.

Background & objectives: Tumoral microenvironment can count many
kinds of growth factors and cytokines including IL-10. Substantial evi-
dence recognizes IL-10 as an anti-inflammatory cytokine. We aimed to
evaluate the involvement of IL-10-1082A/G polymorphism in the occur-
rence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in a Tunisian population.
Virchows Arch
Methods: Forty-nine patients (males 67% and females 33%, Mean
age=60 years) with CRC, matched by sex with eighty healthy controls
(males 66% and females 34%, Mean age=58 years) were genotyped for
the cited polymorphism using the refractory mutation amplification sys-
tem (ARMS-PCR).
Results: The genotypic distribution of AG genotype was increased in
patients (69%) compared to controls (49%) suggesting its linkage to
CRC risk (p=0.022; OR=2.383; IC 95% [1.126- 5.041]). Gender stratifi-
cation demonstrated the association of IL-10 -1082A/G polymorphism
only in males (p=0.05, OR=2.417, IC 95% [0.979-5.966]). Stratifications
according disease stage and metastases do not show significant differ-
ences between allele/genotype distribution in patients vs controls.
Conclusion: Although preliminary, our data demonstrated that IL-10 -
1082A/G polymorphism was related to CRC susceptibility in overall
population as well as for males.

*Laboratory Microorganismes and Active Biomolecules, Sciences
Faculty of Tunis, University Tunis El Manar, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Some studies have focused on the involve-
ment of HLA-G gene, mainly the 3’untranslated (3’UTR) region, in co-
lorectal cancer(CRC) susceptibility. We aimed at exploring whether
HLA-G 14pb Insertion/Deletion (Ins/Del) could affect the occurrence or
the progression of colorectal cancer in Tunisian females.
Methods: Forty female patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer at the
Salah Azaiz Institute in Tunis (mean age= 54.65 years) and fifty-four
healthy donors (mean age: 55.36 years). Genotyping of HLA-G 14pb
Ins/Del was performed by conventional PCR.
Results: Comparison of the distribution of alleles and genotypes of
polymophism14pb Ins/Del of the HLA-G gene showed that patients with
Del allele (61% vs. 52%; p=0.199, OR= 1.467, 95% CI: [0.815-2.640])
and homozygous genotype Del/Del (43% vs. 24%; p=0.058, OR= 2.331,
95% CI: [0.962-5.645]) are more likely to be associated with colorectal
cancer risk. There was neither correlation with demographic parameters
nor with prognostic parameters (stage, grade).
Conclusion: In summary, HLA-G gene appears to be crucially involved
in the genetic predisposition to colorectal cancer in Tunisian population.
Further studies with larger cohort are needed to consolidate these prelim-
inary findings.

Pernaute, S. García Gómez de las Heras, M.J. Fernández Aceñero
*Hospital Clínico San Carlos; Universidad Complutense de Madrid,
Spain
Background & objectives: In western countries, gastric cancer (GC)
is diagnosed at advanced stages. Several prognostic factors apart
from the TNM system have been reported. Our aim is to describe
the outcomes and prognosticators of all patients with GC resected at
our institution.
Methods: Retrospective study of all cases of GC surgically resected in a
tertiary hospital from 2000 to 2019 (N=377). Clinical features were col-
lected, histological features were independently assessed by two pathol-
ogists and statistical analyses were performed. Patients who received
neoadjuvant therapy, metastatic tumours at diagnosis and patients with
R1/R2 resections were excluded from the study. 315 patients were finally
included.
Results: Tumours were intestinal (61%), diffuse (30.8%) and mixed
(9.9%), according to Laurén’s classification. Necrosis, vascular invasion,
perineural infiltration, infiltrative pattern, high grade tumours, signet-ring
cells and budding were observed in 22.1%, 37.3%, 37%, 64.3%, 50.2%,
32.8% and 22.4% of cases. Most tumours were T3 (49.2%), N+(59.6%).
During follow-up, 36.7% of tumours recurred and 27.4% of patients died
due to GC. Recurrence was significantly related to patient age, tumour
size, presence of signet-ring cells, Laurén subtype, tumour grade, peri-
neural infiltration, vascular invasion, T and N stage. Tumour death was
significantly associated with presence of signet ring cells, Laurén sub-
type, tumour grade, necrosis, infiltrative pattern, vascular invasion,
desmoplasia, T and N stage.
Conclusion: Most GC cases were diagnosed in elderly (mean: 72 years)
and symptomatic (89.9%) patients, and GC was detected at advanced
stages. Apart from the TNM stage, several histological features were
correlated with patient outcomes, including the identification of signet-
ring cells, perineural infiltration, vascular invasion, Laurén classification,
tumour grade, presence of necrosis and desmoplasia. The assessment of
histological features is cost-effective, easy to perform, and it may improve
the prognostic stratification of GC patients.

Pernaute, S. García Gómez de las Heras, M.J. Fernández Aceñero
*Hospital Clínico San Carlos; Universidad Complutense de Madrid,

Background & objectives: The TNM staging system is the main
prognostic tool in gastric cancer (GC). Lymph-node ratio (LNR) is
a recently studied feature which could improve patient stratification.
Our objective is to develop LNR-based prognostic scores for pa-
tients with resected GC.
Methods: Retrospective study of all cases of GC surgically resected in a
tertiary hospital from 2000 to 2019 (N=377). 315 cases were included.
Clinicopathological features were collected and univariate and multivar-
iate analyses were performed. Prognostic scores for predicting tumour
death and recurrence were constructed based on hazard ratios (HRs).
Their prognostic role was analysed by receiver-operating characteristic
(ROC) and Kaplan-Meier analyses.
Results: Most tumours were T3 (49.2%) N+ (59.6%), and mean LNR was
0.2. The recurrence score included LNR, T stage and Laurén subtypes,
and classified our patients into 5 groups (S1-S5). Kaplan-Meier curves for
disease-free survival (DFS) showed an excellent prognostic stratification,
and p value (log-rank test) was <0.001. The score for tumour death in-
cluded LNR and T stage. Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (OS)
showed and excellent stratification into 5 prognostic groups (p <0.001).
Mean OS for S1-S5 cases were 172, 140, 116, 84 and 22 months, respec-
tively. The AUC values for recurrence and tumour death were 0.722 and
0.763. Both scores were independently related to OS and DFS.
Conclusion: Lymph node staging is a controversial issue in GC, and
several alternative lymph node classifications have been proposed.
According to previous studies, LNR may reflect the extent of lymph node
dissection and overcome the limitations of the N stage. In our study,
LNR-based prognostic scores showed good prognostic performance in
GC patients. Thus, LNR-based scores may be helpful for patient stratifi-
cation in GC, and they may serve as an alternative or an adjunct to the
traditional TNM classification.

*Hospital Clínico San Carlos; Universidad Complutense de Madrid,
Spain
Background & objectives: Several alternative lymph node (LN) staging
systems have been recently described in gastric cancer (GC). The log
odds of positive LNs (LODDS) is calculated as “log [(positive LNs+
0.5)/(negative LNs+0.5)]”. We aim to evaluate the prognostic role of
LODDS in GC.
Methods: Retrospective study of all cases of GC surgically resected in a
tertiary hospital from 2000 to 2019 (N=377). Clinicopathological features
were collected, LODDS was calculated and statistical analyses were per-
formed. 315 patients were finally included. LODDS was categorized into
5 groups (S1-S5) for survival analysis. Cases were classified as S1
(25.6%), S2 (18.4%), S3 (21.3%), S4 (20.3%) and S5 (14.4%).
Results: The LODDS classification was significantly associated with
tumour size, Laurén subtype, presence of signet-ring cells, tumour grade,
perineural infiltration, lymphovascular invasion, growth pattern, tumour
recurrence and death. Kaplan-Meier analysis of disease-free survival
(DFS) according to the LODDS classification produced distinct, non-
overlapping curves (p<0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival
(OS) showed good patient stratification (p<0.001), but S1-S2 curves o-
verlapped after 60 months. N stage showed worse prognostic perfor-
mance for both OS and DFS by Kaplan-Meier analyses. AUC values
for recurrence and death were similar between the two classifications.
LODDS classification was independently related to both OS and DFS.
Conclusion: Some investigators have suggested that LODDS may be
superior to the TNM stage in GC. In our study, the LODDS-based clas-
sification showed better prognostic performance than the N stage, and it
was an independent predictor of OS and DFS. Based on these findings,
LODDS-based staging systems can be used at least as complementary
methods to predict patient outcomes in GC. Further research should eval-
uate the role of LODDS classifications in GC, and efforts should be taken
to standardize cut-off values.

Development of a simplified log odds of positive lymph nodes-tumour
staging system for western patients with resected gastric cancer

Pernaute, S. García Gómez de las Heras, M.J. Fernández Aceñero
*Hospital Clínico San Carlos; Universidad Complutense de Madrid,
Spain
Background & objectives: The log odds of positive lymph nodes
(LODDS) has been proposed as an alternative staging system for
predicting patient outcomes in gastric cancer (GC). Our aim is to develop
a simplified tumour-LODDS staging system for patients with resected
GC.
Methods: Retrospective study of all cases of GC surgically resected in a
tertiary hospital from 2000 to 2019 (N=377). Clinicopathological features
were collected. Neoadjuvant, metastatic and R1/R2 cases were excluded,
and 315 patients were finally included in the study. LODDS was calcu-
lated, and cases were categorized into 5 groups (L1-L5). A T-LODDS
staging system was developed and statistical analyses were performed.
Results: GC cases were classified as L1 (25.6%), L2 (18.4%), L3
(21.3%), L4 (20.3%) and L5 (14.4%). The T-LODDS classification di-
vided patients into 5 stages (S1-S5). Cases were S1 (8.3%), S2 (24.4%),
S3 (17.5%), S4 (28.7%) and S5 (21.1%). The T-LODDS system was
significantly associated with systemic symptoms, tumour size, depth,
macroscopical type (Borrmann classification), Laurén subtype, presence
of signet ring cells, tumour grade, lymphovascular invasion, perineural
infiltration, infiltrative growth, tumour recurrence and death due to tu-
mour. Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (OS) and disease-free
survival (DFS) showed distinct non-overlapping curves, and p value
according to log-rank test was <0.001. T-LODDS classification was an
independent predictor of both OS and DFS.
Conclusion: The simplified T-LODDS classification showed an excel-
lent prognostic performance in our study, and it was an independent
predictor of OS and DFS. Based on these results, the T-LODDS staging
system can be useful for predicting prognosis of patients with resected
GC, and it can at least complement the traditional TNM system. More
studies should be performed in larger populations to validate its prognos-
tic value.

Pernaute, S. García Gómez de las Heras, M.J. Fernández Aceñero
*Hospital Clínico San Carlos; Universidad Complutense de Madrid,
Spain
Background & objectives: In 2016, Choi et al. published a hybrid topo-
graphical and numerical lymph node (LN) staging system for gastric
cancer (GC). Our objective is to develop a T-LN staging system based
on the Choi classification for patients with resected GC.
Methods: Retrospective study of all cases of GC resected in a tertiary
hospital from 2000 to 2019 (N=377). Clinicopathological features were
collected. Neoadjuvant, metastatic and R1/R2 cases were excluded. 315
patients were included. Choi classification was applied, and tumours were
classified as N0 (49%), N1 (22.9%), N2 (17.4%) and N3 (107%). A T-LN
classification was constructed, and statistical analyses were performed.
Results: Patients were categorized into 6 groups according to the T-LN
classification: S1 (15.9%), S2 (15.5%), S3 (19.9%), S4 (19.1%), S5
(25.1%) and S6 (4.4%). This classification was significantly related to
systemic symptoms, tumour size, depth, Laurén classification, signet-ring
cells, tumour grade, necrosis, perineural infiltration, lymphovascular in-
vasion, recurrence and tumour death. Kaplan-Meier curves for OS
showed good stratification into 6 prognostic groups (p<0.001). The
TNM system showed poorer discriminatory ability (IA-IB, IIA-IIB and
IIIB-IIIC curves overlapped). In respect of disease-free survival (DFS),
both the TNM and T-LN systems showed good prognostic stratification.
AUC values for recurrence and tumour death were similar. The T-LN
classification was independently related to OS and DFS.
Conclusion: Previous research has shown that novel LN classifications
based on the anatomical extent of the disease can successfully predict the
prognosis of GC patients. In our study, a T-LN staging system based on
the Choi classification showed slightly better prognostic performance
than the TNM system. Thus, alternative T-LN classifications may help
to overcome the limitations of the current TNM system. Further studies in
larger populations should be performed to confirm the prognostic value of
alternative staging systems in GC.

Assessment of immunohistochemical expression of MMP9 and
EGFR in colorectal carcinomas with tumour budding – immunohis-
tochemical expression as prognosis tool and potential therapeutical
target
M. Filip*, D. Raduta, E. Ignat, A. Dinculescu, R. Ardeleanu, O. Stefan, C.
Socoliuc, A. Benguș, C. Popp
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Tumour budding (TB) is an adverse prog-
nostic factor in colorectal carcinomas (CRC), involved in local invasion
and distant metastasis.
The purpose of our study is evaluation of MMP9 and EGFR immunohis-
tochemical expression in peritumoral budding (pTB) and intratumoral
budding (iTB).
Virchows Arch
Methods: We conducted a retrospective, comparative study including 20
cases of colorectal adenocarcinomas (10 with pTB and 10 with iTB) record-
ing the type, stage, grade of anaplasia and grade of TB. We analysed ex-
pressionof MMP9 and EGFR in tumour, tumour budding and peritumoral
stroma and we correlated the results with clinicopathological data.
Results: MMP9 showed strong positivity in tumour in 17 cases (8 with
iTB, 9 with pTB), and in TB in 14 cases (8 with iTB, 6 with pTB); it was
moderately positive in peritumoral stroma in 15 cases (10 with iTB, 5
with pTB). EGFR was positive in tumour in 7 cases (4 with iTB, 3 with
pTB), in TB in 12 cases (5 with iTB, 7 with pTB), and in peritumoral
stroma in 4 cases with pTB. EGFR expression was statistically significant
higher in peritumoral stroma of tumours with pTB than of tumours with
iTB. MMP9 expression in peri-budding stroma was stronger that in
peritumoral stroma (p=0.0029, two tailed t-test)
Conclusion: MMP9, a gelatinase involved in degradation of extracellular
matrix and of the basement membranes, two essential steps in tumour
invasion and migration, is strongly positive in tumour cells and has and
enhanced expression in stroma around TB areas. EGFR expression is
high in tumour stroma, especially in tumours with pTB. As potential
therapeutical targets and markers of poor prognosis, MMP9 and EGFR
can be used in establishing sub-groups of CRC patients to include in
clinical trials.

*Menoufia University, National Liver Institute, Egypt
Background & objectives: Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the seventh
most common lethal cancer in Egypt. SIRT1 as histone deacetylase has
supposed protective role in colorectal inflammation and carcinogenesis.
To compare immunohistochemical expression of SIRT1 in control group,
inflammatory bowel disease, adenoma and CRC.
Methods: This retrospective study was carried out on 78 cases, divided
into four groups; 30 cases of CRC (colectomy specimens), 22 cases of
adenoma, 15 cases of IBD and 11 cases of control group.
Immunohistochemical expression of SIRT1 was evaluated by H-score
in using microarray technique.
Results: SIRT1 showed nuclear staining in all cases of the control and
IBD groups. Adenoma and CRC cases showed also SIRT1 expression in
95.5% and 77.4 % respectively. There was a significant progressive re-
duction of H-score values of SIRT1 from normal colonic specimens
(Mean=185) compared to IBD (Mean=78), adenoma (Mean=84) and
carcinoma (Mean=63). On the other hand, there was no statistical differ-
ences between adenoma and carcinoma groups regarding SIRT1
expression
Conclusion: SIRT1 has a protective suppressor role against intestinal
inflammatory and neoplastic processes. Its defective expression is asso-
ciated with promotion of inflammatory, dysplastic and carcinogenesis
sequence.

Prognostic significance of microsatellite instability in gastric
adenocarcinoma

*UR17ES17-faculté de médecine de tunis, université tunis el manar.,
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most ag-
gressive malignancies. Several associations between microsatellite insta-
bility (MSI) and other clinicopathological factors have been reported in
GC. In this study we investigated the correlation between MSI and prog-
nostic factors of GC.
Methods: The study included 37 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma.
MSI deficiency was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis using
MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 and confirmed by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) using a panel of five microsatellite markers specific for
two mononucléotide loci (BAT25, BAT26) and three dinucleotide loci
(D5S346,D17S250 and D2S123).
Results: Out of 37 total cases of gastric cancer, 29 (78,5%), 3 (8%), and 5
(13,5%) were microsatellite stable (MSS), low-level MSI (MSI-L), and
high-level MSI (MSI-H), respectively. Compared to MSS/MSI-L, MSI-H
gastric cancers were significantly associated with female gender (
P=0,021) and inflammatory stromal reaction (p=0,03). There was no
statistically significant association between MSI-H and other selected
clinical parameters: age, tumour location, who histotype, lymph node
status, vascular invasion, perineural invasion and pTNM status.
The 5-year overall survival of patients with MSI-H tumours was 80%
versus 44% for MSS/MSI-L tumours (p=0,37).
Conclusion: The MSI status should be incorporated in routine patholog-
ical report because it defines a different pathological entity with a better
outcome. Also, by its correlation with inflammatory stromal reaction, it
can be considered as a useful biomarker to identify patients who will
respond to immune checkpoint blockade inhibitors.

Brahim, M. Sabbah, A. Chadli-Debbiche
*Habib Thameur's Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The Cancer Genome Atlas, in 2014, provid-
ed a new molecular classification defining EBV-associated-gastric carci-
noma (EBVaGC) as a distinct subtype.
We analysed clinicopathological characteristics of EBVaGC.
Methods: One-hundred and eight gastric cancer patients treated by gas-
trectomy between 2001 and 2018 were enrolled. Clinical and pathological
features were recorded from the database. All diagnoses were confirmed
histologically. Tissue cores were sampled from the paraffin embedded
tumours after marking the most representative tumour regions and pre-
pared as tissue microarrays. EBER in-situ hybridization was performed
by an automated method.
Results: The tumour was EBER-negative if staining was only expressed in
benign lymphoid cells, and EBER-positive if the malignant epithelial cells
showed a nuclear staining. There were 108 gastric cancer patients of which
62 were men. EBV positivity was present in 39 cases. EBVaGC was
associated with age at diagnosis (45-84years;P =0.009).EBVaGC involved
the proximal parts in 20 cases. EBV-positivity was most detected in poorly
cohesive adenocarcinomas (53.8%;P=0.003). Seven cases were lympho-
epithelial-like carcinomas. There was no correlation of EBER-positivity
with the tumour stage or metastatic lymph nodes. Median as well as 1, 3,
and 5-year survivals among EBER-positive tumours were shorter. The
difference wasn’t shown to reach statistical significance (P = 0.19).
Conclusion: We found tumour EBV positivity more frequently in male
than female gastric carcinomas patients, similar to several other studies.
We also found higher EBV positivity in poorly cohesive adenocarcinoma
in contrast to other studies who showed predominance of intestinal type.
EBVaGC is a distinct subtype of gastric carcinoma with regard to its clini-
copathological features. It must be diagnosed in every resected specimen as
it can become a predictive biomarker for response to immune checkpoint
inhibitors.

*Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Tumour-Stroma Ratio (TSR) is currently con-
sidered as a prognostic factor in several cancers. The objective of our study
was to assess the prognostic value of TSR in colorectal carcinomas (CRC).
Methods: The study was retrospective in a period of one-year. We in-
cluded all cases of CRC stade II and III, diagnosed in the Pathology
department of Habib-Thameur Hospital, and for which tumour excision
was performed. Tumours were classified into two groups: Tumours rich
in stroma (TSR ≤50%) and tumours poor in stroma (TSR>50%), follow-
ing a methodology widely used in the literature.
Results: A total of 33 cases of CRC were included (16 males and 17
females). The mean age was 61.8 years. The TSR value was between
10% and 80% with an average of 39%. The TSR was > 50% in 17 cases
(51.5%) and ≤50% in 16 cases (48.5%). The overall survival was signif-
icantly reduced in cases of Tumours rich in stroma (p=0.005). We found a
correlation between a TSR ≤50% and tumour size (p= 0.028).
Correlations between TSR and lymph node status, tumour stage, and
lymphovascular invasion were not statistically significant.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that a high stroma proportion or an
exaggerated desmoplastic response would be associated with an
unfavourable outcome in patients with CRC. TSR is an important prog-
nostic and predictive factor for CRC. Its easy assessment and reliability
allow it to be used in clinical practice, particularly to identify high-risk
patients who can justify adjuvant chemotherapy.

Gastric MALT lymphoma: a report of 42 cases in a Tunisian health
care centre

Chadli-Debbiche
*Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Gastric MALT lymphoma (GML) is a rare
pathology with a low potential for malignancy. However, this lymphoma
can be easily under-diagnosed due to clinical and endoscopic polymor-
phism. Our study’s aim was to assess clinical, endoscopic, and
anatomopathological features of GML.
Methods: This was a retrospective descriptive study that included all
cases of GML, collected from the Pathology Department of Habib
Thameur Hospital over a period of 23 years (from 1997 to 2020).
Results: We collected 42 cases of GML. These were 24 men and 18
women (sex ratio = 1.3). The mean age was 53.7 years. The disease
was revealed in the majority of cases by abdominal pain. The endoscopic
appearance was nonspecific, dominated by ulcerations (42%), an ulcera-
tive tumour (18.4%), congestive gastropathy (15.8%), nodular
gastropathy (10.5%) or rarely an infiltrated appearance. These lesions
were in the antrum in the majority of cases. Helicobacter Pylori (HP)
was present in 44.5%. HP status was uncertain in 14% of cases. The
transformation of GML into large B cell lymphoma was noted in 24%
of cases. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the B phenotype in all cases.
Conclusion: Inconsistent with our results, GML is more common in
males. Its incidence increases significantly from the age of 40. It is a
lymphoma with a low potential for malignancy. This lymphoma pro-
gresses slowly and may resolve completely after eradication of HP. Its
transformation into LBDGC is possible and due to the accumulation of
new genetic alterations, especially, involving the bcl6 and p53 genes. The
immunological phenotype is CD20 +, CD79a +, CD5-, CD10-, CD23-,
CD43-, bcl2 +.

Isolated germline MSH6 mutation associated with Muir-Torre syn-
drome: a case report and review of the literature
A. Hogeboom Gimeno*, M. Camara Jurado, J.L. Rodriguez Peralto, R.
Gallardo Gallego, M.C. Garrido Ruiz
*Hospital 12 de Octubre, Spain
Background & objectives: Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) is a phenotypic
variant of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) associated
with germline mutation in mismatch repair gene MSH2 ( 90%) or
MLH1 (10%). We describe a rare case of MTS harbouring an isolated
MSH6 mutation.
Methods: Clinicopathologic features including phenotypic, histologic
and molecular characteristics of a recently diagnosed patient with MTS
and isolated germline MSH6 mutation are described. A literature review
is carried out identifying similar reported cases. Included cases meet
criteria of MTS (visceral malignancy associated with sebaceous epitheli-
oma, adenoma or carcinoma) while demonstrating an isolated MSH6
mutation upon germline mismatch repair gene analysis.
Results: A male with a history of multiple sebaceous neoplasms and co-
lorectal carcinoma (CRC) at age 54 was found to have a germline point
mutation in exon 4 of MSH6. Seven additional similar cases were identi-
fied in the literature making a total of eight cases meeting inclusion criteria:
7/8 cases (87%) were male and 6/8 cases (75%) developed CRC, with an
average age of presentation of 58.8 years. 60% of CRC occurred in distal
(rectosigmoid) colon. 5/8 cases (62%) developed extracolonic cancer. The
majority of mutations involved exon 4 of the MSH6 gene.
Conclusion: Despite scarce data, preliminary characterisation of
MSH6 mutation-associated MTS suggests a male predominance, a
relatively older age of CRC presentation (58.8 years in our series
versus 50 years, the median age of presentation of CRC previously
reported in MTS) and high risk of both colonic (especially of the
distal colon) and extracolonic malignancies. This peculiar pheno-
type may contribute to these patients frequently being missed when
screening for HNPCC using Amsterdam criteria.

*Department of Human Pathology in Adult and Developmental Age
“Gaetano Barresi”, Section of Pathology, University of Messina, Italy
Background & objectives: Macrophages are cellular protagonists of
tumour microenvironment in many tumours. In order to clarify the
clinico-pathological significance of intratumoral macrophages, we have
compared clinico-pathological features of two cohorts, analysing stage I-
II gastric adenocarcinomas containing macrophages with pT- and stage-
matched controls.
Methods: Twenty-four cases of stage I-II gastric adenocarcinomas
with intra-glandular foamy macrophages were identified; their
clinico-pathological features were firstly compared with 72 pT-
matched as well as stage-matched control cases of adenocarci-
nomas with case-control ratio of 1:3. The immunohistochemical
procedure against prediluted antibodies: CD68, CD 80 and CD163
on a Ventana BenchMark Ultra. Univariate and multivariate anal-
ysis have been applied.
Results: Macrophages showed immunoreactivity for CD68 and CD163
and were organized in mature granulomas. Immunohistochemical fea-
tures were reminiscent of M(Hb) macrophages, a specific phenotype
within M2 macrophages. In any case of our cohort, M1 macrophages
was documented by CD 80 immunostaining. There were no significant
differences in age, gender, tumour location, size, lymphovascular and
perineural invasion between case group with M(Hb) macrophages and
pT- as well as stage-matched controls; furthermore, case group showed
lower frequency of lymph node metastasis (p=0.02). A significant differ-
ent clinical course and overall survival rate were also observed in gastric
adenocarcinomas with macrophages (p=0.02) in comparison to controls.
Virchows Arch
Conclusion: We suggest that tumour-associated M(Hb) macrophages are
related with a quite indolent growth and a better prognosis of patients with
this peculiar variant of gastric adenocarcinomas.

Novel immunohistochemical markers for gastrointestinal stromal
tumours with potential prognostic and therapeutical value

Mastalier, C. Popp
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are
the most frequent mesenchymal neoplasms of the digestive tract and are
characterized by variable histopathological features and clinical out-
comes. The aim of this study is to evaluate Her2 and p16 expression in
GISTs.
Methods: We present a retrospective study including 16 cases of GISTs.
Immunohistochemical analysis for c-kit, DOG1, CD34, Her2 and p16
was performed. For all specimens we registered location, morphology,
mitotic count, tumour size and tumour risk (based on recent WHO guide:
low risk - 1, 2, 3a, 3b; high risk - 4, 5, 6a, 6b).
Results: The stomach location demonstrated predominant spindle mor-
phology (5/6 cases) and a smaller medium size (4.6 cm) compared to the
colon (7 cm). Her2 positivity correlated with a higher risk (71.42% of
high risk-GIST showed Her2 overexpression vs. 33.33% of low risk-
GIST), but also with a mixt morphology and a gastric location. There
was no relationship found between p16 expression and any of the histo-
pathological features.
Conclusion: Our results suggest a strong correlation between Her2 over-
expression and risk grade, tumour extension and mitotic index. Despite
literature data, our research could not correlate p16 levels with any of the
high-risk features. These interesting findings demonstrate the necessity
for larger studies that can further characterize from a molecular point of
view this peculiar type of stromal tumours. A better understanding of
GISTs can lead to the discovery of new therapeutical options.

*Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Serbia
Background & objectives: Precise diagnosis of Crohn disease (CD) in
children and adolescents and lesion distribution are crucial for therapy
choice in CD. The aim of study is to determine frequency of lesions in
proximal segments of gastrointestinal tract in paediatric CD patients.
Methods: All biopsies taken at the University Children's Hospital,
Belgrade over the 4-year period (2017-2019) were reviewed using histo-
pathology reports from the files of the Institute of Pathology, Faculty of
Medicine, University of Belgrade. Selected histological slides were re-
examined.
Results: A total of 49 cases of CD were identified with similar frequency
in both gender (M:F=1.04). The average age of patients was 14.5 ± 2.61
years. Median of symptoms duration before histopathological diagnoses
of CD was 5 months (3 weeks - 5 years). One quarter of patients (13/49)
had specific histopathological findings related to CD in proximal seg-
ments of gastrointestinal tract. Chronic granulomatous inflammation
was found in the oesophagus (3), stomach (5) and duodenum (1).
Focally enhanced gastritis was found in 10.2% of patients with CD of
ileum and colon. More than half of patients with characteristic CD lesions
(7/13) in proximal gastrointestinal tract had normal findings at proximal
endoscopy.
Conclusion: A significant proportion of paediatric CD patients have
proximal gastrointestinal lesions. Multiple biopsies are crucial for CD
diagnosis in proximal gastrointestinal tract in children because poor en-
doscopic detection of characteristic lesions.

Hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder: a diagnostic pitfall
with hepatocellular carcinoma
D. João*, A. Furtado, A. Sanches, L. Santos
*Department of Anatomic Pathology, Centro Hospitalar de Vila Nova de
Gaia/Espinho, Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Hepatoid adenocarcinoma is a variant of
adenocarcinoma with histopathological features that resemble hepatocel-
lular carcinoma, its main differential diagnosis. It most commonly arises
in the stomach and less frequently in the lung, kidney, pancreas and
gallbladder, the latter being exceedingly rare.
Methods: We report the case of 59-year-old male followed in the infec-
tious diseases department due to hepatitis C infection. An ultrasonogra-
phy study revealed a polypoid lesion of the gallbladder, initially
suspected as a metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, comput-
ed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging detected no lesions in
the liver besides hepatic cirrhosis. The patient was then submitted to a
cholecystectomy.
Results: Microscopically, a malignant epithelial neoplasm was found,
with muscular layer invasion. The tumour was composed of cords and
sheets of large polygonal cells with enlarged nuclei, evident nucleoli and
abundant cytoplasm, resembling hepatocytes. There was neither
lymphovascular nor perineural invasion and no hepatic tissue was iden-
tified. Immunostaining was diffusively positive for CAM5.2, Glipican-3
and AFP, with multifocal arginase positivity. No immunoreaction was
found for CK7 and CK19. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with primary
hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder. The patient’s serum AFP
values returned to normal range after the surgery. Only 15 other cases
have been reported in English published literature during the last 20 years,
which were reviewed.
Conclusion: This rare entity is thought to derive either from hepatic
differentiation of conventional adenocarcinoma during tumour progres-
sion or from bipotential neoplastic cells that differentiate into cells with
either hepatoid or glandular features. Hepatoid adenocarcinoma may or
may not produce AFP and seems to have a more aggressive course than
adenocarcinomas without hepatoid features, regardless of AFP produc-
tion. Due to location and morphologic similarities to hepatocellular car-
cinoma it should be taken into account as a differential diagnosis, as

Pharmacy, Timișoara, Romania
Background & objectives: The pathological grading of mucinous car-
cinoma (MC) is still unreliable, with successive amendments in the
2000/2010/2019 WHO colorectal carcinoma (CRC) classifications. We
aimed to investigate whether the histological grade based on glandular
differentiation has prognostic significance in MC.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study on a group of 191
patients with MC who underwent surgery at the "Pius Brînzeu"
County Emergency Hospital from Timișoara, Romania. All tumours
were staged and graded according to the AJCC 2017 and WHO
2019 CRC classifications. In multivariable analyses, we assessed
the associations between the histological grades and the other prog-
nostic factors in CRC.
Virchows Arch
Results: Based on the degree of glandular differentiation, 17 cases (8.9%)
were well differentiated (G1) MC, showing >95% glandular formation,
115 (60.2%) moderately differentiated (G2) - 50-95% glandular forma-
tion, and 59 cases (30.89%) poorly differentiated (G3) with glandular
structures in <50% of the tumour. Regarding the associations of histolog-
ical grade with the prognostic parameters, we observed positive correla-
tions between MC grade and patients' age (p=0.0332), tumour extension -
pT (p=0.059), lymph node status - pN (p=0.0168), lymphovascular inva-
sion – LVI (p=0.0005) and tumour site – right colon/left colon/rectum
(p=0.0477). All G3 MCs cases were diagnosed in the pT3-pT4 stage and
the vast majority was associated with right side, pN+ and LVI+.
Conclusion: In our hands, the conventional classification based on the
degree of glandular differentiation seems to have prognostic significance.
Due to the ease of evaluation on usual stained slides, histological grade
appears to be a promising prognostic factor in MC, but still requires
establishing of the cut-offs between grade classes, therefore standardiza-
tion of the assessment method and its validation in large prospective
cohort studies.

*Department of Pathology, “Victor Babeș” University of Medicine and
Pharmacy, Timișoara, Romania
Background & objectives: The tumour stage remains the strongest and
most reliable prognostic factor in colorectal cancer (CRC). We evaluated
the clinicopathological parameters in early vs. deeply invasive NOS ad-
enocarcinomas, variables that could better predict the adverse outcome in
patients with CRC.
Methods: We performed a ten-year retrospective study on 1612 patients
with NOS adenocarcinomas who underwent surgical resections in
Timișoara County Hospital. Associations between the pT parameter
(pT1-pT2 vs. pT3-pT4) and the following prognostic factors: age, sex,
tumour location, histological grade (G), lymph node status (pN),
lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and distant metastasis were statistically
analysed using Chi square/Fisher's exact test.
Results: Regarding the tumour extension in the intestinal wall, we
observed 240 (15%) pT1-pT2 and 1372 (85%) pT3-pT4 adenocar-
cinomas. In terms of tumour differentiation: 107 adenocarcinomas
were well differentiated (7%) (G1), 1280 (79%) moderately differ-
entiated (G2), 207 (13%) poorly differentiated (G3) and 18 cases
(1%) undifferentiated carcinomas (G4). From the category of pT1-
pT2 tumours, only 2 cases (0.8%) were pM1, 42 (17.5%) pN+, 27
(11.25%) LVI and 105 tumours (43.75%) were diagnosed in the
rectum. In the multivariate analysis, right localization (p<0.0001),
poor differentiation (p = 0.0005), pN+ (p<0.0001), LVI+
(p<0.0001) and distant metastasis (p<0.0003) were significantly as-
sociated with the depth of tumour invasion.
Conclusion: In our study, we showed that clinicopathological parameters
could provide solutions for risk stratification in patients with CRC.
Although the analysis of certain molecular factors are useful and attrac-
tive from the perspective of prognostic significance for these patients, the
risk of aggressive tumour behaviour in CRC with early invasion of the
intestinal wall can be predicted easier and more cost-effective by evalu-
ating histological parameters on HE stained slides.

Clinicopathologic and prognostic differences between mucinous and
non-mucinous adenocarcinoma
G. Kir*, H. Gunel, Z.C. Olgun, R.B. Girgin, I. Tosun, O. Alimoglu
*Istanbul Medeniyet University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Mucinous adenocarcinoma (MAC) is a his-
tological subtype of colorectal cancer. The principal aim of this study was
to evaluate whether the biological behaviour of MACs differs from that of
non-mucinous adenocarcinoma (NMAC) in patients undergoing surgery
for colorectal cancer.
Methods: The relationship between clinicopathologic parameters and
tumour histology was investigated in 180 consecutive patients who
underwent surgical resection for colorectal carcinoma.18 out of
180(10%) tumours were MAC,162 out of 180(90%) were NMAC. The
patients’ clinicopathological parameters and follow-up and survival data
were obtained. The log rank test was used for univariate survival analysis,
and the multivariate Cox regression for overall survival (OS) and disease-
free survival (DFS).
Results: On multivariate analysis, larger tumour size and lymph node
involvement were more frequently observed in patients with MAC than
NMAC (odds ratio (OR) = 10.411,95% confidence interval (CI)=2.436-
44.498, p=0.002, OR=6.402, 95%CI=1. 380-29.696, p=0.018, respec-
tively) The majority of the MAC were located on the right side
(OR=7.539, 95%CI=1.575-36.074, p = 0.11). The median follow-up pe-
riod was 46 months. We observed a statistically significant difference
between MAC (81.3%) and NMAC (94.9%) for five-year DFS
(OR=4.518,95%CI=1.130-18.072,p=0.033). We did not observe a
statistically significant difference for five-year OS between MAC
(72.2%) and NMAC (84.6%).The multivariate Cox proportional haz-
ards model revealed that larger tumour size, older age and presence
of lymphovascular invasion were significantly associated with de-
creased OS (OR= 2.070, 95%CI=0.991-4.321, p=0.053, OR =3.712
95CI =1.655-8.326, p=0.003 and OR=3.652, 95%CI=1.676-7.956,
p=0.002, respectively).
Conclusion: Patients with MAC have worse outcomes compared to pa-
tients with NMAC. On multivariate analysis, mucinous histology was an
independent predictor for DFS with an odds ratio of 4.518.

Role of microvessels in predicting risk of distant metastasis in local-
ised colorectal cancer
A. Konstantinov*, K. Shelekhova
*St. Petersburg Oncological Center, Russia
Background & objectives: Colorectal cancer can recur within five years
as distant metastasis in about 25% of cases. Our study aimed to identify
the role of microvascular density (MVD) and pericyte impaired
microvessels (MPI) in the risk of metastasis.
Methods: We undertake a retrospective study of lymph node-
negative colorectal cancer with synchronous distant metastases
(n=53), metachronous metastasis (n=45), and without metastases
(n=53). The mean follow-up was five years. Triple immunohisto-
chemical staining was made: ERG, α-SMA, podoplanin. In the
highest neovessel density area, individual microvessels are counted
in an area 1.0 mm2. The index of microvessel immaturity MPI/
MVD was calculated (Index-V).
Results: Normal blood vessels have shown ERG expression and α-SMA
immunoreactivity anywhere around the vessel perimeter, whereas imma-
ture tumour microvessels lacked α-SMA immunoreactivity. The differ-
ence of MVD in groups was insignificant, mean 10/mm2 in non-
metastasizing and 11/mm2 in metastasizing. Metastasizing tumours dem-
onstrate significantly higher MPI (mean 8/mm2 versus 2/mm2) and
higher Index-V (mean 0.69 versus 0.21). Both showed a significant cor-
relation with distant metastasis (p<0.0001).
Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that immature neovasculariza-
tion correlates with metastasis, resulting in a poorer prognosis. Taken
together, not only microvessel density but also vascular maturation is
crucial factors for colorectal cancer patients. The evaluation of tumour
angiogenesis from the viewpoint of its maturation and its quantity helps
predict the tumour's malignant potential.

Dag, I. Aydin, I. Cakir, N. Ekinci, S. Karaarslan, A. Akder Sari
*Izmir Katip Celebi University Ataturk Training and Research Hospital
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Grading of dysplasia in colorectal adenomas
(CRA) is important given the huge impact on post-polypectomy surveil-
lance. Two-tiered grading system low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and high-
grade dysplasia (HGD) is suggested and terms such as adenocarcinoma
in-situ or intramucosal carcinoma are discouraged.
Methods: To assess the usage of current dysplasia grading guidelines in
routine daily practice and the interobserver variability in CRAs, patholo-
gists are provided by current detailed dysplasia grading guidelines. Six
gastrointestinal, 3 routine pathologists independently evaluated 40 CRA-
biopsies, first-as in their routine practice and after (min 30 days washout)
current guidelines were provided. Inter-observer κ statistics was assessed
using multi-rater Kappa.
Results: All observers preferred to use variable terminology including
adenocarcinoma in-situ and/or intramucosal adenocarcinoma for HGD in
routine practice; these cases are grouped as HGD for statistics. The
interrater agreement was fair (K=0.371;95%CI 0.369-0.372) among all
observers. However, it was higher among routine pathologists in compar-
ison to GI pathologists; moderate (K=0,600;95%CI 0.594-0.606) versus
fair (K=0,261; 95%CI 0.258-0.263) respectively. In the second review,
interrater agreement increase to moderate among all observers
(K=0,509;95%CI 0.508-0.511). The increase-rate was intense among
GI-pathologists (K=0.523;95% CI 0.520-0.525) but was slight, reaching
to substantial among routine pathologists (K=0,630;95%CI 0.624-0.635).
The diagnostic rate of LGD increased by 1,1 to 10 times among GI
pathologists in the second review.
Conclusion: Current dysplasia grading guidelines are not widely used
even amongst in GI pathologists. Variable terminologies for HGD are still
common in practice. Implementation of current guidelines to practice
increases interobserver agreement and helps to avoid overdiagnose of
LGD as HGD. Strategies should be developed to ensure the usage of
current guidelines in routine practice.

Incidence and clinicopathological features of mismatch repair defi-
cient (MMR-d) colorectal carcinomas (CRC): a tertiary single-centre
data from Turkey
M. Konur*, S. Demir, B. Bolat Kucukzeybek, I. Cakir, A. Akder Sari
*Izmir Katip Celebi University Ataturk Training and Research Hospital
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Mismatch repair immunohistochemistry
(MMR-IHC) is a widely used method to detect microsatellite instability
(MSI). Reflex testing to all newly diagnosed colorectal carcinomas
(CRCs) is suggested. The study aims to investigate the incidence of
MMR-d CRCs and clinicopathological features.
Methods: Consecutive CRC resections from a total of 455 patients in
between March 2017- May 2020 were included in the study. The data were
recorded from database including MMR-IHC results. Suboptimal stainings
were reviewed and 24 patients were excluded for various reasons.
Results: MMR-d tumours constituted 10% (44/431) of all CRCs, the
mean age of the patients among MMR-d tumours 63,14 (min34-
max94); MMR-stable tumours 64,2 (min 30-max90). MMR-d and
MMR-stable tumours female/male ratio was 21 (47,7%)/23 (52.3%);
165 (42.6%) /222 (57,3%) respectively.
The rate of MMR-deficiency among multiple CRC tumours was higher
(25%) than unifocal tumours (10,7%). Right colon was the most common
location in MMR-d tumours in comparison to MMR-intact tumours
(72%, 30,6%). The rate of mucinous adenocarcinoma was also higher
in MMR-d tumours 11,3% ( 5/44) than MMR-intact tumours 6,3% (25/
395).
Among MMR-d tumours, 72,7% (n=32), 25% (n=11), %2,2 (n=1)
showed MLH1&PMS2, MSH2&MSH6 and PMS2 deficiency
respectively.
Conclusion: According to our single-centre data, the incidence and clin-
icopathological features of MMR-d tumours seem to be in line with the
literature in Turkish population. It is noteworthy that multiple tumours
tend to have a higher rate of MMR deficiency in comparison to unifocal
tumours.

Tunisia
Background & objectives: Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a major
molecular subtype in gastric adenocarcinoma characterised by high lym-
phoid infiltration.
The aim of this work was to assess tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs) in gastric cancer with MSI status.
Methods: TILs density was scored on haematoxylin-eosin staining
slides in thirty-seven gastric adenocarcinoma cases. Score ranged
from no staining (0), weak staining (1), moderate staining (2) to
strong staining (3).
Gastric adenocarcinoma microsatellite status was classified as MSI-high,
MSI-low and microsatellite stable (MSS) after performing immunohisto-
chemistry and genotyping.
Fisher exact test was used for statistical analysis.
Results: Among the thirty-seven cases, eight cases had MSI status: five
were MSI-high and three MSI-low.
In the twenty-nine MSS cases, TILs were absent in ten and present in
nineteen cases. Among these latter, TILs level was high in three cases,
moderate in five cases and low in eleven cases. In gastric adenocarcinoma
with MSS status, the number of cases with absent TILs and low-density
TILs was significant (P<0.05).
In the five cases of MSI-high, TILs level was the highest in three cases
and moderate in two cases.
In the three cases of MSI-low, TILs level was the highest in one case only
and moderate in two cases.
Conclusion: Tumour infiltrating lymphocytes were present in all gastric
adenocarcinoma MSI cases and in 19/29 cases with MSS status.
However, the absence and the low density of TILs in gastric adenocarci-
noma MSS cases were significant.

*Student Science Club at Collegium Medium, Jan Kochanowski
University, Poland
Background & objectives: People who suffer from celiac disease pres-
ent HLA II DQ2 or DQ8 which binds to gliadin and then activates CD4
T-cells in the intestinal mucosa. This autoimmune activation produces
chronic inflammation of the small bowel mucosa, leading to gradual
malabsorption.
Virchows Arch
Methods: A double immunohistochemistry was constructed using CD4
antibodies matched by DAB on brown and CD8(Ventana CP57 clone)
antibody matched by RED. We applied CD8 α-β subunit because of their
specificity and 80% sensitivity to celiac disease. This approach allowed us
a full insight into CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes distribution. All CD8+
cases were serologically tested according to celiac disease guidelines.
Results: In group of 20 patients with chronic active gastritis caused by
Helicobacter pylori and also in group of 12 patients with active ulcerative
colitis we found IEL above 40/100. The double CD4/CD8 assay presented
stromal dominance CD4+ lymphocytes and IEL CD8+ were detected in
non-typical way. Unsurprisingly, celiac independent mucosal lymphocyto-
sis was observed in 60% cases, but in 7 H. pylori cases and 3 among
ulcerative colitis, anti-transamidase antibodies were detected. These cases
were re-diagnosed as a principal entity with concurrent silent celiac disease.
Conclusion: In our opinion double CD4/CD8 staining provides more
information then CD3 plus CD8 or the recommended singular test of CD3.

The newly developed SP70 is a specific marker for gastric adenocar-
cinoma of fundic gland type
R. Luo*, W. Huang, C. Xu, Y. Hou
*Zhong Shan Hospital, Fudan University, China
Background & objectives: GA-FG is a novel and rare entity with low-
grade malignancy. SP70,as a newly developed monoclonal antibody
(McAb), was found to be sensitive in many tumours. This study aims to
explore the diagnostic value and potential role of SP70 in GA-FGs.
Methods: A total of 33 cases were obtained from our institution (includ-
ing 16 fundic gland polyps (FGPs), 9 oxyntic gland polyps/adenomas
(OGPs), and 8 GA-FGs). We performed immunostaining for SP70 in
different groups. SPSS 21.0 was used for statistical analysis.
Results: Immunohistochemically, 16/16 (100%) FGPs were diffusely
positive for SP70, and some scattered SP70 positive cells were observed
in OGPs (5/9, 55.6%); however, expression of SP70 was completely
missing in GA-FGs (2/8, 25.0%), with statistical significant differences
between groups (P < 0.001). In light to this significant finding, we are
now carrying out further studies with large sample to confirm our results.
Conclusion: SP70 could serve as a potential biomarker to identify GA-
FGs and hold. A diagnosis of GA-FG should be considered with the
depletion of SP70 expression.

Background & objectives: Morphological diagnosis of dysplasia in
Barrett’s oesophagus (BE) is demanding and requires huge experience
in gastrointestinal pathology. Despite using similar guidelines agreement
between pathologists on presence and grade of dysplasia remains unsat-
isfactory. Immunohistochemical evaluation may improve diagnostics of
dysplastic BE.
Methods: Morphological diagnosis of dysplasia in Barrett’s oesophagus
(BE) is demanding and requires huge experience in gastrointestinal pa-
thology. Despite using similar guidelines agreement between pathologists
on presence and grade of dysplasia remains unsatisfactory.
Immunohistochemical evaluation may improve diagnostics of dysplastic
BE.
Results: DBE was presented in 17 patients (15,2%): 15 patients with low-
grade dysplasia (LGD) and 2 with high-grade dysplasia (HGD).
Hyperexpression of p53 was recognized in 15 (88,23%) cases of DBE
(13 LGD, 2 HGD), staining in non-dysplastic BE (NDBE) was scattered.
Expression of p16 was cytoplasmic in 9 (52,94%) cases of DBE (focal in
7 LGD, diffuse in 2 HGD), but scattered nuclear in NDBE.
Immunostaining of Ki67 and cyclin D1 was marked in DBE and focal
in NDBE. Expression of β-catenin changed pattern from membranous in
NDBE and LGD to cytoplasmic and nuclear in HGD. Expression of
AMACR was scattered in NDBE, focal in LGD and diffuse in HGD.
Conclusion: Immunohistochemical evaluation with p53, Ki67, cyclin
D1, β-catenin and AMACR is a promising tool for precise diagnosis of
dysplasia in patients with BE. It is helpful for distinguishing between
NDBE, LGD and HGD. Further research is needed to assess prognostic
value of these immunohistochemical markers in progression to oesopha-
geal adenocarcinoma in patients with BE.

Poorly differentiated clusters in colorectal cancer: a novel predictive
factor associated with other relevant poor prognostic factors
L. Molina*, A. Sabio González, C. Cantero-González, R.J. Luque Barona
*UGC Anatomía Patológica, Hospital Universitario de Jaén, Spain
Background & objectives: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is currently the
third most-commonly diagnosed cancer. Recently, poorly differentiated
clusters (PDC) - small groups of ≥5 cells without glandular differentiation
– had been proposed as a novel prognostic factor associated with other
adverse histopathological findings.
Methods: In a cohort of 84 patients with surgically resected stage I-IV
CRC -without neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment-, we assessed retrospec-
tively the prognostic value of several clinical-pathological variables, in-
cluding PDC, tumour budding (TB), grade (G1-G3), lymphovascular
(LVI) and perineural (PI) invasion, lymph node metastases, survival time
and clinical stage. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS.
Results: The cohort included 54 men and 30 women (40-90 years). 25
patients died from the disease, with a survival time between 0-50 months,
and 7 patients died from causes other than disease. G2 (85.7%) was the
prevailing histological grade and stage III (33,3%) was the predominant
clinical stage. A 50% of the cases had metastasis to lymph nodes, 66.7%
LVI and 28.6% PI. Regarding TB, 52.4% had a low score, 27.4% moderate
and 20.2% high. PDC evaluation resulted in a low score in 58.3%, moderate
in 21.4% and highin 20.2%. Histological grade (p <0.016), TB (p<0.0001),
LVI (p <0.007) and PI (p <0.031) were significantly associated with PDC.
Conclusion: PDC grade seems to be a prognostic factor in CRC, as high
PDC score in peritumoral regions were associated with other relevant poor
prognostic factors, like grade, TB, LVI and PI. Given its easy identification,
it may be included in the histological report. However, before it can be
introduced in clinical practice, more studies should be performed in order to
establish the optimal cut-off for each grade and give it broader validation.

PRGS and in-situ immunophenotype as a combined „tool“ for mon-
itoring the therapeutical efficiency of PIPAC in different peritoneal
cancer diseases: a single centre experience

Schredl, K. Emmanuel, T. Jäger
*Institute of Pathology, Austria
Background & objectives: Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemo-
therapy (PIPAC) is able to induce regression of peritoneal metastasis
(PM). The Peritoneal Regression Grading Score (PRGS) is used for as-
sessment of therapy response. Nevertheless, the role of the related im-
mune phenotype is still unknown.
Methods: We investigate retrospectively the PRGS of patients with peri-
toneal metastases in a single and reference centre for PIPAC in Austria.
The PRGS was judged on four peritoneal biopsies with HE-staining and
tumour-entity related immunostainings to quantify infiltrating tumour
cells. Additionally, the effect of localized immune response was analysed
by additional immunohistochemical staining for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25
and TIA, too.
Virchows Arch
Results: Overall, peritoneal metastasis of the enrolled 48 patients (fe-
male/male: 26/22 with a mean age of 60.3 +/- 11.6 years) derived mainly
of gastric cancer, malignant mesothelioma and ovary cancer. Based on a
total sum of 134 PIPACs and 532 PRGS the mean [with confidence
interval]/median PRGS after the first and after the last PIPAC were 2.6
[2.4-2.7]/3.0 and 2.0 [1.9-2.2]/2.0 with the lowest value of 1.1 [0.8-1.4]/
1.0 at the fourth PIPAC. Additionally, we were able to link the PRGS and
associated fibrosis to a specific regulative immune response. The PRGS
and the observed immune phenotype were associated to intraperitoneal
status and clinico-pathological parameters.
Conclusion: We demonstrated that the standardized applied PRGS is
adequate to monitor the therapy response and outcome in cases with
enhanced PM. The related in-situ immune phenotype supported this no-
tion. In the future, the definitive predictive and prognostic role of the
PIPAC induced immune reaction needs to be evaluated in prospective
and international clinical trials.

*University of Fortaleza, Brazil
Background & objectives: Anorectal cytology (ARC) screening pro-
grams can allow the detection of small lesions for treatment and eradica-
tion of high-grade intraepithelial lesions and careful monitoring to detect
early invasive cancer. Demonstrate the importance of ARC in HPV-
induced lesions.
Methods: It was performed the liquid-based anal cytology in 219 HIV-
positive patients, aged 18 to 75 years, 188 men and 31 women, with a
mean age of 40 years.
Results: Among the 219 participants cytologically evaluated, we identi-
fied 12 people (5.47%) presenting atypical squamous cells of undeter-
mined significance (ASCUS), a marker for a possible anal neoplasm.
About this result, it is notable the higher prevalence of ASCUS in men
(83.3%) compared to women (16.6%) in the survey. The average age of
the patients was 43 years. Subsequently, it will be necessary to perform an
anoscopy to explore other possible clinical findings in the examination.
Conclusion: Over the past 50–60 years the incidence of invasive squamous
cell carcinoma of the cervix has decreased around 80% in countries which
have implemented cervical screening program with quality, coverage, treat-
ment and follow-up of the women. Likewise, anal screening programs may
generate comparable success, since anal cytology sampling of the anal–
rectal transformation zone can detect squamous intraepithelial lesions.
Therewith, patients with ASC-US) or worse should be referred for
anoscopy.

Application of immunohistochemistry for gastritis staging
assessment

Kononov
*Omsk State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: Chronic gastritis (CG) staging is useful way
to estimate the risk of gastric cancer. However, compliance with the
international recommendations (the number and orientation of gastric
biopsy specimens) is crucial. The usage of immunohistochemistry
(IHC) techniques may improve staging assessment.
Methods: The study included antral mucosa specimens with absolute
and metaplastic atrophy (n=465) from 155 patients with CG. IHC
markers CDX2, MUC2, CD10, MUC5AC, MUC6 were used.
MUC5AC, MUC6, MUC2 staining intensity was estimated on the
basis of semiquantitative scale (from 0-absent to 3-marked). CD10
expression was assessed binary (presence/absence). CDX-2 staining
was evaluated according to intensity: absent-0, weak/moderate-1,
marked-2.
Results: In the samples with absolute atrophy MUC5AC and MUC6
were strongly expressed in the gastric surface/pits region and glands
cells cytoplasm, respectively. The more was atrophy severity, the less
was length of MUC6 expression zone. In intestinal metaplasia (IM)
there was a nuclear CDX-2 staining in all cells, intensity varied from
1 in incomplete IM to 2 in complete IM. There was also strong
cytoplasmic MUC2 expression in goblet cells, and brush border-
associated CD10 expression in complete IM. Weak CDX-2 nuclear
staining in the gastric epithelium had also been the most interesting.
Focal complete IM was found in 75% of such specimens after addi-
tional histological sections.
Conclusion: The obtained data of the markers expression revealed CDX-
2 protein as the most valid for atrophy assessment with sensitivity=86%
[73.26-94.1] and specificity=74% [57.51-83.77]. Moreover, CDX-2 was
expressed throughout the gland, which would be extremely helpful in
absence of proper specimen orientation. This position gives us ground
for thinking about CDX-2 as a possible surrogate marker of the gastric
mucosal atrophy.

may improve of chronic gastritis (CG) stage assessment in cases of po-
tential non-compliance with the investigation protocol (fewer number of
biopsy specimens). Marker of intestinal differentiation CDX-2 might be
used for such approach.
Methods: CDX-2 expression parameters were evaluated in 155 CG
cases assessed with OLGA system. The following parameters were
analysed: expression pattern (EP, ≤3 cells – 1, >3 cells – 2, the
whole gland – 3), CDX2-positive cells (PC, 0%-0, <5%-1, 5-25%-
2, 25-50%-3, >50%-4), staining intensity (IS, none-0, weak-1,
strong-2). CDX-2 expression indexes (EI) were calculated according
by formula: EP+PC×IS.
Results: Correlations between CDX-2 index and CG stage were cal-
culated according to artificial model of taking biopsies from one, two
or three points of gastric mucosa. The highest r-Spearman's values
were recorded for point 3 (stomach angle, r=0.673, p<0.01); 3 and 5
(greater curvature of the corpus, r=0.624, p<0.01); 1 (greater curva-
ture of the antrum, r=0.592, p<0.01), respectively. Logistic regres-
sion models of CG staging based on CDX-2 index were constructed.
The highest Se=80.4%, Sp=82.8% and Ac=83.9% were demonstrat-
ed by a model based on EI in biopsy specimens from points 1+3+5.
EI less than 7 indicated CG stages I-II and greater than 7 for stages
III-IV.
Conclusion: The adapted approach for CG stage assessment based on
CDX-2 expression evaluation can be used if OLGA-system protocols are
violated, number of specimens is low or samples are damaged
(fragmentated, not oriented, etc). In such cases, CG staging with the usage
of CDX-2 (EI) would be helpful approach to estimate CG stage in a
particular patient and stratify the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma
development.

Gastric carcinoma with lymphoid stroma: a case report and litera-
ture review, with emphasis on different classification systems, includ-
ing ISH/IHC classification as a molecular surrogate

Background & objectives: Gastric cancer (GC) is the 3rd-cause of
cancer-related mortality worldwide. The various current classification
systems reflect its morphological, prognostic and molecular heterogene-
ity. Aim: Critically review/discuss the usefulness of different classifica-
tion systems, applied to a rare case of GC with lymphoid stroma.
Methods: Case:62-year-old male with an infiltrative lesion in the incisura
angularis/small curvature, which on resection measured 9x7cm and in-
vaded the serosa. Microscopy showed a poorly differentiated neoplasm
composed of polygonal cells with indistinct borders, arranged in irregular
nests and permeated by abundant lymphocytes. EBER-ISH was positive.
MLH-1, E-cadherin and P53 showed physiological expression. PD-L1
was positive in >50% of tumour cells.
Results: According to current GC classifications, our case would be
included in the indeterminate-type (Lauren), infiltrative-type (Ming) and
GC with lymphoid stroma (WHO) groups. These “morphological” clas-
sifications fail to reflect the driver tumorigenic mechanisms, and mostly
lack clinical relevance or predictive/therapeutic value. The TCGA/ACRG
molecular classifications partly answer these issues but are too expensive
for routine use. Thus, a recent IHC/ISH based classification (mostly based
on TCGA data) which divides GC in five clusters has emerged, which
relies on the sequential evaluation of 4-markers: EBER-ISH, MLH1-IHC,
E-cadherin-IHC and P53-IHC. The present case would be included in
cluster-1 (EBV-associated). These tumours are frequently associated with
PD-L1 expression, as seen in our case.
Conclusion: GC stratification based on IHC/ISH is widely accessible,
reproducible, inexpensive and may represent a valuable tool in prognostic
and therapeutic decisions. Regarding our case, GC with lymphoid stroma
is a rare subtype, which is classically EBV-positive. Thus, it is often
included in the EBV-positive cluster of the proposed IHC/ISH classifica-
tion. These patients are mostly male, with poorly differentiated tumours,
located in the body and have a better prognosis. Importantly, they fre-
quently present PD-L1 and PD-L2 amplification, with potential therapeu-
tic implications.

The value of two sections on lymph nodes from patients with colo-
rectal cancer in a routine setting
S. Pouplier*, S. Lehn, A. Kanstrup Fiehn, S. Eiholm
*Department of Pathology, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde,
Denmark
Background & objectives: Staging of patients with colorectal cancer
depends on identifying an accurate number of lymph node metastases
(LNMs). This study aimed to investigate if two sections of each lymph node
would contribute to detect more metastases compared with a single section.
Methods: Surgical specimens from patients diagnosed with colorectal
adenocarcinoma in our department during a three-month period were
included. Two sections were cut from each macroscopically identified
lymph node. A resident and a pathologist evaluated all slides for presence
of LNMs and consequent staging due to one versus two sections. A third
pathologist confirmed all cases of LNMs.
Results: In total 3218 lymph nodes with two sections from 121 patients
were available. A metastasis was identified in 158 lymph nodes (4.91%).
In six of these a LNM were present in only one of the sections (3.80%).
Each of the six lymph nodes originated from six individual patients. In
two of six patients the presence of an extra LNMs was crucial for the
stage. In one patient the pN category was changed from N0 to N0(i+) and
in the other patient from pN1 to pN2.
Conclusion: The histological assessment of lymph nodes from patients
with colorectal cancer with two sections instead of a single section result-
ed in a small increase in number of detected metastases. However, the
stage was changed in two patients, which might influence the choice of
oncological treatment. A single extra HE-stained slide results in a minor
extra workload at a limited expense and is thus a feasible method in most
laboratories.

Dysplasia in Barrett’s oesophagus - immunohistochemical features
with potential prognosis value
S.M. Sabo*, G. Micu, A. Bastian, A. Voiosu, A. Cernat-Ștefan, R.
Ardeleanu, M. Maria-Alexandra, C. Popp
*Colentina University Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: In Barrett’s oesophagus (BE) normal squa-
mous mucosa is replaced by metaplastic columnar epithelium. BE pre-
disposes to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. We aimed to investigate im-
munohistochemistry features that could reinforce the diagnosis of dyspla-
sia or predict higher risk for malignancy.
Methods: Immunostaining for p53, Cyclin D1, and BCL2 was performed
on 16 biopsies showing Barrett’s oesophagus separated in two groups: 8
cases with dysplasia and 8 cases without dysplasia, paired by sex and age.
Expression was quantified in percentage of positive metaplastic mucosal
cells. In the dysplasia group positivity was measured in dysplastic tissue
and separately in non-dysplastic tissue.
Results: p53 was positive in all dysplasia cases and in just 3 non-
dysplasia cases. Cyclin D1 was positive in all 16 cases, while BCL2
was light positive in 4 cases overall. Analysing comparatively the posi-
tivity percentages between the dysplastic tissue and the surrounding meta-
plastic tissue in 7 cases from group A (in 1 case dysplastic tissue was
unfortunately depleted), we found a statistically significant (p=0.0482, t-
test) mean difference (30.14%) in p53 staining. We also tested for differ-
ences in expression grades between the two groups, first comparing only
non-dysplastic tissue and second comparing dysplastic epithelium from
group A with metaplastic epithelium from group B, but found no statis-
tically significant differences.
Conclusion: There is a significant degree of intraobserver and interob-
server variability in the diagnosis of dysplasia in BE. Because finding of
dysplasia in BE involves higher risk for malignant transformation and
more extensive follow-up, there is a need for consistent methods of diag-
nosis. p53 positivity overall is proof for "field mutation" of metaplastic
cells, while overexpression of p53 in dysplastic cells could be used for
confirmation when in doubt and as a marker of poorer prognosis.

Deeper sections reveal residual tumour cells in rectal cancer speci-
mens diagnosed with complete pathological regression following neo-
adjuvant treatment

Fiehn
*Zealand University Hospital, Denmark
Background & objectives: Guidelines and requirements for diagnosing
complete pathological regression in rectal cancer after neoadjuvant treat-
ment vary, and there is currently no consensus on best practice. We
examined the consequences of this inconsistency for diagnostic accuracy
and prognosis.
Methods: All patients diagnosed with ypT0 rectal cancer from 2015 to
2020 in our department were included (n = 23). In accordance with current
British guidelines, three additional sections were cut from each FFPE block
and stained with H&E. The distance between levels was 200 μm. Slides
were reviewed by two pathologists for presence of residual tumour cells.
Results: Additional sections revealed residual viable tumour cells in sev-
en patients (30.4 %) originally diagnosed with complete pathological
regression. Of these, three patients (42.9 %) later had local recurrence or
distant metastasis during the follow-up period, compared with two pa-
tients (12.5 %) in the group with no residual tumour cells in deeper sec-
tions (p = 0.14). In four of the seven patients with residual tumour cells,
careful examination of the original slides revealed minute foci of tumour
cells or areas suspicious for residual tumour. These areas were interpreted
as non-malignant or overlooked at the time of diagnosis. The residual
tumour was more obvious and easily recognized in the deeper sections.
Virchows Arch
Conclusion: Our results show that systematic use of deeper sections in
evaluation of tumour regression in rectal cancer reveals the presence of
residual tumour cells in a subset of patients originally diagnosed with
complete pathological regression based on a single section per FFPE
block. Furthermore, additional levels probably reduce the risk of
overlooking small foci of tumour. Our results indicate that residual tu-
mour increases the risk of recurrence, but due to the small sample size, the
result is not statistically significant.

IGF1 expression in gastrointestinal stromal tumours
I.A. Spiridon*, S.E. Giușcă, I.D. Căruntu
*"Grigore T. Popa" University of, Romania
Background & objectives: Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are
the most frequent mesenchymal digestive tumours, characterized by ac-
tivating mutation involving KIT. They present with a spectrum of biolog-
ical behaviours, from benign to malignant, but little is known about the
factors that influence these transformations.
Methods: We evaluated the immunohistochemical profile and expression
of IGF1 in 46 cases of gastric GIST from adult patients. A panel of three
markers (CD117, CD34 and DOG-1) were used for diagnosis. IGF1
expression was identified in the cytoplasm of tumour cells, displaying a
finely granular pattern, and was scored into 3 classes of intensity: nega-
tive, weak and strong.
Results: On histopathological examination, the most frequent sub-
type of GIST was spindle cell (50%), followed by the mixed and
epithelioid subtype. Most tumours were diagnosed pT2 and pT3,
with over half of them having increased mitotic activity. IGF1 was
expressed in the vast majority of cases (97.82%). Most GISTs had
uniform granular cytoplasmic expression, while some had scattered
areas of accentuated staining in the tumour cells (17.39%). Strong
IGF1 expression was correlated with larger tumour size (p<0.001),
while no statistical association with other clinicopathological factors
such as histological subtype, pleomorphism, mitotic activity, gross
characteristics or sex of the patients was observed.
Conclusion: The IGF axis plays a significant role in some malignancies,
being actively involved in carcinogenesis and cancer proliferation. Our
study highlights the increased expression of IGF1 in the tumour cells of
most GISTs, a feature suggestive of a secretory profile. Whether these
tumours are governed by an autocrine/paracrine mechanism or not, the
association with tumour size could indicate the active role of IGF1 in
tumour growth and development and possible involvement in their bio-
logical profile.

Sohaib, M. Kandil
*Pathology Department, National Liver Institute, Menoufia University,
Egypt
Background & objectives: Retinoid-related orphan receptor alpha
(RORα) is a potent tumour suppressor gene. Epithelial mesenchymal
transition(EMT) is involved in cancer invasion and metastasis. The aim
is studying the role of RORα in EMT by immunohistochemical expres-
sion of RORα &E-cadherin in gastric carcinoma(GC).
Methods: Retrospective study of 73 surgically resected GC specimens
with available corresponding adjacent non-tumour tissue and 167 cases of
chronic gastritis collected from 2015 to 2020 at the archive of pathology
department at faculty of medicine and National liver institute, Menoufia
university. Tissue microarrays were constructed, RORα and E-cadherin
immunohistochemical expression were assessed and then correlation with
clinicopathological parameters and survival.
Results: RORα showed low expression in GC compared with adjacent
non tumour and chronic gastritis(p=0.001). Low expression of RORα
was associated with diffuse type GC(p>0.001), high grade tumours
(p=0.017), positive nodal metastasis(p=0.013) and high tumour
budding(p=0.010). E-cadherin showed low expression in GC compared
with adjacent non-tumour and chronic gastritis(p>0.001). Most GC ex-
hibited heterogeneous and negative expression of E-cadherin
(69.9%&21.9%). Negative and heterogeneous expression of E-cadherin
were significantly associated with high tumour budding(p=0.021),
lymphovascular invasion(p=0.01), diffuse type GC (p=0.009) and ad-
vanced tumour pathological stage (p=0.005). RORα showed co-parallel
correlation with percent of E-cadherin membranous positivity(p=0.040).
Low RORα expression had a significant association to cancer-related
death(p=0.036) when compared with high RORα expression.
Conclusion: RORα reduction in both GC and adjacent non tumour tissue
indicate that it is a multistep carcinogenic factor. Co-parallel correlation
between RORα and E-cadherin expression suggest its role in inhibition of
epithelial mesenchymal transition in GC. RORα may be a potential ther-
apeutic target for GC by utilization of RORα agonist or activator.

Her2 testing of gastric cancer patients in Albania: results from a
retrospective study
S. Zeneli*, M. Ikonomi, B. Cela, M. Alimehmeti
*NUHC Mother Teresa, Albania
Background & objectives: Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth most com-
mon cancer in Albania. HER2-positivity rates in GC are reported with a
wide range. There is no data for it in Albania.
Methods: A total of 192 patients, with primary GCs was retrospectively
analysed for HER2 overexpression by IHC. Dual SISH, was used in only
20 GCs with equivocal results. We dispersed HER2 results by: gender
and age, histopathological diagnosis and stage, type of the specimen. The
results were compared.
Results: We examined by IHC 73.4% (141 cases) surgical and 26.5%
endoscopic biopsies: 18.4% (26 cases) and 15.7% (8 cases) HER2 3+,
respectively. HER2 overexpression (3+) was detected in 17.7% (34
cases). HER2 equivocal (2+) was detected in 24.5% (47 cases). 17.8% ,
14%, 4.7% were respectively intestinal type, diffuse, signet ring and the
rest adenocarcinoma NOS. GC prevailed in the group age of 61-70 yrs
(31.70%; ), followed by 51-60 yrs (25%), 22.9% in 71-80-yrs. 20 cases
analysed by SISH, showed Her2 amplification in 40% (8 cases).
Economical restrictions and problems with preanalytical phase made it
impossible to evaluate by SISH all 20 cases.
Conclusion: 17.7%of Albanian patients with primary GC were HER2-
positive on IHC. There is no difference in biopsy and surgical specimen
results. Economical restrictions can influence the results.

Hemida, D. Sweed
*National Liver Institute/ Menoufia University, Egypt
Background & objectives: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
is one of the most lethal malignancies. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate
the role of STIM1 in the pathogenesis of primary and metastatic PDAC.
Methods: This immunohistochemical study was carried out on 73 PDAC
cases; 48 primary cases and 25 cases of PDAC metastatic to the liver or
Virchows Arch
omentum. In addition, 23 cases from non-tumour pancreatic tissue and 10
normal pancreatic tissues as a control group were included. Tissue micro-
array (TMA) was prepared. Both epithelial and stromal STIM1 expres-
sion were evaluated in the studied groups.
Results: Both epithelial and stromal STIM1 were significantly
overexpressed in primary PDAC cases compared to the adjacent non-
tumour pancreatic tissue and normal pancreatic tissue groups (P<0.001,
for all). High epithelial STIM1 expression was significantly associated
with primary PDAC (81.3%) in comparison to metastatic group (60%)
(P=0.049). However, there was no significant difference regarding stro-
mal STIM1 expression between primary and metastatic PDAC
(P=0.113). Epithelial STIM1 was significantly associated with the pres-
ence of significant intratumoral desmoplastic stroma (P=0.036).
Conclusion: Both epithelial and stromal STIM1 may have a role in the
early development of PDAC. Targeting STIM1 may be effective in pri-
mary and metastatic PDAC patients. The significant epithelial STIM1
expression and its association with presence of desmoplastic stroma
may indicate epithelial mesenchymal transition.

Baccouch, T. Dahmoul, H. Hamchi, S. Hmissa
*Department of Pathology of Sahloul University Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN) of
the pancreas are relatively rare epithelial tumours of low-grade malignan-
cy that have no specific clinical or radiological features. Throughout this
series we aim to focus on the clinical, microscopic and immunohisto-
chemical characteristics of SPN.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective data analysis of 11 cases of
patients diagnosed with SPN in our departments between January 2009
and March 2021.
Results: 1 out of the 11patients was male. Patients' age ranged from19
to78 years with an average of 29.
4 patients complained of abdominal pain. Only 2 showed portal-
hypertension symptoms. In 2cases, SPN was an incidental discovery.
The most common location was the pancreatic body. All-but-one patient
underwent curative surgery, the remaining case was only biopsied.
Grossly, the tumours were encapsulated brownish haemorrhagic friable
nodules with an average size of 8.2cm (4–12cm). Only 4 were macro-
scopically cystic. Histologically, the common architecture alternates
pseudopapillary and solid areas. Mitotic figures were rare to absent.
Other features include cytoplasmic vacuolization(1case), hyaline
globules(4case), degenerative changes such as necrosis(2cases) and
calcifications(1case). All SPN stained with beta-catenin and CD10.
Conclusion: Familiarizing pathologists with SPN is important since com-
plete surgical excision is usually curative. The overall prognosis remains
good despite possible recurrences. When clinico-radiological signs are of
no help ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration and histopathologic
evaluation should do the deed.

Alpha-smooth muscle actin positive stromal cells relates with
stemness/cholangiocytic features in primary liver carcinomas
J. Espírito Santo*, A. Ladeirinha, A. Alarcão, L. Neves, E. Strelet, M.
Campos, M. Reis, R. Santos, L. Carvalho
*Adult Liver Transplantation Unit, Coimbra Hospital and Universitary
Centre, Portugal
Background & objectives: Alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA) expres-
sion in stroma suggests a crosstalk between epithelial and stromal cells
through epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Primary liver carcinomas
(PLCs) with stem/progenitor phenotype present worse prognosis.
Expression of ASMA/progenitor cell/cholangiocytic immunomarkers in
a series of PLCs was evaluated.
Methods: In a series of 94 epithelial malignant liver tumours, concerning
51 consecutive patients undergoing hepatic resection/liver transplantation
(2012-2016), classified according with 2019 World Health Organization
(WHO) histopathological criteria, CK7/CK19, EpCAM (BerEp4) and
ASMA immunoexpression in single or clusters of tumour cells were
searched. Eighty-six tumours were hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs);
3 were combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinomas (cHCC-CCs) and
5 were intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (iCCs).
Results: Thirty-eight HCCs expressed ASMA in stroma fusiform cells,
14 also in surrounding hepatocytes; 4 had discrete immunoexpression in
tumour cells; 22 HCCs were CK7+, 4 CK7+/CK19+,6 EpCAM +, where
3 CK7+/CK19+.
The cHCC-CCs presented ASMA positive fusiform stroma cells and 1
case showed positive peritumoral hepatocytes; 2 CK7+, 2 CK19+, 3
EpCAM+ and 2 CK7+/CK19+/EpCAM+.
In the 5 iCCs, 4 had ASMA+ stroma fusiform cells and 2 ASMA+
peritumoral hepatocytes; all cases were CK7+/CK19+ and 3
EpCAM+.
Forty-one of the 45 tumours (28 patients) showing ASMA positive fusi-
form stroma cells had F3/F4 (METAVIR score) peritumoral fibrosis. In 6
patients tumour recurred within 6 years after curative surgery.
Conclusion: Then significant association (p<0,05) was observed be-
tween tumour stroma expression for ASMA and CK7, CK19 and
EpCAM tumour cells expression. ASMA expression seems to be associ-
ated with stem/cholangiocytic cells in liver carcinomas. These prelimi-
nary results deserve interpretation for treatment definition in order to
effectively modulate the malignant epithelial/stroma cooperation, beyond
searching serological biomarkers.

Background&objectives:ChronicviralHepatitisB(CVHB)isdefinedby
chronic necrotizing and inflammatory lesions of the hepatic parenchyma.
The aim of study was to determine the abnormalities of intrahepatic
vasculature in CVHB and their correlation with inflammatory activity
and fibrosis stage.
Methods: Our study was retrospective on 30 cases of CVHB confirmed
by the pathological examination of the liver biopsy over a period of 5
years (January 2013- April 2018) in La Rabta Hospital. For activity and
fibrosis, the Metavir score was used. A statistical analysis was performed
and the significance level was set at 0.05.
Results: This study included 13 males and 17 females with CVHB.
The average age was 41 years. On histological examination, hepatitis
activity was score 1 (N=7), 2 (N=19) and 3 (N= 4). The fibrosis was
stage 1 (N= 10), 2 (N= 10) and 3 (N= 10). All cases showed vascular
lesions. They were represented by portal angiomatosis (N=23),
thrombosis of portal veins (N=7), sinusoidal dilatation (N=16), ab-
normal parenchymal draining veins (N=18), phlebosclerosis (N=14)
and aberrant portal vessels (N= 24). Analytic study showed that ac-
tivity is significantly associated with thrombosis of portal veins
(p=0.02) and there is no significant association between vascular
changes and fibrosis.
Conclusion: The vascular changes observed in chronic hepatitis involve
angiogenesis lesions.
Two mechanisms explain the development of this angiogenesis:
Virchows Arch
First, it is part of the response to inflammation and the process of scarring
that is triggered with chronic liver injury. Secondly, it is stimulated by
hypoxia associated with fibrosis.
This angiogenesis has two consequences: the aggravation of fibrosis and
the genesis of portal hypertension.
These lesions represent a sign of a progression of the disease.

*Department of Pathology and Laboratories, Fundación Santa Fe de
Bogotá/Universidad de Los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia
Background & objectives: The increasing incidence of Inflammatory
Bowel Disease (IBD) in Latin-America enables us to explore extra-
intestinal manifestations and complications of the disease. This study
aims to describe IBD patients and PSC who developed colorectal cancer
at a reference centre in Colombia.
Methods: A chart review study of patients with IBD between 1996 and
2019 at Hospital Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogota. Patients
diagnosed with PSC and colorectal cancer were reviewed and analysed.
Results: From a total of 327 patients with IBD, 16 patients with colorectal
cancer were identified. 13 had UC and 3 CD, 10 patients were female and
6 male. Mean age of diagnosis of IBD was 56.28 years old. 9 patients had
pancolitis. 11 patients (68.75%) had previous hospitalizations compared
to cancer-free patients (31.25% n=5). 4.3 % (n=14) of all patients with
IBD developed PSC and among these 14.3% developed colorectal can-
cer. Compared with patients without PSC 3.8% developed colorectal
neoplasia. A positive association between PSC and colorectal cancer
was obtained in patients with IBD (OR= 4.18, p= 0.008). Low-grade
dysplasia was found in 6/327 patients (2.2%) and one high-grade
dysplasia.
Conclusion: IBD increases the risk of PSC and colorectal cancer. These
diseases share an underlying predisposition and a PSC-IBD phenotype
has been described. This study reinforces a positive association between
PSC-IBD and the increased risk of colorectal cancer. This increased risk
is greatest with pancolitis and with higher degrees of endoscopic and
histological inflammation. Chronic inflammation with cytotoxic and car-
cinogenic effects of bile acids in the colon are proposed mechanisms.
PSC is underdiagnosed in IBD. Follow-up magnetic resonance cholangi-
ography is recommended.

Orozco-Gálvez, M. Buti, M. Riveiro-Barciela, M. Salcedo-Allende
*Pathology Department, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: Some autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) have el-
evated serum IgG4 levels, and clinical characteristics of such patients are
currently incompletely characterized. The aim of this study is to correlate
IgG4 expression in patients with AIH and overlap syndrome (OS), with
clinical data.
Methods: Retrospective single-centre study that includes 109 patients,
77% with AIH and 23% with OS. Liver biopsies were submitted for
pathological study and IgG4 and IgG immunohistochemical techniques
were performed in all cases. The presence of >10 IgG4 plasma cells per
high magnification field was considered significant. A comparison of
those biopsies with some clinical, analytical and therapeutic parameters
was performed.
Results: 61% women, average age: 51. At diagnosis, 19% presented
severe acute hepatitis, 15% liver cirrhosis, 83% ANAs ≥1/80 and 18%
ANCAs. 18% presented significant IgG4 infiltrate, 24% with OS and
17% with AIH (p=0.29) and was associated with higher age, advanced
liver disease, 32% having cirrhosis (p=0.01), and analytically with higher
IgG, lower albumin and higher ANCAs; 95% had ANAs ≥1/80 compared
to 84% among those without IgG4 infiltrate (p=0.19). Patients with sig-
nificant IgG4 infiltrate required second-line drug use less frequently (6%
vs 34%, p=0.02), but longer time to discontinuation of corticosteroid
therapy (22 vs 14 months, p=0.04). Complete response and time to com-
plete response was similar (p=0.49 and p=0.65).
Conclusion: Hepatic IgG4 significant expression in patients with
AIH and OS was associated with more advanced liver disease,
32% having cirrhosis at diagnosis. Corticosteroid tapering was
slower, although the need for second-line drug treatment was lower
in these patients. The study of IgG4 in liver biopsies of AIH and OS
may be a useful parameter to understand evolution and management
of these patients.

*Pathology Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy
Background & objectives: Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is the second most
common malignant liver tumour with high aggressiveness and mortality.
Intrahepatic and extrahepatic subtypes show different morphology,
immunophenotype and molecular alterations, which should be investigat-
ed in the routine practice for precision therapy.
Methods: We performed a retrospective analyses of the molecular
tests performed in our laboratory since July 2020 on a consecutive
series of BTCs regarding the molecular alterations that have an
impact on clinical decisions such as mutation of IDH1 and IDH2,
FGFR2 fusions, mismatch repair proteins status, NTRK, ERBB2
and BRAF (as recommended by guidelines, immunohistochemistry,
FISH and next generation sequencing).
Results: 27 patients affected by BTC were investigated after multi-
disciplinary meetings in the Liver Unit. We evaluated intrahepatic
(85%) or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (15%) on bioptic or sur-
gical material. Targetable genetic alterations were found in 13 pa-
tients (48%), all affected by intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC):
7 cases had IDH1 mutation (p.Arg132Cys, c.394C>T) and were
poorly differentiated (G3) ICC “small duct type”, 1 IDH2 mutation
(p.Arg172Gly c.514A>G) in ICC undergone neoadjuvant chemother-
apy, 3 FGFR2 fusions ICC large duct type (2/3 G3), one had loss of
PMS2 confirmed by genetic testing (and IDH1 mutation) and 2 large
duct type ICC with loss of both MLH1 and PMS2. No NTRK fusion
neither BRAF mutation were found.
Conclusion: Biliary tract cancer has recently gained attention thanks to
targetable molecular alterations allowing for personalization of therapies
in clinical practice. The detection of these alterations is routinely per-
formed and is highly reliable both on bioptic and surgical material. The
significant incidence of these alterations in our routine practice strongly
support the real need of searching for them in clinical practice to establish
the correct therapy for our patients and deeply understand the complex
biology of biliary tract cancers.

Background & objectives: Malignant neoplasm of the gallbladder is
uncommon with a poor long-term survival. Our aim is to identify
the clinicopathological prognostic factors for survival in patients
with Gallbladder cancer (GBC) submitted to surgery in our insti-
tution – a tertiary centre.
Methods: Forty-one patients underwent surgical treatment for GBC be-
tween 2008-2019 at our centre. The majority of the tumours (85.4%) were
gallbladder adenocarcinomas; 41.5% of GBC were diagnosed incidental-
ly, 65.9% of the patients had symptoms and 26.8% presented with acute
cholecystitis. 46.3% of patients were stage III (AJCC) or higher. Analysis
was conducted using SPSS.
Results: Median follow-up was 20.5 months (IQR 8.8-53.8) and median
overall survival (OS) was 23 months. 3-year and 5-year survival rates
were of 43.2% and 39.6%, respectively. On immunohistochemistry anal-
ysis, 6 patients (14.6%) were HER2+, but the HER2 status did not show
influence on OS (median OS 18 vs 20 months, p=0.649); all had micro-
satellite stability. There was no association between HER2 expression
and staging (p=0.35).
Conclusion: This study on GBC is, as far as the authors know, the first in
Portugal. Surgery is still the gold standard for curative treatment and some
patients with favourable prognosis may be identified. The over expression
of HER2 could select patients for targeted treatment and prompt tissue
sampling in unresectable patients.

Clinicopathological study on morphological subtypes of
hepatocellular carcinoma: a single-institution experience

Damink, A. zur Hausen, M. Kramer, I. Samarska
*Department of Pathology and Internal Medicine, GROW-School for
Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University Medical
Center+, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: The WHO 2019 recognized several morpho-
logic subtypes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with different patho-
logical features, immune profiles, and clinical relevance of diagnosis. We
aimed to analyse HCC subtypes in our population and assess the histo-
logical parameters.
Methods: The resection specimens of 56 cases, received between 2007
and 2021 at the Maastricht University Medical Center+, were revised
according to the current WHO 2019 classification and the ICCR guide-
lines. The data on age, sex, surgical specimen, morphological subtypes,
tumour grade, growth pattern, tumour extension, margins, vascular and
perineural invasion, regional lymph nodes and distant metastasis were
collected.
Results: 56 resection specimens from 20 women and 36 men with
the median age of 64 years [range 26 to 88 years] were obtained.
The two most common morphologic subtypes were steatohepatitic
and clear cell HCC. However, 36 cases (64.3%) demonstrated mul-
tiple morphological patterns. One tumour (1.7%) revealed a promi-
nent lymphocytic infiltrate, suggestive of a lymphocyte-rich HCC.
The syncytial cell-like giant cells were found in 15 cases, usually in
less than 5% of the total tumour volume. The solid growth pattern
was most common, yet we often observed concurrent heterogeneous
growth patterns. Forty cases (71.4%) showed satellitosis. Perineural
growth was an infrequent feature, identified only in two cases
(3.5%).
Conclusion: While steatohepatitic and clear cell HCC were the most
common morphologic subtypes, the majority of cases demonstrated mul-
tiple morphological patterns and heterogeneous growth patterns. Clear
diagnostic criteria for the different morphological subtypes are necessary
for tumours with heterogeneous morphology. Precise subclassification of
HCC, particularly in cases with distinct morphologies and diverse tumour
growth patterns, may facilitate an accurate prognostication, follow-up and
treatment.

Role of CD44/RhoA in the regulation of oncogenic YAP in hepatic
carcinogenesis

*Internal Medicine II, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universität
München, Germany
Background & objectives: Activation of oncogenic YAP is an early
event in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it remains unclear
how YAP is activated in HCC. Several mechanisms, including control by
Hippo signalling, beta-catenin signalling, or a CD44/RhoA- dependent
pathway have been described.
Methods: YAP and CD44 expression were assessed by histopathology in
human and mouse HCC. Human HCC cell lines HepG2, HuH7 and
Mahalavu were treated with the CD44 antibody IM7 and Rho inhibitor
rhosin. Treatment was evaluated via MTT proliferation assay. Protein and
mRNA expression were quantified by western blot, immunofluorescence
staining and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively.
Results: Immunohistochemistry staining in mouse and human HCC
showed a correlation of the expression of CD44_v6 and active, nuclear
YAP. Additionally, the expression of YAP target genes correlated with
the expression of CD44 by mRNA in mouse and human HCC. While the
CD44 antibody IM7 didn´t exert any effect on cell proliferation, rhosin –
an inhibitor of downstream RhoA – decreased the proliferation in HCC
cell lines significantly. By western blot, only slightly reduced YAP and P-
YAP protein levels were observed, but immunofluorescence staining of
HepG2 and Mahalavu demonstrated a significant increase in inactive,
cytoplasmic YAP upon Rhosin treatment. In HepG2 cells, rhosin treat-
ment decreased the expression of YAP target genes.
Conclusion: Correlation of YAP and CD44 staining in human and mouse
HCC indicates that a previously described CD44/RhoA axis could regu-
late the activation of oncogenic YAP in HCC. Inhibition of RhoA in
human hepatoma cells reduced proliferation and correlated with inactiva-
tion of YAP. If targeting of RhoA could therefore present a promising
treatment strategy in human hepatocellular carcinoma is subject to further
investigation.

*Department of Pathology, National Liver Institute, Menoufia
University, Egypt
Background & objectives: Angiogenesis participates in cancer patho-
genesis and metastasis. Endothelial-cell-specific molecule-1 (ESM-1) is
overexpressed in tumour endothelial cells in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). This study aimed to investigate ESM1 as a marker of tumour
recurrence in patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC.
Methods: This retrospective study included 52 patients who had under-
gone liver transplantation for HCC during period from March 2010 to
March 2021. Clinical, laboratory and histopathological data were collect-
ed from medical records of Pathology Department, National Liver
Institute, Menoufia University. Sections from tumour and non-tumour
liver tissue were prepared for Immunohistochemical staining with
ESM1 antibody.
Results: In the present study, 34.6% of HCC cases showed positive
ESM1 expression in tumour, while all non-tumorous tissue showed neg-
ative ESM1 expression. Most cases (71.4%) with HCC recurrence were
positive for ESM1 expression. ESM1 expression was significantly asso-
ciated with age ≥55 years. Univariate analysis showed that ESM1 pos-
itivity (p= 0.043), Alpha-fetoprotein (p=0.021), tumour size ≥3cm
(p=0.001), advanced tumour pathologic staging (p=0.002) and
Virchows Arch
microscopic lymphovascular invasion (p=0.019) were significantly asso-
ciated with tumour recurrence after liver transplantation for HCC. Value
of ESM1 expression as a predictor of HCC recurrence after liver trans-
plantation was evaluated and showed 71.43% sensitivity, 71.11% speci-
ficity, 27.78% positive predictive value, 94.12% negative predictive val-
ue and 71.15% accuracy.
Conclusion: Immunohistochemical expression of ESM1 could be used
as a marker of poor prognosis that predicts tumour recurrence in patients
planning for liver transplantation in HCC cases. ESM1 might be used to
predict outcomes in patients with HCC diagnosed through percutaneous
biopsy or hepatic resection.

Injuries associated with papillary carcinoma in thyroid surgical
parts in the department of pathology of the federal university of
Ceará, Brazil, in the period from July 2016 to December 2020
P. Aguiar*, T.N. Albuquerque Gomes Nogueira, J. Souza, A. Lobo
Ramos, G. Holanda Maia, G. Carvalho
*Federal University of Ceará, Brazil
Background & objectives: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the
most common malignancy of the thyroid. The verification of coexistence
with associated findings is important for the monitoring and prognosis.
The article aims evaluate the association between coexisting lesions in
patients diagnosed with PTC.
Methods: Realized through the analysis of an institutional historical se-
ries involving all cases submitted to partial or total thyroidectomy for
papillary carcinoma, performed in the department of pathology of the
federal university of Ceará, Brazil, in the period from July 2016 to
December 2020.
Results: A total of 110 patients were included in the study, with 69 (63%)
associated with some finding, the most common being: lymphocytic thy-
roiditis (17%) and follicular adenoma (17%), in addition, 32% of patients
had more than one finding. We observed a preponderance of women,
representing a total of 101 (92%) among the cases, with a mean age of
55.2 years. Of the total, 2 (2%) patients had perineural invasion, 15 (16%)
angiolymphatic invasion and 24.2 (22%) extraglandular extension.
Regarding anatomopathological staging, 54% of pT1 cases, 14% pT2,
21% pT3 and 3% pT4.
Conclusion: In literature are few studies that analyse the presence of
lesions associated with PTC and its implications. In our study, 65% of
the cases of PTC were associated with one or more findings and their
presence was associated with the presentation of disease at an earlier
stage. It is possible that the search for medical treatment in the face of
benign thyroid lesions favoured the finding of PTC at an earlier stage and
influenced the prognosis and recurrence.

Predictive Factors of Lymph Node Metastasis in Thyroid Papillary
carcinoma
M. Ben Thayer*, F. Khanchel, I. Helal, W. Hizem, A. Hmidi, E. Ben
Brahim, R. Jouini, A. Chadli-Debbiche
*Department of Pathology, Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is asso-
ciated to lymph node metastases (LNM), in up to30 to 80%. However,
pathological predictors of LNM have yet to be established.
We aim to determine clinicopathological predictive factors for LNM in
PTC.
Methods: We retrospectively analysed 81 patients who were diag-
nosed with PTC in the Department of pathology of Habib
Thameur's Hospital between January 2016 and December 2020.
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to analyse
the correlation between clinicopathological characteristics and the
LLNM of PTC.
Results: A total of 81 patients was included. They were 11 men and 70
women, with a mean age of 42,8±12,6 years. Thyroidectomy and
loboisthmectomy were performed in 70 and 11 patients respectively.
Mean tumour size was> 2cm in 38 patients. The tumour was in the lower
third in 24 cases. Vascular invasions were diagnosed in 20 cases and cap-
sular effraction in 35 cases. Perithyroid involvement was noted in
14cases.The mean number of nodes dissected was 11,5. In 43 cases the
number of nodes dissected was>5. Correlation between lymph node status
and different clinico-pathological predictives revealed a statistically signif-
icant correlation with number of nodes dissected>5 (p=0,004). There was
not statistically signification correlation with the other predictive factors.
Conclusion: Management of lymph node dissection in PTC is still
controversial. The factors that predict LNM in PTC are important for
treatment assessment. The results of this study identified only one
statistically significant independent predictive factor for LNM in
PTC: number of lymph nodes dissected. Therefore, lymph node dis-
section should be as complete and exhaustive as possible in case of
PTC. However, the morbidity of thyroid surgery is increased when
neck dissection is performed.

Temporal changes in the epidemiological profile
of well-differentiated follicular cell-derived thyroid
carcinomas in our institution over a 15-year period:
a retrospective, transversal study of 722 cases
A. Borda*, A. Zahan, N. Berger, A. Nechifor-Boilă
*Department of Histology, George Emil Palade University of Medicine,
Pharmacy, Science and Technology of Târgu-Mureș, Romania
Background & objectives: Our study aimed to document the time trend
evolution of papillary (PTC) and follicular (FTC) thyroid carcinomas in
our institution over a 15-year period and to assess the impact of 2017
WHO classification of thyroid tumours on their epidemiological
tendency.
Methods: All PTCs and FTCs registered in our department between 2001
and 2015 were re-evaluated. The histological diagnosis was established
according to both 2004 and 2017 WHO diagnostic criteria. Non-invasive
encapsulated follicular variant of PTCs were reclassified as NIFTPs (non-
invasive follicular thyroid neoplasms with papillary-like nuclear fea-
tures). Tumours’ time trend evolution (according to 2004/2017 WHO
classifications) was analysed and compared.
Results: Our study included 701 PTCs and 21 FTCs. Irrespective of
whether the WHO 2017 or 2004 diagnostic criteria were applied, we
noticed a statistically significant increasing annual rate of PTC (from
81.6% in 2001-2003 to 97.8% in 2013-2015, p=0.001 and from 85.7%
in 2001-2003 to 98.2% in 2013-2015, p=0.001, respectively). However,
application of 2017 WHO diagnostic criteria (excluding NIFTP from the
PTCs) resulted in a significant decrease of follicular variant of PTC cases
(n=190/701, versus n=65/701, dif. 17.82%, IC: 13.7-21.8%, p< 0.0001).
FTCs revealed a significant decreasing trend in the annual rate only at the
beginning of the study period (from 14.3% in 2001-2003 to 1.8% in
2013-2015, p<0.0001).
Conclusion: Our data revealed a significant increasing trend of PTCs
treated in our institution over a 15-years period, irrespective of whether
the WHO 2017 or 2004 diagnostic criteria were applied. However, the
introduction of the NIFTP category resulted in a significant reduction in
the number of PTCs. FTC remains rare.

Predicting biological behavior of parathyroid neoplasms by morpho-
logical and immunohistochemical features
M. Bugdayci Uner*, H. Uner, MD, C. Sokmensuer, MD
*Department of Pathology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Parathyroid neoplasms show a wide spec-
trum of morphology (adenoma-carcinoma), which is difficult to predict
biological behaviour by histomorphology. The aim of this study is to
evaluate morphological and immunohistochemical predictors of biologi-
cal behaviour of parathyroid neoplasms in a wide study-set.
Methods: We re-evaluated 888 parathyroidectomy specimens between
2000-2020. We re-evaluated the H&E slides of recurrent and atypical
adenomas besides the carcinomas, using morphological criteria such as
mitotic activity, necrosis, fibrous bands, growth pattern, perineural/vas-
cular/capsular invasion, and metastasis. We also reassessed recurrent
cases (first and the second biopsy). Then we correlated the morphological
data with the follow-up data to predict biological behaviour.
Results: In 20 years’ time, 656 cases were reported as parathyroid ade-
nomas (F/M: 509/147, avg. 53,2 yrs) including 7 recurrent adenomas
(avg. 41,3 yrs), 22 atypical adenomas (F/M: 10/12 and avg. 52,7 yrs),
one of which was recurrent, and 12 of the adenomas were located ectop-
ically (9 intra/juxta-thymic and 3 intra-thyroidal). There was 15 carcino-
mas (F/M: 5/10, avg. 47 yrs), two of which were recurrent, revealing ki-
67 in a range of 1%-10%, in the contrary ki-67 was up to 30% in atypical
adenomas. Both neoplasms revealed fibrous bands and variable mitotic
activity but only carcinomas showed lymphovascular & capsular invasion
besides higher p53 expression.
Conclusion: Parathyroid neoplasms are a difficult group of neuroendo-
crine tumours because markers such as ki-67 and morphological findings
such as fibrous bands, growth patterns and mitotic activity are not always
helpful to predict the biological behaviour or to distinguish an adenoma
from a carcinoma. However, known immunohistochemical markers ,such
as p53, may help more to the pathologist as well as the other markers
(cyclin D1, p27 etc) and clinical & radiological correlation of the case.

Carcinomas of the thyroid with Ewing family tumour element
(CEFTEs): a case report

Ghuzlan
*Institut Gustave Roussy, Département de Biologie et Pathologie
Médicales, Villejuif, France; Universitatea de Medicina si Farmacie
"Grigore T.Popa",Iasi, Romania
Background & objectives: Few cases of “Carcinoma of the Thyroid
with Ewing Family Tumour Element (CEFTEs)” were reported recently,
as a small-cell, non-neuroendocrine thyroid tumour displaying expression
of p63, CD99 and cytokeratins associating a ESWR1-FLI1 rearrange-
ment. Thyroglobulin and Calcitonin are typically negative.
Methods: We present the case of a 75-year-old female, who had a history of
mucinous lung adenocarcinoma and presented with a large infiltrative thyroid
mass associating pulmonary and cervical lesions. Total thyroidectomy with
lymph node dissection was performed and chemotherapy was started for
suspicion of lung adenocarcinoma relapse. Histological examination with
subsequent immunohistochemical and molecular studies were realised.
Results: The tumour has a solid architecture with a very focal follicular
pattern without papillary nuclear features. Tumour cells exhibited loss of
follicular markers such as TTF1 and TG (except for a few zones), were
negative for Calcitonin and CEA as well as neuroendocrine markers. P63
and CD99 expression was strong and diffuse. Ki67 was overall low with
an average of 5%. Lymph node metastases showed very focal expression
of CT and CGA. Molecular study showed a rearrangement of the ESWR1
gene with a ESWR1-FLI1 fusion transcript and no Ret mutation was
found. The diagnosis of CEFTE was proposed. The patient was stable
under simple surveillance after 56 months of follow-up.
Conclusion: We report a case of CEFTE which is a rare and newly
described entity. It is believed to arise from either solid cell nests or a
pre-existing papillary thyroid carcinoma. Since they present a small cell
cytology and ESWR1 rearrangement, the distinction from a typical
Ewing tumour is challenging. Most studies describe this entity as having
a good prognosis, as was the case for our patient, and, unlike our case,
occurring in young patients.

Primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia in a familial
cluster with a novel ARMC5 mutation
D. Doutel*, D. Cavaco, F. Santos, R. Cabrera
*Instituto Português de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Portugal
Background & objectives: Primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hy-
perplasia (PBMAH) is a rare cause of Cushing syndrome (CS). ARMC5
is the most frequently mutated gene in PBMAH. We report the clinico-
pathologic features of two cases within a familial cluster with a novel
ARMC5 mutation.
Methods: A 58-year-old man with CS and bilateral nodular formations of
the adrenal gland was diagnosed with PBMAH. ARMC5 sequencing
analysis was performed and he underwent bilateral adrenalectomy. His
31-year-old son had mild CS symptoms and unilateral increase in volume
and nodularity of the adrenal gland. He was found to have the same
genetic alteration and was submitted to unilateral adrenalectomy.
Results: The adrenal gland was multinodular in both cases, the largest
nodule measured 28 mm in the son and 25 mm in the father.
Histologically, the nodules were mainly comprised of fasciculata zone-
like cells, with varied degrees of lipid depletion. The permeated adrenal
cortex was scarce and atrophic. ARMC5 sequencing analysis revealed a
heterozygous mutation c.152G>T(p.Gly152) on exon 1 in both cases.
After surgery, there was an improvement in metabolic control, blood
pressure, proximal muscle strength and weight loss in both patients.
Conclusion: Mutations associated with ARMC5 and PBMAH are still
being discovered. In patients presenting with CS and multinodular adre-
nal glands with macronodules, it is important to be aware of PBMAH,
and test for it, even in cases with unilateral enlargement of the gland and
indolent clinical behaviour, as in the son’s case. Also, unilateral adrenal-
ectomy may be effective, at least initially, in patients with mild PBMAH.

Can histomorphological features predict lymph node metastasis in
papillary thyroid microcarcinoma?
M. Gündüz*, I. Urla Gündüz, N. Gül, İ.C. Sormaz, N. Aksakal, Z.G.
Özkan, S. Önder, G. Yegen
*Department of Pathology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul
University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMC),
despite their favourable outcome, metastasise to lymph nodes occasion-
ally. Our purpose is to define histomorphological features that are asso-
ciated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) in PTMCs.
Methods: 248 cases, diagnosed as unicentric PTMC, that have at least 2
years follow up or that were metastatic at the time of diagnosis, were
reviewed. Age, gender, tumour diameter, tumour borders, histologic sub-
type, nuclear score, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, desmoplasia,
psammoma bodies, presence of papillary structures, capsule, lymphatic,
vascular and perineural invasion status were noted.
Results: Mean follow up time was 79 months (18-155 months). Among
248 cases, 20 cases (8,1%) had LNM, of which 2 also had distant metas-
tases (to the mediastinal lymph node). In univariate analysis, LNM was
significantly more frequent in males, under the age of 50, and in tumours
that are >7 mm and classical type, also in tumours that have lymphatic
Virchows Arch
invasion, nuclear score 3, psammoma bodies, papillary structures and
infiltrative borders (p<0,01). Presence of desmoplasia was also correlated
with LNM (p<0,05). Other features evaluated were not relevant with
LNM. Lymphatic invasion and male gender were found to be indepen-
dent variables in multivariate analysis.
Conclusion: Despite their favourable outcome, PMCs metastasise to
lymph nodes occasionally. Lymphatic invasion and male gender were
found to be independent predictors of LNM. Besides, patients harbouring
high risk histology such as classical type histology, high nuclear score,
infiltrative tumour borders, desmoplasia and psammoma bodies should
be carefully followed-up.

Features of Oct4 expression in neuroendocrine tumours of different
types
L. Gurevich*, E. Bondarenko, O. Vasyukova, L. Mikhaleva
*RPOD Human Health, Russia
Background & objectives: The transcription factor Oct4 plays a decisive
role in embryogenesis, as well as in the survival of tumour cells of poorly
differentiated tumours, which is the reason for their progression and re-
sistance to chemotherapy.
Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to study 85 NET: lung -21 (3
typical, TC, 6 atypical, ATC, carcinoids, 7 SC-NEC, 3 LC-NEC), 6
thymus (ATK - 5, LC-NEC -1), 18 stomach, 17 intestines (10 small,
G1, 4 intestine, 3 rectum, G1), 23 pancreas, 3 Merkel carcinomas. The
expression of Oct4 in the cytoplasm of cells was assessed in points (0-3+).
Results: Of 64 low grade NETs of all localizations, expression was de-
tected in 62.5% (40/64), in 100% NET in the stomach and small intestine.
From 21 NEC to 1 LC-NEC stomach. The most intense expression (3+),
was characteristic of NET small intestine and stomach (90%, 92.3%), and
in 2 ACTH-positive ATCs of the thymus. Moderate expression of Oct4
(2+) was detected in 19.8% NET: 50% ATC lung, 39,1% NET pancreas,
2 NET small intestine and stomach. Oct4 expression was absent in all
NEC lung, stomach (except 1 LC-NEC), large intestine, Merkel carcino-
mas, NET rectum, 35,8% (5/13) TC/ATC lung/thymus, 60,9.8% (14/23)
NET pancreas.
Conclusion: ECL-cell NETs of the stomach and small intestine are char-
acterized by intense cytoplasmic expression of Oct4, which can be used
as an additional diagnostic and prognostic criterion, as well as a cellular
target for the development of new approaches to their treatment.

Brahim, R. Jouini, A. Chadli-Debbiche
*Habib Thameur's Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The Thyroid Imaging-Reporting And
Database System (TI-RADS) classification is sensitive but not very spe-
cific, leading sometimes to abusive cytological and histological explora-
tions. Our study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the TI-
RADS classification by reference to histological results.
Methods: A cross-sectional, retrospective and descriptive study was con-
ducted at Pathology department of Habib Thameur Hospital between
January 2016 and December 2017. The nodules were classified according
to the TI-RADS. The diagnostic value of this score by reference to his-
tology data was evaluated by calculating sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp),
positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV).
Results: Eighty-one nodules have been identified. The mean age was
46,7 years and the sex ratio (M/F) was 0.07. Fifty nodules were classified
as suspect (TI-RADS IV and V) and 31 non-suspect (TI-RADS I, II and
III). The histological study revealed 56 benign lesions and 25 carcinomas
which 96% were papillary carcinomas. Statistical analysis of these results
showed a significant relationship between TI-RADS classification and
histological data with a Se of 88%, a Sp of 48,21%, a NPV of 9,7%
and a VPN of 98%.
Conclusion: Our study confirmed the good sensitivity of the TI-RADS
system (88%) with excellent VPN (98%). However, its low specificity
(48,21%) prompted us to propose the generalization of other evaluation
systems (EU-TIRADS and ACR TI-RADS) with a simpler and more
precise notation, allowing better management of thyroid nodules.

Cribriform-morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma– a case
series
N. Mittal*, S. Rane, M. Bal, A. Patil
*Tata Memorial Center, Homi Bhabha National University, India
Background & objectives: Cribriform-morular variant of papillary thy-
roid carcinoma (CMV-PTC) is among the rarest of all variants of
Papillary thyroid carcinoma(PTC). Distinct female predominance and
association with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) characterize this
unique variant of PTC.
Methods: Retrospective clinic-pathological review of nine cases of
CMV-PTC diagnosed over a period of 5 years (2017-2021) was under-
taken. The clinical findings were recorded from the electronic record
system, and imaging details were obtained from the picture archiving
and communication system (PACS). There were 8 women, and one male
patient. The mean age was 27.7 years (age range;16-38 years).
Results: Multifocality in 22.2%, Left lobe involvement in 77.8%, size
range of 2.8-7.5cm, and clinically negative nodes in all were the most
notable clinic-radiological findings. All cases, on histology, resembled
columnar cell variant of PTC. Solid areas in 22.2%, non-squamous
morules in 55.6% cases(highlighted by Bcl2 and CD10), mitosis >5/
10hpf in 11.1%, microscopic extrathyroidal extension in 22.2%, lack of
necrosis or nodal metastases were other salient findings.
Immunohistochemistry showed diffuse nuclear positivity for Beta-caten-
in(100%), ER, PR, and TTF1. Endoscopy revealed asymptomatic colonic
polyposis in 3 patients (including the male patient), which on histology
were tubular adenomas indicating associated FAP. All patients are alive
without disease at last follow-up (range: 3-48 months).
Conclusion: CMV-PTC is rare and underdiagnosed; 4 out of 9 cases with
an outside histology were misdiagnosed as classical PTC, and not CMV-
PTC. Lack of morules in all cases, and rarity and lack of awareness
especially occurrence in male gender being possible causes. CMV-PTC
preceded FAP in all our cases, and as early detection and treatment of
FAP is life-saving; the importance of recognizing CMV-PTC cannot be
overemphasized.

Clinico-pathological and molecular characterization of 9 cases of tall
cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma
A. Nechifor-Boila*, A. Zahan, C. Bănescu, A. Borda
*Department of Histology, UMFST Târgu Mureş, Romania
Background & objectives: Tall cell variant of papillary thyroid carcino-
ma (TCPTC) is a rare, but more aggressive variant of PTC. We aimed to
investigate the clinico-pathological and molecular characteristics of 9
cases of TCPTC registered in our Department over an 8-years period.
Methods: All PTC cases registered in our department between 2008-
2015 were reviewed. Nine cases of TCPTC with available follow-up data
and well-preserved formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded tumour blocks
for molecular analysis were identified and included in the study. All
TCPTCs were subjected to RT-PCR amplification targeting the
BRAFV600E and RAS (KRAS, NRAS, HRAS) somatic mutations.
Results: The mean age of the patients was 52.48±14.84 years-old; all but
one were females. The mean tumour size was 24.95±11.34 mm and 3
cases were multifocal. Extrathyroidal extension, with tumour invasion
into the strap muscles of the neck was documented in 5 cases. Lymph
Virchows Arch
node dissection was performed in 4 cases; of these, three displayed lymph
node involvement. All patients were treated by total thyroidectomy and
received radioactive iodine therapy. During the follow-up period, one
case (staged pT1bN1) developed lung metastasis 65 months after the
initial diagnosis. With regard to the molecular profile, six (66.7%)
TCPTCs were BRAFV600E positive, whereas none of the cases was
associated with RAS mutations.
Conclusion: Tall cell histology represents a poor prognostic factor in
PTCs. Our results emphasize the importance of recognizing and reporting
TCPTC because of its more pejorative prognosis, with an increased risk
of local invasion, lymph node and distant metastasis, as well as high
frequency of BRAFV600E mutation.

A rare parathyroid neoplasm as a mimic of hyperplastic goitre: a
case report
T. Oliveira*, I. Alves
*Department of Pathology, Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN, Portugal
Background & objectives: Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare tumour with
a typical clinical presentation of parathyroid hormone excess signs and
hypercalcemia, but may rarely be indolent, producing only mass effect
symptoms. Herein, we present a non-functioning parathyroid carcinoma
case mimicking a hyperplastic goitre.
Methods: A 55-year-old woman with a diagnosis of hyperplastic goitre 8
years prior, revealed a slowly expanding neck mass that had recently
induced dysphagia. Biochemical analysis revealed normal serum calcium
and parathyroid hormone levels; anti–thyroid peroxidase and anti-
thyroglobulin antibodies were both negative. Nonetheless, the fine-
needle biopsy of the mass suggested a lymphocytic thyroiditis and a
thyroidectomy was performed.
Results: Grossly, the thyroidectomy specimen weighted 148 g and was
almost totally replaced by a multinodular tumour with 12 cm in largest
axis, with a tan cross-section and focal haemorrhage. Histologically, the
tumour showed a solid nodular pattern, subdivided by broad fibrous
bands and was composed of mildly pleomorphic chief cells with round
to ovoid nuclei, some with dense chromatin and prominent nucleoli.
There was capsule invasion and angioinvasion. These cells demonstrated
immunoreactivity for cytokeratins 8/18, chromogranin-A and parathyroid
hormone (multifocal) and negativity for calcitonin, thyroglobulin and
TTF-1. The tumour was diagnosed as a parathyroid carcinoma, clinically
non-functioning, stage pT2.
Conclusion: Rarely, parathyroid carcinoma may present as a non-
functioning cervical mass and remain clinically unsuspected, making it a
diagnostic challenge by mimicking thyroid carcinomas or hyperplastic goi-
tre, as our case was. Save for a surgery-related left vocal cord paralysis, the
patient remains disease-free 11 months after the surgery, maintaining close
follow-up without current need for further oncologic treatment.

Anaplastic thyroid cancer: PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in a series of
13 cases

Petit, X. Matias-Guiu
*Department of Pathology, Bellvitge University Hospital, IDIBELL,
Spain
Background & objectives: Immunotherapy targeting the programmed
cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor and its cognate ligand (PD-L1) have shown
promising results in several tumours. Our objective is to evaluate the
expression of PD1 and PD-L1 in a series of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas
(ATC).
Methods: PD1 (Cell Marque-NAT105) and PD-L1 (Ventana-SP142 and
DAKO-22C3) immunohistochemical expression was assessed in 13
ATC. PD-1 staining was evaluated in inflammatory cells and PD-L1 in
tumour cells and categorized according to the percentage of positive cells
into: negative <1%, focal 1-25%, moderate 25-50%, diffuse >50%. The
staining pattern (membranous, cytoplasmic and both) was also recorded
in tumour cells.
Results: PD1 stained inflammatory cells in 9 cases (69%): 8 cases (89%)
focally and 1 case (11%) diffusely. Membranous expression in tumour
cells with PD-L1 (DAKO) was found in 11 cases (85%): 2 (18%) focally,
1 (9%) moderately and 8 (73%) diffusely. Conversely, PD-L1 (Ventana)
staining in tumour cells was evidenced in 7 cases (54%): 6 cases (86%)
focally and 1 case (14%) diffusely. Cytoplasmic stain was observed in 2
cases (28,5%), membranous in 2 cases (28,5%) and both in 3 cases
(43%).
Conclusion: In our series a subset of ATC cases showed expression for
PD-1 and PD-L1 in inflammatory and tumour cells respectively. The
percentage of cases with tumour cell expression of PD-L1 differs among
both clones. DAKO stained 85% of cases, most of them diffusely whereas
Ventana 54% of cases with a predominant focal positivity. Finally, treat-
ment options are lacking for ATC. Therefore, the use of PD1 and PD-L1
immunostaining as potential biomarker for immunotherapy in ATC de-
serve further research.

Participation of proteins (Hsp90α) in the adaptive rearrangement of
the pituitary-adrenal system of rats after long-term exposure to
heavy metal salts

Brusovtsov, N. Hyriavenko, A. Romaniuk*
*Sumy State University, Ukraine
Background & objectives: Pituitary-adrenal system takes an active part
in regulating the body's adaptive capacity under the influence of exoge-
nous factors. The morphological and immunohistochemical features of
pituitary endocrinocytes and adrenal cortex under the adaptation to long-
term exposure to heavy metals were studied.
Methods: The experiment was performed on 48 rats aged 5-6 months (2
control and 2 experimental groups). Experimental group animals received
a combination of heavy metal salts: zinc/copper/iron/manganese/lead/
chromium. Determination of heat shock protein marker 90 (Hsp90α)
expression was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Hsp90α
protein. The result was expressed as a percentage and evaluated on an
accepted scale.
Results: Adaptive changes in the adenohypophyseal-adrenal system were
characterized by an increase in the level of Hsp90α expression in the
cytoplasm of 72-81% of adenohypophysis cells to moderate (2 points)
and strongly positive (3 points) levels. Particularly high levels of expres-
sion to Hsp90α were found in the cytoplasm of cells located
paravascularly. In contrast to the central link, in the adrenal cortex the
areactivity of both the cytoplasm and the nuclei of corticocytes of all zones
to Hsp90α has been established. In the glomerular and reticular zones, a
moderately positive level of Hsp90α expression was found in vascular
endotheliocytes, with special expression in the cortex's glomerular zone.
Conclusion: The pituitary gland showed a high level of expression to
Hsp90α, which indicated a fairly high level of general restorative mech-
anisms of antistress protection. The reactivity of corticocytes of all adre-
nal zones to Hsp90α revealed a significant weakening of antiapoptotic
and antistress protection in glandulocytes, weakening of control in cells
regarding folding processes. Therefore, a 30-day adaptation period to a
90-day exposure to a combination of heavy metal salts is insufficient to
fully restore homeostasis in the pituitary-adrenal system.

Neuroendocrine neoplasia – relevant and interesting topics – a case-
report and literature review
M. Souto Moura*, A. Varelas, M. Jácome
*Department of Pathology, IPO-Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are het-
erogeneous and ubiquitous. Globally their nomenclature is inconsistent
and biological behaviour may be confusing.
Different treatment options can reduce grade and tumour load.
We aim to report a case and review the literature emphasizing these
issues.
Methods: A 29-year-old woman was referred to our Institution (Feb/
2019) after a Grade 2 (Ki-67: 4.6%) Neuroendocrine tumour (NET) he-
patic metastasis was diagnosed. 68Ga-DOTA-NOC-PET revealed multi-
ple foci of somatostatin receptor overexpression consistent with stage IV
disease originating in the terminal ileum. Somatostatin analogues (SSAs)
and shortly after lutetium-177 therapy were started. Re-evaluation
showed a partial imagiologic response and surgical treatment was
decided.
Results: Terminal ileocolectomy, hepatic metastasectomies and peritone-
al implants removal was performed.
Ileocolectomy revealed a well-differentiated NET, Grade 1, based on the
findings of less than 2 mitoses/2mm2 and a Ki-67 labelling of less than
3%, with lymphovascular and extensive perineural invasion. Liver and
peritoneal specimens revealed metastasis of the neoplasia just described.
Thereby, a downgrade of the tumour was verified, assumed to be related
with the neoadjuvant therapy used.
Conclusion: Our case showed that even a well-differentiated NET can
behave very aggressively. In particular, small intestine NETs often pres-
ent with stage IV disease.
The 2018 WHO/IARC expert consensus proposal for NENs classification
may reduce the inconsistencies and confusions across these neoplasms.
Several trials revealed an effect of SSAs and lutetium-177 (specially in
combination) on tumour cell proliferation in somatostatin receptor-
positive advanced NETs, enabling surgery, as in our case. Pathologists
must be aware of the possibility of tumour downgrading following these
therapies.

“Plump pink” cells: an important morphological feature predictive
of high-risk papillary thyroid microcarcinomas
E. Szasz*, A. Nechifor-Boilă, A. Borda
*Department of Histology, George Emil Palade University of Medicine,
Pharmacy, Sciences and Technology of Târgu-Mureş, Romania
Background & objectives: In this study we aimed to investigate the
importance of reporting high-risk morphological features, such as the
presence of “plump pink” cells (PPCs), in a series of papillary thyroid
microcarcinoma (PTMC) cases.
Methods: We re-analysed all consecutive PTMC cases, registered at the
Department of Pathology, Târgu-Mureş Emergency County Hospital
from 2003 to 2014. The following morphological features were noted,
apart from the presence of PPC: tumour size, histological variant, tumour
borders, stromal reaction, calcifications and intratumoral multinucleated
giant cells. We also quantified the PPC component as diffuse (up to
≥20%) or focal (<20%).
Results: Our study included 206 PTMCs of which, 91 were ≥5mm and
115 <5mm PTMC. Polygonal, PPCs, characterized by abundant eosino-
philic cytoplasm were found in 48/206 PTMCs, of which 34 presented a
diffuse pattern and 14 focal plump cell component. The diffuse pattern
was seen rather in large (≥5mm) (p=0.002) than in small (<5mm) PTMC,
in which PPC were focally distributed. We have also shown that large
PTMCs were significantly associated with other morphological features,
predictive of high risk in PTMC: subcapsular location (p=0.0001),
infiltrative tumour border (p=0.011), positive resection margins
(p=0.022), tumour associated stromal reaction (fibrosis/desmoplasia/scle-
rosis) (p=0.0001), calcifications (p=0.007) and intratumoral multinucle-
ated giant cells (p=0.0001).
Conclusion: In this study we have shown that PPCs, especially when
diffusely distributed, are significantly associated with morphological fea-
tures predictive of high-risk like in PTMC. This pattern is important to be
mentioned in the histopathological report, as it could have an impact in
predicting the tumour biological behaviour and could help the clinician in
better guiding the patient’s management.

Distribution of neuroendocrine neoplasms in a tertiary referral hos-
pital in the Philippines
J. Uyboco*, M. Bonifacio, G.L. Pua
*St Luke's Medical Center - QC, Philippines
Background & objectives: Neuroendocrine neoplasms (“NENs”) have
diverse presentations and outcomes. In Southeast Asia, the distribution of
NENs is not yet studied. This study aims to describe the distribution and
clinical features of NENs among patients at a tertiary hospital in the
Philippines.
Methods: The study was an observational, cross-sectional study with
retrospective review of patient records. Surgical pathology files from
2015 to 2020 were reviewed, and all histologically diagnosed neuroen-
docrine neoplasms were tallied and categorized by diagnosis, grade,
stage, age, sex, primary tumour location, and hormone secretion.
Statistical analysis was then performed using Microsoft Excel and R
version 3.2.1.
Results: A total of 398 NEN cases were identified, accounting for ap-
proximately 0.5% of specimens received at the institution. NENs were
most commonly diagnosed in the 60-79 year old age group, with a
male:female ratio of 1.08.
Of the cases studied, 41.2% were well-differentiated neuroendocrine tu-
mours ("NETs"), while 58.8% were malignant NENs.
The majority of cases were from the gastrointestinal tract (22.4%) and
thoracic organs (20.1%). The individual organs in which NENs were
most commonly diagnosed were the lungs (17.6%), followed by the rec-
tum (11.8%), pituitary gland (8.8%), pancreas (6.5%) and uterine cervix
(4.8%).
Abnormal hormone secretion was detected in NENs of the pituitary
(71.4%), parathyroid (18.8%) and pancreas (15.4%).
Conclusion: The study revealed that the Philippine population demon-
strates a distribution of neuroendocrine neoplasms by tumour site similar
that seen in previous studies of East Asian and Pacific Islander popula-
tions. It remains to be seen if this is due to genetic similarities, environ-
mental factors, screening and diagnosis practices, or some combination of
the three.
We recommend further studies on the clinical presentation, staging, man-
agement and outcomes of local patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms.

A cautionary tale of neuroendocrine differentiation in metastatic de-
posits – a two-case report
A. Varelas*, J. Costa, M. Souto Moura, F. Silva, M. Jácome
*Department of Pathology, IPO-Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: A metastatic deposit with neuroendocrine
phenotype in a patient with a previous diagnosis of carcinoma will not
always correspond to an unknown primary. We present two such cases
and the necessary additional workup.
Methods: Case1: a 68year-old male with a diagnosis of epidermoid car-
cinoma of the palatine tonsil in 2015 underwent biopsy for one of several
hepatic nodules 3 months after. Case2: a 56year-old male underwent
biopsy of a suspected recurrence/persistence of a previous cerebellar
Virchows Arch
metastasis, 3 years after the initial diagnosis of stage IV lung adenocar-
cinoma with no EGFR-mutations nor ALK or ROS1 translocations.
Results: Both patients´ biopsies showed occupation by a small-cell phe-
notype carcinoma with neuroendocrine positivity. Clinical histories and
slides of previous diagnosis were reviewed.
Case1: The patient underwent an hepatic metastasectomy, showing a
small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Upon revision, the previous tonsil
biopsy presented an area with crushing artifacts and positivity for
synaptophysin/p16, which was considered the primary origin of the
metastasis.
Case2: the first cerebellar metastasis was consistent with non-small cell
carcinoma, with solid and glandular areas. The patient had been submit-
ted to multiple chemotherapy regimens and cranial radiotherapy prior to
the last cerebellar biopsy showing small cell morphology.
Conclusion: We present two cases of neuroendocrine differentiation in
metastasis. Case1 revealed to be from a combined neuroendocrine and
non-neuroendocrine carcinoma of the tonsil. Case2 was explained as an
histological transformation of non-small to small cell lung carcinoma; this
has been reported in EGFR-mutated and, occasionally, non-mutated lung
carcinomas. These illustrate possible scenarios in which the pathologist
must consider the existence of an underdiagnosed neuroendocrine com-
ponent in the primary tumour or the cytotoxic induction of a neuroendo-
crine clone after therapy.

Determination of the management of neuroendocrine tumours in
pathological anatomy services in Spain. Multicentre study
G.T. Vázquez Benítez*, M. Sampedro, J.L. Muñoz, J. Cubero, E.
Triviño, M. del Olmo, J. Barrioso, J. Capdevilla
*Hospital Universitario HM Montepríncipe, Spain
Background & objectives: Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are a group
of neoplasms that require a precise pathological assessment to be able to
classify and adequately treat these patients.
Methods: An anonymous survey in digital format was designed in col-
laboration with the GETNE (Spanish Group of Neuroendocrine and
Endocrine Tumours) Academy working group, made up of a multidisci-
plinary group that includes surgeons, nuclear physicians, endocrinolo-
gists, oncologists and pathologists. The survey included aspects related
to clinical practice, and key elements in the anatomopathological
diagnosis.
Results: 204 physicians responded to the surveys (45.6% surgery, 29.9%
pathology, 8.8% oncology, 7.9% endocrinology, and 7.8% nuclear med-
icine). Some specialties had a higher prevalence of a reference person
specialized in the management of NETs (p value <0.05). Regarding the
assessment by pathological anatomy, 63.9% consider that the study of
NETs sometimes represents a great diagnostic difficulty. In most centres,
51.2% do not have digital means to determine KI67 in a complementary
way and 27.9% do not have IHC techniques to classify functioning NETs.
33.3% of pathological anatomy services always have the possibility of
consulting cases with other centres and maintain correct communication
with oncologists and surgeons (63.9% and 62.3% respectively)
Conclusion: The questions reflect that NETs are neoplasms that require
specialized management since their diagnosis and classification is often
not easy. A large part of the pathological anatomy services in Spain do not
have some techniques that can serve as a complement in the diagnosis of
NETs, but a large part have the possibility of consulting cases in other
centres that have more experience as well as having the support from
other specialties to improve the management of these neoplasms.

A new pancreatic entity? Two novel cases of a intraductal papillary
mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) mixed with a well-differentiated neuro-
endocrine tumour of the pancreas
G.T. Vázquez Benítez*, F.J. Salamanca, P. Gil, D. Klimstra
*Hospital Universitario HM Montepríncipe, Spain
Background & objectives: The neoplasms known as mixed
neuroendocrine- nonneuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs), the non-
neuroendocrine component of MiNENs is usually represented by an in-
vasive carcinoma, but has not been describe the association with a
intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm
Methods: We find two patients; one of those is a 51-year-old male.
Magnetic resonance of the abdomen, which was performed for the sus-
picion of hemochromatosis, discovered a 3 cm cystic lesion with septa in
the body region of the pancreas and the other is a 56-year old female with
an incidental cystic pancreatic lesion of 4,5 cm in an ultrasound image
Results: The both lesions were characterized by cystically dilated ducts
lined by flat foveolar gastric-type epithelium, without relevant
cytoarchitectural atypia but focally forming microscopic folds and subtle
micropapillary projections. Therefore and accordingly with these fea-
tures, the lesions were fundamentally a mixed-type IPMN with low-
grade displasia, gastric foveolar subtype. Additionally, there were an
underlying proliferation of round, monotonous cells with clear/foamy
c y t o p l a sm , s t i p p l e d c hr o m a t i n a n d s i n g l e n u c l e o l i .
Immunohistochemically, these cells were positive for chromogranin and
synaptophysin, supporting a neuroendocrine phenotype. The ki-67 was
2%. The mitotic rate in the neuroendocrine component was <1/10 high
power fields. The findings in the neuroendocrine component supported a
well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumour grade 1
Conclusion: The finding of a well differentiated neuroendocrine tumour
associated with an IPMN is unusual and has not been described before.
The association of an IPMN with a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine
carcinoma has been described. This lesion may be conceptually consid-
ered a part of same spectrum of neoplasms known as MiNENs, but we do
not regard MiNEN as a proper diagnostic term but rather a conceptual
categorization to relate a somewhat diverse group neoplasms of with
mixed differentiation.

Cornea, S. Tăban, C. Lăzureanu, M. Cornianu
*Department of Pathology, “Victor Babeș” University of Medicine and
Pharmacy, Timișoara, Romania
Background & objectives: Parathyroid adenomas are benign neoplasms
derived from parathyroid parenchymal cells and are the most common
cause for primary hyperparathyroidism. In some cases, these tumours are
a challenge for the pathologist. We aimed to assess clinicopathological
profile of these tumours.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study on surgical resection spec-
imens from patients with parathyroid adenomas operated at the "Pius
Brinzeu" County Emergency Hospital Timișoara, Romania.
Clinicopathological, serological - serum parathyroid hormone (PTH)
and immunohistochemical data (antibodies anti-Ki67 and anti-
Chromogranin A) were assessed.
Results: We identified 39 cases of parathyroid adenomas (32 women and
7 men, mean age 53). The most common site was in the inferior parathy-
roid glands (16 adenomas in right inferior gland, 10 adenomas in left
inferior gland). A double adenoma was identified in the right thyroid lobe
(RTL) and left inferior parathyroid gland, while an ectopic one in RTL
was recorded. Morphologically, we identified 31/39 conventional adeno-
mas, 2/39 water clear cell adenomas, 1/39 oxyphilic adenoma, 2/39
lipoadenomas and 3/39 atypical adenomas. 10/39 cases presented focal
cytological atypia. Ki67 assay values were below 2% (higher value in
atypical adenomas, but did not exceed 5%). All cases presented moder-
ately elevated serum PTH.
Virchows Arch
Conclusion: Most parathyroid adenomas are solitary lesions with an
easily recognizable, conventional morphology. The extent of increased
mitotic activity raise the problem of differentiating adenomas from carci-
nomas, but the absence of vascular/capsular invasion certifies the benign
nature of the lesion. Parathyroid adenomas arising in the thyroid gland
can be difficult to differentiate from a thyroid neoplasms with follicular
pattern. Elevated PTH levels are a supporting serological diagnostic ele-
ment, while neuroendocrine differentiation markers are useful for the
histological diagnosis of parathyroid adenomas.

*Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Saudi Arabia
Background & objectives: Studies demonstrated low rates of placentas
submitted to pathologic examination and poor utilization of pathology
reports.Assess obstetricians’ awareness and utilization of the College of
American Pathologists guidelines for placental pathologic examination
and their understanding of reports terminology.
Methods: An anonymous survey was distributed to obstetricians work-
ing in different health institutes who are registered in Saudi Commission
for Health Specialties’ (SCFHS) database. Statistical Package for Social
Science (SPSS) software was used to examine the association between
the level of training/practice and the surveyed elements as well as types of
the institute and the surveyed elements.
Results: 288 responses were received. 34.4% of respondents were aware
of CAP guidelines, most of which were practicing in governmental hos-
pitals. While 18% of respondents routinely sent placentas for pathological
examination, about 70% of them routinely review the pathology report
and understand the used nomenclature; this was significantly higher in
university hospital practitioners. Out of the three groups, the residents’
group was the least aware of the CAP guidelines and the least to review
and understand pathology reports. In absence of CAP guidelines aware-
ness, foetal anomalies were the most common indication used to send
placentas for examination followed by medicolegal reasons and infections.
Conclusion: Placentalpathologicexaminationwasuniformlyunderutilized
in surveyed practitioners. CAP guidelines were known to a minor subset
within the surveyed participants. All this, combined with the variable
understating of placental pathology reports, highlight the importance of
raising awareness of CAP guidelines, formal placental pathology rotation
for trainees and establishing a rapport between pathologists, and obstetri-
cians to improve their understandings and use of the pathology reports.

and Perinatology after V.I. Kulakov" Ministry of Healthcare Russian
Federation, Russia
Background & objectives:
ACUM (Accessory and Cavitated Uterine Mass) is a form of the
Müllerian duct malformation, more common in adolescents and is an
isolated additional uterine cavity in the normal uterus and optimal diag-
nostics and management strategies are yet to be developed.
Methods: We recruited 14 patients (average age 14 ± 1.66) who were
subdivided into two groups: with malformation of the genital organs,
ACUM (n=4) and with a doubling of the uterus with rudimentary func-
tioning uterine horn (n=10). The diagnosis was made on the basis of
anamnestic data, clinical and laboratory examinations and instrumental
methods (ultrasound, MRI, laparoscopy and histological examination).
Results: Patients with ACUM revealed a non-communicating accessory
uterine cavity with haemorrhagic contents, lined with a functioning en-
dometrium, surrounded by a concentrically organized myometrium,
while the main uterine cavity was of the correct shape. At the same time
the closed functioning uterine rudiment was a separate formation more
often at the edge of the uterus (MRI data). Histologically, ACUM was a
node represented myometrium with endometrioid heterotopies. All pa-
tients underwent laparoscopic removal of ACUM and a functioning uter-
ine horn followed by metroplasty. Average size for ACUM: 3,0(±0,72) х
2,3(±1,04) х 2,7(±0,79) cm, average size for functioning rudiments:
4,5(±0,87) х 3,1(±1,04) х 3,8(±1,17) cm (USD data)
Conclusion: The presented clinical observations emphasize the impor-
tance of imaging methods in the differential diagnosis of ACUM and
uterine rudiment, of particular importance is the use of MRI and histolo-
gy, which determines the main features that distinguish ACUM from the
rudimentary uterine horn. The increased awareness of the ACUM diag-
nosis facilitates the selection of the optimal treatment and management of
these patients as early as possible.

Background & objectives: Ovarian tumours in early reproductive cause
the ovarian reserve reduction. Determination of the ovarian reserve with
blood anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) detection and its impact on benign

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted, 15 adolescent girls with
benign ovarian tumours were included in the study. The average age of
the patients was 14.9 (12-17) years. We analysed the data of anamnesis,
clinical course, hormonal status, the level of tumour markers, the results
of ultrasound examination of the ovaries, and pathomorphological anal-
ysis of the removed tumour.
Results: In mature teratomas (n = 11), the AMH level averaged 3.1 ±
1.45 ng / ml, in cystadenomas (n = 3) - 3.45 ± 3.18, and only with fibroma
with a diameter of 4 cm was 10, 1 ng / ml. Regardless of the structure with
a tumour size of 3-5 cm the AMH level was average 5.69 ± 1.40 ng/ml.
Moreover, the AMH value was similar in girls with ovarian formations
with a diameter of 6 to 19 cm (2.33-2.91 ng / ml). The thinned cortical
layer in 6 out of 9 samples contained primordial and maturing follicles,
even in cases of large ovarian tumours.
Conclusion: It is required to keep attention on the concentration of AMH
when determining the further tactics of inpatient treatment of adolescents
with benign ovarian tumours, even if the pathologist conclusion indicates
the safety of the ovarian follicular apparatus in the damaged tissue.

*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, Sousse,
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Vulvar cancer is a rare gynaecologic malig-
nancy. It is a pathology of women over 60y-o with a background of
dystrophy and a mucous membrane oestrogen-deficient. Recently, it af-
fects younger women due to the pathogenic-role of viral infectious agents
such as the human-papilloma-virus, especially HPV16.
Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study collect-
ed over a period of 20 years from January 1995 to December 2015. The
study included all patients who were treated for primary malignant vulvar
lesions in the obstetrics gynaecology department of Farhat Hached
Hospital in Sousse, confirmed histologically on biopsy in the pathological
anatomy department of the same hospital.
Results: A total of 102-patients were included with a mean-age of
66.45years (range 21 to 92 years). Only 12.7% of the patients were under
50y-o. The main reason for consultation was vulvar pruritus in 89.2% of
cases, with an average delay of 15-months. The median tumour size was
3.75cm. A tumour biopsy was performed in all cases with the most fre-
quent histological type was squamous cell carcinoma, representing
98%of cases. According to the FIGO classification, 65.68% (67) of pa-
tients were stage I-II, with more than50% stage I B (36/67). 34.3% (35) of
patients were stage III or stage IV. Surgical treatment was performed in
94.68% of patients. The main objective of the surgery was to have free-
surgical-margins over 8mm, objective achieved in 94.6%. 81.91% of the
patients underwent inguinal lymph node dissection. The overall survival
was 49.3% at 2 years and 28% at 5 years.
Conclusion: Vulvar cancer is a grave pathology, especially since it cur-
rently affects an increasingly young population since the incrimination of
HPV in its genesis. Its treatment is heavy and burdened with a significant
morbidity. However, its prognosis would be improved by an early diag-
nosis allowing a conservative surgical treatment. The prevention of this
cancer passes by the exploration, the monitoring and the treatment of the
chronic vulvar prurits, as well as the dystrophic and viral precursors.

Abdessayed, M. Mokni
*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, Sousse,
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Despite the large scientific evidence demon-
strating that hysteroscopy examination is the gold standard of the man-
agement of abnormal uterine bleeding, data for accuracy of this procedure
in symptomatic women under tamoxifen is less common.
Methods: the present study is a transversal retrospective descriptive
study carried out in both gynaecological and pathological departments
at Farhat Hached Hospital during a period of 10-years, from 1st-January-
2006 to 31-December-2015. A total of 41-Tamoxifen-treated-patients
with breast cancer who presented with abnormal -uterine-bleeding were
enrolled. The mean age was 52,7-years at diagnosis. The mean period of
taking tamoxifen was 31,8 +/– 14,6months.
Results: The mean cumulative dose of Tamoxifen was 19,1g. The
Median endometrial thickness on transvaginal ultrasonography examina-
tion was 11mm. Hysteroscopy was indicated for abnormal-uterine-
bleeding with thickened-endometrium in most of the cases (83,7%) and
showed that atrophy was the most common finding (26%). Abnormal-
hysteroscopy-findings were dominated by polyps and hyperplasia that
were found in 27,9% and 25,6% of the cases respectively.
Hysterescopic appearance suggestive of malignancy was found in one
case (2,3%). Curettage of the uterine cavity was performed for the ma-
jority of the patients (95,3%), and targeted biopsies were required in two
cases. Endometrial sampling yielded insufficient tissue in 18,6% of cases.
Histological examination exhibited benign findings for the all patients
except one for whom subsequent hysterectomy specimens that concluded
to an atypical complex hyperplasia.
Conclusion: For distinguishing endometrial abnormalities from normal
findings, hysteroscopy had an overall accuracy of 80%. For the diagnosis
of polyps, leiomyoma and hyperplasia, hysteroscopy had an accuracy of
94.28%, 91.42% and 74.28% respectively.
Hysteroscopy represents an accurate and non-invasive method for
the assessment of endometrium, and should be mandatory for pa-
tients under tamoxifen any time AUB occurs. The benefits and risks
of prophylactic use of levonorgesterel intrauterine system are still to
be determined.

carcinoma

Bosch, H.C. van Doorn, P.J. van der Spek, S. Koljenovic, F. van

*Erasmus MC, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Aberrations in DNA-methylation are known
to play a role in carcinogenesis, and methylation profiling has enabled the
identification of biomarkers of potential clinical interest for several can-
cers. For vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) however, methylation
profiling remains an under-studied area.
Methods: We sought to identify differentially methylated genes (DMGs)
in VSCC, by performing Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip
(Illumina) array sequencing, on a set of primary VSCC (n = 18), and
normal vulvar tissue from women with no history of vulvar
(pre)malignancies (n = 6). Immunohistochemistry was performed with
p16 and p53 to categorize the VSCCs as HPV-associated or HPV-
independent.
Results: Using false-discovery rate of 0.05 and beta-difference (Δβ)
of ± 0.5 as cut-offs, we identified 387 probes located in the CpG
islands that were differentially methylated in VSCC. These probes
corresponds to 199 DMGs (195 hyper-methylated, 4 hypo-methylat-
ed). The majority of the hyper-methylated genes were found to be
involved in transcription regulator activity, indicating that disruption
of this process plays a role in VSCC development. The majority of
VSCCs harboured amplifications of chromosomes 3, 9, and 10. By
integrating methylation and copy number variation analyses, 5 DMGs
were identified, namely, APLP2, ARHGEF12, CSGALNACT1,
GRM7, and PRICKLE2-AS1, which harboured deletion in one allele
and hypermethylation in another allele.
Conclusion: We identified a set of DMGs in VSCC in this study with a
view to promote hypothesis-generation, and to provide a resource for
future investigations to evaluate the diagnostic, prognostic, predictive,
or therapeutic potential of these methylation-based bio-markers.
Prognostic relevance of these DMGs deserves further exploration in larg-
er cohorts of VSCC and its precursor lesion, vulvar intraepithelial neo-
plasia (VIN).

Background & objectives: Molecular classification of endometrial can-
cer based on TCGA data recognizes 4 subtypes: 1)CNH,
2)Hypermutated, 3)CNL and 4)Ultramutated (POLE mutated). This
study intends to explore the diagnostic performance of a novel technology
(MODAPLEX) to study POLE mutations in endometrial carcinoma
samples.
Methods: 96 endometrial cancers samples with available histological/
molecular classification, were selected. For each case a tumoral block was
chosen, obtaining eight sections of 10 μm thickness and subsequently iso-
lating DNA with “Cobas DNA Sample Preparation Kit”. DNA concentra-
tion was measured by Qubit, excluding those cases with a concentration
under 10 ng/μl. Positive results were reconfirmed using Sanger sequencing.
Results: 94 samples were submitted to the test, discarding 20 of them for
an invalid result. Among the final 74 samples, 15 were POLE mutated, 18
CNL, 25 CNH and 16 MSI. MODAPLEX identified 13 samples with
mutations on POLE, which were: V411L,P286R,S297F,A456P and
L424V. All these mutations were located in the exonuclease domain
and had a functional impact on the protein. All the reported mutations
by MODAPLEX, were afterwards confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Two
cases previously classified as POLE were not identified by the test, but
repeatedly confirmed by Sanger. These two cases harboured A456V and
A465T mutations, described as uncommon and whose primers were not
covered by the kit.
Conclusion: MODAPLEX is a promising technology still in develop-
ment that allows the determination of the main “Hotspot” mutations in
POLE gene in a fast, practical and efficient way. Following a Single-Gene
approach and in this clinical context, this technology could compete with
Sanger sequencing for the study of POLE mutations.
This test could emerge as a valid and fast alternative to Next – Generation
Sequencing, especially in those centres where they do not have access to
massive sequencing techniques.

NFIB rearrangement and MYB-NFIB fusion are infrequent events
in vulvar adenoid cystic carcinoma
D. Doutel*, D. Venda, F. Silva, C. Martins, A. Félix, J. Ferreira
*Instituto Português de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Portugal
Background & objectives: MYB/MYBL1-NFIB fusions are driver
events in adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC). MYB rearrangement and
MYB-NFIB fusion have been reported to occur in ~60 and 30% of vulvar
ACCs, respectively. We aim to access the prevalence of NFIB rearrange-
ment and MYB-NFIB fusion.
Methods: We retrieved four vulvar ACCs from our institution’s archives
diagnosed between 1994 and 2019 for which FFPE material was avail-
able. All histological slides and medical records were reviewed.
For detection of gene rearrangements by fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) two strategies were applied: 1) break-apart probes for MYB,
MYBL1 and NFIB genes and 2) dual colour probes for MYB-NFIB fusion.
Results: Patients were 41-70 years old at the time of diagnosis. All cases
were treated by surgery alone at presentation, 3 of which suffered local re-
currence. The diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma was confirmed in all
cases,nonewithahigh-gradecomponent.Allpatientswerealiveanddisease
free at the time of the last follow-up appointment (median: 102,5 months).
MYB rearrangement was detected in 3/4 cases, including one with con-
current MYB amplification. No MYBL1 nor NFIB rearrangements were
found. MYB-NFIB fusion was absent in all four cases. One of our cases,
despite having a classical ACC morphology, did not have NFIB, MYB or
MYBL1 rearrangements, or MYB-NFIB fusion.
Conclusion: We report a lower rate of NFIB rearrangement and MYB-
NFIB fusion than expected. In keeping with the other studies performed
in this anatomical location, the prevalence of NFIB rearrangement and
MYB-NFIB fusion seems to be lower in the vulva than elsewhere.
Although MYB activation occurs in the majority of vulvar ACC, it is
likely due to other mechanisms yet to be unravelled.

HER2/neu expression in patients with primary uterine endometrial
carcinomas in Batangas Medical Center, Philippines
D.A.R. Bacong, G.A. Espiritu*
*Centro Escolar University, Philippines
Background & objectives: Uterine cancer is the eighth leading cancer
among women with an estimated age-standardized Philippine incidence
rate of 5.6 per 100,000. To aid in the prognostication and management of
endometrial cancers, expression of HER2/neu in Filipinos with endome-
trial cancer was determined.
Methods: Sixty-seven cases out of all 71 resection specimens with endo-
metrial cancer, from 2017 to 2019, were included in the study. Exclusion
of the 4 cases was due to unavailability of paraffin blocks. Histological
section was taken for immunohistochemical staining with HER2/neu.
Previously proposed HER2 testing algorithm for endometrial carcinoma
(EC), based on the modified 2007 ASCO/CAP breast criteria, was used.
Results: Eighty-six percent of the patients were 45 years and older.
Ninety-five percent were of endometrioid histologic type, 2 (2.98%) cases
were serous, and 1 (1.49%) case was mixed Mullerian tumour.
Lymph node metastasis was present in 6.0% of cases. Most of the
cases (65.67%) belonged to FIGO Stage I. HER2/neu was positive
(3+) in 27.3% (3/11) of endometrioid grade 3, 14.3% (3/21) of
endometrioid grade 2, and 6.1% (2/33) of endometrioid grade 1.
Among the two cases with serous EC, one was positive while the
other was negative. The single case of mixed Mullerian tumour was
positive for HER2/neu. HER2/neu was either negative or equivocal
in cases with node metastasis.
Conclusion: Although most of the HER/neu positive cases in this study
were seen in tumours with higher histologic grade, Fisher Freeman
Halton test showed no sufficient evidence to say that age, lymph node
involvement, FIGO grading and cancer staging were associated with
HER2/neu expression. Since literatures show HER2/neu had significant
association on prognosis, overall survival, and has potential for targeted
therapy and/or as adjunct to chemotherapy, a larger, multicentre study is
warranted.

Nuclear beta-catenin expression - a prognostic marker for endome-
trial carcinomas
A. Evsei*, A. Birceanu-Corobea, M. Sajin, N. Copca
*Saint Mary Clinical Hospital, Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Numerous studies have shown that immu-
nohistochemical nuclear beta-catenin expression in endometrial carcino-
ma (EC) is a successful substitute for CTNNB1 exon 3 mutation. Our
purpose for this study was to evaluate the nuclear beta-catenin expression
in 50 cases of endometrial carcinoma.
Methods: We tested immunohistochemical nuclear beta-catenin expres-
sion in 50 cases of endometrial carcinomas in Romanian female patients.
We also performed statistical correlations between this marker and various
parameters (histopathological, immunohistochemical etc.). Also, we
analysed what molecular subgroup of endometrial carcinomas (MSS,
MSI, p53wt, p53abn) showed the most frequent cases with beta-catenin
expression.
Results: Our study revealed that ECs with nuclear beta-catenin positivity
was observed in cases with higher FIGO grade (p=0.02), in endometrioid
carcinomas (p=0.04) and in cases with lymphovascular invasion
(p=0.05). ER and PR were frequently expressed in the positive beta-
catenin subgroup (p=0.03, p=0.02). Our results show that ECs which
express nuclear beta-catenin correlate with parameters that are already
established as unfavourable.
Conclusion: Our struggle for affordable prognostic markersisa continuous
battle. The immunohistochemical beta-catenin nuclear expression is an ex-
cellent replacement for CTNNBB1 exon 3 mutation in ECs and predicts

Rhabdomyoblastic differentiation in uterine carcinosarcoma: impact
on survival and recurrence
A. Fitouri*, G. Sahraoui, L. Charfi, N. Boujelbene, M. Slimane, I. Abbes,
K. Mrad, R. Doghri
*Pathology Department, Rabta Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Uterine carcinosarcomas (UCS) are char-
acterized by a carcinomatous and sarcomatous contingent.
Heterologous mesenchymal components, most frequently show
rhabdomyoblastic or chondroid differentiation. The aim of our study
was to determine the impact of rhabdomyoblastic differentiation on
survival and recurrence.
Methods: Study was retrospective, covering 52 patients operated by
hysterectomy and whose diagnosis of UCS was confirmed on an opera-
tive specimen at the anatomy and pathological cytology department of the
Salah Azaïez institute in Tunis from 2018 to 2000. Statistical analysis was
done using the Kaplan-Meier method and the Log-Rank test in univariate
analysis (The statistical significance level was ≤0.05).
Results: For the 52 patients with UCS, rhabdomyoblastic differentiation
was present in 22 cases (42.3%) and absent in 30 cases (57.7%).
The overall survival rate at 1 year, 3 years and 5 years for patients
who presented rhabdomyoblastic differentiation were 56%, 27% and
18% compared to 75%, 59% and 47% for those who did not present
this differentiation. This difference was statistically significant (p =
0.0193).
The recurrence-free survival rate at 1 year, 3 years and 5 years for
patients who presented rhabdomyoblastic differentiation were 45%,
31% and 30% compared to 71%, 53% and 43% for those who did
not present this differentiation. This difference was statistically sig-
nificant (p = 0.05).
Conclusion: UCS are high grade tumour, characterized by a poor 5-year
overall survival rate (overall <35%). The role of heterologous sarcoma-
tous elements as a prognostic factor has been widely discussed with
discrepant results in different series. Whereas, like our study, the presence
of rhabdomyoblastic differentiation is a factor of poor prognosis correlat-
ed, in univariate analysis, with a bad overall survival. It is also correlated
with a bad recurrence-free survival.

Comparison of endometrial biopsy and postoperative hysterectomy
specimen findings in patients with uterine carcinosarcoma
A. Fitouri*, G. Sahraoui, L. Charfi, M. Slimane, N. Boujelbene, I. Abbes,
K. Mrad, R. Doghri
*Pathology Department, Rabta Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Uterine carcinosarcomas (UCS) are biphasic
tumours which diagnosis can be made on biopsy or surgical specimen.
The aim of study was to assess concordance between preoperative endo-
metrial sampling and microscopic examination of hysterectomy speci-
mens in patients finally diagnosed with UCS.
Methods: We analysed a group of 43 patients who had a biopsy
and whose diagnosis of UCS was confirmed on operative speci-
men at the pathological anatomy and cytology department of the
Salah Azaïez institute in Tunis, over a period of 19 years (from
2018 to 2000).
Results: Endometrial biopsy was performed in 43 patients. It made it
possible to make the exact diagnosis of UCS in 20 cases (46.5%). In
the 23 other cases (53.5%), the diagnosis was corrected postoperatively.
The diagnoses mentioned were: endometrioid adenocarcinoma in 14
cases (32.6%), sarcoma in two cases (4.7%), undifferentiated tumour in
one case (2.3%), undifferentiated carcinoma in one case (2.3%), serous
carcinoma in one case (2.3%), adenosarcoma in one case (2.3%) and the
result was non-contributory in three cases (7%).
Conclusion: In endometrial cancer, our findings demonstrate a low level
of concordance between the histological diagnosis on endometrial curet-
tage and at hysterectomy.
The sensitivity of this biopsy to detect sarcomatous elements is lower than
that of carcinomatous elements. Many studies conclude that endometrial
sampling is less precise in predicting the final histological diagnosis of the
sarcomatous component than the carcinomatous component. Indeed, the
diagnosis of UCS is often made on the surgical specimen.

Complete hydatidiform mole with mosaic histology: a study of 10
cases with immunohistochemistry
M. Fukunaga*
*Shin-Yurigaoka General Hospital, Japan
Background & objectives: Complete moles (CM) with mosaic histology
may pose a diagnostic challenge. Differential diagnosis is very important
for patient management. The objective is to clarify histologic and immu-
nohistochemical features and its histogenesis.
Methods: Ten cases of CM with mosaic histology in the first trimester
were retrieved, and their initial diagnoses included CM (3 cases), a twin
placenta with CM (2), CM with mosaic histology (2), PM (2), and
hydropic abortion with trophoblastic hyperplasia (1). They were analysed
with immunostaining of p57 (Kip2) and TSSC3, which are products of
paternally imprinted, maternally expressed genes.
Results: Histologically, 5 cases had both CM and placental mesenchymal
dysplasia (PMD) components. The 5 remaining cases had CM and non-
PMD components. Cytotrophoblasts and stromal cells of CM compo-
nents were negative for p57. Cytotrophoblasts and stromal cells of non-
PMD components expressed p57. In PMD components, cytotrophoblasts
were positive for p57 and TSSC3, and stromal cells were negative for
p57, indicating that the stromal cells were androgenetic, and the
cytotrophoblasts were biparental.
Conclusion: The findings support the hypothesis that the misexpression
of p57 and TSSC3 is involved in abnormal development of androgenic
CM. CM with mosaic histology can be classified into two groups; CM
with PMD components and CM with non-PMD components. None of the
cases was CM with twin, but rather CM with androgenic/biparental chi-
mera or mosaic molar gestation and PMD. Immunohistochemistry of p57
and TSSC3 can be a useful screening tool for cytogenetic analyses of CM
with mosaic histology.

Mast cell microenvironment in smooth muscle tumours of the
gynaecologic tract
T. Georgescu*, A.C. Lisievici, S. Barbu, O. Toader, D. Cretoiu, M. Sajin,
N. Suciu
*Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: The scientific literature states that smooth
muscle tumours of the gynaecological tract harbour a variable number
of mast cells, similar to neural tumours. Several studies have reported a
higher number of mast cells in atypical leiomyomas, compared to
leiomyosarcomas.
Methods: A total of 98 smooth muscle tumours have been diagnosed in
our laboratory during a period of 4 months, including 78 leiomyomas, 18
atypical leiomyomas and 2 leiomyosarcomas. The number of mast cells
was evaluated per 10 HPF on both Hematoxylin Eosin and Toluidin Blue
stains, and subsequently correlated with the presence of atypia, necrosis
and mitotic index.
Results: The total number of mast cells varied from 0 to 156 per 10
HPF, with a mean of 28. Tumour size correlated best with a high
number of mast cells. All leiomyomas larger than 10 cm had more
Virchows Arch
than 30 mast cells / 10 HPF. Apoplectic leiomyomas had a mean of
48 mast cells / 10 HPF, with more than 70% of cases featuring at least
40 mast cells / 10 HPF. High numbers of mast cells were also ob-
served in cellular leiomyomas (45) and mitotically active
leiomyomas (33). Less than 10 mast cells / 10 HPF were observed
in epithelioid leiomyomas and in leiomyosarcoma.
Conclusion: The increased number of mast cells encountered in large
leiomyomas, apoplectic and cellular leiomyomas can serve as a
reassuring criterion, aiding in the differential diagnosis with
leiomyosarcoma. Ordinary leiomyomas feature a low number of mast
cells, 76% of them having less than 10 mast cells / 10 HPF.

Choriocarcinoma in South African women: analysis of a series with
genotyping
J. Goedhals*, J. Oosthuizen, A. de Kock, M. Theron
*NHLS and UFS, South Africa
Background & objectives: Choriocarcinomas can be either gestational,
arising from a previous pregnancy, or non-gestational. The prognosis and
treatment differ and correct categorisation is important. Genotyping can
be used to make this distinction, but this technique has not yet been used
in Africa.
Methods: In this study, we genotyped 20 choriocarcinomas and 6 control
cases of complete hydatidiform mole (CHM) using a short tandem repeat
multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for 15 loci and a sex
marker, amelogenin.
Results: All the patients were of African descent. Amplification failed in
two cases and these were excluded from the study. Of the remaining 18
choriocarcinoma cases, 17 were gestational and one was non-gestational.
Sixteen of the gestational cases were purely androgenetic/homozygous
XX compatible with a previous CHM, while one arose from a previous
normal pregnancy. In addition, a rare variant allelic repeat, 22.2 at locus
FGA, was identified in one case. This variant has a frequency of 0.0026 in
the South African population.
Conclusion: In this study, 88.9% of the choriocarcinomas were ges-
tational arising from a previous CHM, which is in keeping with pre-
vious international studies. Although molecular genotyping is not
required in all cases of choriocarcinoma as the majority are gestation-
al, molecular genotyping can be useful in cases that do not respond to
first-line treatment and cases where the clinical history is suggestive
of a non-gestational tumour so that the appropriate treatment can be
implemented.

Filipiak, W. Lewitowicz, E. O'Regan
*Student Science Club at Collegium Medium, Jan Kochanowski
University, Poland
Background & objectives: PTEN inhibits the Akt signalling pathway
thus plays an important role in regulating cellular behaviors.
We investigated if PTEN (which seems to act as a negative regulator of
IGF1R and IGFR2) enhances proliferation and the inhibition of apoptosis
if mutated.
Methods: We analysed 102 cases of endometrial cancer treated between
2005- 2020. DNA extracted from 102 clinical specimens of endometrial
cancer FFPE. Sixty-eight DNA samples were successfully processed with
the AmpliSeq for Illumina Cancer Hotspot Panel Cancer according to
manufacturer’s manual. The analysis included hotspot regions of 50
genes with known associations to cancer. The data was analysed for
sequencing coverage.
Results: Our initial data showed IGF-1R overexpression in 78% of sam-
ples. We observed PTEN mutation in 49% and PIK3CA in 35% of cases.
The preliminary statistics suggests a strong correlation PTEN silencing
with IGF1R overexpression (p<0.05). Interestingly, we have not noted
the same with PIK3CA and KRAS mutation (p>0.05)
Conclusion: Our row data are still under biostatistics, but first the insight
allows us to connect IGFR1R overexpression in endometrial cancer with
the inhibition of PTEN activity.

HOXA11 Receptors as an additional marker of implantation in
assisted reproductive technology programs (ART)
E. Kazachkov*, E. Chukhnina, E. Voropaeva, E. Kazachkova, D.
Voropaev, A. Koshkina
*South Ural State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: HOXА genes and the proteins they encode
are key regulators of endometrial reception. The aim of the study was to
evaluate the effect of HOXA10 and HOXA11 expression levels in the
stroma on the results of ART programs.
Methods: A prospective cohort study of IVF outcomes was performed in
68 women of advanced reproductive age with tubal-peritoneal infertility.
An endometrial pipe-biopsy was taken during the supposed implantation
window. The endometrial samples were formalin-fixed and embedded in
paraffin. For immunohistochemistry, rabbit polyclonal HOXA10 аnd
HOXA11 receptor antibodies were used. The percentage of HOXA10
and HOXA11-positive stromal cells was calculated.
Results: The threshold value of HOX11 expression in endometrial stro-
mal cells at the cut-off point was 6.14%. When the threshold parameter is
equal to or less than 6.14%, the endometrium is characterized as recep-
tive, favourable for implantation, with a value of more than 6.14% of the
threshold parameter unfavourable for implantation. The area under the
ROC curve corresponding to the relationship between implantation prog-
nosis and HOXA11 expression in endometrial stroma cells was
0.784=0.058; 95% CI: 0.672-0.897 (p=0.000). The sensitivity and spec-
ificity of the method were 80% and 73%. There were no significant
differences in the expression of HOXA10 in endometrial stromal cells
at different outcomes of ART programs.
Conclusion: The results of the study allow us to expand the range of
markers of endometrial receptivity in infertility of tubal origin in
women of older reproductive age. The revealed reference value of

Oxidative stress influence and ROS up-regulation on umbilical cord
cytokines and their role in inflammatory complications after sponta-
neous preterm birth
I. Koleva*, M. Angelova, G. Nikolova, Y. Karamalakova
*Medical Faculty, Trakia University, Bulgaria
Background & objectives: The aim of this research was to examine the
oxidative stress (OS) biomarkers, reactive oxygen species (ROS) up-
regulation and inflammatory cytokines complications associated with
changes in the endogenous antioxidant defense (EAD) in the umbilical
cord, after spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB).
Virchows Arch
Methods: We assessed OS biomarkers- ascorbate, superoxide-anion, ni-
tro radicals and ROS up-regulation in the umbilical cord in 101 women
with sPTB. OS were measured by EPR spin-trapping spectroscopy in real
time. The EAD levels- superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT),
glutation peroxidase (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and inter-
leukins (IL)-IL-6 and IL-17 inflammatory complications were measured
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Results: The prospective case-control study was conducted at UMBAL,
Stara Zagora, Bulgaria (2017-2020) and determined in two groups:
n1=100 sPTB, cardiotocography confirmed for >32 g.a.; n2=100 healthy
pregnant, with a registered singleton pregnancy, at 37-39+6 g.a. gave
birth on the term (BT). The two-fold decrease (p> 0.05, t-test) expression
of OS biomarkers (i.e. ascorbate radicals, superoxide radicals, nitric ox-
ide, SOD, CAT, GSH, TAC); significant two-fold increase of ROS con-
centration (R = 0.958, p<0.05, t-test) and inflammatory factors levels, i.e.
IL-6 (p<0.003, t-test) and IL-17 (p<0.005, t-test) were registered in um-
bilical cord homogenates in sPTB patients, compared to BT.
Conclusion: Generally, our findings suggest that OS involves many
signalling molecules in the umbilical cord of sPTB, which are reg-
ulated in a dynamics manner. The additional sPTB mechanisms
caused increased OS, ROS overproduction, and IL-6 and IL-17 in-
flammatory complications, which in turn leads to endogenous anti-
oxidant system failure in the umbilical cord in preterm infants and
elevated infant mortality.

Expression of PTEN in cervical lesions and its correlation with ad-
hesion proteins
D. Koumoundourou*, G. Michail, G. Androutsopoulos, P. Ravazoula
*Patras University Hospital Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: The role of PTEN and adhesion molecules in
cervical neoplasia isn't well established.
The purpose of our study was the assessment of PTEN, B-catenin and E-
cadhenin expression in cervical lesions and the evaluation of their poten-
tial role in cervical carcinogenesis.
Methods: 47 low and high grade cervical dysplasia specimens (CINI-II-
III) and 10 specimens of invasive squamous cervical carcinomas were
used and the proteins’ expression was evaluated using immunohisto-
chemistry. Statistical analysis was performed implementing SPSS16 for
windows.
Results: PTEN and E-cadherin expression was found decreased in CIN
III and invasive carcinomas (p=0,022) while a strong association was also
found between PTEN and E-cadherin immunopositivity (p=0,011). The
expression of B-catenin was strongly correlated with E-cadherin’s immu-
nostaining (p=0,027)
Conclusion: E-cadherin and β-catenin seem to correlate with each other,
and their expression is probably involved in the development of cervical
lesions. Furthermore, PTEN loss represents a crucial event in malignant
transformation procedure; however, its correlation with the adhesion pro-
teins deserves further investigation.

Serous cell differentiation as a marker of neoplastic transformation
in patients with ovarian endometrioid cysts
L. Mikhaleva*, O. Patsap, T. Bezuglova, A. Davydov, G. Aliev
*FSBI RIHM, Russia
Background & objectives: Endometriosis ranges up to 15% in women
and is one of causes of the infertility. Many theories highlight pathogen-
esis of the endometriosis and endometriosis-associated tumours but none
of them can explain its ability to neoplastic transformation and associated
serum biomarkers.
Methods: This study was conducted on surgical specimens from ovarian
endometrioid cysts (OEC) and the ovarian tumours obtained after surgical
operation from 117 patients. Normal level of serum CA-125 was assumed
to be up to 35 IU/ml. Immunohistochemical study of WT1, p53 antibod-
ies was performed.
Results: The results revealed a direct correlation between the level of
serum CA-125 and the appearing of serous IHC-phenotype in epithelial
OEC cells with WT1 expression (Pearson r= 0.84, p<0.0001) and the p53
expression in the OEC epithelium (Pearson r= 0.81, p<0.0001) as well as
direct correlation was found when studying the relationship between
WT1 and p53 expression in OEC epithelium (Pearson r= 0.79,
p<0.0001). A moderate direct relationship was found between the OEC
size and the WT1 and p53 expression (Spearman r = 0,5 and 0,6 resp.),
along with a moderate inverse relationship between BMI and the level of
p53 expression (Spearman r = - 0,57 and - 0,6 resp.).
Conclusion: This research revealed the changes in OEC epithelium with
serous epithelial type IHC-phenotype that were associated with an exten-
sive rise in the serum biomarker CA-125 level, that could indicate the
early neoplastic transformation of OEC.

Parietal endometriosis on caesarean section scar: study of 8 cases
Z. Nfikha*, S. Mestiri, S. Smida, B. Bannour, D. Chiba, S. Chaieb, M.
Mokni
*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Parietal endometriosis is a rare pathology
and represents 1 to 2 % of cases of extragenital endometriosis. It can
occur on all scars, most often during surgery with hysterotomy, and is
due to the implantation of endometrium in the scar.
Methods: The retrospective study concerns all the cases of parietal en-
dometriosis taken in charge during one year in the Farhat Hached
gynaeco-obstetrical service from January 1, 2018 to December 1, 2019.
Results: Six patients were operated during this period. The average age
was 34 years. All patients had at least one history of caesarean section.
The interval between the operation and the appearance of the first symp-
toms was on average four years. Only 50% of the patients presented a
typical clinical picture with pain according to the menstrual cycle. The
average size of the nodules was 2 cm. The diagnosis of parietal endome-
triosis was suspected before treatment in 100% of cases. The treatment
was surgical, involving removal of the nodule. In 62.5% of cases the
lesion was preaponeurotic. There were no complications except for a
single case of homolateral recurrence.
Conclusion: Parietal cicatricial endometriosis is a rare pathology but its
diagnosis must be evoked in particular in women who have undergone
open gynaecological or obstetrical surgery and who present pain associ-
ated or not with menstrual disorders. The treatment is mainly surgical.

Expression RIP3, a molecular switch for necroptosis and inflamma-
tion, in cases of placenta accreta
N. Nizyaeva*, A. Mikheeva, O. Lisitsyna, V. Mukhametzyanov, T.
Sukhacheva, R. Serov, R. Shmakov, G. Sukhikh
*National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynaecology and
Perinatology, Moscow, Russia
Background & objectives: Recently, there has been an increase in the
incidence (1:500) of the of placenta accretа spectrum (PAS). However,
the pathogenic mechanisms of placenta accreta aren't clear. The receptor-
interacting protein kinase 3 has emerged as a critical regulator of pro-
grammed necrosis.
Methods: The study included 63 patients of reproductive age (mean
34,64±3,69 y.y.), after caesarean section at 34-36 gestation weeks with
Virchows Arch
PAS. We performed histological (H&E, methylene blue) and immuno-
histochemical studies to primary antibody (1:500; Abcam) on paraffin-
and epon-araldite-embedded preparations of 63 myometrium samples
(accreta–36, 19–increta, 8–percreta), taken after caesarean section.
Сontrol group were 8 myometrium samples from women without PAS.
Results: As a results of the histologic examination reflected dystrophic
damage and partial membrane bubbling, cytoplasm fragmentation and
condensation of chromatin of some smooth muscle cells and fibrоblasts
in myometrium samples in cases of PAS group comparison to the control
group (p<0,05). Immunohistochemical study showed significant in-
creased RIP3 cytoplasmic expression in smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts,
endothelium of blood vessels, and especially decidual cells than in the
control group (p<0,05). In the sites of necrosis associated with placenta
increta, the expression of RIP3 was absent.
Conclusion: Thus, disturbances of expression RIP3 the mechanisms of
necroapoptosis in PAS are activated, which probably facilitates the pla-
centa invasion into the myometrium.
Funding: This study is supported by State Assignment №25-А19.

PTEN mutation landscape in endometrial cancer
E. O'Regan*, Z. Greally, W. Lewitowicz, P. Lewitowicz, O. Adamczyk-
Gruszka, M. Wawszczak, A. Filipiak
*Jan Kochanowski Medical School, Poland
Background & objectives: PTEN gene (tumour suppressor gene).PTEN
protein maintains the balance of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The loss of
PTEN gene function increases rate of occurrence of aggressive metastatic
disease, it can be used as a biomarker for prognosis in distinguishing
indolent tumours from aggressive.
Methods: we analysed 102 cases of endometrial cancer from 2005-2020
their complete clinical information, chemotherapy regiments and recur-
rence free survival was tabulated. 68 DNA samples (67%) were success-
fully processed with AmpliSeq for Illumina Cancer Hotspot Panel Cancer
(Illumina Inc, San Diego, California). The analysis included hotspot re-
gions of 50 genes with known cancer associations. Analysis for sequenc-
ing coverage and variant frequency cut-off occurred
Results: In the group that was studied we observed a 49% frequency of
PTEN mutations. There was a large mutational heterogeneity noted. In
comparison to the Cosmic Database the frequency of nonsense, missense
and frameshift insertion were on a similar level, however the frequency of
frameshift deletion was much higher reaching 30% compared to 15%. On
the other hand, PIK3CA, KRAS, FGFR2, CTNNB1, FBXW7 genes have
shown great homogeneity with almost only missense type mutations. The
TP53 gene mutation was mostly missense type in 80% of cases.
Conclusion: Our study confirms a leading role of PTEN gene in endo-
metrial cancer. Our results differ from Cosmic Database only in the aspect
of frame shift deletion mutations, where we observed frequency that was
two times higher. Interestingly we noted mutational homogeneity
concerning other important genes.

Somatic neoplasms ranging from benign to malignant arising in the
setting of ovarian mature teratomas: a series of cases examined in
our laboratory during the course of the last year
M. Papazian*, S. Stasinopoulou, D. Bouklas, A. Ieronymaki, N.
Novkovic, D. Tiniakos
*Aretaieion University Hospital of Athens, Pathology Department,
Greece
Background & objectives: This study is a review of all pure mature
ovarian teratomas that were examined in our institution from March-
2020 to March-2021, in order to depict somatic neoplasms arising in this
setting. In 4/36 cases we identified neoplasms with benign, borderline or
malignant features.
Methods: All tumours had macroscopic features of mature cystic terato-
mas, filled with hair & sebum.
Case-1: a 45-year-old pregnant woman with an 8cm-ovarian-tumour ex-
cised during delivery/caesarean section. On dissection, a 1.8cm solid soft
nodule was identified embedded in mature fatty tissue.
Case-2: a 33-year-old woman with a 4cm-unilocular-ovarian-tumour with
a 1.2cm Rokitansky-tubercle.
Case-3: a 59-year-old woman with a 12cm-multilocular-ovarian-tumour.
Case-4: a 71-year-old woman with a 10.5cm-unilocular-ovarian-tumour
with a 2cm Rokitansky-tubercle.
Results: Case-1: Microscopically, the 1.8cm nodule was situated in the
reticular dermis & adipose tissue, underneath the dermal epithelial lining
of the cyst. It consisted of hyperplastic apocrine glands with eosinophilic/
foamy cytoplasm, apical snouts & luminal secretions, surrounded by a
layer of myoepithelial cells. Immunohistochemically, the epithelial cells
stained positive for CkAE1/AE3&GCDFP-15. p63&S-100 highlighted
the myoepithelial cell-layer. Chromogranin, synaptophysin, TTF-1,
PAX-8, CDX-2 & Thyreoglobulin were negative. The glands were rem-
iniscent of lactational-breast-tissue but since ER&PR-receptors were neg-
ative, a final diagnosis of tubular apocrine adenoma was reached.
Case-2: Microscopically, inside the Rokitansky-tubercle, we identified a
0.6cm carcinoid tumour (chromogranin & synaptophysin positive) with
insular-growth-pattern. The Ki-67 proliferation-index was 4% and mitotic
activity was low (1 mitoses/10 HPF).
Case-3: Microscopically, the dermal epithelial lining of the cyst
transitioned smoothly to dysplastic mucinous epithelium & a
gastrointestinal-type-mucinous tumour with borderline features.
Case-4: Inside the Rokitansky-tubercle, a 1.6cm squamous-cell-
carcinoma was identified.
Conclusion: Skin adnexal neoplasms in ovarian teratomas are rare. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a tubular apocrine
adenoma reported in the literature.
Our findings in Case-3 are in keeping with the well-established theory
that a subset of ovarian mucinous tumours arise in the setting of
teratomas.
The percentage of somatic neoplasms arising in otherwise mature terato-
mas was 11% in our series, surprisingly higher than originally expected
and therefore we underline the importance of adequate sampling.

“The Blinded Guardian”: clinical relevance of p53-null phenotype in
high-grade serous ovarian cancers
V. Parrella*, C.M. Biatta, M. Paudice, G. Damiano, G. De Luca, A.
Speciale, G. Cerruti, S. Mammoliti, P. Menichini, V.G. Vellone
*Department of Integrated Surgical and Diagnostic Sciences (DISC),
University of Genoa, Italy
Background & objectives: TP53 is known as the “guardian of the ge-
nome” and it is crucial for high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC)
cancerogenesis, usually manifesting with p53-null or p53-overexpressed
immunophenotypes. Clinical significance of the two presentations is
investigated.
Methods: TP53 status was investigated on FFPE specimens with IHC
(Clone DO7, Roche Benchmark®) and Sanger Sequencing (exons 2-11)
in 34 HGSOCs: 16 consecutive cases of p53-null were compared with 18
cases of p53-overexpressed. The impact on overall survival (OS) between
the two groups was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier curves.
Results: Cases with p53-null phenotype showed: 9 nonsense mutations, 4
in-frame deletions, 2 splice variants, and 1 in frame variants while p53-
overexperessed showed 16 missense mutations and in 2 cases no muta-
tion was detected; p53-null patients resulted slightly older, no significant
differences was observed for Stage at presentation and follow-up dura-
tion, 7 p53-null and 3 p53-overexpressed patients died of the disease.
Virchows Arch
P53-null patients demonstrated a significantly worse OS in the first 24
months of follow-up (HRp53-null=6.09; 95%CI: 1.52–24.51).
Conclusion: Aberrant p53 IHC expression was confirmed as a reliable
characteristic of HGSOC. P53-null phenotypes harboured a peculiar set
of mutations leading to an unfavourable prognosis if compared with pa-
tients with p53-overexpression. The functional reason of why p53-null
HGSOC showed an unfavourable prognosis with respect to p53-
overexpressed ones, need further investigation however TP53 status
could be systematically investigated even in light of new target therapies
in future.

Caroti, F. Giannelli, F. Barra, S. Ferrero, V.G. Vellone
*Department of Integrated Surgical and Diagnostic Sciences (DISC),
University of Genoa, Italy
Background & objectives: To investigate the prognostic value of some
of the most widely studied histomorphological and immunohistochemical
factors, easily accessible in every routinely pathology lab set, in endome-
trial carcinoma.
Methods: We enlisted patients who underwent radical hysterectomy for
endometrial carcinoma. The following histomorphological and immuno-
histochemical factors were analysed: histotype, stage, type of infiltration,
desmoplasia, intratumoral necrosis, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes,
lymphovascular space invasion, oestrogen receptor α, progesterone re-
ceptor, Ki67, p53, β-catenin, e-cadherin, bcl-2 and cyclin D1. Primary
endpoints were disease free survival and overall survival.
Results: Out of 206 cases eligible for our purpose, we found 151 low-
grade endometrioid, 20 high-grade endometrioid and 35 non-
endometrioid carcinomas. At univariate analysis, all prognostic factors
excluding tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, e-cadherin, bcl-2 and cyclin-
D1 were significantly associated with disease-related relapse and death.
Multivariate analyses were conducted separately for the histo-
morphological and immunohistochemical factors and showed a signifi-
cant correlation between disease recurrence and non-endometrioid
histotype and low β-catenin expression. Moreover, a significant associa-
tion was observed between disease-related death and non-endometrioid
histotype and low β-catenin expression.
Conclusion: Our study confirms the key prognostic role of histotype in
endometrial carcinoma. While the other histomorphological factors did
not achieve statistical significance, at least tumour grade, stage and
lymphovascular space invasion should be included in the pathologist’s
report as recommended by the Royal College of Pathologists.
Furthermore, in order to improve patient risk stratification, we propose
to include β-catenin evaluation in the report.

Adenomatoid tumours – a ten-year retrospective clinicopathological
study on a rare neoplasm
A.D. Plopeanu*, A. Dema, R. Barna, A. Pascu, B.R. Nataras, S. Taban
*Department of Pathology, Emergency Clinical County Hospital
Timisoara, Romania
Background & objectives: Adenomatoid tumours are rare benign me-
sothelial neoplasms that usually arise both in the female and male genital
tract. The purpose of this study was to give insight into an infrequent
neoplasm.
Methods: This study includes 16 cases of adenomatoid tumours from
both female and male genital tract which were diagnosed in our centre
between 2011 and 2020. Most cases were identified morphologically, but
some specific cases required to be further confirmed
immunohistochemically either by calretinin, D2-40, WT1, CK7 and
vimentin or a combination between these markers.
Results: Of 16 tumours, 9 occurred in the female genital tract and the rest
in males. 5 tumours from the male genital tract presented as mass lesions,
one being diagnosed in an ectopic testicle, whereas 7 tumours from fe-
male genital tract were diagnosed incidentally. The most common loca-
tion for female patients was the uterus body and for male patients the
epididymis. One case was a synchronous tumour with uterine
leiomyosarcoma and a mature ovarian teratoma. Histologically, half cases
had tubular pattern, while the rest were trabecular or cystic. 6 tumours
showed mild to moderate atypia and Ki-67 expression was evaluated in
these cases, but all tumours had values below 1%.
Conclusion: Adenomatoid tumours are uncommon benign tumours that
can be symptomatic most commonly in male patients because of their
localization. Even though they usually present as small incidental masses,
a thorough gross and microscopic examination could reveal even more
cases. This neoplasm is often easily diagnosed, but in cases with unusual
morphological features and nuclear atypia, immunohistochemical
markers like calretinin, CK7, D2-40 and WT1 should be used in order
to exclude other differential diagnoses.

V. Michelis
*Pathology Department, General Hospital of Thoracic Diseases “Sotiria”,
Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: The estimated incidence and mortality in
Europe of corpus uteri cancer in the year 2020 was 6.9% and 31.3%
respectively. The aim of our survey was the evaluation of DNA ploidy
as predictive and prognostic factor in patients with EC.
Methods: Endometrial samples freshly resected from 168 women who
underwent total abdominal hysterectomy were studied. The cytological
diagnosis was confirmed by pathologists. Cytological imprint smears
were obtained by touching the cut surface of fresh cancer tissues and
stained with Feulgen stain.
Results: According to our results, in terms of quantitative estimation of
cellular DNA, all case-control samples from proliferative, secretory and
atrophic endometrium (total number 15) were exclusively diploid
(DNAindex 0.9-1.1), while at least 82% of Grade 3 (total 39/168) tu-
mours present an euploidy of DNA (DNA index <0.9 or >1.1) as opposed
to about of 44% of Grade 1 (total 52/168) and Grade 2 (total 77/168)
endometrial carcinomas. Furthermore, regarding the DNA intex, the ploi-
dy balance, the degree of hyperploidy and its proliferation index, ob-
served a statistically significant difference between all malignant lesions
as well as between benign and malignant lesions (P<0.05).
Conclusion: We believe that the use of the quantitative assessment of
cellular DNA may help identify tumours with high malignant potential
and possible aggressive behaviour or ability relapse offering valuable
information, both in prognosis and in the treatment of patients with EC.
According to international literature, aneuploidy is an independent prog-
nostic marker of relapses, a sign of malignant transformation and can
therefore predict a poor prognosis.

Placental infection with SARS-CoV-2 in an asymptomatic pregnant
woman
M. Rodrigues*, C. Ivanova
*Hospital Distrital de Santarém, Portugal
Background & objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic raised attention to
the possible complications of the disease during pregnancy. Meanwhile,
no consensus has yet emerged as to the placental morphological features
Virchows Arch
of this viral infection. We propose to describe a case of SARS-CoV-2
positive pregnancy.
Methods: A 28yo primigravida with asymptomatic COVID-19, presented
with reduced foetal movements at 35W,5D of gestation. A pathological
cardiotocography prompted a C-section. The female live birth had low
weight for gestational age, respiratory distress and bradycardia, Apgar 2/7/
9, and was negative for SARS-CoV-2. A week after neonatal unit admis-
sion, she fully recovered. The placenta was sent to pathologic examination.
Results: It was received a monochorionic and monoamniotic, discoid
placenta, with 18x17x2cm and 338g (weight below the 25th percentile
for gestational age), mild opaque, yellowish foetal membranes, a
normocoiled umbilical cord with 31x1.2cm, paracentral insertion and
three vessels. Examination of the cut surface showed a central area of
infarction, with 4cm in the greatest dimension. Microscopically, the pla-
cental parenchyma showed accelerated villous maturation, diffuse and
severe chronic histiocytic intervillitis, areas of organized infarction, fibrin
deposition and chorangiosis. Immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2
antibody was performed, showing diffuse villous trophoblastic staining.
Conclusion: The study of the placental pathology could allow us to
understand the complications or eventual defensive mechanisms of the
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chronic intervillitis is an inflammatory response
for this viral infection, as referred in other related studies, and is associ-
ated with worse foetal outcome. Furthermore, the strong immunostaining
in the villous trophoblast cells, a rare feature in asymptomatic COVID-19
cases, raises questions about the possible protective function of this cells
in containing the infection.

Heavy metals exposure decrease the progesterone expression in the
rat myometrium
K. Sikora, M. Lyndin, R. Moskalenko, Y. Kuzenko, A. Romaniuk*
*Sumy State University, Ukraine
Background & objectives: The progesterone receptors (PR) activity in
the uterus helps to regulate critically important reproductive functions in
mammals. However, impaired progesterone production and sensitivity
caused by the exogenous pollutants may lead to unpredictable sexual
health disorders.
Methods: Uterine tissue samples were obtained from adult female rats in
the estrus phase. Before uteruses removal, rodents were randomly divided
into two groups: rats of Group I received HM salts mix (Zn/Cu/Fe/Mn//
Pb/Cr) for 30 days, whereas rats of Group II served as control. The
immunohistochemical investigation was performed utilizing primary an-
tibodies to PR (rabbit anti-PR Monoclonal Antibody – SP2 clone).
Results: The strong positive nuclear PR immunolocalization was found
in almost all myocytes of rat uterine circular and longitudinal muscle
layers of Group II. Compared to the control PR expression, an immuno-
histochemical investigation of rats myometrium of Group I allowed to
detect the decrease of PR-positive muscle cell number (p<0.01). Besides,
the nuclear PR signal intensity in the myometrium was simultaneously
reduced.
Conclusion: Rat myometrium undergoes changes of progesterone recep-
tors level physiological activity due to the prolonged influence of heavy
metals. The pollutants-induced changes contribute to the significant de-
crease of progesterone receptors positive cells and their expression inten-
sity by uterine myocytes, although not reaching the critically low level.

Mismatch repair protein expression in endometrial cancer: are clini-
cians using it?
F. Rosa*, M. Veríssimo Dias, I. Claro, A. Félix
*Instituto Português de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Portugal
Background & objectives: Mismatch repair protein expression (MMR)
universal testing is recommended for endometrial cancer allowing Lynch
syndrome (LS) identification, assists diagnosis, prognosis and guides
treatment but is still mostly unused[1]. We reviewed our recent testing
experience in MMR-immunoexpression (MMR-IHC).
[1] (ESMO guidelines)
Methods: Between 2018 to 2020, we found 478 endometrial carcinoma
(EC) cases and checked the report for MMR-IHC for the 4 MLH1, PMS2,
MSH2, MSH6 proteins and for further molecular studies (methylation
and Next Generation Sequencing/MLPA) of cases with abnormal IHC
testing.
Results: Mean age was 69yrs. (range: 31-92); distributed as
endometrioid(71.8%); serous(9.8%); clear cell(4%); carcinosarco-
ma(6.7%); undifferentiated(4.2%); mixed(3.1%); others(0.4%). Although
universal study is recommended in our hospital since September 2019, only
146 cases(30.5%) had MMR-IHC performed distributed by year as fol-
lows: 20/165(2018); 54/181(2019) and 72/132(2020). 50 cases had abnor-
mal MMR-IHC(34.2%). The loss of MLH1 occur in 74%; PMS2 in 78%;
MSH2 in 22% and MSH6 in 14%. Loss by histological-type:
endometrioid(74%), clear cell(2%), mixed(8%), undifferentiated carcino-
mas(14%), others(2%). Carcinosarcomas(0/32) and serous carcino-
mas(0/47) had normal MMR-IHC. Molecular testing identified 2 cases of
Lynch Syndrome, 2 with MLH1 methylation, 5 without MMR gene mu-
tations and 20 still in evaluation.
Conclusion: The rate of the immunohistochemistry testing in EC
was around 35 % in our hospital, in the last 3 years. The immuno-
histochemical results of MMR evaluation are similar to what is
described in the literature. The rate of confirmation of MMR-IHC
is very low (patients refusal, death) and lengthy. The large absence
of MMR-IHC in the pathological reports may indicate that clinicians
are not using the MMR data.

and Perinatology after V.I. Kulakov" Ministry of Healthcare Russian
Federation, Russia
Background & objectives: Primary ovarian high-grade serous carci-
noma (HGSC) has been classified into 4 molecular subtypes:
Mesenchymal, Immunoreactive, Proliferative and Differentiated. In
2016 R. Murakami et al. proposed the algorithm based on morpho-
logical and immunohistochemical findings to determine them in
histological slides.
Methods: In our study we tested the morphology-based classification
system presented by R. Murakami et al. and compared the results of
manual and neural network-based analysis. The latter identifies the mo-
lecular subtype using both whole slide images and patient sequencing
data from the TCGA database. The agreement between pathologists pairs
were analysed with Cohen's kappa.
Results: The study revealed that convolutional neural network showed
high level of reliability (resulting multi-class accuracy on separate test set
after 40 epochs equals 0.816), whereas the accuracy of morphological
diagnoses was low to moderate (Cohen’s kappa for all pathologists was
0,305 – 0,605). Mesenchymal subtype was diagnosed by pathologists
correctly in 56,1% cases, immunoreactive - in 17,9 %, proliferative - in
21,1% and differentiated subtype - in 25,7%.
Conclusion: Obtained dataset indicates that using only morphologi-
cal criteria to distinguish molecular subtypes of HGSC does not
seem to perform in routine practice. It may be feasible to use arti-
ficial intelligence as a powerful diagnostic tool for molecular
subtyping of HGSC, but the neural network needs a larger sampling
for high precision results.

cases
R. Ayadi*, E. Braham, M. Mlika, F. Sassi, S. Ben Cheikh, A. Ayadi, O.
Ismail, F. El Mezni
*Hôpital Abderrahmane Mami de Pneumo, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Solitary plasmocytoma of the bone is a rare
disease that account for only about 5% of malignant plasma cell tumours.
Infrequently, it is seen in ribs and sternum. The aim is to present clinico-
pathological features of this disease.
Methods: We report a retrospective study of 15 cases of solitary
plasmocytoma diagnosed at our department of pathology between 2004
and 2020. Radiological findings and bone narrow examination does not
show any other localisation. The immunohistochemical study includes
CD20, CD79, CD138, Kappa and Lambda light chain antibodies.
Results: There were 12 male and 3 female patients, aged between 50 and
81 years with a mean of 67. Ten plasmocytoma were localized in ribs,
four in the sternum and one in the scapula. The diagnosis was made on
transparietal biopsy in 13 cases and on surgical resection in 2 cases.
Microscopic examination showed diffuse sheet of monotonous popula-
tion of dark blue round cells, few with eccentrically placed nucleus and
eosinophilic cytoplasm. Bi–nucleated forms were seen. On immunohis-
tochemistry, tumour cells express CD138 in 15 cases, CD79a in 15 cases,
Kappa light chain in 6 cases and lambda light chain in 9 cases. They were
negative for CD20 and CD3.
Conclusion: Solitary plasmocytoma of chest wall is a rare entity with low
specific clinical and radiological expression. The diagnosis is based on
histology with identification of localized tumour composed of monoclo-
nal plasma cells.

Low indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and high CD204 expres-
sion in the tumour microenvironment are independent adverse prog-
nostic factors in mantle cell lymphoma patients
S. Chuang*, W. Chuang
*Chi-Mei Medical Center, Taiwan
Background & objectives: Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)1(+)
dendritic cells and CD204(+) macrophages contribute to immune
regulation in tumour microenvironment, but their clinical signifi-
cance in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is largely unknown. We
studied the prognostic value of IDO1(+) cells and CD204(+) cells
in MCL.
Methods: A total of 127 cases of MCL from Taiwan were included. The
mantle cell lymphoma international prognostic index (MIPI) was calcu-
lated, and a MIPI of 5.7 or higher was considered high.
Immunohistochemical study for Ki-67, MYC, p53, IDO1 and CD204
was performed, and the cut-off for high expression was at least 30%,
20%, 30%, 5% and 5%, respectively.
Results: Ki-67, MYC and p53 were expressed by tumour cells, whereas
IDO1 and CD204 were mainly expressed by dendritic cells and macro-
phages, respectively. Using univariate analysis, high MIPI score, high Ki-
67 expression, high MYC expression, high p53 expression, low IDO1(+)
dendritic cells and high CD204(+) macrophages were significant adverse
prognostic factors (P = 0.00059, 0.026, 0.00080, 0.026, 0.010 and
0.0032, respectively). Using multivariate analysis, only high MIPI score
(hazard ratio (HR) 2.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.66-5.35; P =
0.00026), low IDO1(+) dendritic cells (HR 2.95; 95% CI 1.57-5.54; P
= 0.00076) and high CD204(+) macrophages (HR 2.35; 95% CI 1.29-
4.27; P = 0.0050) were independent adverse prognostic factors.
Conclusion: Here we report for the first time that low IDO1(+) dendritic
cells and high CD204(+) macrophages in the tumour microenvironment
are independent adverse prognostic factors for MCL patients.
Modification of the tumour microenvironment might be of therapeutic
valve for MCL patients. Future functional studies would be helpful to
clarify the roles of these cells in MCL.

Neoplasm of large B lymphoid cells - a rare central nervous system
lymphoma: analysis of 2 cases

Cozaru, L. Mocanu, A. Toma, M. Deacu
*CEDMOG, Ovidius University, Romania
Background & objectives: Central nervous system (CNS) involvement
by lymphoma is distinctly rare and clinically aggressive. The aim of this
study is to present the clinicopathological features of histopathologically-
proven cases of CNS lymphoma to further characterise this rare entity.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study on Non-Hodgkin
Lymphoma cases from 2015 to 2021 in South-Eastern Romania. To date,
105 cases suitable for our study have been reported and we describe the
only 2 cases of CNS Lymphoma. Further to the histopathological exam-
ination, an immunohistochemical evaluation was mandatory by using
monoclonal antibodies (CD3, CD10, CD15, CD20, CD45, CD79a, Bcl-
2, Bcl-6, Ki67).
Results: Two patients, a 57-year-old female and a 65-year-old male, who
presented clinical and imagistic features of a CNS malignancy, both lo-
calized in the frontal and fronto-parietal lobe. Clinical and imagistic cor-
relations raised the possibility of glioblastoma but histopathological ex-
amination established the diagnosis of CNS lymphoma.
Histopathologically, both cases were characterized by a diffuse prolifer-
ation of medium/high-sized lymphocytes, with a high mitotic rate.
Immunohistochemistry study showed positivity for CD20, CD45, Bcl-
2, CD79a with a high nuclear proliferation marker (Ki67 80-90%), while
the other biomarkers (CD3, CD10, CD15, CD30, EMA) were negative.
These findings established the certainty diagnostic of diffuse large B-cell
central nervous system lymphoma.
Conclusion: Clinical and imaging features of primary CNS lymphoma
and glioblastoma are highly variable and sometimes similar, difficult to
differentiate, and this is why it is important to recognize this entity in
order to avoid misdiagnosis. The morphological evaluation of the pre-
sented cases has confirmed the diagnosis and has ensured adequate treat-
ment and follow-up. The histopathological and immunohistochemical
evaluation played an essential role in establishing the final diagnosis, in
order to determinate the neoplastic proliferation line and the subtype of
lymphoma.

Matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in JAK2-mutated my-
eloproliferative neoplasms
D. Gogoleva*, G. Sychugov
*South Ural State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: The aim of study was to assess the specificity
of expression of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2, MMP9) and
their inhibitors (TIMP1, TIMP2) in JAK2-mutated myeloproliferative
neoplasms (MPN) and their possible correlation with the grade of bone
marrow fibrosis.
Methods: We investigated 55 bone marrow biopsies of patients with
JAK2-mutated MPN. Whole-slide sections were immunostained using
antibodies against MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and scored by
ImageJ plugin software. The same biopsies were silver-stained and
assessed using the semiquantitative bone marrow fibrosis (MF) grading
system proposed by Thiele Jet al.
Virchows Arch
Spearman’s rank-order correlation was calculated. Statistical significance
was set at p<0.05.
Results: MMP2 and TIMP2 expression was observed mostly in mega-
karyocytes. MMP9 expression was observed in neutrophils, macro-
phages, and stromal fibroblastic components. TIMP1 expression was
observed exclusively in stromal fibroblastic components.
Grade of fibrosis was assessed as MF0 in 19/55 (34,5%), MF1 in 15/55
(27,3%), MF2 in 14/55 (25,5%), MF3 in 7/55 (12,7%). The overall num-
ber of cases with fibrosis of any grade was 36/55 (65,5%).
There was weak negative correlation between TIMP2 and the grade of
fibrosis (rho= -0.293, p=0.030, n=55), weak negative correlation between
MMP2 and fibrosis of any grade (rho= -0.299, p=0.027, n=55) and mod-
erate negative correlation between TIMP2 and fibrosis of any grade (rho=
-0.367, p=0.006, n=55).
Conclusion: In a bone marrow MMP and TIMP expression was observed
in megakaryocytes in addition to the typical expression in inflammatory
cells and stroma.
The existence of correlation between MMP regulation and bone
marrow fibrosis is likely to improve understanding of JAK2-
mutated MPN pathogenesis. It may be useful for supporting the
diagnosis, evaluation of prognosis and the development of possible
matrix-targeted treatment.

Precision medicine development and validation of a multi-fluorescent
automated assay to quantify BCL2 and CCND1 expression in CD138
positive bone marrow multiple myeloma (MM) cells
T. Khong*, I. Savvidou, C. Hader, A. Spencer
*Myeloma Research Group, Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, The
Alfred Hospital/Monash University, Australia
Background & objectives: MM remains incurable despite adoption of
novel therapeutics. We describe the development and validation of an
automated platform from bone marrow trephines to identify t(11;14) pa-
tients with overexpression of CCND1 or BCL2 who may benefit from
venetoclax, a BCL2 inhibitor.
Methods: Antigen retrieval (Dako PT Link) were performed on bone
marrow trephines followed by primary antibodies staining (anti-
CD138, anti-BCL2 and anti-CCND1) then specific fluorophores
(CD138–AF647, BCL2–AF594 and CCND1–AF488) on an Auto-
Stainer Link 48 and scanned using Olympus VS120 slide scanner.
Scanned images were assessed by 2 haematologists using the
OlyVIA software (Olympus) and with an automated assay (in-house
ImageJ script).
Results: 41 trephines comprised of 4 cohorts; t(11;14), t(4;14), chr14-
translocation-other-than t(4;14), and MM with normal karyotype/
FISH (normals) were analysed. Comparisons between two
haematologists and the automated script had Spearman correlation
of r=0.974 (CD138), r=0.778 (BCL2) and r=0.6744 (CCND1).
With the automated assay, CCND1 was over-expressed in the
CD138+ cells in the t(11;14) cohort compared to normals
(p=0.02). 50% of the chr14-other cohort over-expressed CCND1
in CD138+ cells, possibly from patients harbouring t(11;14). No
CD138+/CCND1+ cells were observed in the t(4;14) cohort.
Utilising automated quantification and defining low BCL2 expres-
sion as < 28.17% (median-1STDEV); intermediate/high BCL2 ex-
pression on CD138+ cells was identified in 73% of cases and not
restricted to t(11;14) subgroup.
Conclusion: We identified MM patients with CD138+ cells expressing
high CCND1 and/or high BCL2 expression utilising automated triple
immunofluorescent staining of bone marrow trephines. CCND1 and
BCL2 expressions, in accordance with the literature, surpasses the
t(11;14) subgroups defined traditionally by FISH, identifying a larger
cohort of patients that could potentially benefit from the addition of
venetoclax in their therapeutic algorithm.

Can, O. Kirkizlar, B. Binboga Kurt, U. Demirci, A.M. Demir
*Department of Pathology, Trakya University Faculty of Medicine,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an ag-
gressive malignancy of hematopoietic precursor cells. Incidence increases
with age. Although the aetiology is unclear, evolution from a clonal haema-
topoiesis or any other stem cell disorder is most likely in older patients.
Methods: Mutational profile, clinical data and histopathological findings
of 30 patients, diagnosed with AML based on the 2017 update of World
Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid neoplasms were
evaluated. Bone marrow biopsy was done for histopathological examina-
tion. CD34 and CD117 immunoexpression were evaluated on the blasts.
Bone marrow aspiration was used for flow-cytometric analysis and mo-
lecular studies.
Results: Mean age was 64,40 years. 13 were female (43,3%),17 were male
(56,7%). Based on initial clinical evaluation, 18 patients were considered as
de-novo AML (60%), 12 patients as transformed/relapsed AML. Mean
survival was 9,13 months. 12 patients died (40%). QIAact Myeloid DNA
NGS Panel revealed following results: Mutations of TP53 and RAS gene in
7 (23,3%), ASXL1 in 9 (30%), TET2 in 9 (30%), DNMT3A in 9 (30%),
IDH mutations in 7 (23,3%), FLT3 in 6 (20%), SF3B1 in 7 (23,3%)
patients. Among de-novo AML patients (5 cases) with TP53 or RAS
mutation, mean survival was 2,2 months, while in patients without these
mutations, mean survival was 21,57 months (p=0,045).
Conclusion: As a novel and sophisticated method, NGS supports the
clinical assessment of AML patients and contribute to the concept of
individualized prognostic expectation as well as treatment. Particularly
in patients who are otherwise considered as de-novo AML, determination
of clonal haematopoiesis may effect on both treatment, stem cell trans-
plantation as well as follow up decisions.

*Pathology Department, Parc Taulí Hospital Universitari, Sabadell,
Spain; Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain; Institut
d'Investigació i Innovació Parc Taulí (I3PT), Sabadell, Spain
Background & objectives: Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis’ pathogenesis
(LCH) is still debated nowadays between a reactive or neoplastic
aetiology, the latter supported mainly by BRAF p.V600E mutation.
We describe the association between cases diagnosed with LCH in our
entity and their association with BRAF.
Methods: Retrospective observational study of cases diagnosed with
LCH in our institution from 2010 to 2020. Epidemiological data, clinical
course and evolution are collected. Histological preparations are
reviewed, including BRAF antibody (VE1, Roche) by immunohisto-
chemistry (IHQ). Quantitative PCR (qPCR, IdyllaTM) for BRAF is per-
formed in 8 of the 11 cases at the time of writing.
Results: Eleven diagnosed cases of LCH have been collected, 9 in adults
(8 female, mean age: 56 years). Five cases (66%) were associated with
some neoplasm, most of them being solid (75%). In 2 of these 5 cases, the
neoplasm was diagnosed concomitantly with LCH. In another 2 cases the
neoplasm preceded the LCH and in the other one the diagnosis of LCH
was concomitant with the recurrence of the neoplasm.
Of the 11 cases, 6 (54%) were positive for BRAF by IHQ. Of the 8 cases
evaluated by qPCR, 3 (37.5%) showed BRAF mutation (all 3 with
Virchows Arch
immunohistochemical staining), of which 2 were associated with second
neoplasms and poorer prognosis.
Conclusion: Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis is a rare entity of controver-
sial aetiology. It is more frequent in women, and its presentation should
raise the suspicion of a second neoplasm. Its association with BRAF
mutation has been observed by IHQ and by qPCR, which would support
its clonal origin. BRAF-mutated LCH could be more frequently associ-
ated with second malignancies and, thus, worse prognosis.

*Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Nis,
Serbia
Background & objectives: Signal transducer and activator of transcrip-
tion 3 (STAT3) is critically involved in fundamental cellular processes,
including cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis. We investigated
the correlation between STAT3 and intratumoral microvascular density in
primary extranodal diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis of STAT3 expression was per-
formed on tissue samples of 59 patients with primary extranodal DLBCL,
treated with R-CHOP. Microvessel density (MVD) was assessed as a
number of blood vessels per 1 mm2 of tumour tissue, via identification
of endothelial cells by immunostaining to CD31. Based on the average
value, tumours were divided into low- and high-MVD groups.
Results: Strong expression of STAT3 was found in 37.3% of cases, while
high MVD was observed in 52.5% of the tumours. STAT3 overexpression
was significantly associated with high MVD in the tumour microenviron-
ment (p=0.001). Moreover, STAT3 was strongly linked to non-GCB
immunophenotype of DLBCL, determined by Hans’ immunohistochemi-
cal algorithm (p=0.002) and poor overall survival of the patients (p<0.001).
Conclusion: Our study indicates that strong STAT3 immunoexpression
in primary extranodal DLBCL is firmly associated with increased
intratumoral angiogenesis determined by MVD. This suggests that
STAT3 positive cases of this aggressive disease may benefit from
antiangiogenic therapeutic strategies.

Haematology Department, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research
Institute of Oncology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory
Medicine, Poland
Background & objectives: Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a
T cell neoplasm with uniform CD30 expression, loss of T cell antigens,
and the presence[ALCL-ALK(+)]/lack[ALCL-ALK(-)] of ALK fusion
gene. Recently, MYC expression was identified as an adverse prognostic
factor that IRF4/MUM1 could modulate.
Methods: We included in the study 39 cases of ALCL: 25 (64%) ALCL-
ALK(-).and 14 (36%) ALCL-ALK(+). All cases were revised according
to the WHO diagnostic criteria. The immunohistochemical assessment
included expression profile of CD30 (Ber-H2,RTU,Agilent/Dako),
IRF4/MUM1 (MUM1p,RTU,Agilent/Dako), and MYC (Y69,1:100,pH
9.0,Abcam) on ALCL cells. The CD30 and IRF4/MUM1 were evaluated
as positive/weak/negative cases and MYC as low/high "expressors".
Results: The CD30-IRF/MUM1-MYC expression profile in the ALCL-
ALK(-) vs. ALCL-ALK(+) groups showed minor differences. All cases
were CD30 positive, but ALCL-ALK(+) demonstrated a higher percent-
age of weak expression (14.3% vs. 8.7%). Strong IRF4/MUM1 was
exhibited in 87% of ALCL-ALK(-) and 76.9% of ALCL-ALK(+) cases.
Low vs. high expression of MYC was seen in ALCL-ALK(-) and ALCL-
ALK(+), respectively: 47.8% vs. 52.2% and 61.5% vs. 38.5%. High
MYC "expressors" were accompanied by stronger CD30 (94.1% vs.
81.3%) and IRF4/MUM1 (94.1% vs. 73.7%) reactions.
Conclusion: ALCLs, both ALK(-) and ALK(+) show a high level of
IRF4/MUM1 and MYC expression profile. It is essential since
IRF4/MUM1 targets immunomodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide
which has a clinical impact on patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas.
Also, single studies reported the importance of MYC in stratifying or
predicting the prognosis. We believe that further analysis, including clin-
ical data, will be the crucial point of evaluating IRF4/MUM1 and MYC
expression as prognostic biomarkers.

Athens, School of Medicine, “Attikon” University Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) consti-
tute a group of clonal expansions of hematopoietic stem cells. Our objec-
tive is to investigate the immune landscape in bone marrow biopsies from
patients with intermediate/high risk MDS, and its role in the outcome of
5-Azacytidine treatment.
Methods: The study population consists of 82 patients treated with 5-
AZA. BM specimens before (n=82) and during treatment (n=31) were
immunostained for CD3, CD8, CD20 and CD138 for T, cytotoxic T, B
and plasma cells respectively. Positive cells were counted in 5 areas with
the highest density of CD8 cells and all cell counts were normalised to
100.000μm2 of tissue area.
Results: In biopsies before treatment, the presence of lymphoid aggre-
gates significantly correlated with high densities of CD8+ T and B
cells (p=0.013 and p=0.035 respectively). In addition, higher CD3+
T cell densities also significantly correlated with increased overall
survival (OS) (p=0.016), overall response (p=0.035) and complete
remission (CR) (p=0.035). Moreover, higher plasma cell density
was found in patients that eventually transformed to AML
(p=0.022). In biopsies after treatment, higher BM cellularity was
negatively correlated to OS (p=0.009), whereas responders showed
decreased cellularity (p<0.001). Moreover, responders in general,
as well as complete responders in particular showed decreased
CD8+ T cell densities (p=0.010 and p=0.026, respectively) in
follow-up biopsies.
Conclusion: Our preliminary results indicate that the density of cells of
adaptive immunity in the bone marrow specimens may significantly con-
tribute to both response and survival of high risk MDS patients treated
with 5-AZA.

Background & objectives: Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma
(PMBL) and nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin lymphoma (NSCHL)
are the most common primary mediastinal B- cell lymphomas, which share
similar clinical and histopathological features. We compare the T-cell pop-
ulations in their microenvironment (TME) using immunohistochemistry.
Methods: Twenty-five cases were retrieved from the archives of our
Department, 13 histologically diagnosed as PMBLs and 12 as mediastinal
NSCHLs. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) with two cores per case were con-
structed and immunohistochemistry with CD4, CD8 and FOXP3 antibod-
ies was performed. CD4+/CD8+ ratio, FOXP3+ cell percentage, eosino-
phil and mast cell densities were evaluated. A statistical analysis using
IBM SPSS Statistics v25 followed.
Results: CD4+/CD8+ lymphocytic ratio, FOXP3+ cells, eosinophil and
mast cell densities were significantly higher in NSCHL (p<0.05).
FOXP3+ cells were negatively associated with eosinophil density in
NSCHL (r=-0.676, p<0.05). In PMBL, CD4+ cell percentage of total
TME cells was positively associated with FOXP3+ cell percentage
(r=0.889, p<0.01). Interestingly, in three (3/13, 23.1%) PMBL cases,
FOXP3 positivity was observed in neoplastic B-cells, as well. In these
cases, staining intensity was variable, often weak to moderate, in a pro-
portion of positive cells ranging from almost 50 to 90% of the total
neoplastic population. In addition, a positive association was found be-
tween mast cell density and CD8+ cells (r=0.585, p<0.05) in PMBL.
Conclusion: Our findings exhibit a clear difference between the TME of
the two entities. Globally, T4 cells are predominant in NSCHL and T8
cells in PMBL. FOXP3+ T-cells are more abundant in NSCHL than in
PMBL. There seems to be an interaction between T8 cells and mast cells
in PMBL, which needs further investigation. The observation of FOXP3+
neoplastic B-cells in a subset of PMBLs should be established in larger
series, as well as its possible clinical and biological significance.

Background & objectives: Guidelines to assess PD-L1 expression in
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have been published.
However, interpretation is challenging and time consuming. The aim was
to develop a computer-assisted evaluation of PD-L1 expression and com-
pare to the visual assessment.
Methods: 37 samples from HNSCC patients from the Colombian cohort
of the InterCHANGE study (IARC) were included. TMAs were con-
structed and Immunohistochemistry with PD-L1 (22C3-PharmDx-
Agilent/Dako) was performed. The Combine Positive Score (CPS) was
assessed independently by five pathologists. Their scores were compared
to digital scores obtained by a machine learning-assisted methodology
using QuPath (v0.2.3).
Results: PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥1) was 89% (33) and 97% (36) in the
visual and digital assessment, respectively. CPS ≥20 was more frequently
seen in the digital methodology (78%) than in the visual scoring (40%).
Visual and digital CPS scores showed a spearman correlation coefficient
of 0.7146 (p=0.0001), and there was a moderate agreement between the
pathologist scores and the digital ones when grouped into ranges (<1, ≥1-
19, ≥20) (weighted-kappa of 0.4127, p=0.0003).
Conclusion: We show a high prevalence of PD-L1 expression in
HNSCC as previously reported. There was a substantial correlation
between the visual and digital scores. However, some cases (3) reported
as negative (CPS <1) by the pathologists were detected as positive by the
digital methodology. We consider that digital assessment of PD-L1 ex-
pression is feasible and especially helpful when evaluating cases that are
close to a cut-off score. However, this requires an excellent digital slide
resolution and exclusion of artifacts.

*Tata Memorial Centre, Homi Bhabha National University, India
Background & objectives: Adamantinoma-like Ewing sarcoma (ALES)
is a rare malignancy characterized by EWSR1-ETS related fusions and
epithelial differentiation. ALES is being increasingly recognised in the
head and neck. We aimed to study the clinicopathologic spectrum of
ALES diagnosed at our institute.
Methods: A retrospective review of the clinical and pathologic features
of all ALES cases was performed after confirming the diagnosis.
Results: Seven patients were analysed. The age range was 7-44 years (4
males; 3 females). Tumours were distributed in the maxilla (n=2), parotid
(n=2), nasal cavity (n=1), alveolus (n=1), and thyroid (n=1). Tumour size
was 1.6-5.5 cm. Tumours had infiltrative edges, monomorphic cells,
nested-lobular architecture, and interlobular fibrotic stroma. Cells were
round (n=4) /basaloid (n=3). Palisading (n=3), squamous differentiation
(n=2), keratinization (n=1), follicle-like cysts (n=3), calcification (n=4),
necrosis (n=5) was observed. On immunohistochemistry, cytokeratins
(100%), p40 (100%), CD99 (100%), and synaptophysin (57%) were
positive; markers for NUT/SMARCB-1 deficient/myoepithelial/ lym-
phoid/myoid/melanoma were negative. EWSR1 rearrangements were
identified in 5/5 patients who were tested. One patient developed recur-
rence; 3 developed metastases.
Conclusion: ALES is a rare and aggressive malignancy that mimics
diverse neoplasms common in the head and neck region. Awareness of
the morphologic and immunohistochemical spectrum of this tumour is
essential to avoid diagnostic errors.

*University of Health Sciences, Kartal Dr.Lütfi Kırdar City Hospital,
Department of Pathology, Istanbul, Turkey
Background & objectives: Fibrinoid accumulation in larynx and in time
results with overgrowths. Mucosal epithelium may proliferate downward
to organize and remove the fibrinoid accumulation. This study focused on
the fibrinoid substance accumulation and the mechanisms of the associ-
ated squamous epithelial proliferation.
Methods: Five hundred and seventy-five laryngeal nodules re-examined
and 111 of them with varying degrees of irregular downward squamous
epithelial proliferation included to study. Immunohistochemically for
CK5/6, CK17, CK14, collagen type I, collagen type III, collagen type
IV, and fibrinogen was performed. The modified Masson's trichrome
method was used for histochemical staining of collagen.
Results: Some of the nodules showed acute lesions having mostly
subepithelial fibrin accumulation and oedema. The relatively mature le-
sions mostly contain dense collagen fibres. The intensity of collagen type
III was inversely proportional to the amount of fibrin accumulation.
Collagen type IV was found only in the epithelial and vascular basement
membranes. The decrease in fibrin staining intensity and presence of
collagen type I and type III indicates the replacement of fibrin with col-
lagen. Basal-type keratins show more pronounced staining in the
Virchows Arch
regenerated areas of the epithelium. As the laryngeal subepithelial fibri-
noid accumulation was replaced with collagen, the regression of the le-
sion became difficult.
Conclusion: Irregular squamous epithelial proliferation exists indepen-
dent of the stage of the lesion. Although the aetiology is different, the
resulting lesions are histologically similar to those seen in the ligneous
mucosal disease.

Sarcoidosis in metastatic lymph nodes of solid cancer: a fortuitous
discovery and complex association

Njim, R. Hadhri
*Department of Pathology, Chu Fattouma Bourguiba Monastir, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Sarcoidosis is a benign multisystem granu-
lomatous disease. It is being reported to be associated with malignancies,
however, the exact frequency is not yet established.
We tried to evaluate a possible causative association with literature review.
Methods: We report four cases of fortuitous discovery of sarcoidosis in
metastatic lymph nodes of thyroid and breast carcinoma collected over a
period of 4 years in the department of pathology of the university hospital
of Monastir.
Results: All patients were female. Patients ages ranged from 40 to 65
years with an average age of 54 years.
In 3 cases, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made in metastatic lymph
nodes from lymph node dissection in papillary thyroid carcinoma. In the
last case, the diagnosis was made in metastatic lymph nodes from axillary
lymph node dissection for breast carcinoma. No patient has a history of
systemic disease. Histologically, metastatic lymph nodes show a granu-
lomatous inflammation without caseous necrosis. Slight fibrinoid necro-
sis in the centre of some sarcoidotic granulomas has been observed.
Schumann bodies were seen in 2 cases without any astroid body.
Conclusion: Relationships between granulomatosis and cancer have
been described for a long time herefore, it is important for clinicians to
be aware of the simultaneous occurrence of sarcoidosis and metastatic
malignancy, especially when the biopsy shows a granulomatous reaction.
All cancer types can be observed. Hypothesis of a possible association
and a possible increased risk of cancer include the chronic inflammation,
the immune system dysregulation and of sarcoidosis. However, this as-
sociation could be considered as a protective factor against cancer relapse.

Hamchi, T. Dahmoul, S. Hmissa
*Department of Pathology Sahloul Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Ameloblastoma is rare benign tumour of the
odontogenic epithelium. It accounts for only 1% of all jaw tumours and
about 11% of all odontogenic tumours. Our objective is to report the
characteristics of the different types of ameloblastoma and their evolu-
tionary aspect.
Methods: In this work, we included 6 cases of ameloblastoma, collected
in the pathology department at the Sahloul University Hospital in Sousse
(Tunisia), over a period of two years: (January 2019-December 2020).
Results: The sex ratio was 1:5. The average age of this population is 52
years. The mandibular localization represented in 5 cases, including 3
cases at the level of the mandibular angle,1 case at the level of the as-
cending branch and 1 case at the level of the horizontal branch. One
patient had a double mandibular localisation. Macroscopically 3 tumours
were cystic,2 cases were firm and brownish. Histologically,5 cases had a
conventional ameloblastoma including 4 cases in its follicular form and 1
case in its acanthomatous form. The 6th case had unicystic
ameloblastoma. The patient, who presented with dual tumour localiza-
tion, had both a macrocystic ameloblastoma and a conventional follicular
ameloblastoma infiltrating the mandibular bone.
Conclusion: Ameloblastoma expands from the odontogenic epithelium.
The most frequently reported aspect is cystic (90% of cases for 75% of
cases in our work). The architectural variants are in order of frequency -
both in the literature and in our results -: follicular, plexiform,
acanthomatous type and granular cell type. It is a benign tumour with
local development which only very exceptionally degenerates. The treat-
ment is exclusively surgical, justifying a large excision to avoid recur-
rences which require uncertain and mutilating salvage interventions.

The importance of EGFR gene amplification in the malign salivary
gland tumours

P.B. Baltalarlı
*Pamukkale University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Epidermal growth factor (EGFR) is an im-
portant treatment target in several cancers. We aimed to investigate the
contribution of this marker to the prognosis of salivary gland tumours by
analysing the EGFR amplification status of the salivary gland tumour.
Methods: Forty-four cases of salivary gland carcinoma reported at
Pamukkale University between 2001-2021 were included in the study.
These tumours were re-evaluated according to the 2017 WHO classifica-
tion. EGFR amplification was examined in these cases with the FISH
method. Amplification rate ≥15% in tumour cells was considered positive.
Results: Of the 44 salivary gland carcinomas, 21 were adenoid cystic
carcinomas, 20 were mucoepidermoid carcinomas, 2 were acinic cell carci-
nomas, and 1 was salivary gland ductus carcinoma. EGFR amplification
wasobserved ina total of6(13.6%); 3(6.8%) of them were mucoepidermoid
carcinoma, 2(4.5%) were adenoid cystic carcinoma, 1(2.3%) was salivary.
gland ductus carcinoma(p=0.072). EGFR amplification positivity was seen
in 67%(4/6) of stage 1 cases, 83%(5/6) in cases <65 years old, and 67%(4/6)
in women. The disease-free survival time was shorter in male
patients(p=0.001), patients with neck dissection(p=0.007), patients with
metastatic lymph nodes(p=0.011) and angiolymphatic invasion(p=0.013).
Mortality rate was higher in patients with EGFR amplification(p=0.032).
Conclusion: EGFR mutations in salivary gland tumours are rare, how-
ever, EGFR amplification has been reported in the literature at a rate of 5-
14%. We found the EGFR amplification as 13,6% in this study. EGFR
amplification is common in early-stage and female patients under 65
years of age and the mortality rate is higher in these cases. Our findings
should be supported by more studies.

*Federal University of Ceará, Brazil
Background & objectives: Adenolipomas are rare benign neoplasms
composed of mature adipose tissue and glandular elements. We report a
case of a adenolipoma coexisting with follicular variant papillary thyroid
carcinoma.
Methods: A 55-year-old woman presented with multinodular and en-
larged thyroid in neck ultrasound. Computed tomography revealed a thy-
roid with heterogeneous parenchyma by nodules, the largest in the right
lobe, with apparent fat content, measuring 2.0 cm. Fine needle aspiration
(FNA) of one of the nodules was suspicious for papillary thyroid carci-
noma (Bethesda category V). The patient underwent total thyroidectomy.
Virchows Arch
Results: Gross examination revealed a nodular and bumpy thyroid gland.
Cut surface featuring a dull and whitish nodule with 1,2 x 1,0 x 0,9 cm, in
right lobe. There were brown gelatinous colloid nodules exhibiting var-
iegated size, the largest measuring 2,0 cm in greatest dimension, situated
in the same lobe and showing soft and yellowish areas. Histologically, the
features were consistent with follicular variant papillary carcinoma and
adenolipoma in addition to multinodular hyperplasia.
Conclusion: Only few cases of lipoadenomas of the thyroid have been
reported in the literature. Its origin is unknown; a number of authors
explain it as an abnormality arising during thyroid encapsulating or from
fibroblast metaplasia following hypoxia. The coexistence of adenolipoma
and follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma as different lesions is a
rare occurrence. However, it doesn't complicates the evolution and treat-
ment. Surgical resection of thyroid adenolipoma is curative with no re-
currence or malignant potential.

Relationship of E-cadherin, Beta-catenin, N-cadherin, ZEB1
and αSMA as epithelial mesenchymal transition markers
with prognostic factors in early and advanced stage laryngeal
squamous cell carcinomas
U. Kucuk, S. Ekmekci*, C.K. Talu, Y. Pekcevik, I. Cukurova
*University of Health Sciences Turkey, Tepecik Research and Training
Hospital, Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: To investigate the relationship between
E-cadherin, Beta-catenin, N-cadherin, ZEB1 and αSMA as epithe-
lial mesenchymal transformation markers with tumour stage,
lymph node metastasis and overall survival in laryngeal squamous
cell carcinomas.
Methods: A total of 100 cases diagnosed with laryngeal squamous cell
carcinomas in our hospital between 2013-2020 were included in the
study. Data about lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, necrosis
and lymph node metastasis were recorded by evaluating hematoxylin-
eosin stained slides. Markers of E-cadherin, beta-catenin, N-cadherin,
ZEB1 and αSMA were applied to the sections prepared from paraffin
blocks of tumour samples.
Results: Ninety-five male and five female patients were included in
the study, and 38 of them exited. The average overall survival time
of the cases was 35.8 months. A significant relationship was ob-
served between overall survival with advanced tumour stage, pres-
ence of lymph node metastasis and perineural invasion. A signifi-
cant relationship was found between increased tumour Zeb1 expres-
sion and advanced tumour stage. In univariate and multivariate anal-
yses, a significant negative relationship with overall survival, and
increased Zeb1 expression in tumour and tumour stroma was seen.
Any relationship was not observed between E-cadherin, beta-caten-
in, N-cadherin and αSMA and overall survival.
Conclusion: Among the epithelial mesenchymal transformation markers
we evaluated in our study, it was seen that Zeb1, which is an epithelial
mesenchymal transformation transcription factor, is associated with tu-
mour stage, lymph node metastasis, and overall survival. Remarkably,
Zeb1 expression observed in tumour stroma was also significant for over-
all survival. Any similar data reported for laryngeal squamous cell carci-
nomas have not been encountered in the literature, and it was thought that
it would be appropriate to support our findings with further studies to be
performed on this subject.

Primary laryngeal angiosarcoma with neuroendocrine marker ex-
pression, metastatic to lymph node: a case report
A. Elwy*, M. Maher, N. Magdy
*Pathology Department, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University,
Egypt; Shefaa Al-Orman Oncology Hospital, Luxor, Egypt
Background & objectives: Primary laryngeal angiosarcoma (AS) is
among the rarest laryngeal sarcomas. AS is an aggressive vascular tumour
that usually metastasizes via the hematogenous route, while lymphatic
spread is uncommon. A few recently reported AS cases showed an aber-
rant neuroendocrine marker expression.
Methods: A 37-year-old male patient complained of left side neck swell-
ing. Computed Tomography revealed small soft tissue mass at the left
pyriform fossa and ipsilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient
underwent biopsy of the mass and lymph node and diagnosed elsewhere
as neuroendocrine carcinoma with lymph node metastasis. The patient
admitted to the oncology-clinic and the paraffin blocks were requested for
review.
Results: Microscopically, the pyriform fossa mass biopsy showed
fragments lined focally by stratified squamous epithelium infiltrat-
ed by malignant neoplasm, formed of anastomosing vascular
channels lined by high-grade multi-layered endothelial cells. The
lymph node biopsy revealed a metastatic neoplasm, exhibiting a
biphasic morphology. The predominant pattern was solid sheets of
highly pleomorphic epithelioid cells, and the other pattern was
similar to the mass biopsy. Immunohistochemically, the tumour
cells of both biopsies were diffusely positive for CD31 and
ERG, while negative for CD34. However, the epithelioid cells
in the lymph node were positive for CK, Synaptophysin and
CD56. The final diagnosis was laryngeal epithelioid angiosarcoma
with neuroendocrine differentiation and ipsilateral cervical nodal
metastasis.
Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report-
ed case of angiosarcoma combining three rare conditions; the
unusual laryngeal location, the initial presentation by nodal me-
tastases and the aberrant NE marker expression. This unusual
immunoexpression represents a challenging diagnostic pitfall that
pathologists should be aware of to avoid misdiagnosing AS, es-
pecially the epithelioid variant, as poorly differentiated neuroen-
docrine carcinoma.

Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. A clinicopathological study in
a 10-year period
G. Galanopoulos*, L. Karelis, E. Souka, G. Stanc, H. Trihia, C.
Valavanis, O. Tzaida
*Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma
(CXPA) reported in the literature ranges from 1.5% to 14% of all salivary
gland tumours. We study the frequency of CXPA recorded in the
Department of Pathology of Metaxas Cancer Hospital in a 10-year period.
Methods: Over the last decade, 22 cases of malignant tumours were
identified among 276 salivary gland specimens examined. The age range
was between 34 to 78 years.
Results: Out of these 22 cases, 4 of them consisted of CXPA and the rest
were distributed as mucoepidermoid (6), adenoid cystic (5), acinic cell
(1), squamous cell carcinoma (2), adenocarcinoma NOS (3), and
cystadenocarcinoma (1). Regarding the CXPA cases, two of them
showed histopathological features of adenoid cystic carcinoma and the
rest were myoepithelial carcinomas. In all cases residual element of pleo-
morphic adenoma (PA) was demonstrated at least in small part of the
tumours.
Conclusion: PA is the most common salivary gland tumour, representing
about 50% of all primary salivary gland neoplasms, followed by Warthin
tumour. Although local recurrence is usual, a malignant transformation is
rare. The incidence of malignant salivary gland tumours in our material is
8% with CXPA accounting for only 1.5%. The mean patient age was 67
years. Since various carcinoma subtypes can be encountered, misdiagno-
sis is common.

The diagnostic value of the extemporaneous examination in thyroid
surgery
I. Helal*, A. Hmidi, F. Khanchel, M. Ben Thayer, E. Ben Brahim, R.
Jouini, A. Chadli-Debbiche
*Habib Thameur's Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The extemporaneous-examination (EE) al-
lows to obtain a rapid diagnosis of benignity or malignancy of Thyroid
nodules and to avoid abusive initial surgery. However, its efficiency and
limits remain controversial. Our study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic
value of the EE.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective study, carried out from January
2016 to June 2017, of EE performed on thyroid resection specimens at
Habib Thameur hospital. We compared the results of the EE to final
histological examination (FHE). The diagnostic value of EE was evalu-
ated by calculating sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive
value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV).
Results: 319 EE have been included, 190 (59.5%) were benign, 41 (13%)
were malignant and in 88 of the cases (27.5%) the response was delayed.
Among the 190 nodules considered benign on EE, 168 were truly benign
on EHD while 22 results were malignant. Among the 41 EE malignant
lesions, 39 were carcinomas: papillary (91%), vesicular (6.5%), medul-
lary (1%) and undifferentiated (1%). The specificity was 98.8% with a
PPV of 95.12% and the sensitivity was 64% with a NPV of 88.4%. The
delayed results were benign in 64%, malignant in 34% and lesions of
uncertain malignancy in 2%. The diagnostic efficiency of EE was 65%.
Conclusion: Our study confirmed the perfect sensitivity of the EE with
excellent VPN. However, its low specificity is mainly linked to the diag-
nostic difficulties of encapsulated tumours with vesicular architecture and
to technical problems such as difficulty in handling fresh tissue.

*Department of Pathology, University Hospital of Ostrava, Faculty of
Medicine, University of Ostrava, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk
University Brno, Czech Republic
Background & objectives: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) is a cancer with squamous differentiation arising from mucosal
epithelium in the oral cavity, tongue and oropharynx. It is the 6th most
common cancer in the world with mortality 4-6/100000 people.
Methods: We have retrospectively analysed cases of 487 patients in age
29-85 years with HNSCC who underwent curative surgery with bilateral
cervical block dissection in period 2006-2016. We focused on the evalu-
ation of stage (AJCC2017), nodal status, PNI, BVI and LVI. Moreover,
we added new parameters such as the mode of invasion, the worst pattern
of invasion, tumour budding a lymphocyte infiltration.
Results: Most of our cases exhibited 3rd degree of MOI (288cases) or 4th
degree of WPOI (212cases). PNI was present with an increasing frequency in
both of these classifications of tumour growth - MOI3: 17%, MOI4: 32,6%,
MOI5: 50% and WPOI3: 12,9%, WPOI4: 26,9% WPOI5: 55,6%. Tumour
budding (LG: less than 5 buds, IMG: 5-10 buds, HG: more than 10 buds)
correlated with the incidence of PNI, 85% HNSCC with PNI developed HG
budding. Brisk (49,5%) and non-brisk (42,9%) immune response presented
by TIL correlated with these morphological signs. Moreover, we evaluated
the morphology of PNI with following incidence: type A(1%), type
B(58,6%), type C(31%), type D(6%), type E(6%), type F(0%).
Conclusion: Here, we focused mostly on PNI occurrence, morphology of
PNI and other negative morphological prognostic factors in HNSCC
patients. Our study revealed an association between PNI and other
analysed common diagnostic factors as well as newly selected morpho-
logical features. Next, we plan to focus on cellular and molecular pro-
cesses accompanying the initiation of PNI with aim to uncover main
cancer characteristics and possible involvement of neural
chemoattractant.

Cribriform adenocarcinoma of the minor salivary glands: an entity
on the rise
D. João*, A. Sanches, C. Meireles
*Department of Anatomic Pathology, Centro Hospitalar de Vila Nova de
Gaia/Espinho, Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Cribriform adenocarcinoma of the minor
salivary glands, or cribriform variant of polymorphous adenocarcinoma
according to the current WHO classification, is a rare tumour of the head
and neck, with increasing evidence of histopathological and prognostic
features distinct from conventional polymorphous adenocarcinoma.
Methods: We present the case of a 91-year-old male without relevant
medical history. He was referred to our institution due to a painless tu-
mefaction in the mouth floor, detected by the caretakers two days before.
Physical examination revealed a well-defined, mobile and elastic tumour,
measuring up to 4cm and covered by intact but erythematous and papil-
lomatous mucosa, which was biopsied.
Results: On histopathological examination, a malignant epithelial neo-
plasm was found within the submucosa, lined by preserved epithelium.
The tumour was comprised of solid or microcystic nests of neoplastic cells,
displaying peripheral retraction artifact and a fibrous surrounding stroma.
Nuclei were round, clarified and with vesicular chromatin, sometimes with
nuclear crowding. Immunostaining showed heterogeneous positivity for
CK5/6 and CK7 and diffuse and strong positivity for S100 and SOX10, in
the absence of expression of SMA, D2-40, p40 and TTF-1. From these
findings, the patient was diagnosed with cribriform variant of polymor-
phous adenocarcinoma. This is a rare and still mysterious entity and we
reviewed the most recent findings in medical literature.
Conclusion: There is still much debate if the cribriform adenocarcinoma
of the minor salivary glands is a separate entity from polymorphous
adenocarcinoma, a variant or if they are both part of a same morphologic
spectrum. Both harbour genetic changes in the PRKD1, PRKD2 and
PRKD3 genes, although these are essentially translocations in the former
and somatic point mutations in the latter. Most importantly, cribriform
adenocarcinoma metastasizes more frequently to the cervical lymph
nodes (50% at presentation), requiring lymph node dissection.

*Department of Anatomic Pathology, Centro Hospitalar de Vila Nova de
Gaia/Espinho, Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related
multiphenotypic sinonasal carcinoma is a recently described tumour of
the sinonasal tract which displays both characteristics of salivary gland
and surface-derived carcinoma and is linked to high-risk HPV.
Methods: We report the case of an 86-year-old male with a destructive
lesion involving the hard palate, maxillary sinus, nasal fossa and left
frontal sinus. Histological, immunohistochemical and molecular testing
were performed on the biopsy specimen. This case report includes a
review of the most recent medical literature.
Virchows Arch
Results: Morphological evaluation revealed a basaloid neoplasm infil-
trating the mucosa, with a nested and cribriform architecture. It was com-
prised of cells with round, hyperchromatic and vesicular nuclei and scarce
eosinophilic cytoplasm. There were abundant mitoses and apoptotic bod-
ies. Immunostaining was positive for p16, CK5/6, CK7, BerEP4, Bcl2
and SOX10 and negative for S100, GFAP, calponin, synaptophysin,
calretinin and TTF1. Molecular testing detected the presence of high-
risk HPV. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with
HPV-related multiphenotypic sinonasal carcinoma.
Conclusion: Previously known as HPV-related carcinoma with adenoid
cystic carcinoma-like features, this entity is a potential diagnostic pitfall
with high grade adenoid cystic carcinoma. Morphologic range is wider
than initially thought and not all cases display basaloid features. Although
p16 is a useful screening tool, definitive diagnosis requires HPV-specific
testing. Correct diagnosis is crucial, since despite frequent presentation at
high stages and exhibition of high-grade cytological features, its behav-
iour is remarkably indolent, with rare metastasization and no reported
tumour-related deaths.

Effect of blood corticosterone concentration on mast cell degranula-
tion in the mesentery in rats after maxillofacial surgical trauma
I. Kastyro*, M. Kostyaeva, S. Dragunova, A. Kosyreva
*Peoples’ Friendship University of Russia, Russia
Background & objectives: The release of glucocorticoids by the adrenal
cortex reduces the immune response, but degranulation of mast cells
(MC) can increase, provoking the release of inflammatory mediators.
Objective. To study the relationship between MC degranulation and
blood corticosterone concentration after trauma to rats nasal septum (NS).
Methods: Wistar rats were simulated with septoplasty using zoletil 100
(5 rats). 5rats were a control group (CG). After surgery, the rats were
determined the concentration of corticosterone on the 2nd, 4th, 6th days
and then sacrificed, stained the mesentery on a slide with toluidine blue.
mast cells with varying degrees of degranulation (0-3) were counted in 20
visual fields.
Results: On the 2nd, 4th, 6th days after surgery, the number of mast cells
of type 0 significantly decreased (24.12±2.88; 13.22±1.87;14.88±2.84),
compared with the control group (CG) (40.45 ± 2.21) (p<0.001). The
number of MC type II on the 4th (2.87±0.31) and 6th (2.27±0.47) days
decreased, but the number of MC type III increased (1.87±0.11 and 1.61
±0.1, respectively), compared with the control (type II - 1.3±0.17; type III
- 0.8±0.13). After septoplasty, compared with CG (38.56±2.12 ng/ml),
corticosterone increased on day 2, and on day 4 (122.55±5.38 ng/ml) and
6 (118.35±5,69ng/ml) decreased and maintained its stable blood concen-
tration (p<0.001).
Conclusion: An increase in the degree of mast cell degranulation coincides
with an increase in the concentration of corticosterone in the blood plasma
in rats 4-6 days after surgery. When simulating a surgical trauma in the
maxillofacial region, the release of glucocorticoids can provoke the devel-
opment of general inflammation, including in the mesentery, which is
confirmed by an increase in the number of mast cells of grade III
degranulation.

Immunohistochemical criteria for pathological transformation of
cells of nasal cavity mucous membrane in case of recurrent inverted
papillomas
I. Korshunova, V. Popadyuk, A. Chernolev, I. Kastyro*
*Peoples’ Friendship University of Russia, Russia
Background & objectives: In 8-10% of cases inverted papillomas (IP) in
situ, papillomavirus DNA(HPV) is detected. Aim. Identification of im-
munohistochemical criteria for pathological cells transformation of nasal
cavity (NC) mucous membrane (MM) in case of recurrent IP using ex-
pression of the Ki-67 marker.
Methods: Materials and methods. Ki-67 & HPV-positive cells were de-
termined in NC mucosa. As an indicator of proliferative activity, the Ki-
67 proliferation index was used, which was determined in each row of
cells by fractions of stained nuclei, expressed in %.
Results: Dysplastic processes of MM surrounding the IP at an average
distance of up to 0.5 cm and identified in all our observations were
characterized by a general proliferative activity of epithelial cells of
17.25±4.11%, which was higher (p<0.01) than proliferation cells in un-
changed epithelium, with hyperplasia of MM and with IP. Most
immunopositive cells were localized in 2nd row of cells, with recurring
IP Ki-67-positive cells were found in the basal and parabasal layers.
HPV-positive immunostaining was detected in individual nuclei of in-
fected cells of the basal and parabasal layers. HPV elements were detected
in actively proliferating basal and parabasal IP layers and their relapses.
Conclusion: HPV elements in IP and their relapses were identified. This
indicates their role in the formation and relapses of nasal cavity IP. In all
studied preparations, pronounced Ki-67 expression was observed in the
nuclei of proliferating cells.

Comparison of morphological changes during modeling of bone tis-
sue damage and after implantation of a titanium implant in the upper
jaw in rats.
S. Dragunova, M. Kostyaeva, I. Kastyro*, V. Popadyuk
*Peoples’ Friendship University of Russia, Russia
Background & objectives: Morphological changes against the back-
ground of inflammation during manipulations in dental surgery can lead
to various complications-pain, implant rejection, etc. Aims. To compare
morphological changes during modelling of bone tissue damage and dur-
ing implantation of a titanium implant in the rats maxilla.
Methods: Under anaesthesia with zoletil 100 to 30rats, a bone socket was
formed between the incisors and molars on one side. In 1group(15
rats),implantation was not performed, and in 2group(15rats), titanium
implants were screwed in. Five animals from both groups were sacrificed
on days 2,4,6 after surgery, the damaged parts were placed in a
decalcifying solution, and then were stained with H&E.
Results: Around the dead tissues in both groups, there is a reactive in-
flammation limiting them. In the demarcation zone, full-blooded vessels,
oedema, leukocyte shaft, multiplying cells of connective tissue, which is
involved in the formation of the demarcation shaft, were found. The
collagen fibres were swollen and impregnated with fibrin, forming dense
homogeneous masses.
Conclusion: Damage to bone tissue, both with and without implantation,
leads to the development of typical reactions of necrosis and inflamma-
tion. The simple application of damage to the upper jaw with a boron in
rats can be considered as an analogue of the implantation model.

Sciences, Moscow, Russia
Background & objectives: A 38-year-old female was diagnosed with a
left carotid paraganglioma (CPGL). The patient had undergone surgery
for tumour resection. Histopathology of the resected specimen was con-
sistent with paraganglioma of carotid origin with lymph node metastasis.
Methods: We performed exome sequencing of tumour, lymph node me-
tastasis, and normal tissue from the patient. Exome libraries were pre-
pared using the TruSeq DNA Exome Kit (Illumina, USA). Paired-end
Virchows Arch
sequencing of libraries (76x2) was performed on an Illumina NextSeq
500 System. The search for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants was
carried out using GATK HaplotypeCaller.
Results: Exome analysis revealed no pathogenic/likely pathogenic vari-
ants in known susceptibility genes for paragangliomas/
pheochromocytomas (RET, FH, VHL, NF1, SDHx, SDHAF2,
TMEM127, MAX, EGLN1, HIF2A, MET, and KIF1B). Somatic likely
pathogenic frameshift mutations in the OR2T7, CTU2, LMTK3, HLA-
DRB1, CBS, and FAM83H genes, as well as missense mutation in the
EIF2AK3 gene, were found in both tumour and metastasis samples.
Notably, in the metastasis sample, we detected variants in many genes
that were not mutated in the primary tumour.
Conclusion: According to the literature, one of the main factors, indicat-
ing risk for metastatic paragangliomas/pheochromocytomas, is the SDHB
mutation. However, in the study case, we have not identified variants in
any known susceptibility genes. In primary tumour and metastasis, we
detected common somatic likely pathogenic variants in six genes, when
much more novel genes were mutated only in metastasis. Identified genes
affected by metastasis-specific mutations and mutations shared between
primary tumours and metastases can be potential drivers of metastatic
progression.

Golovyuk, A. Snezhkina, A. Kudryavtseva
*Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of
Sciences, Moscow, Russia
Background & objectives: Vagal paragangliomas (VPGLs) are rare tu-
mours of the head and neck that arise from paraganglionic tissue sur-
rounding the vagus nerve. More than twenty susceptibility genes associ-
ated with the PGLs are currently known. However, oncogenic somatic
events have been poorly investigated.
Methods: The exome sequencing and analysis of 16 tumour and normal
tissues derived from the patients with VPGLs were performed. Exome
libraries were prepared using the TruSeq DNA Exome Kit (Illumina,
USA) and were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 System with
the paired-end mode, 76x2 reads. Somatic pathogenic/likely pathogenic
variants were identified using GATK HaplotypeCaller.
Results: We analysed 16 exomes from patients with VPGLs on the pres-
ence of somatic mutations in the SDHx genes. Three somatic likely path-
ogenic variants were revealed in the SDHB gene in a patient: frameshift
variant NM_003000: c.308_309insTAAG, p.M103fs (chr1: 17355209),
missense variant NM_003000: c.A307G, p.M103V (chr1: 17355211),
and frameshift variant NM_003000: c.304_305insATGAT, p.A102fs
(chr1: 17355213). Pathogenicity of the missense variant was predicted
by all in silico prediction tools (PolyPhen2, LRT, SIFT, and others); the
variant was also characterized by a high conservation score according to
PhastCons.
Conclusion: Mutations in the SDHx genes, encoding for subunits of
succinate dehydrogenase, are typically associated with the hereditary
PGLs when somatic variants in these genes are very rare events. In the
study cohort, we found one patient with somatic likely pathogenic vari-
ants in the SDHB gene. The patient did not carry any germline variants in
the known susceptibility genes. Thus, these somatic variants appear to be
a driver event in the development of the tumour.

Expression of CK 17 in squamous laryngeal carcinomas
D. Koumoundourou*, N. Mastronikolis, S. Lygeros, P. Ravazoula
*Patras University Hospital Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: Cytokeratins are proteins of the cytoskeleton
with diverse expression in several epithelial neoplasms.
The purpose of the present study is the detection of CK17 expression in
squamous laryngeal carcinomas and its correlation with several clinico-
pathological parameters.
Methods: CK17 expression was studied in 58 cases of squamous laryn-
geal carcinomas (24,1% Grade I, 50% Grade II, and 25,9% Grade III) For
every patient included in the study there was a mean follow up time of 30
months during which 27 (46,6%) patients died from their disease.
Statistical analysis was interpreted using SPSS16 for windows.
Results: CK17 expression was strongly correlated with tumour Grade
(p=0,028) with loss of its expression in high-Grade tumours. In multivar-
iate (Cox regression) analysis the correlation between absence of CK17
and adverse patients’ outcome approached borderline (p=0,056).
There was no significant association between the presence of CK17 with
either tumour size or positive cervical lymph nodes. The adjacent normal
epithelium was CK17 negative while low expression of the protein was
detected in dysplastic areas.
Conclusion: Our results agree with the existent literature which suggests
that high expression of CK17 predicts poor patients' prognosis. Our find-
ings indicate that CK17 is associated with early malignant transformation
and might be a suitable marker for detecting the presence of dysplasia.
Furthermore, the protein may be a prognostic factor in squamous carci-
nomas since its expression is lost during tumour progression and may
have a key role in predicting worse patients' outcome.

*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Centro Hospitalar e Universtário de
Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Dysgenetic polycystic disease (DPD) is a
benign rare cystic lesion arising from distal ductal system salivary glands,
primarily affecting the parotid glands, mainly the superficial lobe. It is
more prevalent seen in young females, usually with bilateral involvement.
Methods: We report a case of a 48-year-old woman with complains of a
slowly progressive and non-painful bilateral parotid gland swelling, pos-
teriorly to the angle of the mandible, since childhood. Recently she
complained of a sudden increase in size and associated dull, aching and
continuous pain.
Results: Control magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed
bilateral enlarged parotid glands, almost completely occupied by
multiple cysts, some with septa and others confluent, of “pure con-
tent”, the largest on the left side with 4.4 cm. Multiple fine needle
aspiration (FNA) were performed always with the diagnosis of simple
cyst (The Milan System - category II). She was submitted to partial
parotidectomy and histopathological evaluation revealed multiple
cysts of varying sizes some interconnected, replacing the parotid
parenchyma with lobular architecture preserved. The cysts were lined
by a flattened cuboidal epithelium with no atypia. Short, finger-like
epithelial septations extended into lumen were found, as well as pro-
teinaceous, eosinophilic and calcified material.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of DPD of parotid gland was made. Cystic
lesions in the parotid gland may represent an array of diverse entities with
Virchows Arch
distinct biological behaviour and other cystic lesions must be considered
in the differential diagnosis. DPD is a unique entity that resembling other
polycystic diseases that affect the kidneys and pancreas, however there
seems to be no association between them. Long-term follow-up is re-
quired to rule out recurrence and to screen for the involvement of other
salivary glands.

Human papilloma virus type 16 expression in pleomorphic adeno-
mas and adjacent tissue of salivary glands
M. Myroshnychenko*, I. Brodetskyi, O. Dyadyk, V. Malanchuk
*Kharkiv National Medical University, Ukraine
Background & objectives: Pleomorphic adenoma (PA) is one of the
salivary gland (SG) tumours. The role of human papilloma virus (HPV)
in this tumour development is ambiguous. The objective is to determine
the HPV type 16 expression in PA and SG adjacent tissue.
Methods: Two groups were formed. Group 1 (G 1) included 4 cases with
an intact SG (autopsy material). Group 2 (G 2) included 30 cases (surgical
material) with SG PA of mesenchymal (n=15), mixed (n=15) and epithe-
lial (n=5) histological variants. Immunohistochemical reaction (IHCR)
was performed, using mouse monoclonal antibody (MCA) to HPV type
16 (clone CAMVIR-1, «Diagnostic BioSystems», USA).
Results: IHCR was negative in G 1 and positive in G 2 in 26 cases
(86.7%). In G 2 nuclear expression of MCA to HPV type 16 was found
in tumour parenchyma (epithelial cells formed nests and cords, solid,
trabecular, cystic, glandular, ductal, tubular structures; myoepithelial
cells) and stroma (vascular endotheliocytes; immune and fibroblastic
cells; myxoid and mucoid zones cells). In adjacent SG tissue, the ductal
epithelial cells, myoepithelial cells expressed this MCA. IHCR in PA and
SG adjacent tissue was the most pronounced, pronounced, moderately
pronounced, respectively, in epithelial, mixed, mesenchymal tumour var-
iants. In all PA variants, IHCR was less pronounced in SG adjacent tissue
compared to PA tissue.
Conclusion: The positive expression (in 86.7% of cases) of MCA to
HPV type 16 in pleomorphic adenomas tissue and adjacent tissue of
salivary glands indicates that HPV type 16 may be one of the causes of
such tumour development. The results obtained by the authors are of great
therapeutic and prognostic significance.

SALL4 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma and its possible
involvement in oral carcinogenesis
A. Ouban*
*Alfaisal Uni. College of Medicine, Saudi Arabia
Background & objectives: SALL4 plays important roles in cancer. This
study analyses the expression of SALL4 in oral squamous cell carcinoma
(OSCC), link it to characteristics of OSCC patients and assess the expres-
sion of a closely-linked protein, Beta-catenin, in the same population.
Methods: This study analysed the expression of SALL4, using immuno-
histochemistry, in a tissue microarray of 50 oral squamous cell carcino-
mas (OSCCs) and 10 normal oral mucosal tissue from the oral cavity.
Clinic-pathological parameters of the patients were assessed in relations
to SALL4 expression in those tissues. Moreover, an Epithelial-
Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) phenomenon-linked protein, Beta-
catenin’s expression was analysed in the same microarray.
Results: A significant majority of oral squamous cell cancers exhibited
positive expression of SALL4 protein. All of the OSCC tumours
expressed SALL4 in their cytoplasm and nuclei. The overall majority of
those same tumours exhibited an aberrant expression of Beta-catenin,
where a shift of expression of Beta-catenin from their membranes to the
cytoplasm and nuclei was noted. This study presents evidence of an
aberrant co-expression of SALL4 and beta-catenin in OSCC cells. With
the current findings and with past evidence of SALL4 modulating the
Wingless/Wnt/Beta-catenin pathway in other tumours, it suggests a sim-
ilar regulatory role for SALL4 in OSCCs.
Conclusion: SALL4 is a uniquely qualified candidate for therapeutic
intervention in OSCCs, first because it is missing in normal adult
cells, and secondly because of its triple involvement in OSCC de-
velopment, EMT phenomenon in OSCCs and tumour’s stemness.
This may provide a rare opportunity to roll back the dismal course
of this disease.

The role of mu (μ) and kappa (k) opioid receptors in the carcinogen-
esis and prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma: an immunohis-
tochemistry retrospective study

A.E. S. O. Lima, A. C. Andrade, I. S. Guedes
*School of Medicine, University of Fortaleza, Brazil
Background & objectives: Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) is the
mouth’s most prevalent tumour. Opioids may be involved in carcinogen-
esis while helping symptoms management in advanced cases. The objec-
tive is to analyse the influence of opioids receptors in the progression of
oral cavity carcinomas.
Methods: Cross-sectional, observational and retrospective study which
considered 25 samples of oral mucosa from healthy patients, 25 samples
of squamous dysplasia and 50 samples of SCC. Tissue Microarray was
performed for immunohistochemistry with anti-receptor μOpioid and
kOpioid antibodies. Immunostaining was evaluated with ImageJ® soft-
ware. Socio-demographic and survival data were analysed from medical
records.
Results: There was an increase in immunoexpression of both μOpioid
and kOpioid receptors in dysplasia and SCC. A lower expression of
μOpioid was observed in T1 tumours when compared to the other T
stages. Patients who died showed a more prominent immunodetection
of kOpiod in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the survival rate of patients
with low cytoplasmic expression for κOpioid is greater than in those with
high expression. Clinical characteristics such as sex, age, smoking histo-
ry, alcohol consumption and site of the primary tumour didn't influence
the immunoexpression for opioid receptors.
Conclusion: This was the first study to characterize the
immunoexpression of opioid receptors in the healthy mucosa compared
to dysplasia and oral SCC samples. The study demonstrated an increase
of the receptors in SCC and the influence of the Kappa receptor on
patients' survival expectations. Therefore, it is necessary to study the
mechanisms by which these receptors act in carcinogenesis and tumour
progression.

Romaniuk*
*Sumy State University, Ukraine
Background & objectives: The aim is to study the biophysical features
of stone formation in structurally altered tissues of the salivary glands.
Methods: In our investigation 20 tissue samples of SG with biomineral
formations were used in the study by histological method, scanning elec-
tron microscopy, statistical analysis.
Results: Sialolites of the salivary glands had an elongated oval shape,
ranging in size from 0.3 to 2.0 cm in the largest dimension. Biomineral
formations often had a whitish-grey colour, although there were stones of
yellowish-brown and brown shades. Some small stones were found in the
parenchyma of the salivary gland. The average mineral content in
sialolites averaged 64.33%. The study of the relief of the sialolites section
surface showed a circular deposition of mineral matter on the periphery of
the calculus and a complex pattern of mineralization layers in its core. The
Virchows Arch
following composition of sialolites was determined by electron micros-
copy: Ca-11.66%, P-6.39%, Na-0.47%, Mg-0.23%, S-0.14%.
Conclusion: Formation of SG stones occurs on the background of chron-
ic inflammation and structural rearrangement of glandular tissue.
According to the results of factor analysis, the connection between the
presence of benign or malignant tumours and the process of calcification
(0.83) in structurally altered tissues of the salivary gland was defined.
The stoichiometric ratio of calcium and phosphorus is 1.82.

Malignant salivary gland tumours in South Tunisia: a clinicopatho-
logical study of 40 cases

Boudawara, R. Kallel
*Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Malignant salivary gland tumours (MSGTs)
are very rare representing 3% of all cancers of the head and neck. They
greatly vary in origin, subtype, and behaviour. The purpose of this study
is to review the clinicopathological features of MSGTs.
Methods: Forty cases of MSGTs diagnosed in our department of pathology,
were collected from January 2010 to December 2020. These tumours repre-
sented 20.9% of the total number of salivary gland tumours. An analysis of
the clinical and histological data was carried out in all cases.
Results: The mean age of patients was 52.72 years (16 - 86 years). The
parotid gland was the commonest location (21 cases, 52.5%). The sub-
mandibular and sublingual glands accounted for 3 cases (7.5%) each, and
minor salivary glands for 8 cases (20%). On histological examination,
adenoid cystic carcinoma was the most frequent type accounting for 9
cases (22.5%) followed by acinic cell carcinoma in 8 cases (20%),
mucoepidermoid carcinoma in 7 cases (17.5%), carcinoma ex pleomor-
phic adenoma in 6 cases (15%) and polymorphous carcinoma in 5 cases
(12.5%). Adenocarcinoma NOS, lymphoepithelial carcinoma and poorly
differentiated carcinoma were found each in 2 cases (5%) and salivary
duct carcinoma in 1 case (2.5%).
Conclusion: Malignant salivary gland tumours are one of the most diffi-
cult areas of diagnostic pathology, with significant morphological diver-
sity and many overlapping features. The principal hurdle in the manage-
ment of these tumours is the difficulty in distinguishing them from benign
tumours. They demonstrate an unpredictable clinical course marked by
frequent locoregional recurrence and distant metastasis.

Background & objectives: Identifying pathogenic variants in the BRAF
gene is important in various ways. Therefore, we aimed to study the
V600E mutation of the BRAF gene among patients with papillary carci-
nomas in the Mongolian population.
Methods: A total of 46 patients with PTC collected from 2017 to 2019 at
the National Cancer Center of Mongolia. DNA extractions from
Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded and fresh thyroid tumour tissue were
extracted using a genomic DNA kit. ABI 3730xl genetic analyser was
used to identify DNA sequencing.
Results: Out of the PTC cases, 38 (82.6%), 6(13%), 1(2.2%), and
1(2.2%) cases were classic, follicular, oncolytic, and tall-cell variants,
respectively. BRAFV600E alteration was found in 9(19.6%) of 46 cases
that were diagnosed as classic papillary variants, histopathologically. The
mutation was not relative to the patients’ age or gender (p>.005). In terms
of clinicopathological features such as tumour stage, capsular and vascu-
lar invasion, histological type, lymph node metastasis, extra-thyroid in-
vasion, and tumour location were not different between 2 groups (with or
without BRAFV600E mutations)(p>.005).
Conclusion: BRAFV600E mutation was detected in 19.6% of PTC cases
in our study. There was no correlation between BRAFV600E mutation
and increased PTC aggressiveness in the study.

Sinonasal intestinal-type adenocarcinoma showing contralateral in-
testinal metaplasia: a morphological and immunohistochemical
study
C. Taverna*, A. Franchi
*Department of Translational Research and of New Technologies in
Medicine and Surgery, University of Pisa, Italy
Background & objectives: Intestinal metaplasia (IM) can be present in
the sinonasal mucosa adjacent to intestinal type adenocarcinoma (ITAC),
possibly being a step in the development of these neoplasms. Herein we
examined the mucosa contralateral to the tumour to identify areas of IM.
Methods: Nineteen patients (17 males, 2 females), age ranging between
44 and 89 years (mean 63.7), affected by unilateral ITAC treated with
bilateral surgical approach were enrolled. The series included 3 well
differentiated, 12 moderately differentiated, 1 poorly differentiated and
3 mucinous ITACs. Ethmoidal mucosa contralateral to the tumour site
was morphologically and immunohistochemically analysed using
cytokeratin 20 and CDX2.
Results: In 3 cases (15,7%) we observed foci of IM in the sinonasal
mucosa of the opposite side of the tumour, with no evidence of dysplasia.
Metaplastic areas involved both the surface and glandular epithelia.
Conclusion: A subset of sinonasal ITAC patients simultaneously shows
foci of IM in the contralateral ethmoid mucosa, suggesting that IM could
be associated with chronic environmental exposure and supporting the
idea that the concept of “field cancerisation” could be applied to the
development of ITAC in the sinonasal tract.

*Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Patras,
Greece
Background & objectives: The aim of this study is to describe the
epidemiology of primary eyelid tumours over a 20-year period, based
on patient data derived from a Tertiary University Hospital in Greece.
Methods: A computerised retrieval system was used to identify all patients
who underwent eyelid mass excisions with histological reports, encountered
during the years 2000-2019. The demographical (age, gender), clinical and
histological features along with the pathological diagnosis of each patient
were documented. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed on the data.
A total of 157 eyelid tumours comprised the study sample.
Results: Sixty-five (41.4%) malignant cases and 92 (58.6%) benign cases
were identified. The most frequent benign diagnoses included cyst (25%),
nevus (19.6%), squamous papilloma (11,96%) and seborrheic keratosis
(8.7%). Malignant tumours included basal cell carcinomas (92.3%), squa-
mous cell carcinomas (4.62%) and melanomas (3.08%). The main variants
Virchows Arch
of the basal cell carcinomas were: nodular (41.7%), nodular cystic (15%),
ulcerative (15%), infiltrative (13.5%) and basosquamous (6.7%). Benign
eyelid lesions occurred with equal frequency in the upper and lower eyelids
(43.5%). Malignant lesions were more frequently located in the lower eye-
lid (61.5%) compared to other areas. The mean age at diagnosis was 70 (38-
86) years for malignant and 50 (4-96) for benign lesions.
Conclusion: In this Greek cohort, benign eyelid lesions affected mostly
working-age individuals, and malignant lesions occurred predominantly
in elderly patients. Te majority (60%) of the patients with malignant
tumours were females. Males and females were equally affected by be-
nign lesions. Among the malignant lesions, basal cell carcinoma was the
most common type, with lower eyelid involvement in the majority of
cases. The clinical and histological features of the tumours varied among
the different variants.

Features of TIMP1 expression for different types of periodontitis
V. Zakharava*, L. Kazeko, J. Benesh, E. Cherstvoy
*Belarusian State Medical University, Belarus
Background & objectives: Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease,
leading to progressive destruction of the tooth-supporting apparatus and
to tooth loss. The dysregulation between an activity of matrix metallo-
proteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMP) plays an important
role in progression of inflammation.
Methods: Objective. To study features of TIMP1 expression in patients
with different types of periodontitis.
A gingival biopsy was analysed from patients with aggressive (AgP,
n=16), chronic simplex (CSP, n=3), chronic complex (CCP, n=23) peri-
odontitis, and a control group (n=6). Morphometric and statistical analy-
sis of the TIMP1 expression was performed using AperioImageScope
v12.4.0.5043, Statistica10, p<0.05.
Results: The expression of TIMP1 in the biopsy was obtained in all
patients with different forms of periodontitis, both in the gingival epithe-
lium and stroma. There was a statistically significant increase of epithelial
and stromal levels of TIMP1 in all groups of periodontitis compared to
healthy tissue (p˂0.05). At the same time, the lowest levels of both epi-
thelial and stromal expression were found in the CSP group, increased in
the AgP (p˂0.01) and were highest in the CCP group (p=0.001). In the
AgP group, compared with the CCP, there were lower levels of intensity
and the proportion of strong and moderate intensity pixels (p˂0.03) of
epithelial and stromal expression of TIMP1.
Conclusion: A increase in epithelial and stromal expression of TIMP1
with a dysregulation of MMPs expression in different types of periodon-
titis compared to the healthy tissue supports its importance in the patho-
genesis of periodontal inflammation. At the same time, an even greater
decrease in TIMP1 expression in the group of aggressive periodontitis
compared to chronic complex periodontitis may explain the high aggres-
siveness of its course and can be used in the differential diagnosis of these
forms at the disease manifestation stage.

Pathological findings of the 1918-1919 “Spanish” influenza from the
autopsy reports of the Santi Giovanni e Paolo Hospital in Venice
L. Ferrari*, G. Capitanio
*Division of Pathology, Cardinal Massaja Hospital, Asti, Italy
Background & objectives: The ancient autopsies reports are kept at the
Santi Giovanni e Paolo Hospital in Venice. An archive search was carried
out to valuate the pathological findings of the Spanish flu from autopsy
descriptions.
Methods: The cases reporting diagnosis named as “flu broncho-
pneumonia” have also been selected since 1918. In Venice, be-
tween 1918 and 1919, 1669 autopsies were performed, respective-
ly 807 in 1918 and 862 in 1919. The autopsies were performed
only on deceased in the hospital, not on people deceased in their
own home.
Results: The first case of Spanish flu in Venice dates back to 26th
September 1918. The autopsy was performed on a 46-year-old male
who died at Santi Giovanni e Paolo Hospital. The last was reported
on 19th January 1920, remarkably associated with Encephalitis
lethargica. The cases reporting flu bronchopneumonia are 169. The
reports describe a haemorrhagic bronchopneumonia, splenic reactive
hyperplasia and blood congestion of kidneys and liver. These path-
ological findings were similar to those already described in a similar
archive research performed at the Pathology Department of the
University of Turin.
Conclusion: The autopsy reports of Santi Giovanni e Paolo Hospital
of Venice confirm the temporal distribution of deaths following the
pandemic trend of Spanish flu. The pathological findings are com-
parable to those described in literature, confirming the relevance of
old autopsy reports as historical documentation for the history of
pathology.

Martins, V. Sousa, L. Carvalho
*INMLCF & FMUC & CHLO, Portugal
Background & objectives: 'Urologic Lithiasis' affects mankind since
Antiquity. Currently, despite multiple therapeutic measures, incidence is
rising with high recurrence rate, even in transplanted kidneys. Authors
aim to draw attention to study the resources kept in the "Museum of
Anatomical Pathology" in Coimbra.
Methods: Retrospective study of specimens kept in the Coimbra
Museum was performed, searching for the different characteristics of
urological calculi. Photographs were taken and comparison with literature
was applied.
Results: Ninety (n=90) sets of calculi corresponding to single
stones or aggregates of calculi gathered in containers or hangers,
varied in their form, colour and consistency. Topography was
registered: renal (n=14), bladder (n=64), urether (n=3); as well
as composition: calcium (n=2), cistine (n=2), uric acid (n=3),
struvite (n=2).
Conclusion: Etiopathogenic factors underlying urolithiasis are multiple,
ranging from infection, dehydration, diet to metabolic syndrome and
genetic background. Increased longevity and alimentary habits change,
among other risk factors, favour higher incidence, both in adults/elderly
and children. During lithiasic patients’ clinical workup evaluation, con-
sensus studies have shown the importance of crystalluria and calculi
morphoconstitutional analysis. This XIXth century Museum collection
is available for Medical Students and Residents to review urologic calculi
and correlate with patients symptoms. Other areas of Science are
welcome.

Pirogov made an important contribution to the development of patholog-
ical anatomy. In 1837 N.I. Pirogov published a work: "Annals of the
surgical department of the clinic of the Imperial University in Dorpat".
Methods: In "Annals" N.I. Pirogov, included a collection of case histo-
ries, arranged in sections depending on the type of diseases, summarizing
articles. There were also forty-eight topics related to the pathological
anatomy of surgical pathology. The Annals revealed the features of the
operative technique, they became the basis for clinical and morphological
analysis, which is currently a tool of pathological anatomy.
Results: N.I. Pirogov wrote: "It is my sacred duty to tell the readers
frankly about my medical activity and the results of it, since every con-
scientious person, especially a teacher, should have a kind of inner need,
perhaps, rather to publicize his mistakes in order to warn other people
against them." Pirogov considered self-criticism to be a method that could
improve the results of clinical practice.
According to Pirogov's Annals, doctors should analyse their professional
mistakes, enriching their experience and the cumulative experience of
medicine.
Pirogov compared the data of clinical examinations with the data of
autopsies, in fact, it was about clinical anatomical conferences.
Conclusion: Pirogov's attitude to medical errors prompts us to deepen the
meaning of this maxim in moral and ethical terms. Anyone who stops at
the pessimistic and apathetic statement "medical errors are inevitable" is
in the position of ethical surrender, which is immoral and unworthy of the
title of a doctor.

Prognosis and prediction in medicine and pathology in a historical
context
S. Mozgovoi*, E. Abrosimova, A. Kononov
*Omsk State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: Prediction and prognosis (forecast) are two
overlapping and coexisting terms in modern medicine. Notions about the
prognosis of a disease primarily imply the nature of its natural course, and
the term «predicate» reflects rather the probability of response to
treatment.
Methods: The scientific works devoted to prognostics and predication
(prediction) are analysed, starting with Hippocratic's «Prognostic» and end-
ing with modern works dedicated to 4p and 5 p-medicine. Scientific articles,
philosophical definitions, data of dictionaries were analysed according to
basic definitions about prognosis as the nature of the current and the out-
come of the disease and prediction as possibility of «predict» pathologies.
Results: The evolution of the predictive approach in medicine from an-
cient times to modern research is considered. It has been established that
the prognosis existed from the very beginning in two directions: as a
prediction of the outcome of a disease and as an assessment of the risk
of a disease, the ability to anticipate and prevent its development. The
modern prognostic approach is based on individualized conception of the
person and his individual reaction to the treatment, which is especially
relevant in the development target treatment of tumour diseases. It is in
this context that prediction seems to be considered in modern times.
Conclusion: Prognosis in medicine is a specific historical concept that
evolves together with the development of the principles and values of
medical discourse: from a general understanding of human, disease and
organism to maximum individualization. The relevance of the term pre-
diction, related to the breakthrough in individualizing the treatment of
tumour pathologies, characterizes one of the stages of development of
prognostics approach.

M.C. Rocha Muniz, J.S. Pereira Filgueira, A. Vidal Alves, D. Nunes de
Melo, J. Carneiro Melo
*University of Fortaleza, Brazil
Background & objectives: The History of Pathology has guiding prin-
ciples shared with all other medical specialties. In Ceara, the pathways
that defined it were marked by challenges and important achievements.
This study seeks to review the History of Pathology in Ceara.
Methods: The present study consists of a literature review. The search for
articles was conducted in the PubMed, Scielo and Lilacs databases. Literary
works on the subject were also considered. The descriptors History,
Pathology, Medicine and Ceará were applied, utilizing the boolean operator
and. The period from 2010 to 2021 was set as the search limit.
Results: In Ceara, the evolution of medical care has been marked, for a
long time, by the lack of means to prevent diseases. At first, the introduc-
tion of studies focused on Pathological Anatomy faced challenges, which
included rudimentary equipment and inadequate facilities. In 1949, the
first Pathological Anatomy laboratory was set up, beginning the task of
providing anatomopathological diagnoses. The first systematic research
in Pathological Anatomy was on visceral leishmaniasis, during an endem-
ic period. The introduction of routine necropsy services allowed a rapid
change in the quality of the services provided. In early 2021, the first
autopsy using the Minimally Invasive Autopsy (MIA) technique was
performed in the state.
Conclusion: It is indisputable that anatomopathological reports, obeying
pathogenetic and chronological aspects, are instruments for a better under-
standing of the diseases. It is necessary to promote the training of pathol-
ogists with professional qualifications who, inspired by the pioneers of the
past, can contribute to the development of Pathology in Ceara.

Fortuitous discovery of ganglionar tuberculosis in systematic lymph
node dissection for thyroid carcinoma: about 05 cases
M. Ben Thayer*, F. Khanchel, I. Helal, A. Hmidi, R. Jouini, E. Ben
Brahim, A. Chadli-Debbiche
*Department of Pathology, Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Cervical lymphadenopathy in case of neo-
plasia primarily suggest metastatic extension. However, the diagnosis of
tuberculosis should be sought in our population. We aim to study cases of
subclinical lymph node tuberculosis discovered during lymph node dis-
section in surgical management of thyroid carcinoma.
Methods: This is a descriptive retrospective study of all the cases of
cervical lymph node dissection performed as a part of surgical manage-
ment of Thyroid carcinoma(TC). We included lymph node dissections of
patients with TC and no suggestive symptoms of tuberculosis. This study,
carried out at Habib-Thameur’s hospital, collected all the cases of TC
operated on with neck dissection between 2016 and 2020.
Results: We collected 133 samples of lymph node dissections performed
on 133patients. In five cases (3%), we have noted the presence of epithe-
lioid and gigantocellular granulomas suggesting the diagnosis of
ganglionar tuberculosis. They were 5 women aged between 40 and 65
years with a mean age of 51.8+/-8.98 years. The histological type of TC
was papillary carcinoma in all of the five cases. The total number of
lymph nodes removed ranged from 5 to 87 with a mean number of
38.4+/-30.02.
Metastatic lymph node involvement was diagnosed in two patients
among this 5 patients.
Conclusion: Ganglionar tuberculosis (GTBC) is the first extra-
pulmonary localisation of tuberculosis in Tunisia. Its incidence is con-
stantly increasing in our country. Our study prouved that GTBC was
incidentally diagnosed in 3% of lymph node dissection performed for TC.
Therefore, we have to keep this diagnois in mind and systematically seek
the presence of GTBC in all the lymph node dissection performed.

*University of Fortaleza, Brazil
Background & objectives: SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is usually
asymptomatic or milder than in adults. However, severe forms of the
disease can occur. To report a case of acute myocarditis in a child with
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods: Report a case of Acute myocarditis associated with SARS-
CoV-2 infection in a child.
Results: A seven-year-old female child started asthenia, adynamia and
weight loss with about a month of evolution. Two days before death,
persistent dry cough, difficulty breathing, odynophagia and refusal to
eat followed by low fever, two episodes of vomiting and anasarca. She
had cardiopulmonary arrest and died. The autopsy revealed skin paleness,
mild anasarca and evident pediculosis. Macroscopy: slight diffuse cere-
bral atrophy and thrombi in the sigmoid sinuses; cardiac chambers with
dilated cardiomyopathy and intracavitary thrombi, swollen lungs with
small thrombi, shock kidneys. Microscopy: myofibrillar myocardial atro-
phy and myocarditis with liquefactive necrosis of microabscesses. The
lungs had interstitial pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar damage. Kidneys with
tubular injury, spinal congestion. Nasopharynx (RT-PCR) screening for
SARS-CoV-2 was positive.
Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 infection in children can cause acute myocar-
ditis with variable degree of cardiac dysfunction. Pre-existing heart dis-
eases, such as congestive heart failure, contribute to an unfavourable
outcome.

SARS-CoV-2 and placenta: new insights and perspectives
G. Cazzato*, A. Colagrande, G. Ingravallo, L. Resta
*University of Bari "Aldo Moro", Italy
Background & objectives: This case-control study aimed to report the
analysis of a large series of placentas from SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers
observed and to compare them with a control group in order to highlight
any histopathological alterations attributable to SARS-CoV-2.
Methods: Study was made of 83 placentas from 81 pregnant mothers
followed at the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Operative Unit from 15
September 2020 to 31 January 2021, identified through electronic clinical
records. The SARS-CoV-2 group was compared with a Control group of
142 placentas, selected from a population of pregnancy with physiolog-
ical outcome, matched by gestational age and maternal age.
Results: Prevalence of maternal vascular malperfusion were not signifi-
cantly different between cases and controls (54.3% vs 43.7% p=0.19),
whereas the differences in regard to foetal vascular malperfusion (21.1%
vs 4.2% p<0.001) resulted significant. More frequent in cases respect
controls were decidual arteriopathy (40.9% vs 1.4% p<0.0001), decidual
inflammation (32.4% vs 0.7% p<0.0001), perivillous fibrin deposition
(36.6% vs 3.5% p<0.0001) and foetal vessel thrombi (22.5% vs 0.7%
p<0.0001). The Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-S1 glycoprotein antibody re-
sults were significantly different, with 33/51 cases (65%) of diffuse pos-
itivity throughout the examined section and 18/51 cases (35%) of local-
ized positivity, the expression being prevalently in the cytoplasm of the
villi trophoblasts.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrates some more frequent aspects in the
placentas of infected women, in particular maternal thrombosis and de-
ciduous, increased intervillous fibrin and, in rare cases, foetal thrombosis.
The immunohistochemical investigation demonstrates the positivity for
the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibody both among maternal
cells (including inflammatory intervillary cells) and in the trophoblast and
rarely in the endothelium. The ultrastructural investigation demonstrated
both the suffering of foetal endothelia and the presence of particles attrib-
utable to SARS-CoV-2 in the trophoblast.

Entamoeba hystolitica and COVID-19: a potentially fatal synergy
E. Cruz*, T. Franco, D. Pinto
*Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Ocidental, Portugal
Background & objectives: Entamoeba Hystolitica is a protozoon, pre-
dominantly found near the equator, which infects the gastrointestinal tract
of approximately 10% of the world’s population. Most patients are
asymptomatic, but a few suffer from fulminant colitis. At this stage,
mortality is high.
Methods: SARS-CoV-2 is a thrombogenic virus and has been shown to
lead to large bowel ischemia in certain patients. 75 year-old man, former-
ly emigrated to Venezuela, presenting at our emergency department with
severe dyspnea. He had a history of hematochezia and no other relevant
Virchows Arch
priors. The patient was diagnosed with severe COVID-19, admitted to
intensive care and treated with dexamethasone.
Results: During his hospitalization he developed signs of large bowel
perforation and underwent total colectomy, dying in the post-op.
Grossly, large, serpiginous ulcers could be seen throughout the entire
bowel, amidst sections of preserved mucosa. Histologically, the mucosa
was extensively ulcerated. Some of these ulcers were “flask-shaped” and
others associated with areas of transmural necrosis and perforation. In
these areas and at the bottom of the ulcers, countless histiocytoid organ-
isms could be seen. These stained with PAS and Masson's Trichrome and
were negative for CD68 by immunohistochemistry. Hemophagocytosis
was observed. The remaining mucosa was mostly preserved, but focal
ischemic changes were seen, as well as transmural congestion and nu-
merous fibrin thrombi.
Conclusion: A diagnosis of fulminant amebic colitis (FAC) was made,
associated with ischemic changes probably secondary to SARS-CoV-2.
We describe the first case, to our knowledge, of FAC in a SARS-CoV-2
patient showing large bowel changes consistent with involvement by
COVID-19. These changes and steroid therapy, a well know trigger of
FAC, might have had a synergic effect in this patient, enabling the devel-
opment of fatal fulminant amebic colitis. Clinicians should be aware of
this possible complication.

Boudawara, M. Bouhamed
*Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Peritoneal tuberculosis is one of the most
challenging forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis to diagnose. Its poses
a public health problem in endemic regions of the world. The aim is to
analyse the epidemiological and histopathological characteristics of this
entity.
Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in our pathology depart-
ment at CHU Habib Bourguiba of Sfax over 11 years period, between
2010 and 2020. During this time, 43 cases of Peritoneal tuberculosis were
reviewed.
Results: Peritoneal tuberculosis accounts for 5,23% of all cases of tuber-
culosis in our department. Mean age was 45,85 years old (extreme: 10-79
years); with female predilection (F:34 /H:9). In microscopic examination,
granulomatous reaction was composed of epithelioid cells and multinu-
cleated giant cells with variable number of lymphocytes. These granulo-
matous lesions were centred by caseous necrosis in 34 cases overs 43
(79%), the rest were non caseating (21%).
Conclusion: Peritoneal tuberculosis is rare, more common in young
women. Microscopic finding are variable and sometimes slight and un-
certain, especially with non-caseating granulomatous reaction. The histo-
logical examination must be completed with bacteriological studies,
mainly when the clinic presentation suggest the diagnosis.

Nadal, J. Ferreres Piñas, P.E. Dacosta Escobar, L. Naranjo Ruiz-
Atienza, S. Ramón y Cajal-Agüeras, J. Camacho Soriano
*Hospital Vall d’Hebron, Spain
Background & objectives: The placental pathology in pregnant women
with SARS-CoV-2 infection seemed quite nonspecific, describing signs
of maternal and foetal vascular malperfusion, intervillus fibrin deposits,
or inflammation. Recently, trophoblast necrosis has been associated with
SARS-CoV-2 placental infection.
Methods: The sampling of 71 placentas from pregnant women with
active SARS-CoV-2 disease was done according to the Amsterdam
consensus. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for SARS-CoV-2 was per-
formed in all of them. In SARS-CoV-2 IHQ positive cases, in situ hy-
bridization (ISH) and real-time prolimerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of
the placental tissue were also tested.
Results: 90% of placentas were negative for SARS-CoV-2 IHC, while
10% were positive, as well as for ISH and RT-PCR. Regarding the in-
fected placentas, 6/7 showed a stiff appearance with white deposits be-
tween 20 and 90% of the disc and 1/7 had only a chorangioma.
Trophoblast necrosis, increased intervillous fibrin deposition, collapse
of the intervillous space and variable histiocytic intervillitis were ob-
served. IHC and ISH showed granular trophoblast staining. In 5/7, this
lesion affected 80-90% of the disc and was associated to stillbirth. In 2/7,
one showed a focal lesion and the other a 20% involvement of the disc,
and babies were born premature without SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Conclusion: Trophoblast necrosis with collapse of the intervillous space,
increased fibrin deposition, and variable histiocytic intervillitis is charac-
teristic of SARS-CoV-2 placental infection. According to these results,
only diffuse damage to the placental disc is associated with stillbirth. The
histological study of the placentas of pregnant women with active disease
for SARS-CoV-2 in delivery is essential to know the mechanism of pla-
cental transmission and the probable foetal infection.

Morozov
*Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, Russia
Background & objectives: The pathogenesis of a severe course of the
acute respiratory syndrome due to viral COVID-19 infection is not yet
fully understood. Therefore, the aim of the study was to analyse the role
of concomitant diseases in lethal cases of COVID-19.
Methods: Postmortem investigations of the 47 dead bodies performed in
cases of the COVID-19’ fatal outcome. Medical records and clinical data
were studied. The length of hospital stay before death was analysed.
Gross pathology of the lungs, internal organ and brain were examined
and tissue samples were taken for histological examination. Microscopy
of H&E stained slides performed at x10, x20, x40.
Results: Most of the deaths in the study group were men (57,44%).
Hospitalization for less than a day and within 1-3 days accounted for
23,4% of cases each. 21,3% of patients stayed in hospital for 4-10 days
before death. The autopsies have shown characteristic COVID-19-
induced pathological changes in the lungs. Pre-existing chronic disease
included: ischemic heart disease pathology (89,3%), chronic pancreatitis
(61,7%), arterial hypertension (31.9%), diabetes mellitus (21,27%), cere-
brovascular diseases were (17,0%) chronic nephritis (14,9%) and others.
The main histological findings were: alveolar injuries due to microcircu-
lation disorders accompanied with microthrobi formation, systemic in-
flammatory infiltrates, dystophies and necrosis of the parenchymal organs
cells, mainly cardiomyocytes.
Conclusion: Autopsy studies of patients with fatal COVID-19 due to
severe acute respiratory syndrome revealed concomitant multiple features
of cardiac pathology: ischemic and metabolic injury, myocardial inflam-
matory cellular infiltrates, myocyte destruction and microvascular throm-
bi in myocardial tissues, stromal oedema, capillaries hyperaemia. Chronic
pancreatitis, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus occurred with decreasing
frequency. Clinicopathological correlation revealed COVID-19 is consid-
ered to be primary cause of death, however, further research would clarify
the role of comorbidities in the pathogenesis of deaths from this infection.

Background & objectives: Babesiosis is a Ixodes ticks (IT) transmitted
disease caused by Babesia spp. (Bs). It is characterized by severe course,
frequent death in splenectomised people (SEP). The objective is to deter-
mine erythrocytes ultramicroscopic features in SEP affected by Bs infect-
ed IT.
Methods: The study material was blood from 19 SEP. Splenectomy was
performed due to spleen trauma, its rupture and bleeding. Group 1 (G 1)
included 8 people without IT attacks. Group 2 (G 2) included 11 people
affected by Bs infected IT attacks. Slides were stained by Romanovsky-
Giemsa method. Scanning electron microscopy was also performed.
Results: In G 1 and G 2 in blood there were found normocytes, regener-
ative forms and degenerative forms among erythrocytes. In G 1, the relative
numbers (RN) of normocytes, regenerative forms and degenerative forms
were (69.6±2.13) %, (1.5±0.07) %, (28.9±1.16) %, respectively. In G 2, the
RN of normocytes, regenerative forms, degenerative forms were (64.5
±2.18) %, (1.3±0.09) %, (34.2±1.96) %, respectively. Comparative analysis
of the obtained data in G 1 and G 2 did not reveal significant differences
between the indicators. In both groups, intra-erythrocytic and extra-
erythrocytic forms of Bs were not detected, and erythrocytes were charac-
terized by anisocytosis (microcytes and macrocytes were determined) and
poikilocytosis (echinocytes, degmacytes, schistocytes were determined).
Conclusion: Erythrocytes of splenectomised people exposed to Babesia
spp. infected Ixodes ticks do not differ from erythrocytes of
splenectomised people without Ixodes ticks attacks. They are character-
ized by the presence of normocytes, regenerative and degenerative forms
with predominating normocytes and degenerative forms; changes in size
(anisocytosis) and shape (poikilocytosis); absence of intra-erythrocytic
and extra-erythrocytic forms of Babesia spp. despite the detection of
pathogens in the Ixodes ticks.

Background & objectives: Rhinosporidiosis affects humans through
stagnant water, affects usualy the nose. It is curable through surgery
and prophylaxis, but is aggravated if left untreated. Similar diagnoses
include polypoid vascular lesions in unusual locations. This series reports
five cases in northern Brazil.
Methods: A total of five cases with Rhinosporidiosis suspicions were
analysed, by the clinical information and the microscopy of each lesion,
which were obtained by biopsy. It is important to add that two biopsies
were obtained by nose lesions, two were from conjunctival injury and a
single one was a urethral lesion. All of the cases originated in Maranhao,
in Brazil.
Results: Three cases were about infants. The first case was of a 5-year-
old male, with a papillomatous tumour in the right nostril. Another
case showed a 4-year-old female, with a conjunctival injury. The third
one was an 11-year-old male, was a papillomatous lesion in the left
nasal mass, implanted in the anterior nasal vestibule. The last two
were adults, a 36-year-old and 69-year-old, both male. The first one
had a papillomatous conjunctival lesion in the right eye, and the sec-
ond had a urethral injury, with the suspected Human Papillomavirus
(HPV).
Conclusion: Rhinosporidiosis is an uncommon infection and when pre-
sented is seen as nasal cavity lesion. However, in this present study, nasal
mass corresponds to 40% of the cases, and the other 60% of the less
common clinical manifestations include a conjunctival injury (40%) and
a urethral lesion (20%). Histopathological diagnosis is straightforward,
although, since it is uncommon, ample awareness is essential, as typified
by this report.

*Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, Russia
Background & objectives: Tuberculosis (TB) is an infection disease
with high level of fatal outcomes worldwide. TB commonly presents with
systemic involvement of various patient’s organs and tissues.
Extrapulmonary TB often affects pleura, but clinical diagnosis of TB
pleurisy may be misdiagnosed.
Methods: We reviewed needle biopsy specimens of the parietal pleura in
87 patients who had tuberculous pleurisy (TBP) diagnosed in 2015-
2019 at Lugansk Anti-Tuberculosis Dispensary and The Thoracic
Department of the Republican Clinical Hospital. The histological slides
of the pleura stained with hematoxylin, and eosin were studied under
microscope. All accompanying medical documentation with clinical in-
formation analysed.
Results: The TBP diagnosed in 67 male and 20 female patients. The
average age of patients in 2014-2015 was 45, in 2016-2017 - 55, in
2018-2019- 37 y.o. It was also noted that TBP in people 18-30 years
old(y.o.) was diagnosed in 21 cases, 31- 50 y.o.- in 44, 51 - 70 y.o.- in
20, and in people older than 70 y.o. in 2 cases. Acute onset of TBP was
detected in 80% cases and the latent course- in 12%. Main variants of
pleura biopsies’ pathology presented by classic epithelioid-giant cell
granulomas with caseous necrosis; epithelioid-giant cell granulomas
without caseous necrosis; lymphocytic-epithelioid cell granulomas; gran-
ulomas with nonspecific acute purulent inflammation.
Conclusion: TBP is the most common cause of the pleural exudate,
however, to reveal the aetiology of disease may be difficult due to the
lack of adequate clinical symptoms and possible misinterpretations.
Present study revealed the majority of TBP cases within 31-50 y.o. age
group. Histological examination of pleural biopsies specimens has shown
various pathomorphological changes characterizing the tuberculous pro-
cess. In order to improve early diagnosis and substantiate the adequate
treatment further evaluation of clinical and pathomorphological TBP’
features are needed.

Traslacional, HUMV/IDIVAL, Spain
Background & objectives: The placenta is an immunoprivileged organ
with attenuated immune response. Several viruses can cross the placental
barrier and be associated with placental morphological changes and foetal
diseases. Our objective has been to evaluate the placental histopatholog-
ical changes related to SARS-CoV-2.
Methods: We present a series of seven placentas of SARS-CoV-2-
positive women, who had been diagnosed by PCR on nasopharyngeal
swabs, before birth. We provided a detailed histopathological description
of morphological changes found, comparing them with those found in six
placentas from women without infection. Extended immunohistochemi-
cal analysis has been carried out to identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2
in the placental tissue.
Results: The mother's age ranged between 29 and 42 years old. 4 out of
13 placentas were below 40th gestational week. Histomorphological find-
ings range from signs of poor perfusion to inflammatory changes. 3 out of
7 cases with historial of viral infection showed inflammatory changes like
chorionitis, chorioamnionitis and vasculitis, 5 presented signs of
malperfusion such as infarction, subcorionic thrombi and intervillous
thrombosis and 1 did not show any morphological change. Control pla-
centas showed overlapping findings, 5 out 6 presented subcorionic
Virchows Arch
thrombi, intervillous and subcorial thrombosis and central and peripheric
infarcts. The immunohistochemical analysis to demonstrate the presence
of the virus in the placental tissue are pending of study.
Conclusion: The morphological response to viral infections of the
placenta is variable and in some cases well known. In our study,
no differences in findings could be demonstrated between SARS-
CoV-2 infected and uninfected women. In both groups there are
data of poor perfusion and inflammatory changes, which could be
attributed to infection of the placenta and an altered coagulation
state induced by the virus; however, the data are not conclusive
and more studies are needed.

*Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Hydatid disease is an endemic parasitic in-
fection especially around the Mediterranean, caused by Echinococcus
granulosus. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is unusual and
represents 2% of all hydatid locations. In this work is will analyse clini-
copathological features of CNS hydatidosis.
Methods: This work is a retrospective and descriptive study of 9 cases of
CNS hydatidosis registered at the department of pathology of the univer-
sity hospital of Sfax in Tunisia, during a period of 11 years from 2010 to
2020. Their epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic and pathological char-
acteristics as well as their outcome were retrospectively reviewed.
Results: The mean age was 29,6 years [4 - 66 years]. The sex ratio was
1/2. The cysts were located in cerebral hemisphere in 4 cases and spinal
cord in 5 cases. For spinal location, lumbar and sacral regions were
involved in respectively 3 and 2 cases. Bifocal cerebral involvement
was observed in one patient. No other systemic locations were associated.
Histopathological diagnosis was made on surgical specimens in all cases.
Microscopically, the presence of eosinophilic laminated and non-nuclear
layer which was positive for PAS confirmed the diagnosis of hydatidosis.
All patients received perioperative albendazole treatment with good re-
covery. A local vertebral recurrence was noted in one patient after 8 years.
Conclusion: Hydatidosis usually affects liver (60-70%) and lung
(20-30%). The passage of the larva through the first filters (liver
and lung) before hematogenous dissemination explains the rarity
of CNS involvement. CNS hydatidosis should always be consid-
ered when encountering cystic lesion especially in endemic areas.
It is more common in children and young adults. Brain involve-
ment is more frequent than the spinal one. Histological examina-
tion is the key to confirm the diagnosis. Recurrences are observed
in 30% of cases despite adequate therapy.

*Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, Russia
Background & objectives: The COVID-19 disease, declared by the
WHO as a pandemic, is still an urgent problem of modern medicine.
Despite the fact that many laboratory data have been well characterized,
clinical and pathology data correlation needs to be investigated.
Methods: Autopsy records of 47 fatal cases of COVID-19 disease were
reviewed. Demographic characteristicsandclinical peculiarities were noted.
Gross pictures and histopathology of lungs and other organs were studied.
Results: Most deaths were recorded in the 61-75 age group(46,8%).The
second age group with frequent fatal outcomes ranged 76- 90
years(31,9%).10.6% were in the 18-44 age group. 8.5% of cases were
aged 45-60 years. One man was 90yo. Postmortem investigation revealed
COVID-19-induced pathological changes in the lungs in most pa-
tients:76,5% of them had interstitial pneumonia and the development of
acute respiratory distress in the most severe cases (72,3%). Our study also
has shown the tracheitis with epiglottitis (44,6%), gastroenteritis (21,3%),
bacterial bronchopneumonia (19,1%) and other pathologies (myocarditis,
pleurisy, nephritis, meningitis, thromboembolism) with a male predomi-
nance among patients. The main histological peculiarities were presented
in lungs as alveolar damage accompanied with widespread microscopic
thromboses.
Conclusion: COVID-19 viral infection contributes to heterogeneous
lung damage and has been associated with other internal organs
injury and dysfunction. Capillary microthrombi and inflammation,
as well as macrothrombi, areas of dystrophy and necrosis revealed
in organ’s tissues. Multiple manifestations of the accompanying
pathologies may contribute to disease progression and fatality.
Further study of the COVID 19 morphology with clinical–
pathologic correlations is needed to develop effective therapies
and preventive countermeasures.

*Department of Pathology, Mateu Orfila Hospital, IB-Salut, Maó
(Menorca), Spain
Background & objectives: SARS CoV-2, in addition to affecting the
respiratory tract, can cause thrombogenic ischemia in various organs
including the gastrointestinal tract. The cause is multifactorial: hyperco-
agulability, endothelitis, coagulopathy leading to thromboembolic com-
plications, the use of vasopressors in patients with hemodynamic
compromise.
Methods: A 39-year-old male, without previous pathologies was admit-
ted to the intensive-care unit due to bilateral COVID-19 interstitial pneu-
monia. On the 13th day of hospitalization, he presented paralytic ileus. In
abdominal tomography, acute mesenteric ischemia in jejunum-ileum was
observed. The patient had an emergency laparotomy with evidence of
segmental small bowel ischemia with faecaloid peritonitis. A small bowel
resection was performed.
Results: Small intestine resection specimen of 164 cm long, exter-
nally it presented reddened serous and fibrin plaques.
Histologically, massive acute intestinal ischemia was observed,
with trans-mural necrosis, thrombosis in arterial and venous ves-
sels of small and medium calibre in all the intestinal wall includ-
ing adipose tissue. In addition to images of vasculitis, fibrinoid
necrosis, and serositis with perforation. An immunohistochemical
technique was performed for SARS CoV-2 (GeneTex), which was
positive in endothelial and inflammatory cells. The patient pre-
sented septic shock secondary to faecaloid peritonitis; intestinal
failure secondary to short bowel syndrome; multi organ failure
and finally death 58 days after surgery.
Conclusion: Severe COVID-19 pneumonia should be considered a
hypercoagulable state, maintaining a high level of suspicion of in-
testinal ischemia. In the literature, there is only one case (Norsa
et al.) where they described small bowel ischemia that confirmed
the presence of SARS CoV-2 in the intestinal mucosa by ISH RNA.
These findings suggest a direct viral role in the ischemic process
and not just a consequence of the hypercoagulable state; more stud-
ies are needed to clarify it.

*Acibadem University Medical College Pathology Department, Turkey
Background & objectives: Mitotic activity is one of the prognostic pa-
rameters in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumours (GIST). We aimed study the
role of Artificial intelligence (AI) based counting mitosis and to search
interobservance agreement between human eye and AI counting in GISTs.
Methods: Slides belongto 18 GIST cases were scannedat 40xmagnification
by 3DHistech Scanner. Two-stage deep algorithm was used to detect mitotic
cells. Nucleus centres was detected using RetinaNet architecture. Prediction
was performed to determine mitosis using VGG-11 architecture. Mitosis was
also counted by 3 pathologists in light microscopy. The agreement analysis
was performed using Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) test.
Results: Mean age:54; Female/Male ratio:1,2/1 Tumour size range:3,4-
28cm ; 38% of cases were in high risk, 38% in moderate and 22,2% of
cases were in low risk group. In AI program; 246 patches (size of
512x512 pixels) extracted from the slides and annotated 21237 nuclei.
Dice(F1) score; 0.96, a true positive rate:0.97; true negative rate:0.97;
validation accuracy:0.97. ICC results showed an excellent level of agree-
ment between the pathologists, with an ICC point estimate of 0.909 (95%
CI [0.814, 0.962]). Inclusion of the AI rater led to a moderate level of
agreement with an ICC of 0.682 (95% CI [0.479, 0.846]). Agreement was
significantly higher in cases show <2 mitosis/5 mm2.
Conclusion: This is the first study which analysing AI-based mitotic
counting in GIST, as we know, so far. The agreement was found better
in larger tumours compare to small one (trucut, endoscopic biopsy) in this
preliminary study. Our study continue with larger series later.

Background & objectives: The uPath HER2 (4B5) image analysis for
breast algorithm aids in scoring breast cancers stained with the
VENTANA HER2 (4B5) assay. We present data comparing manual
scoring to computer-assisted scoring using the uPath HER2 (4B5) image
analysis for breast algorithm.
Methods: Three study pathologists scored 180 FFPE breast cancer cases
independently by both manual and HER2 (4B5) image analysis methods.
Scoring results from both manual read (MR) and computer-assisted
scores (image analysis, IA) were compared against the ground truth
(GT) scores generated by consensus panel pathologists. The differences
in agreement rates for HER2 IHC status between scores were determined.
Results: Agreement rates* (PPA: positive percent agreement; NPA: neg-
ative percent agreement; OPA: overall percent agreement) between MR,
IA and GT were:
PPA- MR vs GT-95.5% [95% CI: 92.9, 97.8]; IA vs GT-95.5% [95% CI:
92.9, 97.4]
NPA -MR vs GT-95.0% [95% CI: 92.3, 97.5]; IA vs GT-95.4% [95% CI:
93.1, 97.7]
OPA -MR vs GT-95.3% [95% CI: 93.5, 97.2]; IA vs GT-95.5% [95% CI:
93.6, 97.2]
Further, inter-reader agreement rates were observed for the image analy-
sis method with point estimates of at least 95.6%.
*-2-sided 95% CI
Conclusion: Comparison of agreement rates demonstrated that the lower
bounds of the difference of PPA and NPA 95% CIs were -0.0% and -
1.1%, respectively, and met the pre-specified study’s acceptance criteria.
Overall, the studies demonstrated that the uPath HER2 (4B5) image anal-
ysis for breast algorithm is equivalent to the manual pathologist scoring
method in determining HER2 IHC status in breast cancer.

Background & objectives: The uPath PD-L1 (SP263) image analysis
(IA) algorithm functions as an aid in the interpretation of the VENTANA
PD-L1 (SP263) Assay in NSCLC. We present data comparing manual
scoring to computer-assisted scoring using the uPath PD-L1 (SP263) IA
algorithm.
Methods: Using a supervised machine learning approach, the uPath PD-
L1 (SP263) IA algorithm was trained on NSCLC cases scanned on
VENTANA DP 200 scanners and annotated by pathologists.
Equivalency at the 50% cut-off between pathologists’ manual read
(MR) and computer-aided scoring using the uPath PD-L1 (SP263) IA
algorithm was compared using 180 NSCLC cases stained with
VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay.
Results: The computer-aided interpretation (image analysis, IA) using
the uPath PD-L1 (SP263) IA algorithm displayed equivalence to manual
interpretation at the 50% cut-off with a positive percent agreement (PPA)
rate of 96.7% (95% CI: 94.0, 98.9), and a negative percent agreement
(NPA) of 93.1% (95% CI: 90.2, 95.6). Inter-reader agreement rates for the
computer-aided interpretation were concordant with a PPA rate of 95.1 %
(95% CI: 92.5, 97.5) and a NPA rate of 98.5 % (95% CI: 97.1, 99.7).
Intra-reader agreement for the computer-aided interpretation were also
concordant with a PPA rate of 98.4% (95% CI: 95.1, 100.0) and a NPA
rate of 100% (95% CI: 96.8, 100.0).
Conclusion: Overall the study met the expected goals and shows that
computer-aided interpretation using the uPath PD-L1 (SP263) IA algo-
rithm is reproducible among readers and is equivalent to the manual
scoring method at the 50% cut-off in NSLC.

Validation and concordance study on digital pathology for the pri-
mary histopathological diagnosis of routine dermatopathology
specimen
P. Larsson*, G. Salkus, S. Jensen, A. Brügmann
*Aalborg University Hospital, Sweden
Background & objectives: The Pathology Department in Aalborg,
Denmark, is currently in the process of implementing digital pathology.
Our aim was to train and validate three dermatopathologists using digital
pathology for primary dermatopathological diagnoses and to assess con-
cordance, safety and to identify pitfalls.
Methods: The validation model was inspired by guidelines for implementa-
tion (by The Royal College of Pathologists), with a few modifications to local
circumstances. The cases were reviewed digitally and then immediately
reviewed by conventional light microscopy. Diagnoses, discrepancies, tech-
nical qualities and challenging areas were noted for each case. All specimen
types were covered and included a representative mix of different diagnoses.
Results: Each pathologist reviewed 20 cases in the training phase and all
three reviewed a total of 434 cases in the validation phase between
May 2020 and January 2021. The diagnostic concordance rate was
99.28 %, excluding deferrals. Three discordant cases were identified;
two were associated with poor focus quality and one with difficulties in
identifying cell morphological details. The total mean level of confidence
when diagnosing was 6.63 digitally and 6.79 microscopically, based on
Likert scale (ranging from 1-7). Common pitfalls observed were related to
morphological details associated with inflammatory cells, dysplasia and
carcinomas, and to a lesser extent, adnexae, microorganisms and mitoses.
Conclusion: The concordance of 99.28% and the pitfalls observed are
similar with those of other contemporary studies. It indicates that digital
review is a safe alternative to conventional microscopy, but more work is
needed to improve the focus quality at a cellular level.

3D reconstruction of kidney with tumour based on histopathological
macroscopic imaging
T. Markiewicz*, M. Lorent, R. Roszczyk
*Military Institute of Medicine, Poland
Background & objectives: The histopathological macroscopic exami-
nation of kidney is performed to conclude the presence of lesions in
kidney and metrical description. The transverse kidney slicing,
photographing and 3D reconstruction procedure can be useful to visual-
ization and quantification of the kidney and cancer.
Methods: The serial slicing of kidneys were performed on the special
table with the row of needles and comb guide for a knife with 10mm
distances. The sections were photographed, initially pre-agreeded and the
kidney and cancer outlined by a pathologist. The 3D reconstruction was
performed by mesh generation, its smoothing and step-parallel
optimication with the different aim functions.
Results: The set of 20 kidneys were 3D reconstructed based on the
macroscopic imaging. It was observed that the main problem to obtained
the smooth, anatomically concordance reconstructions was the large
spacing of the data. The coarse pre-agreeding of sections effects the
unwanted surface unevenness which was minimized on the optimization
procedure. The step-parallel procedure of sections transposing in the X
and Y directions, and rotation was applied in the gradient-descent manner
due to high computational cost. The aim function based on the maximi-
zation of volume gives a better results than criteria of concordance be-
tween the sections and mesh intersections. The visualization and volume
counting is a final step of procedure.
Conclusion: The 3D reconstruction of kidney and their lesions based on
the macroscopic imaging can be done with the expert’s annotations and the
proposed optimization procedure. The maximization of object volume can
be used as the aim function in fine agreed of sections. The high computa-
tional cost can be reduced by the parallel computing and gradient-descent
manner instead of the whole parameter grid examination. In such a way, the
volume quantification and visualization can be done.
Funding: This study was supported by the National Science Centre,
Poland (grant no 2016/23/B/ST6/00621).

Workplace evaluation in the practice of a digital pathologist: an er-
gonomic approach
M. Parygina*, M. Stepanchenko, S. Mozgovoi
*Omsk State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: Along with all the benefits of digital pathology
this area also escalates some issues we usually have to deal with. Workspace
ergonomics becomes extremely important factor due to even more prolonged
immobility comparing to traditional non-digital pathology.
Methods: A number of criteria were adapted from analysed articles for
assessment work-related discomfort (WRD). The ergonomic comfort index
(ECI) reflecting the grade of ergonomic discomfort was offered, varying
from 1 to 24. Each studied workstation (n=32) was categorised into 1 of 3
groups according to the level of compliance with the recommendations for
ergonomics: complete discrepancy, part-agreement and relative agreement.
Results: A questionnaire was also developed to assess the clinical symp-
toms as subjective part of WRD. Results of the pilot study showed that
62,5% of respondents complain about head & neck discomfort by the end
of the day with second most popular complain of carpal tunnel syndrome.
ECI varied from 8 to 11, and none of the workstations were deemed
appropriate to complete discrepancy. Interestingly, senior pathologists
tend to gain more points than younger ones.
Conclusion: The study showed the need for systematic approach when
dealing with bad workspace ergonomics. As we move forward to the
digital pathology, we will require more comfortable supplies. The pro-
posed algorithm of workplace evaluation and the questionnaire would be
helpful for self-assessment to reveal the ergonomic problems and for a
standardized assessment after appropriate validation.

gram (Aperio Image Scope). Among testing 40 cells at different coordi-
nates, the different measurement value is ranging from 0.000380166947
to0.124475444 (mean at 0.393864932). The study will apply more cases
and will be added during the presentation.
Conclusion: N/C ratio plays the major role to help diagnosis in cytology
cases, but this parameter is vary from person-to-person. To cut off the
discrepancy of diagnosis from human error, the computing programmed
would be beneficial. The software/developing program from our students
gives hope and premise to reduce loads of routine cytology screening for
pathology. This helps to validate the influential parameters, reduce human
errors, and easily access from smartphones.

*Hospices civils de Lyon, Lyon 1 University & CYPATH, France
Background & objectives: We now need to detect microsatellite insta-
bility (MSI) to all of the patients included to immunotherapy protocols.
This study was designed to assess robustness of the Idylla™MSI Test to
detect MSI in non-CRC.
Methods: 64 cases from archived specimens, including 32
gynaecological carcinoma, 26 digestive carcinoma and 6 sebaceoma,
were retrospectively analysed using Idylla™MSI Test. The results were
compared to those previously determined by the Promega™MSI assay or
to the expression of the 4 mismatch repair proteins detected by immuno-
histochemical staining.
Results: Out of 64 cases, 15 were classified as MSI by the Idylla™MSI
Test. Among the 15 MSI tumours, the number of altered MSI biomarkers
ranged from 2/7 to 6/7. MSI status were detected, whatever the tissue
origin, sebaceoma, cholangiocarcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, gastric
or small intestine carcinoma. Compared with the Promega™MSI assay,
sensitivity and specificity of 87.5%, and 100% was reached, respectively.
The lowest sensitivity was found in the endometrial carcinoma.
Conclusion: The novel Idylla™MSI Test showed high concordance in
determining MSI status in non-CRC, with a good concordance in all the
various tissue tested. The findings in our study support the use of this Test
as an alternative method to detect MSI in non-colorectal cancers.

*Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: Tumour location and IHC-based Consensus
Molecular Subtype (CMS) are essential in prognosis and treatment of
colon cancer (CC), characterized by its heterogeneity. The aim is to iden-
tify differentially expressed mRNA in CMS-2/3 patients classified by
tumour location and health status.
Methods: Formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded tissue was selected from
24 CC patients, including 12 at right colon (6 alive/6 dead) and 12 at left
colon (7 alive /5 dead); all the cases were CMS-2/3, pT3/pT4, regional
positive lymph-nodes and unmethylated CDX2. Up- and down-regulated
genes were detected by whole-transcriptome analysis. Libraries were se-
quenced in the HiSeq1500 (Illumina). The bioinformatic analysis was
performed by SARTools (FDR˂0.05).
Results: 215 genes were differentially expressed in more aggressive tu-
mours compared to less aggressive ones, including genes involved in
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. There also differences in the ex-
pression of key genes between right and left-sided tumours.
Conclusion: The application of Transcriptomics is feasible in archived
paraffin samples.
This high-throughput technology allows the detection of differen-
tially expressed mRNAs with potential clinical value in the study
of CMS-2/3 patients, characterized by its clinical and pathological
heterogeneity.

*Myriad International GmbH, Germany
Background & objectives: The Prolaris cell-cycle progression (CCP)
test is a validated 46-gene assay which informs risk of disease progression
for men with localized prostate cancer. This study developed and validat-
ed a 16-gene kit-based version of Prolaris for use in decentralized testing
laboratories.
Methods: RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
prostate cancer biopsy tissue. CCP scores were calculated as the expres-
sion of CCP genes normalized to housekeeper genes. Amplification effi-
ciency, minimum tumour content, repeatability and reproducibility were
evaluated. Scores from the 46- and 16-gene tests were compared to verify
the 16-gene test could be applied in a similar clinical manner to the 46-
gene test.
Results: The 16-gene test performed across a range of RNA input
concentrations. Amplification efficiency for all CCP and housekeep-
er genes in the 16-gene test fell within the allowable range (90-
110%). Samples with at least 60% tumour content were determined
to be appropriate for testing with the 16-gene kit. Test results were
highly repeatable (SD in CCP score 0.085) and reproducible (SD
0.115), with instrument used, test operator, and kit lot all having
minimal impact on test result variation (SD 0.000, SD 0.016, and
SD 0.114, respectively). The CCP scores generated from the 46- and
16-gene tests were correlated.
Conclusion: The 16-gene test, which consists of 10 CCP and 6 house-
keeper genes, results in similar scores to the 46-gene test. Kit lot, test
instrument, and operator had minimal impact on the CCP score results
from the 16-gene test, indicating it is appropriate for use in a decentralized
testing setting. This will allow access to a version of the Prolaris test for
patients in areas where testing in local laboratories is required or desired.

A clinical practice assessment educational activity to evaluate the
knowledge of pathologists and oncologists regarding their under-
standing of NGS
N. Dorkhom*, A. Furedy, T. Abair, F. Lopez-Rios
*Medscape, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Next generation sequencing (NGS) can si-
multaneously evaluate multiple genetic alterations and is becoming more
important for individualizing cancer therapy. This activity was designed
to understand the gaps in knowledge haematologists/oncologists (hem/
oncs) and pathologists have regarding the use of NGS.
Methods: A continuing medical education (CME)-certified clinical prac-
tice assessment comprising 29 multiple-choice questions that measured
knowledge, attitudes, and perspectives regarding NGS was developed.
The self-assessment was available online to physicians without monetary
compensation or charge. Respondent confidentiality was maintained, and
responses were de-identified and aggregated prior to analysis. The activ-
ity launched Jan 9, 2020; data through March 12, 2020 are presented.
Results: At the time of this analysis, between 180 hem/oncs and 94
pathologists answered some to all questions in this activity.
Only 44% of hem/oncs and 26% of pathologists regularly use NGS in
their clinics. Around 80% of hem/oncs and 62% of pathologists indicated
that the approximate turnaround time for NGS results is 10 or more
working days, and cost was the most important barrier to using NGS in
their practice.
Of the 20 questions assessing the knowledge of clinicians regarding the
use of NGS, the percentage of hem/oncs answering correctly ranged from
18% to 77%, while 23% to 81% of pathologists answered these questions
correctly.
Conclusion: NGS is becoming more important in guiding and driving
treatment decisions for various cancers in clinical practice, however only
20% of hem/oncs and pathologists felt moderately or very confident in
their ability to explain to their colleagues how to apply NGS in clinical
practice. This educational activity illustrates that there are clear knowl-
edge gaps regarding how to optimally implement NGS in clinical prac-
tice, indicating the importance of developing educational activities on this
topic.
Funding: The educational activity was supported by an independent ed-
ucational grant from Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Background & objectives: Multigene mutation analysis is getting more
important in NSCLC, in terms of multidrug treatment. We aimed to
identify druggable genomic variants using targeted gene panel in NGS
platform.
Methods: RNA was isolated via "RNEASY FFPE KIT" from paraffin
blocks containing 80 Tumour tissue with NSCLC. Archer® FusionPlex®
Comprehensive Thyroid & Lung (CTL) was used to create cDNA librar-
ies. Illumina NextSeq next generation sequencing platform was used. All
Analysis performed in Archer Analysis Ver.6.0.3.2 software.
Results: Mean age was 51: M/F:1,2/1: Analysis included: Fusions for
ALK, AXL, BRAF, CCND1, FGFR1,FGFR2, EGFR, FGFR3, MET,
NRG1, NTRK 1-2 ve 3, PPARG, RAF1, RET, ROS1, THADA; and

Genomic variations found: EGFR-mutation (15.8%), EML4-ALK
Fusion (3.75%), KRAS codon 12mut (22.5%), BRAF (7.5%) ERBB2
mut(2.5%), MET mut (2.2%), exon 14 skipping MET (3.75%, CD74-
ROS1fus (3.75%), KIF5B-RET fus (1.25%), FGFR3-TACC3 fus (2,5%)
were treatable alterations in study group. There is no SNV, indel, fusion
or expression 25 % of cases.
Conclusion: Our study support that NGS based targeted panel is useful to
detect druggable mutations in Lung Carcinomas. This method can be
used also for small biopsies.

Oncologia, Valencia, Spain
Background & objectives: PARP inhibitors have shown efficacy in
BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer (OC) patients. The aim of this study is
to perform an inter-laboratory ring-trial to compare and evaluate different
analytical approaches to identify and classify BRCA variants in formalin-
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumours.
Methods: Five independent clinical diagnostic and two reference labora-
tories tested 9 specimens, including commercial synthetic human FFPE
(n=3) and OC tumour tissue DNA (n=3) and FFPE (n=3) samples. Each
centre performed their routine next-generation-sequencing (NGS)
workflow and report. To estimate the concordance rate 17 variants were
evaluated: 10 pathogenic, 1 likely pathogenic, 3 variants of unknown
significance (VUS) and 3 wild-type.
Results: Five different commercial NGS panels were employed, two
based on hybridization-capture and three on target PCR/amplicons, on
two NGS instruments (MiSeq-Illumina and Ion S5™System-Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Different NGS bioinformatic pipelines were used to
identify and annotate variants.
The median concordance detection rate was 64.7% (35.3-70.6%). Most of
non-reported results correspond to variants within homopolimeric re-
gions, bioinformatic issues, low variant allele frequencies or low cover-
age. One laboratory reported no results for one commercial specimen due
to insufficient DNA; another laboratory reported a false positive variant
within a commercial sample.
Discrepancies in variant classification affected four alterations, three of
them with clinical relevance (VUS vs likely pathogenic).
Conclusion: This ring-trial showed a wide range of concordance
rates in the identification and interpretation of BRCA somatic anal-
ysis. It highlights the relevance of establishing standard criteria for
detecting, interpreting and reporting BRCA somatic variants.
Validation of both NGS methodology and bioinformatic pipelines
are required. Standardization in analytical criteria is also mandatory.
Regarding interpretation, discrepancies affecting non-reported vari-
ants in databases remain a challenge with relevant clinical
implications.

*Department of Pathology, University General Hospital of Ciudad Real,
Spain
Background & objectives: Muir-Torre syndrome is a Lynch syndrome
variant, characterized by the presence of sebaceous gland neoplasms. It is
caused by a germline mutation in the mismatch repair system. Currently,
there are no well-established guidelines for universal screening in these
neoplasms.
Methods: Patients with a histological diagnosis of sebaceous gland neo-
plasia in our hospital in the last 10 years were included in the study.
Immunohistochemical techniques for the expression of MMR proteins
were performed. The protein expression results, and the expression loss
pattern were collected. The percentages of type of neoplasia, expression
loss and patterns were calculated.
Results: The sample consisted of 32 patients with sebaceous gland neo-
plasms, 15 (46.8%) of which were sebaceous epitheliomas, 14 (43.7%)
sebaceous adenomas and 3 (0.9%) sebaceous carcinomas. Eight neo-
plasms (25%) had loss of expression of MMR proteins. The most com-
mon pattern was the loss of MSH2 and MSH6, corresponding to 7 neo-
plasms (87’5%), whereas one of them (12.5%) lost expression of MLH1
and PMS2.
Conclusion: Universal immunohistochemistry screening for microsatel-
lite instability in sebaceous gland neoplasms shows remarkable percent-
ages in this and other studies. However, in other publications, it has been
pointed out that immunohistochemistry may be less specific for these
neoplasms, compared to the same screening performed in other organs.
Therefore, more studies are needed to determine the need for universal
screening for sebaceous gland neoplasms.

*Medical University of Gdansk, Poland
Background & objectives: Pathogenesis of Germ cell tumours (GCTs),
especially in children, is not fully understood. Hedgehog (Hh) signalling
pathway controls cellular migration and specification during embryogen-
esis and affects gonadal formation and sexual differentiation. Hh pathway
molecular changes participate in GCTs pathobiology.
Methods: The molecular changes in Hedgehog pathway genes in 70
childhood germ cell tumours were examined. The mutational anal-
ysis of the Hh pathway associated genes and chosen non-HH net-
work genes in GCT was performed in FFPE tumour samples using
the next generation sequencing technique (NGS) with a custom de-
signed QIAseq Targeted DNA panel comprising 25 genes of the
pathway (Qiagen).
Results: Analysis of 70 GCTs revealed somatic molecular changes in 52
(74%) of tumours, mostly dysgerminomas and mixed tumours. The most
common were activating pathogenic changes in KIT gene (33%, n=23)
and KRAS (9%, n=6). 25 (36%) tumours had at least one sequence
variant in the genes encoding canonical elements of the Hh pathway.
These included likely pathogenic loss-of-function variants in PTCH1
(n=3), PTCH2 (n=5), SMO (n=5), DISP2 (n=5), HHIP (n=1), ZIC2
(n=1) and SUFU (n=1). Also, a number of missense variants of unknown
significance were described including rare single nucleotide variants in
LRP2 gene present in 23 tumours.
Conclusion: The observed selective activation of individual pathway
elements implies that Hh pathway may be involved in GCT pathogenesis,
although may rather through to dysregulation of physiological maturation
processes than being a trigger factor that activates oncogenesis. Due to the
individual nature of the changes found and the limited number of tumours
studied a comprehensive assessment of the complex molecular changes in
Hh pathway loci associated with the GCTs pathogenesis is not possible at
present stage of the study.

Sciences, Moscow, Russia
Background & objectives: There are seven molecular subtypes of pros-
tate cancer (PC), four were characterized by gene fusion between
TMPRSS2 and ETS-family member, which is 65% PC cases. In this work,
we aimed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated
with ETS-fusion-positive PC.
Methods: This study included RNA-Seq data of PC samples of The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-PRAD project). The cohort was divided:
patients with ETS-fusion and ETS-fusion-negative. Differential expres-
sion analysis was performed in statistical environment R using the EdgeR
package was used. The Mann-Whitney test, and quasi-likelihood method
(QLF) were used for statistical analysis. To exclude false positive results
FDR method was used.
Results: We identified at list 93 differentially expressed genes (based on
QLF FDR and Mann-Whitney FDR < 0.05) between the studied groups
(38 genes were upregulated and 55 – downregulated). The following
genes showing overexpression in ETS-fusion-positive PC samples are
marked: ALOX15B (fold change – 4.8), GNMT (4.1), MIPEP (4.4),
PCOTH (5.1), TFF3 (8.2), and as downregulated: CDH7 (-5.5),
KCNN4 (-5.1), LINC02418 (-8.1). STRING Network analysis shown
enrichment for several GO-term: arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase activity
(GO:0050473), acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity (GO:0008376),
a n d g l u c u r o n y l g a l a c t o s y l p r o t e o g l y c a n 4 - b e t a - N -
acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity (GO:0047237).
Conclusion: We found out 93 differentially expressed genes, which were
involved in acetylgalactosaminyltransferase and arachidonate 15-
lipoxygenase activity. The highest changes we observed in ALOX15B,
CDH7, GNMT, KCNN4, LINC02418, MIPEP, PCOTH, TFF3 genes.

Background & objectives: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of
cancer death among men worldwide. The aim of our study was to identify
changes in the miRNAs expression profile associated with Gleason scores
and to identify miRNAs with prognostic potential.
Methods: miRNA-Seq on Illumina platform was performed for 44 pros-
tate cancer specimens taken from Russian patients. Bioinformatic analy-
sis of relative expression was performed in the R statistical environment
using the edgeR package. Additionally, a correlation analysis was carried
out using the Spearman test. The results were considered statistically
significant at p-value QLF-test and p-value Spearman test < 0,05.
Virchows Arch
Results: As a result, we identified a profile of 21 miRNAs, in which an
increase in relative expression was noted with the highest Gleason score
for miR-183-5p, miR-615-3p, miR-106b-3p, miR-342-5p, miR-182- 5p,
miR-25-3p, miR-7-5p, miR-409-3p, miR-432-5p, miR-1275; and is
marked by a decrease in relative expression for miR-455-5p, miR-582-
3p, miR-143-5p, miR-221-5p, miR-221-3p, miR-1-3p, miR-29c-3p,
miR-222 -3p, miR-133a-3p, miR-499a-5p, miR-224-5p, respectively.
The greatest correlation with an increase in Gleason scores was noted
for miR-183-5p (rs = 0.47), miR-615-3p (rs = 0.47), miR-455-5p (rs = -
0.47), miR-582-3p (rs = -0.47).
Conclusion: We found a miRNA expression profile associated with an
increase in Gleason scores, in particular, in a cohort of Russian patients.
Many of the identified miRNAs are well known as participants in various
cancer associated events. Further experimental studies with extended
sampling are required to validate these results.

*Institute for Pulmonary Diseases of Vojvodina, Sremska Kamenica,
Serbia
Background & objectives: Cell-free tumour DNA (cfDNA) found in
blood plasma has been applied for the detection of EGFR mutations in
lung cancer. The objective of study was examination of EGFR mutation
frequency in liquid biopsy and its correlation with clinical characteristics.
Methods: This study, conducted at the Institute for Lung Diseases of
Vojvodina, in the period from October 2016 to October 2019, included
75 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, who underwent
liquid biopsy and EGFR testing. cfDNA was isolated using the
Cobas®cfDNA Sample Preparation Kit. The target DNA was amplified
and detected using real time PCR Cobas®EGFR Mutation Test v2.
Results: Average age in the investigated population was 63.4 years.
There were 74.7% men and 25.3% women. Overall EGFR mutation rate
was 9.3%. The most common EGFR mutations were deletions in exon 19
and single-point mutation L858R in exon 21. Majority of patients were
active and former smokers; 60.0% and 29.0% respectively. There were
only 11% non-smokers. We found statistically significant correlation be-
tween positive EGFR mutation and former smoking status (p=0.030).
Association between females and EGFR mutation was statistically signif-
icant (p=0.042).
Conclusion: Although histological and cytological specimens should be
the first sample choice for EGFR testing in lung cancers, liquid biopsy is a
promising minimal invasive diagnostic approach.

MiRNAs hypermethylation in gliomas
S. Limam*, M.T. Yacoubi, M. Mokni, N. Missaoui
*Pathology Department, Farhet Hached, Tunisia
Background & objectives: MiRNAs expression has been frequently
deregulated in many cancers. This deregulation can be induced by epige-
netic modifications, such as hypermethylation. Few studies have investi-
gated miRNAs hypermethylation in gliomas. Herein, we aim to evaluate
miRNAs methylation status and DNMTs overexpression in gliomas.
Methods: The methylation status of 15 tumour suppressor miRNAs was
evaluated by specific PCR-methylation technique after DNA modifica-
tion with sodium bisulfite in 112 cases of adult gliomas. DNA methyl-
transferases enzymes expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry.
The association of miRNAs hypermethylation with DNMTs overexpres-
sion and tumour features was evaluated using SPSS.
Results: MiRNA methylation profile analysis showed an hypermethyla-
tion of miR-9, miR-34, miR-124, miR-107, miR-127, miR-137, miR-
148, miR-193 and miR-203. Expression of DNMT1, DNMT3a and
DNMT3b was detected in 45,5%, 21,4% and 7,1% adult gliomas, respec-
tively. The association between miRNAs hypermethylation and DNMTs
expression revealed a significant correlation between the overexpression
of DNMT1 and the methylation of the miR-9 family, miR-34 family and
miR-193a. For DNMT3b, its overexpression was significantly associated
with miR-9-1, miR-9-3 and miR-34b/c. However, expression of
DNMT3a showed a statistically significant association with hypermethy-
lation of promoters of all miRNAs studied except miR-203a.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that miRNAs hypermethylation consti-
tutes an epigenetic event that could be involved in gliomas pathogenicity.

Molero, R. Martinez, M. Alonso, E. Conde, F. Lopez-Rios*
*CIBERONC, Spain
Background & objectives: After the approval of RET inhibitors for RET
fusion-positive papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), we hypothesized that
a comparison of testing assays is needed. Moreover, the sensitivity of
FISH has been challenged, mainly driven by the presence of NCOA4-
RET fusions.
Methods: A retrospective search of consecutive PTC cases with tumour
size larger than 0.5 cm between January 2007 and December 2020 from
the pathology archives was performed. All tumours underwent break-
apart RET FISH (Vysis) with an automated scanning system
(BioView). All the identified RET-positive PTCs were subsequently
studied by targeted RNA-based NGS (Oncomine Comprehensive Assay
v3, OCAv3).
Results: Analyses by FISH was successful in all 191 tumours. Sixteen
RET-positive PTC (8.4%) were identified. The conventional and follicu-
lar histological variants accounted for the majority of RET-positive PTCs
(37.5% each). A predominant conventional split signal pattern (≥2 signal
diameter) was present in 15 tumours (94%). The percentage of tumour
cells with this pattern ranged from 30-80%. Interestingly, isolated red
signals (atypical pattern) were only absent in one case. The percentage
of tumour cells with atypical pattern ranged from 0-42%. The RNA-based
NGS confirmed the presence of a RET fusion in all 16 FISH positive
PTCs. The most common partner was CCDC6 (94%). The remaining
positive-PTC contained the ERC1-RET variant (6%).
Conclusion: The most frequent partner in this retrospective series of
consecutive PTCs was CCDC6. Accordingly, the concordance between
FISH and RNA-based NGS was perfect, with a 0% failure rate. The
interpretation of RET FISH was straightforward in all cases due to the
absence of subtle split signals or complex patterns.

Background & objectives: Strong and diffuse immunohistochemical
staining of p53 at some carcinomas is interpreted as likely indicating a
TP53 missense mutation. However, the significance of completely nega-
tive immunostaining is controversial. We analysed the correlation of p53
immunostaining and mutations in colorectal cancer.
Methods: A total of 99 cases of colorectal carcinoma were studied.
Immunohistochemical procedures were performed according to
Roche Ventana (anti-P53 (DO-7)) protocol. TP53 exons 5 to 8
were analysed by Sanger sequencing using the primers described
by Asai et al (Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 2014). In case of muta-
tion, normal tissue was studied to confirm/discard the presence of
germline variants.
Results: 69 samples presented strong immunostaining (positivity higher
than 90% of cells) and in 30 tumours staining was absent or less than
1.5%.
Altogether, 62.7% (62/99) of samples carried a TP53 mutation. Among
69 IHQ positive samples, 48 (69,6%) had missense mutations. One sam-
ple presented a double mutation, which is unusual. Regarding negative
staining samples, 14 out of 30 (46,7%) had protein-truncating mutations.
Loss of heterozygosity (LOH), as a manifestation of chromosomal aneu-
ploidy, was present in 51/62 samples with TP53 mutations (37 with
missense and 14 with truncating variants); eight of the patients were
homozygous (non-informative) for the analysed microsatellites. Among
non-carriers, 24/37 presented LOH.
Conclusion: As described in the literature for other tumours, immuno-
histochemical staining for p53 can be used as a surrogate for mutational
analysis also in colorectal cancer, with strong staining being associated
with missense mutations and absent staining with protein-truncating var-
iants in our series.
The higher frequency of chromosome alterations in tumours asso-
ciated with TP53 mutations confirms its role in the chromosomic
instability pathway. We cannot discard that the three TP53-mutant
tumours carry other type of genomic alterations as translocations or
amplifications.

Categorization of medulloblastoma of childhood using genome-wide
methylation assay
A. Ouban*
*Alfaisal Uni. College of Medicine, Saudi Arabia
Background & objectives: Precise diagnosis of childhood medulloblas-
toma is of critical importance to ensure delivery of tailored therapy, lim-
iting side-effects of treatment. The goal was to assess genome-wide meth-
ylation assays in correctly categorizing these tumours in one of the four
known molecular groups.
Methods: cDNA microarray methylation analyses were performed using
combination of bisulfite conversion of DNA samples and the Infinium
HD Assay (Illumina) for methylation. Microarray signals were detected
using the Illumina iSCAN System. Genome Studio V2011.1 analysis
software was used to analyse the raw data.
Results: Using bisulfite conversion followed by the Infinium HD meth-
ylation assay (Illumina) provided us with data files (iDAT) which were
uploaded on a public domain classifier, a bioinformatic analysis tool
provided online (courtesy of the German Cancer Research Center), this
study was able to categorize all 7 samples attempted. The majority of the
samples fell into two categories, either the “methylation class medullo-
blastoma, subclass groups 3” or the “methylation class medulloblastoma,
subclass groups 4”.
Conclusion: The Infinium HD methylation assay is a robust molec-
ular technique that is able to categorize medulloblastomas of child-
hood compared to plain histomorphology, immunohistochemistry or
both. Furthermore, the technique provides a genetic profile of each
tumour by providing the copy number variations derived from the
same assay.

Caroti, G. Anselmi, V. Gismondi, V.G. Vellone, L. Varesco
*Department of Integrated Surgical and Diagnostic Sciences (DISC),
University of Genoa, Italy
Background & objectives: B1PHM is observed in 10-30% of OC. This
epigenetic event is associated with low BRCA1 protein expression and,
therefore, it is considered as a mechanism of BRCA1 loss of function.
Studies are needed to clarify its importance in clinical settings.
Methods: OC patients who underwent germline/somatic BRCA testing
between 2015-2020 were selected (n=86). Both debulking or biopsy sur-
gery specimens were analysed. Only FFPE specimen was used and the
most significant block was selected. B1PHM was evaluated with MS-
MLPA on selected samples (three CpG sites). A pyrosequencing assay,
considering the most investigated CpG sites in literature, was also de-
signed (fourteen CpG sites).
Results: MS-MLPA was applied in 54 cases. B1PHM was detected in all
three CpG sites in 10/54 cases (18.5%). Methylation was confirmed in
another tumour area and excluded in healthy tissue. In addition, 4/54
cases were partially methylated (18% to 23% of methylation in only
one CpG site). Pyrosequencing was performed on entire OC cohort and
MS-MLPA positive methylation status was confirmed (10/86, 12%). No
other methylated cases were identified. The methylation percentages were
comparable to those obtained by MS-MLPA and linear in all CpG sites
analysed. The partial methylation status was confirmed only in one case
(11% to 31% of methylation reproducible in all CpG sites of the CpG
island).
Conclusion: B1PHM was observed in 12% of OC, according to literature
reports, and both assays are robust in identifying B1PHM. The accurate
selection of tumour areas/healthy tissue was essential for the correct in-
terpretation of results. Given the low number of observations presented
here, studies are needed to better define the “partial methylation” status.
Furthermore, the analysis of therapeutic profile of these patients will help
to better clarify the role of B1PHM as a predictive biomarker in OC.

*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário, Portugal
Background & objectives: In the last years, urothelial carcinomas (UC)
have been tested to novel immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI).
The main goal of this study is to compare the IHC expression of PD-L1 in
UC by using SP 142, SP263 and 22C3 clones.
Methods: Forty-three samples of high-grade UC diagnosed in 2019 and
2020, corresponding to 34 males and 9 females, were selected from
Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra and tissue microarray
(TMA) were constructed. Two commercial Kits (Ventana SP142 and
Ventana SP263) and DAKO 22C3 Laboratory Developed Test (LDT)
data were analysed using the SPSS.
Results: No statistic technical issues were found between different PD-
L1 clones, especially when comparing LDT and Companion Diagnostic
Test (CDT).
There were neither technical issues in our samples, or with antibodies.
Differences were not found between female and male taking into account
the histological grade and stages at the time of diagnosis.
Female patients have higher PD-L1 22C3 (p=0.051) and SP263 positivity
(p=0.06) compared with male.
Virchows Arch
Conclusion: Anti PD-L1 treatment has been associated with an increase
of survival rate. Several studies show different agreement between tests
comparing LDT and CDT, reinforcing the importance of ongoing quality
control, laboratory personnel training and competency assessment. In our
study no relevant technical issues differences were found between PD-L1
clones. It might be explained by improved skills and technical formation
of the professionals. Therefore, our LDT protocol is optimized, since we
achieved the same IHC quality when compared with CDT protocols.

Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus variability causing the COVID-19
disease among the inhabitants of the Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship
J. Rachuna*, M. Zawierucha, M. Karpeta, Ł. Madej, P. Lewitowicz
*Jan Kochanowski University, Poland
Background & objectives: The main aim of the research is to analyse the
degree of variability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus occurring in the
Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship within one year from the outbreak of the
global COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods: The material used for the research is RNA isolated from swabs
taken from the nasopharynx of patients reporting symptoms of SARS-
CoV-2 infection. The RNA was prepared for sequencing with the
Illumina® RNA Prep, Tagmentation (L) with Enrichment kit. Then se-
quencing using the MiSeq Illumina.
Results: Analysis of the sequencing results of patient samples revealed
many different lineages of SARS-CoV-2. The samples collected from
patients in November were characterized by a variety of variants like
B.1.1.258, B1.1. or B.1.1.595. For samples obtained in March, all anal-
yses showed the presence of only variant B1.1.7. Additional KI polyoma-
virus Stockholm 60 virus infection was observed in one patient during
sample analysis. The presence of the Human adenovirus C2 was detected
in another patient.
Conclusion: The obtained results indicate the dominance of the British
variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in 2021. It also causes much more
severe symptoms. The study group will be enlarged to finally confirm
the obtained results. The rapid development of the pandemic forces the
search for new variants and the observation of the spread of the current
ones. Therefore, we plan to analyse at least 150 samples.

Background & objectives: Driver genes copy number variation (CNV)
detection is crucial for treatment management in NSCLC. The aim of this
study was to validate and compare CNVs detected by NGS panel with
those obtained by a FISH assay.
Methods: This retrospective study included NSCLC patients evaluated at
our institution from 2019 to 2020. All FFPE samples underwent routine
ERBB2 and MET FISH amplification study and a complete
morphomolecular diagnostics, CNV, fusions and gene mutations analysis
using a 52 genes NGS panel. A comparison analysis based on the number
of copies of each gene detected by each technique was performed.
Results: Series included 201 NSCLC patients. In 31 (15,4%) patients a
CNV was detected by NGS in genes not tested by FISH (MYC, FGFR1,
CCND1, NF1, EGFR, CDK6 and KRAS). FISH analysis for MYC,
FGFR1, CCND1 and EGFR confirmed the 100% of these alterations.
Considering FISH testing as the gold-standard for ERBB2 and MET
CNV, only 2 ERBB2 and 2 MET CNVs, respectively, were identified
by NGS. These 4 CNVs detected by both techniques presented more than
10 copies of each gene by FISH signal counting. In the discordant
ERBB2 FISH positive-NGS negative tumours an average of 4.3 to 7.8
ERBB2 copies were detected by FISH probably due to CNV
heterogeneity.
Conclusion: NGS panel increases the percentage of NSCLC patients
suitable for a target therapy as it screens 52 genes in one single
assay.
ERBB2 and MET FISH assay performs better than the NGS panel as it is
capable to detect CNV when less than ten copies of the gene or when
heterogeneity of CNVs are present in tumour cells.
NGS and FISH assay have the same accuracy in the detection of CNVs of
MYC, FGFR1, CCND1 and EGFR.

Validation of the Biocartis Idylla System for BRAF and KRAS mu-
tations in formalin fixed tissues
H. Sanna*, L. Fox, D. Bury
*Blackpool Victoria Hospital, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: A retrospective, single-centre study validat-
ing the use of the Biocartis Idylla v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene
homolog B (BRAF) and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS)
mutation tests for use in pan tumour types, particularly, non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC).
Methods: Archived formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue samples
from resection specimens were sourced from deceased patients, following
approval from Blackpool Teaching Hospitals Research and Development
Department. Samples include those with known mutations in the BRAF
and KRAS genes. All tests were provided by and performed using the
Biocartis Idylla system which uses real time PCR to detect mutations in
extracted DNA.
Results: The KRAS study tested samples from NSCLC patients with
unknown KRAS mutation status. Of 75 samples tested for KRAS muta-
tions 46% (n=35) of these have been found to have a KRAS mutation
within exons 2, 3 and 4 of the KRAS gene. Of these, 5.7% (n=2) have
been G12A; 20% (n=7) G12D; 28.6% (n=10) G12C; 5.7% (n=2) Q61H;
and 40% (n=14) G12V mutations.
112 (n=75 NSCLC; n=23 skin; n=6 lymph node; n=2 bone; n=6 of
each of rectum, jejunum, thyroid, trachea, pleura, FNA) samples
were tested for mutations in codon 600 of the BRAF gene. 24 sam-
ples carried a mutation (n=20 V600E; n=4 V600K) and 88 samples
had no mutation.
Conclusion: The study has shown a 46% mutation rate for KRAS muta-
tions in NSCLC samples, and with a KRAS G12C inhibitor on the hori-
zon we have shown that it is feasible to use KRAS testing as a screening
tool and for treatment stratification purposes in parallel. Results from the
BRAF validation demonstrate the ability to detect mutations in the BRAF
gene in a number of tissue types.
Funding: Biocartis have provided all test cartridges for the study.

munohistochemistry and fragment length analysis and in correlation
to the tumour mutational burden (TMB) status
J. Siemanowski*, C. Heydt, T. Buhl, R. Büttner, S. Merkelbach-Bruse
*Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Cologne, Germany
Background & objectives: Alongside prognostic value microsatellite
instability (MSI) is a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint thera-
py response.
Virchows Arch
This study evaluates MSI in colorectal cancer by ddPCR (Bio-Rad) in
comparison to immunohistochemistry (IHC), fragment length analysis
and correlates results to the TMB status.
Methods: Eleven colorectal cancer samples with known MSI status esti-
mated by IHC and MSI-PCR were tested with the ddPCR MSI Assay on
the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System (BioRad). TMB was evaluated
with the Oncomine Tumour Mutation Load Assay on the Ion S5
Sequencing System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). TMB was calculated on
the Ion Reporter 5.10 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Results: The MSI status of the eleven colorectal cancer samples were
successfully estimated by the ddPCR MSI assay. Six of the eleven sam-
ples were microsatellite instable (MSI) and five of the eleven samples
were microsatellite stable (MSS) as previously classified by IHC and
fragment length analysis. Further, the six MSI samples were all TMB
high and the five MSS samples were all TMB low. In sample 5 the
MSI status could not be determent by fragment length analysis as no
normal tissue was available. In this sample another DNA-based parallel
sequencing approach confirmed MSI.
Conclusion: This study showed that the ddPCR Microsatellite Instability
Assay can be used reliably for MSI assessment in colorectal cancer sam-
ples and demonstrated a good correlation between MSI and TMB status.

Molecular biomarkers of glioblastoma according to the latest
WHO’s classification "2016"
A. Squalli Houssaini*, G. Bennani, S. Bennis, N. Senhaji
*Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Morocco
Background & objectives: Glioblastoma is the most common and ag-
gressive primary brain tumour in adults despite therapeutic management.
The WHO classification established a diagnosis based on histological and
molecular criteria. The objective is to detect the molecular alterations in
order to improve patient survival.
Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 106 patients with
glioblastoma
Histological and immunohistochemical study (antibodies used: anti-p53,
anti-ki67, anti-ATRX and anti-IDH1) were performed.
Codon 132 of the IDH 1 gene and codon 172 of the IDH 2 gene were
amplified and sequenced.
Amplification of exon 20 of the EGFR gene was identified by qPCR and
confirmed by FISH.
Results: The patients included in the study were 72 men and 34 women,
aged 10 to 83 years with an average age of 46 years.
P53 expression is positive in 44 cases of glioblastoma patients.
Immunostaining for ki67 was positive in 88 cases. ATRX expression
was conserved in 27 of 32 cases.
The use of the anti-IDH1 antibody shows cytoplasmic and diffuse posi-
tivity in 13.2% of glioblastoma cases.
The substitution Arginine-Histidine R132H (IDH1) was detected in 14
cases marked positively by immunohistochemistry. While the substitu-
tion Arginine-lysine R172K (IDH2) was absent in all glioblastoma cases.
EGFR has been amplified by qPCR in 17 cases. Nevertheless, only 14
glioblastomas were confirmed by FISH.
Conclusion: Glioblastomas are heterogeneous tumours. A systematic
search for molecular alterations, in particular those of IDH and EGFR,
to distinguish primary from secondary glioblastomas and should be im-
posed in order to establish a good
diagnosis and better management of patients with glioblastoma. The IDH
mutation characterizes secondary glioblastomas while the EGFR gene
amplification strongly suggests the diagnosis of primary glioblastomas.

Microsatellite instability status using a next-generation sequencing
assay and Anchored Multiplex PCR chemistry
T.R. Patterson, J. Benoit, V. Johnsen, A. Licon, I. Stap*, R. Rogge
*Invitae, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Microsatellite instability (MSI) is high in
tumours with DNA mismatch repair gene deficiencies. Here we evaluate
a DNA-based Anchored Multiplex PCR (AMPTM) next-generation se-
quencing (NGS) assay designed to support parallel MSI detection and
somatic variant profiling in various tumour types.
Methods: Our VariantPlex® MSI assay examines the abundance of re-
peat lengths at 114 microsatellite loci after collapsing PCR duplicates
using molecular barcodes. The diversity of lengths is used to determine
stability at each locus. The proportion of microsatellite loci called as
unstable relative to an unmatched normal cohort enables categorization
of samples as microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) or microsatellite
stable (MSS).
Results: Our assay and prototype algorithm perform very well on previ-
ously characterized FFPE samples from multiple tissue types. When test-
ed on a set of 200 samples (50% MSI-H, 50% MSS as defined by poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) and capillary electrophoresis (CE)), we were
able to call MSI-H status with 97% sensitivity (95% binomial confidence
interval of 91.5-99.4%) and 100% specificity (96.4-100%) using a thresh-
old of >23% unstable sites for MSI-H and ≤23% for MSS. Performance
was consistent under sub-optimal conditions (low input mass, tumour
purity, and read depth) and in the context of multiple panel sizes.
Conclusion: Using tumour only FFPE-derived inputs, our assay makes
MSI status calls that are strongly concordant with a PCR and CE assay
without requiring a matched normal. Molecular barcodes incorporated
into our AMP chemistry enable unique molecule deduplication and error
correction, which support robust assay performance across a range of
conditions. Our design also functions modularly, meaning it can be used
as a stand-alone MSI solution or as part of a larger customized
VariantPlex panel.

Background & objectives: Genetic alterations disrupt key signalling
pathways in cutaneous melanomas. Alterations, which are known to be
associated with various types of melanomas and UV radiation exposure,
can help to predict targeted therapy, drug resistance, and provide insight
about progression and prognosis.
Methods: Next generation sequencing method was performed on paraf-
fin tissue blocks of 89 metastatic cutaneous melanomas which had been
diagnosed between 2017 and 2020 cases in our department. One of the
cases was insufficient. The patients’ ages were between 22 and 92 (me-
dian 67). Primary tumour blocks of 53 cases and metastatic tumour blocks
of 36 cases were used.
Results: Pathogenic variations in BRAF, NRAS, EGFR, c-KIT, KRAS,
MET genes were detected in 41 (46,59%), 5 (5,68%), 4 (4,55%), 2
(2,27%), 2 (2,27%), 1 (1,14%) of the patients, respectively.
Uncertain significance were detected in EGFR, c-KIT, KRAS, PIK3CA,
NRAS, PDGFRA, ERBB2, ERBB4 gene in 13 (14,77%), 7 (7,95%), 7
(7,95%), 6 (6,82%), 2 (2,27%), 2 (2,27%), 2 (2,27%), 2 (2,27%) of the
patients, respectively and 1 (1,14%) of the cases were detected for each of
the genes of BRAF, MET, GNAQ, FBXW7, RAF, MAP2K1, MAP2K2,
FGFR3, FGFR2, NOTCH1.
Also, likely benign alterations of 2 (2,27%) PDGFRA, 1 (1,14%) KRAS
were detected.
There was no pathogenic variation in 21 (23,86%) cases.

Conclusion: The discovery of the molecular features of melanomas con-
tinues to reveal predictive therapeutic markers, treatment approaches and
prognostic markers. Next generation sequencing methods pave the way
for advancing the knowledge about the pathogenesis of melanoma and

Dowdell, B. Bapat, B. Schroeder, M. Campbell, C. Bifulco
*Providence St. Joseph Health, USA
Background & objectives: NTRK gene fusions are pan-cancer predic-
tive diagnostics for TRK inhibitors. This study employed tumour com-
prehensive genomic profiling (CGP) using RNA and DNA hybrid cap-
ture sequencing to investigate NTRK alterations in a large patient cohort
from a community health system.
Methods: Patients in the Providence St. Joseph Healthcare system diag-
nosed with advanced cancer from July 2019 through March 2021 re-
ceived reflex CGP testing of FFPE tumours using the TruSightTM
Oncology 500 or 170 assays (Illumina, Research Use Only) as part of
their clinical care. Using deidentified electronic medical record data and
CGP results, NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 fusion transcripts were
assessed.
Results: 5,263 patients received CGP testing. 22 of 5263 (0.4%) tumours
were found to harbour an NTRK gene fusion; 3(14%) of these involved
novel fusion partners (SFPQ-NTRK1, C1orf54-NTRK1, SOX6-
NTRK2). The most frequently observed fusions were MYO5A-NTRK3
(6 cases), TPM3-NTRK1 (3), EML4-NTRK3 (2) and ETV6-NTRK3 (2).
Tumour types where >1 NTRK fusions were observed included
melanocytic lesions (8 of 69 cases), non-small cell lung carcinoma (4 of
1788), papillary thyroid carcinoma (2 of 45), and colorectal adenocarci-
noma. (3 of 522). Co-occurrences of NTRK fusions with other targetable
alterations included high MSI and TMB in 2 colorectal cases and IDH1
R132H in a glioma case.
Conclusion: While many assays have technical limitations that disallow
the detection of all relevant fusion partners, hybrid capture RNA sequenc-
ing can identify novel as well as known partners, permitting a more
complete evaluation. The low frequency of NTRK fusions in most tu-
mour types suggests that routine screening may be the most effective
approach for identifying patients who are candidates for TRK inhibitor
therapy. CGP provides a complete assessment of actionable gene alter-
ations to inform the routine clinical care of cancer patients.

*FSBEI FPE RMACPE MOH Russia
Background & objectives: The first NTRK multicentre research in tu-
mours of different localisation started in Russia in March of 2020. More
than 40 cities from all 8 regions were included in research. All tumour
samples have been analysed by 5 hospitals in Moscow.
Methods: IHC staining was made by Ventana pan-TRK (EPR17341)
antibody and OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit in Ventana
BenchMark Ultra Slide stainer. An appendix was used as normal
tissue control.
Results: For one year (from 01.03.2020 to 01.04.2021) 799 FFPE spec-
imens were tested. Broad range of tumour types was included: breast and
salivary gland secretory carcinoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, colorec-
tal carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the
head and neck, skin melanoma, infantile fibrosarcoma, mesoblastic
nephroma, soft tissue sarcomas and other.
There was 70/799 (8.7%) IHC pan-TRK-positive tumours. Cases were
assessed for staining intensity and localization. Staining of variable inten-
sity was noticed in nuclear, cytoplasm and membrane of tumour cells.
6/39 (15.3%) specimens were NTRK-fusion positive via NGS (2 cases
with FMI) and FISH (4 cases).
Conclusion: The first NTRK multicentre research have found 8.7% IHC
panTRK-positive tumours. Positive staining with confirmed NTRK fu-
sion was seen in thyroid carcinoma, breast and salivary gland secretory
carcinoma and infantile fibrosarcoma and mesoblastic nephroma.

An economic approach of preanalytical variables on quality assess-
ment of Silver In Situ Hybridization in Albania
S. Zeneli*, M. Ikonomi, M. Alimehmeti
*NUHC Mother Teresa, Albania
Background & objectives: Considering the importance of SISH, his
involvement in routine examinations is an important key of success.
Highlighting problems, optimizing and reducing the average cost are
challenges to standardization of this method at NUHC "Mother Teresa"
as only centre in Albania.
Methods: 70 patients from the University Hospital Center "Mother
Teresa" with Ad.Ca of gastrointestinal tract, who were already proved
as HER2 (2+) by immunohistochemistry were taken in exam. HER2 gene
amplification for these patients was assessed by silver in situ hybridiza-
tion method (SISH) with Ventana Benchmark XT using Single SISH,
Dual SISH and SISH Cocktail assay kit.
Results: In a cohort of 60 patients analysed with SISH method, 25% (15) of
themshowedproblemsinimplementationandunabletobeassessed.Among
the problems encountered included the presence of black and red haze, the
presenceofperipheralsignal,poorstaining,lackofsignal,etc.Afterrepeated
examinations within a short time frame, some of these problems were re-
solved. Switching to SISH cocktail kit reduced time but included higher
costs. Single SISH results were comparable with Dual SISH. HER2 gene
amplification after recurrence was observed in 35% (21) of cases.
Conclusion: Preanalytical phase preparation of samples is an essential
factor to be taken into consideration before using SISH for further review
of HER2 status in gastrointestinal Ad.Ca. Tissue fixation on 10% neutral
buffered formalin for no more than 48 hours and continuous operational
status of VENTANA Benchmark XT are essential conditions that must be
met to avoid false positive/negative results and large losses in the cost of
realization. Single SISH is a good, more economical alternative to Dual
SISH and SISH cocktail.

Giusca
*UMF "Grigore T. Popa" Iasi, Romania
Background & objectives: Renal biopsy provides relevant data for glo-
merulonephritis (GN) diagnosis. However, identical patterns are shared
by different diseases or mechanisms. We aimed to analyse the GN diag-
nosed in a Romanian referral nephropathology centre, based on their
histological and clinical features.
Methods: The study group comprised 442 biopsies performed between
2011 to 2019. The biopsy specimens were examined in immunofluores-
cence and light microscopy (hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid Schiff,
Virchows Arch
Masson trichrome, Jones silver methenamine stains, Congo red stains).
The baseline clinical characteristics included nephrotic syndrome (NS),
acute nephritic syndrome (ANS), asymptomatic urinary abnormalities,
acute kidney injury (AKI), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Results: Primary GN represented 59.5% of cases, secondary GN –
12.7%, vascular nephropathy – 7.5%, tubulointerstitial nephropathy –
1.1%. Among primary GN, membrano-proliferative GN (24.4%; 41%
of primary GN) and membranous GN (21.9%; 36.9% of primary GN)
were the most frequent diagnoses, followed by idiopathic crescentic GN
(6.1%; 12.2% of primary GN), IgA nephropathy (3.8%; 6.5% of primary
GN), FSGS (2.9%; 4.8% of primary GN). Secondary GN included lupus
nephritis (7.5%; 58.9% of secondary GN), amyloid nephropathy (2%;
16% of secondary GN), infection-related GN (1.4%; 10.7% of secondary
GN). Associated clinical features were NS (35.3%), ANS (21.9%), AKI
(20.1%), CKD (16.5%), persistent haematuria (6.1%).
Conclusion: Our study revealed the GN distribution model in the popu-
lation with renal pathology in NE Romania. The rate of biopsies was
constant. The comparison to other world renal reports showed a higher

K.E. Erdogan*, D. Cevizli, B. Atmis, A. Karabay Bayazıt, G. Gonlusen
*Cukurova University Medical Faculty Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Alport syndrome is a hereditary disorder
which is characterized by haematuria, sensorineural hearing loss and
ocular abnormalities. In this study, 14 Alport syndrome cases were re-
evaluated by clinicopathological findings to define the clues of morpho-
logical features.
Methods: Totally 14 paediatric Alport syndrome patients were enrolled
into this study. All cases were diagnosed in a single centre between 2006-
2020. Clinical, and laboratory data were obtained from medical records;
light microscopy, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy features
were correlated with clinicopathological features.
Results: Nine male and 5 female patients' mean age was 10 years old.
Familial renal failure was seen in 57,1% of all patients. The most common
clinical symptom was macroscopic haematuria (64,2%). The glomerular
filtration rate was >90 ml/min/1.73m2 except two cases had chronic renal
failure (p=0.08) at the time of diagnosis. Predominantly, patients had
mesengial proliferation (71%); fibrosis, tubular atrophy were observed
in 41% of all patients and six patients showed normal morphology under
light microscope. Immunofluorescence microscopy lacked staining ex-
cept two individuals exhibited weak C3 and weak IgM staining.
Ultrastructurally all patients had thinning, thickening and lamellation of
basement membrane (min:125-max:1000)
Conclusion: This study evaluates 14 paediatric cases with patho-
logical and clinical features. Particularly patients were in early
stage of Alport syndrome. Nonspecific morphology make the di-
agnosis difficult thus Alport syndrome should be kept in mind in
patients which have features of concordance of haematuria and
mesengial proliferation.

Application of direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy
(dSTORM) to the histological analysis of human glomerular disease
E. Garcia*, J. Lightley, S. Kumar, R. Kalita, F. Görlitz, Y. Alexandrov, T.
Cook, C. Dunsby, M. Neil, C. Roufosse, P. French
*Photonics Group, Physics Department, Imperial College London,
United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Electron microscopy (EM) is used for diag-
nosis in human glomerular diseases Single molecule localisation micros-
copy (SMLM) can extend conventional immunofluorescence to resolu-
tion near EM. We are exploring the diagnostic value of dSTORM in
frozen and paraffin-embedded clinical kidney samples.
Methods: “histoSTORM”: Immunofluorescence was carried out on frozen
and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue from renal biopsies
with Membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN); Lupus nephritis and
Minimal change disease. IgG and the Glomerular Basement Membrane
(GBM) was documented with ifluor-647 and Laminin-AF555 respectively.
using antibodies in routine clinical use. SMLM was undertaken on these
tissue sections using an opensource platform for dSTORM.
Results: histoSTORM was applied to immunofluorescence of both FFPE
and frozen histological sections using standard clinically approved anti-
bodies. dSTORM images rendered at 25 nm per pixel reveal well-defined
subepithelial deposits in MGN and enlargement of the GBM that are
consistent with those observed by EM. In a case of stage IV lupus ne-
phritis, mesangial, subendothelial and subepithelial IgG deposits are read-
ily observed with dSTORM and recapitulate the distribution of electron
dense immune complex deposits documented with EM. dSTORM also
enables GBM thickness measurements on paraffin-embedded tissue with
resolution below diffraction in a case of Minimal change disease.
Conclusion: While this study does not establish that histoSTORM can
fully replace EM in renal diagnosis, it does provide evidence of added
value relative to Light Microscopy and IF. The large dSTORM field of
view (120 μm square) and standard sample preparation make it more
convenient than EM. However, prospective studies of large case series
are required to establish its clinical utility. histoSTORM may have poten-
tial for wide clinical impact, especially in less well-resourced settings
where EM is not available.

Possible role of cell adhesion genes in the development of IgA
nephropathy
S. Marcos González*, A. Azueta Etxebarria, J. Gómez-Román, J. Freire
Salinas, E. Rodrigo Calabia
*HUMV/IDIVAL, Spain
Background & objectives: The pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy
(IgAN) isn´t yet fully understood. Previous GWAS studies have related
the development of IgAN to several gene mutations, but the potential role
of cell adhesion gene mutationsin in its pathogenesis has not been previ-
ously explored.
Methods: We included 22 patients, 14 males and 8 females, aged 18-74
years, with IgAN, from 2004 to 2019, with clinical follow-up of at least 2
years. The histological findings of all renal biopsies were reviewed, and a
total of 29 genes of cellular adhesion molecules were studied. The rate of
mutations in our IgAN patients were identified using UnifiedGenotyper.
Results: All patients have mutations. Of the 29 genes studied, we found
mutations in all of them, except for the RHOA and LPAR5 genes.
There are two genes that present mutations in all cases: TNC and FN1,
and they are non-silent. Furthermore, among the mutations found, there
are mutations that do not occur in all cases, but these mutations found are
non-silent, as are the cases of the SELE, ELN, ITGB3, LPAR3 and
LPAR4 genes.
On the other hand, there are many genes in which mutations are
found, none of them are non-silent, such as the ITGA5, ITGB1,
RHOC, LPAR1, TPM1, VCAM1, ARHGDIA, TRAM1, ACTB
and CDC42 genes.
Conclusion: The molecular study of adhesion molecules in IgAN could
allow us to identify molecular markers that allow us to obtain clear
Virchows Arch
differential mutational patterns of other primary glomerulopathies, in ad-
dition, we could classify it into subgroups and select specific therapies.

Clinical relevance of C4d-positivity in the different compartments of
transplanted kidneys
M. Kaufmann, A. Fintha, T. Micsik*
*Fejér County Hospital, Szekesfehervar 1st Department of Pathology and
Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest,
Hungary
Background & objectives: Antibody mediated rejection commonly de-
teriorates transplanted kidneys causing graft-loss. C4d-positivity in
peritubular capillaries proved to be important, but other kidney-
compartments are less investigated for C4d-staining. We aimed to evalu-
ate the clinical relevance of arteriolar and glomerular C4d-positivity and
graft survival.
Methods: Biopsies from transplanted kidneys (n=122) and explanted
allografts (n=30) from 135 patients were involved in the study based on
any C4d positivity. The specimens originated from the archive of 1st
Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research,
Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary. Presence of C4d-
positivity in any kidney compartment was correlated with laboratory
and clinical data of the graft-function and graft-survival.
Results: We found C4d staining in the glomeruli in 69 cases, in the
arteries in 39 cases and in the PTCs in 114 cases. We found a significant
correlation between C4d-positivity in the arteries and graft loss.
Furthermore, we also found significant correlation between the C4d stain-
ing of the glomeruli and decrease in long-term eGFR levels, graft func-
tion, and a correlation between PTC staining and an initially elevated
serum creatinine and urea level. However, we couldn’t find association
between C4d staining in the PTCs and long-term graft survival, which is
contrary to some literature data,
Conclusion: Our results suggest that C4d positivity in the biopsies out-
side the peritubular capillaries might have clinical relevance regarding
graft-survival and graft function, and thus may have prognostic value
for graft survival and deterioration of graft function. As our study in-
volved a relatively small number of cases, it should be further investigat-
ed in larger studies.

Crescents in glomerular diseases: evaluation of 243 kidney biopsies
with crescents
A.A. Ozagari*, K.G. Eken, F. Kabukcuoglu
*University of Health Sciences, Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Hospital,
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Crescentic glomerulonephritis (CrGN) is a
morphologic reflection of severe injury of glomeruli rather than a specific
disease. On the basis of immunopathologic features it can be classified
into three major categories: pauci-immune, anti-glomerular basement
membrane (anti-GBM), and immune complex glomerulonephritis.
Methods: Kidney biopsies with any crescents (cellular/fibrocellular)
evaluated in our department between June 2014 and March 2021 were
included in the study. Crescents were defined as extracapillary
hypercellularity of >2 cell layers involving >10% of the capsular circum-
ference composed of cells and fibrous matrix. Demographic data and final
diagnoses according to histopathological and immunofluorescence find-
ings were recorded and classified.
Results: The mean age of patients was 45 years (range 1 - 85 years).
There were 141 males and 102 females. The aetiology of CrGN was
immune complex mediated in 135 (56%), pauci-immune in 95 (39%),
and anti-GBM glomerulonephritis in 11 (5%) cases. Among immune
complex glomerulonephritis cases the most common diagnosis was IgA
nephropathy (n=82) followed by membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis (n=15), IgA vasculitis (n=12), lupus nephritis (n=7),
C3 glomerulopathy (n=4), postinfectious glomerulonephririts (n=3), and
diabetic nephropathy (n=2). The number of cases with >50% crescents
was 45 (19%). Among these, 33 (73%) cases were pauci-immune, 7
(16%) cases were anti-GBM, and 5 (11%) cases were immune complex
glomerulonephritis.
Conclusion: Crescentic glomerulonephritis could be caused by many
different aetiologies. Although some crescents can be seen in immune
complex glomerulonephritis, many studies have shown that majority of
the cases with diffuse crescents are pauci-immune glomerulonephritis,
especially in older ages. In our series when any number of crescents are
taken into account the most common diagnosis was IgA nephropathy.
However, in biopsies with more than 50% crescents the most common
diagnosis was pauci-immune glomerulonephritis compatible with previ-
ous studies.

Methylation profiling as a molecular diagnostic tool in neuropathol-
ogy: a lesson from two cases
S. Alqahtani*, A. M. Assiri
*Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, Najran University,
Saudi Arabia
Background & objectives: In the past, the diagnosis of central nervous
system (CNS) tumours was based mainly on histology. In the 2016-WHO
classification, the integration of molecular and histological features is
recommended. Many reports revealed this integration is achieved by
methylation profiling (MP).
Methods: Two cases were evaluated histologically, and the histology
was unclear or unexpected. Therefore, MP was performed. The first case,
5-year-old boy diagnosed as a case of AT/RT. The second case, a 7-year-
old boy had a glioma with atypia and anaplasia although the Ki-67 was
low.
DNA extracted and followed by 450K/EPICS array hybridization.
Automated reports are then generated by MolecularNeuropathology.org.
Results: The first case was re-evaluated after the MP, and the histopath-
ological diagnosis was not correct. The result of the MP suggested the
diagnosis as diffuse midline glioma H3 K27M mutant. The copy number
variation profile revealed a normal status of INI-1 indicating the IHC
results that showed loss of INI-1 was not conclusive.
The second case showed atypical glioma with anaplastic features histo-
logically. However, the results of MP concluded the diagnosis as a low-
grade pilocytic astrocytoma. The later observation is consistent with the
low expression of Ki-67.
Conclusion: In this study, two cases are presented to show how is effec-
tive to implement MP as a diagnostic tool. The MP in diagnostic neuro-
pathology is highly useful mainly when the tumour has unexpected/
unclear histology, affecting children, or need detailed molecular sub-
classification.

itary tumours: twenty-year experience in a single institution
M. Bronte*, M.V. Zelaya, Y. Rodriguez, M.C. Caballero, C. Cerezo,
A.A. Pasco
*Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: Tumours of the neurohypophysis
(pituicytoma, granular cell tumour, spindle cell oncocytoma) are low-
grade tumours with TTF-1 immunoreactivity. They represent a daunting
Virchows Arch
diagnostic challenge. We analyse their frequency in our hospital along with
clinical, radiologic and histologic characteristics and treatment outcome.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of histologically diagnosed
pituitary tumours in our institution from January 1999 to January 2021. Five
cases of tumours arising in neurohypophysis were found. In addition to the
histopathological information, we collected data relating to age, gender,
initial radiological diagnosis, cancer treatment and clinical follow up.
Results: From an average of 700 pituitary surgeries per year, 0, 7% result-
ed in posterior pituitary tumours (three females, two men). Mean age at
diagnosis was 62 years. Clinical symptoms were related to mass effect. One
case was an incidental finding in a clinical autopsy and four cases were
endoscopic resection specimens, with and initial pathological diagnosis of
hypophyseal adenoma and craniopharyngioma. Tumour subtypes analysis
included two pituicytomas, one spindle cell oncocytoma and two granular
cell tumours. All cases expressed nuclear TTF-1. During follow-up two
cases showed tumour persistence, one despite radiation therapy.
Conclusion: The limited number of confirmed cases in our series is
consistent with studies in the literature. Histopathological findings are
essential for the diagnosis of posterior pituitary tumours due to the lack
of specific clinical signs and radiological features. Despite a low prolif-
eration index relates to a benign behaviour, an appropriate clinical mon-
itoring and close follow up is advisable.

Comorbid Alzheimer’s and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease: micromor-
phology of colocalizing extracellular protein aggregates and neuro-
nal dystrophy
N. Jankovska*, T. Olejar, R. Matej
*Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Third Faculty of
Medicine, Charles University and Thomayer University Hospital,
Czech Republic
Background & objectives: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and sporadic
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (sCJD) are characterized by extracellular path-
ologically conformed aggregates of amyloid proteins. The aim of our
pilot study was to simultaneously visualize Aβ-, PrP- and AT8-
immunoreactive structures, to describe the micromorphology of plaques.
Methods: To investigate the potential morphological colocalization of Aβ
with PrPSc aggregates, and AT8-positive dystrophic neurites, we examined
the hippocampal regions (archicortex and neocortex) of 20 subjects with
confirmed comorbid AD and sCJD using neurohistopathological analyses,
immunohistochemical methods, and confocal fluorescent microscopy.
Results: Our data showed that extracellular Aβ and PrPSc aggregates
tended to be, in most cases, located separately, and “compound” plaques
were relatively rare. We observed PrPSc plaque-like structures in
the periphery of the non-compact parts of Aβ plaques, as well as
in tau protein-positive dystrophic structures. Our data showed that
PrPSc aggregation could dominate during co-aggregation with
non-compact Aβ in the periphery of Aβ plaques. The main types
of Aβ and PrPSc plaque colocalizations identified were: (1) non-
compound and minimal compound plaques, (2) central core de-
posits, and (3) diffuse plaques.
Conclusion: The results as presented indicate that a specific subset
of Aβ, in particular the non-compact component of Aβ plaque,
where Aβ42 predominates, exhibits higher levels of interaction
with PrPSc and, thus, in certain circumstances, could be assumed
to act as the PrPSc seeds within the brain. The AD score, and
prion protein subtype with codon 129 methionine–valine (M/V)
polymorphisms in sCJD, while representing key characteristics
of these diseases, did not correlate with the morphology of the
Aβ/PrPSc co-aggregates.

Epidermoid cysts of the brain: clinicopathological report of 4 cases
M. Khaba*, N.A. Dube
*Department of Anatomical Pathology, National Health Laboratory
Service, Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University, South Africa
Background & objectives: Epidermoid cysts are rare benign lesions of
the central nervous system that accounts for approximately 1 – 2% of all
intracranial tumours. They arise from entrapped cells of the mesectoderm
that originate from the neural crest during foetal development.
Methods: This is a retrospective study of epidermoid cyst of the brain
diagnosed between 01 January 2014 – 31 December 2020. Clinical in-
formation, radiological investigations and hematoxylin and eosin-stained
sections were retrieved and reassessed.
Results: The four patients had mean age of 30,8 years (range: 3 – 63), one
male and 3 females. All four patients presented with headache and one
associated with seizures. On CT and MRI of the brain, two patients had
posterior fossa, one occipital and one extra-axial tumours. Two patients
with posterior fossa tumours had associated hydrocephalus. All tumours
were successfully removed, and histopathological assessment confirmed
epidermoid cysts. All patients showed clinical improvement and were
discharged home.
Conclusion: Epidermoid cysts of the brain are rare and still remain a
preoperative clinico-radiological conundrum as they may be indistin-
guishable from other intracranial tumours. Therefore, collaboration with
histopathologists is advised in the management of these cases.

*Department of Anatomical Pathology, National Health Laboratory
Service, Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University, South Africa
Background & objectives: Central nervous system tumours are the most
common solid tumours in paediatric population with associated increased
morbidity and mortality. However, few studies regarding paediatric cen-
tral nervous system has been undertaken in the African continent includ-
ing South Africa.
Methods: This is a retrospective histopathological analysis of paediatric
central nervous system tumours diagnosed between 01 January 2012 – 31
December 2020. Clinical information and hematoxylin and eosin-stained
sections were retrieved and reassessed.
Results: The study consisted of 24 patients with mean age of 5,45 years
(range: 1 - 18), 19 males and 5 females. The histopathological diagnosis
consisted of 6 pilocytic astrocytoma (25 %); 4 medulloblastoma (16,7 %);
2 meningioma WHO grade I, embryonal tumour, atypical teratoid
rhabdoid tumour, craniopharyngioma and pineoblastoma, each (8,3 %);
1 gliosarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET), choroid plex-
us papilloma and arteriovenous malformation (4,2 %).
Conclusion: Our study had equal distribution of benign and malignant
tumours. In accord with existing literature, pilocytic astrocytoma and
medulloblastoma were the common benign and malignant tumour,
respectively.

SARS-CoV-2 and skeletal muscle. Autopsy case series
F. Leiva-Cepas*, A. Sanz Zorrilla, A. Martínez, R. Sánchez Sánchez, R.
Ortega Salas
*University Hospital "Reina Sofía", Spain
Background & objectives: Early studies have indicated that there is also
considerable musculoskeletal dysfunction in some COVID-19 patients,
although long-term follow-up studies have yet to be performed. The
Virchows Arch
objective of this work is to identify histopathological lesions in patients
who died from COVID19.
Methods: There have been 13 autopsies of patients who died by COVID-
19, (4 deaths were occurred due to another circumstance not related to
COVID19). Samples were taken for study in freezing, paraffin, electron
microscopy and microbiology of deltoid and psoas muscles, and the
quadriceps anterior muscle in some times. The clinical history was
analysed to identify neuromuscular signs and symptoms.
Results: The muscles analysed showed non-specific degenerative-regen-
erative processes. And no nuclear internalizations were seen. Angulated
fibres and atrophy were found in two psoas muscles of two patients with>
3 months of admission, with isolated target-type fibres, probably related
to critical patient myopathy. No vasculitic or thrombotic findings were
identified. Immunostaining for this virus was negative, a fact that was
confirmed with RT-PCR.
Conclusion: With the data available in our series, it cannot be stated that
skeletal muscle presents lesions typical of SARS-CoV-2 infection, nor
has the presence of the virus been demonstrated by immunohistochemis-
try or RT-PCR, despite the fact that 8 patients had PCR positive in the
naso-pharyngeal exudate.

Tumoral recurrences and anaplastic transformation
of ganglioglioma: a 9-year study from a single
neuropathology unit
A.C. Lisievici*, S. Barbu, T. Georgescu, F. Pop, M. Sajin, M.G. Lisievici
*Emergency University H. Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Ganglioglioma represents a benign mixed
neuronal-glial tumour, occurring most commonly in the paediatric popu-
lation and frequently located in the temporal lobe. Anaplastic transforma-
tion of gangliogliomas has been reported in less than 35 cases in the
scientific literature.
Methods: This is a retrospective study including all gangliogliomas,
benign or atypical, that recurred or underwent anaplastic transformation
during a period of 9 years (2012-2020). Nine cases were identified and
clinical and imaging data was retrieved from the virtual database and from
the clinical charts. We thoroughly re-examined all Hematoxylin-Eosin,
aiming to establish correlations that could predict the poor outcome.
Results: Clinically, 44.4% were located in the parietal lobe, while 22.2%
affected the temporal lobe and only 55.5% presented with epileptic sei-
zures. Atypical features, suggestive for the diagnosis of atypical
ganglioglioma were present in 55.5% of the initial cases. 44.4% of cases
have had anaplastic progression, 75% of these cases evolving towards an
anaplastic ganglioglioma and 25% towards a glioblastoma. Mean follow-
up was 53 months, period in which 75% of those who had anaplastic
transformation have had a fatal outcome. Histologically, rare neuronal
mitoses were identified in 44% of cases and, correlating with those cases
that have had an anaplastic transformation. Perivascular inflammation
was present in only 55.5% of cases.
Conclusion: Our study shows that the presence of recurrences and ana-
plastic transformation is more often encountered in adults with a mean
age of 39 years and in cases with an atypical location. From a histological
point of view, only the presence of atypical neuronal mitoses correlated
with progression to anaplasia, while those who showed recurrences, only
rarely showed this feature. Close follow-up of these cases can lead to
early detection of those cases that have the potential to progress
histologically.

Cerebral tuberculoma: a challenging diagnosis
M. Mellouli*, F. Kolsi, I. Cherif, M. Triki, C. Chaari, T. Boudawara, M.
Bouhamed
*Habib Bourguiba Hospital Department of Pathology, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Tuberculosis of the central nervous system is
rare. Tuberculomas may be solitary or multiple and may be indistinguish-
able from cranial abscess or primary brain tumour. We report 4 cases of
cerebral tuberculoma and discuss their histological differential diagnosis.
Methods: We retrospectively analysed a clinical series of 4 cases of
intracranial tuberculoma treated between 2012 and 2021 in the depart-
ment of neurosurgery of Habib Bourguiba University Hospital of Sfax
Tunisia. Analysis comprised medical records, clinical imaging, surgical
management, histological findings and adjuvant strategies. A review of
the current literature was performed.
Results: There were 3 females and a male patients with age range from 9
to 63 years (mean 32.5). The serological test for HIV was negative in all
patients. A long term fever was described in 2 cases. Headache was the
most common symptom. We did not found an extra cerebral location of
the disease in all cases. CT scan and MRI were performed with all pa-
tients, showing a unique supra tentorial lesion with a mean size of 4.5 cm.
The lesion was totally removed in 2 cases. A biopsy was done in the other
cases. The patients were discharged from the hospital and treated with
multi-drug anti tuberculous therapy.
Conclusion: Cerebral tuberculomas are a rare and serious form of tuber-
culosis due to the haematogenous spread of Mycobacterium
Tuberculosis. Symptoms and radiologic features are nonspecific, leading
sometimes to misdiagnosis. Differential diagnoses depend on the stage of
lesion and can include cysticercosis, brain abscess, gliomas, toxoplasmo-
sis, etc. Surgical excision helped to establish the histological diagnosis.
Negative results from the bacterial examination do not eliminate the tu-
berculous infection. Multidrug chemotherapy is highly efficacious in the
management of intracranial tuberculomas.

Boudawara, M. Bouhamed
*Habib Bourguiba Hospital Department of Pathology, Tunisia
Background & objectives: A variety of microorganisms can cause in-
fections in the central nervous system (CNS). Although less invasive
testing is preferred, surgical biopsy may be necessary. The aim of this
study is to discuss histologic features of CNS infections.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the epidemiological and histolog-
ic features of CNS infections diagnosed at Habib Bourguiba's Hospital
from 2010 to 2020.
Results: Twenty-eight cases were collected. Patients were aged between
2 and 73 years (mean age: 31.9). The sex ratio was 1.5. The study includ-
ed 9 immunocompetent and 19 immunocompromised individuals.
Pathological examination identified the pathogen in 10 cases. The
aetiology of CNSI was echinococcosis in 4 cases, tuberculosis in 3 cases,
toxoplasmosis in 2 cases and cryptococcosis in 1 case. Special stains were
used in 78% of cases. The colouring used were Periodic Schiff Acid
(PAS) stain in 20 cases, Gomori-Grocott stain in 18 cases and Ziehl
Nielson staining in 2 cases. All these stains were carried out manually.
An immunohistochemical study was not used in any case.
Conclusion: Standard histopathologic evaluation of tissue, including spe-
cial stains, can provide a great deal of information about infections
through identification of characteristic inflammatory patterns and by di-
rect visualization of organisms. Further characterization can be achieved
by immunohistochemistry and molecular assays.

*Institute of Physiology of NAS of Belarus
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Current theories of epileptogenesis include
neuronal dysfunction and glial cell activation as a reason of sei-
zures development. The aim of this study was to analyse glial cell
density in epileptic focus of brain tissue from patient with drug-
resistant epilepsy.
Methods: We analysed glial cellular density of cortex brain slides from
14 patients who underwent surgical resection of epileptogenic focus. The
immunohistochemistry antibody as a GFAP, IBA-1 and Olig-2 were
used. Count glial cell was done in 8-10 non-overlapping fields at high
power magnification (x400, HPF). The area of HPF was 66585.8 μm2.
Cellular density (CD) was presented as a cell/mm2.
Results: Foci of “active” and “non-active” gliosis were found in analysed
brain tissue from all patients. The “active” gliosis was identified as a foci
of increased glial cell density compare with all surrounding brain tissue in
specimen from each case. The median of CD of astrocytes was 148.96
(119.16;178.74) cells/mm2 in “active" gliosis and 74.48 (44.69;89.37)
cells/mm2 in “non-active” gliosis (p=0.000). The median of CD of
microglial cells was 178.74 (104.27;223.43) cells/mm2 in “active" gliosis
and 74.48 (44.69;119.16) cells/mm2 in “non-active” gliosis (p=0.000).
The median of CD of oligodendrocytes was 685.19 (446.87; 968.21)
cells/mm2 in “active" gliosis and 528.79 (283.01;722.44) cells/mm2 in
“non-active” gliosis (p=0.000).
Conclusion: Epileptogenic focus of patient’s brain with drug-resistant
epilepsy was characterized by “mosaic” glial changes with foci of “ac-
tive” and “non-active” gliosis. An “active” gliosis was detected as a local
focus of glial cell (astrocytes, microglial cells and oligodendrocytes)
proliferation.

Fuertes, M.C. Caballero, M.V. Zelaya, I. Martinez Valbuena
*Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) de-
velop motor symptoms but also suffer from non-motor symptoms. These
latter symptoms may be caused by pathological deposits of phosphory-
lated alpha-synuclein (PAS) in the peripheral nervous system or in other
organs, we´ll study this hypothesis.
Methods: We have reviewed 171 autopsies to study by immunohisto-
chemistry the deposition of PAS in kidneys, adrenal, thyroid and pitui-
tary. The sample includes 36 patients with synucleopathies [PD,
dementia/incidental Lewy bodies (DLB/ DLBD), 85 patients with
Alzheimer's disease, and 50 patients without histological alterations in
the central nervous system. We evaluate the presence/absence of this
protein in the aforementioned locations.
Results: In all the organs evaluated, alpha-synuclein deposition was
higher in patients with CNS pathology than in the control group. If
we compare the diseases grouped together, the synucleopathies are
the ones in which the most deposits of PAS were observed, and
within them PD. Of note is the thyroid gland in PD patients, where
it increases from 21% in the control group to 75%. This finding is
also observed in the other organs studied (adrenal 13% vs 31%,
adenohypophysis 4% vs 10%, neurohypophysis 3% vs 29% and
kidney 17% vs 54%).
PAS deposition has been observed within epithelial cells except in the
neurohypophysis, which is in neural cells.
Conclusion: PAS deposition is observed in epithelial cells outside the
central and peripheral nervous system in all the organs studied, with a
greater accumulation of this protein in PD patients than in the rest of the
pathologies or in the control group. The accumulation of Pas in kidney
and endocrine organs may be responsible for the appearance of non-
motor symptoms in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The in-
crease in the thyroid in PD patients is particularly striking.

*Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: Immunodeficiency-associated lymphoprolif-
erative disorders (IALD) is an uncommon entity observed in immuno-
compromised. It is a challenge for the neuropathologist due to not suspect
affectation of central nervous system (CNS). We describe the frequency
of CNS pathology IALD related in our hospital.
Methods: Retrospective review of histological diagnosis of IALD in
CNS from 1993 to 2021. The following parameters were recorded: age,
gender, clinical-radiological findings, histopathological disorder, type of
immunodeficiency and their outcome.
Results: 12 cases were find with a median age at diagnosis of 53 years
with a male predominance. All cases were caused by secondary immu-
nosuppression: 6 HIV related, 1 post-transplant and 5 were iatrogenic.
Initial clinical diagnosis were: brain tumour, infection or inflammation.
Histologically the most common IALD was diffuse large B cell lympho-
ma (DLBCL) and positivity for EBV was more than 80%. One patient
had radiological improvement, two remains in complete remission five
years after diagnosis and eight patients died. There is no outcome infor-
mation available from one patient.
Conclusion: IALD are a differential diagnosis to consider in immuno-
compromised patients with a radiological image of brain tumour. Our
study shows the importance of neurological follow-up in patients under
immunosuppression treatment. In HIV positive patients the IALD most
frequent was primary CNS lymphoma as it is described in the
literature.High prevalence of EVB infection is associate with IALD in
immunocompromised patients.

Anaut, Y. Laplaza, A. Panizo, D. Guerro Setas
*Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: Advances in predictive biomarkers for
targeted therapy have increased therapeutic options in brain metastasis.
We describe clinical-pathological features in CNS metastasis from lung
carcinomas and compare the difference between their molecular profiles,
if available.
Methods: We performed a retrospective review of histological diagnosis
in nine cases of metastatic lung carcinoma to CNS. Gender, age and
histopathological data of both metastasis and primary tumour tissue were
collected. In metastatic tissue, molecular analysis was done by panel-
based next generation sequencing (NGS), fluorescent in situ hybridiza-
tion (FISH) was used for diagnosis of the primary tumour when available.
Results: We found 9 patients (7M/2W) with CNS metastasis from pul-
monary tumours; the median age at diagnosis was 62 years. 6 patients
debuted with brain space-occupying lesions. 2 patients had recurrent CNS
metastasis after surgical resection. 8 adenocarcinomas and 1 squamous
lung carcinoma were found. In 8 cases molecular analysis of metastatic
tissue with NGS resulted in pathogenic allelic variants (KRAS, BRAF,
CCND1, androgen receptor and ROS gene), in 65% there were a double
gene alteration. BRAF mutation was not actionable whereas ROS fusion
is crucial for ROS1-targeted TKIs. FISH technique was available for
molecular analysis in 5 samples from the primary tumour, resulting in
the absence of ALK fusion gene.
Conclusion: Although CNS metastasis from primary lung tumours are
frequent, pathological and molecular data are not always available, espe-
cially in old previous cases. It is challenging to analyse CNS lesions by
Virchows Arch
high-throughput sequencing technologies (NGS) for detection of new
molecular findings in metastatic tissue not present in the primary tumour
when the initial diagnosis was made. In contrast to classic molecular
techniques like FISH, NGS provides the possibility to identify pathogenic
allelic variants, many of them actionable by approved drugs.

Ocular melanoma; a five-year single institutional experience and the
need for novel therapy
K. Adoke*, M. Sanusi Haruna
*Department of pathology Federal Medical Center Birnin Kebbi, Nigeria
Background & objectives: Ocular melanoma (OM) is the second most
common type of melanoma after cutaneous melanoma. It is divided into
uveal and nonuveal. Uveal melanoma consist of choroid, ciliary body and
iris melanoma. Prognosis is based on mutational status of BAP1 genes.
Methods: This is a five-year prospective study of OM in our institution.
Data of Patients were documented and followed for 8 months. Specimen
collected were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, cut at 3μ and stained with
routine H&E stain. Immunohistochemical stains used were S-100 and
HMB 45. Data was analysed using SPSS version 24.
Results: Twelve cases of OM were seen during the study period with a
mean age of 47.6±18.3 and male female ratio of 1.4:1. Uveal melanoma
consists of 7(17.1%) choroid, 2(4.9%) ciliary melanoma and 3 (7.3%) con-
junctival melanoma. All cases were positive for S-100 and HMB 45. Two
cases of choroidal melanoma had early metastasis to the liver while only a
single case was seen in the paediatric age group. High mortality was seen in
five patients with choroidal melanoma after surgery and chemotherapy.
Conclusion: OM is gradually becoming common in our environment
with choroidal melanoma having a dismal prognosis. Exploring novel
therapies like targeted and immunotherapy may give hope in the future
for our patients especially those with metastatic disease.

The role of macrophages in the angiogenesis of uveal melanoma and
its metastasis
E. Kazachkov*, A. Shamanova, I. Panova, A. Vagenin, T. Shamaeva, E.
Glazyrina
*South Ural State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: Vascular-like mimicry of melanoma cells
increases the risk of metastasis. Data on the creation of pseudovascular
network by macrophages are scant. The aim is to assess macrophagal
pseudovessels in uveal melanoma.
Methods: 299 enucleated eyes with uveal melanoma from 145 males and
154 females were studied in 2013-2018; exposure Group 1 - tumours
without metastases (n = 258), exposure Group 2 - verified distant metasta-
ses in liver (n = 24). Immunohistochemical (CD68, CD 34, D2-40, CD31)
testing was performed on tissue samples (Group1, N=28; Group 2, N= 17).
Results: In tumours of group 2, there are more macrophages than in non-
metastatic melanoma: 202.5 (152.25; 254.5) versus 107 (67.23; 145.3) (p
= 0.007), as well as a greater volumetric density of macrophage
pseudovessels: 6.32 (4.9; 8.03) versus 3.22 (1.3; 3.7), p = 0.05) (p =
0.007), and lower volumetric density of blood vessels (3.95 (2.68; 5.09)
versus 5.31 (4.43; 5.97), p = 0.053). There is an inverse, average strength
correlation between the volumetric density of the vessels and the number
of macrophages. There is a greater vascularization and smaller infiltration
by macrophages in spindle cell melanomas.
Conclusion: It has been determined that macrophages in uveal melanoma
are capable of vascular-like mimicry. The volumetric density of blood
vessels and the number of macrophages in the experimental groups have
statistically significant differences. Immunohistochemical markers were
used in the study of blood vessels, tumour cell microenvironment and the
pseudovascular spaces formed by them: the results obtained by them can
be used to predict distant metastases of uveal melanoma.

Morphological changes of Descemet’ membrane and the disturbance
of ocular immune privilege in eyes with chronic corneal oedema
(Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) and bullous
keratopathy)
E. Kogan*, N. Fisenko, T. Demura, K. Avetisov
*Sechenov University, Russia
Background & objectives: Chronic corneal oedema is associated with
FECD or endothelial damage – bullous keratopathy (BK). The purpose is
to explore morphological structure of Descemet’ membrane (DM) and
analyse aqueous humor (AqH) cytokine levels in patients with corneal
oedema.
Methods: 29 patients with chronic corneal oedema (18 FECD and 11
BK), underwent endothelial keratoplasty. Intraoperatively obtained
EDMs were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. A light microscopic mor-
phometric analysis was performed (Leica DM-2500, ImageScope M). 37
AqH samples were collected from 29 patients during endothelial kerato-
plasty and from 8 patients with senile cataract (control). The AqH cyto-
kine levels were measured with multiplex immunoassay.
Results: There was no difference in thickness of DM’ prenatal anterior
banded layer (2.27±0.61 μm) and postnatal posterior non-banded layer
(11.0±2.14 μm) between BK and normal adult cornea. In FECD eyes DM
was thickened due to additional collagen layer and guttate excrescences
(postnatal layer thickness – 16.08±2.1 μm, p<0.0005), while prenatal
anterior banded layer was similar to that zone in BK (2.89±1.38 μm,
p=0.134). IL-6, IL-8, IFNγ, MCP-1 were elevated in FECD and BK
groups compared to control (p<0.01). IL-13 was statistically lower in eyes
with FECD and BK, than in the control (p<0.05). There was no signifi-
cant difference in AqH cytokine levels between FECD and BK.
Conclusion: Chronic corneal oedema is related to different morpholog-
ical changes of EDM in FECD and BK. The increased expression of IL-6
and IL-8 in the AqH of patients with chronic corneal oedema features
severe local immunogenic inflammation. High preoperative levels of
IFNγ, MCP-1 indicate Th1 immune response. The decreased expression
of IL-4 and IL-13 shows the suppression of Th2 immunity. Thus, chronic
corneal oedema is the condition associated with the disturbance of ocular
immune privilege, leading to local inflammation and fibrosis.

Inflamed juvenile conjunctival naevus: a case report and review of
the literature on a challenging lesion
N.J. Lamas*, A.P. Rodrigues, J.R. Alves, J.R. Vizcaíno
*Anatomic Pathology Service, Department of Pathology, Centro
Hospitalar e Universitário do Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Inflamed juvenile conjunctival naevi (IJCN)
constitute challenging lesions to diagnose because of their accelerated
growth and atypical histological features, which raise the suspicion of
malignancy for both patients and treating medical doctors.
Methods: We report the case of a 12-year-old boy who presented with a
vascularized conjunctival lesion displaying fast growth during the pre-
ceding couple of months. The lesion was excised, and we received a
fragment of conjunctiva measuring 8x6x2 mm and presenting a well-
defined 5x4 mm grey macula.
Results: The histological analysis showed conjunctival mucosa with
intraepithelial and stromal proliferation of melanocytes without signifi-
cant atypia, associated with solid and cystic epithelial inclusions with
preservation of goblet cells. Pleomorphism was scant and necrosis was
not identified. In the stromal component there was 1 mitosis figure per 10
Virchows Arch
high-power fields. A moderate to intense inflammatory infiltrate contain-
ing numerous lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils was observed
associated with the melanocytic proliferation. Rare primary lymphoid
follicles were also identified. Fibrosis or lesions of obliterative phlebitis
were not evident. The immunohistochemistry study using double label-
ling with HMB-45/Ki-67 revealed a proliferative index below 5%.
Conclusion: This case illustrates the main features of this infrequent and
unique lesion, which has features distinctive from the common com-
pound conjunctival naevus. The recommended treatment is complete ex-
cision, and the prognosis is typically excellent. Currently, our patient
remains well, without signs of lesional recurrence.

An audit of outcomes for uveal melanoma patients treated with pri-
mary enucleation versus primary radiation therapy between 2011
and 2020
A. Mcintosh*, C. Lee, N. Walsh, S. Reilly, M. O'Sullivan, N. Horgan, J.
Crown, S. Kennedy
*Research Foundation, Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, Ireland
Background & objectives: The one-year survival rate for metastatic
uveal melanoma patients is approximately 15%. We aim to provide an
examination of patient outcomes which compares uveal melanoma pa-
tients treated with enucleation versus plaque brachytherapy as their pri-
mary treatment modality.
Methods: From our database of over 1,000 uveal melanoma cases within
the age range of 11 to 95 years, 257 relevant cases between the years 2011
and 2020 were extracted. Relevancy was determined based on patient
primary treatment. Clinical information from charts and histopathology
reports was analysed.
Results: The mean age of this cohort at time of treatment was 62 years.
145 patients were males and 112 females. 136 received primary enucle-
ations, with mean age of 64. Mean largest tumour dimension (LTD) was
14mm [range 5-23]. 30% of which, metastasised. Using metastasis as a
surrogate for death, all are assumed deceased. 121 received plaque
brachytherapy, with a mean age of 60. Mean LTD was 9mm [range 1-
19]. 8% recurred locally leading to enucleation. 15% metastasised.
Metastasis was used as a surrogate for death. A subgroup of 94 choroidal
tumour enucleation patients with no extra-ocular extension and an aver-
age LTD of 13mm [range 5-19], displayed a 22% metastatic rate.
Conclusion: Metastatic disease is linked directly to the mortality rate for
patients with uveal melanoma. Approximately 50% of patients die due to
metastatic disease. Of our cohort, there was a 46% metastatic rate, with 30%
in the enucleation group and 15% in the brachytherapy group. When a
subgroupofenucleatedpatientswithsizemostsimilartothoseofthebrachy-
therapy patients was analysed, the metastatic rates for enucleation patients
dropped to 22%. Further analysis of the two groups is currently underway.

Signet-ring cell/histiocytoid carcinoma of the eyelid - clinicopatholog-
ic analysis of two cases
I.M. Michalek*, O. Stanowska, J. Zwoliński, M. Durzyńska
*Department of Pathology and Laboratory Diagnostics, Maria
Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, Warsaw,
Poland
Background & objectives: Signet-ring cell/histiocytoid carcinoma (HC)
is a rare entity, with about 40 cases reported worldwide. It is considered
aggressive and concerns mainly eyelids, seldomly axillae. The diagnosis
is challenging; data on survival and optimal therapy are limited.
Methods: We report the clinical, histological, and immunohistochemical
features of two novel eyelid-located HC cases: 71- and 66-year-old men.
Patient 1 and 2, respectively, both with diffuse thickening of the involved
skin. Patient 1 presented with ptosis and supraclavicular
lymphadenopathy. By Patient 2, the swelling of the eyelid extended to
the adjacent cheek.
Results: The eyelid thickening had been clinically misinterpreted as
inflammatory/ infectious/ haematological disorders, delaying the
correct diagnosis in both cases. Microscopy revealed diffuse infil-
tration of the dermis by single rows of signet-ring cells character-
ized by eccentric nuclei displaced by vacuolated cytoplasm. We
differentiated the observations mainly with gastrointestinal-tract-
derived adenocarcinomas and metastatic lobular carcinoma of the
breast. Immunohistochemically, the cells expressed CK7, E-
cadherin, CEA, EMA, and GCDFP15. In both cases, tumour cells
expressed the androgen receptor (AR). Thorough clinical examina-
tion allowed for excluding metastases originating from the gastro-
intestinal tract and lobular breast carcinoma.
Conclusion: HC of the eyelid is a rare entity diagnosed by exclusion. One
of our report's more significant findings is that AR might be expressed in
the HC cells, constituting a possible therapeutic target in HC patients. The
small sample size did not allow to assess the generalizability of the find-
ings. Considerably more work will need to be done to determine whether
AR expression modifies the survival and efficacy of implemented
therapies.

The evaluation of ocular melanoma based on pathologic prognostic
factors: a 10-year experience of a single centre
A.M. Pop*, A.C. Tinca, O.S. Cotoi
*George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, and
Technology of Târgu Mureș, Romania
Background & objectives: Ocular melanoma is the second most com-
mon type of melanoma, with increasing incidence and limited therapeutic
options. This study aimed to review the histopathological features with
prognostic impact of ocular melanoma cases diagnosed in a single
Romanian centre.
Methods: A retrospective analysis on all cases of ocular melanoma diag-
nosed between 2011-2020 in the Department of Pathology of the Mureș
County Clinical Hospital was conducted. The following parameters were
recorded: age and gender, tumour localization, histologic subtype, mitotic
rate, ciliary body and optic nerve invasion, extraocular extension and
immunohistochemical evaluation.
Results: There were 12 cases in 8 males (66.7%) and 4 females (33.3%),
with a mean age of 61.75±12.85 years. 11 were localized in the uvea
(91.7%) and one in the conjunctiva (8.3%). Retinal detachment was pres-
ent in 5 cases (41.7%), the involvement of the ciliary body in 2 cases
(16.7%), while in one case (8.3%) both optic nerve invasion and
extraocular extension were identified. Most cases were mixed type
(58.3%) and the mean mitotic rate was 1.23±0.77 mitoses/mm2 (range
0-3). The tumour cells stained positive for S100 (58.3%), SOX10 (50%),
Melan-A (41.7%) and HMB45 (25%). Ki67 proliferation rate with a
value of 1-2% was analysed in 3 cases (25%).
Conclusion: Most of the cases presented at least one poor prognostic
factor such as ciliary body involvement, extraocular extension and epi-
thelioid cell type, which implies a high risk for metastasis and shorter
survival time. As recent data suggest that S100 is frequently weak in
ocular melanoma, we should extend the use of SOX10, Melan-A,
HMB45 and Ki67 proliferation rate, the last being an important prognos-
tic factor.

Background & objectives: Ocular tumours are uncommon, divided into
intraocular, adnexal (conjunctiva, eyelid), and orbital tumours. There are
several types of benign and malignant tumours that can endanger func-
tional and vital prognosis. We aim to analyse epidemiological and path-
ological features of these tumours.
Methods: This is a retrospective and descriptive study of 69 ocular tu-
mours diagnosed at our department during a period of 12 years (from
2010 to 2021).
Results: Fifty-two adult cases and 17 paediatric cases were identified.
The mean age was 43 years (2 – 94 years). The sex ratio was 1.22. The
most common location was the conjunctiva (41.6%) followed by the orbit
(33.3%), the eyelid (18.9%), and intraocular (7.2%). Malignant tumours
represented 49.3%. Histological subtypes varied according to the loca-
tion. Conjunctival tumours were dominated by nevi (9 cases) and squa-
mous cell carcinoma (SCC) (6 cases). Orbital tumours were represented
mainly by benign cysts (10 cases) and lymphoma (5 cases). Tumours of
the eyelid were basal cell carcinoma (BCC) (8 cases) and seborrheic
keratosis (5 cases). Intraocular tumours were uveal melanoma (3 cases)
and retinoblastoma (2 cases).
Conclusion: Ocular tumours are very diverse and can affect all tunics.
The most frequent primary intraocular tumours are uveal melanoma in
adults and retinoblastoma in small children. Conjunctival tumours are
dominated by melanocytic tumours especially nevi followed by epithelial
ones. SCC is the most common carcinoma of the conjunctiva. Most
frequent palpebral malignant tumours are BCC and SCC. Orbital malig-
nant tumours are mainly represented by metastases, lacrimal gland tu-
mours, and lymphomas in adults and rhabdomyosarcoma in children.

Analysis of lumican expression in corneal dystrophies
V. Zakharava*, G. Semak, I. Zherka, P. Yudin
*Belarusian State Medical University, Belarus
Background & objectives: Lumikan ensures corneal stroma transparen-
cy. Its expression can increase in epithelium upon regeneration activation.
Aim: to establish the patterns of lumican expression in corneal explants of
patients with corneal dystrophies and its changes 1% low molecular
weight sodium hyaluronate application.
Methods: The prospective study included 37 patients: dystrophies in the
outcome of keratitis (20 cases), endothelial epithelial dystrophy (EED)
(17 cases). Patients were divided into 2 comparable groups. The first
received 1% HA injections before keratoplasty. For immunohistochemi-
cal study primary monoclonal antibodies to lumikan applied. The propor-
tion of pixels with high intensity (positivity) and the index of expression
intensity calculated.
Results: In corneal dystrophies after keratitis after sodium hyaluronate
application, the positivity of expression in the stroma decreased (72,5
[IQR 70,8-78,3] vs 94,2 [IQR 92,9- 94,6], р=0,004). While the intensity
increased (139 [IQR 134-145] vs 93 [IQR 89-97], р=0,004). Epithelial
expression positivity was higher after HA application in corneal dystro-
phy after keratitis (97,3 [IQR 96,6;98,1 vs 91,0 [IQR 69,9-94,7],
р˂0,001). In hereditary EED stromal expression positivity increased after
treatment with HA (90,0 [IQR 88,2-91,0] vs 81,5 [IQR 10,9-86,7],
р=0,06). While intensity decreased (95 [IQR 94-100] vs 125 [IQR 115-
186], р=0,007). The same dynamics of changes in positivity and intensity
of lumican stromal expression was observed in the group of acquired
EED.
Conclusion: An increase of epithelial lumican expression after the use of
1% sodium hyaluronate indicates the activation of regeneration processes
and correlates with clinical signs of an improvement in the condition and
an increase in the transparency of the cornea. The study of the stromal
expression of lumican showed that an important factor is its normal con-
tent in the corneal stroma, since both a sharp increase and low expression
parameters are accompanied by a decrease in the transparency of the
cornea.
Funding: To develop a method for the treatment of patients with dystro-
phic corneal diseases, based on the restoration of protective mechanisms

Forensic analysis of mortality in women of reproductive age
S. Adilbek*, B. Zholdasov, S. Zhashkeyev, D. Akhmetzhanov
*Karaganda Medical University, Kazakhstan
Background & objectives: The unnatural death of women of reproduc-
tive age has a serious psychological, social impact on the family and
society. Deaths among women of reproductive age were investigated in
order to see trends in terms of causes and patterns of death.
Methods: The research team included 328 forensic autopsies of women
of reproductive age conducted between 2016 and 2020 years in Central
Kazakhstan. In the course of the study, the following methods were used:
clinical and statistical, clinical and epidemiological, clinical and psycho-
pathological, mathematical and statistical (using Student's t test for rela-
tive values and Pearson's association coefficient).
Results: The predominant method of suicide was poisoning in 42.3%
cases, followed by hanging (34.9%), burns (11.4%), drowning (9.4%).
These four methods are 98% of the total suicidal deaths in this study
cohort. The married women were 63.1% of suicide victims. Among
women who committed suicide attempts, persons with the following
socio-demographic characteristics predominated: age under 40
(63.25%), secondary education (64.46%), social status of workers
(43.37%), low income (91.57%). Among various social groups of the
female population, the highest rates of prevalence of suicidal attempts
noted in the group of unemployed able-bodied persons, where their fre-
quency (330.57 per 100,000 population) is several times higher than
similar indicators in all other groups.
Conclusion: The main features of the prevalence of suicidal attempts in
women are: maximum rates among persons 20 - 29 years old with a
gradual decrease in subsequent age groups; the highest rates are among
non-working able-bodied women; the 1/3 part of suicidal attempts are
under the alcohol influence; the predominance of poisoning among the
methods of suicide. Women who have committed completed suicides and
suicidal attempts have a number of typical socio-demographic
characteristics.

*University of Fortaleza, Brazil
Background & objectives: A pathology internship program was devel-
oped between UNIFOR (Brazil) and a local private pathology group to
expose medical students to the daily routine of anatomic pathology as a
medical specialty. In this report, we describe the experiences of these
students.
Methods: The internship program was elaborated during the last
semester of 2019. The group participating in the project was
composed of 9 students between the 8th and 10th semesters of
medical school. It started in January 2020 and took place in a
private pathology laboratory in the city of Fortaleza, Brazil.
Results: The meetings were on Saturday afternoons and the stu-
dents could monitor and carry out the macroscopic analysis of
Virchows Arch
specimens, as well as check the histological slides. They could
also discuss the cases and findings with a pathologist present in
the laboratory at the moment. After March 2020, some activities
had to be carried out as online meetings because of the pandemic.
During online meetings the interns developed the ability to create
and organize projects on topics such as receiving specimens at a
laboratory, slides making, microscopic and macroscopic analysis,
preparation of histopathological reports and project management.
Conclusion: This internship presented opportunities of experienc-
ing pathology face-to-face or at a distance the most appropriate
modality in the current context without impairing the content.
Medical school pathology has traditionally been restricted to the
academic role pathology plays, as a bridge between basic and
clinical sciences. Our initiative tries to decrease gap between pa-
thology as an academic discipline and as a medical specialty. As
a follow-up, we will measure the incidence of medical students
that will apply to pathology as a residency.

*University of Fortaleza, Brazil
Background & objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic showed the need
to reinvent teaching methodologies. We seek to evaluate the applicability
of profile games in the teaching-learning process of Pathology in
pandemic.
Methods: A profile game using images of pathology was applied
through Powerpoint about COVID-19 and death signs, respective-
ly in students from the sixth and the seventh semesters of a
medical school. The participants should have prior knowledge of
the subject in order to play it. After applying the game, the
students answered a questionnaire applied using the Google
Forms platform.
Results: The game was applied to 180 students divided into 8 groups,
154 answered the questionnaire. When asked if the game helped them to
fix knowledge, 100% answered yes, which shows that this teaching tool
directly helped students learn the content. When asked what grade, from 0
to 10, students would give this teaching method, 66% answered that they
would give a score of 10, 19% would give a score of 9, 11% would give a
score of 8 and only 1 student would give a score of 0 to 5. All agreed that
the game met the learning objectives and that this teaching method must
be perpetuated.
Conclusion: In this work, it was noticed that an innovative and
differentiated proposal of working with Pathology was important
in the construction and consolidation of knowledge, since auton-
omy and interest in the subject were stimulated.

Background & objectives: The outbreak of the new Coronavirus
Disease (COVID-19) produced a global pandemic that affected
pathology teaching. This study aimed to assess the teaching of
this discipline during the pandemic context, highlighting the stu-
dent's perspective.
Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive, and semi-quantitative prospec-
tive study regarding medical students' perception on remote pathology
learning during 2020 was performed. Students from 3rd to 7th terms from
a Brazilian university (UNIFOR) were voluntarily assessed through a
semi-qualitative five-point Likert scale online questionnaire focused on
digital pathology employment during their undergraduate pathology
course.
Results: 152 answers were obtained through the online question-
naire. Regarding the use of digitized slides, most of the students
(69,7%) found “Excellent” or “Good” to learn from digital slides.
Overall, 69% considered “Excellent” or “Good” to learn patholo-
gy in the remote pandemic scenario. Added to that, a relevant
portion (44.7%) reported having, in the period of remote learning,
more study time. 67.7% of the students reported worsening or felt
indifferent about their performance in exams.
Conclusion: Most participants perceived the use of digital slides
positively. Part of the participants, on the other hand, reported
indifferent or worse exam performances. These can be attributed
to the psychological and social impacts generated by the pandem-
ic, as social distancing, and lack of adequate infrastructure to
remote learning. Through the students’ perspective we conclude
that remote and digital undergraduate pathology learning should
be encouraged, although the human factor should be closely rein-
forced by mentoring and supervision.

*University of Fortaleza, Brazil
Background & objectives: The methodology of Problem Based
Learning (PBL) is useful to develop clinical reasoning, contribut-
ing to an integrated learning of Pathology. This study aims to
describe the teaching of Pathology through the PBL method.
Methods: The present study consists of a report about the peda-
gogical strategies applied at Universidade de Fortaleza’s
(UNIFOR) medical course in the teaching of Pathology. The uni-
versity is located in the north-eastern region of Brazil. The insti-
tution considered the use of PBL as an active teaching method-
ology in theoretical and practice scenarios in five semesters.
Results: UNIFOR’s medical course includes Pathology in
morphofunctional laboratories. The education starts at the third
semester, with a six-hour week integrated curriculum approaching
General Pathology alongside Radiology and Anatomy until the
fourth semester. In the fifth, sixth and seventh semester we cover
Special Pathology and Radiology. The students also study autopsy
and learn how to fill death certificates in the seventh semester. In
the classes, the students discuss clinical problems co-relating their
findings and possible anatomic and clinical diagnosis. The meth-
odologies used are socrative, kahoot, paint, cross-words, theater,
memory games and profile games using microscopic slides and
histopathological reports.
Conclusion: Considering the curricular analysis exposed with the
experience of its application, we note the progressive evolution of
knowledge in pathology. The curriculum was built in a spiral
structure, evolving from introductory concepts to its applications
in specific issues of pathology being applied through several ac-
tive methodologies, ending with the filling out of the death cer-
tificate. Therefore, after five semesters of teaching pathology in
the PBL curriculum, it also allows students to develop knowledge
about the specialty.

Tumour-to-tumour metastasis. case series and literature review
R. De Carvalho*, N. Espejo-Herrera, E. Quirós, M. Pané, X. Matias-
Guiu, E. Condom
*Bellvitge Universitary Hospital, IDIBELL, Spain
Background & objectives: Less than 300 cases of tumour-to-
tumour metastasis (TTM) have been reported, mostly as isolated
cases. TTM may hinder the interpretation of radiological and his-
tological images. We present four patients in whom this rare
phenomenon was observed.
Methods: We reviewed the archives of the Pathology department. We
identified four patients diagnosed with TTM. We collected and reviewed
all the available clinical information, and pathological material.
Results: Patient 1: Female, 69 years-old. 2012: pT2N1 breast ductal
carcinoma (IBDC). Autopsy in 2015: systemic spread, including metas-
tases to a liver angioma, and uterine leiomyoma.
Patient 2: Female, 67 y.o. 1995: IBDC T4bN0M0. 2019: multiple metas-
tases, and a Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma (CCRCC) with intratumoral
IBDC.
Patient 3: Female, 60 y.o. 2015: CCRCC pT3a in left nephrectomy. 2020:
right adrenal nodule diagnosed as adrenal cortical adenoma (ACA) with
CCRCC metastasis.
Patient 4: Male, 72 y.o. 2014: pT3a renal cell carcinoma in right nephrec-
tomy. 2021: right ACA with metastasis of RCC morphologically com-
patible with FH-deficient type.
Conclusion: Renal and breast tumours were the most frequently involved
in this phenomenon, as tumour donors or recipients in our series. TTM,
however rare, is expected to be increasingly seen in years to come.
Atypical, dimorphic or evolving patterns in histological or image exam-
inations should raise the suspicion of TTM. Pathologists and radiologists
should be aware of this phenomenon in order to minimize diagnostic
errors or delays.

Inflammaging: the silicates seem to be the reason of this process in
spleen
E. Grigoreva*, V. Gordova, A. Khlupina, E. Reznik
*FGBOU VO "ChGU im. I.N. Ulyanov", Russia
Background & objectives: Early studies showed that silicon accel-
erates the thymus aging, its fatty transformation, a decrease in the
number of macrophages, and a redistribution of the CD68 protein
in macrophages. It is interesting to see how the spleen changes in
this regard.
Methods: The spleens of white outbred male rats were studied.
One group (n=10) received bottled water ad libitum, the other
(n=10) received the same water containing 10 mg/l silica for
during nine months. After 2 and 7 months (n=5 from each group)
the rats were sacrificed. The immunohistochemical characteristics
were detected. We made morphometric by the SigmaScan Pro
V5.0 software.
Results: The first signs of aging appear in the spleen in 2 months:
in rats treated with silicon, the number of large macrophages (Iba-
1) increases in the marginal zone, and decreases in the red pulp.
The average area of macrophages in the marginal zone in rats, in
silicon treated rats, increases by 1.2 times, the thickness of the
periarteriolar lymphoid sheath does not change. After 9 months,
these changes are more noticeable: in silicon treated rats, the
average size of macrophages (CD68+) in red pulp decreases 1.3
times, the thickness of the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath de-
creases 1.2 times.
Conclusion: It was revealed that in proportion to the silicon ex-
posure period, the absolute area of the lymphoid nodules and their
marginal zone decreases, but the relative area of the marginal
zone increases. The Changes we have seems clearly emphasize
that silicon accelerates the physiological aging of the spleen prob-
ably associated with the inflammatory process.

The diagnostic impact of temporal artery biopsy in giant cell arteritis
A. Hmidi*, F. Khanchel, I. Helal, D. Chiboub, E. Ben Brahim, A. Chadli-
Debbiche
*Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The temporal artery biopsy (TAB) is the
gold standard for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA).
However, its precision and limits remain controversial. Our
study’s aim was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of TAB in
patients with suspected GCA.
Methods: We included retrospectively all patients with TAB per-
formed for suspicion of GCA at Habib Thameur Hospital between
January 2016 and December 2020. We compared the histological
diagnosis of TAB with the clinical course and the definitive di-
agnosis made. Finally, we assessed the performance indices of the
TAB which are sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,
negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: Twenty-eight TABs were included (19 females and 9
males), with a mean age of 63.4 years. Positive results were
found in 5 (18%) and negative in 23 (82%) patients. Epithelioid
and gigantocellular granulomas were present in all TAB positive
cases. The diagnosis of GCA was retained in 12 patients (43%),
of which 5 patients (42%) had a positive TAB and 7 patients
(58%) had a negative TAB. TAB was negative in all patients
with no retained diagnosis of GCA. The specificity of TAB was
100% with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%. The sen-
sitivity was 41% with a negative predictive value (NPV) of
69.5%. The diagnostic efficiency was 75%.
Conclusion: TAB has an excellent specificity for the diagnosis of
GCA, but lacks sensitivity with a high number of false negatives.
False negatives represent 13 to 32% of cases, according to studies
(25% of the cases in our study). The focal and segmental nature
of GCA may explain the frequency of false negatives. Therefore,
a negative biopsy cannot exclude the diagnosis of GCA.

Appendicitis pathology throughout the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)
pandemic: a single centre study
G. Mitropoulou*, N. Tepelenis, A. Patereli, N. Christopoulos, I.
Georgopoulos, P. Kaparaliotis, K. Stefanaki
*Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital "Agia Sofia" Athens,
Greece
Background & objectives: COVID-19 pandemic brought important
changes in healthcare systems. In Greece during lockdown surgi-
cal procedures were limited to emergency conditions. The aim of
this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in
appendicitis’ treatment before and after the lockdown.
Methods: We reviewed the pathology reports of appendectomy
specimens from our department and divided them in different time
periods before the beginning of lockdown (January 1st 2019-
Martch 22nd 2020) and after the lockdown (March 23rd 2020-
December 31st 2020)
Results: A total of 324 appendectomy specimens were studied.
After March 23rd we observed a 49,4% decrease in the number
of cases (mean number of cases during pre-Covid19 period 16,6/
month to mean number of cases after lockdown 8,2/month). We
also saw that the rate of negative appendectomies decreased sig-
nificantly during Covid-19 period from 9,2% to 2,7%, while the
rate of complicated appendicitis (gangrenous and perforated) was
Virchows Arch
notably increased from 30,8% to 44,6%. Six ( 8,1%) patients
were diagnosed with Covid-19 and acute appendicitis.
Conclusion: Our study shows that the cases of acute appendicitis
have decreased during the pandemic period, however the patients
presented with more severe disease. Acute appendicitis is the
most common emergency condition in children and delayed man-
agement correlates with increased complications. The limitations
imposed during the lockdown, the fear of parents of an inhospital
Covid-19 contagion and the increased occupation of emergency
departments by Covid-19 patients has significantly affected the
patient’s behaviour regarding the utilization of emergency units.

Concordance rates between frozen section diagnosis and final
authorised diagnosis in University Hospital Galway from 2019 to
2020; an institutional audit
E. O'Connor*, D. O'Connor, E. O'Connor, M. Casey
*University Hospital Galway, Ireland
Background & objectives: A frozen section is a pathological labo-
ratory technique which allows rapid diagnosis of specimens and
evaluation of disease margins. The objective of this audit was to
assess the concordance rates between frozen section diagnosis and
final authorised diagnosis in UHG.
Methods: A retrospective analysis of all frozen sections completed
in UHG from 2019-2020 was undertaken using the internal APEX
laboratory system, looking specifically at the concordance rates of
frozen section diagnosis and final authorised diagnosis. The time
to frozen section diagnosis was also measured, assessing if it was
achieved within 20 minutes.
Results: A total of 45 frozen sections were performed in 2019,
with a concordance rate of 100%. In comparison, 44 frozen sec-
tions were performed in 2020, with a slightly lower concordance
rate of 97.7%. One case in 2020 which was suspicious for ma-
lignant involvement of the margin on frozen section showed no
evidence of malignancy on the final authorised diagnosis.
In 2019, 82% of frozen section diagnoses were made within 20 minutes,
compared to 75% in 2020.
Conclusion: These results show there were high concordance rates
between frozen section diagnosis and final authorised diagnosis in
UHG, however there is scope for improvement from a time-
management perspective. Frozen sections are highly time-
sensitive and effort should be made to answer the clinical ques-
tion within 20 minutes of receiving the specimen.
In conclusion, this audit demonstrates that our institution's concordance
rates align with international standards, however, there remains scope for
improvement with regards to time taken for diagnosis to be completed.

Shtemplevskaya, S. Timofeev*
*FSBSI Research Institute of Human Morphology, Moscow, Russia
Background & objectives: The human undergoes the abundant ex-
posure to an artificial lighting in the dark which leads to a shift
in the circadian rhythms of the organism, or desynchronosis.
Desynchronosis is a prolonged stress condition, which affects
the blood results.
Methods: The study was conducted on 80 six-month-old male rats, di-
vided into 2 groups, over 3 weeks. The first group was kept under the
fixed regime “light-darkness” (10 hours / 14 hours) and the second group
– under constant lighting. Subsequently, the haematological analysis was
performed.
Results: As the result of the study it is established that staying
under constant lighting within 3 weeks is accompanied by a de-
crease in the number of erythrocytes (RBC) and in haemoglobin
level in the blood (HGB) with unchanged haematocrit (HCT).
There is also a decrease in mean corpuscular haemoglobin
(MCH) and an increase in red cell distribution width (RDWc)
with unchanged mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean cor-
puscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC).
Conclusion: Exposure to constant lighting leads to a decrease in
the number of erythrocytes and in haemoglobin level; against this
background, an increase in RDWc indicates an increase in the
number of reticulocytes in the blood.

Sabo
*University of Novi Sad, Serbia
Background & objectives: Data on prenatal kidney development in
Down syndrome (DS) are scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study
was to evaluate differences in nephrogenesis in foetuses with and
without prenatally diagnosed DS.
Methods: Tissue of foetal kidneys with (DS group, n=17) and
without (non-DS, n=17) prenatally diagnosed DS were analysed,
using free image software Image J. We compared the thickness of
the nephrogenic (NZ) and maturation (MZ) zone of the cortex,
diameter and area of the glomerulus and glomerular tuft and pres-
ence of different nephron developmental forms.
Results: NZ was slightly thicker in DS samples. MZ in younger
DS foetuses was significantly thicker than non-DS, but ate the 8th
and 9th gestational month, MZ thickness of DS samples became
significantly thinner, compared to non-DS. Glomerular diameter
and area, and tuft area of DS group was smaller compared to
non-DS, in juxtaglomerular zone of the renal cortex, while it
was opposite in intermediate and superficial cortical zone. DS
group had significantly higher percentage of more mature devel-
opmental forms of nephron, in all gestational ages.
Conclusion: Thinner MZ and higher percentage of more mature
developmental forms of nephrons in all gestational ages, speak
in favour of impaired nephrogenesis in DS group, as well as a
possibility for lower nephron number in DS babies born with DS.

*Department of Pathology, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Hepatocellular adenoma is a rare benign
neoplasm, representing <5% of all paediatric hepatic tumours.
Liver adenomatosis is even more uncommon, described as multi-
ple adenomas (usually>10) in a normal liver parenchyma. We
report a case of hepatic adenomatosis in a child.
Methods: A 15-year-old girl presented with the history of chronic ab-
dominal pain for 3 months. The patient did not have any history of
hormonal use or significant medical history. Computed tomography
Virchows Arch
imaging revealed a multiple spontaneously hypodense liver masses of
wish the greatest measure approximately 7 cm located at segment V.
The patient underwent surgical resection of the largest mass.
Results: On gross examination, the specimen demonstrates a well-
circumscribed, firm 7cm lesion. The cut surface of the lesion
showed a tan-yellow colour with intratumoral haemorrhage. The
nonlesional liver is noncirrhotic. Microscopically, the lesion was
composed of multiple nodules separated by fibrosis septa within
portal areas. The nodules consisted of benign-appearing hepato-
cytes arranged in one to two cell thick plates with marked
steatosis and interspersed small blood vessels. The surrounding
liver showed multiple well circumscribed millimetric lesions with
the same histological appearance mentioned above.
Immunohistochemical stains revealed that the tumour was nega-
tive forβ-catenin. Intralesional steatosis and the multiple character
of the lesions oriented towards to the subtypehepatocyte nuclear
factor 1 (HNF-1A) inactivated liver adenomatosis.
Conclusion: Liver adenomatosis is an uncommon neoplasm, espe-
cially in the childhood age group. To our knowledge there is less
than twenty cases in the literature. This is a rare case of liver
adenomatosis HNF-1α inactivated in children. This subtype is
defined by bi-allelic inactivating mutations of HNF1A. The diag-
nosis of this subtype can be confirmed by decreased or absent
LFABP immunostaining in the lesional cells or by molecular test.

County Clinical Emergency Hospital Oradea, Romania
Background & objectives: To determine the clinical and histopatholog-
ical features of the placentas from women diagnosed with coronavirus
disease-19 (COVID-19) during the third trimester of pregnancy.
Methods: We analysed 53 cases of COVID-19 positive patients
admitted and delivered in the Obstetric Department of County
Emergency University Hospital of Oradea, Romania, between
July and December 2020. We compared the clinical and histo-
pathological findings in this group with those from 55 placentas
from Covid-19 negative cases delivered in the same period.
The mother's age in COVID-19 positive group ranged between 17 and
43 years (mean= 29.3). The majority were at term deliveries (94.3%)
and had an asymptomatic Covid-19 infection (90.56%) and C-section
was performed in 79.24% of the cases. We found no evidence of
adverse foetal outcome due to the mother's positive COVID-19 status.
Placenta’s examination revealed increased features of maternal (vil-
lous infarction, decidual vasculopathy, accelerated villous matura-
tion, distal vilous hypoplasia, retroplacental haematoma)(69.8% vs
49.1%)(OR=2.39; p=0.03) and foetal vascular malperfusion (umbili-
cal cord abnormalities, avascular villi, villous stromal –vascular
karyorrhexis)(50.9% vs 29.1%)(OR=2.53, p=0.03), with statistically
significant differences.
Conclusion: Even though in COVID positive group was observed
a slightly increased incidence regarding inflammatory/infectious
processes (histologic acute chorioamnionitis, VUE, chronic vilitis,
chronic histiocytic intervilositis)(45.3% vs 29.1%) we did not find
statistically significant difference between the groups (p=0.11).
The COVID-19 positive placentas showed a significantly higher
prevalence of maternal and foetal vascular malperfusion, which
possibly reflect an underlying hypercoagulable state, uterine
underperfusion and subsequent hypoxic-ischemic injury induced
by COVID-19 infection.

*Department of Pathology, Haukeland University Hospital / Department
of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Norway
Background & objectives: Predicting complications of extremely
premature birth (EP) is difficult and poses a major therapeutic
challenge. We aimed to explore the placental characteristics of
children born EP (< 28 weeks) and examine whether histopatho-
logical findings could predict neonatal outcomes.
Methods: Prospective observational study of EP singletons. The
placentas were classified according to the Amsterdam Placental
Workshop Group Consensus Statement. Logistic regression analy-
ses were used to evaluate the associations between placental find-
ings and adverse neonatal outcomes, defined as perinatal death,
early onset sepsis (EONS), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), major brain pathology by
MRI, and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).
Results: Of 123 cases included, 58 placentas had histologic
chorioamnionitis (HCA), 47 had maternal vascular malperfusion
(MVM), and 13 cases had both HCA and MVM. Five cases had no
pathology. HCA was associated with perinatal death (OR 10.21, 95%
CI [10.01-103.8], p=0.030) and NEC (OR 10.81, 95% CI [1.4-82.3],
p=0.011). Subanalysis of cases with HCA showed increased odds of
BPD in cases with a foetal inflammatory response (OR 3.57, 95% CI
[1.15-11.08], p=0.028).
Conclusion: Placental histology may be useful to assess the risk of ad-
verse neonatal outcomes following extremely preterm birth.

*Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: Studies on vertical transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 from infected mothers were published without clear
results. Nevertheless, placental infection has been confirmed with
detection of SARS-CoV-2 in trophoblast by immunohistochemis-
try (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH), as well as the neonatal
transmission.
Methods: We make a review of medical record, complementary
tests and autopsies (fetoplacental unit) from stillbirths detected in
4 patients at their 37, 31, 27 and 20 gestation weeks. Mothers
were between 24 and 38 years old who presented active symp-
tomatic COVID-19 infection with good oxygen saturation. Two of
them presented comorbidities (multiple sclerosis and obesity, dia-
betes and hyperthyroidism).
Results: The autopsy findings revealed adequate weight according to
gestational age and the absence of structural abnormalities, except
for one case of unilateral renal agenesis. All of them presented acute
Virchows Arch
hypoxia-ischemia signs. The placental study showed diffuse tropho-
blastic necrosis, affecting 80 to 90% of the placenta, identifying
intense and granular cytoplasmic trophoblast positivity for SARS-
CoV-2 by IHC and ISH. The real time-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) in placental tissue was positive in all cases. In one case,
the lung RT-PCR was positive. However, the presence of the virus
could not be confirmed by IHC or ISH in foetal tissue. The rest of
RT-PCRs where negative.
Conclusion: In all cases, acute placental insufficiency secondary to
diffuse trophoblastic damage produced by the SARS-CoV-2 infec-
tion was the cause of death. Despite one foetus showed positivity
by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, IHC and ISH were negative. So, we
cannot affirm that it is a congenital infection. More foetal autop-
sies studies of mothers with active COVID-19 infection are need-
ed to elucidate possible congenital infection by SARS-COV-2.

Bone marrow disease assessment in neuroblastoma: is it significant
in patient management?

*University of Health Sciences Turkey, Tepecik Research and Training
Hospital, Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Neuroblastoma is the most common ex-
tracranial tumour in children. Evaluation of bone marrow disease
is very important in disease management in neuroblastomas. The
purpose of this study is to investigate the predictive significance
of histopathological examination BM in neuroblastomas.
Methods: The study included 61 cases with archival bone marrow
biopsy tissues. The cases were evaluated examining the percent-
age of the metastatic tissue and its differentiation. Primary tumour
slides were also reviewed to perform Shimada classification based
on differentiation status and mitosis karyorrhexis index. Patients'
age, gender, NMYC amplification, clinical risk group and disease
outcome were also noted.
Results: Of 61 cases, 17 had bone marrow involvement. Of those,
eight cases (47.1%) were refractory NB showing disease relapse.
Based on bone marrow examination, five cases (29.4%) were
categorized as complete response, seven (41.2%) progressive dis-
ease, three (17.6%) minimal disease and two (11.8%) stabile dis-
ease. Progressive disease category was significantly related with
refractory disease and NMYC amplification along with high-risk
category (p =0.002 and p= 0.003 respectively). The undifferenti-
ated histology and presence of more than 20% of tumour tissue in
the bone marrow biopsy at diagnosis were significantly associated
with progressive disease category (p=0.01 and p<0.001,
respectively).
Conclusion: Bone marrow is the most common site of metastasis
in neuroblastomas. The status of metastatic disease in the bone
marrow (BM) is a predictor of poor outcome. We conclude that
evaluating the percentage of metastatic tumour tissue and tumour
differentiation in bone marrow biopsies is of clinical importance
in the management of neuroblastoma patients.

*Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: For pathologists, placenta is the "black
box" of pregnancy, because its examination provides significant
information about maternofoetal health. Since the onset of SARS-
CoV-2 pandemic, the impact of viral infection on foetal develop-
ment and vertical transmission capacity has been debated.
Methods: Although several viral infections may be associated with
specific placental lesions, no histopathological pathognomonic
changes for SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported to date.
This study includes 25 placentas from mothers aged 16-43 years,
confirmed by RT-PCR with SARS-CoV-2 infection. All speci-
mens have been thoroughly examined using the Amsterdam con-
sensus recommendations.
Results: Over 75% of all placentas were below the 90th percentile
in terms of placental weight relative to gestational age. The most
common lesions of maternal vascular malperfusion were
intervilosal thrombosis and decidual arteriopathy. Distal villous
hypoplasia was identified in only 12.5%. Among foetal vascular
malperfusion lesions, the following were observed: increased in-
dex (6.06) of umbilical cord twisting (75%), thrombosis of vessels
with muscle walls (12.5%), avascular villi (18.5%), delayed vil-
lous maturation (31.25%) and ectasia of chorionic vessels (25%).
The only inflammatory changes identified were secondary to as-
cending intrauterine infection (acute subchorionitis).
Conclusion: No placental changes pathognomonic for SARS-CoV-
2 infection were identified. Most specimens showed varying de-
grees of maternal vascular malperfusion, which could suggest an
etiopathogenic link with altered anticoagulant and microangiopath-
ic status induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. No placental inflam-
matory changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were iden-
tified. Two placentas showed maternal inflammatory response sec-
ondary to ascending intrauterine infection.

Methods: The study group consisted of 40 NBL patients. Data
included gender, age at diagnosis, tumour location, International
Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) stage, risk group according
to the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) risk stratification sys-
tem, histologic subtypes, bone marrow involvement, genetic alter-
ations, clinical follow-up, and final outcome.
The primary antibody used in was: anti PD-L1 (EPR1161(2); 1:200 di-
lution; ab174838, Abcam).
Results: Of the 40 cases of NBL included in the study 32 (80%)
cases expressed PD-L1 while 8 (20%) were found to be PD-L1
negative. Immunostaining for PD-L1 in ganglioneuroma or
ganglioneuroblastoma was generally lower than it was for NBL
cases. In addition, worse tumour differentiation was marginally
associated with PD-L1 expression (p<0.05). The relapse rate was
significantly higher in PD-L1 positive patients compared to the
other patients (p<0.001). The percentage of PD-L1 positive cells
in patients with MYCN amplification was 100%. The stage IV
was slightly higher in PD-L1 patients compared with stage I, II,
III patients, albeit without statistical significance (p=0.053).

Conclusion: In the quest for new treatments, immunotherapy is poten-
tially useful for chemotherapy-resistant disease. The inhibition of the
programmed death ligand 1/programmed death 1 (PD-L1/PD-1) pathway
has introduced a new era in cancer treatment.

- Kunovska, R. Jovanovic, V. Stojkovski, M. Todorovska-Bogdanovska
*Institute of Pathology, Medical Faculty, University Ss. Cyril and
Methodius, Skopje, North Macedonia
Background & objectives: Foetal reference values are available for sev-
eral European countries, but no reference values exist for the North
Macedonian population.
We aimed to establish accurate body weight and crown-heel length stan-
dards, indigenous to our country.
Methods: We reviewed 4,073 consecutive foetal/perinatal autopsies per-
formed between 2012 and 2019. Excluded were cases with: multiple
pregnancies, unknown gestational age, congenital abnormalities, intra-
uterine growth restriction, hydrops, severe septicaemia/virosis, fixed/
frozen specimens, newborns aged >24 hours, severe haemorrhage, and
alloimmunization. BW was measured in grams and CHL in centimetres at
the day of admission. Percentile curves were calculated with the Altman
method.
Results: 1,129 cases met the inclusion criteria (age range: 11-42 gw,
64.07% males, 35.93% females, 1.15% undetermined sex), of which
456 (40.39%) were miscarriages, 326 (28.86%) stillborn foetuses, 243
(21.52%) neonates and 15 (1.33%) foetuses were medically terminated
pregnancies. BW in grams (BWg) had the following relationship with
gw: BWg = 302.923 + gw * -68.766 + gw2 *3.481 (R2 = 0.930, p <
0.0001). The relationship between CHL in cm (CHLcm) and gw was
calculated as following: CHLcm = -23.89 + gw * 2.926 + gw2 * -
0.0268 (R2 = 0.926, p < 0.0001). Corresponding standard deviations
were modelled to derive lower and upper reference limits.
Conclusion: The current autopsy study provides bodyweight and
crown-heel reference standards with standard deviations, at each
gestational age, which are representative of our mixed population.
The easy-to-use percentile charts could serve as a valuable tool
for the practicing pathologist when performing perinatal autopsies.
We believe that strict adherence to the eligibility criteria, the
consistency of the autopsy procedure, and the well-designed sta-
tistical approach, support the reliability of our results.

A. Kattamis, K. Stefanaki
*DepartmentofPathology,Children'sHospital"AgiaSofia"Athens,Greece
Background & objectives: The family of Juvenile Xanthoganuloma
(JXG) is a non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis occurring predomi-
nantly in neonates and children. We present the clinical and his-
tological characteristics of JXG in children and the correlation of
morphology/immunophenotype with the clinical behaviour.
Methods: A retrospective review was performed of 65 biopsy
specimens from our laboratory between 2006-2020.
Results: Age ranged from 6 days to 15 years, with female pre-
dominance [35 females: 30 males], 50 patients were under 3
years. Solitary cutaneous lesions accounted for 56/65 (86,1%), 3
(4,6%) cases presented as soft tissue mass, 3 (4,6%) cases had
visceral involvement and 3 neonatal cases (4,6%) had systemic
JXG. Classical JXG was the most frequent 55/65 (84,6%), with
variable Touton giant cells and foamy histiocytes. Spindle cell
morphology was observed in 11 cases. The immunophenotype
CD68/PGM-1(+), CD163 (+), Fascin(+), Factor XIIIa(+),
CD1a(-), Langerin (-) was observed in all cases. The expression
of Ki-67 was variable regardless of presentation and morphology.
One case with systemic disease expressed ALK-1/p-80
Conclusion: JXG presents in children as a cutaneous lesion, less
often as a solitary extracutaneous lesion and rarely as a systemic
disease, with a favourable prognosis in localized disease. The
immunophenotype is characteristic regardless of the clinical and
morphologic features and contributes in the diagnosis of the sys-
temic type of JXG which requires treatment.

Khodzhaeva
*National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynaecology and
Perinatology, Moscow, Russia
Background & objectives: Endothelial NOS (eNOS) and CD34 as
known markers of placental villi’s endothelial cells are essential
for angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. The aim of the study to
evaluate eNOS, CD34 expression in placenta of monochorionic
diamniotic twins with selective foetal growth restriction (sFGR).
Methods: Histological(H&E) and immunohistochemical studies to
primary antibodies to eNOS, CD34(Spring Bioscience) on the
paraffin-embedded slices of placental samples taken after caesar-
ean section at 28-36 wks from 22 patients of 24-36 yrs with
monochorionic diamniotic twins has been performed. The group
with sFGR consisted of placenta samples from 15 puerperas and
for control - placenta samples from7 ones. Cases with feto-fetal
syndrome excluded.
Results: Histological and immunohistochemical study showed ex-
pression CD34 in blood vessels’ endothelium of placental villi.
We revealed 10x increase number of smaller diameter vessels
within one villi in sFGR group(more than 10 vessels in one villi,
normally 3-7 vessels), predominant branching of blood
vessels(p<0,05). In cases of sFGR eNOS expression was signifi-
cantly increased in some placental areas with compensatory
changes, whereas in other areas it decreased up to lost
staining(p<0,05). Moreover eNOS expression was detected in the
syncytiotrophoblast as membrane cytoplasmic and granular stain-
ing. This confirms the high level of angiogenic factors in the
trophoblast. In controls eNOS, CD34 expression was moderate
in the villous tree and placentas were within gestational age.
Conclusion: CD34, eNOS expression indicates depletion of the compen-
satory mechanisms of the placenta with sFGR in cases of monochorionic
diamniotic twins.
Funding: This study is supported by State Assignment №21-А21.

Ramos, J.R. Vizcaíno
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário do Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Twin pregnancy with a complete
hydatidiform mole and a coexistent viable foetus is a rare entity, with
associated risks both during and after pregnancy. A case with a surviving
neonate is presented.
Virchows Arch
Methods: A 31-year-old woman presented at 33 weeks of gestation with
a foetal growth restriction alongside a placenta with 50% normal-looking
and 50% vacuolated aspect on ultrasound examination. Chorionic villi
sampling at the first trimester revealed a 46XY karyotype. At 35 weeks, a
spontaneous preterm infant was delivered, with 2,110g and 9/10/10
Apgar score. The placenta was sent to pathologic examination.
Results: On gross examination of the placenta, half was normal
with a 36cm in length umbilical cord eccentrically inserted, and
the other half was partially fragmented and composed of vesicles
of various sizes (max.1,5cm). Both parts were adjacent to each
other with an abrupt transition between them. The total placenta
weighed 437g.
Microscopic examination revealed two totally separate populations of
near normal villi with accelerated maturation, and molar villi with decidua
interposed among the two. The molar placenta showed enlarged, round
villi with central cisterns and absence of blood vessels, together with
circumferential trophoblastic proliferation. Immunohistochemistry with
p57 antibody presented <10% nuclear staining of villous cytotrophoblasts
and stroma cells.
Conclusion: The presented features were compatible with a viable foetus
with a normal placenta coexisting alongside a twin molar placenta. It is
important to recognize the increased risk of developing severe complica-
tions in this kind of gestation such as preterm delivery, foetal loss, pre-
eclampsia, haemorrhage, hyperthyroidism, development of persistent
gestational trophoblastic disease or other pregnancy complications.
Therefore, close surveillance during molar pregnancy and consequent
follow-up is essential.

Fulcheri, V.G. Vellone
*Department of Integrated Surgical and Diagnostic Sciences (DISC),
University of Genoa, Italy
Background & objectives: Miscarriage and stillbirth are common
events. Foetal autopsy has a main role in providing answers for
the parents. We analysed our experience, providing clinical and
emotional care through post-mortem examination and following
interview offering them information for a subsequent follow-up.
Methods: This retrospective study includes all foetal post-autopsy
interviews carried out at Ospedale Policlinico San Martino from
1/1/2013 to 1/3/2021. Bereaved parents asked to meet the special-
ized pathologist who performed post-mortem examination. All the
autopsies have been reported with a standardized check-list based
protocol including microscopic and macroscopic analysis and pla-
cental examination. A standardized check-list based report follow-
ed every pathologist-parent meeting.
Results: This retrospective study includes all foetal post-autopsy inter-
views carried out at Ospedale Policlinico San Martino from 1/1/2013 to
1/3/2021. Bereaved parents asked to meet the specialized pathologist who
performed post-mortem examination. All the autopsies have been report-
ed with a standardized check-list based protocol including microscopic
and macroscopic analysis and placental examination. A standardized
check-list based report followed every pathologist-parent meeting.
Conclusion: Foetal autopsy and placenta examination appear criti-
cal, providing information for prevention and clinical manage-
ment. Gynaecologists and Geneticists have an active role in fol-
low-up. The pathologist, meeting with the parents, provides a
clear explanation of the causes, helping them in coping with grief
and preventing medicolegal issues. Overall, the pathologist-parents
interview has been positively perceived, with sporadic difficulties
due to socio-cultural differences, psychiatric disorders and under-
lying animosity.

Structural profile of vascular remodelling of the stem and terminal
villi during pregnancy with congenital heart defects
O. Reshetnikova*, L. Rudiuk
*Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, Russia
Background & objectives: The advances in heart surgery resulted
in increased number of women with congenital heart defects
(CHD) survived to childbearing age. The risk of developing ma-
ternal and foetal complications in such cases depends on structur-
al and functional responses of the system ‘mother-placenta-
foetus’.
Methods: Twenty term placentae in cases of CHD and 15 controls from
physiological pregnancy were studied morphologically. Histopathologic
findings and morphometry data were correlated with immunohistochem-
ical (IHC) studies results. The immunohistochemical staining protocol
with monoclonal mouse antibodies to SMA (Dako, 1:500) for placental
tissue samples had been developed. Differences between groups' data
were elucidated by non-parametric Mann-Whitney. Reliability
established at p<0.05.
Results: Microscopic examination and morphometry revealed an
increased volume fraction (VF) of the stem villi' arterial
vessels(ASV) lumen – 59.0 (9.5)* and a decrease in the VF of
the terminal villi capillaries(CTV) lumen - 24.0 (8) * in compar-
ison with the control group (respectively: 48.0 (14.75) and 28.0
(12), p<0.05). The study of SMA expression in the myofibroblasts
of the walls of the vessels of the ASV and CTV showed that, in
the contrast to the control group, a diffuse increase in expression
was registered in CHD cases(p<0.05).
Conclusion: Structural changes of the ACV and CTV walls indi-
cate the development of placental malperfusion as a response to
circulatory hypoxia due to hemodynamic disorders in women with
CHD. The impaired vessels remodelling with inadequate placenta
function results in various pregnancy complications. Vascular
malperfusion leads to a decreased oxygen exchange between the
mother and the foetus. Placental dysfunction results in foetal
growth retardation. Clinical assessment of pregnancy in CHD
cases must be performed with consideration of the oxygen stress
risks due to placental malperfusion.

Assessment of the vascular endothelial growth factor expression and
proliferation index in the placental villi syncytiotrophoblast under
circulatory hypoxia conditions
O. Reshetnikova*, L. Rudiuk
*Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, Russia
Background & objectives: Circulatory hypoxia during pregnancy
may cause placental dysfunction with adverse health consequences
for a mother and her child. Violations of blood flow adaptation in
pregnant women with congenital heart defects(CHD) could result
in placental malperfusion, with negative effect on placental
syncytiotrophoblast(PST) functions.
Methods: The associations of VEGF(RTU,Spring) and Ki-67(RTU,
BOND) expressions in PST with structural remodelling of the
placental villi epithelium in CHD non-operated (group I - 20
cases), in cases of CHD surgical correction(group II - 19) and
15 cases of physiological pregnancy(control group-CG) were stud-
ied. The differences between groups were identified by Mann-
Whitney U-test. The validity of the data were established at
p<0.05.
Results: Microscopic examination revealed multiple foci of the placental
terminal villi' epithelium damage in non-operated CHD, which were less
noticeable in the condition of surgical correction of the defect. Adaptive

proliferation of the terminal villi' epithelium with syncytial nodes' forma-
tion, the increased number and length of syncytio-capillary membranes
were noted in cases of CHD surgical correction. The compensatory pro-
cesses detected both in the central and peripheral parts of the placental
disc. The IHC study of group I placentae revealed the increased VGEF
expression in PST, accompanied with an increased proliferation index.
The IGH peculiarities of group II were characterized by a shift in the
expression of VGEF and Ki-67 close to the CG parameters.
Conclusion: Structural remodelling and IHC features of PST are
discussed in the aspect of placental adaptation to the conditions of hyp-
oxic stress caused by CHD and in cases of the defect's surgical corrections
before pregnancy. Knowledge of the possible mechanisms of the placen-
tal response to the lack of oxygen in the fetoplacental complex can con-
tribute to the development of obstetric adequate management schemes for
the women with congenital heart defects.

*CHU Mongi Slim La Marsa, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The causes of foetal loss are diverse. The aim
of our work was to evaluate the role of systematic placental examination
in determining the causes of foetal loss and to specify the type and fre-
quency of placental and foetal malformations.
Methods: A retrospective study concerning fetoplacental examinations
including abortions (more than 12 weeks), stillbirths and children died
perinatally. The cases were referred in the department of pathology of a
Hospital in North of Tunisia (North Africa) from 1994 and 2018. The
classification of placental anomalies was based on the recommendations
of the Amsterdam Protocol of 2014.
Results: We included 507 fetoplacental examinations. The mean mater-
nal age was 31.1 years. Maternal conditions were dominated by pre-
eclampsia and gestational diabetes. 279 placentas were pathological and
228 were normal. Of the 279 pathological placentas, 199 were not asso-
ciated with foetal abnormalities(39%) and in 80 cases(16%) foetal
malformations were found. For the 228 normal placentas, the correspond-
ing foetuses showed abnormalities in 123 cases(24%). In 105 cases there
were no placental lesions or associated foetal malformations(21%). The
main placental abnormalities were maternal vasculostromal le-
sions(27.4%) followed by foetal vasculostromal lesions(16.9%).
Concerning foetuses, the sex ratio was 1.5 and the medium term was
19.4. The most frequent malformations were facial abnormalities(20.7%)
followed by chromosomal aberrations(10.3%).
Conclusion: Systematic placental examination has an important
role in determining the causes of foetal loss and was determinant
in 39% of cases. Therefore, an efficient foetopathological exami-
nation should be as complete as possible, and consistent with
current recommendations.

*Pathology Department, Parc Taulí Hospital Universitari, Sabadell,
Spain; Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain; Institut
d'Investigació i Innovació Parc Taulí (I3PT), Sabadell, Spain
Background & objectives: It has been raised whether there is ver-
tical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to foetuses, and which is the
mechanism in cases of foetal death. The study of foetal autopsies
of COVID-19 affected mothers with the study of placentas may
provide answers.
Methods: We analysed a series of 46 pregnancies from two hospitals in
which SARS-CoV-2 infection was evidenced during gestation, from
which placenta and/or foetal autopsy were available for
anatomopathological study. SARS-CoV-2 infection was investigated in
placental tissues through immunohistochemistry (IHC) and positive cases
were further confirmed by in situ hybridization (ISH) and PCR.
Results: Ten women were affected by COVID-19 at the time of
delivery, with gestational loss occurring in three of them, two in
the third trimester. In these two cases, the placentas showed mas-
sive involvement by "diffuse trophoblastic damage" (necrosis of
the trophoblastic lining with stromal preservation and collapse of
the intervillous space with fibrin and mixed inflammation) with
positivity for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in the placental tissue and by
immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in the trophoblas-
tic lining.
Two other placentas had identical but focal lesions with IHC and
ISH positivity. One of these women had active disease 19 days
before delivery, and the other during the second trimester.
Conclusion: From the series studied, third-trimester foetal demises
were associated with extensive placental findings characteristic of
SARS-CoV-2 infection with the demonstration by various tech-
niques (PCR, IHC, and HIS) of viral involvement of the placenta.
Identical lesions but of lesser extent can be found in placentas of
live, healthy new-borns. We consider that the deaths occur due to
placental dysfunction because of the extensive lesional involve-
ment, rather than secondary to vertical transmission.

Paediatric ovarian tumours: an 11-year experience at a single insti-
tution from Tunisia

*Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Ovarian tumours in childhood and ado-
lescence are rare, distinguished from those of adulthood by their
histological subtype and favourable prognosis. Our aim is to in-
vestigate clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes of ovarian
tumours occurring in paediatric population originating from south
Tunisia.
Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted in paediatric
patients under 21 years old, managed surgically by ovarian
masses and diagnosed at the department of pathology of Habib
Bourguiba university hospital of Sfax in south Tunisia, between
2010 and 2021. The analysed data were symptoms, treatment,
outcomes and pathology.
Results: We identified 140 patients with ovarian masses of which 94.2%
were benign and 5.7% were malignant. The mean age at diagnosis was
17.6 years [3-21years]. Abdominal mass/pain was the most common
presenting symptom (80%). Five percent of cases were incidentally dis-
covered during appendectomy. All patients had fertility-preserving sur-
gery, either cystectomy (7,1%) or unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
(92,8%). Tumours were bilateral in 3% of cases. Among benign tumours,
the majority were serous cystadenoma (38,5%). Mature teratoma
accounted for 26,4% of cases. There was one case of juvenil-granulosa
tumour and 2 fibro-thecomas. Malignant tumours comprised 5 immature
teratomas and 3 dysgerminomas. At follow up, there was no reports of
recurrence or contralateral ovarian tumour.
Conclusion: Paediatric ovary tumours are very rare with a reported inci-
dence rate of 2.2/100,000 girls. They have an excellent prognosis even in
advanced stages when managed with fertility preserving procedures.
They may arise as the first manifestation of a cancer predisposition syn-
drome. Correct diagnosis of the syndrome may offer the possibility of
surveillance for other members of the patient’s family. Close follow-up is
necessary, given the risk of recurrence.

Syphilis: an old enemy masquerading as a new “friend”
K. Adoke*, M. Sanusi Haruna
*Department of pathology, Federal Medical Center Birnin Kebbi, Nigeria
Background & objectives: Syphilis is a STI and a spirochetal disease
that has plagued mankind for centuries with recent data showing increas-
ing rates of infection worldwide due to HIV. It has four stages with
diagnosis made mostly by serological assays.
Methods: Seven cases of syphilis diagnosed over a two-year period
(2018-2019) were retrieved from our departmental archives. Patient data
were extracted from their case files and paraffin blocks were cut and
stained with routine H&E. Wartin-starry stain was done on all cases.
Data was analysed using spss version 24.
Results: The age range of presentation of Syphilis was 25-65 years, with a
mean age of 55±13.5 and a male female ratio of 2.5:1. All patients presented
with past history of urethral or vaginal discharge. Two patients presented with
foot and vaginal ulcers which were biopsied. The remaining five patients
presented with a tumour in various part of the body with the scrotum and
legs been the commonest site. Biopsy of these sites showed perivascular
aggregates of plasma cells with intense fibrosis. Warthin -starry stain was
positive in all seven cases. In all cases the physician was not thinking of
syphilis.
Conclusion: Syphilis can present as a tumour or ulcer in our setting. To
the unsuspecting physician, it is a case of a tumour that is excised and
patient is cured but, to the pathologist it is a case of an enemy masquerad-
ing as a tumour that needs to be adequately manage to prevent morbidity
and mortality. We advocate high index of suspicion of syphilis for any
sexually active patient with pass history of genital discharge presenting
with a tumour or ulcer.

Clinicopathological study of de novo metastatic prostate cancer in
Yaoundé (Cameroon)
X. Farré*, J.J. Awoumou Belinga
*Public Health Agency of Catalonia, Lleida, Catalonia, Spain
Background & objectives: The presence of metastasis at diagnosis in a
patient, de novo metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa), is a sign of poor
prognosis and characterized by low survival rates. The objective was its
study in the capital of Cameroon, Yaoundé.
Methods: We reviewed the histopathology reports from the 722 patients
diagnosed of prostate cancer at the Centre Pasteur du Cameroon in
Yaoundé from 01/06/2020 to 31/08/2020. We included in our descriptive
study all patients who presented with at least one confirmed metastasis on
imaging followed by prostate biopsy at diagnosis. We housed demo-
graphic, clinical and pathological data in an Excel spreadsheet.
Results: Thirteen patients presented with at least one metastasis at diag-
nosis (1.8%). The average age at diagnosis was 67. Patients lived only in
Yaoundé area. The mostly reported initial symptoms were lower limb
paraplegia and bone pain (69%). The average total PSA was 182.6 ng/ml.
The mostly assigned Grade Group was 5 (54%). Some pathological find-
ings detected were: cribrifom pattern (54%), perineural invasion (38%),
chronic inflammatory infiltrates (38%), and high grade PIN (15%).
Lymph node involvement was detected in 69% of cases. The most com-
mon sites of distant metastasis were spinal vertebrae and pelvic bones
(54%) followed by brain, lung, pleura and liver.
Conclusion: The frequency of de novo mPCa reported in our study was
probably affected by the intrinsic limitations of a medically underserved
area with inadequate pathology laboratory infrastructure. Further work
encompassing a larger target population and sample size in all regions
of Cameroon is needed. In low-income African countries, it is necessary
to improve current plans on early diagnosis of prostate cancer due to
limited access by the general population to drugs that increase advanced
prostate cancer survival.

Hepatic space-occupying lesions masquerading as hepatobiliary tu-
mours: a clinicopathologic study
T. Laohawetwanit*, N. Wanpiyarat, N. Lerttanatum
*Division of Pathology, Chulabhorn International College of Medicine,
Thammasat University, Pathumthani, Thailand
Background & objectives: The need for liver biopsy for hepatic space-
occupying lesions has been sharply reduced due to advancements in non-
invasive techniques. We conducted a clinicopathologic study to evaluate
liver biopsy's diagnostic value compared with non-invasive techniques in
assessing hepatic space-occupying lesions.
Methods: A 6-year retrospective analysis was conducted at a tertiary
hospital in Thailand. All cases in which the provisional clinical (i.e.,
pre-biopsy) diagnosis was primary liver carcinoma were retrieved. The
histopathology of all recruited cases was reviewed. The pathological di-
agnosis was rendered primarily based on routine histopathology using
immunostaining as an adjunct.
Results: A total of 302 clinically diagnosed primary liver carcinoma was
retrieved. After a thorough histopathological examination, most of these
cases (97.7%, N=295) were correctly diagnosed by radiological studies.
Only seven non-hepatobiliary tumours, accounting for 2.3% of our series,
were initially misclassified as hepatobiliary neoplasms, including hepato-
cellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Epstein-Barr vi-
rus-associated smooth muscle tumour, endometriosis, and
leiomyosarcoma could clinically mimic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
In contrast, gastrointestinal stromal tumour, neuroendocrine neoplasms
(including well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumour and poorly differ-
entiated neuroendocrine carcinoma), and angiosarcoma could mimic he-
patocellular carcinoma.
Conclusion: Pre-biopsy (i.e., radiological) diagnosis is very accurate in
terms of diagnosing hepatic space-occupying lesions. However, patho-
logical evaluation still plays a role in a minority of cases. Pathologists
should be familiar with a wide variety of histomorphology of uncommon
primary liver tumours and metastases with appropriate use of immuno-
histochemistry to diagnose these rare hepatic space-occupying lesions.

Validation of VENTANA (SP263) PD-L1 immunohistochemistry
(IHC) assay in formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) cytology
samples
C. Barker*, H. Horne, P. Scorer, B. Roland, D. Hayden, K. Schnittker
*Precision Medicine and Biomarkers, AstraZeneca R&D, United
Kingdom
Background & objectives: Assessment of PD-L1 expression to deter-
mine suitability for treatment with immunotherapy is important in non-
small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Here we describe the validation of
fine needle aspirate (FNA) cytology samples for reliable reporting of PD-
L1 expression in NSCLC.
Methods: Fine needle aspirate (FNA) samples from NSCLC patients
were obtained as FFPE blocks. 4-5μm sections were stained using the
VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay. Scoring was performed at a cut-off of
≥1% tumour cells (TC) with membrane positivity for PD-L1 at any
Virchows Arch
intensity above background. Intermediate and inter/intra-reader precision
and cut slide stability were evaluated.
Results: Prevalence of TC ≥1% in the commercially obtained cohort was
50.3% (82/163). Intermediate (inter-day) precision (overall agreement) at
the TC ≥1% cut-off was 100.0% (95%CI: 94.0-100.0%). Intra-reader
precision was 98.3% (95%CI: 95.8-100.0%) and inter-reader precision
was 96.7% (95%CI: 91.7-100.0%). Average positive and negative agree-
ment were >95% across all reader precision studies. The cut slide stability
for unstained slides was confirmed up to two months. Additional time
points could not be tested due to sample yield limitations.
Conclusion: The VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay is robust and reli-
able at a TC ≥1% cut-off when used on FFPE FNA samples from NSCLC
patients. In cases where a cytology sample is the only sample available, a
situation common in early-stage disease, use of such samples for PD-L1
testing may remove the requirement for invasive tissue biopsies, thereby
increasing the opportunity for a PD-L1 test result for NSCLC patients.

BAP-1 immunohistochemical expression in pleural and peritoneal
mesothelioma
E. Kilicarslan, E. Comut, N. Demirkan, A. Gormez, S. Baser Oncel, A.
Yaren, F. Bir*
*Pamukkale Univ., Turkey
Background & objectives: Somatic BAP-1 (BRCA1-Associated Protein
1) mutations are reported in mesothelioma. In this study, we aimed to
investigate the contribution of loss of BAP-1 expression of mesothelioma
and the relationship between BAP-1 expression loss and survival.
Methods: BAP-1 expression was examined immunohistochemically in
41 mesothelioma cases (36 pleural, 5 peritoneal). The BAP-1 slides were
evaluated semi-quantitatively as “focal loss”, “total loss” and “no loss”.
Results: The ages of the cases were in the range of 36-80 (median 68). Of
the 41 cases, 27 were epithelioid (65.9%), 9 were biphasic (22%), and 5
(12.2%) were sarcomatoid type mesothelioma. Survival data of 39 cases
were available. 78% of the cases had died. Overall survival ranged from 1
month to 48 months. BAP-1 loss was evaluated as total loss in 53.7% and
focal loss in 12.2% of the cases. BAP-1 loss was not observed in any of
the sarcomatoid type mesothelioma cases. A statistically significant rela-
tionship was found between BAP-1 loss and histopathological type
(p=0.004). Overall survival was increased in mesothelioma cases show-
ing loss of BAP-1 (p=0,025).
Conclusion: In the literature, most of the studies show that loss of
BAP-1 expression is associated with epitheloid subtype and lon-
ger survival. In our study, we did not observe BAP-1 loss in any
of 5 sarcomatoid mesothelioma. Although our study supports the
literature, since the number of our cases is low, this situation
should be supported by more studies.

Immunohistochemical profile of control cell cycle and proliferation
proteins of atypical lung epithelium with diffuse alveolar damage in
comparison with lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma of the lung
N.Boriskin*,D.Protsenko,A.Avdalyan,I.Tyurin,A.Shilov,O.Zaratyants
*City Hospital №40, Moscow, Russia
Background& objectives: Morphologyof atypical lung epithelium (ALE)
caused by diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is similar to lepidic-predominant
adenocarcinoma (LPA) of the lung therefore it is hard to distinguish them in
some cases. We aim to compare expression proteins in ALE and LPA.
Methods: Twenty-four autopsy cases of patients who died from acute
respiratory damage syndrome induced by COVID-19 and four cases of
LPA. We made slides with the following antibodies: p53, Ki67, p16 for
each of the cases, and p63 for four cases. We used H-score for estimating
and U-test for statistical analysis.
Results: We found statistically significant differences only in p16 H-
score subgroup (group ALE< group LPA, p-value=0,0057). Also, we
noticed differences in p63 H-score subgroup (ALE - 66 and 27; LPA -
0 and 0), but the sample is not enough for statistical analysis.
Conclusion: We found that in LPA cases level of expression p16 is
significantly higher than in ALE cases with DAD caused by COVID-
19, also there were no significant differences in subgroups p53 and Ki67.
We suggest, based on a small sample, that expression p63 is significantly
higher in AE, but it is required further research.

*Karagandy Medical University, Kazakhstan
Background & objectives: An urgent problem of modern occupational
medicine is the study of the role of exogenous and endogenous factors, the
assessment of changes in the indicators of ventilation function and the lead-
ing mechanisms of pathology of the bronchopulmonary system in miners.
Methods: There were investigated 30 healthy workers with an average
work experience (5-15 years) and 80 miners with occupational lung dis-
eases by spirography method: First (I) group 30 people with chronic dust
bronchitis-37.5%; II group - 25 persons with chronic obstructive dust
bronchitis -31.25%; III group - 25 people with chronic obstructive bron-
chitis complicated by emphysema of the lungs -31.25%.
Results: Spectrographic analysis revealed a decrease to 70.03% (P<0.001)
and 67.10% (P<0.001) in groups I and II compared to the norm - 92.57%.
In group III miners, the decrease to 60.71% (P<0.001) was pronounced.
In group 2, the capnographic index significantly increased by 12.43%
(P<0.05) and in group III by 9.44% (P<0.01) than in healthy workers
with 5-10 years of experience.
The patency of the proximal bronchi in group II significantly decreased
by 70.37% (P<0.01) and in group 3 to a pronounced degree to 59.03%
(P<0.001), which indicates destructive changes in the histomorphological
properties of lung tissue. The patency of the distal bronchi depends on the
residual lung capacity in all groups.
Conclusion: The emphysema index showed a significant increase in
group III of 1.13 kPa (P<0.001), expressed in group II of 0.87 kPa
(P<0.05), in group I they tended to significantly increase.
Pathological changes are caused by mechanisms: 1) predominance of
bronchospasm, 2) tracheobronchial dyskinesia, 3) obstruction of the
bronchial tree with viscous mucus and sputum, 4) "valve mechanism",
which depend on the histomorphology of the tissue, genetic predisposi-
tion and high resistance of the disease by workers and progress with
increasing work experience.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) PD-L1 testing landscape chal-
lenges in the context of upcoming in vitro diagnostics regulation
(IVDR) implementation
G. Courtois*, L. Parnham, K.E. Keating, P. Riccelli, D. Smart, S.
Munksted, J. Clark, K. Kerr
*Diaceutics, France
Background & objectives: Impending IVDR implementation poten-
tially disrupts current PD-L1 testing practice for all indications.
IVDR compliance will require laboratories use only approved
therapy specific CE IVD tests. Alternatively, criteria will exist
for health institution laboratories to justify Laboratory Developed
Test (LDT) use.
Virchows Arch
Methods: Our DXRX data repository consisting of real-world data from
116 pathology laboratories performing PD-L1 testing for NSCLC across
France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK was analysed from January-
June 2020 to understand laboratory accreditation status, institution type,
and PD-L1 testing practices, including LDT vs kit preference, to assess
the potential impact of IVDR enforcement on NSCLC PD-L1 testing.
Results: PD-L1 testing practice varies extensively. Commercial kit use oc-
curs primarily in the UK (100%) and Spain (87%). Most utilized kits are
Dako 22C3 pharmDx (29%) or VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay (13%).
LDTs(standaloneantibodiesorkitsusedoff-label)aremorecommonlyused
inFrance(96%),Germany(88%)andItaly(66%).Atleast4differentclones
are employed as LDTs across European labs, with most diverse selection
observed within Germany. Ventana, Dako, Leica, and Zytomed platforms
are installed, with Ventana having the largest footprint (71%) across all
markets. The extent of LDT use identifies that IVDR enforcement will
potentially impact up to 62% of PD-L1 testing labs across Europe.
Conclusion: Laboratories using LDTs will need to comply with accred-
itation and LDT/commercial kit equivalence requirements. IVDR adher-
ence in the NSCLC PD-L1 context will be challenging for many
European labs justifying continued LDT use versus transitioning to mul-
tiple approved kits and/or platforms. Availability of limited sample, spe-
cific IHC platform and multiple PD-L1 drug-CDx pairs will further chal-
lenge compliance. Inability of laboratories to comply with IVDR may
reduce the number of accessible PD-L1 test options and potentially intro-
duce treatment bias in patient management.

Histopathological features of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneu-
monia in patients with lung cancer: review of cases of an oncology
institute
A. Coutada*, A.L. Cunha
*Pathology Department of the Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto,
Portugal
Background & objectives: COVID-19 is an infection caused by the
recently discovered coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Pulmonary changes are
significant, the majority of reported cases showing diffuse alveolar dam-
age. We pretend to describe histopathological findings caused by
COVID-19 in patients surgically treated for lung cancer.
Methods: We’re analysing pulmonary histopathological features of all
patients with lung carcinoma that had COVID-19 disease and were treat-
ed with surgery in our Oncology Institute since the beginning of the
pandemic. Because all specimens harbour a neoplasm, besides tissue
sampling for histology to document tumour, we’re sampling pulmonary
parenchyma, some with macroscopically visible lesions, photographing
and documenting all pathological findings.
Results: The majority of our patients have lung adenocarcinoma. Surgery
is the mainstay of therapy, with or without neoadjuvant radiotherapy and/
or chemotherapy. Depending on the length of the disease and previous
treatment, the morphological features seen in lung specimens vary.
Pathological examinations reveal that, apart from the tumour and its in-
herent changes in the adjacent parenchyma, the lungs of these patients
have interstitial proliferation of fibroblasts, lymphocytic infiltration, intra-
alveolar macrophages, organizing pneumonia, type II pneumocyte hyper-
plasia and multinucleated enlarged pneumocytes. Some still have areas
with fibrin deposition and hyaline membranes. At the moment, the major
changes seen in our lung specimens represent a subacute phase with
organizing pneumonia pattern.
Conclusion: COVID-19 is still affecting many countries globally and
most pathological information collected and described at this time is from
autopsies of patients that died with acute disease. Histopathological data
regarding COVID-19 survivors with full recovery, reparative aspects or
persistent disease is still very limited. Our access to these patient’s lung
specimens is a crucial opportunity to recall and share important informa-
tion that can help to further understand the evolution of this disease.

Peripheral squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the terminal respira-
tory unit: an unusual presentation of a preinvasive neoplasia
C. Faria*, A. Lai, V. Almeida, M.B. Pimentão, F. Ramalhosa, J. Gama, J.
Madeira, B. Sepodes, G. Fontinha, L. Carvalho
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário, Portugal
Background & objectives: Preinvasive precursor lesions for bronchial-
pulmonary carcinomas keep being searched for early diagnosis.
Peripheral squamous metaplasia / basal cell hyperplasia with dysplasia
and carcinoma in situ have not yet been described as the majority arise in
central airways.
Methods: A 65-year-old man, smoker, with previously diagnosed hepatic
cirrhosis that evolved to hepatocellular carcinoma, and submitted to sur-
gery in 2017, presented in routine follow up a pulmonary nodule with
33x22x24mm in the right lower lobe. After biopsy was performed, diag-
nosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung was established and the patient was
submitted to lobectomy and lymphadenectomy.
Results: Gross examination showed a white to grayish, firm mass with
4,5x4x1,6cm, well delimitated. Several sections for the carcinoma and
pulmonary parenchyma were observed.
Acinar adenocarcinoma with lepidic, papillary and micropapillary pat-
terns was reported. The neoplastic cells were positive for CK7, TTF1
and PD-L1 (70%) and presented a low proliferation index (5%).
Occasional mucinous neoplastic cells were characterized (PAS-D).
In surrounding tissue, a terminal respiratory unit (TRU) exhibited a lesion
we called squamous cell carcinoma in situ composed of cells with eosin-
ophilic cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and
occasional mitotic figures, expressing CK5.6 and were negative for CK7
and CD56. TTF1 with low intensity was expressed in some cells.
Conclusion: The final report was of adenocarcinoma (acinar predomi-
nant with micropapillary, papillary and lepidic patterns) with mucinous
cells and peripheral in situ squamous cell carcinoma of the TRU. Neuro-
endocrine cells hyperplasia was also present.
Peripheral localization of a squamous cell carcinoma in situ is recognized
after bronchiolization of bronchus epithelium, especially when related to
smoking.
Several samplings of lobectomy support the identification of preinvasive
lesions as described in this case.

Endobronchial lipomas, a rare entity: clinicopathological study of 12
cases
Y. Gomez Navarro*, M. Garcia Martos, A. Panizo Santos
*HGU GREOGRIO MARAÑÓN, Spain
Background & objectives: Lipomas are benign tumours that can arise in
nearly any location. In the bronchial tree, lipomatous tumours have been
reported rarely. The diagnosis is additionally complicated by the common
presence of adipose tissue within pulmonary hamartomas.
Methods: Cases were obtained by searching the surgical pathology ar-
chives of the 2 hospitals, originally diagnosed as lipoma involving the
bronchus for the period 1990 to 2020. The cases were reviewed by the
authors, yielding a study group of 12 cases. Clinical information was
obtained from the existing medical record.
Results: The patients ranged in age from 60 to 81 years. All patients were
male. All but three patients were smokers. Sites of involvement in the
bronchial tree included: right main bronchus (1), left main bronchus (1),
right lower lobe bronchus (1), right upper lobe bronchus (2), left lower
lobe bronchus (2), and left upper lobe bronchus (5). All lesions were
described as “polypoid” at the time of bronchoscopy, and the clinical
impression was that of a benign neoplasm. All lesions showed similar
morphology: mature adipose tissue predominated. Examination of all
sections did not reveal any areas of cellular atypia or mitoses. Typical
features of pulmonary hamartoma were not identified.
Virchows Arch
Conclusion: Bronchial lipomas, such as the current serie, are extremely
rare. They are often found incidentally. Endobronchial lipomas tend to
cause symptoms, particularly those related to obstruction. In our series
these tumours are more common in men and in the left lung. Most of the
tumours in our series were small and discovered incidentally.
Endobronchial lipomas should be distinguished from fat-rich pulmonary
hamartomas. All endobronchial lipomatous tumours in the present series
behaved in a benign manner.

The rat lungs reaction to the silicon compound solved in water of
different hardness
E. Grigoreva*, V. Gordova, V. Sergeeva, A. Smorodchenko
*FGBOU VO "ChGU im. I.N. Ulyanov", Russia
Background & objectives: It is known that inhalation of amorphous
silica particles leads to the lung fibrosis. Is it possible to find similar
changes in lungs when the silicon intake occurs with the drinking water
of the different hardness?
Methods: We studied the lung of white outbred male rats. Control groups
(n=5 in each group) received ad libitum drinking bottled water, distilled
water and tap water. Experimental groups received the same water sup-
plemented with sodium metasilicate (10 mg/l). After 9 months rats were
sacrificed. The lungs were isolated, fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in
paraffin, cut and stained with hematoxylin-eosin.
Results: The specific gravity of the lungs relative to body weight of rat was
1,44% (333 g) and 0,85% (487,5 g) for experimental and control group with
bottled water respectively. In histological slides of lungs, we noticed that
undertheinfluenceofthesiliconnumerousareasofnecrosisappeared.Also,
we found the number of alveoli decreased (1,7 times), alveoli merged to-
gether, the diameter of the alveoli increases 1,4 times, the interalveolar septa
in rats receiving silicon 1,6 times thinner than those in the rats of the control
group. Similar visible and microscopic changes were also observed in the
lungs of rats that received silicon compound with tap and distilled water.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that the silicon acts on the lungs of
laboratory rats in the same and does not depend on the hardness of the
water in which it is dissolved. The daily use of water in rats with the
addition of silicon negatively affects the state of the lungs, leading ulti-
mately to silicosis, regardless of the original composition of the water.

*Institute for Pulmonary Diseases of Vojvodina, Sremska Kamenica,
Serbia
Background & objectives: Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibi-
tors is limited to patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) and high tumour expression of programmed death ligand 1
(PD-L1). The objective this study was to examine PD-L1 expression in
patients with NSCLC.
Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 22C3-PD-L1 expressions of 204
patients from Institute for Lung Diseases of Vojvodina in Sremska
Kamenica that were diagnosed with NSCLC. The percentage of viable
tumourcellsshowingpartialorcompletemembranestainingatanyintensity
was tumour proportion score (TPS). PD-L1 status was reported as: negative
(TPS<1), low expression (TPS 1-49%), and high expression (TPS≥50%).
Results: In this study, 123 men and 81 women were included with an
average age of 64 years (from 31 to 86). The most patients were in III/IV
stage NSCLC (179; 88%) and had good performance status (199; 96%),
positive smoking history (176; 86%) and had adenocarcinoma histology
(119; 58%). TPS was negative in 85/204 (42%) patients, in 65/204 (32%)
showed low expression and in 54/204 (26%) demonstrated high expression.
Conclusion: The rate of 22C3-PD-L1 expression of NSCLC detected in
this study was similar to the frequencies of the published data in world
literature.

B. Krajnovic*, N. Gardic, D. Tegeltija, V. Sekerus, D. Miljkovic, A.
Lovrenski
*Institute for Pulmonary Diseases of Vojvodina, Sremska Kamenica,
Serbia
Background & objectives: Transthoracic fine needle aspiration
(TTFNA) has become a widely used technique for peripheral lung lesions
evaluation. The objectives of our study were to examine the adequacy of
samples and sensitivity of TTFNA in the diagnosis of peripheral pulmo-
nary lesions.
Methods: Retrospective study included 248 patients who underwent
TTFNA of peripheral pulmonary lesions and consequential surgical pro-
cedure in 5-year period. The material was processed at the Department of
Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics. The following were analysed: sex,
age, adequacy of cytological samples (CS) for diagnosis and molecular
testing, tumour localization and dimensions, as well as cytological and
pathohistological characteristics of lesions.
Results: The adequacy of the CS was 93.15%. The proportion of adequate-
diagnostic samples was higher in patients with lesion >4cm and this differ-
ence shows statistical significance. CS of lung adenocarcinoma have a high
adequacy for EGFR analyses of 92.75% and it doesn’t depend on the size
and location of the lesion. The most commonly diagnosed lung tumour was
adenocarcinoma (45.51%), squamous cell carcinoma (31,43%) and
NSCLC-NOS (16,77%). Patients with NSCLS-NOS in CS, after
pathohistological analyses were diagnosed most commonly with adenocar-
cinoma (53.85%), followed with squamous cell carcinoma (26,92%) and
large cell carcinoma (11,51%). The sensitivity of TTFNA for peripheral
lesions was 71% - for malignant (75.24%) and for benign (28.57%).
Conclusion: TTFNA is an effective and highly sensitive method in de-
termining the aetiology of peripheral pulmonary lesions.

Feasibility of next-generation sequencing in RNA obtained from fi-
broblastic foci of a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis rat model
F. Lunardi*, V. Tauro, M.J. Acosta, F. Pezzuto, F. Fortarezza, V. Pitozzi,
P. Caruso, S. Pontis, M. Trevisani, F. Calabrese
*University of Padova, Italy
Background & objectives: Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mu-
rine models are used to dissect out lung fibrogenesis mechanisms. The
main goal of the study was to extract adequate RNA from lung tissue
microdissected fibroblastic foci (FF),the active lesion in usual interstitial
pneumonia pattern, for RNA-sequencing.
Methods: Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis rat models (Sprague
Dawley) were used to isolate FF by laser microdissection and to extract
RNA using the RNeasy® FFPE kit, modified in our Laboratory. The final
RNA concentration was assessed by the Qubit RNA Assay Kit and the
RNA quality by a 2100 Bioanalyzer Agilent 6000 Pico Kit (expressed as
percentage of RNA fragments >200 nucleotides-DV200).
Results: Six bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis rat models were de-
veloped, and two of them were treated with Nintedanib. After morpho-
logical evaluation of lung tissue samples, clear-cut signs of fibrotic re-
modelling were detected in all animals, but treated rats showed a very
small number of FF. FF from two rats, one treated and one untreated,
were isolated (area: 0.03 and 0.11mm2) and, despite the small tissue
amount, adequate RNA was extracted: its average concentration was
750pg/μL with a DV200 mean value of 52% (low-medium quality).
These results are in line with those obtained from tissue samples of
Virchows Arch
patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (mean area: 0.40mm2, aver-
age RNA concentration: 2992.8 pg/μl, mean DV200: 47%).
Conclusion: These data showed that this protocol, optimized in our lab-
oratory, led to the extraction of adequate RNA for RNA-sequencing from
small formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. The study of gene ex-
pression signatures in specific cells/areas of archival tissue, also obtained
from experimental animal models, represents an important issue for a
better understanding of disease pathogenesis and for the identification
of crucial biomarkers. RNA-sequencing results will be presented during
the forthcoming congress, particularly focusing on gene expression in
clinical vs experimental samples.

Multicentre evaluation of the Idylla™GeneFusion cartridge in lung
cancer
A. Lupo*
*Department of pathology, Hôpital Cochin, AP-HP, Université de Paris,
France
Background & objectives: Targeted therapy in NSCLC requires the
assessment of multiple oncogenic driver mutations, including fusion
genes. This retrospective study evaluated the Idylla™Genefusion
cartridges, which detect alterations in the ALK, ROS1, RET and
NTRK1/2/3 genes, and MET exon14 skipping mutation (METex14).
Methods: This multicentre study (17 centres) included 312 FFPE
tissue samples from NSCLC patients : 117 ALK; 43 ROS1; 21
RET; 3 NTRK1 and 1 NTRK3 rearrangements; 31 METex14, and
96 wild-type samples, previously obtained by routine reference
methods (NGS/FISH/rt-PCR). One to 3 sections of 5 to 10 μm
FFPE tissue were used with ≥10% of tumour content.
Results: Valid results for all biomarkers were obtained with Idylla™
in 275 cases. The overall concordance between Idylla™and refer-
ence methods was 93%, the global sensitivity and specificity were
respectively 93.4% and 93.5%. The positive concordance was
97.2%, 91.9%, 100%, 100%, 100% for ALK, ROS1, RET,
METex14, and NTRK, respectively and the negative concordance
was 96.9%, 97.9%, 98.8%, 98.6%, 99.4% for ALK, ROS1, RET,
METex14 and NTRK, respectively. The discordances were divided
into 6 samples with alteration identified by Idylla™and not detect-
ed by the reference methods ; and 13 samples with no detected
alteration by Idylla™but identified by the reference methods, in-
cluding 7 FISH without NGS validation.
Conclusion: Idylla™GeneFusion is an automated, reliable, ease-of-
use, simple (<2 minutes hands-on time) test, and has the shortest
turnaround time compared to existing diagnostic tests (3 hours turn-
around time), enabling the detection of clinically relevant alterations
in ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK1/2/3 rearrangements, and MET
exon 14 skipping mutation, without necessitating molecular exper-
tise or infrastructure.

Pulmonary congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation: particular
cases diagnosed in adults
M. Mlika*, C. Ben Cheikh, M. Abdennadher, F. Sassi, E. Braham, R.
Ayadi, O. Ismail, F. Mezni
*Abderrahman mami hospital, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Pulmonary congenital cystic adenomatoid
malformation accounts for 25% of congenital lesions. It is usually
diagnosed in neonatal period but can be diagnosed during adult-
hood. Our aim was to describe the clinical, microscopic features
of 7 cases diagnosed in our department.
Methods: between 2000 and 2011, 7 cases of pulmonary congenital
cystic adenomatoid malformations were diagnosed. The information
concerning the age, sex, symptoms, radiological findings, therapeu-
tic modalities and microscopic findings were collected.
Results: Our study contained 6 men and 1 woman with a mean age of
16.2 years. The most frequent symptoms consisted in bronchitis in 6
cases, with chest pain in 2 cases. Radiologic findings consisted in a
heterogeneous cystic opacity in all cases. CT-scan revealed cystic lesions
in 6 cases and bronchial dilatation lesions in 1 case. Surgical resection
was performed in all cases consisting in lobectomy in 6 cases and pneu-
monectomy in 1 case. Microscopic exam concluded to a pulmonary con-
genital cystic adenomatoid malformation in all cases. No patient present-
ed complications within a follow-up period of 28.8 months.
Conclusion: Inspite of the rarity of pulmonary congenital cystic
adenomatoid malformations in adults, the diagnosis should be suspected
when facing a symptomatology of recurrent bronchitis associated with
multilocular cystic masses. The prognosis of the lesions depends on the
microscopic subtype and the size of the lesions. The treatment is based on
surgical excision.

KRAS G12C mutated lung adenocarcinomas: a morphological and
molecular cartography
R. Pirlog*, N. Piton, F. Marguet, A. Lamy, J. Sabourin
*UMF "Iuliu Hatieganu" Cluj-Napoca, Romania
Background & objectives: KRAS mutations are present in 30% of
lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs). KRAS G12C LUADs have be-
come a major subject of interest after promising clinical trials of
Sotorasib. We present a cartography of a LUADs series harbouring
the KRAS G12C mutation.
Methods: All LUADs with a KRAS G12C mutation diagnosed be-
tween 2016 and 2020 using a Next Generation Sequencing 26 gene
panel for lung cancer were included in our study. Each case was
individually assessed by two experienced pathologists for morpho-
logical characteristics including histological type, nuclear atypia,
necrosis, and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) count.
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for TTF1 and PD-L1.
Results: 200 KRAS G12C mutated LUAD were retrieved. The mean
age was 62 years; 36.5% female and 63.5% male. The principal
histologic subtypes were adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified
40% and acinar 30% of cases. The number of TILs was high or
moderate in more than 50% of cases. Nuclear atypia was present
in 68.5% and necrosis in 30% of cases. The immunohistochemical
profile showed TTF1 positivity in 78% and PD-L1 positivity in 42%
of cases. The molecular profile showed a strong association between
KRAS G12C and STK11 mutations in 25% of cases. The co-
mutated KRAS G12C-STK11 cases were associated with a higher
number of TILs and a lower PD-L1 positivity.
Conclusion: KRAS G12C mutated LUADs represent a particular
subtype characterized by a high inflammatory infiltrate, a relatively
low PD-L1 positivity and a complex molecular profile with intricate
interaction with various genes including STK11. A more in-depth
characterization of the tumour histology, surrounding microenviron-
ment and molecular profile of this specific subtype of LUAD could
be useful to better select the patients that could benefit from novel
targeted therapies to achieve the best treatment response.

Background & objectives: Diagnosis of lung cancer entails invasive
procedures such as endobronchial ultrasound and needle biopsy pos-
ing significant risks. Could the molecular detection of oncological
markers be diagnostic when performed using minimal material from
liquid based cytology (LBC) or peripheral blood specimens?

mutations were detected in peripheral blood. 1 case where mutant KRAS
was not detected in peripheral blood was staged at T1cN1M0. Of the 17
samples where mutant KRAS was not detected, Wild type KRAS was
detected by both tissue and plasma testing. Therefore confirming 100%
specificity and an actionable basis for G12C treatment.
Conclusion: Our preliminary results show promise for the detection of
mutant KRAS in NSCLC LBC and peripheral blood samples. Such ap-
plication provides a means of rapid, non-invasive diagnostic turnover at
local centres. Furthermore, given the reported higher prevalence of the
KRAS mutation to the mutually exclusive molecular mutations (EGFR,
ALK and ROS-1) we propose testing for the KRAS mutation first. This
could therefore rationalise molecular testing and furthermore streamline
molecular diagnostic resources.

SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated thoracic tumour: a case report
and a review of literature on a rare novel entity
A.P. Rodrigues*, N.J. Lamas, A. Coelho, J.R. Vizcaíno
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário do Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated thoracic
tumour is a recently described entity with particular clinicopathologic (male
predominance, smoking history, mediastinum, lung and/or pleura involve-
ment) and molecular (SMARCA4 mutations/expression loss) features. The
prognosis is poor with a median survival time of 6-7 months.
Methods: Here we report a case of a 68-year-old male with a 50 pack-
year smoking history who recently quit. He underwent a thoracic CT scan
due to respiratory symptoms (cough and dyspnea for minimal efforts)
with detection of a right lower lung mass with 36mm. A transthoracic
biopsy was performed.
Results: Histological examination showed lung parenchyma extensively
occupied by a solid pattern neoplasia composed by epithelioid and
rhabdoid cells with amphophilic cytoplasm, some with rhabdoid inclu-
sions, and round vesicular nucleus with prominent nucleoli.
Immunostains show focal equivocal positivity for CAM5.2 and pan-ker-
atin. However, the tumour cells are also clearly negative for SMARCA4,
indicating loss of the product of this gene in SWI/SNF complex, and in
addition, there is strong nuclear positivity for SOX2 and SALL4.
Conclusion: The SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated thoracic tumour
is a challenging diagnosis, especially in the context of a lung/mediastinal
biopsy where the product is usually scarce. Awareness of this entity and
its morphology are essential for a correct diagnosis. It is important to
disclose this neoplasia because as it becomes more well-known and ad-
ditional cases begin to be identified, a more complete and accurate picture
of its presentation, prognosis, and how these tumours should be staged
and treated will become more apparent.

Ayadi, F. Mezni
*Department of Pathology, Abderrahmen Mami Hospital, Ariana, Tunisia
Background & objectives: T Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a rare form of
aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is a neoplasm of lymphoblasts
committed to T-cell lineage. The aim of this study is to describe the
clinicopathological characteristics of T lymphoblastic lymphomas.
Methods: We report a retrospective study of 49 cases of T Lymphoblastic
lymphoma diagnosed at our department of pathology between 2001 and
2020. The diagnosis was made on lymph node biopsies in 11 cases,
pleural biopsies in 15 cases and mediastinal biopsies in 23 cases.
Immunohistochemical studies using CD3, CD20, Tdt, CD99 and CD1a
antibodies were realized in all cases.
Results: Of the 49 patients, 31 were men and 18 were women aged
between 6 to 87 years with a mean of 29. Histopathologic examination
showed a dense and diffuse lymphoid proliferation composed of small to
medium size tumour cell with scant cytoplasm, slightly distorted round
nuclei with fine chromatin and indistinct or small nucleoli. Mitotic figures
were numerous. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the tumour
cells expressed CD3, CD99 and CD1a in all cases and Tdt in only 44
cases. CD20 was negative in all cases.
Conclusion: T lymphoblastic lymphoma is a rare disease which repre-
sents about 2% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas occurring in late child-
hood adolescent and young adult men. Mediastinal mass, pleural and
pericardial effusions are the major clinical presentations of T lymphoblas-
tic lymphomas. The main differential diagnosis involves type B1
thymoma with prominent immature T-cells. Generally, a poor prognosis
has been related to T-phenotype relative to B-cell lineage.

Potential role of Tenascin C (TNC) in human lung adenocarcinoma
progression
M. Schlensog*, A. Ruehlmann, L. Haeberle, A. Becher, W. Goering, J.
Limberg, W.T. Knoefel, I. Esposito
*Institute of Pathology, Heinrich-Heine University and University
Hospital Duesseldorf, Germany
Background & objectives: Tenascin C (TNC) is an extracellular ma-
trix protein and a potential biomarker affecting progression of differ-
ent tumour types, such as pancreatic and lung cancer. In this study,
we investigated the functional role of TNC in adenocarcinomas of
the lung.
Methods: TNC expression was evaluated by IHC of 130 patients includ-
ing lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD), normal tissues and metastases.
Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas data set, we examined the correlation
between TNC mRNA expression and EGFR aberration. LUAD cells
(with/without EGFR mutation) were tested for their invasion capabilities
during exposure to human lung fibroblast (HLF) conditioned medium
after siTNC knockdown.
Results: Immunohistochemical staining of TNC in LUAD showed a
peritumoral stromal expression, which was significantly increased
(P<0.0001) expression in primary tumour samples compared to normal
lung tissue. Further, we found a significant correlation between TNC
mRNA expression and EGFR aberration, especially an increased TNC
mRNA expression in cases with higher EGFR copy number as well as
EGFR protein level (P<0.0001; R=0.276). In line with these results, the
EGFR-mutated H1975 LUAD cell line demonstrated a significant de-
crease in cell invasion when cultured with TNC-depleted HLF-medium
and displayed a smaller lamellipodia perimeter and smaller surface area
after treatment with TNC-depleted HLF medium.
Conclusion: Increased TNC protein level is observed in the peritumoral
stroma of lung adenocarcinoma samples and correlates with EGFR aber-
rations in silico. Inhibition of TNC in lung fibroblasts leads to reduced
invasiveness of LUAD cells harbouring EGFR-activating mutations. This
study provides the evidence that TNC expression might be a biological
relevant factor in LUAD progression in an EGFR-dependent manner and
that it regulates tumour cell invasion by rearrangement of the actin cyto-
skeleton, especially affecting lamellipodia formation.

Systemic extra-nodal Rosai-Dorfman disease with increased serum
IgG4 level and absence of KRAS and MAP2K1 mutations: a case
report
R. Shi*, T.P.T. Koh, C.H. Kuick, K.T.E. Chang, A. Takano
*Singapore General Hospital, Singapore
Background & objectives: Rosai-Dorfman disease and IgG4-related
disease(IgG4-RD) are both uncommon entities which have been reported
showing overlapping histopathological features. Herein, we reported a
case of systemic extra-nodal Rosai-Dorfman disease with increased se-
rum IgG4 level, and histolopathologically mimicking IgG4-RD.
Methods: Rosai-Dorfman disease and IgG4-related disease(IgG4-RD)
are both uncommon entities which have been reported showing overlap-
ping histopathological features. Herein, we reported a case of systemic
extra-nodal Rosai-Dorfman disease with increased serum IgG4 level, and
histolopathologically mimicking IgG4-RD.
Results: An excision biopsy of the left chest wall lesion was carried out
and it featured a histiocytic neoplasm composed of large histiocytes with
conspicuous emperipolesis. These histiocytes are positive for S100,
CD68 and CD163, negative for CD1a. The surrounding stroma displayed
fibrosis and an increased IgG4 positive plasma cell rich (IgG4/IgG ratio
>40%) lymphoplasmacytic infiltration.
Next generation sequencing was performed on the chest wall lesion. No
mutations,particularlyKRASandMAP2K1orgenefusionswereidentified.
The patient was treated with steriods after the resection. The follow-up at
three months interval showed decreased size of the left posterior parietal
lesion and no other new lesion.
Conclusion: The Rosai-Dorfman disease has been known to demonstrate
overlapping features of IgG4-RD on histopathological ground. The un-
usual presence of increased serum IgG4 level in current case may mislead
the clinical judgment. However, a careful histology examination in con-
junction with the awareness of the overlapping features of these two
diseases will help us to arrive on a correct diagnosis.

Clinical-radiopathological correlation in post-mortem pulmonar bi-
opsies of patients with COVID 19
S. Silva*, M.F. Sánchez de la Fuente, V. Pedrero, V. Cristobal, C.
Alenda, M.F. Peiró Marques, J.M. Ramos, J. Arenas, I. Aranda López
*University Hospital in Alicante, Spain
Background & objectives: Numerous studies have confirmed the pres-
ence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) as the main cause of respiratory
failure in patients with COVID 19.
We have studied 57 post-mortem biopsies with others relevant findings.
Methods: Percutaneous core needle biopsies post-mortem were per-
formed to patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Five groups of anatomo-pathological findings were constituted (DAD in
exudative phase, DAD in proliferative phase, mixed DAD, lung tissue
with nonspecific alterations and lung tissue without alterations). Each
group was correlated with clinical and radiological variables.
Results: 57 biopsies were performed. The mean age was 81 years (range
52-97), 68% men. DAD in exudative phase 10.2%, DAD in proliferative
phase 33.9%, mixed DAD 25.4%, non specific alterations in 15.3% and
normal lung tissue in the remaining 15.3%. Among the patients with
proliferative and mixed DAD, 7 cases with acute organized fibrinoid
pneumonia (AFOP) were included. Signs of bronchopneumonia were
observed in 23. The evolution time was approximately 20 days. The
presence of bronchopneumonia led to a faster outcome towards death,
reducing the evolution time by 12 days. The predominant symptom was
dyspnea. 70.5% of the patients with DAD had radiological alterations at
the time of admission.
Conclusion: In addition to DAD in the exudative and / or proliferative
phase, the frequent finding of lymphoid interstitial infiltrate corroborates
the severe inflammatory response caused by the virus in the lungs.
Highlight the significant number of AFOP cases in our series. From the
radiological point of view (chest X-ray and / or pulmonary CT) there is a
high level of concordance for the diagnosis of bronchopneumonia and
DAD in general, but without differentiating between the exudative and
proliferative phase.

Morphometry the lungs atelectatic areas in radiation-induced injury
S. Timofeev*, Y. Kirillov, O. Rosenberg
*FSBSI Research Institute of Human Morphology, Moscow, Russia
Background & objectives: In the malignant tumours’ treatment, such as
breast cancer, lungs or oesophagus, radiation therapy plays a substantial
role. However, this method can damage healthy lung tissue and can lead
to pulmonary collapse or fibrosis up to 30% of cases.
Methods: Six groups and a control one of male white non-linear rats
were took in this study. A single dose of 12Gy of γ-radiation was
given on the cardiac lobe of the right lung. Lung tissue samples were
removed on the 7,14 and 50-day after exposure. For histology exam-
ination the lung tissue was fixed, sectioned, stained with H&E and
then digitalized.
Results: For morphometry and statistical analysis, we used ImageJ and
R. Areas of pulmonary collapse were detected in 27% of cases. On the 7-
th day, the area of atelectasis were detected subpleural. The morphometry
showed the decrease of thickness of alveolar septa(5.29±0.74μm vs 6.69
±1,0μm in control); the mean alveolar volume (520± 233 μm2 vs control
839.58 ±156.63 μm2). Moreover, the ratio of stromal and air region was
higher than control up to 23%. However, 14-th day of experiment, we
found the enlargement of alveolar septa, progressive increasing stromal/
air ratio, and intrapulmonary atelectasis. Additionally, the muscle short-
ening(%) of the small bronchi had tendency for increasing up to 43%vs15
±5,3% in the control group.
Conclusion: On the 50-th day of experiment, the previous atelectasis
areas had tendency to develop in the “honey-comb” lung or fibrosis.
Radiation exposure can induce fast lung damage that may manifest with
subpleural atelectasis on the 7-th day. The reduction of alveolar wall
thickness may correlate with the death of alveolocytes. Intrapulmonary
atelectasis requires a prolonged period of time and correlates with
bronchoconstriction.

MMP9 and TGFβ expression in non small cell lung cancer
V. Zakharava*, M. Shapetska, G. Karapetyan
*Belarusian State Medical University, Belarus
Background & objectives: An important role in the pathogenesis of
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is applied by growth factors and
their receptors, as well as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are
associated with tumour progression. To study the features of MMP9 and
TGFβ expression in patients with NSCLC.
Methods: A surgical material was analysed from patients with NSCLC
(n=32) and a control group (n=32). Morphometric and statistical analysis
of the MMP9 and TGFβ expression was performed using
AperioImageScope v12.4.0.5043, Statistica10, MedCalc19.6 software,
p<0.05.
Results: MMP9 expression in tumour cells, regardless of the histological
type of lung cancer, was significantly higher than in the alveolar and
bronchial epithelium of the control group (U=442/р˂0,000), and also
had even higher values of positivity and intensity in the foci of lymph
node metastases (U=1935/р=0,003 and U=127/р˂0,000 respectively).
The slightly different trend was observed in relation to the expression of
TGFβ: it was the highest in the control group, decreased both in positivity
and intensity in the primary tumours (U=451/р˂0,000) and increased in
lymph node metastases (U=85/р˂0,000).
Virchows Arch
It was found following parameters were associated with the cancer-
specific survival of patients with NSCLC: the epithelial expression of
MMP9>87.5% and TGFβ>1.91%.
Conclusion: The significantly higher expression and activity of MMP-9
in tumour tissue and lymph nodes metastases and lower expression TGFβ
in tumour tissue and higher in lymph nodes metastases than in surround-
ing tissue supports the important role of these markers in the growth and
progression of lung cancer, and the possibility of their using as a sug-
gested therapeutic targets.

Intravascular fasciitis of an upper-arm blood vessel
S. Barbu*, D.M. Pop, A.C. Lisievici, T. Georgescu, F. Pop
*Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Intravascular fasciitis was first described by
Patchefsky and Enzinger in 1981 as an unusual variant of nodular fasci-
itis, which exhibited an intimate association with vascular walls. The
lesion is commonly located in the head, neck, and extremities.
Methods: A 50-year-old Caucasian male presented with a subcutaneous
mass on his right upper-arm. He reported that the lesion had increased in
size over the past weeks and denied any history of pain. Clinical exam-
ination revealed a 2.7 cm x 1.8 cm firm, smooth-surfaced, movable nod-
ule. An excisional biopsy of the soft tissue mass was performed.
Results: Grossly, the surgical specimen consisted of a soft, tan, well-
demarcated mass. Microscopic examination of the Hematoxylin and
Eosin (H&E) stained sections revealed a spindle cell proliferation ar-
ranged in a swirling and intersecting pattern entirely localized within
the lumen of a dilated blood vessel. The nuclei of the spindle cells were
relatively uniform. Mitotic activity was noted but no atypical mitotic
figures were identified. Multinucleated giant cells were scattered among
the spindle cells, along with extravasated red blood cells and lympho-
cytes. Immunohistochemistry revealed reactivity of the spindle cells for
SMA, with a Ki67 proliferation rate of less than 2%. Staining for CD34
demonstrated immunoreactivity of the vascular wall, outlining the
proliferation.
Conclusion: Through this rare case report we would like to raise aware-
ness towards this non-neoplastic lesion, as it could be misdiagnosed as
sarcoma or an intravascular neoplasm which may lead to a more aggres-
sive treatment. The diagnosis of this lesion may be facilitated by special
stains for elastic fibres or immunohistochemical stains for vascular
markers. Treatment consists of complete surgical excision, although cases
of recurrences have been reported in the scientific literature.

A case report of newly described entity: histiocyte-rich
rhabdomyoblastic tumour
S. Yilmaz Erozbek, A. Cakir*, S. Dervisoglu
*Istanbul Medipol University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Skeletal muscle tumours are classified into
benign (rabdomyoma) and malign (rabdomyosarcoma subtypes) accord-
ing to WHO book. But recently, a rabdomyoblastic tumour with certain
morphological features, as circumscription, accompanying histiocyte and
lymphocytes, very low mitosis, favourable prognosis and without myoD1
mutation is defined.
Methods: A 39-year-old male presented with a painless mass in the
thorax wall without any traumatic history. Ultrasonography showed
a solid lesion in the pectoral muscle with a suspicion of lymph node.
Tru-cut biopsy and after reporting tru-cut biopsy excision was
performed.
Results: Sections showed cellular spindle cell proliferation, some were
pleomorphic, some had eosinophilic cytoplasm. No mitosis was seen.
Tumour cells were positive for desmin, SMA; patchy positive for
myoD1, focally for myogenin; negative for S-100, CD34, caldesmon.
Ki-67 was 5%. We concluded, this lesion can be a pseudosarcomatous
proliferative myositis or an atypical rabdomyoblastic tumour with uncer-
tain malignant potential. Patient received wide excision. Macroscopically,
well circumscribed, 2x1,8x2 cm, nodular lesion is detected.
Morphological and immunohistochemical findings were similar with
tru-cut biopsy, in addition, foamy histiocyte proliferation and peripheral
lymphoid tissue were easily seen. We made the diagnosis of histiocyte-
rich rhabdomyoblastic tumour. After 4 months of follow-up, no tumour
recurrence was observed.
Conclusion: Histiocyte-rich rhabdomyoblastic tumour(HR-RMT) is an
unusual neoplasm showing skeletal muscle differentiation, involved in
trunk, lower limb, neck and seen in young-to-middle age adults with
intermediate malignancy. This tumour is clinically, morphologically
and molecularly distinct from other tumours of skeletal muscle and
angiomatoid fibrous histocytoma. Also, very recently, it is showed that
inflamatuar leiomyosarcoma and HR-RMT have similiar morphologic,
immunohistochemical and genetic features and proposed reclassification
as inflammatory rhabdomyoblastic tumour. Additionally, well
characterised cases are necessary to fully understand this tumour.

Istanbul, Turkey
Background & objectives: EBV associated smooth muscle tumour
(EBV-SMT) is a smooth muscle tumour related to EBV infection.
EBV-SMTs share similar features with conventional leiomyomas. In ad-
dition, two common findings are reported: presence of small cells with
irregular nuclear contours and intratumoral T lymphocytes.
Methods: Four years old male patient with severe asthma and allergic
symptoms presented with recurrent abdominal pain. On physical exami-
nation cafe au lait spot and multiple inguinal lymphadenopathies were
seen. Detailed patient history revealed that parents were third cousins.
Imaging studies showed bilateral adrenal mass (5,2 cm and 1,1 cm) and
biopsy was taken with adrenocortical carcinoma as preliminary diagnosis.
Results: Morphologically tumour consisted of spindle cell mesenchymal
neoplasm with mild pleomorphism, no mitoses or necrosis.
Immunohistochemically SMA, desmin, caldesmon expression were seen
with low Ki67 proliferation index. EBER-ISH was positive; case was
signed out as EBV-SMT. Four months later 9 year old brother of the
patient presented with similar symptoms. Imaging studies showed bilat-
eral adrenal mass and biopsy was taken. Morphogical and immunohisto-
chemical findings were similar, concordant with EBV-SMT.
Conclusion: EBV-SMT is a rare neoplasm seen within a wide age range.
They are seen in the setting of immune suppression from a variety of
causes, including HIV infection, congenital immunodeficiency and
post-transplant immunosuppression. It has been shown that childhood
tumours are usually associated with primary immunodeficiency
syndroms, mostly being multicentric (71%). Prognosis depends on pa-
tient’s immune system rather than morphology. We report two unique
cases of bilateral adrenal gland EBV-SMT’s presented in two brothers
with no prior diagnosed immunodeficiency syndrome.

Clinicopathologic features of a series of pleomorphic liposarcomas
from a tertiary cancer referral centre in India
S. Ghate*, B. Rekhi, A. Gulia, S. Laskar, J. Bajpai, A. Puri
*Tata Memorial Hospital, India
Background & objectives: To study various clinicopathological features
and outcomes of retrospectively diagnosed pleomorphic
liposarcomas(PLPS).
Methods: Fifty cases diagnosed as PLPS, including those diagnosed as
pleomorphic sarcomas with mention of “lipoblast” (January 2014-
December 2019), at our Institute, were evaluated(BR with SG), as per
established diagnostic criteria.
Results: Eleven(22%) cases were excluded (mostly dedifferentiated
liposarcomas(DDLPSs). Thirty-nine(78%) cases were included. Age-
range was 19-83 years(median=50). M:F ratio was 1.8:1. All tumours were
deep-seated, including 14(35.8%) in lower extremity. Tumour size ranged
from 4-25.1cm(average=12.8). Microscopically, all tumours displayed var-
iable numbers of lipoblasts, including pleomorphic forms. Most tu-
mours(21/39, 53.8%) displayed lipoblastic differentiation, followed by
pleomorphic sarcomatous(n=15), myxofibrosarcoma-like(n=5) and
epithelioid(n=8) type. Other patterns were hibernoma-like,
hemangiopericytoma-like and rhabdoid-like. Immunohistochemically, tu-
mour cells were positive for S100P(17/24,71%), CD34(5/13), AE1/
AE3(2/11) and SMA(5/13). Therapeutically(n=32),most patients(11,34%)
underwent surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy. Eleven pa-
tients(34.4%) developed recurrences and 16(50%) developed metastases.
Median disease-free survival(DFS) was 10.5 months. Estimated 5-year
DFS was 20.2% and estimated 5-year overall survival rate was 66.9%.
Conclusion: This constitutes the first study from our country describing a
wide clinicopathological spectrum of PLPS. Classical histopathology re-
mains its diagnostic gold standard. DDLPS and other pleomorphic sar-
comas are close differential diagnoses. Surgical excision was treatment-
mainstay with adjuvant radiotherapy, in large-sized tumours. Certain clin-
icopathological features, such as larger T-size (exceeding 8 cm) and ep-
ithelioid morphology were associated with recurrences and metastasis.

*Department of Pathology and Laboratory Diagnostics, Maria
Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, Warsaw,
Poland
Background & objectives: Fibrous histiocytoma (FH) is usually a be-
nign, small lesion, treated with surgical excision. We present a case report
of an extraordinary example of a giant, relapsing fibrohistiocytic tumour
with the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSqCC) in
its vicinity.
Methods: The 63-year-old male with a 15-year history of a back tumour,
irradiated (50Gy) and diagnosed as FH on excision biopsy, reported 5
years later with a relapse. The tumour was re-excised. Macroscopic eval-
uation revealed a well demarcated lesion measuring 10.5x17x2.1cm
centred in the subcutis. There was epidermal ulceration (8cm in diameter)
with distinct infiltration underneath spreading directly into the tumour.
Results: Histologically, the recurrence was composed of mildly-atypical
spindle cells forming short intersecting fascicles and histiocyte-like cells
admixed with numerous foamy cells. The lesion’s stroma was collage-
nous with stag-horn vasculature. A well-formed storiform pattern was
focally present. Mitoses were rare (3/50 HPF). Necrosis was absent.
The neoplastic cells showed diffused, strong staining for CD31 and
CD68, and were negative for CKAE1/AE3, ERG, CD34 and SOX100.
There was no COL1A1-PDGFB rearrangement in FISH analysis,
excluding dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Evaluation of the ulcerated
lesion revealed an infiltration of well-differentiated keratinizing cSqCC
intimately intermixed with the fibrohistiocytic neoplasm. Mark epidermal
hyperplasia next to the cSqCC origin was clearly visible.
Conclusion: The coexistence of a rare example of a giant fibrous
histiocytoma and cSqCC in its immediate vicinity, has been reported
poorly so far. The development of tumours following radiotherapy is
commonly observed. However, short interval between radiotherapy and
carcinoma occurrence (ca. 5 years) is quite unusual for the therapy-related
tumourigenesis. It raises a question about a possible induction of cSqCC
by a long-standing fibrous histiocytoma and is another reason to recom-
mend an excision of fibrohistiocytic tumours, instead of their irradiation.

Differential immunohistochemical expression of SLUG and ALDH1
in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) and
monophasic synovial sarcoma (MSS)
A. Kavuncuoglu, K. Kösemehmetoğlu*
*Department of Pathology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine,
Turkey
Background & objectives: ALDH1 is a mesenchymal stem cell marker
indicating nerve sheath differentiation in neoplasia. SLUG is an
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor, involved
in MSS pathogenesis. We investigated the diagnostic potential of
ALDH1 and SLUG in the problematic MPNST-MSS differential.
Methods: Slides of 4-mm tissue microarrays from MPNST (n=22) and
MSS (n=21) were stained for anti-SLUG (Novus, 1:150) and anti-
ALDH1 (BD, 1:1000). Any cytoplasmic-nuclear staining for ALDH1
was evaluated as positive, whereas total loss of nuclear SLUG expression
was negative.
Results: For the diagnosis of MPNST over MSS, sensitivity and speci-
ficity of ALDH1 were %59,1 and %90,5, respectively, while the loss of
SLUG expression had a sensitivity of %52,4 and a specificity of %85.
When these two markers are combined, the specificity of SLUG-/
ALDH1+ phenotype for MPNST raised to %100 at the expense of sen-
sitivity, which dropped to %35.
Conclusion: S100, SOX10, and loss of H3K27me2/3 are used in routine
practice for the diagnosis of MPNST with limited sensitivity and speci-
ficity. When used in differential diagnosis with MSS, ALDH1 and SLUG
have also limited sensitivity like conventional markers; however, the
SLUG-/ALDH1+ combination has a high specificity for MPNST.

Solitary fibrous tumour of the orbital cavity: a case series with his-
topathologic and clinicopathologic evaluation

*Izmir Katip Celebi University Ataturk Training and Research Hospital,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Solitary fibrous tumour is a fibroblastic tu-
mour which is rarely encountered in the orbit. Our aim in this study is to
retrospectively describe the clinical and histopathological characteristics,
outcomes of 4 patients with solitary fibrous tumour (SFT) of the orbit.
Methods: A retrospective, noncomparative review of a series of patients
treated at a single institution with histopathologic diagnosis of SFT.
Demographic, clinical, and imaging data were collected. Paraffin-
embedded tissue sections were evaluated for the histopathological
characteristics.
Results: Four patients were identified with mean age of 36,2. Computed
tomography revealed well-circumscribed, contrast-enhancing lesions
Virchows Arch
with cystic and solid features for 3 of the cases. Two patients had local
recurrence. No metastatic disease or tumour-related death were observed.
Tumours were located in the nasolacrimal gland and temporoorbital bone.
Mean tumour size was 2,8 cm. Tumour borders, cellularity, pleomor-
phism, necrosis, hemorrhagia, and mitosis count were evaluated on tissue
sections. Of the cases: 2 had infiltrative borders, 2 had increased cellular-
ity, 2 showed moderate pleomorphism, 1 had necrosis, and 4 had
hemorrhagia. As the immunohistochemical stain evaluation, all cases
were positive with CD34, vimentin, and STAT6.
Conclusion: Solitary fibrous tumours are rare to encounter in the orbital
cavity. These tumours should be differentiated from other spindle cell,
mesenchymal neoplasms of the orbit since SFT has an unpredictable
tumour behaviour. Therefore, histopathological and clinical features are
useful for the diagnosis and follow-up of the patients.

Background & objectives: Enchondroma and chondrosarcoma are car-
tilaginous matrix-producing tumours with distinct biological behaviour.
There are histological similarity between enchondroma and low-grade
chondrosarcoma that can make their distinction a challenge. This work
evaluates the role of Amphiregulin protein in enchondromas and central
chondrosarcomas.
Methods: This was a retrospective study of 31 enchondromas and 67
central chondrosarcomas, diagnosed in the Department of Pathology
(State University of Campinas) from 1994 to 2019. Clinical data (age,
sex, location, type of bone affected and follow-up information) were
retrieved from medical files. This work analyses the immunoexpression
of Amphiregulin in cartilaginous tumours.
Results: Amphiregulin was positive in 15 of the 31 enchondromas
(48.40%) and in 24 of the 67 chondrosarcomas (35.82%). There was no
difference in the expression of Amphiregulin between enchondromas and
low-grade chondrosarcomas. Amphiregulin was positive in 39 lesions (16
in short bones; 13 in long bones and 10 in flat bones), with a higher
percentage of positive cells (p = 0.0030) and intensity of immunohisto-
chemical expression (p = 0.0055) in short bone lesions. Among the 25
enchondromas localized in short bones, 60.00% expressed Amphiregulin;
whereas all of the 06 cases localized in long bones were negative for this
marker (p = 0.0177).
Conclusion: Amphiregulin was not found to be useful in distinguishing
enchondroma from low-grade chondrosarcoma. This is the first study to
document the expression of this immunohistochemical marker in
enchondromas. Its particular expression in enchondromas localized in
short bones demonstrates a phenotypic distinction from those in long
bones. Therefore, this phenotypic difference may contribute to a better
understanding of the pathogenesis of these lesions.

*University of Florence, Italy
Background & objectives: The aim of our study was to detect NTRK
fusions in a cohort of paediatric undifferentiated round cell sarcomas
(URCS), after a systematic review of the diagnosis, according to the
new WHO Classification of Soft Tissue Tumours and Bone.
Methods: 105 patients (age range, 1-21 years), with diagnosis of a round
cell sarcoma involving the bone or soft tissue were retrospectively eval-
uated. Pan-Trk immunohistochemistry testing was performed on
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Tumour RNA was extracted
and subjected to next-generation-sequencing (NGS) library preparation,
using a 10-gene fusion panel, sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. NGS-
positive cases were confirmed by real-time PCR.
Results: After the morphological, immunophenotypical and molecular
review, the cohort was predominately composed of Ewing sarcoma
(96), additionally EWSR1-non-ETS round cell sarcoma (3), sarcoma with
BCOR genetic alteration (1) and undifferentiated round cell sarcomas (5).
On immunohistochemical screening, 12/105 (11.4%) cases were positive
using the pan-Trk antibody, including 9 Ewing sarcomas, 2 undifferenti-
ated round cell sarcomas and 1 sarcoma with BCOR genetic alteration,
showing three different staining patterns, with the cytoplasmic distribu-
tion being most common. Upon RNA extraction and quantification, 10 of
the 12 cases were suitable for sequencing. Molecular analysis using NGS
and confirmed by the real-rime PCR detected two undifferentiated round
cell sarcomas cases positive for ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.
Conclusion: URCS do not belong to the group of tumours with a high
prevalence of NTRK gene fusions, despite an IHC positive rate of 11% in
our study. This result is consistent with previous works performed on
other cancer types sharing similar histologic features with Ewing sarcoma
and it confirms the fundamental role of a molecular analysis following the
IHC screening. Further investigations are also needed to better explore the
possible coexistence of NTRK and other gene rearrangements in URCS.

Extra-skeletal osteosarcomas: a clinicopathologic study of 9 cases
E. Ozgur*, S. Sevim, S. Yuksel, H. Berber, G. Kaygusuz
*Ankara Uni. Faculty of Medicine, Turkey
Background & objectives: Extra-skeletal osteosarcomas are very rare soft
tissue tumours. It accounts for 1% of soft tissue sarcomas. In this study, we
aimed to share our practice about this unique entity with evaluation of
clinical and histopathological features of extra-skeletal osteosarcomas.
Methods: A follow-up investigation of 9 cases of extra-skeletal osteosar-
comas diagnosed at the Department of Pathology, Ankara University
School of Medicine, Turkey, in the period from 2005-2021 was under-
taken. The clinicopathological features of the patients including age, gen-
der, tumour localization, tumour size, clinical presentation and histopath-
ological findings were recorded.
Results: Among our cases, 4 of them were female and 5 were male with a
mean age of 56.4 (49-68 years). Only 2 of 9 cases were localized in the
soft tissue of the upper extremity. 7 cases were located in the lower
extremities. Mean size of tumours was measured as 10.6cm (4-30cm).
Macroscopically all of the tumours had irregular borders. 7 of 9 cases
showed solid pattern whereas cystic component was observed only in 2
cases. Histopathologically, the tumour consisted of a spindle or round-
shaped cells with pleomorphism in all cases. Mitosis, diffuse-focal necro-
sis and osteoid formation were common. During the follow-up period 7
cases (77%) had developed lung metastasis.
Conclusion: Extra-skeletal osteosarcomas are rare, high-grade malignan-
cies that usually metastasize to the lungs and bones. Accurate diagnosis is
difficult due to the rarity of the tumour and the lack of specific clinical
features.

syndrome

*Department of Pathology of Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São
João, Portugal
Background & objectives: Pleomorphic myxoid liposarcoma (PML) is
an exceptionally rare entity recently recognized by the WHO classifica-
tion. It occurs almost exclusively in children and might be associated with
Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). We report a case and review the literature.
Methods: A 5-year-old girl with previous history of choroid plexus car-
cinoma diagnosed at 3 months of age, presented with a dorsal swelling.
Ultrasonography displayed a 46mm-sized expansive, hypoechoic and
hypervascular soft-tissue mass involving the right scapular muscles.
After multidisciplinary discussion, a wide surgical excision of the lesion
was performed.
Results: Grossly, the mass was well-demarcated with a solid, tan-red cut
surface surrounded by adipose tissue. Histology revealed a myxoid tumour,
with hypo and hypercellular areas, exhibiting a prominent branching cap-
illary network, lipoblasts and mostly bland oval-to-spindle-shaped cells
with scattered pleomorphic cells. Mitotic figures were seen (5mitosis/
10HPF) and no necrosis was found. S100 protein highlighted lipoblasts.
No FUS/EWSR1-DDIT3 gene fusions or MDM 2 amplification was de-
tected by FISH studies. A diagnosis of PML (high grade sarcoma) was
rendered. The occurrence of a second primary cancer led to identification of
a pathogenic germline mutation in TP53, consistent with LFS. Subsequent
staging work-up found no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease.
Conclusion: PML is a rare distinct subtype of liposarcoma (only 26 cases
reported to date) showing mixed histological features of conventional
myxoid liposarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma with no specific cy-
togenetic signatures. Besides poorly studied, it is probably an under-
recognized entity, therefore its prevalence and association with LFS
might be underestimated. To our knowledge, this is the fifth and the
youngest documented case of PML associated with LFS, a hereditable
cancer disorder with impact on oncologic treatment decisions and post-
operative surveillance.

*Department of Anatomic Pathology of Faculty of Medicine Universitas
Brawijaya, Syaiful Anwar General Hospital, Indonesia
Background & objectives: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) for bone tu-
mours is not a widely-used procedure in Indonesia, mostly performed at
large centres. We aim to review FNA for bone tumours at our centre to
inform local practice.
Methods: A retrospective study of FNA for bone tumours at the
Department of Anatomic Pathology of Saiful Anwar General Hospital
Malang, East Java was conducted. FNA reports for bone tumour cases
diagnosed within a 4-year period (January 2015 - December 2018) were
obtained and reviewed. The cytology findings were compared with the
available histopathological results.
Results: A total of 187 FNA reports for bone tumours were retrieved, 93
were males (49.73%) and 94 were females (50.27%), with a mean age of
34.10 + 26.87 years old and a median age of 31 years old. Inadequate
specimens were found in 6 cases (3.21%). The most common site for
FNA was in the lower extremity (n=135; 72.19%). Neoplastic cases were
more prevalent than non-neoplastic cases (90.91% vs 5.88%).
Malignancies predominated the neoplastic cases (n=141; 82.94%).
Further histopathological examinations were performed in 37 cases
(20.44%); among these cases, the accuracy of FNA in determining the
benignity/malignancy and the specific histological type were 97.30%
(n=36) and 91.89% (n=34), respectively.
Conclusion: Wider utilization of FNA for the diagnosis of bone tumours
(especially in smaller centres and underserved areas) is encouraged due to
its ease of use, cost-effectiveness, and diagnostic accuracy. Clinico-
Pathological Conference (CPC) in our centre plays a key role in further
improving the diagnostic accuracy of FNA for bone tumours, as it corre-
lates the clinical, radiological, cytological, and histopathological findings.
CPC is particularly beneficial in resource-limited settings, where com-
plete immunohistochemical markers or other advanced diagnostic modal-
ities are unavailable.

Dedifferentiated solitary fibrous tumour with heterologous elements:
two cases of a rare entity
F. Rosa*, E. Dvindenko, F. Santos, R. Cabrera
*Instituto Português de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Portugal
Background & objectives: Solitary fibrous tumour (SFT) is a fibroblas-
tic neoplasm featuring a typical staghorn vascular pattern and NAB2-
STAT6 gene rearrangement. Dedifferentiation has been described as a
rare phenomenon in SFT, comprising an abrupt transition between classic
SFT morphology and a high-grade sarcoma.
Methods: We describe two cases of dedifferentiated SFT (DSFT) with
heterologous elements, drawing attention to the additional diagnostic
challenge it imposes, with a review of the literature.
Results: Case 1 refers to a 67-year-old man presenting with a 30 cm
pelvic mass and case 2 refers to a 54-year-old woman with an 8 cm
cervical posterior mass. Microscopically, the tumours were mainly com-
prised of typical areas of SFT, showing diffuse immunoexpression of
CD34 and STAT6, juxtaposed to areas of a high-grade sarcoma showing
osteosarcomatous differentiation and SATB2 positivity, with loss of
CD34 and STAT6. In both cases, a diagnosis of DSFT with
osteosarcomatous differentiation was rendered. Patient 1 is alive and
disease-free 1-year after surgery, with no adjuvant therapy. Patient 2
had adjuvant radio and chemotherapy, with disease progression and lung
metastasis at 6-months of follow-up.
Conclusion: DSFT has only recently been described and its rare occur-
rence limits our awareness of this entity. As in other mesenchymal tu-
mours, the presence of a conventional area of SFT is the key for the
diagnosis and the presence of a high-grade sarcoma with or without
heterologous elements is now recognised as part of an expanded
histomorphological range of SFT features. Although dedifferentiation
poses higher risk of recurrence and/or metastasis, literature is still scarce
about clinical outcomes.

Myositis ossificans: 3 case reports of this benign and challenging
entity.
F. Sassi*, K. Fatma, R. Jouini, I. Helal, E. Ben Brahim, A. Chadli
Debbiche, S. Sassi
*Department of Pathology, Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Myositis ossificans (MO) is a benign mes-
enchymal disorder characterized by the formation of heterotopic bone in
soft tissues. MO progresses through parallel radiographic, clinical, and
histopathologic stages or zonal patterns. We aim to describe clinical and
pathological findings of MO.
Methods: It was a retrospective study of 3 cases. There were 2 men and
one woman with a mean age of 19.3 years ranging from 7 to 30 years with
no history of trauma. Symptoms consisted in pain, joint stiffness and
swelling involving the thigh in 2 cases and the buttock in one case. All
cases were diagnosed by surgical biopsy.
Results: Microscopically, all specimen showed a zonal architecture com-
posed of a central, intermediate and mature zone. Central zone was com-
posed of variably sized capillary network with proliferating fibroblastic
tissue with mild cellular pleomorphism and mitotic activity. Intermediate
zone showed areas of immature woven bone mixed with fibroblastic tissue
surrounded by peripheral areas of bone forming osteoblastic elements and
Virchows Arch
cartilage. Stroma was myxoid in one case with collagenous vascular and
oedematous areas infiltrated by sparse chronic inflammatory cells. No re-
verse zoning pattern was observed which ruled out the main differential
diagnosis of an extra osseous osteosarcoma. All patients underwent surgical
resection with no recurrence after 6 months follow-up.
Conclusion: MO is a benign entity occurring in young male adults, usually
after trauma. This condition, when not related to trauma, is challenging for
the pathologist as it can mimic a malignant neoplasm or an inflammatory
disease. MO is also a dynamic phenomenon as the clinical, imaging and
microscopic findings keep of changing as the stages advance. Accurate
diagnosis of these tumours is imperative to ensure optimal therapy.

Epithelioid haemangioendothelioma: report of a case with aggressive
clinical behaviour
J. Vaz Silva*, D. Gigliano, A. Coutada, J. Azevedo, R. Isidoro, J. Vaz
Silva, C. Leal, M. Afonso
*Pathology Department, Portuguese Institute of Oncology - Porto FG,
EPE (IPO-Porto), Portugal
Background & objectives: Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is
a rare malignant vascular tumour, with a highly variable clinical course
and overlapping features with angiosarcoma and haemangioma.
Prognosis varies with anatomical site and genetic abnormalities.
Diagnosis and therapeutic selection can be challenging.
Methods: 57-year-old woman presenting with cough and fatigue. CT and
PET scans revealed a large pulmonary mass on the upper right lobe, with
mediastinal invasion, pleural effusion, and nodular lesions on the contra-
lateral upper lobe.
Lung and mediastinal biopsies confirmed the presence of a malignant
vascular tumour, raising the differential diagnosis between EHE and
angiosarcoma.
Patient underwent palliative chemotherapy with doxorubicin.
Results: At 9-months of follow-up, clinical examination detected in-
creased breast volume. PET-scan reported stability of the lung mass and
de novo metabolic activity in breast and anterior chest wall.
Breast biopsy showed extensive parenchymal infiltration by malignant
neoplasm, composed of epithelioid cells, with abundant basophilic cyto-
plasm, often with intracellular lumina. Neoplastic cells were arranged in
trabeculae, small aggregates or forming vascular spaces, within a myxoid-
hyaline stroma. Mitotic figures were present, and necrosis was absent.
Immunohistochemistry revealed positivity for CD31, ERG1, FLI1 and
D2-40 and negativity for CD34, cytokeratins, ER, PR and HER-2. FISH
analysis detected a WWTR1 gene rearrangement, allowing the definitive
diagnosis of EHE.
Patient initiated paclitaxel therapy.
Conclusion: At 12-months of follow-up, PET-scan confirmed disease
progression with lymph node, lung, pleura, bone, breast and muscle me-
tastasis, prompting treatment with panzopanib. The patient passed away
at 14-months of follow-up.
Despite being historically considered a low-grade vascular tumour, EHE
can display an aggressive behaviour similar to angiosarcoma. A conclu-
sive differential diagnosis between these two entities can be made by
genetic analysis. Further studies may allow for targeted therapies in the
future.

R. Ayadi*, E. Braham, M. Mlika, F. Sassi, S. Ben Cheikh, A. Ayadi, O.
Ismail, F. El Mezni
*Hôpital Abderrahmane Mami de Pneumo, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Mature cystic teratomas of the thymus
(MCTT) are a rare phenomenon. They account only 8% of all tumours
in the mediastinum. The aim was to describe the clinicopathological
characteristics and discuss the differential diagnosis of this disease.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 11 cases of MCTT
diagnosed at our department, between 2004 and 2020.
Results: Our series included 6 male and 5 female patients. Mean age was
33,81 years old. All patients underwent a surgical resection. On gross
examination, mean size of the masses was 11,7 cm. The outer surface
was smooth and tan-white, and the cut inner surface contained multiple
cystic structures filled with a tanbrown greasy substance and a few strands
of hair. Microscopy showed variable mature elements comprising of cysts
lined by ciliated pseudo stratified epithelium and secretory epithelium.
Other mature elements seen were intestinal mucosa, sebaceous glands,
smooth muscle, adipose tissue, hair follicles, cartilage and pancreatic
tissue. The cyst wall was fibrous with hyalinised areas. There was no
evidence of immature, neuroepithelial elements.
Conclusion: Mature teratomas of the mediastinum are rare tumours but
should be considered in the differential diagnoses for mediastinal anterior
lesion, include: thymoma, lymphoma, carcinoma, thyroid disease and
aortic aneurysm. Complete surgical resection is recommended in all ma-
ture teratomas with favourable survival rates.

Posterior mediastinal paragangliomas: report of 6 cases
R. Ayadi*, E. Braham, M. Mlika, F. Sassi, S. Ben Cheikh, A. Ayadi, O.
Ismail, F. El Mezni
*Hôpital Abderrahmane Mami de Pneumo, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Mediastinal paragangliomas are rare neuro-
endocrine neoplasms that originate from chromaffin cells, representing
less than 0.3% of mediastinal tumours and less than 2% of all
paragangliomas. The aim was to describe histopathological and immuno-
histochemical features of mediastinal paragangliomas with literature
review.
Methods: We report a retrospective study of 6 cases of mediastinal
paraganglioma diagnosed at our department between 2004 and 2020.
Results: There were one male and five female. Mean age was 45 years
old. All patients underwent a surgical resection. On gross examination,
mean size of the masses was 7, 9 cm. They were firm well circumscribed
tumours with yellow-brownish cut surface. Microscopically, they were
composed of chief cells arranged in nests that are surrounded by an
inconspicuous single layer of spindle-shaped cells called sustentacular
cells. Immunohistochemically, the chief cells were positive for
chromogranin and synaptophysin and sustentacular cells were positive
for PS100. The postoperative course was uneventful in all patients. No
patient required additional treatment postoperatively, and neither recur-
rence nor distant metastases were noted during follow up.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of mediastinal paraganglioma is based on
histology, which is unreliable in predicting malignancy, making lifelong
follow up after surgical resection mandatory.

Mediastinal granulomatous lymphadenitis may not be in initial clin-
ical diagnosis but should be in pathologist’s differential diagnosis
B. Keskin*, E. Bozkurtlar
*Marmara University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Mediastinal lymph node(MLN) sampling is
a widely preferred diagnostic method for staging of lung malignancies
and diagnosis of lymphoproliferative or granulomatous diseases.
Preliminary-certain diagnoses and evaluation of clinical diagnosis after
sampling and their relationships constitute the aim of our study.
Methods: We documented MLN biopsies examined in our department
between 2012 and 2021. We excluded specimens which was including
Virchows Arch
tissues and/organs other than MLN simultaneously. We analysed the
demographic data, biopsy diagnoses, former and follow-up clinical his-
tory of patients from the hospital information system.
Results: Total 331 patients with MLN samples were eveluated,
253(76,4%) of 331 negative for malignancy, 100(39,5%) of 253 with
granuloma were detected, 11 of 100 had also caseating necrotizing, 49
of 100 had known clinical initial diagnoses. Clinicians were suspicious
for at least one granulomatous disease in 29(59%) of patients with gran-
uloma histopathologically proved. The rest 20(41%) of 49 underwent
cytological sampling or mediastinoscopy for mediastinal staging for lung
carcinoma. Only 23 of 100 had history of a certain disease;17 malignan-
cy, 4 autoimmune disease and 2 tuberculosis. The clinical history of
sarcoid patients were 3 autoimmune diseases,2 lymphomas and 2 carci-
nomas. There were 10 carcinomas,2 tuberculosis and 1 autoimmune dis-
eases in clinical history of patients diagnosed as tuberculosis.
Conclusion: The overall incidence of granulomatous inflammation of
MLN samples is 30,2% in our seria. Clinicians may be suspicious for
granulomatous diseases, but 41% of our cases were diagnosed as granu-
lomatous lymphadenitis without any initial clinical diagnosis or suspi-
cion. When we compare the cases of sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, a
history of autoimmune disease or lymphoma may be a hint of sarcoidosis
in terms of differential diagnosis.

Distribution and clinical correlation of malignant infiltrations of me-
diastinal lymph nodes (MLNs)
E. Bozkurtlar, B. Keskin*
*Marmara University, Turkey
Background & objectives: MLNs are the most common metastatic tar-
gets of lung cancer and other malignant tumours. Mediastinoscopy or
EBUS guided cytological sampling of MLNs is helpful for clinicians to
make better diagnosis and treatment decisions. We aimed to determine
malignancy distribution in MLNs.
Methods: We documented MLN biopsies examined in our department
between 2012 and 2021. We excluded specimens which was including
tissues and/organs other than MLN simultaneously. We analysed the
demographic data, biopsy diagnoses, former and follow-up clinical his-
tory of patients from the hospital information system.
Results: The percentage of malignant infiltration of MLNs in 331 pa-
tients was 23,5%(n=78). Distribution of malignancies found in MLNs
was 45(57,6%) non-small cell lung carcinoma(NSCLC),11(14%)small
cell and large neuroendocrine carcinoma,11 (14%) lymphoid malignancy
and 11(14%) primary tumours other than lung.45(57,6%) of 78 had in-
formation of clinical suspicion for any disease.43 of 45 underwent medi-
astinal sampling for either staging and/or diagnosis of malignancy.
Diagnoses of two patients with previously known malignancy were un-
expected, one patient with history of lymphoma diagnosed as NSCLC
and, other with history of colonic adenocarcinoma diagnosed as lympho-
ma. The rest two patients with preliminary diagnosis were evaluated for
tuberculosis and/or lymphoma by clinicians. Both of these two patients
were diagnosed as NSCLC.
Conclusion: The incidence of malignant infiltration of MLNs is 23,5% in
our seria. Pulmonary carcinoma (71,7%) is the most common primary
malignancy for our metastatic MLNs. Lymphoma involvement is seen
14% of our patients. Four of 45 cases, there are unexpected diagnoses,
either new intercurrent malignancies as NSCLC and lymphoma or un-
foreseen carcinomas as NSCLC while waiting for diagnosis of tubercu-
losis clinically.

Evaluation of PROX-1 expression in thymic epithelial tumours
C. Masaoutis*, A. Pergaris, P. Sarantis, D. Rontogianni, S. Theocharis
*First Department of Pathology, Medical School, National and
Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: Thymic epithelial tumours (TETs) are pri-
mary anterior mediastinal neoplasms. PROX-1 is a member of the ho-
meobox transcription factor family with lymphangiogenic and angiogenic
properties, and a central role in carcinogenesis. The clinical significance
of PROX-1 expression was determined in TETs.
Methods: Tissue microarrays were constructed out of 95 TETs (11 type
A, 21 type AB, 17 type B1, 18 type B2, 13 type B3, 2 micronodular
thymomas, 13 thymic carcinomas) and immunohistochemically stained
for PROX-1. Cases were classified as H-score-high or H-score-low using
the H-score average as the cut-off. Pearson’s chi-square test was applied
for statistical analysis.
Results: There was epithelial nuclear expression of PROX-1 in 17/95
cases. The H-score ranged between 0 and 120. The lymphocytic compo-
nent was negative for PROX-1. Higher expression of PROX-1 was more
common in B3 thymomas (30.7%) and thymic carcinomas (46.1%), less
common in type B1 (11.7%) and type A (9%) thymomas, and rare in
other subtypes (0-4.7%) [p=0.006]. The average H-score was 22 (range:
0-120) in thymic carcinomas and 13 (range: 0-90) in B3 thymomas. No
correlation with gender, Masaoka stage, margin status, myasthenia gravis
or other autoimmune manifestations was seen.
Conclusion: PROX-1 is expressed in TETs and its expression levels
correlate with the more aggressive tumour subtypes B3 thymoma and
thymic carcinoma.

Neuroblastic mediastinal tumours: a retrospective study about 23
cases
M. Mlika*, F. Sassi, M. Abdennadher, R. Ayadi, O. Ismail, F. Mezni
*Abderrahman mami hospital, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Neuroblastic tumours of the mediastinum are
rare and heterogeneous. Our aim was to describe the clinical and micro-
scopic features of these tumours.
Methods: We describe a retrospective study about mediastinal
neuroblastic tumours diagnosed over a 25-year-period
Results: 23 neuroblastic tumours were diagnosed during the period of
study. They consisted in 20 ganglioneuromas, 2 neuroblastomas and 1
ganglioneuroblastoma. The mean age of the patients was 29 years. They
consisted in 5 men and 18 women. The most frequent symptoms
consisted in chest pain. The diagnoses were made on biopsic samples in
2 cases and surgical specimen in 21 cases. Histoprognostic classification
of neuroblastomas concluded to a poor prognostic group. The treatment
was surgical in 21 cases. The survival of the 2 neuroblastomas was 3
months. 2 patients with neuroblastomas died after 6 months.
Conclusion: Mediastinal neuroblastic tumours are rare. The diagnosis
necessitates a narrow collaboration between clinicians, radiologists and
surgeons. They may cause a therapeutic challenge especially in immature
tumours.

Domínguez de Dios, J. González-Carreró Fojón, J.A. Ortiz-Rey
*SERGAS- Hospital Álvaro Cunqueiro, Spain
Background & objectives: SATB2 positivity, usually found in intestinal
adenocarcinomas, has been reported in some renal cell carcinomas.
Nephrogenic adenoma (NA) is a renal tubular cell metaplasia with het-
erogeneous architecture, that may simulate malignancy. We have inves-
tigated the expression of SATB2 in NAs.
Virchows Arch
Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin sections of 42 NAs cases were immu-
nostained for SATB2, using an enzyme-conjugated multimer complex
(OptiView, Ventana) with a rabbit monoclonal antibody (clone EP281,
prediluted, Cell Marque). The intensity of the staining was evaluated as
negative (-); or weak (+), moderate (++) or strong (+++) positivity; and
the extent as focal (<50% of the cells) or diffuse (≥50%).
Results: The main location of the NAs was the bladder, except 6 in
prostatic urethra, and 1 in renal pelvis. The most frequent sample was
transurethral resection of the bladder. All of the cases presented mixed
papillary and tubulocystic architectures, outstanding 11 cases with flat
areas, 1 associated with intestinal metaplasia, and 4 with signet-ring cell
like areas. SATB2 staining was positive in 22 cases (52 %), being focal in
13 cases (2 weak/ 6 moderate/ 5 strong) and diffuse in 9 (4 moderate/ 5
strong). Differences in the staining pattern according to architecture were
seen, with microcystic areas prone to show strong and diffuse staining
versus papillary or flat ones.
Conclusion: SATB2 is commonly expressed in NA, occurring in more
than 50% of our cases, with diffuse staining in 41% and focal in 59% of
them. This immunoreactivity should be kept in mind in order to avoid
misdiagnosis, specially when dealing with variants of NA such as
microcystic or signet-ring cell like patterns. These histological features
and the possible SATB2 positivity can difficult the differential diagnosis

Kingdom
Background & objectives: Increased Tumour Infiltrating Lymphocytes
(TIL) numbers is associated with improved survival in Human Papilloma
Virus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal carcinomas. Our objective was to
determine if TIL grade is associated with HPV-status and whether grad-
ing TILs stratifies survival rates in penile carcinoma.
Methods: We identified a retrospective cohort of 126 patients with penile
carcinoma over a 10 year period. Chi squared tests were performed to
look for correlations between TIL grade, TNM8 staging and HPV-status,
or HPV-status and pathological grade and stage. The prognostic signifi-
cance of TIL grade for overall survival was investigated using Kaplan-
Meier Survival curves.
Results: HPV-status was not associated with pT stage, nodal status, his-
tological grade or TIL grade in our dataset. TIL grade showed no associ-
ation with pT stage (p=0.22) or nodal status (p=0.776). Deaths by TIL
Grade group were as follows: 17/42 (40.5%) in TIL Grade1, 21/51
(41.2%) in TIL Grade2 and 5/27 (18.5%) in TIL Grade3, however the
Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis did not show a significant difference
between the survival curves when all three groups were compared
(p=0.118, Log rank test). Interestingly, the difference in overall survival
between the TIL2 and TIL3 Kaplan-Meier curves was close to statistical
significance (p=0.053; Log rank test).
Conclusion: TIL grading showed no statistically significant association
with traditional pathologic prognostic measures and did not stratify pa-
tients from our dataset by overall survival. Future research could explore
TIL subtypes as some evidence suggests that this may be of relevance and
could enhance our understanding of potential immunotherapeutic targets
for penile carcinoma.

Renal oncocytosis: institutional retrospective review of clinical and
pathological features in eight cases
M. Bronte*, Y. Rodriguez, J. Arredondo, C. Cerezo, C. Fuertes, R.
Guarch, A. Panizo
*Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: Renal oncocytosis is an extremely rare dis-
ease. It is characterized by the presence of one/several renal masses
(oncocytomas) along with oncocytic changes in the renal parenchyma.
We report the clinical-pathologic features found in our hospital related to
this disease.
Methods: We reviewed the computerized health records and the slides of
paraffin-embedded tissue preparations of eight patients with histological
diagnosis of renal oncocytosis in our hospital between January 2010 and
December 2020. Pulmonary and/or cutaneous history, type of surgery,
renal tumour pathology and testing for genetic abnormalities are
described.
Results: Eight patients were males and the median age at diagnosis was
68 years (55-79). One patient underwent prior radical nephrectomy for
chromophobe carcinoma and along with another patient had a history of
non-specific pulmonary nodules. They underwent genetic evaluation
dismissing Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. The remaining patients had no
history of cutaneous/lung lesions. Renal masses were identified by imag-
ing, except for one patient with bilateral tumours detected incidentally at
autopsy. Among the 7 patients with unilateral tumours, 5 had partial
nephrectomies. Each kidney contained a dominant mass and multiple
tumours varying in size (5-0.8 cms). They had histologic features of
oncocytoma associated with oncocytosis. Two patients died during fol-
low-up.
Conclusion: Patients with renal oncocytosis usually present with multi-
ple and bilateral renal nodules. The diagnosis of renal oncocytosis re-
quires a thorough histological examination. The use of immunohisto-
chemical techniques is useful to verify the diagnosis. In case of confir-
mation of the diagnostic suspicion, it is advisable to carry out a genetic
study to rule out a hereditary origin of the disease.

High-grade oncocytic renal tumour (HOT) - a case report of a novel
entity
A.R. Coelho*, R. Silva
*Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João, Portugal
Background & objectives: Continuous development regarding renal
tumours results in the emergence of new entities with distinctive morpho-
logical, immunohistochemical, molecular, epidemiological and clinical
features. HOT has been recently described in this context. We herein
report a case of this new entity.
Methods: A 51-year-old male, with no relevant medical history and no
genitourinary symptoms, was observed in the outpatient clinic of our
institution due to a 20mm tumour found in the inferior pole of the left
kidney during a routine ultrasound. On contrast-enhanced computed to-
mography scan the tumour was classified as Bosniak III category. A
partial nephrectomy was performed.
Results: The cut surface revealed a solid, well circumscribed, non-
encapsulated tumour, with expansive borders and 23mm in greatest di-
mension. On histological examination the tumour was composed of a
proliferation of small nests and tubules. Tumour cells had eosinophilic
to pale cytoplasm, frequent intracytoplasmic vacuoles and enlarged round
nuclei with conspicuous nucleoli (high-grade features). Central oedema
and thick walled vessels were notable features. There was no vascular
invasion, necrosis or sarcomatoid differentiation. Immunohistochemical
panel showed diffuse positivity for CK8/18, PAX8, CD10, CD117 and
cathepsin K. CK7 was positive only in scattered cells. The TFE3 stain
was negative and SDHB expression was preserved. These findings were
consistent with the diagnosis of HOT.
Conclusion: HOT has similarities with other types of oncocytic tumours,
like chromophobe RCC, oncocytoma or “hybrid” oncocytic tumours, but
morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics are inconsistent
with these diagnosis, and therefore it is important to recognise it as a
Virchows Arch
distinct entity. Despite the high-grade cytology and limited follow-up
time on reported cases, behaviour seems indolent. Hence it is important
for pathologists to recognise and promote awareness of this emerging
entity in order to improve diagnostic accuracy and ultimately optimize
clinical management.

Matrix metalloproteinases correlates with aggresive behaviour of
prostate adenocarcinoma but not with Gleason score
L. Cristina*, C. Popp, M. Cioplea, G. Tudor, D. Raduta, S.A. Stanciu, L.
Nichita
*Colentina University Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: MMP2 and MMP9 are gelastinases impli-
cated in progression and metastases of different tumours. MMP2 has
proteolytic actions and activate another major gelatinase called MMP9
involved in degradation of extracellular matrix, tumour angiogenesis and
invasion.
Methods: We analysed 21 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma with peri-
neural invasion (PnI) and 27 cases without PnI. In areas of maximal
angiogenesis, CD34 positive microvessels were counted and divided in
2 groups. MMP2 and MMP9 expressions were evaluated according to
percentage scale (0<10%, 10-50%, >50%). MMP2, MMP9 and
microvessel density were correlated with Gleason score and PnI.
Results: MMP-2 and MMP-9 immunoexpression in tumour cells was
cytoplasmic, finely granular, and varied in intensity and percentage.
MMP-2 was significantly more strongly expressed in tumours with PnI.
Regarding Gleason score, no significant differences between low Gleason
score (<7) and high-grade cancer (Gleason score >7) was found in ex-
pression of MMP2 and MMP9. MVD was higher in prostatic adenocar-
cinoma with PnI.
Conclusion: Matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 correlates with perineural
invasion and microvessel density, suggesting a link with aggressive be-
haviour in prostate adenocarcinoma. We observed no association with
Gleason score of any MMP2 or MMP9. These findings highlight the need
to modulate the follow-up of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma con-
sidering all the factors that influences the evolution.

Expression of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in de
novo and recurrences of urothelial carcinoma
L. Cristina*, C. Popp, M. Cioplea, V. Nica, C. Constantinescu, S.A.
Stanciu, L. Nichita
*Colentina University Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Bladder carcinoma is the most common can-
cer of the urinary tract. Tumour invasion and progression are a multifac-
torial process promoted by microenvironmental changes that include
overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), activity controlled
by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs).
Methods: We examined the tissue expression of MMP2, TIMP2 and
MMP9 in 43 tumour samples from 18 patients with bladder carcinoma
with recidives. The cytoplasmic, finely granular expression pattern was
considered for analysis. The percentage of stained cells was noted as: 0
(no detectable immunostain), 1 (<10% nuclei), 2 (11%-50% nuclei), and
3 (>50% nuclei). The intensity was scored 1-3 (mild/moderate/strong).
Results: We used a combined score, multiplying the percentage score of
tumour cells expressing the marker and the intensity with which the
tumour cells expressed it. Higher expression levels of MMP-2 and
TIMP2 were observed in recurrences compared with primary tumours,
both in low-grade and high-grade tumours, with or without invasion.
MMP9 was weakly expressed in tumours recurrences without any statis-
tical significance.
Conclusion: Higher expression of both MMP2 and TIMP2 in tumour
recurrences suggest a balance between MMPs and their inhibitors
activity. Enhancing MMPs inhibitors activity could represent a promising
target in a better control and avoiding an unfavourable prognosis.

Ouzari, K. Mrad, I. Zidi
*Laboratory Microorganismes and Active Biomolecules, Sciences
Faculty of Tunis, University Tunis El Manar, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G)
expression has been implicated in the immune suppression favouring
tumours development. We aimed to characterize the immunohistochem-
ical expression of HLA-G in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and investigate
its correlation with clinico-pathological parameters.
Methods: Seventy-two cases of primary carcinoma of the kidney, col-
lected over 18 years, were retrieved. The IHC staining was performed
with mouse monoclonal antibody against HLA-G. Labelled tumour cells
percentage was determined. A percentage ≤25% defined HLA-Glow and
a percentage >25% determined high HLA-G expression.
Results: RCC tumoral tissue significantly expressed HLA-G compared
to healthy renal tissue (p <0.0001). This expression was significantly
higher in multifocal tumours (p = 0.0007), in clear cell carcinomas, in
grade 3 and 4 papillary carcinomas (p <0.0001), in the presence of a
sarcomatoid component (p = 0.0085), in cases with infiltration of
perirenal fat (p = 0.0033), as well as for advanced stages (pT3 and pT4
stage) (p = 0.049) and regional metastatic lymph nodes extension (pN1)
(p = 0.0005). Besides pT stage, these factors were significantly correlated
with high HLA-G.
Conclusion: HLA-G was, preferentially, detected in RCC and rarely in
adjacent normal tissue, suggesting its specific association with tumour
growth. Additionally, HLA-G expression was clearly associated with
poor prognostic factors for renal cancer suggesting its involvement in
the tumour escape.

Clinico-pathological details of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma
of the urinary bladder for improving patient selection to clinical
trials
A. D’Amuri*, F. Floccari, M. Brunelli
*Anatomic Pathology Unit Hospital "A. Perrino" Brindisi, Italy
Background & objectives: Small cell carcinoma (SCC) of the urinary
bladder is a rare, aggressive, poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neo-
plasm accounting for 0,3-0,7% of bladder tumours. Few protocols en-
counter small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with detailed clinico-
pathological features among clinical trials.
Methods: We reviewed the parameters displayed at morphology among a
series of SCC arising from urothelium. Clinical and histopathological
features of 45 SCC of the bladder were recruited from 2012 to 2021. 35
patients were males and 10 females, ranging in age from 63 to 90.
Cystoscopic examination with TURBT was performed. Gross haematuria
was the most common symptom.
Results: Tumours showed nests of small round malignant cells with pyk-
notic round to oval nuclei and evenly dispersed and foci of necrosis were
also observed. The mitotic rate was high. 30 cases were pure small cell
carcinoma, whereas 5 were associated with high grade infiltrative urothelial
carcinoma; 7 case was associated with carcinoma in situ and 3 with areas of
squamous differentiation. Tumour cells were positive for CKAE1/AE3,
p53, Ki-67, and focally for CK7, CK20, TTF-1, CD117 and p63. All cases
were immunoreactive for neuroendocrine markers as CD56 and NSE were
strongly and synaptophysin and chromogranin A focally positive.
Conclusion: SCC of the bladder occurs more often in elderly males and
prognosis is poor; tumour cells are strongly positive for CKAE1/AE3,
Virchows Arch
p53 and focally for CK7, CK20, TTF-1, c-Kit, p63 and are immunoreac-
tive for neuroendocrine markers; recognition of this rare entity should
enable better detailed tumour clustering when designing clinical trials
using drugs targeting patient affected by small cell neuroendocrine phe-
notype of urothelial carcinoma.

The unknown role of CD31 in the seminal tract
J. Domínguez de Dios*, M. Álvarez Sarria, J. González-Carreró Fojón,
M. Vieytes Molares, J.A. Ortiz-Rey
*SERGAS- Hospital Álvaro Cunqueiro, Spain
Background & objectives: It has recently been described that the trans-
membrane glycoprotein PECAM-1 or CD31 is expressed in vas deferens
epithelium. We have investigated the expression of CD31 and its possible
ligand, CD38, in the different segments of the seminal tract.
Methods: 110 sections from surgical specimens of the male genitourinary
tract from prepubertal and post pubertal patients, were immunostained
(Optiview, Ventana) with prediluted monoclonal antibodies (Cell
Marque), for CD31 (clone JC70) and CD38 (clone SP149). Epithelial
staining was evaluated assessing its intensity (weak, moderate or strong)
and extension (focal when <50% of positive cells, diffuse if ≥50%).
Results: CD31 is expressed in the cell cytoplasm of the vas deferens
epithelium from post pubertal cases only in its scrotal part (vasectomy
specimens), with weak-to-moderate and diffuse staining. CD31 has no
expression in the pelvic part and ampulla of vas deferens. Neither does it
in the epithelium of seminal vesicles or prostate. The results for CD38 are
complementary: it is negative in the scrotal vas deferens epithelium and
positive in the more distal portions studied, as well as in the seminal
vesicles. Epithelium of prostate glands is positive only for CD38, being
focal but strong. No expression for CD31 nor CD38 was observed in
testicular parenchyma, rete testis or epididymis.
Conclusion: CD31 is expressed in the epithelium of the scrotal portion of
vas deferens being negative in other segments of the seminal tract. A
reversal pattern is observed for CD38, a reported ligand for CD31.
CD31 positivity was observed in post pubertal vas deferens but not in
prepubertal samples. These features suggest a hypothetical physiological
role for CD31 expression (in cell maturation or sperm capacitation) in vas
deferens, which could be more than a simple conduit for spermatozoa and
deserves further investigation.

Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the prostate: a case report and review of
literature
E. Dvindenko*, F. Santos, R. Cabrera
*Instituto Português de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Portugal
Background & objectives: Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the prostate is a rare
neoplasm with an aggressive clinical course. Histologically, it is a biphasic
tumour composed of a malignant epithelial component and a distinct mes-
enchymal malignant component. Its pathogenesis remains unclear.
Methods: Herein, we report the clinicopathological features of a case of
sarcomatoid carcinoma of the prostate along with a brief review of the
literature.
Results: A 75-year-old men with perianal pain and rectal fullness was
found to have a large, heterogeneous prostatic mass. A differential diag-
nosis between sarcoma and sarcomatoid carcinoma was suggested by
transrectal biopsy examination, and a pelvic exenteration was performed.
Grossly, the gland was occupied by a 6 cm multinodular, fleshy, necrotic
tumour, infiltrating the bladder neck, anterior wall of the rectum and both
seminal vesicles. Microscopically, a high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma
with osteosarcomatous differentiation was observed, with a minor com-
ponent of Gleason score 8(4+4) acinar adenocarcinoma. A diagnosis of
sarcomatoid carcinoma was rendered. The patient died after surgery due
to post-operative infection.
Conclusion: Sarcomatoid carcinoma is an aggressive neoplasm associat-
ed with poor patient outcome, despite clinical intervention. According to
literature, about half of the patients have a prior history of an acinar
adenocarcinoma of the prostate and have received therapy for it. The
presence of heterologous elements in the sarcomatous components may
pose challenging diagnostic difficulties, especially if the epithelial com-
ponent is not apparent in transrectal biopsies.

Condom
*Pathology Department, Bellvitge University Hospital, IDIBELL,
Barcelona, Spain
Background & objectives: Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney
Disease (ADPKD) is common (1/400 to 1/1000 individuals). It is un-
known if it carries an increased risk of kidney neoplasms.
Methods: Retrospective study of nephrectomies due to ADPKD in our
centre (1988-2020). Age and sex data were recorded; laterality, weight
and size of the kidneys; presence or absence of tumour lesion, macro-
scopic and in CT-scans; tumours characteristics (type, grade and stage);
time on dialysis and follow-up. Estimation of the cumulative incidence of
renal neoplasias in our cohort.
Results: We collected 93 patients with ADPKD (120 nephrectomies).
Macroscopically we identified 14 solid lesions in 10 nephrectomies and
6/10 were detected previously by imaging. Microscopic study revealed 4
chromophobe carcinomas, 3 clear cell carcinomas, 2 oncocytomas, 1
papillary carcinoma type 1, 1 papillary clear cell carcinoma and 1 mucin-
ous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma (MTSCC); in addition to 2
angiomyolipomas. All lesions were pT1 (UICC 8th ed) and grade 2 or
3 (WHO 2016). One patient had 6 synchronous lesions with bilateral
involvement. Patient with MTSCC died 7 months after diagnosis due to
metastatic spread of his neoplasm. The rest are disease-free with a mean
follow-up time of 52 months.
Conclusion: In our series, 7.5% of the nephrectomised ADPKD patients
had a renal carcinoma. MTSCC had not been previously described in
these kidneys. The risk attributable to ADPKD remains to be defined
and the role of dialysis in the incidence of tumours in these patients has
to be clarified. CT scans are capable of detecting a part of the tumours in
this context (60% in our series). However, an exhaustive macroscopic
study is essential for the correct diagnosis of these lesions.

Role of arginine methylation in prostate cancer: Correlation with
pathological parameters and markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition
I.M. Grypari*, T. Papastergiou, M. Melachrinou, V. Zolota, V.
Megalooikonomou, V. Tzelepi
*Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Patras,
Greece
Background & objectives: Protein Arginine Methyltransferases
(PRMTS) catalyse arginine methylation, a post-translational histone mod-
ification and have been implicated in various cancer-associated pathways
i.e. epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell-cycle regulation.
However, their role in prostate cancer (PCa) has not been clarified yet.
Methods: PRMT2, PRMT7 and JMJD6 (a demethylase) nuclear, mem-
branous and cytoplasmic expression was immunohistochemically
assessed in tissue samples from 107 PCa patients (PGG1: 25 cases
PGG2: 11 cases, PGG3: 21 cases, PGG4: 13 cases, PGG5: 37 cases,
pT2:30, pT3a: 10, pT3b: 67). Fourteen cases had received neoadjuvant
androgen ablation therapy. Findings were correlated with the expression
of EMT and cell-cycle mediators.
Virchows Arch
Results: PRMT2 and PRMT7 membranous expression and PRMT7 cy-
toplasmic expression were inversely correlated, whereas and JMJD6 ex-
pression (in all cell compartments) was positively correlated with disease
stage (p<0.001, p=0.01, p=0.03 and p<0.01 respectively). PRMT2 and
PRMT7 membranous expression was higher in PGG1 cases compared to
PGG5 (p<0.001 and p=0.001, respectively). In contrast, membranous
JMJD6 expression was higher in PGG4 compared to PGG1 (p=0.026)
and nuclear JMJD6 expression was higher in PPG5 compared to PGG1
(p=0.006). PRMT7 and JMJD6 nuclear expression was higher in treated
compared to hormone naïve cases (p=0.001, p=0.01, respectively). Both
PRMTs and JMJD6 expression strongly correlated with ZEB1, TWIST,
E-cadherin and cyclinD1 expression (p<0.001, r>0.3).
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that membranous PRMT2 and
PRMT7 are inversely associated, whereas JMJD6 is positively correlated
with disease progression. In addition, our findings indicate a potential
intracellular trafficking of these enzymes, driven by the antiandrogen
therapy. Finally, a potential interplay with EMT mediators (ZEB1,
TWIST, E-cadherin) and the cell cycle regulator CyclinD1 is indicated
that needs further study in order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms
and indicate whether PRMTs may represent potential therapeutic targets.
Funding: This research was funded by a grant (56570000) from the
Research Committee of the University of Patras via “K. Karatheodori”
program.

significance of mixed grade papillary urothelial carcinoma compar-
ison with low and high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma
G. Kir*, G.E. Cecikoglu, Z.C. Olgun, M.H. Sorkun, A. Yildirim
*Istanbul medeniyet university, Turkey
Background & objectives: A small part of papillary carcinoma is mixed-
grade (MG) that is composed of a predominantly low-grade cancer with a
little high-grade (25% or less) component. We aimed to assess the clini-
copathological features of mixed-grade urothelial carcinoma (MGUC).
Methods: The study included 40 patients with LGUC, 52 patients with
MGUC, and 40 patients with HGUC among all bladder transurethral
resection (TUR) specimens diagnosed with urothelial carcinoma between
2010 and 2021.
Results: The mean age of all patients was 65,9 years and the mean
follow-up was 34 months. The rate of lamina propria and muscularis
propria invasion of MGUC was lower than that of the HGUC(p=0,000)
but the rate of lamina propria invasion was higher than LGUC at the
presentation. Additionally, the rate of in situ carcinoma of MGUC was
lower than that of the HGUC(p=0,000) but was higher than LGUC.
Recurrence of patients with MGUC occurred in 15 cases (29 %): 2 as
MGUC and 13 as HGUC. The rate of recurrence of patients with MGUC
higher than LGUC but it was not statistically significant.
Conclusion: A small part of papillary carcinoma is mixed-grade (MG) that
is composed of a predominantly low-grade cancer with a little high-grade
(25% or less) component. MGUC presented histopathologic prognostic
features in between LGUC and HGUC. MGUC grade progression was
significantly higher than LGUC (p =0,002). Patients with LGUC did not
show stage progression. MGUC had a lower incidence of stage progression
(7%) compared to HGUC patients (20%). Larger prospective studies are
needed to better characterize the biological behaviour of MGUC.

Samarska
*Department of Pathology, GROW-School for Oncology &
Developmental Biology, Maastricht University Medical Centre+,
The Netherlands
Background & objectives: JCPyV is a human neurotropic polyomavirus
that is associated with encephalitis and nephropathy. JCPyV has been
detected in the urine and tissue of urothelial cell carcinomas (UCC). The
pathogenesis of the presence of JCPyV-DNA in UCC is not yet proved.
Methods: We evaluated the relationship of the presence of Decoy urine
cytology specimens (UCS) with the detection of JCPyV-DNA in UCC. A
large single-institution database was searched for UCS positive for Decoy
cells, suggesting polyomavirus infection. The available urine sediments and
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samplesof UCC were test-
ed for the presence of JCPyV-LTAg by PCR and confirmed by sequencing.
Results: Typical Decoy cells were reported in 30 patients out of the
database with 22.867 UCS in the period 2004-2019. Of these, fourteen
patients were diagnosed with UCC of the urinary bladder (14/30; 46.6%)
before presenting with Decoy cells in the urine. JCPyV-DNA was iden-
tified in five UCS and three FFPE samples of UCC.
Conclusion: These findings correlated with the hypothesis that JCPyV
infection can be linked to urothelial carcinoma. Thus, further research is
needed to clarify the relationship between JCPyV and UCC.

Stavridis, S. Abdiu, X. Jusufi, J. Janculev
*Institute of Pathology, Medical Faculty, University Ss. Cyril and
Methodius, Skopje, North Macedonia
Background & objectives: Non-invasive bladder cancer (BC) detection
markers are urgently needed. Recent studies demonstrated that AHNAK
nucleoprotein2, (AHNAK2) differentiates between cystitis and BC.
We aimed to perform an ELISA urine test to compare AHNAK2 levels in
BC patients with the control’s levels.
Methods: Voided urine specimens were collected from 27 patients with
histologically proven BC and 28 healthy controls.
AHNAK2 concentrations were measured using a quantitative sandwich
ELISA test, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Associations between groups and the diagnostic performance of the assay
were evaluated with the Student t-test, Spearman’s Rank correlation, Mann-
Whitney U Test, and Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) curve analysis.
Results: Mean AHNAK2 urine levels were higher in BC patients
(80.7pg/ml; Median 13.87), compared to the controls (5.19pg/ml;
Median 2.25) (p<0.05). In the BC group, we found a statistically signif-
icant difference in AHNAK2 urine values between non-invasive and
invasive BC patients (p<0.01). We noted a moderate positive correlation
between AHNAK2 urine levels and pT status (r=0.69; p<0.05), but no
correlations were found with gender, age, and histologic grade. With a
cut-off value of 11.84pg/ml (Mean+SD of the control group), the sensi-
tivity and specificity of the assay were 51.85% and 85.71%, respectively.
Alternatively, in a proposed cut–off value of 5.19pg/ml, the sensitivity
increased to 62.96%, but the specificity declined to 67.86%.
Conclusion: The measurement of AHNAK2 urine concentrations could
represent an inexpensive, adjunct tool in the diagnostic evaluation of
patients suspected of having BC. Future research should refine and vali-
date these findings, which might ultimately reduce the number of unnec-
essary cystoscopies.

Immunohistochemical study of microsatellite instability in tumours
of the urogenital zone
O. Kuznetsova*, L. Zavalishina, E. Olyushina, Y. Andreeva, M.
Byakhova, G. Frank
*FSBEI FPE RMACPE MOH Russia, Russia
Background & objectives: Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a predic-
tive marker for immunotherapy. Objective: To study MSI in bladder
Virchows Arch
cancer (BC) and cervical carcinomas (CC) by immunohistochemical
(IHC) method and to assess its relationship with prognostic factors of
the disease and PD-L1 tumour status.
Methods: The MSI phenotype of the IHC method was studied on 50
patients with bladder cancer and 43 patients with cervical cancer. The
following antibodies VENTANA anti-MSH2 (G219-1129), VENTANA
anti-MSH6 (SP93), VENTANA anti-PMS2 (A16-4), VENTANA anti-
MLH1 (M1) with detection system - OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit
with OptiView Amplification Kit were used.
Results: MSI was found in 52.0% of bladder cancer samples. A correla-
tion was found between an absence and/or a decrease in the expression of
MMR proteins and the degree of differentiation of bladder cancer and
stage T. A tendency to a decrease in the expression of the studied proteins
in the zone of invasive tumour growth was found.
In cervical cancer, MSI was a rare event and was detected in 4.7%.
Intratumoral heterogeneity of IHC staining of MMR proteins was noted
in 27.9% of cervical cancer specimens. The absence and/or heterogeneity
of expression was most common in the MLH1 / PMS2.
Conclusion: MSI was statistically significant more often in bladder can-
cer (52.0%) than in cervical cancer (4.7%) (p-value = 1.427e-07). A
tendency towards a decrease in the expression of the studied MMR pro-
teins in the zone of invasive tumour growth was found. An association
was found between the absence and/or a decrease in MMR proteins'
expression and the degree of differentiation of tumours and stage T.
Intratumoral heterogeneity of MMR proteins was noted.

*Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Oncocytic renal neoplasms are a heteroge-
neous tumour group. Given the emerging entities Low grade Oncocytic
tumour and Eosinophilic vacuolated tumour, we proposed to review cases
of Oncocytoma and Hybrid Oncocytic/Chromophobe tumour reported
over a 10-year period within our unit.
Methods: We identified all cases reported as Oncocytoma or Hybrid
Oncocytic/ Chromophobe tumour (HOCT) diagnosed in our department
between 2010-2020 to determine retrospectively whether there would be
any reclassification of these tumours based on current information. We
also wanted to determine the outcome of this group of patients over the
course of the study period.
Results: 84 tumours, previously designated as oncocytoma or HOCT
were reviewed by two pathologists with an interest in renal neoplasms.
Four tumours were reclassified as Low grade Oncocytic tumours (LOTs),
and a further two were reclassified as Eosinophilic vacuolated tumours
(EVT). A small number of tumours would have been better classified as
Oncocytic neoplasms of Low malignant potential NOS.
Patients with LOT had a mean age of 68.5 years and all were female.
Mean tumour size was 43 mm. Patients with EVT had a mean age of 49.5
years and were also both female. The two tumours measured 43 and
123 mm (mean 83 mm).
Conclusion: Our results show 7% of historical oncocytoma and HOCT
diagnoses required a reclassification in light of the new entity descriptions
of LOT and EVT. Our data supports the original finding that these are
indolent tumours with no evidence of progression or metastatic disease in
these patients.

Voidazan, M. Decaussin-Petrucci
*Department of Histology UMFST G. E. Palade Tirgu Mures,
Department of Pathology, Mures County Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Variants of urothelial carcinoma (UC) are
increasingly reported in invasive (UC) and are relevant for treatment and
prognosis. The aim of our study was to determine the PD-L1 immuno-
histochemical (IHC) expression of 22C3 clone (Dako) in different vari-
ants of UC.
Methods: Our study included 33 cases of radical cystectomy performed for
muscle-invasive UC in the Urology Department from Târgu-Mureș County
Hospital (România) and Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud (France). PD-L1 IHC
expression was assessed using 22C3 clone (DAKO). The Combined
Positive Score (CPS) was applied with a positive cut-off value set at 10.
Results: The majority of patients were men (n=27, 81.8%) with only 6
(18.2%) women. The mean age of the patients was 67.35±9.98 years.
Eleven (33.3%) cases displayed lymph node involvement, while distant
metastases were documented in 7 cases (21.2%). Among all the 33 cases
of UC variants, PD-L1 CPS score was positive in 16 (48.48%) cases:
5(15.15%) squamous UCs, 4(12.12%) poorly differentiated UCs,
3(9.09%) sarcomatoid UCs, 2(6.06%) micropapillary UCs and
2(6.06%) mixed UCs, respectively. Concerning the tumour stage, the
majority of PD-L1 positive cases were pT3 (n=8 cases, 50.0%), followed
by pT4 (n=5, 31.2%) and pT2 (n=3, 18.8%).
Conclusion: Positive PD-L1 expression appears to be frequent among
UC variants. Our data may provide rationale and further support to in-
clude UC variants in clinical trials, in order to identify patients who may
benefit of anti-PD-L1 targeted chemotherapy.

Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma of kidney: a study of
four cases and review of the literature
S. Makni*, I. Bahri, M. Mellouli, M. Bouhamed, L. Jaidane, N. Gouia, T.
Boudawara, I. Bahri
*Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcino-
mas (MTSCC) are low-grade renal epithelial neoplasms, account for less
than 1% of all renal neoplasms. The aim of this work is to analyse the
clinical and the pathological features of this entity.
Methods: Retrospective study involving 4 cases of MTSCC of the kid-
ney, diagnosed in our department of pathology between 2006 and 2021.
Results: Average age was 67.25 years (extreme: 62-79). All patients were
female. Diagnosis was made on an enlarged nephrectomy in 3 cases and
partial nephrectomy in 1 case. Mean tumour size was 11,6 cm (extreme:
6-24 cm). Tumours were upper polar in 2 cases, lower polar in 1 case and
occupying the entire kidney in 1 case. They were solitary, unilateral, well-
demarcated and yellowish-white in colour. Histologically, all cases
showed a compact tumour proliferation, consists of anastomosing tubes,
without papillary structures in a myxoid stroma; associated with fascicu-
lated spindle cell sectors. Nuclear atypia, mitosis and necrosis were rare.
In Immunohistochemistry, cells were positive for CK7, EMA, vimentin;
and negative for CD10.
Conclusion: MTSCC of the kidney is an extremely rare neoplasm. It
occurs in middle-aged adults, with a female predilection. It has a
favourable prognosis. Although uncommon, this entity should not be
confused with other aggressive tumours of the kidney such as papillary
carcinoma, carcinoma of the collecting tubes, sarcomatoid carcinoma and
primary or metastatic sarcomas.

*Clinical Department of Pathology and Cytology "Ljudevit Jurak",
University Hospital Centre Sestre milosrdnice, Zagreb, Croatia
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Seminoma is the most common testicular
germ cell tumour (TGCT) representing 50% of all TGCTs. Seminoma
screening and diagnostic biomarker is yet to be identified. NANOG
epimutations could be the answer to this challenge.
Methods: Twenty- four tissue samples of patients with seminoma were
routinely stained for HE and immunohistochemistry. Nuclear NANOG
expression in seminoma, germ cell neoplasia in situ and unaffected sem-
iniferous tubules was scored according to intensity and percentage of
positive cells. cfDNA methylation level was analysed in pre and post-
orchiectomy semen samples by pyrosequencing. Results were considered
statistically significant when p<0.05.
Results: Positive strong nuclear immunohistochemical expression of
NANOG in more than 75% of tumour cells was demonstrated in all
examined samples of seminoma and germ cell neoplasia in situ, while
no expression was present in unaffected seminiferous tubules with
retained spermatogenesis. Regarding the analysis of semen samples,
statistically significant cfDNA hypomethylation of NANOG
promotor was detected in all preoperative when compared to postop-
erative samples.
Conclusion: NANOG is expressed in pluripotent germline stem cells in
TGCT. Our study has confirmed NANOG expression in seminoma tissue
and germ cell neoplasia in situ. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study detecting cfDNA hypomethylation of NANOG promotor in
seminal plasma samples with statistically significant difference between
pre and postoperative samples. Therefore, according to presented data,
cfDNA methylation of NANOG could present a screening and diagnostic
biomarker for detection of seminoma.

Many faces of nephrogenic adenoma: a clinicopathological mimic of
malignancy
S. Menon*, A. Shah, G. Bakshi, G. Prakash, M. Pal, S. Desai
*Pathology, Tata Memorial Centre HBNI, India
Background & objectives: Nephrogenic adenoma(NA) is an uncommon
benign lesion of the urinary tract with polymorphous histology
masquerading as a malignant tumour.
Methods: The pathology database of our institute was searched for '
nephrogenic adenoma' using our search engine over a period of 10 years.
(2010-2019). The clinical details and follow up were recorded from the
electronic medical records.
Results: Thirty-seven patients were retrieved for histological and
immunohistochemical(IHC) review. The median age of diagnosis was
63years(14-81years) with a male: female ratio of 3:1. Lesions were local-
ized to urinary bladder (92.3%) urethra (5.1%) and ureter (2.5%).
Cystoscopy (30 cases) showed flat erythematous (60%) or papillary
(40%) lesions mimicking urothelial carcinoma. Histology showed tubu-
lar, papillary and microcystic growth pattern with minimal cytological
atypia. The lesional cells were flat, cuboidal to low columnar with eosin-
ophilic cytoplasm. Hobnail, signet ring-like and clear cell changes were
identified in a subset of cases. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was per-
formed in 27 cases. PAX-8(n=22) and CK7(n=21) expression were
seen in 100% of the cases AMACR was positive in 89.4% cases
(n=17/19).
Conclusion: Nephrogenic Adenoma is a benign lesion of the urothelial
tract which is often misdiagnosed clinically and histologically as a ma-
lignancy. Meticulous histological evaluation along with a careful selec-
tion of IHC panel is critical for correct diagnosis.

K. Midiber, R. Vandysheva, A. Kamalov, A. Pshikhachev
*FSBI RIHM, Russian Federation
Background & objectives: Aim of our research was to evaluate the
influence of clinical and pathohistological features of urothelial non-
muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) on the risk of recurrence. A
retrospective study included 100 patients (69 males, 31 females, 32-94
y.o.) with NMIBC.
Methods: Each study participant underwent TUR with intravesical che-
motherapy. After 6-month follow-up period the subjects were divided
into two groups with presence or absence of relapse. Parameters like
gender, age, clinical manifestations, tumour size, tumour localization,
number of malignant foci, pathohistological degree of tumour differenti-
ation (PATO) – high-, moderate, poorly differentiated (G1, G2, G3, re-
spectively) were compared within each group.
Results: The study found that the PATO G1 had on average a smaller
tumour size than PATO G2 and G3 (p=0.002). It was shown that the
average age of patients with G2 and G3 tumours is higher than in the
subgroup of patients with G1 tumours (p=0.022, p=0.03, respectively). It
was noted that multiple lesions of the bladder led to relapse almost twice
as often as single tumours (p=0.001). With an increase in size of tumour
and with a decrease in the degree of differentiation, the chances of relapse
significantly increased (p<0.05).
Conclusion: The data of the study shows that the clinical and
pathohistological parameters (PATO, focality of tumour, size of lesion)
are interrelated with the recurrent course of bladder cancer.

Mesenchymal prostate tumours, the surprise you do not expect. A
single centre thirty-year experience
E. Miraval Wong*, P. Puente Lopez, P. Gonzalez-Peramato, E. Garcia
Fernandez
*Hospital Universitario La Paz, Spain
Background & objectives: Mesenchymal tumours of the prostate repre-
sent less than 0,1% of primary malignant prostatic tumours. They have
variable histological features; therefore, they pose a diagnostic challenge.
The objective is to make a 30-year review of these cases in our centre.
Methods: We reviewed our files searching for all primary malignant
prostatic lesions diagnosed from January 1, 1990 to March 1, 2021. All
samples were classified according to WHO 2016 classification. Our col-
lected variables were age at diagnosis, outcome, sample type, architec-
tural pattern, histologic diagnosis and grade.
Results: After reviewing 55.672 core biopsies from 20.736 patients and
4.630 surgical specimens from 4.447 patients, we obtained a cohort of 10
patients. Five were rhabdomyosarcomas, diagnosed in 2 transurethral
resections (TUR), 2 cores biopsies and 1 pelvic resection specimen, all
embryonic type with a mean age of 7 years. In adults, the mean age was
67,4 years; one was a leiomyosarcoma diagnosed in a TUR; two were
prostatic stromal tumour of uncertain malignant potential on cores biop-
sies and two high grade prostatic stromal sarcomas. We have available
clinical data of outcome from 6 cases, two died from these tumours
(rhabdomyosarcoma and leiomyosarcoma), two from other causes and
two are alive.
Conclusion: Prostatic mesenchymal tumours represent 0.02% of all pros-
tate samples and specimens in our centre. Consistent with the literature,
all cases of rhabdomyosarcoma were diagnosed in the paediatric age and
the others in adults. Neuroectodermic differentiation in these tumours is
an unusual histologic finding. Overall, prostatic tumours of uncertain
malignant potential and prostatic stromal sarcomas have a better progno-
sis than rhabdomyosarcoma and leiomyosarcoma.

Background & objectives: En bloc resection of bladder tumour (ERBT)
focuses on resecting the tumour in one piece including detrusor muscle
and tumour free mucosa. Our objective is to precisely assess the morpho-
logical features of the ERBT specimens.
Methods: Patients with primary suspected non-muscle invasive bladder
cancer (NMIBC) < 3 cm in size were prospectively included. Tumours
were totally embedded for whole mount section. Sections were analysed
to determine the adequacy of the resection in terms of artefacts, spatial
orientation of the tumour, presence of detrusor muscle and state of the
resection margin.
Results: Sixteen patients (19 tumours) were included. Mean tumour di-
ameter was 1.56 cm (0.4-2,8). Seven and 12 tumours were High- and
Low- grade urothelial carcinoma respectively. Five were pT1 and 14 pTa.
No prominent cautery damage or crush artefact effected the diagnosis and
staging of the tumour. The spatial arrangement of tissue with orientation
of tumour, lamina propria and detrusor muscle were detected in 14
tumours.
Detrusor muscle was lacking in 2 out of 5 pT1 tumours. In 7 tumours both
mucosal margins were free of tumour or CIS. In 1 case of HGpT1, CIS
was found in the mucosal margin. EBRT lead to clinical stage in 85% of
primary NMIBC.
Conclusion: Preliminary data shows the feasibility of morphological
analysis of EBRT specimens. ERBT provides a well oriented specimen
that allows exact determination of tumour stage and surgical margins. The
rates of detrusor presence and mucosa-free margins are not superior to the
conventional endoscopic resection technique, justifying the lack of dif-
ference in recurrence rates between EBRT and conventional resection
reported in the literature. Notwithstanding, EBRT provides the solid
ground to identify clinically relevant recurrence causes.

Testicular pathology and the effects of national lockdown in a district
general hospital
D. O'Dwyer*, M. Agarwal
*University Hospital Monklands, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Low incidence of testicular cancer means
orchiectomies are infrequently reported by district general pathologists.
National lockdown threatened to exacerbate this with reductions and
delays in cancer diagnoses. This audit compared reporting of orchiectomy
specimens before and after lockdown was imposed.
Methods: A search of the local pathology database was conducted. The
pathology reports of testicular orchiectomies performed April 2019 –
April 2021 were retrieved. Chi square statistical analysis was performed
to compare pathology reporting in the year leading up to and the year
following the National lockdown announcement. Concordance with ter-
tiary centre reporting was assessed using Kappa.
Results: Forty-one orchiectomies were performed in the year leading up
to national lockdown with 68.3% for benign indications. In the following
year 43 orchiectomies were performed and 53.5% were for the treatment
of testicular neoplasms. The proportional change in workload was signif-
icant (p=0.04). Average reporting time overall was 12 days. Prior to
lockdown only 41.5% of testicular orchiectomy reports were authorised
within 10 days versus 76.7% of reports in the year after (p=0.001). Of 33
testicular neoplasms referred to a tertiary centre reporting errors were
identified in 4 cases (12.1%). Overall concordance showed “substantial
agreement” (Kappa=0.70). There was no difference in reporting concor-
dance before and after lockdown.
Conclusion: The covid pandemic and lockdown raised concerns regard-
ing NHS ability to achieve standardized targets. We reviewed testicular
orchiectomies performed within a single institution. Volume of work has
remained consistent. Proportionally more orchiectomies were performed
for the treatment of neoplasms in the year following lockdown with fewer
benign orchiectomies. Turnaround times improved with no impact on
reporting quality. Further assessment is needed to understand the true
impact of national lockdown on the ability of pathology departments to
deliver standardized care.

Prostatic calculi cause collagen type I overexpression in prostate can-
cer tissue

Romaniuk*, R. Moskalenko
*Sumy State University, Ukraine
Background & objectives: Prostatic calculi (PCa) causes morphological
and immunohistochemical transformation of connective tissue of prostate
cancer (PC) which has an important role in disease progression.
Objective: To study the effect of prostate calculi on connective tissue
composition of prostate cancer tissue.
Methods: For this study we used 60 PC samples (30 PC samples with PCa
and 30 samples without biomineralization). Initially all samples were
stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Immunohistochemistry was performed
with antibodies against Collagen type I and Collagen type II. Data sets were
analysed by Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney’s U-test and Student’s t-test.
Results: The presence of PCa in tumour tissue was combined with epi-
thelial desquamation, inflammation and mechanical tissue damage. We
found that tissue with PCa had a higher area of Collagen I expression (p <
0.05) and was localized predominantly in the foci of biomineralization.
During this study, we detected no significant difference in Collagen type
II expression between groups (p > 0.05). This supports the idea that PCa
causes high Collagen I expression and by so doing supports the develop-
ment of PC osteoblastic immunophenotype.
Conclusion: PC causes cell damage and remodelling of tumour connec-
tive tissue. It creates a specific environment for osteoblastic
immunophenotype development of PC cells. It worsens disease prognosis
and supports bone metastases development.

Background & objectives: FAS (CD95) is a death receptor critically
involved in the induction of apoptosis. The aim of this study was to
analyse the expression pattern of FAS in muscle-invasive urothelial blad-
der cancer and to assess its prognostic significance.
Methods: The study comprised 150 muscle-invasive urothelial bladder
cancer (pathologic stage T2). Tumour samples were incorporated in tissue
microarrays and analysed by immunohistochemistry to the expression of
FAS receptor. FAS expression status was correlated with pathological
parameters and follow-up data.
Results: Decrease or loss of FAS was found in 53,3% of the tumours.
High FAS expression correlated with the finding of carcinoma in situ in
the surroundings of invasive tumours (p=0.038). Tumours with squamous
differentiation showed significant loss of FAS (p=0,002), while tumours
with glandular differentiation and variant morphology demonstrated high
FAS expression (p=0,042, and p=0,020, respectively). Patients with
muscle-invasive tumours with high FAS expression had significantly
longer survival (p=0,003). Decreased FAS expression was strongly asso-
ciated with cancer-specific death (p=0,001).
Conclusion: The expression of FAS may play an important role in the
prediction of muscle-invasive bladder cancer prognosis. Decrease or loss
of FAS expression in tumour tissue indicates aggressive disease and poor
survival. Loss of FAS expression in muscle-invasive tumours should
impel radical cystectomy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy or trimodal
therapy as a mandatory treatment modality.

Boudawara, M. Triki
*University Hospital of Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Testicular adenomatoid tumours are rare
benign tumours of male genital tract. They appear mostly in the third to
fifth decades. They are easily misdiagnosed as malignant tumours. The
aim of this study is to analyse their epidemiological and histopathological
characteristics.
Methods: In our retrospective study, we reviewed 5 cases of
adenomatoid tumour of the testis, that were diagnosed at the Pathology
Department of Habib Bourguiba Hospital over a 17-year period (2004-
2020). An analysis of the histological data and a review of the clinical
records were carried out in all cases.
Results: The average age of our patients was 32 years (range between 13
and 51). All tumours were solitary and unilateral. They occurred as an
intratesticular masses (n = 2) or extra testicular masses: in the epididymis
(n = 3). They ranged in size from 0.5 to 1 cm (mean 0.8 cm). All patients
underwent surgical treatment. Microscopic findings revealed a prolifera-
tion of variably sized tubules and pseudo-vascular spaces lined by eosin-
ophilic cuboidal or flattened cells, with focal intracytoplasmic
vacuolization. Nuclear atypia and mitotic figure were absent. Admixed
smooth muscles were also present. Immunohistochemistry showed posi-
tivity for calretinin, pancytokeratin, vimentin, focally for EMA and neg-
ativity for CD34, inhibin and BerEP4.
Conclusion: Testicular adenomatoid tumour is a rare testicular benign
tumour. They usually present as extra testicular masses than an
intratesticular masses. By imaging, they are easily misdiagnosed as ma-
lignant tumours with removal of organs. Histologically, adenomatoid
tumours are characterized by adenoid, solid and cystic pattern. When
the cystic pattern predominates, the tumour can simulate lymphangioma.
The mesothelial cell origin can be proved on the basis of an immunohis-
tochemistry stain using markers typical of mesothelial origin, including
calretinin, WT1 and HBME1.

*Institute of Pathology, Heinrich-Heine University and University
Hospital, Duesseldorf, Germany
Background & objectives: The accurate diagnosis of pancreatic cystic
lesions (PCL) is vital for adequate patient management. Molecular anal-
yses have gained importance in PCL diagnostics. Therefore, we aimed at
identifying miRNAs that could serve as molecular biomarkers for risk
stratification of PCL.
Methods: Total RNA was isolated from pancreatic FFPE tissue (n=29) and
cyst fluids (n=40). RNA from FFPE tissue was used for library preparation
using the ‘VAHTS small RNA library prep kit for Illumina’ and subse-
quently sequenced on the MiSeq system. miRNA levels of miR-21-5p,
miR-221-3p, miR-200a-5p and miR-217a-5p were then investigated using
TaqManTM Advanced miRNA-Assays in pancreatic cyst fluids.
Results: miRNA sequencing revealed a differential expression in IPMNs and
PDAC compared to normal pancreatic tissue in following four miRNAs: miR-
21-5p, miR-221-3p, miR-200a-5p and miR-216a-5p. Based on the sequencing
results,relativeexpressionof these miRNAswasthen investigatedinpancreatic
cyst fluids: miR-21-5p and miR-200a-5p were more expressed in cyst fluids
from mucinous cysts and PDAC compared to pseudocysts and serous cysts.
miR-221-3p expression was only elevated in PDAC and miR-216a-5p did not
show any differential expression in cyst fluids.
Conclusion: Overall, three of four miRNAs that were detected as differ-
entially expressed in FFPE specimens show potential to distinguish pan-
creatic mucinous cysts from non-mucinous cysts and may aid accurate
diagnosis of PCL and improve adequate patient management.

A comparative study between neoplastic nuclei percentage and allelic
fraction in lung carcinomas analysed by NGS
B. Pena*, R. Pinto, L. Cirnes, S. Canberk, D.F. Schmitt
*Hospital de Santa Maria - CHULN, EPE, Portugal
Background & objectives: Accurate definition of malignant cell fraction
is pivotal to determine the quantity of tumourDNA/RNA acceptable for
molecular testing. Our aim was to verify the correlation between neoplas-
tic nuclei percentage(NNP) and allelic fraction(AF) detected by NGS in a
series of lung cancer.
Methods: We revised the data resulting from NGS analysis of 349 lung
carcinomas, studied in our Institute from January-May2020. We selected
and analysed 320 cases, that presented at least one mutation, aiming to
verify a correlation between morphological assessment of NNP, made by
a pathologist/technician, and the allelic fraction detected. All cases with
lower NNP(5-10%) were reviewed by another pathologist.
Results: The genes more frequently mutated were: KRAS (40%), EGFR
(33%), BRAF (6%), HER2 (5%) and MET (2,5%). In 248 cases (77,5%)
we observed an expected relation between NNP and AF of the mutated
gene by NGS, in other words a relation approximately from 2:1. In 72
cases (22,5%) there was no correlation, with a low NNP compared to the
AF. These cases were re-evaluated by another pathologist in order to
exclude an inter-observer disagreement in the estimation of NNP.
Nevertheless, the absence of correlation was confirmed.
Conclusion: In most of the cases(77,5%) there was a good agreement
between the estimation of NNP and the AF. However, in 22,5%cases there
was possible underestimation of the NNP, which has been demonstrated in
other studies. Tumour heterogeneity, differences between the real number
of neoplastic nuclei observed and those dissected for NGS, due to different
section levels of cutting and a rare possibility for a double/triple hit in some
of the genes, can explain the discrepancies found in about(1/4)of the cases.

Diagnostic usefulness of the detection of molecular alterations in
pleural sarcomatoid mesothelioma: 3 case series with study of the
homozygous deletion of 9p21 and immunohistochemistry for BAP1

Bernabe, G. Silvestre Egea, M.d.C. Colomés Iess, L. Martín Fragueiro,
C. Salas Antón, J. Martín López
*Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Spain
Background & objectives: Genomic studies in mesotheliomas reveal
BAP1 alteration specially in epithelioid subtypes, while in sarcomatoid
mesothelioma (SM) homozygous deletion of 9p21 has greater frequency.
It is being proposed to incorporate into the diagnostic algorithm of me-
sotheliomas the detection of molecular alterations.
Methods: We share our experience with 3 cases of SM and carry out a
bibliographic review on its utility. In all cases, two mesothelial and two
epithelial markers were performed in addition to BAP1 (clone C-4, Santa
Cruz). The P16/CDKN2A deletion was analysed by FISH using the
Zytolight® CDKN2A/CEN 9 probe, in complete sections.
Results: All were men (3), 2 ex-smokers, aged 59-84 years. One was a
construction worker. They presented a pleural mass (1), pleuro-pulmonary
nodule (1) or pleural nodules (1) together with hemothorax (1) or pleural
Virchows Arch
effusion (2). All 3 were diagnosed with videothoracoscopic biopsies. The
loss of nuclear expression of BAP1 was observed in one case (1/3) and it
was homogeneous, always identifying an internal control (lymphocytes,
endothelial cells or fibroblasts). All three cases showed homozygous dele-
tion of P16/CDNK2A. We did not perform immunohistochemistry of p16
since the published literature rules out its usefulness and, however, describe
a strong correlation between loss of MTAP and the 9p21 deletion.
Conclusion: Since 2018 we have performed P16/CDKN2A FISH and
BAP1 immunohistochemistry in the differential diagnosis of mesothelio-
mas. Although there are few cases, our series shows correlation with the
data described in the literature, being the homozygous deletion of P16/
CDKN2A a frequent alteration in SM. In contrast, nuclear loss of BAP1 is
rare. The use of CDKN2A/CEN 9 FISH is a sensitive tool for the diag-
nosis of SM, being useful in cases with diagnostic doubts.

Potential of an AI-based digital biomarker to predict neoadjuvant
chemotherapy response from preoperative biopsies of Luminal-B
breast cancer

E. Lips, F. Ciompi
*Radboud University Medical Center, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Invasive breast cancer (IBC) is increasingly
treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Yet, only 15-20% of Luminal-B
patients achieve pathological complete response (pCR). We developed an
AI-based biomarker to predict pCR of Luminal-B IBC from preoperative
biopsies stained with H&E.
Methods: First, we trained a deep learning model on a multi-centric dataset
of n=277 manually annotated breast cancer H&E-stained histopathology
images to segment tumour, lymphocytes and other tissue. Second, we
applied the segmentation model to an independent set of n=297 Luminal-
B pre-treatment biopsies. For each case, we computed our biomarker: the
proportion of tumour within 80μm distance from lymphocyte regions.
Results: From the Luminal-B cohort, 32/297 cases (11%) were labelled as
“pCR” when no remaining cancer cells were reported for the post-operative
surgical resection. The biomarker showed significant (p<<0.01) correlation
with pCR with a point biserial correlation coefficient of 0.27. Setting a cut-
off value based on the optimal operating point of the ROC curve
(AUC=0.69), we reached a sensitivity of 0.53 and a specificity of 0.74.
Conclusion: The developed deep-learning based biomarker quantifies
the proportion of inflammatory tumour regions. It shows promising re-
sults for predicting pCR for Luminal-B breast cancer from pre-treatment
biopsies stained with H&E.

Quantifying morphological features of neoplastic lymphocytes
using deep neural networks on whole-slide images is useful
in differentiating monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal
T-cell lymphoma from primary intestinal peripheral T-cell
lymphoma, NOS
S. Chuang*, W. Yu, C. Li, J. Wu, C. Yeh
*Chi-Mei Medical Center, Taiwan
Background & objectives: Monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-
cell lymphoma (MEITL) is primary intestinal T-cell lymphoma (PITL)
comprising monomorphic medium-sized round nuclei expressing CD8,
CD56, and cytotoxic markers, while those with pleomorphic nuclei are
peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), NOS. The morphological distinc-
tion could be subjective.
Methods: We used whole-slide images of 40 PITLs from Taiwan. An
instance segmentation model was trained and applied to segment lym-
phocytes under high-power fields. Morphological features were extracted
and statistically analysed to serve as an objective quantification index.
Finally, a classifier for MEITL or PTCL-NOS was trained by using ex-
tracted features with an xgboost algorithm and with a 3-fold cross
validation.
Results: Our lymphocytes detector achieved an average precision of
0.906 on segmenting target cells and identified 892.18 ± 254.80 cells in
each high-power field. The general linear model was employed to analyse
morphological features and showed a significant difference (p<0.001) on
several features when comparing these two types of PITL. Furthermore,
cell pleomorphism could be quantified by using combinations of morpho-
logical features, which showed a clear boundary between the two groups
when visualized on a scatter plot. The classification performance of ma-
chine learning models achieved an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of
0.915 by using morphological features, an AUC of 0.975 when
immunophenotypical findings, namely CD8 and CD56, were
incorporated.
Conclusion: Our method measured cellular morphology in a quantitative,
objective, and consistent manner. We identified several indexes useful for
differentiating MEITL from PTCL-NOS. For morphologically borderline
cases using our method, the pathologists may incorporate
immunophenotypical findings for assisting the final diagnosis. In addition
to PITL, our method can also serves as an objective quantification tools
for measuring pleomorphism in other diseases such as low vs. high grade
follicular lymphoma, or mantle cell lymphoma of the classic vs. pleomor-
phic variants.

Caetano, M.J. Martins, T. Simões da Silva, M.A. Cipriano
*Pathology Department, Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Centro
Hospitalar e Universitário Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2
(HER2) is analysed through immunohistochemistry (IHC). Roche
launched an innovative image analysis algorithm to evaluate HER2. We
aimed to compare ocular estimated scores with the score calculated with
the algorithm.
Methods: Thirty-five breast biopsies of invasive breast cancers with IHC
for HER2 from one year (2020). Slides were scanned using the
VENTANA DP 200 and then analysed with the HER2 algorithm of
uPath Software.
Results: The pathologists originally reported 45.7% negative (20% of
0+ and 25.7% of 1+) IHC score, 42.9% equivocal (2+) IHC score and
11.4% positive (3+) IHC score, while uPath software detected 14.3%
negative (2.9% of 0+ and 11.4% of 1+) IHC score, 40% equivocal (2+)
IHC score and 45.7% positive (3+). This study demonstrated the
agreement of pathologists and Software in 42.9% of the cases.
31.4% of negative scores estimated by pathologists turn into equivocal
(22.9%) and positive (8.5%) scores after digital imaging analysis.
Finally, 25.7% of equivocal scores previously analysed by patholo-
gists turn into positive.
Conclusion: IHC is subject to interobserver variation and lack of
reproducibility. uPath is an important tool to support the patholo-
gist's decision in determining HER2 status in breast carcinoma, pro-
viding an alternative, practical and reproducible method to manual
scoring.

Morphometric features to predict outcome after ductal carcinoma in
situ of the breast

Visser, E. Groen, C. Van der Borden, P. Kristel, E. Lips, J. Wesseling,
G.C. PRECISION Consortium
*Netherlands Cancer Institute, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a poten-
tial precursor of invasive breast cancer (IBC). However, large proportion
of untreated DCIS do not progress to IBC. There is an important need to
distinguish harmless from aggressive DCIS to better decide treatment.
Methods: We retrieved clinical data from a case-control study of patients
diagnosed with primary DCIS treated with breast-conserving surgery
alone. Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) slides of DCIS lesions were scanned
and uploaded to HALO software (IndicaLabs) for DCIS classification
based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. We hypothesize that mor-
phometric features observed in HE sections of DCIS might predict pro-
gression to ipsilateral IBC (iIBC).
Results: We first manually annotated DCIS regions in 20 HE sections
uploaded in HALO. Annotations were used by advanced deep learning
neural network to create a train-by-example tissue classifier. The AI-
segmentation was tested in another 40 independent DCIS HE sections
and evaluated by an expert pathologist. Finally, this classifier was applied
on 559 DCIS lesions, i.e. 225 with a subsequent iIBC event (cases) and
334 without subsequent iIBC (controls). It allows us to determine if the
diameter, density, and distribution of DCIS ducts found in tissue sections
of primary diagnosed DCIS are associated with the risk of subsequent
iIBC.
Conclusion: HALO provided the number of DCIS of each sample,
coordinates and maximum diameter of each duct, with high accuracy.
We have successfully built an AI tissue classifier to evaluate DCIS
diameter, density, and distribution in HE sections. Currently, the as-
sociation between these morphometric features and risk of subsequent
iIBC is being evaluated by applying multivariate regression models,
including clinical and other pathological variables. These morphomet-
ric features are promising variables to distinguish harmless from po-
tentially hazardous DCIS.

Pathologist-driven experience drives design of AI-based digital
diagnostics
J. Sue*, D. Gorton, T. Sabo, S. Ih, S. Seymour, P.M. Raciti, M.G. Hanna
*Paige.AI, USA
Background & objectives: Digital pathology and artificial intelligence
(AI) for routine clinical diagnosis is a novel, growing area. User experi-
ence (UX) research is critical to ensure pathologists can effectively and
efficiently use digital viewing software and integrated AI solutions in
daily clinical practice.
Methods: To understand how to deliver the most value from using a highly
accurate AI-based digital diagnostic for breast cancer, various user research
methods were employed including contextual inquiry and concept testing
with Breast pathology specialists. Additional investigative methods includ-
ed qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys with both US-based and
European-based general and sub-specialized pathologists.
Results: 75% of pathologists surveyed (36/48) were interested/very in-
terested in using AI in digital workflows. The desired level of
explainability of AI results depended on the pathologist’s level of confi-
dence in identifying diagnostic features and their use setting (clinical v.
non-clinical). Additionally, observing pathologists review AI results as a
heatmap (visualization technique to display magnitude of findings)
revealed an opportunity for improved usability; Pathologists consistently
hid the heatmap to evaluate the underlying tissue identified by the AI.
Consequently, a new visualization technique that avoids obscuring tissue
identified by the AI was developed, resulting in greater satisfaction.
Beyond slide-level visualization, AI-enabled case prioritization was per-
ceived as high value for efficiency gains.
Conclusion: Majority of surveyed pathologists believe the incorporation
of AI into digital pathology workflows has the potential to save time and
reduce workload. These gains in efficiency and quality can only be
achieved with thoughtful design powered by user-driven research and
insights that focus on enhancing the Pathologist-AI interaction. By
leveraging these research methodologies, Paige has designed novel visu-
alization and interaction types for its digital diagnostics that have resulted
in improved understanding, satisfaction, and navigational efficiencies.

Pericardic thymolipoma – case report
C. Amalinei*, A. Grigoras, L.A. Riscanu, S. Giusca, T. Iov
*"Grigore T. Popa" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Iasi and
Institute of Legal Medicine Iasi, Romania
Background & objectives: Thymolipoma is a relatively rare tumour,
representing about 2-9% of thymic neoplasms, being characterized by a
slow rate of growth. The aim of our study is to report a case of incidental
thymolipoma, necroptically diagnosed in a 56 years-old man.
Methods: Necroptic examination has been associated to collection of
tissue specimens for microscopy. Routine hematoxylin-eosin staining,
along with immunohistochemistry using a panel of markers (CD3, Tdt,
vimentin, p63, and cytokeratin AE1/AE3) have been performed.
Results: The histopathological examination revealed a small tumour
within pericardium, of 21/19/18mm, composed of mature adipose
tissue, without atypia, associated with foci of benign thymic tissue,
and groups of epithelial cells. Thymocytes showed a strong Tdt
immunopositivity. The groups of epithelial cells were strongly posi-
tive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and p63, negative for vimentin, and
had a variable expression of Bcl-2.
Conclusion: Thymolipoma is usually diagnosed in the second or third
decade of life but considering the slow growth and late symptoms, due to
compression, it may represent an incidental finding in autopsy. It may be
related to systemic diseases, such as Grave’s disease, aplastic anaemia,
and other autoimmune disorders. Despite their rare occurrence,
thymolipomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of me-
diastinal lipoma or liposarcoma, thymic hyperplasia, teratoma, and
regressed thymoma. The microscopic examination and immunohisto-
chemistry may certify the diagnosis.

Case report of lipomatosis cordis causing myocardial infarction
P. Konstantinidou, E. Chatzifotiou, C. Charalampidis, R. Leontari, E.
Zagelidou, D. Anestakis*
*Laboratory of Pathology, Forensic Service of Thessaloniki, Ministry of
Justice, Greece
Background & objectives: Lipomatosis cordis, also known as myocar-
dial steatosis, is the abnormal retention of lipids within the myocardium
and specifically, the ventricular or interventricular septal myocardium.
Methods: A 74-year-old woman with cardiac infarction having elevated
levels of adiposing tissue within the cardiac muscle especially observed
within atria and ventricles. A further observation in the coronary arteries,
Virchows Arch
showed atherosclerotic lesions inside the vascular lumen. Several ventric-
ular slices had adipose infiltrations.
Results: Following a standard protocol of paraffin-ebaded tissue, hematox-
ylin and eosin staining, microscopical findings implicated locally elevated
interstitial oedema, interstitial fibrosis-mainly perivascular. Also, intramus-
cularly was in few sites observed connective tissue. Additionally, there were
dispersed adipose infiltrates, in the presence of inflammatory cells, steatosis
of the lumen by about 30-40%, while in a few places steatosis was in about
50-60%. Finally, there were findings of aortic segment with fractured
wall sites and evidence of present atherosclerotic lesions.
Conclusion: To sum up, myocardial steatosis has clinical and patholog-
ical significance for cardiac histology, electrophysiology and therefore
the whole circulation process. Ectopic fat accumulation may cause
lipotoxicity in cardiac muscle, which can lead to dysfunction and induc-
tion of structural remodelling. Correlated factors to this pathologic situa-
tion are aging, female sex, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, obesity,
CAD, aortic stenosis and pulmonary hypertension.

Necrotizing pneumonia caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa in a pa-
tient with acquired haemophilia: an autopsy case report
V. Baena Romero*, C. González García
*Anatomía Patológica Hospital La Paz, Madrid, Spain
Background & objectives: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative
bacterium is a frequent cause of severe hospital-acquired respiratory in-
fections, especially in immunocompromised patients. Acquired
haemophilia is a rare autoimmune disorder in which immunosuppression
with steroids and monoclonal antibody rituximab is usually effective.
Methods: A 69-year-old woman was admitted in our hospital’s emergen-
cy department for management of general discomfort and fatigue, adding
fever in the last days. She had been treated with steroids and rituximab
due to recently diagnosed acquired haemophilia. Several hours after ad-
mission, the patient’s respiratory condition deteriorated progressively and
entered a state of shock. She died 3 days after admission.
Results: Autopsy of the whole body including the brain was performed.
Notable findings were several nodular lesions with white borders in both
lungs and one yellowish nodular lesion in liver. Microscopically those
areas correspond to extensive necrotizing abscess formation with haem-
orrhage and infarction. Vasculitis and perivascular inflammatory changes
caused by gram-negative bacilli invading medium-sized pulmonary ves-
sel walls were identified and thrombosis was observed. A sample of an
hepatic abscess was sent to microbiology department, confirming the
result of “mixed flora with pseudomonas aeruginosa”.
Conclusion: There are few reports on necrotizing pneumonia caused by
P. aeruginosa. Several authors described in their series similar nodular
necrotic lesions that occasionally coalesce to form cavities depending on
the time following the initial onset of symptoms. It is important to high-
light that it was possible to detect p. aeruginosa in culture in this case. P.
aeruginosa should be considered as a rare but fatal causative pathogen of
necrotizing pneumonia that may complicate the clinical course specially
in immunocompromised patients.

Unusual presentation of diffuse B-cell lymphoma as a large isolated
epiglottic mass
D. Costache*, L. Luca, A. Tița, M. Bosa, C.O. Căpățînă, A. Simionescu
*Pathology Department, Colentina University Clinical Hospital,
Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Primary extranodal head and neck lympho-
mas are the second most frequent, accounting for 2.5% of all lymphoma
cases. Presentation in the larynx or hypopharynx is rare (1% of all laryn-
geal tumours) and primary epiglottic B-cell lymphoma is even less
common.
Methods: We present the case of the sudden death of a 76-year-old
female. The autopsy performed revealed a large infiltrative mass involv-
ing the epiglottis, the base of the tongue and the hypopharynx. The tu-
mour was sampled and fixed in formalin, processed, embedded in paraf-
fin and examined on H&E and ancillary immunohistochemical stains.
Results: At grossing the tumour had ill-defined margins, forming a large
mass in the epiglottis, infiltrating the base of the tongue and the hypo-
pharynx, whitish-grey colour and firm to hard consistency. Microscopic
examination showed a diffuse proliferation of medium-large, discohesive
cells, with marked cytologic and nuclear pleomorphism, large nuclei,
with prominent nucleoli, brisk mitotic activity and extensive necrosis,
surrounded by a fibrotic stroma, invading the full thickness of the epi-
glottis, with ulceration of the epithelium and lymphovascular invasion.
The tumour was AE1/AE3, CD3 and CD5 negative, with few scattered
small reactive lymphocytes, and CD20 showed strong and diffuse
positivity.
Conclusion: Extranodal non-Hodgkin, diffuse B-cell lymphomas limited
to the larynx are rare, accounting for less than 1% of all laryngeal neo-
plasms. Despite being a part of the supraglottis, the epiglottis is rarely
reported as the primary site of laryngeal lymphoma and it is even more
uncommon to have a primary presentation of sudden death by tumour
obstruction of the airways.

Autopsy findings in SARS-CoV-2 “molecular healing”
V.P. Fabbri*
*Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of
Bologna, Italy
Background & objectives: Data on histopathological changes in
autopsied patients who eradicated severe acute respiratory syndrome co-
ronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are very limited.
Methods: Autopsy of a patient who died after 51 days of COVID-19 was
performed.
During his long-time hospitalization nasopharyngeal swab turned
negative.
Results: Microscopic examination showed pathological changes in several
organs: acute or organising diffuse alveolar damage with fibrosis in the
lungs, brain ischemic injury, superimposed bacterial meningitis, sparse
microthrombi and focal myocarditis with focal myocardiosclerosis.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in lung specimen.
Conclusion: The possibility of systemic long-term effects of COVID-19
are highlighted.

*Pathology Department, Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Centro
Hospitalar e Universitário Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) complex infection. Usually affects
the lungs, but it can affect any organ. Milliary TB is a disseminated form.
In the recent decades, in Portugal, the incidence of TB has steadily
decreased.
Methods: A 79-year old man was admitted to our hospital two weeks
after the onset of asthenia and anorexia. An X-ray was done and a milliary
pattern was found. MT infection was not confirmed either by PCR and
IGRA. The patient was hospitalized, dying after 26 days. Autopsy was
performed. At this point two MT cultures were pending.
Results: Autopsy main gross finding was a pulmonary milliary pattern
with multiple small nodules 1-2mm in the lungs, compatible with milliary
Virchows Arch
TB. On histological examination, necrotizing granulomas were observed
in almost every organ: lung, liver, adrenal glands, spleen, mediastinal
lymph nodes and the bone marrow. The presence of alcohol acid resistant
bacillus was confirmed by the Ziehl-Neelsen stain. After the necropsy
study, the cultures in urine and lung confirmed MT infection.
Conclusion: Although considered a rare disease in some countries,
awareness and suspicion for MT should be present, even with negative
results, thus every autopsy must be performed according to biosafety
protocols.

A case of fatal retroperitoneal hematoma after delivery in a young
woman with neurofibromatosis
M. Genadieva-Yordanova*, Y. Topalov, A. Vlahova
*Aleksandrovska Hospital, Bulgaria
Background & objectives: Retroperitoneal hematoma is a rare complica-
tion after delivery. One unusual predisposing condition, associated with
increased risk for vascular abnormalities is neurofibromatosis.
Hemodynamic andendocrine changesassociatedwithpregnancyhavebeen
suggested to be contributing factors by worsening pre-existing aneurysms.
Methods: Patient with known neurofibromatosis had multiple tan
coloured skin nodules, scoliosis and a small adrenal gland tumour.
Massive hematoma in the left retroperitoneal space was discovered with
an estimated volume of 2.5 L. No abnormalities were found during the
detailed gross examination of the aorta and renal arteries. A possible
rupture of mesenteric vascular malformation was considered.
Results: Histology revealed the skin nodules to be neurofibromas and the
adrenal tumour – pheochromocytoma, the latter being frequent incidental
finding in neurofibromatosis.
Conclusion: Although a rare syndrome, we should increase our aware-
ness of the possible complication in patients with neurofibromatosis,
because many of them present as nonspecific signs, which can lead to a
fatal delay in the treatment.

Features of lung damage in case of combined COVID-19 infection
and HIV: a clinical case
E. Guryanova*, O. Vorobyeva, D. Lastochkina, N. Zhuravleva
*I. N. Ulianova Chuvash State University, Russia
Background & objectives: As HIV progresses, it infects an increasing
number of CD4 + T-lymphocytes, over time their number reaches critical
values. The aim of this study is to describe a case of COVID-19 infection
in a patient with HIV infection.
Methods: A histopathological study of tissue samples of the lungs, spleen
and brain of a 42-year-old HIV-positive patient who died from viral-
bacterial pneumonia with damage to both lungs was carried out.
Results: Histological examination revealed areas of epithelial desquama-
tion, alveolar epithelium and macrophages with viral inclusions in en-
larged nuclei, interalveolar septa thickened due to oedema, mononuclear
infiltration. In the alveoli and alveolar passages, hyaline membranes and
fibrin were revealed along the contour. Areas of necrosis of the alveolar
epithelium with exposure of the basement membrane, signs of pro-
nounced oedema with a haemorrhagic component were determined. In
the lumen of the alveoli there were haemolyzed erythrocytes, in the pul-
monary parenchyma - focal haemorrhages, signs of proliferation of cap-
illary endothelial cells. Cytomegalovirus infection with brain damage, in
which large cytomegalocells with intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions
were found, served as a sign of HIV infection.
Conclusion: The immediate cause of death was a new coronavirus infec-
tion COVID-19 with Klebsiella pneumoniae, which caused bilateral
viral-bacterial pneumonia, complicated by acute respiratory failure. The
presence of a background pathology of HIV infection aggravated the
condition of the patient, and undoubtedly influenced the death outcome.

Morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of the lungs
with a combination of coronavirus infection and sarcoidosis in a
patient
E. Guryanova*, O. Vorobyeva, D. Lastochkina
*I. N. Ulianova Chuvash State University, Russia
Background & objectives: The coronavirus type 2 SARS-CoV-2 con-
tinues to spread, affecting the health and lives of millions of people
around the world. In persons with concomitant diseases, it progresses to
pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ
failure.
Methods: We present 2 clinical cases of COVID-19 infection associated
with pulmonary sarcoidosis and coronary artery disease in patients aged
44 and 63 years. Both patients were not connected to Intermittent forced
ventilation apparatus. A histopathological and immunohistochemical
study of tissue samples of the lungs and heart was carried out.
Results: Histological examination of lung samples shows: totally des-
quamated epithelium, haemorrhagic exudate, and a few multinucleat-
ed cells were determined in the lumen of all alveoli. During histolog-
ical examination, epithelioid-cellular granulomas ranging in size 2-8
mm, consisting of epithelioid, giant cells and lymphocytes, were lo-
cated in the lungs. Granulomas with a proliferative component, with
signs of coagulation necrosis and with areas of haemorrhage were
determined. Revealed giant cells with cytoplasmic inclusions - aster-
oid bodies and Schaumann's little bodies. In the immunohistochemical
study, lymphocytes were detected in the central sections of the gran-
ulomas CD-4, and CD-8 lymphocytes were found in the peripheral
zone. In bifurcated lymph nodes 17-24 mm, granulomas were
detected.
Conclusion: Pulmonary sarcoidosis and coronary heart disease have ag-
gravated the course of bilateral viral pneumonia when infected with the
new coronavirus infection Covid-19. Comorbidities in Covid-19 patients
reduce the chances of recovery.

Rare clinical case: coronavirus infection and dissecting aortic
aneurysm
E. Guryanova*, O. Vorobyeva, D. Lastochkina, A. Lastochkin
*I. N. Ulianova Chuvash State University, Russia
Background & objectives: Analysis of patient mortality data from
COVID-19 showed that the most common comorbidity is arterial hyper-
tension. There have been reports of a significantly higher risk of adverse
outcomes in this group of patients.
Methods: An analysis of the pathological material of a man who died
from COVID-19 pneumonia associated with dissecting aortic aneurysm
against the background of arterial hypertension is presented. Histological
structures of the lungs, aortic walls were examined with haematoxylin-
eosin and immunohistochemical methods.
Results: Macroscopically, on the posterior wall of the aorta, an athero-
sclerotic plaque in the stage of atheromatosis and calcification with ulcer-
ation was determined, measuring 1.5x1x0.5 cm, at the border of the
plaque there was a stellate defect of the 1.1 cm wall with uneven edges,
the gap led to the wall of the aorta and the thickness of the pericardium. T.
intima is yellow with more than 50% of the aortic area affected by ath-
erosclerotic plaques in the fibrosis stage. An immunohistochemical study
of elastin showed pronounced fragmentation of elastic fibres.
Inflammatory infiltrate in the area of t. adventicii aorta and vasa vasorum
consisted of CD3, CD20, and CD68.
Conclusion: It is known that vasa vasorum macrophages, T-lymphocytes
and endotheliocytes are of great importance in the formation of aneu-
rysms. Thus, the main cause of death was a dissecting aortic aneurysm
according to Stanford - type A, according to DeBakey - type II. The
associated viral pneumonia aggravated the course of the disease and
affected the death.

Pericardial effusion leading to cardiac tamponade secondary to
Graft-versus-Host Disease. Autopsy findings
J.M. Macias Fernandez*
*Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocío-
University of Seville, Spain
Background & objectives: Pericardial Effusion is a rare cardiac compli-
cation (occurring in 1% of patients)1 described in patients undergoing
Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant2. This complication is
considered to be a manifestation of chronic Graft-versus-host disease1,
which may contribute to significant post-transplant morbidity.
Methods: The patient was a 36-year-old woman who presented to
Hodgkin’s Lymphoma in 2018, Nodular Sclerosis variant. After 5 cycles
of chemotherapy without response, undergoes allogenic transplantation.
Four months later, the patient is diagnosed by Graft versus Host Disease.
In 2020, two days before admission, the patient began with disuria,
haematuria and abdominal pain. At 24 hours after admission, hyper-
transaminasemia and decreased conscience level. The patient died 4 days
after admission.
Results: Gross examination during autopsy revealed 200ml of clear se-
rous fluid from the pericardium. The peritoneal surfaces were smooth and
shiny. On microscopic examination revealed skin: histomorphological
alterations compatible with graft-versus-host-disease(GVHD)grade II.
Lung: Marked vascular congestión with intraalveolar hematic extravasa-
tion. Pericardium: reactive mesotelial cells and lymphocytic inflammato-
ry infiltrate. Spleen: Intraparenchymal haemorrhage. COVID-19, Blood
cultivation and cerebrospinal fluid were studied with negative results.
Conclusion: It is unlikely that an infection or drug toxicity had a role in
the development of pericardial effusion. In this patient the median time to
post-transplant pericardial effusion development was 2 years where the
serosa and the skin were the only site of GVHD exacerbation without
involvement of other organs. It's possible that the inflammatory process
involving the pericardium was caused by immune-mediated mechanisms
most likely associated with GVHD but no direct evidence exists to prove
pericardial effusion were a manifestation of GVHD.

A case report of giant-cell myocarditis diagnosed on autopsy
M. Madentzoglou*
*Department of Clinical Pathology, Linköping University, Sweden
Background & objectives: Giant-cell myocarditis is an unusual cause of
death which often presents as rapidly evolving congestive heart failure.
Histologic findings include myocardial necrosis, multinucleated giant
cells, and mixed inflammatory cell-infiltrate. A case report of giant-cell
myocarditis diagnosed on autopsy presents briefly.
Methods: A 68-year-old man who lived alone, with tablet-treated hyper-
tension, was found dead at home after not having contact with his relatives
for a few days. Circumstances of death raised no suspicion of crime, abuse,
or suicide. Clinical autopsy was conducted to determine the cause of death.
Results: External body inspection revealed no injuries or scars. The find-
ings of internal organs examination were the following: heart with sym-
metrical hypertrophy, weight 540gr. Small isolated whitish areas frontal
and lateral in the right ventricle. Mild but not critical coronary atheroscle-
rosis only focally. Regarding the other organs, mild pulmonary oedema, a
few simple kidneys cysts, enlarged prostate without tumour and general-
ized moderate atherosclerosis were noticed. Microscopic examination
revealed myocardium hypertrophy, perivascular fibrosis and focal
myofiber break-up. Foci with fibrosis, sparse mixed inflammatory cells,
and necrotic myocardial fibres with multinucleated giant cells were
found. No vasculitis, no foreign material, and no evidence for systematic
granulomatous or other inflammation or sarcoidosis were described.
Conclusion: Histological findings of heart described above gave rise to
suspicion of giant-cell myocarditis, an unusual cause of death. The
aetiology is unclear, idiopathic, drug-associated, or viral cause have been
described. Multinucleated giant-cell formation can also occur rarely in
myocardial infarction. Desmin immunostaining is then positive in the
multinucleated giant-cells supporting multinuclear myogenic giant cell
formation under myocardial infraction. In this case myocardial infraction
considered less likely due to the absence of critical stenos in coronary
arteries.

Fatal invasive fungal infection 21 days after renal transplant: a case
report
G. Nora*, E. Coronato Nogueira Constantino, M.A. Sperto Ferreira
Baptista, S. Longarini Gonçalves
*Hospital de Base/FAMERP, Brazil
Background & objectives: To report a case of fatal invasive fungal
infection 21 days after renal transplant.
Methods: Review of autopsy report and medical record. The case was
analysed both macroscopically and microscopically. The specimens were
submitted to formalin fixation and all the histological processing. The
stains used for the microscopic evaluation of this case were
haematoxylin-eosin and Grocott-Gomori methanamine silver.
Results: Female, 58-year-old, with chronic kidney failure, interned for
kidney transplantation, which occurred without complications.
Immunosuppression was made with tacrolimus, mycophenolate and
prednisone. On the thirteenth postoperative day, she presented dyspnoea
and progressed to cardiorespiratory arrest. In the intensive care unit, there
was no clinical improvement and she died 21 days after transplant.
During the autopsy, native kidneys were markedly atrophic and irregular,
while renal graft had usual macroscopic appearance. It was also observed
lung congestion and oedema. Microscopic evaluation showed extensive
areas of necrosis of lung parenchyma. Candida albicans were observed in
the form of yeasts and hyphae at the oesophagus and lungs. There was a
phenomenon of angioinvasion.
Conclusion: Approximately 5% of infections in renal transplant patients
are caused by fungi. Candida, Aspergillus, Mucorales and Cryptococcus
species are the most-common opportunistic fungi that causes infection.
The most unusual and unexpected fact of this case is the time between
kidney transplantation and infection. The data found in the literature
indicate an average period for such an event which varies from 103 days
to 18.35 months. On average, the gap between infection and an outcome
(recovery/death/graft loss), is approximately 2 months.

M. Mnikhovich, A. Romanov*, T. Bezuglova, T. Sotnikova, D.
Pastukhova, D. Kushch, E. Rusina, L. Leonova
*Research Institute of Human Morphology, Russia
Background & objectives: Kaposi's sarcoma is a malignant vascular
tumour which affecting elderly patients. This tumour is associated with
herpes simplex virus type 8 and immunodeficiency (HIV). But sporadic
HIV negative forms exist. We present two autopsies of patients with HIV-
negative Kaposi's sarcoma.
Methods: Two autopsies of patients with HIV-negative Kaposi's sarcoma
were performed. IHC studies were carried out with CD31, CD34, HHV-8
markers.
Results: Patient X attended to hospital with complaints of weakness and
dyspnoea, later the patient died from pulmonary oedema. Autopsy results:
hepatomegaly with multiple tumour formations, and large lymph nodes.
Histological examination showed chaotic proliferation of spindle-cells
around the newly formed blood vessels. IHC study showed diffuse ex-
pression of CD34, CD31 and focal granular staining of HHV-8.
Patient Y has been treated in a hospital for prostate cancer (Gleason 3 + 3
= 6), which became a cause of his death. Autopsy revealed tumour of the
Virchows Arch
toe of the left foot. Histological examination showed the proliferation of
spindle-cells around young vessels. The IHC study was identical to the
1st case.
Conclusion: HIV-negative Kaposi's sarcomas are sporadically rare tu-
mours that represent medical and social problems, which imply the im-
portance of choosing a treatment strategy for patients with this disease.
These 2 cases expand our understanding of these tumours, and also give
hope for adequate diagnosis and treatment of these groups of patients.

Donskoy
*Pirogov RNRMU, Russia
Background & objectives: COVID-19 is a new coronavirus infection
that is now worldwide. This disease is especially dangerous for the elderly
and people with immunodeficiencies, including cancer patients. We pres-
ent a case of mixed covid 19 infection and visceral candidiasis associated
with Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Methods: An autopsy of patient with Covid-19 and visceral candidiasis
associated with generalized Hodgkin's lymphoma were performed. IHC
studies were carried out with CD20, CD30, CD45 markers.
Results: Patient X attended to hospital with complaints of weakness and
dyspnoea, later the patient died from necrotic enterocolitis. Autopsy
showed hepatomegaly, interstitial pneumonia, small subepithelial
haemorrhages with white foci in the oesophagus. Necrotizing enterocoli-
tis has also been observed.
Histological examination showed diffuse alveolar damage with peripher-
al candida-granulomas, diffuse liver infiltration with atypical lympho-
cytes, including Reed-Sternberg cells and Hodgkin cells, and candida-
granulomas. In the oesophagus, superficial candidiasis is presented.
There is necrotizing enterocolitis in the colon. There is also a lymphoid
infiltrate of atypical cells, including Reed-Strenberg cells and Hodgkin
cells In the lymph nodes.
IHC study was carried out. Positive expression of CD20, CD30 and
CD45 markers was observed.
Conclusion: Covid19-associated mixed infections are of increased inter-
est due to the novelty and prevalence of the disease. Patients with cancer
require special attention to prevent adverse outcomes and improve treat-
ment success.

Bilateral breast cancer; a five-year histopathological review of a rare
entity in a resource limited setting
K. Adoke*, M. Sanusi Haruna
*Department of Pathology Federal Medical Center Birnin Kebbi, Nigeria
Background & objectives: Bilateral breast cancer (BBC) can be synchro-
nous and metachronous. It accounts for 2-6% of breast cancers. Before es-
tablishing BBC, metastatic carcinoma to the contralateral breast must be ruled
out. We review five cases of BBC over a five-year period (2016-2020).
Methods: Five cases of BBC were retrieved from our archives.
Information was extracted from the patient’s case notes. Paraffin blocks
were cut and stained with routine H&E stain. Four immunohistochemical
markers were used (ER, PR, Her2 and E-cadherin). Data was analysed
using SPSS version 24.
Results: The age range of patients with BBC was 45-65 years with a
mean age of 55.6±8.2. Three cases were synchronous while two were
metachronous base on duration of symptoms before diagnosis. Histology
of both breasts showed only two patients with BBC had the same histol-
ogy of invasive lobular carcinoma in both breast while, the remaining
three had invasive ductal histology NOS in one breast and apocrine or
neuroendocrine differentiation in the other breast. Hormonal profile was
variable. Two patients had triple negative hormonal profile while two
were Her2 positive with a single case of ER positivity. Metastasis to the
axillary lymph node was seen in two patients.
Conclusion: BBC is rare in our setting, although it is difficult to rule out
local metastasis to the contralateral breast in some cases, those with local
or metastatic disease are at a higher risk of having metastatic disease.
Genomic studies are needed in such cases since BBC are genetically
likely to be non-identical.

Encapsulated papillary carcinoma with axillary lymph node
macrometastasis, diagnosed after COVID-19 vaccination
L. Ali*, R. Alaghehbandan, O. Ginghina, M. Valentin Tiberiu
*'Carol Davila' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest,
Romania
Background & objectives: Encapsulated papillary carcinoma (EPC) of
the breast is a rare entity accounting for 0.5 to 1% of all breast carcinomas.
We report the case of a 66-year-old woman diagnosed with an EPC with
axillary lymph node macrometastasis, post COVID-19 vaccination.
Methods: The patient was vaccinated in February 2021. The next day
after the vaccination, she complained about pain in the left breast. The
mammogram and CT showed a breast lesion classified as BI-RADS 4c,
and an enlarged axillary lymph node. The patient underwent biopsy and
lymph node FNA, both positive for malignancy, followed by radical
mastectomy with axillary dissection.
Results: Gross examination showed a 9x6 cm mass consisting of aggre-
gated nodules, displaying cystic spaces. Histologically, the tumour was
composed of papillary structures, lined by a low-grade monomorphic
population of neoplastic cells and scant mitotic figures, surrounded by a
thick fibrous capsule. Myoepithelial cell lining was absent (confirmed by
p63 and SMA). Tumour cells were positive for ER, PR, while negative
for Her-2/neu. The ki67 index was 10%. One of 23 lymph nodes showed
a macrometastasis. The morphological and immunohistochemical fea-
tures were compatible with EPC (with no areas of conventional invasion),
Oncotype DX showed 0 recurrence score and no chemotherapy benefit.
On follow-up, the patient is disease-free to date (3 months).
Conclusion: EPC is usually characterized by slow growth and good
prognosis. However, the indolent behaviour impairs early detection, and
in the absence of noticeable symptoms, for the present case, the COVID-
19 vaccine enabled uncovering the tumour. Notable features of the case
include the large size, multinodular appearance of the tumour, and axil-
lary lymph node metastasis. Tumour's overall management is adequate
local therapy, but for high-grade lesions, triple-negative or HER2-positive
phenotype, the management is similar to invasive tumours.

Breast hamartoma in a young male patient, accompanying vascular
and adipose tissue lesions
A.H. Aydin*, A. Çolak
*Ankara City Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Hamartoma is a benign tumour of the breast,
formed from all components of breast tissue. There have been less than 5
cases in men reported up to now. Gynecomastia may obscure this condi-
tion in men, and hamartomas could be overlooked.
Methods: A 21-year-old man consulted general surgery clinic with the
complaint of gynecomastia. Bilateral breast reduction was applied.
Histology of the biopsies revealed vascular lesions consistent with arte-
riovenous malformation, nerves and Pacinian corpuscles, accompanied
by fibrous stromal and adipose tissue. Pseudoangiomatous stromal
Virchows Arch
hyperplasia was also present. Around the lesion, congested vascular
structures were seen in groups of adipocytes.
Results: Histomorphologic evidences were interpreted as hamartoma
with arteriovenous malformation and angiolipoma in both specimens.
In this case, the existence of bilateral hamartoma with arteriovenous mal-
formation accompanying brought angiolipoma Cowden syndrome to our
mind. Most of them are sporadic, but multiple hamartomas can be seen in
Cowden syndrome as well. Cowden syndrome, (a. k. a.) PTEN
hamartoma tumour syndrome (PHTS), is a group of disorders with auto-
somal dominant inheritance caused by PTEN germline mutation of the
PTEN gene. It is characterized by multiple hamartomas and a predispo-
sition to cancer such as breast, thyroid, renal cell and colon cancers.
Conclusion: Hamartoma is a benign tumour which has an excellent
prognosis. However, it can indicate a high cancer risk especially for the
patients having multiple hamartomas.

A case report on metastatic ileal neuroendocrine tumour to the
breast mimicking primary mammary carcinoma
S. Bakhiet*, J. Ansett, C. Axe, M. Rourke, J. Cooke, A. Elhag
*Hull University Hospital, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Metastases from extramammary tumours to
breast are rare and metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms to breast account
for approximately 1% of all metastatic breast neoplasms. These may be
misdiagnosed as triple negative primary breast cancers if there is no
relevant clinical history.
Methods: Case: We present an unusual case of a 72-year-old female
patient with an 11mm mammography-detected lesion in the right breast
(R4 U4). There was no additional background history was given. The
core biopsies were sent for histology.
Results: Histological investigation revealed a malignant epithelial neo-
plasm with acinar and cribriform architecture and neuroendocrine mor-
phology. There was no in-situ component and there was no
lymphovascular invasion. Molecular markers (ER, PR and Her2) were
all negative. An additional panel of immunostains revealed positive neu-
roendocrine markers (CD56, Chromogranin, and Synaptophysin) and
positivity for the hindgut marker CDX2. The tumour cells were entirely
negative for GATA3, TTF-1, CK7, and CK20. Further exploration of the
patient’s clinical history at the breast MDT revealed a previous sigmoid
adenocarcinoma in 2006 and a history of ileal carcinoid tumour in 2012.
The appearances were considered most in-keeping with metastatic ileal
neuroendocrine neoplasm to the breast.
Conclusion: The take-home messages from this case were: To rule out
breast metastasis to breast in triple negative carcinomas that arise in the
breast but have no accompanying in-situ component. To explore the clin-
ical history more fully and discuss at breast Multi-Disciplinary Team meet-
ing. To use an appropriate panel of immunostains to clarify the diagnosis.
Identifying metastatic tumours to breast on core biopsy is crucial for the
subsequent management and avoiding unnecessary surgery.

The role of immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of lymphocytoma
cutis in the breast – a rare and challenging entity

Nicolau, O. Cojocaru
*Clinical Service of Pathology, “Sf. Apostol Andrei” Emergency County
Hospital, Constanţa, Romania / Center for Research and Development of
the Morphological and Genetic Studies of Malignant Pathology,
“Ovidius” University of Constanţa, Romania
Background & objectives: Lymphocytoma cutis (cutaneous lymphoid
hyperplasia/cutaneous pseudolymphoma) is a rare disease which affect
the dermis. Breast localization of this lesion is an extremely rare event and
rise difficulties in established a correct diagnosis since its morphological
features resemble with cutaneous lymphoma
Methods: We report a rare case of lymphocytoma cutis in the left upper-
outer quadrant of breast, in a 7th decade woman. The patient presented
with a poorly defined nodular lesion and with a BI-RADS score of 4 on
radiologic evaluation. Tumorectomy was performed and surgical speci-
men was evaluated by morphological immunohistochemical characteris-
tics. Immunohistochemistry was performed with a panel of seven
antibodies.
Results: Morphologically, the tumour was composed by a lymphoid
proliferation within the dermis of the skin and extended into the breast
parenchyma and no involvement of the epidermis. There was a nodular,
follicular pattern with polarized germinal centres. Immunohistochemistry
was performed mainly to ruled out a low-grade cutaneous B-cell lympho-
ma diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry highlighted a B-cell lymphoid pro-
liferation, a specific immunostaining for a normal germinal centre
(CD20+, CD5-, CD10+, BCL6+, BCL2-) and a positive reaction for
CD23, which highlighted the meshwork of follicular dendritic cells. It
was also observed a population of reactive T lymphocytes and a normal
pattern of KI67 expression. These immunoreactions established the diag-
nosis of follicular pseudolymphoma.
Conclusion: A diagnosis of lymphocytoma cutis or pseudolymphoma of
Spiegler–Fendt in the breast is a difficult one that raises challenges in
establishing a correct diagnosis, but immunohistochemistry is a major
help and mandatory for excluding a malignant lymphoid proliferation.
Its treatment consists mainly in surgical removal of the lesion and it has
a favourable clinical evolution.

M. Mokni
*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast is a
heterogeneous group of breast carcinoma characterized by squamous dif-
ferentiation or mesenchymal looking elements, including spindle,
chondroid and osseous cells. The aim of our study is to highlight the
clinicopathological characteristics of MC.
Methods: We report a retrospective study of 7 cases of metaplastic car-
cinoma of the breast, over a period of 2015 and 2020, obtained from files
of Pathology Department of Farhat Hached University Hospital, Sousse,
Tunisia.
Results: The average age of patients was 49.2 years. The mean size of
tumours was 4.56 cm with extremities ranged between 2.2 and 11 cm.
There were 5 cases with squamous component, one case with chondroid
component and one case with squamous, chondroid and osseous compo-
nents. There were 4 cases of luminal B type. 4 tumours were classified as
stage I and 2 were stage III.
Conclusion: Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast is a rare and aggressive
tumour that occurs in 0.2% to 1% of all breast carcinomas. It affects females
over 50 years. It is composed of a mixed group of neoplasms containing
both glandular and non-glandular patterns with epithelial and/or mesenchy-
mal components. Metaplastic carcinoma carries a poor prognosis with a
low rate of axillary involvement and high potential for distant metastases.

*Department of Pathology, Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Ki-67 in breast carcinoma is a biomarker that
was demonstrated to be beneficial in determining the tumour behaviour
including tumour size, stage, grading and patient survival. We aim to
investigate to correlation between Ki-67 and the other prognostic factors
in breast carcinoma (BC).
Methods: This retrospective study included all cases of invasive
breast carcinoma diagnosed in the Pathology department of Habib
Thameur Hospital between 2016 and 2020.All histopathology re-
ports reviewed for data regarding age, tumour size, histological
type, glandular differentiation, nuclear pelomorphism, mitotic count,
SBR grade, tumour and lymph node stage, lymphovascular and
perineural invasion, oestrogen, progesterone and HER2 status, and
molecular classification.
Results: A total of 60 women was included. The average age was 52
±13.28 years. The mean tumour size was 3.63 ±2.38 cm. We diagnosed
45 invasive BC of no specific type,9 lobular carcinomas, 6mixed carcino-
mas ductal and lobular and one papillary carcinoma. Ki67 was ≥20% in 34
cases (33.01%). The molecular status was luminal A in 19 patients, lumi-
nal B in 29 patients, HER2 in 6 patients and triple negative in 6 patients.
A statistically significant association was revealed between ki67 index
and SBR grade (p=0.004), mitotic count (p=0.04), perineural invasion
(p=0.075), oestrogen status (p=0,036), progesterone status (p=0,037),
HER2 status (p=0,039) and molecular classification(p<0.001).
Conclusion: This single institution study showed that high expression of
Ki-67 is associated with higher pT-stage, higher pN-stage, higher grade,
lymphovascular invasion, ER/PR negativity, HER2 positivity and molec-
ular classification. ThusKi67 index is a valuable biomarker of breast
carcinoma. Its correct assessment is required for an optimal treatment.
The prognostic impact of Ki-67 was only demonstrated for Disease
Free Survival and longer follow-up time may be required to see its effect
on survival outcome.

Acinic cell carcinoma of the breast: a case report of a rare triple
negative breast cancer with unusual clinical course
E. Brown*, H.K. Leung, S. Kouneli, A. Oriolowo, S. Jenkins, E. Toth, A.
Warfield, A.M. Shaaban
*University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) is an excep-
tionally rare triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). It shares morpholog-
ical and immunohistochemical similarities with the counterpart tumour of
the salivary gland, although molecular studies have shown that they prob-
ably constitute unrelated diseases.
Methods: A 37-year-old woman presented with a palpable breast lump.
She had no previous history of malignancy. Ultrasonography showed
three superficial hyperechoic heterogeneous nodules together spanning
40mm in the upper outer quadrant, U3. Following two needle core biop-
sies, mammography and MRI investigations, she proceeded to mastecto-
my with sentinel node biopsy.
Results: Histology showed an infiltrative neoplasm composed of tightly
packed acini containing luminal secretions lined by atypical epithelial
cells, with mitotic activity and eosinophilic granular cytoplasm.
Atypical microglandular adenosis (MGA)-like areas were seen at the
periphery of the neoplasm. The tumour was triple negative. The tumour
was GATA-3, S100, SOX10, and lysozyme, alpha1 antitrypsin positive,
with PASD positive cytoplasmic granules. Molecular analysis, including
NTRK immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR for IDH1, IDH2 and
PIK3CA were performed to exclude secretory carcinoma and tall cell
carcinoma with reversed polarity, respectively.
Three months following the first biopsy the patient developed a chest wall
recurrence and underwent a further wide local excision and axillary node
sampling.
Conclusion: ACC is an exceedingly rare type of low grade TNBC that is
generally associated with indolent behaviour. This case, however,
showed an unusual clinical outcome with early recurrence.
The association with atypical microglandular adenosis is interesting as
both lesions have been found to share similar molecular abnormalities,
which supports their clonal relationship. Molecular testing can help es-
tablish the diagnosis of this challenging entity and differentiate from
mimics particularly secretory carcinoma and tall cell carcinoma with re-
versed polarity.

Breast carcinoma in a male with type 1 neurofibromatosis
P.M. Bueno Ortiz*, F. Granados Pacheco, M.E. Galán García, M.
Andújar Sánchez, M. González Afonso
*Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular Materno Infantil, Las
Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain
Background & objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal
dominant disorder characterized by the appearance of cafe au lait
spots, neurofibromas and Lisch nodules and it is associated with in-
creased risk for several neural and non-neural malignancies, as breast
carcinomas.
Methods: We present the case of a 55-year-old male with type 1 neuro-
fibromatosis, with multiple resections of neurofibromas in skin and in
spinal cord. This patient had a bleeding lesion in right nipple that was
removed and sent to our department. We received fragments of breast
tissue with skin ulcerated and under that, a white and solid lesion.
Results: Histologically, we saw a malignant neoplasm poorly differenti-
ated with solid, tubular and ductal patterns, that ulcerated the skin surface
and had vascular and perineural invasion, with a high mitotic index (25
mitosis/HPF) and high nuclear pleomorphism.
Immunohistochemically, the neoplasm was positive intense and diffuse
for EMA, CK19, GATA3 and oestrogen receptors, focally for p40, p63,
GCDFP-15, CEA and progesterone receptors and negative for CK7,
CK20, CK5/6, D2-40, S100, CDX2, TTF1 and synapofisine, with a
Ki67 index of 70 %. So, we diagnosed that neoplasm as a poorly differ-
entiated breast carcinoma G3 with images of cribiform ductal carcinoma
in situ grade II, without necrosis.
Conclusion: The link between NF1 and breast cancer has recently been
established, with patients with NF1 being at higher risk for developing
breast cancer, more likely to get breast cancer at a younger age, and more
likely to have their breast cancer present with more adverse prognostic
factors.
The concurrent presentation of type 1 neurofibromatosis and male breast
cancer is a very rare phenomenon with only a handful of case descriptions
in the literature.

Fibroepithelial lesions of the breast: are we up to the challenge? A
case report
S. Carralas Antunes*, C. Dahlstedt-Ferreira, J. da Cunha Oliveira, R.
Rosas, C. Pereira, D. Travancinha, M.J. Brito
*Hospital Garcia de Orta, Portugal
Background & objectives: Fibroepithelial lesions of the breast are a
heterogeneous group of biphasic tumours that include the common be-
nign fibroadenomas and the relatively rare phyllodes tumours (PT). They
have a wide prognostic variability, being their management based upon
histological diagnosis and classification.
Methods: A 46-year-old woman presented in mid-2019 with a palpable
breast mass felt for over one year. She underwent radiological investiga-
tion that revealed a heterogeneous, polylobulated mass, with 6.7x4.5cm.
A core needle biopsy was performed. It showed a fibroadenoma with
pericanalicular pattern. She was lost to follow-up, reappearing in 2021
with an ulcerated extensive lesion occupying the totality of the breast.
Virchows Arch
Results: Grossly, the mastectomy specimen measured 20x13x6cm and
weighted 1028g. The cut surface revealed a well-circumscribed
multinodular solid grey tumour, with necrotic foci. It measured
12x12x8cm and was coincidental with the superficial, superior and inter-
nal margins. Microscopically, it presented as a biphasic proliferation, with
epithelial and stromal components, with a leaf-like pattern and clefts, and
benign chondroid heterologous elements. It had expansive growth, with
mild-to-moderate nuclear atypia and 10 mitoses/10 High Power Fields.
Stromal overgrowth was not identified. These histological parameters
defined the lesion as a borderline PT (according to Breast Tumours
WHO 5th edition - 2019).
Conclusion: We highlight the challenge in distinguishing between a PT
and fibroadenoma. Although clear diagnostic criteria are established, their
morphological similarities result in significant inter-observer variability,
as reported in recent studies. Moreover, the inherent limitations of core
biopsies specimens’ favours surgical excision as the preferred procedure,
as it allows negative margins to be obtained in the event that the final
diagnosis is a PT, as margin status at excision is the most reliable predic-
tor of recurrence. A close follow-up is mandatory.

The problematic diagnosis of metastatic dyscohesive cell lesions: in-
cidental finding in cholecystectomy specimen
A.M. Ciongariu*, A. Dumitru, M. Sajin, M. Costache, A. Gont, M.
Mergeanu, S. Gradinaru, C. Alius, A. Birceanu
*University Emergency Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Metastatic breast carcinoma in the gallblad-
der is an infrequent occurrence, strongly associated with the lobular type.
Our purpose is to gain further knowledge about this phenomenon and
dyscohesive cell tumours, emphasizing the importance of immunohisto-
chemical staining for an accurate diagnosis.
Methods: The Department of Pathology received a cholecystectomy
specimen, samples from which were fixed with 10% buffered formalin
and were processed by conventional histopathological methods, using
paraffin embedding, sectioning and Haematoxylin–Eosin (HE) staining.
Afterwards, the sections were deparaffinized and prepared for immuno-
histochemical staining, the following markers having been used: Ki 67,
PR, ER and HER2.
Results: We present a 65 years-old female with no significant medical
history who presented with biliary dyskinesia for which she underwent a
cholecystectomy. Gross examination revealed no particular aspects. The
microscopic examination identified multiple small dyscohesive cells
displaying a targetoid pattern in the muscular and serous layers. The
aforementioned cells exhibited high N/C ratio, basophilic nuclei with
moderate nuclear pleomorphism, visible nucleoli, eosinophilic cyto-
plasm, which could easily have been misinterpreted as chronic inflamma-
tory infiltrate on a low power field. The immunohistochemical staining
revealed positive oestrogen and progesterone receptors markers, negative
HER2 and Ki67 positive in 16% of the malignant cell population. Thus,
the diagnosis of metastatic lobular breast carcinoma was established.
Conclusion: Dyscohesive cell carcinomas seldom metastasize in the gall-
bladder, the most frequent metastatic cholecystic tumour being represent-
ed by the malignant melanoma. However, breast carcinoma, especially
the lobular histological type, may be associated with such clinical events.
Given the dyscohesive character of the cells in such lesions, we empha-
size the importance of immunohistochemical staining, as well as the
necessity of clinical and imaging data in the differential diagnosis with
poorly cohesive gastric carcinoma.

Metaplastic breast carcinoma with extensive chondrosarcomatous
differentiation
A. Dumitru*, S. Grădinaru, C. Alius, M. Sajin, M. Costache, A.M.
Ciongariu
*Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Romania
Background & objectives: Metaplastic carcinomas are aggressive het-
erogeneous groups of tumours characterized by a biphasic proliferation of
adenocarcinoma with dominant areas of spindle cell, squamous, or mes-
enchymal differentiation. Metaplastic breast carcinoma is very rare, and
metaplastic carcinoma with chondrosarcomatous differentiation is even
rarer
Methods: In primary breast tumours, chondrosarcomatous lesions may
occur in three different forms: a pure extra skeletal chondrosarcoma, as a
heterologous component of a malignant phyllodes tumour or as a
chondrosarcomatous differentiation in a metaplastic carcinoma. In rare
cases, part or all of the carcinomatous epithelium is transformed into a
nonglandular mesenchymal tissue.
Results: We report a case of a 67-year-old woman with metaplastic
carcinoma with extensive chondrosarcomatous component that was chal-
lenging to diagnose. The tumour was characterized by major
chondromyxoid matrix with few areas suggestive for peculiar
osteosarcomatous differentiation. The area of classic high grade invasive
ductal carcinoma was minimal. Tumour cells in the chondrosarcomatous
areas were diffusely immunoreactive for S-100 protein, negative for
cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen. Tumour cells in carcinoma-
tous areas were diffusely positive for cytokeratin, had patchy S-100 ex-
pression and were triple negative for prognostic markers (ER, PR and
Her2/neu). In both areas, tumour cells were negative for smooth muscle
actin and CD34, while p53 was overexpressed.
Conclusion: Postoperatively, the patient received 6 cycles of chemother-
apy and external radiation therapy. The patient was doing well at the 7-
month postoperative follow-up, without evidence of tumour recurrence or
metastasis.
We emphasize that careful and extensive sampling is mandatory
when dealing with breast tumours with chondroid differentiation.
Immunohistochemistry is essential. Immunomarkers such as cytokeratin,
S100 and SMA are most helpful to differentiate metaplastic carcinoma
from malignant phyllodes tumour and other primary sarcoma of the
breast.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast. A case report and literature
review
G. Galanopoulos*, L. Karelis, E. Souka, G. Stanc, V. Tselepidis, O.
Tzaida
*Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: Adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) are ma-
lignant epithelial tumours that more often occur in salivary glands.
Primary ACC of the breast occurs rarely, accounting for 0.06% of ACC
cases. We report a case of mammary ACC.
Methods: A 59-year-old female patient presented with a painful right
breast swelling. Ultrasonography and mammography showed a 13cm
mass. FNA was positive and a total mastectomy was performed. The
dissection of the right breast specimen revealed a 13cm multilobular mass
below the nipple with a greyish white cut surface, resulting in partial
ulceration of the nipple area.
Results: Histopathological examination revealed a tumour consisting of
nests of cells with well-formed ducts and tubules, lined by inner epithelial
and outer myoepithelial cell layer and pseudolumens filled with basophil-
ic stromal matrix material, PAS- diastase resistant. Immunohistochemical
stains were positive for CK7, c-kit regarding the epithelial component and
positive for CK14, p63, calponin, CD10 regarding the myoepithelial
cells. The Ki67 mitotic index was 5%. ER, PR and HER2 were negative.
The morphological and immunohistochemical results established the di-
agnosis of ACC.
Conclusion: ACC is an unusual type of breast carcinoma accounting for

of luminal and basaloid cells with pseudolumens filled with basement
membrane material. The mean age at diagnosis is 66 years. Almost all
cases are classified as triple-negative tumours. Nodal metastases are un-
common. The prognosis is excellent in contrast to the aggressive nature of
the counterpart salivary gland tumours.

Invasive Paget disease in young patient: a rare case report
H. Gunel*, T. Soylemez Akkurt, A. Aydin, E. Sen
*Istanbul Medeniyet University Prof. Dr. Suleyman Yalcin City Hospital
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Mammary Paget disease (MPD) is a well-
known clinical and pathological neoplastic entity in the nipple. This dis-
ease may be associated with in-situ or invasive breast carcinoma. Invasion
of mammary Paget cells into the dermis is extremely rare.
Methods: A 29-year-old woman patient presented with ulcerative and
crusted changes of the nipple. Punch biopsy diagnosis was MPD. The
patient underwent breast-sparing including the nipple-areola complex and
sentinel lymph node biopsy.
Results: On histopathologic evaluation, scattered large tumour cells with
abundant cytoplasm in the epidermis. These tumour cells had large nuclei
and prominent nucleoli. The invasive areas had an identical feature to the
intraepidermal tumour cells. The depth of Paget cell invasion was 4 mm.
Some of the underlying lactiferous ducts showed ductal carcinoma in situ
(DCIS) of solid type, with high-grade nuclei, central necrosis. MPD, in-
vasive MPD and DCIS were negative for both oestrogen receptors and
progesterone receptors and showed diffusely strong membranous immu-
noreactivity for HER2. There was no myoepithelial cell around the dermal
tumour cells by three myoepithelial markers. Histomorphological and
immunohistochemical findings were suggestive for invasive MPD + high
grade DCIS.
Conclusion: Invasion of MPD tumour cells into the dermis is rare. A
small number of patients have been previously reported with this entity.
The clinical significance of this entity is unknown, and further studies are
required.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma, solid type with basaloid features. Case
report
P. Herreros Fernández-Arroyo*, V. Herrera Montoro, L. Gómez Sánchez,
P. Fernández-Pacheco Sánchez-Migallón, F. Relea Calatayud
*Department of Pathology, University General Hospital of Ciudad Real,
Spain
Background & objectives: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare
malignant tumour in the breast that constitutes less than 0,1 % of all breast
cancer. It is a triple-negative breast cancer with favourable prognosis. We
will report a case of breast ACC.
Methods: A 51-year-old woman, with no medical complaints, underwent
a diagnostic ultrasound scan in which a hypoechoic mass of oval mor-
phology, lobulated borders and hyperechogenic halo was detected in the
internal interquadrants and superointernal quadrant of the right breast
measuring 79 x 61.7 mm. The finding was highly suspicious of malig-
nancy, so it was decided to perform a biopsy.
Results: Several cylinders of breast tissue with a solid neoplastic prolifer-
ation composed of large trabeculae and nests of basaloid cells with
hyperchromatic nuclei and moderate cellular pleomorphism, frequent mi-
toses and a high proliferative index (30%) were observed. The cell nests are
arranged in a focally myxoid stroma with areas of hyalinized stroma with
spaces resembling reduplicated basement membrane material. No duct for-
mation or microcystic spaces are detected and focally there are areas with a
predominance of cells with clear cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical study
of the lesion shows expression for cytokeratin 7 and p53, being focally
positive for c-kit and p63. It does not show staining for CD56, HER2,
oestrogen and progesterone receptors.
Conclusion: The diagnosis is adenoid cystic carcinoma, solid type with
basaloid features. It is characterized by solid nests composed of basaloid
cells, with marked nuclear atypia, high mitotic count, and necrosis.
Axillary node metastases and perineural invasion can be observed.
Differential diagnosis should be made with small cell neuroendocrine
carcinoma and carcinomas with basaloid morphology. Negativity for
neuroendocrine markers can be useful in order to exclude neuroendocrine
carcinoma.

Pure mucinous breast carcinoma in late twenties female: two case
reports
W. Himakhun*, W. Lohitvisate, W. Prasert
*Department of Pathology, Thailand
Background & objectives: Mucinous carcinoma is a rare variant among
invasive breast carcinomas, representing 2% of them. These tumours
mainly present in post-menopausal women. Only 1% present in women
age less than 30 years.
Methods: We report two cases of mucinous carcinoma in a 29-year-old
and a 26-year- old woman.
Results: Case 1 was a 29-year-old woman presented with a well-
circumscribed, slow-growing right breast mass for six months.
Ultrasonographic analysis showed a well-defined hypoechoic mass.
Histologically, the tumour was pure mucinous carcinoma with
micropapillary features. The tumours were positive for hormonal receptors
and negative for HER-2. She was treated with surgical resection, then
hormonal and radiation therapy. Case 2 was a 26-year-old woman who
presented with right breast pain. Physical examination revealed dense
breast tissue without any palpable mass. Mammography of the right breast
showed amorphous and coarse heterogenous microcalcification (BIRADS
4B). Histology findings showed two mucinous carcinomas and one inva-
sive ductal carcinoma. She moved to another hospital for further treatment.
Conclusion: Mucinous carcinomas frequently occur in post-menopausal
women. Only a few cases reported this variant in women younger than 30
years old. Differential diagnoses from clinical findings and imaging anal-
ysis may include benign breast lesions, especially in young women. Due
to slow progression with relatively benign clinical courses, clinicians and
pathologists need to be aware of this rare entity.

*CHU DOUERA, Pathology Department, Algeria
Background & objectives: Breast cancer is the most common in women in
Algierscancerregistry(79cases/100,000/year),1383casesexpected/year.
Aim of this study is to assess the cost of pathology test at Douera univer-
sity hospital in 2016.
Methods: 150 samples sent to our pathology department from 1st
January to 31st December 2016, divided into 128 biopsies, 6 lumpecto-
mies and 26 mastectomies
The evaluation, per patient, of the costs of pathological tests: Hematein
Eosin stain, Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH),
was carried out on the basis of the prices for the year2016.
Results: 140 invasive carcinoma NOS (CI NOS) and 10 lobular carcino-
ma (CLI) were diagnosed out of 1383 cases expected at Algiers (11% of
expected cases)
The total cost for CLI was 178 to 298 euros/ case and that of CI NOS
152.5 to 272.5 euros
The annual needs in our department for this pathology are estimated to
18,700 euros, i.e. 5% of the annual budget allocated for 1.66% of patients.
Virchows Arch
The real needs for ISH at Algiers would be 180-200 tests / year to be
distributed among the 3-4 structures with ISH unit, which would repre-
sent 10 to 12% of the annual budget for < 2% of patients.
Conclusion: The increase in the incidence of breast cancer in Algeria
requires efforts in terms of equipment and reagents in order to be able
to meet the growing demand from clinicians and patients to offer the best
chances of care to our patients.
Economic evaluation of pathology tests must be done to anticipate the
future healthcare needs of our population. The increase incidence in the
coming years could lead to an overload of the capacities of public
services.

*Saitama Medical University, Japan
Background & objectives: Recently, we reported an unusual case with
hematogenous metastases due to a massive tumour embolus from a mam-
mary neuroendocrine tumour. Herein, we describe, to our knowledge, the
first case of an NE neoplasm with extraordinary intra-lymphatic emboli-
zation in the breast.
Methods: The patient, a 46-year-old premenopausal woman, presented
with a painful mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There
was no medical or familial history of breast disease. Ultrasonography
revealed a geographic, hypoechoic left breast area and enlarged regional
lymph nodes. We performed ultrasound-guided, core needle biopsy of the
breast lesion, and the histologic diagnosis was invasive carcinoma.
Results: The cut surface of the mastectomy specimen contained an ill-
defined, greyish-white solid tumour, measuring 23x22 mm.
Histopathologically, the tumour was composed of a solid invasive growth
of carcinoma cells and a highly vascular fibrovascular stroma. Polygonal
carcinoma cells had finely granular cytoplasm and oval or irregularly
shaped nuclei with fine-granular chromatins. Twenty-one mitotic figures
were counted in 10HPFs (histological grade 2). Marked lymphatic per-
meation as well as vascular infiltration were detected. Metastases were
identified in 9 of 17 excised left axillary nodes, with extracapsular exten-
sion. Immunohistochemically, the carcinoma cells in the primary inva-
sive, in situ and intra-lymphatic and metastatic regions were diffusely
positive for synaptophysin and focally positive for chromogranin A.
Conclusion: The rates of carcinoma cells showing reactivity for oestrogen
and progesterone receptors were 99% and 30%, respectively. The HER2
score was estimated to be 1+, and the MIB-1 labelling index was 32.5%.
Although neuroendocrine mammary carcinomas have long been consid-
ered to follow a less aggressive clinical course than unselected breast can-
cers, our present case showed the unusual feature of lymphangitic carcino-
matosis, which is known to be closely associated with poor recurrence-free
and overall survivals as well as a lymphogenous metastasis.

Review of breast cancer grading in a district general hospital
S. Khalid*, M. Gupta
*Imperial College Healthcare NHS, Charing Cross Hospital, United
Kingdom
Background & objectives: Accurate grading of breast cancer is impor-
tant for patient management and prognosis. It should be undertaken for all
types of breast carcinomas. Strict adherence to grading methodology
improves the accuracy and reproducibility of breast cancer grading.
Methods: The distribution and completeness of breast cancer grades at the
department was compared with the national distribution of breast cancer.
The data was obtained using SNOMED codes for all the breast resections
carried out from 1st Jan 2019 – 31st Dec 2019. The grade (either Grade 1,
2, 3 or not assessable) was recorded and collated on an Excel sheet.
Results: A total of 193 breast resections were done in the year with 125
resections carried out for cancer. There were 97 symptomatic and 39
screen detected cancers identified. The breast cancer grade was assigned
in all of the cases (100% compliance). Majority of the cancers were grade
2 (62%) comparable with the national average of 53%, followed by grade
3 (29%). Grade 1 made up 9% of the total cases, below the national
average of 25%. A Nottingham grading score was assigned in most cases
with the exception of 27 cases (19.8%).
Conclusion: There was 100% compliance with recording of grade
(where assessable) in all breast cancer cases. However, there are a lower
proportion of grade 1 breast cancer cases being diagnosed in comparison
with the national average, likely due to lack of record of Nottingham
grading score in all cases. We rectified this by incorporating the grading
score in the breast cancer reporting performa used in the department.

Radiation-associated breast angiosarcoma: features of diagnostics
and treatment (a clinical case)
V. Kometova*, I. Kolyadina, S. Hohlova, V. Rodionov
*V.I. Kulakov NMRC of OGaP, Russia
Background & objectives: Breast angiosarcoma is an extremely rare and
agressive neoplasm from the endothelial cells of blood vessels. Radiation-
associated angiosarcoma (RAAS)of the breast appears 4–7 years after treat-
ment. We report this rare entity as an important complication after breast-
conserving surgery (BCS)and radiotherapy (RT)for breast cancer.
Methods: We present a 62-year-old woman who had underwent BCS
with adjuvant chemotherapy and RT (ROD-2Gy, SOD-50Gy,2D-plan-
ning) in 2015 for the left breast cancer, pT1N1M0, stage IIA, luminal B
HER2-negative subtype. In 2020 she admitted thickening and discolor-
ation of the skin in the area of the postoperative scar. The patient
underwent a simple mastectomy after a biopsy diagnosis was established.
Results: Locally, the left mammary gland with signs of post-radiation
fibrosis. Near the areola, in the area of the postoperative scar, a tumour of
about 1.5 cm in diameter, with rounded edges, purple-cyanotic colour,
towering above the skin surface, inactive, painless, is determined. Gross
examination revealed a solid, well-circumscribed, reddish tumour with a
2x1.5 cm size. Histologically, it was composed of high-nuclear-grade
spindle cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm.
Immunohistochemically, the tumour was negative to ER, PgR, Keratin
Pan, S100, and positive to Vimentin, CD31, FLI1, with a Ki-67 index of
approximately 90%. The tumour was graded according to Rosen's meth-
od. The diagnosis was established as RAAS high-grade.
Conclusion: RAAS is an extremely rare and poorly studied tumour for
which diagnostic and treatment standards have not been developed. The
only radical treatment is its surgical removal. The course of the disease is
extremely aggressive. The most important prognostic factors are the size
of the tumour and the area of skin lesions. The effectiveness of chemo-
therapy for RAAS remains controversial. It is necessary to accumulate the
experience of treating patients with RAAS to develop the most effective
therapeutic and diagnostic algorithm.

*V.I. Kulakov NMRC of OGaP, Russia
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: SRY-related HMG-box 10 protein (SOX10)
is a transcription factor characterising neural crest-derived cells. SOX10
was reported to be preferentially expressed in metaplastic BC. This study
aimed to investigate correlation Sox10 expression with BC clinicopatho-
logical characteristics and lymph nodes status.
Methods: We tested the expression of SOX10 in 358 BC specimens with
used immunohistochemistry (SP267, Spring bioscience, USA). The reac-
tivity assessed was nuclear. SOX10>1% nuclear positivity was consid-
ered as positive. SOX10-positive expression was detected in 22 cases
(6%). Loss of SOX10 expression was predominant in both comparing
groups (with/without lymph nodes metastases - 97.7% and 91.6%,
respectively).
Results: Statistical significant association was found between SOX10
overexpression and patient’s age <50y.o.(HR=9.5,p=0.002); metaplastic
type BC (HR=20.5,p<0.001); Grade3(HR=39.4,p<0.001); Ki-67≥50%
(HR=76.7,p<0.001). There is loss of SOX10 expression in ER and
PgR-positive BC (p<0.001). There was no statistically significant corre-
lation of SOX10 expression with tumour size, number of tumour nodes,
its localization, HER2/neu expression. The transcription factor SOX10 is
expressed in TNBC and is not detected in luminal BC subtypes
(p<0.001). A significant relationship was found between SOX10 expres-
sion and regional metastasis (p=0.0297). In the group without lymph
nodes BC metastases the number of cases with SOX10 overexpression
was higher (19 cases, 8.4%) than in the group with lymph nodes metas-
tases (3 cases,2.3%).
Conclusion: Identification of specific biomarkers is very important for
prediction of regional metastases. We demonstrated that SOX10 expres-
sion is associated with clinicopathological parameters of BC and its
lymph nodes status. Loss of SOX10 expression statistically significantly
reduced risk of lymph nodes metastases (p=0.0297). Sox10 may be used
as a novel reliable putative marker for the diagnosis of metaplastic and
high grade BC, TNBC and lymph nodes metastasis.

Kunovska
*Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Ss.Cyril and Methodius
University in Skopje, North Macedonia
Background & objectives: Melanoma in nipple-areola complex is ex-
tremely rare and in differential diagnosis must be distinguished between
Paget disease, melanoma from extramammary sites and invasive carcino-
mas. We present a case of invasive papillary carcinoma of male nipple
with melanin laden tumour cells.
Methods: A 71-year-old male patient presents with lobulated greyish
tumour of the right nipple measuring 2x1,3cm elevated above the skin
surface 1cm. The lesion was surgically removed with skin excision
0,7x0,5x0,5cm. The specimen was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embed-
ded, routinely stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Additional immuno-
histochemical analysis was performed with CK7, ER, SMA, S-100, and
Melan A.
Results: The gross specimen on cut surface revealed solid, white to
brown tumour, well demarcated at the base and ulceration of overlying
epidermis. Histomorphology of the sections showed papillary structures
with tall columnar cells overlying fibrovascular cores, as well as
micropapillary formations. There were areas of solid and cribriform
growth pattern. Microcalcifications were diffusely present. There were
accumulated melanophages in subepithelial tissue and melanin granules
were also found in tumour cells. Tumour cells were positive for CK7,
with strong and diffuse nuclear stain for ER, with complete absence of
myoepithelial cell on SMA stain. Melan A and S-100 were negative.
Although rare, a diagnosis of pigmented papillary carcinoma was made.
Conclusion: Pigmented carcinomas of breast are rare. When they are
localized in areolar region the diagnosis should be carefully made to
exclude lesions with melanocytic differentiation. The pigmentation
should be considered also as a result by proximity to epidermis. The
distinction between benign and malignant papillary lesions is quite diffi-
cult in most cases. The prognosis of patients with solid papillary carcino-
ma is relatively favourable.

Limitations of tru-cut biopsy in diagnosis of malignant phyllodes
tumour
A.B. Lazar*, M.C. Popelea, O.S. Cotoi, R. Georgescu, S. Turdean
*Mures Clinical County Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Malignant phyllodes is one of the rarest
breast tumours and it is most commonly diagnosed in the elderly popu-
lations, but can also occur in young patients, as reported in this case.
Tru-cut biopsy is a sensitive diagnostic tool for breast cancer.
Methods: A 41-year-old female with no family history of breast cancer
presented with enlarged tender mass which occupied most of the left breast.
Imagistic examination of the left breast revealed a solid tumour formation
with a diameter of 20 mm. Subsequently, an ultrasound-guided tru-cut
biopsy of the left breast was performed for an accurate tissue diagnosis.
Results: The sample for tru-cut biopsy was processed. The histology
revealed only the mesenchymal component without the epithelial one.
The tumoral cells were atypical epithelioid cells with nuclear pleomor-
phism, mitotic activity-16 /10 HPF. The necrosis was present.
On immunohistochemistry the tumoral cells were positivity for vimentin,
CK 7,CD117, and focally positive for S100, E-cadherin, and were nega-
tive for p63, Cd34 and oestrogen.
After corelation between the immunoexpression, histological features and
imagistical features, our diagnosis was as follows, malignant mesenchy-
mal tumour compatible with malignant phyllode tumour. Malignant phyl-
lodes tumours can present dedifferentiations areas, which consists in
liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma, all these
entities should be consider for differential diagnosis of lesion.
Conclusion: The differential diagnosis of the phyllodes tumour involves
the assessment of the malignant mesenchymal component with or without
possible heterologous malignant elements; the evaluation of the epithelial
component with the characteristic aspect of slits with leaf-like projections
together with the appearance of the tumour demarcation. All of these
aspects can be evaluated simultaneous on the excision specimen for the
final diagnosis, tru-cut biopsy diagnosis should only be used in the first
stages of a diagnosis.

Corynebacterium caused cystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis
M. Leiner*, E. Tóth, N. Udvarhelyi
*National Institute of Oncology, Hungary
Background & objectives: Cystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis
with Corynebacterium affecting young women is a rare inflammatory
disease that can mimic malignancy. Between 2002 and 2020, a total of
141 cases were documented in the literature.
Methods: We report a case of a 44-year-old female patient suffering from
fever, chills, and palpable lesions in the left breast.
MR examination detected a pathological accumulation of contrast mate-
rial from mamilla to pectoralis. Morphologically inflammatory or malig-
nant process could not be differentiated.
The core biopsy sample was diagnosed as most probably cystic neutro-
philic granulomatous mastitis caused by Corynebacterium.
Results: In 2021 February, the external quadrant of the left breast was
excised. On HE stains perilobular mixed inflammatory infiltrate com-
posed of lymphocytes, neutrophils and scattered multinucleated giant
Virchows Arch
cells were seen. Round to oval cystic spaces rimmed by neutrophils and
nonnecrotizing granulomas were also present.
Conclusion: In summary, Corynebacterium caused cystic neutrophilic
granulomatous mastitis is an entity that is clinically difficult to distinguish
from breast carcinoma. On radiological examination, these lesions are
highly suspicious for malignancy. Only careful histological evaluation
can help in the correct diagnosis as Corynebacterium species are usually
small in quantity and organisms can be difficult to culture.

Miguel, V. Moreno Nieto
*Clinical Department Unit of Pathological Anatomy, OSI Araba, Araba
University Hospital; Bioaraba Health Research Institute, Vitoria-Gasteiz,
Alava, Spain
Background & objectives: Our patient, a 39-year-old woman was diag-
nosed and operated in 2016 of an infiltrating ductal carcinoma grade 3,
triple negative. The patient received chemotherapy and radiotherapy and
presented 5 years later a new mass at the same location.
Methods: Due to familial background, genetic analysis was undertaken,
with a positive result for BRCA2 mutation. A biopsy of the latter was
performed, showing sarcomatoid features. An ample immunohistochem-
istry battery was ordered to try to establish the correct diagnosis, and
ample excision was recommended for definitive diagnosis.
Results: The current neoplasm was composed by a mesenchymal prolifer-
ation with myxoid stroma, and pleomorphic cells exhibiting high nuclear/
cytoplasmic ratio, atypical mitosis and multinucleated bizarre nuclei. A
vascular proliferation composed of curvy thin-walled vessels was also pres-
ent. The malignant proliferation showed pectoral muscle and surrounding
adipose tissue infiltration. Immunohistochemically, high proliferation index
was observed with Ki67 antibody (80-90%), with focal p63 positivity. The
remaining markers, including keratins, were negative, hence discarding
metaplastic carcinoma as a diagnostic possibility. Differential diagnosis
was therefore established between pleomorphic sarcoma and high grade
myxofibrosarcoma, favouring the last one. Due to its complexity, the case
was consulted to a senior pathologist, who certified our diagnosis.
Conclusion: We present the case of a post-radiotherapy high grade
myxofibrosarcoma, in a patient with BRCA2 mutation. The presence of
myxoid component, thin-walled curvy vessels together with the atypical
pleomorphism and bizarre multinucleated nuclei with high number of
atypical mitosis, made the myxofibrosarcoma diagnosis clear.
According to our knowledge, myxofibrosarcoma has not been associated
previously with the use of radiotherapy. We hence present a case report
which shows that this tumour might also be associated with radiotherapy.

Tumour budding as a predictive factor of breast carcinoma
progression
M. Mnikhovich*, T. Bezuglova, A. Romanov, E. Rusina, T. Sotnikova,
D. Kushch, D. Pastukhova
*Research Institute of Human Morphology, Russia
Background & objectives: Tumour budding is one of the independent
prognostic factors of a tumour, first described in a colorectal cancer. it is
not used in clinical oncology as a prognostic factor due to the lack of a
standardized and easily reproducible assessment method.
Methods: The aim of study is to create a standardized method for
assessing tumour budding in relation to breast carcinoma. We used such
methods as IHC, light microscopy, analysis of scientific publications of
materials on the topic "Tumour budding".
Results: Tumour buds are single cells or clusters of 4 or less cells in an
invasive component of a carcinoma. The presence of the infiltrating
margin of the tumour (the zone of invasive growth) and pseudopodies
of tumour cells is noted.
Rare there is a weak or moderate lymphoid infiltration of the tumour.
Tumour budding is divided into peritumoral budding and intratumoral
budding. Both are morphological manifestations of the epithelial-
mesenchymal transition, as evidenced by the loss of adhesion of E-
cadherin molecules and the expression of markers of the activated Wnt-
signaling pathway, such as nuclear beta-catenin in tumour bud cells.
Conclusion: Tumour budding plays an important role in the prognosis of
breast carcinoma. The study of tumour budding as a factor contributes to
improving the management of patients with breast carcinoma.
It became possible to include this method in routine practice by the stan-
dardization of the method for assessing tumour budding. We have devel-
oped preliminary versions of recommendations for the evaluation of tu-
mour budding as a prognostic factor in the development of breast carci-
noma during routine histological examination of samples of the tumour.

Lymphoid cell microenvironment in the stroma of invasive breast
carcinoma of the non-specific type
M. Mnikhovich*, L. Erofeeva, T. Bezuglova
*Research Institute of Human Morphology, Russia
Background & objectives: Tumour infiltrating lymphocytes in breast
cancer (BC) is relevant issue in the context of new possibilities of
immunotherapy.
Objective of our study is to examine the structure of lymphoid cellular
formations in the breast in invasive non-specific cancer.
Methods: TIL were studied by morphometry on material from 18 patients
with invasive breast carcinoma luminal B type. Ki67 index was 40%
An IHC study was carried out with CD20, CD8, CD4, CD68, CD138, Ki-
67 markers. Morphometry was performed using ImageJ1.5. Statistical
data processing was performed using the nonparametric Mann –
Whitney test. TIL was evaluated in the tumour stromal component (in%).
Results: Tight cellular infiltrates surrounding the tumour cells in the form
of ridges were found directly in the stroma of the tumour. In interlobular
connective tissue the diffuse leukocyte infiltrates and lymphoid nodules
were detected. Lymphoid nodules contain more than 60% lymphocytes;
CD20+ and CD4+ cells dominate over CD8+ lymphocytes. Plasmocytes
and histiocytes also were detected here. Immunocompetent cells (small
lymphocytes and plasmocytes) and fibroblastic cells were detected in
diffuse intratumoral infiltrates in equal proportions. Among the lympho-
cytes, the predominant subpopulation here were CD8+ cells, CD20+ and
CD 4+ lymphocytes were represented in almost equal quantities. The
histiocytes content (CD68+) was reliably high in close proximity to tu-
mour cells.
Conclusion: The severity and subpopulation composition of lymphoid
tumour infiltration can be considered as a prognostic factor, but also can
be important for the selection of personalised treatment, including mod-
ern immunotherapeutic drugs.

A rare case of primary Hodgkin’s Lymphoma presenting in the
breast. Diagnostic challenges and catastrophic consequences from
literature
A. Mokhtari*, S. Bakhiet
*Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Primary Hodgkin’s lymphoma (PHL) of
breast is an exceedingly rare entity (0.04%-0.5% incidence) among pri-
mary breast lymphoma with around 24 cases reported in literature.
Histological diagnosis can prove challenging, owing to the morphologi-
cal features resembling those of an inflammatory pathology.[1]
Methods: A 75-year-old woman presented with several months of right
axillary swelling alongside a pre-existing breast lesion (U3) which had
Virchows Arch
been diagnosed as a reactive intramammary lymph node (B2). Ultrasound
showed that the breast lesion had increased in size and the axillary swell-
ing corresponded to abnormal-looking lymph nodes (U4). Core biopsies
revealed primary classic Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (CHL) of breast.
Results: Histological assessment of breast and axillary cores revealed
effaced lymph nodal architecture with a mixed inflammatory background
including scattered large atypical vacuolated cells abundant in clear cy-
toplasm with mononucleated and rare binucleated forms were seen.
Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed a CHL being positive to
CD15 and CD30 stains. Subsequent full-body imaging indicated the
breast as primary site and excluded extramammary dissemination. In
addition to the general B systems of lymphoma, the clinical presentation
is mostly insidious and may present as screen detected lesion or skin
changes. The morphological features may also mimic mastitis or inflam-
matory carcinoma [2][3]. Correctly identifying this lesion is imperative in
ensuring the patient undergoes appropriate treatment pathway.
Conclusion: PHL in breast is extremely rare and can easily be missed.
Radiology is less helpful as it may recognise the mammary lesion as
suspicious at most however histopathology is crucial to make such a
diagnosis. Careful consideration of a wide range of possibilities including
lymphoma is important to ensure a correct diagnosis. The literature high-
lights such a diagnostic difficulty as both FNA and biopsies may be
inconclusive. Indeed, inappropriate diagnosis could lead to unusual pre-
sentations, delayed or inappropriate treatment [1].

Background & objectives: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a
subset of breast cancer with a poor prognosis because of lack of targets for
hormonal therapy. Research has focused in recent years on discovering
biomarkers of TNBCs, which will aid in its management.
Methods: We analysed the expression of KI-67 Labelling Index (LI), a
nuclear protein that play diagnostic and prognostic roles in many cancers,
by immunohistochemistry, in TNBC cases from the King Khaled
University hospital. This expression was cross-checked against clinical-
pathological criteria of TNBC patients, and against Vimentin expression
in TNBC patients with significant KI-67 expression.
Results: KI-67 LI was significantly expressed in the majority of TNBC
cases. This expression was significantly correlated with lymph node me-
tastases, tumour invasion, high tumour nuclear grade, advanced stage and
failure to achieve complete remission. TNBCs’ KI-67 LI expression was
also correlated with Vimentin expression, the mesenchymal chief marker
of the EMT phenomenon.
Conclusion: Collectively, our study presents a strong argument for the
use of KI-67 LI as a biomarker of aggressive, metastatic TNBC disease
with poor outcome. This study, along with mounting evidence in the
scientific literature, presents a case for the use of this nuclear protein in
diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up of patients with this difficult
diagnosis.

F. Ramalhosa*, J. Gama, J. Madeira, M.J. Julião, V. Almeida, C. Faria,
M. Meruje, M.J. Martins
*Pathology Department, Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Centro
Hospitalar e Universitário Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Primary angiosarcoma of the breast is an
extremely rare tumour (0.04% of all malignant breast tumours) and one
of the most aggressive type. Its diagnosis is challenging since has a var-
iable and non-specific clinical and radiological presentation.
Methods: We herein report the case of a 54-year-old Caucasian woman
presented at the emergency department of our Centro Hospitalar e
Universitário de Coimbra with a lump in the left breast, which over the
last 6 months had become bigger and itchy. Positron emission
tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging confirmed a
space-occupying lesion with high metabolic activity in the left breast.
Results: The tumour histology, in the initial core needle biopsy, showed
papillary formations and vascular structures lined by atypical cells with a
hyperchromatic nucleus and eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumour cells
expressed CD34, CD31, ERG and Fli-1 but were negative for cytokeratin.
The angiosarcoma grade I was made.
Conclusion: The patient was treated with neoadjuvant systemic chemo-
therapy based on doxorubicin and carboxamide. After treatment comple-
tion, the patient underwent radical mastectomy. Pathologic complete re-
sponse in the breast and axillary lymph nodes was achieved. The patient
has no evidence of disease recurrence.

Prognostic value of elastic fibres in breast invasive ductal carcinoma
microenvironment after chemotherapy
S. Rjabceva*, I. Siamionik, M. Derevyanko
*Institute of Physiology of NAS of Belarus, Belarus
Background & objectives: The tumour microenvironment substantially
influences cancer pathogenesis and progression. A prognostic role of
stromal elastic fibres remains unclear. The aim of study is to estimate
the prognostic value of stromal elastic fibres in breast invasive ductal
carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Methods: The residual tumours after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy
from 31 patients were resected. A breast invasive ductal carcinoma of no
special type (not otherwise specified") was diagnosed. Histochemical stud-
ies for Russell-Movat pentachrome stain was done. A deposition of elastic
fibre (EF) around vessels in tumour microenvironment was evaluated as a
weak (a weak EF network) and severe (massive EF conglomerates).
Results: Patients who had a weak EF deposition (3/9.7%) or did not have
thickened elastic fibres (14/45.2%) around vessels in microenvironment
of residual tumour was included in the first group (n=17). Women who
had a severe EF deposition (14/45.2%) around vessels in microenviron-
ment of residual tumour was included in the second group (n=14). The
average follow-up time after operation was 44.6±5.2 months (from 3 to
80 month). A 3 (2.5%) patients from the first group and 7 (50%) from the
second group had tumour recurrent. The average time of disease-free
survival was 58.15±5.0 months for the first group and 37.46±8.0 months
– for the second group (р=0,0137).
Conclusion: This study showed that the change in the thickness of an
elastic fibres around vessels in residual tumour microenvironment of
breast invasive ductal carcinoma is related to disease-free survival time.
A severe deposition of elastic fibre around vessels in tumour microenvi-
ronment after neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be used as an additional
predictor of tumour behaviour.

Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the breast – a very rare case
G. Stanc*, E. Souka, N. Novkovic, G. Galanopoulos, P. Manikis, H.J.
Trihia, C. Valavanis
*Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Mucinous cystadenocarcinomas (MCA) of
the breast are very rare tumours.
Methods: An 86-year-old woman with a history of papillary breast car-
cinoma of the left breast (T4bN0, 4 years ago), presented to our hospital
with two palpable masses at the left breast. A resection of two lesions
measuring 8cm and 1,4cm was performed. The first was well
circumscribed, partial cystic and partial solid, with mucus content.
Virchows Arch
Results: The microscopic examination of the largest lesion revealed a
high grade cystic invasive carcinoma, with papillary projections, lined
by tall columnar cells with stratification and abundant intracytoplasmic
mucin. Necrosis was present. The immunochemistry revealed CK7 (+),
mammoglobin (+), CK20 (-), CDX2 (-), WT-1 (-) CA-125 (+) with apical
stain, ER (-), PgR (-), Her-2 (CISH) (+). The smaller lesion was a high
grade papillary invasive carcinoma with a high nuclear grade in situ
carcinoma component and displayed cribriform/ papillary architectural
pattern. The immunochemistry showed ER (+), PgR (+), Her-2 (-).
Conclusion: The MCA has distinct clinical behaviour with a favourable
prognosis which is unrelated to the tumour size, metastasis to the lymph
nodes or molecular subtype. Differential diagnosis includes metastasis
from an ovarian cystadenocarcinoma or pancreatic carcinoma and is
based on the immunophenotype.

Giant phyllodes tumours of the breast: are they always malignant?
A. Syrnioti*, N. Mantha, S. Netta, E. Galidis, D. Paramythiotis, A.
Karakatsanis, T. Koletsa
*Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Aristotle University of
Thessaloniki, Greece
Background & objectives: Phyllodes Tumours (PTs) account for 0.3–
1% of all primary breast neoplasms and are classified into benign, bor-
derline, and malignant. PTs larger than 10 cm in size are considered giant
and are most commonly malignant in nature.
Methods: Here we describe two cases of giant PTs, the first in a 38-year-
old female who presented with a 22 cm lump in the right breast, and the
second in a 55-year-old female with a 45 cm, fast-growing, ulcerated
mass in the left breast. Both patients underwent radical mastectomy and
axillary lymphadenectomy.
Results: In both cases, histopathologic features of PTs were observed. In
the first case, the stroma was moderately cellular with mild-moderate
atypia, low mitotic activity (<5/10HPFs), and absence of stromal over-
growth, pointing to a diagnosis of borderline PT. The patient remains free
of disease for 2 years in follow-up. In the second case, stromal cellularity
ranged from moderate to focally increased with marked nuclear pleomor-
phism and cellular atypia, high mitotic activity (>13/10HPFs), areas of
stromal overgrowth, and foci with heterologous chondrosarcomatous dif-
ferentiation. The diagnosis of malignant PT was established, after which
radiation therapy was initiated. One year and four months later, the patient
presented with widespread metastatic disease.
Conclusion: Giant PTs represent an uncommon entity. Clinical suspicion
should be high in patients with a rapidly enlarging breast mass. The
majority of the cases are malignant with a high probability of metastatic
disease, whereas giant borderline PTs are exceptional. Although FNA
and core biopsy are helpful, definitive diagnosis is established after com-
plete surgical excision and detailed histopathologic examination. The
establishment of specific therapeutic guidelines is required to ensure the
appropriate management of this type of tumours.

Triple negative breast carcinomas: correlation between TILS and
classic prognostic factors
S. Teoran*, R. Carp, A. Slovac, C. Huiet, S. Taban, A. Dema
*Department of Pathology, Emergency Clinical County Hospital “Pius
Brinzeu” Timisoara, Romania
Background & objectives: Triple negative (TN) BC, represents 15–20%
of BCs and it usually is an aggressive tumour. Tumour infiltrating lym-
phocytes (TILs) seems to have an important prognostic significance in
TNBC. This study aims to evaluate TILS as a prognostic marker in TNBC.
Methods: We selected from the Pathology Department of SCJUPBT da-
tabase TNBC cases corresponding to the following inclusion criteria: his-
topathological evaluation in our department, ER/PR/HER2-; exclusion
criteria: core-needle biopsy specimens. Stromal TILS were digitally eval-
uated on a single H&E scanned slide; TILs were analysed in correlation
with other clinico-pathological parameters: age, tumour size, lymph node
involvement, histologic subtype, lymphovascular and perineural invasion.
Results: We identified 24 patients that meet the inclusion criteria, aged
29-84 years (mean age – 63 years). The TILS percentage, evaluated
according to the International TILs working group guidelines, varied
from 0% to 70% (average - 21%), with higher percentages in women
< 65 years. Out of 24 cases, 19 were NST carcinomas, and 5 cases
metaplastic carcinomas; 22 carcinomas were GIII and only 2 GII. A high
TILs score has been identified in all 3 carcinomas with medullary differ-
entiation. Low TILs scores have been associated with higher tumour
stages, lymph node metastases, perineural invasion and lymphovascular
invasion.
Conclusion: Our results suggest a correlation between the presence of
TILs and a potentially better outcome of patients with TNBC after che-
motherapy or biological therapy. The pathologist must be familiar with
TILs and the quantification method from the perspective of introducing
this parameter in the pathological report of TNBC.

Metastatic papillary serous carcinoma should be considered in cases
of high-grade encapsulated papillary carcinoma of the breast. An
extremely rare case and a possible pitfall
H.J. Trihia*, N. Charalampakis, L. Karelis, P. Lampropoulos, I. Provatas
*'Metaxas' Memorial Cancer Hospital, Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: Encapsulated papillary carcinoma (EPC) of
the breast has a favourable prognosis. High-grade EPCs, triple-negative
or HER-2-positive, are managed as invasive carcinomas. Breast metasta-
sis from serous carcinoma represents a late-stage event. The distinction
between the two could be very challenging.
Methods: A 68-year-old woman underwent a total left mastectomy and
sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). A specimen with the indication of
‘tumour of the left breast’ was received in our Pathology Department. A
peripheral nodular mass of 3cm was found.
Results: Microscopically, the appearances were of large intracystic pap-
illary stalks, with high nuclear grade, surrounded by collagenous tissue.
The diagnosis was of infiltrated encapsulated papillary carcinoma, ER+.
One year later, the woman was diagnosed with a cervical mass, possible
pathologic lymph node, which on FNB was consistent with metastatic
serous papillary carcinoma. According to clinical history, the patient was
diagnosed elsewhere with high-grade serous papillary carcinoma of the
peritoneum, four years earlier. Immunohistochemical stains were similar
in both specimens, ER+, WT1-, PAX8+, p53+ (wild type) and high Ki-67
(80%). GATA-3 was weakly, scarcely expressed. The findings were con-
sistent with metastatic SPC in the breast, mimicking primary carcinoma
of the EPC type.
Conclusion: Pathology of breast metastases and differentiation from pri-
mary breast cancers is based on a combination of morphological and IHC
features. In our case, the lack of clinical history, the type of surgical
approach (mastectomy and SLNB), the solitary lesion, the EPC pattern
of growth and the diffuse ER+ staining, were more in favour of primary
breast lesion. Different morphologic features of metastatic PSC have been
described. EPC growth pattern should be considered among them.

Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the breast. Presentation of
an exceedingly rare case
H.J. Trihia*, D. Kouzos, P. Lampropoulos, L. Karelis, N. Charalampakis,
I. Provatas
*'Metaxas' Memorial Cancer Hospital, Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: Sarcomas are exceptionally rare primary
breast tumours, arising within breast parenchyma, the skin and
Virchows Arch
subcutaneous tissue overlying the breast. Undifferentiated pleomorphic
sarcoma (UPS) of the breast is a high grade malignant soft tissue neo-
plasm with no specific line of differentiation.
Methods: A 62-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital due to a
palpable lump of the right breast of approximately 4cm in mammography
and bloody discharge from the nipple. A partial mastectomy and sentinel
lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was originally performed, complemented by
total mastectomy, due to originally infiltrated breast margins.
Results: Breast parenchyma was occupied by a circumscribed solid, white-
grey tumour with friable haemorrhagic necrotic area. Microscopically, the
tumour consisted of myxofibrosarcomatous areas alternating with areas of
pleomorphic giant cell type with brisk mitotic activity and areas of necrosis.
There was a nodular pattern of growth and a continuous histological spec-
trum from hypocellular, myxoid and spindle cell areas to highly pleomor-
phic with bizarre giant cells and high mitotic activity. There was positive
immunohistochemical staining expression in VIM, Kp1 (CD68) and
CD10. The diagnosis of UPS of the breast was made. The patient
underwent chemotherapy and is scheduled to begin adjuvant radiotherapy.
Ten months after diagnosis the patient is free of disease.
Conclusion: UPS occurs as a primary lesion in breast parenchyma, with
the prerequisite of location within breast parenchyma and without chest
wall involvement. Extensive tumour sampling, attention to morphologic
detail and the use of appropriate immunohistochemical markers lead to
the correct diagnosis. Surgical resection with a negative margin is the
standard treatment. SLNB is not warranted. Adjuvant radiation is utilized
in large tumours or following incomplete surgical resections. Adjuvant
chemotherapy may be used in patients with large, unresectable or meta-
static tumours.

A rare entity, Invasive Lobular Carcinoma, Apocrine subtype with
aberrant E-cadherin pattern – a case report
L. Ursache*, G. Grigore, A. Ene
*Emergency University Hospital, Bucharest, Department of Pathology,
Romania
Background&objectives: Invasive lobularcarcinoma accountsfor 5-15%
ofallbreastcancers,whichhasaclassictype(55%)anddifferentarchitectural
and cytological variants. One rare cytologic variant is apocrine or
histiocytoid, which represents about 3% of all invasive lobular carcinomas.
Methods: A 62-year-old female depicts on self-palpation a nodule in the
upper-outer quadrant. The ultrasound and mammography examination
confirms a breast lesion, with a BI-RADS score of 5, highly suggestive
of malignancy. Intraoperative examination revealed a white, firm nodule
of 18/15 mm, with features of invasive carcinoma. Further breast excision
and microscopic examination were performed.
Results: Microscopic evaluation illustrates a malignant tumour prolifer-
ation formed by large cells, with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, with
vesicular nuclei and multiple eosinophilic nucleoli. The pattern of distri-
bution is targetoid, around ducts, with single-cell file infiltration.
Immunohistochemically, the tumour revealed an aberrant membranous
E-cadherin pattern, with faint or granular positivity and focal cytoplasmic
positivity. Oestrogen and progesterone markers were negative. Her2
showed a weak/moderate positivity, with an equivocal 2+ score.
Androgen receptor had nuclear positivity in about 99% of tumour cells
and GCDFP-15 was positive just focally. There was a proliferation index
of 5-7% with Ki-67. All these features were consistent with a diagnosis
of Invasive Lobular Carcinoma, Apocrine subtype, moderately
differentiated.
Conclusion: This particular case highlights the importance of immu-
nohistochemical examination, especially in distinctive invasive breast
carcinomas, with rare features. Invasive lobular carcinoma, the apo-
crine subtype is a rare entity and one has to make a differential diag-
nosis with other entities with apocrine differentiation, in terms of the
tendency to recur and metastasize.

A case report of a breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell
lymphoma
E. Vouza*, M. Arnaouti, G. Papachristopoulou, N.N. Sotiriadou, N.
Arnogiannaki
*Anticancer Athens Hospital, Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: To report a case of a Breast Implant-
Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), an entity that
has been recognizes in the 2017 on revision of the WHO Classification of
the Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues.
Methods: A 48-year-old woman 2 year after the 2nd silicone breast
implant placement, complained for pain and swelling in the right breast.
She went for clinical, MRI and ultrasonography examination which they
revealed a peri implant fluid collection and rupture of right implant. The
patient underwent surgery and both implants were removed and fibrous
capsules sent to pathological department for examination.
Results: The microscopic of right capsulectomy specimens showed mild
degree diffuse chronic inflammation, but a more careful examination
revealed also large pleomorphic cells at the surface of capsule in a fibri-
nous material. These cells had anaplastic nuclei, abundant pale cytoplasm
and prominent nucleoli. The nuclei were eccentric with horseshoe mor-
phology. Mitotic figures were recognized. There were some areas that
tumour cells infiltrated into the capsule. The immunohistochemical anal-
ysis gave negative results for AE1/AE3, CD20, CD43 and positive reac-
tion for EMA, CD30, CD45 and CD3 (focal). The tumour cells were
ALK negative.
Based on morphological and immunohistochemical evaluation the diag-
nosis of the Breast Implant- Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
was made.
Conclusion: BI-ALCL is a newly, very rare described entity which is
usually developing 10 to 13 years after placement of the breast implant.
The neoplasm has common morphological and immunophenotypical fea-
tures with systemic ALK negative ALCL. The mean age of patients is 50
years. The treatment of choice is implant removing and capsulectomy.
The outcome of the most patients is excellent.
The differential diagnosis of BIA-AL from chronic inflammation associ-
ated with breast implantation it may be a challenge.

Agreement between core biopsy and surgical specimen, regarding
breast cancer histological degree; a Brazilian study
R. Justi Nogueira, T. Müller Silvério Alves, D.J. Camilo Junior, M.
Jefferson Quirino Louzada, J.C. Xavier*
*Unisalesiano, Brazil
Background & objectives: Scarff-Bloom-Richardson classification
modified by Ellis and Elston (SBR) is a well-known scale used world-
wide to classify breast carcinomas. The aim of this study was to compare
the agreement between histological graduation obtained through the core
biopsy (CB) and surgical specimens.
Methods: A retrospective observational study performed in a tertiary
service in the Brazilian countryside. The comparative histological gradu-
ation was based on the three morphological characteristics from SBR.
The Kappa index was the coefficient of agreement used to verify the
possible correlation. The rates of overestimation and underestimation
were also assessed.
Results: One hundred fifty-seven patients had their medical records
reviewed. Sixty-one years old was the mean age. The mean number
of fragments obtained by CB was 3.8. The tumour’s size ranged from
0.5 cm to 8.5 cm. In TNM staging 38% of patients were pT1c and
34% were pT2. There were not lymph node metastasis in 59% of
them. The agreement between CB and surgical specimens was
78.98% (n=124). CB underestimation index was 19.75% (n=31)
and overestimation 1.27% (n=2). There was no difference between
Virchows Arch
both groups of cases (with agreement and without agreement between
CB and surgical specimen) in relation to tumour size, patients’ age,
number and length of biopsy fragments.
Conclusion: CB when compared to the excision specimens predicts mod-
erate agreement when analysing by Kappa index. In the studied popula-
tion tumour size, patients’ age, number and length of CB fragments did
not influence the rate of agreement between CB and surgical specimen.

Matas, M.d.M. del Barrio-Molina
*Department of Pathology, Mateu Orfila Hospital, IB-Salut, Maó
(Menorca), Spain
Background & objectives: Solitary fibrous tumour (SFT) is a spindle-
cell fibroblastic neoplasm that usually occurs in the pleura, but it can
appear virtually anywhere. SFT is very uncommon in the breast, with
around 15 cases reported in the literature (13 women, 2 men).
Methods: A 78-year-old-man, with familial history of breast cancer, and
evidence of gynecomastia. A mammogram and ultrasound were per-
formed showing a solid nodule of 10 mm, hypoechoic, defined margins,
smooth edges, slightly lobulated, BIRADS-3. Ultrasound-guided core-
needle biopsy was performed, the diagnosis of a mesenchymal spindle
cell tumour, consistent with SFT/Miofibroblastoma, was suggested. The
patient underwent to surgical excision of the nodule.
Results: The surgical specimen revealed a well circumscribed mass of
1x0.9 cm, whitish and firm-gelatinous consistency. Histologically
showed a neoplasm mesenquimal expansive, unencapsulated,
multilobular growth, made up of bundles of bland-looking ovoid to short
spindle cells, within an oedematous and myxoid stroma, with perivascular
reinforcement. Nuclear pleomorphism, necrosis, mitosis and
haemorrhages were absent. Immunohistochemically, was positive for
oestrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and androgen (AR) receptors; patchy
staining with Vimentin, CD34, Actin, Caldesmon, CD10, BCL-2, and
strong and diffuse nuclear immunoreactivity (>90%) with STAT6; nega-
tive for CKAE1/AE3, EMA, Desmin, S-100, SOX10, HMB45 and
MIFT. The diagnosis of SFT was rendered. Clinically there is no evidence
of local recurrence after a 1-year-follow-up period.
Conclusion: SFT of the breast is a rare neoplasm included in “the benign-
spindle-cell-tumours” which representing less than 1% of all mammary
tumours. Although SFT is suspected on characteristic morphologic fea-
tures, immunohistochemistry revealing reactivity for CD34, BCL2 and
STAT6, is crucial in the differential diagnosis of potential benign and
malignant mimics. Regarding ER, only two studies have addressed this
issue, in one they were positive, in the other negative. More studies are
needed to clarify it.

IgG4-related sclerosing mastitis with metachronous invasive lobular
breast carcinoma
S. Yonat İşgüder*, G. Esendağlı, B. Ögüt, E. Acar
*Department of Pathology of Gazi University Medical School, Turkey
Background & objectives: IgG4-related disease (IgG-RD) is a
fibroinflammatory disease that can involve various organs. IgG-RD is a
systemic disease characterized by specific histopathological findings of
an intense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, storiform fibrosis, and oblitera-
tive phlebitis in the presence of predominant IgG4-positive plasma cells.
Methods: Our case is a 72-year-old woman with rheumatoid complaints.
Eight years ago, she underwent left radical mastectomy because of breast
cancer which pathologic diagnosis was reported as invasive lobular car-
cinoma. She is being followed in the rheumatology department with skin
lesions.
Results: One year ago, a distorted area was detected in her right breast
and a lumpectomy was performed with preliminary diagnoses as breast
cancer and tuberculosis. Histopathological examination showed lobular
intraepithelial neoplasia areas within sclerotic stroma with dense ducto-
centric lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, in routine haematoxylin-eosin
stain. This inflammation pattern raised the suspicion of a sclerosing mas-
titis which might be related to IgG4. On immunohistochemical assess-
ment, most of the plasma cells were stained for IgG4 (cut-off value as 50
plasma cells per HPF), without any monoclonality with kappa and lamb-
da. Recently, during clinical follow-up, a rectal adenocarcinoma was
detected and segmental colon resection was performed.
Conclusion: The IgG4-RD with lobular intraepithelial neoplasia and with
metachronous invasive lobular breast carcinoma has not been reported
until today and the probable relationship between the two entities has not
yet been discussed. This is a unique case with benign immune-based breast
disease with lobular neoplasia, invasive breast cancer history and recently
developed rectal cancer. So, it is found to be important to be shared.

Primary undifferentiated pleomorphic cardiac sarcoma – a case
report
C. Albuquerque*, J. Filipe, R. Cabrera, S. Ramos
*Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Ocidental, Portugal
Background & objectives: About 25% of primary cardiac tumours are
malignant, and of those 75% are sarcomas. Primary cardiac sarcomas are
rare but often fatal. These tumours are generally incidental findings, as
they are usually asymptomatic until locally advanced.
Methods: A 49-year-old female, with known history of atrial fibrillation,
was found to have a left atrial mass during a routine CT-scan.
Cardiac MR revealed a mass within the posterior and superior wall of the
left atrium, suspicious for malignancy, measuring 32 mm. Due to the
extent of invasion into the pulmonary vein, the mass was incompletely
resected.
Results: Grossly, the tumour was a 50 mm, infiltrative, fibrous mass,
with no necrosis or myxoid change. Histologically, a pleomorphic sarco-
ma with epithelioid features and collagenous stroma was observed.
Mitotic activity was conspicuous and atypical mitoses were present.
MDM2 and vimentin positivity was seen by immunohistochemistry and
the proliferative index (Ki-67) was approximately 40%. No amplification
of MDM2 gene was identified by FISH analysis. A diagnosis of primary
undifferentiated pleomorphic cardiac sarcoma was rendered. The patient
is alive 4 months after surgery, undergoing adjuvant radio and
chemotherapy.
Conclusion: Cardiac sarcomas are a rare subset of soft tissue sarcomas
with aggressive, highly invasive behaviour and a poor prognosis, with
median survival of less than 1 year. As in this case, clear surgical margins
are often difficult to obtain and tumours can easily recur. MDM2 positiv-
ity by immunohistochemistry may not indicate MDM2 gene amplifica-
tion, as this case showed. Surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy
with or without radiation, is the standard care.

*Pathology Department - Sahloul University Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Hibernoma is a tumour that develops out of
remnants of foetal brown fat tissue, occurring in subcutaneous soft tissue
Virchows Arch
of thigh, upper neck and trunk. Its localization to cardiac cavities is ex-
tremely uncommon. Its occurrence in newborns is more uncommon.
Methods: A 2-day-old new-born was extracted in emergency after dis-
covery on echography of a 38*29 mm polylobed tumour of the right
atrium and ventricle compressing left ventricle. The new-born underwent
heart surgery.
Results: Multiple fragments measuring 4 to 18 mm were received. On
microscopy, it is formed out by lobules of multivacuolated adipocytic
cells, mature adipocytic cells and fat brown cells. These cells are distrib-
uted in variable proportions. Tumour cells displayed CD34 immunostain-
ing. No PS100, MDM2 and CD68 expression was identified.
Histopathology report confirmed the diagnosis of benign cardiac
hibernoma.
Conclusion: Hibernoma is a rare and benign tumour accounting for
about 1% of all adipocytic tumours. It occurs frequently in adults
with a mean age of 38 years old. Its localization to cardiac cavities
is extremely uncommon. It is a painless slow-growing mass. Due to
its rare localization in cardiac cavities, immunochemistry is needed to
eliminate other more frequent and aggressive tumours. Treatment
consists on surgical removal.

S. Elaouni*, S. Jebli, S. Sassi, Z. Bernoussi, F. Zouidia, K. Znati
*Ibn Sina University Hospital, Pathology, Rabat, Morocco
Background & objectives: the smooth muscle tumours of the heart are
extremely rare. this is only the fifth reported case of benign metastasizing
leiomyoma to the heart with histological proof and the first case of cardiac
metastasis without associated pulmonary metastasis localization.
Methods: A 56-year-old woman presented with dyspnoea and shortness
of breath. On imaging, she was found to have a right atrial mass initially
thought to be a thrombus, Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
showed a monolobed, pedunculated, mobile, well-circumscribed mass
attached to the intra-atrial septum. The resected tumour was sent to us
for histological confirmation.
Results: The 8 cm x 5 cm x 3 cm resected cardiac tumour was solid, grey-
white, and homogeneous fasciculate with no haemorrhage or necrosis.
Microscopically, the tumour was composed of bundles of bland spindle
cells no nuclear atypia or necrosis, and only rare mitoses (less than 1/10
high-power fields).
Immunohistochemically, the spindle tumour cells expressed hcaldesmon
and desmin and were negative for S100 protein. MIB-1 immunohistochem-
ical staining showed low proliferative activity, with less than 1% MIB-1-
positive cells. The tumour cells were strongly positive for oestrogen recep-
tors (ER) and for progesterone receptors (PR), supportive of uterine origin.
Conclusion: It illustrates that benign metastasizing leiomyoma should be
included in the differential diagnosis of cardiac tumours in patients with a
history of surgery uterine leiomyoma perfectly benign,

Oncocardiopathology and endomyocardial biopsy
R. Henriques De Gouveia*, M.J. Andrade, S. Ramos
*INMLCF & FMUC & CHLO, Portugal
Background & objectives: Cardiac tumours are rare entities. Most are
benign and, if malignant, the majority is metastatic. Heart involvement
topology and characteristics are diverse, and its investigation may be
assisted by Endomyocardial Biopsy. The authors present such a case.
Methods: A 78-year-old male was submitted to endomyocardial biopsy,
at a Reference Centre, due to an infiltrative myocardial disorder, without
familial or personal known nosologic antecedents. Clinico-imagiological
workflow did not find other pathological involvement. Eight
endomyocardial fragments, measuring 1-2 mm, were procured and sent
to Anatomo-Pathological evaluation.
Results: Microscopic examination revealed a diffuse infiltration by atyp-
ical lymphoid cells, whose immunohistochemical phenotyping showed
marked positivity for pan-B lymphocyte marker CD20; leading to the
diagnosis of cardiac involvement by lympho-hematopoietic neoplasia,
with features of Diffuse Large B Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (primi-
tive versus metastatic). Additional cardio and haematological investiga-
tion, as well as clinical follow-up excluded other tumoral sites, favouring
the diagnosis of primitive cardiac lymphoma.
Conclusion: 'Primary Cardiac Lymphoma' (restricted to heart and/or
pericardium, by definition) is reported to account for 1-2% in surgical
heart specimens and for 0.15-1% autopsy studies, while metastatic in-
volvement ranges 20%. It is responsible for 0.5% of extra-nodal lympho-
mas. It is prone to affect immunocompromised persons, namely heart
transplanted individuals. The clinical behaviour is aggressive, including
cardiac failure, arrhythmias, pericardial effusion, sudden death.
'Percutaneous Endomyocardial Biopsy' is an important tool in the diag-
nosis and follow-up survey of cardiac oncologic settings.

*University Hospital of Sahloul, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Primary cardiac lymphoma (PCL) is a rare
type of non Hodgkin’s lymphoma. It accounts for less than 0.01% of all
cardiac tumours. We report a case of PCL and define its clinical and
pathological features.
Methods: We presented a 62-year-old female patient with clinical signs
of cardiac right insufficiency which progressing for 2 months. The patient
underwent a cardiac ultrasound in which a tumour of the right atrium was
found. Further cardiac MRI confirmed the presence of this tumour. An
ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed.
Results: Microscopically, the sample corresponded to a proliferation
made up of sheets of large rounded cells. Some tumour cells had a finely
pitted or clumped chromatin nucleus and often a single large, centric
nucleolus. Other tumour cells had a marginal nucleus, pressed against
the nuclear membrane. An immunochemical study was then carried out,
showing diffuse and intense labelling of tumour cells by CD45 and
CD20. Immunostaining for CK 7, CD34, desmin, myogenin,
synaptophysin and chromogranin was negative. The diagnosis of diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma was made. As staging revealed no evidence of
disseminated disease or bone marrow involvement, this was considered to
be primary cardiac diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Conclusion: Primary cardiac lymphoma is a rare localization of extra-
lymph nodes non-Hodgkin lymphomas. It more frequently affects immu-
nodeficient patients with an affinity for the right heart. It is diagnosed at
an advanced stage when they involve either the myocardium or the peri-
cardium. Morphologically, PCL can pose diagnostic problems with any
round cell tumour, hence the importance of immunochemical analysis
which remains a gold standard to determine the nature of the tumour.

*Sechenov University, Russia
Background & objectives: Anatomic pathology of post-COVID-19 syn-
drome is discussed in the literature. We describe the autopsy case of a 46-
year-old female patient who had undergone COVID-19 (pneumonia -
CT2) six months before her death.
Methods: We present the data of morphological study of autopsy case
including histological, immunohistochemical study of virus proteins (nu-
cleocapsid protein and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2) and determination
Virchows Arch
of the characteristics of the cellular infiltrate in the heart (CD3, CD20,
CD45, CD68, TLR4, TLR9, perforine). Detection of coronavirus RNA in
myocardium was performed by PCR.
Results: Within 6 months after COVID-19, clinically, the patient had
significant signs of chronic myocarditis (decompensation of heart failure,
arrhythmia, increase in anti-cardiac antibody titre). She died of chronic
cardiovascular failure. The virus RNA was detected in myocardial tissue,
kidney, intestine, liver, brain and ovary, but not in lung tissue. Histology
revealed in the heart chronic lymphocytic myocarditis with giant multi-
nucleated cells, collaptoid glomerulopathy and necronephrosis,
steatohepatitis, oedema and vascular stasis in the brain. Virus proteins
were identified in macrophages of the inflammatory infiltrate,
cardiomyocytes, neurons of the brain, epithelium of the proximal convo-
luted tubules of the kidney, which suggests virus persistence in the body.
Conclusion: Post-COVID-19 syndrome may be the result of a chronic
COVID-19 infection.

rotid gland
K. Angeliki*, K. Kekempanou, Z. Stamou, P. Peristeropoulou, V.
Mamali
*Cytology Department, General Hospital of Patras, Greece
Background & objectives: Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the
Parotid gland is a rare aggressive malignancy (<1% of all salivary gland
tumours). A case of primary parotid gland squamous cell carcinoma by
fine needle aspiration (FNA) is presented.
Methods: A 82-year-old man, non-smoker presented with a progressively
increasing painless mass in parotid region of 3 months duration. There was no
history of prior mass in same region or in the neck. Tumour measuring
4x3 cm in the right parotid, non-tender, fixed to skin. An FNA was performed
and conventional smears, were stained with Papanicolaou and Giemsa stains.
Results: (FNAC) from the lesion was composed mainly of individual or
small clusters cells with large polymorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei.
Cellular overlapping and moderate disturbance nuclear cytoplasmic
(N/C) ratio were observed. Immunocytochemistry showed reactivity to
p63. Based on the above findings, the cytological diagnosis was consis-
tent with a primary parotid gland squamous cell carcinoma. The followed
histopathological diagnosis confirmed it.
Conclusion: The cytological diagnosis of primary parotid gland tumour is
effective, when the morphological, as well as the immunostaining results
are taken into account and may contribute to the patient’s clinical treatment.

Fine Needle Aspiration of breast cancer in a male patient with mul-
tiple symmetrical lipomatosis
K. Angeliki*, T. Zerbionis, K. Kekempanou, C. Letsas, V. Mamali
*Cytology Department, General Hospital of Patras, Greece
Background & objectives: Benign symmetrical lipomatosis is charac-
terized by multiple lipomatous nodules in the trunk or limbs that coexist
with increased alcohol consumption. The nodules have extremely benign
behaviour and a family predisposition.
Methods: 82 years old male with multiple nodules in the chest and
abdomen, compatible with the diagnosis of multiple symmetrical
lipomatosis. During physical examination a nodule with different charac-
teristics was revealed near to the left breast nipple that was immobile and
fixed to the surrounding skin. He has a history of heart failure and alco-
holism. FNA conventional method using Papanikolaou stain.
Results: Microscopy examination revealed a lot of epithelial type
neoplasmatic cells. These cells appeared single or in monolayer and pap-
illary form clusters. The clusters appeared disorder of cell orientation, loss
of cellular cohesion and loss of myoepithelial cells. Neoplasmatic cells
have enlarged, variably hyperchromatic and usually eccentric nuclei that
can vary considerably in size and shape, with coarse granular chromatin
pattern and small or prominent nucleoli. All of the cells are in a bloody
background. The immunocytochemistry revealed intense positive nuclear
stain for ER and PR in many neoplasmatic cells.
Conclusion: The cooperation between the laboratory and clinical depart-
ment is a prerequisite for the correct diagnosis in the setting of coexis-
tence of multiple nodular lesions.

Atrophic cervico-vaginal smears in young women: challenges and
pitfalls
R.A. Balan*, L. Lozneanu, R. Avadanei, T.A. Balan, C. Amalinei
*"Grigore T. Popa" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Iasi, Romania
Background & objectives: Intrinsic or extrinsic oestrogen produces mat-
uration of cervical and vaginal squamous epithelium, while complete
absence of oestrogen activity causes the atrophy of the squamous epithe-
lium. Our study aims to assess various cytomorphological profiles of
atrophic cervico-vaginal smears in young women.
Methods: A total of 19 conventional cervico-vaginal smears were
reviewed, of women between 22-42 years old, routinely stained by the
Papanicolaou method, evaluated and classified according to the Bethesda
system, and interpreted as atrophic. The assessment considered the patient
clinical data such as site of material collection, age, menstrual history,
hormone therapy, surgery procedures, history of lesions and malignan-
cies, radiotherapy.
Results: 7 out of 19 cases (36.84%) were between 22-30 years old, and
12 patients (63.16%) were between 31-42 years old. All of the cervical
smears (100%) were cytological diagnosed as atrophic. 12 cases
(63.15%) presented an inflammatory background. No smear had
intraepithelial squamous or glandular associated lesions. The smears pre-
sented incomplete maturation or complete atrophy, due to low supply of
oestrogen. 6 patients (31.57%) were previously diagnosed with infertility.
4 cases (21.05%) presented an associated polycystic ovarian syndrome.
All cervico-vaginal smears showed small parabasal type cells, with less
intermediate or mature cells. When a certain degree of nuclear irregularity
was present, it raised the problem of an existing dysplastic lesion.
Conclusion: The assessment of the endocrine status of a reproductive age
woman represents one of the most difficult tasks for cytological diagno-
sis. The interpretation of morphology and patterns of squamous cells
should be cautiously made regarding endocrine status and therapeutic
strategy. Endocrine cytology is a useful tool for diagnosis and treatment
in particular clinical contexts.

Background & objectives: Aneuploidy is a defining feature of malig-
nancies. We isolated circulating tumour-associated rare cells from the
blood of cancer patients on standard laboratory slides, quantified their
ploidy status and correlated it with immunocytomorphology on the
single-cell level.
Methods: Whole blood was processed by hMX high-gradient magnetic
cell separation to remove red and white blood cells. Remaining atypical
Virchows Arch
cells were characterised by Cryoimmunostaining, using antibodies direct-
ed against leukocyte (CD45), epithelial (cytokeratin, EpCAM), mesen-
chymal (vimentin) and proliferation antigens (H3Ser10). Aneuploidy was
computed by determining integrated nuclear fluorescence intensity
(DRAQ5), modifying the flow-cytometric method previously described
by Darzynkiewicz.
Results: When normalising DNA content of white blood cells to 1.0
(euploidy), tumour-associated circulating cells showed hypoploidy as
low as 0.3 and hyperploidy as high as 3.5 (CD45-negative cells with
single nuclei) in the blood of prostate cancer patients. Coincidental find-
ings in cancer-negative patients included CD45 and H3Ser10 positive
cells with tetraploidy (DNA content 2.0±0.2), pointing to circulating leu-
kocytes undergoing mitosis. Moreover, vimentin was diffusely
overexpressed in aneuploidic CD45-negative cells in cancer patients,
markedly different from very fine, filamentous vimentin morphologies
observed in both euploidic and tetraploidic white blood cells.
Conclusion: Tumour-associated circulating rare cells have attracted wide-
spread attention as potential biomarkers in cancer. However, basing diag-
nosis and prognosis of cancer on samples usually containing extremely
limited numbers of circulating rare cells continues to pose significant chal-
lenges. The present method is amenable to automated DNA quantification
as well as artificial intelligence-based immunocytomorphological analysis.
It may therefore contribute to a more detailed but clinically robust charac-
terisation of circulating rare cells on laboratory slides, improving reproduc-
ibility and scalability of cytology-based liquid biopsy diagnostics.
Funding: The study was jointly funded by the Thailand Research
Foundation and X-Zell Biotech Pte. Ltd. (Singapore).

Martín Corriente, C. García Castro
*Servicio de Anatomía Patológica, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario
de Canarias, Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias de la Salud,
Universidad de La Laguna, Spain
Background & objectives: Thymomas are uncommon neoplasms.
Relapse after aggressive locoregional treatment is unfrequent.
Metastatic pleural dissemination can occur. However, malignant pleural
effusion is rare. We present a case report, with emphasis on differential
diagnosis and relevance of cell blocks use for immunocytochemistry.
Methods: 53-year-old woman suffering from miastenia gravis was found
to have a mediastinal mass. B3 thymoma diagnosis was made. Margins
were affected. She underwent locorregional radiotherapy. After 4 years of
follow-up, disease relapsed as pleural nodules. She started systemic che-
motherapy. Stable disease was achieved. 10 months later, she developed
pleural effusion. Cytospins and cell blocks were evaluated.
Results: Small/medium size atypical cells were commonly seen in be-
tween scattered mesothelial cells. They showed high nuclear/cytoplasm
ratio, anisonucleosis and clumsy chromatin. Immunophenotype was pos-
itive for CD99 and TdT. It was negative for P40, PAX8, CK19 and
CK20. Pleural cavity involvement by thymoma was established.
Conclusion: Thymomas can rarely give rise to pleural effusions.
Diagnosis can be challenging. Detailed review of the patient's personal
history and immunocytochemistry remains crucial to clarify differential
diagnosis. Cell blocks, if available, can be very useful.

Cytomorphological and clinical features of liposarcoma in peritoneal
effusion
S. Erdogan-Durmus*
*Basaksehir Cam and Sakura City Hospital, Department of Pathology,
Cytopathology Division, Turkey
Background & objectives: The metastasis or dissemination of sarcomas
to the pleural and peritoneal effusions are very challenging for diagnosis
because they can mimic carcinomas and mesotheliomas. Here a case of a
liposarcoma dissemination in peritoneal effusion was presented.
Methods: A 78-year-old female patient presented complaining of ab-
dominal pain and swelling for 3 months. Free fluid and implants were
detected in the peritoneum. The sampling was made from the free fluid
and send our laboratory without medical history. A PAP staining slide
and a cell block obtained from peritoneal fluid by prepared with liquid-
based cytology (Surepath, BD®).
Results: Cytologic examination of the peritoneal fluid demonstrated
discohesive tumour cells with large, hyperchromatic nuclei, with mostly
multiple nucleoli, showing prominent pleomorphism and a small number
of mesothelial cells, histiocytes, mixed type inflammatory cells. When the
patient's medical history explored we found that she had been operated for
liposarcoma twice before and now had a mass extending to the femoral
area. In the immunohistochemical examination of cell block tumour cells
were positive for CDK4, S100, Calretinin and negative for BerEp4. With
these findings the case was reported as "Tumour infiltration with marked
pleomorphism, liposarcoma dissemination in peritoneal effusion".
Conclusion: Cytologic diagnosis of metastasis or dissemination of
liposarcoma to the effusions is difficult due to its rarity and resemblance
to carcinoma or malignant mesothelioma. It should be kept in mind in the
differential diagnosis of malignant effusions. Workup on cell blocks helps
in the differential diagnosis.

*Basaksehir Cam and Sakura City Hospital, Department of Pathology,
Cytopathology Division, Turkey
Background & objectives: Programmed death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) have
become an important option in the treatment of advanced cancers. In our
study, we aimed to evaluate the PD-L1 staining properties and adequacy
of cell blocks obtained by fine needle aspiration.
Methods: The 14 cases were included the study that PD-L1 performed to
cell blocks immunohistochemically. PD-L1 (22C3)[Dako ®(22C3)] an-
tibody was applied in an automated immunohistochemistry device
(Ventana BenchMark XT.®) Membranous staining of any intensity
above 1% in tumour cells was accepted as positive. The percentage of
severity of staining was noted. Demographic and clinical data were ob-
tained from pathology reports.
Results: In total of 14 cases were consisted of 11 lung non – small cell
carcinoma (NSCC), 1 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 2 pleural ma-
lignant effusion (lung adenocarcinoma metastasis).
In 4 cases cell blocks were prepared with alcohol-formalin method, in 10
cases cell blocks were prepared with liquid-based cytology (Surepath,
BD®) fixative (LBC-F).
PD-L1 staining results: 1 case (7.1%) was unsatisfactory, 6 cases (42.9%)
were negative, 7 cases (50%) were positive (in varying degrees). The
unsatisfactory case belonged to a malignant pleural effusion. The 2 of
the negative cases cell blocks prepared with alcohol-formalin whereas the
4 of negative cases’ cell blocks prepared with LBC-F.
Conclusion: The cell blocks prepared from cytological specimens are suit-
able for evaluation of PD-L1 expressions. Our number of cases is restricted,
but no difference was found between the cell blocks prepared with the
conventional method (alcohol-formalin) and the liquid-based cytology
method in terms of adequacy and negative or positive PD-L1 staining.

*First Department of Pathology, Medical School, National and
Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: Cytologic examination of cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) is a diagnostic modality useful in differentiating between infectious
and malignant diseases of the central nervous system. We present a case
of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis from gastric carcinoma, with neurolog-
ical deficits as its initial manifestation.
Methods: A 60-year-old man with no medical history, other than recent
headaches, presented due to an episode of loss of consciousness without
loss of bladder or bowel control. Physical examination, echocardiogram,
cranial CT and MRI, intracranial arteriography and CT scan of neck,
chest and the abdomen demonstrated no pathological findings.
Ophthalmoscopy revealed bilateral papilledema and a lumbar puncture
was carried out.
Results: CSF pressure was up to 40 cmH20 (with an upper limit of
20 cmH2O) and biochemical analysis showed an elevated protein
content (1196 mg/L, normal range 150-450 mg/L). Cytologic exam-
ination of CSF revealed the presence of numerous malignant cells,
single or in groups, that exhibited large, often lobulated nuclei with
distinct nucleoli, high nuclear pleiomorphism and elevated nuclear
to cytoplasmic ratio with rare mitotic activity. Immunocytochemical
positivity for pankeratin and BerEp4 was observed in malignant
cells. Gastroscopy was conducted, and histological examination of
a small ulcerative lesion in the angular incisure revealed the infil-
tration from a poorly differentiated, poorly cohesive gastric adeno-
carcinoma with signet ring morphology.
Conclusion: CSF cytology may be very efficient in diagnosing second-
ary malignancy, even at the rare setting of unknown primary gastric
carcinoma.

Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma ALK positive: a case report
P. Aguiar*, I. Santos Costa
*Federal University of Ceará, Brazil
Background & objectives: Angiomatoid fibrohistiocytoma (AFH) is a
rare tumour representing about 0.3% of soft tissue tumours. The biolog-
ical behaviour and histogenesis are uncertain. The article aims to describe
and discuss a case of ALK positive AFH that was first diagnosed as an
inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour.
Methods: A 34-year-old female presented with a heterogenous solid
expansile formation measuring approximately 5.0 cm with regular limits
and in close contact with the adjacent muscle planes in the left superior
member.
Results: A first biopsy was performed, which showed proliferation of spin-
dle cells with light nuclear pleomorphism, with a centre presenting an orga-
nized haemorrhagic process and hemosiderin deposits. An immunohisto-
chemical study was recommended, with positivity for desmin, vimentin and
smooth muscle actin, which favoured a diagnosis of inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumour. However, after a request for revision by the assis-
tant physician, and the absence of clinical response, the panel was expanded
and positivity for ALK was observed, which allowed, together with the
morphological findings, to close the diagnosis of AFH ALK positive.
Conclusion: Positivity for ALK in AFH cases was unknown until the
current year (2019), and very recent studies have appeared that confirm
this finding. Until then, these cases showing positivity for ALK were
considered to be inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour. This is a strong
example of how advances in molecular and biomarker studies are accom-
panied by evolution and even changes in the diagnostic criteria of some
diseases over time.

Palmoplantar lichen nitidus: case report
P. Aguiar*, I. Santos Costa
*Federal University of Ceará, Brazil
Background & objectives: Lichen nitidus (LN) is located mainly in the
trunk and genitalia. The presence of LN in others parts of body, such as
palmoplantar region and nails is rare. The article aims to describe and
discuss a case of LN in an unusual region.
Methods: Female, 59 years old, reported scaly lesions on palms and plants,
asymptomatic, about five months ago. The clinical hypotheses were con-
tact dermatitis, psoriasis and dehydrosis. There were no injuries elsewhere.
Results: Histopathological examination shows a dermis containing a
well-defined focal lichenoid infiltrate, composed of lymphocytes and
histiocytes and located just below the epidermis, between two elongated
epidermal ridges. The cornea shows hyperparaceratosis just above the
affected dermal region.
Conclusion: Cases like this tend to be underdiagnosed and can be a
diagnostic hint for lichen nitidus lesions in other parts of the body, as
they may appear isolated or accompanied by a classic condition. So, when
there is a picture of palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, one must remember and
look for lichen nitidus palmoplantar.

Fungus mycosis rich in spongiosis: a case report
P. Aguiar*, I. Santos Costa, N.T. Bezerra Araújo, L.d.O. Medeiros
*Federal University of Ceará, Brazil
Background & objectives: Mycosis fungoides(MF)is the most common
type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and can present with a wide spec-
trum of clinical and pathological manifestations and mimic different der-
matoses, such as eczema and interface dermatitis. The article aims is
describe and discuss case of spongiotic MF.
Methods: Female, 32 years old, for more than 15 years with a picture of
hypochromic macules disseminated in the upper and lower limbs, asymp-
tomatic, associated with discretely scaly erythematous plaques in the
trunk. The clinical hypotheses were mycosis fungoides, nevus, indeter-
minate leprosy and pityriasis alba.
Results: The patient presents previous biopsies with diagnoses of
spongiotic dermatitis. Failing to respond to treatment, a new biopsy
was performed. The new histopathological exam shows an epider-
mis with elongation of the epithelial ridges accompanied by moder-
ate lymphocytic epidermotropism and the presence of extensive
moderate spongiosis.
Conclusion: Among the histological variants of MF, mild spongiosis can
be seen in MF in the plaque stage, but it is an uncommon finding. We
present this case to show the diagnostic pitfall associated with spongiotic
presentations of MF, reinforcing, once again, that the pathological clinical
relationship in cases like this is of cardinal importance, as they can be
routinely conducted as a reactive eczematous process.
Key words: Mycosis fungoides; Eczema; Cutaneous lymphoma.

Necrotizing infundibular crystalline folliculitis: case report
P. Aguiar*, I. Santos Costa, K.D. Diogenes Saldanha
*Federal University of Ceará, Brazil
Background & objectives: Necrotizing infundibular crystalline follicu-
litis (NICF) is a rare disorder, of unknown aetiology, which was first
described by Lucke et al in 1999. The article aims to describe and discuss
a case of necrotizing infundibular crystalline folliculitis mimicking an-
other follicular condition.
Methods: Female, 41 years old, with papules in the anterior trunk region.
Diagnostic hypotheses were made of Grover's Disease, Miliaria and
Virchows Arch
Folliculitis. The initial biopsy was interpreted as suppurative folliculitis and
afterrevision,deepcutsandpolarizedlight,adefinitivediagnosiswasmade.
Results: Histopathological examination revealed a dilated follicular osti-
um containing crystalline material associated with parakeratosis and the
analysis of polarized light showed birefringence and special staining
(Alcian Blue) detected deposition of mucin.
Conclusion: NICF presents itself as folliculocentric papules with a predi-
lection for seborrheic areas and histologically contains deposits of birefrin-
gent crystalline material, in addition to partially necrotic follicular epitheli-
um and parakeratosis. Previous studies suggest that NICF may be caused by
complex interactions between surface microorganisms and skin-derived
lipids. So, it can be concluded that NICF is a rare disorder that should be
remembered as a differential diagnosis of folliculitis when seeing a deposit
of crystalline material in an enlarged follicular ostio.

*1. Department of Morphological Disciplines, Faculty of Medicine and
Pharmacy Oradea, University of Oradea; 2. Department of Pathology,
County Clinical Emergency Hospital Oradea, Romania
Background & objectives: Malignant fibrous histiocytoma is a neo-
plasm believed to originate from primitive mesenchymal cells, arising
from soft tissue or bone, usually in the extremities. It is now referred to
as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and is classified under the
undifferentiated/unclassified sarcomas group.
Methods: We present the case of a 76-year-old woman, with multiple
comorbidities, who addresses the dermatology department for a big fore-
head tumour. The inspection revealed a mass, highly attached to the skin,
which also involved the left eyebrow, having a nodular form, increased
consistency, with variable crusts on the surface, thus considering a pre-
sumptive diagnose of squamous cell carcinoma.
Results: At gross appearance it was described a skin excision that on the
surface presented a nodular, ulcerated, whitish nodular formation, with the
dimensions of 3.5 / 3 cm. Microscopic examination revealed the fragment
of the skin showing a tumour proliferation in the form of nodules that have
infiltrative appearance in the adipose and adjacent striated muscle tissue, the
proliferation being consisted of fibroblastic and histiocyte-like cells, single
or multiple nuclei, bizarre/monstrous nuclei, with high mitotic rate (> 10/10
HPF). The nodules have various aspects with a fasciculate or storiform
pattern with the following immunohistochemistry profile: AE1/AE3-,
Vimentin+, CD68+, SMA focal+, Desmin-, S100-, CD34-. Tumoral ne-
crosis absent and clean surgical margins.
Conclusion: Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma located at the head
and neck is very rare and uncommon and it should be a differential of a
deeper lying cutaneous/subcutaneous lesion. It frequently presents in an
advanced stage in older patients. Regarding histologic diagnose, with
highly undifferentiated cells, it requires a wide immunohistochemistry
panel to determine tumour cell lines.

Njim, R. Hadhri, A. Zakhama
*Department of Pathology, Chu Fattouma Bourguiba Monastir, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) is a rare be-
nign proliferative disorder of histiocytes in the lymph nodes with or
without extranodal involvement. RDD limited to the skin without nodal
involvement is a very rare condition.
Methods: We report a new case of RDD of the skin over the abdomen
diagnosed in the department of pathology of the University Hospital of
Monastir with a review of the literature.
Results: We describe the case of a 65-year-old female with a history of
cholecystectomy presenting with a nodule of 2cm in the abdominal scar.
Physical examination showed no lymphadenopathy or any extra-
cutaneous lesions. The nodule was excised for histopathological exami-
nation. Microscopically, the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue were
composed of fibrosis including many clusters of large histiocytes
exhibiting emperipolesis, among many plasma cells, lymphocytes and
neutrophils. Immunohistochemically, the histiocytes were positive for
S-100 protein and CD68 but negative for CD 1a.
Conclusion: RDD is a rare, benign condition especially difficult to diag-
nose due to lack of general symptoms and lymphadenopathy.
Histopathologic examination with immunohistochemical staining,
exhibiting characteristic and reproducible findings play a key role in
establishing an accurate diagnosis.

*Unit of Anatomic Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine,
University of Pavia, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Italy
Background & objectives: Reticulohistiocytosis is a group of rare con-
ditions, included in the C(utaneous)-group of the 2016 classification of
histiocytosis. According to the most recent revision, it encompass five
different clinical syndromes all characterized by a common and distinc-
tive histopathological picture.
Methods: We describe the case of a 39-years old woman with a history of
primary biliary cholangitis and diffuse severe symmetric arthralgia with
synovitis, presenting to our attention with a progressive erythematous and
itchy papular eruption on her ears, trunk, and limbs, worsening especially
above the hand joints, after pregnancy. A cutaneous biopsy concludes for
a diagnosis of reticulohistiocytosis.
Results: Histopathological examination of the skin biopsy revealed a
monomorphous dermal infiltrate made of CD163+, CD68R/PGM1+,
S100p+/-, CD1a-, large-sized mono-, bi- and multinucleated cells with
abundant deeply eosinophilic ground-glass cytoplasm dissecting the colla-
gen bundles and admixed with T cells and granulocytes. Occasional figures
of emperipolesis of granulocytes were seen. No foamy, Touton, or
Langhans cells were seen. The Ki67 index was 3%. The histopathological
findings together with the history of arthropathy and the dermatological
picture lead to a final diagnosis of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis.
Conclusion: First described in 1957 by Goltz and Laymon, multicentric
reticulohistiocytosis is a distinctive clinical syndrome, generally affecting
young women with a history of autoimmunity. In up to a third of patients,
multicentric reticulohistiocytosis associates with epithelial neoplasms,
contrarily to the more typical association with haematological neoplasms
of multisystem non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis such as Erdheim-
Chester disease. Therefore, the pathologist should be aware of the impli-
cation of this diagnosis allowing a correct and rapid clinical evaluation
with exclusion of underlining neoplastic conditions.

Benign cephalic histiocytosis: a forgotten self-healing condition of
childhood
A. Bonometti*, E. Passoni, E. Berti
*Unit of Anatomic Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine,
University of Pavia, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Italy
Background & objectives: Benign cephalic histiocytosis (BCH) is an
exceedingly rare dermatological disorder characterized by a papular
Virchows Arch
eruption over the head and neck region, in the first years of life, with the
tendency toward spontaneous involution within three years after the clin-
ical presentation.
Methods: An otherwise healthy 2-months-old Hispanic boy come to our
attention with a skin eruption characterized by few erythematous-
yellowish papules spread over his face, neck and upper trunk. Darier sign
was negative. This lesion increased in number over the first year of life
and later started to involute and disappear leaving only an hypopigmented
halo. A diagnostic biopsy was performed.
Results: The skin biopsy revealed a cupoliform dermal proliferation made
of benign-looking medium-sized mononuclear cells with ovoidal nuclei
with prominent nucleoli, a small amount of nondescript cytoplasm, and
poorly defined cell borders admixed with few perivascular CD3+ T-cell.
No foamy, ground-glass of multinucleated histiocyte were seen. The
mononuclear cells were CD163+, CD68R/PGM1+, fXIIIa+, CD14+,
S100p+, CD1a-, CD117-. Although the same histological picture may be
seen in the early phases of generalized eruptive histiocytosis, the clinical-
pathological correlation allows concluding with a diagnosis of BCH.
Conclusion: First described by Gianotti et.al in 1971, BCH is a distinc-
tive paediatric skin-limited histiocytosis characterized by the specific lo-
calization in the upper part of the body and a self-limiting disease course.
Most patients are under a year of age and sexes are equally affected.
Histopathologically BCH overlaps with generalized eruptive histiocytosis
and the early phase of xanthogranuloma but displays typical comma-
shaped bodies and coated vesicles at the ultrastructural examination.
Correct diagnosis of BCH prevents unnecessary and possibly harmful
treatment.

Eccrine porocarcinoma of the scalp: a case report
G.E. Cecikoglu*, B. Cobanoglu Simsek
*Medeniyet University Prof. Dr. Suleyman Yalcin City Hospital
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Eccrine porocarcinoma is a rare malignant
tumour of eccrine sweat gland tumour, comprising 0.005% of all malig-
nant epithelial tumours. In this case report, we are presenting a rare case of
eccrine porocarcinoma of the scalp in a 62-year-old male.
Methods: He presented with gradually increasing painless lobulated
mass at the parietal region of the scalp. It was 4,5x4x3 cm in dimension
and not fixed with underlying structures. CT scan of the brain did not
show any intracranial extension and no calcification was noted in the
tumour. Wide local excision was applied with a 1 cm margin around it.
Results: Grossly, the specimen was exophytic, pigmented, and irregular
in appearance with surface ulceration. The cut surface of the tumour
showed a grey-white appearance. Microscopic examination revealed an
epidermis with an ulcerated appearance in the focal area. Malignant cells
in lobular masses and islands were composed of large, basaloid neoplastic
cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. Lobular masses or islands with cystic
cavities connected with the epidermis and infiltrated the dermal tissue.
The islands were separated by thick fibrous septae. There were many
mitotic figures along with duct formation. Immunohistochemistry
showed positive immunostaining for P63, P16, p53 and negative immu-
nostaining for BEREP-4, CD10. CEA and EMA were positive in the duct
formation.
Conclusion: The case was diagnosed as eccrine porocarcinoma. Eccrine
porocarcinomas even rarer but pathologists should consider this neo-
plasm in the differential diagnosis of malign skin tumours.

Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia with multinucleated
cells: a different histomorphologic presentation
Z.C. Olgun, G.E. Cecikoglu*, A.N. Toksoz Yildirim, S. Ozkanli, B.
Cobanoglu Simsek
*Medeniyet University Prof. Dr. Suleyman Yalcin City Hospital
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophil-
ia (ALHE), also known as epithelioid haemangioma is a benign disease
presenting with red-brown papules or nodules, usually located at the head
and neck region.
Methods: Here we report a 61-year-old female patient presented with
multiple nodules located at the scalp which were present for several years.
These nodules were diagnosed clinically as dermatofibroma. Three of the
nodules were excised and examined pathologically.
Results: Histopathologic examination revealed ill-circumscribed, evident
vascular proliferation with noticeably plump epithelioid endothelial cells
with intracytoplasmic vacuoles. These endothelial cells were positive
with CD31 and CD34. There were inflammatory infiltrate dominated
by eosinophils with lymphocytes, isolated plasma cells, and histiocytes
around the vessels. Mitoses and pleomorphism were not seen as expected.
In this case, besides these common histomorphologic appearances there
were several interstitial multinucleated giant cells. These multinucleated
cells were positive with CD68 therefore histiocytic origin was proved.
The presence of multinucleated giant cells in ALHE has rarely been
described, we were able to find only three previous case reports.
Conclusion: ALHE is a benign lesion, so complete surgical excision is
recommended as the optimum treatment, without negative surgical mar-
gins recurrences might occur. ALHE’s aetiology is not clearly known,
infection, hormonal factors, and trauma are the suspected reasons. The
uniqueness of this case was the presence of multinucleated giant cells,
therefore we should be aware of different histomorphological features in
these lesions.

A rare phenomenon: aesthetic complaint reveals undiagnosed meta-
static colonic adenocarcinoma in asymptomatic patient
A.M. Ciongariu*, A. Dumitru, M. Costache, A. Marin, A. Gont, D.
Tapoi, C. Postoronca, M. Sajin
*University Emergency Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Cutaneous colonic adenocarcinoma metas-
tases are extremely rare clinical events and they pose a diagnostic prob-
lem, as their histomorphology highly resembles that of adnexal adenocar-
cinoma NOS. Our purpose: gaining further knowledge about the differ-
ential diagnosis of skin tumours with glandular differentiation.
Methods: Our Department of Pathology received a cutaneous fragment,
samples from which were fixed with 10% buffered formalin and were
processed by conventional histopathological methods, using paraffin em-
bedding, sectioning and Haematoxylin–Eosin (HE) staining. Afterwards,
the sections were deparaffinized and prepared for immunohistochemical
staining, the following markers having been used: CDX2, GATA3, CK7,
CK20 and HER2.
Results: We report a 68-year-old female patient with no significant his-
tory, who presented with a 1 cm ulcerated skin nodule localised on the
frontal right hairline. Upon gross examination, the lesion exhibited ele-
vated, poorly circumscribed margins and solid consistency. The micro-
scopic findings consisted of a poorly circumscribed malignant prolifera-
tion of atypical epithelial cells, exhibiting duct and gland formation af-
fecting the superficial and deep dermis. In order to differentiate between
an adnexal adenocarcinoma NOS and a metastatic lesion, an MRI scan
was performed which showed a colonic tumoral mass and hepatic and
vertebral metastatic nodules. Intensely positive CDX2 immunohisto-
chemical staining confirmed the diagnosis of colonic adenocarcinoma
metastasis.
Conclusion: Cutaneous tumours with glandular differentiation represent
rare entities that require a thorough and diligent examination by means of
histopathological and immunohistochemical study. Cutaneous colonic
adenocarcinoma metastasis are also exceptionally identified, but always
Virchows Arch
indicate an advanced stage of the disease that accounts for a poor
prognosis.

Atypical Spitz nevus – the childhood dilemma – a case presentation
I.G. Cocuz*, R. Niculescu, M.C. Popelea, A. Sabău, M. Marginean, O.S.
Cotoi
*Pathophysiology Department, University of Medicine, Pharmacy,
Sciences and Technology George Emil Palade of Targu Mures, Romania
Background & objectives: Atypical Spitz nevus, defined as borderline
lesions from the histological point of view, are described as Spitz tumours
with at least one atypical feature, which can resemble the histological
characteristics of the melanoma. The lesion is mostly found in childhood.
Methods: We present the case of an 11-year-old female patient which
was clinical diagnosed with low extremities haemangioma. The tumour
was surgical removed and sent to the Pathology Laboratory for histopath-
ological diagnostic. We have performed H&E staining and immunohis-
tochemistry (S100, SOX10, Melan A and HMB45) on the received tissue
samples.
Results: Grossing revealed a tumour of 13x12x5mm with a cell prolifer-
ation in the entire dermis and hypodermis in the form of nests with
vertical disposition towards the basement membrane, consisting of spin-
dle, rhomboidal and epithelioid cells, the cell nests varying in size. Cells
in the superficial dermis are large and rhomboidal, in the middle dermis
are slightly discoid and have a polygonal shape and in the deep areas
become oval with a deep maturation phenomenon and no pagetoid mi-
gration. About 3-6mitoses 10HPF/(40x) are present in all layers of the
dermis. Immunohistochemically, cells are SOX10,S100 positive and
HMB45 negative. MelanA is focally positive in superficial and middle
dermis. Ki67 is below 1%.
Conclusion: Due to the fact that the tumour does not present the histo-
pathological features of Spitz nevi and neither the criteria for melanoma,
and also taking in consideration the tumour dimensions, patients age (11
years), the localization on the low extremities, the nodular aspect, the
extension to the deep dermis and hypodermis and the presence of mitoses,
the lesion described as atypical Spitz tumour must be clinical and
paraclinical supervised for possible recurrences and adequate treatment.

Osteo-nevus of Nanta (complete osseous metaplasia in a benign
melanocytic nevus): an uncommon phenomenon
A. Dumitru*, C.A. Anghel, A. Marin, M. Costache, M. Sajin, O.
Pătrașcu, S. Băloi, M. Tampa
*Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Romania
Background & objectives: Nanta's osteo-nevus is a rare tumour charac-
terized by osseous metaplasia in a nevus. Heidesfield described it in 1908,
and it was published in 1911 by French dermatologist André Nanta. Very
few cases have been reported so far in the literature.
Methods: We present the case of a 31-year-old woman who presented to
her general practitioner with a mole in the chin region. The tumour was
surgically excised and submitted to the Pathological Anatomy department
for microscopic evaluation using suitable techniques. The "en dome"
tumour had an irregular surface of brown-grey colour, was round-oval,
measuring approximately 8/8/3 mm.
Results: The tumour showed a proliferation of medium and large nevus
cells with no cyto-nuclear atypia or mitotic figures. Nevic cells formed
nests, clusters and cords of varying sizes in superficial and deep dermis
with focal involvement of the dermo-epidermal junction. Some nevus
cells were highly pigmented, while others are multinucleated. Tumour
proliferation is characterized by the maturation of nevus cells from the
deep dermis to the surface, with multiple Wagner-Meissner type
neurotization, pseudolymphatic spaces, and unusual lipomatous dystro-
phy of some nevic cells. A large region with complete bone metaplasia
was found in the deep area of the tumour proliferation, composed of
haversian-type bone lamellae and dystrophic calcified bone spikes.
Conclusion: The histological diagnosis was osteonevus of Nanta. The
immunohistochemical study confirmed the benign nature of the lesion,
with positivity for the markers such as S-100, MART-1, SOX10 and a
low Ki67 index. The phenomenon does not appear to be related to a poor
prognosis, even though bone metaplasia has been described in other skin
tumours, some malignant such as melanoma. Therefore, the findings of
ossification in excised melanocytic lesions should not be underestimated.

Bednar tumour with peculiar fibrosarcomatous features
A. Dumitru*, M. Costache, M. Sajin, O. Pătrașcu, A.M. Ciongariu, D.M.
Ionescu, M. Tampa
*Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Romania
Background & objectives: Bednar tumour is an uncommon pigmented
variant of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. This tumour is mostly seen
in adults and has a predisposition to affect the shoulder region. We report
a rare case of Bednar tumour in a 72-year-old female patient.
Methods: A 72-year-old female presented with right shoulder swelling
present since few months and gradually increasing in size. A complete
excision was performed. The tumour was just beneath the skin,
uncircumscribed, non-capsulated extending into the deep subcutaneous
fat and measuring 6.3 × 4 × 5.7 cm. Grossly, focal areas of pigmentation
were noticed towards the periphery of the tumour.
Results: The tumour was a spindle cell lesion abutting the epidermis and
invading the underlying dermis and subcutaneous fat. The tumour cells
had a storiform grow pattern. There were scattered pigment-laden cells
throughout the lesion. On higher magnification, the spindle cells were
monomorphic with eosinophillic cytoplasm and plump nuclei with taper-
ing edges. A tumour contingent has been identified consisting of cells
with high grade nuclear pleomorphism and relatively common
monstrous-looking bizarre cells. The tumour was mitotically active.
Also, areas of necrosis or haemorrhage were noted. The above-
mentioned features lead to the diagnosis of Bednar tumour with
fibrosarcomatous features. Currently the patient is on regular follow-up
without any recurrences.
Conclusion: To conclude, though rare, it is important for the histopathol-
ogists to be aware and recognize this unusual entity and distinguish it
from other pigmented spindle cell lesions. It is also important to mention
the fibrosarcomantous transformation of these lesions to correctly esti-
mate the risk of recurrence.

Atypical hidradenoma; a rare case report
E. Genc Erdogan*, M. Azatçam, N. Can, İ. Usta, E. Mercan Demirtaş
*Department of Pathology, Lüleburgaz State Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Hidradenomas are benign dermal, adnexal
neoplasms that are nodules with cystic foci in the dermis; however, atyp-
ical hidradenomas are lesions that are thought to have borderline charac-
teristics including cytological atypia or lack of circumscription, higher
rate of recurrence, and malignancy.
Methods: 57-year- old male patient presented with a subcutaneous mass
on his left arm. Excisional biopsy was performed with a clinical diagnosis
as a benign haemorrhagic cyst.
Results: Grossly, 4x3x2,1 cm sized, subcutaneous mass, with a central
cyst containing papillary structures on the inner surface was observed.
Histological examination revealed, a dermal tumoral lesion with lobules
consisting of cystic and solid areas There was no obvious infiltrative
growth pattern. Tumour cells had clear eosinophilic cytoplasms, round
nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemical studies revealed
positivity with EMA and p53. Ki67 index was 5-6%. The final diagnosis
was Hidradenoma, but it was noted that it should be managed clinically as
Virchows Arch
atypical hidradenoma/hidradenoma of uncertain malignant potential due
to the mitotic index> 2/10 HPF, the presence of suspicious
lymphovascular invasion, and the progression of small irregular tumour
layers in one area.
Conclusion: Atypical hidradenomas may exhibit worrisome histological
features for increased risk of recurrence and possible malignant potential.
Therefore, if focal atypical features such as focal border irregularities,
nuclear pleomorphism, and increased mitotic activity are observed, atyp-
ical hidradenoma should be kept in mind.

A rare variant of lichen planus; lichen planus pigmentosus-inversus;
a case report
E. Genc Erdogan*, M. Azatçam, F. Deniz, E. Mercan Demirtaş
*Department of Pathology, Lüleburgaz State Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Lichen planus pigmentosus (LPP) is an un-
common variant of lichen planus. However, LPP-inversus, is an extreme-
ly rare variant of LPP and occurs as dark-brown macules and patches in
the axilla, inguinal creases, flexural areas.
Methods: A 52-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic with
a 5-months history of asymptomatic, hyperpigmented, unilateral lesions
in the groin. Physical examination revealed 2 brownish patches with well-
defined borders on the left inguinal fold. A skin punch biopsy was per-
formed from one of the patches.
Results: Histopathological examination revealed, orthokeratotic atrophic
epidermis, ill-defined rete ridges (loss of rete ridges), vacuolar basal cell
change in the basal layer. There were mild spongiosis and necrotic
keratinocytes (Civatte bodies) in the epithelium. Band-like mild mono-
nuclear infiltration was observed at the dermo-epidermal junction, while
perivascular inflammatory infiltration, disperse pigment incontinence,
and melanophages were observed in the upper part of the dermis. The
diagnosis of lichen planus pigmentosus inversus (LPP-inversus) was con-
firmed on account of clinical appearance and histopathological findings.
Conclusion: LPP-inversus is a rare variant among all clinical subtypes of
lichen planus. Quite a few cases were reported since this clinical entity
had been defined. LPP-inversus should be noted in the differential diag-
nosis of cutaneous pigmentation, especially in the flexural regions.
Histopathological findings are almost similar with LPP; therefore, the
diagnosis should be made by histopathological and clinical correlation.
Briefly, one more LPP-inversus case report has been added to the litera-
ture known to date through our case report.

X. Grammatoglou*, F. Antoniadou, A. Kostopoulou, S. Pappa, K. Douli,
D. Tsoutsos, T. Choreftaki
*General Hospital of Athens "G. Gennimatas", Department of Pathology,
Greece
Background & objectives: Primary extramammary Paget’s disease is a
rare cutaneous malignancy that accounts for 6,5% of all cutaneous
Paget’s disease. It originates in the epidermis or apocrine sweat glands
and is not associated with an underlying carcinoma.
Methods: A 75 years-old woman presented to our hospital having an
erythematous lesion on the scalp for 3 years, that lately has enlarged.
Surgical excision was performed.
Results: The skin specimen revealed a tumour measuring 1,8cm in
greatest diameter, with a white cut surface. Microscopical examination
showed malignant glandular epithelial cells with abundant and clear cy-
toplasm, usually containing mucin and pleomorphic hyperchromatic nu-
cleus, organized in nest-like or gland like structures located intradermally,
with invasion of the papillary and reticular dermis, invasion of adnexal
structures and pagetoid spread to the epidermis. Immunohistochemically
the tumour cells stained positive for CK7, Cam5.2, EMA, pCEA,
GCDFP-15, ERBB2(3+), GATA3 and for S100, Mart-1, HMB45,CK5/
6, CK20, ER, PgR, Ca125, p63, NF were negative.
Conclusion: Given to the location, the histological-morphological and
immunohistochemical features and the free history of malignancy, a di-
agnosis of primary extramammary Paget’s disease was performed. The
patient underwent wider local excision and 8 months after is free of
recurrence.

EBV-positive lymphoproliferative disorder MTX-related in a patient
with ankylosis spondylitis
È. Iglesias Martínez*, A.P. Martínez Aracil, N. Santiago Quispe, M.M.
Buda, Á. Pérez Rodríguez, A. Onaindia Pérez
*Clinical Department Unit of Pathological Anatomy, OSI Araba, Araba
University Hospital; Bioaraba Health Research Institute, Vitoria-Gasteiz,
Alava, Spain
Background & objectives: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic
systemic inflammatory disease of the axial skeleton. Recent meta-
analysis has calculated an increased risk for lymphoma in patients with
AS. The main theory about lymphomagenesis linking rheumatic diseases
is the continued immune stimulation.
Methods: We present the case of 86-year-old woman with erythematous
subcutaneous nodules on her right arm. Careful anamnesis revealed 35-
year history of ankylosis spondylitis (AS), with negative HLA-B27, treat-
ed with corticoids and methotrexate (MTX). Four consecutive skin punch
biopsies were obtained with a diagnosis of no-necrotizing granulomatous
dermatitis and panniculitis. The treatment given was unhelpful and an-
other biopsy was performed.
Results: Histologically, the last skin punch was characterized by no-
ulcerated epidermis, dermal proliferation of medium-sized lympho-
cytes accompanied by abundant histocytes in perivascular and
periadnexal areas. Some scattered eosinophils were also seen.
Hypodermis showed a panniculitis pattern with small granulomas.
Immunohistochemically neoplastic cells were: CD20(+)/EBV(+
)/CD56(-)/CD10(-)/BCL6(-), with confirmed monoclonality. The di-
agnosis of EBV-positive polymorphic lymphoproliferative disorder
MTX-related was made. Withdrawal of MTX was decided with skin
lesions improvement.
Conclusion: MTX is probably the most common antirheumatic drug,
causing a iatrogenic immunosuppression and reactivate latent EBV infec-
tion. Even though the fact that multiple research groups concluded that
MTX is not associated with increased risk of lymphoma, spontaneous
regression of these lymphoproliferative disorders in some cases after drug
withdrawal underscores the putative pathogenic role of MTX in EBV
positive-LPD.
This case shows the relevance of conducting multiple biopsies in a patient
treated with immunosuppression therapy, to rule out a lymphoprolifera-
tive disorder.

Music box keratoderma: an odd tune
D. João*, D. Teixeira, X. Wen, F. Teixeira, A. Sanches
*Department of Anatomic Pathology, Centro Hospitalar de Vila Nova de
Gaia/Espinho, Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Music box keratoderma or spiny keratoder-
ma is a rare dermatosis characterized by multiple discrete papules of the
palms and soles, rendering an appearance similar to old music boxes.
Hereditary and paraneoplastic cases were reported but aetiology is still
largely unknown.
Methods: We present the case of a 68-year-old female without relevant
personal medical history. She was referred to our institution due to small
lesions in her hands, associated with sensation of roughness, since 5 years
ago. There was no known family history of similar complaints. Physical
Virchows Arch
examination revealed several punctiform and keratotic papules in her
palms and soles, which were biopsied.
Results: On histopathological examination, skin with orthokeratosis and
focal columns of parakeratosis arising predominantly from the inter-
adnexal epidermis could be found. These columns were associated with
depression of the underlying epidermis. Additionally, a decrease in both
the thickness of the granular layer and in the number of keratohyalin
granules was identified in these areas, without any dyskeratosis or vacu-
olar changes. There was no significant inflammatory infiltrate and no
signs of malignancy. From these findings, the patient was diagnosed with
music box keratoderma. This is a rare and still mysterious entity and we
reviewed the most recent findings in medical literature, especially regard-
ing its possible aetiologies.
Conclusion: Music box keratoderma is a curious entity which has been
mainly associated with malignancies, including lung and colon cancer,
although there is still debate if it constitutes a true paraneoplastic condi-
tion. Some other cases are hereditary or associated with non-neoplastic
diseases, such as type IV hyperlipoproteinemia and Darier’s disease.
Differential diagnosis includes arsenical keratosis, porokeratosis, multiple
filiform verrucae and Buschke-Fischer-Brauer disease. Patient complains
are essentially cosmetic and a feeling of palmar rugosity. No
malignization of these lesions has been reported.

Post-transplant Squamous Cell Carcinoma with Rhabdoid
Phenotype, a case report
F. Kubba*, G. Mitsopoulos, E. Tsele, L. Florence, R. Rathi, F. Teixeira
*Ealing Hospital, London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust,
Middlesex, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: A 63-year-old man with history of deceased
donor renal transplantation four years previously due to chronic kidney
disease. He was immunosuppressed on Ciclosporin and Mycophenolate
Mofetil treatment. He presented with a recent 10mm keratotic nodule on
the crown.
Methods: Microscopically it showed an ulcerated solid nodular tumour
composed of dyscohesive large nonkeratinizing round plasmacytoid/
rhabdoid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm containing filamen-
tous hyaline inclusions, eccentric nuclei and prominent nucleoli, few
osteoclast-like giant cells and desomosomes. There was a focal area of
a moderately-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Atypical
mitotic count was up to 20 per 10 HPF. No necrosis was seen.
Results: Immunohistochemical stains AE1/AE3, CK5, p63 and CD138
were diffusely positive in the tumour. CD10, Calponin, CD117 and
CD68 had scattered pattern. CD31, CD34, S100, Desmin, SMA and
Melan A were negative. INI stain was retained. Ki67 was high (>70%).
The diagnosis of post-transplant squamous cell carcinoma with rhabdoid
phenotype was made. Previously he also had one SCC and a
keratoacanthoma. Later on he developed two SCCs, no specific type, of
the scalp three years later and in the forehead four years later. Six years
later he developed basal cell carcinoma in his forearm. On literature
review, six cases of the skin and four of the oral cavity were reported.
Conclusion: We present a rare case of immunosuppression-associated
SCC with rhabdoid phenotype (ten previous cases reported) and
osteoclast-like giant cells (reported in one previous case). Their clinical
behaviour is noted to be more aggressive than their usual counterparts. In
our case the patient remains alive after six years. It is advisable to look for
unusual patterns of SCC in post-transplant patients on immunosuppres-
sion. Desmosomes and areas of squamous differentiation may or may not
be present within the tumour.

Trichoblastoma with malignant transformation arising in a young
patient, a case report
F. Kubba*, P. Alieva-Derraz, F. Teixeira, N. Bahar
*Ealing Hospital, London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust,
Middlesex, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: A 28-year-old flight hostess presented with a
lesion in the vertex, enlarging in size over two years. She was sent home
by her GP with the diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis. There was no family
history of similar lesions.
Methods: Clinical details received from the dermatology clinic stated a
nodular dermal tumour in the scalp vertex arising in a background of
naevus sebaceous measuring 15mm in diameter. No palpable regional
lymph nodes were felt.
Macroscopically it was a skin ellipse measuring up to 21 mm with a hair-
baring well-circumscribed keratotic pinkish surface nodule measuring
13x10mm.
Results: Microscopy showed an infiltrating tumour, partly connected to
the epidermis and hair follicles with nests of basaloid cells expressing
central necrosis and areas of hyalinised globules. It had intermediate-
sized cells with basophilic nuclei and frequent mitosis with no peripheral
palisading, retraction artefact or mucin deposition. No melanocyte colo-
nisation, ductal or sebaceous differentiation was noted. The deeper part of
tumour showed infiltrative smaller nests and cords of cells with no sig-
nificant atypia and foci of calcification surrounded by fibrotic stroma,
representing the begin background of a trichoblastoma.
Immunohistochemistry showed staining of the tumour with CK7 and
CAM5.2.
It was negative for EMA, CEA, CK20, S100, SMA, CD56,
Chromogranin A and Synaptophysin.
Conclusion: We presented a case of a young woman with trichoblastic
carcinoma arising in a trichoblastoma. Trichoblastic carcinoma is a rare
follicular tumour with only a handful of cases reported, arising from
longstanding trichoblastomas (mean age of 70 years) including cases of
Brooke-Spiegler’s syndrome. It is rarer in young patients. They can
metastasise to regional lymph nodes. Wide local excision and long term
follow up is advised. Our patient is well and alive after two years and no
metastasis is reported.

Case of melanocytic neurofibroma associated
with neurofibromatosis
C. Leblebici*, B. Noyan, M. Cin, A.E. Koku Aksu
*University of Health Science Istanbul Training and Research Hospital,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Melanotic (pigmented) neurofibroma is a
rare tumour of neural crest origin demonstrating schwannian differentia-
tion, with production of melanin granules. The authors report a case of
melanotic neurofibroma arising in neurofibromatosis.
Methods: A 17-year-old girl with neurofibromatosis type 1 is presented
with a large hyperpigmented plaque on the leg. Significant infiltration and
thickening of the foot dorsum and ankle were present. Also she had many
café au lait spots and numerous neurofibromas. Incisional biopsy was
performed.
Results: In histological examination, the tumour was characterized by
benign spindle cells with schwannian differentiation and located dermis
and subcutaneous fat tissue. In some areas, Wagner–Meissner-like bodies
were visible. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated staining with antibod-
ies to S100, SOX10, Melan-A, HMB45, and CD34.
Conclusion: Final diagnosis was melanocytic neurofibroma. It is very
important to distinguish this tumour from other pigmented tumours, es-
pecially blue nevus and malignant melanoma.

*Department of Pathology, Emergency County Hospital "Pius Brinzeu",
Timisoara, Romania
Background & objectives: Germline mutations in the BRCA-1 associ-
ated tumour protein 1 (BAP1) increase susceptibility to mesothelioma
and other cancers. The prevalence of germline BAP1 mutations in the
general population is not known.
Methods: We present the case of a 30-year-old woman who presented to
the dermatologist with a few, similarly looking cutaneous lesions located
on her face. On examination, the patient had three skin-coloured papules
located preauricular, on her cheek and on the upper lip. Affirmatively,
they appeared during adulthood, approximately 2 and a half years prior
and have increased in size.
Results: On gross examination, the first two lesions were polymorphic:
brown to pinkish, dome-shaped nodules and papules. Histopathological
examination reveals an intradermal melanocytic proliferation with two
populations of cells. The first one consists of small mature-appearing
melanocytic cells resembling common intradermal nevi, and the second
one is a proliferation of large epithelioid (spitzoid) melanocytes.
Immunohistochemistry shows checkerboard p16 staining pattern, Ki-
67<1%, HMB-45 positivity and loss of BAP1 in the large epithelioid
cells. The genetic tests exposed a germline deletion in the BAP1 gene.
Family history reveals that the patient’s mother died at 44 years old from a
meningioma. In addition, the patient’s aunt was diagnosed with
mesothelioma.
Conclusion: To conclude, we have reported histopathological features of
two cutaneous melanocytic tumours with loss of BAP1 expression to-
gether with a germline BAP1 mutation in a case of BAP1-associated
cancer susceptibility syndrome. If a Wiesner nevus is revealed and the
patient has both multiple cutaneous tumours, with or without relevant
family history, genetic tests for tumour predisposition syndrome are
recommended.

Metastatic malignant melanoma on 7-year-old Indonesian girl: a
rare case report
B. Putri*, D.P. Retnani
*Anatomical Pathology Department, University of Brawijaya, Indonesia
Background & objectives: Malignant melanoma in childhood being
even rarer in those younger than 10 years of age. The diagnosis of mel-
anoma in childhood is based upon histopathology and immunohisto-
chemical can be challenging because of its clinical presentations possibly
differing from adult melanoma.
Methods: We report a 7-year-old girl presenting with skin nodule that
developed on the congenital melanocytic nevus on her left femur and an
inguinal lymph node enlargement on the right side, suspicion of a metas-
tasis malignancy. Histopathology examinations, as well as immunohisto-
chemical, were performed on the skin nodule and FNAB was performed
on the inguinal lymph node to establish the diagnosis.
Results: Histopathology and FNAB examinations revealed pleomorphic
cells with occasional cytoplasmic pigment and positive expressions of
immunohistochemical melanocytic marker consistent with the diagnosis
of metastatic malignant melanoma in childhood.
Conclusion: Given the rarity of malignant melanoma in childhood, it is
important to keep in mind that careful analysis of histologic features, as
well as additional information provided by immunohistochemistry,
should allow for a correct diagnosis.

Cutaneous myxoid perineurinoma: a case report and a review
of literature on a rare entity
A.P. Rodrigues*, N.J. Lamas, A. Coelho
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário do Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Perineurioma is a peripheral nerve sheath
tumour that rarely develops in the dermis. It presents mainly on the lower
limbs of middle-aged adults, with female predilection. Perineuriomas
remain underrecognized due to variable morphology and low frequency
reporting in the skin.
Methods: Here we present a case of a 33-year-old male that was referred
by the primary care doctor due to a 2cm buttock nodule with a year of
evolution, that experience a recent growth. Surgical resection of the lesion
was performed with the clinical suspicion of a haemangioma.
Results: We received a 2x1,4x0,6cm cutaneous specimen with 1,4x1,2cm
epidermal nodular lesion, gelatinous-yellowish cut surface. Histological
examination shows a polypoid unencapsulated tumour centred in the der-
mis. The lesion is composed by myxoid areas of bland epithelioid cells with
roundish nuclei, indistinct nucleoli and moderately abundant eosinophilic
cytoplasm and loose collagenous areas of bland elongated spindle cells
with tapered nuclei and scant bipolar cytoplasm. In the spindle cell com-
ponent, the neoplasia has a storiform growth pattern, with focal perivascular
whorls and less myxoid stroma. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells
are EMA and CD34 positive and S100-protein negative.
Conclusion: Perineurioma is a benign peripheral nerve sheath tumour
with perineural differentiation that develops commonly in subcutis or
deep soft tissue and rarely in the dermis, which lowers the awareness
for this entity. Furthermore, cutaneous myxoid perineurinoma is a lesion
easily confused with other diagnoses, such as myxoid fibrous
histiocytoma, low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma or myxoid neurofibroma.
The knowledge for this entity is important for correct diagnosis and to
avoid inappropriate therapy.

Sclerosing cellular neurothekeoma: a case report
Y. Rogov*, N. Kornev, A. Syantovich
*Belarusian Medical Academy, Belarus
Background & objectives: In the last WHO classification of skin tu-
mours (2018) the cellular variant of neurothekeoma was distinguished as
a separate entity, which is negative for S100 and GFAP. We present a
tumour with unusual morphological features resembling a cellular
neurothekeoma.
Methods: A 20-year-old male patient was operated on for painful node of
the skin of the left ankle joint measuring 1.0 cm in diameter. The tumour
was slightly protruding above the surface without altering the surface of
the skin itself. A clinical diagnosis of fibroma was made.
Results: Microscopically, the tumour was located in the dermis and sub-
cutis. It did not have a capsule but had fairly well defined boundaries.
Uniform spindle cells with indistinct cell borders without atypia were ar-
ranged in bundles (being longitudinally oriented), lobules, sometimes cre-
ating a network-like pattern around the sweat glands and blood vessels.
They were regularly high-cellular along the periphery of the cell streams,
and fibrosis and hyalinosis increased towards the centres. Cords of tumour
cells were separated by fibrous stroma with irregular myxomatosis.
Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD34, Vimentin, β-
catenin and negative for Desmin, SMA, S100, GFAP, Calponin, CK,
EMA. The proliferative index determined by Ki-67 was up to 10%.
Conclusion: In our opinion, the presented tumour is a rare variant of
cellular neurothekeoma with unusual ordered sclerosis and is worthy of
discussing by specialists. We were unable to find analogs in the available
literature. The retiform «neurotic» growth pattern around the appendages
of the skin and blood vessels in combination with histological structure
and the immunophenotype, which suggests a fibroblastic differentiation,
are more consistent with the cellular neurothekeoma.

*Sumy State University, Ukraine
Background & objectives: Laser equipment is intensively developing
and used in dermatology and cosmetology. It needs an animal-based
model for practicing new techniques. The purpose of the investigation
is to establish a rat-based model for the study of laser impact on skin.
Methods: 12 black-coated laboratory rats and 6 white-coated ones were
used to test three following power modes of Erbium: Yttrium, Aluminium,
garnet (Er:YAG) Fotona laser (wavelength 2940 nm). Single pulses with
power 1,2, 2,0, 3,0 J/cm2 were used. Macroscopic estimation and a histo-
logical methods on the 7th day after exposure were used.
Results: We found laser effects to be individual, thus 8 rats with black
coating optimal exposure were obtained with 3,0 J/cm2 power and 4 rats
with 2,0 J/cm2 impact power. 2 black rats were discharged from the
experiment because of excess, traumatic laser impact on the skin. White
rats obtained 2,0 and 3,0 J/cm2 power. Macroscopical changes were
similar to clinical appearances with humans after depigmentation and
peeling applications of the laser. Histologically we observed acanthosis
with 2-3 rows of cells within stratum spinosum, granulosis with the ap-
pearance of the more prominent granular layer, and increased amount of
fibroblasts in papillary derma, which correspond to known therapeutic
effects of Er:YAG laser.
Conclusion: 1. Rat’s model can be used for further investigation of laser
impact on skin. 2. Each particular type and model of laser appliance need
to be practiced with a rat line. 3. Establishing laser pulse properties may
be challenging and requires genetically close rats, used in the model;
otherwise, laser dose needs to be established individually.

Collision tumour of an invasive squamous cell carcinoma and atyp-
ical fibroxanthoma
N. Scully*, Z. Abdawn
*Health Education West Midlands, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Collision tumours are tumours where two
histopathologically distinct tumours develop adjacently maintain distinct
borders. To our knowledge, we present the first case in the literature of a
collision tumour between an atypical fibroxanthoma and an invasive
squamous cell carcinoma.
Methods: Clinical case review and review of the topic in published clin-
ical literature.
Results: We present a case of an 83-year-old man with a four-month
history of a rapidly progressive nodule on the vertex of the scalp and
underwent wide local excision. Histological examination showed two
adjacent tumour morphologies within the nodule. The first tumour was
a well differentiated crateriform squamoproliferative lesion with al keratin
horn. This showed diffuse expression of AE1/AE3, CK5/6 and p63 and
was diagnosed as a keratoacanthoma-like squamous cell carcinoma. The
second tumour was composed of fascicles of atypical spindle cells. This
tumour was negative for AE1/AE3, CK5/6, p63, S100, Melan-A, desmin,
SMA, CD31 and CD34 and positive for CD10, and was diagnosed as an
atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX).
Conclusion: Collision tumours in skin are uncommon. Our case repre-
sented a collision tumour between an atypical fibroxanthoma and an
invasive squamous cell carcinoma. This case demonstrates the impor-
tance of detailed histological examination and the role of immunohisto-
chemistry in making the final diagnosis.

Cancer of unknown primary site may always be melanoma
disregarding morphologic appearance – case report and review
of literature
O. Stefan*, L. Cristina, G. Tudor, A. Toma, A. Savin, R. Ardeleanu, D.
Raduta, M. Filip, A. Popa, S.A. Zurac
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Cancer of unknown primary site remains a
demanding condition, as it is by definition metastatic, has a wide range of
biological activity and it is often therapy-resistant. This case report aims
to document a challenging diagnosis.
Methods: A 46-year-old man with no previous history presented to our
hospital with fast-growing axillary and inguinal masses, which were di-
agnosed as adenopathies, were surgically removed and sent to the
Pathology Department. The PET-CT showed multiple osseous, pulmo-
nary and adrenal metastases.
Results: Histopathological examination revealed two massive nodal me-
tastases composed of malignant sarcomatoid and epithelioid cells, resem-
bling a poorly differentiated carcinoma. Both components had a common
and a distinct immunophenotype. The sarcomatoid component stained
positive for HMB45, T311, MelanA, with a weak-to-absent CK7 expres-
sion. The epithelioid component was AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, CD56,
synaptophysin, inhibin positive, with a weak-to-absent HMB45, T311
and calretinin expression. All tumour cells were positive for S100,
SOX10 and MiTF. Various antibody panels were performed to rule out
haematolymphoid, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, pulmonary and
mammary origins. The final diagnosis was metastatic amelanotic mela-
noma with aberrant cytokeratin expression and unknown primary site.
Conclusion: This case report serves as a reminder that melanoma is the
great mimicker. Malignant melanoma with abnormal cytokeratin, inter-
mediate filament or neuroendocrine marker expression can be easily con-
fused with carcinomas, sarcomas or neuroendocrine tumours. It is essen-
tial to be aware of the existence of unusual immunophenotypes in order to
make an accurate diagnosis.

Polypoid Merkel cell carcinoma of the eyelid
N. Moreiras Arias, C. Aliste, M. Bouso, L. Casas Fernández, J.M. Suárez
Peñaranda*
*Department of Pathology, University Hospital Complex of Santiago de
Compostela, Spain
Background & objectives: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an uncom-
mon skin tumour usually arising in the head and neck of elderly people.
Although clinical presentation is diverse, polypoid configuration has been
rarely reported and may pose diagnostic difficulties.
Methods: A 93-year.old man presented with a 1.5cm reddish, peduncu-
late lesion on his right upper eyelid, hindering his vision. Histological
examination revealed a densely cellular neoplasm of small, round cells,
with high proliferative activity. Immunohistochemistry showed diffuse
staining for synaptophysin and chromograninin, while TTF1 was nega-
tive. Cytokeratin-20 showed the characteristic dot-like pattern. Final di-
agnosis was polypoid MCC of the eyelid.
Results: MCC is a rare but aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the
skin, which usually affects older Caucasian men on the head and neck.
Main risk factors are sun exposure, immunosuppression and advanced
age, but Merkel cell polyomavirus is also known to play a role in its
pathogenesis. Palpebral involvement accounts only for 2.5% of cases an
it usually presents as an asymptomatic, solitary, erythematous lesion lo-
cated on the upper eyelid. Differential diagnosis includes both benign and
malignant lesions, such as chalazion, basal cell carcinoma, lymphoma or
keratoacanthoma. Polypoid presentation has been described only excep-
tionally and may be easily interpreted as a banal lesion, mainly a large
skin tag.
Conclusion: These cases are usually diagnosed only after histological
examination, which demonstrates the typical features of MCC.
Immunohistochemistry is confirmatory. In our case, clinical differential
diagnosis included MCC among many other options. Both histopatholo-
gy and immunohistochemistry were typical of this condition. In conclu-
sion, we report an unusual case of polypoid MCC arising on the eyelid.
This unusual configuration is not usually diagnosed clinically and it is
only confirmed after histopathological examination.

Squamoid eccrine ductal carcinoma (SEDC) of the right foot with
locoregional lymph node metastasis
A. Sykaras*, P. Dolkiras, N. Stavrinou, C. Magkou, E. Gioti, E.
Papagianni
*Evangelismos General Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: SEDC is a rare skin carcinoma with biphasic
histological appearance, characterized by squamous and adnexal (sweat
duct) differentiation. SEDC has usually a plaque or nodular appearance
and develops at sun-exposed skin areas of elderly men.
Methods: A 43-year-old woman, ballet dancer, presented with an ulcer-
ated lesion at the great toe of her right foot, growing slowly for three
years. The lesion had a maximum diameter of 1,7cm and was localized
at the nail bed with extension to the skin of the distant phalanx. Biopsies
were taken from these sites.
Results: Histological examination revealed the presence of Bowen dis-
ease and invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the superficial der-
mis. However, the presence of two tumour foci with ductular-glandular
morphology and CK7/EMA-positive immunophenotype in the deep der-
mis raised the suspicion of SEDC. A wide excision with locoregional
lymphadenectomy was subsequently performed and metastatic spread
was identified in two regional lymph nodes. The metastatic foci was
representative of the biphasic nature of SDEC; it consisted of a
moderately-differentiated SCC component and an adenocarcinoma com-
ponent. The latter had prominent nuclear and cytological atypia, numer-
ous mitoses and focal presence of mucin. The glandular tumour cells were
immunopositive for CK7, EMA and CEA.
Conclusion: This is a case of SEDC in unusual location and age It
highlights the difficulty of diagnosing SEDC in superficial biopsies
where the ductal component may not be clearly represented. In contrast
with the skin biopsies, the two components of SEDC were evident in the
lymph node metastasis, confirming our initial diagnosis. Although distant
metastasis is very rare, there is considerable chance of local lymph node
metastasis and recurrence. The patient underwent radiotherapy and is
disease-free, two years after treatment.

The many faces of cutaneous spindle cell tumours: when should we
consider melanoma?
D. Tapoi*, A. Dumitru, A.M. Ciongariu, M. Sajin, M. Costache
*University Emergency Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Spindle cell melanoma is a rare and insuffi-
ciently described lesion, hence easily confused with other more frequent
spindle cell neoplasms of the skin. In such cases, extensive immunohis-
tochemical analysis should be performed in order to establish the
diagnosis.
Methods: The aim of this report is to gain further insight into this rare
variant of melanoma, in order to provide a correct diagnosis and the best
strategy therapy. As standard histopathological examination cannot accu-
rately identify spindle cell melanomas, extensive immunohistochemical
analysis is crucial for the differential diagnosis.
Results: We report the case of a 75-year-old male who presented to the
hospital with a latero-cervical pigmented lesion. Standard histopatholog-
ical exam revealed a spindle cell neoplasia with a low mitotic index and a
mild lymphocytic infiltrate. Neither perineural nor lympho-vascular inva-
sion were noticed. The suspicion of a melanoma was raised due to areas
of regression and the presence of intracytoplasmatic brownish pigment.
Further immunohistochemical tests confirmed the diagnosis of a spindle
cell melanoma.
Conclusion: Albeit rare among spindle cell neoplasia of the skin, spindle
cell melanoma should be regarded as a possible diagnosis, particularly in
macroscopically pigmented lesions. As melanomas are especially aggres-
sive tumours and early diagnosis is of outmost importance in such cases.
Therefore, comprehensive immunohistochemical tests must be performed
in order to establish the correct diagnosis.

A rare case of digital papillary adenocarcinoma that challenged the
pathologist during Mohs micrographic surgery
S. Yağcı*, A. Terzi, A. Albayati
*Başkent University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology,
Ankara, Turkey
Background & objectives: Digital papillary adenocarcinoma(DPA) is a
rare and histomorphological challenging malignant eccrine tumour with a
high tendency to local recurrence and metastasis, often presents as a
painless mass on the digits or toes. We've reached reported 219 cases in
the literature.
Methods: We aimed to discuss the histopathological and intraoperative
diagnostic pitfalls of DPA with a literature review. A 62-year-old female
presented with a painless swelling in the thumb. A subcutaneous nodular
1.5cm-mass was found. No ulceration, colour change or loss of function
was observed. A cystic lesion, thought to be compatible with infectious
processes, was detected in MRI and excised.
Results: Macroscopically, a partially well-circumscribed mass containing
cystic and solid components was observed. Microscopically, epithelial
neoplasm consisting of tubular structures with back-to-back arrangements
was noticed. The lining epithelium of cystic component was composed of
a single row of flattened mild atypical cells; sometimes it contained
double-layered cuboidal/columnar cells with mild atypia, with
micropapillary extensions to the lumen. Immunohistochemistry revealed,
double-layered neoplastic epithelium contains two different types of cells;
basaloid/myoepithelial and luminal. Ki-67 index was 15%. Tumour was
infiltrating surrounding adipose tissue and present at the deep surgical
margin. The findings were consistent with DPA and, re-excision was
recommended. Axillary sentinal-lymph-node(SLN) dissection and re-
excision with Mohs-micrographic-surgery(MMS) were performed.
SLN metastasis wasn't detected.
Conclusion: In our experiment, 2 additional MMS steps were required
due to suspicious positivity, unlike previously reported 5 DPA cases who
underwent MMS. Although the diagnosis is known preoperatively, be-
cause of the innocent histomorphology of DPA, suspicious positivity was
reported in frozen sections and the operation was advanced despite the
risk of loss of function. Whereas, residual tumour was only in a micro-
scopic focus in the permanent sections. Our case was considered worthy
of presentation regarding drawing attention to this pitfall.

IgG4-related disease of the colon: a case report
V. Aimola*, G.L. Canu, D. Fanni, C. Gerosa, L. Saba, R. Cau, P.G. Calò,
G. Faa, R. Fiocca
*Division of Pathology, Department of Medical Sciences and Public
Health, AOU of Cagliari, University of Cagliari, Italy
Background & objectives: IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a chronic
fibro-inflammatory syndrome related to immunomodulation. Histological
examination is required to diagnosis. The diagnostic criteria are: storiform
fibrosis, dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, obliterative phlebitis, high
number of IgG4+ plasma cells/HPF and IgG4+/IgG+ plasma cell ratio
>40%.
Methods: An 83-year-old man presented with intestinal obstruction. CT
scan showed a tumour-like mass in the transverse colon. The same neo
formed tissue was observed even inside a right inguinal hernia. Due to the
suspicion of peritoneal carcinosis and severe symptoms, exploratory
Virchows Arch
laparotomy was performed. A solid mass with a hard consistency of
7x4x3 cm was detected. IgG4 serum level was normal.
Results: Histological examination of both lesions, colonic and inguinal,
showed the same features. At histology, a subserosal nodular dense
lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate was found. Focal abscesses were detected.
Focally, storiform fibrosis was observed. Fibrous septa were found in the
adipose tissue, giving rise to nodules of different sizes. Scattered arterial
and venous vessels were interested by a strong inflammatory infiltration.
At immunohistochemistry, 80% of the CD38+ plasma cell component
was formed by IgG4+ elements. Dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate,
storiform fibrosis and high number of IgG4 positive plasma cells (210
per HPF) led to IgG4-related disease diagnosis. At 7 months of follow-up,
the patient is free of disease.
Conclusion: IgG4-RD may affect multiple organs. Less than 10 cases of
gastrointestinal involvement have been reported to date. The colonic
IgG4-RD is extremely rare. Usually, surgery is not necessary. In our case,
the surgical approach was mandatory due to intestinal occlusion and
allowed us to better study this lesion.
This event may induce to considerate IgG4-RD in the differential diag-
nosis of mass-forming lesions. Our aim is to turn a “rare disease” into a
“less rarely diagnosed disease”.

Gastric squamous cell carcinoma showing diffuse EBER positivity: a
case report
J. Tremoceiro, C. Albuquerque*, A. Galzerano, D. Pinto
*Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Ocidental, Portugal
Background & objectives: Gastric squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a
rare neoplasm with less than 100 cases reported, usually diagnosed at
advanced stage and associated with poor prognosis. Aetiology is largely
unknown. We present a case of SCC associated with EBV.
Methods: Case report of a 69-year-old female presenting with nau-
sea and vomit. Upper endoscopy showed a vegetating, ulcerative
lesion of the gastric body, which was biopsied. The patient has no
relevant past history, namely no known immunodeficiencies or
immunosuppression.
Results: Histological examination showed a solid neoplasm, formed by
large, eosinophilic cells in aggregates, showing moderate nuclear pleo-
morphism as well as foci of acantholysis and dyskeratosis.
Immunohistochemically, there was positivity for CK7, EMA and P40
and negativity for CD56, CK20 and CDX2. There was no loss of mis-
match repair proteins. EBER in situ hybridization was performed, show-
ing diffuse positivity. A tentative diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC) of the stomach, with EBER positivity, was made. The patient
(stage cT4N+) was submitted to preoperative chemotherapy and surgical
resection. The tumour was predominantly localized next to the cardia
without connection to the gastroesophageal junction. No evidence of
glandular differentiation or regression were present.
Conclusion: Neoplastic cells retained diffuse positivity for P40 and
EBER ISH, confirming the original diagnosis. The patient did postoper-
ative chemotherapy, remaining disease free 12 months after treatment.
Our case shows that EBER positivity is possible, albeit uncommon in
SCC of the stomach. Cases of stomach SCC associated with EBV infec-
tion are rare and very few are described in the literature. Further studies
are needed to determine the prevalence of EBER positivity in SCC and
what role EBV plays in their carcinogenesis.

Dodging bullets in a cachectic patient: fat atrophy versus metastatic
signet ring cell carcinoma
R. Amorim*, C. Estima Fleming, L. Brochado Ferreira, M. Oliveira, C.
Peixoto, J.R. Vizcaíno
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário do Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Starvation fat can appear incidentally in sur-
gical pathology and the dystrophic cells may have a signet ring-like mor-
phology that raises the possibility of metastatic signet ring cell carcinoma.
Methods: A 35-year-old female with compulsion neurosis and cachexia
(anorexia nervosa) was admitted due to abdominal pain. On examination,
she was cachectic (39 kg with a body mass index of 13,6 kg/m2). A CT scan
showed extensive peritoneal free air and pneumatosis of the cecum raising
the hypothesis of perforation. A right hemicolectomy was performed.
Results: On macroscopic examination, a thickened intestinal wall and
crepitus were present. The mesentery was described as “bubbly” and
the fat was thin. The mucosal surface was oedematous, and it had con-
gestion foci. No perforation was detected.
Histologic examination demonstrated signet ring-like cell aggregates
throughout subserosa and mesocolon. These cells were surrounded by a
myxoid fibrovascular stroma. This appearance raised suspicion for met-
astatic signet ring cell carcinoma, myxoid liposarcoma or
mucophagocytizing histiocytes in a mucinous neoplasm.
Immunohistochemical staining of the signet ring-like cells demonstrated
these cells to be negative for CAM 5.2 and CD68, and positive for
Vimentin and S-100. This profile was most consistent with atrophic ad-
ipocytes rather than carcinoma.
Conclusion: The changes of cachexia in fat cells are rarely seen in routine
surgical pathology. If a thorough history is not provided or sought, these
features can be alarming, including involvement of subserosal region,
intimate association with nerves and lymphoid tissue. The distinction is
critical for exclusion of malignant conditions.
The clinicopathologic features and immunohistochemical staining were
essential to reach the correct interpretation.

Immunohistochemical evaluation of possible therapeutic targets in
colorectal carcinoma (CRC) with microsatellite instability (MSI)
R. Ardeleanu*, G. Micu, L. Nichita, D. Raduta, M. Filip, M. Maria-
Alexandra, M. Rimbaș, C. Popp
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: CRC with microsatellite instability is a dis-
tinct entity with different prognosis, therapeutic response (lack of re-
sponse for some chemotherapy regimens) and clinical features. This study
aims to assess immunohistochemical expression of other markers poten-
tially useful for targeted therapy.
Methods: We included in this study 10 cases of CRC with MSI, subse-
quently performing immunostaining for BRAF, CDX2, CD117, Ki-67
and HER2. Except for the HER2 marker which was scored based on
membrane positivity as 1+, 2+ or 3+, the results were evaluated based
on the percentage of positive tumour cells.
Results: 60% of the tumours were moderately differentiated (G2) and
40% poorly differentiated (G3). BRAF was positive in one case (15%),
CD117 in 30% of the cases (ranging from 10% to 40% positive in tumour
cells), CDX2 in 70% (over 50% being positive in >60% of tumour cells),
HER2 scored 3+ in only 2 cases (20%) and high Ki-67 expression
(>40%) was seen in 90% of the cases. All cases positive for CD117,
HER2 and BRAF were G2 tumours. CD117 positivity was seen in cases
with HER2 and/or BRAF positivity and loss of CDX2 expression. Also,
Ki67 index was significantly higher in CD117 negative tumours.
Conclusion: Personalized treatment approach in CRC requires evalua-
tion of the possible therapeutic targets that emerged in recent years.
Tumours with HER2, BRAF, CD117 expression are probably more ag-
gressive and should benefit of targeted molecules or clinical trials.

Dahmoul, S. Hmissa
Virchows Arch
*Department of Pathology of Sahloul University Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Serrated polyposis (SP) is a rare condition in
which serrated polyps develop throughout the colorectum. 30% of spo-
radic colorectal cancer (CRC) arises following the “serrated pathway”.
Patients with SPs are subjects to a high, yet ill-defined risk of malignant
transformation.
Methods: We report 2 cases of SP diagnosed according to the 5th edition
of the WHO classification of digestive tumours, one of which ultimately
transformed into a serrated adenocarcinoma (SA).
Results: The first case is an 85-year-old male requiring surgery for a
sigmoidal volvulus. Macroscopically, the colon was embedded with
60sessile polyps. Histologically, these were non-dysplastic lesions:
goblet-cell-rich hyperplastic polyps (GCRHP) and sessile- serrated-
lesions(SSL). The SP was a type2 phenotype. The 2nd patient is a 58-
year-old male whose colonoscopic follow-up found an ever-growing
number of polyps. Biopsies concluded to GCRHPs. He underwent a
colectomy to remove a stenosing tumour of the sigmoid. Gross ex-
amination found a 4cm tumour and 21polyps between it and the distal
resection edge. Histologically, the polyps were either GCRHP or
SSL. The tumour showed a serrated glandular architecture and was
diagnosed as a SA. The SP is a type 3 phenotype.
Conclusion: The various denominations given to serrated lesions
made SP records harder to track. No accurate evaluation of its trans-
formation risk is documented. As for CCR arising following the
“serrated pathway” serration is almost always missing making SA a
rare entity.

The need to know more about gastric cancer: prevalence and fea-
tures in a retrospective study
S. Costache*, A.M. Ciongariu, A. Chefani, M. Costache, M. Sajin
*University Emergency Hospital, Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most
frequent neoplasm worldwide. Based on GLOBOCAN 2020, GC is
the 5th most common malignancy and the 4th cause of death. We
determined the features of GC among the patients who undergo
gastrectomy.
Methods: We assessed a retrospective cohort representing all stomach can-
cer diagnoses on gastrectomies from a single institution (University
Emergency Hospital of Bucharest, Romania), from January 2013 until
February 2020. For each case we gathered demographic data, such as age
and gender, histological type of the tumour, grade of differentiation, loca-
tion, grade of invasion, lymphovascular and perineural invasion and also
nodal status.
Results: From a total of 130 patients with GC, 34.61% were females
with age between 47 and 85 years old and 65.38% were males with
age between 34 and 84 years old. The mean age for women was
67.7 years old and for men was 65.7 years old. Considering Lauren
classification, 60% were intestinal type and 40% were diffuse type
adenocarcinomas. Regarding the WHO latest classification, 54.61%
were adenocarcinoma NOS, 6.15% mucinous adenocarcinoma,
29.23% poorly cohesive carcinomas (including signet ring cell)
and 10% were mixed carcinomas. Poorly differentiated tumours
were the most frequently (54.61%) and most of the carcinomas were
invading the subserosal space (57.69%).
Conclusion: Gastric cancer is more common in men and tends to
develop at a younger age than women. The results of this study
indicate an increasing incidence for the poorly cohesive carcinoma
(diffuse type) which has more aggressive behaviour than adenocarci-
noma NOS (intestinal type). Also, at the time of gastrectomy (partial
or total), only 1.53% were pT1 and 11.53% were pT2. Therefore,
there should be a need to provide even more comprehensive screen-
ing controls among the population.

Unpleasant surprise of diagnosis - gastric adenocarcinoma with yolk
sac tumour
L. Cristina*, L. Nichita, O. Stefan, M. Filip, C. Popp
*Colentina University Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Yolk sac tumours (YST) are rare malignant
GCT that usually originate in the gonads. They rarely arise in extra-
gonadal sites (mediastinum, retroperitoneum, lung). Yolk sac differenti-
ation of gastric adenocarcinomas is rare with only a few cases reported in
the literature.
Methods: We report a case of primary gastric adenocarcinoma with YST
differentiation and liver metastases of the YST component in a 49 y/o
female presented with unspecific symptoms. Abdominal tomography
showed wall thickening of the gastric lesser curvature and perigastric/
retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement. Total gastrectomy with lymph
node dissection and oesophagojejunostomy and an incisional biopsy of a
liver tumour were performed.
Results: Grossly, we found an elevated tumour of 10/7/6cm, with ulcer-
ation and haemorrhage, located in the antral lesser curvature of the stom-
ach. Histopathological examination of resected specimens revealed the
presence of a G2 intestinal type adenocarcinoma, with features of YST. In
the yolk sac component, tumour cells showed immunoreactivity for CK8/
18, AFP and PLAP and focal staining for β-HCG. Lymph node (1/18)
and liver metastasis had morphological and immunohistochemical fea-
tures similar with the YST component of the gastric tumour.
Conclusion: Yolk sac differentiation in gastric adenocarcinoma repre-
sents a major diagnostic challenge with significant impact on patients’
prognosis, since the YST component is more aggressive and has a higher
risk of metastasis. Reporting rare tumours is a helpful tool for patholo-
gists, since the key of diagnosis, in this case, is the recognition of YST
morphology.

Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour – a rare mesenchymal entity
in the colon
R. Moiteiro da Cruz*, J. Boavida, A. Pignatelli
*Department of Pathology, Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN; Faculdade
de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal
Background & objectives: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour is an
unusual mesenchymal neoplasm, occurring usually in children and young
adults, rarely arising in extrapulmonary locations. Herein, we present a
case of an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour diagnosed in the colon.
Methods: A 39-year-old man, smoker with clinical background of essen-
tial hypertension, dyslipidaemia and biliary lithiasis, presented to the
emergency department after repeated episodes of melena since
December 2020. Colonoscopy and abdominal computed tomography re-
vealed the existence of a circumferential vegetant tumour in the proximal
transversal colon near to the hepatic angle; biopsies were inconclusive,
and a right hemicolectomy was performed.
Results: Macroscopically, there was a 4cm firm whitish tumour within
the colon wall, with a fascicular and nodular cut surface, ulcerating the
mucosa. Histologically, the tumour was composed of loose fascicles of
uniform, plump spindle cells with pale cytoplasm, vesicular chromatin
and small nucleoli, within a collagenous stroma and a prominent inflam-
matory infiltrate constituted mainly by lymphocytes, plasma cells and a
few eosinophils; pleomorphism, mitoses and necrosis were absent. The
neoplastic cells showed diffuse staining for vimentin and ALK (cytoplas-
mic pattern), focal staining for smooth muscle actin and HHF35 and were
negative for CD117, DOG-1, desmin, STAT-6, cytokeratins and EMA.
These features were consistent with the diagnosis of inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumour.
Conclusion: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour is a neoplasm of in-
termediate biological potential with only 60 cases described in the
Virchows Arch
colorectal region. Grossly, its fascicular aspect usually resembles the
gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), the most common mesenchymal
tumour of the digestive system. Even histologically, the differential diag-
nosis with GIST and other described mesenchymal tumours of the gas-
trointestinal tract is fundamental and immunochemistry evaluation is
needed to establish the final diagnosis.

Case report of gastrointestinal stromal tumour with signet-ring cells
A. Dimitriadi*, D. Grigoropoulou, S. Pappa, F. Antoniadou, N.
Kourkounakis, C. Zorzos
*"G.Gennimatas" General Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: We report a case of gastrointestinal stromal
tumour (GIST) of the stomach, with abundance of signet-ring cells.
Methods: A 73-year-old male arrived at our hospital with nonspecific
gastric symptoms. During gastroscopy, a submucosal mass was found.
Partial gastrectomy was performed. We received an oval shaped segment
of the stomach, with a circumscribed, brown submucosal mass of maxi-
mum diameter >4.7cm.
Results: Microscopically, it was a sharply demarcate mass consisting of
epithelioid cells with clear cytoplasm and signet-ring cell morphology at
the majority of the tumour cells. Focally, at the periphery of the tumour,
there were also spindled cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mild cytolog-
ic atypia and rare mitoses (<1 mitosis per 5mm2) were observed. Necrosis
was not found. Immunohistochemistry showed diffuse and strong posi-
tivity for Cim, CD117, Dog1, CD34 whereas immunostaining for
CKAE1/AE3, S100, SOX10, Mart1, HMB45, SMA, Desmin was nega-
tive. Similarly, the histochemical stains AB/PAS and PAS/PAS-D were
negative. Ki67 (MIB1) was 3-4%. Thus, the diagnosis of GIST was
made, category 2 according to WHO classification.
Conclusion: GISTs are a relatively common tumour, with approximately
54% of the cases arising in the stomach. Epithelioid morphology is less
common in stomach. Rarely, a signet-ring cell pattern can be observed.
The differential diagnosis includes gastric adenocarcinoma with signet-
ring cells, melanoma, metastatic adenocarcinoma, gastric schwannoma
with signet ring cells and any other tumour with clear cell features or
mucin production.

Case report: primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) aris-
ing in colonic adenoma
A. Dimitriadi*, N. Poulianitis, D. Grigoropoulou, G. Theodoropoulou, G.
Leveta, G. Kakiopoulos
*"G.Gennimatas" General Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: We report a case of primary diffuse large B-
cell lymphoma, arising in the stem of a villous adenoma of the sigmoid
colon, with no clinical indications.
Methods: A 71-year-old male was routinely evaluated endoscopically.
During colonoscopy, several polyps of diameter 0.4-0.5cm were found
and excised. One polyp located at sigmoid colon was pedunculated with
diameter >4cm.
Results: Histologically, it was a villous adenoma with high grade dys-
plasia. The stem and the mucosal interstitium were infiltrated by diffusely
arranged polymorphous large neoplastic cells, with absence of starry sky
pattern. Immunohistochemical study revealed positivity for LCA, CD20,
Bcl-6 and CD10 whereas it was negative against CKAE1/AE3, CgA,
SYP, S100, CD3, CD30, bcl-2, CyclinD1, HHV8. C-myc was positive
in 30% of the neoplastic nuclei. Ki67 (MIB1) was estimated positive in
about 90% of the cells. EBER was positive in sparse nuclei. Thus, the
diagnosis of composite DLBCL and villous adenoma was made. The
smaller polyps were either hyperplastic or adenomas.
Conclusion: DLBCL is quite common in the gastrointestinal tract.
Nevertheless,lymphomascoexistingwithadenomasareextremelyrare
with only 4 reported cases in PubMed, consisting of an Epstein-Barr
Virus-Associated B-cell lymphoproliferative Disorder, two DLBCLs
and a marginal zone lymphoma. Although it is far more common for an
adenoma to coexist with carcinoid, it is important to always keep in
mind a lymphoma in the differential diagnosis of small blue round cell
tumours.

Gastric mesenchymal tumours resembling other entities: report of
two cases
A. Dinculescu*, M. Frumosu, M. Filip, E. Ignat, C. Popp, W. Elaiah, S.A.
Zurac
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Schwannomas are nerve sheath tumours that
usually affect the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the extremities, follow-
ed by the head and neck region. However, they can sometimes be found
in uncommon locations, such as the gastrointestinal system.
Methods: From a total of 65 cases of peripheral schwannomas retrieved
from our hospital records between 2005 and 2020, 3 (4,61%) were locat-
ed in the stomach. In this retrospective study, we present two cases of
gastric tumours that were clinically misdiagnosed as metastasis from
colon adenocarcinoma in the first case and malignant tumour of the gas-
tric cardia in the second one.
Results: CASE 1: A 72-year-old male underwent surgery after CT re-
vealed a mass in the transverse colon and additional tumours initially
diagnosed as metastases were found, including one on the anterior gastric
serosa. CASE 2: A 57-year-old male underwent total gastrectomy after CT
confirmed an interhepatogastric neoplasm. In both cases, microscopic ex-
amination revealed a nodular proliferation of spindle cells, with abundant,
eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei, mostly organized in dense,
cellular areas. Nuclear palisading was also present, with few mitoses and
no nuclear pleomorphism, highly suggestive of schwannoma. In the first
case the tumour cells were S100-, c-KIT+, CD34+ (GIST–prognostic
group 1). In the second case, they were only S100+(gastric schwannoma).
Conclusion: Histopathologically, both cases were diagnosed as
schwannomas. However, after immunohistochemical testing, the first
case turned out to be a GIST. In conclusion, mesenchymal tumours with
morphological appearance of neural differentiation may belong either to
the nerve sheath tumours group or to the gastrointestinal stromal tumours
one. Immunophenotyping is mandatory in order to establish a proper
diagnosis, no matter how bland looking the tumour cells are or how
suggestive of a certain tumour type the morphology is.

Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile duct: case report
of a rare entity in biliary tree
B.G. Özamrak, S. Ekmekci*, S. Aydoğan
*University of Health Sciences Turkey, Tepecik Research and Training
Hospital, Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Neuroendocrine tumours and neuroendo-
crine carcinomas (NET) can arise in various systems throughout the body.
But biliary tree is a very uncommon localization for such tumours. We
herein report a case of NEC in the extrahepatic bile duct (EHBD).
Methods: 67-year-old male patient with diabetes and a pace maker
was admitted to our hospital with jaundice. The patient had a history of
cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis. Endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography revealed near-total luminal obstruction at bile
duct until junction of cystic duct. Segment proximal to the area appeared
dilated. With clinical preliminary diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, pa-
tient underwent EHBD resection.
Results: Gross examination revealed wall thickening of 2,8 cm segment of
bile duct. Upon histopathological examination of specimen, infiltrative
solid sheets of tumour cells with scant cytoplasm and high nuclei-
Virchows Arch
cytoplasmic ratio was seen in the bile duct wall. Tumour cells had irregu-
larly shaped, hyperchromatic granular nuclei. Chromogranin A,
synaptophysin, CD56, TTF-1 and pancytokeratin immunohistochemical
stains were positive. Ki-67 index was >%80. With these findings, diagnosis
of NEC was established. Surface epithelium of bile duct showed focal areas
of low-grade dysplasia in the proximal parts of the specimen. But no iden-
tifiable adenocarcinoma component was present. The patient also had local
lymph node metastases. PET scan of patient revealed no other primaries.
Conclusion: Preoperative diagnosis of NEC in the biliary tree can be
quite challenging. Due to the localization, it can be hard to acquire biop-
sies to make a definitive diagnosis. NECs are aggressive tumours with a
tendency for distant metastasis, thus leading to a very poor prognosis.

Uncommon case of giant gastric lipomatous polyp: what prognosis?
what therapeutic?
S. Elaouni*, S. Jebli, K. Znati
*Ibn Sina University Hospital, Pathology, Rabat, Morocco
Background & objectives: Gastric lipoma account for <1% of all gastric
tumours encountered. Giant gastric lipoma, defined as ≥10 cm. We here-
by present a case of a giant gastric lipomatous endoluminal polyp
resulting in excision preserving gastric continuity.
Methods: Our patient is 49-year-old presented as a symptomatology
epigastric pain, dyspepsia, and bloody vomiting. A fibroscopy gastrodu-
odenal and CT scan revealed a gastric mass antral site with endoluminal
growth, measuring 12× 7,5 × 7.3 cm. He underwent an exploratory lapa-
rotomy with transverse anterior gastrotomy and primary closure.
Results: Pathologic examination objective a mass of 12 cm of major axis
submucosal, well-circumscribed, non-encapsulated comprised of mature
adipose tissue without atypia or mitotic figures, consistent with lipoma.
The over-stretched gastric mucosa is moderately inflammatory,
helicobacter pylori are absent without dysplasia without metaplasia.
Conclusion: Obstruction gastrointestinal and bleeding secondary to a
giant gastric lipoma is a rare finding of a rare disease. The majority of
cases in the literature result in major gastric resection, if malignancy is
carefully ruled out. stomach preserving surgery is an optimal treatment
option. As it was in our case was managed by simple enucleation follow-
ing a preoperative certainty diagnosis.

Leiomyosarcoma of duodenal wall
H. Eren*, Z.B. Erdem, E.E. Yılmaz, N. Dursun
*Basaksehir Cam and Sakura, Turkey
Background & objectives: Leiomyosarcoma is one of the most common
type of sarcoma seen in adults. Primary gastrointestinal(GI) sarcomas in
general are very rare, accounting for 1-2% of all GI malignancies but in
this group leiomyosarcoma is one of the most common.
Methods: Forty-nine years old female patient presented with abdominal
pain and discomfort. On physical examination no specific finding was
observed. Imaging studies revealed a 9 cm mass on duodenal wall by the
ampulla. Ampullary carcinoma being the preliminary diagnosis, surgery
decision was given.
Results: The tumour was sent in pieces to the pathology laboratory. On
gross examination of pancreaticoduodenectomy material, tumour was
situated on the opposite site of ampulla with above mucosa being mostly
intact. Cut surface was tan to grey, solid and rubbery. Morphologically
tumour consisted of spindle to highly pleomorphic cells with eosinophilic
cytoplasm on a myxoid background. Immunhistochemical studies
showed SMA, Desmin and H-caldesmon positivity. Myogenin and
MyoD1 were negative, Ki67 index was 65-70%. Proving true smooth
muscle differentiation, case was reported as Leiomyosarcoma.
Conclusion: Primary GI leiomyosarcomas are very rare. Most important
entity on differential diagnosis is Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour
(GIST). In addition to this pathologist must always keep in mind
leiomyosarcoma on the differential diagnosis of GIST’s. In this case
weak-nonspecific CD117 and DOG1 staining were observed and molec-
ular analysis was done for definitive diagnosis.

CD3 and CD7 lymphocytes in the microenvironment of colorectal
cancer and their influence on the progression of tumour growth
A. Filin*, V. Danilenko, E. Chupandina, S. Kornilova
*Voronezh State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: Currently, the incidence of colorectal cancer
is growing steadily. By assessing the immune response to tumour growth,
it is possible to predict the outcome of the disease and choose the most
effective therapy.
Methods: Analysis of the data of patients who underwent primary tumour
resection: life expectancy, gender, age, stage of the disease, presence of
metastases in regional lymph nodes, degree of tumour differentiation, quan-
titative assessment of the prevalence of CD3, CD7 lymphocytes.
Results: The presence of lymphocytes was revealed in all cases. Their
greatest density is observed in the invasive margin of the tumour. In the
group of patients with early death, the density of CD3 lymphocytes in the
tumour stroma is increased compared to long-lived ones, and the number
of CD7 lymphocytes is reduced in the invasive margin. Metastases in
regional lymph nodes leads to decrease of CD3 lymphocytes in invasive
margin in long-lived persons, and in patients with early death it increases
both in the stroma and in the invasive margin; the number of CD7 lym-
phocytes in the invasive margin decreases in long-living patients and
increases in patients with early death.
Conclusion: Subpopulations of CD3 and CD7 lymphocytes are one of
the main representatives of the tumour microenvironment in colorectal
cancer, and the patterns of their distribution, as well as the volumes of
representation in the tumour stroma and in the invasive margin, can be
criteria for predicting the course of the disease for a particular patient.

To be or not to be: Crohn’s disease or sarcoidosis with only
gastro-duodenal and pancreatic involvement
M. Florea*, F. Neacsu, M.E. Dumbrava, R. Iacob, M. Mandea, G.
Becheanu
*Emergency University Hospital, Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Sarcoidosis and Crohn’s disease are
multisystemic non-caseating granulomatous inflammatory diseases, with
rare involvement of the GI tract in the case of sarcoidosis. Crohn’s disease
can affect any part of the digestive tract, but pancreatic involvement is rare.
Methods: A 31-year-old male was admitted for dyspepsia, anorexia and
weight loss. Upper digestive endoscopy revealed diffuse infiltration of the
gastric wall (linitis plastica-like appearance) and multiple ulcerations in
the duodenum. MRI scan was suggestive of acute pancreatitis.
Results: The gastro-duodenal biopsies showed epithelioid, non-caseating
granulomas in the background of chronic active inflammation. ACE, sIL2r
and ASCA IgA levels were elevated, and IgG class 4 level was normal.
Under high-dose of corticosteroids, symptoms have disappeared. A differ-
ential diagnosis between sarcoidosis involving the digestive tract and
Crohn’s disease with autoimmune pancreatitis was made, in favour of the
former, due to the abnormal levels of biomarkers and clinical presentation.
Other conditions were excluded: malignancy, infections, foreign body re-
action, CVID, vasculitis, Whipple disease. On follow-up, we found normal
values of ACE and sIL2r, complete remission of the pancreatic lesions and
persistence of granulomas in an otherwise non-atrophic gastric mucosa.
Virchows Arch
Conclusion: Symptomatic involvement of the GI tract can be the first
manifestation of sarcoidosis. Even if rare, finding non-caseating granulo-
mas in the GI tract may guide the diagnosis toward sarcoidosis, but other
granulomatous disorders must be excluded. Because histologically sar-
coidosis and Crohn’s disease are difficult to differentiate, serology can be
helpful. Gastric sarcoidosis can grossly mimic malignancy. The acute
management of both sarcoidosis and Crohn’s disease involves
corticotherapy, but differentiation between them is important for long-
term case management and prognosis.

Appendiceal goblet cell adenocarcinoma: a series of cases
C. Fumagalli*, A. Hernández Gallego, V. Fusté, J. Szafranska
*Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Spain
Background & objectives: Goblet cell adenocarcinoma (GCA) is a rare
tumour almost exclusively seen in the appendix, composed of goblet-like
mucinous cells, neuroendocrine cells and Paneth-like cells that infiltrate the
appendiceal wall circumferentially, without desmoplastic stromal reaction.
Methods: We undertook a retrospective review of a series of GCA diag-
nosed and treated between 2018 and 2020 in two centres, analysing his-
tological characteristics, immunohistochemical and molecular features,
along with a clinical follow up. The diagnosis was reviewed considering
the new WHO classification. The study included 5 cases (2men and 3
women) with a median age of 62 years.
Results: A classical morphology of GCA was present in all cases. The
histological grade was G1 in 2pts, G2 in 1 and G3 in 2. Perineural and
vascular invasions were identified in 4 and 1cases. TNM score was
pT3N0 in 4cases and pT4N0 in 1. Chromogranin and synaptophysin
highlighted variable numbers of neuroendocrine cells in all cases. p53
staining was wild-type in all but 1case with a total loss of expression.
DNA-mismatch-repair genes and BRAF were preserved in all tumours
analysed. Four pts are alive free from disease (median follow up: 21
months). One patient corresponding to a G3-case with p53 loss, is cur-
rently alive but with disease and undergoing chemotherapy.
Conclusion: Herein, we describe the histological, immunohistochemical
and molecular characteristics and clinical evolution of a series of CGA.
We found a p53 aberrant expression in the case with poorer outcome,
suggesting a possible mechanism involving TP53 gene in the histogenesis
of this tumour and a possible association with aggressiveness. However,
it is well known that alteration in p53 is not always associated with TP53
gene mutation, and more studies are needed to find the genetic profiling
of GCA.

Medullary adenocarcinoma of colon. A case report
G. Galanopoulos*, E. Arkoumani, E. Souka, G. Koutsodontis, C.
Valavanis, K. Manoloudaki
*Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: Adenocarcinoma of the colon is the third
most-common type of cancer worldwide, with a 4% incidence in both
men and women. We present a rare case of a recently recognized subtype
of colorectal cancer, the medullary adenocarcinoma of colon (MAC).
Methods: A 63-year-old female patient was admitted with weakness,
weight loss and left lower quadrant abdominal pain for a period of months.
Colonoscopy revealed an ulcerated 5cm-long circumferential lesion located
in the ascending colon and a right hemi-colectomy was performed.
Results: Histopathological examination showed a malignant neoplasm
with solid and insular growth pattern. The tumour consisted of
medium-sized polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nu-
clei and prominent nucleoli. A prominent lymphocytic infiltration within
and around tumour was also evident. Immunohistochemical staining was
positive for CK20 and CEA and negative for CDX2, CK7, Ca19-9,
Ca125, synaptophysin and chromogranin. Further molecular analysis
revealed a microsatellite stable tumour (MSS-pMMR) with a BRAF-
V600E/E2/D mutation. KRAS and NRAS mutations were absent.
These findings established the diagnosis of MAC.
Conclusion: MAC is a very rare colorectal cancer subtype, accounting
for <1% of cases and mostly affects women (mean age 70 years). It is
often associated with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma
(HNPCC) syndrome. Most MACs present microsatellite instability,
though MSS tumours can also occur. In comparison to undifferentiated
and poorly-differentiated adenocarcinomas of the colon, MACs are be-
lieved to have a relatively favourable prognosis.

*Department of Pathology, Mateu Orfila Hospital, IB-Salut, Maó
(Menorca), Spain
Background & objectives: Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the most
common type of gastrointestinal cancer, with approximately 1,931,950
worldwide new cases in 2020. Carcinomas exhibiting more than two lines
of differentiation are unusual, and only sporadic reports of this phenom-
enon have been described.
Methods: An 81-year-old man with history of abdominal pain and pos-
itive result of faecal occult blood test. Abdominal examination showed a
right-upper-quadrant palpable mass. Computed Tomography revealed a
colonic exophytic mass measuring 27x46 mm and pathological regional
lymph nodes without evidence of metastatic disease. The colonoscopy
demonstrated a stenosing and ulcerated lesion in the hepatic angle. Right
hemicolectomy was performed.
Results: The specimen measuring 40x6 cm with an invasive tumour of
7x4cm with extension into pericolorectal tissue and visceral peritoneum.
Histological examination showed a carcinoma with conventional glandu-
lar differentiation, undifferentiated areas with rhabdoid features and pools
of extracellular mucin and signet-ring cells. By immunohistochemistry,
the conventional carcinoma showed expression of CKAE1/AE3, CK8,
CK20, CDX2, SATB2, chromogranin and synaptophysin. The undiffer-
entiated area expressed CKAE1/AE3, CK8, SATB2, chromogranin,
synaptophysin, vimentin, with variable expression of βHCG. Nuclear
SMARCB1 (INI1) expression was retained in the different tumour com-
ponents. P53 showed a null-pattern. Analysis for mismatch-repair-
proteins showed nuclear expression in both non-neoplastic and tumour
cells. Molecular analysis revealed a BRAF(V600E/E2/D) mutation with-
out alteration in KRAS/NRAS genes.
Conclusion: Although most cases of CRC are adenocarcinoma NOS,
several histopathological subtypes have been described. Tumours with
rhabdoid features are extremely rare, have poor prognosis and represents
a pathway of dedifferentiation shared by heterogenous neoplasms and
might or might not be associated with SMARCB1 (INI1) alterations.
Some authors suggest that βHCG expression is associated with aggres-
sive behaviour in non-trophoblastic tumours. Our case suggests that an
integrated analysis of morphological, immunohistochemical and molec-
ular traits help to recognize these uncommon tumours.

*2nd Department of Pathology, National and Kapodistrian University of
Athens School of Medicine, “Attikon” University Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) is
the most common mesenchymal tumour of the digestive tract. We here-
with present a case of a gastric GIST with pulmonary metastasis showing
chondrosarcomatous differentiation after therapy with imatinib mesylate
(IM).
Methods: A 67-year-old patient with a previous history of gastric GIST
15 years ago and a local recurrence four years later, was admitted due to a
small tumour found in the lower lobe of the left lung on chest computed
tomography. Wedge resection was performed.
Grossly, a well-circumscribed, solid, elastic, grey-white, 1.3cm. large
tumour was found in the lung parenchyma.
Results: Microscopically, the neoplasm consisted of an epithelioid com-
ponent with a solid architecture, high-grade atypia, and numerous mitotic
figures, with an abrupt transition to a mesenchymal component showing
chondrosarcomatous differentiation. The epithelioid component
expressed CD117 and DOG1, whereas Vimentin was positive in both.
CKAE-1/AE-3, CK5/6, p63, TTF1, Napsin A, and CD99 were uniformly
negative. Our diagnosis was malignant neoplasm consistent with GIST
metastasis with heterologous chondrosarcomatous differentiation. A re-
view of the literature revealed 25 cases with unusual morphological and
immunohistochemical findings in GIST, either de novo or after therapy
with IM showing heterogeneous differentiation (epithelioid sarcoma,
rhabdomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma, etc.) and loss of CD117, CD34, and
DOG1 expression in the dedifferentiated component.
Conclusion: GIST showing disease progression or resistance to imatinib
mesylate (IM) may present with unusual morphologic and immunohisto-
chemical characteristics. Knowledge of these changes is essential to avoid
a severe diagnostic pitfall.

Gastric adenocarcinoma with lymphoid stroma: a rare case report
G. Grigore*, L. Ursache, B.C. Tănase, A. Neicu, R.M. Pridie
*Colentina Clinical University Hospital, Department of Pathology,
Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Gastric adenocarcinoma with lymphoid stro-
ma, also known as medullary carcinoma or lymphoepithelioma-like car-
cinoma, accounts for 1-7% of all gastric carcinomas. Most of them arise
in the proximal stomach and have been associated with either latent EBV
infection or microsatellite instability.
Methods: A 68-year-old male with a medical history of class 3 cardiac
condition and diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department
with marked fatigue and dizziness. He underwent an oesophago-
gastroscopy, which demonstrated a large mass, involving the lesser cur-
vature near cardia. Biopsies were taken and the initial diagnosis was high-
grade intraepithelial neoplasia, without the certainty of an invasive
tumour.
Results: The patient was then referred to our institution for additional
work-up and underwent a total gastrectomy. The microscopic examina-
tion of the gastric resection specimen showed moderately differentiated
carcinoma on the surface with obvious dedifferentiation towards deeper
levels. The lesion had an organoid growth pattern diffusely consisting of
irregular sheets, trabeculae, syncytia, and ill-defined tubules of polygonal
pleomorphic tumour cells with vesicular nuclei. There was an abundant
peritumoral and intratumoral lymphocytic response. The proximal and
distal margins were negative, but the lesser omental margin was involved
by invasive carcinoma. One of the 14 extracted regional lymph nodes
presented carcinomatous metastasis. Immunohistochemical stains and in
situ hybridization for EBV are pending.
Conclusion: Our case was diagnosed as gastric adenocarcinoma with
lymphoid stroma, which by some has been reported to have a favourable
prognosis compared with usual gastric adenocarcinoma. Specifically,
EBV-positive, as well as MSI-high tumours in general, have been vari-
ably associated with a survival advantage. On the other hand, lesions
composed of lymphocytic infiltration may be mistaken for an intense
reactive lymphoid infiltrate or even lymphoma and one has to pay atten-
tion to these differential diagnoses.

Current dysplasia grading guidelines in colorectal adenomas do not
seem to be valid among pathologists in Turkey: a nation-wide survey
E. Gun*, B. Bolat Kucukzeybek, D. Driman, A. Akder Sari
*Izmir Katip Celebi University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Dysplasia grading is important in colorectal
adenomas(CRAs )given its effect on polypectomy surveillance. We
aimed to investigate the terminologies used for HGD in routine practice,
if any and the agreement of dysplasia grading among Turkish pathologists
with reference to current guidelines.
Methods: A survey including 7 images of CRAs with low-grade dyspla-
sia (LGD) and HGD was sent to pathologists in Turkey via e-mail and
social media. The images were selected from the Canadian National
Polyp Guidelines. The pathologists were asked to grade the dysplasia as
in their routine practice. For this purpose, the multiple choices not only
included LGD and HGD but also adenocarcinoma in-situ and
intramucosal adenocarcinoma.
Results: A total of 324 pathologists (including 48 senior residents and
176 gastrointestinal pathologists) participated in the survey. The majority
of the staff-pathologists had an experience more than 5 years. Among
staff-pathologists, the rate of agreement of dysplasia according to the
guidelines was as follows; for CRAs with LGD, Image 1(with low-
grade cytology)-97%, Image 2(with focal cribriformity)-6,2%, Image
5(with high-grade cytology)-26,8%, and for Image 6(with slightly high-
grade cytology)-48,9%. For CRAs with HGD (Images 3,4, and 7), the
agreement ratio was>91%. However, intramucosal adenocarcinoma was
the preferred terminology by 43,8%,68,5%,and 50% of the participants,
respectively and in-situ adenocarcinoma was used by 21%, 5,4% and
16,3%, respectively. The results were similar for residents.
Conclusion: Among pathologists in Turkey, in contrast to current guide-
lines for CRAs; 1. Intramucosal adenocarcinoma is still a commonly used
terminology, 2. High-grade cytological features are over-relied, 3.
Insufficient extent of architectural abnormalities is overcalled. We think
that strategies to increase the usage of current guidelines in practice
should be developed and as agreed by the majority (Question 9), a na-
tional polyp guideline seems to be necessary in an attempt to standardize
reporting of CRAs in Turkey.

Rectal neuroendocrine tumour G2 presenting as a polyp with hepatic
metastases
I. Helal*, F. Khanchel, M. Ben Thayer, A. Hmidi, E. Ben Brahim, R.
Jouini, A. Chadli-Debbiche
*Habib Thameur's Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Rectal neuroendocrine tumour (NET) repre-
sented 29% of all gastroenteropancreatic NET. The incidence of NET of
the rectum has been increasing in the last decades, partly due to improved
investigation. They are mostly well-differentiated small tumours with a
rather good prognosis.
Methods: We report a case of rectal NET with polypoid presentation
showing aggressive clinical behaviour.
Results: A 59-year-old woman with no medical history presented be-
cause of pain in the right hypochondrium and loss of weight.
Abdominal examination showed hepatomegaly and laboratory test results
showed increased liver enzymes. CT showed multiple hepatic lesions.
The result of upper endoscopy was normal, whereas colonoscopy re-
vealed an ulcerated sessile rectal polyp measuring 15 mm. Examination
Virchows Arch
of a rectal biopsy specimen showed submucosal proliferation of uniform
cells with positivity for synaptophysin and CD56 in immunostaining. The
mitotic count was low and Ki-67 proliferation index was 4%.
Percutaneous hepatic biopsy was performed, and microscopic examina-
tion showed liver metastasis. The patient received lanreotid because of
her symptomatic unresectable hepatic metastases.
Conclusion: Rectal NET are rare, but they are increasing in incidence in
the recent years. Despite a relatively indolent behaviour, they are malig-
nant and can metastasize. Most reported risk factors for metastatic disease
are tumour size >1cm, muscularis propria invasion, high proliferation
index and lymphovascular invasion.

Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma: a Tunisian experience
A. Hmidi*, I. Helal, F. Khanchel, E. Ben Brahim, M. Ben Thayer, R.
Jouini, A. Chadli-Debbiche
*Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL)
is rare with a heterogeneous presentation and a controversial treatment
plan. Our objective was to elucidate the epidemiological, clinical, and
pathological features of PGIL and to compare the intestinal and gastric
forms in our region.
Methods: We carried out a retrospective descriptive study of PGIL cases,
collected in our department of Pathology over 23 years (from 1997 to
2020). The primary nature of the lymphoma was retained in front of an
exclusive or predominant digestive site, without peripheral lymph node
involvement. The diagnosis was made on the basis of anatomo-
pathological and immunohistochemical criteria.
Results: Our study included 78 cases (52 males and 26 females) with a
mean age of 47.5 years. The tumour sites were gastric in 61 (78%), small
intestine in 12 (15.4%), and colonic in 2 cases (2.6%). A mixed gastric-
intestinal localization was noted in 3 cases (4%). The clinical presentation
was dominated by abdominal pain. A high-grade PGIL was noted in 62.5%
with a predominantly intestinal location. The B phenotype was noted in
91.8%: It was MALT lymphoma in 63%, followed by large B-cell lym-
phoma in 24.6%. The T phenotype was noted in 8.2%. It was exclusively
located in the intestine and associated with enteropathy (Coeliac disease)
in 2 cases.
Conclusion: We conclude that the stomach is the main site of PGILs in
our region; that intestinal lymphoma is less common, and mixed gastric-
intestinal localization is rare and seems to have a worse prognosis. Gastric
lymphomas are often low-grade B lymphomas, potentially curable.
However, the majority of intestinal lymphomas are high-grade T pheno-
type, occurring in younger subjects.

Toxic megacolon caused by leucocytoclastic vasculitis: a case report
A. Ieronymaki*, P. Tziakou, E. Nasiakopoulou, T. Nikoletos, V.
Berdelis, E. Papakonstantinou
*Pathology Department, Thriasio General Hospital of Elefsina, Greece
Background & objectives: Leucocytoclastic vasculitis of the colon with-
out other manifestations is extremely rare.
Methods: We report the case of a 52-year-old man, who came to the
ER department with abdominal distention and nausea. No signs of rash
were observed. Laboratory findings revealed mild anaemia (HGb 11,5g/dL).
X-rays showed extended dilation of the colon. Total colectomy was
performed.
Results: Histopathological examination revealed perivascular and intra-
vascular neutrophilic infiltration, fibrinoid necrosis, with nuclear dust, of
the wall of small vessels of the serosal and muscular layer of the large
bowel. Immunohistochemical study with calretinin revealed normal pres-
ence of the ganglion cells. Mucosa was normal and submucosa showed
oedema. Small bowel had no significant alterations.
Conclusion: Leucocytoclastic vasculitis is commonly associated with
Henoch-Schoenlein, systemic lupus erythematosus, drug reactions and
connecting tissue disorders. Gastrointestinal involvement applies to pa-
tients with polyarteritis nodosa and most commonly affects duodenum
and small bowel. In our case isolated leucocytoclastic vasculitis of the
colon, without underlying disorder, causing toxic megacolon, is
presented.

Simultaneous gastrointestinal neoplasms: Stromal tumour (GIST)
combined with carcinoma. Presentation of two cases
L. Karelis*, E. Souka, G. Sotiropoulou, M. Terzi, E. Papantoni, A.
Nikova, G. Galanopoulos, O. Tzaida
*"Metaxas" Memorial Cancer Hospital, Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: Simultaneous development of different neo-
plasms in gastrointestinal system is uncommon. In particular, concurrent
development of gastrointestinal stromal tumour and carcinoma is very
rare. We present two cases of small intestine GIST's together with gastric
and colon adenocarcinoma, respectively.
Methods: Patient A: A 64-year-old male underwent a partial gastrectomy
for a gastric tumour. During intraoperative investigation a small jejunum
mass was identified.
Patient B: A 82-year-old female underwent a partial small intestine resec-
tion for a large tumour measuring 12cm and a left colectomy for a con-
current 3cm colon mass.
Results: Histopathologic findings
Patient A: A cellular, spindle cell, bland looking jejunum neoplasm,
1,2cm with 0-1 mitoses/50HPF was revealed. The gastric tumour was
classified as a poorly cohesive adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells
and muscularis propria infiltration.
Patient B: The small intestine tumour was a spindle cell neoplasm, quite
cellular, storiform patterned with mild pleomorphism and 25-50 mitoses/
50HPF. Mucosa ulceration, necrosis and focal peritoneal infiltration were
noted.
The colon tumour was a grade II adenocarcinoma, pT2N0.
Immunohistochemically the small intestine neoplasms were positive for:
Vimentin, PDGFRA, DOG-1, c-kit and negative for: CKAE1AE3,
CD34, SMA, Desmin, HMB-45,Melan-A, S100. Ki67 was 1% and
20% respectively. The findings were compatible with GIST.
Conclusion: GIST's are mesenchymal neoplasms of variable aggressive-
ness. 20-40% of patients may develop other malignancies synchronous or
subsequent, mainly in gastrointestinal system. In that background the
majority of GIST's are asymptomatic, incidental findings discovered dur-
ing the diagnostic-therapeutic approach of the accompanying malignan-
cies. The patients prognosis is defined mainly by the accompanying, often
more aggressive neoplasm.

Development of symptomatic Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)
after kidney transplantation diagnosed through sigmoid colon biop-
sy: a case report
J. Tiems, P. Rump, S. Bakker, G. Kats-Ugurlu*
*Department of Pathology UMCG, The Netherlands
Background & objectives: FMF is an autoinflammatory disease with a
heterogenous genotype-phenotype correlation. It is characterized by re-
current attacks of fever and serositis. Amyloidosis is a frequent compli-
cation in untreated patients which can lead to proteinuria and progress to
end stage kidney disease.
Methods: A 64-year-old man of Georgian descent and kidney transplan-
tation was admitted thrice, starting six weeks post-transplantation, with
repeating fevers and abdominal pain. His laboratory work-up showed
increased serum C-reactive protein and a slight leukocytosis. The last
abdominal ultrasound showed a diffusely prominent wall of sigmoid.
Virchows Arch
Every time he had a spontaneous recovery and was discharged without a
definitive diagnosis.
Results: During his last admission, the patient emphasized
anamnestically the periodic character of his fevers. We considered colitis,
diverticulitis, abscess or lymphoma among clinical differential diagnosis.
Abdominal CT-imaging and endoscopic examination showed diverticu-
losis of sigmoid without inflammation, abscess or mass. The biopsies
showed acellular, concentric thickening of the submucosal vessel walls
without vasculitis or thrombus formation. Congo red additional immuno-
histochemical stains confirmed the AA type amyloid deposition. The
following genetic analyses showed two heterozygous variants
p.Met694Val and p.Glu148Val in the MEFV gene, confirming Familial
Mediterranean Fever. 23 months post-transplantation the patient is using
colchicine (1 mg/day), has a stable kidney function and has no recurrence
of symptoms.
Conclusion: Even if Familial Mediterranean Fever is diagnosed at a late
stage, it is important to achieve remission by colchicine treatment to
prevent loss of the transplanted kidney due to further amyloid deposition,
as well as accumulation of amyloid in other sites such as the gastrointes-
tinal tract and the heart. Colchicine suppresses the inflammatory reaction
by interfering with the adhesion and chemotaxis of leukocytes.

A rare case of polypoid gastric metastasis from clear cell renal cell
carcinoma
K. Kekempanou*, A. Filias, K. Angeliki, D. Nakas, Z. Stamou
*Agios Andreas General Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Patra, Greece
Background & objectives: Stomach is an exceedingly rare site for met-
astatic carcinoma, including those originating from the kidney. Signs and
symptoms are nonspecific and do not differentiate primary gastric carci-
noma from metastatic tumours to the stomach.
Methods: We present the case of a 79-years-old man with a history of
clear cell renal cell carcinoma treated with radical nephrectomy. Four
years later the patient underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopic eval-
uation due to iron deficiency anaemia diagnosed by blood test.
Results: Gastroscopy revealed multiple scattered polypoid lesions in gas-
tric body and fundus, ranging in size from 0,4 cm to 0,7 cm as well as a
2,7 cm polypoid mass that was removed with a polypectomy snare. The
tissue samples were sent for histological examination. Fragments of ul-
cerated neoplasm composed of solid nests of cells with abundant clear
cytoplasm and mild to moderate pleomorphic nuclei, with irregular nu-
clear membrane and occasional prominent nucleoli were microscopically
identified. Immunohistochemistry showed tumour cell reactivity for
EMA, vimentin, CD10, Cam5.2 and PAX8. CK7, CK20 and CDX2 were
negative. The histomorphological and immunophenotypic features were
consistent with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
Conclusion: Gastric metastasis from renal cell carcinoma can rarely pres-
ent as polypoid mucosal lesions and may occur several years after ne-
phrectomy. Τhe pathologist must be suspicious enough to include meta-
static clear cell carcinoma in the differential diagnosis. Given the abun-
dance of clear cell malignant tumours, obtaining a complete medical
history is a prerequisite for a correct diagnosis, just as a proper diagnosis
is a prerequisite for a correct treatment.

M. Krifa*, W. Majdoub, A. Bourigua, A. Hassine, Z. Lajmi, A.
Baccouche, H. Hamchi, T. Zahmoul, S. Hmissa
*University Hospital Of Sahloul, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Inflammatory fibroid polyp (IFP), also
known as Vanek’s tumour, is an uncommon in children that may occur
throughout the gastrointestinal tract. We report a case occurring in the
ileum and define its main clinic-pathological aspects.
Methods: We presented a rare case of a 13-year-old girl without any
medical or surgical history. She had paroxysmal pains progressing for
10 days, initially associated with early postprandial vomiting. The clinical
symptoms and CT scan images were consistent with intussusception by a
tumour mass. An ilea surgical resection was done.
Results: We received a 20 cm resection specimen of small intestine. We
noted a sessile polypoid tumour of 4.5x4 cm, covered focally by an
ulcerated mucosa. On microscopy, the tumour was sub mucosal, com-
posed of spindle and stellate stromal cells. The stroma was oedematous
containing thin-walled blood vessels and an inflammatory infiltrate main-
ly eosinophilic. On immunochemical analysis, the spindle cells were
negative for CD117, DOG-1, smooth muscle actin, desmin, S100 protein
and ALK. The CD34 stain was positive. A diagnosis of IFP (Vanek's
polyp) of the ileum was made.
Conclusion: IFP is a rare and benign tumour of the digestive tract. It is
seen mainly in adults and very occasionally in children. IFP is frequently
revealed in children by intussusception that can be life-threatening, as in
the case of our patient. Its diagnosis is evoked on the various morpholog-
ical aspects on the microscopy and confirmed by the immunochemical
study.

intestinal T-cell lymphoma: a report of 7 cases
Z. Lajmi*, A. Bdioui, E. Ben Ammou, A. Ben Mabrouk, M. Krifa, T.
Dahmoul, S. Hmissa, M. Mokni
*Sahloul Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Intestinal T-cell lymphomas (ITCL) are rare
with variable clinical and pathological features. WHO classification has
been revised recently and classify them into: enteropathy-associated T-
cell lymphoma (EATL), monomorphic epitheliotropic Intestinal T-cell
Lymphoma(MEITL),ITCL not otherwise specified and Indolent T-cell
lymphoproliferative disorder of the GI tract.
Methods: It is a retrospective study including 7 cases of ITCL diagnosed
in the Department of Pathology of Farhat Hached and Sahloul University
Hospital of Sousse (Tunisia) during 2014-2020. This study included 6
men and a woman.
Results: 4 patients had symptoms of chronic abdominal pain. The other 3
patients underwent emergency operations due to acute perforation or
massive haematochezia. The site of lesion involvement was the small
bowel in 6 cases and the duodenum in one case. One patient had a history
of celiac disease. 7 specimens surgically resected were collected. Grossly,
5 patients had multifocal lesions. On immunohistochemistry, tumour cells
were positive for CD3 in all cases, CD5 in 3 cases and negative for CD20
in all cases. 2 of 4 patients with CD56 staining results were positive. One
patient was simultaneously CD56+ and granzyme B+ and was diagnosed
with intestinal NK/T-cell lymphoma.
Conclusion: ITCL is a rare and aggressive type of extranodal T-cell
lymphoma. It can be very challenging to diagnose clinically and particu-
larly on limited endoscopic biopsy samples. Its diagnosis should be cor-
related to clinical symptoms while the final diagnosis is mainly based on
the pathological and immunohistochemical features. An accurate diagno-
sis selects the proper operative approach that may reduce serious compli-
cations and create opportunities for further treatment.

Extramucosal anal canal adenocarcinoma, non-anal gland type, and
non-fistula-associated with mucinous appearance: a recently de-
scribed diagnostic entity
T. Laohawetwanit*, T. Hareerak, C. Thamwongskul, N. Boon-Ing
*Division of Pathology, Chulabhorn International College of Medicine,
Thammasat University, Pathumthani, Thailand
Background & objectives: Extramucosal anal canal adenocarcinoma,
non-anal gland type, and non-fistula-associated has been recently
Virchows Arch
proposed as a new entity in the WHO classification. Only a few cases of
intestinal-type have been reported. We presented a case of such an ex-
ceedingly rare malignancy.
Methods: Clinicopathologic features of a case of extramucosal anal canal
adenocarcinoma, non-anal gland type, and non-fistula-associated with
mucinous appearance were described.
Results: A 71-year-old male experienced painless anal bleeding. The
clinical diagnosis was internal haemorrhoids and an anal polyp.
Haemorrhoidectomy with excision of an anal polypoid lesion was per-
formed. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma embedded in a large
amount of extracellular mucin was observed. Most of the cancer cells
were centred in the connective tissue. Despite focal ulceration, most of
the overlying anal squamous mucosa remained intact. The neoplastic cells
showed lower gastrointestinal immunophenotype (CK7-/CK20+/
CDX2+/SATB2+). No lymph node metastasis is seen. Computed tomog-
raphy showed neither intrathoracic nor intraabdominal malignancy. The
pathological diagnosis was extramucosal anal canal adenocarcinoma,
non-anal gland type, and non-fistula-associated of mucinous-type. The
patient had disease-free survival at eight months postoperatively.
Conclusion: We presented a case of extramucosal anal canal adenocar-
cinoma, non-anal gland type, and non-fistula-associated of mucinous-
type. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first reported case of
such malignancy of mucinous-type. Recognition of such an uncommon
malignancy and excluding its mimics, including secondary anal canal
adenocarcinoma, fistula-associated anal canal adenocarcinoma, and mu-
cinous adenocarcinoma arising from primary anal Paget disease, is essen-
tial to arrive at the appropriate diagnosis, justify the treatment, and deter-
mine the prognosis.

Miranda-Pachón, G. Herrera Almario, R.E. Andrade Perez
*Department of Pathology and Laboratories, Fundación Santa Fe de
Bogotá/Universidad de Los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia
Background & objectives: Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs)
can co-exist with other primary tumours from the gastrointestinal (GI)
tract or other extra-GI sites. The aim of this study is to describe patients
with synchronous and metachronous GISTs in a reference centre in
Bogota, Colombia.
Methods: A case report series of 22 GIST cases with synchronous and
metachronous primary tumours were analysed; extracted from a retro-
spective descriptive study of 207 GIST cases at Hospital Universitario
Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá between 2008 and 2018.
Results: Of the 22 patients, 11 cases had synchronous tumours and 11
metachronous. Mean age at diagnosis were 69 and 68 years old, respec-
tively. 63.4% were male. GIST locations: stomach 68.2% (9 synchronous/6
metachronous), 22.3% small intestine (1 synchronous/4 metachronous),
and 9% other. Main histologic subtype was spindle cell (77.3%) and
40.9% were classified as low risk, all CD117/DOG1+. Coexistence tu-
mours included: GI adenocarcinomas (3 synchronous/2 metachronous),
pancreatic adenocarcinoma (3 synchronous), 1 synchronous cholangiocar-
cinoma, 4 metachronous prostatic adenocarcinomas, 2 metachronous pap-
illary thyroid carcinomas, 1 metachronous lymphoma, 1 synchronous mul-
tiple myeloma, 2 synchronous neuroendocrine neoplasms (small intestine/
peripancreatic) and 1 synchronous gastric-schwannoma. Median size was
1.40 cm (synchronous) vs 12 cm (metachronous) (p=0.0004).
Conclusion: We present cases of sporadic GISTs, which are infrequent
tumours. In accordance with results reported in our study and in published
literature; the coexistence of GISTs with other primary tumours (synchro-
nous or metachronous) are more common than expected. Synchronous
GISTs were mostly located in the stomach (9/11), and low risk (10/11).
Metachronous GISTs were mainly classified as high risk (7/11) and
mostly located in the small intestine and mesentery. The coexistence of
GISTs with other neoplasms should be carefully investigated.

Anal Involvement in patient with pemphigus vulgaris: case report
R.D.P. Lopez-Panqueva*, J. Andrade-Restrepo, J. Perez-Pinzón, M.
Ortiz-Pereira, R.E. Andrade Perez, M. Rolon, R. García-Duperly
*Department of Pathology and Laboratories, Fundación Santa Fe de
Bogotá/Universidad de Los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia
Background & objectives: Pemphigus Vulgaris (PV) is a low incidence
autoimmune mucocutaneous bullous disease, in which pathogenic anti-
bodies are directed against the keratinocyte cell surface. Although anal
involvement is unusual, correlations between its appearence and disease
severity have been recently reported.
Methods: A 41-year-old man presented with a one-year history of intense
anal pain episodes accompanied with bleeding rectal. He reported recur-
rent aphthous lesions in the oral mucosa and pharynx as well. He received
topical management for anal fissures without symptomatic improvement,
he was subsequently scheduled for chemical sphincterotomy with botu-
linum toxin and fissurectomy, with a clinical diagnosis of probable
Crohn's disease.
Results: The excised tissue showed an irregular white anal mucosa with
grey areas. Histopathological study of the resection revealed marked ep-
ithelial hyperplasia with areas of epithelial erosion, papillomatosis and
extensive, multiple intraepidermal suprabasal bullae containing detached
keratinocytes and occasional eosinophils. This process is known as
acantholysis and follows a disturbance and disruption of the intercellular
connections of the epidermis. Additionally, formations of microabscesses
in the superficial and middle dermis were identified with significant
amounts of lymphoplasmocytic cells, accompanied with areas of acute
inflammatory infiltration consisting of eosinophils and polymorphonu-
clears. This morphology suggests a vegetative variant of PV.
Conclusion: PV lesions can present on the skin or mucosa, although oral
lesions are the most common site of initial presentation. Anal canal and
perianal skin involvement may appear in extensive disease. Initial misdi-
agnosis is related to the chronic development and deteriorations of pa-
tients with PV. Anal PV is a diagnostic challenge and this case illustrates
the importance of a careful evaluation. Limited knowledge of anal PV
presentation can incorrectly diagnose lesions as anal fissures or anal
Crohn's disease.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis: a case report of
malignancy
J. Madeira*, J. Gama, B. Sepodes, V. Almeida, A. Lai, R. Oliveira
Caetano, M.R. Silva, M.A. Cipriano
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Centro Hospitalar e Universtário de
Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a
major hepatobiliary complication of ulcerative colitis (UC). The concom-
itance of both pathologies increases the risk of malignancy; however. the
etiologic relationship between PSC and UC still remains poorly
understood.
Methods: We present a case of a 36-year-old man diagnosed with PSC
who underwent liver transplantation due to biliary cirrhosis in 2004.
Seven years later, he is diagnosed with a severe and intractable form of
UC and submitted to periodic colic biopsies for evaluation of activity and
dysplasia, therapeutic adjustment and to rule out cytomegalovirus
infection.
Results: In 2018, during a routine biopsy he was diagnosed with invasive
adenocarcinoma, with mucin production and signet ring cells.
Immunohistochemistry analysis favoured colic origin with CK20 and
Virchows Arch
CDX2 strongly positive and CK7 focally positive. He underwent total
colectomy and the gross evaluation revealed a 10cm ulcerated neoplasm
in the caecum, whose histopathological study was in agreement with the
biopsy diagnosis, with pT3N2b staging. The molecular study revealed a
G12C mutation (p.Gly12Cys), in codon 12 of the KRAS gene.
Unfortunately, he died a month later. We cannot discard that the devel-
opment of this malignant neoplasm and the accelerated tumour growth
could have been a main complication of the prolonged immunosuppres-
sive therapy.
Conclusion: UC is the most prevalent form of inflammatory bowel dis-
ease, coexisting in 70-80% of patients with PSC. The risk of malignancy
is 4x higher in patients with PSC and UC, compared to those with isolated
UC. Dysplasia represents the best and most reliable marker of malignan-
cy; however, it can be invisible and difficult to identify. Colonoscopic
surveillance with 4 biopsies from every 10 cm of the entire colon and
from visible lesions remains the major way to detect early dysplasia.

Structure of the gallbladder wall in calculous cholecystitis on scan-
ning electron microscopy
T. Vervekina, B. Magrupov*
*Center for the development of professional skills of medical staff,
Republican Research Center of Emergency Medicine, Uzbekistan
Background & objectives: The development of digital technologies
allows in-depth study of pathological processes and clearly demonstrate
the spatial relationship of various structural elements in tissues. The anal-
ysis of the features of the gallbladder was no exception.
Methods: Gallbladder samples were obtained from 1,130 patients oper-
ated on for destructive and non-destructive calculous cholecystitis. Part of
the gallbladder was examined using a scanning electron microscope. The
preparation of samples for the study was carried out according to the
standard protocol. The samples were examined using a low-vacuum elec-
tron scanning microscope JSM-6010LV (Japan).
Results: The performed studies have shown that in acute destructive
calculous cholecystitis, the architectonics of the layers are preserved in
most cases. The mucous membrane and submucosal layer of the gallblad-
der form pronounced folds. The thickness of the submucosal layer in-
creases due to oedema, swelling of connective tissue elements and in-
flammatory infiltration. The muscle and connective tissue layer are thick-
ened. In non-destructive cholecystitis, the folds of the mucosa are flat-
tened. The muscle layer was sharply thickened due to hypertrophy of
muscle fibres and an increase in the percentage of connective tissue in
the intermuscular space.
Conclusion: The use of scanning microscopy in the study of the surface
of the gallbladder allows you to clearly determine the spatial relationship
of the wall layers, to identify changes in the structure of the layers, to
identify the localization zone and the prevalence of inflammatory infil-
trate and haemorrhage zones.

Synchronous breast carcinoma with carcinoma of the papilla of
Vater: report of a rare entity
S. Makni*, S. Graja, C. Chaari, O. Boudawara, C. Kammoun, N. Gouia,
T. Boudawara, R. Kallel
*Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Breast cancer (BC) occurring in man is a rare
entity (less than 1% of all male cancers). Ampullary carcinoma (AC) is a
rare tumour (0.5% of carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract). The coex-
istence of these two tumours is exceptional.
Methods: By the present case, we illustrate a rare situation of synchro-
nous tumour: breast carcinoma with carcinoma of the papilla of Vater in a
41-year-old man.
Results: The patient was diagnosed with invasive carcinoma with no
special type of the breast in September 2019. Two months later, he
consulted for jaundice. Explorations an ampullary mass measured 20
mm. Pathologic examination of the biopsy specimen concluded to a mod-
erately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The immunohistochemical study
for the GATA3 and CK20 antibodies was negative, excluding the hy-
pothesis of breast metastasis. The patient was a candidate for a left mas-
tectomy with a cephalic duodenopancreatectomy. The outcome was good
without recurrence or metastasis after a 16-month follow-up.
Conclusion: AC can be sporadic or be part of hereditary syndromes, in
these cases, AC is associated with colorectal cancer. Association with BC
is not well-illustrated. Some authors suggest that the BRCA2 gene muta-
tion is a common risk factor of these tumours. The frequency of this
mutation varies between 4 and 40% for male BC and is about 12,5 %
for AC. Further genetic studies will be needed to prove the implication of
the BRCA2 gene mutation in this exceptional association.

*Colentina University Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Although HER2 activation is low in colo-
rectal carcinoma (CCR) – approximately 5%– it has been demonstrat-
ed that HER2 status is associated with a poor prognosis. We aimed to
investigate other prognosis markers that can be used to preview pa-
tients’ outcome.
Methods: Immunostaining for p53, Ki67, microsatellite instability
markers (MSI) and CDX2 was performed on 10 consecutive HER2 pos-
itive CRC. Membrane HER2 positivity was scored as 1+/2+/3+. p53
expression was scored as 1+ (5-25%), 2+ (25-75%) or 3+ (>75% ).
Ki67 was quantified in the same manner as CDX2: the percentage of
positive nuclei. MSI analysis was recorded as negative/positive.
Results: All tumours were adenocarcinomas, 90% being moderately dif-
ferentiated (G2), while only one case was poorly differentiated (G3). Of
the 10 cases 60% were HER2 3+, 30% HER2 2+ and 10% HER2 1+. p53
IHC showed 70% of cases 3+, 20% 2+, 10% 1+. High Ki-67 expression
(>40%) was observed in all cases. CDX2 was hyperexpressed in each
case with over 90% of nuclei stained. MSI, as expected according to the
literature, was negative in the majority of cases, with 20% resulting pos-
itive. HER2 expression was significantly associated with p53 positivity
(p=0.001).
Conclusion: Since HER 2 expression is consecrated to represent a poor
prognosis for the patient, it is important to acknowledge all the other
factors which may intervene in the process of evaluating the risk, espe-
cially those that appear with the highest frequency. High KI67 index and
p53 positivity also indicate a poor outcome. CDX2 loss is rare in HER2
positive CRC.

A proposal for modification of Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group
International (PSOGI) classification according to Ki-67 proliferation
index in pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP)
A. Martínez*, Á. Arjona-Sánchez, A. Sanz Zorrilla, F. Leiva-Cepas, R.
Ortega Salas
*Hospital Universitario Reina Sofía, Spain
Background & objectives: PMP is classified by PSOGI into three
groups: PMP low-grade histology (LG-PMP), PMP high-grade (HG-
PMP), and with signet ring cells (SC-PMP). Ki67 proliferation index is
a prognostic factor for several tumours. We related its PMP positivity rate
to patients’ outcomes.
Virchows Arch
Methods: Prospective study using collected tissue samples from patients
with PMP treated in our Unit from 1997 to 2020. The entire cohort was
classified according to the new PSOGI LG-PMP, HG-PMP, or SC-PMP
groupings and cases with acellular mucin.
In addition, Ki67 proliferation index was determined immuno-
histochemically in HG-PMP samples.
Results: The 5 years overall survival (OS) were 72% and 22% for Ki67
less or equal to 15% and greater than 15%, respectively.
The HG-PMP group was divided in two subcategories using the Ki67
15% cut-off (PSOGI-Ki67). The multivariate analysis showed as only
prognostic factor for overall survival and for disease free survival the
PSOGI-Ki67 variable: OS 161+/-14; 128+/-17 y 31+/-8 months for
LG-PMP, HG-PMP-Ki67<15% and HG-PMP-Ki67>15%. The mean
disease-free survival (DFS) was 138+/-10; 66+/-9 and 19+/-5 months in
each group. Mean DFS at 5 years was 100%, 70% and 24%, and mean
DFS at 5 years was 90%, 40% y 0%, in each group.
Conclusion: The division of the HG-PMP category into the PSOGI PMP
classification according to the Ki67 proliferation index provides two sub-
categories well defined with significant differences for overall survival
and disease-free survival. This new proposal modification must be vali-
dated in an international collaborative study.

A.P. Martínez Aracil*, M.M. Buda, È. Iglesias Martínez, N. Santiago
Quispe, Á. Pérez Rodríguez, C. Miguel
*Clinical Department Unit of Pathological Anatomy, OSI Araba, Araba
University Hospital; Bioaraba Health Research Institute, Vitoria-Gasteiz,
Alava, Spain
Background & objectives: We report the case of an 81-year-old woman
with severe colic abdominal pain, which underwent emergency surgery
after radiological diagnosis of intestinal intussusception. As a result, an
uncommon neoplasm in the gastrointestinal tract was discovered.
Methods: We carried out a thorough medical history revision, followed
by meticulous macroscopic, microscopic and immunohistochemical
study. In addition, a complete literature review was undertaken.
Results: A 15 cm ileocecal resection specimen with a 3.2x2cm ileal
pedunculated polypoid lesion was received. The lesion showed a solid,
whitish-fibroelastic surface.
Microscopically,thelesionconsistedofadisorderedproliferationcomposed
by pleomorphic cells, some were spindled-shape, others epithelioid, with
marked nuclear atypia, eosinophilic cytoplasm and high mitotic index. The
describedneoplasminvadedthemuscularispropriawithoutaffectingserosa.
No Necrosis, lymphovascular or perineural tumour invasion was identified.
Immunohistochemically, neoplastic cells showed positivity for smooth
muscle actin, desmin and caldesmon, while CKAE1 / AE3, S100,
CD117, DOG1 and CD34 were negative.
Thus, the final diagnosis was established as pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma
with free resection margins.
Conclusion: Leiomyosarcomas are malignant mesenchymal neoplasms
derived from smooth muscle cells that rarely develop in the gastrointes-
tinal tract, with the ileum being the most frequent location. Furthermore,
the described case showed an infrequent clinical and macroscopic presen-
tation, with intestinal subocclusion that required emergency surgery and
resection of the intestinal affected segment. Due to the clinical presenta-
tion and the emergency operation, the patient obtained optimal oncolog-
ical surgery with wide tumour resection and free margins.

Childhood intestinal PTEN hamartomatous polyposis: a case report
M. Mellouli*, M. Zghal, I. Saguem, M. Bouhamed, S. Charfi, C.
Kammoun, T. Boudawara, S. Makni
*Habib Bourguiba Hospital Department of Pathology, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Gastrointestinal polyps are most frequently
sporadic in nature. Some polyps appear as a part of hereditary polyposis
syndromes. Hamartomatous polyposis syndromes (HPS) comprise a
group of distinct entities. The objective is to analyse epidemiological,
clinical and pathological characteristics of HPS.
Methods: A female infant of 2-year-old presented acute bowel intussus-
ception. The patient had the history of bilateral cervical lipoma. Physical
examination showed axillary and cervical nodules. Thoraco-abdominal
computed tomography revealed small bowel invagination with
polypoidal appearance of the intestine. Mediastinal and abdominal lymph
nodes were identified. Segmental intestinal resection with left axillary
nodules excision was performed.
Results: Macroscopically, the intestine was diffusely involved by sessile
polyps measuring 1 to 5 mm. The mesentery comprises hyperplastic
lymph nodes. The axillary nodules were with adipose nature.
Histologically, polyps were with different histological types. Some
polyps were inflammatory composed of enlarged villi with non-
dysplastic epithelium and exhibit inflamed axis. Others were hyperplastic
polyps composed of serrated hyperplastic crypts. Few polyps were cate-
gorized into lymphoid polyps. Mesenteric lymph nodes were hyperplasic.
A final diagnosis of hamartomatous polyposis was made. Microscopical
examination of axillary nodules confirmed the diagnosis of benign lipo-
ma. Given admixture of polyp histology and the association with
lipomatosis and hyperplasic lymph nodes, PTEN hamartoma tumour syn-
drome was considered.
Conclusion: HPS are rare hereditary cancer syndromes which occur at
any age. They include Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, juvenile polyposis syn-
drome and PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome (PTHS). PHTS is a high-
ly variable autosomal dominant condition associated with macrocephaly,
bowel admixture hamartomatous polyps, lipomatosis, penile freckling
and lymphoid tissue hyperplasia. Their diagnosis may rely on clinical
and histological criteria but genetic test is the gold standard for HPS

Malignant gastrointestinal neuroectodermal tumour in small intes-
tine presented with perforation in young man; a rare case
E. Taştekin, E. Mercan Demirtaş*, B. Öztorun, A. Sezer
*Department of Pathology, Trakya University, School of Medicine,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Malignant Gastrointestinal Neuroectodermal
Tumour (MGNT) was a rare tumour of gastrointestinal system. It is an
aggressive tumour with a high rate of local recurrence, metastases, and
early death from disease.
Methods: A 29 years old male patient admitted to the emergency service
with severe abdominal pain. Physical examination, radiological and lab-
oratory findings suggested a perforation is caused by mass 5 cm sized in
small intestine. Partial small intestine resection was performed by general
surgery department.
Results: We received an intestinal segment measuring 12 cm in length.
Intestinal wall showed perforation with extensive exudate. Cut surface
showed a mass with extensive necrosis and haemorrhage measuring
5×4.5×4 cm. Tumour was present in the gut wall; overlying mucosa was
ulcerated. Microscopically a poorly differentiated malignant tumour show-
ing solid pattern. Tumour cells were having eosinophilic/clear cytoplasm,
ovoid nuclei with dispersed chromatin and conspicuous nucleoli. Tumour
was mitotically active(5-6/10hpf) and Ki67 proliferation index was 15%.
On immunohistochemistry, tumour was positive for vimentin, S100,
synaptophysin, CD56, SOX10, cyclin-D1, FLI-1, neurofilament and were
negative for panCK, CD117, HMB-45, CD34, SMA, desmin, CD99 and
chromogranin. EWSR1 gene rearrangement was determined by the FISH.
Conclusion: We thought that due to the limited literature available on
GNET and rarity of this neoplasm documentation of any such case is
important. The combined approach utilizing a comprehensive panel of
Virchows Arch
immunohistochemical markers along with molecular analyses is suggested
for identification of this tumour and distinguishing it from its mimickers.

Malignant gastrointestinal neuroectodermal tumour of the ileum: a
case report
C. Mora*, R.L. Rego
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Instituto Português de Oncologia de
Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Lisbon, Portugal
Background & objectives: Malignant gastrointestinal neuroectodermal
tumour (GNET) is a highly aggressive, recently identified primary gas-
trointestinal malignant mesenchymal tumour, characterized by epithelioid
and/or spindle cells, arranged in various patterns. Its’ hallmark is the
Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 gene (EWSR1) rearrangement.
Methods: We report a case of an 80-year-old woman, who was admitted
with melena, haematochezia and anaemia. The patient underwent capsule
endoscopy showing an exophytic bloody lesion on the terminal ileal wall,
and a MRI that prompted suspicion of a malignant gastrointestinal stro-
mal tumour (GIST).
Results: A segmentar enterectomy was performed, and the specimen
showed a nodular, mass-forming, ulcerated lesion, with 6x5,5x5 cm.
Histopathological features included a transmural infiltration by a neoplas-
tic population composed of nests and solid sheets of oval cells, with scant
clear cytoplasm, and nuclei had vesicular chromatin with prominent nu-
cleoli. Tumour cells showed immunoreactivity for CD99 (strong and
diffuse), and were negative for DOG1. FISH analysis showed split
EWSR signal (22q12). Primitive gastrointestinal neuroectodermal tu-
mour was the final diagnosis. The patient remained disease free for 27
months, until she became symptomatic with diarrhoea. CT and PET scan
were performed and identified three intra-abdominal metastases.
Conclusion: Malignant gastrointestinal neuroectodermal tumour, al-
though rare, should be suspected in cases of a gastrointestinal tumour
displaying epithelioid and/or spindle cells in various patterns. EWSR1
chromosomal rearrangement is recommended to confirm this diagnosis.
We report the oldest patient with this tumour arising in the ileum, to our
best knowledge. Because of its rarity, the prognostic information of this
tumour is limited, no staging criteria are suggested, and treatment re-
sponse to chemotherapy and targeted therapy remains unknown.

Intestinal tuberculosis mimicking cancer clinically: a case report
F. Mundim*, G. Vallim, J. Polesel, R. Barros, P. Mundim, N. Sousa
*UNIVAS/UNIFENAS, Brazil
Background & objectives: Tuberculosis is an infectious disease trans-
mitted by air and caused mainly by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The
disease mainly affects the lungs and can affect other organs and tissues
in the body. In this case, a form of intestinal tuberculosis will be clinically
mimicking cancer.
Methods: Male patient, 49 years old, referred to the Pouso Alegre
Hospital/Brazil, due to severe diffuse abdominal pain, greater in the epi-
gastric region, with two months of evolution. After clinical, laboratory,
and CT exams, he underwent surgery and, when entering the cavity, a
tumour was evidenced in the topography of the cecum affecting the as-
cending colon and several more lesions in the small intestine.
Results: Samples of intestinal tissues with supposed neoplasia were sent
for anatomopathological examination. Having a diagnosis of tuberculo-
sis, involving large and small intestine walls, presenting a chronic gran-
ulomatous inflammatory process with central caseous necrosis and posi-
tive microscopic examination of acid-alcohol resistant bacillus.
Conclusion: In Brazil and other developing countries, tuberculosis is still
a disease in evidence. In this reported case, we affirm the importance of
histopathological analysis and diagnosis that will define the correct
treatment (in the present case, the clinical approach showed a neoplasm,
after the histopathological result, the treatment was completely redirected
towards infectious contagious disease.

EBV-positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder: an un-
usual presentation
Z. Nfikha*, N. Abdessayed, Y. Fejji, A. Bchir, Y. Sarra, S. Chaieb, M.
Mokni
*Department Of Pathology, Farhat Hached Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder
(PTLD) is a rare but serious complication following solid organ trans-
plantation. It manifests in the setting of chronic immunosuppression, and
it is often associated with the Epstein Barr Virus. PTLD occurs in only 1-
3% of renal transplant recipients.
Methods: we report a case of primary aggressive liver involvement of
PTLD in a 29 years female patient 6 years after renal transplant. Renal
transplant was followed by immunosuppressive treatment. An 11 cm liver
mass was discovered during a routine check-up for the renal transplant
and the patient underwent an hepatic segmentectomy with cholestectomy
and periportal lymph node dissection.
Results: Gross examination showed the presence of a 10 cm, well-limited
and subcapsular mass. Histologically, it is a diffuse lymphomatous pro-
liferation. Tumour cells were large and rounded with scanty eosinophilic
cytoplasm and hyperchromatic enlarged nuclei, very often with a prom-
inent nucleolus giving a prominent immunoblastic phenotype. Some cells
showed a centroblastic phenotype and others were atypical. On immuno-
histochemistry, the tumour cells expressed diffusely the anti-CD20 anti-
body and focally the anti-CD30 antibody. CD5, CD3, ALK and CD15
were negative. Search for EBV infection by means of the anti-LMP1
antibody came back positive. Hybridization "EBER" was positive. The
diagnosis retained was that of EBV-positive post-transplant diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma of the liver.
Conclusion: PTLD is a serious complication following solid organ trans-
plantation. It occurs in only 1-3% of renal-transplant recipients, in which
the gastrointestinal tract represents the most common location. EBV in-
fection is a key contributor in PTLD development. WHO categorizations
of PTLD are divided into early lesions, polymorphic, monomorphic, and
classical Hodgkin lymphoma type PTLD. Histological examination is the
gold standard for PTLD diagnosis. Diagnosis should be considered in any
patient presenting with a liver mass following solid organ transplant.

Unusual presentation of gastrointestinal tract vasculitis
Z. Nfikha*, N. Abdessayed, A. Bchir, Y. Fejji, D. Chiba, A. Ben
Abdelkader, B. Sriha, M. Mokni
*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract by
vasculitis is rare. It can occur as a solitary organ vasculitis or in the
context of a systemic vasculitis. Complications may occur, which may
be fatal in the setting of a delayed diagnosis.
Methods: Herein we report a case of 75 years male patient with no medical
history who presented with constipation and abdominal pain. Colonoscopy
showed the presence of a stenosing tumour of the ascending colon.
Results: A biopsy was performed and did not show tumour tissue. The CT-
scan showed the presence of a tumour of the right colon with a
perineoplastic abscess, hence the indication for an emergency operation.
Right colectomy was performed. On gross examination the right colon was
perforated, with a brownish indurated mesocolon. The colonic wall was
indurated and the mucosa was ulcerated. Histological examination showed
ischemic necrosis of the cecum with perforation as well as the presence of
vasculitis of the small and medium vessels with fibrinoid necrosis of the
Virchows Arch
ileocolic vessels and in the fat of the abdominal wall. Non-necrotizing
epithelioid and gigantocellular granulomas were also observed.
Conclusion: Vasculitis involving the gastrointestinal tract is uncommon. It
often occurs in young female patients. Inaugural and pseudotumoral pre-
sentation as described in our case is unusual but described. Numerous
vasculitic disorders may involve the gastrointestinal tract, but, solitary or-
gan vasculitis with no evidence of systemic vasculitis may be almost as
common. Involvement of the GI tract may lead to serious complications,
including ischemia and perforation. Knowledge of the spectrum of vascu-
lopathies that may affect the gastrointestinal tract is critical for diagnosis.

Colitis cystica profunda with dysplastic features presenting in the
right semicolon: a case report
M. Nifora*, E. Logotheti, K. Sapounas, T. Zogka, M. Theodorakopoulou,
S. Vgenopoulou, C. Zoumpouli
*Sismanoglion General Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Colitis Cystica Profunda is an uncommon
non-neoplastic entity. Patients are usually middle-aged males and it is
more often encountered in the left semicolon. We hereby present a case
of Colitis Cystica Profunda with high-grade dysplastic changes.
Methods: A 53-year-old female patient with history of cystic fibrosis and
recently experiencing constipation, came to our Hospital for a scheduled
check-up. Colonoscopy showed a firm protruding mass close to the
ileocecal valve. A biopsy specimen was obtained which revealed high-
grade dysplasia. The patient underwent a right hemicolectomy and the
specimen was sent to the Pathology Lab for further evaluation.
Results: The gross examination of the specimen revealed a firm, polyp-
oid, mucosal lesion, with a gelatinous cut-surface, resulting in partial
obstruction of the right colon. The microscopic examination showed
multiple, well-circumscribed cystic mucosal infoldings, mostly filled with
mucin, surrounded by lamina propria and located exclusively in the sub-
mucosa, without involvement of the muscularis propria. The misplaced
epithelial element often exhibited atypical histology, either of reactive
nature or high-grade dysplasia, the latter positive for CK8/18 and
p504s. The aforementioned lesion was signed out as colitis cystica
profunda with high-grade dysplasia.
Conclusion: Colitis cystica profunda with dysplasia is a rare nosological
entity. About 200 cases have been reported in the literature so far. It is
most commonly encountered alongside previously diagnosed inflamma-
tory bowel disease and it may be misinterpreted as a malignant lesion
both clinically and radiologically. Pathologists should remain alert to the
possibility of a possible mucin producing adenocarcinoma. Correlation
with the patient’s history and the endoscopic and radiologic findings is
crucial for the correct pathological diagnosis.

*Department of Pathology, University of Health Science, Istanbul
Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey
Background & objectives: When COVID-19 hit Turkey, most of the
elective surgeries were suspended during this time. Our main goal here is
to re-evaluate TNM stages of cancer patients undergoing gastrectomy and
colectomy before and during the peak of Covid-19.
Methods: The first Covid-19 case was detected in March 2020 in Turkey.
Therefore, we evaluated the gastric and colon cancer specimens admitted
to our lab in the period of one year prior to and one year following
March 2020. We compared the cases, before the Covid-19 pandemic, to
the peak of pandemic according their pathologic TNM stage.
Results: This study included 41 gastric cancer and 160 colon cancer
patients from the baseline period ;28 gastric cancer, 115 colon cancer
patients from the COVID-19 period. Among the gastrectomy specimens
before covid, 9 pT1 (21.9%), 5 pT2 (12.1%), 13 pT3 (31.7%) and 14 pT4
(34.1%) were reported. Among the colectomy specimens; 9 were pT1
(5.6%), 10 were pT2(6.2%), 69 were pT3 (43.1%) and 72 were pT4
(45%). During pandemic period, gastric carcinoma stages were distribut-
ed as 5 pT1 (18%), 2 pT2(7.1%), 7 pT3 (25%) and 14 pT4 (50%). Also,
colectomy specimens during pandemic revealed 4 pT1(3.5%), 8
pT2(7%), 62 pT3(54%), 41 pT4 (35.7%) cases.
Conclusion: During the pandemic, decreased number of gastrectomy and
colectomy specimens was observed. The proportion of pT4 gastric carci-
noma cases was increased significantly. Besides, distinctive difference in
stages of colon cancer patients were absent. Consequently, the adversity
to reach health care in pandemic led the gastric cancer patients to be
operated at advanced stages. Since pandemic still carries on and admis-
sions to hospitals are fewer than normal, we think that we will encounter
with more progressive cancer specimens in the future.

*University of Fortaleza, Brazil
Background & objectives: Anal cancer (AC) have been on the rise for
the past 30 years. It was proposed an internal referral flow from the
specialized network for people with HIV to assess aspects related to the
prevention of AC.
Methods: Volunteers were evaluated by a colorectal surgeon. A anorectal
exam was performed and anal swab samples were collected for Liquid-
based anal cytology, expression of E6 and E7 oncoproteins and high and
low risk human papillomavirus genotyping. When altered cytology was
found, a high-resolution anoscopy was performed with biopsy of suspi-
cious areas.
Results: 223 volunteers were evaluated, regardless of gender or age.
Positivity for human papilloma virus was 85.6% and genotyping for
high-risk subtypes was 44.8%. The expression of E6 and E7 oncoproteins
was 57.4%. The anal cytology showed 6.7% of altered samples but none
of the biopsies performed during the magnification anoscopy showed
dysplastic or neoplastic lesions.
Conclusion: The high positivity of the human papillomavirus in the anal
region, highlights the need for prevention programs. However, the num-
ber of alterations in cytology was very low and since these are very young
patients, it can be suggested that screening programs, locally, can start at a
later age.

Emphysematous cholecystitis: case report
T. Pasupati Meenakshi*, B. Karikalan
*Clinipath Sdn Bhd, Malaysia
Background & objectives: Emphysematous cholecystitis is a fulminant
variety of acute cholecystitis that differs in its pathology and epidemiol-
ogy from cholecystitis, induced by gallstones. Salient feature of this acute
cholecystitis is the presence of gas in the lumen and wall of the
gallbladder.
Methods: A rare case of emphysematous cholecystitis, occurring in a 66-
year-old female, presenting with septicaemic shock is documented.
Grossly, a fully cut open, indurated gallbladder, measuring74x43mm,
with a wall thickness of 5 to 8 mm was received. Representative sections
were submitted in five blocks. Routine H&E analysis was carried out and
the histological features were reported digitally using Aperio Image
Scope.
Virchows Arch
Results: Multiple representative sections from the gallbladder showed
classical large bullous emphysematous changes on the surface of the
gallbladder, scattered within which acute inflammatory cells and necrotic
material in variable proportion were noticed. Similar cystically dilated,
gas filled, empty spaces within the muscularis propria were observed.
Patchy areas of haemorrhagic congestion were seen in the subserosal coat
distinctly. Formation of occasional Rokitansky- Aschoff sinuses with
acute necrosis, along with formation of septic emboli within the glands
was observed.
Foci of lymphoid aggregates, with presence of hemosiderin- laden mac-
rophages were also seen.
Classical features of necrotizing, emphysematous cholecystitis was con-
firmed. E coli was isolated from the gallbladder lumen.
Conclusion: Though rare in occurrence, an entity of emphysematous
cholecystitis needs to be considered in the acute onset of cholecystitis
cases, especially over the age of 50 years. Radiological imaging, as it
was done in this case, can help to make a preoperative diagnosis. This is
a life-threatening emergency and prompt surgical intervention is required.

Retrorectal adenocarcinoma associated with a tailgut cyst: a case
report and literature review
M. Brito Pereira*, C. Alves-Vale, J. Palla Garcia, E. Vitorino
*Pathology Department, CUF Descobertas Hospital, Lisbon, Portugal,
Portugal
Background & objectives: Tailgut cyst, also known as retrorectal cystic
hamartoma, is a lesion thought to be originated from the embryonic rem-
nants of the tailgut. The last reported incidence was of 0,55% in paediatric
population. Non-complete excision leads to recurrence.
Methods: This report presents the case of a 39-year-old woman with a
history of a sacrococcygeal cyst that was partially excised in childhood. In
September of 2020, a tailgut cyst was excised and diagnosed in our
institution. Four months post-surgery, due to persistent back pain, an
imagiologic re-evaluation was performed by MRI.
Results: The imagiologic re-evaluation revealed a persistence of the solid
portion of the previously described lesion, with the involvement of the
anococcygeal raphe, with a major axis of 45mm. An operative excision
of this lesion was performed. Microscopically, a proliferation of neoplastic
cells with hyperchromatic nuclei was observed, infiltrating the fibrous-
connective tissue and forming rare glands. Perineural and lymphovascular
invasions were identified. The neoplastic cells were positive for cytokeratin
7, cytokeratin 20, CDX2 and negative for beta-catenin. The diagnosis was
of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of colorectal versus retro-rectal
origin. A fragment of a cystic wall with ciliated epithelium, resembling
the previously excised tailgut cyst, was also present.
Conclusion: The history of a previous tailgut cyst associated with a
recurrent lesion in the area should increase suspicion for the risk of ma-
lignancy. Since the incidence of malignancy is considered to be higher
than previously referred in literature, extensive sampling is required. In
this case, after analysing the histochemical profile and undergoing an
extensive thoraco-abdominopelvic evaluation for a possible primary le-
sion that held no results, the adenocarcinoma was regarded as a retro-
rectal primary entity.

A rare cause of pneumoperitoneum: pneumatosis
cystoides intestinalis
D. Sá*, C. Peixoto, F. Costa, J.R. Vizcaíno
*Service of Anatomic Pathology, Hospital Santo António, Centro
Hospitalar Universitário do Porto (CHUP), Portugal
Background & objectives: Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis is a rare
subtype of intestinal pneumatosis that is characterized by gas-filled cav-
ities located in the intestinal mucosa, submucosa and subserosa. It can
occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract, but the colon is the most
common location.
Methods: We report a case of a 90-year-old woman that presented to the
emergency department with a 48 hour history of acute diffuse abdominal
pain, abdominal distension and vomiting. A computed tomography scan
showed free air in the peritoneal cavity (pneumoperitoneum) and multiple
air-filled spaces within the wall of a segment of the jejunum along with
several diverticula.
Results: The patient was submitted to an emergency laparotomy and
due to suspicion of diverticular perforation a segmental bowel resec-
tion was performed. Gross specimen of the 20cm long resected seg-
ment of the jejunum showed multiple empty cavities expanding the
submucosa and the subserosa with a sponge-like appearance. Several
jejunal diverticula were found along the intestinal wall, none of them
with signs of diverticulitis, perforation or haemorrhage. The histolog-
ical examination showed multiple empty cavities which were ob-
served predominantly in the submucosa but also in the mucosa,
muscularis propria and subserosa. The periphery of these cavities
was lined by multinucleated giant cells. The diverticula had no re-
markable inflammation and no signs of perforation.
Conclusion: Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) can be divided into
primary or idiopathic type and secondary type. Secondary causes of PCI
include pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel disease, connective tis-
sue disorders, iatrogenic procedures, medications and organ transplanta-
tion. There are only a few case reports of PCI associated with jejunal
diverticulosis and it is hypothesized that the cause of this association
could be related with mechanical and bacterial factors.

*SBU Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Educational and Research Hospital,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Secondary tumours of the gastrointestinal
tract are rare and may mimic primary tumours at the morphological level.
In this study, the distribution of tumours metastasizing to the gastrointes-
tinal system were investigated.
Methods: 39 cases diagnosed with metastasis in the gastrointestinal system
inourdepartmentbetween2010and2021wereincludedinthestudy.Serosal
implants that do not cause mass lesions were excluded from the study.
Results: 23 of the patients were female and 16 were male and their ages
ranged from 31-81. The primary focus is the female genital system in ten
cases (seven cases of the ovary, two cases of endometrium, one case of
endometrial stromal sarcoma), the lung in seven cases, the breast in six
cases, the stomach in five cases, the kidney in three cases, the prostate and
bladder in two by two. The most common metastasis was located in the
colorectal region with 25 cases. This was followed by small intestine
metastasis in 12 cases, gastric metastasis in seven cases, appendix metas-
tasis in two, and oesophageal metastasis in one.
Conclusion: The presence of multiple lesions, the absence of tumour
growth from the mucosa in resection materials for epithelial tumours,
the widespread lymphovascular invasion, the absence of the precursor
lesion, the sharpness of the tumour-mucosa transition, as well as the
presence of tumour with unexpected morphology for the organ may be
diagnostic clues. In such cases, careful anamnesis, endoscopic, radiolog-
ical findings, evaluation of tumour markers and organ-specific immuno-
histochemical examination also guides the diagnosis.

*Metaxa Cancer Hospital Pathology Department, Greece
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Advanced gastric cancer is often metastatic
to the liver, peritoneum, lungs and bones. On the contrary, gastric metas-
tasis to the colon is quite rare.
We present a rare case of metachronous gastric cancer metastasis to the
traverse colon.
Methods: A 57-year-old female with a past medical history of gastric
cancer, diffuse type, presented with symptoms of partial bowel obstruc-
tion and on CT-imaging was diagnosed with oedema and thickening of
the traverse colon wall. The patient underwent a subtotal colectomy.
Grossly there was stenosis of the traverse colon lumen and thickening
of the wall extending in total length 10cm.
Results: The histological examination revealed whole-thickness invasion
of the colonic wall by cancer cells with eccentric nucleus, eosinophilic
cytoplasm and occasional signet-ring features. A panel of immunohisto-
chemical markers was used which highlighted the CK7(+), CK20 (-),
CDX2(+), GATA3(-), ER(-), PR(-) immunophenotype of the cancer cells.
The aforementioned morphological features and immunohistochemical
findings, along with the patient’s past medical history, established a diag-
nosis of metachronous gastric cancer metastasis to the colon.
Conclusion: Gastric cancer with synchronous or metachronous metasta-
sis to the GI tract is rare. It is usually associated with diffuse gastric
cancer, plastic linitis and peritoneal dissemination. The patients have
end-stage disease with poor outcome and short-term survival rate.
Differential diagnosis includes other carcinomas that can metastasize to
the GI tract, such as lobular breast carcinoma and prostate cancer, so a
detailed medical history is paramount for the diagnosis.

Extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumour of the greater omentum (E-
GIST) - two cases report
G. Stanc*, E. Souka, N. Novkovic, J. Spiliotis, E. Efstathiou, C.
Valavanis
*Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: E-GISTs are intra-abdominal mesenchymal
tumours occurring outside the gastrointestinal tract and comprise less than
5% of GISTs. Great omentum GISTs account for 1% of all E-GISTs.
They affect more commonly elderly patients.
Methods: It is very important to recognize E-GISTs given their unknown
biological behaviour. We present two cases of E-GIST arising in great
omentum, both in males, 67 and 65 years old.
Results: In the first case, the tumour was composed histologically of
spindle neoplastic cells with palisading features. There were >5 mitosis/
50HPF. In the second case, the neoplastic cells had an epithelioid mor-
phology with <5mitosis/50HPF. In both cases, necrosis was present in
<50% of the tumour and no infiltration of the capsule was found. A panel
of immunohistochemical markers comprising of Vimentin, CD117,
CD34, SMA, Desmin, PDGFRα and DOG1 was used and the findings
were consistent with the diagnosis of E-GIST.
Conclusion: It is very important to recognize E-GIST, because there are
uncommon and rare intra-abdominal tumours. The therapeutic approach
is surgical removal in combination with administration of a tyrosine ki-
nase inhibitor (imatinib mesylate), while chemotherapy and radiotherapy
are not effective.

Renal cell carcinoma metastasis in the duodenum - an unusual site
A. Tanoglidi*, I. Nitsios, A. Sykaras, E. Gioti, C. Karantzias, C. Kouvidou
*Department of Pathology, Evangelismos General Hospital, Athens,
Greece
Background & objectives: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) metastases to
the duodenum are exceedingly rare with less than 30 cases reported in the
literature. We report a recent case from our institution, presented with
gastrointestinal bleeding.
Methods: A 76-year-old male with NSAID intake and a history of right
nephrectomy9yearsearlierforRCCwasadmittedtothehospitalbecauseof
episodes of melena. Coloscopy was normal but gastroscopy revealed a 4cm
ulcer with dirty base in the duodenum and a biopsy was performed. Sections
from the specimen were examined with H+E and immunohistochemistry.
Results: Microscopical examination revealed normal enteric type epithe-
lium on surface with foci of an ulcerated, infiltrative tumour. Tumour
cells demonstrated abundant clear cytoplasm and distinct membrane
and were mainly arranged in compact nests, showing focally sarcomatoid
features. Immunohistochemistry was performed taking into consideration
patient’s history and tumour cells were positive for Pax8, CAIX,
Vimentin, focally for RCC and CD10 and negative for CK7, AE1/AE3,
p40, GATA3, S100 and MelanA. Gastrointestinal origin of the tumour
was excluded due to negativity for CK20 and CDX2. The morphological
aspect and the immunohistochemical profile lead to a diagnosis consistent
with metastasis of clear cell renal carcinoma in the duodenum.
Conclusion: RCC behaves unpredictably with a diverse range of clinical
manifestations. Small bowel metastases from RCC are rare, the incidence
has been described as 2-4%. The duodenum is involved less commonly
than the small intestine, yet this possibility must be taken into account in
patients with a history of renal cancer regardless of the time after nephrec-
tomy. Clinical correlation and immunohistochemistry are mandatory for
establishing a correct diagnosis excluding neoplasms with clear cell mor-
phology arising in or metastatic to this area.

Adenosquamous gastric carcinoma of the pylorus - an elusive entity
with peculiar morphology
D. Tapoi*, A. Dumitru, A.M. Ciongariu, A. Voinovici, C. Postoronca, L.
Tribus, S. Grădinaru, C. Alius, M. Sajin
*University Emergency Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Gastric adenosquamous carcinoma is an ex-
ceedingly rare entity, defined as an admixture of glandular and squamous
cells, the latter accounting for at least 25% of the tumour. This cancer is
particularly aggressive and has a worse outcome than gastric
adenocarcinomas.
Methods: The aim of this report is to gain further insight into this rare and
aggressive variant of gastric cancer, in order to provide a complete diag-
nosis and the best therapy strategy. Emphasis is placed on evaluating
tumour grade and depth and the amount of squamous component in both
the tumour and lymphatic metastasis, possible predictors of survival rates.
Results: We present the case of a 77-year-old man diagnosed with gastric
adenosquamous carcinoma of the pyloric region and liver metastasis. On
standard examination the tumour exhibits characteristic features of an
adenosquamous carcinoma with highly atypical glandular cells and a
squamous cell carcinoma component comprising more than 60% of the
tumour. The malignant proliferation penetrates the serosa and displays
both perineural and lympho-vascular invasion. Five out of twelve lymph
nodes present massive tumour invasion, all of which displayed a signif-
icant proportion of squamous component.
Conclusion: Gastric adenosquamous carcinoma is associated with a poor
prognosis in comparison to typical gastric adenocarcinomas. The mech-
anism of this remains unclear due to the rarity of this disease. As the
squamous component has been linked to advanced stage and resistance
to treatment, it is crucial to fully assess its extent in both the tumour and
lymphatic and distant metastasis. With a better understanding of gastric
adenosquamous carcinomas, future studies can focus on target therapies
than will increase survival.

Department of General and Clinical Pathology, Medical University-
Plovdiv, Bulgaria
Background & objectives: Aberrant expression of CK7/CK20/CDx2 is
reported in a percentage of colorectal carcinomas (CRC). The objective of
this study is to investigate specific morphological and immunohistochem-
ical characteristics of colorectal carcinoma with KRAS mutation status
and microsatellite instability.
Methods: A total of 71 patients with CRC and examined KRAS mutation
status were included in the investigation. Immunohistochemistry was
performed using antibody to CK7, CK20, CDx2, PMS2, MSH6. An
automatic immunostainer (Ventana BenchMark GX) was used following
the manufacturer' protocols. Fisher's exact test was used for statistical
analysis (P value < 0.05).
Results: Immunohistochemical analysis for CK7, CK20, CDx2, PMS2,
MSH6 and was performed. Aberrant expression of the typical immunohis-
tochemical profile CK7/CK20/CDx2 was observed in 50% of the cases.
Highest sensitivity and specificity was established for CDx2 with 93% of
the cases demonstrating positive nuclear expression in the tumour cells. As
for the microsatellite status, 20 % of the examined colorectal cancers,
showed loss in expression for one or both of the mismatch repair proteins
- PMS2 and MSH6, which was associated with loss of the expression for
CK20 and CDx2 as well. Downhill correlation was estimated also between
CK20 expression and the presence of mutation in the gene for KRAS.
Conclusion: Our results may support the heterogeneity of colorectal
carcinoma. Statistically significant correlation was established be-
tween the expression of CK20 and CDX2 and MSI- and KRAS mu-
tant colorectal cancers. This may lead to application of immunohis-
tochemical screening panel for selection of patients with colorectal
carcinoma for genetic testing. Further studies on larger cohorts cor-
relating different immunohistochemical profiles to molecular sub-
types of CRC are needed for better understanding of pathogenesis
and behaviour of colorectal carcinoma.

Multiple primary malignant neoplasms in patients with colon cancer:
about 3 cases
M. Triki*, I. Saguem, L. Jaidane, M. Mellouli, S. Charfi, T. Boudawara,
M. Bouhamed
*Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Although very uncommon, multiple primary
malignant neoplasms (MPMN) are becoming an increasingly popular
subject in medical literature. Our aim is to describe clinicopathological
characteristics of MPMN in patients with colon cancer and to discuss
possible physiopathological mechanisms of these associations.
Methods: We report 3 rare cases of MPMN in patients with colon cancer
diagnosed in the pathology department of Sfax’s university hospital in
Tunisia. Clinicopathological data of these three cases as well as the out-
come were retrospectively reviewed.
Results: All three patients were females aged respectively 63, 72 and 78
years. All of them had a well differentiated colon adenocarcinoma asso-
ciated respectively with a papillary adenocarcinoma of the lung, a gastro-
intestinal stromal tumour (GIST) of the stomach and a hight grade serous
cystadenocarcinoma of the ovaries. The first patient developed a
metachronous pulmonary cancer, which was discovered during imaging
follow-up, after 3 years. The other patients had synchronous tumours.
The GIST was detected by computed tomography scan while attempting
to stage the patient's colon cancer. The ovarian tumours were discovered
incidentally during the surgery of the colon tumour. All patients received
appropriate treatment without complications.
Conclusion: The incidence of MMPN has gradually increased.
According to the literature, 5% of colon cancer patients have an additional
primary cancer. Multiple factors may contribute to the carcinogenesis of
MMPN. Genetic factors like defects in DNA mismatch repair may be one
of the major causes. Hence, it is important to consider the possibility of a
second primary tumour in a patient with a diagnosed colon tumour, and
not only consider disease recurrence. In this setting, genome-wide asso-
ciation studies are recommended.

Kaposi Sarcoma localised in gastric mucosa: and a rare case that
should be kept in mind!
E. Taştekin, C. Topuz, İ. Usta*
*Department of Pathology, Trakya University, School of Medicine,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a vascular neoplasm
caused by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) and it tends to be indolent but
may be locally aggressive. Skin is predominant site but may also affect
lymph nodes, visceral organs or rarely mucosal tissue.
Methods: A 39-year-old male patient admitted to gastroenterology clinic
with mild abdominal pain and nausea. An petechiae and erythematous
indurated lesion was detected on corpus mucosa with endoscopic exam-
ination. Multiple mucosal biopsies were evaluated in our pathology
laboratory.
Results: Histopathologically, revealed a lesion with a diameter of 2 mm
composed more extensive, compressed, slit-like vascular channels infil-
trating lamina propria of gastric mucosa. There was visible intracellular
and extracellular hyaline globules and they stain PAS positive. The en-
dothelial proliferation was monomorphic, there was not significant nu-
clear atypia or increased mitotic activity. Lesion was shown positive
rection with CD31, CD34, HHV8 antibodies. Ki67 proliferation index
was 5%. Chronic gastritis and parietal cell hyperplasia was detected in
around the lesion. We call the clinician based on these findings and
asked for detailed information about patient. We learned that the patient
was HIV positive and was diagnosed with dermal KS 2 years ago.
Conclusion: Gastric mucosa biopsies are frequently encountered biop-
sies in our daily routine work. While evaluate these biopsies we must not
overlook lesions with slight signs and extremely rare in this localisation.
Before diagnosing vascular-rich areas as inflammation and granulation
tissue, we should consider vascular pathologies.

Combined goblet cell adenocarcinoma and low grade appendiceal
mucinous neoplasm in the vermiform appendix: a case report
J. Uyboco*, M. Bonifacio, G.L. Pua, D. Ang
*St Luke's Medical Center - QC, Philippines
Background & objectives: We report a rare case of a combined goblet
cell adenocarcinoma ("GCA") and low grade appendiceal mucinous neo-
plasm ("LAMN") arising in the vermiform appendix of 72-year-old fe-
male. To our knowledge, only ten other cases have been reported.
Methods: A 72-year-old female presented with severe acute right lower
quadrant abdominal pain and underwent laparoscopic appendectomy.
The appendix was serially sectioned, revealing a pinpoint lumen and
0.4 cm. thick wall, with a 0.5 cm. distended, mucus-filled area 1 cm. from
the line of resection, adjacent to a point of rupture. The entire specimen
was submitted for routine processing.
Results: Microscopically, two distinct tumour histotypes were identified.
The 10mm. GCA was composed of composed of goblet-like cells in
tubules and crypts, accompanied by granular eosinophilic neuroendocrine
cells in nests, infiltrating from the submucosa into the muscularis propria.
The GCA cells stained positively for chromogranin A and synaptophysin
and had a low Ki-67 activity level (2.8%). The 6mm. LAMN was com-
posed of a single layer of low grade mucinous columnar cells forming
Virchows Arch
cystic spaces filled with basophilic mucin, surrounded by fibrosis, with
areas of paucicellular mucin dissecting up to the mesoappendix. The
LAMN cells were negative for chromogranin A and synaptophysin.
The proximal line of resection was negative for both tumours.
Conclusion: GCAs and LAMNs are among the many appendiceal lesions
that may present as acute appendicitis or be incidental findings. Thorough
gross and microscopic examination of all appendectomy specimens should
be performed to identify these and other appendiceal tumours. The origin
and the possible relationship of GCAs and LAMNs is debated. They have
different molecular characteristics (Wnt-signaling pathway mutations in
GCA, KRAS and GNAS mutations in LAMN) however, some evidence
supports a common stem cell origin of both tumours.

Colorectal adenocarcinoma with trophoblastic differentiation: a case
report and review of the literature

Camacho, M. Cebollero Presmanes, M.I. Peligros Gómez, M. Garcia
Martos
*Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Spain
Background & objectives: Extragenital nongestational malignancy of
trophoblastic tissue is very aggressive and rare. There are only 32 cases of
colon choriocarcinoma and trophoblastic differentiation in colorectal neo-
plasms reported in the literature. We present the only one reported in our
Hospital`s archives.
Methods: A 40-year-old woman with long-term inflammatory bowel
disease. During her last outbreak, high serum level human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) (243970 UI/L at diagnosis) was detected.
Colonoscopy revealed ileocecal valve stenosis and biopsy was per-
formed. A gynaecological study was requested. Radiological studies
showed hepatic lesions.
Results: Ileocecal valve biopsy revealed poorly differentiated adenocar-
cinoma infiltrating the mucosa, with negative endometrial biopsy and
hepatic lesions compatible with choriocarcinoma. Surgical resection
(right hemicolectomy) was performed and was diagnosed as poorly dif-
ferentiated adenocarcinoma with trophoblastic differentiation.
Inmunoprofile was concordant: caudal type homeobox-2 (CDX2) +,
cytokeratin 20 (CK20) + and hCG +. No microsatellite instability or
molecular alterations were detected. The patient is currently undergoing
oncological treatment against both tumoral components. Serum hCG
levels fall significantly (under 20.000 UI/L) but never reached negative
levels. Metastatic hepatic lesions are growing slowly. At this time, the
patient has relative clinical stability.
Conclusion: According to the literature about malignant neoplasms with
trophoblastic differentiation, the clinical course is being aggressive.
Although there is no standardized therapeutic management for these rare
tumours, the literature reported the clinical importance of choriocarcinoma
targeted regimen for prognosis. Nevertheless, further studies are needed.

Yange-Zambrano, M. Novell-Grau, M.d.M. del Barrio-Molina
*Department of Pathology, Mateu Orfila Hospital, IB-Salut, Maó
(Menorca), Spain
Background & objectives: The objective of this study is to know the
incidence of malignant lesions found in haemorrhoidectomy specimens,
which were not clinically suspected.
Methods: We carried out five-years retrospective study of haemor-
rhoidectomy specimens collected of the Mateu Orfila Hospital
(Menorca), Spain. All samples coded as “haemorrhoidectomy” and/or
“haemorrhoid” between 2015 and 2020, were selected from the
Pathology Department database. Clinicopathological and demographic
variables were collected from the electronic clinical records.
Results: 320 specimens from 181 men and 139 women, were analysed.
The mean age was 44 years (range 20-84 years). Relevant data were
identified in 7 specimens (2%), the rest were normal. Incidental findings
were: 1.-Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia (AIN) II-III; 2.-Neuroendocrine
Tumour (NET) poorly differentiated; 3.-Adenocarcinoma (AD) well-
differentiated (G1) and AIN-II; 4.-AIN-II; 5.-AIN I-II; 6.-Malignant
Melanoma (MM); 7.-Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) and AIN-III.
The resection margins were positive in two cases, negative in one and
could not be determined in four cases. The cases that only presented AIN
have followed clinical control; the SCC received QT-RDT, currently with
no recurrence. NET and MM cases were treated at another centre.
Conclusion: The haemorrhoids are defined as “symptomatic enlarge-
ment, displacement of anal cushions”. Its prevalence is estimated at
4.4% (up to 13-20%). The incidental findings of malignant lesions found
in the haemorrhoidectomy specimens are rare. In our study the incidence
was 2.18%. We consider that the resection edges should be stained when-
ever possible and include a good representation of the material sent from
the haemorrhoidectomy specimens, in order to provide as much patho-
logical information as possible.

A case report of an EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer of the
Caecum occurring with neuroendocrine tumour. Interesting novel
collision tumours
S. Bakhiet*, N. Duhli, E. Hardy, A. Elhag, J. Cooke, G. Solon, R.N.
Tiam, H. Ali
*Hull University Hospital, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer
(EBVMCU) is a rare B-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasm associating
mostly with immunosuppression either primary or iatrogenic. EBVMCU
was first described by Dojcinov in 2010(1) and first recognized by the
WHO classification in 2016 as a distinct clinicopathological entity(2).
Methods: An 89-year-old male presented acutely with clinical features
suggestive of intestinal obstruction. Radiological imaging revealed an
obstructing caecal neoplasm with possible involvement of the ileal mesen-
tery. A right hemicolectomy was performed. Intraoperatively, there was
bowel adhesion, but no perforation seen. The patient was not known to
have any past history of immunosuppression or was immunocompromised.
Results: Histology showed a 55mm well-differentiated neuroendocrine cae-
cal tumour (NET), grade 1 (Ki67<1%) (pT4) with multiple tumour deposits,
lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion and nodal metastasis (pN1). In
addition, a juxtaposed shallow mucosal ulcer (11mm) was identified with
underlying submucosal anaplastic neoplasm comprising polymorphous pro-
liferation of atypical cells with occasional multinucleated and Reed-Sternberg
(HRS)-like cells noted. The anaplastic cells were entirely negative for a wide
range of epithelial, melanoma and muscle markers but were positive for
Vimentin, IRF4, LMP-1, PAX-5, CD30 and CD2. Molecular studies did
not reveal gene amplification. The post-operative scan did not reveal systemic
lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Given the patient’s age, both
EBVMCU and the NET were treated conservatively.
Conclusion: EBVMCU is an EBV-driven pathology that may rarely
present with intestinal obstruction3.
EBVMCU may represent a diagnostic challenge as it histologically re-
sembles other EBV-related malignant lymphoproliferative disorder4.
This is the first case report of EBVMCU with associated NET which may
be a cause of immunosuppression alongside the old age in our case.
Virchows Arch
Radiopathological correlation and MDT discussion is crucial for optimal
evaluation and accurate classification.
EBVMCU on its own has excellent prognosis but in this case, the prog-
nosis will be determined by the NET.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine microadenomatosis in the setting of am-
pullary ductal adenocarcinoma
R. Cornea*, O.C. Vita, A. Jurescu, R. Barna, A. Dema
*Department of Pathology, “Victor Babes” University of Medicine and
Pharmacy Timisoara; Department of Pathology, Emergency County
Hospital Timisoara, Romania
Background & objectives: Pancreatic neuroendocrine microadenoma
(PNEMA) is a benign, typically non-functioning, nodular endocrine pro-
liferation, less than 5mm in diameter. Multiple lesions are designated
microadenomatosis. It is often discovered incidentally, and it is unknown
if may progress to clinically relevant neuroendocrine tumours.
Methods: We present the case of a 58-year-old male, admitted in the
Timisoara Clinical County Hospital with obstructive jaundice. He was re-
ferred to Surgery Department, where an exploratory laparotomy was per-
formed that identified a tumour comprising the duodenum, the distal
choledochus and the head of the pancreas. A cephalic duodeno-
pancreatectomy was performed, the excised biopsy being sent to the
Pathology Department.
Results: Macroscopically, an infiltrative tumour was identified with the
epicentre in the ampullary area, which affects the ampullary area, the head
of the pancreas, the common bile duct, the pancreatic duct, as well as the
duodenal wall. Histologically, an ampullary ductal adenocarcinoma of
the bilio-pancreatic type was diagnosed. At the level of the remaining
pancreatic tissue were observed several nodular neuroendocrine cell pro-
liferations, with diameter of 0.8-1,2mm. They were noncapsulated, with
organoid growth, trabecular and pseudoglandular architectural pattern,
vascular stroma, and without chronic pancreatitis background. The pro-
liferating cells are intensely positive for synaptophysin, with a Ki67 index
less than 1%. Thus, the diagnosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine
microadenomatosis was made.
Conclusion: Due to small size, PNEMAs are usually discovered during
life in relation to other pancreatic or systemic conditions. There are reported
cases in association with MEN1 syndrome, von Hippell Lindau syndrome,
pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, duodenal adenocar-
cinoma, and ectopic pancreatic tissue. To our knowledge, this is the first
case which described the occurrence of neuroendocrine microadenomatosis
in combination with ampullary ductal adenocarcinoma.

Primary hepatic marginal zone lymphoma: a case report
S. Pappa, A. Dimitriadi*, F. Antoniadou, A. Kostopoulou, G. Leveta, G.
Gkortzolidis, C. Zorzos, G. Kakiopoulos
*"G. Gennimatas" General Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue accounts 7-8% of newly diagnosed
lymphomas. Other sites of occurrence include lung, salivary gland, ocular
adnexa, skin and thyroid. However, lymphoma in the liver as the primary
site is extremely rare.
Methods: A 70-year-old male patient was referred for a liver mass on
ultrasonography from a medical check up at another hospital. The patient
was seronegative for hepatitis B, C and HIV. MRI revealed a low density
mass measuring 2.2 cm and an FNB was performed.
Results: Microscopically, nodular and mostly diffuse infiltration of lym-
phocytes was observed. The lymphocytes were small-to-intermediate size
and some of them had centrocyte-like morphology. Lymphoepithelial
lesions were present in some bile ducts. Tumour cells express B-cell-
associated antigens, such as CD20, CD79a and PanB and are negative
for CD3, CD5, CD10, CD23, DBA-44, bcl6, CyclinD1. There are poly-
clonal for κ and λ light chains. The Ki67 (MIB1) labelling index is 1%.
All these results are compatible with a low-grade B-cell lymphoma and
especially a marginal zone lymphoma.
Conclusion: Most of the primary hepatic MALT lymphoma cases occur
in elderly people and were present with incidentally detected liver masses
without specific symptoms. Diagnosis of this condition is important, be-
cause the disease is treatable.

Tumoral and peritumoral histopathological analysis in hepatocellu-
lar carcinoma after locoregional therapy
J. Espírito Santo*, A. Ladeirinha, A. Alarcão, L. Neves, E. Strelet, M.
Campos, M. Reis, R. Santos, L. Carvalho
*Adult Liver Transplantation Unit, Coimbra Hospital and Universitary
Centre, Portugal
Background & objectives: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and trans-
catheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) are locoregional therapies
(LRT) used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). LRT may change
tumours phenotype, where histopathological features of apoptosis/
proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) have been
reported.
Methods: Fifteen patients treated with preoperative LRT (TACE n = 12;
RFA n = 2; RFA+TACE n = 1) concerning 29 HCCs were studied; 57
cases of HCC surgically treated without LRT were analysed as controls.
WHO 2019 histopathological criteria, proliferation/apoptotic biomarkers
(Ki67, p53) and mesenchymal biomarkers (alpha-smooth muscle actin
(ASMA), vimentin) expression was evaluated in tumour and peritumoral
tissues.
Results: Ki67 was relevant in 6 HCCs; 4 cases had peritumoral hepatocytes
expressingKi67and3showedtumoral andperitumoral immunoexpression.
Four HCCs expressed p53 and 2 had positive p53 hepatocytes surround-
ing the tumour; 2 cases displayed both biomarkers. Two cases showed
ASMA positive tumour cells and 13 HCCs ASMA positive tumour stro-
ma cells. Peritumoral hepatocytes were ASMA positive in 11 HCCs and
26 displayed ASMA positivity in the extracellular matrix (ECM) sur-
rounding the tumour. Seven HCCs showed vimentin in tumour cells
cytoplasm and 13 cases had positive predominant stroma cells.
Vimentin in peritumoral hepatocytes of 14 HCCs was concomitant with
immunoexpression in the ECM surrounding the tumour of 27 cases.
Conclusion: LRT may have an impact on the proliferative phenotype of
HCC and may trigger EMT features, either inducing a higher malignant
potential or uncovering the complex heterogeneity of these tumours. An
association between LRT, Ki67 and p53 expression in tumour cells and
ASMA expression in peritumoral hepatocytes seems relevant. These re-
sults need further confirmation as dependent serological markers may
acquire relevant role in liquid biopsy.

*Pathology Department, Rabta Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Vascular lesions associated with chronic
viral hepatitis B (CVHB) have been reported as predictors of disease
progression.
The aim of the study was to determine the CD34 score in CVHB and its
correlation with inflammatory activity and fibrosis stage.
Methods: Study was retrospective on 30 cases of CVHB confirmed by
biopsy over 5 years (2013-2018). CD34 score was 1: positive cells ≤10%
Virchows Arch
of sinusoids; 2: positive cells > 10% and ≤30% of sinusoids; 3: positive
cells > 30% of sinusoids. For activity and fibrosis, the Metavir score was
used. In statistical analysis, the significance level was 0.05.
Results: Sinusoidal aberrant expression of CD34 was detected in all
cases.
In portal areas, CD34 score 3 was the most frequent score, found mainly
in inflammatory activity A2 (14 cases) and in fibrosis stage F2 (8 cases).
In central areas, CD34 score 1 was the most frequent score, found mainly
in inflammatory activity A2 (12 cases) and in fibrosis stage F1 (9 cases).
Analytic study showed that activity and fibrosis were significantly asso-
ciated with CD34 score in the periportal zones with respectively p=0.018
and 0.01.
Conclusion: Vascular changes observed in chronic hepatitis involve an-
giogenesis lesions. It is characterized by a modification of the phenotype
of endothelial cells inducing sinusoid capillarization. During this process,
endothelial cells show aberrant expression endothelial markers such as
CD34. In our series, we found a significant association between CD34
score, hepatitis activity and the stage of fibrosis in portal areas. These
lesions usually seen in cirrhosis and portal hypertension, occur in CVHB
and represent a sign of progression of the disease.

X. Grammatoglou*, D. Grigoropoulou, N. Poulianitis, A. Kostopoulou,
A. Syka, N. Varsamidakis, G. Kakiopoulos
*General Hospital of Athens "G. Gennimatas", Department of Pathology,
Greece
Background & objectives: Ciliated cysts are rare congenital anomalies
that develop from the anterior primitive intestine, most commonly iden-
tified in segment IV of the liver. Their location in the gallbladder is
exceptional rare.
Methods: We report a case of a 54-year-old woman suffering of upper
right quadrant pain two years ago. Ultrasound showed a lesion near the
fundus of the gallbladder. The patient underwent cholecystectomy via a
right subcostal excision. The lesion was also removed.
Results: We received a gallbladder and a separate 5cm cystic lesion. The
content of the cyst was a mucoid fluid and there was no communication
between the cyst and the gallbladder lumen. Microscopically there was a
quite thin fibromuscular wall covered by ciliated pseudostratified epithe-
lium containing some goblet cells. Immunohistochemistry showed that
the epithelial lining was ker7 positive, but ker20 and CDX2 negative. A
diagnosis of ciliated forgut cyst was established.
Conclusion: Ciliated congenital cyst developing from the foregut is a rare
diagnostic entity that should be considered in the differential diagnosis for
cystic lesions located infra diaphragmatically in conjunction with liver or
gallbladder.

Intrahepatic splenosis on liver cirrhosis
F. Leiva-Cepas*, M.J. Gálvez-Medina, C.M. Villar Pastor, R. Ortega
Salas
*University Hospital "Reina Sofía", Spain
Background & objectives: Intrahepatic splenosis (IS) is the autotrans-
plantation of splenic tissue in a heterotopic location, after spleen´s surgery
or trauma. It is a rare finding located anywhere in the abdominal cavity.
We present a case of IS on liver cirrhosis.
Methods: The case of a 64-year-old man with active alcoholism and
alcoholic liver disease with oesophageal varices is presented.
Splenectomised in 2012 after a traffic accident. In 2021, in the follow-
up of cirrhosis, a 20 x 27mm liver lesion in segment V was detected by
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compatible with hepatocarcinoma.
Hepatic resection of the LOE was indicated by segmentectomy.
Results: Macroscopically, splenosis is usually a smooth, shiny, wall-
coloured, homogeneous tissue that is difficult to distinguish from an adeno-
ma and, in the case of abundant vascularization, from a hepatic
haemangioma. Microscopically, H-E staining revealed sinusoidal structures
andlymphoidtissuehyperplasia.Acapsuleseparatingthespleentissuefrom
liver tissue could be clearly detected. Immunohistochemistry staining
showed positivity for CD3/CD20, and the expression of the Ki-67 antigen
was quite limited. The polyclonal nature of the lymphocytes and the low
proliferation activity further confirmed the benign characteristic of the mass.
Conclusion: It is a coincidental finding, but it is important to differentiate
it from the ectopic spleen, a more frequent congenital entity with a loca-
tion close to the splenic hilum, it presents capsule and direct vasculariza-
tion of some splenic arterial branch, and the differential diagnosis must
include focal hepatic lesions with the immunohistochemical battery typ-
ical of the most representative tumours.

Primary Hepatic Perivascular Epithelioid Tumour (PEComa): a case
report
R.D.P. Lopez-Panqueva*, K. Verjel-Avila, J. Andrade-Restrepo, A.
Vera, R.E. Andrade Perez
*Department of Pathology and Laboratories, Fundación Santa Fe de
Bogotá/Universidad de Los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia
Background & objectives: Perivascular Epithelioid Tumours
(PEComas) are predominantly present in uterine or gastric tissues. Liver
presentations are uncommon and primary hepatic presentations are ex-
tremely rare. We reported a primary perivascular epithelioid tumour
(PEComa) of the liver with uncertain malignant potential.
Methods: A 31-year-old female patient presented with a one-month
history of abdominal pain and bilious emesis. She had a previous
diagnosis of hepatic abscess. Abdominal MR reported a lesion, sug-
gestive of hepatic adenoma. The surgical specimen of the hepatecto-
my had a solid, circumscribed mass, with scarce necrosis, and a
larger diameter of 4.5 cm.
Results: Histopathologic studies showed necrosis, epithelioid and spindle
cells, moderate nuclear atypia and cells with clear cytoplasms. Infiltrative
sinusoidal patterns spread to the parenchyma and resection margins.
Mitotic figures were >1x50 HPF. Immunohistochemical studies showed
reactivity to CD31-CD34 in endothelium, MelanA, HMB-45, Caldesmon
and SMA, and 20% of KI67 expression. Necrosis, mitosis >1x50 HPF,
and infiltrative growth, indicates a perivascular epithelioid tumour
(PEComa) of the liver with high risk of malignant behaviour. Imaging
extension studies were negative for additional neoplastic lesions.
Conclusion: Careful and complete histologic and immunohistochemical
study is required due to how unusual the tumour is. The key of the
PEComa diagnosis is the co-expression of melanocytic and muscle
markers. This diagnosis is usually performed after hepatectomy, the most
common management strategy. Because of the uncertain prognosis and
behaviour of hepatic PEComas, long term following and valid stratifica-
tion risk scales are needed. This case highlights the lack of information
and studies about diagnosis, management and prognosis of hepatic
PEComas.

Solitary fibrous tumour of the pancreas: a rare and sneaky diagnosis
F.J. Madureira Moreira*, I. Gullo, J. Lopes, J. Pacheco, P. Rodrigues-
Pereira
*Centro Hospitalar Universitário, Portugal
Background & objectives: Solitary fibrous tumour (SFT), first described
as a pleural lesion, may arise at any anatomical location, including the
gastrointestinal tract and the pancreato-biliary system. We report a rare
case of SFT of the pancreas.
Virchows Arch
Methods: A 69-year-old man was referred to our tertiary hospital due to a
solitary, solid pancreatic mass in the corpus of the pancreas, detected by
routine magnetic resonance imaging. He had a prostate adenocarcinoma
at the age of 51, treated by radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy,
radiation and androgen deprivation therapy.
Results: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy was
interpreted as nondiagnostic (Papanicolaou System: Category I). The patient
underwent distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy. Grossly, the lesion was
whitish, well circumscribed and 3,0x2,4x1,9cm in size. Microscopically, the
tumour had an expensive growth pattern and was constituted by uniform,
bland, spindle cells arranged in a “patternless pattern” accompanied by the
deposition of a hyalinised collagen and prominent vascular network of
branching blood vessels. Cellularity was variable. Entrapped pancreatic pa-
renchyma, intimately admixed within the tumour cells, was present. No rel-
evant cytological atypia, necrosis or mitotic figures were identified.
Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells showed STAT6, CD34, BCL-2
and CD99 immunoreactivity. The patient is well four months after surgery.
Conclusion: Despite rare, pathologists should considered SFT in the
differential diagnoses of mesenchymal tumours detected in the pancreas.

Undifferentiated carcinoma with osteoclastlike giant cells of the pan-
creas: 2 case reports of a rare tumour
Z. Nfikha*, S. Chaieb, A. Baccouch, T. Tlili, S. Mestiri, S. Hmissa, M.
Mokni
*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma with
osteoclast-like giant cells(UPCOC) is an uncommon pancreatic neoplasm
that comprises less than1%of all exocrine pancreatic tumours. It is con-
sidered a subtype of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, in the latest
WHO classification. It has a well-defined histogenesis.
Methods: We report two cases of UPCOC diagnosed in the Pathology
Department of Farhat Hached Hospital (Sousse, Tunisia). The first patient
is a 60years male who presented with a pancreas body mass discovered
on imaging. The second one is a 71years female who presented with
epigastralgia and a mass involving the stomach wall, the spleen and the
tail of the pancreas on imaging.
Results: The first patient underwent distal splenopancreatectomy with
recutting of the head of the pancreas and the second had a monobloc
removal of the mass, the spleen, the tail of the pancreas and a part of the
gastric wall. At gross examination, both masses showed a multiloculated,
solid-cystic cut surface with areas of necrotic and haemorrhagic changes.
Histological examination showed an undifferentiated proliferation, made of
large, rounded, polygonal, elongated, fusiform and giant multinucleated
osteoclast like cells. The stroma showed focal bone differentiation in the
first case while an associated moderately differentiated ductal adenocarci-
noma was seen in the second case. We retained the diagnosis of undiffer-
entiated osteoclastic giant cell carcinoma of the pancreas.
Conclusion: UPCOC is very rare. It often occurs around the sixth decade.
Histological study reveals two distinct cell populations. The first one is
made of mononuclear, spindle-shaped, atypical cells. The second cell
population is made of osteoclastic-like giant cells. Osteoid or cartilagi-
nous formations may be found. The presence of a codon 12 mutation in
the KRAS gene suggests that this component derives from pancreatic
ductal cells. The treatment is similar to that of classical ductal adenocar-
cinoma, with which UPCOC shares a poor prognosis.

A case of an IgG4-related disease affecting extrahepatic and
intrahepatic bile ducts and the kidney with a concurrent renal cell
carcinoma, clinically masquerading as primary cholangiocarcinoma
of the biliary tree with renal metastases
M. Nifora, D. Tiniakos, D. Bouklas, K. Iliakopoulos, N. Novkovic, S.
Stasinopoulou, M. Papazian*
*Aretaieion University Hospital of Athens, Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: Immunoglobulin-G4(IgG4) related disease is
a systemic fibroinflammatory nosological entity that can affect almost
any organ. We hereby present a case of IgG4-related sclerosing
cholangitis of the biliary tree and IgG4-related disease of the left kidney
with a concurrent clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma(CCRCC).
Methods: A 76-year-old male presented with jaundice. The CT&MRI
analysis demonstrated an obstructive 1,7cm lesion of the proximal bile-
duct, dilated intrahepatic bile-ducts & multiple tumoral-lesions in segments
III,IV and V of the liver along with a well-circumscribed 4cm kidney
tumour. These findings were consistent with cholangiocarcinoma of the
biliary-tree. A wedge-resection of liver-segment V, left lateral hepatectomy
with excision of the common bile duct+cholecystectomy&partial left ne-
phrectomy were performed.
Results: During gross inspection of the liver, multiple firm nodules were
recognised. The bile duct & gallbladder wall were thickened & filled with
haemorrhagic-necrotic debris. At the left kidney a firm, solid and partially
cystic lesion was observed. Microscopic examination of the liver, gallblad-
der & bile duct showedsclerosingcholangitis, withplexiform fibrosis, oblit-
erative phlebitis & a dense inflammatory infiltrate with an IgG4+/IgG+
plasma-cellratioof>60%.Theintrahepatic noduleshadhistologicalfeatures
of inflammatory pseudotumors. Similar findings of tubulointerstitial nephri-
tis with dense inflammatory infiltrate & sclerosing stroma were observed in
thekidney,withanIgG4+/IgG+plasma-cellratioof>70%.Therenalinflam-
matory pseudotumor engulfed a 2,8cm cystic-haemorrhagic lesion that was
proventobea CD10(+)/Vimentin(+)/Ck7(-) grade 1CCRCC.Thecasewas
signedout asIgG4-relateddiseaseinvolvingtheliver/ bileduct /gallbladder
& kidney, along with a grade 1 CCRCC.
Conclusion: IgG4-related disease is a clinical entity that has become
more common during the last decade due to increased clinical awareness.
Its pathophysiology is not clearly understood, though the main theories
involve autoimmunity and allergic conditions.
Proper clinical correlation and serological analysis is crucial to the pa-
thologist, especially during intraoperative consultation in order to avoid
overdiagnosis. In the absence of clinical information, frozen section anal-
ysis was inconclusive in our case.
Reports of renal IgG4-related disease with concurrent renal cell carcino-
ma are extremely rare in the literature.

Metastasic carcinoid lung tumour in the liver, 26 years of experience
Y. Rodriguez*, I. Fernández, C. Fuertes, C. Cerezo, M. Bronte, I. Amat
Villegas, A. Panizo
*Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: Carcinoid tumour (CT) is a rare neuroendo-
crine epithelial neoplasia that represents less than 1% of lung cancers and
rarely metastasizes. The purpose of our work is to provide a series of 13
cases of CT with liver metastases.
Methods: A review of BAG, PAFF and liver biopsies diagnosed in our
centre from January 1995 to January 2021 was performed, selecting those
with a diagnosis of metastases from pulmonary CT. Some of the clinical,
histopathological (study with H-E, presence of necrosis and mitosis
count) and immunohistochemical characteristics (Chromogranin,
Synaptophysin, CD56, INSM1 and Ki67) are described.
Results: Thirteen patients with CT liver metastases were identified; 7
women (54%), 46% smokers (6 patients), with a mean age of 68 years
at diagnosis of metastasis (range 43-81). 69% (9 patients) had stage IV
disease at diagnosis. During evolution, 54% (7 cases) presented metasta-
ses in other locations (brain 15%, bone-soft tissue 31%, pancreas 8%). In
the histological diagnosis, 23% were atypical CT, of which 8% presented
necrosis. 85% had <2 mitoses per mm2. All cases showed immunoreac-
tivity for at least two neuroendocrine markers. Ki67 presented a mean of
8% (Range 1-19%), being 46% ≥10%.
Virchows Arch
Conclusion: The most frequent way of presentation of lung CT was:
stage IV, with metastatic liver disease and predominance in non-
smoking women over 60 years of age. In almost half of the cases, bone,
brain or pancreatic involvement was also observed. The typical CT was
the most frequent subtype in our series, observing a Ki67 of between 1
and 19%. 67% of atypical CT were histologically diagnosed by the pres-
ence of ≥2 mitoses per mm2.

Case report series of undifferentiated carcinoma with osteoclast-like
cells of the pancreas at the Basurto University Hospital over the last
fifteen years
J. Rossello*, N. Arbide, L. Ortega, A. Tarin, A. Moreno, M. Vázquez, C.
Etxezarraga
*Basurtuko Ospitalea, Spain
Background & objectives: Undifferentiated carcinoma with
osteoclast-like cells of the pancreas has been reported to be less
than 1% of pancreas malignancies. Although its histology is typi-
cal, due to its rarity, sufficient clinical data is not available and its
prognosis remains unclear.
Methods: Systematic research of undifferentiated carcinoma with
osteoclast-like giant cells of the pancreas from the Basurto
University Hospital database over the last fifteen years. Data re-
garding cytological diagnostic approach, clinical aspects, and prog-
nosis after surgical resection was collected. Moreover, immunohis-
tochemical profiling of the histiocytic-like and epithelioid cellular
components was performed for further characterization.
Results: Two undifferentiated carcinomas with osteoclast-like cells
of the pancreas cases were identified in our database from 2006 to
2021, according to diagnostic criteria from World Health
Organization (WHO). The most relevant cytological, histological
and immunohistochemical profiles were analysed and correlation
with previous case reports series described on the literature was
performed.
Our analysis demonstrated the impact of a cytological approach by fine-
needle aspiration following imaging techniques, in the diagnosis of this
neoplasm before surgical procedure.
Conclusion: Undifferentiated carcinoma with osteoclast-like cells of the
pancreas is an uncommon malignancy, with few reports on the literature
over the last fifteen years, and none in Spain. Due to the lack of data avail-
able, there is no consensus on diagnostic procedure, therapeutics and prog-
nosis. We would suggest that a fine-needle aspiration provides accurate
information and contributes to a radiologicallyassisted diagnostic approach.

A 14-year experience in pathological diagnosis of liver tumours using
core needle biopsy
A. Slovac*, A. Vaduva, R. Barna, R. Cirpean, O.C. Vita, A. Jurescu, M.
Cornianu
*Department of Pathology, Emergency County Hospital "Pius Brinzeu"
Timisoara, Romania
Background & objectives: Core biopsy and histopathological examina-
tion are essential for establishing the nature of primary liver tumours, as
well as of metastases of unknown origin. This study aimed to investigate
the agreement between initial clinical diagnosis and pathological exami-
nation of core biopsies.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study on 243 patients examined
at the Emergency County Hospital Timisoara, Romania, diagnosed by
core biopsy between 2002 and 2016. We examined the percentage of
cases for which the pathological examination was diagnostic, the propor-
tion of malignant and benign tumours. To evaluate the agreement be-
tween the clinical diagnosis and the pathology report, Cohen’s kappa
was used.
Results: A definite pathological diagnosis was set for 88% of the cases
(82.8% malignant and 17.2% benign tumours), while for the remaining
12%, the result was inconclusive. Primary malignant tumours were iden-
tified in 23% of the cases, the rest being metastatic. The origin of the
metastases was identified in 54.3% of the cases. A moderate agreement
between the clinical diagnosis and pathology report was identified for
hepatocellular carcinomas (Cohen’s kappa = 0.48) and liver metastases
(Cohen’s kappa = 0.6).
Conclusion: For the evaluation of liver tumours, core biopsy is a diag-
nostic tool with moderate agreement between initial clinical diagnosis and
pathological report, both for hepatocellular carcinomas and liver
metastases.

Synovial sarcoma of the pancreas in a childhood leukaemia survivor
S. Stasinopoulou*, Z. Tsakiraki, V. Panteleon, D. Bouklas, M. Papazian,
E. Stoupi, K. Bramis, M. Konstadoulakis, G. Agrogiannis, P. Foukas, D.
Tiniakos
*Aretaieion University Hospital of Athens, Pathology Department,
Greece
Background & objectives: Pancreatic synovial sarcoma (SS) is very rare
with only one primary and five secondary tumours reported to date.
Development of a second malignant neoplasm in survivors of childhood
leukaemia is rare (1%) and only 3-5% are sarcomas.
Methods: A 40-year-old man with a history of childhood acute lympho-
blastic leukaemia presented with acute abdomen. Imaging showed a rup-
tured cystic tumour attached to the pancreatic body/tail and no tumours
elsewhere. A distal pancreatectomy was performed. Grossly, the tumour
was mainly extra pancreatic and cystic (11.5 cm) with inner surface
micropapillary projections. A 2.4 cm solid area extended into the resected
pancreas.
Results: Histology showed a biphasic malignant neoplasm with a low
grade dysplastic papillary epithelial component lining the cystic cavity,
and a distinct solid, small cell, poorly differentiated component, with high
mitotic activity and Ki67 LI 80%, infiltrating the pancreas. Differential
diagnosis included a collision tumour composed of an intraductal papil-
lary mucinous neoplasm and a neuroendocrine carcinoma or extra skele-
tal Ewing sarcoma/PNET, and a cystic biphasic SS.
Immunohistochemistry supported the latter diagnosis (solid area positive
for vimentin, TLE1 , BCL2, CD56, rare pankeratin (pan-K) and cyst
epithelial lining positive for K20, K7, CDX2,EMA). Fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) showed a t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) translocation, typi-
cal of SS18-SSX1 gene fusion and characteristic of SS.
Conclusion: Biphasic SS diagnosis in unusual locations is extremely
difficult when the epithelial and sarcomatous components are not
intermingled. Immunohistochemistry with molecular confirmation is es-
sential for accurate diagnosis. The rarity of the SS location in our case
supports an extra pancreatic soft tissue neoplasm infiltrating the pancreas
rather than a primary pancreatic neoplasm. The known interaction of the
SS associated protein SYT with the acute leukaemia associated protein
AF10 may underlie the development of these two rare malignancies in the
same patient.

Extramedullary haematopoiesis in an adrenal cortical adenoma: a
case report
A. Ben Mabrouk*, A. Bdioui, W. Majdoub, E. Benammou, M. Krifa, L.
Lassoued, S. Hmissa
*Department of Pathology Sahloul Hospital, Tunisia
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Extramedullary haematopoiesis (EMH) is
the expansion and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells outside of the bone marrow. Adrenal location is very rare. We report
a case of adrenal cortical adenoma with extramedullary haematopoiesis in
patient without haematological disease.
Methods: We presented a 68-year-old woman who had no hematologic
abnormality, showing bilateral adrenal incidentaloma discovered inciden-
tally in abdominal CT scan. The two nodules were rounded with well
delineated borders, homogeneous and had clear separation from sur-
rounding structures. They were non-functional. However, the right adre-
nal nodule measured more than 3 cm. So an adrenalectomy was
performed.
Results: Grossly, we received an encapsulated nodule measuring 3.7cm.
It was extebede by the adrenal which measured 2cm. In cut, the lesion
was well circumscribed. It had an homogenous cut surface with yellow
colour. Microscopically, the tumour was well defined with an intact
capsule and it was made of islands of tumoral cells. These cells had
distinct borders and abundant foamy cytoplasm resembling to the normal
adrenal fasciculat. Mitoses were exceptional. There were no atypia, no
necrosis and no vascular invasion. In the stroma, we found some non-
cohesive aggregates of extramedullary haematopoiesis. The diagnosis of
adrenal cortical adenoma with EMH was made. The WEISS score was
estimated at 0.
Conclusion: The adrenal glands are the seat of a wide variety of diseases.
However, EMH in the adrenal is uncommon and it is thought to be a
compensatory, physiological mechanism that occurs during altered med-
ullary haematopoiesis like in hemoglobinopathies. In our case the patient
do not have any haemoglobinopathies. Many authors suggest the hypoth-
esis that adrenal gland has hematopoietic capacity during the foetal period
and EMH may develop from primitive rests in diseased condition, like in
our case.

Epidemiological characteristics of thyroid cancer in a Tunisian
universitary health care centre
M. Ben Thayer*, F. Khanchel, I. Helal, A. Hmidi, E. Ben Brahim, R.
Jouini, A. Chadli-Debbiche
*Department of Pathology, Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Thyroid carcinoma is the most common
endocrine malignancy. Its incidence rate has been increasing rapidly
around the world without great variability in epidemiopathological char-
acteristics throughout countries.
We aim to study epidemiological and pathological characteristics of TC
in our Tunisian population.
Methods: Our study included retrospectively all patients who underwent
surgery for TC in Habib Thameur’s hospital from 2017 to 2020.
Results: Our sample of 149 patients consisted of 11 men and 130 women
(87,2% ): a sex-ratio of 0,14, with an age ranging from 17 to 85 years and
a median of 46,60 ± 14.1years.
Carcinoma was in the right lobe in 59 cases (39.59%), in the left lobe in
53 cases (35.57%) and bilateral in 37 cases and multifocal in 40 cases.
Papillary carcinoma represented the most frequent histological type and was
diagnosed in 133 patients (89%), followed by Non-invasive follicular thy-
roid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (8 cases), oncocytic car-
cinoma (6), follicular carcinoma(5),poorly differentiated carcinoma (2
cases) and anaplasic carcinoma(1 case).Lymph node dissection was per-
formed in 71 cases. Node involvement was diagnosed in 26 cases (17,44%).
Conclusion: Our study noted a female predominance, a mean age of
46,60 years and a higher incidence in the third, fourth, and fifth decades
of life. Papillary carcinoma was the most common histological subtype.
These results are consistent with those of Tunisian, African and world
series. Worldwide, the Female/Male ratio for TC incidence varies from 2
to 12 (6,84 in our study) and the most frequent histological subtype is
papillary carcinoma in most of the series in the literature.

Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma accompanying with follicu-
lar variant papillary thyroid carcinoma: a case report
D. Betül*, N. Can, F. Öz Puyan, T.D. Yalta, İ. Usta, B.Y. Bülbül, A.
Sezer
*Trakya University Faculty of Medicine, Edirne, Turkey
Background & objectives: Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma; is a
rare type among thyroid carcinomas and its classification is controversial.
Its morphology stand between well-differentiated and undifferentiated
carcinomas. It is characterized by the solid/trabecular/insular growth pat-
tern on microscopy and the presence of distant metastases.
Methods: Lytic lesions are detected in lumbar MRI of the 66-year-old
patient that presented with leg pain. PET-CT and the histological exam-
ination of the lesion confirmed that the primary tumour is of thyroid
origin. An isoechoic nodule containing cystic areas is detected in the right
thyroid lobe on neck USG. Thyroid fine needle aspiration indicates fol-
licular neoplasia. Total thyroidectomy is performed.
Results: Histological examination of the lytic lesion detected in the iliac
canal revealed a follicular patterned tumour compatible with follicular
thyroid epithelial cell tumour via immunoexpression of TTF-1, thyro-
globulin, vimentin, pancytokeratin and PAX8. PET-CT exhibited malig-
nant thyroid mass. Thyroid fine needle aspiration diagnosed as follicular
neoplasia (Bethesda category IV). In the differential diagnosis of the
patient, tumours with a dominant follicular pattern with nuclear features
of papillary carcinoma were also included. After total thyroidectomy, the
patient was diagnosed with poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma asso-
ciated with well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma foci of follicular variant
papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Conclusion: Distant metastases of thyroid tumours are not always char-
acteristic of the primary tumour. Also, aspiration of poorly differentiated
thyroid carcinoma may present as follicular neoplasia. In this case, foci of
poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma with solid/trabecular/insular
growth pattern could be recognised by numerous sampling of the solid
nodul . Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma, can be found with well-
differentiated thyroid carcinoma foci in the same tumour, and a detailed
examination is required, especially in patients with distant metastasis.

Paediatric paragangliomas: what we should be aware of – about a case
S. Carralas Antunes*, C. Dahlstedt-Ferreira, J. da Cunha Oliveira, P.
Botelho, C. Luz, S. Franco, H. Vara Luiz, M.J. Brito
*Hospital Garcia de Orta, Portugal
Background & objectives: Paragangliomas are more frequent in middle-
age adults. 30% are hereditary, though almost all of paediatric-onset cases
are related to germline mutations. Mostly are found in association with
Succinate Dehydrogenase B (SDHB) subunit gene which is related to
higher malignization risk.
Methods: We present a case of a 14-year-old male, that was under inves-
tigation for intellectual developmental disorder and facial dysmorphism.
An array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) showed a mutation
in SDHB gene in 2017. In 2020, following the detection of elevated
urinary normetanephrine/noradrenaline, a Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT
was performed, revealing a lomboaortic expansive solid lesion, with so-
matostatin receptors overexpression. Tumourectomy was performed.
Results: Grossly, it was a solid, nodular tumour, that measured
4x3,5x2cm with soft consistency and homogeneously tan cut surface with
disperse haemorrhagic foci.
Microscopically, it showed a nested and trabecular proliferation of round
to oval cells, with abundant granular cytoplasm and chromatin. The im-
munohistochemical study supported the diagnosis of paraganglioma
[chromogranin A+, synaptophysin+, NSE+, CD56+, S100+
(sustentacular cells)].
Virchows Arch
It was graded according to The Grading System for Adrenal
Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma (GAPP) as moderately differen-
tiated (score 4) (low cellularity, capsular/vascular invasion present,
comedo-type necrosis absent, Ki67 mitotic rate > 3%).
The surgical margin was positive.
Conclusion: Paragangliomas in paediatric population are almost always
due to a germline mutation, being the ones in genes coding Succinate
Dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits collectively the most common cause of
hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma.
Even in the absence of a family history, genetic testing should be offered
for all paediatric patients with paragangliomas and their family.
Patients with SDHB mutation should maintain a lifelong, regular surveillance.

Challenge diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma with cervical
adenopathy: lymph-node metastasis or concomitant cervical tuber-
culous lymphadenitis
D. Chiba*, N. Abdessayed, Z. Nfikha, T. Zahmoul, B. Sriha, M. Mokni
*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, Sousse,
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Papillary carcinoma is by far the most com-
mon malignancy of the thyroid and accounts for 65-80%of thyroid can-
cers. Cervical adenopathy is common, often associated with or even re-
vealing the thyroid nodule. An extemporaneous-examination(EE) of
these cervical lymph-nodes is essential to eliminate a metastasis.
Methods: However, the per-operative-discovery of a tuberculous lymph-
adenitis may lead to a mismanagement of the surgery. The purpose of this
study is to discuss the rarity and diagnostic difficulties of the association
of cervical lymph-node tuberculosis with metastatic papillary thyroid
carcinoma. We report two cases of thyroid nodule associated with cervi-
cal adenopathy in two patients of unusual presentation.
Results: First patient was46-year-old woman, operated for a left-lobular-
nodule of the thyroid whose EE revealed thyroiditis. In view of the clinic-
biological findings, tuberculosis lymphadenitis was suspected and the proce-
dure was completed by a jugulo-carotid-lymphadenectomy. The final
histological-examination showed a multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma
with thyroid-granulomatous reaction.11 lymph-nodes received; all were free
of metastasis and only one contained necrotizing epithelioid and giganto-
cellular granulomas. The second patient was 27-years-old with a history of
lymph-node tuberculosis, in front of the discovery of a right thyroid nodule
associated with a cervical adenopathy. She underwent a cervical
adenomectomy which EE confirmed the tuberculous lymphadenitis. A sub-
sequent lobo-isthmectomy revealed on EE a papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Conclusion: The definitive-examination of the lymphadenectomy with
the totalization of thyroidectomy concluded to a papillary thyroid carci-
noma with 5-metastatic lymph-nodes on the 37-received which are all
seats of caseo-follicular lymph-node tuberculosis.
the double cervical localization of a tuberculosis and a metastasis of a
papillary thyroid carcinoma remains a rare association and of fortuitous
discovery. This association poses a real diagnostic problem for the pa-
thologist, particularly in extemporaneous examination.

*1. Department of Pathology, "Iuliu Hatieganu" University of Medicine
and Pharmacy Cluj-Napoca; 2. Department of Pathology, County
Emergency Clinical Hospital, Cluj-Napoca, Romania
Background & objectives: Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours (PMT)
are very rare neoplasms associated with paraneoplastic-induced
osteomalacia due to renal phosphate wasting. Patients present with mus-
cular weakness, diffuse bone pain, and pathologic fractures. The tumour
is usually detected about 5 years after the clinical onset.
Methods: A 40-year-old woman presented with 6-year history of pro-
gressive bone pain, muscular hypotonia, and asthenic syndrome. Four
years ago magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed healed rib fractures
and an unconsolidated pubic arch fracture was currently present. She had
severe hypophosphatemia and elevated FGF23 serum levels, pleading for
oncogenic osteomalacia. A right supraspinatus muscle tumour was de-
tected and was surgically removed.
Results: At the Pathology Department, we received a 5.9X1.8X2.8 cm
tumour with ill-defined borders and variegated appearance on cut section.
Microscopically, the tumour consisted of monomorphic medium-sized
round-to-polygonal or spindle-shaped cells, with a moderate amount of
cytoplasm, arranged in large sheets, without necrosis. Cartilage, bone meta-
plasia, haemorrhagic foci, and dystrophic calcification were present. Mitotic
activity was very low. Numerous blood vessels of various calibres, some
with thrombus inside were present. Many osteoclast-like giant cells and
lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate were also observed. Immunohistochemical
stains revealed the mesenchymal origin of the tumour cells and the benign
nature of the blood vessels. The postoperative evolution was favourable,
with a dramatic improvement in serum phosphorus levels.
Conclusion: Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumour is a distinctive, usually
benign neoplasm of bone or soft tissue, associated with paraneoplastic
osteomalacia due to increased secretion of FGF23, with complete remis-
sion after surgical excision. It affects women more commonly and the
diagnosis is delayed for years because of their small size and unpredict-
able location. Histological diagnosis may be challenging, because of the
morphological overlap with other mesenchymal neoplasms. Our case
showed a dominant haemangiomatous component. Clinical data and lab-
oratory findings are crucial for diagnosis.

Thyroid pathology as a result of environmental factors?
A. Filin*, V. Danilenko, A. Churina, S. Selyavin, V. Shishkina
*Voronezh State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: It is well known that the thyroid gland is an
organ that is dependent on the ecological situation and reacts to environ-
mental influences. Focal proliferative changes in the tissue of the thyroid
gland can directly testify to the ecological tension.
Methods: Thyroid glands were studied in 54 autopsy cases not associated
with damage to the genital or endocrine organs. The thyroid gland was
dissected into a series of histotopographic sections. The detected pathology
was assessed stereomicroscopically in the entire volume of each organ.
Results: Thyroid pathology was found in 51 out of 54 cases (94 ± 3.2%).
In 10 cases, the changes were of a diffuse nature: thyroiditis, atrophy and
sclerosis of the glands, diffuse-infiltrative cancer. Separate foci of patho-
logical tissue structures were found in 41 thyroid glands (187 non-
cancerous and 3 cancerous). Thus, among the asymptomatic pathology
of the thyroid glands, focal changes (41 cases out of 51 - 80 ± 5.6%) are
much more often diffuse (10 cases).
Conclusion: Thus, the focal proliferative changes occurring in the thy-
roid gland tissue probably indicate the ecological tension in the region.
Under the influence of various goitrogenic factors, adaptive rearrange-
ments appear in the organ, which are manifested in the form of the for-
mation of pathological tissue structures, which undoubtedly requires fur-
ther in-depth study.

Some histological features in the interpretation of the nodular pathol-
ogy of the thyroid gland
V. Danilenko, V. Onufrieva, A. Filin*
*Voronezh State Medical University, Russia
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Differential diagnosis of benign and malig-
nant neoplasms of the thyroid gland is still a difficult problem. Especially
when the material obtained is scarce, for example, a fine-needle biopsy.
Methods: An analysis of histological specimens was carried out in 2229
cases of surgically removed thyroid glands with nodular pathology. A
series of sequential sections helped to represent tissue relationships in the
nodules.
Results: Only in a quarter of cases (523 out of 2229, 23%), the nodes
were malignant. Large nodules did not have a specific spatial organiza-
tion. Small nodules (<1 cm) has s spherical growth patterns wish necrotic
centre and periphery growth. Benign nodules has a random combination
of hyperplasia foci (more often in the centre of the node) each of which is
at its own stage of development. In the isolated foci of hyperplasia there
are qualitative indications of benign growth, found in other localizations
the sectorality of the structure, the transition from proliferating to mature
structures.
Conclusion: The spatial organization of tissue structures in the nodes of
the thyroid gland must be taken into account when conducting fine-
needle biopsies. Fine needle biopsies should be targeted so that changes
from the centre to the periphery of a suspicious tissue growth focus can be
compared.

Oncocytic variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma; a rare case
R.B. Girgin*, H. Gunel, H. Seneldir, M.S. Simoes
*Malatya Training and Research Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Oncocytic variant of papillary thyroid carci-
noma (PTC), in its pure form and mixed growth of pattern, is extremely
rare. Evaluating capsule invasion in these often encapsulated tumours is
important. Our aim is to set an example for the approach.
Methods: A 60-year-old man presented an iso-hypoechoic thyroid nod-
ule without thyroid dysfunction but associated with compressive symp-
toms. Thyroid ultrasound showed a nodule measuring 8 cm in its largest
dimension without lymphadenopathy (classified as TI-RADS 3 based on
the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System) on the left.
Results: Gross examination revealed an encapsulated 8 x 7 x 5.5 cm,
yellow-brown mass that nearly involved the left lobe. The capsule was
totally sampled and the lesion was near-totally sampled. Microscopic
evaluation showed a lesion of mixed pattern, predominatly follicular/
solid areas accompanied by several neoplastic papillae, that is formed
of almost purely oncocytic cells with nuclear features of PTC. A metic-
ulous investigation was performed to rule out capsule and/or vascular
invasion with serial sections. The diagnosis was “Encapsulated, non-in-
vasive, oncocytic variant of PTC”.
Conclusion: This extremely rare tumour raises some problems.
“Oncocytic variant of NIFT-P” (a rather descriptive entity that is not fully
defined), and “encapsulated follicular variant PTC” were considered in
the differential diagnosis. In the setting of an oncocytic tumour, the neo-
plastic papillae favour the diagnosis of “Oncocytic variant of PTC”. The
existence of mixed pattern of growth raises the possibility of lymph node
metastasis, as well as distant metastases despite the apparent absence of
vascular invasion. Following-up using TG plasma levels is
recommended.

Osteosarcoma metastasis to the thyroid with concomitant multifocal
papillary carcinoma. A case report
A.R. Gouloumis*, Z. Tsakiraki, A. Zacharatou, N. Koufopoulos, V.
Damaskou, N. Papadimitriou, P. Tomos, I. Panayiotides
*2nd Department of Pathology, National and Kapodistrian University of
Athens School of Medicine, “Attikon” University Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Osteosarcoma metastasis to the thyroid is
extremely rare. We report a case of metachronous osteosarcoma
metastasis to the thyroid with concomitant presence of papillary thyroid
carcinoma.
Methods: A 60-year-old patient with a history of chondroblastic osteo-
sarcoma of the sacrum eight years ago, with metachronous pulmonary
and tongue metastases was admitted due to a palpable thyroid mass with
pressure effects. Total thyroidectomy was performed. On gross examina-
tion, the left lobe was almost entirely replaced by a well-circumscribed,
solid, hard, grey-white, 6,2 cm large tumour.
Results: On microscopic examination, the neoplasm showed evidence of
a malignant, high grade neoplasm with cartilage and osteoid production.
Three foci of papillary thyroid carcinoma surrounded by normal thyroid
parenchyma co-existed; the thyroid carcinoma infiltrated two regional
lymph nodes. Based on histological findings, our diagnosis was malig-
nant neoplasm consistent with metastasis of the previously diagnosed
osteosarcoma, co-existing with multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of metastatic disease in the thyroid is chal-
lenging. Usually, symptoms simulate the clinical presentation of primary
thyroid tumours. Imaging studies cannot reliably distinguish between
primary thyroid lesions and metastatic disease.

Angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive tumour of the thyroid. Case
report
L. Gurevich*, E. Bondarenko, I. Voronkova
*RPOD Human Health, Russia
Background & objectives: Angiosarcoma(AS) of the thyroid gland is a
rare(2-4% of all thyroid neoplasms) but highly malignant tumour with a
poor prognosis. Given the importance of the correct histological diagnosis
for therapy choice, this is a relevant issue.
Methods: Total thyroidectomy was performed.
Results: There were encapsulated nodes with subtotal necrosis and single
papillary-like structures on the periphery. Six lymph nodes had metasta-
ses. The neoplastic cells were epithelioid, spindle, or polygonal-shaped
with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and round, large, nuclei containing
prominent nucleoli. The tumours showed high mitotic activity. That's
why "papillary thyroid carcinoma with anaplastic" was our first tentative
diagnosis. Immunostaining of metastases tissue showed positive staining
for pan-cytokeratin, vimentin, СD31, single cells positive for cytokeratin
7, and was negative for CD34, thyroglobulin, TTF-1, PAX-8, and p63.
The final pathological diagnosis was angiosarcoma. We detected local
recurrence with invasion trachea and bleeding 2 months letter initial sur-
gery. The patient died 6 months after the surgery.
Conclusion: AS may be misdiagnosed as other malignancies, espe-
cially anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Recognizing its clinicopatholog-
ic characters and combined application of specific vascular endothe-
lial immunohistochemical markers is important to avoid confusion
with other lesions.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma primary of the thyroid: case report
G. Holanda Maia*, G. Carvalho, J. Souza, A. Ramos, T.N. Albuquerque
Gomes Nogueira
*Universidade Federal do Ceará, Brazil
Background & objectives: Primary lymphoma of the thyroid (PLT) is a
neoplasm of monomorphic lymphocytes, infiltrating around of the vessels
and causing destruction of the follicular structures, accounting for <5% of
thyroid malignancies. This is a report of a case of thyroid lymphoma.
Methods: 64-years-old woman, presented an increase in painless cervical
volume associated with progressive high dysphagia, significant weight
loss and the appearance of painless nodulations on the medial face of the
arm and forearm, which ceased spontaneously, before the beginning of
the increase in cervical volume, progressing with dyspnoea and nocturnal
cough. The patient had hypothyroidism for more than 3 years.
Virchows Arch
Results: The patient underwent a thyroid biopsy with histopathology
showing a neoplasm composed of medium to large lymphoid cells, irreg-
ular nuclei, sometimes vesicular and convoluted, sometimes
hyperchromatic, with scarce cytoplasm, amidst small and morphological-
ly mature lymphocytes, frequent mitosis and necrosis figures. The immu-
nohistochemical study showed positivity for Bcl6, CD10 and CD20 with
90% Ki67. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma of the thyroid was given. Tracheostomy and gastrostomy were
performed due to the compressive effects of the tumour, and the patient
was referred to haematology.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of primary thyroid lymphoma should be con-
sidered when dealing with rapidly growing goitres. Fine needle aspiration
is a useful first step in diagnosing thyroid cancers; incisional biopsy for a
confirmatory diagnosis with immunohistochemical analysis is often nec-
essary. Compressive symptoms or airway involvement may need surgery
as a therapeutic option. The rare occurrence of PTL prevented further
studies, prospective and randomized, that would contribute to its diagno-
sis and treatment.

Multifocal ileal perforation due to massive adrenal amelanotic mel-
anoma metastasis masquerading as adrenocortical carcinoma
A.C. Lisievici*, S. Barbu, T. Georgescu, F. Pop
*Emergency University H. Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Adrenal metastases from malignant melano-
ma have been reported in up to 50% of all metastatic melanoma.
Nonetheless, most of them remaining clinically silent and are identified
incidentally. The literature reports increased incidence of adrenal metas-
tases in patients receiving immunotherapy.
Methods: We report the case of a 47–year-old male, with clinical history
of malignant melanoma, for which he was currently receiving immuno-
therapy. The patient was admitted in our hospital due to sudden onset of
occlusion symptoms. A CT-scan has been performed, revealing a large
tumour involving the left adrenal gland, with multifocal invasion of the
ileum. The patient underwent surgery.
Results: Two specimens labelled ‘left adrenal tumour’ and ‘ileum’
were received in our pathology laboratory. The adrenal tumour mea-
sured 21 cm and was composed of high-grade eosinophilic cells with
vesicular nuclei and cherry-coloured nucleoli. The cells were ar-
ranged in alveolar structures, lacking melanotic pigment. Large areas
of necrosis and angioinvasion were noted. The ileal wall was perfo-
rated in two places and revealed massive tumoral invasion with sim-
ilar morphology. The tumour was extending throughout the entire
wall, causing mucosal ulceration. The main differential diagnosis
was adrenocortical carcinoma. Immunohistochemical studies showed
tumour reactivity for S100 and Melanoma cocktail. Synaptophysin,
inhibin and AE1/AE3 were negative.
Conclusion: Adrenal metastases of melanoma are rare entities with
multifaceted histological aspects. Solely on histological examination,
our case featured alveolar and pseudopapillary aspects, with large
areas of necrosis, which in the absence of clinical history, would have
made the diagnosis extremely challenging. Moreover, to our knowl-
edge, multifocal perforation of the ileum due to adrenal metastasis,
has not been previously reported in the literature. This case also
strengthens the presumed relationship between immunotherapy and
adrenal metastases.

Immunoglobulin G4-related disease associated with Warthin-like
papillary thyroid carcinoma: report of a rare entity with a challeng-
ing diagnosis
M. Mellouli*, S. Graja, M. Triki, S. Makni, S. Charfi, C. Kammoun, T.
Boudawara, R. Kallel
*Habib Bourguiba Hospital, Department of Pathology, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-
RD) is a rare fibroinflammatory disease characterized by the presence of
dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells.
Warthin-like papillary thyroid carcinoma (WL-PTC) is a rare variant of
papillary carcinoma (PC), occurring predominantly in elderly women.
Methods: We report a case of an incidental discovery of IgG4-RD oc-
curring in a 24-year-old woman who presented with thyroid nodules,
cervical lymph nodes and a nodule in the parotid region.
Results: The patient underwent a total thyroidectomie with selective,
anterior neck dissection and excision of the parotid lymphadenopathy.
On gross examination, thyroid nodules measured 15 and 7 mm and were
unencapsulated. Histologically, they showed a papillary architecture with
prominent lymphatic stroma at the papillary stalk giving appearance of
Warthin’s tumour. The lining epithelial cells show typical nuclear fea-
tures of PC. Histologic examination of the nodule of the parotid showed a
dense plasmacytic infiltration including eosinophils with storiform fibro-
sis and many blood vessels with thick wall and regular endothelium.
Immunohistochemistry led to the diagnosis of IgG4-RD confirmed by
positive cytoplasmic staining for IgG4.
Conclusion: IgG4-RD is characterized by elevated serum IgG4 concen-
trations. The diagnosis is based on the association of clinical, serological,
and pathological criteria. IgG4-RD can be associated with Riedel,
Hashimoto thyroiditis and Graves’s disease. The association of IgG4-RD
and Hashimoto thyroidis displays an increased prevalence for PC and
shows a poor prognosis. To date, only two studies have reported IgG4
positive plasma cells in PC with a background of Hashimoto Thyroiditis.

Dyshormonogenetic goiter with malignant transformation: a rare
case
E. Mercan Demirtaş*, N. Can, İ. Usta, B. Öztorun
*Department of Pathology, Trakya University, School of Medicine,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Dyshormonogenetic Goiter is an enlarge-
ment of the thyroid gland that develops due to hereditary defects in thy-
roid hormone synthesis. Cases showing malignant transformation are rare
in the literature. We aim to analyse the clinicopathological features of this
rare entity.
Methods: A 24-year-old male patient applied to our hospital with a
swelling in the neck. He had been using thyroid hormone drugs since
his childhood. Neck ultrasonography revealed iso-hyperechogenic multi-
ple nodules in both lobes of the thyroid gland. A total thyroidectomy was
performed. Gross examination demonstrated multiple nodules measuring
from 0.7 to 4,5 cm.
Results: Histologically, the thyroid gland was composed of distinct nod-
ular structures which were separated by thick fibrous bands and including
microfollicles or trabecular structures. The follicular epithelial cells had
enlarged, vesicular, irregularly contoured nuclei with prominent nucleoli
and eosinophilic or clarified cytoplasm. The colloid was decreased
through the entire gland. And also, invasive encapsulated follicular var-
iant papillary carcinoma (1.8cm) in the left lobe and papillary
microcarcinoma (0.7cm) in the right lobe were identified.
Conclusion: Dyshormonogenesis is the second most common cause of
congenital hypothyroidism. Dyshormonogenetic goiter is a characterized
by architectural and cellular pleiomorphism which can mimic neoplasia
and causes diagnostic difficulties. However, uncommonly, tumours may
develop due to chronic TSH stimulation and new genetic changes.

Well-differentiated thyroid tumour of uncertain malignant potential
with signet-ring cell morphology: a rare case

*Department of Pathology, Trakya University, School of Medicine,
Turkey
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Signet ring cell adenoma of the thyroid,
though rare, is well documented. Our case is the first case in the literature
as a well-differentiated thyroid tumour of uncertain malignant potential
with signed ring morphology.
Methods: A 39-year-old female patient had a 3.5 cm hypoechogenic
heterogeneous nodule in the thyroid left lobe on USG. Fine needle aspi-
ration biopsy was performed from this nodule and it diagnosed as follic-
ular neoplasm (Bethesda category IV). A left thyroidectomy was per-
formed. An encapsulated single nodule 2.5 cm in diameter with colloidal
and solid areas was detected in the macroscopic examination.
Results: Histopathological examination revealed an encapsulated nodule
with signet-ring cells. Nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinoma are
not seen in these cells. Local capsular irregularities and suspicious inva-
sion signs were detected in serial sections but true capsular invasion could
not be proven. Thyroidal origin of these cells was shown with immuno-
histochemical antibodies (TTF1, Thyroglobulin positivity, CDX2, CEA
negativity) and histochemical stains (musicarmin and PAS negativity)
Conclusion: Clear cell changes can be seen in thyroid neoplasms as a
result of accumulation of glycogen, lipid, thyroglobulin or mucin in
intracytoplasmic vesicles. Rarely, the signet-ring cell morphology can
be dominant in follicular lesions. Awareness of this entity is important
as it may closely simulate a metastatic mucin-secreting signet ring cell
carcinoma. On the other hand, capsular features should be examined
detailed because of the invasive follicular lesions can be hide out back
of these lesions.

Oncocytic adrenocortical neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential:
a case report and review of literature
G. Miranda*, J. Dos Santos, J. Correia-Pinto, M. Honavar
*Hospital Pedro Hispano (ULSM), Portugal
Background & objectives: To report a case of an oncocytic adrenocor-
tical neoplasm (OAN), a very rare adrenal tumour with a challenging
diagnostic and prognostic assessment.
Methods: A 77-year-old man, without a relevant medical past, performed
a computed tomography after a major trauma. The imaging exam re-
vealed a large mass on the left adrenal gland and the patient underwent
nephroadrenalectomy. We present a description with laboratory, imaging
and pathologic findings.
Results: Hormonal workup was unremarkable. The gross specimen
weighed 877g and showed a well-defined and capsulated adrenal mass
measuring 141 x 110 x 65mm with tan cut surface with cystic area.
Histologically, the tumour was composed of sheets of oncocytic cells
with abundant, granular and eosinophilic cytoplasm, and rare mitotic
activity. No capsular, venous or sinusoidal invasion was seen.
Conclusion: OANs are very rare tumours in the adrenal cortex and ac-
curate classification is important. The Weiss system cannot be applied to
OANs and therefore, diagnostic schemes for OAN have been established,
such as the Lin-Weiss-Bisceglia (LWB) system. While the major criteria
of malignancy were not met, the large size of this lesion indicates uncer-
tain malignant potential, according to LWB.

An unusual case of medullary thyroid carcinoma mimicking papil-
lary thyroid carcinoma
F. Mundim*, C. Serrano, P. Mundim, R. Diniz, L. Jorge, R. Romero, R.
Pelizzaro, T. Filho, N. Sousa
*UNIVAS/UNIFENAS, Brazil
Background & objectives: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) origi-
nates in the thyroid parafollicular/C cells and represents 3-4% of the thyroid
neoplasms. Present report will be described the difficulty of the diagnosis
papillary variant of MTC, without complementary information, and the
indispensability of the diagnostic confirmation by immunohistochemistry.
Methods: This case report is about a 67-year-old woman undergoing
routine ultrasound and revealed a solid nodule in the right thyroid lobe,
hypervascularized with microcalcifications and cystic areas. Fine needle
aspiration diagnosis follicular neoplasm, Hürthle cell type with dysplasia.
She has subsequently submitted thyroidectomy with the morphological
diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma, and the result was requested to
be confirmed by immunohistochemistry.
Results: The immunohistochemical examination revealed that it was a
papillary variant of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid with the following
immunostaining panel: positive chromogranin A and calcitonin in neo-
plastic cells and positive TTF-1, focally in neoplastic cells. The patient
was immediately informed that she would start radioactive iodine treat-
ment without the diagnostic confirmation requested by the pathologist.
The conduction for inadequate treatment was interrupted since medullary
carcinoma does not capture iodine, the patient was subjected to genetic
testing and cancer markers, being free of the disease.
Conclusion: Diagnosis of the papillary variant of Medullary thyroid car-
cinoma due to its characteristics creates a difficulty in its diagnosis and
confusion with papillary carcinoma. The morphological diagnosis with-
out subsidiary clinical information (calcitonin test) can be compromised,
and it is essential to perform the immunohistochemical study for the final
diagnosis, which is considered the gold standard.

Thyroid cancer – a quick overview: correlations with clinical diag-
nosis and demographic factors
A. Muresan*, R. Barna, A. Slovac, M. Iacob, M. Cornianu
*Department of Pathology, Emergency County Hospital "Pius Brinzeu"
Timisoara, Romania
Background & objectives: The aim of this study is to determine the
prevalence of incidental thyroid cancer in patients who undergo lobectomy
or thyroidectomy for different other pathologies, and secondly to evaluate
the incidence of thyroid neoplasm based on demographic factors.
Methods: All cases of lobectomy or thyroidectomy examined in our
department between January 2018 to December 2020 were analysed ret-
rospectively. The patients were stratified based on clinical diagnosis, age,
gender, and resident area. After assessment, a group of 1216 cases of
lobectomy or thyroidectomy was identified. Correlation with clinical de-
tails couldn’t be done because they are not available in most cases.
Results: From all cases, 1076 (88.48%) were sent with clinical diag-
nosis of goiter, 508 (47.21%) of them turned out to have primary
thyroid neoplasm. Among all cases, 62 (5.09%) had clinical diagno-
sis of thyroiditis, 32 (51.61%) between them had thyroid cancer. The
study also analyzes the incidence based on age and gender. Most of
the thyroid cancer was in > 41-year age group 494 (85.46%) patients
compared with 84 (14.53%) in ≤41-year age group. Gender analysis
showed that 489 (84.60%) of patients were women and 89 (15.39%)
men. In urban areas we noticed a slightly increased incidence of
thyroid cancer 328 (56.94%) while in rural areas were 248
(43.05%) cases.
Conclusion: The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing more and more
every year in our region and has a slight tendency to affect younger
patients. Considering all the results, a thorough and careful gross exam-
ination of each thyroid should be performed, taken into consideration the
high probability of diagnosing an incidental thyroid cancer in specimens
received as non-neoplastic.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma with mucinous features harbouring
ETV6-NTRK3 fusion: expanding the morphologic spectrum of
NTRK-rearranged thyroid carcinomas
K. Murshed*, A. Abu-Dayeh, W. Abualainin, M. Petkar
*Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: ETV6-NTRK3 translocated PTCs are rare.
They are characterized by aggressive clinical behaviour, distinct mor-
phology, and good response to NTRK inhibitors. The presence of mucin-
ous component in this subset of PTCs is a finding that has never been
described before.
Methods: We report a 44-year-old female patient, who presented with a
progressively enlarging anterior neck swelling of four months duration,
accompanied by cervical lymphadenopathy. We describe herein the radi-
ology, cytology and histopathology findings of the neck mass, including
immunohistochemical studies as well as molecular analysis by next gen-
eration sequencing (Oncomine Focus Assay), utilizing a panel targeting
35 hotspot genes.
Results: Ultrasound showed hypoechoic irregular solid lesion in left thy-
roid lobe with cervical lymphadenopathy. FNA was consistent with PTC
and lymph node metastasis. Histologic examination demonstrated exten-
sive infiltration of left lobe by carcinoma exhibiting dual morphology,
partly composed of dilated glands filled with mucin and lined by mucous-
secreting cells, while other areas showed conventional PTC. Tumour cells
in both components were immunoreactive for pancytokeratin, CK7,
CK19, PAX8, TTF1 (less intensity in mucinous component), HBME-1
and galectin 3, but negative for CK20, thyroglobulin, BRAFV600E,
synaptophysin, chromogranin, calcitonin, S100, mammaglobin and
GCDFP-15. NGS showed fusion between exon 4 of ETV6 gene and exon
14 of NTRK3 gene. Patient was given high dose radioactive iodine ther-
apy. Four months later, imaging studies revealed no evidence of residual
tumour.
Conclusion: The presence of locoregionally aggressive PTC that shows
distinct morphologic features and negative staining for BRAFV600E,
may raise the suspicion of NTRK-rearranged carcinoma. Although rare,
they should be correctly identified as they carry an actionable biomarker
for targeted therapies. Our case represents the first case of ETV6-NTRK3
translocated PTC that shows extensive mucinous features. This finding
expands our knowledge of this subset of PTCs.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma: pathological study of histological
variants
Y. Sarra*, N. Abdessayed, Y. Fejji, Z. Nfikha, A. Bchir, S. Chaieb, L.
Jaidane, M. Mokni
*FARHAT HACHED HOSPITAL, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Papillary carcinoma (PC) is an indolent tu-
mour. The latest WHO classification lists 14 variants of PC with different
prognosis. Objective: to determine the frequency of PC variants and de-
scribe their main clinical and pathological criteria.
Methods: This is a retrospective study that involved all the variants of
thyroid PCs diagnosed between 2017 and2020 in Sousse. Their clinical
and pathological parameters were studied.
Results: 18 variants (15.7%) were collected from a total of 114 cases of
PC. The variants were distributed as follows: 55% vesicular variant (VPC),
23% diffuse sclerosing variant (DSC), 17% oncocytic variant (OPC) and
5% Whartin-like carcinoma. There were 16 women (88%) and 2 men with
an average age of 52y. All the tumours were purely intra-thyroid and
presented lymph node metastasis in 66% of cases. They were classified
as stage pT1a, pT1b, pT2, pT3a in 38%, 12%, 16% and 34% of cases. The
most advanced stages (pT3a) were observed during DSC and VPC. The
presence of vascular emboli was noted in 2 cases of DSC (11%).
Conclusion: The most common variant of PC are represented by
microcarcinoma and VPC. DSC, high cell PC and column cell PC repre-
sent 4.4% of all PCs. These variants are more aggressive, associated with
a higher frequency of recurrences, lymph node metastases and resistance
to radioiodine. DSC is the only aggressive form noted in our study,
representing 17% of PCs against only 6% in the literature. Unlike DSC,
OPC, VPC, and Whartin-like carcinoma have the same prognostic impact
as the classic variant.

GH-secreting pituitary carcinoma
S. Silva*, A. Payá, A. Picó, I. Aranda López
*University Hospital in Alicante, Spain
Background & objectives: A GH-secreting pituitary carcinoma has
symptoms, signs and histological features indistinguishable from benign
GH-secreting adenomas. Prognostic markers of aggressive behaviour
among these tumours has yet to be resolved.
Methods: We report a case from a series of 397 pitNET. A 57-year-
old male with somatotropic pituitary macroadenoma "atypical" ac-
cording to the WHO classification 2004 (Ki-67>3), with two pituitary
relapses without response to Growth hormone antagonists. Ten years
later, he consulted for language disorders and memory loss. Imaging
tests revealed a single intra-axial occipital lesion approximately 7 cm
in diameter.
Results: The microscopic study of the occipital mass showed a neuroen-
docrine neoplasm with inmunoreactivity similar to the pituitary tumour
(strong positivity for synaptophysin, chromogranin, Pit 1 and growth
hormone).Ki-67 index was higher than in pituitary adenoma. A molecular
study with NGS was negative. Nuclear immunoreactivity for P53
was 15%.
Conclusion: This case corresponds to a pituitary carcinoma originat-
ing from an aggressive Pit-NET. There is evidence to suggest that
progression from "benign" PITNET to pituitary carcinoma could be
due to cumulative changes in molecular pathway abnormalities.
Although in our case no molecular alteration was detected, we found
a low and weak expression of P53, which could suggest an alteration
in the regulation of this protein.

Primary acinic cell carcinoma of the lung metastatic to the thyroid
gland and lateral cervical lymph nodes: a case report
A. Slovac*, A. Muresan, M. Pasca Fenesan, R. Barna, R. Cornea, C.
Lazureanu, M. Cornianu
*Department of Pathology, Emergency County Hospital "Pius Brinzeu"
Timisoara, Romania
Background & objectives: Primary acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) of the
lung is rare, and distant metastases even rarer. We report the case of a 70-
year-old male with a history of nodular goiter, who presented to the
hospital with hoarseness and difficulty breathing.
Methods: Physical examination revealed a 6x4 cm, multinodular mass
within the left thyroid lobe and enlarged lateral cervical lymph nodes.
Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast showed an enlarged,
multinodular left thyroid lobe with heterogeneous contrast uptake, along-
side confluent lateral cervical lymphadenopathies, and bilateral nodular
pulmonary lesions. Thyroid neoplasm was suspected, and biopsy of the
thyroid and lymph nodes was performed.
Results: Histopathological examination of both thyroid gland and
lateral cervical lymphadenopathy revealed a monomorphic tumoral
proliferation, arranged in lobules and nests of atypical cells with
abundant, clear, and, in some areas, granular, eosinophilic cyto-
plasm, with eccentric, vesicular nuclei and low mitotic activity.
The tumour displayed a fibrous, hyalinized stroma, vascular inva-
sion, occasional psammoma bodies, and small foci of necrosis.
Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for CAM 5.2, and TTF1,
while thyroglobulin, chromogranin A, ALK, and PD-L1 were
negative.
Conclusion: The patient was treated with Carboplatin, Pemetrexed, and
Pembrolizumab. The outcome was unfavourable, with numerous treat-
ment and disease-related complications, shortly after followed by death.
To our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the English literature of
a primary ACC of the lung with metastases to the thyroid gland, and the
third case with lymph node metastases.

Adrenocortical oncocytic neoplasm coexisting with a central nervous
system tumour based on CT- imaging: a case report
E. Souka*, G. Kyriakopoulos, G. Galanopoulos, M. Kyriazi, A. Tertipi,
H.J. Trihia, C. Valavanis
*Metaxa Cancer Hospital Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: Oncocytic neoplasms are commonly discov-
ered in thyroid and kidney resection specimens and oncocytic metaplasia
is routine in breast pathology reports, but oncocytic adrenocortical neo-
plasms (ACON) are very rare.
Methods: We present a case of 50-year-old male who was referred to our
hospital for an adrenal gland incidentaloma on CT imaging measuring 79
mm.
The patient has a 20-year medical history of a non-biopsied suprasellar
tumour causing obstructive hydrocephalus, treated with a ventricular valve.
The preoperative functional workup was negative, and an open adrenal
resection was subsequently performed.
Results: Grossly the tumour weighed 220gr, and histologically it showed
trabecular and diffuse growth pattern. The tumour cells were large with abun-
dant eosinophilic cytoplasm, centrally placed nucleus and prominent nucleoli.
We identified 2mitoses/50HPF and capsular invasion, but no atypical mito-
ses, necrosis, venous invasion or periadrenal tissue invasion. The neoplastic
cells were MelanA(+), Inhibin(+) focally, CKAE1/AE(+) focally, EMA(-),
ChromograninA(-), Synaptophysin(+) focally. There was disruption of the
reticulin pattern. The tumour was consistent with an adrenocortical neoplasm
with a suspected oncocytic nature. Since antimitochondrial antibodies were
not available and ACONs are very rare neoplasms, we encouraged a consul-
tation from a referral centre. The tumour was indeed an ACON borderline
malignant (Lin-Weiss-Bisceglia criteria).
Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge this is the first recorded case of a
patient with coexisting central nervous system tumour and oncocytic adreno-
cortical tumour. Since ACONs are uncommon, our knowledge of their clin-
ical behaviour relies mostly on small series or isolated case reports and there is
no consensus on the follow-up plan or the role of chemotherapy.

G. Khabas
*FSBI "National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynaecology
and Perinatology after V.I. Kulakov" Ministry of Healthcare Russian
Federation, Russia
Background & objectives: Pure form of gonadal dysgenesis, 46 XY is a
form of sex formation disorder characterized by hypoplastic uterus,
fallopian tubes and dysgenetic gonads developed from the bipotential
gonad into the testicle from 3 to 8 weeks of intrauterine development.
Methods: The patient with complaints of the absence of secondary sexual
characteristics and menstruation was examined srutinizely with biochem-
ical analysis, histology, kariotyping and full exome sequencing.
Results: Sexual development corresponded to stage 1 according to Taner.
The external genital organs are formed according to the female type. The
vagina ends blindly, up to 3.5 cm deep. The uterus is absent in the small
pelvis. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, hypoestrogenism, low testos-
terone levels with normal levels of other androgens were noted.
Karyotype was 46, XY. Laparoscopy with bilateral removal of the sex
glands performed. The gonads on both sides are represented by testicular
tissue, the epididymis on the right is of a normal structure. Full exome
sequencing demonstrated the mutation in the 2nd exon of the DHH gene
(the variant in the homozygous state c.419T> G, p.L140R (513x)).
Conclusion: The above clinical observation demonstrates the importance
of multidisciplinary management, morphological and molecular verifica-
tion of the diagnosis for choosing the correct management tactics for such
patients.

Tregubova
*FSBI "National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynaecology
and Perinatology after V.I. Kulakov" Ministry of Healthcare Russian
Federation, Russia
Background & objectives: Morphological features of ovarian carcinoma
(OC) histotypes can be ambigous. So additional tissue markers applica-
tions should be used to improve diagnostic accuracy. The aim of this
study was to develop cost-effective ICH panel for OC differential
diagnostics.
Methods: We recruited 87 patients with ovarian carcinomas. 8 monoclo-
nal antibodies were applied for immunohistochemistry (ICH): Ki67, р53,
р16, WT1, PAX8, PgR-A and ER. Semiquantative and quantative anal-
yses were used. Chi Automatic Interaction Detection analysis (CHAID)
was applied for differential diagnostics.
Results: CHAID helped to hierarchical tree creation with 3 ICH markers
(WT1, р53 и PR) for OC histotype detection with overall accuracy
91,7%. High WT1 expression with mutant p53 was highly specific for
high-grade serous carcinomas in 97,0%, positive WT1 with wild type p53
was specific for low-grade serous carcinomas in 85,7%. In tumours with
negative WT1 expression we used PgR for stratification. It was specific
for endometrioid OC in 97% (isolated) and in 100% (with p53 wild type).
If PgR was negative clear cell carcinoma was detected with accuracy
75,0%
Conclusion: The developed highly informative IHC panel (WT1, p53,
and PR) can be used as a standardized algorithm for determining ovarian
carcinoma histotype with 91,7% accuracy. It can improve the detection
rate, reduce diagnostic time, facilitate the differential diagnostics and help
to choose the optimal treatment option.

A case report of deep aggressive angiomyxoma presenting as a pol-
ypoid mass
F. Musa, R. Badea*
*Department of Cellular Pathology, Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation
Trust, Royal Berkshire Hospital, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Deep aggressive angiomyxoma is a rare
mesenchymal tumour that most commonly arises in the vulvovaginal
region, perineum and pelvis of women. The term aggressive emphasizes
the often-infiltrative nature of the tumour and its frequent association with
local recurrence.
Methods: We report a case of a 43-year-old female, with no significant
previous medical history, who presented with a large polypoid mass
measuring 8x8cm attached through a stalk to the left labia majora. The
lesion grew slowly over 3 years before presentation. There was no pain or
associated tenderness.
Results: Following wide local excision of the lesion, the specimen re-
ceived in our institution was a large pedunculated mass measuring
8.5x7.5x2.5cm. The cut surface had a soft, gelatinous appearance with
a tan-grey to pink colour. On histological examination, the lesion was
composed of an ill-defined hypocellular proliferation of bland spindle and
stellate cells. The background stroma appeared myxoid and contained
numerous medium/large sized vessels with thick hyalinised walls. The
spindle cells were mostly positive for SMA and focally positive for
Desmin and CD34. They also expressed ER and PR. S100 was negative.
Virchows Arch
The morphological and immunohistochemical features were in keeping
with a deep aggressive angiomyxoma.
Conclusion: Despite the nomenclature, the WHO Classification of
Tumours of the Female Genital Tract (5th Edition) recognizes that a small
subset of these lesions can present as a pedunculated polyp. Deep aggres-
sive angiomyxoma of the vulva needs to be distinguished from benign
myxoid tumours with a low risk of local recurrence as well as from
malignant myxoid neoplasms. Usually, wide local excision with
tumour-free margins and occasionally hormonal manipulation is the treat-
ment of choice.

A rare case of fallopian tube lipoleiomyoma associated with ectopic
pregnancy
F. Musa, R. Badea*
*Department of Cellular Pathology, Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation
Trust, Royal Berkshire Hospital United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Leiomyomas are the most common benign
tumours of the female genital tract and most commonly arise from the
uterus. The incidence of fallopian tube leiomyomas is extremely low and
there are very few case reports of the lipoleiomyoma variant.
Methods: We report a case of a 33 year old woman, with no significant
previous medical history, who presented with perivaginal bleeding and
mild abdominal pain. Her last menstrual period was approximately 2
months before presentation. On ultrasound examination, a right tubal
ectopic pregnancy was discovered, measuring 35x34x21mm with a cho-
rionic ring and yolk sac. Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin was
raised.
Results: The specimen received in our institution was a fallopian tube
measuring 65mm in length with a focally dilated portion measuring up to
15mm. On slicing, the lumen contained blood clot and a tan nodule
measuring 7x6x4mm. On histological examination, the dilated portion
contained chorionic villi along with a small piece of foetal tissue. A
placental implantation site was also identified. The tan nodule showed
morphological features in keeping with a lipoleiomyoma.
Immunohistochemistry (SMA +ve, Desmin +ve, S100 +ve in adipocytes
and CK -ve) supports this morphological diagnosis.
Conclusion: Fallopian tube leiomyomas arise from the mesosalpinx or
the smooth muscle cells of the blood vessels. They are small and located
unilaterally, although there are case reports of tubal leiomyomas as large
as 13x9cm. Large leiomyomas can undergo torsion or degeneration. Most
cases of tubal leiomyomas are asymptomatic and found incidentally dur-
ing unrelated surgical procedures or at autopsy. In our case, this incidental
lesion which was obstructing the tube lumen might have been the under-
lying aetiology for the ectopic pregnancy.

Intraepithelial colonization of the uterine tube by a metastatic pan-
creatic adenocarcinoma simulating a serous tubal intraepithelial car-
cinoma (STIC)
J.A. Baena-Del Valle*, N.A. Hurtado-Buendía, M. Mejía-Arango, C.
Buriticá-Cifuentes, D.E. Sanabria-Serrano
*Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá, Colombia
Background & objectives: When talking about metastatic tumours of the
ovary and uterine tube, the first thing that comes to mind is the Krukenberg
tumour. However, metastasis could simulate ovarian and tubal primary
epithelial malignancies and pose major diagnostic challenges.
Methods: A 55-year-old female with a left adnexal mass was referred for
additional studies. A PET/CT showed a 25 cm hypermetabolic left
abdominopelvic mass, a 3 cm mass in the pancreatic tail, and smaller
stomach lesions. Cancer Antigen 19-9 levels were 960 U/mL. A total
abdominal hysterectomy with left salpingo-oophorectomy was conducted
during which multiple peritoneal and omental implants were observed.
Results: Histology showed an adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous
differentiation (intestinal-type) extensively involving the ovary, uter-
ine tube, and serosa. A non-mucinous intraepithelial tumour growth
pattern was found in the fimbrial and nonfimbriated portions of the
tube. Immunohistochemistry showed an abnormal strong diffuse
overexpression of p53, diffuse expression of CK7, focal CK20 and
CDX-2 expression, and absence of PAX-8 staining, supporting the
diagnosis of metastasis, most probably from pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma.
The intraepithelial pattern of metastasis may not be frequent, but it is of
key relevance when it comes to tubal neoplasia since it can be easily
mistaken for a STIC. Features like mucinous cytology, involvement of
nonfimbriated portions and serosa favour metastasis.
Conclusion: Immunohistochemistry was useful to rule out a STIC and
help identify the primary tumour. Lack of PAX-8 expression, along with
immunoreactivity for CK7, CK20, and CDX-2 provided support for a
nongynecologic origin. The normal endoscopy and the presence of a
mass in the tail of the pancreas made this the most probable origin of
the tumour. p53 alone is not enough to confirm STIC. An interdisciplin-
ary approach and wise use of immunohistochemistry are essential for a
correct diagnosis.

Case report of an ovarian signet ring stromal tumour
A. Bancu*, R.A. Roșca, C.-.A. Guți, A. Neicu, A. Ene
*Emergency University Hospital Bucharest, Department of Pathology,
Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Ovarian signet ring stromal tumours are ex-
ceedingly rare sex cord-stromal neoplasms. We present such a case in a
59-year-old patient admitted for abnormal uterine bleeding. Her
gynaecological examination revealed enlargement of the left adnexa
due to an ill-defined ovarian mass.
Methods: The ovary was received fresh for an intraoperative consult,
measured 3.5/2.5/2.5 cm and had a firm consistency. Its cut surface ap-
peared nodular, homogenous, and grey. The morphology was consistent
with an ovarian stromal tumour. Representative sections were submitted
for subsequent final diagnosis on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tis-
sue. A completion hysterectomy was also performed at the time due to
numerous uterine masses.
Results: H&E-stained slides showed a benign stromal proliferation of two
cell populations: spindle cells, arranged in vague fascicles, admixed with
epithelioid cells featuring a signet ring appearance, with clear cytoplasmic
vacuoles peripherally displacing the nucleus. We noticed no atypical mito-
ses or necrosis. Intratumoral oedema and fibrosis were focally associated.
The uterus showed numerous leiomyomas, areas of adenomyosis and ex-
tensive endometrial atrophy, explaining the symptoms. The contralateral
adnexa displayed no abnormality. Immunohistochemical stains were per-
formed. The mass showed negative AE1/AE3 expression, excluding the
possibility of a Krukenberg tumour. Inhibin was positive in a patchy dis-
tribution, with variable, moderate-to-strong intensity, consistent with pre-
viously reported cases.
Conclusion: Given the characteristic morphology, our final diagnosis
was ovarian signet ring stromal tumour. Such benign entities should be
included in the differential diagnosis whenever variable amounts of signet
ring cells are admixed with bland spindle cells. They should be differen-
tiated from metastases, especially Krukenberg tumours, which are usually
bilateral and show strong and diffuse cytokeratin expression. In such
cases, clinical history is often helpful. Other stromal tumours might show
focal signet ring cell transformation, but only in a patchy fashion.

Carcinosarcoma of the ovary arising from an endometriotic cyst - a
case report

Virchows Arch
*Department of Pathology and Laboratory Diagnostics, Maria
Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, Warsaw,
Poland
Background & objectives: Endometriosis affects 5-15% of women, 0.5-
1% of the cases are complicated by related neoplasm, exceptionally car-
cinosarcoma. Carcinosarcoma is a malignant tumour composed of epi-
thelial and sarcomatous components. Herein, we report the case of ovar-
ian carcinosarcoma arising from an endometriotic cyst.
Methods: A 55-year-old female patient with a history of hysterectomy
due to multiple leyomyomas 17 years ago, was admitted to the hospital
because of the pelvic mass and elevated serum CA125. A transvaginal
ultrasound revealed 12 cm cystic, partially solid tumour of the left ovary.
Surgical resection was followed by standard pathological evaluation and
BRCA1/BRCA2 genes mutation testing.
Results: Pathological evaluation revealed biphasic malignant neoplasm
of the ovary, within endometriotic cyst, composed of high grade carcino-
matous and sarcomatous elements. The carcinomatous component was
ambiguous in appearance between endometrioid and serous carcinoma.
The sarcomatous component was heterologous with chondrosarcoma dif-
ferentiation. Immunohistochemically, tumour cells were positive for
PAX8, PTEN, CKAE1/AE3, vimentin, patchily for p16, and negative
for WT1, beta-catenin, desmin, oestrogen and progesterone receptors.
Immunostaining for p53 showed a wild-type pattern. Expression of mis-
match repair proteins was retained. CD10 was positive in the stroma of
endometriosis. Mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2 genes were not found.
Disease was confined to one ovary. Therefore, a final diagnosis of carci-
nosarcoma derived from endometriotic cyst was rendered.
Conclusion: Neoplasms can develop in endometriosis setting, especially
from endometriotic cyst.
Before making the diagnosis of primary ovarian carcinosarcoma, the
endometrial origin has to be excluded.
Once the carcinomatous component demonstrates ambiguous morpholo-
gy as well as endometrioid and/or clear cell rather than serous differenti-
ation, it should raise concern for the possibility of the endometriosis
origin. Therefore, diligent tumour sampling and assessment is crucial.
Immunostaining for p53 commonly has mutation-type pattern in both
components however wild-type staining pattern can occur.

Buffelli, F. Barra, S. Ferrero, E. Fulcheri, V.G. Vellone
*Department of Integrated Surgical and Diagnostic Sciences (DISC),
University of Genoa, Italy
Background & objectives: Endometrial carcinoma (EC) represents an
emerging disease with an increasing incidence of aggressive histotypes
and advanced stages. We investigated the immunohistochemical expres-
sion of the Androgen Receptor (AR) and its correlation with other histo-
logical and immunohistochemical markers of prognosis.
Methods: EC hysterectomy specimens were tested with immunohisto-
chemistry (IHC) for Estrogen Receptor (ERα), Progesterone Receptor
(PR), AR, Ki67, p53, β-Catenin, E-Cadherin, Bcl-2, CyclineD1, MLH1
, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6. The IHC expression was evaluated as a
percentage of neoplastic cells (%) and dichotomized in high or low ex-
pression according to their distribution.
Results: We evaluated 103 Low Grade Endometrioids (LGEC), 15 High
Grade Endometrioids (HGEC), 25 Other High Grade Histotypes
(OHEC); 111 FIGO I-II, 32 FIGO III-IV. AR showed a variable distri-
bution (Mean:23.8±26.4% Min:0% Max: 95%) with weak positivity (1+)
with a significant correlation (p<0.001) with ER and PR (R=0.4). LGECs
showed higher expression of AR than HGEC and OHEC (27.7 Vs 11 Vs
15.6; p = 0.016). The AR low cases were G3 (n=28; p=0.001), ER low
(n=17; p=0.004) and PR low (n=33; p=0.001). 13 FIGO III-IV cases
showed high levels of AR and 3 of these were G3, ER low and PR low.
Conclusion: AR proved to be a promising prognostic marker with a
partial correlation with ER and PR levels; its permanence in advanced
non-hormone-sensitive cases hypothesize its possible role as a second-
line therapeutic target in patients not eligible for chemotherapy.

Adenoid basal carcinoma found incidentally in case with uterine
prolapse
G.E. Cecikoglu*, H. Gunel, O.D. Yardimci, A. Aydin
*Medeniyet University Prof. Dr. Suleyman Yalcin City Hospital
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: We detected incidentally adenoid basal car-
cinoma in the patient with uterine prolapse. We aimed to show that the
histopathological examination should be done by the pathologist more
carefully in cases where neoplasia is not suspected.
Methods: A 53-year-old postmenopausal woman presented to our clinic
with a history of uterine prolapse. The patient had not a cervical mass on
pelvic examination and imaging methods. The patient underwent vaginal
hysterectomy for uterine prolapse, and ABC was incidentally found in the
cervix.
Results: Gross examination of the surgical specimen showed that the
ectocervical squamous epithelium was thickened and white in colour.
Microscopically, the tumour was composed of multiple small, round-to-
oval cells arranged in small nests or cords resembling those of basal cell
carcinoma of the skin. There were focally nuclear atypia and pleomor-
phism. Small, solid cell nests of irregular shape invaded the cervical
stroma. Squamous and glandular differentiation were found in the centre
of some cell nests. No desmoplastic reaction was observed in the stroma.
Tumour cells showed nuclear immunoreactivity for p63 and blocked
staining with p16. Focal reaction with CD117, Bcl-2, and Vimentin;
negative for ER.
Conclusion: The case was diagnosed as ABC. ABC of the cervix is a rare
condition that is considered to be indolent when pure 1. It is essential to
distinguish ABC from other kinds of uterine cervix cancer. It is also
critical to distinguish between ABC and adenoid cystic
carcinoma(ACC). ABC had lower metastatic potential and a favourable
prognosis than ACC. Adenoid basal carcinomas (ABCs) are even rarer,
but careful histopathological examination is recommended for hysterec-
tomy materials performed due to uterine prolapse.

Endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the ovary with follicular architec-
ture and aberrant thyroglobulin expression: a case report and review
of the literature

*Unit of Anatomic Pathology, Department of Medical Sciences and
Public Health, AOU Cagliari, University of Cagliari, Italy
Background & objectives: Primary ovarian tumours with follicular
pattern(FP) include ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinomas(OEA), sex
cord tumours, small cell carcinomas of hypercalcemic type, ovarian car-
cinoid tumours and monodermal teratomas.
This study is aimed to report a case of OEA with FP and thyroglobulin
expression.
Methods: A 76-years-old woman was admitted to our hospital with pel-
vic pain and weakness. A highly vascularized mass on the right ovary was
shown at the ultrasound examination and a partially cystic and solid
appearance was observed at the CT scan. Altered laboratory tests were
observed and surgery was performed.
Results: A 2 cm-yellowish nodule of the right ovary was observed. At
histology, the nodule showed two architectural patterns: a glandular and a
Virchows Arch
follicular one. The former had the classical aspect of an OEA, whereas the
latter was characterized by eosinophilic amorphous material inside cuboi-
dal cells-lined medium and large-sized follicles, resembling thyroid gland
architecture. At immunohistochemistry, Cytockeratin 19, Epitheliel
Membrane Antigen and Estrogen receptor were strongly positive in both
components. Focal expression of CA125, CD99, PAX8, PAX2,
Cytokeratin 7, PTEN and Progesteron Receptor was observed. TTF-1,
BRAFV600E and HBME-1 were not expressed. On the contrary, the
follicles’ eosinophilic amorphous material and scattered cells in the glan-
dular component immunoreacted for thyroglobulin.
Conclusion: Numerous primary and metastatic ovarian tumours may show
a FP. For the correct diagnosis, a wide set of immunohistochemistry is
mandatory and even thyroid markers should be assessed in doubtful cases.
In the ovary, thyroglobulin is commonly expressed in struma ovarii.
Moreover, its focal expression has already been reported in occasional
serous ovarian carcinomas.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an OEA with
concomitant focal FP and thyroglobulin expression.

Ouzari, R. Rizzo, I. Zidi
*Laboratory Microorganismes and Active Biomolecules, Sciences
Faculty of Tunis, University Tunis El Manar, Tunisia
Background & objectives: HLA-E has a controversial tumour prognos-
tic value due to the association of either its inhibitory and activating
receptor on LT and NK cells.We investigated soluble HLA-E (sHLA-
E) expression in endometrial cancer (EC) and analyse its implication as a
prognostic marker.
Methods: The quantification of plasmatic sHLA-E was carried out by
ELISA in twenty seven EC plasma samples compared to forty five plas-
ma samples collected from healthy donors. Extracted genomic DNA was
genotyped for HLA-E alleles using PCR-SSP.
Results: Plasmatic sHLA-E was increased in EC patients compared to
controls (p<0.0001) with respective mean of 1798 ± 47.96 pg/ml and 2.66
± 1.93 pg/ml. However, no significant associations were observed be-
tween plasmatic sHLA-E and EC clinical and histopathological findings.
Also, the polymorphism E* 01: 01/01: 03 of the HLA-E gene does not
seem to contribute to the predisposition to endometrial cancer and its
spread in our population.
Conclusion: Our data strengthen the implication of sHLA-E molecules in
tumour transformation especially in endometrial cancer.

Solitary fibrous tumour of the uterine cervix: a case report and re-
view of the literature
J. Filipe*, M. Côrte-Real, T. Margarida, M. Bernardino, A. Félix, F.
Cunha, J. Ferreira
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Instituto Português de Oncologia de
Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Lisbon, Portugal
Background & objectives: Solitary fibrous tumours (SFT) rarely in-
volve the female genital tract, where they can be found more frequently
in the vulva. In the cervix, six cases have been described. We report a case
of cervical SFT along with a literature review.
Methods: A 48-year-old woman with genital haemorrhage performed
MRI which showed an exophytic cervical tumour. Biopsy was initially
interpreted as an undifferentiated malignant neoplasm and the patient
underwent chemo-radiotherapy without improvement and was sent to
our institution. Biopsy material was reviewed and the diagnosis of SFT
was rendered. Three months after surgery, she is alive and well.
Results: On biopsy, a mesenchymal neoplasm with cells with indistinct
borders with oval nuclei and scant cytoplasm immersed in a collagenous
stroma was observed. Neoplastic cells were positive for CD34, CD56,
CD99 and STAT6 and negative for cytokeratins, muscle markers, CD10
and ALK. During surgery, a nodular lesion on the vaginal wall attached to
the cervix by a pedicle was seen. Total hysterectomy with bilateral
adnexectomy and partial vaginectomy were performed. Grossly, a firm
3cm greyish nodule was observed. The neoplasm had hypo and
hypercellular areas with hyalinized staghorn-like vessels. No cytological
atypia, or necrosis were observed and 1 mitosis/mm2 was counted. A
final diagnosis of a low-risk SFT was rendered.
Conclusion: Due to their rarity, the diagnosis of SFT in the cervix can be
challenging. Differential diagnosis in this location includes benign and
malignant entities such as muscle tumours, endometrial stromal neo-
plasms, and other mesenchymal neoplasms, such as inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumours. Except for one, all cases reported to date have
been benign. Awareness of the existence of this neoplasm in rare loca-
tions such as the cervix can improve its recognition and thus, enable the
correct diagnosis and treatment.

Background & objectives: Yolk sac tumour (YST) is a malignant tu-
mour originating from germ cells and mainly arising from the gonads.
Extragonadal development is uncommon (5% of cases). We present a rare
case of primary endometrial YST.
Methods: A 69-year-old female patient was admitted for post-
menopausal vaginal bleeding investigation. Ultrasound examination
showed significant thickness of the endometrium with a polypoid appear-
ance and a total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was
performed. Six months later a pelvic lympadenectomy was performed
due to para-aortic lymph node enlargement.
Results: Histopathological examination revealed a tumour arising from
an atrophic endometrial polyp and infiltrating the 2/3 of the myometrium
with mixed neoplastic population. The predominant component (account-
ing for 70%) was a YST, which consisted of polygonal cells with solid
and diffuse growth pattern. The rest (30%) was a high-grade clear cell
carcinoma. The para-aortic lymph nodes were also infiltrated (90% YST
predominance). Immunohistochemical staining regarding the YST cells
was positive for Panceratin, CAM5.2, AFP, CEA, HepPar1 (focally), and
negative for EMA, CK7, CD15, CD30. The clear cell carcinoma showed
positivity for CK7, EMA, p53, p16, WT1. The Ki-67 mitotic index was
>80%.
Conclusion: Primary endometrial YST is a very rare malignancy with
only 30 cases reported in the literature; recently added in the newest
WHO Classification of Female Genital Tumours (5th edition, 2020).
The patient age range is 24-87 years. They present either as pure YST
tumours or in coexistence with endometrial carcinoma. The histogenesis
includes somatic carcinoma differentiation, residual foetal tissue origina-
tion and germ cell migration.

*Pathology Department, Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Centro
Hospitalar e Universitário Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Carcinosarcoma is a biphasic tumour com-
posed of a high-grade carcinomatous and sarcomatous components. This
Virchows Arch
is a rare gynaecological malignancy and it is rarely found in the fallopian
tube, therefore, not much is known about its biological behaviour.
Methods: We conducted a 20-year-retrospective transversal study (2000-
2020) at Coimbra University Hospital, a tertiary hospital in Portugal and
reviewed all fallopian tube carcinosarcomas (n=4). Relevant clinical and
pathological data was extracted from the hospital database.
Results: The median age at diagnosis was 60,5 years (37-72 years). After
a median follow-up of 111.8 months, two of the patients were alive and
clinically free of disease; one patient died due to disease progression 33
months after surgery; the remaining patient died of unrelated causes after
137 months. The surviving patients were staged as pT1a and pT1b.
Tumour median size was 13cm (3-20cm). Regarding morphology, the
epithelial component was undifferentiated in two, serous in two and
endometrioid in one. The sarcomatous component exhibited chondroid
differentiation in two, one of them displaying also striated muscle
differentiation.
Conclusion: Fallopian tube carcinosarcoma is a rare entity, with a poorly
understood biological behaviour, due to its rarity. Early detection and
surgical removal may be the keys for a successful treatment.

Mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma of the ovary: a case report
H. Gunel*, G. Kir
*Istanbul Medeniyet University Prof. Dr. Suleyman Yalcin City Hospital
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma (MNL-
AC) is a rare, recently described tumour occurring in the uterine corpus
and ovary which exhibits the same morphological and immunohistochem-
ical features with the mesonephric adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix.
Methods: A 63-year-old woman patient presented with abdominal swell-
ing. The computed tomography(CT) showed a 30× 27 cm multicystic
mass on the right ovary. She underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection,
and omentectomy.
Results: On gross examination, the cut-surface of the ovarian mass
contained solid and cystic structures with a yellowish-tan appearance. On
histologic examination there was an admixture of various growth patterns
with tubular, glandular, papillary, and solid architectures. Tubular and pap-
illary growth patterns were predominant. Intraluminal hyaline-like eosino-
philic material was also seen in some tubules. Tumour cells had typically
vesicular chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and crowding; mitotic activity
was low. By immunohistochemistry, tumour cells stained positive for
Pax8, Gata-3, TTF-1 and CD10(luminal staining) whereas stained totally
negative with ER, PR and WT-1. p53 exhibited “wild-type” immunoreac-
tivity. Loss of PTEN and ARID1A weren’t detected. Mismatch repair
proteins were intact. The final diagnosis was mesonephric-like adenocarci-
noma of the ovary with a FIGO stage IA.
Conclusion: MNL-ACs are one of the uncommon malignancies of the
ovary and the clinical behaviour of these tumours are uncertain. Better
understanding of the clinical and pathological features of these tumours
avoids misdiagnosis and mistreatment.

KRAS-mutated mesonephric adenocarcinomas of the uterine cervix
with MLH-1 methylation, coexisting with uterine low grade
endometrioid carcinoma: a rare case report
H. Gunel*, G. Kir
*Istanbul Medeniyet University Prof. Dr. Suleyman Yalcin City Hospital
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Mesonephric adenocarcinomas (MNAC)are
rare, aggressive tumours of the female genital tract often associated with
mesonephric remnants/hyperplasia. It is characterized by recurrent
KRAS-mutations and lack of PIK3CA/PTEN-alterations. In addition to
the KRAS-mutation, we present a case of MNAC of the uterine cervix
with methylation of MLH-1.
Methods: A 49-year-old woman patient presented with atypical vaginal
bleeding. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) showed a 66 ×
48 mm enhancing mass extending to the uterus at the level of the cervix.
She underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oopho-
rectomy, bilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection, and
omentectomy. Gross examination showed an infiltrating mass in the cer-
vix, measuring 7x5x4 cm, with extension to the uterine corpus.
Results: Cervical component of the tumour consisted of tubular glands,
many with intraglandular villous papillae, lined by one or several layers
of columnar cells resembling endometrial glands on histological exami-
nation. Immunohistochemically this tumour was diffusely positive with
PAX8,GATA3,TTF1 and CD10(luminal staining).p53 exhibited “wild-
type” immunoreactivity while oestrogen receptor (ER)and progesterone
receptor (PR)were negative. The uterine component of the tumour exhib-
ited low grade endometrioid carcinoma morphology with different im-
munohistochemical profile.ER and PR were positive in the endometrioid
component. Immunohistochemical loss of MLH-1,PMS-2,PTEN and
ARID1A were seen in both tumour components. In addition MLH-1
promoter methylation was detected in two components by methylation
specific polymerase chain reaction(PCR).Genomic alterations were iden-
tified in KRAS p.(G12D) by PCR.
Conclusion: The final diagnosis was mesonephric adenocarcinoma of the
uterine cervix coexisting with uterine low grade endometrioid carcinoma
with a FIGO stage IBII. Mesonephric adenocarcinomas are one of the rare
subtypes of cervical tumours. We described a KRAS-mutated MNAC of
the uterine cervix with MLH-1 methylation, coexisting with uterine low
grade endometrioid carcinoma. This was the first case of MNAC with
MLH-1 methylation as far as we are aware from English literature.

An early stage ovarian carcinosarcoma and its association with pri-
mary tubal carcinoma
I. Guzelis*, S. Yigit, A. Yildiz
*Izmir Katip Celebi University Pathology Department, Turkey
Background & objectives: Ovarian carcinosarcoma (OCS) is a rare form
of ovarian cancer, the occurrence of carcinosarcoma in association with
synchronous tubal carcinoma is uncommon. OCS are usually advanced-
stage tumours at the time of diagnosis.
Methods: A 55-year-old postmenopausal patient presented with a
pelvic mass. Ultrasonography revealed bilateral ovarian masses, at
right 10cm and at left 6cm. Intraoperative consultation of the right
unilateral-salpingo-oophorectomy specimen had resulted in a bor-
derline serous tumour that is suspicious of invasion. The patient
underwent total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oopho-
rectomy, and partial omentectomy, bilateral pelvic and para-aortic
lymph node dissection.
Results: Both ovarian masses were composed of biphasic malignant
components. The epithelial component was high-grade serous carci-
noma (HGSC) characterized by solid sheets and complex papillary
architecture. The mesenchymal component was high-grade pleomor-
phic and spindle cell sarcoma. Immunohistochemically carcinoma-
tous component was cytokeratinAE1/AE3(+), P53(+), and P16(+);
the sarcomatous component was P53(+), P16(+) and Vimentin(+).
The right fallopian tube showed an HGSC with an adjacent focus of
serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC). The right tubal HGSC
and adjacent STIC also showed P16 and P53 abnormal expression.
The tumour was limited to both ovaries and fallopian tubes with
benign peritoneal washing cytology and no sign of lymph node or
far organ metastasis (Stage1b:T1bN0M0).
Conclusion: The patient had 6 cycles of chemotherapy using paclitaxel
and carboplatin. As OCS is known to have a %15-30 5-year survival rate,
our patient is disease-free in her 19-month follow-up. As the fallopian
Virchows Arch
tube has recently been proposed to be an origin for a majority of pelvic or
ovarian HGSC, tubal carcinoma may be the origin for OCS through an
epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

Primary uterine angiosarcoma. A case report.
M.C. Jironda Gallegos*, M. Lozano Sánchez, J.C. Maañón Di Leo
*A.P.E.S COSTA DEL SOL MARBELLA, Spain
Background & objectives: Uterine angiosarcoma is a rare and extremely
malignant vascular tumour with a poor prognosis. It occurs in perimeno-
pausal and postmenopausal women, with few cases described in the lit-
erature. We report a case localized in the uterine corpus.
Methods: We report a case of a 53-year-old woman with an intermittent
uterine bleeding for two years without a history of prior pelvic radiation.
Magnetic resonance imaging and abdominal computed tomography dem-
onstrated a well defined 26 cm uterine mass localized in the corpus with a
depth of myometrial invasion more than 50%. Radical histerectomy with
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed.
Results: Macroscopic examination revealed a uterine cavity filled with a
solid tumour measuring 25x20x15 cm. The cut surface was grey with
large haemorrhagic and necrotic areas. Microscopic examination showed
an extensive infiltration of the myometrium by anastomosing abortive
vascular channels and some solid sheets of spindled and epithelioid cells
with marked pleomorphism and hyperchromatic nuclei with mitotic fig-
ures. Extensive foci of haemorrhagic necrosis were observed and molec-
ular analysis was not possible. Immunohistochemically the tumour cells
were diffusely positive for CD31 and FLI1 and focally positive for CD34
and CyclinD1. D2-40, CD10, SMA, desmin, caldesmon, progesterone
and oestrogen receptor were negative. The patient was lost to follow up
after surgery.
Conclusion: Uterine angiosarcoma is an infrequent tumour derived from
vascular endothelial cells. It usually presents in postmenopausal women
as rapidly growing uterine mass and can also arise after pelvic radiaton or
rarely in a leiomyoma. The diagnosis depends mainly on the histopatho-
logical examination and immunohistochemical stains. Breakages at
YWHAE, NUTM2A and NUTM2B loci have been detected in some
cases of uterine angiosarcoma and may contribute to a better understand-
ing of the pathogenesis.Our case was lost to follow up after surgery.

Clear cell borderline tumour of the ovary. A case report.
M.C. Jironda Gallegos*, M. Lozano Sánchez, F. Fernández Gutiérrez del
Álamo
*A.P.E.S COSTA DEL SOL MARBELLA, Spain
Background & objectives: Ovarian clear cell borderline tumours are
extremely rare, comprising less than 1% of borderline ovarian neoplasms.
Differential diagnosis with ovarian clear cell carcinoma is critical, requir-
ing an extended sampling in order to rule out this entity.
Methods: A 73-year-old woman with a clinical history of uterine
leiomyomas treated with total histerectomy and left salpingo-oophorec-
tomy. The patient presented with acute heart failure and pelvic pain.
Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed a mild bilat-
eral pleural effusion and a 18 cm mass in the right adnexal space. Frozen
sections were negative for malignancy.
Results: Gross findings revealed a lobulated circumscribed mass attached
to fallopian tube measuring 18x14.5x11 cm with intact capsule. The cut
surface was firm and yellowish with fibrous tracts and simple cysts in a
honeycomb pattern. Microscopic examination showed a fibrocollagenous
background with calcifications and abundant glands in a irregular distri-
bution with single layer epithelium and clear-eosinophilic cytoplasm with
dense luminal secretion. The more crowded glandular areas showed
hyperchromatic nuclei with moderate atypia and visible nucleoli. Not
endometriosis, lymphovascular invasion, stromal desmoplasia or necrosis
were found. Immunohistochemically the glandular component was pos-
itive for CK7, Napsin-A, racemase, ARID1A and PAX8 and negative for
oestrogen and progesterone receptor. KRAS or BRAF mutations were not
carried.
Conclusion: Clear cell borderline tumours of the ovary are relatively
uncommon. They are frequently associated with ovarian endometriosis
as an underlying precursor. Because of the common association with clear
cell carcinomas, it is advisable a carefully macroscopic examination and
an extensive sampling to rule out this entity. In the present case, we didn´t
find criteria for invasion nor transition clear cell carcinoma nor endome-
triosis after a very extended sampling. The neoplasm showed retention of
nuclear immunoreactivity with mismatch proteins.

Korfias, C. Iavazzo, K. Kokkali, D. Haratsi, O. Tzaida
*"Metaxas" Memorial Cancer Hospital, Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: Vulvar Paget’s disease, primary or secondary,
is a rare malignancy, with problematic treatment, due to its multi-focal
nature and frequent relapses. We report a case of primary vulvar Paget’s
disease with multiple recurrences and focal, incipient, dermal infiltration.
Methods: A 76 year-old female with a history of pT1N0(sn) [ER(+),
PgR(+), HER-2(-)] ductal (NST) breast cancer was admitted to our hos-
pital due to a vulvar lesion. Imaging tests were insignificant. The lesion
was surgically abscised. Pathology report showed primary Paget’s dis-
ease of the vulva. The patient had three recurrences within one year, all
treated with local surgical excision.
Results: All four surgically resected specimens were identical under the
microscope. Histopathologic examination revealed an intraepidermal, ep-
ithelioid neoplasm consisting of small clusters or single cells with mod-
erate nuclear atypia and abundant eosinophilic or amphophilic cytoplasm
(pagetoid spread) virtually reaching the lateral borders of the specimens.
In one case focal, incipient, dermal infiltration was observed and con-
firmed immunohistochemically. The neoplastic cells were positive for
CK7, EMA, mCEA,GCDFP-15, HER-2(3+), MUC5AC, AR and nega-
tive for ER, PgR, S100, HMB-45, p63. The morphological and immuno-
histochemical findings were compatible with primary Paget’s disease of
the vulva.
Conclusion: Although Paget’s disease of the vulva has been described
over 100 years ago still remains a largely confusing, rare disease, difficult
to handle and treat. It may be misdiagnosed or belatedly diagnosed.
Surgery, traditionally considered standard treatment has been disappoint-
ing with positive margins and recurrence rates more than 50%. Moreover
wide local resection causes major morbidity and functional defects. Non-
surgical treatments like radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, local che-
motherapy and laser ablation are under consideration. Our patient remains
under medical attendance.

Morphological basis for predicting recurrent endometrial
hyperplasia
E. Kazachkov*, A. Zatvornickaya, E. Kazachkova, E. Voropaeva
*South Ural State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: The endometrium hyperplasia (EH) problem
remains current today. Endometrium immunohistochemical features in
EH became the basis for predicting the recurrence of EH. Justify predic-
tion of EH without atypia recurrence based on endometrium morpholog-
ical features.
Methods: The pilot study included 45 women with EH without atypia.
On the basis of endometrium Ki-67 and p16INK4a expression patients
were divided depending on the EH recurrence risk. At increased EH
Virchows Arch
recurrence risk (n=15) the therapy corresponded to the developed algo-
rithm. Therapy of patients without increased EH recurrence risk (n=15)
and control group patients (n=15) corresponded to the generally accepted.
Results: In the therapy based in the endometrium p16INK4a and Ki-67
expression at 6 months later the endometrium corresponded to the secretion
phase middle stage, a statistically significant decrease in the endometrium
p16INK4a and Ki-67 expression was recorded, including patients with a
high EH recurrence risk. In control group an endometrium p16INK4a and
Ki-67 expression was decreased in 66.7% of patients, in 26.7% of women
the p16INK4a and Ki-67 expression didn’t decrease. In the therapy based in
the endometrium p16INK4a and Ki-67 expression at 12 months later endo-
metrium corresponded to the secretion phase middle stage, unlike in control
group women, where in 26.7% of patients showed EH without atypia.
Conclusion: The established morphological patterns of the increased EH
recurrence risk - a change in the endometrium p16INK4a and Ki-67
expression - made it possible to develop an algorithm for a personalized
approach to the patients of reproductive age with EH without atypia. The
developed algorithm for the management of EH patients allows reducing
the recurrence rate by 37% ((15:11) / (15:15) = 1.37) compared to the EH
patients management, generally accepted today.

Primary uterine Ewing sarcoma: case report
E. Kilic Bagir*, A. Tas, A. Acikalin, T. Toyran, G. Akyol, D. Gumurdulu
*Cukurova University medical school pathology department, Turkey
Background & objectives: Ewing sarcoma (ES) is rarely seen in the
female genital tract, mostly seen in bone or soft tissue. We aimed to
discuss the case diagnosed uterine Ewing sarcoma with histopathological,
immunohistochemical and Fluorescent in situ hybridization findings.
Methods: A 46-year-old patient with abdominal and pelvic pain was
diagnosed with myoma uteri by physical examination; total abdominal
hysterectomy + bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed.
Results: Macroscopic examination, 10x10x8 cm mass located on the pos-
terior wall of the uterus was observed. In the microscopic examination,
tumour consisting of monotonous small round cells with narrow cytoplasm
separated by a fibrous septa, solid nests, frequent mitotic activity and ne-
crosis was observed. immunohistochemically tumour cells; CD10, CD56
and CD99 positive; H-caldesmon was focal positive, S100, chromogranin,
synaptophysin, calretinin, inhibin, keratin, cyclin D1, desmin, LCA and
TLE-1 were negative. In order to confirm the diagnosis, t (11; 22) (q24;
q12) gene translocation was performed by FISH method and was found to
be positive. Based on histopathological, immunohistochemical and FISH
data, the case was diagnosed primary uterine Ewing Sarcom.
Conclusion: Ewing sarcoma is an extremely rare malignancy of the female
genital tract, mostly seen in children and adolescents. While making the
diagnosis, it is important to exclude the entities (such as lymphoma, small
cell carcinoma) in the differential diagnosis. The t (11; 22) (q24; q12) found
in approximately 85% of the cases was also detected in our case. It is
important to support the diagnosis with FISH in cases with suspected
Ewing sarcoma with histopathological and immunohistochemical findings.

Concordance of lymph-vascular space invasion in cervical biopsy
and resection specimens of squamous cell carcinoma
G. Kir*, M. Oral, Z.C. Olgun, H. Cetiner, C.S. Topal, A. Karateke
*Istanbul medeniyet university, Turkey
Background & objectives: According to European Society of
Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO) and European Society of
Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) guidelines the presence of
lymph-vascular space invasion (LVSI) in cervical biopsies requires sen-
tinel lymph node examination for stage IA1 and IA2 cervical cancers.
Methods: In this study we aimed to elucidate the relationship between
LVSI detected in cervical biopsies and the final histopathologic
confirmation of LVSI in hysterectomy specimens for squamous cell car-
cinoma (SCC) with the goal of preoperatively identifying it. A retrospec-
tive pathologic review was performed and thirty-four pathologically con-
firmed SCC patients who underwent preoperative cervical biopsies and
subsequent radical hysterectomies were included.
Results: Presence of LVSI accounted for 2,9% (n=1) of all preoperative
cervical biopsies and 41,2% (n=14) of all resection specimens. One cer-
vical biopsy in which the presence of LVSI was detected correlates with
the final resection specimen, therefore the positive predictive value is
100.00%. Preoperative cervical biopsy specimens were associated with
a poor sensitivity (7,1%; 95%CI: 0.18%-33.87%), and moderate negative
predictive value (60,6%; 95%CI: 57.09%-64.02%), for the determination
of LVSI in the final resection specimen.
Conclusion: The lack of identification of LVSI in preoperative cervical
biopsies does not guarantee that LVSI will be absent in the final hyster-
ectomy specimens. Therefore cervical biopsies lack sufficient negative
predictive value for LVSI for SCC seen in hysterectomy specimens.

Case report of somatic malignant transformation of mature ovarian
teratoma: a rare, but unfavourable occurrence
A.-A. Lazar*, A. Neicu, R.M. Pridie
*Titu Maiorescu University, Romania
Background & objectives: Malignant somatic transformation of ovarian
mature teratomas occurs in only 2% of cases. We aim to present the case
of a 69-year-old female admitted for hypogastric pain due to an adnexal
mass invading the sigmoid colon and small intestine.
Methods: We received a fresh surgical specimen of 23/18/16 cm, includ-
ing total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy together
with sigmoidectomy and partial enterectomy. The specimen revealed a
16/16 cm left adnexal mass, adherent to the digestive segments, with
cystic transformation, containing necrotic sebaceous material and hair,
along with a yellow-grey solid area in cyst’s wall of 10/9/3 cm, suggest-
ing a malignant teratoma.
Results: Histological examination revealed classic components of
mature teratoma: keratinized epithelium, sebaceous, sweat and sali-
vary glands, hair follicles, respiratory epithelium, hyaline cartilage
and thyroid follicles. The solid area revealed proliferation of atypical
squamous cells with areas of keratinization, extensive necrosis, abun-
dant mixed inflammatory infiltrate, lymphovascular and perineural
invasion. There was massive carcinomatous infiltration into the
muscularis propria of the colon and, respectively, into the submucosa
of the small bowel, also showing necrosis and perineural invasion.
Colon surgical margins were tumour-free. The contralateral ovary
had no abnormality. Immunohistochemistry confirmed squamous
phenotype: tumour cells expressed p63 and 34BE12, with lack of
p16, CK7 and CK20 expression. At follow-up, the patient developed
liver metastasis.
Conclusion: The histopathological and immunohistochemical features
were consistent with keratinizing squamous carcinoma G2 arising from
mature ovarian teratoma. Although the event is rare, finding a solid ne-
crotic nodule in a large dermoid cyst wall, at postmenopausal age, should
raise suspicion for malignancy. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most
frequent associated histological subtype. Extra-ovarian spread indicates
poor prognosis, therefore studies are required to early identify patients at
risk and to evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapy as an adjuvant tool for
advanced disease.

A case of undifferentiated carcinoma of the uterus with rhabdoid
features resembling SMARCA4-deficient uterine sarcoma
C. Leblebici*, B. Noyan, S. Baykal Koca
*University of Health Science Istanbul Training and Research Hospital,
Turkey
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Undifferentiated carcinoma of the uterus and
SMARCA4-deficient uterine sarcoma may show morphological overlap.
SMARCA4-deficient uterine sarcoma is a recently defined neoplasm
which has rhabdoid features and loss of expression of SMARCA4.
Methods: A 46-year-old woman presented with vaginal bleeding, ab-
dominal pain and fever. Computed tomography showed a mass located
in the uterine corpus that may be compatible with an abscess or hematoma
of about 110x80 mm in size. Emergency surgery (total abdominal
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) was performed.
Results: In histological examination, the tumour in endometrium showed
diffuse infiltration into the myometrium. It was composed of sheets-like
arrangement of large atypical epithelioid cells with rhabdoid morphology.
Extensive necrosis and lymphovascular invasion observed.
Immunohistochemical stains revealed negative staining with
pancytokeratin, ER, PR, CD34, desmin, H-caldesmon, and Pax8; focal
patchy staining with EMA, S100, SMA and CD10. A wild-type p53 im-
munostaining obtained. SMARCB1(INI1), SMARCA4(BRG1), MSH2
and MSH6 expressions were retained, although the tumour cells showed
loss of expressions of MLH1 and PMS2. The tumour invaded directly
cervix uteri and serosa. Also several metastatic nodules were detected in
bilateral adnexal tissues. The patient died one month after her surgery.
Conclusion: Final diagnosis was undifferentiated carcinoma of the endo-
metrium with rhabdoid features. It is critical to distinction between undif-
ferentiated carcinoma with rhabdoid features from SMARCA4 uterine
sarcoma. Mismatch repair deficiency and intact SMARCA4 expression
are useful tools in differentiating between them.

Rare non-epithelial gynaecologic tumours: review of five cases that
pose current challenges
S. Marcos González*, J. Alcacer García, M. Díaz Palacios, L. Aguilar
Bartual, D. Kuznecova, S. Alandes Esteve, N. Colomer Soto, I. Caudet
Pratz, R. Sánchez Pacheco
*HUMV/IDIVAL, Spain
Background & objectives: More than 50% of gynaecological tumours
are “rare” (≤6/100,000 women), it refers mostly to non-epithelial sub-
types, encompass >30 histological variants and few patients. Hence the
difficulty for diagnosis. Our review provides key points with the aim of
fighting this ailment.
Methods: Five cases diagnosed in the last 6 years below:
A: 52 y/o. Endocervical polyp recurrence after 2 months. Polypectomy.
B: 62 y/o. Hyperandrogenism without known tumour. Bilateral
adnexectomy.
C: 2 y/o. Fever, abdominal pain, CT: 11 cm ovarian tumour, αFP: 20;
CEA125: 770. Adnexectomy.
D: 41 y/o. Endometriosis. Hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy.
E:19 y/o. Solid ovarian tumour. Oophorectomy.
Results: A: polypoid architecture, normal epithelium, fibromyxoid stro-
ma, mild-atypical spindle cell groups, hyaline cartilage. 11 mitoses/10
CGA. CD10(+), Actin-Myosin(-), Ki67:40%. Adenosarcoma with heter-
ologous hyaline cartilage.
B: yellow ovarian tumour. Polygonal cells, central nuclei with nucleolus,
eosinophilic-granular-vacuolated cytoplasm (lipid rich). No Reinke crys-
tals. Inhibin(+), Vimentin(+), Melan-A(+), Calretinin(+), CKAE1-
AE3(-), Ki67:3%. Steroid cell tumour.
C: polycystic ovarian tumour. Intracystic papillary- extracystic retiform pro-
jections, Sertoli (CK+, Inhibin and EMA-) and Leydig cells (Calretinin+),
oedematous stroma (Vimentin+). Sertoli-Leydig Cell Tumour.
D: Fallopian tube incidentaloma. Epithelioid cell cords/nets, monotonous
nuclei, eosinophilic cytoplasms. Calretinin(+), Vimentin(+), EMA(-).
Wolffian tumour.
E: nodular architecture, no-atypical mixed cell nests, oedematous stroma,
dilated vessels. Inhibin(+), Calretinin(+), Melan-A(+), Estrogens/proges-
terone(+), EMA(-), Ki67:3%. Sclerosing stromal tumour.
Conclusion: - Rare tumours cause >25% of cancer mortality and in all of
them a correct pathological diagnosis is important to guide to a correct
treatment and a potential better result.
- Mortality rates are high due to the current lack of understanding of the
pathophysiology.
- Studies such as molecular testing and circulating tumour-specific bio-
markers are promising, but further research will be needed.
- The knowledge of the anatomopathological characteristics of these tu-
mours remains the most reliable for the diagnosis.

Uterine leiomyosarcoma with areas resembling giant cell tumour of
soft tissues
Á. Nagy*, B. Scheich, K. Dezső, A. Rókusz
*Semmelweis University 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental
Cancer Research, Hungary
Background & objectives: The presence of osteoclast-like giant cells in
uterine leiomyosarcomas is a rare phenomenon. We describe a uterine
leiomyosarcoma with areas resembling giant cell tumour of soft tissues.
The latter component showed signs of malignancy as well.
Methods: A 55-yr-old postmenopausal woman presented with vaginal
bleeding. From D&C material the diagnosis of giant cell tumour with
malignant features was given. Pelvic ultrasound showed an intrauterine
polypoid mass measuring 60 mm in diameter. Staging CT revealed no
distant metastases. The patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy,
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and sentinel lymph node dissection.
Results: Grossly an 80 mm large well-defined, polypoid, tan-grey solid
mass filled the uterine cavity and infiltrated the myometrium. The cervix,
adnexa and sentinel lymph nodes were unremarkable. Histologically the
predominant component was a leiomyosarcoma mainly with
pleiomorphic morphology. Other parts of the tumour were composed of
mononuclear cells intermingling with osteoclast-like giant cells, corre-
sponding to the tumour seen in the D&C material. Here the mononuclear
cells showed moderate nuclear atypia and frequent atypical mitotic fig-
ures were seen. The giant cell component showed vascular invasion. The
two distinct patterns had mainly sharp borders but scattered osteclast-like
giant cells were also seen in the leiomyosarcoma areas.
Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, only a few cases of uterine
leiomyosarcoma with giant cell tumour component have been reported so
far in the literature. It is uncertain that these tumours are composite tumours
with dual differentiation (leiomyosarcoma and giant cell tumour) or simply
uterine leiomyosarcomas with the presence of osteoclast-like giant cells.

*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Buschke-Löwenstein's tumour (TBL), or gi-
ant condyloma acuminata is a rare and poorly defined epithelial tumour.
This disease is sexually transmitted by the human papillomavirus. Vulvar
localization is rare. We report one case of TBL with cervical, vaginal and
vulvar localization.
Methods: We report the case of a 28-year-old patient with a history of
type 1 diabetes on insulin discovered 5 months ago following a urinary
tract infection. She has been married for 10 months and she is consulting
for vulvar lesions.
Results: The clinical examination showed brownish coloured budding and
vegetative lesions spread over the vulva, the peri-anal region, the vaginal
wall and on the cervix. A cervico uterine smear showed low-grade
intraepithelial lesion related to HPV virus. Pathological examination of
the biopsies concluded that the tumour was a Buschke-Löwenstein tumour.
Virchows Arch
The vulvar mucosa was lined with a hyperplastic acanthopapillomatous
coating topped by a large ortho and para-keratotic horny layer. Numerous
koilocytes are present in the superficial layers. The chorion had a discrete
mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate. The patient underwent extensive sur-
gical resection of the tumour and was followed in our outpatient clinic for
two years without any signs of tumour recurrence.
Conclusion: Buschke-Löwenstein's tumour is a sexually transmitted pa-
thology whose causal agent is the papillomavirus. This tumour is respon-
sible for mutilating lesions that can affect the functional prognosis of the
female and male genital organs, hence the interest of early treatment to
avoid giant and disseminated tumours.

A.M. Shaaban
*The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Ovarian cancer is a major cause of female
cancer-related deaths. This study aims to analyse the proportion, density
and distribution of T and B lymphocytes and their prognostic significance
in young women with borderline and malignant ovarian surface epithelial
tumours.
Methods: Clinicopathological and outcome data were collected for 57
women aged ≤50 , diagnosed between 2010 to 2015. Representative
tumour sections were stained for CD3 (T cells) and CD20 (B cells) and
tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) scored following the Immuno
Oncology Biomarker Group recommendations as stromal, intra-tumoral,
aggregates and touching lymphocytes. Data was analysed and correlated
to the clinicopathological variables.
Results: The mean age was 38 years and the most common histological
type was serous carcinoma (n=21). Risk of malignancy index (RMI) and
serum CA125 were significant predictors of ovarian cancer diagnosis
(p=0.02). In total, 15/34 cancer patients died of their disease with no
deaths in the borderline category. There was significantly greater stromal
infiltration of CD3 (p=0.01) and CD20 TILs (p=0.034) and higher
intratumoral CD20 in ovarian cancers compared to borderline tumours.
The highest CD3 infiltration was in serous carcinoma, exhibiting the
highest numbers of CD3 and CD20 aggregates. There was no statistical
difference between touching lymphocytes and tumour subtype. There
was no significant association between TILs and patient survival.
Conclusion: The count, distribution and density of T & B lymphocytes in
ovarian tumours varied by tumour type and invasiveness. Their topo-
graphic distribution, however, did not appear to impact on prognosis in
young women with ovarian cancer. TILs analysis in an older age group is
ongoing to determine its potential prognostic significance.

Malignant Brenner tumour of ovary: a rare case report
Z.C. Olgun*, A. Aydin, H. Seneldir, L. Samadova
*Medeniyet University Prof. Dr. Suleyman Yalcin City Hospital
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Most of the Brenner tumours(BTs) are be-
nign, often incidental findings. Malignant Brenner tumours(MBTs) are rare
that account for less than 5% of all BTs. Here we report a case with MBT.
Methods: 77-year-old female patient with no relevant medical history
presented with abdominal pain and bulk symptoms. Pelvic CT examina-
tion revealed a 17cm left pelvic mass with focal calcifications which was
consistent with subserosal leiomyoma radiologically. The patient had
elevated tumour markers so she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy
and salpingo-oophorectomy. Frozen examination performed and resulted
as MBT.
Results: Pathologic examination revealed a biphasic proliferation of epithe-
lial cells with areas of solid, well-formed nests, which was compatible with
conventional BT morphology, with regions of infiltrative cord-like and single
cell growth, which was interpreted as MBT. Benign component accounted
for 30% and the malignant component accounted for 70% of the tumour.
Cytologically, the tumour showed only mild atypia. Immunohistochemical
studies showed p63 and CK7 positivity and mutation type total loss of p53 for
both components. Well-formed nests were positive with GATA-3, however
invasive areas were negative. The tumour was limited to the right ovary and
staged as pT1a. No evidence of lymph node metastasis was found.
Conclusion: On imaging, these tumours demonstrate nonspecific find-
ings. There is no consistent tumour marker for these tumours, but several
of them can be high. The primary treatment modality is surgical excision.
Due to their rarity, current evidence on the treatment of MBTs are pre-
dominantly limited to case studies and small case series. Therefore, the
precise role and regimen of adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy for MBT
has not been established.

Primary adenocarcinoma of intestinal type of the vulva: an extreme-
ly rare neoplasm
E. Arkoumani, A. Papanastasiou*, C. Sirinian, A. Zizi-Sermpetzoglou
*Department of Biomedical Sciences, Greece
Background & objectives: Primary vulvar adenocarcinoma of the intes-
tinal type is an extremely rare neoplasm with few reported cases in the
literature.
Methods: The patient, a 73-year-old woman, presented with a 2-month
history of a pruritic, painless vulvar mass. On gynaecological examina-
tion, a 3.5cm soft, non-tender grey mass was identified at the labia minora
of the vulva and surgical excision was performed.
Results: The histological examination revealed an invasive, moderately
differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemically, the
tumour cells showed diffuse positive staining for cytokeratin 20,
CDX2, CEA whereas CK7 and GCDFP-15, CA125, ER, PR, TTF1,
NAPSIN were negative. The final pathologic diagnosis was adenocarci-
noma of intestinal type of the vulva. An extensive workup, including
chest X-ray, abdominal and pelvic ultrasound, cervical Pap smear and
systemic positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-
CT) did not reveal any other local malignant neoplasm. In addition, both
colonoscopy and gastroscopy examination were negative, excluding an
adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract.
Conclusion: Primary adenocarcinoma of the vulva is extremely rare, and
its origin remains controversial. There are some reports about the origins
of vulvar intestinal-type adenocarcinoma, which suggest that this tumour
originates from the cloacal remnants. Adenocarcinoma at this specific
anatomical site can originate from sweat glands or present as an adeno-
carcinoma metastasis, but a true primary adenocarcinoma of the intestinal
type is an extremely rare variant at the vulva.

An ovarian somatically derived yolk sac tumour in an 85-year-old
woman with aggressive clinical course and resistance to conventional
chemotherapy regimens: a case report with reference to the
literature
M. Papazian*, K. Iliakopoulos, A. Ieronymaki, P. Tziakou, N. Novkovic,
S. Stasinopoulou, D. Tiniakos
*Aretaieion University Hospital of Athens, Pathology Department,
Greece
Background & objectives: Herein, we report a case of a yolk-sac-
tumour(YST) in an 85-year-old patient, arising in the setting of bilateral
High-grade Serous (HGSC) Ovarian carcinoma and we highlight the
aggressive behaviour of these rare neoplasms that are newly-described
in the literature.
Virchows Arch
Methods: Our patient was diagnosed with ovarian HGSC+omental/peri-
toneal disease(FIGO:IIIC) in 2016,successfully treated with
chemotherapy(Cisplatin-Paclitaxel-Carboplatin)with radiological com-
plete regression. She decided against post-treatment cytoreductive sur-
gery. In 2020, she presented with abdominal pain & bilateral adnexal
tumours. Hysterectomy & omentectomy were performed. The left ovary
was predominantly cystic measuring 9,2cm. Small papillary projections
were observed in the inner wall of the cyst. The right adnexa was involved
by a solid tumour measuring 13cm, with cystic & haemorrhagic areas.
Results: Morphological and immunohistochemical results for the left ovar-
ian tumour were consistent with High-Grade-Serous cystadenocarcinoma.
The right adnexal tumour consisted microscopically of a minor HGSC-
component and a major component reminiscent of YST with character-
istic Schiller-Duval bodies & typical glandular / papillary / reticular &
solid growth patterns. Small foci of mature cartilage and areas of intestinal
& hepatoid differentiation were observed.
Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells stained positive for aFP,
SALL4, CD117, CKAE1-AE3 &also for the “epithelial” markers
Ck7&EMA. CDX2 was positive in the intestinal-like areas and TTF-1
showed cytoplasmic positivity in hepatoid areas. S-100 & synaptophysin
were positive in poorly-differentiated solid areas, indicative of focal neu-
roendocrine differentiation. CD30, PLAP were negative. Based on the
histological & immunohistochemical results, we diagnosed a “somatical-
ly-derived- YST”.
The patient was treated postoperatively with cisplatin-etoposide. She died
of disease 5 months later.
Conclusion: Our case is in keeping with the theory that YSTs in postmen-
opausal women derive from pre-existing epithelial neoplasms through a
process of neometaplasia / retrodifferentiation. This is evidenced by our
patient’s clinical history, histology & the immunophenotypic overlap in
expression of both epithelial and germ-cell markers. We also highlighted
the rapid & fatal progression of the disease upon development of the
retrodifferentiated YST component that remained resistant to post-
surgical chemotherapy. Therefore, we emphasize the highly malignant po-
tential of this group of neoplasms and the need for more targeted therapies.

Endometriosis of rectum mimicking rectal tumour: case report
T. Pasupati Meenakshi*, S. Merilyn George
*Clinipath Sdn Bhd, Malaysia
Background & objectives: Endometriosis of ovaries is a well-known
entity. Rectal endometriosis, presenting with periodical rectal bleeding
is uncommon and always mistaken for an underlying tumour. A case of
rectal endometriosis, suspected clinically to be a GIST tumour of rectum
is documented.
Methods: A 39-year-old female presented with intermittent rectal bleed-
ing. CT scan revealed a rectal mass with constricted lumen. Resected
rectum showed a stricture over the rectum, intramural haemorrhage with
a tract measuring 10mm, located at site of stricture. Overlying mucosa
showed a polypoidal elevation, measuring 15x15mm. The tract contained
altered blood and chocolate coloured material. The adjacent mucosa was
nil remarkable.
Results: H&E sections showed a well delineated haemorrhagic sinus
tract comprising old haemorrhagic material, with no discernible lining
epithelium. Scattered within the muscularis propria and subserosa, a
few endometrial glands, occasionally showing cystic dilatation,
surrounded by compact endometrial stroma was distinctly noted.
Submucosa showed oedematous thickening without presence of endome-
trial glands. Overlying mucosa showed a normal configuration and occa-
sional foci of mild hyperaemic congestion.
Resected mesenteric vascular pedicle showed haemorrhagic congestion
along with presence of endometrial glands and surrounding endometrial
stroma.
No apparent tumour was present.
A diagnosis of rectal endometriosis was confirmed.
Conclusion: Rectal endometriosis can mimic malignancy and can pres-
ent with on and off bleeding episodes. Long standing cases, as like in the
present case can lead to stricture, fibrosis, and formation of sinus tract.
This entity should always be included in persistent rectal bleeding, espe-
cially in young women. A gynaecological consultation and history of
endometriosis is warranted.

Bilateral high-grade serous carcinoma of the fallopian tube with
ovarian and uterine involvement – case report
M. Popa*, T. Enache, M. Olinca, A. Poteca
*Pathology Department, Carol Davila University of Medicine and
Pharmacy Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: We report the case of a 63-year-old woman
presenting with abdominal distention and pain, submitted for surgical
treatment under clinical suspicion of uterine and left tubal tumour. Total
hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy was performed.
Methods: On gross examination the uterine cavity was dilated, filled with
serosal fluid and the isthmus was obstructed by a polypoid tumour of
2cm. The fallopian tubes were enlarged, up to 11cm with solid appear-
ance and serosal effraction for the left salpinx and with multicystic and
papillary tumour of maximum 3cm, for the right one. The ovaries mea-
sured up to 1.5/1/1cm.
Results: Histopathological examination revealed bilateral high-grade se-
rous carcinoma of the salpinges, ovaries and uterine body with extensive
lymphovascular invasion of both salpinges, ovaries, uterine body, param-
eters and pelvic omentum (pT2B). Additional small leiomyoma were
identified in the uterine wall. The cervix was free of tumour. No lymph
nodes were submitted for evaluation. Previous cervical cytology was
negative for this patient.
Conclusion: Concomitant involvement of female genital tract organs by
serous carcinoma is challenging. Dominant tubal mass with minimal
ovarian and uterine disease favours primary salpingeal high-grade serous
carcinoma. Finding associated intraepithelial neoplasia or carcinoma for
origin placement is desirable but it is low to achieve, particularly in
advanced disease. Blockage of fluid drainage from salpingeal tumours
caused by proliferated implanted tumoral cells at the internal os is partic-
ular for this case.

A case of primary signet ring cell cervical adenocarcinoma
I. Prisneac*, P. Bacaj, S. Stolnicu
*Department of Pathology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, USA
Background & objectives: Primary signet ring cell carcinoma of the
cervix (PSRCCC) is a rare form of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the
cervix. PSRCCC is mostly metastatic from gastric, breast, colonic or
ovarian carcinomas. To date, there are 24 reported cases of PSRCCC.
Methods: A 45-year-old woman G1P1 was referred to our hospital in the
setting of recurrent cervical cancer, status post robotic-assisted total lap-
aroscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RATLH/
BSO) in 2019, followed by pelvic radiation and chemotherapy. Recently,
she noticed vaginal bleeding, treated by vaginal cauterization/ablation.
Biopsy demonstrated recurrent/residual adenocarcinoma. In February
2021 patient underwent total pelvic exenteration.
Results: Preoperative PET CT (January 2021) revealed vaginal mass mea-
suring 36 x 25 mm. Microscopic examination showed cells with eccentric
hyperchromatic nuclei and large mucinfilled cytoplasmic vacuolesgrowing
in clusters (signet-ring cells). The neoplastic cells were positive for CK7,
high molecular keratin (34BE12), monoclonal CEA, p16 (strong and dif-
fuse), and CDX2 (focal weak). The tumour was negative for CK20, CK5/6,
p40, synaptophysin and vimentin and showed no PD-L1 expression (CPS <
1). The tumour was positive for HPV 16 genotype. Pelvic wall margins,
Virchows Arch
distal rectal margin, and 8/21 lymph nodes were positive for carcinoma. The
previous biopsies in March 2019 and December 2020 showed similar mor-
phology, immunophenotype and genotype.
Conclusion: PSRCCC is a rare form of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the
cervix. It is associated with recurrence and poor outcome. Awareness of
this entity is important as it can simulate metastatic signet ring cell carci-
noma. Clinical investigations, immunohistological and genetic studies are
essential for differential diagnosis and proper classification. It is difficult
to clarify the tumour biology of PSRCCC and determine the appropriate
therapeutic strategies. In terms of surgery, RATLH is considered superior
to abdominal radical hysterectomy.

Expression of programmed death ligand -1 and mismatch repair
status in endometrial carcinomas
M. Rao*, M. Rajendran, P. Elhence, J. Bharti, P. Singh, G. Yadav
*AIIMS, Jodhpur, India
Background & objectives: Programmed death ligand -1 (PD-L1) is a co-
regulatory molecule which suppresses the local immunity. Mismatch re-
pair (MMR) deficiency has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many
malignancies and has been reported to influence response to anti PD-L1
targeted therapy.
Methods: Expression of PD-L1 and MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2
was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 35 resected cases of
endometrial carcinomas (ECs).
Results: Mismatch repair deficiency was noted in 10 cases (28.6% of the
cases). PD-L1 expression was noted in 48.6% of the cases (17 cases) in
tumour cells and in 65.7% of the cases (23 cases) in the tumour infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs). A statistically significant relation was noted between
MMR deficiency and TILs, PD-L1 expression in tumour cells with TILs,
and PD-L1 expression in tumour cells and extent of myometrial invasion.
No significant relation was seen between MMR status and PD-L1 expres-
sion in tumour cells or in TILs.
Conclusion: Approximately one fourth to one third cases of EC showed
MMR deficiency. Almost half of the ECs showed PD-L1 expression.
However, more studies on a larger sample size are required to study
relation between MMR status and PD-L1 expression in ECs.

Metastases of uterine leiomyosarcoma into the endometrium: a case
report
Y. Rogov*, N. Kornev, Y. Kuzmenka-Maskvina, A. Sheviaka, A.
Syantovich
*Belarusian Medical Academy, Belarus
Background & objectives: The endometrium, as a labile cyclically
renewing structure, is rarely considered as an object of tumour metastasis.
But sometimes the correct assessment of metastatic lesions of the endome-
trium is important to determine the type and location of the primary tumour.
Methods: A 39-year-old female patient was presented with acyclic vag-
inal bleeding. For the past 2 months, she has been taking Gynestril 50 mg
per day for leiomyomas. Clinical examination revealed solid tumour
nodes in the uterus measuring 5.0, 2.0 and 2.0 cm in diameter.
Curettage of the uterine cavity was performed. A total hysterectomy
followed. All material samples were examined separately.
Results: On the background of simple glandular hyperplasia with weak signs
of secretory transformation histological examination revealed small discrete
foci, consisting of polymorphic atypical fusiform cells, with high mitotic
index, chaotically arranged. Immunohistochemical staining them was positive
for caldesmon, desmin, SMA, ER, PR. Metastases of leiomyosarcoma were
suspected. In the tumour nodes, only conventional leiomyomas were found.
But taking into account the metastases, repeated examination of serial sections
of these benign neoplasms revealed an area with reliable signs of
leiomyosarcoma in the largest of them. This was followed by additional
examination to detect metastases in other organs and treatment.
Conclusion: This observation is an additional demonstration that mor-
phological analysis of the endometrium can help in the correct assessment
of myometrial tumours. We did not find descriptions of leiomyosarcoma
metastases in the endometrium in the available literature. The influence of
Gynestril on the ability of leomyosarcoma to metastasize remains contro-
versial. For a year after the operation, the woman is under medical super-
vision and her condition remains stable.

Primary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour of the uterus: a case
report
Y. Rogov*, N. Kornev, A. Syantovich, E. Grigorieva
*Belarusian Medical Academy, Belarus
Background & objectives: In the uterus, no more than 100 cases of an
inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour have been described. The similarity
of this rare tumour with other spindle cell neoplasms (leiomyoma, etc.), the
uncertainty of its malignant potential causes increased attention to it.
Methods: A 45-year-old female patient was hospitalized with recently
appeared acyclic vaginal bleeding. Clinical examination revealed a solid
tumour node in the uterine body measuring 5.0 cm in diameter. A total
hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy followed. The surgical mate-
rial was examined, and tissue samples were investigated histologically
and immunohistochemically.
Results: Grossly, the well-circumscribed submucosal masses had a
white, whorled appearance on cut sections. Microscopic evaluation of
the node revealed an unusual structure. It was consisted of spindle cells
arranged in whorled anastomosing fascicles embedded within a myxoid
stroma and stained paler than leiomyocytes in the adjacent myometrium.
Cells with indistinct cytoplasmic borders were often oriented at an angle
around elongated thin-walled small vessels. In some areas, the tumour
had a storiform pattern and small lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates.
Immunohistochemical staining was positive for Desmin, ALK, ER and
negative for SMA, S100, CD10, CD34, EMA, DOG1, HMB45. The
proliferative index determined by Ki-67 was up to 5%. Primary inflam-
matory myofibroblastic tumour was diagnosed.
Conclusion: We would like to report a case of benign inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumour without infiltrative growth, cytological atypia,
with low proliferative activity as a rare pathology of the uterus. Tumour
features such as interlacing bundles of spindled cells, paler colour of cells
when stained with hematoxylin and eosin in contrast to the surrounding
muscle tissue, small, elongated vessels with fusiform cells around them
and variable inflammatory infiltrations are important to suspect this neo-
plasm, and then to confirm by immunohistochemistry.

Primary endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma with signet ring
cells: a case report and review of the literature
D. Sá*, L. Brochado Ferreira, A. Duarte, F. Costa, J.R. Vizcaíno
*Service of Anatomic Pathology, Hospital Santo António, Centro
Hospitalar Universitário do Porto (CHUP), Portugal
Background & objectives: Signet ring cells can be present in endometrial
metastaticadenocarcinomafromanextra-genitalprimarytumour.However,
some cases of primary endometrial adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells
have been reported. This is among one of the first ten cases reported.
Methods: We report a case of a 76-year-old woman that presented to the
emergency department with postmenopausal bleeding. A vaginal ultra-
sound revealed an endometrial thickness of 9,3mm. The patient
underwent abdominal total hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy.
An intraoperative histologic examination showed an adenocarcinoma
Virchows Arch
invading more than 50% of the myometrium thickness, therefore justify-
ing peri-aortic and peri-iliac lymph node dissection.
Results: The 70g hysterectomy specimen consisted of uterus and cervix
with attached bilateral adnexa. The anterior surface of the endometrium
showed a protruding plaque-like neoplasia measuring 3cm in diameter that
appeared to infiltrate the outer half of the myometrium wall. Endocervix
contained a pedunculated polypoid mass of 1,5cm and was not involved by
the tumour. The adnexa were unremarkable. Microscopic evaluation
showed an endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells
and positive immunohistochemical staining for CK7, ER (focally), PAX-8
and vimentin. An Alcian Blue staining highlighted the mucin content in the
signet ring cells. Metastasis were present in two of the twenty-five dissected
lymph nodes. The endocervix showed an endocervical polyp.
Conclusion: The identification of signet ring cells in an endometrial
adenocarcinoma requires ruling out the more probable hypothesis of a
uterine cervix HPV-associated adenocarcinoma, signet ring cell type or of
a metastatic tumour, mainly from the ovary, breast or the gastrointestinal
tract. The histopathological morphology of endometrioid carcinoma and
the immunohistochemical profile of the neoplasia along with the absence
of a cervix or extra-genital neoplasia support our diagnosis of this rare
entity not yet included in the WHO classification of tumours.

SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated uterine sarcoma: a case report
and review of the literature
D. Sá*, F. Costa, J.R. Vizcaíno
*Service of Anatomic Pathology, Hospital Santo António, Centro
Hospitalar Universitário do Porto (CHUP), Portugal
Background & objectives: SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated uter-
ine sarcoma (SMARCA4-DUS)/malignant rhabdoid tumour of the uterus
is a recently described entity that typically affects younger women and is
morphologically and genetically related to small cell carcinoma of the
ovary, hypercalcaemic type.
Methods: We herein present the case of a 62-year-old woman that pre-
sented to the emergency department with a two month history of post-
menopausal vaginal bleeding. A transvaginal ultrasound showed multiple
myomas and an endometrial thickness of 19 mm. The patient was sub-
mitted to an endometrial curettage.
Results: We received an endometrial curettage specimen weighing 4g
which consisted of irregularly shaped fragments admixed with blood
clots. Histologic examination showed a solid malignant neoplasm com-
posed of diffuse sheets of atypical epithelioid cells with finely vacuolated
cytoplasm, large, round and eccentric nucleus and prominent nucleolus
with extensive necrosis and high mitotic index. Immunohistochemically,
the neoplastic cells were positive for Vimentin, CD34, CD38, SMA
(weak), EMA (weak and patchy) and CD138 (weak and patchy) and were
negative for cytokeratins, neuroendocrine, melanocytic/nerve sheath, ger-
minative, lymphoid, muscular, vascular and mesothelial markers. The
nuclear expression of INI1 and mismatch-repair proteins was preserved,
but there was a loss of expression of SMARCA4.
Conclusion: SMARCA4-DUS are typically aggressive tumours with
lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastasis and distant spread.
Most of them contain rhabdoid/large cell morphology, but spindle cell
and small cell morphology were also described. The inactivation of
SMARCA4 is the main oncogenic driver event. The median survival of
these patients has been reported to be seven months and they should
receive genetic counselling to identify hereditary cancer risk in the family.
Our patient passed away eight months after the initial diagnosis.

Uterine arteriovenous malformation: report of a rare entity
and review of the literature
I. Saguem*, S. Graja, M. Triki, M. Bouhamed, M. Zghal, C. Chaari, T.
Boudawara, M. Mellouli
*Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Uterine arteriovenous malformation
(UAVM) is a rare entity. It can be congenital or acquired. Congenital
UAVM is developed from a defect during embryologic differentiation
leading to abnormal vascular connections. Acquired UAVM occurs sec-
ondary to uterine trauma.
Methods: We report a case of UAVM occurring in a 35-year-old woman
revealed by menorrhagia and severe anaemia.
Results: Tomography showed a uterine arteriovenous malformation in
myometrium and endometrium tissues. A hysterectomy was proposed.
The macroscopic study revealed a thick myometrium with a vascular
lesion that measured 3 cm. Histologically, the lesion was composed of
an admixture of malformed capillaries, arteries, and venules. These struc-
tures had variable sizes and were focally dilated and thrombosed. The
endothelium lining these vessels showed no abnormalities. The patient
was successfully treated with no complications.
Conclusion: UAVM can be asymptomatic or cause irregular uterine
bleeding from abnormal connections between artery and vein. Uterine
artery embolization is effective in treatment with rare complications.
Hysterectomy is a definitive treatment resulting in the resolution of symp-
toms and allows histological examination. Pathologically, the lesion con-
sists of a network of vessels of different proportions and sizes. The vessels
have characteristics of both arteries and veins with prominent fibrous
thickening with some elastin as a result of the high intraluminal blood
pressure.

Adult granulosa cell tumour of the ovary: a study of 10 cases
G. Sarra*, S. Ben Slama, N. Ben Othman, A. Lahmar, D. Bacha
*CHU MONGI SLIM LA MARSA, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Adult granulosa cell tumour (AGCT) ac-
counts for 5% of all ovarian cancers. Their histopathologic features are
nonspecific. The objective of this study was to evaluate clinicopatholog-
ical features and evolutionary characteristics of AGCT.
Methods: This is a retrospective study of ten cases of AGCT of the ovary,
collected in the pathology department of the M. Slim Hospital over a
period of 16 years (2002 to 2017). Evolutionary data were collected from
medical records of the gynaecology department of the same hospital.
Results: The average age of our patients was 58 years. Pelvic ultrasound
allowed objectifying the ovary tumours in 8 cases and CT scans in 2
cases. All tumours were unilateral and confined to the ovary, without
rupture. Seven patients were treated with unilateral adnexectomy and 3
with a hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy. Eight tumours were en-
capsulated with a smooth lobulated surface. Seven tumours were solid
and 3 solid and cystic. Tumour size varied between 8,5 and 25 cm. The
histopathological study allowed us to make the diagnosis in 6 cases. In 4
cases, an immunohistochemistry study was made. No recurrence was
noted with a median follow up of 5 years.
Conclusion: Although the course of AGCT of the ovary is often indolent,
an unpredictable disease course with recurrence rates up to 50%. Then, an
attentive examination of tumour specimens must be done, evaluating
prognostic factors as the stage, nuclear atypia, and tumour size.

Background & objectives: Various body sites can be affected by extrain-
testinal Crohn’s disease (CD), but vulva involvement is a rare condition.
Vulvar lesions are commonly “metastatic” in that they show typical CD
granulomatous inflammation but are not adjacent to the GI involvement.
Virchows Arch
Methods: A 43-year-old woman with a past medical history of ankylos-
ing spondylitis and left hemicolectomy due to large bowel CD presented
to the gynaecology clinic with hardness and oedema in the right vulva.
All haematological, biochemical and immunological findings were with-
in normal range. Tumour markers, viral markers and Mantoux test were
negative. A biopsy of the right labia majora was obtained.
Results: Histopathological examination revealed the presence of a chron-
ic inflammation with formation of noncaseating granuloma and presence
of multinucleated giant cells.
On the basis of the clinical, laboratory and endoscopic data, and the
exclusion of other granulomatous and infectious diseases, the diagnosis
of “metastatic” CD of the vulva was established.
Conclusion: Vulvar CD has been documented in females 8 to 74-year-
old patients, mostly premenopausal. Most of the cases presented at least 6
months after the initiation of GI symptoms, but also on rare occasions
during or even prior to the onset of inflammatory bowel disease.
Since the differential diagnosis of vulvar CD includes all infectious and
non-infectious diseases with noncaseating granulomas, clinicopathologi-
cal correlation including a detailed medical history and a physical exam-
ination is crucial for the confirmation of the diagnosis.

Vulvar sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma: a rare variant
in an unsual location

Karavioti, H.J. Trihia, O. Tzaida
*Metaxa Cancer Hospital Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: While sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma
is a well-documented variant, most commonly of the larynx, only few
cases have been reported in the lower female genital tract.
We present an unusual case of sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma of
the vulva.
Methods: A 77-year-old patient presented to the gynaecology depart-
ment with an aggravated vulvar mass arising from the right labia minora
and eventually underwent a radical vulvectomy with bilateral inguinal
lymph node dissection and bilateral pelvic lymph node sampling.
Gross pathology revealed an ulcerated exophytic tumour arising in the
right labia minora measuring 4.5 cm.
Results: The histopathologic examination revealed a polypoid tumour with
biphasic growth pattern. In the superficial portion, the tumour consisted of
infiltrating keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of intermediate differen-
tiation, whereas in the deeper portion the neoplasm gradually transitioned
into spindle cell sarcoma-like areas. Increased mitotic activity and atypical
mitoses, were noted. The immunohistochemical analysis with the special
markers CKAE1-AE3, CK5/6, EMA, p63, Vimentin, S100, Desmin, SMA
and CD34, revealed the following immunophenotype of the malignant
spindle cell population: CKAE1-AE3(+), p63(+), Vimentin(+), SMA(+)
focally, CK5/6(-), EMA(-), Desmin(-), CD34(-), consistent with
sarcomatoid differentiation. All lymph nodes were free of metastases.
The aforementioned features of the tumour established the diagnosis of
sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma.
Conclusion: To date, only 19 cases of vulvar sarcomatoid squamous cell
carcinoma have been reported.
Most recorded patients were elderly with a rapidly enlarging polypoid
mass. The tumours are often locally advanced at the time of diagnosis with
rapid recurrence, progression and usually associated with a poor outcome.
However, a few patients with early-stage disease have a very long sur-
vival rate highlighting the importance of timely diagnosis and complete
excision of the tumour.

Intravascular leiomyomatosis of the uterus: presentation of two cases
E. Souka*, G. Stanc, G. Galanopoulos, L. Karelis, N. Novkovic, G.
Vorgias, D. Korfias, H.J. Trihia, C. Valavanis
*Metaxa Cancer Hospital Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: Intravascular leiomyomatosis (IVL) is a rare
tumour characterized by intravascular growth of benign smooth muscle
cells with a propensity to extent to the pelvic/broad ligament veins, the
inferior vena cava and even heart and pulmonary vessels.
Methods: Two patients, 48 and 49 years old, presented to the gynaecol-
ogy clinic with menometrorrhagia. A gynaecological ultrasound revealed
tumours with benign mesenchymal features measuring 9cm at the right
parametrium and14cm at the uterus wall respectively. Patients underwent
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The frozen section of
the parametrium tumour was compatible with a benign mesenchymal
tumour.
Results: On gross examination of the first patient’s hysterectomy
with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen, the parametrium tu-
mour had a worm-like configuration, which implied an intravascular
spread from the uterus wall vessels to the parametrium vessels. At the
gross sectioning of the second hysterectomy specimen, we detected
three solid, white, rubbery intramuscular nodules measuring up to
14cm. Microscopic and immunohistochemical examination con-
firmed on both occasions that the tumours were leiomyomas arising
from a large vessel wall.
Conclusion: Even though IVL is a benign slow-growing tumour, it
can have morbid results, when it extends into the heart causing
mechanical obstruction. Thorough work-up can raise the suspicion
of IVL prior to surgery, especially when located at the broad liga-
ment or pelvic veins, in which case the treatment of choice is total
hysterectomy rather than tumour enucleation. Initial pathological
diagnosis of uterus/pelvic IVL is valuable for implementing appro-
priate follow-up and treatment as well as prospective diagnosis of
recurrence.

Mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma arising in presacral teratoma of a
patient with Currarino syndrome

Faistova, J. Laco
*The Fingerland Department of Pathology, University Hospital and
Faculty of Medicine Hradec Kralove, Charles University, Czech
Republic
Background & objectives: Currarino syndrome is a rare congenital syn-
drome characterised by anorectal malformations, sacral anomalies and
presacral teratoma. Rarely, somatic type malignancies may arise in the
latter. However, mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma has not been de-
scribed yet in this context.
Methods: A 39-year-old woman with radiological findings correspond-
ing to Currarino syndrome underwent surgery with removal of presacral
teratoma at the age of 5 years. Thirty-four years later, the patient
underwent spinal surgery due to worsening of local neurological symp-
tomatology. A mass, 15 mm in diameter, was removed from the sacral
area. A comprehensive assessment (immunohistochemistry, NGS) of the
sample was performed.
Results: The archival slides of the original presacral mass showed struc-
tures of teratoma with multiple PAX8+/WT1+/GATA3-/SALL4- meso-
nephric structures including abortive glomeruli and tubules. The mass
removed during the second surgery consisted of a well demarcated tubu-
lar and microfollicular carcinoma composed of uniform, slightly atypical
cuboidal cells with high mitotic rate (19/10 HPFs). Tumour cells
coexpressed cytokeratin 7, PAX8, GATA3 and TTF1, while other
markers were negative (thyreoglobulin, SALL4, RCC, HNF1beta,
cytokeratin 20, neuroendocrine markers). Next generation sequencing
of the tumour did not detect any KRAS mutations. No other tumour
was identified during subsequent PET-CT and detailed radiological
work-up of the patient.
Virchows Arch
Conclusion: The morphology and immunoprofile of the tumour
corresponded to mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma, a rare entity arising
in female genital tract and associated with activating KRAS mutations.
Although adenocarcinomas or neuroendocrine tumours have been seen in
presacral teratoma in Currarino syndrome, mesonephric-like adenocarci-
noma has not been described yet. The primary origin in teratoma is further
supported by the presence of multiple mesonephric structures in the tissue
of the original teratoma and the lack of any tumour elsewhere after the
radiological work-up.

Desmoplastic small round cell tumour - case report
R. Tanasa*, A. Neicu, A. Ene, M.D. Dragomir, M. Badoi
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Desmoplastic small round cell tumours
(DSCRCT) are highly aggressive mesenchymal neoplasms, frequently
involving the serosal surfaces of the abdominal cavity in young males.
They are unique among round blue cell tumours family in terms of his-
tological, immunohistochemical, and karyotypic traits.
Methods: A 19-year-old female presented with ongoing abdominal pain
and distension. CT scan showed bilateral expansive abdominal and pelvic
solid masses replacing the ovaries and numerous disseminated peritoneal
nodules of various dimensions. A smaller pararectal mass was also iden-
tified. Following excisional surgery, representative sections were submit-
ted for histological examination on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
tissue. Routine and immunohistochemical stains were performed.
Results: Histology revealed a proliferation of small, round to oval cells,
some markedly atypic, arranged in a lobular or solid configuration, with a
hypocellular fibrotic stromal reaction. Focal nuclear palisading, rosettes,
cystic and microcystic spaces were present, as well as areas of central
necrosis. Immunohistochemically the neoplastic cells expressed EMA,
Synaptophysin, NST, CD56, Vimentin, and AE1/AE3 in isolated cells.
Some areas of the tumour expressed Inhibin. The cells were negative for
CK7, WT1, TTF1, and CDX2. Three potential differential diagnosis were
taken into consideration: DSCRT, small cell carcinoma of the ovary,
hypercalcaemic type, and adult-type granulosa cell tumour. Desmin stain
showed a paranuclear-dot pattern of expression, suggestive for a DSRCT.
Conclusion: FISH analysis detected EWSR1 gene rearrangements in
74,3% of the cells leading to the final diagnostic of DSCRT. Variations
in cell aspect, architectural patterns, stromal component, and immunore-
activity can occur, leading to diagnostic challenges. DSCRT must be
differentiated from entities like PNET, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblasto-
ma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, mesothelioma, lymphoma, etc. Medical
professionals must be aware of these potential pitfalls and carefully inte-
grate the clinical, imagining, and pathological information. Molecular
biology studies are mandatory for an accurate diagnostic.

Well-differentiated gastric-type adenocarcinoma of the endocervix -
two mirror images of the same entity
R. Tanasa*, L. Ursache, A. Ene, A. Neicu
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Gastric type adenocarcinoma of the
endocervix (GAS) is a rare, non-HPV-related neoplasm showing gastric
differentiation and following an aggressive course. We report two cases
of well-differentiated GAS emphasizing the main pathological features.
Methods: A 75-year-old female, who previously had a total hysterecto-
my with bilateral adnexectomy for a benign lesion. She presented 5 years
later with vaginal bleeding. CT scan showed an iodophile mass replacing
the vaginal cuff, invading the urinary bladder and the perirectal fat. The
second case, a 60-year-old female with similar symptoms, came to our
laboratory for a second opinion.
Results: Both patients underwent biopsy. We performed and analysed
routine and immunohistochemical stains. The HE slides showed a glan-
dular infiltrative proliferation, with variable-sized, slightly angulated tu-
bular structures, encompassed by a desmoplastic stromal reaction. The
neoplastic cells showed clear to pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, basal nuclei
with few conspicuous eosinophilic nucleoli, and focal atypia. In one case
the morphology resembled normal endocervical glands, without the usual
bluish hint of the mucinous cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the neo-
plastic cells showed positivity for MUC5, CK7, CEA, PAX8. P53
showed a mutation-type pattern. ER, PR, p16, CK 20, CDX2 were neg-
ative. Based on morphological and immunohistochemical features, our
diagnostic was well-differentiated gastric-type adenocarcinoma of the
endocervix, HPV-independent.
Conclusion: GAS is characterized by deceptively bland features making
the diagnostic very difficult on small samples like biopsies, conizations.
The pathologist needs to be aware of this rare entity and differentiate it
from both benign and malignant entities: LEGH, endocervicosis,
endocervical tunnel clusters, usual type and clear cell adenocarcinoma,
as well as metastases to the cervix. Scrutiny of subtle histologic findings,
correlated with the immunoprofile and integrated into the clinical history
of the patient, when available, lead to an accurate diagnostic.

Mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma of the ovary; case report
G. Topel*, S. Yigit, S. Sen
*Izmir Katip Celebi University Ataturk Training and Research Hospital
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma (MLA)
has been newly described in the ovary. There are 11 cases of MLA of
the ovary in the literature. This is the first case of MLA coexistent with the
endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EA) of the ovary.
Methods: A 63-year-old woman had postmenopausal bleeding.
Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a malignant mass in the left ovary.
It was sent for intraoperative consultation which was 12x11x8 cm in size,
with a cystic, dirty yellow, haemorrhagic and solid areas on the cut sur-
face. The result was reported as “primary malignant epithelial tumour of
the ovary”.
Results: Histologically the tumour had two epithelial components. The
first component was EA. The other component consisted of
tubulopapillary structures lined by cells with scanty clear cytoplasm, nu-
clear crowding, moderate atypia, vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli.
Histochemically PAS and d-PAS did not show any cytoplasmic staining,
but PAS (+) accumulation was detected in the lumen of the tubules.
Tumour cells were diffuse positive with cytokeratin7, PAX8, GATA3,
TTF1, CD10 (luminal) but focal positive with calretinin and p53. Napsin
A was positive only in isolated cells. ER, PR, WT1 were negative. This
component was diagnosed as MLA. As a result, our case was evaluated as
MLA coexistent with EA.
Conclusion: Although MLA has different histomorphological appear-
ances, it’s a tumour that should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis
when evaluating a tumour with different histologic findings in the ovary.

Combined adenocarcinoma and undifferentiated ca of the cervix and
endometrium, posing differential diagnosis between dedifferentiated
endometrial carcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma with
basaloid features

Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Dedifferentiated carcinoma is composed of
an undifferentiated carcinoma and a juxta-opposed differentiated compo-
nent. Squamous differentiation is a well-recognized feature of endome-
trial carcinomas. Basaloid squamous carcinoma is characterized by small
basaloid cells with often abrupt transition to squamous epithelium and
comedonecrosis.
Methods: A 76-year-old woman presented with postmenopausal bleed-
ing of 3-months duration. D&C was diagnostic of endometrial
endometrioid Ca, grade II. She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy
with bilateral oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy.
Results: In the cervix there was a circumscribed tumour of 1,9X1,7cm,
with central necrosis. The endometrial cavity was filled by a partly pol-
ypoid tumour of 3,7X2X3cm, without obvious connection with the cer-
vical tumour. Both tumours were deeply invasive with similar histologi-
cal features. Tumours were consisting of two juxta-opposed elements,
one more superficial well differentiated adenocarcinoma and one more
deeply-seated solid, extensively necrotic, monomorphic undifferentiated
carcinoma with basaloid features and peripheral palisading. There was
extensive squamous differentiation of the endometrial adenocarcinoma
and abrupt interphase between the two elements in the endometrium,
imparting a biphasic appearance. Scarce abrupt foci of mature squamous
epithelium inside the undifferentiated component were recognized, as
well as LVIs.
Conclusion: Morphologic and immunohistochemical findings were con-
sistent with endometrial adenocarcinoma of dedifferentiated/
undifferentiated type (diffuse positivity in KerAE1/AE3, EMA).
Nevertheless, the morphological appearances of the undifferentiated com-
ponent including the scarce abrupt microscopic foci of mature squamous
epithelium, peripheral palisading and geographic necrosis were reminis-
cent of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma, therefore consistent with
adenosquamous carcinoma of the basaloid type. There is no matching
case report in the literature, nor included in the latest, 5th edition of the
WHO Classification of Female Genital Tumours.

Primary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the endometrium.
An exceedingly rare case
H.J. Trihia*, E. Karavioti, G. Stanc, E. Lianos, I. Provatas, G. Vorgias
*'Metaxas' Memorial Cancer Hospital, Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the
endometrium is very rare, often mistaken for poorly differentiated carci-
noma. Diagnosis is based on the presence of polygonal cells with prom-
inent nucleoli, a NE growth and the expression of at least one NE marker.
Methods: A 71-year-old woman was admitted in our hospital with the
diagnosis of ‘serous’ carcinoma of the endometrium in D&C. MRI re-
vealed an endometrial mass of approximately 3cm, with possible obstruc-
tion of the cervical os. There were no enlarged lymph nodes or elevated
serous tumour markers. She underwent TAH @ BSO, omentectomy and
pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection.
Results: The endometrial cavity was dilated and filled by a haemorrhagic,
friable polypoid mass of 5,5X4X2cm, which was protruding through the
cervical os. Histologically, the tumour was a high grade, undifferentiated
carcinoma, consisting of large, dyscohesive, pleomorphic cells with mod-
erate eosinophilic cytoplasm and enlarged markedly pleomorphic nuclei
with prominent nucleoli. There were few rosette-like formations, brisk
mitotic activity, extensive necrosis and haemorrhage. There was superfi-
cial infiltration of the myometrium and extension to the endocervix, LVIs
and residual atrophic polyp. The tumour cells were diffusely positive in
the three NE markers (synaptophysin, chromogranin, CD56). Omentum
and lymph nodes were free of tumour. The final diagnosis was LCNEC of
the endometrium, FIGO II.
Conclusion: LCNECs of the endometrium are rare, present mostly in the
6-7th decades, with vaginal bleeding, are bulky tumours and tumours
confined to polyps and most likely under-reported. They are characterized
by geographic necrosis and typically strong diffuse cytoplasmic positivity
for NE markers. The later distinguish them from undifferentiated carci-
nomas that exhibit focal NE staining. Their recognition may have an
impact on treatment of these patients. Although LCNEC has an aggres-
sive behaviour, 28% of the patients survive at least 5 years.

Bilateral carcinosarcomas of the ovary: report of two cases with
review of the literature
M. Triki*, M. Walha, O. Boudawara, C. Kammoun, C. Chaari, T.
Boudawara, I. Saguem
*Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Ovarian carcinosarcomas, also called malig-
nant mixed Mullerian tumours (MMMT) are rare variant of ovarian tu-
mours, with few cases reported in the literature. Our aim is to investigate
clinicopathological aspects and prognosis of theses exceptional mixed
Mullerian tumours.
Methods: We report two cases of bilateral ovarian carcinosarcoma, who
were operated on at the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and
diagnosed in the department of Pathology of Habib Bourguiba University
hospital of Sfax, Tunisia. Clinical features, pathological aspects, treat-
ment and outcome were herein described.
Results: The two female patients were aged respectively 45-year-old and
61-year-old. They both presented with clinically suspect pelvic masses. The
first patient underwent hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, and lymphad-
enectomy. The second patient had bilateral adnexectomy with
omentectomy. Macroscopically, the patients had bilateral ovarian involve-
ment with solido-cystic tumours. Histologically, the tumour’s first patient
was composed of an endometriod grade 1 adenocarcinoma (80%) admixed
with an undifferentiated sarcoma with liposarcomatous features (20%). The
tumour was classified pT1c2N0. The tumour’s second patient was com-
posed of a high-grade serous adenocarcinoma (70%) admixed with a stro-
mal sarcoma with rhabdomyosarcoma features (30%). The tumour was
classified pT3cNx. Eight months after the diagnosis the second patient died.
Conclusion: MMMT are very rare accounting for less than 1% of all
ovarian tumours. They are very aggressive tumours that are usually diag-
nosed at an older age compared to women with epithelial ovarian cancer.
These tumours contain both sarcomatous and carcinomatous compo-
nents. The poor prognosis associated with this rare disease, emphasizes
the need for collaborative prospective studies targeted to better under-
stand the molecular changes of theses malignant tumours, and the need
to design new therapeutic regimens to improve patient’s survival.

Background & objectives: Uterine carcinosarcoma is an aggressive bi-
phasic tumour, comprising less than 5% of gynaecological carcinomas,
the mean age being 65. The aim of this study is to analyse the heteroge-
neity of the microscopic and proteomics characteristics of this special
tumour category.
Methods: We report nine cases diagnosed in the last five years in our
hospital. After the microscopical examination, the immunohistochemical
tests were mandatory to support the diagnoses. All data were analysed
depending on demographic characteristics, hormonal status
Virchows Arch
(premenopausal, postmenopausal), as well as diagnostic features, includ-
ing a panel of seven immunohistochemical biomarkers (Ki-67, p53,
SMA, Desmin, Vimentin, AE1/AE3, Cyclin D1).
Results: The age at diagnosis varied between 47 and 87 years old (mean
63 years old), most patients being postmenopausal. Regarding the epithe-
lial component, 77.8% was represented by pure endometrioid carcinoma.
In most cases, the presence only of the homologous component was
observed, represented mainly by fibrosarcoma, while the heterologous
component was given by chondrosarcoma in all cases. Most cases were
diagnosed in stage II with lympho-vascular invasion in four cases and no
perineural invasion. Immunohistochemical results proved the diagnoses
for all cases and highlighted the mutational pattern of p53 biomarker (two
cases with overexpression and null-type pattern of staining for the others).
Conclusion: Our study points out the decreasing age at the time of diagnosis
and the uniqueness of this type of gynaecological tumour governed by the
heterogeneity of morpho-pathological features. Their aggressivity is deter-
mined not only by the variety of epithelial and mesenchymal component,
but also by the presence of genetic mutations. The p53 gene, which is involved
in cell survival, is frequently mutated and is associated with a poor prognosis.
A prompt and correct diagnosis is crucial for improving overall survival.

Vulvar and cervical diseases in patient with immunosuppression - a
case report
B. Vukomanovic Djurdjevic*, S. Glumac, A. Peric, N. Baletic, J.
Trifunovic
*Military Medical Academy, Serbia
Background & objectives: Human papillomavirus(HPV)infection of the
genital tract causes changes in the vulva, vagina and cervix. Local and
general immunity are the defense factors against HPV. People with weak-
ened immune systems are at higher risk of the pathogenic effect of the virus.
Methods: A 25-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
treated by immunosuppressive therapy had control gynaecological exami-
nation and she need treatment of vulvar condyloma. Colposcopy showed
suspected cervical dysplasia. Excision of vulvar lesions was performed.
Results: Pathohistological analysis of vulvar tissue showed more diag-
nosis on different tissue samples of vulvar region: condyloma
accuminatum, moluscum contagiosum and vulvar intraepithelial neopla-
sia grade 3. The cervical lesions corresponded like High-grade SIL. P16
an Ki-67 was intensely positive in all layers of the cervical epithelium.
Conclusion: HPV infection also causes malignant transformations of
vulvar and cervical tissue in cooperation with cofactors, such as decrease
immunity, local and general. Local immunity also is decreased if there is a
competitive non-HPV infection. If there are no adequate clinical controls,
premalignant and malignant changes may be prevented. The
gynaecological examination and HPV typing is required at regular inter-
vals, especially in persons with immunosuppression.

Mature ovarian teratoma degenerates into squamous cell carcinoma
in a young woman: a case report and review of the literature
M. Walha*, I. Bahri, M. Bouhamed, I. Saguem, S. Charfi, L. Ayadi, N.
Gouia, T. Boudawara
*University Hospital of Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Ovarian teratoma is a pathology of the young
women. Its malignant transformation is rare. The aim of this observation
is to report a case of mature degenerated ovarian teratoma in a young
woman and to study its clinicopathological features.
Methods: Reporting the case of a 34-years-old patient presented with a
pelvic mass. On ultrasound examination, it was a mass of the right ovary
with double cystic fatty components. The blood tumour markers (CEA
and CA-125) were normal. The therapeutic decision was an anexectomy
with pathological examination.
Results: At the gross examination, the cut surface of the tumour reveals a
solido-cystic appearance, and cavities filled with fatty material. The solid
part was firm whitish. Histologically, this latter was formed by invasive
nests and sheets of squamous epithelial cells, which are in connection
with superficial atypical squamous-type epithelium. There were conspic-
uous central keratinization. Tumour cells were large, with abundant eo-
sinophilic cytoplasm, very atypical nuclei and numerous mitoses. The
tumour infiltrated massively the adjacent ovarian stroma. There were no
vascular or perineural invasion. The thin cystic wall was made of fatty
and fibrous connective tissue with hair follicles, smooth muscle, and
some thyroid vesicles. These teratomatous structures were mature.
Conclusion: Malignant transformation of mature ovarian teratoma is a
rare event, occur especially in postmenopausal women. Its occurrence in
young patient, as our case is exceptional. The most common tumour
component to undergo malignant transformation is squamous epithelium
(80% of cases), with formation of a typical squamous cell carcinoma. It
can be suspected in view of the association of risk factors and radiological
criteria, but the definitive diagnosis is based on the anatomopathological
study.

CD31 (PECAM1) immunohistochemical stain on megakaryocytes in
myelodysplastic syndromes
N. Azrou Isghi*, R. Kassa, D. Chilla, A. Belarbi
*CHU DOUERA, Pathology Department, Algeria
Background & objectives: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clon-
al disorders of pluripotent stem cells characterized by ineffective
haematopoiesis with dysplasia of myeloid lineage and cytopenia.
In this series we evaluated usefulness of CD31 immunoreactivity to detect
dysmegakaryocyts and micromegakaryocyts in MDs.
Methods: we realized a morphological study based on comparison be-
tween histology (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using specific
primary antibody against CD31 (PECAM1)
Both techniques was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded
bone marrow (BM) core biopsy sections from 10 patients ( 8 with MDS
and 2 with normal BM).
Number, morphology and distribution of megakaryocytes were reported
for each biopsy.
Results: Normal BM biopsys: in sections stained with H&E, megakar-
yocytes are singly scattered or grouped in loose clusters, they are not
found in a paratrabecular location.
On average 7cells / space have been detected.
In IHC, megakaryocytes CD31 positive are slightly more frequents (15
cells/ space).
BM with MDs: Megakaryocytes are usually increased in number and
clusters in a paratrabecular location are seen, they are often dysplasic with
hypolobated nuclei, micromegakaryocytes can be observed.
The mean number is (15cells/Space).
Immunohistochemical staining for CD31 detected dysplastic megakaryo-
cytes of aberrant localization grouped in clusters and micromekaryocyts.
(25 cells/space)
Conclusion: The diagnosis of myelodyplastic syndrome requires a set of
clinical arguments and biological data.
Anti-CD31 in our own experience has proved to be highly sensitive for
megakaryocytes normal and dysplastic.
CD31+ megakaryocytes in bone marrow (BM) are a nonspecific finding
observed under normal conditions should not be interpreted as hyperpla-
sia, however it may be useful as a diagnostic tool in the detection of
dysplastic megakaryocytes particularly micromegakaryocytes that can
be difficult to seen in usual coloration.

Njim, A. Zakhama, R. Hadhri
*Department of Pathology, Chu Fattouma Bourguiba Monastir, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Crystal-storing histiocytosis (CSH) is a rare
lesion resulting from intra-lysosomal accumulation of immunoglobulins.
It is associated with lymphoproliferative disorder, particularly myeloma.
We present a case of CSH discovered in a bone marrow biopsy of a
patient who had myeloma.
Methods: We report the case of a 57-year-old man who had myeloma
and whose bone marrow biopsy was analysed in the department of pa-
thology of the university hospital of Monastir.
Results: A 57-year-old man consulted for back pain since 6 months.
Biological assessments showed an advanced renal failure with pro-
teinuria and a hypogammaglobulinemia. Myeloma was diagnosed in
this patient. The histological examination of BM biopsy showed
sheets of polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.
Needle-shaped, refractile crystals were confined to the cytoplasm.
These cells were strongly positive for CD68 confirming the diagnosis
of crystal storing histiocytosis.
Conclusion: CSH is a rare disorder characterized by accumulation of
crystal-laden non neoplastic histiocytes. This phenomenon could easily
be misdiagnosed as a granulomatous reaction or a storage disorder.
Recognizing its clinicopathologic characteristics is essential, as its pres-
ence is highly associated with an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder
and especially plasma cell myeloma.

*Department of Pathology, Chu Fattouma Bourguiba Monastir, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Kikuchi–Fujimoto Disease (KFD) or histio-
cytic necrotizing lymphadenitis is known to be a benign condition, which
usually affects female. A viral aetiology is advanced but not yet proven.
We assessed the clinical and pathological characteristics of KFD with
literature review.
Methods: This study included 6 KFD collected over 12 years (2008-
2019) in the department of pathology of the university hospital of
Monastir. A Lymph node biopsy was performed in three cases and
lymphadenectomy was performed in other cases.
Results: Patient’s ages ranged from 11 to 34 years with an average age of 22
years. Most patients were female (sex ratio = 5/1). Cervical
lymphadenomegaly (6 cases), fever (6 cases) and joint pain (4 cases) were
the most frequent symptoms. Diagnosisis confirmed by lymph node histology
which revealed paracortical foci of necrosis with abundant karyorrhectic debris
and a histiocytic infiltrate associated with plasmacytoid monocytes and lym-
phocytes without neutrophils or follicular hyperplasia. In 2 cases Hodgkin’s
lymphoma has been suspected, absence of Reed–Sternberg cells and the lack
of the characteristic background cell population had excluded this possibility.
Conclusion: KFD is an uncommon, self-limited, and perhaps under-
diagnosed process with an excellent prognosis. Distinguishing KFD from
malignant systemic disorders may even be difficult for pathologists using
histological examinationtechniquesandrequiresclose cooperation between
clinician and the pathologist. In order to minimize the risk of misdiagnosis
and to minimize potentially harmful and unnecessary treatments.

Lassoued, T. Dahmoul, H. Hamchi, S. Hmissa
*Department of Pathology of Sahloul University Hospital, Sousse,
Tunisia
Background & objectives: It is common for lymph nodes to harbour
unexpected findings of indolent and non-life-threatening pathologies re-
vealed by pathological examination. However, aggressive malignancies
such as Hodgkin’s lymphoma might also be an incidental discovery es-
pecially when shadowed by another aggressive primary tumour.
Methods: Through reporting 2 cases of a concomitant primary malignan-
cy and a Hodgkin lymphoma we aim to remind of the possibility of such
incidental encounters where aggressive neoplasms are clinically occulted
by other pathologies,
Results: Our first case is a 51-year-old female complaining of cervical
lymph-node swelling. Imaging also found a nodule of the thyroid. A
thyroidectomy and biopsies of the lymphadenopathies were performed.
Histologically, the lymph-node biopsy revealed a sclerosing nodular clas-
sical Hodgkin’s lymphoma CD30(+)/CD15(+). The thyroid harboured a
classical variant of papillary carcinoma metastatic to 5/8 lymph-nodes, 3
of which were also infiltrated by the lymphoma. The 2nd case is a 42-
year-old male suffering from an occupational-exposure-induced lichen.
Examination revealed a suspicious fast-growing ulceration of the ankle
and a 3cm inguinal adenopathy. Both were removed. Pathological exam-
ination found an infiltrating well-differentiated squamous-cell carcinoma.
Unexpectedly the lymph-node was infiltrated by a classical Hodgkin’s
lymphoma CD30(+)/CD15(+).
Conclusion: While a metastatic lymph node is the most likely diagnosis
when a primary tumour is already suspected, one should bear in mind that
incidental discoveries of lymphomas are rare but documented occur-
rences increasing in incidence due to a better healthcare approach.

Indeterminate cell histiocytosis: clinical significance of the histopath-
ological diagnosis
A. Bonometti*, E. Passoni, E. Berti
*Unit of Anatomic Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine,
University of Pavia, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia,
Italy
Background & objectives: Indeterminate cell histiocytosis/tumour
(iCH) is an exceedingly rare and poorly understood disorder characterized
by the infiltration of CD1a+, CD207/langerin- mononuclear cells in dif-
ferent tissues. We hereby describe 2 cases of iCH to emphasize the clin-
ical heterogeneity of this condition.
Methods: Case 1: female new-born presenting with 8 macular-nodular
erythematous itchy lesions, widespread on her skin diagnosed with iCH.
2 years later the lesions are slowly regressing. Case 2: 65 years old
woman with a history of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in remission. She
presented with a generalized, necrotizing, and confluent papular cutane-
ous eruption diagnosed as iCH. She was lost at follow-up.
Results: In both patients, the cutaneous infiltrates showed a proliferation
of CD1a+, CD207/langerin- mononuclear cells leading to a diagnosis of
iCH. However, they were cytologically different. Case one presented with
a monomorphous dermal proliferation of medium-sized cells with round
nuclei and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm with mild
epidermotropism. On the other side, case 2 showed a highly pleomorphic
infiltrate made of medium to large-sized cells with one to multiple, often
atypical nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytosol. In addition, these cells
displayed epidermotropism with destruction of the epidermis above the
lesion. Moreover, the Ki67 index was 15% in case 1 while it reached 50%
in case 2.
Conclusion: After 30 years from its description, it is clear that iCH repre-
sents a clinically heterogeneous group of conditions ranging from self-
healing to life-threatening conditions possibly associating with haematolog-
ical and epithelial tumours, especially among adult patients. Although there
are no defined prognostic criteria, cell atypia and proliferation may correlate
Virchows Arch
with the aggressiveness of the clinical course. As for other histiocytoses, a
diagnosis of iCH must prompt a multidisciplinary evaluation of patients to
rule out multisystem involvement and neoplastic associations.

Mixed histiocytosis: a new intricate chapter in the universe of
histiocytoses, the pathologist must know
A. Bonometti*
*Unit of Anatomic Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine,
University of Pavia, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia,
Italy
Background & objectives: Mixed histiocytosis is defined as the syn-
chronous or metachronous occurrence of lesions with Langerhans-cell
histiocytosis (LCH) and/or non-LCH (NLCH) morphological and immu-
nohistochemical features in a single patient. This condition is the best
representation of the plasticity of the neoplastic histiocyte.
Methods: We reviewed the worldwide literature on mixed histiocytosis,
as well as our cases, providing evidence on the need to distinguish be-
tween the different clinical and histopathological forms of mixed LCH
and NLCH. We hereby propose a clinical classification for mixed
histiocytosis and present examples of each subcategory from our cohort
of histiocytosis patients.
Results: Our analysis of the literature revealed three clinically, histopath-
ologically, and prognostically distinctive groups of mixed histiocytosis
patients. The larger group of patients included mostly young adults
displaying a BRAF-mutated multisystem histiocytosis involving bone
and skin with a clinical-pathological phenotype in-between LCH and
Erdheim-Chester disease. 15% of them died of disease after a median
of 7 months. The second group included chemotherapy-treated children
with BRAF-mutated single-system bone LCH, relapsing with cutaneous
juvenile xanthogranulomas. The third group included patients with nodal,
cutaneous or bony single lesions, featuring both LCH and NLCH infil-
trates, often represented by Distombes-Rosai-Dorfman disease. BRAF-
mutated cases accounted for 33% of patients.
Conclusion: Mixed histiocytosis is a complex group of localized or mul-
tisystem conditions, whose diagnosis needs a multidisciplinary approach.
Our proposed subclassification allow to distinguish patients with different
clinical burdens, therapy needs, and prognosis and supports the concept
of a pERK-driven clonal disorder with protean clinical manifestations.
Moreover, from a pathogenetic point of view, mixed histiocytosis may be
a source of information on the mechanisms of cell maturation, microen-
vironmental and immunological shifts, as well as of cellular response to
therapy in histiocytosis.

Reticulohistiocytosis-like cutaneous eruption in a patient
with polymyalgia rheumatica, and JAK2-mutated
chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia

F.R. Calledda, R. Riboni, C. Elena, V. Brazzelli, E. Boveri, M. Paulli
*Unit of Anatomic Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine,
University of Pavia, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia,
Italy
Background & objectives: Cutaneous eruptions featuring histiocytosis-
like infiltrates may be observed in patients with chronic and acute mye-
loid neoplasms and may correlate with worse prognosis and reduced
overall survival.
Methods: An 82 years-old Caucasian man was diagnosed with a JAK2-
mutated chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia type-0, with low-risk CPSS
and without need of any specific treatment. Two years after diagnosis he
developed innumerable, confluent, erythematous-brownish macules over
the trunk and proximal limbs.
Results: A skin biopsy revealed a dermal infiltrate of large epithelioid,
scalloped and spindled-shaped, mostly mononucleated cells with promi-
nent nucleoli and abundant granular, glassy eosinophilic cytoplasm.
These cells were positive for CD163, CD68R, CD14, partially positive
for CD33 and Cyclin-D1, negative for CD1a, CD34, CD117, MPO,
TCL1, pan-B and pan-T cell markers and had a low proliferative index
(<2%). The results were consistent with a non-Langerhans cell
histiocytosis, which, despite the unusual morphology, could be included
in the spectrum of reticulohistiocytosis.
Conclusion: Reticulohistiocytosis is a heterogeneous group of
histiocytoses characterized by large CD163+, CD1a- cells with abundant
glassy eosinophilic cytoplasm, accumulating in the skin and other organs. A
subset of cases specifically associates with myeloid neoplasms, and a clonal
relationship was demonstrated once. Nevertheless, reticulohistiocytosis is
morphologically and phenotypically different from other cutaneous mani-
festations in course of haematological neoplasms (e.g. leukaemia cutis,
Sweet syndrome). Despite the limited number of patients reported, it
should be considered in the differential diagnosis of these patients.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cell blast neoplasm: report of two clinical
cases
M. Bronte*, Y. Rodriguez, M.I. Cevallos, A. Larrea, M.C. Llanos, Y.
Laplaza, M. Montes, A. Panizo
*Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Spain
Background & objectives: Blactic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm
(BPDCN) is an aggressive haematological neoplasm characterized by a
diffuse monomorphous blast cell infiltrate, classified by the WHO as a
distinct entity. Our purpose is to describe the clinic-pathological features
found in two clinical cases.
Methods: Dermatological and haematological data were extracted from
computerized medical records of two patients diagnosed between January
2018 and December 2020. In addition, the histological sections of both
hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry of the corresponding bi-
opsies were examined.
Results: The two cases were males aged 84 and 77 respectively. Both had
scattered indurated skin lesions (head, trunk, extremities), with no other
accompanying symptoms. In addition to the skin biopsy, medulogram,
flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy were performed. The skin punch
showed a diffuse dermal infiltrate of medium-sized plasmacytoid cells.
Cell proliferation in skin, bone marrow and cytometry expressed CD123,
CD43, CD4 and CD56 among other markers. Cytogenetic analysis iden-
tified alterations in chromosomes 8 and 12, and c-MYC rearrangement by
FISH. These findings led to a definitive diagnosis of BPDCN. The first
patient died 8 months after diagnosis. The second patient is currently
undergoing chemotherapy.
Conclusion: BPDCN seems to show a higher incidence in males from the
6th decade of life onwards. The appearance of scattered indurated skin
nodules is the clinical finding that, together with the biopsy of these
lesions, helps to make a diagnosis. Bone marrow involvement is observed
as the disease progresses. Positivity of neoplastic cells for CD123, CD4
and CD56, and rearrangement of the c-MYC gene (8q24) are
characteristic.

MYD88 mutation in amyloid light-chain amyloidosis without B cell
neoplasm
A. Castillo Gandía*, C. Sanz Monte, G. Tapia Melendo, T. Sanhueza
Alzamora, J.L. Mate Sanz
*Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Spain
Background & objectives: Amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis is
associated to lymphoproliferative processes with plasmacytic differentia-
tion. However, in many patients it is possible to deepen into the nature of
Virchows Arch
the underlying process through a careful analysis of the associated lym-
phoid infiltrate.
Methods: We report a case of a male patient with multiple episodes of
severe pericardial effusions and an M component (IgM) in the
proteinogram, who underwent a pericardial biopsy.
Results: The histological study showed extensive pericardial amyloid de-
posits positive for light kappa chains by direct immunofluorescence tech-
niques. Protein AA and Transthyretin were negative. Focally, discrete lym-
phoid infiltrates of irregular distribution were observed with no tumour
mass. Restriction for light kappa chains was demonstrated by in situ hy-
bridization. MYD88 showed c.794T>C:p.L265P mutation. A bone marrow
biopsy was performed, which did not show significant microscopic find-
ings. However, its molecular study found the same MYD88 mutation.
The case was diagnosed as AL amyloidosis associated with monoclonal
gammopathy of uncertain significance without evidence of lymphoma.
Conclusion: This MYD88 mutation is associated with several B neo-
plasms. It is detectable in more than 90% of patients with Waldenström
macroglobulinemia and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.
The immunohistochemical and molecular characterization of the lym-
phoid tissue associated with primary amyloidosis allows a more complete
typing of the underlying cellular process that can be useful in the follow-
up of the patients.

Monotypic versus monoclonal: atypical marginal zone hyperplasia –
a case report of a rare reactive condition
A.R. Colmenares Lozada*, J. Cabecadas, A.D. Attygalle, G. Caldas
*Hospital distrital de Santarém, Portugal
Background & objectives: Atypical marginal zone hyperplasia
(AMZH) of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue is a reactive condition
occurring in childhood that histologically and immunophenotypically
resembles extra nodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue but lacks clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements.
Methods: We present a case of an 11-year-old female with no previous
history of disease, with progressive enlargement of two cervical lymph
nodes, with no other symptoms. A fine needle aspiration detected a lamb-
da monotypic B-cell population by flow cytometry. One of the nodes was
excised for morphologic, molecular and genetic studies.
Results: The lymph node was fragmented and showed partial alteration
of the architecture; residual follicles (RF) with hyperplastic germinal cen-
tres and some follicles containing “moth-eaten” germinal centres
(MEGC) and expanded marginal zones (MZ)The expanded MZ
contained predominantly small, medium and scattered large B-cells ex-
pressing CD20, BCL6 (weak), IgM and negative for CD10, IgD, BCL2,
MUM1, CD3 CD5 and EBER The RF and MEGC contained BCL2-
CD10+, BCL6+, large B-cells. Both the MZ and RF centres showed
marked lambda predominance. Clonal rearrangements for the immuno-
globulin genes IgH and IgK were not detected.
These appearances are consistent with a polyclonal but monotypic lamb-
da proliferation, consistent with atypical follicular and marginal zone
hyperplasia.
Conclusion: This is a rare entity and most published cases are extra nodal.
In the lymph node, similarity with paediatric nodal marginal zone lympho-
ma is a potential source of error. Understanding the difference between
monotypic and monoclonal is crucial in the differential diagnosis.
There is an association in the literature between Haemophilus influenza
and AMZH in nodes of head and neck region, but this correlation was not
possible to establish in our case.

Morphological and immunohistochemical features of a case of mul-
tifocal histiocytic sarcoma
D. Costache*, C.I. Busuioc, H.O.A. Mureșan
*Pathology Department, Colentina University Clinical Hospital,
Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Histiocytic sarcoma(HS) is an extremely rare
malignant neoplasm of mature, non-Langerhans histiocytes. HS is spo-
radic or clonally related to a separate hematologic malignancy, appears
mostly in extranodal locations(skin, soft tissue, lung, central nervous
system) and can be unifocal or multifocal.
Methods: A 68-year-old female with CT-scan showing a 5cm tumour
next to the upper pole of the left kidney; a 4cm mass on the left parietal
pleura with osteolysis of the 7th rib; osteolytic lesions of left ilium, left
acetabulum and vertebral body(L4-L5) with invasion in the soft tissue
and left posterior root of the spinal cord(L4-L5); with lumbar adenopathy.
Results: A resection of the mass from the vertebral body(L4-L5) was
performed for decompression and diagnostic purpose. Tissue was fixed
in formalin, processed, embedded in paraffin, examined on H&E and
ancillary immunohistochemical stains.
Microscopic examination revealed an infiltrative malignant prolifer-
ation of medium-large cells, with marked cytologic and nuclear
pleomorphism, large hyperchromatic nuclei, with prominent nucle-
oli, numerous multinucleated giant cells, with focal spindle cell
morphology, brisk mitotic activity and extensive necrosis.
Immunohistochemical stains showed strongly and diffusely positive
vimentin, CD4, CD14, CD45, CD68 and CD163, focal and weak
staining for S100 and negative CD3, CD20, CD21, CD23, CD30,
CD38, Langerin, AE1/AE3, MelanA, synaptophysin, GATA3, in-
hibin, calretinin, with a Ki67 index of 40%.
Conclusion: HS is a rare histiocytic neoplasm with a vast differential
diagnosis including other histiocytic/dendritic cell neoplasms, myeloid
neoplasms, lymphomas, melanoma, and carcinoma. Morphological fea-
tures together with an extensive panel of immunohistochemical markers
are the key for accurate classification.

A clinicopathological analysis and diagnostic approach of a rare case
of primary non-Hodgkin epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma in the
small intestine
M. Cristian*, M. Bosoteanu, M. Aschie, C. Boșoteanu, A. Mitroi, G.I.
Baltatescu
*CEDMOG, Ovidius University, Romania
Background & objectives: Monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-
cell lymphoma, formerly known as enteropathy-associated T-cell lym-
phoma, is a rare, aggressively peripheral extranodal T-cell lymphoma,
infrequent in native European and Caucasian populations. The study pre-
sents the clinicopathological features and diagnostic approach of this rare
entity of lymphoma.
Methods: A 69-year-old male patient presenting with an abdominal
mass, intestinal transit disorders and weight loss. The abdominal comput-
ed tomography scan revealed features suggestive of malignancy.
Following the clinical and imagistic investigations, surgical resection of
small intestine with other areas of involvement have been performed.
Further to the histopathological examination, an immunohistochemical
testing was mandatory, by using the monoclonal antibodies.
Results: Histopathologic evaluation of the tumour revealed a proliferation
ofmedium-tohigh-sizedmonomorphiclymphocytes,withvesicularnuclei,
proeminent nucleoli and a moderate amount of clear to pale eosinophilic
cytoplasm, with an association of infrequent Reed-Sternberg-like cells.
Immunohistochemical assessment of the aforementioned tumour using
CD3, CD8, CD5, CD20 and CD30 confirmed the T cell proliferation line
and the monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma diagnosis.
Conclusion: In the present case, a final diagnosis was not possible with-
out the aid of immunohistochemical tests and due to its poor prognosis, it
needs to be distinguished from inflammatory bowel diseases and less
aggressive T-cell lymphomas. Otherwise, early diagnosis of
Virchows Arch
monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma diagnosis is es-
sential for timely management.

Even lymphomas don’t always read the Blue Book
R. D'Amato Pascarella*, F. Magnoli, F. Sessa, S. Uccella
*University of Insubria, Varese, Italy
Background & objectives: A peculiar case of an 84-year-old woman
with sudden acute abdominal pain and no medical records. The clinical
suspect was an acute abdomen and the CT scan showed a possible per-
foration of the intestine; no specific cause was identified.
Methods: All surgical specimens underwent formalin-fixation, paraffin-
e m b e d d i n g a n d h e m a t o x y l i n - e o s i n ( H & E ) s t a i n i n g .
Immunohistochemical stains were routinely performed in an automatic
stainer, with the following primary antibodies: CD20, CD3, CD5, CD23,
Bcl2, Bcl6, CyclinD1, Mib1 (ki-67), CD4, CD8, CD56, TIA1 and EBER.
Results: Urgent small bowel resection was required. Macroscopically, a
tear was observed in the intestinal wall, which was slightly thickened, and
multiple nodules were present in the perivisceral tissue. Microscopically,
the intestinal wall was effaced by a monotonous diffuse proliferation of
small to medium size lymphoid cells with round regular nuclei, finely
dispersed chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli and a rim of pale perinuclear
cytoplasm. The adjoining mucosa showed normal villous architecture;
however, there was a remarkable increase of intraepithelial lymphocytes.
Immunohistochemistry revealed the following profile: CD20-, CD3+,
CD5-, CD23-, CD4-, CD8+, CD56+, TIA1+. Ki67 labelling index was
65-70%. EBER was negative.
The diagnosis of monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lympho-
ma (MEITL) was formulated.
Conclusion: Intestinal B-cell lymphomas are more frequent compared to
T-cell, of which the WHO lists 4 entities (EATL, T/NK nasal type, PTCL-
NOS, and MEITL). Although EATL was the first option, due to its fre-
quency in Europe and epidemiological features of our patient (sex and age),
the absence of celiac disease and the histological findings were against this.
This case is peculiar, being exceedingly rare at our latitude, and we want to
share it to encourage our colleagues to expect the unexpected.

Composite lymphoma in the orbit: a case report
S. da Mata*, T.I. Erasmo, P. Gameiro, J. Cabecadas
*NOVA Medical School UNL; Instituto Portugues de Oncologia de
Lisboa, Portugal
Background & objectives: Two distinct simultaneous lymphomas, in
the same anatomical location are rare, defined as a composite lymphoma.
We report a case of a 83-year-old male presenting with exophthalmos and
diminished vision for one year, without relevant oncological history nor
immunosuppression.
Methods:Anorbitalmassbiopsyidentifiedtwodifferentlymphomas.Flow
cytometry, immunohistochemistry and molecular genetics were needed to
distinguish them. Peripheral blood analysis had normal CBC, LDH and
Albumin, slightly elevated ß2-microglobulin (3,75 mg/L); elevated Kappa
(28.7 mg/L), normal Lambda (22.1 mg/L) with a normal ratio Kappa/
Lambda (1/3) and an elevated IgM (839 mg/dL) and normal IgG, IgA.
Results: On histological examination, a CD5+ small B cell lymphoma
was diagnosed as a MALT lymphoma and at the periphery, a monotypic
plasma cell proliferation was identified. The MALT Lymphoma was
IgM, kappa and the plasma cell component was IgA, lambda by IHC.
Ig gene rearrangement analysis of the whole sample is in accordance with
two different neoplastic populations: 1) IGHV3-74/IGHD1-26/IGHJ4
(productive) + IGHD-IGHJ and IGKV2-28/IGKJ2 (productive) +
IGKV2-29/KDE; 2) IGHV4-59/IGHD7-27/IGHJ4 (productive) +
IGHD-IGHJ and IGKV2-29/IGKJ5 (unproductive) + Intron-KDE. The
patient started a treatment using CP-R [cyclophosphamide + prednisone +
rituximab] with clinical improvement of the proptosis but died before
ending the chemotherapy.
Conclusion: Although plasma cell differentiation is common in MALT
lymphoma, the same light chain is shared by all cells. Identifying two
different monotypic light chains in separate areas suggests a composite
lymphoma, here confirmed by the presence of two distinct receptor gene
rearrangement patterns. The diagnosis of a second clone as
Lymphoplasmocytic Lymphoma, usually associated with Waldström
Macroglobulinemia, might lead to a different therapy, depending on the
staging of the patient.

Haematopoiesis extramedullary: uncommon case of giant adrenal
incidentaloma mimicking tumour mass
S. Elaouni*, S. Sassi, S. Jebli, Z. Bernoussi, F. Zouidia, K. Znati
*Ibn Sina University Hospital, Pathology, Rabat, Morocco
Background & objectives: Haematopoiesis extramedullary is a prolifer-
ation of the hematopoietic cells outside of the bone marrow , in the
adrenal is rare with fewer than 10 cases reported, and is finding as well
as giant mass mimicking tumour lesion is extremely rare.
Methods: We report the case of a 38-year-old woman who had been
known to have β-thalassemia and presented to the hospital for the bio-
logical evaluation, and abdominal pain. She benefited from an X-ray
showed a giant right adrenal mass, solid, with high uptake, with contrast
enhancement and splenomegaly. Consequently, the differential diagnosis
included a malignant adrenal tumour. Therefore, the patient underwent
right adrenalectomy.
Results: Gross examination revealed a well-circumscribed brownish
mass measuring 13 cm in maximum dimension, with a haemorrhagic,
reddish brown cut surface. A rim of normal looking adrenal tissue was
noted at the periphery. Histology revealed the mass to be composed of
mature hemopoietic elements, with a predominance of erythroid series. A
few megakaryocytes were also noted.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of extramedullary haematopoiesis must be
considered in any patient with hematologic disorders and thoracic or
abdominal mass. An unnecessary procedure could be avoided.

An unusual presentation of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neo-
plasm with bone marrow and skin involvement
D. Enea*, I. Ursuleac, C. Popa, C. Dobrea
*University Emergency Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm
comprises <1% of haematologic malignancies, characterized by an ag-
gressive clonal proliferation of immature plasmacytoid dendritic cells
(PDC). Most patients, usually elderly men, present with cutaneous le-
sions, with subsequent extension to bone marrow and peripheral blood.
Methods: A 70-year-old man was admitted for skin lesions increasing in
number and dimension over the last 6 months. Clinical examination re-
vealed multiple violaceous, non-erythematous maculopapular cutaneous
lesions located on the trunk. The complete blood count indicated mild
leukopenia (3.87×10^9/L) and thrombocytopenia (131×10^9/L).
Abdominal sonography revealed mild hepatosplenomegaly. Skin and
bone marrow biopsies were also performed.
Results: Peripheral blood smears examination showed 20% polymorphous
population of intermediate-sized lymphoid cells, with PDC
immunophenotype on flow-cytometry (weak CD45, CD56+, CD123+,
HLA−DR+, CD4+) and lack of expression of lymphoid and myeloid
markers. The skin biopsy disclosed a diffuse non-epidermotropic prolifer-
ation of monomorphous medium-sized neoplastic cells with immature mor-
phology (irregular nuclear contour, multiple inconspicuous nucleoli and
scant cytoplasm). BMB showed a 17-18% interstitial infiltration of neo-
plastic cells featuring the same histopathological aspects as described in the
Virchows Arch
skin. IHC performed on both skin and bone marrow biopsies also demon-
strated a PDC profile of neoplastic cells (CD56+, CD123+, TdT+, CD68+).
Conclusion: As an uncommon condition, the diagnosis of BPDCN is
challenging and requires a step-by-step approach using a large panel of
antibodies, since neoplastic cells can resemble lymphoblasts or small
immunoblasts. Despite the apparently indolent clinical presentation, the
course is aggressive. Disseminated lesions, as well as bone marrow ex-
tension, usually develop progressively towards the terminal stage of the
disease. However, in our case, the patient presented with cutaneous le-
sions and simultaneous involvement of bone marrow and peripheral
blood.

In situ follicular neoplasia arising in a cervical branchial cleft cyst –
morphological diagnosis with serious implications
M. Erashdi*, M. Lavaei, A. Svec
*Department of Cellular Pathology, James Cook University Hospital,
Middlesbrough, United Kingdom, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: A branchial cleft cyst is a benign lesion
commonly presents as a unilateral neck swelling. Detection of incidental
malignancy is very uncommon with malignant lymphoma being an ex-
ceedingly rare finding.
Methods: The patient was evaluated using preoperative ultrasound, CT
and MRI neck scans and fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). The
excision biopsy was submitted for histological examination followed by
immunohistochemistry (CD20, CD3, CD10, CD21, CD23, bcl-2, bcl-6,
and Ki67) according to the standard protocols.
Results: A 53-year-old man with unremarkable past medical history pre-
sented with a painful right neck lump. CT-scan revealed a 35mm right
cervical cyst with no cervical, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenop-
athy. The cyst and an adjacent lymph node were excised. Histologically,
the cyst was lined by stratified keratinising squamous epithelium encased
by dense lymphoid tissue with prominent secondary follicles. The lymph
node architecture was preserved with follicular hyperplasia. Some germinal
centres in the cyst wall and the lymph node were effaced by tightly packed
CD20+/CD10+/bcl-2+ centrocytes. These findings were reported as syn-
chronous nodal and extranodal in situ follicular neoplasia (ISFN) affecting
a branchial cleft cyst and locoregional lymph node.
Conclusion: ISFN is a WHO entity. It can be suspected on morpholog-
ical assessment and confirmed by immunohistochemistry both in nodal
and extra-nodal sites.
ISFN should prompt studies to exclude overt lymphoma in other sites, as
reportedly, half of ISFN cases are associated with concurrent or previous
overt follicular lymphoma. Only a small number of cases progress to
overt lymphoma.
We are not aware of previous reports on the involvement of branchial
cleft cyst lymphoid tissue by ISFN.

Background & objectives: Primary hyperoxaluria is a rare genetic ab-
normality, characterized by excess of endogenous oxalate production
with a deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in several tissues mainly in
kidneys, myocardium, spleen, soft tissues. However, bone marrow local-
ization is very rarely observed.
Methods: We report the case of a 37-years-old man with chronic renal
failure on haemodialysis since 2017. His medical history revealed prima-
ry hyperoxaluria. Since the patient was a candidate for combined hepato
renal transplant, an osteomedullary biopsy was performed to evaluate the
extension of oxalate deposits.
Results: Histological examination showed the presence of extensive cal-
cium oxalate crystals deposits surrounded by foreign body giant cell
reaction. Stromal fibrosis, poor residual haematopoiesis and thickened
bony traeculae were also observed. The polarized light revealed intense
pale green birefringence of these deposits. Bone marrow involvement
was then confirmed.
Conclusion: Primary hyperoxaluria is a congenital metabolic abnormal-
ity caused by mutation of the AGXT gene (alanine glyoxylate amino-
transferase). The clinical symptomatology is diverse, secondary to calci-
um oxalate deposits in the various tissues. The bone marrow localization
is very rare and the diagnosis relies on the presence of specific oxalate
needle-like crystals on histological study. Moreover, the diagnosis of this
disease is often late, which makes its prognosis mediocre and difficult to
manage.

Background & objectives: Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare
clonal non-Langerhans histiocytosis, characterized by heterogeneous
clinical presentations and molecular features. Therefore, diagnosis and
appropriate treatment are often delayed. Retroperitoneum and bone
metaphysis e.g. are critical sites that can harbour numerous diseases in-
cluding ECD.
Methods: A 48-years old man with a history of renal colic episodes,
complained 2-week-long colic lower back pain. Uro-TC demonstrated
ureteral stones and a retroperitoneal mass causing bilateral
hydronephrosis, necessitating JJ-catheterization. Biopsy revealed a
foamy and multinucleated histiocytes proliferation CD163+, CD68R/
PGM1+, CD14+, Factor XIII+/-, Cyclin-D1-/+, S100p-, CD1a-. We hy-
pothesized ECD, indicating the necessity of further diagnostic exams, for
confirmation and management.
Results: CT and PET total body revealed mammary chain,
interaortocaval and iliac lymphadenopathies, a pulmonary nodule
and a mass between pericardium and ascending aorta, but no bone
lesions. Brain RM was unremarkable and no signs of diabetes
insipidus were observed. Complete blood count, VES, CRP and
ACE were normal. Tumoral markers were negative. Sequencing
analysis for BRAFV600E and NRAS mutation were negative, while
ac.35G>A (p.Gly12Asp) mutation on KRAS exon 2 was found.
Following ECD diagnosis confirmation, the patient started
INFalfa2b therapy.
Conclusion: ECD is rare, heterogeneous and insidious. Molecular ad-
vances and new drug development significantly decreased morbidity.
However, diagnostic delay is still frequent, especially in absence of typ-
ical presentation, as many different neoplastic disorders such as lympho-
mas, sarcomas and non-neoplastic conditions, (e.g. retroperitoneal fibro-
sis, IgG4-related disease) should be ruled out. ECD diagnosis and man-
agement require a multidisciplinary approach and histopathological and
molecular analysis are an essential part of the diagnostic process and a
therapeutic guide.

Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Coexistence of myeloid and lymphoid neo-
plasm in the same patient is rare, often following cytoreductive therapy;
this combination might suggest the existence of a common precursor.
Methods: A 72-years male patient affected by JAK2+ myeloproliferative
neoplasm (MPN) treated with hydroxyurea for thrombocytosis and IgG/
K multiple myeloma (MM), complained nasal obstruction. Septum biop-
sy showed an infiltrate of medium-sized cells with convoluted nuclei, and
a T-cell/NK phenotype: CD2+, CD3+ (cytoplasmic), CD56+,
Granzyme+ and Perforin+, EBER+. An extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma
nasal-type was diagnosed.
Results: At the best of our knowledge, association between MPN, MM
and NK/T lymphomas has not been reported previously in literature. Both
myeloid and lymphoid malignancies originate from hematopoietic cells,
in whom one or more genetic events, some of which known, cause a
deregulated proliferation. It has also been reported that acute leukaemias,
displaying a mixed phenotype, can undergo a lineage switch, sporadical-
ly. It might be postulated that a common stem cell could be
reprogrammed from lymphoid to myeloid lineage or vice versa, in a
setting including immune defects and/or chronic infections.
Conclusion: Comparing known mutations in lymphomas and myelopro-
liferative diseases, we hypothesized a common event involving JAK-
STAT pathway. Intrinsic characteristics, such as immune status, combined
with external agents (e.g. EBV), might have created a favourable setting.
Whole Exome and Transcriptomic studies on similar cases of concomitant
hematologic neoplasms could be useful to better clarify the biological re-
lationships between the various lineage components, bringing to light pu-
tative common mutagenic events that might link these different cellular
lines.

*Anatomic Pathology Unit, Department of Molecular Medicine,
University of Pavia and Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico S. Matteo,
Pavia, Italy
Background & objectives: Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) is a
lymphoproliferative disorder classified according to its etiological
drivers. Bone marrow (BM) involvement is rare and the limited literature
data mostly focused on HHV8+HIV+MCD cases. We describe the BM
findings in an HHV8+HIV- MCD patient.
Methods: A 75-year-old man presented with multiple lymph nodes en-
largement, and signs of multi-organ failure. Laboratory analysis revealed
pancytopenia and elevated C-reactive protein. The IL6 level was 67,76
pg/ml. Serologic test for HHV8 was positive whereas HIV test was neg-
ative. Clinically a lymphoproliferative disorder was suspected, and pa-
tient underwent lymphadenectomy and BM biopsies.
Results: The lymph node histology revealed many regressed germinal cen-
tres with scattered HHV8/LANA1 positive cells, mostly in the perifollicular
area, as well as numerous interfollicular polytypic plasma cells. A diagnosis
of HHV8+ MCD with mixed histopathology was made. The BM histology
showed a slight hypercellularity, an interstitial and perivascular infiltrate of
polytypic plasma cells (30% of BM cellularity), and small lymphocytes
(10% of BM cellularity), either T (CD3+) or B (CD20+); HHV8/LANA1
positivity was confined mostly on B lymphocytes. The CD68R immuno-
stainingevidentiatednumerouspositivehistiocyteswithhemophagocytosis.
On such findings, a diagnosis of BM involvement by MCD was made.
The patient died of disease shortly afterwards.
Conclusion: BM changes in MCD HHV8+/HIV+ patients predominant-
ly consist of reactive plasmacytosis ascribed to increased IL6 levels
coupled with the presence of lymphoid follicles exhibiting the typical
changes of Castleman disease; in addition, scattered HHV8/LANA1+
cells and increased amount of histiocytes with sporadic
hemophagocytosis can be found. BM histologic features in our case of
MCD HHV8+ but HIV- overlapped with the reported one in similar but
HIV positive cases, thus suggesting that these changes might develop
independently from the HIV-status.

Marginal zone lymphoma in a one-year-old child and B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukaemia following lymphoma remission: Louis-Bar
syndrome presented with lymphoma and leukaemia. A rare case
report
H. Gunel*, B. Cobanoglu Simsek
*Istanbul Medeniyet University Prof. Dr. Suleyman Yalcin City Hospital
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Marginal zone lymphomas are present rarely
in children and young adults as either primary nodal or extranodal
disease.
Methods: A 1-year -old girl patient without a known disease presented
with neck swelling and fever. She received antibiotic treatment one week
but were not decrease of symptoms. On physical examination, multiple
lymph nodes were palpated in both parotid and cervical chains. On abdom-
inal examination revealed hepatomegaly. Excisional biopsy was performed
from the masses in the right submandibular region and sent to pathology.
Results: Microscopically, lymphoid infiltration of medium sized cells
which partly eliminated the structure of the salivary gland was observed.
Immunohistochemically, lymphoid cells were stained diffuse positive
with CD20 and pax-5. Diffuse expression with cd43 and bcl-2 was seen
in these cells. Germinal centre markers such as CD10,Bcl-6 and MUM-1
were negative. Ki67 proliferation index was 40%. With these findings,
the case was evaluated as Marginal zone lymphoma(MZL).
Chemotherapy was applied for MZL. Approximately 6 months after the
patient was in remission, hepatosplenomegaly and thrombocytopenia
were detected during the routine control. A diagnosis of acute lympho-
blastic leukaemia was made by examining the peripheral smear, bone
marrow aspiration smear and bone marrow biopsy. Ataxia telangiectasia
gene mutation was found in the genetic testing of the patient.
Conclusion: Here, we aimed to present a one-year-old patient with ataxia
telangiectasia gene mutation who presented with the diagnosis of mar-
ginal zone lymphoma and then acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in the light
of the literature.

Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma: the many-faced lymphoma -
analysis of 9 cases
Z. Lajmi*, A. Bdioui, M. Krifa, E. Ben Ammou, T. Dahmoul, H. Hamchi,
S. Hmissa, M. Mokni
*Sahloul Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma
(AITL) is a subtype of mature peripheral T-cell lymphoma(PTCL). The
WHO classification recently acknowledged its complexity with the addi-
tion of other AITL-like subsets. AITL resides under the umbrella of nodal
T-cell lymphomas with follicular T helper(TFH) phenotype.
Methods: It is a retrospective study including 9 cases of AITL diagnosed
by lymph node biopsy in the Department of Pathology of Farhat Hached
and Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse (Tunisia) during 2014-2020.
This study included 5 men and 4 women. The mean age was 49 years
ranged between 23 and 71. Most patients presented with generalized
lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly.
Results: Histologically, the lymph nodes showed partial or total efface-
ment of the normal architecture by a polymorphic lymphoid infiltrate
including neoplastic T-cells and various chronic inflammatory. A
perivascular proliferation of follicular dendritic cells(FDC) and a vascular
proliferation were present. The differential diagnosis included atypical
Virchows Arch
reactive processes, Hodgkin’s disease, B-cell lymphomas and other
PTCL. On immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic T cells expressed
CD3 in all cases, CD5 in 6 cases, CD2 and CD7 in 4 cases. They were
positive for CD4 in 7 cases. A smaller CD8+ population was present in 2
cases. They expressed TFH markers: BCL6 in 3 cases and CD10 in 6
cases. 5 cases expressed CD23 showing FDC proliferation.
Conclusion: AITL is a neoplasm of mature TFH cells which occurs
mostly in the middle-aged and elderly. Lymph node biopsy is needed to
confirm this diagnosis which may be difficult especially in the early phase
although the well described histologic features. Unlike many other lym-
phomas, no specific phenotypic or molecular markers have been identi-
fied so far to assist the diagnosis that often leads to delayed or wrong
histologic diagnosis, denying the patient the chance of early treatment.

Intranodal palisaded myofibroblastoma in a middle-aged adult: a
case report of a rare lymph node-based benign neoplasia and review
of the literature
N.J. Lamas*, A.P. Rodrigues, F.E. Costa, J.R. Vizcaíno
*Anatomic Pathology Service, Department of Pathology, Centro
Hospitalar e Universitário do Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Intranodal palisaded myofibroblastoma is a
benign neoplasia of ill-defined pathogenesis based in the lymph node. It
occurs predominantly in the inguinal region in adults aged between 45
and 55-years old.
Methods: We report the case of a 57-year-old male with a history of right
inguinal adenomegaly measuring 23x18mm, without other enlarged
lymph nodes in the regional chains. The patient was submitted to lymph
node excision. We received a 2g and 20x15x10mm lymph node, already
sectioned by the largest axis, with smooth external surface. The cut sur-
face was multinodular, elastic and yellowish whitish.
Results: The histological analysis revealed a well-defined lesion, separated
from the surrounding lymph node parenchyma by a thin pseudocapsule, with
moderate to high cellularity and consisting of spindle cells organized in short
fascicles, in swirls and which often displayed palisaded nuclei. The cytoplasm
was scarce, slightly eosinophilic and fibrillar, and the nuclei hyperchromatic
and elongated. The fusiform cells had frequent paranuclear hyaline globules
and, sometimes, peri-nuclear vacuoles. In 50 high-power fields we identified
4 mitoses. The lesion had areas of collagenous and hyalinized matrix. The
neoplastic cells were immunoreactive for β-catenin, SMA, Cyclin D1,
Calponin, CD99 and Desmin; and negative for EMA, CAM5.2, CD34,
S100 protein, Podoplanin, SOX-10 and STAT6 expression.
Conclusion: This case illustrates the main immunophenotypical features
of this extremely rare benign neoplasia based in the lymph node, which is
generally cured by local excision. Local recurrence is rare and, conse-
quently, it has an excellent prognosis.

Background & objectives: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia/Small
LymphocyticLymphoma(CLL/SLL)maytransformintoaclinicallyaggres-
sive lymphoma calledRichter syndrome. The majority of transformation are
toDiffuseLargeB-CellLymphoma,whileAngioimmunoblasticT-celllym-
phoma (AITL) is a rare variant of Richter syndrome recently described.
Methods: We present a 60-year-old male diagnosed 7 years ago (2014)
of CLL with RAI stage 0, Binet-A. He remained stable without treatment
until 2017, he developed lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly and started
treatment with Ibrutinib+Venetoclax, with good response and minimal
residual disease in blood (0.18%). In January 2020, he presented with
worsening general condition, pancytopenia, and high EBV-viral load.
Results: In 2014, IGHV-mutated CLL del(13q) was diagnosed by flow
cytometry (CD19;CD5;CD23;CD20;kappa). There was ZAP70<20%,
CD38<30% without TP53 mutation. In January 2020 after respiratory
infection, relapsed with pancytopenia, EBV was positive (20.515
copies/ml) and worsening of CT scan. After received valaciclovir, he
switched to ibrutinib alone due to remained pancytopenia.
In November 2020, increasing EBV and worsening the PET-CT scan a
lymph node biopsy showed effacement of lymph node architecture due to
diffuse large atypical T lymphocytes (CD2+;CD3+;CD5+;CD4+;CD10+
;BCL6+;PD1+;ICOS+), expansion of follicular dendritic cells (CD21+),
high endothelial venules and isolated regressed follicles consistent with
pattern III AITL. We also observed isolated B-cells CD30+ and EBER-
ISH+. A BM biopsy revealed focal micronodular infiltration.
Conclusion: Regarding to the literature, CLL/SLL cases transformed into
T-cell lymphomas are rare and specially include PTCL, NOS and ALCL.
Recently, Trimech et al. described 2 cases with composite AITL and CLL/
SLL and one case with same evolution as our case. In our patient, del(13q)
wastheCLLprognosticfactoridentified,wasonlytreatedwithIbrutiniband

so EBV or treatment might be involved in the pathogenesis of AITL.

Kaposi’s sarcoma and nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin
lymphoma presentation in the same lymph node: a rare case report
E. Mercan Demirtaş*, F. Öz Puyan, C. Topuz, M. Ayyildiz
*Department of Pathology, Trakya University, School of Medicine,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Coexistence of Kaposi's sarcoma with
Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma in the same lymph node is frequently
encountered, but its association with Nodular Lymphocyte Predominant
Hodgkin Lymphoma (NLPHL) is extremely rare, only 4 cases have been
reported in the literature.
Methods: A 40-year-old male presented with fever and night sweats for
about a month had a lymph node in the right axillary region on physical
examination. Numerous lymphadenopathies were observed in the bilat-
eral jugular area, posterior cervical triangle, right axillary area and left
inguinal areas with USG. No history of other disease was seen. Right
axillary lymph node was excised.
Results: Histopathological examination revealed fascicles of spindle-
shaped cells arranged between cleft-like vascular spaces filled with red
blood cells. Additionally, Hodgkin-like cells with bilobed large nuclei,
some in the form of popcorn, were seen in a nodular infiltration pattern
that disrupted the lymph node architecture. Hodgkin-like cells were positive
for CD20, CD45, OCT2, BOB1 and negative for CD30, CD15. The lym-
phocytes around these large cells were found to be positive in the rosette
forming pattern with PD1 staining. Spindle cells were positive for CD34,
CD31, HHV8. EBER ISH result was negative. The patient was diagnosed
as NLPHL concomitant with HHV8 positive Kaposi sarcoma without im-
munosuppression. Serology for HIV infection was also negative.
Conclusion: It is rare for NLPHL to be seen synchronously with KS in
the same lymph node. Absence of HIV/ Immunodeficiency is also very
rare entity in terms of occurrence with Kaposi's sarcoma infiltration in the
primary lymph node without skin involvement. The case is important
because of its rarity and different clinical presentation.

Low-grade B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 gene rearrangement: a case
report
C. Morgan*, K. Vroobel
*Royal Marsden Hospital, United Kingdom
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: A case of low-grade B-cell lymphoma with
IRF4 rearrangement presenting as a thigh mass. Although rearrangements
involving the IRF4 gene have been described in myeloma and large B-
cell lymphomas, few reported cases of low-grade B-cell lymphoma
harbouring this translocation exist.
Methods: This case displayed both a follicular and diffuse growth pattern
suggestive of follicular lymphoma, was composed predominantly of
centrocytoid cells, and lacked prolymphocytes or the large cell morphol-
ogy typically seen in large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangement.
There was no evidence of a translocation involving the BCL2 gene.
Diffuse MUM1 positivity by immunohistochemistry prompted FISH
testing.

posed of malignant lymphoid cells, producing a tumefactive lesion within
bone. We report a 13-year-old male who presented with progressively
increasing swellings at the right shoulder and right mid-thigh for three
months.

ed with soft tissue masses in both sites and a pathological fracture on the
righthumerus.Thepatienthadnosignificantmedicalhistory.Histological,
immunohistochemical tests (CD20, CD45 positivity) but negative with
CD99 and Cytokeratin 20; and FISH assessment of biopsies from the le-

Results: Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 outbreak, the patient was un-
able to follow-up treatment and died shortly after establishment of the
diagnosis. Delay in diagnosis and treatment is of serious concern when it
comes to improve the prognosis of patients with this disease.
Conclusion: Primary bone lymphoma especially in African paediatric
population is rare. Delay in diagnosis and treatment as it was the case
in our patient is of concern when it comes to improve the prognosis of
patients with this disease. Clinicians should have a suspicion of index for
unusual cases and thus vigorously work-up including proper and timely
diagnosis for optimal patient care.

Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lym-
phoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) with extensive IgG4 plasmacytic
differentiation of the submaxillary gland: case report
E.M. Pena Burgos*, M.E. García Fernández, G. Olmedilla Arregui
*Department of Anatomical Pathology, La Paz University Hospital,
Madrid, Spain
Background & objectives: We report a case of extranodal marginal zone
lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma)
with extensive IgG4 plasmacytic differentiation. This entity may be
misdiagnosed as an IgG4-related disease. Our aim is to report a case
affecting a salivary gland.
Methods: A 68-year-old man presented a 3 cm cervical tumour in his left
submaxillary region of days of evolution. There were no supra or
infradiaphragmatic lymphadenopathy in computed tomography scan.
High serum IgG4 levels were detected in the analysis. Cervical FNA
was reported as: images suggestive of reactive pattern lymphadenopathy.
After two months without size reduction, the tumour was biopsied.
Results: The histological study showed a monomorphic lymphoid infil-
trate of small and irregular lymphocytes with a dendritic expansion. The
lymphocytes had a B cell phenotype (CD79a and CD20) with MNDA
and BCL2 coexpression. There were numerous Kappa-restricted plasma
cells, and the IgG4/IgG ratio was >80%. IgH rearrangement was clonal
for FR1, FR2 and FR3. MALT lymphomas accounts for 7% of all B
lymphomas. The most common site is the stomach, but they may be seen
in ocular appendages, skin or salivary glands. 30% of them present
plasmacytic differentiation, that has no prognostic implication. MALT
lymphomas with extensive IgG4 plasmacytic differentiation has been
described in skin, ocular adnexa, meninges and renal hilium.
Conclusion: In a patient with a major salivary gland infiltrated by an
IgG4 plasmacytoid infiltrate, a MALT lymphoma with IgG4 plasmacytic
differentiation should be ruled out based on clinical data, histology and
IgH rearrangement so that they are not misdiagnosed as an IgG4-related
disease. These entities share some locations such as major salivary glands
and high serum IgG4 levels may be seen in both entities. IgG4-related
disease presents storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis but no clonal
IgH rearrangement or mass formation.

Incidental finding of high grade plasmablastic neoplasm in a 76-
years-old patient with rectal adenocarcinoma. Case report of a dou-
ble primary malignancy

Grigoropoulou, I. Margaris, G. Kakiopoulos
*"G.Gennimatas" General Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Double primary malignancies are increasing
in incidence, due to early detection of tumours. We describe a case report
of an incidental finding of high grade plasmablastic neoplasm in 76-
years-old patient who underwent surgery for rectum cancer.
Methods: A 76-years-old patient with a prior diagnosis of rectal adeno-
carcinoma underwent surgery. We received part of left large bowel
(rectosigmoid) measuring 15,5 cm in length. There was an adenocarcino-
ma, NOS, low grade 3,8cm in greatest dimension. We found 15 lymph
nodes in the rectal fat ranging in diameter from 0,2 to 0,7 cm. The path-
ologic stage was pT3N0.
Results: One lymph node, measuring 0,2cm in greatest diameter was infil-
trated by a relatively monomorphic population of lymphoid cells. There was
also extranodal extension. The cells were medium to large and had mor-
phological plasmacytic differentiation. We performed an extensive immu-
nohistochemical assay. The neoplastic cells were positive for LCA, CD79a,
CD138 and had clonal expression of κ light chains. The lymphoid markers
CD20, PanB, CD3, CD5, CD23, CyclinD1, Bcl-6, Bcl-2, CD30, CD56
were negative. The proliferation index (MIB-1) was 90-95%. EBER assay
wasnegative or inconclusive inourlaboratory. Thus,thefinal diagnosiswas
between high grade plasmablastic neoplasm. The differential diagnosis was
between plasmablastic lymphoma and plasmablastic multiple myeloma.
Conclusion: The patient underwent bone marrow trephine biopsy which
was negative. She underwent chemotherapy and is free of disease 1 year
Virchows Arch
later. This case of double malignancy underscores the importance of
lymph node sampling in surgical specimens. We should always remem-
ber that it is imperative for a pathologist to be always on alert for other
coexistent nosologic entities besides the clinically indicated ones.

Myeloid sarcoma of the cranial vault in a small child: if we don´t
think about it, we won´t diagnose it
P. Puente Lopez*, E. Miraval Wong, E. Garcia Fernandez, G. Olmedilla
Arriaga
*Hospital Universitario La Paz, Spain
Background & objectives: Megakaryoblastic Acute Myeloid
Leukaemia with t(1;22) accounts for less than 1% of AML; it is more
frequent in girls younger than 6 months without Down syndrome and
usually starts with hepatosplenomegaly and cytopenias. The debut as
myeloid sarcoma is exceptional.
Methods: A 1 year and 1 month old girl arrives at our centre from another
hospital with two lesions in the cranial vault diagnosed as small blue cell
neoplasm with normal karyotype and a pending NGS study. At our centre
she was found to have cytopenias and splenomegaly so a bone marrow
biopsy was performed.
Results: The bone marrow was found to be 70% infiltrated by small blue
cells with the rest of the hematopoietic series remaining between them
without dysplasia and with moderate increase of reticulin fibrosis. An ex-
tensive immunohistochemical panel was performed and the only positive
marker was vimentin. A few days later, the NGS study in bone marrow and
cranial vault revealed a fusion between the RMB15-MKL1 genes, so im-
munohistochemistry for CD61 was performed and was positive.
Theaspiratesweredry(nocellularityduetofibrosis)andtherewerelessthan
4% of megacarioblasts in the blood smear, response to induction was eval-
uated with three bone marrow biopsies with absence of tumour infiltration.
Conclusion: Megakaryoblastic AML M7 is a diagnostic challenge given
its rarity and broad differential diagnosis. Ruling out Down syndrome and
mutational genetic study is important for prognosis. In cases of fusion
between RMB15-MKL1 genes, intensive treatment gives a favourable
prognosis to these patients.

Synchronous bone marrow infiltration by splenic marginal zone lym-
phoma (SMZL) and high-grade lymphoma with intermediate fea-
tures between nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma
(NLPHL) and T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma
(TCHRLBCL)
R. Rolim*, S. Pinto, T. Maia
*IPO Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Portugal
Background & objectives: Diagnosing bone marrow (BM) infiltration
by synchronous lymphomas is challenging. We describe a case of syn-
chronous SMZL and large B-cell lymphoma reminiscent of NLPHL/
TCHRLBCL, first suspected in a BM biopsy. Synchronous or
metachronous SMZL-NLPHL/TCHRLBCL were not reported so far.
Methods: Herein we report a case of a 64-year-old woman (unremark-
able previous medical record) presenting with asthenia, weight loss and
generalized lymphadenopathy. Workup revealed lymphocytosis,
bicytopenia and massive splenomegaly. Flow-cytometry of peripheral
blood disclosed a monotypical small B-cell population with a non-
specific immunophenotype. A BM biopsy was performed. A lymph node
was later excised to clarify the final diagnosis.
Results: BM histomorphology disclosed two distinct patterns of lymphoid
infiltration: a)Intrasinusoidal/interstitial, comprising small B-cells (CD20+/
IgD+/CD11c-/AnnexinA1-/BCL6-/CD10-/CD5-/CyclinD1-) consistent
with SMZL; b)Macronodular, comprising scattered large B cells
(CD20+/CD19+/CD30+/EBER-/IgD-/EMA-) within a background of
small T-cells (CD3+/PD1+/CD57+) and epithelioid histiocytes. This un-
usual combination prompted lymph node excision. Histomorphology
showed capsular thickening with septae delineating nodulariform compart-
ments and architectural effacement by a serpiginous lymphoid prolifera-
tion. This included scattered and clusters of large B-cells with centroblastic
and rare “popcorn” morphology (CD20+/CD19+/CD30+/EBER-/MUM+/
BCL6-/CD10-/IgD-/EMA-), a T-cell/histiocyte-rich background (CD3+/
CD4+/PD1+/ICOS+ and CD3+/CD8+), dispersed IgD+ small B-cells
and disrupted follicular dendritic cell meshworks. PD1-rosettes around
large B-cells were seen focally. These features resembled both NLPHL
and TCHRLBCL but did not allow classification as either.
Conclusion: When diagnosing BM infiltration by spleen-based small B-
cell lymphomas (e.g. SMZL), unusual clinical (e.g. generalized lymph-
adenopathy) and/or morphologic features (e.g. macronodular pattern)
warrant consideration of a rare scenario of synchronous lymphoma, as
illustrated by this case, a previously unknown association. This case also
highlights that, by current WHO classification criteria, there is a morpho-
logic grey-zone between NLPHL and TCHRLBCL (reflecting a biologic
continuum?). We suggest a provisional entity to accommodate these
cases and better study their biologic relationship with NLPHL/
TCHRLBCL.

A clinical case of acute myeloid leukaemia in a child with
ependymoma of the cerebellum and IV ventricle of the brain
M. Mnikhovich, A. Romanov*, T. Sotnikova, D. Donskoy, E. Inushkina,
E. Klimova, D. Kushch
*Research Institute of Human Morphology, Russia
Background & objectives: Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in patients
could be a long-term effect of antitumor therapy. Cytostatics damage
DNA and cause unbalanced translocations and deletions of the arm of 5
and / or 7 chromosomes.
Methods: A case presented of an 11-year-old patient with AML, which
developing 3 years after combination therapy. Histological, cytogenetic,
immunological studies of bone marrow trepanobiopatate, analysis of clin-
ical and laboratory findings.
Results: A suboccipital craniotomy, microsurgical removal of a tumour
of the cerebellum and IV ventricle was performed in 2014. Conclusion of
the pathological examination: ependymoma with increased proliferative
activity, Grade II. From 2015 to 2017, 25 courses of chimiotherapy (tem-
ozolomide+etoposide) were carried out, since 2017 radiotherapy after the
2nd and 3rd relapses, in 2018 radiosurgical treatment for the frontal,
temporal, parietal regions, the cerebellopontine angle and the region of
the 4th ventricle. In 2019, in bone marrow punctate: a population of
anaplastic blast cells with pronounced cytoplasmic clasmatosis was iden-
tified. FISH study revealed monosomy 7 in 95% of nuclei. The
immunophenotype of the blast population corresponded to acute myeloid
leukaemia, with co-expression of CD7, CD56.
Conclusion: The causes of AML in this patient could be excessive doses
of radiotherapy during treatment, high doses of chemotherapy drugs and a
large number of chemotherapy courses. Treatment-associated leukaemias
have a medical and social problem, as they are refractory to treatment and
are associated with poor survival, which implies the importance of choos-
ing an adequate treatment strategy for patients with cancer.

Medicine, Poland
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Common variable immunodeficiency
(CVID) is the most frequent humoral immunity disorder with the onset
in the 3rd-5th decade of life. Patients with CVID have a high relative risk
(30 up to 400x) of developing different lymphoproliferation, mainly B-
cell lymphomas.
Methods: We present a 41-year-old female with CVID who has remained
in 6 years observation in our hospital because of autoimmune haemolytic
anaemia and mild hepatosplenomegaly. In 2019 due to localized lymph-
adenopathy, the histological and flow cytometric assessment of inguinal
lymph node (LN) was performed without conclusive results and con-
firmed TCR clonality.
Results: In 2020 the patient was hospitalized because of generalized
lymphadenopathy with significant splenomegaly and fever. The cervical
LN excisional biopsy and trephine biopsy were performed.
Histopathological evaluation of the LN revealed a diffuse proliferation
of medium-large-sized lymphocytes with following immunophenotype:
CD20(+),Pax5(+),CD10(-),Bcl6(-/+),MUM1(+),FOXP1(+),Bcl2(+
),IgM(+),c-myc(-),CD5(-),CyclinD1(-),Tdt(-),CD34(-),CD43(-),
CD123(-),CD138(-),CD30(+)single cells,CD23(-),ALK1(-),Ki67-80%.
The trephine biopsy examination demonstrated hypercellular bone marrow
(BM) with nodular, paratrabecular infiltration of medium-large-sized atypi-
cal cells expressing CD20, Pax5 and MUM1. The PET imaging showed
metabolicactiveproliferationinmultipleLNbothsidesofdiaphragm,spleen
and BM. The patient was treated with R-CHOP regimen for six courses.
Conclusion: The diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), NOS, non-
GCB type with 50% of BM involvement was diagnosed. The clinical
course of this patient emphasizes the variable nature of lymphoprolifera-
tive lesions arising in patients with CVID and underscores an individual-
ized approach to pathologic interpretation and diagnostic intervention.
Patients with CVID have increased susceptibility toward developing lym-
phoma and should stay under close observation.

Primary follicular lymphoma of the femur – challenging diagnosis in
different histopathological diagnostic techniques.

*Institute of Haematology and Transfusion Medicine, Diagnostic
Haematology Department, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research
Institute of Oncology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory
Medicine, Poland
Background & objectives: Primary non-Hodgkin lymphomas of bone
(PBL) are uncommon, mainly including large B-cell lymphomas (>80%).
Follicular Lymphoma (FL) is an indolent nodal disease of adults above 60.
Bone localization is usually reported as the progression of nodal cases.
Methods: We present a 23-year-old male with a tumour localized in the
proximal epiphysis of the left femur, metabolically active infiltration
starting below the neck and extending downwards about 60 mm with
visible discrete sclerotization below the neck and minor lytic changes;
discontinuity of the border lamina of the lesser trochanter (SUV max
10.7) and infiltration of soft tissues was seen.
Results: For the diagnosis, the intraoperative examination followed by
flow-cytometry (FMC) and postoperative material evaluation was per-
formed. The infiltration with centrocytes and centroblasts was seen pre-
senting immunophenotype: CD20(+),Pax5(+),LMO2(+),BCL2(+/-)
weaker,BCL6(+),CD10(-),FOXP1(-),CD5(-),MUM1(-),TdT(-),Ki67(+)
in 90% of cells. In FMC compared to the nodal FL, the case was charac-
terized by lack of CD10 and monoclonal-light-chain, low expression of
CD81 and BCL2, with CD54 and CD49d aberrant manifestation. PET
imaging revealed metastatic lesions in the liver and spleen; the final
staging was CSIVA and low-risk FLIPI1/2 and PRIMA. The patient
underwent 8xRCVP followed by 2 years of rituximab maintenance with
complete metabolic remission. The patient remains free of disease in 30
months of follow-up.
Conclusion: In conclusion, primary FL of bone is the casuistic phenom-
enon of unclear prognosis. The presented case is unique because of the
primary localization and young age of the patient. The differential diag-
nosis with primary/metastatic bone tumours by the intraoperative exam-
ination supported with FMC was essential to avoid over-therapy by sur-
gical treatment. In the presented case, after immunochemotherapy, spec-
tacular remission was seen with more than a 2-years follow-up.

Erdheim-Chester disease: report of a challenging case through mul-
tidisciplinary collaboration
S. Tzorakoleftheraki*, G. Kaiafa, D. Pilalas, C. Savvopoulos, T. Koletsa
*Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Aristotle University of
Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece
Background & objectives: Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare
clonal non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, recognized as a neoplasm in
2016. Less than 1000 cases have been reported. Herein, we report a case
of ECD diagnosed after repeat biopsies emphasizing the histologic dif-
ferences between them.
Methods: A 58-year-old male was admitted to the hospital due to slightly
elevated temperature, presenting frequently during the past two years.
PET/CT and MRI were performed, revealing infiltration of perirenal tis-
sue, which was biopsied and sent to our pathology department. The pa-
tient had undergone biopsy twice before and the corresponding slides
were retrieved from our archives and reviewed.
Results: Histological sections revealed among collagen fibres, a few histio-
cytes with abundant foamy (xanthomatous) cytoplasm and small nuclei, ei-
ther single or in small clusters. Multinucleated histiocytes were identified
rarely. Immunohistochemically, these cells were positive for CD68, fascin
and cyclinD1 and negative for S100, CD1a, ALK and tryptase. Molecular
analysis revealed BRAFV600E mutation. Upon correlating pathological with
clinical and radiological features (hairy kidney appearance), the findings were
consistent with ECD. Instead, the reviewed slides showed dense
lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, predominantly plasmacytic, in a background
of storiform fibrosis, with scarce or few foamy histiocytes, resembling mostly
IgG4-related disease. However, there was no increase in number of IgG4+
plasma cells or an abnormal IgG4+/IgG+ ratio.
Conclusion: ECD usually presents with non-specific clinical and histo-
pathologic findings, posing diagnostic challenges. Perirenal tissue fibro-
sis along with chronic inflammation may lead to overlook foamy histio-
cytic cells, if they are few. When perirenal biopsy specimens present
histopathologic features of non-specific inflammatory response or
IgG4-related disease, ECD should be included in the differential diagno-
sis and repeat biopsy may be of merit. A multidisciplinary approach is
required for the diagnosis and treatment of ECD.

An incidental diagnosis: a rare entity of primary uterine cervical
lymphoma concurrent with endometrial adenocarcinoma
İ. Usta*, F. Öz Puyan, E. Mercan Demirtaş, E. Genc Erdogan
*Department of Pathology, Trakya University, School of Medicine,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Primary lymphomas of the female genital tract
(FGT) are rare and account for 0.18% of extra nodal lymphomas. Coexistence
of primary lymphoma and primary epithelial tumour in the FGT is extremely
rare. Unlike systemic lymphomas, there are no B symptoms.
Methods: A 53-year-old woman presented with vaginal bleeding. The
patient was operated with a pre-diagnosis of endometrial malignancy.
Endometrioid type endometrial adenocarcinoma was seen in the hyster-
ectomy material. Also, far from this malignancy, in the uterine cervical
stroma, atypic lymphocytic infiltration was observed. It has been proven
by immunohistochemical studies that it has B cell immunophenotype and
high ki67 proliferation index.
Virchows Arch
Results: Macroscopically, a well-circumscribed, soft and brownish area
limited to the cervical submucosa, with 7 mm in diameter was identified.
Histopathological examination revealed atypic lymphocytic infiltration in
the cervical wall. Diffuse immunostaining for B cell markers, high pro-
liferation rate, angioinvasion and monoclonality for immunoglobulin
heavy chain on FISH study of the infiltration directed us to call the lesion
as an early onset of B cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma without lymph node
involvement. Further radiological studies revealed also no other nodal
disease. The patient was accepted as primary uterine cervical lymphoma
concurrent with endometrial adenocarcinoma.
Conclusion: Cervical lymphomas typically produce bulky lesions just
below the intact surface epithelium. Primary cervical lymphomas are
usually localized and have a favourable prognosis than secondary ones.
Due to their rarity, lymphomas are often not considered in a female
genital tract and can be misdiagnosed as inflammatory reactive processes.
Therefore, even a small lymphoid infiltration containing atypical cells
should be evaluated closely and immunohistochemical methods should
be used. Awareness and histology are essential for the correct diagnosis of
this curable malignancy.

Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the renal pelvis: an unexpected
find in nephroureterectomy specimen
G.G. Yange Zambrano*, G. Moreno-De-Juan, N. González-Ortega, R.
Ramos-Asensio, G. Coronado-Vilca, J. García-Reyero, J. Yange-
Zambrano, S. Costas-Ochoa, M.d.M. del Barrio-Molina
*Department of Pathology, Mateu Orfila Hospital, IB-Salut, Maó
(Menorca), Spain
Background & objectives: To report on a case of Marginal Zone B-cell
lymphoma of the Renal Pelvis and update the literature concerning this topic.
Methods: A 72-year-old woman diagnosed with urothelial carcinoma of the
bladder (pT1) 4 years ago by TUR and subsequently treated with BCG. On
TC and NMR, an expansive solid lesion was observed in the renal sinus, with
effacement of its edges and fat of the left renal hilum. Surgery was performed
for the presumed diagnosis of upper urinary tract tumour.
Results: In the left-nephroureterectomy specimen, a mass of brownish-
coloration and firm-consistency of 5.3 x 4 cm was observed occupying the
renal pelvis, in continuity with the adipose tissue of the renal sinus as seen in
the serial-sections. Histologicallyshowed a vaguelynodular growthlymphoid
neoplasm, consisting of small regular cells with few blasts, some small atro-
phic centres. Immunohistochemically, was positive for CD20, CD79a,
BCL2, IgD. Ki67 low. Negative for CyclinD1, CD5, CD23, CD10, BCL6,
GCET1, SOX11, CD3, CD138. Low-grade small B-cell non-Hodgkin lym-
phoma, compatible with Marginal Zone Lymphoma was diagnosed. The
patient has not received chemotherapy and remains alive and well with no
evidence of recurrence on careful follow-up 3 months-postoperatively.
Conclusion: Marginal Zone B-cell lymphoma of the upper urinary tract is
an extremely rare condition and because there are no specific findings on
either radiographic or blood examinations pre-treatment diagnosis is diffi-
cult. There are around 15 reported cases and in the vast majority of them,
the diagnosis was made by nephroureterectomy. Therefore, we consider
that the pathological examination is the key to its preoperative diagnosis.

Metastasis of follicular thyroid carcinoma to the mandible as the first
clinical sign: a rare case report
T.N. Albuquerque Gomes Nogueira*, I. Albuquerque Nogueira, J.
Magalhães Saldanha
*UFC, Brazil
Background & objectives: Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) metasta-
sizes in 10 to 15% of cases. However, metastasis to the mandible is
extremely rare. We describe a
case of FTC in which metastasis to the mandible was detected prior to that
of the primary tumour.
Methods: A forty-eight-year-old woman from Fortaleza, Brazil present-
ed to medical service complaining of pain and swelling in left lower jugal
mucosa. An x-ray showed an intraosseous lesion in the mandible extend-
ing to soft tissues. Incisional biopsy was performed, and the specimen
was processed and examined by H&E technique and
immunohistochemistry.
Results: Microscopically, the lesion consisted in follicular epithelial neo-
plasia with colloid production. Immunohistochemistry revealed TTF1
and thyroglobulin expression, indicating metastatic follicular thyroid car-
cinoma. Subsequent investigation showed primary right lobe follicular
thyroid carcinoma, with the mandible metastasis being the single one
identified.
Conclusion: Metastatic carcinomas to oral region are rare, accounting for
approximately one percent of oral cancer. Metastatic tumours of the oral
region are of great importance, since some are responsible for the single
signs/symptoms of primary tumours. It is believed that one third of pa-
tients with oral methastasis do not have the primary tumour identified.
The present case highlights the importance of prompt recognition of FTC
metastasis to the mandible, especially when the primary tumour is yet to
be identified.

Submandibular myelolipoma with osseous metaplasia: a rare tu-
mour arising in an unfamiliar territory
A. Ali*, F. Al-Hashimi, M. Musa
*Broomfield Hospital, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Extra-adrenal myelolipoma is a benign rare
lesion with reported sites including the mediastinum, thoracic spine and
kidney. Osseous metaplasia has rarely been observed within. We present
a never-reported case in the English literature of a submandibular
myelolipoma with osseous metaplasia.
Methods: A 76-year-old male presented with a firm left submandibular
lesion, measuring 3x2.7cm. On ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) the lesion was well-demarcated and showed fatty areas in
the background of heavy calcification. An US-guided biopsy was obtained.
Results: Microscopic examination of the lesion showed lobules of mature
adipose tissue, with trilinear hematopoietic elements composed of mye-
loid cells with few clusters of erythroid cells and megakaryocytes.
Extensive areas of osseous metaplasia were seen. No atypical or malig-
nant features were identified. A diagnosis of myelolipoma with osseous
metaplasia was made.
Conclusion: This is the first reported case in the English literature of
myelolipoma with osseous metaplasia occurring in the submandibular
region. Distinguishing this from other possible differential diagnoses in-
cluding extramedullary haematopoiesis, hamartoma, liposarcoma and ter-
atoma is necessary. We also propose a new name of “Osteomyelolipoma”
in exchange of the using of 'osseous metaplasia' as this would reflect the
extensive formation of mature bone formation which we believe that it
does constitute an integral part of this neoplasm.

Nasopharyngeal Warthin tumour: a forgotten entity that is worth
revisiting
A. Ali*, F. Al-Hashimi
*Broomfield Hospital, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Extra-parotid Warthin tumour (WT) is rare,
with few reported cases in oral cavity, larynx and cervical lymph nodes.
Virchows Arch
Nasopharyngeal WT is extremely rare, with only a handful reported cases
in the literature. We present a case of this rare entity.
Methods: The presented case is of a 77-year smoker man, who presented
with a unilateral earache. Nasendoscopy showed a 1x2cm nasopharyn-
geal mass occupying the post-nasal space and blocking Eustachian tube.
These findings were confirmed by radiological imaging.
Results: Microscopic examination showed respiratory-type mucosa with
underlying lymphoid rich connective tissue, comprising a cyst lined by a
double-layered oncocytic epithelium. A diagnosis of Warthin tumour
arising in minor salivary gland tissue in the nasopharynx was made.
The differential diagnosis includes extensive Warthin-like/oncocytic
metaplasia arising in a cyst wall.
Conclusion: Nasopharyngeal WT is a rare and overlooked entity. Little is
known on the biologic mechanism for extraparotideal WT; however, it is
thought to be due to entrapment of thymic/lymphoid tissue during the
embryonic descent and proliferation of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th pharyngeal
pouches.

F. Antoniadou*, S. Pappa, A. Dimitriadi, X. Grammatoglou, A.
Kostopoulou, E. Zacharioudaki, T. Choreftaki
*"G.Gennimatas" General Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: We present a case of Biphenotypic Sinonasal
Sarcoma of the left frontal sinus.
Methods: A fifty year old woman was presented in our hospital with
nasal obstruction and difficulty in breathing. Imaging of the visceral skull
revealed a heterogenous destructive mass. Several tissue fragments were
taken and sent for histologic examination.
Results: Histologically, the tissue fragments were partly covered by re-
spiratory epithelium. In the adjacent haemorrhagic and myxoid stroma an
uncapsulated tumour was observed. It was composed of spindle cells
arranged in fascicles and in some areas a herringbone pattern and sparse
glandular structures were noticed. Significant mitotic activity or nuclear
pleomorphism were not observed. Immunohistochemistry revealed posi-
tivity for Vimentin, patchy expression of S100, SMA and negativity for
Pankeratin, Ck7, h-caldesmon, Desmin, CD34, SOX-10, STAT-6, EMA,
NF, GFAP, FXIIIα, Mart-1 and HMB45. Ki67 was 3-5%. From all the
above, the diagnosis of Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma with myogenic
and neurogenic characteristics was made. Molecular test in combination
with Pax-5 positivity confirmed the diagnosis.
Conclusion: Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma is a low grade spindle cell
tumour. Its molecular signature is a recurrent PAX3- MAML3 gene fu-
sion. It involves various sites in the sinonasal tract and affects females 2
times more often. It grows slowly and can invade local tissues. Half of the
patients report local recurrence even years after the first treatment. No
death or metastatic disease have been reported so far.

Papouliakos, G. Kakiopoulos, T. Choreftaki
*"G.Gennimatas" General Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: We present a case of angiomyolipoma (
AML) of the left nostril.
Methods: An eighty-three-year-old male was presented in our hospital
due to epistaxis and difficulty in breathing. Endoscopically, a polypoid
lesion of 1,3x 1,3x 0,7cm in dimensions was removed and was sent for
histological examination.
Results: Histologically, a well circumscribed, polypoid lesion was seen,
lined by respiratory epithelium. The stroma was composed of smooth
muscle cells, fat cells and dystrophic thick-walled blood vessels. As a
rule, there is coexpression of myoid (Desmin, SMA), lipoid (S100) and
melanocytic markers (HMB45). The last marker is usually negative in
AMLs of the nasal cavity.
Conclusion: Angiomyolipoma, is a benign mesenchymal neoplasm and
is usually associated with Tuberous Sclerosis. Nasal AML is very rare,
composed of thick dysmorphic vessels, smooth muscle and adipose tis-
sue. Each component is presented in a variable amount. Surgical excision
is usually curative.

A. Zakhama, R. Hadhri
*Department of Pathology, Chu Fattouma Bourguiba Monastir, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Bone and cartilaginous metaplasia represent
a rare findings in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), reported in associ-
ation with aggressive behaviour. We report two cases of PTC with exten-
sive calcification, bone and cartilaginous metaplasia and we describe its
histopathological features.
Methods: We report the cases of a 79-year-old man and a 40-year-old
woman presenting with multinodular thyroid associated to cervical
lymphadenopathy. Fine needle aspiration cytology concluded to PTC.
Total thyroidectomy with lymph node dissection was performed for the
two patients. The Surgical specimens were analysed in the Department of
Pathology of the University Hospital of Monastir.
Results: Bilateral thyroid gland involvement by multifocal PTC with
extrathyroidal extension and multiple lymph node metastasis was noted
in both cases. The tumour had papillary and follicular architecture.
Psammoma bodies were absent. In the first case, the stroma contained a
large foci of calcification associated to mature bony trabeculae and carti-
laginous lobule. Marrow fat tissue was identified between mature bony
trabeculae, and occasionally hematopoietic cells were observed. In the
second case, the tumour showed foci of mature bone formation associated
to lymphocytic thyroiditis.
Conclusion: Among malignant thyroid tumours, papillary thyroid carci-
noma most frequently demonstrates calcification and bone metaplasia.
Despite its rare occurrence, PTC with osseous metaplasia should be rec-
ognized as an histological variant by the WHO classification of endocrine
tumours because it is correlated to a poor prognosis.

Ameloblastic fibroma: a rare entity of the mandibule - case report
A. Ben Mabrouk*, A. Bdioui, Z. Lajmi, E. Ben Ammou, W. Majdoub, A.
Baccouche, S. Hmissa
*Department of Pathology, Sahloul Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Ameloblastic fibroma is a rare benign tu-
mour. It accounts for 2.5% of all odontogenic tumours and 80% of it
occurs in the mandible. It is more common in children. We report the
clinicopathological features of this entity as well as the evolutionary
aspects.
Methods: A female child aged 7 years consulted for a right mandibular
tumefaction first discovered a month ago.
On examination, it was a firm and an encapsulated mass measuring
2.5cm. Imaging showed a radiolucent lesion involving the horizontal
branch of the mandible. Surgical enucleation of the mass and gingival
biopsy on front of the lesion were done and sent for histopathological
examination.
Results: Grossly, we received a white well defined, firm and lobular mass
measuring 3cm. In cut, it had a white colour with some calcifications.
With the mass we received a gingival fragment measuring 2 cm.
Histologic examination showed a cellular connective tissue stroma com-
prising odontogenic epithelium arranged in the form of islands and cords
of varying size and shape. These structures were lined by cuboidal-to-
Virchows Arch
columnar ameloblast-like cells. The connective tissue component resem-
bled the dental papilla. It was characterized by numerous plump fibro-
blasts which were angular and oval in shape in a myxoid background.
There were no atypia or mitosis. The diagnosis of ameloblastic fibroma
was made.
Conclusion: Ameloblastic fibromas are benign neoplasms of
odontogenic epithelium and mesenchymal tissues, and as such are cate-
gorized as mixed odontogenic tumour. The presence of mitosis should
expand the differential diagnosis to include malignant entities such as
ameloblastic fibrosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry generally does not
aid in differentiating ameloblastic fibroma from other mixed odontogenic
tumours. Treatment considered is meticulous enucleation and curettage of
surrounding bone. However, concerns regarding its recurrence and its
malignant transformation have to be kept in mind and require a long-
term follow-up.

Unusual gingival enlargement post radiotherapy: a report of 2 cases
E. Ben Ammou*, A. Bdioui, A. Ben Mabrouk, W. Majdoub, Z. Lajmi, T.
Dahmoul, H. Hamchi, S. Hmissa
*Department of Pathology, Sahloul University Hospital Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Radiotherapy is a cornerstone in the treat-
ment of cancer. However, complications do arise. Radiation-induced sar-
comas are rare high-grade malignancies evolving within 3 to 55 years
following the radiotherapy. These tumours are associated with poorer
prognosis compared to primary sarcomas.
Methods: We report 2 cases of such tumours highlighting the importance
of the clinical history of the patient to the pathological diagnosis.
Results: The first case is 49-year-old male treated by radio-chemotherapy
20years ago for an undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma tumour,
presenting with a 4cm ulcerated gingival growth of the posterior region of
the maxillary. Our 2nd case is a 71-year-old female who underwent man-
dibular resection and radiotherapy 2years ago for a gingival moderately-
differentiated squamous-cell carcinoma presenting with a 4cm white fri-
able mass lining the radiation site growing alarmingly fast. On biopsy
both tumours were poorly differentiated showing elongated fascicles of
spindle cells and scattered polygonal cells with a vacuolated cytoplasm,
marked nuclear atypia and high abnormal mitotic count. The IHC profile
was: vimentin(+), smooth-muscle-actin(+), H-caldesmone(+),
Cytokeratin(-), P63(-) concluding to high grade leiomyosarcomas.
Conclusion: A recurrence of the primary tumour should always be ruled
out. However, taking into consideration the clinical history of the patient
is a valuable clue particularly in cases of former radiation treatment.
Radio-induced sarcomas call for heavy medical treatment and extensive
surgery to improve survival, thus pathologists should be aware of the rare
but very plausible risk.

Case report: a 47-year-old man with a primary intraosseous carci-
noma, NOS
M. Dieaconu*, M. Danciu
*“Sf. Spiridon” Emergency Clinical Hospital Iasi, Romania
Background & objectives: Primary intraosseous carcinoma (PIOC) is a
rare aggressive malignant odontogenic tumour with poor prognosis. We
present the case of a 47-year-old man referred by the dentist to the max-
illofacial surgery department for investigation of a suspect mandibular
ulceration.
Methods: Intraoral examination revealed an ulceration measuring 14/
6mm of the right mandibular epithelium between 4.5-4.6 by loss of sen-
sitivity. Radiography showed a unilocular radiolucency extending from
the distal side of 4.5 to the ramus. The surgical resection specimen was
fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin embedded. HE staining and immuno-
histochemical tests were performed.
Results: Macroscopically, an ulcerated, grey, infiltrative intraosseous
lesion, measuring 14/6/4mm was identified. Microscopic examination
revealed an epithelial neoplasm with squamous differentiation, with ex-
tensive intraosseous destruction, infiltrating of the surrounding soft tissue.
The tumour cells were arranged in nests and islands, showing
hyperchromatic nuclei with mild pleomorphism, abundant pale eosino-
philic or vacuolar cytoplasm, rare abnormal mitotic figures, but no kera-
tinization. Vascular invasion was present. The tumour had no connection
with the gingival epithelium. On immunohistochemistry, the tumour cells
were diffusely and intense positive for CK19 and negative for p63.
Considering that no oral mucosal dysplasia/carcinoma was identified
and the CT-scan revealed no other tumour, the final diagnosis was pri-
mary intraosseous carcinoma, NOS.
Conclusion: PIOC is a diagnosis of exclusion. This aggressive central
jaw carcinoma, assumed to derive from the odontogenic epithelium needs
differential diagnosis with metastases, squamous odontogenic tumour,
solid odontogenic keratocyst, keratinizing ameloblastoma and central
high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Histopathological, clinical and
radiographic features assure an accurate diagnosis. Due to the high recur-
rence rate and poor prognosis, PIOC should be aggressively treated.
Multimodal treatment has been reported to provide a 3-year survival rate
of 40%.

*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Instituto Português de Oncologia de
Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Lisbon, Portugal
Background & objectives: Acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) is a rare sali-
vary gland neoplasm, usually low-grade and indolent. We report a rare
case of ACC with aggressive behaviour, associated with paraneoplastic
Cushing’s syndrome (CS) due to ectopic ACTH production.
Methods: The clinical history was collected from the clinical files.
Histology and cytology samples were reviewed and immunohistochemistry
for ACTH was performed. PubMed search for similar cases was done.
Results: A 60-year-old-man presented with a laterocervical mass.
Imaging studies revealed a 4cm parotid gland tumour, homolateral
lymphadenopathies and multiple lung, pleural and bone lesions.
FNAC/biopsies from the laterocervical mass and one of the lung’s nod-
ules revealed tumour compatible with ACC. The patient was admitted for
parotidectomy and neck dissection but, on surgery’s day, a hypertensive
crisis precluded the procedure. The patient remained hospitalized due to
further decompensated diabetes mellitus, hypokalemia and dyslipidemia.
Serum ACTH/cortisol and 24-hour urine cortisol levels were elevated.
ACTH immunohistochemistry was performed in one of the pathology
specimen and immunostaining was observed. Diagnosis of paraneoplastic
CS due to ectopic ACTH producing metastatic ACC was rendered.
Conclusion: We describe a rare case of an usually indolent tumour that
presented ab initio with disseminated metastatic disease. Furthermore,
three months after the diagnosis the paraneoplastic CS developed, poten-
tially creating diagnostic questions as this syndrome is more frequently
associated with tumours like lung small cell carcinoma or carcinoids. To
our knowledge this is the tenth case described with this association. Due
to its rarity, increased awareness of this phenomenon can avoid potential-
ly misdiagnosis and delays in the treatment.

Background & objectives: Melanotic schwannoma is a nerve sheath
tumour with a uniform composition of variably melanin-producing
Schwann cells and metastatic potential. It is an uncommon neoplasm,
accounting for less than 1% of all nerve sheath tumours.
Methods: We report a case of a 64 years-old woman having an 8cm mass
on the left lateral region of the neck for many years, that lately has
enlarged. FNA showed a melanotic schwannoma and radical resection
was performed. The tumour was located under the vessels of the spine,
below the n.vagus(VI) and seemed to becoming out of the ganglion.
Results: Macroscopically the tumour an ovoid well circumscribed mass
covered by a thin fibrous membrane, measured 8cm. The cut surface had
the consistency of tar. Microscopical examination showed plump spindle
and epithelioid cells arranged in interlacing fascicles and nests, with
round or ovoid nuclei, containing delicate chromatin and small distinct
nucleoli. Accumulation of melanin was noticed in neoplastic cells and
associated melanophages. Necrosis was present and Ki67 was approxi-
mately 25% (4mitoses/10 HPF). Immunohistochemical staining for S100,
SOX10, HMB45, MelanA, p16, collagen IV and Vimentin produced
positive results. BRAF V600E was not expressed in tumour cells.
Conclusion: A diagnosis of MMNST (malignant melanocytic nerve
sheath tumour / melanotic schwannoma) was performed, in the differen-
tial diagnostic context of which is malignant melanoma. Four months
after surgery an extradural metastasis in the L3-L4-S1 spinal region oc-
curred, that was successfully removed. Two months after the patient is
free of recurrence.

Unexpected location of adult type rhabdomyoma
Y. Günsoy Kılıç*, Ö. Ekinci
*Gazi University Medical School, Turkey
Background & objectives: Rhabdomyoma is a benign tumour with
skeletal or cardiac muscle cell differentiation, and it is divided into foetal,
juvenile, adult subtypes on the basis of histology. Common localizations
are the parapharyngeal space, larynx, submandibular, paratracheal region,
tongue.
Methods: We present a case localized to the nasopharyngeal area in a 56-
year-old man. Examination of the nasopharynx showed an irregular area
of 1x0.5 cm in the left half of the nasopharynx. Microscopic examination
was performed after surgical excision. Desmin and S100 markers were
used for immunohistochemical evaluation.
Results: The histology shows polyglonal tumour cells, which are de-
scribed as "spider cells"; no significant and mitotic activities or atypia
can be detected. Tumour cells were desmin positive and negative for
S100. Diagnostically, the histological findings are compatible with adult
type rhabdomyoma.
Conclusion: Only 4 cases of nasopharyngeal rhabdomyoma have been
reported to date. We report on a patient with a tumour manifestation that
fifth in the literature: a rhabdomyoma of the adult type located in the
nasopharynx.

A. Golovyuk, E. Pudova, A. Kudryavtseva
*Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of
Sciences, Moscow, Russia
Background & objectives: Middle ear (ME) paragangliomas (PGLs)
belong to the most hereditarily driven of all human tumours and are
associated with several genes, including SDHx. Immunohistochemistry
(IHC) of SDH subunits can identify the germline mutations in the corre-
sponding genes.
Methods: We performed the analysis of expression SDH subunits in 14
MEPGLs using IHC. Immunoreactions were performed with the
following primary antibodies: SDHA, monoclonal, clone
2E3GC12FB2AE2; SDHB, monoclonal, clone 21A11AE7; SDHC,
monoclonal, clone EPR11035(B); SDHD, polyclonal from Abcam
(UK). SDHB staining was assessed as positive, negative, or weak diffuse.
IHC of SDHA, SDHC, and SDHD was scored as positive or negative.
Results: In all tumours, we detected positive staining of SDHA and
SDHB. In one sample, negative SDHD expression was detected. In the
same tumour, we found negative immunostaining of SDHC. Notably, in
six tumours we observed an SDHC expression pattern that looks like weak
diffuse staining; it was defined as the positive expression of the subunit.
Conclusion: IHC of the SDHB subunit has been proposed as a useful
method to predict underlying SDHx mutations of hereditary PGLs.
Negative or weak diffuse staining of SDHB is associated with the disrup-
tion of the SDH complex caused by germline mutations in any SDHx
genes. In the study cohort, we did not find changed SDHB staining,
which can indicate the absence of SDHx pathogenic variants.

Epitheloid haemangioendothelioma of the nasal cavity: a challenging
diagnosis
M. Krifa*, S. Chaieb, D. Chiba, N. Abdessaied, S. Mestiri, A.
Benabdelkader, M. Mokni
*University Hospital of Sahloul, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Epithelioid haemangioendothelioma (EHE)
is an unusual vascular neoplasm of intermediate malignancy. It has an
indolent course, with the potential for local recurrence. We aim to de-
scribe the pathological aspects of the EHE and discuss the main differen-
tial diagnoses.
Methods: We presented a case of a 39-year-old Tunisian woman, with
personal and family history of allergic rhinitis. She presented an intermit-
tent epistaxis resistant to the medical treatment for 2 months. A nasal
endoscopy was done and showed a polyp of the right nasal septum,
bleeding on contact. An endoscopic resection was performed.
Results: The pathological examination showed a firm polyp with brown-
ish cut section and myxoid appearance. Histologically, the surface squa-
mous epithelium was widely ulcerated with a fibrino-leukocyte coating.
The axis of the polyp showed a vascular tumour proliferation made by
epithelioid endothelial cells organized in nests and primitive vascular
formations. The tumour cells had a moderately abundant acidophilic
and vacuolated cytoplasm. Occasionally, erythrocytes were seen within
the cytoplasmic vacuoles. The mitotic activity was quite high. The
stroma-reaction varied from fibro-hyaline to myxoid. Necrosis was ab-
sent. The immunochemical analysis showed CD31, ERG and FLI1 cells
tumour positivity. The diagnosis of EHE of the right nasal septum was
retained.
Conclusion: EHE, first reported by Weiss and Enzinger, is an uncommon
vascular tumour of soft tissue. EHE has clinical and histological features
intermediate between those of benign haemangioma and conventional
angiosarcoma. It is occasionally seen in the soft tissue of the head and
neck area. Due to its rarity and histological similarity to other tumours, the
diagnosis of EHE can be challenging. Surgical excision is the treatment of
choice when it is limited to the nasal cavity.

Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma presenting two uncommon
components: apocrine epithelial–myoepithelial carcinoma and squa-
mous cell carcinoma

Durzyńska
Virchows Arch
*Department of Pathology and Laboratory Diagnostics, Maria
Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, Warsaw,
Poland
Background & objectives: Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (Ca-ex-
PA) is defined as a carcinoma arising in the epithelial and/or myoepithelial
component of a PA. The carcinomatous component encompasses various
histological tumour types including epithelial–myoepithelial carcinoma
(EMCa) and rarely squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
Methods: We describe a case of hybrid Ca-ex-PA with apocrine EMCa
and SCC components. A 52-years old male presented with a rapidly
growing extensive mass expanding from submandibular region to
parapharyngeal space. Both, submandibular and parapharyngeal loca-
tions were biopted and the initial diagnosis was simultaneous neoplasms:
Ca-ex-PA and SCC, respectively. The case was referred to our depart-
ment for histopathological review.
Results: Histologically, the sample from the submandibular region pre-
sented a neoplasm arranged in a multinodular pattern, consisting of PA
morphology areas and carcinomatous bilayered tubular structures. The
inner/ductal cells were eosinophilic with apical snouts in the lumina and
presented high-grade nuclear atypia, high mitotic activity with atypical
figures. The outer/myoepithelial cells were polygonal with clear cyto-
plasm forming more than one layer. Immunohistochemically the cells
were: luminal-AR[+], mammaglobin[+], GCDFP15[+], GATA3[+],
CK7[+], HER3+, abluminal-p63 [+], p40[+], S100[+]. The
parapharyngeal space sample evaluation revealed an area of infiltrative
squamous differentiation without relation to the epidermis and small
foci of PA. The Ki-67 index for SCC fields was 50%. PLAG1 rear-
rangement by FISH was confirmed for both glandular and squamous
components.
Conclusion: The final diagnosis was Ca-ex-PA with apocrine EMCa and
SCC components. The FISH study was crucial for diagnosis as it had
revealed a PLAG1 rearrangement in samples form submandibular region
and parapharyngeal space, which confirms that both carcinomatous com-
ponents developed within PA. Both neoplasms are exceedingly rare,
moreover their coexistence have not been previously documented.
Pathologists should be familiar with the Ca-ex-PA phenomenon with
multiple components and use molecular testing for ambiguous cases of
simultaneous neoplasms.

Recurrent and metastasizing parapharyngeal pleomorphic adeno-
ma: a paradoxical behaviour
S.S. Lim*, D. Abdullah
*Histopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Melaka,
Malaysia
Background & objectives: De novo occurrence of pleomorphic adenoma
in the parapharyngeal space is rare [1][7][8]. Moreover, histologically be-
nign parapharyngeal pleomorphic adenoma that manifests local or distant
metastasis are even rarer with no reported cases found in literature [8].
Methods: A 72 year old lady came with dysphagia, odynophagia and
sore throat for 1 month at initial presentation in 2014. She was diagnosed
with left parapharyngeal pleomorphic adenoma with the size of
65x40x25mm. A transcervical excision of the mass was performed and
the excision margins were free.
Results: She returned with multiple recurrences in 2017, 2018 and 2020
with regional metastasis to level Ib node in 2017, followed by metastasis
to level Ia, III and IV nodes in 2020. She is still under regular otolaryn-
gology clinic follow up.
Microscopy: Review of all H&E slides from 2014 till 2020 show similar
well-circumscribed and partially encapsulated triphasic tumour com-
posed of epithelial cells, myoepithelial cells and chondromyxoid stroma
with bland cytology and low mitotic activity (average of 2 per 2mm2).
There are no necrosis and perineural or vascular invasion.
Immunohistochemical profile: CK AE1/AE3 and CK7 highlight the ep-
ithelial component whereas SMA and p63 highlight the myoepithelial
component.
Conclusion: Pleomorphic adenoma can metastasize while preserving its
benign cytological features and thus, must be kept as a diagnostic con-
sideration in known cases of pleomorphic adenoma [1]. At present, there
are no reliable histological, immunohistochemical or molecular parame-
ters to predict the metastatic potential of pleomorphic adenoma [2][6].
However, local recurrence after surgical excision is shown to be a risk
[2][5]. Therefore, further research is required to identify the biological
reasons behind the aggressive behaviour of the tumour.

Lymphoepithelial cyst of the tonsil: a case report
L. Kondirolli, B. Blakaj Gashi, L. Ymeri, N. Avdiu, R. Limani*
*Institute of Anatomical Pathology Faculty of Medicine and University
Clinical Center of Kosovo, Albania
Background & objectives: Oral lymphoepithelial cysts are uncommon
benign lesions that develop within the oral and pharyngeal lymphoid
tissue. Tonsillar involvement usually presents itself as a painless
yellowish/ white nodule. Herein, we report a case of lymphoepithelial
cyst (LEC) arising in the tonsil.
Methods: We will describe a case of lymphoepithelial cyst of the right tonsil
in a 20-year-old woman. The patient complained of a lump in the throat and
underwent excisional biopsy. There were no postsurgical complications.
Results: Grossly, the lesion appeared pedunculated, cystic, with soft
whitish material in the lumen. The greatest diameter of the lesion was
1.4 cm. Histopathological features showed a cystic cavity containing
keratin, inflammatory cells and desquamated squamous cells. The cystic
wall was lined with parakeratinized stratified squamous epithelium,
surrounded by lymphoid tissue with germinal centres.
Conclusion: LEC as a benign lesion can be found in different parts of the
body, including the pancreas, mediastinum, thyroid and head and neck
region. Despite its rare occurrence, LEC should be considered in the
differential diagnosis of tonsillar nodules.

Combining nanostructured microfluidic chip with pMHCI-
pentamer enables enumeration and functional assessment of circu-
lating antigen-specificCD8+T cells in HPV-associated head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma
H. Liu*
*Department of Pathology, Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital,
The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University,
Jinan, Shandong, China
Background & objectives: Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells enable im-
portant form of immunotherapy, technology that requires a small amount
of blood sample and high sensitivity is in urgent need to detect and
characterize circulating rare antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.
Methods: Here, by uniquely integrating several coherent strategies including
covalent chemistry mediated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells capture/release,
peptide MHCI-pentamer, nanostructured substrates, and a PDMS chaotic
mixer, a Nanovilli-pMHCI-Pentamer capturing system is developed to cap-
ture circulating rare HPV16-E711-20-specific CD8+T cells, followed by di-
sulfide cleavage-driven release, and then to further analyse the response of
HPV16-E711-20-specific CD8+T cells to HPV16-E711-20 antigen.
Results: We have successfully developed and validated a novel antigen-
specific CD8+ T cells purification system, i.e., CTL-NanoChip, which
could achieve a purity above 86.55% even when the target cells made up
less than 0.01% (10/106) of the total cells. These data promise the CTL-
NanoChip’s ability to rapidly and effectively isolate rare antigen-specific
CD8+ T cells. By coupling CTL-NanoChip with a downstream
Virchows Arch
functional assay to quantify CD8 activated-related mRNA transcripts and
to detect the killing ability and IFN-γsecretion ability of antigen-specific
CD8+ T cells, these data demonstrate the CTL-NanoChip’s ability to
maintain the well-preserved integrity and biological activity of recovered
antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.
Conclusion: This nano-system, denoted CTL-NanoChip, could utilize
streptavidin-modified nanovilli chip and biotin-modified peptide-MHC-
pentamer complex to dynamically monitor the count and function of
circulating rare antigen-specific T cells using a small amount of peripheral
blood samples, which provided a feasible method to facilitate T cell-based
immunotherapy through predicting the response to checkpoint inhibitors
and monitoring the efficacy of CART-cell therapy or adoptive cellular
therapy.

Mixt plexiform and desmoplastic ameloblastoma
E. Taştekin, İ. Usta, E. Mercan Demirtaş*, U. Usta
*Department of Pathology, Trakya University, School of Medicine,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Ameloblastoma is a benign but aggressive/
destructive epithelial odontogenic tumour, with the capacity to attain
great size, invade bone and adjacent structures. Plexiform and
desmoplastic types (especially mixed forms) are rare odontogenic lesions,
with radiographic and pathologic features of jaw cysts.
Methods: A 29-year-old male patient admitted to the dentist with pain-
less swelling on manbular region. Clinical examination revealed a mass in
left side of mandibula near the 2. Molar tooth. Panoramic radiograph
disclosed a well corticated radiolucent lesion 2x1,5 cm in diameter and
excisional biopsy was performed.
Results: We received haemorrhagic white soft tissue fragments.
Microscopically mixture of dense collagenous stroma with compressed,
angular islands of odontogenic epithelium (desmoplastic area) and
anastomosing odontogenic epithelial cells in fibrous tissue (plexi-
form areas) were seen. Odontogenic epithelial islands composed of
peripheral palisading columnar cells were at basal layer,
hyperchromatic cells were shown reverse polarization away from
basement membrane. Infiltrating islands of atypical basaloid cells
with peripheral palisading and separation artifact of peritumoral stro-
ma were evident. Necrosis, mitotically activity and haemorrhage are
not seen. Ki67 proliferation index was 1%. On immunohistochemis-
try, tumour was positive for CK5, CK19, P63 and CD56 (preferen-
tially expressed in the stellate reticulum-like cells).
Conclusion: Every radiolucency of the jaw should be closely distinguished
from mimickers with pathological examination since ameloblastoma shares
significant clinical and radiographic similarities with odontogenic cysts and
malignant tumours. Incisional biopsy and aspirational cytology may not be
able to reflect the true nature of the lesion.

A not-so incidental case of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma
D. O' Connor*, S. Boyle, O. Young, A.M. Quinn, R. Shatwan
*University Hospital Galway, Ireland
Background & objectives: Papillary thyroid microcarcinomas are typi-
cally indolent neoplasms. Approximately one third of adults have papil-
lary thyroid microcarcinomas, most of which never progress to metastatic
cancer. We report an extremely rare case of papillary thyroid
microcarcinoma metastasis presenting as a neck mass.
Methods: An 83-year-old male presented with a left level II neck mass.
CT neck and thorax identified an avidly enhancing soft tissue mass at the
common carotid bifurcation. Cerebrovascular duplex scan confirmed a
non-vascular entity, separate from the common carotid artery, which was
positive for thyroid cells on fine-needle-aspiration. The patient underwent
a total thyroidectomy and selective lymph node dissection.
Results: Dissection of the left neck mass revealed a 42mm, well-
circumscribed cystic entity with calcification. Histologically, this mass
was identified as metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma, entirely replac-
ing a lymph node.
Curiously, the only abnormalities within the thyroid were two foci of
papillary thyroid microcarcinoma, located within the right and left thyroid
lobes, measuring 2mm and 1.5mm respectively.
Ectopic thyroid tissue was outruled as the primary source of malignancy
and there were no larger foci of papillary thyroid carcinoma elsewhere in
the thyroid.
Following multidisciplinary discussion, the presence of multifocal papil-
lary thyroid microcarcinoma was identified as the most likely origin for
this metastatic deposit, with a final stage of pT1a (m) N1b.
Conclusion: The vast majority of papillary thyroid microcarcinomas are not
aggressive, demonstrate an indolent behaviour and have an excellent progno-
sis. However, very rare cases of distant metastasis (0.7%) can occur. Male
patients with bilateral, multifocal lesions are reportedly more likely to develop
lymph node metastasis from papillary thyroid microcarcinomas.
This unusual case represents a very rare and challenging example of metasta-
tic papillary thyroid microcarcinoma, which presented as a large left neck
mass, and highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach.

Expression of Claudin-1 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas
(LSCCs) and its significance
A. Ouban*
*Alfaisal University College of Medicine, Saudi Arabia
Background & objectives: A large body of scientific evidence points to
the important roles of tight junction proteins in tumour development in
many body sites. The author sheds some light on the expression and
possible role of claudin-1 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas.
Methods: This study analysed the expression of claudin-1, using immu-
nohistochemistry, in a tissue microarray of 80 cases of laryngeal cancers.
Clinicopathological parameters were analysed according to claudin-1 ex-
pression in the microarray. Furthermore, the expression of slug/snail1, an
Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) linked protein, was analysed
by immunohistochemistry in the same microarray, and the expressions of
the two proteins were assessed for correlation.
Results: A significant majority of laryngeal squamous cell cancers ex-
hibited positive expression of claudin-1 proteins. The majority of those
tumours expressed claudin-1 in their cytoplasm. The overall majority of
those same tumours also exhibited a cytoplasmic shift of the slug-snail-1
protein from the nuclei to the cytoplasm. There was also evidence of
correlation of the two proteins' expressions in the cytoplasm of laryngeal
tumours.
Conclusion: The above may suggest a role for claudin-1 in the develop-
ment and progression of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Overall,
claudin-1's aberrant expression in laryngeal cancer is in line with evidence
seen in other head and neck cancers. Its co-expression with slug/snail-1 in
LSCC patients should be investigated further to understand the nature of
the relationship of the two proteins in LSCC and their possible contribu-
tion to its development and progression.

*Department of Pathology, Ankara University School of Medicine,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Tenosynovial giant cell tumours(TGCTs) are
benign lesions affecting tendon spaces, sheats, bursae of synovia in pa-
tients between ages 30-40. Mostly occurs in large weight-bearing joints.
Virchows Arch
TGCT of temporomandibular joint(TMJ) is very rare, present with
preauricular swelling, trismus, clicking of TMJ.
Methods: 68-year-old male presented with the left painless facial swell-
ing, tinnitus and pain with neck movements for two years. He had no
history of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Imaging showed a 40 x 28 x 27
mm, solid mass in the deep parotid gland which has a cystic component in
the middle and extension into temporomandibular joint, mandibula, ad-
jacent muscle.
Results: On gross examination of the resection specimen was 4.6 × 2.6 ×
1.9 cm, nodular mass. The cut surface showed tan-reddish tissue with
dense haemorrhage. Microscopically, the lesion showing groups of
pigmented histiocytes, dispersed osteoclasts and rare typical mitosis, con-
sists of vesicular nucleus and oval-spindle cells with eosinophilic cyto-
plasm. Focal ossification was present. Immunohistochemical analysis
showed partially positive staining of the lesional cells for CD68, with
negative staining for HMB45, Melan A, Desmin, ALK, EMA, HMW+
LMWCK, S-100 protein, SMA. There is no loss of expression with INI-1.
Ki67 proliferation index was lower than 10%.
Conclusion: TGCT of the temporomandibular joint may present clinical-
ly and radiologically as a primary parotid gland lesion. Giant cell-rich
lesions are uncommon in salivary glands. It is important to keep this
entity in the differential diagnosis of giant cell-rich lesions in the parotid
gland.

Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour, an uncommon diagnosis of
head and neck lesions: two cases reports and review of the literature
Y. Sarra*, S. Chaieb, Z. Nfikha, Y. Fejji, A. Bchir, N. Abdessayed, B.
Sriha, M. Mokni
*FARHAT HACHED HOSPITAL, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Inflammatory myofibrosblastic tumours
(IMT) rarely evolve head and neck, accounting for 14% of all lesions.
Their pathological diagnosis can be challenging with frequent inconclu-
sive biopsies. Objective: to put forward the clinicopathologic features of
two IMT of the head and neck.
Methods: The first case is about a 46-year-old women, presenting with
an expansive submucosal mass of the posterior and lateral nasopharyn-
geal right wall on CT scan. The 2nd case is about a 26-year-old man
presenting with 1 cm polypoid mass involving right true vocal cord.
Results: Histological assessment of nasolaryngeal biopsies and of the
vocal cord mass excision showed similar features. They revealed a deep
submucosal tumour mainly composed of spindle or stellate cells with
mild fasciculated arrangement pattern. There were no cellular atypia nor
mitosis. Stroma was oedematous, with focal hyalinization and prominent
inflammatory component, predominantly composed of lymphocytes,
plasma cells, and eosinophils. The surface was not ulcerated.
Immunohistochemical study made on the vocal cord mass revealed dif-
fuse expression of smooth muscle actin and ALK by spindle cells.
Conclusion: IMT of head and neck are rare. Pathologist must pay atten-
tion to misinterpret inflammation and myofibroblastic cells as inflamma-
tory and reactive change, particularly in submucosal tumour biopsies.

B. Sepodes*, F. Ramalhosa, J. Gama, G. Fontinha, J. Madeira, C. Faria,
V. Almeida, M.B. Pimentão, A. Lai, G. Fernandes
*CHUC, Portugal
Background & objectives: Parotid glands are an unusual site for primary
and metastatic angiosarcomas, representing together with oral cavity and
other salivary glands 2% of all angiosarcomas. Prognosis is not well-
known due to rarity of the cases in literature.
Methods: In the last ten years (2011-2021), at our institution, a total of
three angiosarcomas of parotid gland were studied. Patients were males,
aged between 51 and 80 years old, of which two were metastatic
angiosarcomas from the scalp submitted to radiotherapy. The youngest
patient was diagnosed with primary neoplasia and presented a vocal cord
epidermoid carcinoma previously.
Results: Cell-blocks paraffin-embedded revealed epithelioid neoplastic
cells with marked atypia, eosinophilic cytoplasm with poorly-defined
borders as well as round nucleus with irregular borders. Both, primary
and secondary, demonstrate high mitotic activity. Primary tumour cells
were positive to CD31 and ERG and negativity for CK5.6, CK7, p40,
TTF1, SOX10 and CD10. One of the secondary tumours expressed CD31
and CD34 positivity and MNF116 negativity and the other positivity for
CD31, ERG and WT1.
Conclusion: Primary and secondary angiosarcoma of parotid gland are
rare, usually presenting unresectable and metastatic stage. Therefore, the
diagnosis can be achieved with confidence by cytology which will deter-
mine the outcome.

*CHUC, Portugal
Background & objectives: Undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma is a rare
pathological entity with an aggressive course and invariably fatal with a
median survival of only 6 months, representing less than 5% of all thyroid
cancers.
Methods: A sixty-year-old man presented in our hospital with a sore
unilateral cervical mass, rapidly growing in the previous ten days.
Ultrasound revealed a hypoechogenic and heterogeneous massive nod-
ule. TAC showed carotid and jugular involvement. Tracheostomy was
performed as well as a cellblock of thyroid and cervical adenopathy.
Molecular analysis were run to test BRAF and NRAS mutation.
Results: Fine needle aspiration from thyroid identified dyscohesive and
pleomorphic cells with enlarged nuclei as well as broad cytoplasm and
frequent mitotic figures. The tumour cells were positive for TTF1 and
negative for thyroglobulin, neuroendocrine and calcitonin markers. The
molecular study was positive for NRAS mutation. The cytopathology
interpreted the lesion as an undifferentiated carcinoma of the thyroid
gland, possibly with follicular vs follicular variant of papillary carcinoma.
Conclusion: Molecular pathology is recommended in order to predict the
outcome and consider the appropriate treatment, mainly in metastatic undif-
ferentiatedcarcinomasorinoperablecases.Inthisparticularcase,thispatient
had NRAS mutation, therefore not benefiting from EGFR treatment.

most frequent malignant neoplasms of head and neck region (including
tonsils). A primary tonsillar angiosarcoma is extremely rare.
Methods: We hereby present a 82-year-old male admitted to our hospital
due to massive haemoptysis, necessitating 10 units of packed red blood
cells. During endoscopy, a tumour on the left tonsil was found; emergen-
cy tonsillectomy was performed. A 5.5 x 2.5 x 2.4 cm, 14.2 gram tonsil
contained a 1.3 cm ulcerated, purplish tumour.
Results: Histologically, the tumour consisted of multiple anastomosing
vascular channels lined by atypical endothelial cells with severe nuclear
pleomorphism. Necrotic areas were seen. Neoplastic cells were
Virchows Arch
immunostained for CKAE1/AE3, CK8/18, ERG and CD31. A diagnosis
of epithelioid angiosarcoma was rendered. Further examination with CT
scan and PET CT revealed no other foci.
Conclusion: Due to their morphology and immunopositivity for
cytokeratins, primary epithelioid angiosarcomas of head and neck may
mimic poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas, especially of the
acantholytic subtype; they must, therefore, always be included to our
differential diagnosis.

Tracheal deep benign fibrous histiocytoma: case report and litera-
ture review
M. Tural*, N. Reisli, E.K. Koltuk, G. Kaygusuz
*Ankara University of Medical School, Turkey
Background & objectives: Deep benign fibrous histiocytoma(BFH) is a
benign neoplasm of mesenchymal origin composed of histiocytes and
fibroblasts that arises in subcutaneous or deep soft tissue. Deep BFH’s
uncommon and poorly recognized tumour and form located in trachea is
even more rare.
Methods: A 71-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital with
dyspnoea. The mass was observed in the trachea on CT imaging. In the
bronchoscopy performed, a 1.5 cm diameter thick stalked polypoid lesion
was seen on the anterior wall of the trachea and was excised.
Results: Microscopically, a subepithelial localized tumoral lesion that
ulcerating the surface was observed. The tumour was composed of
spindle-shaped cells arranged in a storiform pattern, with vesicular nucle-
us with inconspicuous nucleoli, eosinophilic cytoplasm and no atypia.
There were 3 typical mitoses/10 HPFs. Pigmented macrophages and mul-
tinucleated histiocytes accompanied the tumour. Immunohistochemically,
SMA was focally positive in tumour cells whereas pan-CK, S100, des-
min, CD34, STAT6, HHV8, EMA, CD68, and P40 were negative. Ki67
proliferation index was 20%. In view of the morphological and immuno-
histochemical findings, a deep benign fibrous histiocytoma was
diagnosed.
Conclusion: BFH is a benign mesenchymal tumour, its presence in deep
organs, especially in the head and neck, is rare. There have been only a
few case reports of BFH of the larynx. Deep BFH usually present as
painless well-circumscribed lesions causing symptoms due to pressure
effects depending on size and site of involvement. It’s difficult to diag-
nose deep BFH due to its histological features resembling other mesen-
chymal tumours. Its diagnosis is challenging and rests on characteristic
histopathological and immunohistochemical features.

A rare metastasis of renal cell carcinoma: gingiva
İ. Usta*, N. Can, M. Bağış, F.G. Çanakçı
*Department of Pathology, Trakya University, School of Medicine,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Metastasis of malignant neoplasms to the
oral cavity is rare and almost exclusively by hematogenous route.
Metastasis to bone, especially jaws, is more frequent than the metastasis
to soft tissue and affects 40-70 years old.
Methods: A 73-years-old male presented with an intraoral soft tissue
tumour. The lesion was excised with pre-diagnosis as peripheral giant
cell granuloma. On histopathological examination, there were epithelial
tumour nests consisting of cells with clear cytoplasm. Immunoexpression
with vimentin, pancytokeratin, CAIX, CD10, EMA and PAX8 were de-
tected. It was reported as renal cell carcinoma metastasis to gingiva.
Results: The gingiva is the most common site for metastasis in the soft
tissue of the oral cavity (more than half of cases) because of it is fine
capillary vessels. The most common primary malignancy in males is
lung, followed by kidney and skin. In women, the most common primary
malignancy is breast.
In our case, soft tissue tumour in the gingiva was in the maxillary anterior
and premolar region, and radiological resorption of the underlying alve-
olar bone was not observed. The patient had left nephrectomy with a
diagnosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma 2 years ago. The patient died
4 months after the diagnosis of gingiva metastasis.
Conclusion: Metastatic intraoral soft tissue masses have clinical manifes-
tations similar to traumatic or reactive hyperplastic lesions. Anamnesis and
radiological imaging methods are important to find the primary malignan-
cy. In microscopic examination, tumour pattern, cell features and immuno-
histochemical methods may guide for primary malignancy. For the diagno-
sis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma metastasis, compact nests and sheets of
cell with distinct membranes and clear cytoplasm are remarkable, and there
may be clues of vascularization, blood lakes and intratumoral haemorrhage.

*Department of Pathology, Trakya University, School of Medicine,
Turkey
Background & objectives: Alveolar echinococcus is a rare parasitic
disease caused by fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis and it is
characterized by an asymptomatic incubation period of many years and
the slow development of a primary tumour-like lesion.
Methods: Here we present a case diagnosed in our pathology department.
70-year-old female patient had epigastric pain and fatigue.
Radiologically, there was mass lesions with heterogenous lobule contours
and cavitation scattered in both lung parenchyma, some in conglomerated
form and the liver and the right surrenal gland had mass lesion and
calcifications. Wedge resection of the lung was performed.
Results: On macroscopic examination of the lung parenchyma, there
were millimetric multilocular cysts. Histopathologically examination re-
vealed thin walled multiloculated cystic structures in the lung parenchy-
ma. There were areas with necrosis in the inner parts of these cystic
structures and sharp-edged, birefringent structures, which are likely to
be microbiological factors, were seen. Lung parenchyma contained in-
flammatory cells, fibrotic and anthracotic areas. There was histochemi-
cally staining with gomori-methenamine-silver and periodic-acid-schiff
in the cystic laminated layers.
Conclusion: Alveolar echinococcus is a rare tumour-like parasitic dis-
ease. Humans are accidental intermediate hosts that are infected with
contaminated food. It is relatively common in pandemic areas in the liver
and lung. Serologic tests and histopathological examinations can produce
a diagnosis.

When schistosoma meets an ovarian fibroma - a case report
C. Dahlstedt-Ferreira*, S. Carralas Antunes, T. Robalo Nunes, M.J.
Aleixo, D. Brito, H. Oliveira Coelho
*Hospital Garcia de Orta, EPE, Portugal
Background & objectives: Urogenital schistosomiasis may have different
presentations, particularly in women. It is considered to be a risk factor for
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Lower genital lesions may
be easily accessed, although, in the Upper genital tract (UGT), may not.
Methods: We present a case of an Angolan 29-year-old woman, without
relevant medical background, who was referred to our hospital due to a
pelvic tumefaction. A petreal pelvic mass was palpated at physical exam.
The ultrasonography and CT-scan described a right ovarian tumour and
right oophorectomy was proposed, and performed.
Virchows Arch
Results: On gross dissection, the ovary weighted 1605g and measured
20x16.5x7cm, with smooth external surface. Section surface was solid,
white and fasciculate. Histology showed a monotonous fusocellular pro-
liferation, without necrosis or cellular atypia, strongly immunoreactive
for WT1 and weakly positive for ER, calretinin and actin and negative
for inhibin and desmin. The final diagnosis was of ovarian fibroma – a
benign tumour. Incidentally, in one section, chronic inflammatory gran-
ulomatous reactions with eosinophils and foreign body multinucleated
giant cells were found, surrounding structures that were compatible with
Schistosoma eggs.
Conclusion: Schistosomiasis remains the second most frequent parasitic
infection worldwide, affecting especially many African regions. It is a
chronic infection that can have a large impact on female health status,
since it can manifest as menstruation disorders, dyspareunia, infertility,
pregnancy complications and be considered a risk factor for HIV infec-
tion. Schistosomiasis in the UGT is a rare disorder which may have an
important influence in women’s health and is poorly understood, hence
the importance raising awareness to it.

Alexiadi, T. Alexiadis, T. Chatzineophytou, G. Alexiadis, A.
Zissimopoulos, P. Pavlidis
*Histology-Embryology Lab., Medical Department, Democritus
University of Thrace, Greece
Background & objectives: We describe a rare case of echinococcus in a
64-year-old woman localized in the spleen. Echinococcus granulosus is
quite common in Greece but rarely localized in the spleen.
Methods: Clinical examination and laboratory tests including ultrasound
and computed tomography were performed. The patient underwent sple-
nectomy, and the recessed organ underwent pathological examination.
Results: The patient presented with fever and with a feeling of fullness in
the right abdomen. Clinical examination as well as ultrasound and CT scans
revealed a cyst in the spleen of the patient which then underwent splenec-
tomy. The pathology lab received a 470 gram spleen of 15X10X7.5 cm.
After dissection an 8 cm cyst was found containing membranes and small
cystic formations containing clear liquid. Moreover, classifications were
observed in the walls of the cyst. The diagnosis was echinococcus cyst
with multiple daughter cysts and scolices.
Conclusion: Greece ranks 1st in Europe and 2nd worldwide in echino-
coccus cases. The non-specific sub-clinical presentation makes the timely
diagnosis and treatment of the disease almost impossible. Complications
following rapture of the echinococcus cyst are severe and require imme-
diate medical assistance. Localization in the spleen although rare can
cause severe problems if not diagnosed and treated in early stages.

Unusual presentation of pseudotumoral epidural schistosomiasis: a
case report
A. Lima*, M.P.S. S. Cunha, C.G. Hirth, W.S. Maia, G.F.T. Alcântara,
P.P.A. Coimbra, M.E. Porto, I.S. Guedes, A. C. Andrade
*School of Medicine, University of Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil
Background & objectives: Schistosomiasis is a highly frequent disease
in less developed countries. The nervous system is the second most af-
fected site, responsible for 20-30% of the cases. Commonly seen in
myeloradicular location, the diagnosis is often presumptive, with rare
epidural presentation.
Methods: A 26-year-old male, paraplegic patient, native of Cape Verde,
looked for medical assistance in Fortaleza, Brazil. The magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) showed a 4.4 cm cystic lesion in the spinal posterior
epidural space, at T8-T10 level, suspicious for neoplasm. Laminotomy
and excision were performed. The histopathology report showed a
granulomatous lesion with structures compatible with Schistosoma
mansoni (SM) eggs.
Results: When outside the portal venous system, the SM manifestations
are considered "ectopic" and can occur at any stage of the disease. The
gap between the infection and the onset of symptoms can take days or
years, what makes it important to ask about previous contact with water
reservoirs, reported in most of the diagnosed cases, and confirmed by our
patient during his childhood in Africa. Even when the clinical suspicion is
neoplasia, the pathologist must be aware of parasitic lesions that can
mimic other conditions.
Conclusion: The anatomopathological report revealed a granulomatous
chronic inflammatory process with ovoid structures compatible with S.
mansoni eggs. Although the diagnosis is often presumptive, the difficulty
of recognizing the disease and operational issues have been described by
health professionals as causal factors of the low frequency of diagnosis.
The authors emphasize the importance of being aware of the parasitic
nature of resected lesions, even in the absence of clinical suspicion.

Coronavirus: features of morphology
B. Magrupov*, V. Ubaydullaeva, T. Vervekina
*Center for the development of professional skills of medical staff,
Republican Research Center of Emergency Medicine, Uzbekistan
Background & objectives: Humanity has been familiar with the coro-
navirus, 3 out of 7 coronaviruses can cause severe damage to the lung
tissue. In humans, the disease ranges from asymptomatic carriage to the
development of severe forms of ARDS and pneumonia.
Methods: Analysed the results of 30 autopsies: 8 women and 22 men.
The average age of women is 71.1 ± 7.8. The average age of men is 68.0 ±
11.4. The incubation period was estimated at 2-14, with an average of 3-
5.2 days. The hospital stay was 12.5 ± 8.5 days, while 45.8% died in the
first 7 days of hospitalization.
Results: At autopsy, lung damage was varied - from a bilateral patholog-
ical process to a lobar, segmental or focal lesion. Microscopic examina-
tion revealed changes in the interstitial tissue, diffuse damage to the al-
veoli, the picture of "hyaline" membranes. Exudative changes:
intraalveolar oedema, erythrocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells. With
the addition of bacterial or fungal flora, a combined viral-bacterial or
viral-fungal lesion of the lung tissue developed. Bacteriological exami-
nation revealed pathogenic flora in 87.5%. Staphylococcus aureus was
found in 29.1% (57.1% - Staphylococcus aureus, 28.5% Staphylococcus
Epidermidis, 14.2% Staphylococcus Haemolyticus). In 45.8% of cases
kl.pneumoniae was found, in 8.3% of cases E. coli, in 4.1% - candidiasis
in combination with kl. pneumonia.
Conclusion: Thus, the analysis of autopsy studies showed that the main
percentage of victims of coronavirus infection falls on the older age group
with a premorbid background, aggravated by a number of chronic dis-
eases. When staying in the hospital for more than 7-10 days, the addition
of a bacterial infection was noted.

Visceral leishmaniasis: case report of a rare disease in south-eastern
Brazil
G. Nora*, D.C. Brito de Souza, E. Milharcix Zanovelo, S. Longarini
Gonçalves
*Hospital de Base/FAMERP, Brazil
Background & objectives: To report a case of visceral leishmaniasis, a
rare disease in south-eastern Brazil.
Methods: Review of medical record and anatomopathological report.
The bone marrow specimen was fixed in formalin, decalcified with eth-
ylenediaminetetraacetic acid and subjected to histological processing.
Results: Female, 38 years old, is referred from her city to the
haematology team due to a clinical suspicion of lymphoma. At the initial
Virchows Arch
evaluation, the patient had lymphadenomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly, fever
and jaundice. Laboratory tests showed pancytopenia. The investigation
continued with bone marrow biopsy, which exhibited hypocellularity for
age and the presence of multiple amastigotes phagocytosed by macro-
phages, confirming the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis infection. The
patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin B (6 ampoules/day). There
was clinical and laboratory improvement after treatment, the patient was
discharged and started the follow-up with the infectiology team.
Conclusion: Visceral leishmaniasis is a rare disease in south-eastern
Brazil. Brazilian epidemiological data show that 100 cases of the disease
were reported in the state of São Paulo in 2019, leading to an incidence of
1 case per 440.000 inhabitants. Bone marrow biopsy, although an inva-
sive procedure, gives precise diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis and may
be considered when indicated.

An uncommon testicular tumour mimic: a case report
M. Pinho*, T. Oliveira, R. Luís
*Department of Pathology, Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN, Portugal
Background & objectives: Infectious processes can clinically mimic
testicular tumours, by taking the form of space-occupying lesions/
pseudotumours which render challenging radiological differential diag-
nosis, namely in the setting of lesions ineligible for biopsy. Herein, we
present an instance of unsuspected active tuberculous orchiepididymitis.
Methods: A 75-year-old male, with previously diagnosed non-muscle
invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) managed through intravesical
Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) instillation, presented with recurrent
testicular pain. The ultrasound showed bilateral hydrocele and a hetero-
geneous hypervascular 2.4x1.9cm testicular nodule. The patient
underwent antibiotherapy, without symptomatic improvement, and hence
bilateral hydrocelectomy was performed. Due to sustained clinical suspi-
cion of neoplasm, the testicle was later excised.
Results: A 4x2.2x1.9cm orchidectomy specimen was received. Gross sec-
tioning revealed a 1.9x1.9x1.6cm nodule in the lower pole, with caseous-
like central necrosis and with a yellow-brownish rim. Histologically, an
inflammatory process involved both the epididymis and the testicular pa-
renchyma, displaying confluent epithelioid granulomas with extensive ne-
crosis, rare multinucleated giant cells and Schaumann bodies. Acid fast
bacilli were highlighted by Ziehl-Neelsen stain in the necrotic debris. No
neoplastic tissue or additional microorganisms were identified. Taking the
clinical background of BCG therapy into account, the findings of active
tuberculosis were regarded as BCGitis.
Conclusion: NMIBC patients treated with BCG may suffer iatrogenic
genitourinary or even systemic infection, which may force therapy termi-
nation. Tuberculous orchiepididymitis has been scarcely described, oc-
curring as late as 56 weeks after the last instillation. Mycobacterial traces
may be detected in about half of the cases, highlighting the feasibility of a
diagnosis through less invasive procedures; however, a negative micro-
biological study does not exclude the possibility of a BCG infection. The
patient has since undergone anti-tuberculous therapy and remains clini-
cally stable.

Solitary coin lesions of the lung: a case report of pulmonary
dirofilariasis
J. Santos*, A.R. Costa, P. Calvinho, E. Pinto, M. Oliveira
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Centro Hospitalar Universitário de
Lisboa Central, EPE, Lisbon, Portugal
Background & objectives: Solitary coin lesions of the lung have a broad
differential diagnosis including benign disease processes and malignan-
cies. The purpose of this case is to present a rare pathology in our country
and a literature review.
Methods: We report the case of a 38-year-old immunocompetent man who
presentedtohisfamilydoctorwithwristjointpain;bilateralpalmar,leftfoot,
lowerlipandglutealoedema;epigastricpainanddiarrhoea.Hewasaformer
smoker who had quit 4 years ago. On physical examination, the patient had
sting injuries of insect or flea and an antihistamine was prescribed.
Results: Two days later he presented to the emergency department with
angioedema of the right hemiface. He had no respiratory or gastrointestinal
complaints neither fever or other constitutional symptoms. Laboratory stud-
ies showed eosinophilia (12.5%). Computed tomography of the chest re-
vealed a well-defined 4 cm nodule located on the middle lobe. A VATS
wedge resection of the lesion was performed. On microscopic examination
a well-circumscribed necrotic nodule was identified, containing Charcot-
LeydencrystalsandremnantsofDirofilariasp.,surroundedbyagranuloma-
tous inflammatory process in the periphery, with no evidence of neoplastic
cells.
Conclusion: Pulmonary dirofilariasis is a rare condition most often
caused by Dirofilaria immitis, a zoonotic nematode transmitted to humans
by mosquitos. Filarial larvae enter the subcutaneous tissue, travel to the
pulmonary vasculature and lodge in small arteries, producing infarcts.
These are visible on chest radiographs as 'coin lesions'. Although these
lesions are usually identified by chance in asymptomatic patients, they are
often assumed to be malignant. It is therefore crucial to include
dirofilariasis in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary coin lesions.

Y. Sarra*, N. Abdessayed, Y. Fejji, W. Yahya, Z. Nfikha, A. Bchir, S.
Mrabet, M. Mokni
*FARHAT HACHED HOSPITAL, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Strongyloidiasis is one of the most common
digestive parositosis in the world with more than 70 million people
infested, that is barely known in non-endemic regions. Objective: to show
the clinical and pathological aspects of gastrointestinal anguillulosis.
Methods: We report a case of gastrointestinal strangylodosis diagnosed
on gastric and duodenal biopsies.
Results: The patient is a 68-year-old man presenting with chronic diar-
rhoea, vomiting and fatigue. The performed explorations revealed
hypereosinophiilia, with negative parasitological stool examination. The
gastroduodenal endoscopy was held revealing erosive gastritis and
duodenitis lesions with whitish stipplings in the duodenum. Multiple biop-
sies were conducted. The duodenal biopsy revealed an eroded mucosa with
subtotal villous atrophy, hyperplastic crypts, a regenerative epithelium and
cryptitis. The chorion contained an active lymphocytic inflammatory infil-
trate, rich in eosinophilic polynuclear cells. The bottom of the crypts were
occupied by PAS positive eggs and eelworm larvae, extending to the antral
and antrofundic regions. Antral and antro-fundic biopsies showed active
chronic pangastritis lesions without HP nor glandular atrophy.
Conclusion: Histological examination of gastroduodenal biopsies may
be the key exam for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal strongyiloidiasis,
particularly in when parasitologic analysis is negative.

Background & objectives: Colorectal carcinomas (CRC) with microsat-
ellite instability (MSI-H) and KRAS, NRAS and BRAF wild-type (wt)
present a high frequency of rearrangements in NTRK gene. Our objective
is to study the status of NTRK and to confirm results with different
molecular methodologies.
Methods: From 2015 to 2017, 18 cases with MSI-H by immunohisto-
chemistry (IHC) and BRAF wt by pyrosequencing are retrieved.
From 2017 to present, 288 MSI and KRAS/NRAS/BRAF studied cases
are recovered.
In our series, 7 MSI-H and KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wt cases are selected, in
5 of them NTRK was performed (IHC, Genefusion Idylla assay and
NGS).
Results: Of the 5 cases, 1 case (20%) was positive and 4 cases (80%) were
negative. Positive NTRK case was confirmed with all methodologies.
One case wasn’t analysed by NGS due to technical difficulties (poor
DNA libraries).
One of the NTRK negative cases showed an FGFR2 rearrangement by
NGS.
NTRK positive case showed cytoplasmatic and membranous staining by
IHC, GeneFusion assay indicated NTRK1 gene positive and NGS con-
firmed NTRK1/TPM3 rearrangement.
Conclusion: In our series, 20% (1/5) of MSI-H KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wt
CRC were NTRK rearranged.
All methodologies were optimal to detect NTRK rearrangements.
Different methodologies provide complementary information about rear-
rangements, being NGS the most specific.
NGS presents technical limitations in a percentage of cases but offers the
most comprehensive multi-gene analysis.

Complete pathological response to crizotinib in a gastric inflamma-
tory myofibroblastic tumour carrying TFG-ROS1 fusion
P. García Abellás*, A. Ferrer Gómez, E. Moreno Moreno, M.d.C. Ariño
Palao, A. Benito Berlinches, M.E. Reguero Callejas, J. Palacios
*Ramón y Cajal Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: Almost 60% of inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumours (IMT) carry ALK gene rearrangement.
Recently, other gene fusions have been reported. Our aim is to describe
the histologic changes seen in a gastric IMT carrying a TFG-ROS1 fusion
with complete response to crizotinib.
Methods: We present a rare case of a gastric unresectable IMT with TFG-
ROS1 fusion on a 32-year-old man with no medical history. Next-
generation sequencing (NGS) OncomineTM Focus Assay
(ThermoFisher Scientific) was initially performed to confirm the diagno-
sis. Morphological and immunohistochemical features of the resection
specimen after neoadyuvant therapy with ROS1/ALK/MET tirosin ki-
nase inhibitor crizotinib are described.
Results: The diagnosis of IMT was established after endoscopic
ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). NGS
OncomineTM Focus Assay revealed a TFG-ROS1 fusion involving exons
1–4 of TFG and exons 35–43 of ROS1. The patient received crizotinib
during one year before surgery. Examination of the resection specimen
demonstrated a 7 cm mass involving the gastroesophageal union and the
stomach. Pathologic examination showed a stromal sclerohyaline change
composed predominantly of thick haphazardly arranged collagen fibres
with cracks intermixed with slightly atypical spindle cells with fibroblastic
appearance. Immunohistochemically, atypical spindle cells showed nega-
tive staining for SMA, desmin and ROS1. Focal areas of neo-ossyfication,
lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, reactive lymphoid aggregates and dys-
trophic calcifications were also identified.
Conclusion: Currently, reports describing complete pathological re-
sponse to crizotinib in patients with IMT are quite limited. To the best
of our knowledge this is the first case that details the histologic changes
after tirosin kinase inhibitor crizotinib and also supports cytological
samples as a valid source of high-quality DNA for next generation se-
quencing (NGS) analysis.

A possible off-target resistance mutation in a metastatic thyroid car-
cinosarcoma harbouring a NTRK3 gene fusion
A. Leuca*, C. Van Campenhout, I. Salmon, T. Prigogine, M. Remmelink,
N. D'Haene
*Erasme University Hospital, Brussels, Belgium
Background & objectives: Neurotrophic-tropomyosin receptor kinase
(NTRK) genes are implicated in the neuronal cell physiology. NTRK
genetic alterations promote oncogenesis in various types of tumours.
Although rare, NTRK gene fusions demonstrate specific druggability.
Resistance mutations have been described but are still largely unknown.
Methods: A 80 y.o. female with a forty-year past medical history of right
hemithyroidectomy presented with shortness of breath. Multiple hyper-
metabolic pleural nodules associating pleuresia were found. A biopsy
revealed a pleural metastasis of a thyroid carcinosarcoma, associating a
double component: epithelioid (papillary architecture, positive for AE1/
AE3, TTF-1, PAX8 and Thyroglobulin antibodies) and sarcomatoid
(spindle-cell architecture, positive for Vimentin only).
Results: A ETV6-NTRK3 fusion transcript was detected by Next
Generation Sequencing (NGS) using a RNA Oncomine Focus Assay
panel. Treatment with Larotrectinib was started, with a spectacular, but
partial response. However, after 6 months, the patient developed
paraparesis. The spinal MRI showed multiple lytic bone infiltrates, invad-
ing the spinal canal and compressing the spinal cord. Surgical decom-
pression was performed, as well as biopsies, which revealed a bone me-
tastasis of the previous tumour, comprising only the sarcomatoid compo-
nent. Molecular analysis confirmed the previous fusion, as well as a
p.R88Q mutation of the PIK3CA gene, which was not detected previous-
ly. The patient succumbed before any other new treatment was given.
Conclusion: Although rare, NTRK gene alterations characterize onco-
genic pathways in different types of tumours. Tumours harbouring
NTRK gene fusions can be successfully treated with TRK inhibitors.
On the other hand, resistance mutations may appear, leading to changes
in treatment strategy. In the current case report, a NTRK downstream
pathway mutation was demonstrated using NGS techniques. This
PIK3CA gene mutation could be hypothesized as an off-target resistance
mutation. However, tumour heterogeneity cannot be excluded. Further
studies are needed to support our hypothesis.

A comparative study between neoplastic nuclei percentage and allelic
fraction in lung carcinomas analysed by NGS
B. Pena*, R. Pinto, L. Cirnes, S. Canberk, D.F. Schmitt
*Hospital de Santa Maria - CHULN, EPE, Portugal
Background & objectives: Accurate definition of malignant cell fraction
is pivotal to determine the quantity of tumour DNA/RNA acceptable for
molecular testing. Our aim was to verify the correlation between neoplas-
tic nuclei percentage(NNP) and allelic fraction(AF) detected by NGS in a
series of lung cancer.
Methods: We revised the data resulting from NGS analysis of 349 lung
carcinomas, studied in our Institute from January-May2020. We selected
and analysed 320 cases, that presented at least one mutation, aiming to
verify a correlation between morphological assessment of NNP, made by
a pathologist/technician, and the allelic fraction detected. All cases with
lower NNP(5-10%) were reviewed by another pathologist.
Results: The genes more frequently mutated were: KRAS (40%), EGFR
(33%), BRAF (6%), HER2 (5%) and MET (2,5%). In 248 cases (77,5%)
we observed an expected relation between NNP and AF of the mutated
gene by NGS, in other words a relation approximately from 2:1. In 72
Virchows Arch
cases (22,5%) there was no correlation, with a low NNP compared to the
AF. These cases were re-evaluated by another pathologist in order to
exclude an inter-observer disagreement in the estimation of NNP.
Nevertheless, the absence of correlation was confirmed.
Conclusion: In most of the cases(77,5%) there was a good agreement
between the estimation of NNP and the AF. However, in 22,5%cases
there was possible underestimation of the NNP, which has been demon-
strated in other studies. Tumour heterogeneity, differences between the
real number of neoplastic nuclei observed and those dissected for NGS,
due to different section levels of cutting and a rare possibility for a double/

Renal malakoplakia: an unexpected diagnosis
J. Boavida*, R. Moiteiro da Cruz, L. Correia
*Department of Pathology, Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN, Portugal
Background & objectives: Malakoplakia is an uncommon granuloma-
tous infectious process resulting from partially digested phagocytosed
bacteria, most frequently observed in the urinary tract as a recurrent in-
fection complication. We report a case of renal malakoplakia in a patient
with history of renal transplantation.
Methods: A 61-year-old female, submitted to renal transplantation in
February 2019 due to advanced renal chronic disease, developed severe
urosepsis Escherichia coli-related and concomitant graft dysfunction in
November 2019. Renal biopsy was hence performed to assess signs of
rejection, using ancillary studies of the department’s protocol and also
Gram, von Kossa and Prussian blue stains.
Results: Two core biopsies of 7 and 12 mm were received, comprising a
total of 16 glomeruli. There were no signs of rejection. Noteworthy, in 60% of
the sample, there was architectural effacement and it was possible to identify
numerous interstitial histiocytic foamy cells (confirmed with immunohisto-
chemical staining for CD68) with several basophilic cytoplasmatic inclusions,
evidentiated by von Kossa and Prussian blue stains, consistent with
Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. Given these morphologic findings and histo-
chemical results, a diagnosis of malakoplakia was made.
Conclusion: Malakoplakia may occur in many organs, namely in the
urinary tract and especially in the bladder where E. coli is the most frequent
infectious agent. Our case highlights how the detection of malakoplakia
emphasized that the infectious process had extended proximally throughout
the whole urinary tract and was the culprit of the clinical renal dysfunction,
offering an immediately manageable condition. However, despite immu-
nosuppression readjustment and antibiotherapy, the patient briefly
progressed to dialysis.

Lysozyme amyloidosis - challenges of a rare diagnosis
A.R. Coelho*, R. Silva
*Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João, Portugal
Background & objectives: Lysozyme amyloidosis is an extremely rare
and probably under-diagnosed form of hereditary amyloidosis, with
around fifty reported cases. Lysozyme amyloid deposits typically accu-
mulate in the kidney, liver, gastrointestinal tract and spleen. We herein
report a case of this rare entity.
Methods: A 43-year-old female, with a previous history of hypertension
and atrophic gastritis, and no relevant family history, was admitted in our
institution with acute kidney injury, a proteinuria of 0,5g/L and marked
cholestasis. Abdominal ultrasonography showed hepatomegaly.
Considering clinical features and an appropriate autoimmune panel, the
diagnosis of primary biliary cholangitis was proposed. Kidney and liver
biopsies were performed.
Results: Kidney biopsy showed amyloid deposits within the glomeruli,
interstitium and vessel walls. There was also severe interstitial fibrosis
and tubular atrophy. Amyloid typing by immunohistochemistry showed
expression of lysozyme and serum amyloid A (SAA). Immunofluorescence
for light chains (kappa and lambda) was negative. SAA concentration was
in the normal range. On liver biopsy there were no bile duct lesions, and
amyloid deposits (positive for lysozyme and SAA) were found within
vessel walls. On follow-up kidney function progressively deteriorated to
pre-dialysis stage. Cardiac involvement was suspected due to concentric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Mass spectrometry of amyloid deposits and genet-
ic study of lysozyme gene is ongoing.
Conclusion: The variable penetrance of hereditary forms of amyloidosis
often results in absence of a positive family history which, allied to signif-
icant overlap of symptoms between these and other forms of primary am-
yloidosis, makes correct diagnosis a challenge. Heterogeneity of amyloid
proteins, lack of specific antibodies for different amyloid proteins and high
background staining are some of the difficulties of amyloid typing by
immunohistochemistry. In equivocal cases or when less common/unusual
amyloid types are suspected mass spectrometry could be helpful.

Coexistence of lupus nephritis and thin basement membrane. Case
report
F.J. Diaz Crespo*, F. Almeida Ruiz, A. Acosta Barrios, D. Arroyo, M.
Goicoechea
*Department of Pathology of Gregorio Marañón Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: Kidney biopsy plays an important role for an
accurate lupus nephritis (LN) diagnosis, treatment choice and prognosis
evaluation. Eventually, the biopsy can diagnose coexisting kidney enti-
ties, which may have an impact on prognosis.
Methods: We present the case of a middle-aged woman diagnosed with
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 15 years before. She presented a LN
flare with haematuria, proteinuria, positive anti-DNA, and a decrease in
complement levels, after withdrawal of immunosuppression. Prednisone
and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) were restarted, and a kidney biopsy
was performed.
Results: The light microscopy study showed glomeruli with mildly in-
creased mesangial matrix and cellularity. There were also focal
endocapillary hypercellularity, without extracapillary proliferation.
Immunofluorescence showed intense positivity in mesangial area and
capillary loops of IgM, C3 and C1q. These findings were compatible with
class III LN according to the International Society of Nephrology/Renal
Pathology Society Classification for Lupus Nephritis (2018), with an
activity score of 5/24 and a chronicity score of 1/12. The electron micros-
copy shows subendothelial structured electron dense deposits with
fingerprint-like morphology and a diminished thickness of glomerular
basement membrane (214 nm). The findings were consistent with class
III LN with thin glomerular basement membrane (TGBM).
Conclusion: Thin glomerular basement membrane is a common ultra-
structural finding in patients with other glomerulopathies, including lupus
nephritis. Electron microscopy is a key technique for a complete evalua-
tion of renal histology. There is missing information about the relevance
of this finding on the clinical evolution of other glomerular diseases and
the nature of the association.

Background & objectives: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody
(ANCA) associated vasculitis is a rare but severe condition in childhood.
Clinical presentation and pathology is often heterogeneous and treatment
is not well defined for this population.
Methods: We describe two cases of ANCA vasculitis in children with
renal involvement, who had a kidney biopsy for diagnosis.
Cases description: First case is a 2-year-old boy with end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) because of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. He
was diagnosed when he was 3 months old during a hospital admission
because of a suspected Urinary tract infection.
Results: He started with oliguria, haematuria, proteinuria, elevated serum
creatinine and refractory hypertension with positive A-ANCA, requiring
continuous hemodiafiltration. The kidney biopsy showed an extensive
global glomeruloesclerosis and few viable glomeruli with pauci-
immune extracapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis, with fibrocellular
and fibrous crescents (sclerotic class). Despite treatment with steroids and
rituximab he is on peritoneal dialysis and is awaiting a kidney transplant.
Last case is a previously healthy 5-year-old patient who presented
with nephritic syndrome of torpid evolution and low C3 levels. Renal
function worsened progressively, and he needed extrarenal
depuration techniques. P-ANCA was positive and kidney biopsy
showed diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis, with crescents` forma-
tion in above 70% of glomeruli.
Conclusion: The direct immunofluorescence showed C3 positive stain-
ing(2+) in mesangium and glomerular capillary wall. Genetic test for
complement disorders was negative. He received two doses of rituximab,
ten plasmapheresis sessions and intravenous and oral corticoids with
clinical improvement. Five months after treatment, he has normal GFR.
Conclusion: kidney biopsy is important for renal vasculitis diagnosis in
children, were there is a broad differential diagnosis. The Treatment of
paediatric ANCA-vasculitis is based on adult guidelines. More studies are
needed to establish therapy.

IgA nephropathy in patient with X-linked Alport syndrome – a case
report
M. Horaček*, P. Pavić, P. Šenjug, T. Nikuševa Martić, B. Maksimović,
B. Šimunov, D. Galešić Ljubanović
*Institute of Pathology, University of Zagreb School of Medicine,
Zagreb, Croatia
Background & objectives: X-linked Alport syndrome (AS) is caused by
COL4A5 mutation and presents as a progressive nephritis with
haematuria, sensorineural hearing loss, ocular abnormalities, and early
progression to end-stage renal disease. We present a 23-year-old male
with X-linked AS and IgA nephropathy.
Methods: At the age of 3 the patient presented with haematuria and
proteinuria, underwent kidney biopsy and was diagnosed with AS. At
the age of 21, diagnosis was confirmed by genetic testing. A pathogenic
splice-site variant COL4A5 c.991-1G>C was found. During a 20-year
follow-up, patient presented with haematuria, average 24-hour protein-
uria of 1.5 g, keratoconus, hearing loss and preserved renal function.
Results: At the recent follow-up (patient’s age 23) 24-hour proteinuria
was 8.9 g. The second kidney biopsy was performed. Light microscopy
showed perihilar focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, diffuse mesangial
and focal endocapillary hypercellularity, and necrosis in one glomerulus.
Minimal interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy was noted.
Immunofluorescent microscopy showed global granular positivity (+)
for IgA, IgM and C3, and weak positivity for kappa and lambda light
chains. Electron microscopy showed classic AS morphology combined
with numerous mesangial and some subendothelial, intramembranous
and subepithelial deposits. A diagnosis of Alport syndrome with IgA
nephropathy was made. Oxford score was M1, E1, S1, T0, C1.
Conclusion: Genetic testing has increasingly been applied to confirm
diagnose of AS. However, kidney biopsy is still the only method that
gives a precise insight into the condition of the kidney tissue and can
detect other diseases which can be overlooked with genetic testing only.

Multiorgan transplantation from a deceased donor with intravascu-
lar large B-cell lymphoma: a case report
F. Ramalhosa*, A.C. Lai, M.B. Pimentão, M.J. Martins, R. Oliveira
Caetano, L. Rodrigues, V. Sousa
*Pathology Department, Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Centro
Hospitalar e Universitário Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma
(IVLBCL) is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (<1%), charac-
terized by atypical lymphocytes accumulated within small blood vessels.
IVLBCL has an uncommon clinical presentation and poor prognosis
frequently diagnosed post-mortem. Renal involvement is rarely
described.
Methods: This report presents the transplantation of two kidneys and the
liver from a deceased donor with a Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA).
Routine preimplantation biopsies are performed in all kidney transplant
recipients at our centre for assessing basal donor derived histological
lesions. An IVLBCL lymphoma was diagnosed in the preimplantation
biopsy at day +0 in one of the kidney graft.
Results: After a multidisciplinary discussion, we opted to remove the
renal allografts from the two recipients, which confirmed the presence
of the IVLBCL in both kidneys. A histological examination showed
infiltration of the renal parenchyma by abnormally large lymphoid cells
with prominent nucleoli, consistent with lymphoma. These cells prolifer-
ated in the lumina of glomerular, peritubular, and interstitial capillaries.
Immunophenotyping showed the expression of LCA, CD20, CD79, and
MUM1, whole CD10 and CD30 were negative. The Ki67 index was 95-
100%, reflecting a high proliferative activity.
Conclusion: Kidney biopsy remains a valuable tool in assessing the
quality of the organ donor. For instance, it is the only procedure capable
to detect the presence of malignant lymphoproliferative diseases of non-
forming solid masses non-detected by imaging study. Our case highlights
the value of performing harvest biopsies as a tool to exclude rare donor-
derived tumours.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, a case report of an
uncommon entity

Iglesias Martínez, M.M. Buda, M.B. Catón Santarén
*Clinical Department Unit of Pathological Anatomy, OSI Araba, Araba
University Hospital; Bioaraba Health Research Institute, Vitoria-Gasteiz,
Alava, Spain
Background & objectives: Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-
GBM) disease is a rare small vessel vasculitis that can affect both the
glomerular and pulmonary capillaries. We aim to describe the case of a
40-year-old woman who presented acute renal failure due to anti-GBM
antibody-positive vasculitis.
Methods: Study of glomerular disease revealed elevated titers of anti-
GBM antibodies. The patient was started on haemodialysis and treated
with methylprednisolone pulse therapy, followed by oral prednisone
and cyclophosphamide pulse. A renal biopsy was requested. Light mi-
croscopy with histochemical stains and direct immunofluorescence
were realized.
Results: Renal biopsy showed 21 glomeruli, one of which was sclerosed.
The remaining were severely affected. They exhibited extensive disrup-
tion of Bowman’s capsule, lysis of the glomerular tuft, and cellular cres-
cents formation, most of them associated with segmental fibrinoid necro-
sis and neutrophilic infiltrate with karyorrhexis. Tubulointerstitial com-
ponent revealed varying degrees of interstitial oedema, interstitial
Virchows Arch
leukocyte infiltration, tubulitis, and tubular epithelial simplification most
pronounced adjacent to inflamed glomeruli. Direct immunofluorescence
study showed exclusively linear deposits of IgG along the glomerular
capillary basement membrane.
Conclusion: Anti-GBM usually presents as rapidly progressive glomer-
ulonephritis (RPGN), with or without pulmonary haemorrhage. Crescent
formation is the histopathologic hallmark of the anti-GBM disease. The
proportion of crescents observed in the biopsy sample correlates strongly
with the degree of renal impairment at presentation. Since it can lead to
rapid deterioration in kidney function, prompt diagnosis and treatment are
very important to improve outcomes.

Membranous nephropathy after hematopoietic stem cell transplan-
tation: renal manifestation of graft versus host disease (GVHD)?
G. Silvestre Egea*, M. de Valdenebro Recio, M.R. Sánchez Yuste, P. Gil
Bernabe, M.L. Serrano Salazar, M.d.C. Colomés Iess, C. Corbacho
Cuevas, J. Martín López, J.L. Rodríguez Carrillo
*Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Spain
Background & objectives: Nephrotic syndrome (NS) after allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a rare phenomenon,
generally associated with acute or chronic GVHD. Most cases correspond
to membranous nephropathy or minimal change disease that appear after
changes in immunosuppression treatment.
Methods: We describe a clinical case of membranous nephropathy after
HSCT diagnosed by renal biopsy from which we will review the clinical-
pathological characteristics and the main series published in the literature
covering this topic.
Results: A 66-year-old woman with chronic myeloid leukaemia treated
with HSCT who 24 months later, initiated NS with normal immunolog-
ical analysis and proteinogram. A renal biopsy revealed thickening of the
glomerular basement membrane and spike type projections with rigid
capillary lumens. The tubulo-interstitial component showed mild toxicity
due to calcineurin inhibitors with minimal inflammatory infiltrate. By
immunofluorescence, a global and diffuse granular deposit and intense
subepithelial distribution for IgG+C3 was observed, being diagnosed
with membranous nephropathy.
After diagnosis, blood Anti-PLA2R and Anti-thrombospondin were nega-
tive and treatment with steroids at a dose of 1mg/kg/d and tacrolimus was
started, combining diuretics and ACEIs as concomitant antiproteinuric
management.
Conclusion: Glomerular lesions after HSCT with nephrotic syndrome
are usually due to membranous nephropathy or minimal change dis-
ease. Most are associated with concomitant GVHD and have a me-
dian onset of 20.5 months after HSCT, frequently related to changes
in immunosuppression treatment. Clinical suspicion and renal biopsy
allow a specific diagnosis. Regarding treatment, the main case re-
ports document a combination with steroids and immunosuppressive
medications, although in some cases steroid monotherapy may be
sufficient.

*"Victor Babes" National Institute of Pathology, Romania
Background & objectives: Although rare, the pattern of kidney injury in
non-Hodgkin lymphoma is diverse, ranging from glomerular nephropa-
thies, interstitial diseases and intravascular lymphomatous infiltration.
We report a case of large B-cell lymphoma with acute kidney injury
(AKI) as the sole clinical manifestation.
Methods: A 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes
mellitus was admitted for AKI (serum creatinine was 5.6mg/dL). He had
no proteinuria or haematuria. Lab tests also showed are generative
normocytic anaemia and mild lymphopenia. A whole-body native CT
scan was unremarkable. Bone marrow biopsy showed no signs of a lym-
phoproliferative or neoplastic process.
Percutaneous kidney biopsy (KB) was performed.
Results: Histological examination of KB showed almost complete
replacement of the interstitium with a population of large lym-
phoid-like cells which were arranged in a vague nodular pattern.
The infiltrating cells had a large size with a big nucleus and visible
nucleoli. The glomeruli demonstrated ischemic changes.
Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were unremarkable.
IHC demonstrated infiltrating cells positive for CD20, BCL6, and
MUM1 and negative for CD5 and CD10. Ki67 positivity was es-
timated at 75%. A diagnosis of non-Hodgkin diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma was made.
FDG PET-CT showed a diffusely intense FDG uptake in both
kidneys, liver and testes with a standard uptake value of 5.5.
Conclusion: The patient was started on anthracycline-containing chemo-
therapy associated with rituximab (R-CHOP).
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma infiltrating the kidney is a rare finding.
The present case highlights the importance of renal biopsy in early diag-
nosis and prompt treatment of patients presenting with AKI.

Infection-related glomerulonephritis due to Haemophilus influenzae:
a case report
G. Terinte-Balcan*, A. Cohn, G. Stefan, S. Stancu, A. Zugravu, S. Cinca,
M. Gherghiceanu
*"Victor Babes" National Institute of Pathology, Romania
Background & objectives: Infection-related glomerulonephritis
(IRGN) is an immune complex mediated disease associated with
nonrenal infection by certain bacteria strains, most frequently
Steptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. We report a rare case
of non-IgA IRGN associated to Haemophilus spp.
Methods: A 60-year-old male patient presented with acute nephrit-
ic syndrome (haematuria with dysmorphic red blood cells, 24h
proteinuria 0.6g, serum creatinine 7mg/dL). Two weeks before
admission he suffered an episode of pharyngitis.
Percutaneous kidney biopsy (KB) was performed and the speci-
men was assessed by light, immunofluorescence and electron mi-
croscopy. Identification of Haemophilus spp. was performed ac-
cording to standard microbiology laboratory procedures.
Results: The patient had hypocomplementemia with a low C3 and
a normal C4. Moreover, ASO level, ANA, dsDNA, ANCAp and
ANCAc were negative. Haemophilus influenzae was isolated from
a pharyngeal exudate.
The KB showed 10 glomeruli out of which 4 were globally scarred.
Most of the glomeruli demonstrated endocapillary hypercellularity
with frequent neutrophils in the capillary lumens. Some glomeruli
demonstrated a mesangial hypercellularity. Few tubules had
intraluminal red blood cells casts. Immunofluorescence microscopy
showed bright (3+) granular deposits for C3 and IgG. Electron mi-
croscopy showed small electron dense immune complex type de-
posits located in the subendothelial areas and a few subepithelial
humps. The diagnosis was diffuse proliferative infection-related
glomerulonephritis.
Conclusion: The patient was started on antibiotherapy according to the
antibiogram, and on prednsione 0,5mg/Kgc. At one month from diagno-
sis his serum creatinine decreased to 1.9mg/dL and the C3 was in normal
limits.
There are only few case reports of Haemophilus spp. associated with
IRGN. Usually, the pathological pattern of injury resembles IgA nephrop-
athy. We report a rare case of non-IgA infection-related glomerulonephri-
tis associated to Haemophilus spp.

Secondary gliosarcoma with osteoblastic and chondroblastic differ-
entiation and associated gossypiboma
V. Almeida*, M. Garcia, O. Rebelo
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Centro Hospitalar e Universtário de
Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Gliosarcoma (GS) is a rare biphasic variant
of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM). When diagnosed after a high-
grade glioma, GS is classified as secondary (SGS).
We report an SGS with a predominance of malignant osteoid-chondroid
mesenchymal component, together with a gossypiboma.
Methods: A 59-year-old man had an IDH-wildtype GBM WHO grade
IV partially removed and underwent radiotherapy with concomitant tem-
ozolomide (TMZ) and a further six cycles of maintenance TMZ. Fourteen
months after surgery the patient worsened headaches and RMI confirmed
tumoral progression by showing a partly calcified tumour on the irradiat-
ed area. The lesion was incompletely excised.
Results: Histologically it was a malignant tumour with an astrocytic
component globally identic to the GBM diagnosed before but intermingle
with a significant mesenquimatous component constituted of malignant-
appearing cartilage and bone tissue, resembling chondroblastic osteosar-
coma. GFAP was diffusely positive on the glial component and showed
perivascular positivity on the sarcomatous areas. P53 was positive in both
components. At the lesion's periphery we identified necrosis and basophil
amorphous material, compatible with surgical haemostatic material,
surrounded by macrophages and giant multinucleated cells.
Our diagnosis was of SG with osteoblastic and chondroblastic differenti-
ation and an associated gossypiboma.
The patient needed subsequent admissions for surgical site infection treat-
ment but unfortunately died 52 days after surgery.
Conclusion: Current molecular evidence supports a monoclonal origin of
both glial and sarcomatous components, the latter usually presenting as a
fibrosarcoma-like proliferation. Osteoid and chondroblastic differentia-
tion are exceptionally rare morphologies of this uncommon GBM variant,
with only a few described cases in SGS.
SGS's patients harbour an unfavourable prognosis, and further research is
required to better understand this tumour.
Foreign body reaction to the haemostatic material was an additional finding.

Pure sellar gangliocytoma: a case report
V. Almeida*, O. Rebelo
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Centro Hospitalar e Universtário de
Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Gangliocytomas (GCs) are benign
neuroepithelial tumours accounting for less than 1% of intrasellar lesions.
Most coexist with a pituitary adenoma and patients commonly have en-
docrine manifestations.
We report a case of a GC without an associated adenoma or hormonal elevation.
Methods: A 40-year-old woman with depressive disorder presented sud-
den psychotic behaviour. CT revealed no signs of acute vascular lesions
but showed an expansive lesion on sella turcica, suggestive of a pituitary
macroadenoma. MR confirmed a 2.4 cm lesion with supra and slightly
infrasellar extension. The patient had no endocrine manifestations, and
hormonal levels were normal.
Postoperative MR showed complete tumour resection.
Results: All fragments were included for histopathological examination,
revealing a population of mature ganglion neurons on a neuropil fibrillary
background with scattered and perivascular lymphocytes. On immuno-
histochemistry ganglion neurons expressed synaptophysin,
chromogranin, neurofilament, and also ACTH. The other pituitary hor-
mones were negative.
Fragments of normal pituitary were observed, but there was no evidence
of hyperplasia or adenomatous component.
Complete tumour resection combined with adenoma absence on histo-
pathological analysis prompted a diagnosis of isolated/pure
gangliocytoma.
Four months after tumour resection, the patient is asymptomatic.
It is unlikely that the psychotic symptoms were related to the lesion.
Conclusion: Pure CGs are exceedingly rare sellar tumours, with only 21
cases reported. Its diagnosis relies on histopathological analysis, as image
studies cannot differentiate pure CGs from mixed gangliocytoma-
adenoma or conventional pituitary adenoma.
In the case we present, although ACTH was detected by immuno-
histochemistry, there was no peripheral hormonal secretion.
ACTH expression on pure sellar CGs supports the theory that
tumour cells represent a spectrum of mixed adenomatous and
gangliocytic features.

The distribution of cases of atypical meningioma based on age and
gender in West Romania
S. Bogdan*, R. Barna, A. Muresan, C. Lăzureanu
*Department of Pathology, Emergency Clinical County Hospital
Timisoara, Romania
Background & objectives: Atypical meningioma is a tumour with an
unpredictable evolution, a complete resection usually not being possible.
The purpose of this paper is to determine the incidence rate of atypical
meningioma based on the gender and age of patients.
Methods: Based on the pathological reports from the archives of our
Pathology Department, a retrospective study involving 692 patients diag-
nosed with brain tumours during 2018-2020 was conducted. The param-
eters chosen for this study were the type of tumour (atypical meningio-
ma), age of patients, and gender.
Results: Out of the total number of 692 patients, 138 (19.94%) were
diagnosed with meningioma, and out of the total cases of meningioma,
47 (34%) were atypical meningioma (Grade II). The youngest patient was
a 30-year-old male and the oldest was an 84 years old woman. The
average age at the time of diagnosis was 62.33 years; 61% of the patients
are females, with an average age of 63.1 years, whilst the average age in
men is 62.4 years. Men tend to be more affected by this pathology at the
ages of 65-75, not exclusively, whilst females are more prone to suffer
from atypical meningioma at 45-65 years.
Conclusion: To conclude, atypical meningioma is a tumour of the ner-
vous system that appears with predilection in women, at a younger age
than in men. It must be stated that at the age of 60-70, the ratio between
females and males tends to become relatively even. The results of our
paper are in concordance with the international dedicated literature.

Poulianitis, G. Theodoropoulou, N. Georgakoulias, T. Choreftaki
*"G.Gennimatas" General Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: We present a case of a giant cell tumour of
bone (GCTB) arising from the clivus.
Methods: A 36-year-old male arrived at our hospital with diplopia and a
history of headaches during the last year. Computer tomography showed
a mass of clivus extending to the sella turcica. We received several brown
coloured, elastic specimens with total dimensions 3.2X3X0.5cm.
Results: Histologically, the neoplasma consisted of mononuclear cells,
mainly round and focally spindle, in a vascular background with haemor-
rhage and haemosiderin pigment, separated by fibrous septa, without atypia
Virchows Arch
and 2-7 mitoses/high power field, and of numerous evenly distributed mul-
tinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells, without atypia or mitoses.
Immunohistochemical study showed positivity against CD68, PGM1
whereas it was negative against CKAE1/AE3, GFAP and S100. Ki67
(MIB1) was positive in 7% of the neoplastic nuclei. Hyperparathyroidism
was excluded. Thus, the diagnosis of giant cell tumour of bone was
concluded.
Conclusion: GCTB is an uncommon, usually benign neoplasm of early
adulthood, showing predilection for epiphyses of long bones. Skull
GCTBs are extremely rare (0.51% of all GCTBs), especially those orig-
inating from the clivus. Surgery with complete resection is the current
treatment of choice, though it is difficult to achieve.

A.M. Ciongariu, O. Paris
*Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Romania
Background & objectives: Ganglioneuromas are rare benign tumours
arose from neural crest cells of the autonomic nervous system. Well
differentiated and usually asymptomatic, a favourable prognosis is ex-
pected after treatment. We report a case of a massive ganglioneuroma
in a 14-year-old male.
Methods: A large paraspinal mass extended from T6 to T11 vertebrae was
resected after a thoracotomy and fragments were sent to a histopathological
examination. Gross description consisted of a well circumscribed, firm,
encapsulated white-yellow tumour measuring 17×14×15 cm.
Results: Histologically, the tumour composed of scattered mature ganglion
cells, Schwannian dense stroma and multiple mature nervous structures
with fibrous areas. Within the stroma, fascicles of elongated Schwann cells
with a single spindle-shaped wavy tachychromatic nucleus were present.
Ganglion cells showed abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with a single ec-
centric nucleus and prominent eosinophilic nucleolus. There were no sig-
nificant atypia or mitoses found. Immunohistochemistry showed positive
strains for S100 in both types of cells, Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
in Schwann cells, synaptophysin and chromogranin in ganglion cells,
aiding in the diagnosis of ganglioneuroma. Ki67 marker was positive in
under 1% tumour cells within the evaluated mass.
Conclusion: Ganglioneuromas represent a diagnostic challenge and con-
stitute a problem of differential diagnosis with other intra-thoracic tu-
mours, neurogenic tumours (ganglioneuroblastoma, neuroblastoma) or
nerve sheath tumours (neurofibroma). Being asymptomatic as it grows
slowly, it is usually an incidentaloma. Having such large dimensions
when found, compressive symptoms may appear, but they fade away
after surgical resection. Long term follow-up is recommended as rare
cases of malignant transformations of Schwann cells were reported.

mimic a wide variety of conditions, including lymphoma, leukaemia,
metastatic carcinoma, subacute meningitis, viral encephalitis hypotrophic
cranial pachymeningitis and others.
Methods: A 58-year-old man was admitted to the Neurosurgery
Department with obstructive hydrocephalus. Brain MRI with godalinium
contrast showed a lesion of abnormal signal located in the middle line.
Ventriculoscopy revealed dissemination, probably by melanocytes of the
choroid fissure, septum pellucidum, infundibulum, tuber cinereum, mam-
millary bodies, floor of 3rd ventricle and wall of basal artery. Biopsy was
performed.
Results: We received five black pigmented specimens of maximum di-
ameter 0,1-0,15cm. microscopic examination showed brain tissue infil-
tration by epithelioid cells containing melanin pigments in the cytoplasm,
with focal pleomorphic features. There was no sign of necrosis, anaplasia
or increased mitotic activity. Melanin bleaching was performed before
immunohistochemistry. The cells stained diffusely positive for Mart1,
HMB45, SOX10, foca;;y positive for S100 protein and negative against
GFAP, synaptophysin, CD34. Ki67 proliferation index (M1B1) was es-
timated 5%.
A full body scan was unremarkable in other sites and clinical examination
didn’t reveal any dermal melanocytic lesion. Diagnosis of melanomatosis
was established. The patient died about 3 weeks after administration.
Conclusion: Correlation of clinical, histological and imagine re-
sults as well as intraoperative state is mandatory. When dealing
with melanin pigmented lesions of the CNS. Metastatic melanoma
and other primary tumours of the CNS undergoing melanisation
(melanocytic schwannoma, medulloblastoma, paraganglioma, vari-
ous gliomas, meningiomas with melanocytic colonization) must be
safely ruled out.

*General Hospital of Athens "G. Gennimatas", Department of Pathology,
Greece
Background & objectives: Thymic carcinomas, classified as type C
thymomas according to the WHO classification, are rare epithelial malig-
nancies with marked invasive tendency.
Methods: We report a case of a 57-years old male patient presented with
abduens nerve palsy. Brain MRI showed heterogeneous morphology and
bone erosion of the clivus. A stereotactic brain biopsy was performed.
Results: Microscopical examination showed anastomosing solid sheets
and infiltrating small nests of highly cellular tumour cells with necrosis.
The tumour cells were epithelioid with large hyperchromatic nuclei and
prominent nucleoli, lying in a desmoplastic stroma containing small lym-
phocytes. Mitotic figures were frequent. In immunohistochemical stain-
ing the tumour cells were positive for: KerAEI/AE3, Ker7, Ker14,
Ker5/6, Ker34βE12, Ker19, p63, EMA, pCEA, CD5, CD117, and neg-
ative for: vimentin, Ker20, TTF1, CgA, SYP, p16, CDX2, RCC, PAX8,
Gata3, β-Catenin, CD34, BerEp4, Tdt, S100, ThG, PTH, p53,
MUC5AC. Ki67 proliferation index was approximately 35-40%.
Morphology and immunohistochemistry established the diagnosis of
metastatic thymic carcinoma
Conclusion: It is extremely rare and only 45 such cases have been re-
ported in the literature, associated with worse prognosis and short surviv-
al. We should always consider it in the differential diagnosis of intracra-
nial lesions of unknown primary.

Fatal toxic leukoencephalopathy and bilateral basal ganglia necrosis
associated with inhaled heroin and cocaine use: a case report
M. Jensen*, M. Briggs, K. Allinson
*Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Heroin-associated leukoencephalopathy is a
rare complication of heroin fume inhalation. The pathogenesis is poorly
understood and the diagnosis challenging. We present a case in a patient
with a history of substance abuse and describe the neuropathological
findings.
Virchows Arch
Methods: Detailed coronial autopsy was performed on the patient after a
post-mortem interval of 5 days. Histological sampling of the brain was
undertaken, and tissue slides were examined using a variety of histochem-
ical stains.
Results: A 32-year-old male with a history of illicit substance abuse
presented to the emergency department in status epilepticus. His friends
confirmed recent heroin use. CT head showed symmetrical basal ganglia
hypodensity with leukoencephalopathy. He was treated with naloxone,
anti-epileptics, and antibiotics but failed to improve. He died 9 days after
admission. Neuropathological examination showed bilateral symmetrical
red necrosis within the globus pallidi. Histology demonstrated extensive
demyelination of the central and gyral white matter with axonal sparing.
Hair toxicology was consistent with heavy heroin and cocaine use in the 2
months preceding his death. The cause of death was deemed to be toxic
leukoencephalopathy secondary to inhalation of heroin and cocaine.
Conclusion: Acute presentations of heroin-induced leukoencephalopathy
are rare but should be considered in the context of illicit substance abuse,
particularly in view of potential reversibility. We show the presence of
axonal sparing suggesting a demyelinating rather than hypoxic process as
central to the pathogenesis of acute heroin-induced leukoencephalopathy.

Expression of p53 protein in the hippocampus with increased
activity of the adrenal cortex after traumatization of the nasal
septum in rats
M. Kostyaeva, T. Fatkhudinov, S. Dragunova, T. Kosyreva, I. Kastyro*
*Peoples’ Friendship University of Russia, Russia
Background & objectives: Surgical interventions, provoke neurons ap-
optosis (AN) activation in the hippocampus(H). Damage to the nasal
septum(NS) when modelling septoplasty in rats is of particular impor-
tance. Aims: to study expression of p53protein in H with increased cor-
ticosterone after traumatization of rats NS.
Methods: NS mucous membrane in 10rats was scarified over its entire
length under anaesthesia with zoletil100. The corticosterone concentra-
tion was determined and brain sections were stained with mouse antibod-
ies to p53 2,4,6 days after surgery. AN in hippocampal CA1, CA2, CA3
subfield layer was calculated over a length of 574.3±13.5μm and a width
of 121.94±31.5μm. The results obtained were compared with a control
group(CG,5rats).
Results: In hippocampal CA1, CA2, CA3 subfield at all terms, there were
more p53-positive neurons than in the control group (0.98±0.6; 0.86
±0.28; 0.32±0.08; 8.17±3.08, respectively) (p<0.001). The peak of p53
expression in neurons occurred on 4th day in CA1 (9.27±2.63), 2nd&4th
days in CA2 (5.5±2.55; 5.6±0.77), and the number of p53-positive neu-
rons in CA3 were consistently high all three days (11.86±3.35; 12.15
±3.64; 11.5±2.29, respectively). After septoplasty, compared with CG
(38.56±2.12ng/ml), corticosterone increased on 2nd day, on 4th day
(122.55±5.38ng/ml) & 6th day (118.35±5,69ng/ml) decreased, but
retained its stable blood concentration.
Conclusion: Considering the proven presence of mineralocorticoid and
glucocorticoid receptors in hippocampal neurons, it can be assumed that
the expression of the p53 protein in the cytoplasm of neurons in the
pyramidal layer of the hippocampus is closely associated with an increase
in the concentration of corticosteroids after surgical trauma of the nasal
septum in rats.

Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with Waldenström macroglobuline-
mia: report of a rare entity with a challenging diagnosis
Z. Lajmi*, W. Majdoub, A. Ben Mabrouk, M. Krifa, E. Ben Ammou, H.
Hamchi, T. Dahmoul, A. Bdioui, S. Hmissa
*Sahloul Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) is a
rare low-grade B-cell lymphoma. Waldenström macroglobulinemia
(WM) is found in a substantial subset of patients with LPL. It is defined
as an LPL involving the bone marrow with IgM monoclonal paraprotein
of any concentration.
Methods: A 64-year-old woman presented with persistent severe head-
ache for a month. Brain MRI revealed a strong and homogenous enhance-
ment with contrast, suggesting a right fronto-parietal osteo-dural menin-
gioma or metastasis. Biopsies were performed.
Results: Histopathological evaluation revealed a diffuse tumour prolifer-
ation of small lymphocytes admixed with variable numbers of
plasmacytoid lymphocytes and plasma cells. Many mitotic figures were
present. Pseudointranuclear (Dutcher bodies) and intracytoplasmic inclu-
sions (Russell bodies) were detected.
Using immunohistochemistry, tumour cells were CD20-positive and
CD3-negative. The diagnosis of a non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma was
retained. Furthermore, tumour cells displayed Bcl2 and CD79a positivity.
No CD5, CD10 and Bcl6 immunostaining was observed.
Consequently, the final diagnosis was a cerebral infiltration with an LPL/
WM with bone extension.
Conclusion: LPL/WM is a rare disease. Its diagnosis can be challenging
due to similarities to other small B-cell lymphomas with plasmacytic
differentiation and/or with IgM paraproteins. Bone marrow morphology
and immunophenotype are important for diagnosis.

Central neurocytoma: experience of a centre in southern Tunisia
M. Mellouli*, F. Kolsi, C. Kammoun, L. Jaidane, I. Bahri, T. Boudawara,
R. Kallel
*Habib Bourguiba Hospital, Department of Pathology, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Central neurocytomas (CN) are rare intra-
ventricular tumours with prominent neuronal differentiation. Few studies
have described the clinical and pathological features of these tumours. We
report twelve patients with CN and discuss the histological differential
diagnosis of these tumours.
Methods: Between 1999 and 2018, 12 patients were diagnosed with CN
at our hospital. These tumours were retrospectively analysed with refer-
ence to their epidemiological and histopathological features.
Results: The male: female ratio was 2/1 and the mean age at diagnosis
was 25 years (10–49 years). Nine tumours occupied the lateral ventricle
and three was located in the Fourth ventricle. All patients underwent
surgery, with eight undergoing macroscopic total excision and four,
partial excision. All tumours consisted of small uniform cells with re-
markably round nuclei in a fine fibrillary matrix. Oligodendroglioma-
like pattern was found in 2 cases and pseudorosettes in 5 cases. All
tumour tissues that were examined showed positive immunoreactivity
for synaptophysin and NSE. Four cases were positive for GFAP. No
adjuvant radiotherapy was given. Two patients developed tumour
recurrence.
Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that CN should be consid-
ered in the differential diagnosis of intraventricular brain tumours, partic-
ularly those located in the lateral ventricles. CN must be distinguished
from other clear cell tumours.

Pathology -CEDMOG, “Ovidius” University of Constanţa, Romania
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Although radiological imaging has substan-
tially improved, assessment of prognosis by grading astrocytoma has
been challenging task for pathologist. We have tried to describe the char-
acteristics of astrocytomas and analyse the most efficient techniques for
evaluation.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective descriptive study of patients
with astrocytomas seen at our institution between 2011-2020. We divided
the astrocytic tumours according to the histopathological grade into low-
grade astrocytomas and high-grade astrocytomas. The morphological
criteria and role of imaging method were analysed. The data were entered
into the SPSS Statistics and were analysed according to demographic and
diagnostic parameters.
Results: We identified 117 cases of astrocytic tumours. Most cases iden-
tified both histopathologically and by imaging methods - computer to-
mography or magnetic resonance imaging - were high-grade astrocyto-
mas, 76.07%, respectively 79.2%. We identified a predominance of low-
grade astrocytomas over females, 53.57%. High-grade astrocytomas were
frequently found in the parietal lobe of right hemisphere (12.94%), while
low-grade astrocytomas were found in the temporal lobe of the left hemi-
sphere (18.52%). Given the specific characteristic of high-grade astrocy-
tomas, infiltrativity, the largest tumour diameters were recorded in this
category (94.39%).
Conclusion: We noticed that both low-grade and high-grade astrocyto-
mas frequently occur in the sixth decade of life. In terms of imaging, most
cases have been described as potentially malignant tumours, without a
definite topographic predisposition. In most cases, a concordance of the
imaging diagnosis with the histopathological one was observed, this as-
pect leading to a more accurate assessment of the two astrocytic catego-
ries. The results of our study bring new information on the epidemiolog-
ical data of astrocytomas in the region.

Giant cell glioblastoma: a subtype of glioblastoma with distinct clin-
icopathological features
M. Triki*, M. Zghal, S. Makni, C. Kammoun, L. Ayadi, T. Boudawara,
O. Boudawara
*Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Giant cell glioblastoma (GCG) is included in
the latest World Health Organization classification as an uncommon sub-
type of glioblastoma (GB), with distinct clinical and biological features.
Our aim is to analyse epidemiological, clinical and pathological features
of this rare tumour.
Methods: This is a retrospective and descriptive study of 6 cases of GCG
registered at the department of pathology of Sfax’s university hospital
(Tunisia), during a period of 11 years from 2010 to 2020. Clinical, epi-
demiological and pathological characteristics were retrospectively
reviewed.
Results: GCG accounted for 2 % of patients diagnosed with GB. The
mean age was 32,6 years (1-60 years). The study included 5 women and 1
man. Temporal lobe was involved in 5 cases and frontal lobe was in-
volved in 1 case. All tumour developed de novo. Surgical resection was
performed in 5 patients and stereotactic biopsy in one. Microscopically,
there was a highly cellular glial proliferation with predominant pleomor-
phic multinucleated giant cells. Numerous atypical mitotic figures were
present. Pseudo-palisading tumour necrosis was identified in 4 cases.
Vascular endothelial proliferation was present in 3 cases. Sarcomatous
component was absent. Immunohistochemical analysis performed in 4
cases was positive for GFAP.
Conclusion: GCG is an uncommon tumour accounting for 2-5% of GB.
Genetically, GCG is considered a variant of IDH-wild type GB but with
high frequency of TP53 mutation and lack of EGFR amplification.
Macroscopically it is well limited and histologically it is characterized
by the presence of plentiful bizarre multinucleated giant cells. Although
their poor prognosis, GCG has a somewhat better outcome than ordinary
GB. This can be partially explained by the fact that it occurs most often in
younger people.

Atypical meningioma with Arnold Chiari Malformation (ACM) and
syringomyelia: a case report
A. Ugur Simal*, M. Çimen, S. Solak, O. Şimşek, T.D. Yalta, F. Öz Puyan
*Trakya University Faculty of Medicine, Turkey
Background & objectives: Atypical meningiomas are aggressive tu-
mours, composing around 5-15% of all meningiomas. They display mi-
totic activity with increased cellularity, necrotic foci, and loss of lobular
architecture. ACM and syringomyelia can be congenital or infrequently
develop following a cranial mass, mostly meningiomas.
Methods: Our case is a 53-year-old woman with a known Diabetes
Mellitus Type 2 and hypertension for 15 years. She was later found to
have congenital ACM and syringomyelia following its initial scans and
was followed for syringomyelia and a meningioma for three years. She
was admitted to the hospital for worsening headaches and dizziness for
the last three months.
Results: The patient’s symptoms were suspected to arise from ACM.
Cranial MRI showed ACM type I, syringomyelia, and a meningioma in
the right parietal lobe. The patient underwent surgery for both ACM and a
meningioma. The mass was fully resected, and posterior fossa decom-
pression was performed for ACM. In the histopathologic examination,
the tumour section showed mitotic activity, cellularity prominence, and
necrotic foci. The mitotic count was 8 -10/ 10 High-Power Fields (HPF).
These findings were compatible with WHO Grade II Atypical meningi-
oma. Subsequently, she received 24-day postoperative radiotherapy. She
later developed left side mild muscle weakness and described urgency
type urinary incontinence within one year of follow-up.
Conclusion: Atypical meningiomas are uncommon entities of all menin-
giomas, and accompanying congenital problems can overlap the main
symptoms of a space-occupying mass. A long follow-up period is impor-
tant for patients diagnosed with atypical meningioma considering their
aggressive behaviour.

Cervical giant benign notochordal cell tumour in an adult male: a
rare entity with an unusual location
A.M. Vrâncianu*, M.G. Lisievici, C. Cocosila, C. Zamfir, A. Evsei, D.
Costache, D. Pasov
*Pathology Department, Colentina University Clinical Hospital,
Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Of the few cases of benign notochordal cell
tumour (BNCT) described in the literature, a minority had a spinal location,
mostly being found in the prepontine area, sphenoid sinus, some in the
sacrococcigeal region. Distinguishing BNCTs from chordomas is crucial.
Methods: A 29-year-old male admitted to Neurosurgery Department (11/
2020) for right-sided cervicobrachialgia, brachial motor deficit.
Neuroimaging: T2-hyperintense/T1-hypointense 38/24/38mm lobulatedtu-
mour centred on C4, reaching C6, transforaminal (widened foramina), spi-
nal canal 60% narrowed, cord compression, surrounding the vertebral artery
(without invasion/stenosis), extension to prevertebral muscles, minor ero-
sions of C5 vertebral body. Intraoperative frozen sections (toluidine blue),
paraffin examination (H&E, immunohistochemistry) were performed.
Results: The preoperative diagnosis was of schwannoma/neurofibroma.
Intraoperative consultation of the extradural gelatinous mass revealed a
proliferation of well-circumscribed cells with clear, bubbly cytoplasm
and bland round-to-oval nuclei with mild anisonucleosis (physaliphorous
cells of notochordal origin) without atypia, mitotic activity or necrosis.
The paraffin microsections (H&E) showed similar aspects and no infil-
tration or destruction of the adjacent tissue.
Virchows Arch
Corroborating the histological aspect with the clinical and imagistic as-
pects, a diagnosis of a chordoid lesion, suggesting BNCT was made.
Immunohistochemical assays showed positivity for S100, AE1/AE3,
EMA, CK18, 3% Ki-67 index, strengthening the previous diagnosis.
Postoperative course: diminishing cervicobrachialgia, no additional mo-
tor deficit, discharged 8 days later.
Conclusion: Distinguishing BNCTs from their malignant counterpart,
chordoma, is of paramount importance and it can be challenging. They
are phylogenetically, histologically, and clinically closely related.
Contrast enhancement, Ki-67 index, CK18 positivity, CNS involvement
are helpful in making the distinction.
While BNCTs are usually asymptomatic, this case shows that these tu-
mours can be large and cause compressive symptoms early in life, requir-
ing surgical treatment. The extradural location of this BNCT shows that it
can be isolated to the epidural space, like chordomas.

Primary intraorbital myxoid (metaplastic) meningioma
S. Kepuladze*, T. Muzashvili, T. Mosidze, G. Burkadze
*Tbilisi State Medical University, Georgia
Background & objectives: Meningiomas represent approximately 4%
of all intraorbital tumours and can arise from the optic nerve. Myxoid
meningioma is a rare histological variant of meningiomas grouped into
the subtype of metaplastic meningiomas (World grade I).
Methods: Hereby, we report a case of a myxoid meningioma in a 55-
year-old female who presented gradual bulging of the right eye
(proptosis) over the past 10 years. Last year optic nerve compression
was causing loss of vision. Imaging studies showed a 7x4mm pigmented
neoplasm overlying the conjunctiva. The tumour was excised completely.
Results: Histopathology revealed a benign appearing myxoid neoplasm
with uniform elongated alcian blue positive cells, without any atypia and
a very low mitotic activity.
Immunohistochemical examination was used including these antibodies:
CK8/18 (-); CK7 (-); CK20 (-); CK5 (-); S100 (-); HMB45 (-); CD56 (-);
Synaptofisin (-); CD68 (-); CD34 (-); P53 (-);CDX2 (-); SMA(-); GFAP
(-); EMA (+) Vim (+);CD45 (+)Ki67 –3%;
Immunohistochemical stains showed positivity for vimentin and epithe-
lial membrane antigen confirming the diagnosis of myxoid meningioma.
Conclusion: Myxoid (metaplastic) meningioma is exceptionally rare his-
tological variant of meningiomas arising in intraorbital tumours. Only eight
cases of myxoid meningioma have been reported till date in the literature.
Intraorbital meningiomas were most frequently of the meningothelial or
transitional subtypes none of them was diagnosed as metaplastic variant.

Solitary fibrous tumour of the orbit: a case report and review of the
literature on a rare entity
N.J. Lamas*, A.P. Rodrigues, A. Coelho, J.R. Vizcaíno
*Anatomic Pathology Service, Department of Pathology, Centro
Hospitalar e Universitário do Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: The solitary fibrous tumour (SFT) is a rare
neoplasm of uncertain histogenesis originally described in the intratho-
racic region, but which has been recently described in other sites includ-
ing unusually in the orbit.
Methods: We report the case of a 53-year-old female with a history of
right orbital swelling, ptosis and visual change evolving for 8 months.
The CT scan showed an ovoid and lobulated lesion in the superomedial
quadrant with 22x22x11mm. The lesion apparently contacted the eyeball,
the medial rectus and superior rectus muscles, without signs of invasion.
The lesion was removed surgically.
Results: We received an irregular fragment of brownish elastic tissue
measuring 25x17x5mm. The histological analysis showed fibroadipose
tissue almost completely occupied by a mesenchymal neoplasia
consisting of ovoid to fusiform cells, with poorly defined cytoplasmic
limits, scarce cytoplasm and small to intermediate-sized hyperchromatic
nuclei, sometimes with evident nucleoli and occasional images of nuclear
pseudoinclusions. Pleomorphism was mild to moderate. Two mitoses in
10 high-power fields were identified. The cells were distributed in a
disorganized manner around a rich vascular network, sometimes with
staghorn vessels. The neoplastic cells had strong and diffuse staining with
antibodies for CD34 and STAT6 and were focally positive for MDM2.
CD45, SOX10 and CAM5.2 were negative.
Conclusion: This case illustrates the main features of this rare orbital
entity. The combined WHO score for metastasis risk was low in this case.
However, the lesion was incompletely excised. Nearly 1/3 of the solitary
fibrous tumours of the orbit have local recurrences. Distant metastasis are
uncommon and might only occur after extended periods. Therefore, it is of
fundamental value to perform a long-term follow-up of these patients.
Currently, our patient remains well, without signs of local or distant disease.

Basaloid follicular hamartoma of the eyelid: a case report and review
of the literature on a rare entity
N.J. Lamas*, A.P. Rodrigues, A. Coelho, J.R. Vizcaíno
*Anatomic Pathology Service, Department of Pathology, Centro
Hospitalar e Universitário do Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Basaloid follicular hamartoma (BFH) is a
benign unusual malformative lesion involving the hair follicles, which
normally poses challenges in the differential diagnosis with other benign
tumours of the follicular infundibulum and infundibulocystic basal cell
carcinoma due to significant morphological overlap.
Methods: We report the case of a 53-year-old male who presented with a
mass in the upper left eyelid evolving for one year, centred in the
cutaneous-conjunctival transition area. The patient had a previous history
of total colectomy within the context of familial adenomatous polyposis.
The eyelid lesion was biopsied.
Results: We received three fragments, elastic and whitish, between 4 mm
and 5 mm. The histological analysis showed fragments with cutaneous-
conjunctival lining displaying a subepithelial proliferation of basaloid nests,
with peripheral palisade, consistent with primitive hair follicles. There was
preservation of their connection to the epithelial lining and images of anas-
tomosis between different basaloid nests. The background stroma had high
cellularity and sometimes primitive mesenchymal papillae were evident.
The pleomorphism was scant, mitotic figures scarce and necrosis was ab-
sent. Most of the nests did not present epithelial-stromal retraction nor mu-
coid deposits. The initially proposed diagnosis of basaloid follicular
hamartoma was later confirmed after the excision of the whole eyelid lesion.
Conclusion: This case illustrates the main features of this rare benign
eyelid entity, which is associated with inherited genetic syndromes name-
ly mutations in the patched (PTCH) gene on chromosome band 9q23. The
standard medical or surgical approach of these lesions remains to be
firmly established. Currently, our patient remains well, without signs of
local recurrence.

Case report: choroid metastasis from endometrioid carcinoma
G. Nora*, C.S. de Jesus Fazzio, E. Coronato Nogueira Constantino, S.
Longarini Gonçalves
*Hospital de Base/FAMERP, Brazil
Background & objectives: To report a case of a uterine endometrioid car-
cinoma diagnosed in January 2021, metastatic to the eye in February 2021.
Virchows Arch
Methods: Review of medical record, anatomopathological reports and
immunohistochemical study.
Results: Female, 60-year-old, menopause at age 55, seeks medical atten-
tion due to large amount of vaginal bleeding, in addition to dysmenor-
rhea, asthenia and weight loss. She underwent uterine curettage for mi-
croscopic evaluation of the endometrium, which showed poorly differen-
tiated endometrioid carcinoma. Immunohistochemical study exhibited
positive reaction for CK7, p53 and p16; and negative reaction for hor-
monal receptors (oestrogen/progesteron) and HER2. After diagnostic
confirmation, the patient was admitted for tumour staging with imaging
tests that showed lesions suggestive of metastases to the peritoneum,
ovaries, and lung. After clinical worsening, the patient died. The patient’s
corneas were donated, and eyeballs were sent for microscopic analysis,
that revealed metastasis to the choroid region.
Conclusion: Endometrial carcinoma metastases usually occur via lym-
phatic system. Hematogenous metastases are less common, but they can
occur; the most common sites are lung, liver, brain, and bone. Choroid
metastases from endometrial cancer are extremely rare and there are only
very few cases described in the literature.

Intra- and periocular metastatic renal cell carcinoma mimicking cho-
roidal melanoma and presumed keratoacanthoma
B. Pencz*, J. Tóth, O. Lukáts
*2nd Department of Pathology, Semmelweis University, Hungary
Background & objectives: We aim to show that the eyeball and
periocular region are uncommon but known potential metastatic sites of
renal cell carcinoma.
Methods: We are presenting three ophthalmologic cases. The lesions
presented in different clinical settings and were of unknown origin at
the time of diagnosis. The first two cases were thought to be choroidal
melanoma based on ultrasound, and the third neoplasm was supposed to
be a primary conjunctival neoplasm of epithelial origin. All lesions were
removed, the first two required enucleation.
Results: Renal origin was proved by immunohistochemistry and the
primary tumour was found.
Conclusion: The cost-benefit ratio of complicated ocular biopsy proce-
dures improves with increasing access to multiple potential treatment
options.

Conjunctival myxoma: a rare ocular tumour
M. Walha*, M. Bouhamed, I. Bahri, M. Mellouli, C. Kammoun, L.
Ayadi, N. Gouia, T. Boudawara
*University Hospital of Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Conjunctival myxoma (CM) is a rare ocular
benign neoplasm, with an incidence ranging from 0.001-0.002% of all
conjunctival lesions. The aim of this study is to report an observation
about a CM and discuss its differential diagnoses.
Methods: A 54-year-old woman presented with a history of one year
gradually progressing, painless, conjunctival swelling, on her left eye.
Her medical and family history was unremarkable. A slit-lamp examina-
tion of the right eye was unremarkable, in the left eye; it revealed a well-
circumscribed, pinkish, conjunctival mass, translucent and freely mobile
over the sclera, measuring 5×3mm.
Results: The lesion was clinically diagnosed as a conjunctival cyst, and it
was completely excised. Histopathological examination revealed a low-
density cellular proliferation; the cells were stellate or fusiform, dispersed
in an abundant myxoid stroma. Nuclear atypia and mitotic figure were
absent. Few branching vascular structures with thin wall and scattered
lymphocytes were also seen. Immunohistochemical study showed strong-
ly positive expression of vimentin. The tumour cells were negative for
smooth muscle actin, desmin and PS100. The diagnosis of CM was
retained. The patient received extensive cardiac and endocrine evaluation.
She had no atypical dermatological findings. After 14 months, the patient
remained healthy, with no recurrence of the conjunctival lesion.
Conclusion: Myxomas have common histologic appearance of myxoid
ground substance. They are most often found in atrial endocardium and
jaw bones. Less commonly, they have been reported in the orbit, cornea,
lids and conjunctiva. CM was first described by Magalif in 1913. To our
knowledge, only 64 cases of this lesion have been published in the liter-
ature. Surgical excision and histopathologic examination of this lesion are
necessary. The differential diagnosis of CM includes myxoid neurofibro-

Adult patient with malignant intraocular medulloepithelioma: a case
report
S. Yonat İşgüder*, B. Ögüt, B. Tarlan
*Department of Pathology of Gazi University Medical School, Turkey
Background & objectives: Intraocular medulloepithelioma (IME),
which is extremely rare in adults, is a congenital tumour of the non-
pigmented ciliary epithelium. Malignant form of IME consists of
neuroblastic cells around neuroepithelial rosettes. We present a malignant
IME case seen in an adult patient.
Methods: An intraocular mass was detected in a 71-year-old male patient,
who was admitted to the hospital with loss of vision in the right eye.
Cytological material was taken from the mass intraoperatively and atypical
discohesive cells which had brown pigment and prominent nucleoli, were
seen in cytological examination. Therefore, malignant melanoma was con-
sidered primarily. Whereupon right eye enucleation was performed.
Results: Leukocoria was observed in the macroscopic examination of the
enucleation material. When the eyeball is sliced, a black-grey coloured solid
lesion, which is filling the anterior chamber and infiltrating iris, ciliary body,
and retina was seen. In the microscopic examination, a highly cellular tumour
with increased mitotic activity but not mesenchymal differentiation was com-
posed of elongated and round, poorly differentiated and immature cells, which
were arranged into solid, trabecular pattern, and retinoblastoma-like rosettes as
well. Sclera and cornea infiltration were also present microscopically. Tumour
cells were stained with chromogranin, synaptophysin, NSE, and S-100,
immunohistochemically. HMB-45 and Melan-A were focally positive and
negative, respectively. The patient was diagnosed with malignant IME.
Conclusion: Medulloepithelioma is generally known as a benign child-
hood tumour. Our case was deemed worthy of presentation, since it is
seen in adulthood, the tumour has a malignant course and cytologically
mimics malignant melanoma.

Structural features of suicidal behaviour in central Kazakhstan
S. Adilbek*, U. Raiymbek
*Karaganda Medical University, Kazakhstan
Background & objectives: One of the socially significant problems in
modern society is the rising death rates from suicide. The aim is to study
changes in the prevalence of suicide methods, analyse the dynamics,
structure and social characteristics of suicides in Central Kazakhstan.
Methods: Retrospective analysis of 634 forensic medical examinations
carried out on the territory of Central Kazakhstan. The analysis of the
dynamics, structure and social characteristics of suicides: place of resi-
dence, age, social status, ethnic origins, gender, method of committing
suicide from 2016 to 2020. Methods of applied statistical analysis were
used to analyse the obtained results.
Virchows Arch
Results: There was a decrease in the total number of suicides in
Central Kazakhstan in 2020 by 13.8% in general, 11% in men, 30%
in women. The results of the study showed that in the structure of
methods of committing suicides by residents of Central Kazakhstan,
regardless of gender, a special place occupied by hanging. The sui-
cide patterns indicate that men use more aggressive methods of sui-
cide. The number of suicides in men increases with age and reaches a
maximum in the age groups of 31-40 and 41-50 years old. In women,
the number of suicides rises sharply in the age group from 21 to 30
years old.
Conclusion: The summarized data make it possible to form a whole
picture of the peculiarities of suicidal behaviour of the population of
Central Kazakhstan and are valuable in terms of identifying the most
vulnerable age and gender groups. Particular attention should be paid to
the growing number of suicides among young men of 25-29 years old.
This is a trend in recent years and demonstrates the "rejuvenation" of
suicides.

Critical evaluation of the laryngohyoid bone fracture in suicidal
hanging
S. Adilbek*, O. Koldassov, I. Zhumageldikyzy
*Karaganda Medical University, Kazakhstan
Background & objectives: Fractures of the larynx in hanged men are
one of the most studied and paradoxically controversial topics in forensic
pathology. According to the literature sources, the incidence of laryngeal-
hyoid bone fractures during hanging varies significantly from 0% to
100%.
Methods: In order to test the diagnostic significance of hanging in-
juries, we prospectively and sequentially analysed the occurrence of
laryngeal-hyoid fractures in a group of 194 suicidal hanging victims
depending on the selected variables (age, gender, weight, complete-
ness of suspension of the body and location of the ligature node).
Results: In 141cases of 194 (72.5%) revealed the types of fractures:
isolated fracture of the shield-like cartilage in 65 cases (33.7%),
combined thyroid fractures in 45 cases (23%), isolated fractures of
the hyoid bone in 30 cases (15.7%) and the absence of fractures of the
cricoid cartilage or cervical vertebrae. A high frequency of fractures
of the laryngeal-hyoid bone was found with collateral hanging.
Statistical analysis revealed a significant relationship between the
occurrence of fractures of the laryngeal-hyoid bone with the age of
the victim (p = 0.028), the position of the ligature node on the neck (p
= 0.019), and the weight of the victim, adjusted for age.
Conclusion: As the results of our research, and the literature analysis as
well suggests that, when properly assessed, hanging fractures of the
laryngohyoid bone can provide much more diagnostic evidence than just
evidence that neck injury has occurred, and can provide research oppor-
tunities on a number of issues that need to be analysed and to be explained
later.

Inguinal lymphadenopathy: a diagnostic challenge
M. Ben Thayer*, F. Khanchel, I. Helal, A. Hmidi, E. Ben Brahim, R.
Jouini, A. Chadli-Debbiche
*Department of Pathology, Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Inguinal nodes are usually benign and re-
gress spontaneously in most patients. They can be caused by a broad
spectrum of diseases ranging from infectious diseases, autoimmune dis-
eases to several malignancies. We aim to identify etiologic panel
diagnosis’s of Inguinal Lymphadenopathies.
Methods: The study was retrospective in a period of five years (2016-
2020). We included all cases of nodes dissections and biopsies in guinal
lymph nodes. Histopathology reports of 31 were reviewed.
Results: A total of 31 patients was includes. They were diagnosed in 6
men and 25 women with mean age of 36,8±18,64 years.
The size of the inguinal lymph node ranged from 0.4 to 7 cm with a mean
size of 2,52±1,35 cm.
We have diagnosed 20 reactive lymphadenitis (64,5 %), 4 cases of
Hodgkin Lymphoma (12.90%), one case of follicular lymphoma, one
case of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and 2 cases of ganglionar
tuberculosis. A lymph node localization of fungoid mycosis was
demonstrated in one case and extramedullary haematopoiesis in an-
other one. In one patient, pathological analysis was not possible be-
cause the sample was autolyzed due to delayed fixation.
Conclusion: Inguinal lymphadenopathy are generally benign and re-
active to infectious or inflammatory diseases which has been con-
firmed by our study (64.5% of our samples were reactive lymphade-
nopathies). However, they can be the only way to reveal other pathol-
ogies, especially neoplastic ones (22.5% of our patients had
lymphomas).Lymph node biopsies are needed to make the diagnosis.
A methodological approach to inguinal lymphadenopathy can dis-
close the accurate diagnosis, enable patients to receive the proper
treatment and reduce mortality.

Von-Hippel-Lindau disease: a study of a misleading case
E. Ben Ammou*, A. Bdioui, O. Belkacem, Z. Lajmi, A. Ben Mabrouk, L.
Lassoued, T. Dahmoul, H. Hamchi, S. Hmissa
*Department of Pathology, Sahloul University Hospital Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Von-Hippel-Lindau disease(VHLd) is a he-
reditary disorder associating both benign and malignant neoplasms
scattered throughout the body. The main causes of morbi-mortality are
central nervous system(SNC) hemangioblastomas and clear-cell renal cell
carcinoma (CCRC). Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NET) represent
an additional risk.
Methods: We report a case of VHL to highlight some of the tumours
encountered and emphasize the importance of a thorough pathological
examination.
Results: The patient is a 47-year-old female first diagnosed in 1999 with
a right-sided pheochromocytoma, then with hemangioblastomas.
Lately, CT-scan showed a left-sided adrenal-gland tumour suggest-
ing a pheochromocytoma, a hypervascular right renal lesion seem-
ingly malignant, multiple renal cysts and 2pancreatic lesions: a 10cm
cystadenoma and a hypervascular lesion(0.3cm) probably a NET.
She underwent surgery. There was well-circumcised brown nodule
of the adrenal-gland, microscopically a pheochromocytoma. The re-
nal tumour was encapsulated and yellowish. The renal cysts were
smoothly-lined, full of water-like-liquid. All those lesions were
CCRCs. The pancreas harboured multiple cysts full of a yellowish
fluid. Histologically, they were serous cystadenomas. There was a
well-defined fibro-vascular non-tumoral pancreatic nodule, probably
the “suspected-NET”.
Conclusion: Although no molecular diagnosis is available for this
case, a genetic screening for the family members should be done as
early-stage identification is key to well managing the disease.

The hidden art of our daily pathology
O. Cojocaru*
*Clinical Service of Pathology, “Sf. Apostol Andrei” Emergency County
Hospital, Constanţa, Romania; Faculty of Medicine, Ovidius University
Constanta, Romania
Background & objectives: From the normal histological structure to the
pathological changes, from the routine to the specific stains, from the
immunohistochemical to the molecular tests, from the single slide cases
to those with numerous sections and sections, we can discover art.
Virchows Arch
Methods: Microscopic analysis from the daily routine, the examination
of each slide from each case, brings me every working hour, under my
eyes, through the lentils a lots of images. HE stain makes me to see pink
structures and makes me to analyse them not only from pathological point
of view, but from artistic one.
Results: Blood vessels, atypical mitosis, haemorrhage, necrosis, choles-
terol crystals, smooth or skeletal muscles, cartilage or bone tissue.
Colonic biopsy, palatine tonsils, cervico-vaginal smear, placenta,
ombilical cord, amniotic plate, renal glomerulus.
Skin, melanomas, hair follicles, nevi, placental vili, lithiasis, colonic
adenomas.
Parasites, Pacini corpuscles, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, tuberculosis.
Embryonic and foetal structures.
Artefacts.
Conclusion: It is said that the beauty is the eye of the beholder. I say the
beauty is the eye of the pathologist. The images on the pathologist's retina
can help to relax, to see beyond the histopathological diagnosis.
Histology and histopathology provide us a different kind of art. The art
of the cells. The art of the tissues and organs. The art inside of human
bodies.

Testicular cavernous haemangioma that could lead to diagnostic dif-
ficulties among testicular neoplasms; a rare case report
E. Genc Erdogan*, M. Azatçam, İ. Usta, E. Mercan Demirtaş, N. Can
*Department of Pathology, Lüleburgaz State Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Cavernous haemangioma, a benign vascular
tumour, is rarely seen in the testis. Before orchiectomy operation, it is
difficult to differentiate from other common benign and malign condi-
tions of the testis.
Methods: A 38-year-old male patient had swelling and pain in the scro-
tum for about one week. Ultrasonographic examination showed an irreg-
ularly contoured semi-solid mass with hypervascular characteristics that
infiltrate the left testicular parenchyma and cause parenchymal cystic/
haemorrhagic degeneration interpreted as a left testicular tumour. Serum
levels of tumour markers were normal.
Results: Radical orchiectomy material was sent with a pre-diagnosis of
malignancy to our laboratory. Gross examination exhibited a well-
circumscribed, 3x2.2x1.9 cm sized intense bleeding lesion, and intact
testicular tissue was not observed. Microscopic examination revealed
dilated spaces filled with erythrocytes which erased almost all of the
testicular tissue. Histopathological examination showed benign vascular
proliferation in left testicular tissue, the case was diagnosed with
Cavernous Haemangioma.
Conclusion: Cavernous haemangioma is an uncommon tumour among
testicular neoplasms. Clinical examination and imaging studies are gen-
erally not sufficient for diagnosis. Orchiectomy and then histopathologi-
cal evaluation are required for definitive diagnosis.

Synchronous clear cell renal cell carcinoma and marginal zone lym-
phoma: a case presentation
E. Gioti*, P. Dolkiras, K. Christofidis, I. Nitsios, A. Sykaras, C.
Karantzias, N. Stavrinou
*Evaggelismos Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: During the years there has been an increase
in the number of patients who are diagnosed with synchronous primary
neoplasms. Here we will present the case of a patient with synchronous
renal cell carcinoma and marginal zone lymphoma.
Methods: A 61-year-old man was presented with a random finding of a
tumour in the right kidney during an ultrasound examination. The tumour
was surgical removed with a partial nephrectomy and sent to our
department.
Results: Histological examination revealed the presence of a clear cell renal
cell carcinoma, nuclear grade 1-2. The tumour measured 2,5cm in maxi-
mum diameter and was confined within the renal parenchyma, without
perinephric fat extension (pathological staging pT1aNx). Additionally, the
examination of the perinephric fat sections revealed the presence of a dif-
fuse and dense neoplastic lymphoid infiltrate that partly invaded the renal
parenchyma. The abnormal lymphocytes had small/medium size, expressed
CD20 and focally IgM whereas they were negative for CD5, CD3,
cyclinD1, Sox-11 and Lef-1. The morphology and immunophenotyping
were consistent with the diagnosis of marginal zone lymphoma.
Conclusion: Coexistence of renal cell carcinoma and Non-Hodgkin B-
cell lymphoma is what makes this case unique. Few similar cases were
reported, one of which suggests that patients with non-Hodgkin lympho-
ma have an increased risk for renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, we are
looking forward to a future research which could prove the correlation
between these two neoplasms or even identifying one as an etiological
factor for the other.

A misleading isolated mass of pelvis in a male patient
A. Hassine*, W. Majdoub, M. Krifa, A. Ben Mabrouk, E. Ben Amou, Z.
Lajmi, T. Dahmoul, H. Hamchi, A. Bdioui, S. Hmissa
*Sahloul Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Cystic mass of the pelvis in male patients are
challenging diagnostic abnormalities because they are uncommon, and
their origin is uncertain. We report a case of an isolated cystic mass of the
pelvis in a male patient.
Methods: A 51-year-old man, consulted for a pelvic heaviness-type pain
associated with intermittent constipation. Clinical examination did not
reveal any abnormalities. An abdominal-pelvic scan detected an isolated
well-limited, slightly enhanced central pelvic mass of 32x45 mm, devel-
oping at the expense an ileal loop consisting with a gastro-intestinal
stromal tumour. On Surgery, there was a non-organ dependent, encapsu-
lated oval, resection was performed.
Results: Macroscopic examination of the surgical specimen showed a
cystic renitent mass, thin walled with yellowish membranes, when cut.
Microscopy revealed anhist lamellar eosinophilic membranes, which are
PAS positive. The diagnosis of hydatid cyst was made. Hydatid serology
was positive, thus confirming the diagnosis.
Conclusion: Clinical symptoms of hydatidosis are not specific and the
diagnosis may not be evident in some cases despite the contribution of
advanced of imaging. The isolated localization of the hydatid cyst in the
pelvis is rare and can even mimic a tumour process. Preoperative diag-
nosis is difficult due to non-specific clinical and radiological features.
Therefore, the hydatidosis must always be present in mind when dealing
with cyst pelvic formation especially in endemic areas.

Diagnostic challenges in pathology: the value of the second opinion
A. Hmidi*, F. Khanchel, I. Helal, M. Ben Thayer, E. Ben Brahim, A.
Chadli-Debbiche
*Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The goal of pathologic examination is to
provide accurate and specific diagnoses. However, the diagnosis is not
always obvious; the pathologist may seek advice from an expert. The aim
of this study was to view the value of second opinion (SO).
Methods: We retrospectively included all SO in the Pathology de-
partment of Habib-Thameur hospital over a three-year period. The
submitted and matched SO reports were reviewed to extract clinical
and pathologic data, the diagnostic hypotheses, and the additional
investigations. Each diagnosis was reviewed to determine if there
was agreement, minor disagreement, or major disagreement between
the original and the SO.
Virchows Arch
Results: We included 21 consecutive pathology consultation requests.
The most common diagnostic categories sent for SO were: lymphoid
proliferation (15 cases), inflammatory dermatoses (3 cases), melanomas
(1 case), skin tumours (1 case), and undifferentiated tumours (1 case). In
13 cases, further investigations by a panel of antibodies or molecular
studies were necessary to establish the diagnosis. In our series, there
was an agreement between the initial and the SO in three cases. In 14
cases, there was a difference in diagnostic opinion. Minor disagreements
occurred in 10 cases and major disagreements in 4 cases. However, the
diagnosis has remained difficult, even for the expert, in four cases.
Conclusion: This study supports the positive impact of SO, especially, in
lymphoid pathology and skin proliferations. These tumours are charac-
terized by their polymorphism and complexity. In other cases, the re-
course to a SO is justified by a lack of means such as immunohistochem-
ical or molecular studies. However, some rare complex cases remain
difficult to interpret even for experts. The SO can be accompanied by a
delay of response that should be understandable by both the treating
physician and the patient.

Benign lymphoepithelial cyst in retroperitoneal region: a case report
A. Ieronymaki*, P. Tziakou, K. Bourantas, S. Polyzonis, C. Moutsos, V.
Kollaras, E. Papakonstantinou
*Pathology Department, Thriasio General Hospital of Elefsina, Greece
Background & objectives: Lymphoepithelial cyst is an extremely rare
non neoplastic true cyst of unknown pathogenesis.
It is lined by squamous epithelium with underlying abundant lymphoid
tissue. A few cases are noted in the literature, most of them in the
pancreas.
Methods: We present a rare case of a large lymphoepithelial cyst located
in the retroperitoneum. A 64-year-old woman underwent colectomy one
year ago. The diagnosis was colorectal adenocarcinoma. During follow
up, CT scan revealed a retroperitoneal mass, measuring 6x7x5cm near the
pelvic vessels.
Results: Macroscopically the tumour was cystic, round, well demarcated
with cheesy keratin-containing material. Under microscope the cyst was
lined by squamous epithelium, with a dense band of lymphoid tissue
underneath it.
Conclusion: Lymphoepithelial cyst is difficult to diagnose preoperative-
ly. Preoperative fine needle aspiration cytology may help in the diagnosis.
Lymphoepithelial cyst does not recur or progress and is not associated
with immunosuppression or autoimmune diseases.

Factors affecting turnaround time for cervical biopsy and LEEP for
high-grade squamous precursor lesions
M. Kinloch*, H. Eckel
*University of Saskatchewan, Canada
Background & objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate
the impact of age and distance to a tertiary care centre on the turnaround
time between preliminary biopsy and definitive management for cervical
pre-cancerous lesions.
Methods: Women undergoing LEEP procedures 01/01/17 - 31/12/18
were reviewed (n = 290). Age, patient diagnosis, date of biopsy, surgical
date and patient address were collected. Patients were categorized into six
Home IDs based on distance to tertiary centre; Turnaround time was
calculated using date of biopsy and LEEP procedure. The relationship
of age and distance were analysed using linear regression.
Results: 225 patients met criteria. Age plurality was under 30 (93, 41%),
the 30-40 years (82, 37%) and over 40 (50, 22%). Mean distance to
tertiary care was 60 km and the relationship between distance to a tertiary
care and turnaround time was not statistically significant (p=0.535). Age
was statistically significant with turnaround time decreasing by 1.36 days
for each year of increasing age (p = 0.003). Mean turnaround time of the
most populous group (age ≤30) was 58 days. Age groups and their
respective turnaround times were as follows: 30 ≤age < 40 = 38.41 days
(p = 0.018), age > 40 = 26.53 days (p = 0.001).
Conclusion: There are no guidelines benchmarking turnaround times for
cervical biopsy to LEEP follow-up. We must engage clinicians to uncov-
er if this data is meaningful. This is especially important in younger
patients as age is highly related to turnaround time. Furthermore,
patient-oriented research uncovering the barriers present in the younger
population (kids, lack of transportation, inflexible work) would identify
variable-specific interventions to improve access for our younger, and
most represented population. This could then be reflected in the quality
turnaround times.

Cyclic nitroxides as a potential compound for detection of redox state
changes in cocaine related intoxication. A basic point in a one future
method
I. Koleva*, Y. Karamalakova, N. Vlaeva, K. Benkova, I. Koleva, E.
Georgieva
*Medical Faculty, Trakia University, Bulgaria
Background & objectives: Cocaine, metabolites norcocaine and
norcocaine derivatives play a significant role in cocaine-relited toxicity.
The mechanism involves the induction of oxidative stress and generation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are the main reasons for the
induction of irreversible pathological changes.
Methods: We are considering a new potential methodology of ROS deter-
mination in patient blood samples by using EPR-X-Band (Bruker ER 116
DS) and 0.1mM, 0.5 mM and 1M solutions of stable cyclic nitroxide: 4-
Hydroxy-TEMPO, 4-oxo -TEMPO and 3-Carboxy-PROXYL in oxidase /
reduce form. The value of EPR-signal intensity will be measured directly at
different time intervals in freshly isolated blood samples.
Results: Characteristic of cocaine intoxication is the formation of an
unusual redox pair in the form of nitroxide-hydroxylamine, which is
considered the main source of ROS. Aromatic cyclic nitroxides are suit-
able spin probes for ROS analysis and changes in redox status in vitro
after drug intoxication. In order to determine the potential application of
nitroxide radicals in the monitoring of drug intoxication, studies with
conventional tests to analyse ROS levels will be performed and the results
will be compared with EPR analysis.
Conclusion: The reactive oxygen species generation, toxic metabolites
formation and oxidative stress play a significant role in cardiovascular,
hepatic and neurotoxicity of cocaine. In this review we draw basic points
for developing a rapid and effective method for detection of redox state
change in a human body in cocaine intoxication cases.

Are your biohealthcare/biomedical vocational training students
aware of the pathology use cases?
F. Leiva-Cepas*, T. Caro Cuenca, A. Sanz Zorrilla, R. Ortega Salas
*University Hospital "Reina Sofía", Spain
Background & objectives: Pathology is a medical specialty that offers
health results in a transversal way between specialties. The objective is to
evaluate the degree of knowledge that graduates in branches of Health
Sciences have on aspects related to the AP specialty.
Methods: A questionnaire was developed with 20 items. The question-
naire was answered by 223 students who visited the Pathology Unit as
Virchows Arch
part of their training (186 w, 37 m). The different items were evaluated
using a Likert-type scale, based on the consideration that each student had
about the item. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t test.
Results: 19% of those surveyed had previous training on biosanitary
laboratories. 48% had heard the word pathology before. 84% had a moth-
er who was not engaged in health activities and 71% a father. 82% of the
students did not know how a clinical autopsy differs from a judicial and
73% considered that a coroner and a pathologist perform the same type of
autopsy. 19% of the students did not consider AP a specialty at the same
level as Cardiology or Family Medicine.
Conclusion: The results obtained must have their implication to make the
specialty reach the health field more and better and the students to show
the academic and professional excellence of Pathology.

Teach pathology through threshold concepts. Preliminary study
F. Leiva-Cepas*, M.J. Gálvez-Medina, T. Sánchez Medianero, R. Ortega
Salas
*University Hospital "Reina Sofía", Spain
Background & objectives: A threshold concept (TC) is the fundamental
nucleus that endows the student with a lasting, deep and functional
knowledge. The objective is to identify and analyse the perception that
undergraduate students in Medicine about TC in Pathology.
Methods: Questionnaire with 35 items with 3 three sections was an-
swered. 155 undergraduate students in Medicine, (109 w & 43 m). The
different items were evaluated by means of a Likert-type scale (1-5) on
their consideration of each CT in pathology. Statistical analysis was per-
formed with Student's t test comparing the values by gender and the
differences between the different sections.
Results: The most valued concepts were those in the tissue injury section
(4.7 / 5) and biopsy (4.6 / 5). In the section of neoplastic pathology with a
score of 4.3 / 5 and clinical autopsy with 3.9 / 5. 60% of the students were
unaware of the term TC. 45% of the students did not consider AP as
fundamental for the exercise of the medical profession.
Conclusion: The differences observed must be taken into account in the
organization in the teaching programming of the Pathology subject and in
the entire Medicine degree, to guarantee an autonomous learning process
based on specific competencies.

M. Mlika*, F. Sassi, B. Imen, S. Ben Cheikh, R. Ayadi, E. Braham, O.
Ismail, F. Mezni
*Abderrahman mami hospital, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Synovial sarcoma (SS) is mainly located in
soft tissues and accounts for 5 to 10% of all sarcomas. Primary mediastinal
localization is exceptional. Our aim was to describe the clinical, microscop-
ic and diagnostic characteristics of the primary mediastinal localization.
Methods: we describe a retrospective study of 3 primary synovial sarco-
mas of the mediastinum diagnosed during a 6 year-period (2006-2021).
Results: We describe the cases of 2 women and 1 man (sex ratio de 1/2)
with a mean age of 41.6 years. Chest pain was the most frequent symp-
tom. Radiologic findings consisted in a mediastinal enlargement in all
cases. CT-scan revealed a mediastinal mass in all cases evoking a
haemangioma in 1 patient. Microscopic diagnosis was performed on a
surgical mediastinal biopsy in 2 cases and a pleural biopsy in 1 case. The
diagnosis of a monomorphic synovial sarcoma was retained in 2 cases
and biphasic synovial sarcoma in 1 case. Cytogenetic findings concluded
to the presence of a t(x,18) translocation in all cases.
Conclusion: Primary mediastinal synovial sarcoma is exceptional.
Positive diagnosis necessitates the correlation of microscopic and clinical
findings in order to rule out other diagnoses consisting mainly in a sec-
ondary mediastinal localization of a SS

Sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation of the spleen clini-
cally recognized as "splenic haemangioma": a case report
K. Petrov*, I. Ivanov, M. Karaivanov
*Medical University Pleven, Bulgaria
Background & objectives: Sclerosing angoimatoid transformation of
the spleen (SANT) is a rare disease, first introduced by Martel et al.
Less than 200 cases are reported in the literature.
SANT is nodular vascular proliferation of the red pulp without any signs
of malignancy.
Methods: We report a case of 57 y.o. female patient, diagnosed clinically
with splenic haemangioma by CT.
Abdominal ultrasonography showed heterogeneous formation in upper
part of the spleen.
Thepatienthasapastmedicalhistoryofhysterectomyforuterineleiomyoma.
Laboratory parameters were normal.
Laparoscopic splenectomy was performed. The tissue specimen was sub-
mitted for macroscopic and histological evaluation.
Results: A rounded, lobulated mass measuring - 45/55/50 mm in size was
identified. It was with focal haemorrhages and harder than surrounding
parenchyma.
H&E and VG stains showed fibrotic multinodular formation with central
small vessels of different types, focal haemorrhages and scattered inflam-
matory infiltrate.
By IHC the vascular structures showed different positivity for CD31,
CD34 and CD8.
Conclusion: Sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation of the
spleen (SANT) is rare vascular lesion in most cases without any clinical
presentation. SANT is often diagnosed incidentally and mimic other
spleen tumours, in particular haemangiomas.
In these cases splenectomy is curative.
Follow-up of the patients with SANT does not show malignant transfor-
mation of these vascular lesions.

Retrorectal epidermoid cyst in a pregnant woman: a case report and
a review of literature on a rare entity
A.P. Rodrigues*, N.J. Lamas, A. Coelho
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário do Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Retrorectal cysts are a rare entity with strong
female predominance. Most of retrorectal cysts are congenital develop-
mental cysts (epidermoid, dermoid, and enteric). The rarity of these le-
sions and their nonspecific clinical presentation often lead to misdiagno-
ses and inappropriate operations.
Methods: A 33-year-old woman with pelvic pain performed an ultra-
sound on emergency evaluation context that revealed a twin pregnancy
and a retrorectal hypoechoic cystic mass. She then underwent a MRI
examination that showed a neoformation compressing the rectus and in
close relation with spinal merging nerve roots, suggesting a solid mesen-
chymal neoplasm. A fine-needle biopsy revealed scant keratin scales.
Results: In multidisciplinary consultation it was decided to wait until the
term of pregnancy to perform trans-sacral tumour resection, due to the
absence of aggressive features. Then, we received the surgical resection
specimen, which consisted of an unilocular cyst with 198g and
8,5x8x6cm with smooth lining containing a whitish soft material.
Additionally, we also received the coccyx in continuity with the distal
portion of the fifth sacral vertebra. The histopathological examination
shows a cystic lesion with fibromuscular wall lined by a bland stratified
squamous epithelium with granular layer containing laminated keratin,
consistent with the diagnosis of a development cyst, epidermoid-type.
Conclusion: There are no complications resulting from the surgery and
the pelvic pain subsided. Retrorectal cysts are a rare entity that can be
difficult to diagnose due to nonspecific clinical findings and difficult
Virchows Arch
radiological differential diagnosis. A malignant degeneration of these
tumours was exceptionally described in the literature. The surgical treat-
ment must be performed to treat the symptoms and for a correct diagnosis
of the nature of the lesion.

A case report of a tumour-to-tumour metastasis diagnosed on fine
needle biopsy
S. Stifter*, M.E. Kristensen, C. Stilling
*Department of Pathology, University Hospital Aarhus, Denmark
Background & objectives: A case report documenting tumour-to-
tumour metastasis of invasive ductal breast carcinoma in a primary renal
neoplasm. A 83 old woman had been admitted to the urology clinic upon
computed tomography (CT) imaging of the abdomen and pelvis.
Methods: CT revealed a 7x6 cm solid enhancing mass from the lateral
aspect of the r/l kidney, suspicious for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) togeth-
er with subcutaneous nodular lesions on upper extremities. She was treat-
ed 18 years earlier for invasive ductal breast carcinoma and currently was
under oncological surveillance.
Results: Using the guided fine needle biopsy (FNB), 3 FNB from renal mass
and 2 FNB from subcutaneous nodules were obtained. Pathohistologically,
tumour tissue was detected in all samples. In subcutis FNB a metastatic breast
cancer, and a clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CC RCC) (ISUP grade 2) was
diagnosed in each of 3 samples obtained from the kidney. Simultaneously
were also small, histologically distinct tumour areas visible in kidney samples
raising suspicion for the presence of another tumour tissue incorporated in CC
RCC. Immunohistochemical analysis (ICH) confirmed the suspicion and
distinct ICH malignant tumour profiles were determined. Upon these
pathohistological findings, the tumour was classified as a collision tumour.
Conclusion: The collision tumours are rare findings; providing important
additional information on a particular tumour’s biology. Usually, a recip-
ient tumour presents a less aggressive phenotype amplifying the donor
tumour re-seeding easily.
In the circumstances when clinical consensus management of primary
renal neoplasms indicates, pathological diagnosis is limited by the meth-
odology of acquisition and prone to sampling error. Therefore, we point
out that despite applied methodology this rare diagnosis was determined
being to our knowledge, the first reported finding of such pathology.

Congenital high airway obstruction syndrome – report of two foetal
autopsies
V. Almeida*, A. Lai, J. Madeira, C. Cerdeira, R. Pina
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Centro Hospitalar e Universtário de
Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Congenital high airway obstruction syndrome
(CHAOS) is a rare and usually lethal malformation, mainly caused by la-
ryngeal atresia. We present the autopsy findings of two 2nd trimester foe-
tuseswithCHAOScausedbytracheaatresiaandsevereinfraglotticstenosis.
Methods: Foetus A and B were respectively the first and second children
of non-consanguineous healthy couples. Both were otherwise uncompli-
cated pregnancies. Second-trimester ultrasound revealed, in both cases, a
hydropic foetus with bilateral enlarged hyperechogenic lungs, prominent
bronchial tree and trachea, and inverted diaphragm. The findings were
characteristic of CHAOS and after genetic counselling both couples opted
for termination of pregnancy.
Results: Foetus A, a 17-weeks male, had micrognathia, low-set ears and
bilateral clubfoot. We confirmed hydrops fetalis and the diaphragm
inversion. The heart was vertical, entrapped between augmented lungs,
histologically diffusely microcystic with an adenomatoid appearance.
There was a cul-de-sac interruption immediately below the larynx, and
histology sections showed a complete absence of the upper trachea, with
downstream segment dilatation.
Foetus B, a 24-weeks female, was unfortunately severely damaged by the
extraction, compromising gross examination. We found hypertelorism
and nasal hypoplasia. Lungs were heavy, 150% above the normal value.
There was a severe luminal narrowing at the infraglottic larynx, con-
firmed on histology.
Conclusion: CHAOS is typically diagnosed on sonography based on
detection of secondary alterations to upper airway obstruction.
However, the specific cause of obstruction is not easily determined on
imaging. We present two CHAOS cases in which autopsy established the
exact obstruction cause: trachea atresia and severe infraglottic stenosis,
both rare CHAOS causes. Moreover, autopsy detected anomalies unre-
lated to airway obstruction, whose reports are necessary to provide a
better insight into this unusual malformation.

Malformed foetus due to a genetic disorder-rare case with Ring chro-
mosome 14 syndrome
A. Barbis-Vesa*, O. Pop, M. Boros, A. Pascalau, E. Popescu, G. Stefanet
*1. Department of Morphological Disciplines, Faculty of Medicine and
Pharmacy Oradea, University of Oradea; 2. Department of Pathology,
County Clinical Emergency Hospital Oradea, Romania
Background & objectives: In the majority of cases, the causes of intra-
uterine death remain unknown despite detailed evaluation.
Approximately 25% of neonatal/stillbirths have been attributed to chro-
mosomal abnormalities. Ring 14 chromosome damage is associated with
a number of frequent severe signs and symptoms.
Methods: A 35-year-old pregnant women was admitted at the
Emergency Department due to premature rupture of the membranes. At
the ultrasound there were signs of foetal distress plus multiple abnormal-
ities seen like clinodactyly, polydactyly, craniofacial dysmorphism, mul-
tiple and variable malformations (nervous, digestive, cardio-circulatory,
genital, renal). Delivery was performed through a caesarean section, with
an Apgar score of 3/4.
Results: The baby died after 3 hours from birth due to severe respiratory
failure. From the data provided by the mother we found genetic tests were
performed with the diagnose of deletion of the long arm of chromosome
14, with major consequences on the nervous system. At the autopsy
multiple malformations were noted, in almost every major system: bilat-
eral anophthalmia, large low inserted ears, thin lips with downwardly
turned corners of the mouth, high palate, polydactyly and clinodactyly,
microcephaly, large anterior fontanelle (4/3 cm), partial hypoplasia of the
cerebellar vermis, tetralogy of Fallot, megacolon, imperforated anus,
bicornuate uterus, dysplastic right kidney with multiple cysts.
Conclusion: In the case of a foetus with multiple malformations, it is
imperative to perform a genetic test to expose the subsequent risks of pos-
sible mutations. Ring chromosomes are rare abnormalities, most of the time
of de novo origin, presenting a different phenotype according to the loss of
genetic material and genetic instability. Clinically, the ring 14 syndrome is
characterized by a recognizable phenotype of shortness of stature, distinc-
tive facial appearance, microcephaly and ocular abnormalities.

Tailgut cyst in a child: a very rare case report
A. Bellalah*, S. Frini, N. Ben Abdeljelil, M. Njima, S. Mabrouk, L. Njim,
A. Zakhama, R. Hadhri
*Department of Pathology, Chu Fattouma Bourguiba Monastir, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Tailgut cyst or retrorectal cystic hamartoma
(TGC) is a rare congenital anomaly in the presacral space, believed to
Virchows Arch
arise from the tailgut embryonic remnants. The inconstant anatomical
location and the clinical presentation being mostly asymptomatic, make
the TGC frequently underdiagnosed.
Methods: We report a case of a 2-year-old girl diagnosed with TCG in
the Department of Pathology of the University Hospital of Monastir and
we describe its histological features.
Results: A 2-year-old girl presented with a sacral swelling growing for
over 6 months. She had no other symptoms. Physical examination and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of a 10 cm
cyst in the pre-sacrococcygeal space and a resection was done.
Histological examination of the resected specimen concluded to the di-
agnosis of TGC. It presented as a cyst lined by a mucinous columnar
epithelium. The cystic space contain mucinous material. Its wall was
composed of disorganized adipocytic tissue and smooth muscle cells
surrounded by lymphoid follicles. The postoperative course was unevent-
ful, with no recurrence of the mass on the MRI, performed 6 months after
the surgery.
Conclusion: TCG is a congenital lesion usually diagnosed in adult patients
and rarely detected in infants. Due to its retrorectal space, the diagnosis can
be difficult to distinguish from an inflammatory process or other differential
diagnosis such as primary tumours of neurogenic or osteogenic origin. A
close follow-up is advisable as TCG could be associated to a malignant
tumours that can show disease progression even after surgery.

New-born with left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy
P.M. Bueno Ortiz*, M. González Afonso, I. González Villa, C.
Montecino Romani, E. Linares Martín, L. León Arencibia
*Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular Materno Infantil, Las
Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain
Background & objectives: Left ventricular non-compaction cardiomy-
opathy is a persistence of abnormal foetal myocardium and is a rare cause
of cardiomyopathy characterised by hypertrabeculation, thin compacted
layer, and deep inter-trabecular recesses, commonly hypothesized due to
an arrest in compaction during foetal development.
Methods: We present the case of a 35-week-old gestational age new-
born with anaemia, thrombocytopenia, gastroschisis and left hyper-
trophic myocardiopathy, feature that was seen by cardiovascular res-
onance imaging, and who died one day after because of refractory
hypoxemia. We received this new-born in our pathology department
as an autopsy.
Results: When we dissected the heart we saw hypertrophy of both ven-
tricles, as well as a lot of trabeculations in myocardium of left ventricle
apex. Histologically, we saw many thin muscular trabeculations with
deep inter-trabecular recess, with blood between them and with the com-
pact layer separating the muscular trabeculations from the epicardium
reduced in thickness.
Because of this features, we made the diagnosis of left ventricule non-
compaction cardiomyopathy with hypertrophic myocardiopathy of both
ventricles.
Conclusion: Left ventricle non-compaction myocardiopathy is a rare
disease with an estimated incidence of 0.12 per 100.000 in children up
to 10 years of age, that can be associated with other cardiac abnormalities
and diverse syndromes, ordering for genetic counselling. It may present in
the neonatal period with cardiac failure or with sudden death, although
other cases may not present until later in life. Affected alive individuals
are at risk of left ventricular failure, life-threatening arrhythmias and
cardio-embolism.

Pentalogy of Cantrell: an autopsy case report of a complete phenotype
P. Canão*, J. Dos Santos, A. Grangeia, C. Ramalho, A. Costa Braga
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São
João, Portugal
Background & objectives: Pentalogy of Cantrell (POC) is a rare congen-
ital condition classically involving defects of the lower sternum, anterior
diaphragm, supraumbilical abdominal wall, pericardium and intracardiac
anomalies. Our goal is to report a new case with review of the literature.
Methods: An autopsy from a nonviable 13 weeks’ gestation foetus was
performed, with previous diagnosis of a large omphalocele with liver
protrusion at 11 weeks. External and internal post-mortem examinations,
including stereomicroscopic examination for dissection, were conducted.
Histological evaluation of tissue sections, analysis of the foetus’ skeleton
and foetal aneuploidy screening followed by copy number variation
(CNV) analysis were performed.
Results: The autopsy showed a male foetus with growth and maturation
parameters suitable for gestational age. A lower defect of sternum, ante-
rior diaphragmatic and midline supraumbilical abdominal wall defects,
associated to a diaphragmatic pericardial defect, ectopia “cordis” and
pulmonary atresia were identified. Exteriorization of abdominal organs
(liver, stomach, intestine, pancreas and spleen) was observed across the
abdominal defect. Foetal aneuploidy screening and CNV analysis by
array comparative genomic hybridization were normal. Placental exami-
nation revealed acute deciduitis, morphological aspects suggestive of
placenta detachment and hypercoiling of the umbilical cord.
Conclusion: Our case shows a nonviable 13-week-old male foetus with
focus on a full expression of the POC, a rare condition of a large spectrum
phenotype. With this case we intend to review the POC spectrum condi-
tion and reinforce the importance of the autopsy examination for defini-
tive diagnosis.

The importance of histopathology in the diagnosis of a fulminant
autoimmune hepatitis of a young child
L. Chinezu*, A. Sin
*UMFST Tirgu Mures, Romania
Background & objectives: A minority of patients with acute-onset of the
autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) present with acute liver failure. Usually, the
aetiology is difficult to established. Our objective was to highlight the
importance of histopathological examination in the diagnosis of a fulmi-
nant AIH.
Methods: We present a case of a 9-month-old girl with complete atrio-
ventricular canal defect (CAVC) and Down syndrome detected during
pregnancy. CAVC repair was done at 4 months of age. She presented
with persistent fever and acute hepatitis negative for specific autoanti-
bodies and with a fulminant course leading to death less than one month
after onset. Total serum gamma-globulins were increased.
Results: Both external and internal autopsy observations were evaluated.
The examination of the liver revealed portal mononuclear cell inflamma-
tory infiltrate extending into the lobule (interface hepatitis), centrilobular
injury with prominent hepatocellular necrosis and lymphoplasmacytic
inflammation. These histopathological features were associated with mas-
sive multilobular necrosis and areas of severe piecemeal necrosis. Other
examined organs revealed no evident or suggestive pathological features.
Conclusion: The acute-onset AIH can resemble an acute viral or toxic
hepatitis. The histopathology is needed for an early diagnosis and an early
immunosuppressive therapy. The correct histopathological diagnosis in
AIH needs a detailed clinical history, a biopsy request form and a clinico-
pathological correlation.

Ewing sarcoma displaying extensive ganglioneuroblastomatous
differentiation
N. Comunoglu*, S. Ocak, R. Özcan, C. Comunoglu
*IU-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical F, Turkey
Background & objectives: A rare case of Ewing Sarcoma displaying
extensive ganglioneuroblastomatous differentiation is presented.
Virchows Arch
Methods: A nine-year-old female patient presented with back pain and
difficulty in walking. MRI revealed a paraspinal mass lesion located at the
level of thoracic vertebrae 8. The lesion was completely resected.
Results: The tumour was histopathologically a small round cell tumour
however showed extensive ganglioneuroblastomatous differentiation
areas. We have given a diagnosis of a ganglioneuroblastoma, intermixed
type. Because the tumour did not respond oncologic medical therapy
sufficiently, reoperation was performed. The small round cell component
was more prominent in this specimen. Immunohistochemically tumour
was positive for CD99 and NKX2.2 in the round cell component.
Molecular analysis revealed EWSR1/FLI fusion. The pathological diag-
nosis is renewed as “Ewing Sarcoma Displaying Extensive
Ganglioneuroblastomatous Differentiation”.
Conclusion: Ganglioneuroblastomatous differentiation in Ewing
Sarcoma is exceedingly rare. In this presented case ganglioneuroma com-
ponent was extensive. Recognition of this phenomenon in Ewing
Sarcoma cases may prevent a possible misinterpretation and a failure in
oncologic treatment.

Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease: case report and
literature review

Melgar Rivera, L. Naranjo Ruiz-Atienza, S. Ramón y Cajal-Agüeras, J.
Camacho Soriano
*Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Spain
Background & objectives: Cushing’s syndrome (CS) in paediatric pop-
ulation is adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent in 80% of
cases and ACTH-independent in 20% mostly due to primary hyperplasia
or adenomas of the adrenal glands, and very rarely by primary pigmented
nodular adrenal disease (PPNAD).
Methods: We present the case of a three-year-old girl that was admitted
to our hospital because of obesity, moon-like face, hirsutism and dorsal
hump. Nuclear magnetic resonance showed a diffuse thickening with
slight nodular appearance in both adrenal glands. Liddle test made evi-
dent a paradoxical increase in cortisol. A bilateral adrenalectomy was
performed and sent to our pathology department.
Results: On gross examination, adrenal glands were both enlarged and
had multiple brown nodules measuring between 2 and 8 mm. All the
nodules were located in the adrenal cortex and, microscopically, were
composed of large irregular cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and irreg-
ular hyperchromatic nuclei. Some of these cells contained brown pigment
compatible with lipofuscin in the cytoplasm. Necrosis, atypical mitotic
figures or venous invasion were not found. Nodules showed positivity for
synaptophysin, melan A and inhibint, while HMB45 and S100 were
negative. These features were consistent with PPNAD.
Conclusion: PPNAD is a rare cause of CS that should be known.
PPNAD could be associated with Carney Complex, often accompanied
by mutation of the PRKAR1A gene. PPNAD shows infracentimetric
multiple nodules in both adrenal glands with atypical cells and brown
pigment. The histological differential diagnosis include melanoma and
cortical carcinoma. Medical record, imaging and Liddle test together
with these histological features are crucial to make the diagnosis of this
entity.

Congenital heart malformations (CHM) – a foetal autopsy highlight
C. Dahlstedt-Ferreira*, P. Sequeira, H. Oliveira Coelho
*Hospital Garcia de Orta, EPE, Portugal
Background & objectives: CHM are an important cause of childhood
mortality and the most common congenital abnormality. Foetal heart
evaluation is a reproducible exam although with limitations (smallness
of the foetal heart, high heart rate and limited foetal access).
Methods: We present an autopsy case report of a 36-week-old female
foetus that died in utero. The pregnant was 33 years old, without relevant
medical or obstetric background. At 20 weeks, gestational age, there was
difficult ultra-sonogram visualization of the foetal heart structures, al-
though apparently normal.
Results: The foetus had anthropometrical parameters compatible with
36-week-old gestation. No external malformations were found. The
heart dissection found a 3mm interventricular communication and
complex structural cardiac malformations. The pulmonary artery
exited from the right ventricle, although, the posterior wall had two
ostia which originated the left and right branches and another supe-
rior ostium, that communicated with the aortic arch. The aorta
emerged and branched as usually till the emerging of the left subcla-
vian artery, where it became atretic and communicated with the pul-
monary artery, which turned out to be a systemic vessel and curved
down into the remaining thorax and abdomen. No other
malformations were described.
Conclusion: CHM are the most common congenital abnormality, either
isolated or in association with other foetal anomalies. We present a case
report of a foetus with a complex cardiac structural malformation that
didn’t fit into a syndromic diagnosis and wasn’t detected during the preg-
nancy due to the foetal cardiac ultrasonography limitations. Autopsy still
remains an important tool to the final diagnosis, and to clarifying future
management into similar cases.

Prune-belly syndrome: an autopsy case report
J. Dos Santos*, P. Canão, A. Grangeia, C. Ramalho, A. Costa Braga
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Hospital Pedro Hispano (ULSM),
Portugal
Background & objectives: Prune-belly syndrome (PBS) is a rare con-
genital condition characterized by deficient/ absent abdominal muscula-
ture and urinary tract abnormalities, cryptorchidism in males or genital
abnormalities in females. Our goal is to report a new case with review of
the literature.
Methods: An autopsy from an 18 weeks’ pregnancy submitted to termi-
nation due to anhydramnios, hydrops and megacystis, was performed.
External and internal post-mortem examinations, including stereomicro-
scopic examination for dissection, were conducted. Histological evalua-
tions of tissue sections, analyses of the foetus’ skeleton and genetic testing
by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) were performed.
The placenta was submitted for examination.
Results: The autopsy showed a male foetus with growth and maturation
parameters suitable for gestational age. Hydrops and marked abdominal
distension were observed, associated with bladder distention, thin abdom-
inal wall, showing areas of muscle atrophy, bladder neck and distal urethra
stenosis. Broad flat nose, low set ears, microretrognathia, clubfeet and
pulmonary hypoplasia were identified. Additionally, cardiac examination
showed an atrial septal defect (ostium secundum). Testis were located in the
abdominal cavity, as expected at this age. aCGH in foetal DNA was
normal.
Conclusion: Our autopsy case shows a 18-week-old male foetus with
findings consistent with PBS. Cardiovascular malformations as the atrial
septal defect and hydrops may also be found in association to PBS,
although less frequently. The other features described are secondary to
anhydramnios - Potter’s sequence – in this context of PBS. With this case
we intend to review the PBS condition and reinforce the importance of the
autopsy examination for definitive diagnosis.

A fatal extensive plexiform neurofibroma in a new-born
Y. Fejji*, N. Abdessayed, Z. Nfikha, A. Bchir, A. Ben Daly, S. Chaieb,
R. Sanogo, M. Mokni
*Department of Pathology, Farhat Hached hospital, Tunisia
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Plexiform neurofibroma represents an un-
common variant of Neurofibromatosis type 1 in which neurofibromas
arise from multiple nerves as bulging and deforming masses, also involv-
ing connective tissue and skin folds. Plexiform neurofibromas have rarely
been reported in the neonatal age group.
Methods: We received a 70-day-old infant for diagnostic autopsy. He
was born by vaginal delivery at term. The pregnancy was not followed-
up. There was no known family history suggestive of neurofibromatosis
1. On neonatal examination, he presents a congenital glaucoma with
bilateral exophthalmia and right submandibular mass rapidly growing
leading to death.
Results: At autopsy, the infant weighed 3870 grams. His size measured
54cm. His face was deformed by a right parieto-temporo-jugo-
mandibular and submaxillary mass measuring 14*6*4cm. The mass
was poorly limited. There was not “café au lait” spots. On dissection,
the mass infiltrated the meninges, the entire pre-retro-tragian and subman-
dibular zone. It also developed in the posterior mediastinum and com-
pressed the aero-digestive tract. The other organs had no apparent
malformations. Histologically, the mass corresponded to a proliferation
with plexiform architecture, formed of nodules resembling the nerve sec-
tions. It was made of spindle cells without any atypia or mitosis, devel-
oping in a myxoid stroma. The tumour cells expressed ps100 and gfap.
Conclusion: Plexiform neurofibromas arise from multiple nerve fascicles
and are frequently deep seated, diffuse and infiltrating. The lesions are
usually congenital and tend to grow most rapidly during childhood and
are common in the head and neck region. Plexiform neurofibromas may
compress the airway or spinal cord and can transform into malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumours. Definitive treatment of plexiform neu-
rofibromas is complete surgical removal which can be challenging and
difficult due to location of the tumour and frequent recurrence.

Umbilical cord tumour of a new-born
H. Goebel*, W. Rommen, M. Ansorge, A. Müller
*University Hospital Cologne, Institute for pathology, Germany
Background & objectives: Umbilical cord tumours are rare findings.
We report a 3 cm measuring umbilical tumour that was surgically excised
together with the umbilical cord. The tumour tissue, macroscopically
resembling liver tissue, was sent for histological analysis.
Methods: Pathological examination of the tumour was performed ac-
cording to local standards.
Results: Case of a prenatally diagnosed umbilical tumour of a new-born
girl gestational age: 37+1weeks.Ultrasoundrevealeda solidmassunrelated
to the abdominal cavity except a single vessel leading to the intestine, and an
umbilical hernia. A hamartoma was suspected. Histologically the specimen
displayed trabecularly arranged hepatoid cells (HepPar1 positive), regular
sinusoids (CD31 positive) and disseminated portal fields with CK7 positive
bile ducts as well as disseminated hematopoietic foci (GLUT-1 pos,
Glycophorin C and MPO pos), concordant with foetal haematopoiesis in
foetal liver tissue. Centrally located was oedematous mesenchymal stroma
with dilated lymphvessels (D2-40), a prominent bloodvessel andencircling
bile ducts, resembling a larger oedematous portal field.
Conclusion: Umbilical cord tumours are mainly angiomyxomas and ter-
atomas. Up to now, only 20 cases of iver tissue in the umbilical cord have
been published. Some of them describe the complete liver being present
within the umbilical cord. Hence in these cases an omphalocele has to be
considered as differential diagnosis. But though our case has features of
an omphalocele as well, liver tissue was located in the wall of the hernia
sac,not within the lumen.

Case of an Ischiopagus-anomaly at the 15th gestational week
M. Eich, H. Goebel*
*University Hospital Cologne, Institute for Pathology, Germany
Background & objectives: We present the case of an Ischiopagus-
anomaly at the 15th gestational week. The female gemini showed joint
lower abdominal organs but separated upper abdominal and thoracal or-
gans. The cause of the intrauterine death was a intervillous hematoma of
the placenta.
Methods: Autopsy and histopathology was done according to standard
protocols.
Results: The gemini were attached in a 90° angle towards each other.
Radiologically they had a commune pelvic bone, two frontally oriented
legs and a third rudimentary leg pointing dorsally. Each geminus had only
one arm but completely separate vertebral columns and their respective
lungs were regularly shaped. One heart showed a single ventricle and
tricuspid valve atresia the other was unremarkable. There were seperate
stomachs and smaller intestines but a common large bowel. Each foetus
showed their own unremarkable kidney-and adrenal pairs plus ureters
entering a common urinary bladder. There was also a common liver,
pancreas, large bowel, inner genital female organs and anus. Death was
related to placental problems.
Conclusion: Conjoined twins are a very rare occurrence without a specific
cause of origine. Possible reasons for development are an initially disturbed
separation of the embryonic disc or a fusion of initially separate embryonic
discs. Ischiopagi – as described here – are the rarest group within the feature
of conjoined situations. Typically one of the gemini may show anomalies
as was the case here with one foetus presenting with a vitium cordis. Cause
of the intrauterine death an placental intervillous hematoma.

Multiple cancers on a family with Li Fraumeni Syndrome: case
report
I. Güvendikli*, E. Mercan Demirtaş, T. Eren, Ü.N. Başaran, H. Gürkan,
F. Öz Puyan
*Trakya University Faculty of Medicine, Turkey
Background & objectives: Li Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a rare
autosomal-dominant familial cancer syndrome characterized by germline
TP53 mutations and early-onset cancers. Sarcoma, breast cancer, leukae-
mia, brain cancer, and adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) are the most
frequently seen cancers in LFS.
Methods: A 14-year-old female patient was diagnosed with
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) 12 years ago and was treated for it. The same
patient was diagnosed with osteosarcoma of the iliac wing three years ago.
Her little brother is a 12-year-old male patient. He was admitted to the hos-
pitalwithasolidmassinhisleftabdomen,andhewasdiagnosedwith(ACC).
Results: A female patient who received radiotherapy for bladder-derived
embryonal RMS was diagnosed with osteosarcoma eight years later where-
as her brother was diagnosed with ACC the same year. The familial genetic
analysis was performed germline TP53 mutation was found in both sib-
lings. A year ago in the girl's follow-up, a pulmonary lesion was detected,
and her biopsy showed primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma. She received
surgical treatment without chemotherapy. Liver and lung metastases that
developed within 1 year were detected in the brother who was hospitalized
three years ago because of a left abdominal mass and was diagnosed with
ACC by biopsy. The boy underwent metastasectomy, and he is currently
receiving postoperative chemotherapy.
Conclusion: LFS is a hereditary cancer syndrome that produces disorga-
nized tumour suppressor protein P53. LFS should be evaluated together
with family history and approached in a multidisciplinary manner in the
presence of more than one tumour.

Childhood eosinophilic esophagitis in children: a report of a case and
literature review
A. Hassine*, A. Bdioui, E. Ben Amou, A. Ben Mabrouk, Z. Lajmi, H.
Hamchi, S. Hmissa
*Sahloul Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Eosinophilic esophagitis(EE) is a recent pa-
thology defined by abnormal immune response of the oesophageal mu-
cosa to exogenous allergens, leading to chronic and intense mucosa in-
filtration by 15 eosinophils per High-Power-Field (Eos/HPF). We report
an observation of OE in a child.
Methods: An 8-year-old male child with no notable surgical/ medical
history, in particular no known allergies or growth disturbances, has
consulted for chronic vomiting without other associated signs. Clinical
examination did not reveal any abnormalities. The biological assessment
was correct. He underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy which
doesn’t found any lesions. Systematic, staged oesophageal biopsies were
performed.
Results: Histologically, the specimen was lined by squamous, regular
epithelium, with morphologically normal nuclei, non-dysplastic or meta-
plastic, massively infiltrated by numerous eosinophilic polynuclear cells.
Thus, the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis was retained.
Conclusion: Few studies have focused on this rare entity, which still
poses a diagnostic and therapeutic problem. It seems essential to stan-
dardize practices in order to better understand this pathology and improve
its management. The place of new diagnostic markers remains to be
clarified.

Malignant rhabdoid tumour of the liver - morphological character-
istics of biopsy, primary resection and post-chemotherapy specimens
in two cases
E. Iżycka-Świeszewska*, P. Czauderna, H. Garnier, J. Stefanowicz, B.
Lipska-Zietkiewicz, J. Gulczynski, E. Bien
*Medical University of Gdansk, Poland
Background & objectives: Malignant rhabdoid tumour (MRT) is a very
rare hepatic tumour in infants that have an aggressive clinical behaviour.
It can create diagnostic problems in tumour biopsy because of its heter-
ogenous histological picture.
Methods: The patho-clinical description with detailed morphological
analysis of two hepatic MRT cases are presented. The examined material
in case 1 consisted of primary biopsy, surgical biopsy after 1st line che-
motherapy and tumour resection after 2nd line chemo, and in case 2-
biopsy, and primary tumour resection material. Wide
immunophenotyping including INI1 was performed.
Results: In case 1 the biopsy contained the reactive liver tissue made of
clear cells and only two fragments of small cell tumour up to 0.5 mm and
was erroneously diagnosed as hepatoblastoma foetal type. Post 1st- line
chemotherapy surgical biopsy showed MRT made of small cell and more
typical rhabdoid pattern. Post 2nd line chemotherapy tumour resection
showed pleomorphic focally multinucleated cellular partim myxoid ma-
lignancy. In case 2 the biopsy was very limited and inconclusive, the
tumour underwent primary resection, showing complex histology with
evident rhabdoid population. The immunophenotype was heterogenous
with consistent INI1 loss of expression.
Conclusion: MRT of the liver because of its rarity can cause diagnostic
difficulties and therapeutic problems. Biopsy material from these infantile
tumours can be very limited and non- representative. Post- chemotherapy
changes within MRT can show pleomorphic mixed morphology. INI1
loss is the basic marker of this entity in the context of other
immunoprofile elements.

Inverted Meckel’s diverticulum: an unexpected microscopic diagno-
sis involving a child
Z. Stamou, I. Kotsikogianni, K. Angeliki, G. Georgiou, K. Kekempanou*
*Agios Andreas General Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Patra, Greece
Background & objectives: Intussusception in children is predominantly
idiopathic (90%). In English literature, few paediatric cases have been
reported to be caused secondary to Meckel’s diverticulum inversion; here
we present one such case revealed unexpectedly during microscopic
examination.
Methods: A 13-year-old boy experienced recurrent abdominal pain of
five-year duration, worsened over the last five months. Ultrasonography
showed spontaneously resolved episodes of intussusceptions. The boy
underwent exploratory laparoscopy. Intraoperative findings included the
identification and reduction of an ileoileal intussusception, 30cm from the
ileocecal valve. Segmental enterectomy was performed. An intraluminal
mass was palpated and considered to be an ileal polyp.
Results: Grossly, a bulb-shaped polyp of 4x3.5x2.9cm, with a thick,
superficially eroded mucosal covering and a fatty core was noted. The
base of the polyp was located on the mesenteric side of the intestinal
mucosa. No defect of the bowel wall was identified. Macroscopically, a
submucosal lipoma was suspected with concern as to the thickness of the
mucosa. The microscopic examination of the polyp revealed a central
core of mature adipose tissue covered sequentially by ectopic gastric
and small bowel mucosa, submucosal and smooth muscle layers. A com-
munication between the mesenterium and the fatty content of the polyp
was microscopically obvious. The final diagnosis of an inverted Meckel's
diverticulum was made.
Conclusion: This case emphasizes the role of exploratory laparoscopy in
paediatric recurrent intussusception. Inverted Meckel’s diverticulum
should not be overlooked as a lead point of intussusception in children,
even when its characteristic features are not identified by imaging tech-
niques and/or macroscopically by the surgeon and pathologist.

Large pulmonary arteriovenous malformation at 25 weeks of gesta-
tional age foetus – a case report
A. Lai*, V. Almeida, O. Rodrigues, C. Cerdeira, R. Pina, L. Carvalho
*Pathology Department, Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Centro
Hospitalar e Universitário Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations
(PAVs) are rare abnormal communications between pulmonary arteries
and veins without capillary-bed complete maturation. Most cases are
congenital.
We present a PAV case diagnosed at 23 week gestational (WG) age with
subsequent autopsy examination and report.
Methods: Prenatal echocardiography showed PAV in the left lung with
increased vascularity of the inferior and medial third of the left
hemithorax and cardiomegaly predominantly in the left heart. After med-
ical termination of pregnancy, the autopsy study was consented.
The general complete autopsy observation show well-formed female foe-
tus, only with internal thoracic malformation.
Results: Examination confirms the prenatal evaluation: dilated and large
left pulmonary artery and left inferior vein; left lower lobe (LLL) was
congestive, with dilated arteries and veins.
On microscope, large vessels have contoured walls and irregular thick-
ness of elastin layers, where artery and vein could be in continuum. LLL
tissue shows septal mesenchyme and irregular apposing capillaries
(CD31) to airspace epithelial cells (CK7), indicating an incomplete or-
ganogenesis: glandular/canalicular phase.
As a first tier genetic study we choose to evaluate the most common
causes of Rendu-Osler-Weber Syndrome (ROWS), but the sequencing
of genes ENG and ACVRL1 didn’t identified any pathogenic or likely
pathogenic variant. The sequencing of GDF2 and SMAD4 is ongoing.
Conclusion: PAVs are usually unilateral, affecting inferior lobes, approx-
imately 70% related with ROWS/10-20% sporadic cases. In our case, the
two most common causes of ROWS (ENG, ACVRL1) didn’t occur.
Study is still ongoing because it’s important for posterior counselling of
the others family members.
Pathological study confirms the diagnosis, shows pulmonary
microvascularization and overall architecture and evaluate associated
Virchows Arch
heart changes. Furthermore, it allows observation of other visceral
malformations.
Early detection allows the correct management in prenatal period,
preventing those serious situations.

Duodenal duplication cyst masked by intussusception – case report
A.A. Nicolau*, F. Enache, G. Baltatescu
*Pathology Clinical Service of Constanta "St. Andrew" Clinical
Emergency County Constanta, Romania
Background & objectives: Duodenal duplications are rare congenital
malformations that can be found anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract
from the mouth to the rectum, but most frequent encountered in the ileum.
We present a case of rare duodenal duplication cyst masked by
intussusception.
Methods: We present the case of a term born baby, with 1 Apgar
index at 37-38 weeks of gestational age. Shortly after birth the infant
needed surgery for obstruction caused by a suspected bowel that
revealed also the presence of a cyst attached to the duodenal wall.
the cyst was submitted to the Pathology Department and analysed by
standard methods.
Results: The obstructed symptoms of the baby were caused by intussus-
ception of the jejuno-duodenal portion and the surgical reduction revealed
the presence of a cyst attached to the duodenal wall. The pathology report
showed the presence of an epithelial layer containing the intestinal mu-
cosa, a smooth muscle layer and the cyst that was closely attached to the
duodenal wall and sharing a common wall. The cysts mucosae was ul-
cerated and ischemic changes are observed. The case was signed as du-
odenal duplication cyst. Further investigations of the child revealed the
presence of a slight ventricular dilatation. Enteric duplications are rare
conditions and duodenal even rarer with different and poorly known
etiopathogeny.
Conclusion: Even if rare, duplication cyst of the gastro-intestinal tract
can produce severe complication that can endanger the life of children so
that have to be regarded as possible serious conditions that can also be
associated with other malformation/anomalies, often overlooked.

Discordance of the foetuses in cases of monochorionic diamniotic
twins reflects рlacental discordance
N. Nizyaeva*, V. Sakalo, A. Neftereva, K. Gladkova, V. Sinitsyna, Z.
Khodzhaeva
*National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynaecology and
Perinatology, Moscow, Russia
Background & objectives: Selective foetal growth retardation is one of
the most common complications of monochorionic twin pregnancy. The
aim: to study the histology of the placenta in monochorionic twin preg-
nancy and assess its role in the formation of selective foetal growth
restriction(sFGR).
Methods: Histological study (H&E) on the paraffin-embedded slices of
placental samples taken after caesarean section at 28-36 g.a. from 24 pa-
tients aged 24-36 yrs old with monochorionic diamniotic twins has been
performed. The study group with sFGR consisted of placenta samples from
17 puerperas. Control (without sFGR) placenta samples from 7 ones.
Results: sFGR was detected by ultrasound examination from18–
31gestation weeks. The severity of the sFGR depended on the gestational
age;the earlier the sFGR was detected, the more pronounced it was at the
time of delivery. Moreover sFGR correlated with the severity of placental
discordance (asymmetry of development).The area of the placenta adja-
cent to the foetus with sFGR had a lower blood supply, which is mainly
associated with changes in the umbilical cord(marginal,membranous at-
tachment of the umbilical cord(p<0,05), thinned umbilical cord)(p<0,05),
a greater number of villous tree infarctions, accelerated maturation of the
villous tree and an increase in angiogenesis with predominant branching
of blood vessels(p<0,05).In the control group placentas were within ges-
tational age(p<0,05).
Conclusion: The most pronounced placental changes were present in
cases of monochorionic diamniotic twins with discordance of foetal
weight more than 25% and depend on the gestation period.
Funding: This study is supported by State Assignment №21-А21.

Report of a "foregut cyst" with oesophageal and bronchogenic
features
Z.C. Olgun*, S. Ozkanli, H. Seneldir, B. AKSU, M. Mutus, C. Ulukaya
Durakbasa
*Medeniyet University Prof. Dr. Suleyman Yalcin City Hospital
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Oesophageal and bronchogenic cysts share
their major clinical and radiological features. We present a case with a
lesion having coexistent oesophageal and bronchogenic histopathological
features.
Methods: A 10-year-old asymptomatic female child had a 6-cm upper
pole splenic cyst and a 2-cm cyst posteromedial to hepatic left lobe de-
tected incidentally. Laparoscopic hemisplenectomy and en-bloc removal
of the 2-cm cyst in close contact with the intraabdominal oesophagus
without any intraluminal connection was performed. The postoperative
course was uneventful.
Results: The paraesophageal cyst was lined by ciliated columnar epithe-
lium resembling respiratory epithelium with TTF-1 positivity. The
muscularis propria was two-layered and positive with smooth muscle
antigen (SMA) as in the gastrointestinal tract. There was no bronchogenic
cartilage which is essential for bronchogenic duplication cyst diagnosis.
TTF-1 expression in the developing foregut is limited to the respiratory
tract. It is known to be expressed in tracheoesophageal fistula indicating
that the distal oesophagus is probably a respiratory tract-derived structure.
We were not able to make the definite differential diagnosis between
oesophageal and bronchogenic cysts, therefore the lesion was reported
to be a “foregut cyst”.
Conclusion: The histopathological findings of the reported patient sup-
port that differentiating between distal oesophageal and bronchogenic
lesions is not straightforward. Current data about embryological develop-
ment of oesophageal and respiratory diverticuli as well as their cystic
lesions is insufficient for a thorough definition. We think the term “fore-
gut cyst” is a more appropriate nomenclature for such cysts with indefi-
nite origin.

Right atrial isomerism with biallelic GDF1 variants
C. Platt*, A. Mahendru, M. Suri
*Department of Perinatal Pathology, Nottingham University Hospitals
NHS Trust, Nottingham, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: A primigravida on antenatal ultrasound scan
showed foetal cardiac abnormality including unbalanced ventricles and
total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage plus exomphalos. Parents
were non-consanguineous. No relevant family history. Pregnancy was ter-
minated at 21+5 weeks. Parents’ consented to perinatal autopsy.
Methods: Perinatal autopsy confirmed a complex cardiac defect includ-
ing right atrial isomerism, total anomalous venous drainage and complete
atrioventricular septal defect. There were bilateral trilobed lungs. The
spleen was absent. The liver showed situs inversus but the intestines were
malfixed and partly occupied an exomphalos sac. Following the results of
the autopsy the parents were referred to clinical genetics.
Results: Chromosome microarray analysis on foetal skin showed a nor-
mal male karyotype. Trio exome sequencing was undertaken and showed
Virchows Arch
that the foetus was compound heterozygote for pathogenic GDF1 vari-
ants. These included a maternally-inherited frameshift variant (c.909dup;
p.(Val304ArgfsTer48)), which had been reported previously by Kaasinen
et al., 2010 (PMID: 20413652) and a paternally-inherited nonsense var-
iant (c.681C>A; p.(Cys227Ter)) that had been reported previously by
Karkera et al., 2007 (PMID: 17924340). Based on these results the couple
were counselled a 25% (1 in 4) risk of recurrence in future pregnancies
with the option of having diagnostic prenatal testing.
Conclusion: Autosomal recessive forms of right atrial isomerism caused
by mutations in GDF1 have been reported infrequently.
Heterozygous loss-of-function variants in GDF1 were previously report-
ed to cause multiple congenital heart defects (Kakera et al., 2007). Jin at
al., 2017 (PMID: 28991257) reported one amongst 2,871 probands with
congenital heart disease with right atrial isomerism who was compound
heterozygous for mutations in the GDF1 gene. Trio exome sequencing is
recommended in foetuses with right atrial isomerism to identify mono-
genic causes.

Y. Sarra*, S. Mestiri, J. Mathlouthi, Z. Nfikha, Y. Fejji, A. Bchir, A. Atef,
M. Mokni
*FARHAT HACHED HOSPITAL, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Zellweger syndrome (ZS) is a disorder of
peroxisome biogenesis. It is a metabolic disease associating major brain
damage, renal and liver lesions and facial dysmorphia. This syndrome is
difficult to identify given its clinical and genetic heterogeneity.
Methods: A retrospective study at Pathology department of F. Hached
Hospital over a period of 20y, revealed two cases of ZS concerning a 5
days-old boy and a 1-month year-old girl, dying from severe bradycardia.
ZS was highly suspected due to parental consanguinity, death in the
siblings at neonatal age. Genetic analysis was not available. Autopsy
examination was held.
Results: Both new-borns presented a peculiar facial abnormality associat-
ing: trigonocephaly, an enlarged anterior fontanelle, a high forehead,
hypertelorism, a low located and badly hemmed ears, a small nose with a
broad bridge, a highly attenuated philtrum. Characteristic brain lesions were
noticed on autopsy examination: focal hypertrophic brain gyration, bulbar
olives heterotopias, pseudo-cystic lesions of subependymalgerminolysis.
Hematoxylin eosin slides of brain samples highlighted subcortical neuronal
heterotopias and astrocytic gliosis of white matter. Both kidney and liver
showed respectively renal microcysts and remodelling oh the hepatic ductal
plate enlarged by inflammatory fibrosis.
Conclusion: ZS is a rare congenital disease with fatal evolution. The aim
of this work is to warn and remind physicians about the role of autopsy
examination for clinical diagnosis, in peculiar because of great difficulties
of genetic diagnosis.

Primary adrenal teratoma in childhood: a rare case report
H. Seneldir*, S. Ozkanli, B. AKSU, C. Ulukaya Durakbasa
*Istanbul Medeniyet University, Turkey
Background & objectives: Teratomas usually occur in the ovaries and
testes, however, they can arise in a variety of locations. Paediatric adrenal
teratomas are extremely rare neoplasms. We report a case of a 2-year-old
girl with adrenal mature cystic teratoma.
Methods: A 2-year-old girl is brought to the hospital by her parents after
she falls from the stairs. Therefore, a mass is detected in the region of left
adrenal gland in the abdominal ultrasound. Magnetic resonance imaging
showed a 93x88x58 mm heterogeneous mass in the left adrenal gland
area. The patient underwent mass excision.
Results: At the operation, it was observed that the mass expanded the
renal vein and its blood poured into the renal vein. Macroscopic
examination of the surgical specimen showed a 11 cm soft and roundish
mass with well-defined margins. The cut surface of the mass was fatty
and heterogeneous with solid and cystic areas along with focal cartilagi-
nous areas. Histopathological examinations revealed a mature cystic ter-
atoma with no malignant features. No normal adrenal gland was seen.
The mass included organized mature adipocytes, intestinal mucosa, re-
spiratory mucosa, mature glial tissue, nerves and ganglion cells, cartilage,
bone, muscle fibres, lymphoid tissue, skin and hair shafts.
Conclusion: Paediatric adrenal teratomas are uncommon neoplasms,
representing 5% of all paediatric teratomas. Radiologic imaging such as
ultrasonography, CT and MRI is helpful in the pre-operative diagnosis.
However, the gold standard of managing adrenal teratoma is surgical
resection and histopathological examination to differentiate them from
similar characteristic retroperitoneal lesions.

The early debut of an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour of the
gastrointestinal tract – a case report
L. Ursache*, G. Grigore, M.D. Dragomir, O.E. Iaru, F. Vasilescu, A. Neicu
*Emergency University Hospital, Bucharest, Department of Pathology,
Romania
Background & objectives: An inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour
(IMT) can occur in any location, more frequently in the lung and mesen-
tery of children and young adults. IMT is thought to be a borderline
malignancy, with a tendency to recur locally, but can rarely metastasize.
Methods: A 3 months old boy was admitted with a 10 days debut of a
subocclusive syndrome. Abdominal ultrasonography illustrates a tumour
in the right iliac fossa, which measured 54/35/31 mm. Emergency surgery
was performed and intraoperative examination revealed a tumour adher-
ent to the terminal ileum, jejunum, cecum, and ascending colon. The
excision specimen was sent for gross and microscopic examination.
Results: Gross examination revealed a white, firm-elastic tumour, without
necrosis, infiltrating the ileum and colonic wall, but with intact colonic
mucosa. Microscopic examination illustrates a tumour proliferation with
moderate cellularity formed by spindle cells of moderate atypia, with ve-
sicular nuclei and small nucleoli, on a pleomorphic inflammatory back-
ground with lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils; with-
out necrosis or perineural invasion and with 8 mitosis/10 HPF.
Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for Calponin, AE1-AE3, Actin,
Desmin, CD34, as well as ALK, and negativity for EMA, Myogenin. There
was a proliferation index of 25% with Ki-67. All these features were con-
sistent with a diagnosis of Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumour.
Conclusion: This particular case highlights the early onset of the IMT, in
a 3 months old boy, with a sudden debut of a subocclusive syndrome.
There must be made a differential diagnosis with other sarcomatous and
inflammatory entities. Usually, immunohistochemistry illustrates the
more aggressive variants, with ALK-negative staining. Due to the fact
this tumour can recur and metastasize, one has to always follow up with
the patient after excision and, in rare cases, to continue the treatment with
adjuvant therapy.

Renal rhabdoid tumour: two cases report and review of the literature
C. Vieru*, M.L. Abascal Camacho, Y. Gómez Navarro, M.I. Peligros
Gómez, M. Garcia Martos
*Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Spain
Background & objectives: Renal rhabdoid tumour is an uncommon
entity and one of the most aggressive and lethal malignancies in children.
We describe two cases (the only ones in our department over the last 20
years) and we have reviewed the literature.
Methods: There are two cases of renal rhabdoid tumour in our hospital:
two young male and female children, in the third and fifth month of life,
Virchows Arch
with a big left and right renal mass, respectively. They were identified in
ultrasound examination in the context of mild urologic symptomatology
after a well-controlled pregnancy.
Results: Macroscopically, both nephrectomies showed a big renal mass
(8,5x7,5 and 9,5x7 cm) occupying practically all its size. They had
greyish-white and necrotic reddish cut surface and soft consistency. The
microscopic study showed large ovoid to epithelioid cells that have abun-
dant eosinophilic cytoplasm with the characteristic dense hyaline inclu-
sion and a large vesicular nucleus with prominent nucleolus. In the first
case, the tumour infiltrated into adjacent renal parenchyma and blood
vessels. Both of them showed cancer-free resection margins and regional
lymph nodes, being staged as stage II. The immunohistochemical profile
showed negative muscle markers with vimentin and EMA positive. The
study of INI1 showed loss of staining of tumour cell nuclei.
Conclusion: Paediatric renal rhabdoid tumour is an uncommon and highly
aggressive malignancy found in young children, diagnosed mainly during the
first 2 years of life. Because of the advanced stage at the time of presentation,
his early detection and diagnosis are critical to ensure proper therapeutic
management. Our first patient, 6 years later was in complete remission of
symptoms after chemotherapy treatment and the second one, 3 months fol-
lowing diagnosis, responds well to chemoradiotherapy treatment.

Characteristics of paediatric tumours of the genitourinary system
and retroperitoneal space in children of the industrial region
A. Voronina*, O. Reshetnikova, O. Zinchenko, V. Spyridonenko, G.
Gryzonova
* Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, Russia
Background & objectives: Paediatric malignant tumours compared with
adult malignancies are relatively rare pathologies. Although modern
methods of diagnosis and treatment have allowed a positive prognosis
of the outcome of treatment for paediatric patients, cancer remains a main
cause of children’s death.
Methods: A retrospective review of paediatric malignant tumours of the
genitourinary system and retroperitoneal space in 75 children over a
twelve-year period was made. The incidence of such paediatric neo-
plasms in Lugansk region, Ukraine was studied. Tumours morphological
characteristics and the aetiology evaluated and analysed.
Results: Seventy-five cases of paediatric malignant tumours of the gen-
itourinary system and retroperitoneal space were retrospectively
reviewed. Nephroblastic neoplasms (Wilms tumours) had the highest
incidence - 27 cases (36%); retroperitoneal tumours were in the second
place in incidence - 19 cases (22%). A histological study of
nephroblastomas revealed a typical tumour structure in 24 cases, and
epithelial-type Wilms tumours in 1 case. The five-year disease-free life
expectancy was 91%. The second large group consisted of tumours of the
retroperitoneal space. Malignant soft tissue neoplasms were presented
with liposarcoma-2 cases, infantile fibrosarcoma-1, angiosarcoma- 1, un-
differentiated sarcoma – 2. Lymphoid neoplasms included 8 malignant
lymphomas. Five cases were paediatric neuroblastomas.
Conclusion: Modern surgical techniques, adequate postoperative chemo-
therapy and radiation resulted in improved children survival rate. In pres-
ent study five-year event-free life expectancy was 91% after Wilms tu-
mours surgery and 13% in cases of the soft tissue tumours. Increasing
knowledge about paediatric malignancies, cooperation of pathologists
and oncologists create the possibility for complex investigations in this
area. Many issues related to the study of the prevalence, tumorigenesis
and pathology of children malignant tumours require further research.

*V.A. Almazov Research Center, Russia
Background & objectives: One of the most important and disputable
issues of COVID-19 is intrauterine infection. In spite of detection of
SARS-CoVi2 in placenta and stillborn tissues by several investigators
there are still no detailed descriptions of histological changes related to it.
Methods: Detailed clinic-pathological correlations, macro- and histolog-
ical study of autopsy material of the mother, placenta and stillborn with
COVID-19 infection proven by PCR, including immunohistochemical
revealing of spike protein SARS-Covi2.
Results: .N.ZH., 34 y., pregnant at 37 w, got ill with respiratory symp-
toms, died on 11th day of disease due to viral pneumonia with ARDS.
SARS-CoVi12+ on life time and postmortem. After death a stillborn boy
was removed by caesarean section. Swabs for SARS-COvi2 from lungs
and trachea were positive. Was diagnosed antenatal asphyxia with aspi-
ration. Histologically proliferative overgrowths of bronchial epithelium
and macrophages. In all organs endothelial cells with enlarged light nu-
clei. Similar changes in adrenals, pancreas, brain meninges. Moderate
mononuclear infiltration in liver and kidney, more expressed around pan-
creas ducts. During IHC virus antigen in spleen, pancreas, brain, adrenals.
Viral placentitis with chronic insufficiency and acute decompensation.
Conclusion: We confirm the possibility of intrauterine transplacental chal-
lenge of the foetus. In lungs are notes proliferative changes similar with ob-
served in adults, but without signs of ARDS. We can also postulate the devel-
opment of generalized infection with involvement of brain, kidney, pancreas,
heart, adrenals and probably other organs. Histologically special attention has
to be attracted to nuclear changes. Hematogenous viral dissemination is sup-
ported by typical for new coronavirus infection endothelial changes.

Solitary pulmonary capillary haemangioma mimicking early lung
cancer: a case report
C. Albuquerque*, E. Pinto, M. Oliveira
*Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Ocidental, Portugal
Background & objectives: Solitary pulmonary capillary haemangioma
(SPCH) is a rare benign lung tumour. It is a capillary derived mesenchy-
mal neoplasm that typically presents as pure or part-solid ground-glass
nodules on computed tomography, mimicking early lung cancer or pre-
cancerous lesions of the lung.
Methods: A 54-year-old female with heart failure presenting with dys-
pnoea, fatigue and chest pain, with a previous history of smoking, showed
a ground-glass opacity with 4mm diameter in the left inferior lobe of the
lung in a computed tomography showed. FDG-PET didn’t reveal hyper-
metabolic lesions. Clinically the nodule was suspicious for malignancy
and an atypical lung resection was performed.
Results: On gross examination, the nodule was 4mm in diameter, round
and reddish. Histological sections on hematoxylin and eosin revealed a
well-defined nodule with thickened alveolar septa which had multiple
proliferated capillary lumens. The proliferated lumens varied in size and
were filled with blood cells and lined with single layers of flat cells. No
atypical cells were found in the lesion. Immunohistochemical study re-
vealed that the flat cells that lined the lumens were positive for CD34. The
additional lung parenchyma had mild septal fibrosis and lymphoid aggre-
gates foci. There were no additional hemangiomatous lesions in the
resected specimen. The patient was diagnosed as having SPCH.
Conclusion: Lung vascular tumours are extremely rare. SPCH is even a
rarer benign vascular tumour, with only 33 cases reported in literature
until 2020. It tends to present as a single small lesion, located in the lower
lobe. Localized capillary haemangioma manifests as a cystic lesion or
focal ground-glass opacity nodule in a CT scan and can be easily
misinterpreted by radiology as a malignant lesion. Therefore, it is impor-
tant for pathologists to be aware of this entity for accurate diagnosis.

Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis in young adults
with pneumothoraces
V. Almeida*, C. Faria, J. Gama, V. Sousa, L. Carvalho
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Centro Hospitalar e Universtário de
Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE)
was recognized in 2013 as a distinct and rare pulmonary fibrotic disease
but is still a poorly characterized entity. We report the clinicopathological
findings of PPFE in three non-smoker young adults on apical lung resec-
tion after pneumothoraces.
Methods: Patient A, a 21-years-old "marfanoid" male with mitral valve
prolapse without Marfan syndrome genetic confirmation, presented spon-
taneous pneumothorax with bronchopleural fistula.
Patient B, a 20-years-old slender asthmatic male who has had a sponta-
neous pneumothorax two months before, had another pneumothorax.
Patient C, a 16-years-old male with irritable bowel syndrome, had the
third pneumothorax in a 2-year-period.
All patients were non-smokers.
Results: All three patients were submitted to apical lung resection. On
histopathological examination, all cases were similar, presenting with
pleural blebs and globally maintained lung parenchyma lobular architec-
ture. There were also various small triangular subpleural scars and alve-
olar septal fibro-elastosis that also extended into interlobular septae.
Parenchyma away from the pleura was sparsed. There were focal fibro-
blastic foci, mild inflammation, and alveolar haemorrhage in some bron-
chial axes. These findings met the diagnosis requirements for PPFE, then
described in the pathological reports.
Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, these three PPFE patients are
the youngest reported. They illustrate that PPFE is probably more com-
mon than previously believed and should be purposely searched in spe-
cific clinicopathological settings, as pneumothorax events, even in very
young patients. Our patients had specific clinical settings that can func-
tion as underlying disease-associated factors for PPFE. It is therefore
essential to better characterize PPFE clinical framing, particularly because
it might have prognostic significance.

Primary pulmonary EWSR1-negative myoepithelial carcinoma in a
13-years-old girl: a case report
A. Artemyeva*, A. Gogolev
*N.N.Petrov National cancer centre, Russia
Background & objectives: We report a case of primary myoepithelial
carcinoma of the right lung in a 13-year-old girl. Primary myoepithelial
carcinoma of the lung is an extremely rare entity with only a few reported
cases in the literature.
Methods: A 13-year-old girl presented with one year history of chronic
cough diagnosed initially as tuberculosis. Her chest CT showed tumour
conglomerate 51x43x45 mm at the root of the right lung. Bronchoscopic
biopsy diagnosis was epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tu-
mour (with diffuse S100-protein and SOX10 immunoreactivity but
retained INI1 expression). She underwent right lung extended
pneumoectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Results: Histology showed predominantly epithelioid cell malignant
tumour, identical to the previous bronchoscopic biopsy material with
marked nuclear atypia, significant pleomorphism, increased mitoses,
areas of geographical necrosis, and infiltrative growth. The tumour
cells were positive for S-100, SOX10, INI-1, EMA, Cytokeratin(
CAM 5.2), MCK (АЕ1/АЕ3), p63, whilst Calponin, CD34, CK 7,
Desmin, GFAP, HMB-45, MelanA, SMA, SMMS1 were negative.
No EWSR1 gene alterations were detected in the FISH assays, but
EWSR1 gene rearrangements in myoepithelial tumours identified
only in about 50% of cases according to WHO 2021 Classification
of Thoracic tumours. The patient died from postoperative complica-
tions a month after the surgery.
Conclusion: Thoracic myoepithelial tumours are very rare, most often
occurring in adults, but significant number of cases arise in children under
10 years old with higher incidence of malignancy (myoepithelial carci-
noma) in this age group. In our case, exclusion of the bronchoscopic
biopsy diagnosis was necessary and was performed with a immunohisto-
chemical study assessing the presence of neoplastic cells with a
myoepithelial immunophenotype. Awareness of the characteristic epide-
miology, morphologic features of this tumour and mimics is warranted

Ismail, F. El Mezni
*Hôpital Abderrahmane Mami de Pneumo, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Solitary tracheobronchial papillomas are rare
benign tumours of the respiratory tract, accounting for approximately
0.38% of all lung tumours.
The aim of this study was to present clinicopathological characteristics of
these rare tumours with literature review.
Methods: We report a retrospective study of 8 cases of trachea bronchial
papillomas diagnosed at our department of pathology between 2004 and
2020.
Results: There were 4 male and 2 female aged between 52 and 89 years
with mean of 69. All patients presented with respiratory symptoms.
Fibroscopy revealed polypoid endoluminal lesion located in the bronchus
in 6 cases and in the trachea in 2 cases. A biopsy was performed in all
cases. Microscopically, there were 4 cases of squamous papillomas and 4
cases of glandular papillomas. The squamous papilloma was lined by
squamous epithelium with acanthosis and keratinization of the surface,
whereas the glandular papilloma was lined by glandular epithelium
consisting of ciliated columnar cells.
Conclusion: Tracheobronchial papillomas are rare benign lesions. The
course of the disease is unpredictable. It may regress spontaneously, but
in other instances it may lead to serious complications ranging from
airway obstruction up to malignant transformation.

*Department of Pathology, Sahloul Hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Primary lung cancers commonly involve
other structures by direct extension or metastasis. Facial metastasis
has rarely been reported and is even more unusual as the initial pre-
sentation. Here we report a case of lung adenocarcinoma metastasising to
the cheek.
Methods: A 61-year-old man, smoking, presented for evaluation of a
rapidly expanding mass on his right cheek dating since two months as-
sociated to ulceration of the lining of the inner side of the right cheek. A
biopsy of the lesion was done.
Results: we received a biopsy of 1cm. Microscopic examination showed
an invasive carcinomatous proliferation poorly differentiated made of
solid sheets. The tumour cells presented a marked cytonuclear atypia
and several mitoses. The stroma was fibrous of moderate abundance with
a polymorphic inflammatory infiltrate. There were images of
endovascular tumour embolism. The tumour cells were positive to
TTF-1 and negative to P40. Therefore, the diagnosis of cheek metastasis
of lung adenocarcinoma was made. Chest X-ray and computed tomogra-
phy revealed an expansive process in the right lung and mediastinal
Virchows Arch
lymphadenopathy. The patient was referred to the department of oncolo-
gy for further treatment.
Conclusion: Metastases in face may be the first sign of lung cancer.
Although rare appearing, we should raise suspicion in cases of atypical
lesions in the skin not only of the smokers, but also of the non-smokers.
Facial metastases from poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma are a poor
prognostic indicator. It’s appearance with other internal metastases short-
en the survival time. A high index of suspicion is necessary for the early
detection of facial cutaneous metastases. Appropriate treatment may pro-
long patient survival.

Brito García, E. Salido
*Servicio de Anatomía Patológica, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario
de Canarias; Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias de la Salud,
Universidad de La Laguna, Spain
Background & objectives: 56-year-old woman presented complaining
of shortness of breath. Cardiac tamponade due to pericardial effusion was
diagnosed. Imaging studies showed a lung mass with multiple visceral
metastases. Core needle biopsy of the suspected primary lesion was
performed.
Methods: It showed irregular clusters of neoplastic cells intermixed with a
singular tumour microenvironment. It consisted of densely packed multi-
nucleated, osteoclastic-like cells. Immunophenotype revealed TTF1 and
CK7 positivity. Napsin A was negative within the tumour. Since the patient
suffered stage IV disease, NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) biomarker
panel (EGFR, ROS1, ALK, BRAF, KRAS and PDL1) was conducted.
Results: ROS1 immunohistochemistry was positive. FISH test showed,
using the specific probe XL ROS1-GOPC BA, one fusion signal and one
green single signal. The patient was considered for targeted therapy. PD-
L1 expression reached 70%. ROS1 translocated adenocarcinomas have
been previously associated with high PDL1 expression. However, its link
with specific tumour microenvironment has not been deeply explored.
Conclusion: We present a case of ROS1 translocated adenocarcinoma. It
harbours both an uncommon FISH positivity pattern and a singular tu-
mour microenvironment. Association among such features remains
unknown.

Rodrigues, C. Vilasboas, V. Almeida, V. Sousa
*Institute of Anatomical and Molecular Pathology, Faculty of Medicine
of the University of Coimbra, CIMAGO, CHUC, Portugal
Background & objectives: Chromosomal rearrangements involving
ROS proto-oncogene 1 receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ROS1) define dis-
tinct molecular subset of bronchial-pulmonary carcinoma with sensitivity
to ROS1 inhibitors. This case report visualizes the co-existence of EGFR
activating mutation and ROS1 positive fusion by FISH.
Methods: A 73-year-old female presented with an Pulmonary
Adenocarcinoma in the transthoracic biopsy, Molecular Pathology was
performed for testing EGFR Idylla™EGFR Mutation Test (CE-IVD,
Idylla™), ALK SPEC ALK-Dual Colour Probe (ZytoVision), ROS1
FISH and immunohistochemistry (IHC), by applying a SPEC ROS1-
Dual Colour Probe (ZytoVision) and a ROS1 antibody Clone D4D6
(Cell Signalling Technology), respectively.
Results: The observed transthoracic biopsy represented a primary pul-
monary adenocarcinoma mixed type, with acinar pattern where mucinous
producing cells, PAS-D + were demonstrated in between cylindrical cells;
CK7 and TTF1 were expressed in all tumoral cells and vimentin was
present in less than 50% of tumoral cells; PD-L1 22C3 DAKO was
negative – 0%. EGFR activating mutation deletion exon 19, ROS1 trans-
location with aberrant signals in 20% tumoral nuclei in FISH analysis and
cytoplasmic positive ROS1 protein expression were also demonstrated.
ALK fusion gene tested by FISH was negative.
Conclusion: ROS1 is an exclusive driver in published studies. EGFR –
exon 19 deletion and ROS1 can co-exist in the same sample. This coex-
istence has been reported in previous studies with very remote
occurrence.
Concurrent driver mutations might be confirmed through, other testing
methodology to confirm molecular diagnosis before proceeding with
targeted therapy. Tumour biopsy specimens’ limitations correlate with
either tumour and metastatic tumour heterogeneity.
This case report highlights mucin production and vimentin expression to
associate with molecular results.

SMAD4 mutation in bronchial – pulmonary carcinomas: a challenge
for immunotherapy and potential new target

Rodrigues, C. Vilasboas, V. Almeida, V. Sousa
*Institute of Anatomical and Molecular Pathology, Faculty of Medicine
of the University of Coimbra, CIMAGO, CHUC, Portugal
Background & objectives: SMAD4 encoded protein mediates transduc-
tion signal TGF-ß/BMP superfamilies, on transcriptional activation of
target genes and pathways: WNT/ß-catenin, MAPK and PI3K/AKT, en-
hancing EMT/stroma/tumour progression.
SMAD4 mutations often found in pancreas, colorectal, oesophagus and
stomach neoplasias, are less reported in other tumours.
Methods: Paraffin block microdissections of three adenocarcinomas (bi-
opsy, surgical specimen – two independent tumours in different lobes)
and one NST carcinoma (biopsy) were prepared for DNA-extraction and
Next Generation Sequencing in Ion PGM. Library followed Ion
AmpliSeqTM Colon and Lung Cancer Research Panel v2 procedures.
Analysis results of Torrent Server/Ion Reporter and Catalogue of
Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) were reported.
Results: Bifocal solid/micropapillary adenocarcinomas under 3cm diam-
eter each had CK7/TTF1 expression and PD-L1 22C3 DAKO 100%,
mucinous adenocarcinoma CK7/TTF1/Vim expression and 22C3
DAKO 5%; CK7+ TTF1/CK5.6- NST carcinoma with PD-L1 90%.
Proliferative index Ki67 was over 30%.
The missense mutation SMAD4 (exon 6) c.767A>T;p.(Gln256Leu), not
reported in ClinVar, was represented in the four samples submitted to
NGS. Complete separation between malignant epithelial cells and stroma
components was tried. It means, sequencing was performed on extracted
DNA theoretically enriched for malignant epithelial compartment with
residual representation of tumoral stroma, as usually performed in
Pathology for molecular pathology studies on FFPE tissue, based on
Hematoxylin-Eosin tumour representativeness selection.
Conclusion: DNA/RNA sequencing for target therapy in bronchial-
pulmonary carcinomas is raising knowledge about tumoral mutational
status, without rigorous distinction between malignant epithelial and stro-
ma components.
TGF-ß/SMAD4 signalling pathway/expression in tumoral extracellular
matrix, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, cell adhesion and progres-
sion through E-cad/vimentin, after initiation and progression, indicates
SMAD4 c.767A>T;p.(Gln256Leu) missense mutation relevant for per-
sonalized therapy interpretation (R Wan 2020/ A Todisco 2019).
Loss of SMAD4 function is being correlated with reduction of T cell anti-
tumour immunity due to MYC/SMAD4 independent function
impairment.

Malignant solitary fibrous tumour (SFT) in extralobar pulmonary
sequestration in an adult
A. Elhag*, S. Qadri, S. Bakhiet
*Hull University Hospitals NHS Trust, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: Extralobar pulmonary sequestration (EPS) is
a rare congenital anomaly of extrapulmonary lung tissue with own blood
supply and pleural covering within thorax, diaphragm or abdomen1.
Malignancy within EPS is rarely reported mostly carcinomas, but SFT
has not been reported before.
Methods: A 55-year-old asymptomatic man was referred to cardiotho-
racic department with incidental finding of a left chest mass on radiology.
A moderately PET avid mass was found in the left hemithorax, extending
to chest wall with arterial supply from pulmonary artery. Mass was not
biopsied due to high vascularity but surgically resected with a small
uninflatable left lower lobe2&3.
Results: Macroscopy showed a solid greyish mass 230 gm and 230 mm
maximum dimension with lung tissue at one edge. The left lower lung lobe
appeared hypoplastic and oedematous with no lesion on sectioning. Left upper
lobe was not resected. Microscopy showed a plump spindle cell proliferation
with marked atypia and mitoses 7/10 HPF. Stroma was dense, collagenous,
myxoid and cystic, mostly patternless and focally storiform. The tumour and
attached lung were totally invested by pleura with no bronchial connection to
the tracheobronchial tree. The tumour was strongly positive for Vimentin,
STAT6, focally S100 and negative for Calretinin, AE1/3, EMA, CD34 and
Desmin, consistent with malignant solitary fibrous tumour in EPS.
Conclusion: There are very few reported cases of malignancy in
extralobar lung sequestration including Adenocarcinoma, Squamous car-
cinoma, mesothelioma and carcinoid tumour. We present a case of
Malignant Solitary Fibrous tumour in extralobar lung sequestration in
an adult, a triple rarity. Carful and microscopic examination with clinical
and radiological correlation is crucial to reach the correct diagnosis. The
patient remains well and symptom free 7 months after resection.

Acute interstitial organising pneumonia in SARS-Cov-2 infection - a
case report
G. Fontinha*, J. Gama, J. Madeira, C. Faria, L. Carvalho
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Centro Hospitalar e Universtário de
Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: COVID-19 is a multi-organic systemic dis-
ease that can lead to death by pulmonary compromise, its most commonly
affected site. Histopathological patterns have been described for the stag-
ing of the pulmonary infection.
Methods: An Asian 53-year-old non-smoking man, living in Portugal for
the last five years, was admitted to the Hospital with a history of dyspnoea
and cough that had started 2 days before. An x-ray showed bilateral
opacities and SARS-Cov-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR testing.
Subsequently, pneumothorax was diagnosed with the need for
pleurodesis and a surgical biopsy was performed.
Results: Histopathological diagnosis was performed in a right upper lobe
fragment measuring 5x3,5x3,7cm, as well as visceral and parietal pleural
fragments.
The histomorphological study of the pulmonary tissue biopsy exhib-
ited oedema, dense septal and alveolar inflammatory infiltrate, pri-
marily composed of macrophages, some multinucleated, thickened
walled blood vessels and fibroblastic proliferation. A peripheral in-
farct was identified with an organizing hematoma with fibrin depo-
sition. The pleura showed chronic pleuritis features with marked an-
giogenesis and collagenization. Acute interstitial organizing pneumo-
nia (AIOP) was characterized by a discrete presence of fibrin and
predominance of myofibroblastic inflammatory polyps and type II
pneumocytes hyperplasia.
Conclusion: Histopathological characterization of COVID-19 has been
fundamental to establish the mechanisms by which SARS-Cov-2 pulmo-
nary infection progresses and reaches repair, shedding light to the patho-
physiology of this new disease.
The findings in this case report were compatible with a late phase, after
the stage of exudative diffuse alveolar damage and before the organizing
phase, according with Hans Bösmüller et al (2021) and Emanuela
Barisione et al (2021).

N. Tomanovic, B. Vukomanovic Djurdjevic, B. Dozic, V. Vucinic
*Institute for pathology, Serbia
Background & objectives: Experience of Institute for Pathology,
Medical School, University of Belgrade in applying and evaluation of
PD-L1 immunohistochemistry in patients with Non-Small Cell Lung
Cancer (NSCLC) during 2018.
Methods: Material used is bronchoscopic and surgical samples of
NSCLC stage III/IV. A qualitative IHC test with monoclonal mice anti-
bodies is used (Dako, clone 22C3). PD-L1 expression is defined as tu-
mour proportion score (TPS) which has to have a minimum of 100 viable
tumour cells. Given TPS score is reported as one of tree-cut system:
TPS<1%; TPS 1-49%; TPS ≥50%.
Results: During 2018 a total of 120 NSCLC samples were reviewed of
which 102 were eligible for PD-L1 evaluation. There were 44 female and
58 male patients, age 65±14. In 3,9% (4/102) of samples TPS was <1%;
50,0% of samples (51/102) expressed PD-L1 with a TPS of 1%–49% and
46,1% (47/102) with a TPS of >50%. A statistically significant difference
in PD-L1 immunopositivity was associated to adenocarcinomas.
Conclusion: Our immunohistochemical laboratory is a centralized centre
for PD-L1 testing. Results obtained in our centre during 2018 regarding
PDL-1 testing have been in correlation with other reference centres. Patients
with PD- TPS ≥50% in their samples have been considered as eligible for
first-line immunotherapy with remarkable effect on survival rate.

“Pseudomeostheliomatous” carinoma: clinicopathological study of 4
cases
Y. Gomez Navarro*, A. Panizo Santos, M. Garcia Martos
*HGU GREOGRIO MARAÑÓN, Spain
Background & objectives: Pseudomesotheliomatous carcinoma (PCL)
was the name given to a lung cancer with pleural growth-pattern. This
tumour has a clinical and histological resemblance to diffuse malignant
pleural mesothelioma but retaining histological, immunohistochemical
and molecular characteristics of pulmonary adenocaricnoma.
Methods: We report 4 cases of Pseudomesotheliomatous carcinoma.
Two patients were men and two were women, ranging in age from 42-
80 years. None had a history of asbestos exposure, nor they were
smokers. All patients had chest pain, pleural effusion and pleural thick-
ening. CT scan showed an advanced stage at diagnosis with multiple
swelling of mediastinal lymph nodes in all patients.
Results: Microscopically, the tumours grow with a diffuse or solid pat-
tern and had large polygonal cells with sharply defined borders. Nests of
neoplastic cells were limited by trabecules of connective tissue with many
lymphocytes. The tumour cells in all cases strongly reacted for thyroid
transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), podoplanin, pan-cytokeratin, Ber-EP-4,
epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). None of the cases stained for me-
sothelial marker calretinin or WT-1. Immunohistochemistry provides
enough sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing lung adenocarcino-
ma from epithelioid mesothelioma, and our results of
Virchows Arch
immunohistochemistry are unequivocal for diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.
EGFR wt cases were died before ten months, but EGFR mutated was live
79 months.
Conclusion: PCLs are uncommon and pathologically heterogeneous tu-
mours. Immunohistochemistry plays an effective role in distinguishing
adenocarcinoma from epithelioid subtype malignant mesothelioma.
Calretinin has been demonstrated to be a highly discriminant marker
between mesothelioma and adenocarcinoma with high sensitivity and
specificity for mesothelioma. Most importantly, PCLs have a dismal
prognosis; however, further studies would be necessary to find out if these
patients may benefit from the treatment with inhibitors of the EGFR
tyrosin kinase.

Diffuse alveolar septal type pulmonary amyloidosis: case report and
literature review
Y. Gomez Navarro*, C. Ortiz-Villalon, A. Panizo Santos, C. Prada
Puentes, M.L. Abascal Camacho, C. Vieru, M. Garcia Martos
*HGU GREOGRIO MARAÑÓN, Spain
Background & objectives: Amyloid is a form of fibrillary protein that is
deposited in the extracellular matrix and has characteristic physical, ul-
trastructural, immunophenotypic, and tictorial properties. Pulmonary am-
yloidosis can taken a variety of forms: nodular, tracheobronchial, and
diffuse alveolar sept forms.
Methods: A 52-year-old woman, ex-smoker and with a history of breast
cancer treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy, consulted for
dyspnoea of one year of evolution. She had no cough, chest pain, or
wheezing on auscultation. A CT scan of the chest showed multiple sym-
metrical and bilateral, thin-walled air cysts. The hemogram showed no
alterations and the autoimmunity studies were negative.
Results: Histologically the alveolar septa showed diffusely and extensive
eosinophilic deposits. At higher magnification, the eosinophilic material
was distributed in thick an thin hyalinized bundles in a lamellar arrange-
ment. The hyalinized bundles showed a concentric arrangement around
small blood vessels. Occasional cluster of mononuclear cells that includ-
ed focally abundant plasma cells and a minor background population of
small lymphocytes separated the eosinophilic deposits. This deposit
showed positive staining for Congo Red but multiples stains form amy-
loid AA, light chains Kappa and Lambda were negative. It was diagnoses
as compatible with pulmonary amyloidosis type diffuse septal alveolar
(ADSAP).
Conclusion: This entity is extremely rare and lung limited. Main
radiological differential diagnosis is linfangioleiomiomatosis or
Langerhans cells histiocytosis and both were descarted. ADSAP is
a rare mixed entity related to AL amyloidosis and usually underlying
collagen disease. Literature review demonstrate that incidental pul-
monary amyloid are unrelated to systemic amyloidosis or plasma cell
myeloma. However, marginal zone lymphomas with amyloid de-
posits must be careful excluded.

Clinical case of lung NUT carcinoma
S. Ivanova*, N. Yanev, R. Ivanova
*Hospital for pulmonary diseases "St. Sofia", Bulgaria
Background & objectives: NUT (nuclear protein in testis) carcinoma is
very rare but extremely aggressive high-grade carcinoma characterized
by the presence of a fusion NUT gene. It is also called midline carcinoma
because it affects the structures in this location- head, neck, lungs.
Methods: We report a case of 27-year-old woman with lung NUT carci-
noma, diagnosed by bronchoscopic fibro-punch biopsy.
Results: The histological examination showed massive infiltration of
bronchial wall of predominantly spindle-shaped neoplastic cells with un-
clear cytoplasmic borders. In some areas there were groups of rounded
cells with clearly visible nucleoli and high mitotic rate. Foci with necrosis
were also found. Immunohistochemistry showed positive expression of
cytokeratin, p63, CD56 and NUT antibodies and negative reaction for
TTF1 and chromogranin A in neoplastic cells. The proliferative activity
of tumour cells was very high (over 70%).
Conclusion: Immunohistoshemical study of NUT expression is manda-
tory in cases with poorly differentiated lung tumours, with predominantly
midline mass.

Comparison of E1L3N and SP263 clones of PD-L1 in non-small cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC): may it be associated with cut-off value?
D. Karaman*, E. Bozkurtlar
*Marmara University School of Medicine, Department of Pathology,
Istanbul, Turkey
Background & objectives: PD-L1 immunohistochemistry has become
an important tool for targeted therapy in lung cancer. PD-L1 status as a
predictor of treatment response has led to development of different
clones. Our aim is to compare diagnostic performances of SP263 and
E1L3N clones.
Methods: Consecutive sections were taken from paraffin blocks with tu-
mour tissue from 102 NSCLCs. PD-L1 staining performed with SP263 and
E1L3N clones. After samples were randomized, staining evaluation per-
formed by one pathologist blindly. PD-L1 protein expression was reported
as tumour proportion score(TPS) which was ranging from 0% to 100%
and, scored as positive or negative by using cut-off ≥1% and ≥50%.
Results: The mean age was 63.25 and 81.4% of the cases were male.
Sample types in order of frequency were small biopsy (n=47), resection
(n=37) and cytology (n=7).
The distributions of SP263 and E1L3N expression were as the following:
negative n=15/18, weak positive n=31/45 and high positive n=56/39.
Using the TPS ≥1% cut-off to define cases as ‘positive,’ there was
94,3% sensitivity, 86,7% specificity, 93,1% accuracy, 93.8% positive
predictive value and 96% negative predictive value, with five false-
negative and two false-positive results. Using the TPS ≥50% cut-off to
define cases as ‘positive,’ there was 74,7% sensitivity, 86,7% specificity,
76,5% accuracy, 97% PPV, and 37,1% NPV, with 22 false-negative and
two false-positive results.
Conclusion: In this study of 102 NSCLC tumour samples, when ≥1%
cut-off was used for positivity a high level of concordance was observed
among SP263 and E1L3N clones of PD-L1. E1L3N clone seems to have
difficulties comparing SP263 because of either examination of weak
stained tissues or staining protocol problems causing weak positivity.

Background & objectives: Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease
that causes pancreatic damage via complicated molecular mechanisms.
Among other complications, it can lead to ARDS. We aimed to evaluate
the anti-inflammatory activity of apigenin in lungs after surgically caus-
ing acute pancreatitis in mice.
Methods: 126 pulmonary tissue specimens of Wistar mice were divided
in three groups: S: virtual surgery, C: surgically caused AP, A: surgically
caused AP while Apigenin was induced. Groups C and A were separated
in subgroups 12h, 24h, 48h and 72h according to the time point of mice
euthanasia. Then, the expression of the inflammatory biomarkers HSP-60
and HSP-70 was evaluated.
Virchows Arch
Results: We observed that HSP-60 and HSP-70 expression was higher
(p<0.01) in group A compared to the other groups at 12h and 24h. This
result remained the same at 48h as far HSP-60 expression is concerned,
while there was no statistically significant difference of HSP-70 expression
among the groups. Last, HSP-60 and HSP-70 expression were higher with
statistical significance in group C at 72h compared to groups A and S.
Conclusion: It is encouraging to see that apigenin may have a protecting
role against pulmonary damage due to acute pancreatitis. However, more
experiments are in need to reach more secure conclusions so apigenin can
be used as an anti-inflammatory agent in prevention and treatment of
acute pancreatitis in the future.

Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) and desquamative
interstitial pneumonia (DIP): diagnosis in transthoracic pulmonary
biopsies - two case reports
J. Madeira*, C. Faria, J. Gama, G. Fontinha, L. Carvalho
*Serviço de Anatomia Patológica, Centro Hospitalar e Universtário de
Coimbra, Portugal
Background & objectives: AFOP and DIP are rarely diagnosed and
difficult to recognize in transthoracic pulmonary biopsies due to sam-
pling. Two cases of alveolar filling, clinically interpreted as pneumonia,
were characterized for differential diagnoses and to highlight interstitial
diseases classification.
Methods: Non-smoker 72-years-old man complaining of cough, fever
and headache, presenting occupational risk exposure to paints, lead and
textile particles and with medical history of asthmatic bronchitis and
hypertension, presented diffuse ground glass opacities in the right upper
and middle lobes in computerized tomography scan. Smoker 42-years-
old man presented with thoracic pain and right upper lobe diffuse lesion
in chest x-ray.
Results: Transthoracic needle biopsy with fibrin balls partially organized
with fibroblasts, macrophages and eosinophils in myxoid matrix in alve-
olar lumina characterized AFOP for the first patient diagnosis. Round
massive groups of macrophages occupying the alveoli spaces and also
present in the alveolar septa fulfilled the criteria for DIP diagnosis in the
second case. The association between occupational risk exposure and
AFOP in the first case and between DIP and tobacco exposure in the
second case are commonly recognized and as primary/idiopathic patterns
in the classification of interstitial diseases.
Conclusion: AFOP, characterized by deposits of intra-alveolar fibrin
balls and associated organizing pneumonia within the alveolar ducts
and bronchioles, was achieved in biopsy representative tissue. Overlap
with diffuse alveolar damage, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia and
eosinophilic lung may be possible for final diagnosis with scarcely rep-
resented in biopsies. DIP and AFOP keep in common alveolar filling with
different cellular representation. Morphological criteria of these distinct
entities allowed differential diagnosis, important due to different out-
comes and clinical dealing for patient’s treatment and counselling.

The use of p16 in association with TTF1 and CD56 may be extremely
helpful in establishing the correct diagnosis of small cell lung carci-
noma on small biopsy specimens: report of two challenging cases
M. Marginean*, C. Carașca, A. Sabău, O.S. Cotoi, A. Nechifor-Boila
*Pathophysiology Department, University of Medicine, Pharmacy,
Sciences and Technology George Emil Palade of Targu Mures, Romania
Background & objectives: Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) can usu-
ally be diagnosed based on the morphological evaluation on routine
haematoxylin-eosin stain. However, immunohistochemistry may be ex-
tremely helpful and necessary in problematic cases, such as small biopsy
specimens with extensive crush artifacts.
Methods: We report the cases of two patients (72 years old male and 53
years old female) admitted to the hospital for cough, difficulty in breath-
ing and dyspnoea. Lung tumour was suspected. Bronchoscopy was per-
formed and the biopsy specimens were submitted to the Department of
Pathology for pathological examination. Due to small size of the speci-
men the interpretation was challenging.
Results: Both the examined biopsies showed a tumoral proliferation with
crushing artifact, consisting of small cells with diffuse growth pattern and
also nesting architecture. Cells presented low cytoplasm, irregular
pleomorphus nuclei, with indistinct cell boundaries. Apoptotic bodies
and numerous mitosis were present. Immunohistochemically, both tumours
stained positive for TTF1 and negative on p40. CD56 staining revealed a
fine, membranous expression that was diffuse in one case and focal in
another one. The Ki67 proliferation index was high in both tumours. P16
labelling revealed intense and diffuse positive nuclear staining in both
tumour cells. Based on the morphological features and the immunohisto-
chemical profile of the tumours, a diagnosis of SCLC was set.
Conclusion: For lung biopsies, especially in case of small amount of ma-
terial, the histopathological diagnosis is challenging and cannot only rely
on morphological features. The triple marker, composed of p16, TTF1 and
CD56 may be useful in establishing the correct diagnosis of SCLC.

Ayadi, O. Ismail, F. Mezni
*Abderrahman mami hospital, Tunis, Tunisia
Background & objectives: The diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothe-
lioma is suspected based on clinical features but positive diagnosis is
microscopic. Our aim was to describe the clinical and microscopic fea-
tures of MPM through a single institution experience.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective study about 30 MPM diagnosed
over a 20-year-period (1995-2015). We included only patients with com-
plete records including clinical, radiologic and microscopic features. All
the microscopic diagnoses were reviewed by 2 pathologists. A mean of
12 slides per case was reviewed. The diagnosis was based on the 2015
WHO classification.
Results: The mean age of the patients was 61 years. The sex ratio was 6,5.
The most frequent symptoms was chest pain reported in 25 cases. The
microscopic exam concluded to an EM in 17 cases, sarcomatoid mesothe-
lioma (SM) in 4 cases and biphasic mesothelioma (BM) in 9 cases.
Immunohistochemicaltechniquewasrepeatedin15casesandthemostused
antibodies were the anti-calretinin and the TTF1. Surgical resection was
possible in 2 patients. 15 patients were lost of view after a mean follow-up
period of 3 months. Thirteen patients died before or during the follow-up.
Conclusion: In this work, the major limits faced were the incomplete
databases, the small number of patients included. Microscopic positive
diagnosis necessitates a degree of expertise and every laboratory has to
determine the most valuable antibodies through its experience in order to
optimize the diagnosis and to reduce the delay of diagnosis.

Synchronous lung adenocarcinoma and diffuse idiopathic pulmo-
nary neuroendocrine hyperplasia (DIPNECH) – a case report
R. Naamneh*, L. Friedel
*Pathology department Rabin medical centre, Petah Tikva, Israel
Background & objectives: DIPNECH is characterized by widespread
hyperplasia of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells that may be confined to
the mucosa of airway, invade locally to form tumourlets or carcinoid
tumours. We present a case of DIPNECH that was diagnosed synchro-
nously with lung adenocarcinoma.
Virchows Arch
Methods: A 57-yr-old female with history of asthma and heavy smoking
presented with cough, dyspnoea, and haemoptysis. CT revealed 3cm
mass in the left upper lobe, in addition to multifocal air-trapping and
mosaic perfusion pattern in both lungs. Transbronchial biopsy from the
mass showed adenocarcinoma confirmed by positive immunohistochem-
ical stains for CK7 and TTF1 in atypical cells. A lobectomy was
performed.
Results: On gross examination, a tan-white solid mass measuring 3cm
with stellate border was present. In addition, serial sections of the unin-
volved pulmonary parenchyma revealed multiple small grey-white nod-
ules measuring up to 0.5cm. Microscopic examination of the mass
showed acinar adenocarcinoma. The small nodules were composed of
uniform cells arranged in nests. These cells showed round to oval nuclei,
eosinophilic cytoplasm and salt and pepper chromatin. In addition, spin-
dle cell features were also present. Immunohistochemical stains for
chromogranin and synaptophysin were positive in these nodules,
confirming them as neuroendocrine tumourlets. In addition, the airway
mucosa at several sections including the surgical margin demonstrated
intramucosal hyperplasia of neuroendocrine cells.
Conclusion: DIPNECH is a rare phenomenon. The synchronous presen-
tation of DIPNECH with primary lung adenocarcinoma is an exceedingly
rare scenario.

Pulmonary mucous gland adenoma. A case report
D. Riga*, I. Vamvakaris, E. Psychogiou, P. Megas, V. Michelis, A.
Papadopoulou, K. Kosmas
*Pathology Department, General Hospital of Thoracic Diseases “Sotiria”,
Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: Pulmonary mucous gland adenoma (PMGA)
is a rare tumour, arising from tracheobronchial seromucinous glands and
ducts, classified as lung adenoma in WHO classification. Diagnosis is
challenging due to microscopic similarity with benign and malignant
entities and surgical excision is required.
Methods: We report the case of a 32-year-old asymptomatic female
patient who was admitted to our hospital with an incidentally found bulla
in the right lower pulmonary lobe observed in chest X-ray and measuring
8.3x7x6.5cm. The patient underwent right lower lobectomy due to high
suspicion of malignancy.
Results: On cut surface we found a well-circumscribed multi-space cystic
lesion containing numerous mucin-filled smaller cysts. Microscopic ex-
amination revealed exophytic nodules above the cartilaginous plates of
the bronchial wall consisting of neoplastic mucous glands, lined by a
single layer of tall columnar cells with basally oriented nuclei and abun-
dant mucous-filled supranuclear cytoplasm. Cytologic atypia, infiltrative
pattern, mitoses, necrosis and pleomorphism were not detected, excluding
low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma as well as pulmonary adenocarci-
noma scenarios. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated similar staining to
non-neoplastic bronchial glands [EMA(+), CEA(+), CK7(+), TTF-1(-),
Napsin-A(-) and Ki-67(+) with rare positivity]. TTF-1 negativity along
with topography, size and morphology helped us exclude papillary ade-
noma, mucinous cystadenoma and alveolar cell adenoma.
Conclusion: Experienced pathologists should keep PGMA in mind since
its differential diagnosis includes both benign and malignant entities. The
collaboration of radiologists, pneumonologists and pathologists along with
thorough sampling and immunohistochemical assays is mandatory for the
accurate pathological diagnosis and appropriate therapy of the patient.

The value of TTF-1 and Napsin-A biomarkers in primary lung
adenocarcinomas
D. Riga*, I. Vamvakaris, E. Psychogiou, P. Megas, A. Konstantinidou,
K. Kosmas
*Pathology Department, General Hospital of Thoracic Diseases “Sotiria”,
Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: Adenocarcinoma (AC) represents the domi-
nant subtype of lung cancer. Differential-diagnosis of primary from met-
astatic lung AC requires immunohistochemical assays. According to lit-
erature, the sensitivity and specificity of Napsin-A (84.9/93.8%, respec-
tively) and TTF-1 (84.4/83.9%, respectively) for primary lung AC are
high.
Methods: We reviewed 215 cases of primary pulmonary ACs in lobec-
tomy specimens diagnosed in the year 2020 from the archives of
Pathology Department of General Hospital of Thoracic Diseases of
Athens “Sotiria”. Fifty-six of the cases were poorly differentiated ACs.
The remaining 159 were well/moderately differentiated ACs. We per-
formed immunohistochemical examination of all 215 cases with
Napsin-A and TTF-1 biomarkers.
Results: Among the 159 cases of well and moderately differentiated ACs,
146/159 cases were TTF-1(+) (92%) and 129/159 were Napsin-A(+)
(81%). Additionally, 54/159 cases were TTF-1(-) and Napsin-A(+)
(34%) whereas 46/159 cases were TTF-1(+) and Napsin-A(-) (29%).
Out of 56 poorly differentiated ACs, 20 cases were TTF-1(+) (36%),
while 36 were Napsin-A(+) (64%), leading to the assumption that
Napsin-A performed better than TTF-1 in poorly differentiated ACs.
Conclusion: According to our findings, the combination of positive im-
munostaining for TTF-1 and Napsin-A biomarkers is mandatory for the
accurate diagnosis of primary lung ACs and improves the diagnostic
accuracy, as recorded in the current literature. The findings of our survey
also confirm the remarkable contribution of Napsin-A in poorly differen-
tiated primary pulmonary ACs.

Ayadi, F. Mezni
*Department of Pathology, Abderrahmen Mami Hospital, Ariana,
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Granular cell tumour (GCT) is a rare benign
tumour, commonly found in the head and neck region. Tracheobronchial
GCT remains an exceptional site. The aim of our study is to describe
clinical and pathological features of this rare entity.
Methods: We report here a retrospective study of 4 granular cell tumour
diagnosed at our department of Pathology from January 1998 to
December 2020.
Results: Patients were all males aged from 45 to 85 years with a mean of
52.5. Presenting symptoms includes cough, chest pain, wheezing,
haemoptysis and dyspnoea. Bronchoscopy revealed endoluminal tumour
obstructing trachea in 3 cases and bronchus in one case. A biopsy was
made in the 4 cases. It showed a population of polygonal large neoplastic
cells with eosinophilic coarse granules and small nuclei with mild atypia.
They were arranged in nests, bands, or cords, separated by thin fibrous
tissue. On immunohistochemistry, the tumour cell expressed CD56, S100
and CD68 and were negative for Cytokeratin. The histopathological find-
ings were consistent with GCT. All the patients were treated by broncho-
scopic resection.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of granular cell tumour of the tracheobronchial
tree is based on histology with the contribution of immunohistochemistry.
The prognosis is good following surgical or endobronchial resection.

Ayadi, F. Mezni
*Department of Pathology, Abderrahmen Mami Hospital, Ariana,
Tunisia
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Benign mesenchymal tumours of the medi-
astinum are rare and primary leiomyomas are even rarer with less than 20
cases reported in the English literature. Our objective is to to clarify
histological features and discuss histogenesis of primary mediastinal
leiomyoma.
Methods: A 78-year-old man admitted in cardiovascular surgery depart-
ment after fortuitous discovery of a giant mediastinal mass during the
preoperative assessment for a gallbladder lithiasis. The thoracic computed
tomography scan showed a middle mediastinal mass measuring
14.6x14x9cm compressing the oesophagus, the left atrium and the pul-
monary inferior veine. The tumour was enucleated by thoracotomy and
was not related to the oesophagus.
Results: Gross examination showed a large tumour measuring 14×10×5
cm. It was firm multilobular with myxoid areas. Histologically, it was
composed of monomorphic spindle cells forming intersecting fascicles.
No nuclear atypia, mitoses or necrosis were observed.
Immunohistochemical stain revealed strong positivity for smooth muscle
actin and desmin compatible with benign leiomyoma.
Conclusion: Primary mediastinal leiomyomas are rare, representing 1 to
6% of all mediastinal masses. They are seen in middle-aged women. They
develop from small vessels in the soft tissue of the mediastinum wall.
Although leiomyoma’s pathogenesis is obscure, oestrogen and traumatic
theories were suggested. Leiomyomas are usually slow-growing tumours
and often detected incidentally on chest radiographs. It should be consid-
ered in the differential diagnosis of mediastinal tumours. The definitive
diagnosis is achieved by histology.

Wegener’s granulomatosis: a histopathological study of 14 cases
F. Sassi*, E. Braham, R. Ayadi, S. Ben Cheikh, M. Mlika, O. Ismail, A.
Ayadi, F. Mezni
*Department of Pathology, Abderrahmen Mami Hospital, Ariana,
Tunisia
Background & objectives: Wegener granulomatosis (WG) is a multi-
system disease related to the presence of circulating antineutrophil cyto-
plasmic antibodies (ANCAs). It is characterized by a necrotizing granu-
lomatous vasculitis affecting predominantly the upper and lower respira-
tory tract and lungs.
Methods: This retrospective study was performed on 14 cases of WG
selected from pathology department from 2001 to 2020.
Results: There were 7 men and 7 women (mean age 45,6; range 3-64). The
diagnosis was made by thoracoscopy biopsies in 9 cases and surgical re-
section of pulmonary nodules in 5 cases. Histopathological analysis found
parenchymal necrosis in 9 cases as neutrophilic micro-abscesses or as areas
of geographic necrosis. Granulomatous lesions consisted of microabscesses
surrounded by giant cells in 13 cases. Vasculitis were identified in 13 cases.
Fibrinoid necrosis was relatively uncommon (1 case).
Conclusion: On microscopic findings, pulmonary WG is characterized
by a necrotizing vasculitis affecting blood vessels of all sizes. More than
90% of patients with WG respond to cytotoxic and immunosuppressant
medications and nodules may regress without scarring in almost cases.
However, they may recur on treatment or after a period of complete
disease remission; in this context, the cavitary nodules may occasionally
become infected tending to be thick-walled with irregular inner margins.

Pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung – distinct sarcomatoid compo-
nent and cystic papillary adenocarcinoma
B. Sepodes*, C. Faria, L. Carvalho
*CHUC, Portugal
Background & objectives: Pleomorphic carcinoma of lung is rare and
presents with aggressive course, representing 0,1%-0,4% of pulmonary
carcinomas. Sarcomatoid pattern may be predominant over unusual
cavitated/cystic papillary adenocarcinoma component: a “cyst” was not
interpreted as neoplastic in HRTC.
Methods: A smoker 58-year-old man, in follow up due to left pulmonary
tumour after transthoracic inconclusive biopsy with 54mm –necrotic tumor-
al tissue, performed PET scan where persistent discrete uptake was ob-
served. Patient was submitted to lobectomy and lymphadenectomy.
Pulmonary left lower lobe (LLL) exhibited two continuous lesions: upper
solid mass with 7cm diameter and cystic/cavitated lesion with 5cm
diameter.
Results: LLL (280g/22x17x6,5) - 6x7x3cm well-defined white, soft, ex-
tensively necrotic tumour measuring 6x7x3cm presented a neighbour a
5,5x4x3,7cm cavitated lesion twinned with adjacent 2x2x1,5cm “cystic”
lesion. Microscopy: solid compound with peripheral preserved fusiform
cells rim eosinophilic cytoplasm and elongated nuclei, interspersed giant
cells with anisokaryosis and atypical mitotic figures; positivity for EMA,
CD10, CD56, NSE, Vimentin, TTF1 and HHF35. The “cysts” were pre-
dominant papillary adenocarcinoma with micropapillary and focal acinar
patterns. CK7, TTF1, Cam 5.2 and Vimentin contrasted with NSE and
CD56 negativity. Lymphadenectomy comprised 14/21 hilar lymph nodes
metastasis with both tumoral components. PD-L1 (22C3DAKI) expres-
sion was 90% and 40%, respectively.
Conclusion: LLL pleomorphic carcinoma with cystic papillary/
micropapillary/acinar adenocarcinoma and sarcomatoid carcinoma with
neuro-endocrine differentiation was reported. Necrosis is associated with
high proliferative index and poor prognosis becomes worse due to lymph
node metastasis Large sampling was essential to characterize heterogene-
ity and morphological variety, in this case. Correlation with smoke/
particular smoking type was expressed in smoking lung and BALT hy-
perplasia in pulmonary parenchyma.

Extra-skeletal osteoid osteoma of the lung, a rare case
G. Stanc*, E. Souka, N. Novkovic, N. Bolanos, N. Baltagiannis, C.
Valavanis
*METAXA CANCER HOSPITAL, Greece
Background & objectives: Osteoid osteomas are very rare benign bone
tumours (3%) and the extra-skeletal osteoid osteoma in the lung is even
rarer. Lung tumours with osseous elements have been described
(hamartoma, amyloid tumour, reactive lesions - osseous metaplasia).
Methods: Osteoid osteomas are benign tumours and require distinction
from other benign lesions. We present a 77-years-old woman admitted to
our hospital with a productive cough two months. Lung CT showed a
solitary well-circumscribed tumour up to 2,5cm in diameter in the right
upper lobe. The patient underwent VATS resection.
Results: On microscopic examination, the lesion comprised mainly of
amorphous material resembling immature osteoid with the a few osteo-
cytes, while at the periphery osteoclasts were identified. Scattered spaces
with Havers structure were present. The cell proliferation index (Ki-67)
was <1%.
Conclusion: Extra-skeletal osteoid osteoma of the lung is an extremely
rare entity that may be associated with Gardner syndrome (presence of
multiple polyps of the colon or carcinoma of the colon, in combination
with extra-intestinal lesions such as desmoid tumours, osteomas, epider-
moid cysts or fibromatosis).

Pleomorphic epithelioid leiomyosarcoma of the lung
G. Stanc*, E. Souka, N. Novkovic, L. Karelis, N. Bolanos, N.
Baltayiannis, C. Valavanis
*METAXA CANCER HOSPITAL, Greece
Background & objectives: Lung sarcomas are rare neoplasms, compris-
ing only 0.2-0.5% of all lung malignancies. Leiomyosarcomas are the
most common and their diagnosis is a challenge for the pathologist.
Virchows Arch
Methods: We present the case of a 70-year-old female, who underwent
surgical resection (VATS) for a lung mass. On gross examination of the
pulmonary parenchyma, a white circumscribed tumour up to 2.5cm. in
greatest diameter was found.
Results: On microscopic examination the tumour was composed of mes-
enchymal epithelioid cells with marked nuclear pleomorphism, nuclear
inclusions, presence of multinucleated giant cells, and increased mitotic
activity. Immunohistochemistry was performed: SMA, HHF-35,
Calponin, Desmin, EMA, CKAE1 / AE3, CK7, CK8 / 18, which con-
firmed the morphological findings. Primary lung leiomyosarcomas
(PPLs) are rare, rapidly growing tumours with slow rate of metastasis.
They are differentiated in relation to their origin: from the pulmonary
parenchyma, the bronchial tree, and the pulmonary artery.
Conclusion: The morphological and immunohistochemical findings, in
combination with the absence of a known history of leiomyosarcoma
from the gynaecological tract are in favour of the pleomorphic epithelioid
PPL, parenchymal type. Valid screening offers appropriate treatment and
the possibility of improving the prognosis. The indicated therapeutic ap-
proach is surgical removal with adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

Pulmonary hamartoma - ten-year single centre study
J. Stojsic*, J. Markovic, M. Popović
*University Clinical Center of Serbia, Serbia
Background & objectives: Pulmonary hamartoma is common benign
neoplasm composed of cartilage, connective tissue, smooth-muscle and
fat tissue. For pathologists, diagnosis is routinely easy, unless hamartoma
is composed of the cells of only one origin.
Methods: We analysed 168 pulmonary hamartomas regarding their gen-
der and age distribution, their size, growth pattern and morphology, di-
agnosed last ten-year period, from 2011. to 2020.
Results: Pulmonary hamartomas were diagnosed in 81(48.2%) females
and 87(51.8%) males. Average age was Ẋ=58.7 (Mdn=64), ranged from
24- to 74-year-old. The average measure of the greatest diameter of
hamartoma was Ẋ=20.3mm (Mdn=17mm), ranged from 8mm to
100mm. The great majority were localized intrapulmonary. Endoluminal
growth pattern was found in 4 patients (2.4%). Monomorphic feature of
pulmonary hamartoma were diagnosed: five leiomyoma-, 4 lipoma-, one
fibroma- and chondroma-like hamartoma. Pulmonary hamartoma was ac-
cidental finding associated with 9 lung tumours (4 adenocarcinoma, 4
squamous cell carcinomas, 1 MALToma), one interstitial lung disease
(NSIP), 3 tuberculomas and one with thymoma.
Conclusion: Absence of nuclear polymorphism and mitoses distinguish
metastatic mesenchymal tumours from monomorphic pulmonary
hamartoma. Pulmonary hamartoma could be accidental finding, associat-
ed with the other thoracic tumours. Diagnosis of pulmonary hamartoma
eliminates surgeons’ suspicion of metastatic tumour in the lungs accord-
ing to their radiological findings.

A modular approach to the study of the morphogenesis of atelectasis
in radio-induced lung injury
S. Timofeev*, Y. Kirillov, O. Rosenberg
*FSBSI Research Institute of Human Morphology, Moscow, Russia
Background & objectives: Among the morphofunctional systems of
humans and animals, the lungs, due to the implementation of the oxygen
effect, are the most sensitive to ionizing radiation. Radiation pneumonitis,
atelectasis, lung fibrosis may develop approximately in 30% of cases after
radiation exposure.
Methods: A total of 258 experimental animals (white non-linear male
rats aged 14-18 weeks, weighing 200-220 grams) were used in the exper-
iments. Radio-induced exposure was simulated on 216. The control
group consisted of 42 animals, which were simulated by the irradiation
procedure and used to assess the total content of surfactant and its frac-
tions in accordance with the timing of the experiment.
Results: The dynamics of changes in the morphological substrate of the
pulmonary parenchyma is presented in the form of peculiar modules-
blocks, morphologically complete in quantitative and qualitative terms
of complexes of changes that are realized in the lungs. In total, 6 modules
were identified: the formation of initial (background) preаtelelectatic
changes in the lung tissue; implementation of radial alterations in the
subpleural parts of the lung, the formation of subpleural mono-factorial
atelectasis; implementation of radial alterations in the intrapulmonary
parts of the lung, the formation of intrapulmonary multifactor atelectasis;
persistence, transformation and modification atelectasis; permission and/
or organization of atelectasis, complete (restitution) or incomplete
(substitution) restoration of lung tissue.
Conclusion: The development of subpleural atelectasis was associated
with a decrease of pulmonary surfactant in the fluid of the broncho-
alveolar lavage, intrapulmonary atelectasis - the attachment of the ob-
structive mechanism. Given the defining nature of surfactant deficiency
in the onset and development of lung atelectasis, it seems appropriate to
use it for prophylactic purposes, immediately after radiation exposure in
order to eliminate losses as a result of radiolysis of phospholipids and
other surfactant components under the action of ionizing radiation.

Cellular angiofibroma: unusual presentation
H. Abo Samra*, A. Ammar
*Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar
Background & objectives: Cellular angiofibroma (CA) is a rare, benign,
cellular, and highly vascularized fibroblastic neoplasm. This tumour oc-
curs mainly in the vulvar region in females and in the inguinoscrotal
region in males. The tumour is equally affecting males and females.
Methods: We herein present a case of 45-year-old gentleman who was
found to have a lesion occupying the subcutaneous compartment of right
buttock. This case was difficult to diagnose on core biopsy. Therefore, it
was recommended to be resected entirely with adequate margins to reach
a final diagnosis.
Results: The histologic appearance was deceiving and showed similari-
ties among different tumours (to name some; mammary type
myofibroblastoma, angiomyofibroblastoma, aggressive angiomyxoma)
which hampered revealing the definitive diagnosis. Therefore, the immu-
nohistochemical studies have been helpful in differentiating this tumour
from other entities. By reviewing the histology along with the immuno-
histochemical studies, a diagnosis of cellular angiofibroma was yielded.
Conclusion: CA represents a distinct benign neoplasm with a broad
anatomic distribution even if it is mainly localized in the vulvo-perineal
and inguinoscrotal area. This lesion may exhibit some variations in its
phenotypic features, as well as atypia and morphologic features of sarco-
matous transformation but these characteristics seem not to predispose to
a malignant transformation or recurrences. For these reasons, a treatment
of simple local excision appears to be adequate and effective to avoid
recurrences and injuries to surrounding tissues.

Malignant gastrointestinal neuroectodermal tumour: a case report
J. Azevedo*, D. Gigliano, A. Coutada, J. Vaz Silva, J. Castro, J. Vieira,
M. Afonso
*Pathology Department of the Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto,
Portugal
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Malignant gastrointestinal neuroectodermal
tumour (GNET) is an uncommon mesenchymal neoplasm of the gastro-
intestinal tract with less than 100 cases reported in literature. This entity
has distinctive clinical, histologic, immunophenotypic and molecular fea-
tures, and represents an aggressive form of neuroectodermal tumour.
Methods: 35-year-old male with abdominal pain, bilious vomiting,
melena, fatigue and weight loss. Endoscopic evaluation detected no ab-
normalities. Abdominal CT-scan revealed various collapsed jejunal loops
and lymphadenopathies in the mesentery. Surgical excision was per-
formed. The resected segment of small bowel showed a 3.6x3.5cm ulcer-
ative neoplasia with raised margins, invading serosa and configuring an
adherent process to the bowel loops.
Results: Histology showed high grade malignant neoplasm in the
muscularis propria of the intestine with mucosal ulceration and adipose
tissue invasion. Neoplastic cells were epithelioid with eosinophilic cyto-
plasm, arranged in sheets and small aggregates. Scattered osteoclast-like
multinucleated giant cells were seen. Pleomorphism was moderate, mitotic
rate was high and necrosis was absent. Immunohistochemistry showed
diffuse expression for S100 and SOX10 and negativity for HMB45,
Melan A, GFAP, CD34, CD117, DOG1, SMA, desmin, EMA,
cytokeratins, synaptophysin and chromogranin A. H3K27me3 and INI1
were retained. EWSR1 gene rearrangement was detected by FISH,
allowing a diagnosis of GNET. Patient underwent chemotherapy and sur-
gical resection of jejunal recurrence. A year after diagnosis, he is alive.
Conclusion: Previously considered a “clear cell sarcoma-like tumour of the
gastrointestinal tract”, GNET has recently been described as a different
entity with its own morphological, immunohistochemistry and genetic fea-
tures. Due to its rarity it can easily be misdiagnosed by the pathologist.
Immunohistochemical studies with epithelial, neural and melanocytic
markers and genetic testing are required for a correct diagnosis. More stud-
ies are needed in order to better understand the pathogenesis and prognosis.

A rare case of pseudomyogenic haemangioendothelioma
with unicentric involvement
M.A. Bara*, D.C. Terzea, C. Comsa
*Emergency University Hospital Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Pseudomyogenic haemangioendothelioma
(PMH) is a very rare, low-grade vascular tumour, with approximately
130 cases described in the literature. PMH is often presented as a multi-
focal disease, with involvement of the bone in only 14% of all cases.
Methods: A 17-year-old boy presented with a 5-month history of lateral
lower leg pain, initially of low-intensity and triggered by effort, later of
high intensity and continuous, radiating into the lower back and heel. The
boy underwent several radiologic investigations, which demonstrated a
well-defined lytic lesion measuring 1,8/0,8 cm, involving the left proxi-
mal fibular epiphysis. Surgical treatment was performed.
Results: Histologic examination showed woven bone and fibro-adipose
tissue with infiltrating sheets of epithelioid and spindled cells with abundant
eosinophilic cytoplasm, round nuclei with prominent nucleoli and scarce
mitotic activity. At immunohistochemical examination, the tumour cells
showed diffuse expression of AE1/AE3, vimentin, FLI1, INI1, ERG, with
a low ki67 proliferation index of 6% and the diagnosis of PMH was made.
Follow up computed tomography (CT) with multiplaner reconstruction
(MPR) and 3D CT, 8 months after resection, showed post-surgical mod-
ifications, without evidence of tumour recurrence.
Conclusion: Although PMH was recognizes recently as a distinctive
entity with indolent behaviour, the correct recognition is very important
because is a locally recurrent and rarely metastasizing tumour. Even
though PMH is usually located in cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue,
the probability of bone involvement must not be omitted. Considering
its absence of vascular differentiation characteristics on hematoxylin-
eosin stain, the diagnosis of PMH can be easily mistaken, and interpreted
as other lesion with different treatment and prognosis.

A. Ben Abdelkadher, B. Sriha, M. Mokni
*Department of pathology, Farhat Hached hospital, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Aggressive angiomyxoma is a rare and be-
nign mesenchymal tumour that most commonly arises in the lower genital
tract, perineum and pelvis of women. The aim of the study is to discuss
clinicopathological features of this disease.
Methods: A 54-year-old female was presented with a 14 cm, slowly
growing, and painless mass of the left buttock. There is no familiar or
personal history. An excision of the mass was practiced.
Results: We received a well-circumscribed, blue grey and myxoid mass.
Its size was about 14.5 cm. The histological examination revealed locally
infiltrative and hypocellular mass composed of spindle to stellate cells
and dilated capillaries. The tumour cells have scanty cytoplasm and bland
chromatin with small nucleoli. Mitosis was rare. There is no necrosis. At
immunohistochemistry, the tumour cells were positive for oestrogen re-
ceptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), smooth muscle actin (SMA),
Desmin and CD34 but were negative for MDM2. The patient was rapidly
recovered without any recurrence.
Conclusion: Aggressive angiomyxoma is a rare tumour of the soft
tissue. It mainly occurs on the vagina, vulva, pelvic cavity, perineum
and hips in reproductive female aging from 30 to 40 years old. It is a
hypocellular myxoid tumour with bland spindle cells and prominent
variably sized vessels. Overexpression of HMGA2 in immunohisto-
chemistry confirms the diagnosis. This tumour is aggressive due to its
nature of local infiltration and recurrence. Distant metastasis and
death are exceptional.

Chordoma: a report of six cases and a literature review
N. Ben Abdeljelil*, B. Lahbacha, A. Bellalah, C. Chabaane, R. Hadhri,
M. Njima
*Department of Pathology, Chu Fattouma Bourguiba Monastir, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Chordoma is an uncommon malignant tu-
mour. It accounts for 1% of intracranial tumours and 4% of all primary
bone tumours. It is classified into conventional, dedifferentiated and
chondroid chordoma.
Our aim is to highlight clinical and pathological features of chordoma.
Methods: We report 6 cases of chordoma collected over a period of 8
years (2013-2021) in the department of pathology of the university hos-
pital of Monastir. All histological types were included.
Results: Patient’s ages ranged from 45 to 82 years with sex ratio =
2/1.Chordoma was located in the cervical vertebra in one patient and in
the skull base in two patients. Two chordomas arised in the sacrococcygeal
area whereas one arised in the pelvic region. Microscopically, 4 cases of
chordomas were of conventional type and two of chondroid type. Tumour
shows lobular architecture. Tumour cells were arranged in cords and nests
with mixed epithelioid and physaliphorus features. Mild nuclear atypia was
found in three of cases. The stroma was either myxoid or chondromyxoid.
In immunohistochemistry, tumour cells stained positively for keratin, epi-
thelial membrane antigen and S100 protein.
Conclusion: Chordoma is a malignant tumour that mainly involves bones
of axial skeleton but may arise in extra axial areas. It is characterized by a
slow progression with local aggressive character. The chondroid variant
accounts for 4% of chordoma cases with a better prognosis than other
chordoma variants.
Treatment dilemma leads to a high rate of local relapse and distant me-
tastases. Molecular targeted therapy is an option for advanced chordoma,
but its therapeutic efficacy and safety have not been investigated
systematically.

Coelho, J.R. Vizcaíno
*Centro Hospitalar e Universitário do Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Echinococcosis (hydatidosis) is a parasitic
and zoonotic disease of animals and humans, prevalent throughout much
of the world. The cause is Echinococcus granuloses. Almost all organs
and systems can be involvement. The incidence of bone echinococcosis is
low (3%).
Methods: A 53-year-old construction painter was referred with com-
plaints of pain in the right knee, with progressive oedema, without fever
and unresponsive to analgesic therapy.
The TAC and RMN images showed, at the distal femur, a multicystic
lesion, without hydro-air levels and heterogeneous contrast uptake. It
caused cortical disruption extending to the soft tissues, raising the possi-
bility of osteosarcoma.
Results: A 19x10 x 9 cm distal femur segment, circumferentially covered
with muscle and adipose tissues, was received. A cut section showed an
area of ill-defined limits, 15x7x7 cm, consisting of multiple cavitated and
yellowish areas, some with a peripheral gelatinous membrane, which
were distributed in the bone marrow, bone cortex and adjacent soft
tissues.
Microscopically, an extensive granulomatous reaction was observed, re-
lated to abundant hyaline cellular lamellar structures (ectocysts), often
with necrotic proliferating membranes. Representations of rare scolices
were also identified. The lesion invaded the periosseous, muscle and
adipose tissues and also the cortical and medullary bone. The lesion
was intersected by the surgical margins.
Conclusion: Osseous hydatidosis is a rare occurrence of hydatid disease.
Clinically it does not present distinctive symptoms and specific charac-
teristics on x ray or CT which are similar to other entities. Because of the
poor results with medical treatment, osseous hydatidosis must be treated
by a radical operation with wide excision, adapted to each localization.
Complete surgical eradication is rarely possible. The prognosis and treat-
ment of osseous hydatidosis is similar to a locally malignant lesion.

High-grade chondrosarcoma arising in a preexisting enchondroma:
a case report
A. Cohn*, D.M. Pop, R.S. Cismasiu
*Emergency University Hospital, Bucharest, Romania
Background & objectives: Chondrosarcoma is a malignant cartilagi-
nous tumour, which may arise from a pre-existing atypical cartilaginous
tumour (ACT). The aim of this study is to present a case of conventional
high-grade chondrosarcoma developed on a previously diagnosed
enchondroma.
Methods: A 73-year-old female patient was admitted at “Foisor”
Orthopaedics Hospital for 3-year-long lasting pain and loss of function
in the right knee. Ten years before, patient was discovered with a 4 cm
tumour mass in the right distal femur, which was treated with intralesional
curettage and bone cement reconstruction. The lesion was diagnosed
microscopically as an enchondroma.
Results: After ten years, imaging findings revealed an expansile tumour
mass of 13/7/4 cm, localized in the distal femur, with ill-defined margins,
extending into adjacent soft tissue, associated with pathologic fracture. The
patient underwent surgical treatment with “en bloc” resection of the distal
femur and tumour prosthesis. Macroscopically, the neoplasm was filling
the entire medullary cavity with cortical destruction and soft tissue inva-
sion. Microscopic examination showed a cartilaginous tumour, with infil-
trative growth pattern and cytologic atypia, corresponding to high-grade
chondrosarcoma. Revising the initial slides, no cytologic atypia or features
of invasion could contradict the initial diagnosis of enchondroma.
Conclusion: There is a significant histologic overlap between enchon-
dromas and atypical cartilaginous tumours, therefore radiographic and
clinical data, such as dull continuous pain, are highly suggestive of ma-
lignant transformation. Clinical history and evolution of the case indicate
that the initial tumour could have been an ACT, misdiagnosed due to lack
of invasive features on the excisional biopsy. Even if solitary
enchondromas have a very low risk of malignant transformation, benign
cartilaginous tumours arising in older individuals should be carefully
managed.

Dedifferentiated chordoma of thoracic spinal region: case report of a
rare entity
S. Ekmekci*, B.G. Özamrak, G. Gül, E.E. Pala
*University of Health Sciences Turkey, Tepecik Research and Training
Hospital, Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Chordomas are tumours of notochordal ori-
gin and are localized in axial skeleton. Dedifferentiated chordomas are
biphasic tumours, rare subtype of chordomas , consisting of high grade
sarcomatous components and conventional chordoma areas. We present a
case of such morphologic appearance.
Methods: 74-year-old-male with back pain was referred to our neurosur-
gery clinic, whom had a history of posterior thoracic instrumentation
surgery at 2016, due to pathological fracture at T12. MR imaging dem-
onstrated a 78x70 mm mass lesion at T11-T12, extending to neural fora-
men from right side of vertebral body which exhibited hyperintensity at
T2 weighted images. Removal of lesion was performed.
Results: Fragmented resection material was 6x5x3 cm in total size,
consisting of solid areas of tan/white colour with haemorrhage. Upon his-
topathological examination; conventional chordoid areas consisting of
chords/sheets of cells of physaliphorous morphology arranged in lobules
interspaced with chondromyxoid matrix were seen. Mixed with such areas,
multiple sarcomatoid foci of various morphologies (consisting of spindle
cells, epithelioid cells, lipoid cells) were present. Invasion of bone, muscle
and connective tissue by tumour cells was observed. Mitotic count was 6
mitoses/10 HPF. Small foci of necrosis (%5) was present. Pancytokeratin,
EMA, S100 immunohistochemistry showed focal positivity in chordoid
areas. Diagnosis of dedifferentiated chordoma was established.
Conclusion: Chordomas are slowly growing tumours with relatively
good clinical behaviour, while dedifferentiated chordomas are tumours
with aggressive clinical behaviour and high metastasis potential. It is
important to recognise this rare entity which can cause diagnostic chal-
lenges, especially in small biopsy specimens due to its broad morphologic
and immunophenotypic spectrum of findings.

*2nd Department of Pathology, National and Kapodistrian University of
Athens School of Medicine, “Attikon” University Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Mesenteric leiomyosarcoma is a malignant
mesenchymal tumour showing differentiation towards smooth muscle. It
occurs very rarely, less than 20 having been reported so far. We herewith
report one case of leiomyosarcoma of the mesentery showing positive
staining for DOG1.
Methods: A 43-year-old female was admitted to our hospital due to a
sizeable mesenteric mass discovered during a uterine myomectomy proce-
dure. CT showed the 5.5cm large tumour to be well-circumscribed, with
pushing borders. The tumour was resected with adequate margins. On gross
examination, the tumour was well-circumscribed, with a solid cut surface.
Results: On microscopic examination, the tumour consisted of atypical
spindle cells arranged in fascicles with moderate pleomorphism and up to
Virchows Arch
5 mitoses per 10 high power fields. Necrosis was not observed. Tumour
cells were immunostained for SMA, desmin, and DOG-1 and negative for
CD34, CD117(C-KIT) and S100. Molecular analysis of KIT and PDGFRA
genes showed no mutation. Based on histological, immunohistochemical
and molecular findings, our diagnosis was malignant mesenchymal tumour
consistent with low-grade leiomyosarcoma of the mesentery.
Conclusion: Mesenteric LMS is an infrequent entity. The principal differ-
entialdiagnosisisgastrointestinalstromaltumour(GIST),themostcommon
mesenchymal tumour of the digestive tract. Precise diagnosis is essential
since treatment and prognosis differ. CD117 and DOG1 positivity are con-
sideredtobe the goldstandardforGIST diagnosis. Asevidencedbythecase
we present, molecular analysis is necessary to make the correct diagnosis in
case morphological and immunohistochemical findings are inconclusive.

The many shapes of schwannoma: a morphological study
D. João*, A. Sanches, C. Meireles
*Department of Anatomic Pathology, Centro Hospitalar de Vila Nova de
Gaia/Espinho, Porto, Portugal
Background & objectives: Schwannoma is a benign nerve sheath tu-
mour of differentiated schwann cells. The World Health Organization
defines several subtypes, including ancient, cellular, plexiform, epitheli-
oid and microcystic schwannoma. We present a unique case which si-
multaneously displays many different morphologies and compare them.
Methods: The patient is a 39-year-old male with no prior medical history of
interest. He was referred to our institution because of a pelvic tumefaction. A
computed tomography scan revealed the presence of a well-defined pelvic
tumour, measuring up to 14cm, exhibiting signs of haemorrhage and no evi-
dence of invasion.The lesionwasexcisedandsenttothe pathologydepartment.
Results: Two lobulated and encapsulated nodules were received.
Microscopically, an epithelial neoplasm with pushing borders and variable
cellularity was found. The tumour was comprised of spindle cells, with wavy
or oval and vesicular nuclei, arranged in variable sized fascicles, with a sur-
rounding stroma partly fibrillary and partly myxoid. Areas with centrally
hyalinized rosetoid aggregates and pseudoglandular spaces were identified.
Focally, mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate, haemorrhage, thrombosis, calci-
fication, hyaline degeneration and ischemic necrosis could be observed.
Immunostaining was positive for S100, SOX10, GFAP, EMA, CD10,
CD34 and CD99. INI1 retained expression. A diagnosis of ancient
schwannoma was rendered, strikingly displaying large concomitant areas of
pseudoglandular, neuroblastoma-like, plexiform and microcystic schwannoma.
Conclusion: The array of patterns and cytologic features schwannomas
can exhibit is astounding, and is quite peculiar to find so many in a single
case. It is of the utmost importance to recognize these findings as still
within the spectrum, since differential diagnosis includes malignancies
such as spindle cell sarcoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tu-
mour. Although malignization of schwannoma is exceedingly rare, the
presence of foci of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour,
angiosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma may occur.

Background & objectives: Laryngeal sarcomas constitute an extremely
rare entity in the head and neck oncology field. Furthermore, most are histo-
logically chondrosarcomas and the osteogenic form remains a true rarity.
Methods: Our patient, a 73-year-old Japanese man, presented with
hoarseness. Laryngoscopy showed a solid tumour of the right vocal cord.
Biopsy of this lesion was undertaken, yielding a histological diagnosis of
atypical cellular proliferation, suggesting a sarcoma or squamous cell
carcinoma with sarcomatoid changes. Computed tomography revealed a
right laryngeal nodule, 10x8 mm in size, with no evidence of metastasis.
Results: Tumourectomy via direct laryngoscopy was performed. The cut
surface of the excised specimen contained a relatively well-
circumscribed, greyish-white, solid tumour, measuring 15x13x11 mm.
This lesion was histopathologically composed of short-spindle atypical
cells, with irregularly shaped, hyperchromatic nuclei. Ten mitotic figures
were detected per 10HPF. Osteoid formation was occasionally observed,
accompanied by focal calcium deposition. Immunohistochemical exam-
inations revealed neoplastic cells to be positive for vimentin and
SMARCB1/INI1 (BAF47), focally reactive for p63, and negative for
p40, cytokeratin 5/6, AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, S-100, MDM2, CDK4, D34,
CD68, STAT6, α-SMA and desmin. The Ki67 (MIB-1) labelling index
was 51.2%, and p53 showed a random pattern. Based on these patholog-
ical findings, we diagnosed extra skeletal osteosarcoma.
Conclusion: Vocal cord enlargement surgery was subsequently per-
formed, and the absence of residual cancer was confirmed histologically.
The patient remains alive and well, with neither recurrence nor metastasis,
10 months after surgery. Osteosarcoma of the larynx is typically an ex-
tremely aggressive neoplasm that metastasizes early, has a propensity for
hematogenous spread and also has a marked tendency to recur. Fortunately,
our current patient presented with trachyphonia and was recognized in the
early stage, allowing a complete remission to be achieved.

Low grade osteosarcoma associated with fibrous dysplasia: a case
report
F. Kecilioglu*, Z.B. Erdem, S. Bagbudar, S. Ogreden, B. Pehlivanoglu
*Department of Pathology, Basaksehir Cam and Sakura City Hospital,
University of Health Sciences, Basaksehir, Turkey
Background & objectives: Osteosarcoma, the most common primary
malignant tumour of bone, usually occurs in the second decade of life and
in long bones of upper or lower extremities. Rarely, it may arise in the jaw
and in older patients.
Methods: Here, a young male patient with maxillary osteosarcoma is
presented.
Results: A 42-year-old male presented with a maxillary mass which was
diagnosed as fibrous dysplasia 3 years ago. The bone destructing, hard
palate-invading mass in the right maxillary sinus was excised in the second
year of the follow-up. The tumour was reported to bear histopathological
features of fibrous dysplasia with areas suspicious of a low-grade osteosar-
coma. Six months later, maxillectomy was performed due to recurrence.
Macroscopic examination revealed an 8.8 cm, tan-yellowish tumour. The
tumour was mainly composed of spindle cells with osteoid formation and
areas reminiscent of fibrous dysplasia. Immunohistochemically, tumour
cells were positive for CDK4 with a Ki67 index of 15%. A diagnosis of
low-grade osteosarcoma was made.
Conclusion: Osteosarcoma of the maxilla is a rare entity and may occa-
sionally be preceded and/or accompanied by lesions such as fibrous dys-
plasia. In some cases, distinguishing between fibrous dysplasia and low-
grade osteosarcoma may be challenging which may require application of
MDM2 and/or CDK4 immunohistochemistry, and their positivity indi-
cates a diagnosis of low grade osteosarcoma.

Periosteal osteosarcoma with diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastasis:
A case report
A. Kökceli*, F. Özpuyan, M. Çiftdemir, F.E. Ustabaşıoğlu
*Trakya University, Turkey
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Periosteal osteosarcoma is a rare malignant
bone tumour arising from the bone cortical surface which is seen in
mostly 20 to 30 of age person. Periosteal osteosarcoma is a rare malignant
bone tumour arising from the bone cortical surface.
Methods: Our case is a 47-year-old woman who presenting with a mass in
the posterior of right thigh for 3 months. In the pathological analysis of the
resected mass, sclerotic-looking areas are seen in the central region of the
tumour. A lesion compatible with well-circumscribed parosteal osteosarco-
ma showing development the bone surface was detected on knee radio-
graph an MRI.
Results: The tumour was fully resected and prothesis was planted in the
proximal tibia. In the histologic examination, the mass with an osteoblas-
tic appearance invading the striated muscle is detected in the periphery of
the tumour. The resected tumour mass was in chondroblastic character
and endochondral ossification areas were detected. Following the opera-
tion developed prosthesis infection. Bilateral lung metastases and residue
metastatic areas lymph node were detected in the patient after tumour
resection.
Periosteal osteosarcomas are treated with wide excision. Their
prognosis is better than that of high-grade intramedullary or
high-grade surface osteosarcomas but worse than that of parosteal
osteosarcomas.
Conclusion: Periosteal osteosarcomas are a malignancy with a long life
expectancy, unlike classical osteosarcomas, with its early stage and treat-
ment. Patients with bilateral lung metastases have a worse prognosis
unlike parosteal osteosarcomas. The factors that significantly affect the
prognosis in typical low-grade osteosarcomas are infection secondary to
the prosthesis and diffuse metastases. The risk of developing osteomye-
litis is high in patients with prosthetic site infection despite repetitive
debridements.

Spinal osteosarcoma: a rare localization
M. Krifa*, W. Majdoub, E. Ben Ammou, A. Bouriga, A. Baccouche, J.
Pitroipa, H. Hamchi, S. Hmissa
*University Hospital of Sahloul, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Although osteosarcoma represents the sec-
ond most common primary bone tumour, spinal involvement is rare,
accounting for 3%–5% of all osteosarcomas. The objective of this report
is to emphasize the diagnostic problem.
Methods: It was about a 56-year-old man, complaining from a low back
pain, radiating to the left lower limb and associated to a spinal stiffness. It
was evolving for two months. He underwent a spinal MRI showing an
osteolytic, exophytic mass of L5 left vertebrae and extended to soft tissue.
Results: Pathological examination of the biopsy, showed a malignant
tumour. The neoplastic cells were compressed and trapped in an osteoid
matrix associated to multi-nucleated cells. These cells showed irregular
hyperchromatic nuclei with increased mitotic activity. Some calcifica-
tions were noted. After a confrontation with the radiological data, we
retained the diagnosis of L5 osteosarcoma.
Conclusion: Osteosarcoma of the spine accounts for 3 to 5% of primary
spinal tumours. It is distinguished by a peak of incidence located in the
fifth decade, unlike the other localizations. Pathological diagnostic may
be difficult on small biopsy specimens. The diagnosis of vertebral spinal
osteosarcoma is based on the different microscopic aspects. However, the
confrontation for this localization, both radiological and pathological, is
essential.

Epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma: report of a new
case of a rare entity with challenging diagnosis
Z. Lajmi*, W. Majdoub, A. Ben Mabrouk, E. Ben Ammou, H. Hamchi,
T. Dahmoul, A. Bdioui, S. Hmissa
*Sahloul Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic
sarcoma(EIMS) is a rare and recently defined neoplasm as an aggressive
subtype of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT) which has dis-
tinctive morphological features. It can be missed because of the lack of
familiarity of pathologists with this entity.
Methods: A 43-year-old man presented with chest pain and productive
cough. The thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT revealed right pleurisy with
pulmonary, hepatic and splenic metastasis. These features were
consisting with the diagnosis of mesothelioma. Parenchymal biopsies of
the middle and upper lobes of the right lung were performed.
Results: On microscopic examination, the tumour was composed pre-
dominantly of large round to epithelioid cells with vesicular nuclei, prom-
inent nucleoli and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Tumour cells were arranged in
clusters or sheets embedded in a myxoid stroma containing prominent
neutrophils and lymphocytes. The plasma cells were absent. Mitotic fig-
ures were multiple with atypical forms. A minor component of spindle
cells was present in focal areas. Immunohistochemical study was per-
formed. Tumour cells were positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALK) with a nuclear membrane pattern, desmin, vimentin and INI-1
and focally positive for EMA. Pan-cytokeratin, melan-A, HMB45,
ACE, WT1, calretinin, CD45, CK7, CK20, CK5/6 and D2-40 were neg-
ative. Thus, the diagnostic of EIMS was retained.
Conclusion: EIMS can be diagnosed in combination with morphologic
features and an appropriate immunohistochemical panel. The striking
feature of EIMS is the presence of obvious inflammatory infiltrates fre-
quently composed of neutrophils. All tumours almost contained a small
amount of spindle cell component. On immunohistochemistry, this tu-
mour is characterized by distinctive nuclear membrane or perinuclear
ALK staining. Accurate diagnosis is crucial not only for prognostic rea-
sons but also because of the potential for treatment with targeted therapies
such as ALK inhibitors.

Soft tissue leiomyosarcoma: a clinical-pathological study of six cases
from southern Tunisia with literature review
S. Makni*, I. Bahri, I. Saguem, M. Walha, M. Zghal, L. Ayadi, T.
Boudawara, M. Mellouli
*Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a malignant neo-
plasm composed of cells showing smooth muscle differentiation. The
most common location is the retroperitoneum, soft tissue sites are less
common. The aim is to analyse the epidemiological and histopathological
characteristics of this entity.
Methods: Six cases were identified as LMS of soft tissue at our depart-
ment over a period of 11 years (2009-2020). Their demographical and
pathological characteristics were retrospectively reviewed.
Results: Mean age of patients was 62,33 years old (extreme: 39-91). Sex
ratio: 0,5 (2men/4women). Different locations were: lower limbs (4cases),
upper limbs (1case), and paravertebral (1case). Anatomopathological study
is comparable in all patients: Macroscopically, mean tumour size was 6 cm
(extreme: 3-12,8 cm). It was an indurated whorled yellowish mass, with
necrotic and haemorrhagic changes. Histologically: This is a moderate to
high density proliferation of entangled bundles of spindle cells with large
atypical nuclei. Mitoses were numerous with focal necrosis.
Immunohistochemical study showed positivity for AML and h-
caldesmon in all cases, and desmin in 3 cases. FNCLCC grade was 2 in 4
cases and 3 in 2 cases.
Conclusion: LMS is a rare subtype of soft tissue sarcoma, can occur in
almost any part of the body. Common locations include the abdomen,
retroperitoneum, larger blood vessels, and the uterus. LMS is less com-
mon in the extremities compared with other sarcoma subtypes, account-
ing for 10% to 15% of limb sarcomas. The incidence increases with age.
Histologic grade, tumour size, and tumour depth are the three major clinic
pathologic prognostic factors.

Boudawara, R. Kallel
*Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most com-
monsofttissue sarcoma ofchildrenandrepresentsa high-grade neoplasm. It
is not limited to skeletal muscle, and show diverse clinical presentations,
usually related to mass effect. Histologic features of RMS are variable.
Methods: The histological and immunohistochemical features of 15
cases of RMS were described with a review of the related literature.
These cases were diagnosed in our department of pathology between
1995 and 2021.
Results: Patients were aged between 2 and 84 years (mean age: 45 years).
The study included 9 men and 6 women (SR= 1,5). The most affected site
was thigh (4 cases) followed by leg (3 cases). The most frequent subtype
was pleomorphic (6 cases) followed by embryonal (4 cases) then alveolar
(3 cases). Pleomorphic RMS affects older patients. While embryonal sub-
type affects young patients. Immunohistochemical study was performed to
help make the diagnosis. Desmine and myogenin were positive in all cases,
while vimentin was positive in 12 cases. Only two patients had metastases,
one of spinal localization the other multiple metastases of pulmonary and
retroperitoneal localization.
Conclusion: RMS is a malignant neoplasm in which tumour cells have a
propensity for myogenic differentiation. The two major RMS subtypes
are: alveolar and embryonal. Various classification systems including
age, stage, and tumour site have been used in risk stratification.
Histologic subtype has been a key variable, and patients with alveolar
RMS were considered higher risk than those with embryonal RMS. New
histologic and molecular subtypes such as MYOD1-mutated RMS can
lead to a better prognostic classification of RMS.

Primary leiomyosarcoma of bone: a rare diagnostically challenging
bone tumour
K. Murshed*, M.Z. Karzoun, A. Ammar
*Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar
Background & objectives: Leiomyosarcoma is a malignant smooth mus-
cle neoplasm that usually arises from uterus and soft tissue. Its occurrence as
primary bone tumour is extremely rare event. It can be difficult to differen-
tiate from other primary bone neoplasms with spindle cell morphology.
Methods: We describe a 29-year-old female patient who presented with
right knee swelling and pain for 2 months duration and found to have a
bone tumour by imaging studies. We discuss the radiologic and histo-
pathologic features of the tumour. A panel of immunohistochemical
stains were performed on the tru-cut biopsy to determine the line of
differentiation of the tumour.
Results: MRI revealed 8.5 cm intramedullary mass arising from the
metaphysis of right distal femur. Tru-cut biopsy was taken, which re-
vealed low grade spindle cell neoplasm arranged in fascicles and infiltrat-
ing into bone trabeculae and bone marrow spaces. No malignant osteoid
formation was seen. The tumour cells were immunoreactive for smooth
muscle actin, muscle specific actin and calponin but negative for CKAE1/
AE3, S100, CD31, CD34 and Desmin. No uterine or soft tissue masses
were detected by imaging studies. The diagnosis of primary
leiomyosarcoma of bone was rendered. Wide local excision was per-
formed. No local recurrence or distant metastasis were detected upon
follow-up by imaging studies for 2 years.
Conclusion: Primary leiomyosarcoma of bone is an entity that bears
diagnostic difficulty. It is essential to differentiate from other aggressive
primary bone tumours with spindle cell morphology to prevent potential
unnecessary overtreatment.

*First Department of Pathology, Medical School, National and
Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: Erythropoietin-producing human hepatocel-
lular receptors (EPHs), members of the receptor protein-tyrosine kinase
(RTK) superfamily, are implicated in embryonic development and mul-
tiple physiological procedures, including cancer. The clinical significance
of EPH A subgroup members expression in Gastrointestinal Stromal
Tumours (GISTs) was evaluated.
Methods: The expression of EPH-A1, -A2, -A4, -A5 and -A6 was
assessed immunohistochemically on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue sections obtained from 43 GIST patients (27 males, 16 females; age
41-90 years). The association between EPHAs positivity and expression
as histoscore (HSC, staining intensity and percentage of positive tumour
cells) was correlated with patients’ clinicopathological parameters.
Results: EPH-A1, -A2, -A4 and -A6 were expressed in 41 (95%),
43(100%), 41(95%), and 25(58%) out of 43 cases, respectively, exhibiting
both cytoplasmic and nuclear staining, except for EPH-A6 (only nuclear
staining). EPH-A5 was not expressed. EPH-A1 nuclear positivity correlat-
ed with epithelioid tumour cell morphology (p=0.021), while high cyto-
plasmic HSC associated with high mitotic rate (p=0.012) and advanced
prognostic group (p=0.03). EPH-A2 had the dominating effect on GIST
clinical profile, as nuclear positivity inversely associated with stage, mitotic
rate and prognostic group (p=0.007, p=0.037 and p=0.026, respectively).
Moreover, EPH-A2 nuclear HSC inversely correlated with stage (p=0.03)
and prognostic group (p=0.048). Lastly, EPHA4 cytoplasmic positivity
correlated with spindle cell morphology (p=0.013).
Conclusion: Our results suggest an association between EPH subgroup A
members expression and GIST histological and clinical profile, which not
only reveals their role in the development of the aforementioned tumours,
but also renders them potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.

A rare case of a soft tissue angiofibroma with GAB1/ABL1 gene
fusion in a 13-year-old patient with associated right-hemibody
anomalies
R. Pirlog*, A. Marie-Cardine, I. Bernardini, E. Angot, J. Sabourin
*UMF "Iuliu Hatieganu" Cluj-Napoca, Romania
Background & objectives: Soft tissue angiofibroma was recently de-
fined as a new tumour type that presents as a slow-growing painless mass.
In 60-80% of tumours, a NCOA2 rearrangement or fusion is present and
in single cases the GAB1/ABL1 fusion was also described.
Methods: A 13-year-old patient presents with an asymptomatic slow-
growing mass of the right thigh and associated cutaneous and mood
anomalies. The magnetic-resonance-imaging highlights an intramuscular
well-demarcated tumour measuring 11x5,5x13 cm, raising the suspicion
of a rhabdomyosarcoma. A guided surgical biopsy was performed. The
sample was analysed in the pathology department by standard histology,
immunohistochemistry, and RNA-sequencing.
Results: The microscopic examination reveals a moderately cellular prolif-
eration consisting of spindle cells with inconspicuous elongated nuclei and
eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumour stroma is fibrous, and the vasculariza-
tion consists of a rich network of small-size capillaries. The tumour has the
following immunohistochemical profile: Actine-, Desmine-, Caldesmone-,
Myogenine-, MyoD1-, PS100-, SOX10-, GFAP-, EMA-, STAT6-, ALK1-,
ROS1-, NTRK-, MDM2-, SATB2-, BRG1+, INI+, BCOR-, CD34-,
CD31-, MUC4-. Ki-67 proliferation index was 5%. The RNA sequencing
using exploratory bioinformatics analysis with a combination of different
specialized gene fusions software identified the GAB1/ABL1 gene fusion.
Virchows Arch
Integrating the morphology, immunohistochemical and molecular profiles
the diagnosis of soft tissue angiofibroma was made.
Conclusion: We present an unusual case of a soft tissue angiofibroma in
a 13-year-old patient. Conventional histology and immunohistochemistry
were not enough to characterize the tumour. Further RNA sequencing
identified the GAB1/ABL1 gene fusion, previously described in very rare
cases of benign paediatric soft tissue tumours including solitary fibrous
tumour, perineurinoma and soft tissue angiofibroma. The unusual asso-
ciation of this soft tissue tumour with dermatological and neurological
anomalies highlights the need for a genetics follow-up for this patient.

cases
S. Poletaeva*, F. Tatyana, V. Plohova, J. Zotova, J. Yunusova
*Samara State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: The aim of study is determine the relation
between pathological features and clinical course of classical non-
proximal type epithelioid sarcoma of the fingers.
Methods: A review of histological picture, IHC (INI-1, EMA, CD99,
CD56, CD34, Cytokeratin 8/18, p63, Cytokeratin 5/6, Cytokeratin
HMW, GFAP, Desmin, Myogenin, Melan A, HMB45, MITF, S-100,
TLE-1, CD117, DOG1, SOX10) from 2 females, 50 and 67 y.o., and
37 y.o. male was carried. Localization: middle phalanx of 2-nd finger;
stump of 5th finger - local recurrence of sarcoma; 2-nd finger.
Results: size of tumors:1 - 3x2.5x1.5cm; 2 - local recurrence of epithelioid
sarcoma, excised 3 years ago - 7х6х4 cm with ulceration, bone destruction,
metastases in axillary lymph nodes. 3- 4x2.5x2.5 cm, skin ulcer 5 mm.
Bone destruction 30х3х3 mm. Histological picture varied: 1 - extensive
zones of coagulation necrosis, abscesses, small fusiform cells. 2 - spindle
and epithelioid cells, collagen deposits, 45 mf/10hpf . 3 - spindle and
epithelioid cells, with pseudo-granulomatous structures with central necro-
sis, osteoid-like stromal collagen, up to 6 mf/1 hpf, 23 mf/10 hpf. Loss of
INI-1 nuclear expression, Cytokeratin 8/18, Cytokeratin 5/6, Cytokeratin
HMW, EMA positive in all cases, focal CD34, GFAP, Desmin - in 1.
Conclusion: Large size of the tumour, high mitotic activity and the ab-
sence of necrosis and granulomas were associated with a more aggressive
clinical course with local recurrence and metastases to the lymph nodes.

Rhabdomyomatous mesenchymal hamartoma: a review of the liter-
ature regarding a case
J.L. Rodríguez Carrillo*, P. Gil Bernabe, G. Silvestre Egea, M.d.C.
Colomés Iess, B. Lago Beack, L. Nájera Botello
*Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Spain
Background & objectives: Rhabdomyomatous Mesenchymal
Hamartoma (RHM) is a rare and usually congenital lesion developed in
dermis and soft tissues. We report a case to aid in the description of
specific clinical-pathological criteria towards correctly characterizing this
rare entity.
Methods: Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded material was evaluated
with 3-micron sections and hematoxylin-eosin staining. An immunohis-
tochemical panel was performed including vascular (CD31, CD34) and
muscle (muscle specific actin, desmin, caldesmon) markers.
Results: We describe a 70-year-old patient with a poorly defined 3 cm
lipomatous nodule in the left nasolabial fold, with perilesional erythema
which had been previously diagnosed with rosacea and venous malfor-
mation / intramuscular haemangioma by microscopic evaluation. Facial
MRI and angiography suggested a vascular tumour or vascular malfor-
mation. No deep tissue infiltration was observed.
We identified a dermal lesion composed of striated muscle fibres at dif-
ferent levels, arranged in a perpendicular disposition to the epidermal
surface, interspersed with abundant blood vessels, mature adipocytes,
immature follicle-sebaceous units, and nervous fibres. It expressed mus-
cle (actin HHF35 and desmin), and vascular markers (CD34 and CD31)
and had a negative S100 and HMB45 expression.
Conclusion: HMR is a rare hamartomatous lesion, associated with
polymalfomative syndromes, with very few cases described. It usually
occurs in the facial and perineal area of children, although it can develop
in adults, as in this case. Diagnostic criteria is based on its congenital
nature, typical location and characteristic arrangement of the striated mus-
cle. An adnexal component, with immature follicle-sebaceous units,
prominent vasculature, and nerve fibres, was seen in our case, making it
more complex than those described so far.

Parachordoma/myoepithelioma of soft tissue at posterior
mediastinum
B. Şimşek*, G. Esendağlı
*Gazi University Medical Faculty, Turkey
Background & objectives: Parachordoma/Myoepithelioma of soft tissue
is a rare tumour localizes mostly at extremities but also in trunk and head
and neck region. Apart from our case there are only two cases located in
mediastinum in the English literature. ...
Methods: ...Histologically tumours show great variety both between
cases and in different locations of a single case. Grossly tumours are
mostly well circumscribed but not encapsulated solid masses.
Histologically, these tumours consist of any composition of spindle, ep-
ithelioid, or vacuolized cells. Immunohistochemically, they show vari-
able staining patterns with cytokeratins and myoepithelial markers.
Mostly seen genetic changes include fusions with EWSR1 gene.
Results: We represent the case of a 62-years-old woman with a well-
demarcated cystic mass of 5x4.5x3cm in the left posterior mediastinum.
Resection material was reported as “mesenchymal tumour” in another cen-
tre and paraffin blocks were sent to our laboratory for re-evaluation.
Microscopically we've seen a well circumscribed cystic tumoral lesion in
a myxoid background, enveloping an area of haemorrhage. Tumour cells
showed mild atypia, some of them showed an epithelioid or spindled mor-
phology with eosinophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei and inconspicuous
nucleoli; others had vacuolized cytoplasms reminiscent of physaliphorous
cells. Immunohistochemically, tumour stained diffusely with S100 and
vimentin, also focally with EMA and CK8/18. Brachyury was negative.
Myoepithelial markers (p63,SMA,GFAP and calponin) were negative.
Conclusion: Differential diagnosis of parachordoma/myoepithelioma of
soft tissue, especially if it develops at an unexpected localization, like our
case, may be difficult. It is also important to take into account the wide
spectrum of histomorphological and immunohistochemical findings, es-
pecially the brachyury stain, for this rare entity.

An unusual case of retroperitoneal cellular schwannoma masquerad-
ing as renal cyst
N. Stavrinou*, I. Nitsios, A. Sykaras, K. Christofidis, E. Gioti, E.
Papagianni
*Evangelismos General Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: A 71-year-old woman presented with fever
and a history of chronic left-sided back pain. Renal ultrasound and MRI
showed a large renal cystic lesion measuring 18 cm. The patient
underwent surgery, and the specimen was sent for pathological
evaluation.
Methods: We received a specimen of left total nephrectomy presenting
an encapsulated cystic lesion measuring 18x15x6 cm with variable thick-
ness of the wall (max diameter 3 cm), attached to the kidney. The tissue
was fixed in 10% buffered formalin, routinely processed and embedded
in paraffin; 2–4μm thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and
eosin and immunohistochemistry was performed.
Virchows Arch
Results: Histological examination revealed a cellular neoplasm presum-
ably of mesenchymal origin, totally encapsulated, with extensive cystic
degeneration. The tumour was, mostly, composed of uniform spindle
cells of schwannian origin, without significant atypia, embedded in a
collagenous stroma (Antoni A areas). Vessels with thick hyalinized wall
were also apparent. Mitotic activity was absent.
During immunohistochemistry, tumour cells were S100 strongly and dif-
fusely positive, Vimentin (+), SOX10 (+), p16 (+) and retained INI-1
expression. The rest of the markers (Desmin, SMA, STAT-6, Melan-A,
HMB-45, CD31, CD34, AE1/AE3, EMA, HK27me3) were negative.
Conclusion: Morphological and immunohistochemical evaluation
favoured the diagnosis of cellular schwannoma with extensive cystic
degeneration, which mimic a renal cyst, clinically.
Cellular schwannomas are rare (6%), slow growing benign retroper-
itoneal tumours, usually found incidentally, with peak incidence from
4th to 6th decade. Total resection is sufficient and recurrence is ex-
tremely rare.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) arising in plex-
iform neurofibroma in a neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) patient
A. Sykaras*, E. Gioti, N. Stavrinou, P. Dolkiras, K. Christofidis, C.
Kouvidou
*Evangelismos General Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: NF1 is a genetic disorder predisposing to the
development of Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumours. These are neoplasms
of Schwann cell origin, benign (neurofibroma, schwannoma) or malig-
nant (MPNST). Plexiform Neurofibromas may undergo malignant de-
differentiation and progress to atypical neurofibromas and MPNSTs.
Methods: A 44-year old woman diagnosed with NF1, presented with a
bulky tumour localized at the anterior mediastinum. Surgery was per-
formed and we received three tumour masses measuring 2,5 to 8,8cm
in maximum diameter. Tumour was partially encapsulated, had a white-
tan appearance and a firm-solid texture. Due to its size, we proceeded to
extensive sampling of the mass.
Results: Histological examination revealed a spindle cell neoplasm ar-
ranged in a fascicular pattern of mixed cellularity with areas of myxoid
appearance. Tumour cells were variably pleiomorphic with
hyperchromatic nuclei and high atypia. Mitoses were abundant.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed patchy expression of SOX10
and S100, aberrant expression of p53 and loss of p16. Ki67 proliferation
index was 70%. Peripheral sections showed a different histological pat-
tern of a benign neoplasm with uniform bland spindle cells without atypia
or mitoses. Immunohistochemical analysis in these sections demonstrated
strong-diffuse expression of S100, absence of p53, retainment of p16 and
very low Ki67 expression. Morphology and immunophenotypic analysis
confirm the diagnosis of MPNST arising in Plexiform Neurofibroma.
Conclusion: MPNSTs arise either de novo or from malignant transfor-
mation of benign Nerve Sheath Tumours in NF1 patients. In this setting,
MPNSTs affects younger individuals and represent the leading cause of
death associated with NF1. Plexiform neurofibromas are very common in
NF1 patients and are considered as MPNST precursors because a subset
of them (especially deep) undergoes transformation to MPNSTs. The
malignant transformation is a dynamic process and the differential diag-
nosis between an atypical neurofibromatous tumour and MPNST is
challenging.

Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma – rare, molecularly defined tu-
mour of soft tissue

*Institute of Haematology and Transfusion Medicine, Diagnostic
Haematology Department, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research
Institute of Oncology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory
Medicine, Poland
Background & objectives: Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (AFH) is
a rare neoplasm with intermediate malignant potential (local recurrence
rate 15%, distant metastases up to 5%, single reports of AFH-related
deaths). AFH is a genetically defined lesion with EWSR1-CREB1
(>90%) or less common EWSR1-ATF1 fusion.
Methods: We present a 46-year-old female with a 3.5cm diameter, well-
circumscribed tumour localized in the cubital fossa area's soft tissue. In
the biopsy, low-grade sarcoma was diagnosed, and the surgical resection
was performed. The neoplasm was lobulated, surrounded by an incom-
plete fibrous pseudocapsule, and composed of epithelioid cells with
bland, vesicular nuclei and a scant amount of cytoplasm.
Results: The further evaluation revealed rare mitoses (up to 5 mitoses/
10HPF) and no necrosis. In the stroma, there were areas with myxoid
change and multifocal blood-filled pseudoangiomatous spaces and
haemorrhages. We did not observe the surrounding lymphoplasmacytic
infiltrate or cuff of B- and T-cells. Immunohistochemically, the tumour
cells were: CD99(+) weakly, Desmin(-/+) only single positive cells,
SMA(-), S100(-), SOX10(-), CD34(-), ERG(-), MDM2(-), CKAE1/
AE3(-), PD-L1(-) positive control in macrophages, Ki67(+) in 5-7% of
nuclei. The microscopic resection margins were radical (R0). In the ex-
tended NGS sarcoma panel assessment (FusionPlex Expanded Sarcoma
Kit for Illumina, ArcherDx), we found EWSR1-CREB1 fusion and no
additional mutations. The final diagnosis of angiomatoid fibrous
histiocytoma was made.
Conclusion: In conclusion, our case was diagnostically challenging be-
cause of myxoid features, lack of pericapsular rim of lymphoplasmacytic
cells with germinal centres, immunohistochemically weak desmin, and
CD99 expression. According to the latest report, nearly 60% of AFH
shows PD-L1 expression, although our case lacked PD-L1 expression.
Since treatment options for unresectable and/or metastatic tumours are
limited, the immunotherapy with PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors may be worth
further investigations.

Primary osteosarcoma originating of the kidney – a differential di-
agnosis with sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma with osseous
metaplasia
A. Szumera-Cieckiewicz*, O. Kuczkiewicz-Siemion, A. Namiot, A.
Klimczak, M. Prochorec-Sobieszek, P. Rutkowski
*Institute of Haematology and Transfusion Medicine, Diagnostic
Haematology Department, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research
Institute of Oncology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory
Medicine, Poland
Background & objectives: Extra skeletal osteosarcoma (OS) makes up
<1% of all soft tissue sarcomas and 4% of all OS. Mainly it originates in
the dermis/subcutis and is located in the thigh (~50% of cases); other sites
include the buttock, shoulder, trunk, and retroperitoneum.
Methods: We present a 55-year-old male with a tumour with a 20cm
diameter localized in the left retroperitoneal space. In January 2020 pa-
tient underwent radical nephrectomy, adrenalectomy, and splenectomy
outside our hospital. In March 2020, computed tomography revealed
the local abdominal recurrence (16.4x21.8x26.4cm) and multifocal liver
metastases (4.2x4.4x5.8cm and 3.6x3.3x3cm). The consultation of histo-
pathological material was performed.
Results: The tumour measuring 22x18x15cm was replacing nearly the
entire kidney and focally infiltrating the spleen on gross examination.
Microscopically, the neoplasm was highly cellular, composed of spindle
cells with moderate/high atypia, mitotic activity up to 6 mitoses/10HPF,
with necrosis and multiple haemorrhages, and numerous multinucleated
Virchows Arch
giant cells. In the stroma, abundant osteoid formation and lace-like ossi-
fication fields were seen. The resection margins were R1 and
Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells were: SATB2(+) strongly pos-
itive, SMA(+/-), Desmin(-), CD34(-), MDM2(-), p53(-), H3F3A(-),
H3F3B(-), CKAE1/AE3(-), PanCK(-). The tumour was examined in sev-
eral sections and did not show renal cell carcinoma (RCC) architecture.
The patient was qualified for palliative chemotherapy with anthracyclines
(CyADIC scheme).
Conclusion: In conclusion, the primary osteogenic OS of the kidney is
extremely rare. Up-to-date, only 28 cases have been reported, which
characterize high local recurrence rate and distant metastatic potential.
The differential diagnosis with sarcomatoid RCC requires extended sam-
pling and immunohistochemical assessment. Nevertheless, the prognosis
is dismal in both entities.

A case of leiomyosarcoma with high tumour mutation burden, mi-
crosatellite instability, mismatch repair deficiency and significant
PD-L1 expression
T.K.Y. Tay*, X.X. Sam, J.P.S. Yeong, J.Y. Chan
*Singapore General Hospital, Singapore
Background & objectives: Microsatellite instability (MSI) or mismatch
repair deficiency is extremely rare in sarcomas with an incidence of 2.2%
in a recent study. We report a case of a 55-year-old man with metastatic
abdominal wall leiomyosarcoma that is microsatellite unstable.
Methods: Histological and immunohistochemical (IHC) assessment was
performed to arrive at the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. Tumour tissue
was subsequently sent for molecular profiling via FoundationOne CDx
which includes testing for MSI status and tumour mutation burden. MSI
PCR and IHC for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins and PD-L1 (22C3
clone) were also performed.
Results: Histology showed a FNCLCC grade 3 spindle cell sarcoma in
keeping with a leiomyosarcoma. Tumour infiltrating lymphocytes and
plasma cells were noted within the tumour and at the tumour edge.
FoundationOne CDx showed MSI high status and tumour mutation bur-
den of 11.35/megabase. Somatic alterations included TP53, BCL2 and
MLL2, along with truncating mutations in RB1, MSH3 and MSH6. MSI
PCR showed shifts in microsatellite markers confirming MSI-high status.
There was loss of MSH6 on MMR IHC while PD-L1 stained positive
with Tumour Proportion Score of 40% and Combined Positive Score of
45. Clinically, the patient demonstrated primary resistance to 2 lines of
chemotherapy and was subsequently treated with checkpoint
immunotherapy.
Conclusion: We report a rare case of leiomyosarcoma with MSI-high
status, high TMB (>10/megabase), MMR protein loss and significant PD-
L1 expression. The presence of a significant number of tumour infiltrating
lymphocytes within the tumour and at the periphery may be a histologic
clue to MSI high status. However, more study is needed. There is good
correlation between MSI status, TMB, MMR and PD-L1 expression in
this case.

Recurrent metastatic granular cell tumour: a case report
A. Toma*, E. Tianu, O. Stefan, A. Savin, R. Danciu, F. Obrocea
*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Romania
Background & objectives: Malignant granular cell tumour is an exceed-
ingly rare Schwann cell-related sarcoma with aggressive behaviour and
poor clinical outcome. Prediction of malignant behaviour based on mor-
phologic and immunohistochemical features remains a challenge, with
metastases being considered the definitive criterion for malignancy.
Methods: A 52-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of rapidly
growing painless mass in the posteromedial aspect of the proximal upper
arm. Ultrasound examinations revealed a 3 x 2 cm well-defined, firm,
subcutaneous mass with heterogeneous echo pattern and fascial contact.
Computed tomography showed no evidence of metastatic disease.
Results: Core-needle biopsy revealed a granular cell tumour with uncer-
tain malignant potential. The excised lesion measured 5.4 cm in the di-
rection of maximum dimension and had infiltrative borders. The neoplas-
tic cells were PAS-positive with diastase-resistant cytoplasmic granules
and showed S-100 and SOX10 immunoreactivity. Unfavorable histolog-
ical features were noted, such as increased cellularity, prominent spin-
dling, focal pleomorphism, vesicular nuclei with conspicuous nucleoli
and increased mitotic activity. The margins were positive. After three
months, a wide re-excision showed local recurrence measuring 2.7 mm
in maximum diameter. Six months later, the patient presented local re-
currence and metastatic disease in axillary lymph nodes.
Conclusion: The tumour met five out of six Fanburg-Smith criteria for
classification as malignant. The treatment of choice was wide excision,
with careful assessment of surgical margins. Although the diagnosis of a
granular cell tumour is straightforward, the process for making the dis-
tinction between benign and malignant is controversial, but its accuracy is
of paramount importance, as the clinical behaviour and prognosis differ
greatly. Patient follow-up for development of metastases is essential,
regardless of the histologic criteria for malignancy.

Combined thymic carcinoma developing in the lung; a rare case
report
E. Genc Erdogan*, B. Binboga Kurt, E. Usturalı Keskin, E. Mercan
Demirtaş, F.E. Akay
*Department of Pathology, Lüleburgaz State Hospital, Turkey
Background & objectives: Combined thymic carcinoma is a relatively
rare malignant neoplasm of the thymus composed of thymic carcinoma
and any type of thymoma that was recently added to the 4th edition of the
World Health Organization (WHO) classification of thymic tumours.
Methods: Our case is a 32-year-old female patient diagnosed with type
B2 thymoma (including those with type B3) in 2015. Therefore, the
patient, who was treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, had respi-
ratory distress for 2 months. Following the symptoms, a 16x11 mm nod-
ular lesion with increased FDG uptake was detected in the right lung, and
lower lobe wedge resection was performed.
Results: In resection material, a tumoral infiltration forming solid islets of
different sizes containing extensive bleeding and fibrotic areas adjacent to
the lung parenchyma was observed. Histopathological findings showed a
presence of two separate components, squamous cell carcinoma, and
thymoma. The immunohistochemical examination showed diffuse posi-
tive staining for PanCK and CD19, slight positivity in some cells with
TdT and CD20, negative staining was detected in CD1a and PAX8 lead-
ing to a diagnosis of combined thymic squamous cell carcinoma and type
B3 thymoma,
Conclusion: The combined thymic carcinoma is a rare entity with an
ambiguous etiological background. However, the presence of thymoma
in patients could be demonstrated as a predisposing risk factor for further
development of thymic carcinoma. In conclusion, histopathological ex-
amination and clinical management of these tumours should be executed
carefully because these lesions may co-exist in the spectrum of differen-
tiation and regional or distant recurrence may occur.

Inflammaging: the silicates definitely accelerate involution of thymus
E. Grigoreva*, V. Gordova, V. Efimova, V. Sergeeva
*FGBOU VO "ChGU im. I.N. Ulyanov", Russia
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: Earlier we proved that the water-soluble
silicon intake with the bottled, tap and distillate drinking water accelerat-
ed the thymus involution in male outbred rats. Will the response of mu-
rine thymus be similar to the rat's one after the silicon intake?
Methods: During 9-month white outbred male 5 rats and 3 mice received
ad libitum bottled drinking water; 5 rats and 3 mice received the same
water supplemented with sodium metasilicate (10 mg/l). After the ani-
mals were sacrificed the liver were isolated, fixed in 10% formalin, em-
bedded in paraffin, cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Results: After 3 months, the histological slides of hematoxylin and eosin-
stained thymus of the mice treated with silica was different from the
thymus of untreated mice. The cortical septa are expanded, the appear-
ance of adipocytes is observed in them. A similar picture was observed in
the thymus of rabbits. After 9 months we noted the full-depletion in
lymphocytes the cortex and medulla of the thymus of mice treated by
silica. The thymus of treated mice was totally replaced by the adipose
tissue while the thymus of untreated mice conserved the islands of
lymphocytes.
Conclusion: Thus, the reaction of the thymus of mice after 9 months of
silicon intake with drinking water is similar to the reaction of the thymus
of rats. This fact proved that the intake of silica with drinking water
accelerates the involution of thymus.

A case report: micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma, and
thymic cysts
I. Guzelis*, I.E. Cakir, M.A. Uyaroğlu
*Izmir Katip Celebi University Pathology Department, Turkey
Background & objectives: Micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stro-
ma (MTWLS) is a rare thymoma type that consists of multiple small
tumour islands composed of spindle or oval cells that are surrounded by
epithelial cell-free lymphoid stroma.
Methods: A 54-year-old woman who had undergone an endovascular
abdominal aneurysm repair presented to the cardiothoracic surgery (CTS)
clinic for postoperative 3-month follow-up. CT revealed a mass with a
diameter of 3.4 cm at the anterior mediastinum. The patient has under-
gone a mediastinal mass excision. Gross examination showed two cysts
and a 5 cm diameter solid mass in the fragmented material.
Results: Microscopic examination revealed a thymoma that had invaded
the pericapsular connective tissue. The thymoma consisted of tumour
islands composed of short spindle to oval cells without mitoses and a
lymphoid stroma that was free of epithelial cells and contained lymphoid
follicles with germinal centres, while only a few lymphocytes were
scattered within the tumour islands. Immunohistochemically the tumour
islands were Cytokeratin19(+), p63(+), PAX8(+), and CD117(-) within
CD5(+) few scattered lymphocytes. There was an accompanying cyst
lined by a single layer of flattened cuboidal epithelium. The case was
diagnosed as WHO pT2 and Masaoka stage IIa MTWLS and thymic
cysts. The patient is in a close follow-up by the CTS clinic.
Conclusion: Micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma is a very rare
type of thymoma showing a similar pattern but varied morphology and
immunophenotype of tumour cells. Although it is known to be associate
with a favourable outcome, more cases and longer follow-up periods are
needed.

Thymic carcinoma in a patient with concurrent breast cancer
L. Karelis*, H.J. Trihia, G. Stanc, N. Baltayiannis, G. Galanopoulos, E.
Souka, P. Manikis, O. Tzaida
*"Metaxas" Memorial Cancer Hospital, Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: Thymic neoplasms are rare tumours, ranging
from indolent thymomas to aggressive thymic carcinomas. Patients with
thymic neoplasms have increased chances of developing a second or third
neoplasm. We present a case of thymic carcinoma with concurrent breast
carcinoma.
Methods: A 57-year-old female with a history of grade II, stage
Τ1cN1Mx breast ductal (NOS) carcinoma under chemotherapy-
hormonotherapy demonstrated at post-surgery imaging examination an
upper-anterior mediastinal mass of 8cm. The patient underwent surgical
abscission of the mediastinal tumour, 10 months after the first operation
(mastectomy).
Results: Histopathologic examination revealed a thymic neoplasm with
regular contours and multi-nodular, compact configuration consisting of
atypical, polymorphous, non-keratinized cells and giant cells. There was
brisk mitotic activity and foci of necrosis. The neoplasm had areas with
more bland morphology, like a B3-thymoma and was accompanied by
lymphoplasmacytic stroma organized in lymph nodules. Residual thymic
tissue was observed. The neoplasm was surrounded by a rudimentary
capsule focally infiltrated. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed posi-
tivity for: CKAE1AE3, CK5/6, p63, CD117, MUC1, CD5 and negativity
for GATA-3, ER, PgR, HER-2. The two neoplasms (of the breast and
mediastinum) were morphologically and immunohistochemically
independent.
Conclusion: Thymic carcinoma accounts for 0,06% of thymic malignan-
cies. These patients can develop other tumours (mostly lymphomas, sar-
comas and gastrointestinal cancers). Co-existence of thymic carcinoma
and breast carcinoma is exceedingly rare. Our case refers to thymic car-
cinoma with characteristics of lymphoepithelial carcinoma, arising from a
thymoma, which possibly pre-existed the breast tumour. 20% of
thymomas may be transformed to thymic carcinomas. Extra-thymic neo-
plasms are much more common in patients with thymoma and can appear
before, simultaneously or after the thymoma diagnosis.

A case of mucin producing type AB thymoma
E.K. Koltuk*, S. Dizbay Sak
*Ankara Uni. School of Medicine, Turkey
Background & objectives: Thymomas show morphological hetero-
geneity. According to WHO classification, a thymoma showing both
lymphocyte-poor spindle cell and lymphocyte-rich components is
called AB-thymoma. Microcystic changes, rosettes, papillary areas,
whorls can be observed in type-A areas. However, mucin production
is not expected.
Methods: A 44x33 mm mass with lobulated contours located in the
anterior mediastinum was found on the thorax CT in a 68 years-old male,
who was admitted with suspicion of COVID. SUVmax was 3.77 on the
PET-CT. On gross examination, an encapsulated tumour measuring
5x4x2.5 cm, with a pinkish-white cut surface was observed.
Results: On histological examination the tumour was consistent with an
AB thymoma. CD3, Tdt, CD1a were found to be positive at lymphoid
cells, while spindle cells were positive with cytokeratin and p63.
Chromogranin A and synaptophysin were negative. In one section,
mucin-rich columnar epithelium was observed. The presence of mucin
was shown with PAS-AB and mucicarmine stains.
Conclusion: A case of otherwise typical type AB thymoma with focal
mucinous epithelium is presented. Mucin production can be observed in
thymic adenocarcinomas. The present tumour was a typical thymoma and
mucin production did not create any diagnostic problems. We cannot
comment on the prognostic impact of this morphological finding.
However, this case shows that mucin producing epithelium should be
added to the wide spectrum of morphological findings, that can be ob-
served in thymomas.

*Hospital Prof. Doutor Fernando Fonseca, EPE, Portugal
Virchows Arch
Background & objectives: A 25-year-old male, with no smoking habits
or relevant medical history, presented to the hospital with one-month
evolution of productive cough. He had no other symptoms and clinical
examination was innocent.
Methods: Chest radiography evidenced a superior mediastinal enlarge-
ment; chest CT revealed an infra-carinal mediastinal mass of 64x50mm.
Endobronchial endoscopy with bronchial biopsies and adenopathy aspi-
ration cytology were performed.
Bronchial biopsies revealed a neoplasia with solid to trabecular pattern,
consisting of small, cuboidal cells with granular chromatin and generally
absent nucleoli, with scant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Keratin pearls and
necrosis were observed.
Results: Immunohistochemistry was positive for p40, p63, CK5,
CK34ß12 and CD56.
The differential diagnosis was between basaloid squamous cell carcinoma
and NUT Carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry for nuclear carcinoma of
the testis protein (NUT) revealed strong and diffuse expression in more
than 50% of the neoplastic cells.
Diagnosis of NUT carcinoma was made.
Global evaluation, including PET scan, revealed pulmonary parenchyma
involvement, regional adenopathies; hepatic lesion; right adrenal gland
nodule; osteomedullary lesions and was staged IVB, with probable pri-
mary neoplasm of the mediastinum, with lung invasion and several
metastases.
Conclusion: NUT carcinoma is a rare, aggressive carcinoma defined by
rearrangement of the NUTM1 gene. The histologic features are unspecif-
ic: it is poorly differentiated, with or without squamous differentiation
with a monomorphic, clonal appearance. It is under-recognized by most
pathologists, consequently it is commonly undiagnosed, or misdiagnosed,
most often as squamous cell carcinoma.
Immunohistochemistry for NUT expression easy diagnoses it, so it
should be recommended in all poorly differentiated non-cutaneous carci-
nomas, with or without squamous differentiation, that have a monomor-
phic appearance.

Germ cell mediastinal tumour associated with a presumable acute
megacaryocytic leukaemia
L. Parascan*, F. Vasilescu, C. Dobrea
*Emergency Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases "C.C. Iliescu",
Romania
Background & objectives: The association between mediastinal germ
cell tumours and haematological malignancies is very rare, with only 26
cases reported in the last 7 decades. We present here the case of a 26-year-
old patient with an undifferentiated mediastinal tumour.
Methods: An autopsy was performed in order to establish the diagnosis.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue samples harvested from the
mediastinal tumour were processed by means of standard HE and special
stains (VGE, PAS-alcian, Gomori). IHC was performed on semi-thin
sections according to the manufacturer specifications for the following
antibodies: AE1-AE3, SMA, desmin, ER, Vim, Ki-67.
Results: Grossly, a large mediastinal tumour was found, along with mas-
sive peritumoral hematoma and paraneoplastic bilateral pleural effusion.
Bronchopneumonia and acute transmural myocardial infarction were also
found as subsequent complications. Microscopically , the tumour cells
were arranged in gland-like or tubular structures with areas of necrosis
and haemorrhage, accompanied by a proliferation of elongated spindle
cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. AE1-AE3 was positive in the epithelial
component, with a Ki-67 proliferation index of 40-50%. The mesenchy-
mal component stained positive to SMA, desmin and vimentin in the
spindle cells. ER was negative.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of a non-seminomatous mediastinal germ cell
tumour with a mature teratoma component, associated with areas of ad-
enocarcinoma and sarcomatous proliferation with muscular
differentiation was made, accompanied by a possible acute
megacaryocytic leukaemia. Nonseminomatous germ cell tumours in as-
sociation with AML are a rare combination of two malignancies that
affect the young male patients and have a poor prognosis.

Cavernous haemangioma of the bladder: a case report of a rare
lesion and literature review
C. Alves-Vale*, F. Ferronha, E. Vitorino
*Pathology Department, CUF Descobertas Hospital, Lisbon, Portugal
Background & objectives: Haemangioma is a benign vascular tumour.
Although frequently diagnosed on skin, these lesions are extremely rare
in the bladder, accounting for only approximately 0,6% of primary tu-
mours. Nonetheless, haematuria is a clinical manifestation that overlaps
with that of epithelial malignancies.
Methods: We report the case of a 86-year-old man, with history of prostatic
adenocarcinoma diagnosed 16 years before, who presented with haematuria
and weak urine flow. The disease had been staged as cT1c N0 M0 and
treated with hormone therapy, external radiotherapy and brachytherapy,
with no evidence of relapse. An urethrocystoscopy was now performed.
Results: A large intravesical clot and a suspicious erythematous lesion in
the left lateral bladder wall were detected, along with a stricture of the
bulbo-membranous urethra. A transurethral resection of the bladder tu-
mour was performed. Microscopically, diffuse haemorrhage associated to
large cystically dilated vessels with thin walls, without cytological atypia
in the endothelial lining, were identified. The diagnosis of cavernous
haemangioma of the bladder was made. Fibrosis and reactive features
of both stromal fibroblasts and urothelium were present and considered
as radiation therapy effect. No evidence of epithelial dysplasia or neopla-
sia was found, supported by cytokeratin 20 and Ki-67 immunostaining.
Conclusion: History of malignancy should increase the suspicion for
tumour-related causes of haematuria. Haemangiomas are extremely rare
bladder lesions but should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
Endoscopic features may be highly suggestive of a vascular lesion, and
microscopic analysis allows for the definitive diagnosis. As in our case,
hemangiomas are generally of cavernous type and diagnosed in male
adults. This is the second case reported in a patient after radiotherapy,
but no etiologic factors have been established.

Paratesticular inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour: a benign enti-
ty with a very rare location

*Clinical Service of Pathology, “Sf. Apostol Andrei” Emergency County
Hospital, Constanţa, Romania / Center for Research and Development of
the Morphological and Genetic Studies of Malignant Pathology,
“Ovidius” University of Constanţa, Romania
Background & objectives: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour is a
benign entity originating in the soft tissues, with unknown aetiology. Its
treatment consists only in complete surgical excision. Genito-urinary lo-
calization, and especially the testicular/paratesticular one, is particularly
rare, being reported in less than 10 cases.
Methods: We present the case of a 57-year-old male patient, who pre-
sented for scrotal pain and swelling of the right testicle, with palpation of
a hardened area, for about 4 months, which did not remit after clinical
treatment. The right orchiectomy revealed a normal testicular parenchy-
ma and a poorly defined lesion of 2 /1.5cm, adjacent to the epididymis,
affecting the tunica vaginalis.
Virchows Arch
Results: Microscopic examination identifies a mesenchymal tumour
composed of a proliferation of fusiform cells, with elongated nuclei,
without atypia, arranged in bundles and associated with a diffuse inflam-
matory infiltrate. The highlighted aspects indicate an inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumour of the testicular vagina and immunohistochemi-
cal tests were mandatory in order to establish the final diagnosis.
Immunohistochemical examination revealed fusiform cell positivity in
SMA, and in Vimentin, negativity in the epithelial marker AE1 / AE3,
S100 and Desmin. For the evaluation of inflammatory cells, CD3 was
positively intensified in lymphocytes and CD68 was positive in macro-
phage cells. The final diagnosis was paratesticular inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumour (tunica vaginalis). Patient was followed without
any further treatment.
Conclusion: Histopathological examination, in correlation with proteo-
mic evaluation, established the biological potential of the paratesticular
lesion, benign in this case, despite the noisy clinical appearance and
suspicion for malignancy, important aspects in establishing therapeutic
behaviour. It is also a diagnosis that must be considered in the differential
diagnosis of paratesticular lesions.

Hadhri, A. Zakhama, M. Njima
*Department of Pathology, Chu Fattouma Bourguiba Monastir, Tunisia
Background & objectives: Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC)
is a rare subtype of RCC. Cystic RCC are rare among all RCC subtypes and
cystic ChRCC are even a more uncommon presentation. We describe here
a ChRCC presenting as predominantly cystic renal mass.
Methods: We report a rare case of ChRCC presenting as a unilocular
renal cystic mass. It is about a 69-year-old man presented with a history of
right lumbar abdominal pain and discomfort. Computed tomography
showed a solid with prominent cystic mass measuring 2,5 cm×2 cm aris-
ing from the lower pole of the right kidney. A partial nephrectomy was
performed.
Results: Gross pathological examination of the surgical specimen re-
vealed a 2,5 cm cystic mass. The wall thickness of the cyst was 0.4 cm.
The surrounding renal parenchymal tissue was normal. Histological ex-
amination of the cystic mass showed solid nests, tubules and papillae of
tumour cells in the lumen. These cells were polygonal with distinct bor-
ders, nuclei were wrinkled, angulated, and with perinuclear halos in a
background of abundant pale eosinophilic cytoplasm. The cystic wall
was lined by a layer of tumour cells. There was no perinephric tissues
invasion. Surgical margins were negative.
By immunohistochemistry, the tumour cells were diffusely positive for
CK7, focally positive for c-kit and negative for CD10.
Conclusion: Cystic renal neoplasm varies from benign to malignant.
Cystic RCC is frequently misdiagnosed as a benign renal cyst because
it shares similar clinical manifestations and imaging characteristics.
Cystic presentation of ChRCC is believed to account for 4% of all mor-
phological variants of chromophobe RCC.
Because of the rarity of this entity and the limited number of patients
reported in the literature, additional research is needed to further show
diagnostic and prognostic implications.

Carcinoma cuniculatum of the penis – a case report
J. Boavida*, T. Oliveira, D. López-Presa
*Department of Pathology, Hospital de Santa Maria, CHULN, Portugal
Background & objectives: Carcinoma cuniculatum is a low-grade squa-
mous cell carcinoma, first described in the plantar skin and extremely rare
in the penis (less than 1% of penile carcinoma). We report a case of
verrucous carcinoma of the penis with extensive cuniculatum component.
Methods: A 70-year-old patient underwent a partial penectomy due to a
slow-growing penile tumour. Macroscopically, the lesion had 6x5,6x4,1
cm, with an exoendophytic growth, involving the glans and extending
into the distal third of the shaft, without foreskin involvement; the
exophytic component comprised two verrucous lesions in the skin. The
tumour was mobile relatively to the surrounding tissues.
Results: The morphology showed a well-differentiated carcinoma with
prominent acanthosis and keratinization with a sinus-like endophytic
burrowing growth pattern. The tumour was well-delimitated with pushing
borders accompanied by a chronic inflammatory infiltrate. The glans and
corpus spongiosum were infiltrated but the corpora cavernosa were
spared and completely compressed; it was not possible to evaluate ure-
thral invasion at the tumour site although it appeared tumour-free at the
surgical margin. Fistulisation to the skin was observed which translated
into two verrucous lesions at the outer penile surface.
Immunohistochemical staining for p16 was negative. Considering these
morphologic characteristics, particularly its unique endophytic growth
pattern, the diagnosis of penile carcinoma cuniculatum was established.
Conclusion: We present this case of carcinoma cuniculatum given the
rarity of this entity in this location, with only 9 cases reported in literature
to date. Its recognition is important given its excellent prognosis due to its
usual absence of vascular and perineural invasion and regional metastasis,
as was the case with our patient.

Rare case; desmoid fibromatosis in the spermatic cord
U. Kucuk, S. Ekmekci*, E. Kisa
*University of Health Sciences Turkey, Tepecik Research and Training
Hospital, Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Desmoid fibromatosis(DF) is a monoclonal,
locally aggressive lesion with infiltrative growth and categorized as a
non-metastatic, fibroblastic/myofibroblastic neoplasm. The tumour is
most commonly located in the extremity, followed by the abdominal wall,
retroperitoneum, and chest wall. Spermatic cord-located DF in literature
is extremely rare.
Methods: 28-year-old male patient presented with complaint of left scro-
tal swelling for 1.5 years. On physical examination, two firm, intercon-
nected nodules associated with left epididymis were observed. Imaging
methods revealed scrotal hernia and nodular mass lesions. Largest was
5cm in diameter and orchiectomy was planned. Gross examination of
orchiectomy revealed two interconnected nodular lesions, reaching
8x5.5x5cm in total size, associated with spermatic cord.
Results: The cross-sectional surface of the nodules was solid, cream-
white in colour. Long fascicular proliferation of spindle cells with bland
nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm were observed in hematoxylin and
eosin sections of samples taken from the lesion. In some of the samples,
there were rough hyalinized collagenization areas between spindle cells.
Tumour cells showed immunohistochemically negative reactions with
CD34, S100 and desmin, and positive reaction with SMA and beta ca-
tenin. The mutation c.121A>G (p.Thr41Ala) was detected in the
CTNNB1 gene (NM_001904.4) after bioinformatic analysis with the
new generation sequence method. Our case was diagnosed with desmoid
fibromatosis located in the spermatic cord. No recurrence was observed in
the 2-year clinical follow-up of the case.
Conclusion: Desmoid fibromatosis is a rare locally aggressive tumour.
Spermatic cord-located DF has been reported in only a few case reports in
literature. Here, a spermatic cord DF case is presented with its clinical,
radiological, histopathological and genetic features due to it’s extremely
rare localization.

Relevance intraoperative diagnosis of fibrous pseudotumour
paratesticular: challenge for sparing testis
S. Elaouni*, S. Jebli, S. Sassi, F. Zouidia, Z. Bernoussi, K. Znati
*Ibn Sina University Hospital, Pathology, Rabat, Morocco
Background & objectives: Paratesticular fibrous pseudotumours are rare
pathologies with quite wide and variable topographic-morphological fea-
tures. It is difficult to distinguish from malignant masses. Treatment can
be done by resection of the mass subject to a diagnosis of histological
proof.
Methods: A 34-year-old man presented with a painless palpable mass in
the right scrotum. Scrotal ultrasound revealed a normal testicle and
hyperechoic lesion adjacent to the right testis. The levels of testicular
tumour markers were normal. We planned tumour biopsy combined with
intraoperative rapid diagnosis.
Results: Scrotal incision was performed to explore the scrotum, and
paratesticular white lobular mass is observed at the tunica vaginalis.
The maximum size was approximately 35 mm. Frozen section assess-
ment was performed, and intraoperative rapid diagnosis suggested a fi-
brous pseudotumor without malignancy. We excised the paratesticular
white mass and successfully performed testicular-sparing surgery.
Pathological findings revealed the proliferation of typical fibroblasts that
were distributed in multidirectional bundles of dissociated collagen fibres.
Lymphocyte infiltration including immunoglobulin G4 positive plasma
cells was observed.
Conclusion: If a scrotal tumour is detected in patients with normal tu-
mour markers, and its relation with the testis cannot be determined, these
patients might have a fibrous pseudotumour, using frozen section analysis
during surgery, an organ-sparing strategy can be pursued in these patients.

Para-testicular genital-type rhabdomyoma: a case report
Y. Mahmoud, A. Elwy*, R. A. Ibrahim
*Pathology Department, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University,
Assiut, Egypt and Shefaa Al-Orman Oncology Hospital, Luxor, Egypt
Background & objectives: Extracardiac rhabdomyomas are relatively
rare benign tumours of striated muscles that can be classified into foetal,
adult and genital types. Genital rhabdomyomas usually occur in middle-
aged women and have rarely been reported in males in para-testicular
region.
Methods: We present a case of a 39-year-old male, with right sided
painless scrotal swelling, gradually increasing in size during the past 3
years. Serum markers were within normal limits. Ultrasonography and
MRI revealed a well-defined oval mass, measured 25x20 mm, superior to
the right testis inseparable from the epididymis. Conservative excision
was done and intraoperative frozen section examination was performed.
Results: Grossly, the mass was well-circumscribed, measuring 3x2x2 cm
with a homogenous white solid cut section. Frozen section diagnosis coin-
cided with a benign neoplasm (adenomatoid tumour versus
rhabdomyoma). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded H&E stained sections
revealed a neoplastic growth made up of haphazardly arranged large
rhabdoid cells and strap-like cells in a collagenous stroma with occasional
lymphoplasmacytic aggregates. The tumour cells had abundant eosinophil-
ic cytoplasm with uniform eccentric rounded vesicular nuclei and bi-
nucleate forms. There was no evidence of atypia or necrosis, and the mitotic
activity was insignificant. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells
showed diffuse strong positive reaction for desmin, however calretinin,
S100 and CK were negative. Ki-67 proliferation index was less than 1%.
Conclusion: Although, genital type rhabdomyomas are quite rare in
males, yet they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of
masses in paratesticular region. The accurate interpretation of intraoper-
ative frozen sections helps to formulate the proper management decisions
and prevents unnecessary radical orchiectomy. Wide local excision of
rhabdomyoma remains the treatment of choice, owing to their benign
biologic behaviour and low recurrence rate.

Primary osteosarcoma of the urinary bladder metastatic to lung: a
case report
A. Elwy*, M.A.A.l. Elsayed, M. ElKaffas, N. Rashad, A.S. Rezk, N.
Magdy
*Pathology Department, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University,
Assiut, Egypt and Shefaa Al-Orman Oncology Hospital, Luxor, Egypt
Background & objectives: Extra-skeletal osteosarcoma (ESOS) is a rare
malignant neoplasm that represents less than 2% of all soft tissue sarco-
mas. ESOS arising primarily in parenchymatous organs is extremely un-
common, with the involvement of the urinary bladder is even rarer.
Methods: A 48-year-old male patient, who presented to oncology clinic,
complained of haematuria. Ultrasonography and computed tomography
(CT) revealed a urinary bladder large polypoid soft tissue mass with
extravesical extension, had peripheral rod like macro-calcifications. A
transurethral biopsy was performed and was sent to our pathology lab.
Results: Microscopically, the fragments were focally ulcerated, infiltrat-
ed by sheets of non-cohesive malignant epithelioid cells exhibited marked
pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei with bizarre multinucleated forms.
Mitotic activity was plentiful. The tumour cells were embedded in an
eosinophilic osteoid matrix with focal calcification.
Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells were diffusely positive for
vimentin and SATB-2, while were negative for CK. The lack of urothelial
carcinoma component had qualified the diagnosis of primary osteosarco-
ma. The patient received one cycle of Cisplatin 60 mg/m2 - Adriamycin
60 mg/m2 cycles. Follow up CT chest after one-month revealed bilateral
pulmonary nodules some of them were calcified, likely metastatic. The
patient then lost to follow up two-months after diagnosis.
Conclusion: Primary urinary bladder sarcomas are uncommon and rep-
resents less than 1 % of all urinary bladder malignancies, and osteosar-
comas in particular are exceedingly rare. The main differential diagnosis
is carcinosarcoma and urothelial carcinomas with osseous metaplasia.
However, the distinction from carcinosarcoma does not have major ther-
apeutic implications, as both require aggressive therapy, yet the distinc-
tion from low-grade urothelial carcinoma with osseous metaplasia is
important.

Epithelioid angiosarcoma of the urinary bladder - a case report
I. Fahoum*, G. Gitstein
*Tel-Aviv Sourasky medical centre, Tel-Aviv, Israel
Background & objectives: Primary angiosarcoma of the bladder is rare.
The epithelioid variant of angiosarcoma is characterized by malignant
endothelial cells with epithelioid appearance. We present a case of pri-
mary bladder epithelioid angiosarcoma in a patient with history of irradi-
ation for rectal adenocarcinoma.
Methods: A 70-yr-old man presented with haematuria. Ten years earlier,
he was diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma and treated with sur-
gery and radiation. Cystoscopy at an outside hospital revealed solid blad-
der mass. Transurethral resection was performed, and the case was diag-
nosed as muscle-invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma. The patient
decided to continue treatment at our institution, which included neoadju-
vant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy.
Results: On gross examination, there was an ulcerated red-brown
haemorrhagic mass in the anterior bladder wall measuring 3cm.
Microscopic examination showed high-grade solid tumour with extensive
haemorrhagic background composed of large atypical epithelioid cells
with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, large hyperchromatic nuclei and
prominent nucleoli. Occasional intracytoplasmic vacuoles were also seen.
Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells were positive for CD31,
Virchows Arch
Factor-VIII-related-antigen and ERG. Cytokeratin was focally positive.
GATA3, P63, CK7, S100, CD34 and LCA were all negative. These
findings confirm the diagnosis of primary epithelioid angiosarcoma of
the urinary bladder.
Conclusion: Primary angiosarcoma of the urinary bladder is rare. The
epithelioid variant of angiosarcoma might be misdiagnosed as high-grade
urothelial carcinoma, especially because of positive immunohistochemi-
cal staining for cytokeratin.

Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the urinary bladder with heterologous
element of rhabdomyosarcoma – a case report
I. Fahoum*, G. Gitstein
*Tel-Aviv Sourasky medical centre, Tel-Aviv, Israel
Background & objectives: Sarcomatoid urothelial carcinoma is a ma-
lignant tumour that exhibits morphologic or immunohistochemical evi-
dence of both epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation. Heterologous
elements may be present. We present a case of sarcomatoid carcinoma of
the bladder with heterologous component of rhabdomyosarcoma.
Methods: A 74-yr-old woman presented with macrohematuria.
Cystoscopy revealed a 5cm solid partially necrotic mass in the posterior
bladder wall. Transurethral resection of the mass was performed.
Results: Microscopic examination showed malignant tumour with bi-
phasic pattern consisting of sarcomatoid component admixed with carci-
nomatous areas. The sarcoma displayed atypical spindle cells and areas
composed of round blue cells. Rhabdomyoblastic differentiation charac-
terized by cells with eccentric nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cyto-
plasm was seen in these areas. The carcinomatous areas composed of
epithelial atypical cells with large hyperchromatic nuclei and eosinophilic
cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical stains for Pancytokeratin, CK7, P63,
EMA and GATA3 were focally positive in these areas, consistent with
invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma. In the sarcomatous component,
vimentin was positive, and GATA3 was focally positive. The heterolo-
gous component of rhabdomyosarcoma was confirmed by positive im-
munohistochemical staining for MyoD1, MYF4 and desmin.
Conclusion: Although rare, sarcomatoid carcinoma is more common
than primary bladder sarcoma. Pathologists should be aware of this entity,
and to the fact that heterologous elements in the form of rhabdomyosar-
coma or other sarcomas may be present in these tumours.

Ipsilateral renal agenesis accompanying cystic dysplasia of the rete
testis in a young adult: a case report
I. Franin*, I. Grubišić, L. Postružin Gršić, B. Krušlin
*Department of Pathology and Cytology “Ljudevit Jurak”, University
Hospital Centre “Sestre Milosrdnice”, Zagreb, Croatia
Background & objectives: A 31-year-old man was referred from an
outside (external) institution to the department of urology under the sus-
picion of a testicular tumour, with left-sided testicular pain lasting a cou-
ple of months in duration.
Methods: Physical examination showed a hard, thickened and small left
testis on palpation. The left testicle showed a diffuse, inhomogeneous
ultrasonographic appearance. After urologic examination a left-sided in-
guinal orchidectomy was performed. The testis and epididymis with fu-
niculus were sent to pathology.
Results: On gross examination, a cystic cavity filled with brown fluid
content and surrounding brownish parenchyma measuring up to 3.5 cm in
diameter was found. Histologic examination showed cystically dilated
rete testis lined with cuboidal epithelium with a positive immunohisto-
chemical reaction to cytokeratins. The cystic cavity was microscopically a
pseudocyst filled with extravasated erythrocytes and abundant clusters of
siderophages. The siderophages extended into the testicular parenchyma,
surrounding the seminiferous tubules and spreading out around ducts of
the epididymis, which were also cystically dilated with siderophages
inside their lumina.
Conclusion: On the basis of clinical data, histological and immunohisto-
chemical analysis, a diagnosis of cystic dysplasia of the rete testis was
established. According to the literature there is a very well-known asso-
ciation between cystic dysplasia of rete testis and ipsilateral genitourinary
anomalies. The patient was referred to the department of radiology and a
multi-slice computed tomography scan revealed ipsilateral renal agenesis,
right seminal vesicle cyst reaching up to the iliac arteries and a multi-
cystic formation cranial to the prostate.

Concurrence of bladder lymphoma and urothelial carcinoma. A case
report
G. Galanopoulos*, G. Sotiropoulou, E. Souka, L. Karelis, M. Terzi, O.
Tzaida
*Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: Bladder cancer accounts for 3% of global
cancer diagnosis. Bladder lymphomas are extremely rare, accounting for
0.2% of primary neoplasms. We present a case of concurrence of Non-
Hogkin B-cell lymphoma and urothelial carcinoma in a bladder tumour.
Methods: A 75-year-old male was admitted for haematuria investigation.
Cystoscopy revealed a large papillary mass and a transurethral resection
of the bladder tumour was performed. The patient mentioned a history of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma without providing further details about the his-
tological type.
Results: Histopathologic examination of the specimens revealed a super-
ficial high-grade urothelial carcinoma with papillary and solid architec-
ture. In the subepithelial connective tissue, infiltration of a malignant
lymphoma with follicular and diffuse growth pattern was found. The
lymphoid population consisted of small, atypical cells with clear cyto-
plasm and mild mitotic activity. Immunohistochemical staining was pos-
itive for: CD20, PAX5, BCL2, CD5, CD38 and negative for: CD3, CD5,
CD10, CD23, BCL6, SOX11, ZAP70, regarding the lymphoid malignant
cells. The results set the diagnosis of a Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma
(MZBCL). The urothelial cancer cells were positive for CKAE1AE3 and
GATA3.
Conclusion: Most common bladder lymphomas are Marginal zone B-
cell lymphomas, followed by Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. This is the
second case of concurrence of bladder lymphoma and urothelial carcino-
ma reviewed in the literature. In both cases the lymphoid malignant com-
ponent was a MZBCL.

*U.M.F. "Grigore T. Popa" Iasi, Clinical Hospital "Dr. C.I. Parhon",
Romania
Background & objectives: Acquired cystic disease–associated renal cell
carcinoma (ACD-RCC) is the main type of malignancy in patients with
end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We present a case of ACD-RCC in a
patient with acquired solitary kidney and a long history of haemodialysis.
Methods: A 57-year-old male patient with ESRD and ACD due to long
term haemodialysis (since 1996) as result of nephrectomy performed in
1991 for nephrolithiasis complicated with pyonephrosis, was diagnosed
with a tumour mass developed in a large renal cyst. The patient presented
to the Urology Department for surgery. The nephrectomy specimen was
processed for standard histological and immunohistochemical analysis.
Results: Macroscopically, the parenchyma was atrophied, with numerous
variably sized cysts. A circumscribed tumour measuring 4.6 cm in diam-
eter was identified at the lower pole of the kidney, filling a large cystic
Virchows Arch
space. The histological examination revealed an intracystic tumour pro-
liferation with cribriform, solid, papillary and tubulocystic architecture;
the cells had abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei
(WHO/ISUP 3); polarizable calcium oxalate crystals were found within
the tumour structure. The remaining parenchyma showed ESRD-specific
lesions and multiple cysts commonly lined by normal epithelium, focally
with stratified atypical epithelium and small papillae. The tumour was
positive for AMACR and focally for CK7.
Conclusion: The final diagnosis was acquired cystic disease-associated
renal cell carcinoma. The key element of this case consists in the devel-
opment of a tumour mass within an acquired solitary kidney due to uni-
lateral nephrectomy. Neoplasms are often incidental findings in patients
with long-term haemodialysis and subsequently acquired cystic disease.
These patients have an increased risk of developing renal carcinoma;
therefore, an active monitoring is necessary.

*2nd Department of Pathology, National and Kapodistrian University of
Athens School of Medicine, “Attikon” University Hospital, Greece
Background & objectives: Undifferentiated carcinoma of the urinary
bladder with osteoclast-like giant cells (UCOGC) is a rare urothelial car-
cinoma variant with few reported cases in the literature. We herewith
present a case of UCOGC.
Methods: A 77-year-old female was admitted to our hospital due to
hypogastric pain. Cystoscopy with transurethral resection of bladder tu-
mour was performed. After a diagnosis of poorly differentiated urothelial
carcinoma with invasion of muscularis propria, a radical cystectomy was
performed. On gross examination of the urinary bladder, a 2.5 cm large
tumour in the right lateral bladder wall was found.
Results: On microscopic examination, the tumour consisted of mononu-
clear cells with several interspersed multinucleated giant cells. The mono-
nuclear cells were characterized by round- to oval shaped highly pleo-
morphic nuclei with vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Up to
16 mitoses/10 HPF were found. The osteoclast-like giant cells had mul-
tiple, round to oval, bland appearing nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm.
Numerous areas of necrosis and haemorrhage were also found.
Mononuclear cells were stained for CKAE1/AE3, CK7(focally), CK5/
6, P63 and P53. Multinucleated giant cells were stained for CD68, while
epithelial markers were negative. Both components were negative for
GATA3. Our diagnosis was UCOGC based on the above findings.
Conclusion: The differential diagnosis of UCOGC includes other high-
grade tumours with giant cells [sarcomatoid urothelial carcinoma, pleomor-
phic giant cell carcinoma (PGCC) of the bladder and PGCC of the prostate].
UCOGC usually presents at an advanced stage and its prognosis is very poor.

*First Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, The National and
Kapodistrian University of Athens - "Laikon" General Hospital of
Athens, Greece
Background & objectives: Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient
renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), account only for 0.05 to 0.2% of all renal
carcinomas, with limited studies due to their rarity. Here we report a new
case of SDH-deficient RCC.
Methods: Routine examination of an asymptomatic 40-year-old female
patient revealed a right unilateral and unifocal renal mass. The patient
underwent a partial nephrectomy, and the renal specimen was sent for
histopathologic examination.
Results: The tumour was characterized by a solid growth pattern and
consisted of eosinophilic cells with cytoplasmic vacuoles and flocculent
quality. Immunohistochemically the tumour was negative for SDHB deter-
mining the diagnosis of SDH-deficient RCC. Molecular testing revealed a
heterozygous variant NM_003000.3:c.412G>T, p.(Asp138Tyr), in SDHB
gene, that has not, so far, been associated with another SDH deficient renal
cell carcinoma. 12 months following tumour resection, the patient did not
show any signs of regression or metastasis.
Conclusion: We report this case to draw attention to this entity and notice
that eosinophilic RCCs should be examined thoroughly for SDH- defi-
ciency because of its highly syndromic nature.

Mast cells of the bladder with intestinal cystitis
E. Guryanova*, Z. Nadezhda
*I. N. Ulianova Chuvash State University, Russia
Background & objectives: Interstitial cystitis is common in older men
with prostate adenoma. With interstitial cystitis, an increase in the number
of functionally active mast cells, is observed. It is possible that mast cells
may serve as cell markers of this disease.
Methods: The study was carried out on 30 male rats. Experimental ani-
mals were injected into the bladder cavity with protamine sulfate (1st
group); into the wall of the bladder with 0.9% NaCl solution (group 2).
The 3rd group of animals was intact.
Results: On histological sections after 21 days, an increase in the number
of leukocytes in the tissues of the urinary bladder wall of animals of the 1st
group compared with the groups 2 and 3 (p <0.05) was revealed. In animals
of the 1st group, inflammatory infiltration of the bladder wall with lympho-
cytes and neutrophils was noted. In the sections of the bladder wall of the
animals of the 2nd group, oedema, single lymphocytes and neutrophils
were revealed. Mast cells were detected in sections of the bladder wall of
groups 1 and 2, but in group 2 their number was 14 times higher than in
group 1 (p <0.05).
Conclusion: Mast cells are local regulators of homeostasis, secreting
inflammatory mediators and neurotransmitters. Perhaps their participa-
tion in the mechanisms of inflammatory processes in interstitial cystitis.

Extensive intestinal metaplasia of renal pelvis: a rare case report
A. Ieronymaki*, P. Tziakou, M. Papazian, E. Papakonstantinou
*Pathology Department, Thriasio General Hospital of Elefsina, Greece
Background & objectives: Intestinal metaplasia of the urothelium in the
pelvis is a rare finding. Only a few cases have been reported in the
literature worldwide.
Methods: We report a case of a 89 year-old woman, who came to the ER
department, complaining for pain in the right side of the back. X-rays
revealed nephrolithiasis. Right nephrectomy was performed.
Results: Macroscopically, the kidney weighed 321gr. and measured
15X8X6,6cm. The pelvis was dilated, filled with pus. Two large calculi
2,5 and 1,2 cm were also found in the kidney’s calyxes.
The histological examination revealed features of acute pyelonephritis and
necrosis, atrophy and thyroidisation of the renal tubules,
lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltration, fibrosis and extensive intestinal meta-
plasia of the transitional epithelium of the pelvis. Immunohistochemistry
study showed CK20 expression in the goblet cells, CK7 positivity in the
residual transitional epithelium and low ki67 index.
Conclusion: Despite the fact that the specific histological findings were
benign, intestinal metaplasia is usually a high-risk factor for cancer in
similar cases.

Hydrocele in a young patient with an unexpected histopathological
diagnosis: epithelioid mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis testis

Gábos, A. Burszán Barabás, G. Holló, C. Albert
*Emergency County Hospital M-Ciuc, Pathology Department, Romania
Background & objectives: Malignant mesothelioma of the tunica
vaginalis testis is an extremely rare tumour of the paratesticular region,
representing <5% of all mesotheliomas.
Methods: We present a case of a 34 years old male, who was admitted to
the Urologic Department with painless tumefaction of the left scrotum,
without any history of scrotal trauma or asbestos exposure. The clinical
signs were suggestive for hydrocele and a hydrocelectomy was per-
formed. The intraoperatory findings revealed a diffuse thickening of the
tunica vaginalis which was surgically removed.
Results: The tunica vaginalis was infiltrated by an epithelial neoplasm
with tubular and papillary architecture, lined by unistratified cuboidal
cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, slightly pleomorphic nuclei and rare
mitotic figures. The peritumoral stroma was desmoplastic. The tumour
cells expressed Calretinin, WT-1 and EMA, the Ki-67 proliferative index
was <2%. The diagnosis of malignant epithelioid mesothelioma was
made. The patient underwent to a CT-scan and a diffuse thickening of
the left paratesticular region was described, without any evidence for
abdominal or thoracic spread of the disease. An inghinal left orchiectomy
was performed and the tumour has infiltrated the tunica vaginalis and
albugineea, without invasion of the testicular parenchyma, epididimis or
spermatic cord.
Conclusion: The clinical diagnosis of mesothelioma can be very chal-
lenging due to its rarity. Majority of the cases are diagnosed incidentally.
Testicular mesotheliomas tends to appear in older patients, with a mean
age of 60 years. Hydrocele is the most common clinical sign that can be
associated with painful scrotal masses. The aetiology remains still un-
clear: asbestos exposure, scrotal trauma and long lasting hydrocele has
been reported as possible risk factors.

Rare malacoplakia of the prostate: presentation with three cases
A. Isal*, C. Yazıcı, S. Karabag
*Tekirdag Namik Kemal University, Pathology Department, Turkey
Background & objectives: Malakoplakia is rare type of inflammatory
reaction that usually results from Escherichia coli infection of the genito-
urinary tract. İt is emphasised that recognition of prostatic malakoplakia
as an entity will prevent its confusion with prostatic carcinoma.
Methods: The 63-58-73 years old men presented with a history of in-
creasing difficulty of urination, frequency, and nocturia for several years.
E. coli was the causative microorganism in only one of the case urine
culture. No microorganism growth was observed in urine culture in the
other two cases. Them had firm and nodular prostates in his digital rectal
examination.
Results: Case 1 - Prostatectomy was performed and a prostatic mass
weighing 20 g was submitted for histological examination.
Histologically collections of clear foamy histiocytes (Von Hansemann),
lymphocytes, plasmocytse were seen nearby the acinar adenocarcinoma
component.
Case 2 - TUR-P materials were evaluated with hematoxylin eosin stains
and under light microscopy. Final pathological diagnosis was
malakoplakia for prostate specimens.
Case 3 - Transrectal ultrasonography by prostate size was measured 42 cc
and the prostate parenchyma was heterogeneous. Prostate tru-cut biopsy
specimens were evaluated with hematoxylin eosin stains and under light
microscopy. The staining reactions of these were similar to those of case
1and 2 with light microscopic findings, PAS reactions and positive
Prussian blue reaction.
Conclusion: We defined malacoplakia as adjacent to a prostate tumour in
one of our cases and as a solitary lesion in the other two cases. E. coli was
detected in the urine culture of only one of every three cases. We wanted
to share with the literature that malacoplakia can mimic carcinoma with
its clinical findings and it is a rare entity that should be kept in mind in
both TUR-P and prostate core biopsies.

Poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma of basal cell/adenoid
cystic type
L. Karelis*, G. Stanc, N. Novkovic, D. Petsis, M. Papadopoulos, N.
Goulas, G. Soursos, C. Valavanis
*"Metaxas" Memorial Cancer Hospital, Pathology Department, Greece
Background & objectives: Basal cell/adenoid cystic adenocarcinoma is
an exceptionally rare prostatic malignancy with distinctive histopatholog-
ical and biological features and behaviour varying from indolent to ex-
tremely aggressive. We present a case of poorly differentiated, aggres-
sive, basal cell/adenoid cystic prostatic adenocarcinoma with fulminant
progression.
Methods: A 65-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with elevated
serum PSA (29ng/ml). Imaging tests showed a prostatic tumour infiltrat-
ing the urinary bladder and rectum, a left kidney solid mass, involvement
of abdominal lymph nodes, liver and bone secondary lesions. Biopsy of
the prostatic tumour was performed. The patient deteriorated rapidly and
succumbed 20 days after his arrival.
Results: Histopathologic examination revealed a malignant neoplasm
composed of small to medium sized cells with distinctive eosinophilic
nucleoli and high mitotic count, arranged in solid nests with focal adenoid
formations. Immunohistochemically the neoplastic cells were positive for
CK903, AR and bcl-2, focally positive for PSAP and p63 (few cells), and
weakly positive (few cells) for Chromogranin-A and CDX-2. PSA,
AMACR, Synaptophysin and CD56 were negative. Ki-67 was 80%, c-
kit was expressed in 80% of tumour cells and HER-2 was negative (CISH
method). The morphological and immunohistochemical findings were
compatible with a poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma of basal
cell/adenoid cystic type.
Conclusion: Basal cell/adenoid cystic prostatic adenocarcinoma is an
extremely rare neoplasm with poor prognosis for advanced and metastatic
cases. The management strategy for those cases isn't well defined yet.
Although current literature considers this as an indolent neoplasm with
relatively low metastatic potential our case not only stands against it but
also poses plausible diagnostic dilemmas. It's a malignancy that shouldn't
be disregarded at the differential diagnosis considering its unique clinical
and biological features, treatment implications and potentially lethal
prognosis.

Feasibility of using 34betаE 12, D2-40, and АЕ1/АЕ3 cytokeratins in
P504S-positive ASAP and prostate adenocarcinomas
E. Kazachkov*, A. Dub, I. Cheter, A. Boyko, D. Voropaev, A. Koshkina,
K. Galiulina
*South Ural State Medical University, Russia
Background & objectives: It is necessary to clarify which markers are
more effective for identification of the basal epithelium in the diagnosis of
precancerous processes and prostate carcinoma. Pancytokeratin AE1/
AE3 is a promising marker for stratification of patients by risk groups.
Methods: We used prostate biopsy samples obtained from 90 patients,
which were divided into 6 groups according to the morphological diag-
nosis: ASAP and the carcinomas of Grade Groups 1-5. Normal prostate
tissue samples served as controls. We performed an immunohistochem-
ical staining method using 34betaE12, D2-40, АЕ1/АЕ3, and P504S
antibodies. We applied non-parametric statistical methods.
Virchows Arch
Results: In the control group, the 34betaE12 expression [Me = 13% (3-
36)] was noted in 100% of cases. In ASAP and Grade Group 1-5 adeno-
carcinomas, there was a complete absence of 34betaE12 in all cases. The
level of D2-40 expression in the basal epithelial cells was found only in
the control samples (Me = 37.5% [14-47]). In ASAP (P504S+ phenotype)
and Grade Group 1-5 adenocarcinomas, D2-40 was not expressed. The
highest and most intense expression of AE1/AE3 was observed in Grade
Group 2 adenocarcinoma (3 points) [Me = 67% (61-69)]. The lowest
level of pancytokeratin AE1/AE3 expression was in Grade Group 5 ad-
enocarcinoma (p <0.0001).
Conclusion: D2-40 and 34betaE12 markers can be interchangeable in the
diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Taking into account the “dose-dependent”
effect of the AE1 / AE3 marker may help to stratify patients by risk
groups.

Cystic trophoblastic tumour: a rare case presenting as post-
chemotherapy mediastinal tumour
T. Korpeoglu*, I.I. Gonul
*Department of Pathology, Gazi University Faculty of Medicine, Turkey
Background & objectives: Cystic trophoblastic tumour (CTT) is an
uncommon germ cell tumour that is usually seen as residual disease in
post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) in
patients with testicular germ cell tumour; however, they may also occur
in the untreated testis.
Methods: Our case is a 21-year-old male patient diagnosed with mixed
germ cell tumour (embryonal carcinoma 80%, teratoma 20%) after left
orchiectomy. In the follow-up of the patient who received chemotherapy
after orchiectomy, there was a mild serum ß-hCG elevation (11 mIU/mL)
and multiple masses in the mediastinum were detected on thorax CT
imaging. Three of these masses were resected.
Results: Macroscopically, the largest of the tumours was 11 cm in diam-
eter and all had a similar appearance. The cut surfaces are heterogeneous
with solid and cystic areas. Solid areas were predominantly composed of
cartilage. Histopathology of resection specimens demonstrated pure ter-
atoma. However, in the examination of the largest tumour, a cystic space
lined with non-epithelial cells and filled with eosinophilic fibrinoid ma-
terial was noted. The cyst was lined by varying thickness of mostly
mononucleated degenerative-looking trophoblastic cells with abundant
eosinophilic cytoplasm and smudged nuclei. Some of the cells had
intracytoplasmic lacunae. Immunohistochemically, these cells were nu-
clear positive with p63 and GATA3 and negative with SALL4, human
placental lactogen and hCG.
Conclusion: CTT is a relatively new and uncommon entity. After che-
motherapy, CTT does not show the high frequency of progressive disease
and it does not warrant additional chemotherapy, although it is important
to continue to carefully monitor these patients on follow-up. The distinc-
tion between CTT and choriocarcinoma is very important as it has im-
portant implications for patient management and prognosis. Unlike CTT,
patients with residual choriocarcinoma after chemotherapy have a poor
prognosis and aggressive treatment is warranted.

*Sahloul Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia
Background&objectives:Melanomametastasescausethevastmajorityof
morbidityandmortalityassociatedwiththisdisease.Melanomasarecapable
of metastasizing to both regional and distant sites. The most common clini-
cally apparent sites of distant metastases are lung, skin, liver and bone.
Methods: A 45-year-old Tunisian woman, with a history of melanoma of
the thigh treated surgically, consulted for lumbago. Imaging revealed a
mass of the left renal compartment measuring 20 cm taking the kidney
and the adrenal gland and suggesting a primary tumour or a metastasis.
Results: During the surgery, six biopsies were taken and sent to our
Pathology Department for frozen section examination, which concluded
to a malignant proliferation. The surgeon found that the mass was too close
to vascular structures and judged that the mass was inextirpable. Other
biopsies were realized. After formalin fixation and paraffin embedding,
the histopathological examination confirmed the malignant proliferation.
The tumour cells were highly atypical. They had large oval or pleomorphic
hyperchromatic nuclei, eosinophilic cytoplasm and some distinct nucleoli.
Many mitotic figures and melanin pigments were present. On immunohis-
tochemistry, the tumour cells were HMB-45 and Melan-A positive. The
mass was diagnosed as a metastasis of melanoma to the renal compartment.
Conclusion: Although malignant melanoma is known to metastasize
to all organs, it is almost impossible to predict which localization
will be invaded from a given primary site. Clinical diagnosis of
metastatic melanoma in the kidney, ureter, prostate, and other parts
of the genitourinary tract is still difficult. Consequently, the diagno-
sis of metastatic melanoma remains based on microscopy and im-
munohistochemistry findings.

Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the prostate with chondrosarcomatous
differentiation: a rare case presenting as lower urinary tract
symptoms
S. Menon*, P. Nisarga, G. Bakshi, V. Murthy, S. Desai
*Pathology, Tata Memorial Centre HBNI, India
Background & objectives: Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the prostate is an
uncommon diagnosis. They portend aggressive behaviour and a dismal
prognosis.
Methods: We report a rare case of sarcomatoid carcinoma of the prostate
with chondrosarcomatous differentiation which presented with a history
of lower urinary tract symptoms and unusual radiological findings
Results: A 65-year-old man presented with dysuria and hesitancy. Serum
PSA level was 8.77 ng/mL. MRI revealed a large heterogeneous mass
involving the entire prostate seen extending up to the right lateral pelvic
wall. On PET-CECT, foci of uptake were seen in the prostate and multi-
ple enlarged right external iliac lymph nodes. Histomorphology con-
firmed a biphasic epithelial and mesenchymal malignancy with prostatic
adenocarcinoma component of Gleason pattern 4 and the sarcomatous
component composed of chondrosarcomatous and undifferentiated spin-
dle cell sarcoma. The adenocarcinoma component was positive for AE1/
AE3, PSA, NKX3.1, AR and HMWCK (focal), while are negative for
GATA3, p63, p40 immunostains The sarcomatous component was neg-
ative for PSA, NKX3.1, GATA3.
Conclusion: Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the prostate is an aggressive var-
iant of prostate cancer. It may present as locally advanced prostate cancer.
Chondrosarcomatous dedifferentiation is extremely rare in prostate
carcinoma.

A rare case of paratesticular mesothelioma successfully treated by
surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy
K. Murshed*, F. Alloush, N. Taha, M. Ben-Gashir
*Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar
Background & objectives: Mesothelioma is a malignant neoplasm that
arises most commonly from body cavities such as pleura, peritoneum and
pericardium. Its occurrence in the paratesticular region is an extremely
rare event.
Virchows Arch
Methods: We describe a case of a 31-year-old male patient, smok-
er, who presented with left hydrocele that gradually increased in
size for 8 months duration. Imaging studies revealed a
paratesticular mass. Surgical resection of the mass and histopath-
ologic examination along with appropriate panel of immunohisto-
chemical stains were performed.
Results: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a well-
defined tunica-based soft tissue mass measuring 4 cm with another
smaller nodule on left scrotal sac measuring 0.9 cm. Radial orchi-
ectomy was performed. Histopathologic examination revealed two
foci of tumour, both are composed of solid sheets of epithelioid
tumour cells that are diffusely immunoreactive for WT1,
calretinin, D2-40, but negative for Ber-Ep4, CEA and CD15.
The diagnosis of multifocal epithelioid mesothelioma was ren-
dered. There was no previous history of asbestos exposure. The
patient received 6 cycles of cisplatin and pemetrexed. He was
followed up by imaging studies for 1 year, which revealed no
evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis.
Conclusion: Paratesticular mesotheliomas are rare. Only 30-40% of
cases have previous history of asbestos exposure. Although unusu-
al, mesothelioma should be considered in patients presenting with
hydrocele of unknown aetiology, so they can get utmost benefit of
early diagnosis and treatment.

Primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the testis with a Merkel cell
carcinoma-like immunophenotype: does primary testicular Merkel
cell carcinoma exist?

Stella, M.M. Gerardini, P. Pedrazzoli, M. Paulli
*Unit of Anatomic Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine,
University of Pavia, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Italy
Background & objectives: Testicular neuroendocrine neoplasms
(NENs), which account for less than 1% of testicular tumours,
can be divided into three categories: pure well-differentiated neu-
roendocrine tumours (NETs), well-differentiated NETs associated
with teratoma elements, and secondary NENs, including rare
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) metastases.
Methods: An 80-year-old man, without a NEN history, underwent rad-
ical orchifunicolectomy for a painless left testicular mass. On gross ex-
amination, the testis was partially replaced by a nodular, yellow-tan,
unevenly capsulated mass, measuring 2.5x2x1 cm. Both testis and tu-
mour mass were entirely submitted. No clinical or imaging evidence of
synchronous neoplastic lesions was found.
Results: The neoplasm was confined to the testicular parenchyma and
was composed of small, highly atypical cells with a high nuclear/
cytoplasmic ratio and hyperchromatic nuclei, arranged in irregular solid
islands and sheets. Stromal desmoplasia, necrosis and mitotic figures
(>50/10HPF) were present; no teratomatous or non-neuroendocrine neo-
plastic (either seminomatous or non-seminomatous) components were
identified. Neoplastic cells showed diffuse positivity for pan-cytokeratin,
synaptophysin, CD56, Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2
(SATB2), and dot-like reactivity for cytokeratin 20, while stains for
CD45, TTF1, and chromogranin-A were negative. Ki-67 proliferative
index was 70%. The diagnosis of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine
carcinoma (NEC) was made, with an immunophenotype resembling that
of an MCC.
Conclusion: We here reported a unique case of a patient with a primary
NEC of the testis with MCC-like immunophenotype, who is still alive 15
months after surgery. Although most of testicular NENs are primary well-
differentiated NETs or secondary NECs, the exceptionally rare possibility
of a primary NEC of the testis should also be considered.

Rare presentation of a common childhood tumour: Wilms’ tumour
in an adult patient
Z.C. Olgun*, G. Kir, L. Samadova
*Medeniyet University Prof. Dr. Suleyman Yalcin City Hospital
Department of Pathology, Turkey
Background & objectives: Wilms’ tumour (WT) is one of the most
common malignant tumours of childhood. However, WT in adults is rare,
about 3% of all described WT cases. There are diagnostic and therapeutic
difficulties because there are no specific radiographic findings.
Methods: We report a 38-year-old female presenting with flank pain. CT
examination revealed a solid mass measuring 9 cms, originates from the
right kidney with several thoracal metastatic lesions. A clinical diagnosis
of renal cell carcinoma was made, and radical nephrectomy was
performed.
Results: Tumour was majorly composed of small to medium sized un-
differentiated cells with relatively small regular nuclei and small nucleoli
with frequent mitotic figures. Also, there were focal areas consisting of
spindle shaped cells and poorly differentiated epithelial-like areas.
Immunohistochemical studies showed diffuse nuclear staining with
WT-1, and focal positivity with PANCK. CD99, CK7, Synaptophysin
was negative. FISH examination for the EWSR1 gene showed no signs of
fusion. Based on the presence of focal epithelial and stromal components
together with undifferentiated component and compatible ancillary stud-
ies, this tumour was classified as a WT with dominant blastemal compo-
nent. The tumour was staged as stage II according to Children's Oncology
Group (COG) Staging System.
Conclusion: WT in adults is extremely rare and has a poorer prognosis
than paediatric WT. Histopathologically, there is no difference between
adult and childhood WT. Due to the scarcity of cases in the literature,
there are no standard protocols for the management of adult WT, and
therefore, it is managed as paediatric WTs.

A 30-year-old man with testicular embryonal carcinoma presenting
as a neck mass: a case report
S. Rjabceva*, M. Fridman, A. Syantovich, N. Kornev
*Institute of Physiology of NAS of Belarus, Belarus
Background & objectives: Testicular germ cell tumours often show
overlapping morphologic features and can mimic one another and mimic
non-germ cell tumours. Embryonal carcinoma is the second most com-
mon histological type of testicular tumour. We presented an unusual case
of testicular embryonal carcinoma.
Methods: We reported a case of a 30-year-old male who presented with a
2-months history of a progressively enlarging neck mass. Clinical details,
pathologic features, immunohistochemical profile were analysed.
Results: CT scan of the neck showed a left supraclavicular neck
mass (8.9 x 7.4 cm). The first tissue core biopsy showed solid
tumour that was consisted of large, epithelioid cells with indistinct
cell borders, pale cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei. Tumour cells
were positive with TTF1 and negative with thyroglobulin. CT scan
of chest was normal. The second core biopsy showed two histolog-
ical tumour patterns: solid and pseudoglandular with fibrous stroma.
Tumour cells were positive with CK, SALL4, OCT3/4, CD30
(focally) and Glypican 3 (focally). The α-fetoprotein (1000 ng/ml)
and human chorionic gonadotropin (274 U/l) were increased.
Ultrasound of left testicle demonstrated a solitary calcified mass
(8.0 x 9.0 mm).
Conclusion: A high index of suspicion allows diagnosing testicular em-
bryonal carcinoma. The first clinical manifestation of embryonal carcino-
ma can be as a large neck mass without local symptoms in testis.

Testicular cancer should be strongly considered in the differential diag-
nosis of neck lymph node metastases, especially in case, when tumour
cell of testicular n embryonal carcinoma are positive with TTF1.

Prostatic adenocarcinoma with Paneth cell-like neuroendocrine
differentiation
D. Sá*, A. Duarte, F. Costa, J.R. Vizcaíno
*Service of Anatomic Pathology, Hospital Santo António, Centro
Hospitalar Universitário do Porto (CHUP), Portugal
Background & objectives: Variants of conventional prostatic acinar
adenocarcinomas are uncommon, accounting for 5% to 10% of the cases.
Prostatic adenocarcinoma with Paneth cell-like differentiation is a rare
subtype of prostate adenocarcinoma that usually presents with patchy
cells having prominent eosinophilic neuroendocrine granules.
Methods: We present a case of a 65-year-old man that on a follow-up
urologic consultation was submitted to a MRI that showed a right apex
PI-RADS 5 lesion and a left apex PI-RADS 4 lesion. Subsequently,
a guided prostate needle biopsy was performed, and the histologic
examination showed an acinar adenocarcinoma Gleason grade 7
(3+4).
Results: The patient was submitted to a radical prostatectomy, and we
received a prostatectomy specimen weighing 90g and measuring 6x5x5
cm. The cut surface was heterogeneous with microcystic and compact
areas. The seminal vesicles and ductus deferentes were unremarkable.
The histologic examination showed a bilateral acinar adenocarcinoma
Gleason grade 7 (4+3) with some of the acini composed of cells resem-
bling Paneth cells that immunohistochemically expressed neuroendocrine
markers such as synaptophysin and chromogranin. The neoplasia infil-
trated the peri-prostatic soft tissues and perineural invasion was observed.
The seminal vesicles and ductus deferentes were not involved by the
adenocarcinoma.
Conclusion: Paneth-Cell-like differentiation in prostate cancer is charac-
terized by tumour cells with eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules that are
positive for neuroendocrine markers by immunohistochemistry. Unlike
Paneth cells of the small intestine, these cells are negative for lysozyme
and IgA and positive for neuroendocrine markers. It is advocated that the
Paneth cell component of these tumours should not be graded because
they have a favourable prognosis even if they have an architecture that
would be assigned a Gleason pattern 5.

Renal pelvis urothelial carcinoma and concomitant incidental chro-
mophobe renal cell carcinoma, a case report from an Egyptian can-
cer centre
A. Soliman*, M. Adel, A.S. Rezk, A. Rabea, N. Magdy
*Pathology Department, Shefaa El-Orman Oncology Hospital, Egypt
Background & objectives: Simultaneous ipsilateral renal pelvis urothelial
carcinoma (UC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is extremely rare, with less
than 100 reported cases in the English literature. Herein, we report a case of
renal pelvis UC with an incidentally found chromophobe RCC.
Methods: A 64-year-old man presented to our hospital with right flank
pain and haematuria. Patient is a heavy smoker. Computed tomography
(CT) revealed enlarged right kidney with dilated pelvicalyceal system
with markedly thinned-out renal parenchyma. The lower calyx showed
an irregular soft tissue mass lesion 5x4.5x8 cm, infiltrating perirenal fat.
Multiple enlarged perihilar and aorto-caval lymph nodes were also seen.
Results: Right radical nephrectomy was performed. The specimen showed
dilated pelvi-calyceal system with papillary tumour, invading renal capsule
and peri-nephric fat. Also, incidentally found, a fairly defined renal cortex
mass 2x1 cm, golden yellow in cut section. Microscopic findings of the
pelvic mass showed a high-grade papillary UC, positive for GATA3 and
negative for PAX8. invading the muscularis propria, renal parenchyma,
renal capsule and perirenal fat. The cortical mass revealed chromophobe
RCC, positive for PAX8, negative for GATA3. All L.nodes were negative
for metastases. Postoperatively, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy
(Gemcitabine-Carboplatin protocol) for 6 cycles. MDT decided a follow-
up cystoscopy every three months. No complication, or disease progression
over the follow-up period.
Conclusion: Concomitant UC and RCC in the same kidney is extremely
rare, with no readily identifiable risk factors for this simultaneous occur-
rence, yet 24% of the reported cases were smokers. In our case, RCC was
pathologic stage pT1a and the UC was pT3. Pathologists should be aware
of the possibility of synchronous renal tumours, as they do rarely occur.
Proper extensive sampling and the use of proper immunostaining panels are
both required and helpful to identify the rare concomitant renal tumours.

*Institute of Clinical Pathology, Wolfsburg Hospital, Germany
Background & objectives: Basal cell carcinoma of the prostate (BCCP)
is extremely rare and accounts for 0.01% of all prostate cancers with only
99 reported cases in the literature. We report a rare case of a BCCP with
infiltration of the urinary bladder.
Methods: We present the case of a 53-year-old man who complained of
lower urinary tract symptoms for 2 years. His serum prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) was within normal range. Due to the persistent symptoms
and suspected palpation findings, cystoscopy with subsequent transure-
thral prostate resection was performed. Histopathology of the resected
specimens suggested BCCP. Radical cystectomy with lymph node dis-
section was performed.
Results: Pathological examination revealed a small nest-like basaloid cell
carcinoma. Both urinary bladder sidewalls were infiltrated with basaloid
cells with large pleomorphic nuclei and scant cytoplasm, with peripheral
palisading. Tumour cells were forming large solid nests with central ne-
crosis and were infiltrating the muscular layer. Immunohistochemical
examination revealed that tumour cells were positive for p63, bcl2,
34betaE12, Ki-67 (15-30%) whereas for cytokeratins 7, 20, uroplakin,
p504s and TTF-1 negative. PSA and androgen receptor (AR) were, how-
ever, partially positive. The resection margins were negative and there
were no metastases in 34 examined lymph nodes. The patient was free
from recurrence 6 months after operation.
Conclusion: BCCP is a very uncommon disease, and the most common
symptoms include nocturia, urgency and acute urinary retention. Serum
PSA levels are usually within normal range and according to the guide-
lines a Gleason score should not be assigned. Treatment strategies are
limited and include hormone therapy, radiotherapy, radical surgical re-
section, or a combination but with poor prognosis.

V. Zakharava*, P. Kisialeu, E. Cherstvoy
*Belarusian State Medical University, Belarus
Background & objectives: Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma
(MTSCC) is a relatively rare renal cell carcinoma (RCC) that was defined
in the 2004 WHO Classification and initially presents as low-grade RCC.
To report the pathologic features of case of MTSCC of kidney.
Virchows Arch
Methods: Morphology study and immunohistochemistry of MTSCC of
kidney was performed. Immunohistochemistry profile: RCC negative
with focal expression in the tubular structures, CK7, EMA and
AMACR high and moderate positive with prevalence in the tubular com-
ponent without mucin, totally positive Vimentin and focally NSE, CD10
and CK20 negative, Ki-67 proliferative index 0,9-2,8%.
Results: A 62yo man consulted following tumour of the upper pole
of the left kidney. Nephradrenalectomy with lymphadenectomy was
subsequently performed. Histologically, the tumour was well
circumscribed with rim of compressed fibrous tissue but had focal
invasion in the renal sinus and no metastases. MTSCC showed
prevalence tubular and cord-like growth component with solidifi-
cation and focal myxoid stroma with abundant extracellular mucin.
Tumour cells had uniform, bland, low grade morphology with eo-
sinophilic, focally vacuolated cytoplasm. Numerous haemorrhages
and focal foamy macrophages was observed, with no necrosis and
no inflammation. Although adjuvant chemotherapy was no per-
formed, the patient is still alive 6 years after nephrectomy without
metastasis and recurrence of the tumour.
Conclusion: We report case of MTSCC of kidney pT3aN0 Grade 2
shares histologic and immunohistochemical overlap with papillary renal
cell carcinoma (RCC negative with focal expression, CK7, EMA and
AMACR high and moderate positive with prevalence in the tubular com-
ponent without mucin, Vimentin totally positive and focally of NSE,
CD10 and CK20 negative, Ki-67 proliferative index 0,9-2,8%) with a
favourable 5-year progression free survival prognosis.

Background & objectives: Molecular exploration of thyroid nodules
with indeterminate cytology of Bethesda classification has been recom-
mended to improve the management. Here, we evaluated the feasibility
and performance of a rapid and fully automated-PCR test (Idylla) for
NRAS/BRAF mutation detection on LB-FNA.
Methods: 36 thyroid LB-FNAs were included. Residual PreservCyt ma-
terials were split in two aliquots; one to assess the BRAF/NRAS muta-
tional status using the standard High-Resolution Melting (HRM) ap-
proach and the other to compare with the Idylla essay. For five samples,
dilutions were made on a third split to assess the Idylla limit of detection.
Results: 36 samples presented either BRAFV600E mutation (n=25),
BRAFK601E mutation (1), NRASQ61R mutation (5), or no mutation
(5) on HRM. Idylla essay showed a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity
of 83%, with only two discordant results (one was a BRAFK601E mu-
tant, which is not covered by the Idylla test; the second, a BRAFV600E
mutated FNA, showed a NRASQ61R false-positive result associated with
a weak BRAFV600E amplification). Dilution of BRAFV600E (n=3) and
NRASQ61R (n=2) mutated samples up to a DNA level of 50 ng showed
concordant results on the Idylla essay.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the Idylla approach can be
directly performed on residual PreservCyt material from thyroid LB-
FNA. Idylla essay is sensitive with a limit of detection inferior to DNA
amounts obtained in routine. A thorough verification of the amplification
curves is necessary to avoid artefact curves. Idylla NRAS/BRAF muta-
tion essay could be used in practice to quickly orientate the final diagnosis
of indeterminate thyroid nodules.

Evaluation of a rapid and sensitive molecular screening strategy for
mutation detection in lung cancer (suitable for use in a pathology
laboratory)
A. Newman*, V. Vaz, S. Munroe, C. Guy
*UH Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, United Kingdom
Background & objectives: We propose that initial rapid pre-screening
for KRAS mutations in NSCLC at initial histological diagnosis can iden-
tify patients not eligible for current tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) thera-
pies, thereby reducing unnecessary testing; provide cost savings and more
timely, definitive treatment planning.
Methods: 57 NSCLC cases previously routinely screened for EGFR, ALK
and ROS1 by real time PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) respectively
were tested using the Real Time PCR Biocartis Idylla KRAS Mutation Test.
Results: KRAS mutations were found in 29.8% (17/57) of NSCLC cases.
KRAS (G12C) was most commonly detected, accounting for 12 of the 17
KRAS mutated cases (70.5%). KRAS mutations were mutually exclusive
of EGFR, ALK and ROS1. EGFR mutations were identified in 17% (10/
57) of cases. Current NICE guidance recommends testing for EGFR, ALK
and ROS1 with an approximate cost of £250 per patient. The proposed
KRAS pre-screening method followed by single gene testing would cost an
average of £252 per patient. Large panel next generation sequencing (NGS)
costs approximately £350 per patient compared to rapid KRAS pre-
screening prior to NGS testing which costs on average £308 per patient.
Conclusion: Our study shows rapid pre-screening for KRAS mutations
in NSCLC can be achieved in a matter of hours from initial histological
diagnosis along with PD-L1 status. It can eliminate the need for further
single gene or panel testing in almost 30% of cases. These patients can
begin a definitive treatment plan within days of diagnosis with no addi-
tional costs for testing and a potential reduction in clinical appointments.

Digital imaging of fluorescent in-situ hybridization in pathology:
application procedure, experience and challenges

*Department of Pathology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine,
Turkey
Background & objectives: FISH is a time-consuming procedure on
fluorescent microscope with interpretation errors, caused by fading or
orientation problems etc. Digital scanning seems a good solution for these
problems. Herein, we share our experience and challenges during digita-
lization procedure of FISH slides.
Methods: Slides of tissue microarrays and sections of individual cases
immune-stained for dual HER-2 amplification probe and ALK, EWSR
and SYT break-apart probes were evaluated by fluorescent microscope in
1000x magnification with immersion oil. After removing the immersion
oil, slides were scanned via Olympus VS120 slide scanning system, and
reviewed by OlyVIA Ver.2.9.1, reaching up to 1200x magnification.
Virchows Arch
Results: In the tissue microarray scanning procedure, we observed that
auto-focusing was more difficult than manual-focusing. Besides, immer-
sion oil residue caused both auto and manual focusing errors. In order to
remove immersion oil, we used dripping alcohol by a pipette, and wiped it
with tissue paper. The orientation of the tissue was better when a pathol-
ogist chose the proper area to focus. Scanning magnification was 400x,
which provided an optimal resolution with optic + digital zoom (up to
1200x). However, in this magnification, scanning time increased up to 36
hours for whole TMA. For individual cases, we chose a representative
limited area (max 3mm in diameter) to reduce scanning time.
Conclusion: Digital scanning of FISH slides seems a better option with
better core orientation in scanned tissue microarrays, which is problem-
atic in conventional fluorescent microscope. Additionally, it is a good
solution to keep FISH slides without signal fading, ready to take picture
any time. Another advantage, it provides higher magnification compared
to conventional fluorescence microscope. The most prominent disadvan-
tage is limited Z-axis compared to conventional microscope. Proper re-
moval of the immersion oil is a key point for manual and auto focusing.

Upconversion nanoparticles as labels for histopathological tissue
evaluation
K. Krawczyk*, M.J. Mickert, S. Andersson-Engels
*Lumito AB, Sweden
Background & objectives: H&E together with DAB labelling, the gold
standard in pathology, suffer from narrow dynamic range, difficulties in
quantification and limited possibilities regarding multiplexing. We pres-
ent an upconversion-nanoparticle (UCNP)-based technique that allows to
overcome problems associated with commonly used labelling techniques.
Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast cancer cell line and
human breast cancer tissue were sectioned and labelled. Upconversion im-
aging of the human tissue sections was conducted in our prototype device
and compared with a standard DAB-based IHC. The combination of UCNP
and haematoxylin counterstaining on the same slide was investigated.
Results: Images obtained with our novel device demonstrate that our
UCNP bioconjugates are excellent labels for the detection of cancer
markers in tissue sections. Brightfield images prove that UCNPs do not
interfere with the standard tissue evaluation by a pathologist. Additionally,
brightfield and luminescent images can be merged to provide a better
understanding of tissue morphology.
Conclusion: The emerging field of UCNP-based labelling techniques
provides new possibilities for more accurate diagnosis. Staining solutions
and a novel device developed by us keep the advantage of H&E staining
and combine it, in one image, with the UCNP luminescent data. The high-
contrast images of the UCNP labelling–generated by our scanning de-
vice–set the foundation for generating ground truth for machine learning
algorithms.

Annotation in digital pathology: how to get started? Our experience
in classification tasks in pathology
D.Montezuma*,J.Fraga,S.Oliveira,P.Neto,A.Monteiro,I.MacedoPinto
*IMP Diagnostics, Portugal
Background & objectives: Training machine learning models, for AI
application in Pathology, often requires extensive annotation by human
experts, but there is little guidance on this subject. We aim to describe our
experience and fill in this gap.
Methods: The current study ran in parallel with the annotation of colo-
rectal whole-slide images for the development of a classification
algorithm. In this work, we followed a constructive design research meth-
od: 1. Choice of annotation level; 2. Choice of software (testing QuPath,
Sedeen, Leica’s Aperio ImageScope); 3. Choice of input device (mouse
vs. pen/pad); 4. Addressing common problems in annotation.
Results: Phase 1. Performed in articulation with the IT team, defined the
annotation level that was needed. The objective of our parallel study was
to develop a classification algorithm, and we opted for a wide tissue
segmentation approach (vs. gland-level segmentation). Cases with only
slide-level labels were also added. Phase 2. Sedeen was the chosen anno-
tation software (due to easy-to-use polygonal tool/erasing option and
exportation format); Phase 3. Performance of the drawing pen/pad
surpassed the mouse, but when considering cost-usefulness, the mouse
was chosen; Phase 4. Some addressed problems were which fragments to
annotate, how to deal with low image quality/colour discrepancies, need-
ed detail when drawing/contouring, file transfer, etc.
Conclusion: Annotation methodology will vary significantly according to
the study’s objectives, but common issues will be present across different
settings. It seems intimidating to initiate the annotation effort, since there is
a lack of general guidelines. It is crucial that pathologists work closely
together with the IT team to achieve the project objectives. Choosing ade-
quate and comfortable tools is also relevant. Finally, we present solutions
for common issues in the annotation procedure and provide guidance to
beginners in this process.

*Ivannikov Institute, Russia
Background & objectives: Immunohistochemical analysis of endome-
trium with antibodies to oestrogen and progesterone receptors is a useful
method for detection of the violation in their expression which helps to
indicates the implantation window and implementation of implantation
insufficiency of the eutopic endometrium.
Methods: The manual scoring of the slides is hard and thus prone to
errors due to their size and the enormous amount of distinct objects, thus
automated scoring methods are required. In the current work, we present a
multistage machine-based approach, which can perform high efficiency
and reproducible scoring of endometrial stained cells.
Results: The stages are the following: the segmentation of epithelium and
stroma, nuclei detection and classification and the calculation of the score.
The segmentationstage isbasedon the U-net model. Eachstage isevaluated
separately:forsegmentationanddetectionstagestwodatasetswerecollected
and labelled in manual and semi-manual manner. The segmentation model
achieves 92% intersection over union (IoU). This framework provides not
only a robust and reproducible scoring system but also has the advantage of
thevisualizationandinterpretationoftheresultsobtainedondifferentstages.
Conclusion: We believe that this approach can greatly increase the speed
and the quality of immunohistochemical analysis.
