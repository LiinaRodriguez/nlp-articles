Nanoscale size-dependent properties give nanomaterials unique specifications that are robust in many ap-
plications of human medicine. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have recently gained attention because of their
unique optical, physical and electrical properties. AuNPs increase the efficacy of biomedical applications in
diagnostic treatments for infectious diseases, by targeting or labeling target cells/bioactive compounds.
However, it is imperative to develop the regimens for more accurate diagnostic tools, preventive care and
effective therapy. Our critical and comprehensive review presents emerging avenues of molecular diag-
nostics as well as therapeutics translated into clinical approaches. This manuscript critically reviews the
rampant future of AuNPs in the diagnosis and treatment of the most important diseases, such as cancer
and viruses of respiratory system.

Respiratory infections in humans are attributed to cause some of the major global pandemics and hyper endemics
faced by mankind. Classical and current examples of viral respiratory diseases include: inﬂuenza virus, severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1), novel corona virus 2019 (nCoV-19) and respiratory syncytial virus. Recently,
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), generally known as SARS-CoV-2, is not the only global health issue
but is the reason for universal fatality on a large scale [1]. There is a need to comprehensively review new challenges
of one of most widely applied gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) against several pathogens. Hence, nanotechnology
encompassing quantum dots, functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) and exclusive diagnostic mechanisms for designing
vaccines and nanodrug delivery have opened up enormous avenues for inhibiting pathogenic viruses internalization
and replication. However, expeditious diagnostics and therapeutic scopes against epidemics, along with vaccine
augmentation for the prophylactic control of pathogens, are some of the major AuNPs applications.
Major bacterial diseases of the respiratory system include tuberculosis, streptococcal infections and infections
with MRSA, VRSA and MSSA, whooping cough (Bordetella infection) and diphtheria. These fungal infections are
caused by aspergillus and histoplasma species. Most importantly, the carcinomas of the respiratory system (lungs
in particular) are the second most prevalent and fatal type of cancers globally. Most importantly, the rapid spread
and difﬁcult control due to the air-borne transmission of COVID-19 virus indicates its highly pathogenic nature
compared with other respiratory viruses [1]. Pneumonia and other organs affected by COVID-19 can present a
great clinical challenge to patient’s and the associated caregiver’s health. The high prevalence and contagious nature
indicates the need to develop workable and efﬁcient solutions to the pathogens of the respiratory system.
Pneumonia claims 18% of child deaths (<5 years of age) worldwide [2]. The risk of contracting respiratory diseases
may increase signiﬁcantly with host factors such as hereditary make up, age, smoking, obesity, alcohol consumption,
occupational exposure and environmental factors [3,4]. It has been shown that early detection of cancer may save
patients from severe clinical disease. However, in resource-limited countries, the access to healthcare systems for
diagnosis is lacking. Cancer is characterized by invasive, uncontrolled and rapid cell division in comparison with
healthy cells. The occurrence and cancer progression is driven by DNA alterations (mutations) and may occur
due to changes in gene expression regarding oncogenes, tumor suppressor and the gene’s reformation ability to
rectify resultant mutations in oncogenes [5–8]. Similarly, the inﬂuenza pandemics of high pathogenic values have
claimed several lives that could be treated using functionalized, highly bio-compatible AuNPs [9]. It is expected that
the number of cancer deaths may reach 12 million in 2030, if the incidence remains unchecked. Governments,
all over the world are spending several billions of dollars each year for cancer treatment and cancer incidence
reduction [10,11].
Regarding the economic burden, losses of human life in addition to suffering from disease symptoms and side
effects of chemotherapeutics have led to a concerted effort to ﬁght against these dangerous diseases [2]. Treatment
regimens against cancer such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery are currently being sought, but the disease
cure rate does not reach the target due to adverse physical and psychological side effects [12,13]. Surgical removal
of tumors cannot eliminate the total volume of the tumor in some cases. Several cases may be treated using
combination therapy, whether chemotherapy with radiotherapy or surgery. Chemotherapeutics, on the other hand,
function by signaling or blocking cellular pathways of rapidly dividing cells. A similar approach to counter rapid
cell divisions of cancerous cells is being followed by radiotherapy. These phenomena against cancerous cells may
become detrimental for other nontarget, healthy and actively dividing cells of the body [14,15]. A clinical example
of this phenomenon is doxorubicin (DOX), which is a popular chemotherapeutic option for cancer patients that
induces apoptosis (programmed cell death of cancer cells), it induces not only apoptosis of the cancer cells but
also healthy cells [16,17]. Although signiﬁcant advances have been made in early detection, preventive actions and
translational medical diagnostic research, an enormous effort is essential to progress and secure drugs [18].
Au is novel compared with other materials, due to its resistance to transmitting, while considerable ongoing
research is being unveiled for potential anticancer, antimicrobial and biodiagnostic utilizations. In contrary to the
majority of micro- and nano-particles, AuNPs possess tremendously remarkable properties earmarked for having a
sufﬁcient surface-to-volume ratio, physical and chemical properties which may be tuned depending upon structural
shape and composition, qualitative and quantitative target-binding acres, and high robustness elaboration in this
critical review analysis.
As of now, the signiﬁcant role of AuNPs is increasing day-by-day due to its eminent cancer therapeutic capabilities
as well as drug delivery. One particularly intriguing span of research comprises due to their provisional chemical

stability that produces a less hazardous, smooth and genuine, cost-effective synthesis route and has a perfect
biocompatibility and noninterference with other antibodies or biomarkers. Nowadays, the Au plays as an essential
character for curing various diseases. Progress in gold nanoscience has enabled scientists to generate multifunctional
nanostructures that may be conjugated to several kinds of biomolecules, antibodies and hormones that can
reach targeted cells/receptors efﬁciently. This comprehensive review has opened gateways to smart technologies
that mainly highlight the approaches and developments in treatment, diagnosis and prevention of respiratory
diseases within the last 10 years, by utilizing AuNPs emerging techniques.
What makes AuNPs stand out in diagnosing diseases?
Cancer nanotechnology has led to the development and strengthening of useful therapeutic regimens, modiﬁed
drug delivery systems, in addition to novel methods for diagnosing, imaging and treating cancer [19–22], in order to
minimize toxic effects on healthy tissues during treatment. Tumor targeting of NPs involves attaching molecules,
such as ligands to the surface of NPs, which will recognize and attach with speciﬁc receptors onto the tumor
cell surface [23,24]. Many organic and inorganic nanomaterials and nanocomposites have been engineered against
cancer, with gold and silver NPs being the most widely applied. AuNPs are a robust nanomaterial with a broad
application range [25,26]. The feasibility of tailoring explicit biophysical, biochemical and biomedical assets via
structural morphology analysis as well as surface treatment distinguishes AuNPs among the most innovative and
investigated techniques in nanotechnology, as depicted in Figure 1 [27,28].
Due to mass, size, surface and optical properties, AuNPs could be rapidly functionalized to many bio-medical
applications. Because of the broad surface to volume ratio, AuNPs have a high adsorption ability and are relatively
nontoxic and amenable to surface functionalization with speciﬁc organic moieties. Also, their surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) makes AuNPs among the most widely used nanomaterials in many ﬁelds of NP research, as seen
in Figure 1 [29,30].
Due to composite material processing approaches, scientists have developed a structural controlling composition,
crystallinity and geometrical control over the structures of AuNPs so that they can tailor them for speciﬁc biomedical
applications, which have a profound impact on their features, inﬂuencing stability, mobility and compatibility. The
most commonly utilized shapes of AuNPs include those of a sphere, star, cuboidal, round, rod, cone, cluster, shell
and matrix, which are arranged in a linear or branched manner as shown in Figure 2 [31–33].
Nanotechnologies have far-reaching potential applications with several usages to overcome cancer such as imaging,
diagnosis and targeted therapy [34–36]. Nanotechnology progress will support genetic diagnosis and treatment,
depending on each genetic proﬁle and its genetic code sequences and functions [37]. AuNPs were investigated in
different areas including in vitro and in vivo studies as a tissue culture, bio-imaging, cancer treatment and as a
drug carrier [38–40]. Brief methodologies for the synthesis and characterization of AuNPs have been summarized in

In vivo imaging for translational medical research
AuNPs are a perfect label due to their gluttonous capability of visible light interaction [41,42]. Once exposed to light,
free electron excitation occurs to a state of collective oscillation known as ’SPR’ [41]. AuNPs are used as a label where
they migrate to the needed site in vivo and help in ultrasound or x-ray visualization for targeting cancerous cells [41].
The versatile optical properties of AuNPs support the cell imaging of cells with a contrast mechanism [43,44]. Also,
the higher extinction coefﬁcient and excellent inherent photostability of AuNPs makes them an excellent candidate
for biosensing applications [45]. Different kinds of NPs included nanoclusters, nanoshells, nanorods, dendrimers,
biological polymers, nanoscaffolds and carbon nanomaterials [46,47].
Biomolecules (i.e., peptides, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) can be brought together with AuNPs to form
nanomaterials with speciﬁc characters that support its usage in imaging, photo-thermal therapy and as a drug
carrier [48,49]. Hou et al. [50], reported in 2017 the gadolinium ion mediated self-assembly of Au-nanoclusters
for multi-modality cancer diagnosis including MRI, CT and near-infrared ﬂuorescence imaging. This kind of
approach and design of nanomaterials is a gateway to simultaneous multimodal imaging for a clinical patient.
Teymorian et al. [51], recorded that trypsin-stabilized Au-nanoclusters had near-infrared radiation properties for the
bio-sensing of heparin transmitted on the surfacing of plasmon-enhanced transmission of energy as well as folic
acid (FA)-modiﬁed gold nano construct (AuNCs) for in vivo cancer imaging and diagnosis.
The advantage of AuNPs in the detection of signiﬁcant viruses that cause respiratory disease, for instance Middle-
East Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus (MERS CoV) has been reported [52]. These colorimetric approaches toward
the detection of viruses eliminate the chances of salt-aggregation and improve the overall speciﬁcity of diagnostic

assays. Such assays have also been optimized to detect one of the most crucial genes linked with a highly pathogenic
protein, termed the Spike (S) gene.
Only certain self-illuminating materials focused primarily on toxic quantum targets such as, CdSe and CdTe
have been generated concerning new areas of molecular imaging applications. Herein, Hu et al. [53] reported a
new novel design for nontoxic self-ﬂuorescence Au nanoclusters (64Cu doped Au NCs), which showed enhanced
properties in comparison with the naked AuNPs based on Cerenkov’s resonance energy transfer (CRET) for dual-
modality positron emission tomography and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). 64Cu-doped AuNCs exhibited
efﬁcient CRET-NIR and positron emission tomography imaging, both in vitro and in vivo. This imaging contrast
agent can be used for biomedical applications, particularly molecular imaging, with it being relatively nontoxic and
robustly biocompatible. AuNPs hold great potential as selective imaging tools in medicine, when compared with
the traditional contrast agents.
Drug resistance is a signiﬁcant problem that should be overcome to achieve excellent results in cancer treatment
with chemotherapy. Au–DOX nanoconjugates were developed to reduce multiple drug resistance (MDR). The
AuNPs were initially pegylated as Au PEG-NH2, and then a cleavable disulphide (Au–PEG–SS–DOX) was applied
to the AuNPs. The Au–PEG–SS–DOX nanoconjugate design was very efﬁcient in cytotoxicity experiments, where
helped release the DOX intracellularly and increased its cytotoxicity in cancer cells, which had MDR. The study
highlighted by Gu et al. [54], represented the potential of using AuNPs to reduce MDR in cancer treatment with
approved chemotherapy. Wang used previous techniques of imaging to detect Au nanoshells in the brain blood
vessels of a rat, through near-infrared absorption in the blood–brain barrier [55].
Au nanoshells increase the imaging contrast to 81% in an increased depth with precise details [56]. There are
different types of applications for this technique of imaging, for example, in biomedical imaging either in diagnosis
or in therapy follow-up, in addition to its usage in plasmonics and sensing and catalysis imaging [57]. On the other

hand, there are some limitations for in vivo imaging related to the external-light-mediated plasmonic properties of
AuNPs, because it requires a high sensitivity for an external light wavelength to reduce a fully absorbed or scattered
off visible light by skin layers and bone [58].
Deploying the exceptional properties of AuNPs, scientists have developed a rapid testing kit for COVID-19.
The kit has been developed to detect the virus within 10 min for a naked-eye visual result [45]. This research
is a signiﬁcant breakthrough, which has a deep-rooted history of utilizing AuNPs for visual detection of target
genes/antigens/proteins/sequences [59,60].
Photothermal therapy applications
Localized AuNPs SPR property makes NPs an excellent candidate for photothermal therapy applications [61]. The
signiﬁcant side effect of traditional cancer therapies, such as radiation treatment, causes the destruction of healthy
cells nearby to the tumor cells [41]. Nano photo-thermolysis using pulsed lasers and bio-conjugated AuNPs has
demonstrated potential applications in selective destruction of cancer cells [62]. During exposure to pulsed lasers
with low intensity, NPs become irradiated and their temperature rise leads to the damage of tumor cells alone,
without causing any harmful effects to healthy cells [63].
In 2015, the ultra-small AuNCs were conjugated with the surface ligand glutathione (GSH) to synthesize and
metabolizable biocompatible radio-sensitizers (GSH–AuNCs). The GSH–AuNCs was accumulated in the tumor
area due to its good permeability and retention effect, increasing the efﬁciency of a radiotherapy session [64].
This productivity was recognized because of the disruption to DNA as the Au 25 nanoclusters had a photo-electric
inﬂuence. Also, the compton dispersion had a signiﬁcant reduction in the volume and weight of the U14 tumor [65].
GSH–AuNCs were excreted by the kidney, which is a critical point to reduce the accumulation of AuNPs in body
tissues [64].
Increasing the afﬁnity between AuNPs and receptors on pathogen/cancer cell membranes will help in efﬁcient
targeting, optimum retention and it will increase the synergistic advantages in cancer treatment as well as molecular
imaging. In lung carcinomas, ligands on cell membranes are over expressed, increasing the afﬁnity between gastrin-
releasing peptide (GRP) receptors and bombesin (BBN) peptides. Chanda et al. synthesized a library of GRP
receptors [66] and AuNPs nano platforms with a high bio-compatibility of BBN peptides. For example, by using
AuNP–BBN and its radiolabeled surrogate (198AuNP–BBN) in vivo, there was a high afﬁnity with GRP-receptors
in pancreatic aicni of normal mice and tumor tissue of prostate tumor-bearing immune-deﬁcient mice.
AuNP–BBN conjugates were administered intraperitoneally and it was uptaken at the tumor area as well as
simultaneously decreasing in the reticuloendothelial system. The GRP-receptor-speciﬁc AuNP–BBN peptides
increase the contrast of x-ray computed tomography imaging technique several folds, compared with a nontreated
group [66]. The properties of NPs allow targeted drug delivery to the speciﬁc cells as well as the organelle. The
molecule-speciﬁc binding and imaging by AuNPs were shown by targeting viral nucleotides [59]. This study reported
the usage of unmodiﬁed AuNPs for easier and more practical, label-free detection.
Gene therapy is a technique used to insert a speciﬁc gene sequence into cells to regulate a speciﬁc defection in
a speciﬁc gene. Reports suggest that it can be achieved by using nanomaterials such as Au and Ni nanorods [67].
Trials for the delivery of DNA and peptides using carbon nanotubes combined with polymeric chitosan molecules
have shown promising outcomes in treating cancers. NP complexes with peptides were explored to achieve nuclear
targeting in HepG2 in vitro models [68].
Advanced shapes of AuNPs have been synthesized by polymer nanocrystals, which were coated and loaded with
speciﬁc active ingredients to give an excellent integration with various functionalities [60,69]. The colourimetric
diagnosis of various viral and oncogenic pathogens mediated by exceptional physicochemical properties of AuNPs
is worth mentioning. For example, regarding these functions, increasing the contrast of molecular imaging, helps
to target the delivery of a speciﬁc drug or gene sequence and aids in the treatment through thermal therapy.
The hope and aim is to be able to synthesize a nanostructure complex which can help to follow-up a patient and
their prognosis, through implanting this complex into the body without any side effect, while protecting healthy
cells [70]. One of the very important, updated and new usages of AuNPs is utilizing it as a drug carrier to deliver
molecules to target cells, described as ‘promising nanocarriers for therapeutics’ due to its function, biocompatibility,
safety and blood clearance in addition to its easy synthesis [41].
A PEG-coated with a monolayer of AuNP and loaded with TNF-α (NPs delivery system) was synthesized and
its efﬁcacy has been proved through increasing tumor damage and decreasing the TNF-α toxicity in healthy cells.

Gold nanoparticles against respiratory diseases: oncogenic & viral pathogens review
Review
There are many trials for using nanocomposites of TNF-α and Au nanoshells as a hydrogel and are being tested for
their drug-delivery usage [71,72].
Key challenges & opportunities of AuNPs
Recently, many subjects highlighted the enormous activity that nanotechnologies present in biomedicine for the
examination and treatment of various human respiratory infections [73]. The summary of applications against
respiratory disorders, using AuNPs has been given in Figure 4.
There’s no two opinions in the dynamic yet ﬂexible properties of AuNPs. The ability of facile functionalization
for downstream applications of therapeutics and diagnosis, vaccination and immunotherapy have been depicted.
The binding to receptors and nucleic acids (DNA, RNA) ability to initiate immunogenetic, precise and tailor-made
therapeutic machinery, makes AuNPs stand out from the crowd, compared with other potential therapeutics [45].
The steps for sensing and imaging applications of AuNPs have been illustrated. Step 1 comprises of the precise
attachment (sandwiching) of antibodies with the target antigen. Step 2 shows the labeling with ﬂuorescent (Raman)
dyes leading to conjugate formation. Step 3 features the hybridization of the nanoconjugate with that of a DNA
probe. Step 4 shows the formation of a electrode speciﬁc modiﬁed nanomaterial, followed by the addition of a
hydrolytic enzyme, leading to the change in physicochemical properties of the target antigen for better imaging
and diagnosis.
Moreover, the sensing applications of AuNPs in laboratory models have shown efﬁcient labeling, illumination
and diagnosis of diseases at preclinical stages. The prognostic value of AuNPs against human respiratory diseases
has been established in lung cancers and viral pathogens (especially the corona virus family) of high importance [52].
Additionally, the precise targeting and toxicity in cancerous cells by speciﬁc ligand binding of AuNPs to cancerous
cells is only of high value in biological models.
Notably, an excess of medically relevant results, including nanomaterials, is currently on being commercialized for
human use. Regenerative and precision medicine, are approaches that have been applied for biomarker discovery such
as nanobiosensors [74]. Models of nanopharmaceuticals for the precise distribution and assimilation of therapeutic
materials however, need further optimization.
Unusual signs of progress have also been done in the area of Au nano-oncology by superseding the ability of
conventional chemotherapy medicines [75]. These applications target the tumor position with various functional
units, including AuNP captured peptides, enzymes, immunoglobulins and cytotoxic factors. In these circumstances,
several investigations revealed that AuNPs could be used to achieve therapeutic units to modulate biological
pathways such as oxidative stress, autophagy, metabolism and exercising anticancer action [76–79]. The capability of
downregulation and upregulation of metabolic pathways in the host cell is of high value in the treatment of viral
diseases of a respiratory origin.
Nano-informatics also promotes chemotherapy by developing the Au-nanostructures for the modelling of cancer
cells and supports the discovery of drug-resistant growth regularly. Hyperthermia-based targeted drug control and
gene treatment programs are the most advanced nano-informatics methods shown to treat cancer with the most
invisible side effects [80,81]. Furthermore, exclusive investigations of AuNPs on antitumor therapy by drug delivery
utilization is illustrated in Table 1.
The performance improvement & biocompatibility of AuNPs in vivo
Still, the purpose of computational methods to nanomedicine is undeveloped and is an important area of study.
The demand for computational uses at the nanoscale dimension has provided an increase in the area of nano-
informatics. Powerful machine-learning algorithms and sinister analytics can considerably promote the idea of more
effective nanocarriers. Such algorithms produce auspicious information on future data and have been primarily
used for divining cellular uptake and movement. Data mining, network study, quantitative structure-property
correlation, quantitative structure–activity relation, consumption, delivery, metabolism, elimination and toxicity
are characteristic evaluations carried out in Au-nano informatics.
Nanotechnology owns the potential to afford a standard turn in demonstrative and therapeutic medications that
are given to complete target speciﬁcity and improve recognition for signiﬁcant development in the overall therapy of
the prostate and different inoperable cancers [96,97]. Au-NPs occupy excellent abilities to identify, image or manage
tumors at the molecular and cellular levels [98,99]. Between several metallic NPs, AuNPs possess exceptional tumor
recognition abilities because of their inherent connection to broken tumor vasculature, which is displayed in the
angiogenesis of cancer extension [100].

Lately, Balogh and his colleagues also made groundbreaking innovations for the synthesis of radioactive polyethy-
lene (198Auo) radioactive dendrimer, composed of Au in sizes between 10 and 29 nm [101]. Their investigations have
revealed that only an intratumoral dose of poly (198Auo) d = 22 nm, allow nanocomposite devices in phosphate-
buffered saline to provide a dose of 74 μCi over the next 8 days, which ended in a statistically executable 45%
decrease (p = 0.0245) in the growth volume, when associated with nontreated groups [101].
Biocompatible 198AuNPs will provide a distinct generation of therapeutic factors possessing the activity to reduce
severe clinical difﬁculties connected with existing heterogeneous brachytherapy factors for the therapy of different
kinds of human tumors. Speciﬁc studies in vitro and in vivo have been performed to support the usage of AuNP
coated gum-arabic glycoprotein (GA). The study conducted by Chanda et al. [97] conﬁrmed that the combined
polysaccharides and proteins within the GA backbone can irreversibly, yet efﬁciently bind AuNPs to give rise
to nontoxic AuNPs that are permanent following in vitro and in vivo situations for possible uses in therapeutic
applications [102].
Chanda et al. [97] noted that for mice with a ﬂank model of human prostate cancer a healing ability and
pharmacokinetic considerations resulted from a ﬁve bis106 PC-3 cell subcutaneous implant. For therapeutic
testing, single stable swelling was permitted to continue for 3 weeks.
The animal authority control agency should be authorized due to zenith weight decline observed on days 16 and

declining overall ﬁtness situation and the chance of lump maturation. In contract, none of the seven animals in
the therapeutics conjugation ended and ancient completion was established. They did show a temporary weight
decline that topped at -17.5 ± 2.5% on day 17 but increased to -10.8 ± 2.8% by day 31 [97]. Casual or no radio
therapy in the liver, intestine and other nontarget organs were emphatically assured that the invigorating payload
was alive in a period where the cancer lump location meanwhile had 30 days therapy control.
Nano-informatics has presented a signiﬁcant additional program for AuNPs study and interpretation to defeat
such in vitro barriers. The mutlidisciplinary approach toward existing major pandemics is therefore required [103].
Nano-informatics mainly bargain with the assembling, distribution, visualizing, modeling and evaluation of relevant
nanoscale level data and knowledge. It is the perfect time to materialize the potential of AuNPs in developing and

optimizing rapid, ultra-sensitive and user-friendly approaches for imaging the emerging corona viruses. Most
recently, a lipid NP-based vaccine has made its way to the fastest clinical trials for vaccine against COVID-19 [69].
As a matter of fact, this success is a huge milestone for nano-based vaccines, encouraging the use of highly
biocompatible nanomaterials, including AuNPs against global health emergencies.
Conclusion
It would be highly beneﬁcial from new and promising AuNP-based diagnostics to be attributable to longer
circulation times and localized accumulation at the disease site for efﬁcient diagnostics within ﬂexible detection
limits. Indeed, it can be utilized to implement a wide diversity of therapeutics, such as: photothermal ablation,
radiotherapy, drug delivery and nucleic acid delivery based on the AuNPs platform. The brief review discusses all the
research done to aid diagnosis and treat respiratory diseases of humans by deploying AuNPs. Some recommendations
that can drive the future outlook of research such as clinical trials may be vigorously conducted on susceptible
populations to derive useful data including, the up-scaling of commercialization of AuNPs needs for laboratory-scale
production, concerns associated with the use of NPs toward other organs of the human body need to be well-
addressed and ecotoxic proﬁles of AuNPs may be established and well communicated to clinicians for mitigating
the associated hazards.
Medical nanomaterials were developed rapidly in the current decade as one of the main essential applications
in the nanotechnology ﬁeld. Metal NPs are being used as biosensors and biolabels for cellular studies. Fluorescent
NPs attached to biological ligands that bind with speciﬁc cellular receptors enable improved cellular imaging
studies. AuNPs alone or in a combination have been used and applied in the therapy of high priority diseases
of the respiratory system. The applications include early diagnosis, cellular imaging and photothermal therapy
for different kinds of NPs such as nanoclusters, nanoshells and nanorods that gained considerable importance.
Biomolecules such as amino acids, gene sequence, proteins and fats could be optimally functionalized on AuNPs to
produce nanomaterials. These biologically conjugated nanomaterials possess more stable and improved properties
for diversiﬁed applications as drug cargo and in bio-imaging, photothermal therapy and vaccination strategies.
Localized SPR property of AuNPs enables an excellent applicant for photothermal therapy applications. The
properties of NPs allow for targeted drug delivery to the speciﬁc cells as well as organelles. The potential of AuNPs
during laboratory trials is a way forward to develop innovative solutions to combat various infectious diseases
in humans. The tuning capabilities of their physical properties (size, shape and surface chemistry) along with a
high biocompatibility and improved pathogen or concogenic toxicity, borne out by AuNPs, based diagnostics and
product formulations in clinical trials as therapeutics that could be exploited in current and future outbreaks of
respiratory diseases.
Future perspective
AuNPs have dynamic properties and a huge potential of diversiﬁed applications against cancer and other infectious
diseases. Surface modiﬁcation of AuNPs allows designing such materials with inherent properties to guide it toward
its target. Current trends of future scopes are immuno-diagnostics, point of care therapy, translational medicine
and nano imaging.
Furthermore, with the cytotoxicity of AuNPs being almost negligible, this makes them ideal as a template for
drug delivery and molecular imaging in particular for computed tomography agents. AuNPs hold great potential in
dual-modality imaging and thermal treatment with their ability to be directed toward targeted cells, and upon the
exposure to a radiation source, they will absorb heat and cause cellular damage and disruption to the targeted cells.
The approval of AuNP based diagnostic approaches for COVID-19 testing is a huge gateway for the bright future
of these materials at clinical settings. Similarly, nano-assembly vaccines have the potential to reshape the future of
adjuvants and provide new generation vaccines.
