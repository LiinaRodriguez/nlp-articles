Understanding the dynamics of technology convergence is indispensable for both academic and 
industrial perspectives. Traditional analyses have mainly focused on the link formation process, 
overlooking the role that persistence process plays in shaping technology networks. This paper 
endeavors to fill this gap by incorporating the persistence process into the analysis of technology 
convergence using the Separate Temporal Exponential Random Graph Model (STERGM). Utilizing a 
decade-long dataset of breast cancer drug patents, we provide a comprehensive view of tech­
nology convergence mechanisms and their predictive capabilities. Our findings reveal significant 
differences in network effects between formation and persistence processes, indicating that 
focusing on only one may misrepresent the evolution of technology networks. The combined 
model achieves an F1 score of 69.54% in empirical forecasting, confirming its practical utility. 
Additionally, we introduce Intensification Networks to examine how existing ties strengthen or 
weaken over time, uncovering the critical role of intensification in the long-term evolution of 
technology convergence. By capturing both the formation of new ties and the intensification of 
existing ones, our model offers a more nuanced and forward-looking understanding of conver­
gence dynamics, particularly in identifying potential areas for future technology convergence.
1. Introduction
Technology convergence integrates key technologies from various fields to address complex issues, acting as a major driver for 
future industrial and technological growth. This topic has attracted academics in technology management, policy-making, and 
competitive intelligence. As a catalyst for innovation, convergence fosters emerging and disruptive technologies. In innovation 
management, understanding convergence guides technology development and informs research investment. For science and tech­
nology policymakers, early detection allows adaptation of policy tools to match the current pace of industrial and technology 
development (Karvonen et al., 2010). Grasping the mechanisms underlying convergence is vital for its reliable prediction.
Previous research has examined methods for the early identification and prediction of converging technologies. A common 
approach constructs an indicator system to characterize these multidimensional technologies from a measurement perspective. In this 
context, scholars have developed a range of patent-based indicators, often using IPC (International Patent Classification) systems to 
assess the degree of convergence (No & Park, 2010). Some studies have further extended their methodologies to incorporate IPC-level

networks and specialized concepts such as entropy and gravity as additional metrics for identifying technological convergence (Han & 
Sohn, 2016). Moreover, recent advancements in this field have introduced two types of indexes—fluctuation and continuity—to 
provide a more nuanced analysis of the dynamic patterns of technological convergence (Yun & Geum, 2019).
Network analysis is increasingly recognized as a pivotal approach to understanding technology convergence, notably through the 
adoption of the ’technology network’ concept (Kogler, Rigby, & Tucker, 2013; Broekel, Balland, Burger, & Van Oort, 2014; Juh´asz, 
Broekel, & Boschma, 2020). These networks typically use patent classification codes as nodes and their co-occurrences as edges. These 
codes represent different technologies and the trends of co-occurrence relationships reflect their convergence. Link prediction, a 
common method in this context, helps forecast new connections within technology networks, potentially identifying future paths for 
technological convergence (Kim & Sohn, 2020; Oh et al., 2020). However, link prediction does not fully capture the complexity of 
technology convergence, especially in multi-technology contexts and evolving node dynamics (Kim & Lee, 2017; Lee et al., 2021; 
Wang & Hsu, 2023). While existing studies have acknowledged these gaps and proposed solutions, link dynamics remains an 
under-explored area.
Link dynamics, also known as tie dynamics, represent the temporal changes in network connections—specifically formation, 
persistence, and dissolution (Dahlander & McFarland, 2013; Krivitsky & Handcock, 2014). Formation refers to the initial establish­
ment of a link between two technologies, marking the beginning of convergence (Youn et al., 2015; Broekel & Bednarz, 2018). 
Persistence denotes the ongoing interaction between technologies over time, reflecting sustained convergence and the stability of their 
relationship (Cantner & Graf, 2006; Copeland et al., 2023). Dissolution signifies the reduction or cessation of these connections due to 
factors such as market shifts, technological advancements, or strategic decisions (Koka et al., 2006; Ter Wal, 2014). While these 
concepts are well-established in network dynamics literature, they have been less explored in the context of technology convergence. 
Moreover, the intensification of relationships between technologies—that is, the strengthening of existing ties—is crucial for under­
standing technology evolution (Juh´asz et al., 2020).
Incorporating all facets of link dynamics offers a more nuanced understanding of technological evolution. This approach em­
phasizes long-term stability by considering link emergence, maturation, and decline. Relying exclusively on link formation overlooks 
key dynamics affecting the technology lifecycle. Powell et al. (2005) and Yan et al. (2016) highlight the need to explore the temporal 
evolution of technological alliances.
To deepen our understanding of technology convergence, we integrate persistence into the analysis using Separable Temporal 
Exponential Random Graph Models (STERGM) (Krivitsky & Goodreau, 2019). This allows us to assess whether the mechanisms of 
persistence mirror those of formation or differ significantly. As Krivitsky and Handcock (2014, p. 36) noted, “processes for forming and 
dissolving ties differ,” suggesting that the dynamics of formation, persistence, and dissolution each require unique consideration in the 
broader context of technological evolution. This study aims to explore these dynamics and their implications for predicting technology 
convergence.
RQ1: What factors influence the dynamics of technology convergence in both formation and persistence? Are the mechanisms for 
formation and persistence the same or different?
This question seeks to identify the variables influencing both the formation and persistence of technology ties. It assesses whether 
the factors driving the formation of new ties differ from those sustaining existing ties. Understanding these mechanisms offers a more 
comprehensive view of technology convergence.
RQ2: Does integrating persistence mechanisms enhance the predictive power for technology convergence?
This question assesses whether models incorporating both formation and persistence processes have greater predictive power than 
those considering only formation. By incorporating persistence mechanisms, this research seeks to improve the accuracy and reliability 
of predicting technology convergence.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the second section reviews pertinent studies; the third section outlines the 
research framework, methodologies, effect hypothesis selection, network terms, and model assessment; the fourth section presents an 
empirical analysis, which includes network data preprocessing, descriptive statistics, network and model construction, goodness-of-fit 
evaluation, and interpretation; and the final section offers conclusions and discusses the limitations of this study.
2. Literature review
2.1. Technology convergence
Several related concepts of technology convergence have been used in literature, and sometimes interchangeably. Technology 
convergence generally refers to the gradual merging of distinct technological domains to create new systems and innovations (Curran 
et al., 2010), often reshaping industries and creating new markets (Br¨oring et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2015). In contrast, technology fusion 
involves integrating technological elements within an existing domain rather than creating a new one (Curran & Leker, 2011). Another 
related concept is technological recombination, which entails combining existing technologies or knowledge components in novel 
ways to create innovations (Weitzman, 1998; Fleming, 2001). Computational models have been used to study these related concepts 
(Xiao et al., 2022, Cao et al., 2023), although this study focuses on technology convergence.
Technology convergence research has evolved into three main areas:
Exploration of technology convergence drivers: Early research focused on internal mechanisms and external drivers of tech­
nology convergence. Internally, it’s viewed as a recombination and search process based on prior technological coupling, leading to the 
“technology recombination theory” (Fleming, 2001). Externally, factors like technology itself, market demands, and regulation in­
fluence convergence, giving rise to theories like the “co-evolution theory” and “convergence chain theory” (Hacklin et al., 2009). 
G. Yang et al.

However, much of this work remained theoretical or case-based due to the infancy of quantitative analysis tools (Youtie & Shapira, 
2008; Jeong et al., 2012).
Advancements in technology convergence pattern recognition: With more sophisticated quantitative tools, researchers began 
examining and measuring technology convergence patterns. Methods such as association rules (Lee et al., 2015), information entropy 
(Cho & Kim, 2014), intensity map analysis (Geum et al., 2012), and evolution patterns (Choi et al., 2015) were introduced. Despite 
various methods, a unified framework was lacking, and progress in robust recognition models was limited. Research often focused on 
growth trends over time without fully exploring underlying dynamics and mechanisms (Sick & Br¨oring, 2022).
Emergence of technology convergence prediction models: More recently, with the rise of big data and artificial intelligence, 
researchers have turned to using these tools to enhance the predictive capabilities of technology convergence in dynamic competitive 
environments (Ibrahim, Elamer, & Ezat, 2021). Prediction models, especially those based on machine learning techniques like link 
prediction (San Kim & Sohn, 2020; Choi, Afifuddin, & Seo, 2022), have been employed to anticipate trends in technology convergence. 
However, it is important to note that link prediction and technology convergence prediction are not completely synonymous. Link 
prediction typically forecasts the linkage between two technology elements, while technology convergence often involves the 
recombination and linkage of multiple elements (Kim & Lee, 2017; Lee et al., 2021; Wang & Hsu, 2023). Additionally, node dynamics 
play a crucial role, as the structure of the network evolves over time, affecting the potential for technology convergence (Oh, et al., 
2020; Yang, et al., 2024). Beyond the binary relationships, the intensification of relationships between technology elements also 
warrants attention, as highlighted by Juh´asz et al. (2020). Thus, while link prediction is a useful tool, further refinement is needed to 
fully capture the complexity of technology convergence in dynamic environments.
2.2. Formation and persistence processes
Scholars studying technology convergence have increasingly recognized the intricate interdependencies inherent in the formation 
of convergent technologies. Rather than developing in isolation, technologies are understood to interact and occasionally merge with 
other technologies, thus sparking innovation (Fleming & Sorenson, 2001). Consequently, several studies have proposed that the extent 
of technology convergence can be measured by examining the number of technological classes cited outside a patent’s core techno­
logical area (Verhoeven, Bakker, & Veugelers, 2016). This process is frequently depicted as a dynamic interaction between diverse 
technological components, giving rise to innovative technological configurations (Tang, et al., 2020). Concurrently, the concept of 
convergence chain is understood as the blurring of boundaries between previously distinct areas of science, technology, markets, or 
industries (Hacklin et al., 2009).
In the context of network dynamics, formation and persistence should be understood as two distinct processes, driven by different 
underlying mechanisms. Formation of technological links often results from short-term needs, such as rapid innovation, regulatory 
shifts, or competitive pressure. On the other hand, persistence refers to the long-term viability and sustained relevance of these links, 
often linked to a technology’s market dominance or technological maturity. Persistence differentiates truly converging technologies 
from those in temporary flux. This distinction is crucial because convergence is not merely about the initial formation of links but about 
their ability to endure and contribute to long-term technological advancements (Statnet Development Team, 2021).
Tie persistence and dissolution serve as mutually exclusive yet complementary aspects, broadening our view beyond just tie for­
mation. Formation alone does not confirm convergence; persistence is essential to verify that these technological interactions result in 
meaningful and sustained innovation. Persistence differentiates stable technologies from those in flux. Without sustained interaction, 
links are unlikely to drive true convergence or have lasting impacts on innovation. Industry models like Gartner’s S-curve and the Hype 
curve also emphasize these dynamics, suggesting that technologies experience phases of hype, decline, and eventual stabilization 
(Fenn & Raskino, 2008).
2.3. ERGM for analyzing technology networks
Technology convergence networks capture the dynamic nature of technology convergence, highlighting complex interactions 
among technologies. Network modeling clarifies this by revealing new connections, dissolving old ones, and tracking network evo­
lution over time. Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) offers a way to understand complex system dependencies via simulation 
(Handcock et al., 2008). Unlike traditional methods, ERGM can handle mixed variables in complex networks and provides 
network-wide insights into technology convergence. The parameters derived from these models can also be predictive. In recent years, 
ERGM has received attention from the fields of scientometric and intelligence analysis (Peng, 2015; An & Ding, 2018; Zhang, et al., 
2018).
In contrast, the STERGM is specifically designed to analyze dynamic changes within networks. It separates the network evolution 
into two distinct processes: the formation of new ties and the dissolution of existing ones. This bifurcation allows STERGM to 
dynamically model network changes over time, offering a more nuanced understanding of how relationships in technology networks 
form and dissolve (Carnegie et al., 2015). Empirical evidence, including comparisons by Fritz, Lebacher, & Kauermann (2020), 
suggests that STERGMs perform better than other models in contexts similar to ours, reinforcing our methodological choice. STERGM 
has been applied across various fields like international politics, social media, natural resource governance, business operations, and 
pedagogy, yielding insights beneficial to those areas (Dokuka & Valeeva, 2015; Angst & Hirschi, 2017; Lebacher, Thurner, & 
Kauermann, 2021; Xu, 2021). However, to our knowledge, there has been no study of the tie formation and dissolution mechanism in 
technology networks using the STERGM. This study aims to fill this gap.

3. Research design
3.1. Framework
In this study, we aim to elucidate the dynamic mechanisms underlying technology convergence, with a focus on predictive 
modeling. Our approach is structured into three main components, as illustrated in Fig. 1.
The first step involves data collection and preparation. We gather IPC pairs at the 4-digit level from a specific technological field 
and segment them based on their temporal occurrence to form distinct networks. Descriptive statistics are then calculated to reveal key 
patterns, ensuring the data is well-prepared for model building.
In the second step, we use STERGMs to construct models in two phases. We begin by selecting key mechanisms such as preferential 
attachment, triadic closure, network baseline effects, node attributes, and homophily. First, we model tie formation, followed by an 
extended model incorporating persistence. Sequentially, we compare models to assess how each mechanism influences formation and 
persistence. We then conduct a comparative analysis to observe parameter evolution between the two processes. At each stage, 
Goodness of Fit (GOF) and model evaluations ensure robustness.
The final step extends the model into predictive scenarios. We test its ability for premature prediction, forecasting future network 
dynamics. Additionally, we expand the STERGMs to focus on intensification networks, shifting from new tie formation to strength­
ening existing ties, demonstrating the model’s ability to handle more complex scenarios over time.
3.2. STERGMs
ERGM models the probability distribution of a network Y based on specified network statistics g(y) and associated parameters θ 
(Robins et al., 2007): 
Pr(Y = y) = exp(θ ⋅g(y))
Z(θ)
(1) 
where Z(θ) is the normalizing constant ensuring a proper probability distribution.
STERGM extends this framework by modeling the network’s evolution between discrete time points t and t + 1 as two separate 
processes: tie formation and tie dissolution. This separability allows us to independently examine factors influencing the creation of 
new ties and the persistence or dissolution of existing ties (Krivitsky & Handcock, 2014). The probability of tie formation is modeled as: 
Fig. 1. Research Framework.
G. Yang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Journal of Informetrics 19 (2025) 101632 
4 
Pr(Y+ = y+|Yt = yt; θ+) = exp(θ+ ⋅g+(y+, yt))
Z+(θ+, yt)
(2) 
Similarly, the probability of tie dissolution is: 
Pr(Y−= y−|Yt = yt; θ−) = exp(θ−⋅g−(y−, yt))
Z−(θ−, yt)
(3) 
The network at time t + 1 is then given by: 
Yt+1 = (Yt ∪Y+)\Y−
(4) 
In these equations: Y+ represents the set of new ties formed between t and t + 1. Y−represents the set of ties dissolved during the 
same period. A conceptual framework of tie formation and dissolution in STERGM can be found in Morris et al. (2015). In our context, 
tie formation (Y+) corresponds to the emergence of new technological linkages—indicating areas where technologies are beginning to 
converge. Tie persistence (the complement of tie dissolution Y−) reflects the continuation of existing technological relationships, 
highlighting sustained integration efforts.
Structural zero-completion. STERGM requires networks to have the same set of nodes across all time periods. However, the 
emergence of new nodes over time presents an analytical challenge (Xie et al., 2019). To address this, we use the maximum set of nodes 
over all time periods and augment each network by adding missing nodes for each specific time point. The issue is that these added 
nodes should not form links with existing nodes since they did not exist at that time.
To overcome this, we employ structural zeros to define zero entries in the network matrix, restricting links between nodes that 
logically cannot have links (Tsamardinos & Borboudakis, 2010). This approach allows the inclusion of variable node sets in dynamic 
network analysis while maintaining the network’s integrity by preventing unrealistic links.
3.3. Rationale for using STERGM in technology convergence
STERGM’s distinct advantage is that it captures both these aspects simultaneously, offering a comprehensive lens through which to 
examine the evolution of technology.
Capturing dynamic processes: Traditional models treat networks as static snapshots, failing to account for the evolving nature of 
technological connections. Unlike static ERGMs, STERGM incorporates both the formation and dissolution of links over time, capturing 
how technologies not only converge but also how connections persist or dissolve (Leifeld & Cranmer, 2019). This allows for a more 
realistic representation of technological evolution, considering the dynamic processes driven by market shifts, innovation cycles, and 
regulatory changes.
Differentiating formation and persistence drivers: Technology convergence is driven by distinct factors at different stages. 
STERGM helps differentiate these by isolating the drivers behind link formation and persistence. For instance, link formation may be 
influenced by the total number of connections (EDGES) between IPC code pairs, while persistence can be shaped by preferential 
attachment (GWDSP), where highly connected technologies attract more links (Lusher et al., 2013). Triadic closure (GWESP) en­
hances network clustering as technologies with common partners are more likely to form and sustain connections (Hunter, 2007). node 
attributes (NODECOV, NODEMATCH) also influence stability, as similar technologies tend to form long-lasting synergies.
Modeling complex network structures: STERGM is especially suited for analyzing technology convergence as it models complex 
network structures, incorporating both node attributes (e.g., technology size) and structural dependencies (e.g., homophily and triadic 
closure) (Robins et al., 2007). Unlike traditional models that assume link independence, STERGM allows for interdependencies be­
tween links, capturing the reality that technological collaborations often depend on existing connections within the network 
(Goodreau et al., 2009).
3.4. Model assessment
In statistical modeling, assessing the fit of the model is critically important as it ensures that the model is not only mathematically 
sound but also accurately reflects the characteristics of the observed data. There are several methods to evaluate the fit of statistical 
models. In this study, we will initially employ the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) 
as the standard for evaluating the optimal model during multiple rounds of iterative model validation. Lower AIC and BIC values 
indicate a better fit and are used to compare one model with another to determine the best-fitting model. In statistical network 
modeling, it is often argued that suitable network models should not only provide reasonable predictions for added edges but also be 
able to represent the topologies of the observed network. This approach is based on sampling from the distribution of networks under 
the estimated parameters and then comparing the network properties of these sampled networks with those of the observed networks 
(Handcock et al., 2008). Subsequently, we use Graphical Goodness-of-fit Diagnostics to confirm how well the optimal model 
performs in fitting the actual network. Finally, in the practical prediction phase, we utilize Precision-Recall (PR) metrics to assess the 
model’s performance in prediction.
4. Empirical analysis
Our analysis focuses on breast cancer treatment patents to highlight the sector’s role in technology convergence. This domain

merges diverse fields—biotechnology, pharmacology, medical devices, and IT—to craft more accurate and individualized therapies, 
illustrating the potential of technology convergence. Innovations like the integration of targeted therapy with chemotherapy, gene 
sequencing for customized treatments, and the employment of artificial intelligence in imaging and surgery underscore this conver­
gence. These advancements, as reviewed by Chopra et al. (2023), showcase the amalgamation of imaging, genetics, surgery, and 
computational science, significantly enhancing breast cancer care.
4.1. Data
The patent data of the breast cancer field were obtained from the Derwent Innovations Index which indexes patents from 52 patent- 
issuing authorities from 1963 to the present. We refer to the PubMed database for the search query of MeSH subject terms related to 
“breast cancer” to enhance the search’s comprehensiveness.1 The most recent ten years of patent data related to breast cancer drugs 
from 2011 to 2020 were selected for this study (downloaded on March 20, 2022), and 39784 raw records were acquired. The search 
query is shown in Table 1.
The IPC is a standardized system for organizing and categorizing technological inventions and innovations. It is used by patent 
offices around the world to classify patents and patent applications, and is an important tool for searching and accessing information 
on patented technologies. Despite the development of the Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC), our choice to employ the IPC system 
is motivated by its extensive historical coverage and universal recognition, ensuring a consistent and comprehensive long-term 
analysis of patent trends crucial for our study. A full IPC code contains 12 digits, which can be divided into 5 levels, namely, sec­
tion, class, subclass, main group, and subgroup. Admittedly, IPC codes at the subclass level primarily offer a broad overview of a 
technological field, which may be insufficient for capturing the specific nuances of individual technologies. However, as our research 
focus is technology convergence—namely, the relationships or combinations between different technological areas—the utility of 
subclass-level IPC codes becomes salient. Intersections and combinations among various subclasses can offer an understanding of 
which technological domains are more likely to converge. The use of 4-digit IPC codes (sub-class level) to analyze technology 
convergence is commonly adopted by other researchers (Kim & Sohn, 2020; Feng, et al., 2020).
Furthermore, we also considered using the 1-digit IPC code at the section level as a broad categorization for patents. To specifically 
examine the homophily mechanism, we selected 5 categories according to the breast cancer data to be treated as internal features of 
IPC codes: Class A (Human Necessities), Class B (Operations and Transport), Class C (Chemistry and Metallurgy), Class G (Physics), and 
Class H (Electricity).
4.2. Dynamic networks building
We harvested the data year-by-year and established multiple two-mode networks based on the “patent-IPC code” affiliations. These 
two-mode networks were subsequently projected into one-mode networks, resulting in the creation of multiple IPC code co-occurrence 
networks. Following this, we combined all these networks in chronological order into a network series. The co-occurrence relation­
ships between nodes are manifested as edges, and their frequencies are denoted as weights. We set the weight threshold greater than 
one to mitigate random noise in constructing the networks.
4.3. Characteristics of dynamic networks
Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics of the network series. The table includes metrics such as node size, edge size, clustering 
coefficient, density, and mean degree. Overall, these statistical indicators do not exhibit a consistent upward or downward trend over 
time but remain relatively stable. Given that the network constructed is a dynamic network, a structural zero-completion operation is 
required for all nodes prior to employing STERGM. For the decade spanning 2011–2020, this yielded a full network node size of 155. 
The term “NSIZE” in Table 3 refers to the count of nodes present in each actual time slice.
4.4. Variables selection
One of the key advantages of the ERGMs and variations is their ability to incorporate multiple types of interactions and de­
pendencies between variables. By adding factors to the model in a stepwise fashion, researchers will be able to identify which factors 
have the greatest impact on the formation and persistence of these technologies. Variables used in this article, as well as the mech­
anisms, network configurations, and interpretations they represent in the process of technology formation and persistence, are out­
lined in Table 3.
4.5. Goodness-of-fit diagnostics
Goodness-of-fit tests, using Graphical Goodness-of-fit diagnostics, are presented in Fig. 2 to validate the STERGM’s representation 
of the actual technology convergence network. Metrics like degree, shared partners, and geodesic distance were examined across 5,000

simulated networks, based on Model 10 parameters. The box plot and solid black line in Fig. 2 closely align, indicating a robust model 
fit. Overall, the diagnostics confirm that our STERGM accurately captures the network’s observed topological and attribute features.
4.6. Model results
4.6.1. STERGMs excluding persistence processes
Table 4 presents the results of the STERGMs that do not incorporate persistence processes, based on a consolidated 10-year network 
series. The primary objective is to iteratively construct a variety of STERGMs to investigate the influence of different variables on the 
formation of the technology network. At this juncture, only the tie formation process (’Form’) is taken into account. The Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MCMC-MLE) technique is utilized within the Statnet toolkit for parameter estimation. A 
marked improvement in model fit is indicated by a significant reduction in the AIC, dropping from 13782.292 to 12749.804. In 
addressing the model’s structure, it has been deemed essential to integrate measures of triadic closure into the baseline model to serve 
as a control for the transition from two-mode to one-mode projections. As such, GWESP will be added as a control variable. In fact, the 
inclusion of GWESP accounts for the most significant decrease from the null model’s AIC, but as it serves as a control variable, we focus 
on the impact of adding other variables to the model beyond this control. The most significant enhancement in model performance is 
attributed to incorporating the main effects model, which factors in the square root of eigenvector centrality, yielding a significant 
reduction in the AIC from 13782.292 to 12959.980. In the final analysis, Model 6 shows that most factors are statistically significant for 
the formation of converging technologies. However, variables such as NODEMATCH (A-A), NODEMATCH (G-G), NODECOV 
(NSIZE), and ABSDIFF (NSIZE) do not reach statistical significance, indicating their lesser influence in this context.
Model 1 serves as the baseline, incorporating GWESP as a control for triadic closure. The EDGES term is negative and statistically 
significant, indicating that as the number of edges increases, the likelihood of additional tie formation decreases—a common feature of 
sparse networks, where link formation becomes less likely as the network grows denser.
In Models 2 and 3, node-level attributes NODECOV (Eigenvector Centrality) and ABSDIFF (Eigenvector Centrality) are 
introduced. NODECOV shows a significant positive effect, highlighting those technologies with higher centrality are more likely to 
form new ties. Interestingly, ABSDIFF also has a positive effect, indicating that links can form even between nodes with substantial 
differences in centrality, challenging the expectation that similar centrality drives new connections. Both NODECOV (NSIZE) and 
ABSDIFF (NSIZE) are non-significant, suggesting that node size has little influence on the formation of ties.
Model 4 introduces homophily effects, with significant positive results for NODEMATCH (A-A) and NODEMATCH (B-B), sug­
gesting that technologies within the same IPC sections are more likely to form ties. In Model 5, NODEMATCH (C-C) is significant, 
indicating that homophily in section C also drives new connections. However, in Model 6, the significance of NODEMATCH (C-C) 
diminishes when GWESP and GWDSP are added, suggesting that homophily in section C is less influential when more comprehensive 
network effects are considered.
Finally, Model 6 incorporates both GWESP and GWDSP to capture triadic closure and preferential attachment. Both variables are 
positive and statistically significant, showing that IPC codes with higher centrality tend to form new links with similarly central 
technologies, reinforcing clustering and centrality dynamics in the network. The α value for these terms was determined through 
multiple tests, and log (4) was found to optimize the model’s performance, as reflected in the lowest AIC.

4.6.2. STERGMs including persistence processes
To gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of persistence in the evolution of technology convergence networks, we chose to 
fix the tie formation process (’Form’) and step wisely introduce factors associated with the network persistence process (’Persist’). As 
depicted in Table 5, each model considers both ’Form’ and ’Persist’ processes. Building on Model 6, Models 7 through 12 introduce 
variables related to network persistence, aiming to evaluate its influence on the evolution of technology convergence while accounting 
for formation effects. Model 7 uses GWESP as a control for triadic closure and focuses on the EDGES feature to establish a baseline for 
how other variables impact the model.
NODECOV (Eigenvector Centrality) remains significant in the formation process, indicating that high-centrality nodes are crucial 
for generating new ties. ABSDIFF (Eigenvector Centrality) similarly suggests that smaller centrality differences facilitate link for­
mation. However, in the persistence process (Models 8–12), NODECOV weakens slightly, and ABSDIFF reverses its effect, with larger 
centrality differences hindering the sustainability of ties. This shift highlights that, while centrality is critical for both formation and 
persistence, disparities in node importance negatively impact long-term network stability.
Both NODECOV (NSIZE) and ABSDIFF (NSIZE) are non-significant in the formation process, indicating that node size does not 
significantly affect the creation of ties. However, in persistence, ABSDIFF (NSIZE) shows a significant negative impact in Models 11 
and 12, suggesting that larger size differences between technologies reduce the likelihood of sustaining ties.
NODEMATCH variables also display shifts between formation and persistence. Homophily in categories A, B, and C plays a sig­
nificant role in tie formation in Model 7, but persistence dynamics evolve as additional variables are introduced. NODEMATCH (C-C) 
retains significance across models, showing a robust homophily effect even with the inclusion of more complex variables like pref­
erential attachment. In contrast, NODEMATCH (A-A) and NODEMATCH (B-B) fluctuate, indicating that homophily effects in these

classes are more sensitive to other factors and less stable in persistence.
Finally, GWDSP remains significant in the persistence process, underscoring the importance of preferential attachment in main­
taining existing links. This suggests that technologies with common neighbors continue to maintain their relationships over time, 
highlighting the key role of preferential attachment in both forming and sustaining ties.
4.6.3. Parameter comparison between formation and persistence models
In this section, we focus on the differences between the formation and persistence processes in Model 12, examining how various 
factors uniquely drive the creation of new ties and the maintenance of existing ones.
First, NODECOV (Eigenvector Centrality) is significant and positive in both processes, but its effect is stronger in formation 
(3.328 for formation vs. 1.174 for persistence). This suggests that highly central technologies play a more critical role in forming new 
ties than in maintaining them. Conversely, ABSDIFF (Eigenvector Centrality) negatively impacts formation but positively influences 
persistence, indicating that greater differences in centrality hinder the creation of ties while supporting their long-term maintenance. 
NODECOV (NSIZE) is non-significant for tie formation but has a significant positive effect on persistence (0.002, p < 0.01), showing 
that larger technologies are more likely to sustain existing connections.
Second, the NODEMATCH homophily effects vary between formation and persistence. Class C has a strong homophily effect in 
persistence (0.661), indicating that technologies within the same IPC section are likely to maintain ties over time. While Class C is also 
positive in formation, its influence is less pronounced. Class A shows a strong homophily effect in tie formation but loses significance in 
persistence, implying that while ties form easily within Class A, they are less likely to persist over time.

Finally, both GWDSP and GWESP are consistently significant across formation and persistence. GWDSP shows that highly con­
nected technologies continue to attract new ties, while GWESP emphasizes that clustered ties are more likely to be maintained. These 
results highlight the importance of preferential attachment and transitivity in both forming and sustaining ties, underscoring their role 
in shaping the long-term structure of technology networks.
4.7. Model comparison
Moreover, Fig. 3 showcases a comparative analysis of the PR curves for different STERGM configurations, contrasting models that 
solely focus on the formation process against those that integrate both formation and persistence processes. These specific STERGMs 
were formulated using data from 2011-2019 and were evaluated against the 2020 data, serving as the observation network. The 
evaluation metrics reflect a notable enhancement in model fit when employing STERGMs that incorporate both formation and 
persistence processes (PR AUC 0.742), as opposed to models focusing solely on formation processes (PR AUC 0.665). The respective PR 
curves are displayed in Fig. 3: the left panel delineates the formation-only process, whereas the right panel encapsulates both the 
formation and persistence processes. This distinction underscores the superior fitting performance achieved by the integrated 
STERGMs, showcasing a more comprehensive understanding of network dynamics.
The STERGM model, developed with 2011-2019 data, forecasted the probability of technology convergence between various 
category pairs. For evaluation, pairs with a predicted probability greater than 0.5 were retained, totaling 316 predicted convergences. 
The 2020 data documented 449 instances of technology convergence. To gauge the model’s accuracy, a confusion matrix (Table 6) was 
generated:
The STERGM model’s performance metrics, when evaluated against the actual 2020 data, indicated an accuracy rate of approx­
imately 98.05%. Its recall (sensitivity) was around 59.24%, signifying its ability to capture a significant fraction of actual technology 
convergences. The precision rate was approximately 84.18%, indicating that a considerable percentage of its predictions were ac­
curate. Furthermore, with an F1-score of around 69.54%, the model exhibited a balanced performance between precision and recall, 
highlighting the robust predictive accuracy of the STERGM methodology.
4.8. Discussion on premature predictions
Predicting technology convergence has always been a challenging endeavor. STERGM emerges as a powerful tool, excelling in 
capturing and interpreting key mechanisms within networks, especially for promising technology pairs. However, every model has its 
limitations. For disruptive and burst technology convergences, STERGM might not provide precise predictions. An example is the 
breast cancer domain in 2020, where several high-probability predictions did not materialize. These “premature predictions” met 
initial conditions for convergence but had not yet converged, rather than indicating flaws in the model.

We analyzed the predictive outcomes of the STERGM model with a focus on those premature predictions in the 2020 data. The 
Table 7 lists a subset of predictions, including IPC code pairs, predicted convergence probabilities, actual convergence in 2020, 
prediction categorization, and patent occurrences up to 2020 and projected until 2023. Examining patent activities in the DERWENT 
database, the C07F-C12N pairing had a high convergence probability of 0.946 but no occurrences surpassed the 2020 threshold. 
However, patent counts increased from 30 in 2020 to 132 by 2023. Similar trends are seen in pairings like C07H-C40B and C07K-C08G, 
highlighting advancements in these sectors.
Although expected convergences did not occur in 2020, the robust uptrend trend in patents indicates their future prominence. 
These patterns underscore the importance of sustained monitoring, pointing towards the potential of these combinations to spearhead 
notable technological breakthroughs in the forthcoming years.
To illustrate the significance and potential of these technology convergences, let us delve deeper into some of the notable IPC pairs 
highlighted by the STERGM model:
C07F-C12N: involving acyclic, carbocyclic, or heterocyclic compounds combined with microorganisms or enzymes, presents a 
promising frontier for novel therapeutic agents. Key developments include: 2-Arylchromone Derivatives: Leveraged from microbial 
fermentation, these have shown potent antitumor effects against triple-negative breast cancer cells, with further research on their 
action mechanisms and potential combination therapies underway (Li et al., 2022). Cyclopropane Fatty Acid Derivatives: Engineered 
lipase technology has yielded compounds effective against HER2-positive breast cancer cells, with current studies focusing on 
structural optimization and delivery methods for clinical use (Xu, et al., 2022). These advances, along with ongoing optimization and 
in vivo studies, underscore the potential for clinical translation, highlighting the dynamic interplay of biochemistry and biotechnology 
in developing cancer therapeutics.
C07J-C12N: The intersection of organic chemistry and biotechnology is reshaping breast cancer treatment by enhancing precision 
medicine. This integration enables targeted therapies against specific markers like HER2, boosts immunotherapies for more effective 
cancer cell destruction, and advances personalized cell therapy tailored to individual patient needs. The promise of this approach is 
evident in ongoing clinical trials, such as the phase 1 study of SAR442168 for advanced solid tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023),

indicating a leap forward in treatment efficacy and safety. Supported by MarketsandMarkets (2023), the C07J-C12N integration is seen 
as a significant innovation in combating breast cancer.
4.9. Discussion on link intensification
Traditional approaches to technology convergence often rely on binary network analysis, which focuses solely on whether ties exist 
between technologies. While useful for mapping connections, this approach overlooks the evolving strength and intensity of these ties. 
STERGM is effective in analyzing tie formation and persistence, but its binary framework fails to capture deeper technological dy­
namics, such as how relationships between technologies intensify over time. To address this limitation, we expanded our approach 
after completing our binary network analysis using STERGM to examine the concept of intensification networks.
In intensification networks, links are classified based on whether they have intensified (coded as 1) or not (coded as 0) compared to 
the previous period. This allowed us to evaluate whether the intensification of existing ties—beyond their binary presence—offered 
new insights into technology convergence dynamics. By creating an intensification network, we could assess whether technologies 
with existing ties continued to strengthen over time.
Table 8 presents a year-wise breakdown comparing the binary and intensification networks. The table tracks key processes such as 
formation, persistence, dissolution, intensified edges, and non-intensified edges. These metrics illustrate the differences between a 
binary network’s ability to capture whether ties exist and an intensification network’s ability to capture how strong or weak those ties 
become over time. For example, in the binary network, the formation process shows new technological connections emerging, while 
the persistence and dissolution metrics indicate whether those ties remain or disappear. However, in the intensification network, we 
shift focus to whether those ties become stronger (intensified edges) or remain constant (non-intensified edges). As observed, the 
number of intensified edges steadily grows over the years, reflecting the increasing strength of technological ties in the breast cancer 
patent networks studied. From 73 intensified edges in 2012 to 145 in 2020, we see a consistent pattern of deepening technological 
relationships.
In this study, the results, summarized in Table 9, highlight several key insights into the dynamics of technology con­
vergence—insights that would have been overlooked had we focused solely on the binary network.
The comparison between the two network types reveals crucial distinctions, especially regarding centrality, homophily, and node 
size effects. In particular, the joint impact of NODECOV (Eigenvector Centrality) and ABSDIFF (Eigenvector Centrality) offers 
contrasting insights. In the intensification network, the influence of centrality on tie formation is significantly stronger (3.999) 
compared to the binary network (3.328), showing that centrality plays a more prominent role when accounting for the strength of 
connections. Meanwhile, the persistence phase sees a negative effect for ABSDIFF in both networks, indicating that larger disparities in 
node importance tend to weaken the likelihood of sustained ties, especially in the intensification context. Next, the homophily effects 
captured by NODEMATCH (A-A, B-B, C-C) are more pronounced in the intensification network, particularly during the formation 
process. For instance, NODEMATCH (C-C) in the intensification network has a much higher coefficient (0.811) than in the binary 
network (0.347). This suggests that technologies within the same category are more likely to deepen their ties rather than simply 
establish new ones, highlighting the greater relevance of homophily in the intensification framework.
In conclusion, while both the binary and intensification networks reveal similar overarching trends of technology convergence, the 
intensification network offers deeper insights into the dynamics of centrality and homophily.
5. Conclusions and limitations
5.1. Conclusions
This study analyzes technology convergence using STERGM, focusing on the persistence process. To answer the research questions:

formation and persistence the same or different?
In summary, the dynamics of technology convergence are influenced by factors such as node size, homophily, preferential

attachment, centrality, and network structural features like triadic closure. The mechanisms for tie formation and persistence differ, 
with certain factors like node size and centrality being more important for persistence, while homophily plays a role primarily in 
formation.
Our model reveals complex interdependencies between variables influencing technology convergence. For instance, NODEMATCH 
(homophily) is significant when GWDSP (network cohesion) is excluded but loses significance when GWDSP is included. This aligns 
with Barab´asi and Albert’s (1999) scale-free network theory, where nodes with more connections preferentially attract new links, and 
contrasts with Breschi and Lissoni (2009), who emphasized the role of homophily in innovation networks. Additionally, some scholars 
have observed that homophily and the preferential attachment rule can have reverse effects on network formation, notably, homophily 
can amplify the effects of basic preferential attachment (Kim & Altmann, 2017), which partially aligns with our findings. Additionally, 
technologies with high centrality (NODECOV - Eigenvector Centrality) are more likely to establish persistent ties, emphasizing their 
importance within the network. A negative ABSDIFF (difference in centrality) suggests that technologies with similar levels of cen­
trality are more likely to sustain their connections. This nuanced relationship contrasts with Park and Yoon (2014), who found that 
central nodes are active in both forming and maintaining ties. There are studies examining the impact of centrality on the formation of 
ties (Lu & Li, 2023). However, research on how centrality influences the maintenance of ties is relatively scarce. Our results suggest 
that centrality is more critical for persistence, highlighting the role of influential technologies in network stability.
Unlike traditional models that focus on a single static process, we separate the factors influencing tie formation from those affecting 
persistence. For example, the NSIZE variable, reflecting node size, is insignificant during the formation phase but becomes significant 
during the persistence phase. This suggests that while larger technologies may not initiate new connections, they are vital for 
maintaining existing relationships, highlighting their stable role within the innovation ecosystem. Our study findings echo the con­
clusions of Juhasz & Lengyel (2018), yet also present distinctions. They identified that the formation of new relationships is pre­
dominantly influenced by opportunities and network positioning, whereas the persistence of these relationships is deeply affected by 
the perceived value of the connection. Our results also contrast with studies like Yoon and Park (2004) and Sun and Grimes (2017), 
which found that larger nodes are more likely to form new ties due to their attractiveness and resource availability. Our findings 
indicate that node size is more crucial for tie persistence than formation, possibly because established technologies focus on sustaining 
relationships rather than expanding them.
RQ2: Does integrating persistence mechanisms enhance the predictive power for technology convergence?
Our findings confirm that integrating persistence mechanisms into the predictive model significantly enhances its accuracy and 
effectiveness. This is demonstrated by the improved Model Performance, where the STERGM model incorporating both formation 
and persistence processes achieves a higher Precision-Recall AUC (PR AUC) of 0.742, compared to 0.665 for models considering only 
formation. The Prediction Accuracy is also superior, with the combined model yielding an F1 score of 69.54% for predicting tech­
nology convergence in 2020. Additionally, the analysis of Type I Errors and premature predictions reveals that our model effectively 
identifies technology pairs poised for future convergence, even if they have not yet converged within the expected timeframe. These 
results collectively verify that accounting for both the formation of new ties and the maintenance of existing ones provides a more 
comprehensive and reliable prediction of technology convergence trends.

5.2. Limitations and implications
Our framework for studying technology convergence is scalable and could be applied to other fields. However, parameter estimates 
from our empirical study in the breast cancer treatment may not transfer directly and requiring contextual reassessment to affirm their 
relevance and accuracy.
In our methodology, we transformed two-mode Patent-IPC networks into one-mode IPC co-occurrence networks, thereby assuming 
that all pairs of IPC codes within a patent are related. This simplification can sometimes be unrealistic. Although STERGM can handle 
two-mode data directly, as demonstrated by Broekel and Bednarz (2018), applying it to our study would require analyzing links 
between IPCs and patents, which does not directly address technology convergence. While two-path structures via common patents 
could be considered, they offer an indirect approach to our research questions. Additionally, the separation assumption inherent in 
STERGM simplifies the analysis but may fail to capture dynamics where technologies exclude or replace each other, potentially 
oversimplifying complex interdependencies within technology networks. Future research should explore other factors influencing 
technology convergence and investigate dynamic models that address the complexities of valued networks and relax the separation 
assumption.
This study offers significant practical and theoretical contributions by distinguishing between formation and persistence mecha­
nisms in technology convergence. This differentiation enhances the identification and monitoring of disruptive and emerging tech­
nologies during their early stages, improving early scanning processes and enabling stakeholders to better anticipate and respond to 
evolving technological trends. Additionally, our findings show that separating tie formation from persistence improves prediction 
performance. This suggests that future research should develop more sophisticated predictive models that integrate both mechanisms. 
For instance, incorporating these processes into graph neural network models could significantly enhance the accuracy and appli­
cability of technology convergence predictions in real-world contexts.
