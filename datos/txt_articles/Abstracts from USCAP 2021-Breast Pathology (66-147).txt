Background: Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a histologically diverse group of malignancies defined by the 
presence of non-glandular epithelial (squamous) or mesenchymal (spindle or matrix producing) elements 
associated with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or conventional mammary type invasive carcinoma. We aimed to 
study the clinicopathologic characteristics and prognostic differences between MBC with coexistent DCIS and MBC 
without DCIS in our patient population. 
Design: A retrospective review of MBC was conducted (n = 125). Histologic slides were reviewed for variables 
including tumor morphology and hormonal status. Additional clinical data were obtained from electronic medical 
records. Bayesian Cox Proportional model method was used to determine the association between survival and 
several clinicopathologic variables. 
Results: Of the 125 patients diagnosed with MBC, 47 (37.6%) had coexistent DCIS and 78 (62.4%) were not 
associated with DCIS. High grade, solid DCIS was the most common pattern (83%) identified in the group with 
DCIS. Squamous differentiation (36.2%) was the metaplastic component most common in the group with DCIS. 
Heterologous differentiation (32.1%) was the metaplastic component most common in the group without DCIS. The 
group with DCIS had a smaller mean tumor size (3 cm) compared with the group without DCIS (5 cm) [P = 0.0048]. 
The group with DCIS also presented at a lower clinical-stage compared with the group without DCIS [P <0.0001]. 
The group with DCIS were more likely to be obese compared to the group without DCIS [P = 0.006], however, this 
effect had no impact on overall survival. MBC with coexistent DCIS had a longer mean overall survival (62.2 
months) compared with MBC without DCIS (44.4 months), however, this finding was not statistically significant. 
Patient clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes are summarized in Table 1.

Conclusions: Metaplastic breast carcinoma is a rare and heterogeneous disease and results from our patient 
population suggest that squamous differentiation is the metaplastic component most commonly seen in MBC with 
coexistent DCIS.  In addition, MBC with coexistent DCIS appears to present at a lower clinical-stage compared with 
MBC without DCIS. Additional research in this area is needed to further elucidate the clinical implications of this 
finding.

Long Term Outcomes in Encapsulated and Solid Papillary Carcinoma of the Breast, High 
Risk of Local Recurrence with Close and Positive Margins 
Dhuha Al-Sajee1, Phillip Williams2

Toronto, Toronto, Canada 
Disclosures: Dhuha Al-Sajee: None; Phillip Williams: None 
Background: Encapsulated papillary carcinoma (EPC) and solid papillary carcinoma (SPC) of the breast without 
concurrent invasive carcinoma are favorable lesions in the breast with behavior similar to an in-situ lesion. Yet, it is 
hard to predict patient outcome. Conservative surgical excision is the standard treatment, with some patients 
receiving sentinel lymph node biopsy, endocrine therapy, or radiation. The focus of our study is to investigate the 
overall long-term outcomes in relation to histological characteristics of EPC and SPC. 
Design: We retrospectively examined the long-term outcomes of EPC and SPC cases from January 1, 2005, to 
January 31, 2020. Resection specimens coded as a breast mastectomy or lumpectomy with the words “solid”, 
“papillary”, “intracystic”, or “encapsulated” in the diagnosis or comment field were identified in the electronic medical 
records. All pathology reports meeting these criteria were reviewed, and cases with a concurrent invasive 
carcinoma excluded. An anonymized unique study identification number was assigned to each case. The 
histological, clinical, and follow-up information, as well as outcome, were recorded; these data included age at 
diagnosis, site of the lesion, size of the lesion, lymph node status, margin status, local recurrence, metastatic 
disease, and death. 
Results: We identified 11 EPC and 8 SPC cases with follow-up available. All patients were females and the mean 
age at diagnosis was 66.5 years, range: 46-88 years. All cases of EPC/SPC were associated with DCIS. EPC and 
SPC had a reported mean size of 29.8 mm and 29.5 mm respectively. Follow-up time ranged from 1 month to 20 
years with a mean follow-up of 4.6 years. No cases of SPC had a local or distant recurrence. Three cases of EPC 
developed local recurrence for a recurrence rate of 27% (3/11). All EPC cases with local recurrence had either 
close or positive margins: DCIS 1mm to posterior margin (1/3), DCIS present at the posterior margin with superior 
and anterior margins close at 1mm (1/3), and  EPC <1mm to lateral margin t (1/3). No EPC cases developed 
distant metastatic disease or death from the disease. 
Conclusions: Based on the sampled cases of EPC, we observed that positive or close margins (1mm or less) 
were at a higher risk of local recurrence. Re-excision of close margins should be considered in these cases and 
close follow-up is needed. Among EPC cases, including those with local recurrence, none developed distant 
metastatic disease or death from the disease.

Center, Columbus, OH 
Disclosures: Rana Aldrees: None; Tiansheng Shen: None; Gene Siegal: None; Shi Wei: None 
Background: There has been compelling evidence published demonstrating the prognostic significance of Tumor-
infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) in various solid cancers, including BC. A high level of TILs is reportedly associated 
with a favorable prognosis in TNBC, a subtype generally associated with a poor clinical outcome but highly 
heterogeneous. There have been limited studies investigating the importance of subsets of T-cells in TILs. 
Moreover, the significance of intratumoral vs. peritumoral TILs remains controversial. In this study, we sought to 
explore the prognostic relevance of tumor-associated CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and FOXP3+ regulatory T cells in 
TNBC. 
Design: Consecutive excisional TNBC cases prior to chemotherapy in the authors' institution were retrieved 
between 2001 and 2015. Those with de novo metastatic BC, bilateral BC, a second malignancy, patients not 
receiving systemic chemotherapy and cases without a tumor-host interface in the tissue sections were excluded. 
 
 
 
 
74 
This resulted in a total of 35 cases meeting the inclusion criteria. Intratumoral TILs were characterized as stromal 
TILs within the borders of the invasive tumor, while peritumoral TILs were defined as TILs within one high power 
field (HPF; 0.5 mm) of the invasive front. The CD8+ and FOXP3+ cell count (expressed as per HPF on average of 
10 HPFs) and their ratios were dichotomized on the basis of the median value. The median follow up time was 7 
years. 
Results: There was a wide range of CD8+ and FOXP3+ T-cells within the peritumoral (27-410 and 1-38, 
respectively) and intratumoral stroma (1-105 and 0-24, respectively). Both CD8+ and FOXP3+ TILs were 
significantly higher at the former location than the latter (157 vs. 25, P<0.0001 and 10 vs. 5, P=0.003). The 
numbers of CD8+ and FOXP3+ T-cells, either within peritumoral or intratumoral stroma, were not significantly 
associated with distant relapse-free or disease-specific survival (RFS/DSS), probably attributed to their wide-
ranging distribution. However, the peritumoral CD8+/FOXP3+ ratio of TILs was significantly associated with a 
prolonged RFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.3, P=0.04) and DSS (HR 0.2, P=0.02). This association was not observed with 
the CD8+/FOXP3+ ratio of intratumoral TILs. As expected, pathologic tumor and nodal stages were both significantly 
associated with survival outcomes. 
Conclusions: While the numbers of CD8+ and FOXP3+ T cells were not associated with prognostic outcomes, the 
peritumoral CD8+/FOXP3+ ratio showed a significant positive correlation with RFS and DSS in TNBC. These 
observations suggest that the immunological balance in the tumor microenvironment might determine antitumor 
immunity. Further, the peritumoral TILs appear to play a more important role in the progression of TNBC when 
compared to the intratumoral TILs, thus reaffirming the necessity of revisiting the method for assessment of TILs in 
the pursuit of precision medicine.

Background: In 2020, American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) 
released new recommendations to consider Invasive Breast Cancer (IBC) with 1-10% Estrogen Receptor (ER) 
positivity by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as low ER+ with a comment to reflect the limited data on the overall 
benefit of Endocrine Therapy (ET) in such patients. We studied the benefit of ET in low ER+/HER2- IBC patients & 
compared their survival to triple negative (TN-) IBC patients. 
Design: All IBC patients with low ER+/HER2- from 2010-2018 were identified (n=67). ER was interpreted using 
IHC based on ASCO/CAP guidelines at the time of reporting. These cases were compared to a control group of 
similar pT stage TN- IBC cases (n=67). We retrospectively retrieved clinical data (age, ET, chemo & radiotherapy) 
& histopathologic features (Tumor type, grade, pT stage, highest ER IHC %). Outcomes studied were recurrence, 
metastasis, Disease Free Survival (DFS) & Overall Survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier curves were generated & 
compared using log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox hazards models. 
Results: Low ER+ patients showed a median age of 59 years (range 31-89). The median ER IHC was 3% (1-10%) 
& the median tumor grade was 3. Tumor types included: Ductal-No special type (54/67), Lobular (5/67), mixed 
(2/67), & special ductal (6/67). 
ET was given to 33/67 (49%) patients [Anastrozole (Arimidex) in 18/33], 9/33 (27%) patients had ET related side 
effects (hot flashes x3, arthralgia x2, other x4). Table shows clinical & histopathologic features of cases; no 
significant relationship was observed between the variables. 
The median follow-up was 1219 days (range 71-3697). Two of the low ER+ patients were alive with disease, 9 
patients died due to IBC, & 3 died due to other causes. Figure 1 shows no statistically significant difference in OS 
 
 
 
 
75 
(p=0.188) & DFS (p=0.233) for those received ET vs. No ET. In addition, no statistically significant difference in OS 
(p=0.359) & DFS (p=0.442) is observed between low ER+ & TN- IBC (Figure 2). 
Multivariate analysis showed that pT stage was the only independent predictor for OS in the low ER+ cohort.

Conclusions: Our study shows no survival benefit with ET in low ER+ IBC patients & outcome that is similar to TN- 
IBC patients. Therefore, our findings support the current ASCO/CAP guidelines in considering ER cases with 1-
10% staining on IHC as low ER+ separating them from the rest of ER+ IBC. Larger, prospective longitudinal studies 
are needed to validate these findings.

Histopathologic Features and the Effects of Androgen Therapy in Breast Tissue of Female-
to-Male Transgender Individuals

1University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 
Disclosures: Emily Anderson: None; Kim Rabe: None; Lianne Siegel: None; Jessica Butts: None; Molly Klein: 
None 
Background: Few studies have described the histopathologic features in gender affirming mastectomy specimens 
from female-to-male transgender men (TM), and even fewer have specifically addressed the effects of exogenous 
androgen therapy (AT). This is the largest study to describe the histopathologic features in breast specimens from 
TM with and without a history of AT, and to compare them to a control group of elective breast reduction specimens 
from cisgender women. 
Design: Data from chart review and blinded slide review was collected for 289 TM undergoing gender-affirming 
bilateral mastectomy (237 were on AT and 52 were not). These 2 groups were then compared to 63 cisgender 
women undergoing bilateral elective breast reduction using Fisher’s Exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests. 
Results: Results from 289 TM subjects (median age 24, range:14-59), of which 237 were on AT and 52 were not, 
and 63 cisgender women subjects (median age 33, range: 15-68) were analyzed. Four tissue cassettes were 
submitted per subject (median). In breast tissue from TM on AT, lobules occupy 5% of the examined area (median), 
and 70% of the lobules show intralobular atrophy (median). Longer exogenous AT use among TM was associated 
with a lower median percentage of lobules by area (p<0.001). TM on AT and without AT both had a significantly 
higher median percentage of intralobular atrophy compared to the cisgender women (p=0.001). For TM on AT, the 
mastectomy specimens showed some degree of inflammation in 20.3%, duct ectasia in 16.0%, apocrine cysts in 
12.2%, non-apocrine cysts in 11.8%, fibroadenomatoid change in 10.2%, luminal calcifications in 5.1%, usual 
ductal hyperplasia in 4.2%, fibroadenomas in 3.4%, columnar cell change in 2.1% and atypia in 0.8%. The atypia in 
specimens from TM included 2 cases of atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) and 1 case of flat epithelial atypia (FEA). 
In the control group showed atypia in 3.2% (one case with atypical ductal hyperplasia and one case with ALH and 
FEA). There were no cases of invasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ across groups. 
 
 
 
 
77 
Conclusions: Histologic findings observed in TM on AT include increased intralobular atrophy compared to 
cisgender breast reductions and a reduction in percentage lobules by area with increased length of AT. The 
prevalence of atypia was low among all subjects and did not differ significantly across groups. With an even larger 
number of cases (obtained by extending the time frame for inclusion), we will further analyze the results, controlling 
for age and BMI.

Background: Two types of macrophages are present in tumor microenvironment. M1 macrophages exhibit potent 
anti-tumor properties, while M2 macrophages play the pro-tumoral roles. The presence of M2 macrophages is 
associated with worsened overall survival in triple negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) patients. However, the 
relationship between M2 macrophages and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is unknown. 
Design: M2 macrophages were investigated on biopsy whole sections from 66 TNBCs treated with NAC by CD163 
together with other immune checkpoint markers (PD1, PD-L1 and CD8) using a multi-color immunohistochemical 
multiplex assay. 
Results: Incomplete response was significantly associated with older age, lower PD-L1 expression (tumor and 
stroma), lower levels of CD8-positive TILs in stroma, but higher level of CD163-positive macrophages, with the 
level of CD163-positive macrophages in peritumoral area as the strongest factor. (Table 1)

Background: Very few studies have investigated mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency in breast carcinoma (BC). 
Given the recent FDA approval of Pembrolizumab for unresectable solid tumors with dMMR, we aimed to examine 
MMR status in clinically advanced breast carcinoma. 
Design: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with anti-MLH1, anti-PMS2, anti-MSH2 or anti-MSH6 was performed on 
metastatic triple negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) specimens routinely or other BC specimens by clinician’s 
request to evaluate MMR status in our institution since 2017 after FDA approval of Pembrolizumab for solid tumors 
with dMMR. In addition, next generation sequencing (NGS) approach (FoundationOne® CDx, Foundation 
Medicine) to detect microsatellite instability was also performed. 
Results: Current cohort contained 127 clinical advanced BCs, including 4 primary, 14 locally recurrent and 109 
metastatic BCs. Twenty-four were ER-positive/HER2-negative, 16 were HER2+, and 87 were TNBCs. MMR status 
was evaluated by IHCs in 95 cases and by NGS in 32 cases. Among all 127 cases, only one case (0.8%) showed 
MMR deficiency. (Table 1) The case with MMR deficiency showed loss of MLH1 and PMS2 proteins, but no 
hypermethylation of MLH1 promoter on MLH1 promoter methylation study. Sequencing analysis 
revealed MLH1 genetic alteration with a splice site mutation (208-1G>A), which results in disruption of the N-
terminal ATPase-containing domain (amino acids 25-336) and inactivation of MLH1 protein.

Pathologic Characterization of Non-Malignant Breast Lesions Detected by 3D-Digital 
Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) Versus 2D-Digital Mammography (DM)

University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 
Disclosures: Jasmeet Assi: None; Ira Bleiweiss: None; Anupma Nayak: None 
Background: Breast cancer screening using 3D-DBT has resulted in increased detection of small cancers and a 
reduction in recall rates across all age and breast density groups compared with 2D-DM. Little is known about its 
effect on detection of high risk lesions of the breast. In this study, we explore whether the range and frequency of 
 
 
 
 
80 
non-malignant diagnoses has changed with the implementation of 3D-DBT or if it yields core biopsies with 
nonspecific histology in greater numbers. 
Design: At our institution, 3D-DBT was adopted as the frontline breast cancer screening modality in September 
2011. In this retrospective analysis, we compared the pathologic diagnoses of non-malignant core biopsies 
diagnosed at our institution during two consecutive 2 year periods, the 2 years before and the 2 years after the 
change from 2D-DM to 3D-DBT. We also compared the frequency of specific radiologic findings during these two 
periods. The percent change was calculated between the 2 periods of time as well as the p value (Fisher's exact 
test). 
Results: A total of 512 cases were diagnosed as non-malignant, including 230 detected by 2D-DM (pre 3D-DBT 
period) and 282 detected by 3D-DBT (post 3D-DBT implementation). The change in modality accounted for a 18% 
increase in core biopsies. With respect to non-malignant pathologic findings, radial scar, papilloma, ADH, lobular 
neoplasia, duct ectasia, nonspecific benign changes, and PASH all had an increase (percent change), most notable 
being radial scar (362.2%), intraductal papilloma (75.7%) and PASH (715.6%). Fibrocystic changes, fibroadenoma, 
lymph node, miscellaneous benign tumors, and fat necrosis all had decreases (percent change), most prominent 
being lymph node (-30.1%) and fibrocystic changes (-27.4%). The lesions that did change 
statistically significantly with the introduction of 3D-DBT were radial scar (p=0.003), fibrocystic changes (p=0.017), 
and PASH (p=0.009). With regards to radiologic findings, there was an increase in architectural distortion, 
asymmetry, mass, and dilated ducts; and a decrease in calcifications and cysts. However, only change in 
architectural distortion showed statistical significance (p=0.009). See table 1 for complete data.

Conclusions: 3D-DBT detected more benign risk-associated pathologic lesions, including radial scar and

557 Core Needle Biopsies

Kwait: None; Susan Lester: None 
Background: Architectural distortion (AD) is a localized alteration in the uniform texture of the breast characterized 
by lines radiating from a central point, without a definite mass. This finding has become more common due to the 
increased ability of tomosynthesis to detect these subtle findings. Radiologic/pathologic correlation is more difficult 
in this setting because the types of lesions producing AD are not as well defined as the more common findings of 
masses or calcifications and, thus, what signifies a discordant finding requiring excision is unclear. There is also 
only limited data about the types of benign lesions on core needle biopsy (CNB) that are predictive of carcinoma on 
excision. 
Design: The objective was to determine the types of lesions on CNBs performed for AD and the likelihood of 
malignancy on excision. Pathology reports for CNBs and subsequent excisions from 01/01/2015 to 08/01/2020 
were identified. 
Results: 557 CNBs met inclusion criteria (Table 1). The most common lesion was invasive cancer (29%).  Lobular 
(31%) and cancers with lobular features (17%) comprised 48% of cases, whereas 42% of the cancers were ductal. 
93% were grade 1 or 2, 98% were ER-positive, and 98% were HER2-negative. Ductal carcinoma in situ was found 
in an additional 21 cases (4%). 
The second most common type of lesion (29%) included those with sclerosis (complex or radial sclerosing lesions 
and sclerosing adenosis). If no atypia was present, only 1 case (2%) was found to have malignancy on excision. In 
this case, DCIS was present adjacent to the sclerosing lesion. 
There were 39 cases of ADH or cases described as “atypical”. Of these, 12 of 34 undergoing excision (35%) 
showed malignancy. There were 33 cases of ALH/LCIS, and 4 of 20 undergoing excision (20%) showed 
malignancy. An associated sclerosing lesion did not increase the risk of malignancy. 
The remaining 181 cases had a variety of benign findings that did not clearly correlate with AD. Of the 63 cases 
undergoing excision, 8% showed malignancy.

* One small invasive carcinoma was completely removed by the core needle biopsy. 
** These categories do not include cases in which a sclerosing lesion was also present. These cases are reported 
separately. 
*** Includes sclerosing adenosis, radial sclerosing lesion (radial scar), and complex sclerosing lesion. 
Conclusions: 29% of lesions causing AD were due to invasive carcinomas that were likely to be grade 1 or 2 and 
have lobular features. 29% were associated with sclerosing lesions. If no atypia was present, the likelihood of 
malignancy on excision was very low (2%). 32% of CNBs showed non-specific benign findings, making a 
determination of radiology correlation challenging. However, only 8% of cases undergoing excision showed 
malignancy. Both atypical ductal and lobular lesions were predictive of malignancy on excision regardless of the 
presence of a sclerosing lesion. This is in contrast to incidental ALH/LCIS associated with other types of lesions 
(such as masses or calcifications), for which the likelihood of malignancy is <5%. Although the number of cases is 
low, ALH/LCIS may be a predictor of malignancy in the setting of AD, perhaps due to the higher association of 
invasive carcinomas with lobular features with AD.

Clinicopathological Features of Microinvasive Carcinomas of the Breast: An Institutional 
Experience

Disclosures: Deyze Badarane: None; Farnaz Hasteh: None; Oluwole Fadare: None; Somaye Zare: None 
Background: The widespread use and improved sensitivity of screening methods have led to increased early 
detection of in situ and microinvasive carcinomas of the breast. Microinvasive carcinomas (MIC) are relatively 
uncommon, and the prognosis and clinical management of patients that are diagnosed with MIC remain 
controversial. The current study is a comprehensive evaluation of clinicopathologic characteristics, including patient 
outcomes, in an institutional cohort of MIC. 
Design: The study cohort consisted of all patients with a final pathologic stage of pT1mi in a breast excision 
specimen over a 20-year period. Clinicopathologic data were collected and analyzed. For comparative analyses 
 
 
 
 
83 
regarding the frequency of lymph node (LN) metastases, two additional cohorts of pTis [DCIS] and pT1a [invasive] 
cancers that were diagnosed over a shorter timeframe, were used. 
Results: Excisions from a total of 87 patients, median age of 57 y (range 29-84) were identified. MIC was 
diagnosed in the preceding biopsy in only 33% of cases. The background in situ carcinoma was most frequently 
intermediate and high grade DCIS (93.1%); the remainder were LCIS (4.6%) and low grade DCIS (2.2%). LN 
involvement was identified in 5 cases (5.7%: 1 macroscopic, 3 microscopic and 1 isolated tumor cells). In 
comparison, LN metastasis was detected in 1.1% and 7.2% of separate DCIS and pT1a cohorts respectively. MIC 
was multifocal in 16 cases (18.4%). The presence of multifocal disease was significantly associated with larger 
extent of in situ disease (p= .001) and no hormone receptor expression (p=.017), but not LN metastasis, patient 
age or recurrence rates. HER2/neu overexpression was detected in 35 (40.2%) of tumors. HER2/neu 
overexpression was significantly associated with high grade DCIS (p= .001) and negative hormone receptor status 
(p<.001), but not LN metastasis, extent of the disease, patient age or recurrence rates. Overall, after an average 
follow up duration of 50.4 months, only 1 patient (1.1%) experienced a recurrence in ipsilateral breast. 
Conclusions: The rate of LN involvement in MIC -5.7%- is higher than DCIS, which highlights the significance of 
the finding.  Multifocality of the microinvasion was not of any prognostic significance in our cohort. MIC are 
commonly HER2/neu-positive (approximately 40%), which is probably a function of the background high grade 
DCIS from which they arise. However, in contrast to invasive carcinomas, HER2/neu overexpression in MIC is not 
associated with LN metastases or higher recurrence rates.

Can Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Be Spared in High Nuclear Grade, Extensive Size and/or 
HER2+ DCIS with Upstage on Excision

Disclosures: Mara Banks: None; Evgeny Yakirevich: None; Li Juan Wang: None; Yihong Wang: None 
Background: Microinvasive breast cancer is defined by the presence of 1mm or less invasive cancer and is 
considered a subset of T1 disease (T1mi) by AJCC and associated with a background of ductal carcinoma in situ 
(DCIS) in most cases. Studies have investigated the histopathological characteristics and clinical outcomes of 
microinvasive DCIS; however, impact factors such as the DCIS size, nuclear grade, presence of comedo necrosis, 
and/or HER2 status on decision marking for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) have not been well addressed. The 
current literature suggests lack of a consensus in the surgical management of this disease. Since patients can 
occasionally develop metastatic disease, SLNB is often considered during surgery. 
Design: A retrospective review of consecutive cases diagnosed preoperatively with DCIS or DCIS suspicious for 
microinvasion on core needle biopsy (CNB) was performed at our institution from 2009 to 2019. Forty-eight cases 
were identified with the inclusion criteria of upstage on excision and available clinical follow up information. Slides 
were reviewed and pathological parameters, biomarkers and relevant clinical information were recorded. 
Results: All 48 patients were females with mean age of 63 (range 34-98 years). Eighty-eight percent (42/48) of the 
cases were T1mi and 12.5% (6/48) were upstaged to T1a on excision. SLNB was performed on 50% (24/48) of the 
cases. The histological features on CNB of the 48 DCIS included 69% with nuclear grade 3, 89% with comedo 
necrosis, 27% with extensive DCIS size (>= 40 mm) and 42% with HER2 positivity. Of the 24 cases that underwent 
SLNB, the percentage of those histological parameters increased to 79% for nuclear grade 3, 100% for presence of 
comedo necrosis, 42% for extensive size and 75% for HER2 positivity. One case underwent SLNB revealed a 
positive SLN (4.2%, 1/24). This patient had a 52mm extensive DCIS, nuclear grade 3 with comedo necrosis and 
HER2 positivity. All patients were alive and disease free without recurrence with a mean follow up of 57.6 months. 
Conclusions: CNB DCIS with upstage on excision rarely involves SLN even in DCIS with extensive size, high 
nuclear grade, and presence of comedo necrosis and/or HER2 positivity. The overall prognosis and long term 
survival is excellent.  We propose that evaluation of SLNB should not be indicated in patients with DCIS who are 
managed by local control lumpectomy.

Disclosures: Esther Baranov: None; Erin Alston: None; Susan Lester: None; Christopher Fletcher: None; Leona 
Doyle: None 
Background: Superficial angiomyxoma (SAM) is a benign neoplasm typically involving dermis and 
subcutis and composed of bland spindle cells and prominent small vessels in a myxoid stroma. A subset of cases 
(especially of breast or external ear canal) are associated with Carney complex, but mutations in PRKAR1A are 
found in both sporadic and syndromic cases. Approximately 20% recur when incompletely excised. SAM of breast 
may arise subcutaneously in the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) or within parenchyma; however, these lesions are 
not well-recognized, may mimic myxoid fibroepithelial lesions or reactive proliferations, and have been described in 
the literature by other names (e.g. 'myxoma', 'nodular mucinosis'). This study characterizes the clinical and 
histologic features of angiomyxoma of breast. 
Design: 43 cases were identified from surgical pathology and consultation files. Clinical demographics and 
histologic features were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry for PRKAR1A was performed on 33 cases; data for 
CD34, S-100, smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin, p63 and pan-keratin were available for a subset. 
Results: 25 patients were female and 18 male; median age was 41 years (range 14 - 72). Most cases (58%) 
presented as slow-growing parenchymal masses, 21% as subcutaneous NAC masses, and 21% as subcutaneous 
masses outside the NAC. 44% were thought to represent other entities, including low-grade sarcomas, based on 
submitting differential diagnoses. All showed classic features of SAM at other locations: bland spindle/stellate 
fibroblasts in a myxoid stroma, elongated thin-walled vasculature, and a neutrophilic infiltrate in 70%. Mitotic rate 
was low overall (<1 per 10 hpf). Most tumors were hypocellular, poorly circumscribed and lobulated; 10 showed 
prominent infiltrative growth, and tumors of the NAC often infiltrated through areolar muscle. 53% involved breast 
parenchyma histologically with adjacent or entrapped benign breast lobules. Additional features included 
pseudocystic change (35%), mild degenerative nuclear atypia (28%) and mast cell infiltrates (72%). Unusual 
features were increased cellularity in 6 parenchymal tumors, 4 of which had increased mitoses (up to 6 per 10 hpf). 
Tumor cells showed loss of PRKAR1A expression in 58% of cases. CD34 expression was seen in 57% and SMA in 
40%; S-100, desmin, p63 and pan-keratin were consistently negative. One tumor recurred multiple (5) times. No 
patient had a known history of Carney complex. 
Conclusions: Angiomyxomas of the breast may arise in subcutaneous or parenchymal locations and are under-
recognized, particularly when parenchymal. Histologic features are identical to those of SAM at other sites, but 
parenchymal tumors may show greater cellularity, entrapped breast lobules and infiltrative growth, making 
diagnosis more difficult. Recognition of classic features, absence of a fibroepithelial lesion, and loss of PRKAR1A 
expression are helpful diagnostic clues.

Background: In breast cancer (BC), neither a specific phenotype nor a morphological pattern is known to reliably 
assess the presence of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) at the genomic level. Identifying HRD in triple 
negative (TN) and luminal B (LB) could help to better select the target group for platinum salts and PARP inhibitors 
(PARPi). However, systematic assessment of HRD by screening for BRCA1/2 mutations for all LB and TNBC

image analysis could be a cost-effective tool to associate complex features of tissue organization with genomic 
alterations. In this study, we present an image-based approach to predict HR status, grade, molecular class of BC 
from Hematoxylin Eosin (HE) slides using deep learning. 
Design: We use stratified K-fold (K = 5) nested cross-validation using a total of n=1628 whole slide images (WSI) 
HE stained with molecular associated data from two independent datasets (In-house, n=813 patients; and The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), n=815 patients). These two datasets encompass annotations of HRD status, set by 
LST signature of Popova et al (998 LST low and 630 LST “high”), molecular class (1178 luminal; 450 TN) and 
germline BRCA (gBRCA) status (236 gBRCA1; 216 gBRCA2). After splitting the WSI into tiles and encoding them 
with ResNet50 trained on ImageNet, we use several convolutional neural networks approaches: AttentionMIL 
(Isle et al), CHOWDER (Courtiol et al), Self-attention mechanism (Li et al) and CONAN (in house model) to predict 
the labels (Figure1). 
Results: We first assessed the prediction of HR status. On Luminal AFA-fixed tumors subgroup of in-house 
dataset, the accuracy was 0,68±0,06 with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0,78±0,05. In TCGA cohort the results 
were not significantly different from random. Conversely, our network was able to predict molecular class with an 
accuracy of 0,70±0,05 and an AUC of 0,76±0,07 on TCGA and an accuracy of 0,8±0,04 with an AUC of 0,89±0,05 
on in-house cohorts. Furthermore, on in-house cohort, the identification of gBRCA1/2 mutations demonstrated an 
accuracy of 0,68±0,03 and an AUC of 0,73±0,06 and separated grade 1 and 3 with an accuracy of 0,81±0,09 and 
an AUC of 
Figure 1 - 78 
 
Conclusions: Our results show that there is a clear link between tissue phenotype and HR status. HR status may 
be assessed from tissue data, albeit with an accuracy that would need to be improved to be used in clinical 
practice. The discrepancy between results obtained between TCGA and in-house datasets demonstrates that for 
complicated prediction tasks going beyond a pure automatization of a pathologist’s assessment, it is essential to 
use curated data where the effect of potential confounders can be controlled. Larger cohorts will improve these 
encouraging results, paving the way to a simple, cheap and reliable biological stratification for breast cancers to 
undergo genomic analysis.

Background: Phyllodes tumors (PT) are categorized by World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors 
as benign, borderline, and malignant. A study conducted at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) by Tan et 
al developed a recurrence risk assessment tool, which calculates a nomogram score based on three histological 
criteria (cytological Atypia, Mitosis and stromal Overgrowth) and the Surgical margin status (AMOS criteria). This 
score helps predict recurrence free survival in patients with diagnosis of PT.  We aimed to compare the clinical 
usefulness of SGH nomogram with the WHO classification.  
Design: We identified 270 cases of PT (15 year period) with available information to calculate the nomogram 
score. The data was extracted from pathology reports. Slides were reviewed for cases with missing information for 
calculation of nomogram scores. Recurrence data was obtained from electronic medical records. Average 
nomogram scores for each of the WHO classes with respect to surgical margin status were compared. Recurrence 
rate for WHO classes is reported. The PTs with and without recurrence were compared for each of the nomogram 
components, age, and tumor size.  
Results: Of the 270 total cases, 195 (72%) were classified as benign, 49 (18%) as borderline, and 26 (10%) as 
malignant. Final surgical margin status was positive in 39% of benign, 14% of borderline and 0% of malignant 
cases. For PTs with negative margins, the average SGH nomogram scores were 4.5 for benign, 14.7 for borderline, 
and 32.1 for malignant. For PTs with positive margins, the average SGH nomogram scores were 43.8 for benign 
and 54.3 for borderline. The recurrence rate was 2.3% for benign (average follow up of 49 months), 4.3% for 
borderline (average follow up of 62 months), and 25% for malignant (average follow up of 44 months). The 
difference was statistically significant (benign vs malignant p-value: 0.0002). Follow up data was available on 246 
cases. Cases that recurred (n=12) and cases without recurrence (n=234) are compared in table 1.

Conclusions: Despite positive margin status, benign PTs only rarely recur and therefore utility of SGH nomogram 
is limited in such cases. Other features of nomogram (atypia, mitosis, and overgrowth) are important in determining 
recurrence but are also used for WHO classification. Older age and larger tumor size are associated with 
recurrence, but both of these parameters are more commonly observed with malignant PT (data not shown). WHO 
3-tiered classification is clinically useful, with SGH nomogram possibly useful in select cases.

Background: Breast adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) has overlapping immunophenotypic and histologic features 
with basal-like triple negative ductal carcinomas (TNBC). However, breast AdCC has a more favorable clinical 
course, making the distinction critical for patient treatment and prognosis. Similar to salivary gland AdCC, breast 
AdCC demonstrates recurrent genomic alterations including t(6;9) MYB-NFIB gene fusion, MYB gene amplification, 
and MYBL1 gene rearrangement, which can be confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We 
previously showed that immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MYB is a sensitive marker for breast AdCC (Am J Surg 
Pathol. 2017;41:973-9). A novel assay, chromogenic RNA ISH for MYB, has emerged having equivalent sensitivity 
and superior specificity for salivary gland AdCC compared to MYB IHC. Here, we evaluate MYB RNA ISH in 
invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC), with an emphasis on basal-like TNBC. 
Design: Recent cases (2019-2020) of breast AdCC in which MYB RNA ISH was performed were identified in the 
pathology archives. MYB RNA ISH was performed with a commercially available probe (Advanced Cell 
Diagnostics, Hayward, CA) on previously-constructed tissue microarrays containing 78 evaluable IDC, including 30 
basal-like TNBC (EGFR+ and/or CK5/6+), 19 luminal A (ER+/HER2-), 12 HER2+ (ER-/HER2+), 11 non-basal-like 
TNBC, and 6 luminal B (ER+/HER2+). Control RNA ISH for the housekeeping gene PPIB was performed on all 
cases. MYB RNA ISH overexpression was defined as >3 punctate signals or 1 large clumped signal in the nucleus 
or cytoplasm of >30% of tumor cells, with rare single signals considered negative. Half (50%, n=15/30) of the basal-
like TNBC were previously evaluated by MYB IHC and FISH (Am J Surg Pathol. 2017;41:973-9). 
Results: MYB RNA ISH overexpression was seen in 100% (n=5/5) of breast AdCC and 10% (n=8/78) of IDC 
(p<0.0001). Specifically, MYB RNA ISH overexpression was seen in 37% (n=7/19) of luminal A and 8% (n=1/12) 
HER2+ IDC, and in no cases of basal-like TNBC, non-basal-like TNBC, or luminal B IDC.  MYB RNA ISH signals 
were strong and diffuse in AdCC but focal in IDC. Confirmatory MYB FISH was performed as part of the diagnostic 
evaluation of two AdCC, both of which demonstrated MYB gene rearrangement. As previously reported, MYB IHC 
was positive in 60% (n=9/15) of basal-like TNBC, with MYB rearrangement detected in 7% (n=1/15). 
 
 
 
 
88 
Figure 1 - 80 
 
Conclusions: MYB RNA ISH is equally sensitive but has superior specificity for breast AdCC compared to MYB 
IHC and FISH, with MYB RNA ISH labeling seen in a notable subset of luminal A IDC but no basal-like TNBC. The 
potential significance of MYB RNA ISH labeling in luminal A carcinomas merits further evaluation; interestingly, 
MYB is postulated to play a role in DNA damage repair in ER+ breast cancer (Oncogene. 2019;38:5239-
49).  MYB RNA ISH is sensitive and specific for breast AdCC and could be a useful, rapid diagnostic adjunct in the 
work-up of a TNBC in the breast.

Background: Gender assigning surgeries are increasing in number. Testosterone therapy (TT) and bilateral 
mastectomies are part of the female-to-male reassignment process. Increasing female transgender individuals are 
initiating testosterone for masculinization before proceeding to mastectomy to affirm their gender identity. To date, 
the histopathologic effects on breast tissue from exogenous androgen and the interplay with endogenous female 
hormones in the breast are poorly understood.  In this study we document the histopathologic findings in 
transgender female-to-male mastectomies (FTMM) and also investigate the effects of TT on estrogen receptors 
(ER) and androgen receptors (AR) in the breast tissue. 
Design: After IRB approval, 66 cases of FTMM were retrieved from the department files between the period of 
10.26.17 to 5.5.20.  All patients had TT prior to FTMM. A control group of age matched 66 women who underwent 
reduction mastectomies (RM) were also retrieved. Patient demographics and duration of TT was 
recorded. Pathology slides were reviewed. The histologic findings and number of sections submitted were 
recorded.  In addition immunohistochemistry for AR and ER was performed in 15 cases, 5 each of RM without TT 
(group 1), FTMM with 12 months TT (group 2) and FTMM with greater than 60 months TT (group 3). The overall 
positivity rate and receptor intensity were assessed.   
 
 
 
 
89 
Results: In comparison to RM, FTMM revealed dense fibrotic stroma, lobular atrophy, thickened lobular basement 
membranes, and gynecomastoid changes (Fig. 1). Findings were more marked in group 3. Incidence of atypia or 
cancer was much lower in the FTMM, in spite of a greater number of sections (2.5x) being examined (Table1).   
ER and AR expression were similar in groups 1 and 2 but increased expression was noted in group 3 (Fig. 2). In 
addition stromal cells in groups 2 and 3 were noted to stain positive for AR (Fig. 2).

2. Incidence of atypia/carcinoma is very low. Routine examination of a large number of sections is not required.

3. ER and AR are expressed more strongly in lobular epithelium in patients on prolonged TT. AR positivity is also 
noted in stromal cells in patients on TT. We postulate that TT induces stromal fibrosis in the breast leading to 
lobular atrophy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Background: Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) lymph node negative (LN-) Invasive Breast Cancer (IBC) is the 
most common subtype of IBC in the United States. Given the significant side effects of adjuvant chemotherapy, it is 
critical to identify ER+ & LN- breast cancer patients at a lower risk of recurrence, who are unlikely to benefit from 
chemotherapy. Complying with the modified Bloom–Richardson grading scheme, we computationally extracted 
quantitative histomorphometric features relating to nuclear morphology, mitotic counts, and tubule formation, and 
associated them with recurrence-free survival (RFS) in ER+ & LN- IBC.  
Design: H&E-stained whole slide images from a cohort of 116 patients (22 recurrences), diagnosed with early-
stage ER+ & LN- IBC, and treated at University Hospital Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, were 
retrospectively collected and used as training set D1. All censored patients without recurrence have at least ten-
year follow-up. 84 ER+ & LN- breast cancer patients (21 recurrences) treated at Indian Tata Memorial Hospital, 
Mumbai, India constituted an independent testing set D2 (see Table 1). Three different deep learning models were 
respectively employed to detect nuclei, mitosis, and tubules. Subsequently, features relating to nuclear morphology 
(e.g. spatial distribution, shape, texture, orientation entropy), mitotic features (e.g. mitosis hotspot, mitotic rates), 
and tubule formation (e.g. tubular nuclei distribution, tubule rate entropy) were computationally extracted for each 
individual patient. A lasso regularized Cox regression model (named MNMT) was employed to identify the 12 (~10% 
of patient number in D1) most predictive features of RFS and generate a continuous risk score. The optimal risk 
threshold was identified on D1 to dichotomize risk scores into high vs. low risk categories. MNMT was subsequently 
validated on D2 and a Kaplan-Meier Survival analysis was performed. 
Results: The top 12 features employed by MNMT included nuclei morphology, tubule formation, and mitosis 
counts. Patients identified by MNMT as high risk had significantly worse prognosis in terms of RFS with a Hazard 
Ratio of 6.16 (p=9.91e-07, 95% CI=1.99~19.1) in D1 (Figure 1) and HR=3.2 (p=0.00464, 95% CI=1.14~8.95) in D2 
(Figure 2) from the log-rank test, respectively.

Background: Nodular fasciitis (NF) is a benign self-limited myofibroblastic neoplasm with the potential to mimic 
malignancy owing to its rapid growth, cellularity and mitotic activity. Most commonly NF occurs in the subcutaneous 
tissue of the extremities, trunk, and head and neck; there are only rare reports of involvement of mammary tissue. 
Design: As the largest individual series to date, 12 cases of NF involving the breast were collected. Each case was 
reviewed by at least 2 soft tissue pathologists, and the clinicopathologic features were recorded. Targeted RNA 
sequencing-based fusion analysis was performed on 11 cases. 
Results:  All patients were female, with median age at diagnosis of 35 years (range 15-61). The tumors ranged in 
size from 0.4 to 5.8 cm (median 0.9). Three patients presented with skin retraction, and two occurred near the 
axilla. One patient reported preceding trauma, and another occurred during pregnancy. All tumors showed 
characteristic histologic features of NF, including bland myofibroblastic spindle cells, variably myxoid stroma and 
extravasated erythrocytes. Mitotic figures ranged from 1 to 12 per 10 high-power fields (median 3). Focal infiltration 
into adipose tissue was common (n=10); in 4 cases, the tumor abutted (n=2) or infiltrated (n=2) breast epithelium. 
Immunohistochemically, lesional cells expressed SMA (10/10) and were negative for pan-cytokeratin (0/8), p63 
(0/8), desmin (0/9), CD34 (0/10), S100 (0/9) and nuclear ß-catenin (0/5). RNA fusion analysis on 11 cases 
revealed USP6 rearrangements in 7, including the canonical MYH9-USP6 in 3 cases. Three novel gene fusions 
were identified, including NACA-USP6, SLFN11-USP6 and LDHA-USP6. Another case harbored a previously 
reported rare alternative fusion, CTNNB1-USP6. All fusions juxtaposed the 5’ partner’s promoter with the entire 
coding sequence of USP6. USP6 rearrangement was confirmed by FISH in the 12th case. Outcome data were 
available for 9 patients, with a median duration of 60 months (range 8 to 108). Seven patients underwent surgical 
excision, and 2 patients received no treatment after diagnosis on core biopsy. No patient developed a recurrence, 
and no tumors metastasized.  
Conclusions: Albeit uncommon, NF should be considered in the differential diagnosis of breast spindle cell 
lesions. A broad immunohistochemical panel may be required to rule out histologic mimics, including metaplastic 
carcinoma. Detection of USP6 rearrangement would support the diagnosis of NF, which has potential therapeutic 
implications.

Does HER2 Affect CDK4/6 Pathway Activity in Breast Cancer? 
Xiaoyan Cui1, William Sinclair2

OH 
Disclosures: Xiaoyan Cui: None; William Sinclair: None 
Background: Cyclin D1-CDK4/6-pRb is the pathway to promote progression of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase 
that resulting in cell proliferation. CDK4/6 inhibitors bind to CDK4/6 thus prevent cancer progression. Clinically, they 
have proven to be beneficial for ER+ breast cancer, especially when combined with anti-estrogen therapies. The 
relationship of HER2 and cyclin D1-CDK4/6-pRb pathway has not been well characterized. In this study, 
phosphorylated Rb (pRb) was used as an index for CDK4/6 activation and its expression to HER2 expression as 
well as gene copy number were studied. 
Design: 130 cases of breast biopsies with invasive carcinoma were collected, including 77 cases of HER2+ (39 
cases of ER+PR±HER2+ and 38 cases of ER-PR-HER2+) and 53 cases of HER2- (ER-PR-HER2-). Immunostain 
 
 
 
 
93 
of pRb was performed and quantified by H-score (intensity x percentage of positive cells), with the intensity scored 
as 0, 1, 2 and 3 (no stain, weak, moderate and strong, respectively). 
Results: For all cases, the H-score ranges from 3 to 270 (Table 1). The average H-score for the ER-PR-HER2-, 
ER-PR-HER2+, and ER+PR±HER2+ groups was 61.5 ±18.1, 115.82 ± 25.0, and 93.1 ±22.2, respectively. For all 
HER2+ cases, the average score was 104.5 ± 16.7, which is significantly higher than HER2- cases (p=0.001). 
There is no significant difference between the two HER2+ subgroups (Figure 1). When evaluating the HER2 gene 
copy numbers with their corresponding H-scores, there was a trend of positive correlation, i.e. higher HER2 copy 
number with higher H-score, although not statistically significant (r=0.2, p=0.09) (Figure 2). 
 
Figure 1 - 84 
 
Figure 2 - 84 
 
 
 
 
 
94 
Conclusions: The significant higher levels of pRb expression in HER2+ group suggests that increased HER2 
expression may lead to CDK4/6 pathway activation. The trend of positive correlation between HER2 gene copy 
number and pRb expression provides further evidence. This indicates the potential effects of CDK4/6 inhibitors in 
treating HER2+ breast cancer as well as the possible synergistic effects of HER2-targeted therapy and CDK4/6 
inhibitors. Future study of pRb expression in relation to response to CDK4/6 inhibitors may be important to confirm 
if pRb can be used as a predicative biomarker to CDK4/6 inhibitors treatment. Of interest, few ER-PR-HER2- cases 
also have higher H-scores (7.5%, H-score> 200). If confirmed, these patients may also respond to CDK4/6 
inhibitors.

Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is commonly used to treat patients with high risk or locally 
advanced breast cancer. Despite advances in treatment, predicting how a patient will respond to NAC remains a 
significant clinical challenge. While some patients experience a pathological complete response (defined as 
complete eradication of tumour), many will have residual disease, which can be quantified using the residual cancer 
burden (RCB) index. RCB index has also been shown to predict long-term survival after NAC in all molecular 
subtypes of breast cancer. The objective of this study was to determine if tumour nuclear features in pre-treatment 
biopsies were associated with RCB index after NAC. 
Design: From a retrospective cohort of breast cancer patients, H&E-stained breast core biopsies were selected 
from 36 patients who had residual disease after NAC. Multiple deep convolutional neural networks were developed 
to automate tumor bed detection and nuclear segmentation. Nuclear count and morphological nuclear features 
including nuclear area and circularity were computed. Image-based first and second-order features including mean 
pixel intensity and grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features were determined. 
Results: The cohort consisted of ER-positive tumours (n = 26) and ER-negative tumours (n = 10). RCB index 
ranged from 0.64 to 3.88 (RCB Class 1: n = 11, RCB Class II: n = 18, RCB Class III: n = 7). Clinicopathological 
variables including age, menopausal status, tumour size/extent, lymph node involvement, histologic grade, and 
HER2 status were not associated with the RCB index.  For ER-positive tumours, nuclear area was strongly and 
inversely correlated with the RCB index (R = - 0.57, R2 = 0.33, p = 0.002). Nuclear count, circularity, intensity and 
GLCM texture features were not significantly associated with RCB index. Among ER-negative tumours, none of the 
AI-determined nuclear features, including nuclear area, were associated with the RCB index. 
Conclusions: Tumour nuclear area in pre-treatment biopsies is inversely associated with the RCB index in ER-
positive breast cancer. Assessment of nuclear features using AI is a promising tool for predicting the response to 
NAC in order to better guide clinical decision-making.

Background: The use of the RANK-L-inhibitor denosumab in the adjuvant setting for early-stage breast cancer 
remains uncertain. Although RANK expression has been observed in poorly differentiated and triple negative breast 
carcinoma (TNBC), the roles of RANK and RANK-L in TNBC have been largely unexplored. We assessed the 
possible associations between RANK/RANK-L upregulation in TNBC and overall patient survival (OS). 
Design: RANK and RANK-L expression by IHC was assessed in 71 primary breast carcinomas using a tissue 
microarray (TMA) enriched for TNBC (n=57). Histologic subtypes of TNBCs included IDC (non-specific type NST, 
n=45), metaplastic breast carcinoma (adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC), n=4; MBC with matrix production, n=1), 
and carcinoma with medullary features (CMF, n=7). For comparison we assessed expression in 14 cases of 
Luminal A or B IDC-NST. RANK and RANK-L were evaluated by H-score (score range=0-300). RANK-L expression 
was not detected in tumor cells from any TNBC case; faint RANK-L expression could be seen in the blood vessels 
only. OS rate was assessed by Kaplan-Meier test; median follow-up time was 17.5 years. 
Results: RANK expression was detected in 53 of 57 (93%) TNBC cases (H avg: 108, range: 0-270) and was 
significantly higher than that seen in Luminal A/B Ca (detected in 10/14, 72%, H avg. 46, range: 0-100; p<.01). 
RANK expression was significantly higher in poorly-differentiated (PD) TNBC (n=41, H avg: 126, range: 0-270) 
compared to TNBC with moderately-differentiated (MD) histology (n=16, H avg: 62, range: 0-220; p<.01). TNBC 
displaying high RANK expression (H>100, n=26; H avg 188) had a significantly better overall survival compared to 
those displaying low RANK (H≤100, n=31; H avg 41); patients with RANK-hi TNBC had an undefined median OS 
with median follow-up of 17 years whereas patients with RANK-low TNBC had a median OS of 10.3 years 
(p=.033)(Figure 1). In special TNBC histologic subtypes, RANK expression was high in all cases of ASC (H avg 
173, range 120-220, n=4) and CMF (H avg 210, range 170-270, n=7). Patients with RANK-hi ASC and RANK-hi 
CMF had favorable outcomes, with no disease recurrences and only one patient death in a median follow-up time 
of 16.3 years (all patients presented with Stage I or II disease). 
Figure 1 - 86 
 
Conclusions: Our results suggest that RANK is significantly upregulated in PD-TNBC relative to MD-TNBC, 
implying a biological role for RANK in the progression of disease. Robust RANK expression was seen in special 
types of TNBCs that had favorable outcomes.

Immunotherapy

Bullock: None; Anne Mills: None 
Background: Immune modulating drugs such as PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors have promise in a subset of 
breast cancers, particularly PD-L1-positive triple-negative breast carcinomas (TNBC). However, many PD-L1-
positive tumors fail to respond, and additional biomarkers of immunotherapeutic vulnerability are needed. Drugs 
that enhance the adaptive immune response rely on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I for tumor 
antigen presentation, and its loss has been described in breast cancer.  We herein investigate MHC class I 
expression across a range of breast carcinomas and compare to PD-L1 status. 
Design: 117 invasive primary breast carcinomas with a range of histologic subtypes were evaluated on tissue 
microarrays. Immunohistochemical expression of MHC Class I (clone: EMR8-5) was scored as intact, subclonal 
loss, or diffuse loss based on the degree of membranous tumoral expression.  Results were compared to PD-L1 
expression (clone: SP142) using the FDA-approved tumor-infiltrating immune score. 
Results: 61% (71/117) of breast cancers demonstrated subclonal or diffuse MHC class I loss, including 49% 
(23/47) of PD-L1-positive cases and 59% (19/32) of TNBC (Fig 1). Among TNBC, diffuse loss was limited to the 
apocrine subtype. Diffuse loss was significantly more common in non-TNBC than non-apocrine TNBC [19% (16/85) 
vs. 0% (0/23)], while subclonal loss was slightly higher in non-apocrine TNBC than non-TNBC [52% (12/23) vs. 
42% (36/85)]. 
Figure 1 - 87 
 
Conclusions: MHC class I loss is common in breast cancers, including nearly half of PD-L1-positive cases, and 
represents a putative mechanism of immunotherapeutic resistance in this setting.  Diffuse loss is more common in 
immunologically “cold” tumors like non-TNBC and apocrine TNBC, whereas conventional TNBC—which are 
typically lymphocyte-enriched—most often show subclonal loss.  This suggests that the pattern of MHC class I loss 
 
 
 
 
97 
may have significance, with subclonal loss suggesting adaptive evasion of the host immune response and complete 
loss perhaps indicating a constitutive defect unrelated to the immune microenvironment.  Studies evaluating the 
relationship between MHC class I loss pattern and resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors will be of 
interest.

Background:  Although it is well established that presence of CD8 positive cells and high CD8/Foxp 3 ratio in 
invasive carcinoma are associated with better clinical outcome, the prognostic significance of immune infiltrates in 
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is not well established. The goals of the study are (1) to develop standardized 
approach to evaluate CD8 and Foxp3 infiltrates to analyze tumor microenvironment in DCIS, and (2) determine the 
density of CD8 and Foxp3 infiltrates and CD8/Foxp3 ratio in  DCIS.   
Design: After institutional review board approval, the tissue microarrays (TMAs) of 107 DCIS were analyzed. TMAs 
were prepared form formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) resection specimens. DCIS TMAs associated with 
invasive carcinoma were excluded. Grade, ER, Her2 and Ki67 status were determined by a pathologist according 
to standard clinical guidelines.  Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect CD8  and Foxp3 positive cells in 
DCIS.  The Aperio Image Scope software was used to eliminate inter- and intraobserver variation and provide a 
standardized reproducible approach to evaluate tumor immune microenvironment.  TMAs were scanned and 
membrane algorithm v9 was used to detect CD8 positive cells, and nuclear algorithm v9 was used to detect Foxp3 
positive cells. Both intraepithelial and stromal CD8 and Foxp3 positive cells were counted. DCIS that are CD8 
infiltrate positive were designated as “hot” tumors whereas DCIS not associated with CD8 infiltrate were designated 
as “cold” tumors. 
Results: 66% of ER-positive, 62% of Her2 positive, and 78.5% of ER/Her2 negative DCIS contained CD8 positive 
cells (“hot” tumors). There was no significant difference in density of CD8 infiltrate between the groups (p=0.98).  Ki 
67 proliferative index was similar in “hot” and “cold” DCIS. Interestingly, density of CD8 infiltrates in “hot” DCIS was 
not significantly different in low vs high grade DCIS. There was no significant difference in density of Foxp3 infiltrate 
between the all three DCIS subsets (p=0.86).  However, much higher proportion of Her 2 positive DCIS was 
associated with Foxp3 cells in comparison with ER-positive and ER/Her2-negative (58.2 vs 38.2 and 28% 
respectively).  Remarkably, CD8/Foxp3 ratio was significantly higher in a subset of Her2 positive DCIS in 
comparison with ER-positive and ER/Her2 negative subsets (p<0.05). 
Conclusions: The data show that DCIS can be classified as several distinct subsets based on presence of CD8 
and Foxp3 cells. ER positive, Her2 positive and ER/Her2 negative DCIS can be divided in “hot” and “cold” subsets. 
The percentage of “hot” tumors was comparable between the groups with similar density of CD8 infiltrate. However, 
Her2 positive DCIS were more frequently associated with Foxp3 infiltrate and higher CD8/Foxp3 ratio.  Further 
studies to correlate clinical outcomes in patients with DCIS based on presence of CD8 and Foxp3 infiltrate and 
CD8/Foxp3 ratio are needed.

Background: CDH1 gene encoding E-cadherin, an epithelial cell adhesion molecule, is frequently mutated in 
lobular carcinomas of the breast. Lack of immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of E-cadherin protein may be 
used to differentiate lobular and ductal carcinomas, while loss of membranous staining and/or cytoplasmic 
relocalization of other members of the E-cadherin adhesion complex, such as p120-catenin, α- or β-catenin, have 
also been described as markers of lobular differentiation. We set out to evaluate the utility of E-cadherin and β-
catenin IHC in breast carcinomas with mixed ductal and lobular features (CMDL). 
Design: We retrospectively identified patients diagnosed with CMDL, including tubulolobular carcinoma (TLC), at 
our institution between 2000 and 2020. Microscopic slides were reviewed and IHC studies for E-cadherin and β-
catenin were performed in all cases. For both proteins, staining was interpreted as intact (membranous 
expression), aberrant (absent or markedly reduced expression) or mixed (distinct areas of intact and aberrant 
expression). Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS 26.0. 
Results: A total of 71 tumors were identified and reclassified based on morphology, including 31 CMDLs, 16 
invasive ductal carcinomas of no special type (IDC), 21 invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC; 14 classic, 3 solid, 2 
alveolar, 2 pleomorphic) and 3 TLCs. The difference between E-cadherin and β-catenin expression was statistically 
significant (p<0.0001). In 65/71 tumors (91.5%), E-cadherin and β-catenin demonstrated identical staining patterns, 
including 27 with intact expression, 19 with mixed expression and 19 with aberrant expression. Of the 6 tumors with 
discordant expression, 3 were morphologically more in keeping with ILC but showed intact E-cadherin and 
aberrant β-catenin staining (classified as ILC), 2 CMDLs had aberrant E-cadherin and mixed β-catenin expression 
(reclassified as true mixed carcinoma (MC) with ductal and lobular components), while 1 CMDL had intact E-
cadherin but mixed β-catenin expression (reclassified as MC). Overall, based on E-cadherin and β-catenin staining 
patterns the initial morphologic diagnoses of CMDL were changed to MC in 22 tumors, IDC in 8 tumors and ILC in 1 
tumor (Table 1).

Conclusions: Expression of E-cadherin by IHC is similar to that of β-catenin in the majority of breast carcinomas. 
However, β-catenin staining may be useful in the differential diagnosis of morphologically ambiguous cases of ILC 
and CMDL.

Non-Mammary Metastases to Breast Parenchyma: A Clinicopathologic Study from a Large 
Academic Institution

Disclosures: Toshi Ghosh: None; Malvika Solanki: None 
Background: Metastatic disease to the breast, including all metastasis except from within breast (non-mammary 
breast metastasis, NMBM) poses a unique challenge to patient care. Although rare, they have a significant impact 
on patient treatment and prognosis. This study evaluates a large cohort of patients with NMBM and adds 
clinicopathologic and long-term follow-up data to the limited literature. 
Design: We identified 89 patients with a pathologic diagnosis of NMBM between 1992 and 2020. Histologic slides 
were reviewed by two pathologists. Clinicopathologic characteristics and follow-up data were recorded. We 
excluded 31 patients with breast skin, subcutaneous tissue, or intramammary lymph node metastasis, as they did 
not involve the breast parenchyma. In the remaining 58 patients (54 F, 4 M) included in our study, parenchymal 
involvement was confirmed by histopathology or imaging in 53 patients, while 5 patients had cytology samples. 
Results: The median age at diagnosis of NMBM was 57 years (range, 33-83 years). The most common metastatic 
tumor was carcinoma (59%: mostly lung and gastrointestinal (GI), followed by gynecologic, renal, thyroid, thymic, 
prostate, and salivary gland). This was followed by neuroendocrine tumor/NET (21%: mostly GI), melanoma (17%: 
mostly cutaneous), and sarcoma (3%: mostly abdominal and uterine leiomyosarcoma). The diagnoses were 
confirmed by immunohistochemistry in 71% of cases. 60% of NMBM were unifocal, and the median size of the 
metastatic focus was 16 mm (range, 4-65 mm). Most presented as a palpable mass (47%) or were non-palpable 
and identified on imaging (40%). NMBM was the first presentation of metastasis in 9% of patients, while it was 
concurrent with other organ metastases in 19% of patients. Median time to NMBM was 3.1 years (range, 0 days-
22.7 years). Median follow-up interval from the date of NMBM to last follow-up was 1.2 years (range, 8 days-13.9 
years). Of the patients deceased at last follow-up (72%), median survival since diagnosis of NMBM was 1.1 years 
(range, 22 days-13 years). 
Conclusions: In our cohort of patients with NMBM, the most common tumor type was metastatic carcinoma, 
followed by metastatic NET, and then melanoma. Distinction of NMBM from primary breast carcinoma can be 
challenging, especially when NMBM is the initial presentation or has unifocal metastasis. In our study, 28% of 
patients presented with NMBM as their first presentation with metastatic disease. Careful morphologic assessment, 
immunohistochemistry, and clinicoradiologic correlation can be very helpful to identify NMBM and provide optimal 
patient care.

Background: Stromal collagen is an important structural factor in breast cancer. However, its specific role is not 
fully understood. The collagen fibers surrounding the tumor may act as a barrier that prevents cancer cell migration. 
Their alignment may also give some insight into which tumors are more likely to metastasize and therefore, be 
treated more aggressively. The aim of this study was to assess the association between collagen fiber organization 
using image analysis and compare these findings with commonly used clinicopathologic findings. 
Design: After IRB approval, all newly diagnosed ER+/PR +/HER2- breast cancer patients with available Oncotype 
Dx recurrence scores (ODX-RS) between January 2008 and June 2018 were included. The original pathology 
reports were reviewed, and chart review was performed for information regarding outcome events. Other 
information obtained included demographic data, tumor size, grade, histologic subtype, and ER, PR, and HER2 
status and the Nottingham scores were documented. The available slides were scanned, and an algorithm was 
applied to automatically detect the orientation of the collagen fibers and assess the disorder degree of the fiber 
orientations in the tumor-associated stroma. The patients were classified as having organized and disorganized 
collagen around tumor cells. Statistical tests include a chi-squared test and Kaplan Meier survival curves. A p-value 
of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.  
Results: The cohort consisted of 493 cases. The mean age was 60.9 (range: 25-80). The median follow-up was 45 
months. Table 1 demonstrates the demographic data. Disorganized collagen was significantly associated with 
higher tumor grade, increasing nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic count, associated high grade ductal carcinoma in 
situ (DCIS), invasive ductal subtype, and ODX-RS using TAILORx cutoffs. There were 29 outcome events during 
the study period: 17 locoregional recurrences, 11 distant recurrences and 1 breast cancer related deaths. Most of 
the locoregional and distant metastasis and the breast cancer-related deaths had disorganized collagen fiber 
orientation. There was no significant difference between overall survival, locoregional or distant recurrence-free 
survival with disorganized and organized collagen (Figure 1 and 2).

Background: Most invasive breast cancer cases are early-stage, hormone receptor positive, HER-2 negative and 
lymph node-negative. Oncotype (ODX) assists clinicians in chemotherapy recommendations based on defined 
recurrence scores (RS). Literature is limited regarding the outcome of this subset of patients who refuse 
chemotherapy based on ODX-RS. The aim of this study is to assess the outcome of patients who were offered 
adjuvant therapy and refuse. 
Design: All newly diagnosed ER/PR+, HER2 negative, lymph node negative breast cancer patients with available 
ODX-RS from 2008-2018 were included. The original pathology reports were reviewed and chart review was 
performed to obtain demographic data, document treatment plans and assess follow-up.  
Results: There were 596 patients in our cohort. Median age was 61 years (range: 25-82). Median follow up was 49 
months (mean: 59 months). There were 31 patients who were offered chemotherapy and refused (Table 1). Only 2 
patients developed a locoregional and/or distant recurrences after a median follow up of 49 months, one of which 
also refused hormonal therapy. Most were older and approximately half were high risk by TAILORx cutoffs. A 
multinominal stepwise regression analysis demonstrated that statistically significant predictors associated with the 
 
 
 
 
103 
development of a locoregional recurrence were age ≤50 (p=0.03), not receiving hormonal therapy (p=0.007) and 
being offered chemotherapy and refusing (p= 0.013). Significant predictors of the development of a distant 
recurrence were age ≤50 (p=0.014), associated DCIS with high nuclear grade (p=0.008) and grade 3 tumors 
(p=0.032). There was no significant difference in disease-free survival between patients who were offered 
chemotherapy and those who were offered and refused (Figure 1).

Background: The NTRK (Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase) gene family encodes three tropomyosin-related 
kinase (TRK) receptors (NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3). NRTK-R have been associated with secretory MBC, but have 
not been studied in non-secretory MBC. 
Design: Using an FDA-approved hybrid capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) assay 
(FoundationOneCDx), a series of 14,481 MBC were sequenced to evaluate all classes of genomic alterations (GA). 
 
 
 
 
105 
Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was determined on 0.8 Mbp of sequenced DNA and microsatellite instability (MSI) 
was determined on 95 loci. PD-L1 expression was determined by IHC (Ventana Sp142) using inflammatory cell 
staining. 
Results: 22 (0.2%) MBC featured NTRK-R involving 10 NTRK1, 0 NTRK2 and 12 NTRK3. None of the NTRK1-
R  were canonical activating fusions. 4 (33%) of the 12 NTRK3-R cases featured known NTRK activating fusions 
with the transcription factor ETV6.  These occurred in 2 metastatic secretory carcinomas, 1 metaplastic carcinoma 
and 1 pure high grade ductal carcinoma. The non-canonical NTRK-R rearrangements observed in our study include 
reciprocal fusions, events where the frame cannot be determined, or a fusion partner with an oligomerization 
domain was not found; these events may be indicative of an activating rearrangement event, such as a fusion; 
however, there is uncertainty whether these may be activating in all cases. 6/8 (75%) NTRK1-R and 5/7 
(71%) NTRK3-R cases were ER+. 4 (18%) of 22 NTRK-R cases featured co-occurring ERBB2 amplification, 
predominantly associated with NTRK3-R (27% of NTRK3-R, 17% of NTRK1-R). Among NTRK3:ETV6 cases 1 
(25%) featured a co-occurring ERBB2 amplification and 3 (75%) were ER+.  NTRK1-R were found exclusively 
(100%) in non-secretory MB including 1 inflammatory and 1 metaplastic carcinoma. Clinically significant co-altered 
genes included ESR1 and PIK3CA at 17%, PTEN at 13%, BRAF, NF1, FGFR3 all at 8% and BRCA2 at 4% 
(no BRCA1 GA) in the NTRK1-R tumors and PIK3CA at 42%, PTEN and ESR1 at 17%, FGFR1 at 8% 
and BRCA1/2 at 0% in the NTRK3-R tumors. The median TMB was 2.5 mut/Mb for NTRK1-R and 1.3 mut/Mb 
for NTRK3-R cases. All cases were MSI stable and had no positive PD-L1 expression. 
Conclusions: NTRK-R can occur in secretory, metaplastic and typical ductal MBC. NTRK1-R cases seen in this 
cohort do not involve known transcription factors and thus their responsiveness to NTRK targeted therapy needs 
further clinical validation . One-third of NTRK3-R involve fusions with the ETV6 transcription factor and are 
predominantly, but not exclusively found in secretory carcinomas.  The high co-occurrence rate of ERBB2 
amplification with NTRK-R in MBC reinforces the utility of comprehensive genomic profiling to ensure detection of 
all relevant therapeutic targets.  Given the widely known responsiveness of NTRK-R to anti-NTRK-R TKI drugs, 
further study on NTRK-R in MBC appears warranted.

The 21-Gene Recurrence Score (RS) in Special Histologic Subtypes of Breast Cancer: A 
Population-Based Study 
H. Evin Gulbahce, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 
Disclosures: H. Evin Gulbahce: None 
Background: Although the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of RS testing in special types 
of breast cancer (BC)  the data for the RS were derived from invasive ductal carcinoma- no special type and a 
small proportion of lobular cancers. The purpose of this study is to determine association of histologic types (HT) 
and RS, specifically high-risk RS, the group that needs systemic therapy, and HT as predictor of BC specific death. 
Design: We used RS from Genomic Health linked to Surveillance Epidemiology End Result (SEER) registry of BC 
cases diagnosed 2004-2015. Demographic and clinicopathological information, and survival info were 
obtained.  Women with ER+, HER2-, T1-T3 tumors were included. Multivariable logistic regression was used to 
evaluate association between HT and high-risk RS. Relationship between HT and low-, intermediate-, and high-risk 
RS were compared with chi-squared probability test.  Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted and compared using log-
rank test.  
Results: 110,318 patients had RS testing. 23,220(21%) had low; 70,822(62.2%) intermediate; 16,276(14.6%) high 
RS. 80,476(73%) was ductal, 12,713(11.5%) lobular, 12,449(11.3%) mixed, 2,151(2%) mucinous, 610(0.6%) 
tubular 382(0.4%) micropapillary, 365(0.3%) salivary type, 208(0.2%) papillary, 49(0.04%) medullary,26(0.02%) 
metaplastic, 26(0.02%) neuroendocrine, 863(0.8%) unknown type BC. The distribution of low-, intermediate- , high-
risk RS was significantly different between HT. Significantly higher percentages of high-risk RS were identified in 
patients with ductal, medullary, and metaplastic types (p < 0.001). Lobular, tubular, mucinous, papillary types were 
significantly less likely to have high-risk RS. The odds of having high-risk was lower for lobular, mixed, mucinous, 
tubular and micropapillary types after multivariable adjustment for age, grade, PR status (p<0.05). Low number of 
medullary and metaplastic carcinomas that were ER+ had higher odds of having high-risk RS. In patients with ≤2cm 
 
 
 
 
106 
(T1) and >2cm (T2) tumors when ductal, lobular, mixed and other types combined together were compared, the 
survival was significantly different.

Conclusions: The studies on RS of special types of breast cancer has been limited and was addressed only in 
small studies until now.  This is the largest, population based study of RS in HT that showed high-risk RS are 
identified in traditionally good prognostic subtypes. Some special subtypes, including micropapillary carcinoma, 
have lower odds of high-risk RS even after adjusting for grade, PR status and age

Evaluating the Significance of Atypical and Malignant Breast Lesions Arising in 
Fibroadenoma of the Breast 
Kayla Hackman1, Iskender Genco1, Sabina Hajiyeva1 
1Northwell Health Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, NY 
Disclosures: Kayla Hackman: None; Iskender Genco: None; Sabina Hajiyeva: None 
Background: While fibroadenomas (FAs) are the most common benign neoplasm of the breast, little data exists 
about clinical characteristics and prognostic value of FAs found to be directly associated with atypical and 
malignant lesions. Cases of FA diagnosed within our health system were reviewed to establish the exact clinical 
significance of these unique lesions.  
 
 
 
 
107 
Design: All FA cases diagnosed on core needle biopsy (CNB) between 2013 and 2020 within our department were 
screened to identify those with atypical and malignant lesions {(atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH), lobular 
carcinoma in situ (LCIS), atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), flat epithelial atypia (FEA), ductal carcinoma in situ 
(DCIS), invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC)} arising in FA. Cases with atypical or 
malignant lesions outside of FA on the same CNB were excluded. The relationship between CNB and excisional 
findings for each case were reviewed. 
Results: A total of 1466 cases of FA diagnosed on CNB were identified. Among these, 17 cases showed atypical 
and/or malignant lesions arising in FA. The median age of patients at diagnosis was 53 years (range, 40-68 years). 
Of those 17 cases, nine were LCIS, two were LCIS+ILC, one was LCIS+DCIS, two were ADH, two were DCIS, and 
one case was DCIS+IDC. Each of these cases had a subsequent excisional specimen within our system. For LCIS, 
the excision showed LCIS in four cases, ADH in two cases, and LCIS+DCIS, LCIS+ILC, and only FA in one case 
each. For ADH, one showed DCIS and the other showed only FA. For DCIS, DCIS and DCIS+IDC were found on 
one case each upon excision. Lastly, for the LCIS+ILC, LCIS+DCIS and DCIS+IDC cases, both the biopsy and 
excision showed the same lesions. 
Conclusions: There is a low percentage of FA harboring atypia or carcinoma; here we report the clinicopathologic 
features of 17 cases of atypia and carcinomas arising within FAs of the breast diagnosed on CNB and the findings 
on the subsequent excision. The presentation and gross characteristics of these tumors are indistinguishable from 
those of uncomplicated FAs. Lastly, 4 of 17 (24%) cases were upgraded upon excision, suggesting that complete 
excision of these lesions may be the recommended method of clinical management.

Disclosures: Rachel Han: None; Sharon Nofech-Mozes: None; Fang-I Lu: None; Anna Plotkin: None; Wedad 
Hanna: None; Elzbieta Slodkowska: None 
Background: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents a heterogenous group of breast carcinomas which 
lack expression of ER/PR and overexpression of HER2. ER/PR/HER2 negative metastases often present a 
diagnostic challenge as their distinction from TNBC has significant prognostic and therapeutic implications. The 
objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of ‘tissue specific’ IHC markers (Figure 1) on a large cohort of 
TNBC.  
Design: Sections from tissue microarrays composed of 273 TNBC in triplicate 1mm cores were immunostained 
with a panel of 20 markers (2 different clones for 3 of them). Staining intensity was scored as 0, 1, 2, or 3 (0=no 
staining, 1=weak, 2=moderate, 3=strong). The percentage of positively stained tumour cells was assessed as a 
proportion of total tumour, and scored as 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 (0=<1%, 1=1-10%, 2=10-24%, 3=25-49%, 4=≥50%). 
Percentage and intensity scores were added using a modified Allred method; combined scores ≥2 were considered 
positive with the exception of mammaglobin, where any cytoplasmic staining was considered positive. BAP1 and 
SMAD4 were scored as retained vs. lost (no staining in tumor). Histologic tumour types were assigned according to 
WHO classification. 
Results: Expression of all IHC markers is summarized in Table 1. Pankeratin was expressed in all TNBC but 4 
metaplastic carcinomas (MC). CK7 was expressed in all but 11 cases, of which 7 were MC. GATA3 was expressed 
in 76% while mammaglobin was expressed in 43% of tumors (the latter often in single cells only). Among 198 
TNBC-NOS, 5 (2%) lacked expression of SOX10, GATA3 and mammaglobin; of these, all were positive for CK7. 
Almost all TNBC showed no expression of Melan-A, Napsin A, PAX8 (SP348), SATB2 (EP281), TTF1, and had 
retained SMAD4.

Conclusions: Expression of SOX10, GATA3 and/or mammaglobin is present in 98% of TNBC-NOS. Expression of 
Melan-A, Napsin A, PAX8 (SP348), SATB2 (EP281), TTF1 (8G7G3/1), and/or loss of SMAD4 is highly specific for 
non-mammary origin. CDX2, NKX3.1 and WT1 can be variably expressed in TNBC and may lead to diagnostic 
challenges in the distinction of site of origin. The choice of PAX8, SATB2 and TTF1 clone can greatly help in 
delineating site of origin.

Background: Breast pathology includes a spectrum of benign, atypical/high risk, preinvasive, and invasive lesions. 
Diagnoses rendered on biopsies have a relative high discordance rate in interpretation, particularly without expert 
review. Detection and distinct classification of these lesions are required for appropriate patient management. Due 
to routine screening, breast specimens are common and high volume in pathology. Breast resection specimens 
may also be time consuming due to the number of glass slides and overall tissue area for histopathologic review. 
Machine learning has been shown to improve efficiency and accuracy of cancer detection in a variety of tissue 
types. Here, we hypothesized that such an algorithm can be trained to detect and subclassify clinically meaningful 
lesions in breast pathology with the potential to provide increased efficiency and accuracy to the histologic 
examination of slides of breast tissue. 
Design: De-identified glass slides were scanned on Leica AT2 whole slide scanners (0.5 µm/pixel) from 
our institutional database were retrieved. Diagnoses were available from the pathology report. Using a machine 
learning architecture of multiple instance learning, an SE-ResNet50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was 
trained using the same approach described in Campanella et al. (2019). Each input to the network consisted of 
whole slide images (WSIs). Classification performance for invasive carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 
lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), and atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) 
were determined. A split-sample testing and validation study design was employed for the development of the 
classifier. 
Results: A dataset of 9,751 anatomical specimens (biopsy, 6,289; excision, 3,462) comprising 40,637 slides were 
used to train the CNN. The system was validated on WSI generated from 3,742 breast specimens (biopsy, 2,250; 
excision, 1,492) comprising 13,601 digital slides that were not included in the training of the CNN model. Results 
shows area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) classification of invasive carcinoma, 
DCIS, LCIS, ALH, and ADH as 0.98, 0.98, 0.97, 0.95, and 0.92, respectively. [Figure 1].

Background: There is practice heterogeneity regarding optimal management of classical type lobular carcinoma 
in-situ (CLCIS) when diagnosed on core need biopsy (CNB). Now with recognition of LCIS variants, florid (FLCIS) 
and pleomorphic (PLCIS) types, the management has become even more complicated. The primary aim of this 
study was to determine the upstage rates of CLCIS, FLCIS and PLCIS when diagnosed on CNB. The secondary 
goal was to determine outcome of cases that are not upstaged. 
Design: Our institutional pathology database was searched from Jan 1, 2013 to current time for patients with LCIS 
diagnosed on CNB and underwent subsequent excision. Radiologic findings were noted for asymmetry, mass, 
lesion, distortion, enhancement, calcifications. The upstage rate (defined as invasive carcinoma and ductal 
carcinoma in-situ [DCIS] on excision) was calculated for all cases and specifically for cases with calcifications only 
(true upstage rate). Follow up outcome data was obtained on patients who were not upstaged on excision. 
Results: A total of 94 cases were identified (CLCIS= 75, FLCIS =15 and PLCIS=4). Most cases had multiple 
radiologic findings including calcifications (63%), mass (30%), non-mass enhancement (23%), asymmetry (15%), 
distortion (15%), and hypoechoic lesion (7%). Of the 94 cases, 18 cases were upstaged. The upstage rate for 
FLCIS/PLCIS (9/19: 47.3%) was significantly higher compared to CLCIS (9/75: 12%, p-value= 0.0015). Of the 76 
patients that were not upstaged, none developed invasive carcinoma or DCIS during follow up (average 46 
months). We then examined 39 cases with calcifications only as the radiologic finding (CLCIS=31, FLCIS=6, 
PLCIS=2). The upstage rate for FLCIS/PLCIS (2/8: 25%) was higher compared to CLCIS (1/31: 3.2%), but the 
difference was not statistically significant (p-value: 0.1011).  Of the 36 patients that were not upstaged, none 
developed invasive carcinoma or DCIS during follow up (average 47 months). 
Conclusions: All LCIS types that are associated with imaging findings other than calcifications should be excised. 
CLCIS associated with imaging findings of calcifications only, may be observed since the upstage rate is low. 
Additional studies are needed for LCIS variants diagnosed on core needle biopsy with imaging findings of 
calcification only, to determine appropriate management.

Background: In the 8th Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging System (yAJCC) for breast 
cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), tumor size is based on the largest focus of residual tumor, 
excluding treatment-related fibrosis. The goal of this study was to assess the impact of strict adherence to yAJCC 
 
 
 
 
111 
criteria on residual breast tumor size and discrepancies between yAJCC stage and Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) 
class. 
Design: Breast cancer resections after NAC from 2016-2020 were identified in the Anatomic Pathology laboratory 
information system. Stage IV and neoadjuvant endocrine therapy alone were exclusion criteria. Tumor size, ypT 
category and focality were reassessed using current yAJCC criteria and compared to the original reports. A mean 
of 32 slides per case were reviewed (range, 11-92). 
Results: A total of 260 cases met inclusion criteria, including 80 (31%) TNBCs, 74 (28%) HER2+, and 106 (41%) 
hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-). Slide review is complete for 84/260 (32%) randomly 
selected cases, including 24 (29%) TNBCs, 23 (27%) HER2+ and 37 (44%) HR+/HER2-. Of the 74 cases with 
residual tumor, the reassessed tumor size and ypT category differed from the original report in 37 (50%) and 34 
(46%) cases, respectively. In all of these cases, the tumor size or ypT category was smaller/lower on review. The 
34 cases with lower ypT categories included 27% of TNBCs, 69% of HER2+ and 47% of HR+/HER2- (p=0.04). Of 
the 239 cases with residual tumor in the original report, 12 (5%) were classified as multifocal versus 43/74 (58%) 
after review (p<0.001). The reassessed yAJCC stage group differed from the original report in 14 (19%) cases (all 
down-staged). There were 95/239 (40%) cases with yAJCC/RCB discrepancies in the original reports versus 38/74 
(51%) after slide review (p=0.08). The yAJCC/RCB discrepant cases in the original reports included 43% of TNBCs, 
34% of HER2+ and 34% of HR+/HER2- versus 38% of TNBCs, 35% of HER2+ and 57% of HR+/HER2- after 
review (p=0.18). 
Conclusions: Strict adherence to yAJCC criteria for measurement of the residual breast tumor after NAC resulted 
in smaller tumor size, lower ypT category and lower yAJCC stage in a subset of cases. More tumors were classified 
as multifocal. There was no significant change in the frequency of yAJCC/RCB discrepancies.

Clinical and Pathologic Features Associated with Invasive Breast Carcinoma with 2018 
ASCO/CAP Group ISH 2 Results (HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2.0 and Average HER2 Copy Number 
of <4.0)

Background: HER2-targeted therapies have proved to improve clinical outcome in patients (pts) with HER2-
amplified invasive breast carcinomas, compared to those with HER2-negative carcinomas. Accurate appraisal of 
HER2 status is integral in intendance of pts with breast carcinoma. In 2018, ASCO/CAP updated HER2 testing 
guideline to address uncommon results using dual-probe in-situ hybridization (ISH). Cases with HER2/CEP17 ratio 
>=2.0 but average HER2 copy number <4.0 signals per cell (ISH Group 2) are no longer considered eligible for 
anti-HER2 therapy, when corresponding HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) is 0, 1+, or 2+. ISH Group 2 results are 
rare and represented 0.8% of cases in the seminal HERA trial; thus, prognostic and predictive data remain limited. 
Design: The institutional database was interrogated. Pts diagnosed between 01/01/12-12/31/14 with invasive, 
recurrent, or metastatic breast carcinoma with HER2 FISH testing performed at our center were identified. All cases 
with HER2/CEP17 ratio >=2.0 and average HER2 copy number <4.0 were selected. When available, pt age, tumor 
size, lymph node status, histologic subtype, tumor grade, hormone receptor status, HER2 IHC results, treatment 
regimen (targeted HER2, cytotoxic, hormone, and radiation therapies), and follow-up were recorded. Differences in 
categorical variables were assessed with χ2 and Fisher exact tests, where applicable, and in noncategorical 
variables with Student t test. Statistical significance was established at P<.05. 
Results: During the study period, 40 pts had breast carcinoma reclassified as ISH Group 2 (Table 1). Median age 
was 62 years (mean,61 y;range,27-93 y). Median tumor size was 20 mm (mean,23 mm;range,5-109 mm); 52% 
were pT1 tumors. The most common histologic type was invasive carcinoma of no special type (30/40;75%). 
Twelve (36%) of 33 pts who had lymph node assessment showed nodal involvement. Twenty-one (53%) of 40 pts 
received anti-HER2 therapy, 8 of whom were treated in the neoadjuvant setting. Three (40%) of these 8 pts 
achieved pathologic complete response (pCR). Pts treated with HER2-targeted therapy were younger and had 
tumors of higher histiologic grade, compared to pts without anti-HER2 therapy; however, these differences were not 
 
 
 
 
112 
statistically significant (P=.29 and 1.0, respectively). The only significant difference between pts treated with and 
without anti-HER2 therapy was administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy (P<.001). Overall, clinical 
outcome was similar between the two groups.

Dual Detection of Extracellular and Intracellular Domains of HER2/ERBB2 Reveals Distinct 
Patterns of Isoform Expression with Mechanistic and Therapeutic Implications

Background: A HER2 isoform called p95HER2 is generated from alternative splicing or a post-translational 
modification by protease. p95HER2 can induce constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways via an 
intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Moreover, the consequence of truncated extracellular domain (ECD) is the 
lack of a Trastuzumab binding domain, leading to drug resistance. Detection of p95HER2 is limited in current 
recommendations for HER2 testing, which include detection of the intracellular domain (ICD) of HER2 
by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HER2 DNA amplification by Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization. p95HER2 is 
known to be observed frequently in HER2+ tumors, but the proportion of p95HER2 produced by either alternative 
splicing or protease activity and its resulting clonal distribution in tumors is unknown. Hence, we sought to assess 
the patterns of ECD loss in HER2+ breast cancers. 
Design: 39 HER2+ cases, which were pre-tested with both Herceptest IHC and Pathvysion two color FISH, were 
collected from the diagnostic biopsy service at UC Davis.  ECD and ICD of HER2 were visualized using 
fluorescence based IHC, and imaging analysis was performed with a multi-spectral imaging microscope. Full-length 
versus p95HER2 was judged by cell positivity for both ECD and ICD versus only ICD. 
Results: Our multiplex-IHC revealed four distinct patterns: ‘Pattern 1’ is full length HER2 (FL-HER2) possessing 
both ECD and ICD; ‘Pattern 2’ is fully p95HER2 which only stained positively for ICD; ‘Pattern 3’ is a mixture of 
subclonal p95HER2 and FL-HER2 tumors; and ‘Pattern 4’ is a mixture of various levels of ECD within the lesion 
 
 
 
 
114 
expressing both p95HER2 and FL-HER2. The analysis showed the following rates: 28.2% (Pattern 1), 12.8% 
(Pattern 2), 28.2% (Pattern 3) and 30.7% (Pattern 4). 
Figure 1 - 101 
 
Conclusions: Here we effectively show ECD domain loss in Herceptest-positive samples in patterns 2, 3 and 4. 
Because p95HER2 has implications with respect to Trastuzumab resistance, it is important to add efficient 
p95HER2 detection to our current clinical workflow. This should help determine better therapeutic options for 
targeting p95HER2, such as a strategy to inhibit specifically the HER2 tyrosine kinase domain or novel targeting 
neoepitopes and/or N-terminus of p95HER2.

Background: Breast tumors that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) generally display 
a high-grade histology and a more aggressive clinical phenotype than HER2-negative tumors, requiring 
chemotherapy and HER2-directed therapies at lower pT and pN stages to achieve comparable outcomes to 
patients with luminal A and B phenotypes. Identifying carcinomas that are HER2-driven is therefore critical. HER2-
positivity is very rare in low-grade tumors, and its biologic implication remains unclear in that setting. We aimed to 
characterize the clinicopathologic and molecular profiles of these tumors with unusual HER2 expression. 
Design: We identified 22 Nottingham grade 1 invasive carcinomas that were confirmed HER2-positive by standard 
guidelines via immunohistochemistry and/or fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies on core biopsies. Hormone 
receptor profiles were assessed using immunohistochemistry. Histology was reviewed by two independent 
pathologists. Fourteen cases had sufficient tissue for genomic evaluation, and were examined by a clinically 
validated next generation sequencing (NGS) assay that interrogates the full coding sequences of 340 genes for 
mutations and copy number variations (CNVs). Frequencies of molecular alterations and clinicopathologic features 
in subgroups were compared by Fisher's exact test. 
Results: Median age was 57 years (range: 36-72). The majority (81%) of tumors were invasive ductal carcinoma, 
and most (86%) were <2 cm in size (Table in Figure 1). Eight (36%) cases had positive lymph nodes at the time of 
resection (macrometastases: 4 ; micrometastases: 4). Five tumors were upgraded to Nottingham grade 2 upon 
excision. No change in HER2 status in resection samples was detected in re-tested specimens (8/22). All except 
one sample were ER positive. More than half (54%) received HER2-directed therapy, and none experienced a 
recurrence or disease-related death with a median follow-up of 351 days (range: 21-4732). Ten of 14 sequenced 
samples exhibited gain (n=3) or amplification (n=7) of ERBB2. No point mutation in ERBB2 was identified. PIK3CA 
(43%) and TP53 (21%) comprised the most common genetic alterations predicted to be pathogenic in this cohort 
(Figure 2). No significant association of genetic alteration with clinical or pathologic features was noted. BluePrint 
molecular subtyping analysis is in process.

Figure 2 - 102 
 
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first and largest series evaluating HER2-positive low-grade breast 
carcinoma using a comprehensive NGS panel. Results confirm presence of ERBB2 CNVs underlying HER2 
positivity in most of the tumors. A minority of these cases lack apparent ERBB2 genetic alterations, suggesting 
possible tumor heterogeneity, or alternative pathway(s) contributing to HER2 protein overexpression. The findings 
warrant further studies to define which patients may be spared HER2-directed therapy and related toxicity.

tissue diagnosis is a universally accepted means of definitive diagnosis of a breast lump. Fibroepithelial lesions 
(FEL) of the breast are biphasic neoplasms composed of a proliferation of both epithelial and stromal components 
and include fibroadenoma (FA) and phyllodes tumor (PT). PT are related with recurrence and  warrants an excision 
with safe margins. Therefore, PT needs to be differentiated from FA which isn't straightforward on core needle 
biopsy (CNB). Our aim was to assess the accuracy of CNB diagnosis of FA and PT by comparing it with diagnosis 
on subsequent excision specimen 
Design: At total of 166 cases of FEL of breast who underwent CNB and subsequent complete excision between 
January 2001 and December 2019 were included in our study. Microscopy glass slides of these cases were blindly 
and independently reviewed for diagnoses by two pathologists. 
Results: Out of 166 cases, 125 (75%) were reported as a definite diagnosis on CNB and 41(25%) cases were 
reported as FEL with differential diagnosis of FA & PT. On CNB, 76 cases were diagnosed as FA and 49 cases as 
PT while 110 cases were diagnosed as FA and 56 cases as PT on excision. (Table 1). Among 125 cases, CNB 
diagnosis and excision biopsy diagnosis were concordant in 113 (90.4%) cases. Among 12 cases with discordant 
diagnoses, 3 (25%) cases diagnosed as FA on CNB were diagnosed as PT on excision. Tumor size in these cases 
 
 
 
 
117 
was 6 cm, 12.5 cm and 17.5 cm. Nine (75%) cases diagnosed as PT on CNB were diagnosed as FA on excision. 
These tumors ranged in size from 1.8 to 6.5 cm and median was 4.5 cm. 
In 23 cases, PT were further categorized into benign, borderline and malignant categories on CNB. One out of 8 
benign PT on CNB was upgraded to borderline PT on excision specimen. One out of 14 borderline PT on CNB was 
upgraded to malignant PT and another case was downgrade to benign PT on excision specimen. One case 
diagnosed as malignant PT on excision remained malignant on excision specimen. Two cases diagnosed as 
conventional FA on CNB turned out to be complex FA on excision specimen. One case each of juvenile FA and 
complex FA diagnosed on CNB was also diagnosed as same on excision specimen. 
Overall diagnostic accuracy of fibroepithelial lesions on CNB is 90.4% with sensitivity 89% and specificity 93%. 
Positive predictive value was 96% and negative predictive value was 81.6%.

• CNB shows good accuracy and overall good concordance with diagnoses made on excision specimen. 
• All cases which were underreported as FA on CNB were more than 5 cm in size. Therefore, one should 
always think about the possibility of PT in tumor measuring >5cm in size. 
• Juvenile fibroadenoma and complex adenoma can impose diagnostic challenge for pathologist on CNB and 
can be misdiagnosed as PT, causing unnecessary surgical intervention. 
• Diagnostic accuracy can be improved by correlating with radiological findings.

Background: Pathological evaluation of lymph nodes in breast cancer comprises the assessment of excised nodes 
from sentinel lymph nodes and /or lymph node dissection. The distinction among isolated tumor cells (ITCs), 
micrometastases and macrometastases is important for patient management and prognosis.  Based on the most 
recent 8th edition of the AJCC staging manual, the size of a tumor deposit should be determined by measuring the 
largest dimension of any group of cells that are confluent or contiguous. Yet, we have encountered difficulties and 
subjectivity regarding how this concept is applied in practice. 
Design: A survey of 10 microscopic images of lymph nodes involved by metastatic carcinoma was shared with a 
large group of practicing pathologists to determine the variability in measuring the extent of metastatic foci. Images 
were all taken at 1x magnification from AE1/3 stained slides and included 3 options to measure metastatic foci (A, 
B, C) without providing the foci size, and one option categorized as uncertain (not sure/other, D). For analysis, 
responses were aggregated as ITCs, micrometastases and macrometastases. Demographic information was also 
collected. 
Results: A total of 88 pathologists completed the survey, the majority of which practice general pathology (75%). 
69% would seek consultation to reach consensus in difficult cases. 49% have been in practice for over 10 years. 
We observed significant variability regarding how metastatic deposits are measured, with responses ranging from 
ITCs, micrometastases and macrometastases, sometimes in the same case (Table 1). Cases with extranodal 
extension (ENE) were prompt to more subjectivity (Cases 5, 9 and 10). In case 5, responses ranged from ITCs up 
 
 
 
 
118 
to macrometastases with 25% of responders unsure of how to measure it (Figure 1). In case 9, all options 
constituted macrometastases but 64% of participants opted to exclude the size of the ENE from the measurement. 
For case #10, the majority of participants (81%, Figure 2) classified the lymph node as negative in an image 
showing a focus of ENE/soft tissue tumor deposit.  In cases with higher degree of concordance in metastases 
classification (6, 8), all given options constitute micrometastases.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected just about every aspect of life, including screening, diagnosis, 
treatment, and follow-up care for breast cancer patients. In March 2020, state governments and federal agencies 
recommended that healthcare systems delay elective care. In response, the COVID-19 Pandemic Breast Cancer 
Consortium Expert Opinion suggested the use of core biopsies for genomic testing to help triage patients for 
decisions about surgical vs. systemic treatment during the pandemic. This provided a unique opportunity to assess 
the feasibility and clinical utility of obtaining prognostic genomic information prior to making surgical or neoadjuvant 
treatment decisions in a real-world practice.  Our clinic participated in a pre-operative quality project using 
Mammaprint (MP), a 70 gene prognostic assay, and Blueprint (BP), an 80-gene molecular subtyping assay, in 
order to assess their efficacy and effectiveness in treatment planning for newly diagnosed breast cancer 
patients.  Here we report our initial findings. 
Design: From April to September 2020, our multidisciplinary breast cancer clinic sent all breast core biopsies with a 
diagnosis of breast cancer for MP and BP testing as part of the routine workflow. Typically, genomic testing is 
performed on the surgical excision specimen (Standard workflow, Figure 1). In our study, turnaround time (TAT) 
was evaluated using the Rapid Results workflow (Figure 1). When genomic results differed from IHC/FISH results, 
or suggested a different treatment plan than did clinical factors alone, we referred to this as “reclassification”. 
Results: MP and BP results were available for 95.3% of patients (n=201/211). The average TAT from biopsy to test 
results was 10.02 days, with an average lab TAT of 5.04 days. Results were available for tumor conference 
discussions 100% of the time. MP and BP resulted in reclassification 32% of the time (Table 1). Of the 65 patients 
where MP/BP re-classified results, treatment plans aligned with genomic results in 97% of cases.

Background: Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) is a pre-invasive form of breast cancer.  The annual rate of 
progression to invasive disease is approximately 1% in DCIS treated by surgery alone. Therefore, it’s critical to 
identify high risk DCIS, which would benefit from adjuvant treatment. Recent evidence suggests that the tumor 
immune microenvironment, especially, density of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) in DCIS is associated with 
the risk of recurrence and progression to micro and Invasive Breast Carcinoma. TIL quantification by pathologists is 
time-consuming and suffers from substantial inter-observer variability. In this study, we used computerized image 
analysis and machine learning approaches to quantitatively determine the density of TILs in DCIS and evaluate its 
association with probability of recurrence. 
Design: Representative H&E Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and corresponding outcome information (recurrence 
events) from 119 DCIS patients (61 patients with a recurrence event either invasive progression or local recurrence 
and 59 patients censored) belonging to the no adjuvant treatment arm of the UK/ANZ DCIS trial were retrieved and 
collected from Queen Mary university of London. WSIs were scanned using 3DHistech scanners at 43x 
magnification. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model described by Saltz et.al in 2018 for lymphocyte 
infiltration classification was applied on the DCIS slide images. TIL density was predicted by the CNN model inside 
each individual DCIS and the associated micro-environment (up to 250 um from DCIS boundary) as illustrated in 
Figure 1. The patients were classified as corresponding to high vs. low TIL density by applying the median TIL 
density value across all the patients as the threshold. 
Results: A threshold of 24% of TIL density was applied to distribute the patients into high vs. low TIL density group. 
The patients in high TIL density group had a significantly worse Disease Free Survival (DFS) compared to those in 
low TIL density group, with Hazard Ratio (HR)=1.88 (95% Confidential Interval=1.14~3.11, p=0.014) from log-rank 
test in Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival analysis as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 - 106 
 
 
Conclusions: A stronger lymphocytic response, represented by high density of infiltrated lymphocytes, is 
associated with worse prognosis in terms of DFS in patients suffering from DCIS.

Background: Forkhead box transcription factor C1 (FOXC1) expression has been identified as a specific 
biomarker for basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) in previous studies. However, few studies have investigated FOXC1 
protein expression in surrogate molecular breast carcinoma subtypes defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). This 
study aimed to investigate the diagnostic utility of the IHC-based FOXC1 expression in breast cancer subtyping and 
evaluate its correlation with histology subtypes, other biomarkers and clinicopathologic parameters in triple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC). 
Design:  FOXC1 expression was evaluated using IHC in a large cohort of 2443 invasive breast cancer patients. 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the diagnostic ability of FOXC1 expression in 
predicting TNBC and identify the best cutoff value of FOXC1 staining. FOXC1 expression was correlated 
with clinicopathological parameters and other molecular markers in TNBC. 
Results: The expression rate of FOXC1 in TNBC (77.84%) was significantly higher than in luminal A 
(5.3%), luminal B (8.2%) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive (26.0%) subtypes. The 
area under the ROC curve (AUC) values confirmed the high diagnostic value of FOXC1 for TNBC prediction 
(AUC=0.861, p<0.001). The cutoff value of 1% showed a maximized sum of sensitivity (77.27%) and specificity 
(90.54%), while the 10% cutoff showed a higher specificity value (94.43%). In TNBC, FOXC1 expression was 
 
 
 
 
123 
significantly associated with younger age and aggressive tumor phenotypes (higher histology grade and higher Ki-
67 expression). Furthermore, FOXC1 positive expression was mainly observed in invasive breast carcinoma (IBC) 
of no special type (NST, 94.21%), metaplastic carcinoma (83.33%) and adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC, 100%), 
while rarely observed in carcinoma with apocrine differentiation (1.69%). Correspondingly, FOXC1 expression 
was significantly associated with the expression of basal markers (CK14 and CK5/6) but negatively correlated with 
apocrine related markers (AR and GCDFP15) in TNBC.

Conclusions:  In conclusion, FOXC1 was a highly specific marker for TNBC. In TNBC, FOXC1 expression was 
positively correlated with basal markers, and negatively correlated with apocrine-related markers, which suggested 
that immunohistochemical detection of FOXC1 expression can be used as an additional diagnostic tool for 
prediction of triple-negative phenotype and further classification in TNBC.

RUNX3/SOX9 Expression in Relapsed ER+ Breast Cancer 
Hui Liu1, Hui Liu1 
1The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China 
Disclosures: Hui Liu: None 
Background: About 70% of breast cancer express estrogen receptor α (ERα). Tamoxifen is an agent used to treat 
patients with ER+ breast cancer. Despite the initial response of most patients with ER+ breast cancer to the 
treatment of tamoxifen, 30% - 40% of patients are subjected to drug resistance, tumor relapse and metastasis 
within 15 years. Therefore, it is important to further probe into the mechanism of breast cancer 
undergoing tamoxifen resistance. Overactivation of the Wnt signaling pathway is confirmed to contribute to 
tamoxifen resistance. RUNX3 is a tumor-suppressor gene that could inhibit the Wnt signaling pathway by regulating 
SOX9 expression. SOX9 (Sex-determining region Y-box 9) is a well-documented gene that could activate Wnt 
signaling pathway and has been confirmed to be related to tumor recurrence, metastasis and drug resistance. The 
purpose of this study is to study the expression of RUNX3 and SOX9 in primary and corresponding 
 
 
 
 
124 
relapsed  breast cancer tissues to clarify the relationship between RUNX3 and SOX9 and whether RUNX3 or SOX9 
was related to breast cancer tamoxifen resistance. 
Design:  20 pairs of primary/relapsed formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues of hormone receptor-
positive breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen from 2008. Tissue microarray (TMA) consisting of  200 breast 
cancer patients was prepared. The expression of RUNX3 and SOX9 was detected using immunochemistry staining 
and interpretated by experienced pathologists in the form of H-Score. The results were displayed as a heat map. 
Furthermore, RUNX3, SOX9 expression was detected in TMA of 200 ER+ breast cancer patients in the form of H-
Score. Pearson correlation analysis was performed based on the scoring results.  
Results: An analysis of the staining results of 20 primary/relapsed pairing samples showed that the positive 
staining patterns of both RUNX3 and SOX9 were clear nuclear staining . The expression of RUNX3 in 
relapsed specimen was significantly lower than that of the paired primary specimen (P = 0.0410), and the 
expression of SOX9 in the relapsed specimen was significantly higher than that of the corresponding 
primary specimen (P = 0.0496) (Figure 1). Analysis of TMA staining results involving 200 cases of ER+ breast 
cancer showed that the RUNX3 expression was significantly negatively related to the SOX9 expression (R 
= 0.209, P = 0.008) (Figure 2). 
Figure 1 - 108 
 
Figure 2 - 108 
 
Conclusions: The study confirmed that RUNX3 decreased  significantly in ER+ breast cancer relapsed specimens 
and SOX9 increased significantly on the contrary after tumor relapse. RUNX3 expression showed a 
significantly negative correlation with SOX9 expression. SOX9 might mediate tamoxifen resistance and breast 
cancer recurrence in ER+ breast cancer and could be negatively regulated by RUNX3.

Background: HER2-positive breast cancer patients may have different HER2/CEP17 ratios and HER2 copy 
numbers. Outcomes of HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy combined with 
trastuzumab are also different. We aim to identify the relationship between different groups of HER2-FISH-positive 
results and pathologic complete response（PCR）of patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy combined with 
trastuzumab. 
Design: 114 HER2-positive invasive breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant therapy with trastuzumab 
and chemotherapy were collected. According to FISH results, 114 patients were divided into three groups. Group 1: 
HER2/CEP17 < 2.0 and HER2 copy number ≥6.0; Group 2: HER2/CEP17≥2.0 and HER2 copy number ≥4.0 and < 
6.0; Group 3: HER2/CEP17≥2.0 and HER2 copy number ≥6.0. The efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy in three groups 
was analyzed. 
Results: Among 114 patients, 113 were invasive ductal carcinomas and 1 case was invasive micropapillary 
carcinoma. 58 cases (58/114,50.9%) were luminal B type, and 56 cases (56/114,49.1%) were HER2 
overexpression. 9 patients were included in FISH group 1, of which 3 (3/9,33.3%) were luminal B type and 6 
(6/9,66.7%) were HER2 overexpression type. 21 patients were in FISH group 2, included 13 patients (14/21,66.7%) 
with luminal B type and 7 (7/21,33.3%) with HER2 overexpression type. There were 84 patients in FISH group 3, 41 
(41/84,48.8%) with luminal B type and 43 (43/84,51.2%) with HER2 overexpression. There was no significant 
difference in molecular subtype among three groups (χ2=3.269, P=0.195). Totally, 33 patients (33/114,28.9%) 
achieved pathological complete response (pCR), and 81 cases (81/114,71.1%) were non-pCR. According to Miller-
Payne grading system, 39 cases (39/114,34.2%) were grade 5, among which 6 patients still had residual cancer 
cells in axillary lymph nodes. 75 patients (75/114,65.8%) were grade 1-4. In FISH group 1, 4 cases (4/9,44.4%) 
achieved pCR and 5 (5/9,55.6%) were non-pCR. In FISH group 2, only 1 case (1/21, 4.8%) achieved pCR and 20 
(18/21, 95.2%) were non-PCR. In FISH group 3, the number of pCR cases was 28 (28/84,33.3%) and non-pCR 
was 56 (56/84,66.7%). The pCR rate of neoadjuvant therapy in the second group was significantly lower than that 
in the other two groups, and there was significant difference in pCR rate among the three groups (χ2=8.811, 
P=0.009).

containing neoadjuvant treatment compared with other groups. The biological characteristics of this group of 
patients were worthy of further study.

Background: The term "pseudoangiomatous" was given to the benign entity pseudoangiomatous stromal 
hyperplasia (PASH) because of the slit-like interanastomosing spaces lined by myofibroblasts that mimic blood 
vessels. However, PASH can be found in MRI biopsies of enhancing lesions, suggesting a significant vascular 
component might be present. The aims of this study were to evaluate the microvascularity of PASH using digital 
image analysis and to correlate findings with MRI features. 
Design: PASH detected and biopsied by breast MRI was identified from a retrospective review of all MRI-guided 
breast biopsies performed at our institution from 2004-2019. One section from each case was immunostained with 
CD31 (Dako, 1:50) and scanned (Aperio AT2, Leica Biosystems) at 40x resolution. A representative field of PASH 
away from terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs), PASH immediately adjacent to TDLUs, non-PASH stroma adjacent 
to TDLUs, non-PASH fibrous stroma, and adipose tissue was selected for each case (Aperio ImageScope, Leica 
Biosystems). Microvessel density was determined for the selected fields using the Aperio Microvessel Analysis 
Algorithm (Leica Biosystems). Paired t-test and ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test were used to 
identify differences in mean microvessel density between the histologic areas. MRI features were reviewed by a 
breast radiologist. 
Results: 10 cases of PASH detected and biopsied by MRI were identified (2% of all MRI breast biopsies). There 
was no difference in the mean microvessel density between PASH and non-PASH stroma (p=0.7411). PASH 
adjacent to TDLUs (Figure 1A-B) contained increased microvessel density compared to PASH away from TDLUs 
(p=0.0008) (Figure 1C-D), non-PASH fibrous stroma (p=0.0003), and adipose tissue (p=<0.0001). Similarly, non-
PASH stroma adjacent to TDLUs contained increased microvessel density compared to non-PASH fibrous stroma 
(p=0.0056) and adipose tissue (p=0.0092). There was no difference in the mean microvessel density between 
PASH adjacent to TDLUs and non-PASH stroma adjacent to TDLUs (p=0.9965). The mean size of PASH on MRI 
was 2.4 cm (range 0.7-5.0 cm). MRI review showed 8/10 cases were non-mass enhancement (Figure 2), 10/10 had 
increased background parenchymal enhancement, and 7/10 progressive or plateau kinetics.

Conclusions: In this preliminary study evaluating MRI-detected PASH, digital image analysis showed a similar 
microvessel density between PASH and non-PASH stroma. Microvessel density was highest immediately adjacent 
to TDLUs; since the majority of cases displayed non-mass enhancement, further investigation of the epithelial-
stromal interface as a possible contributing factor to the MRI findings of PASH is warranted.

Disclosures: Sundis Mahmood: None; Kristen Muller: None 
Background: Breast cancers with low estrogen receptor (ER) expression, defined by 1-10% ER positivity, are 
infrequent, and their clinicopathological features are not well characterized. There are data that suggest low ER+ 
tumors are heterogeneous in both behavior and biology and often have gene expression profiles more similar to 
ER-negative cancers. We sought to characterize the clinical and pathological features of low ER+ breast cancers at 
our institution. 
Design: Our pathology database was searched for all invasive breast cancers from 2012 to 2020. Invasive tumors 
with low ER expression (1-10%) were included. ER, progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 (by dual-probe 
FISH) were performed on the core needle biopsies. Immunohistochemical assays were performed on paraffin-
embedded tissue sections fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 6-72 hours using the polymer system 
technique with appropriate controls. The assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using 
Anti-ER (SP1) and Anti-PR (16) antibodies. ER was repeated on the surgical specimen in a minority of cases. 
 
 
 
 
128 
Results: Twenty-four cases were identified. All patients were female (mean age 60 ± 12.5 years). Histologic type 
was predominantly invasive ductal carcinoma (22/24, 92%), and tumor size ranged from 0.3 cm to 10.0 cm (mean = 
3.1 cm ± 2.4 cm). Twenty-three cases were high-grade (96%), and one was intermediate-grade (4%). Ductal 
carcinoma in-situ and lymphovascular invasion were present in 43% of cases. Interestingly, ten (42%) tumors 
showed solid, sheet-like growth with associated necrosis, and among these, eight had pushing borders with 
prominent stromal lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, resembling the morphology described in basal-like or 
medullary-like breast cancers. Fourteen patients underwent axillary staging; metastases were present in five 
patients (N0 = 9, ITC = 1, N1 = 1, N2 = 0, N3 = 3). ER staining ranged from 1% to 10% with the majority showing 
weak expression. PR was negative in 75% of cases. HER2 was positive in a single (4%) case. One patient 
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and showed a pathologic complete response in the surgical specimen. ER 
was repeated on four surgical specimens per oncologist request, which all again revealed low ER expression. The 
average Oncotype DX recurrence score was 44 (n=6). 52% of patients received hormone therapy, 74% received 
radiation therapy, and 86% received chemotherapy. Follow-up was available for 22 patients (mean 31.7 mos.); 
three patients developed recurrences, two of whom died of disease, while 19 patients currently have no evidence of 
disease. 
Conclusions: The findings from our study support the notion that invasive breast cancers with low levels of ER 
expression often show aggressive histologic features.

Disclosures: Patrick McIntire: None; Raza Hoda: None; Miglena Komforti: None; Erinn Downs-Kelly: None 
Background: Histologic classification of Phyllodes tumors (PT) is challenging due to the complex morphologic 
features and historically ambiguous diagnostic criteria. Criteria have been addressed by Tan et al. in 20161. Herein, 
we re-review all malignant PT (Figure 1A) diagnosed at our institution and re-classified them based Tan et al. 
consensus guidelines, correlating with outcome.  
Design: All primary resection specimens of malignant PT were identified in the pathology files at our institution. 
H&E stained sections were reviewed by four AP board-certified, breast fellowship-trained pathologists. For each 
case, morphologic variables delineated in Tan et al. (i.e. stromal overgrowth, atypia, tumor border, presence of 
heterologous elements, presence of stromal overgrowth, necrosis) were scored, according to their guidelines. 
Following review, cases were reclassified as benign, borderline (low-grade malignant) or malignant. All 
discrepancies were discussed until there was a group consensus. The reviewing pathologists were blinded to 
patient outcomes. 
Results: The final cohort consisted of 20 cases of malignant PT from 20 patients diagnosed between 1994 and 
2019. The patients were all female with an average age of 57.5 years (range: 36-88 years). Upon reclassification, 
5/20 were ‘down-graded’ to borderline PT (Figure 1B). All borderline PT demonstrated a nodular growth pattern 
(100%) and one had a definitively infiltrative stromal interface (20.0%). Stromal cell atypia was moderate in three 
(60.0%, 3/5) and marked in two (40.0%, 2/5). Stromal cellularity was mild in one (20.0%, 1/5), moderate in two 
(33.3%, 2/6) and marked in three (60.0%, 3/5). All five borderline tumors had pleomorphic tumoral giant cells and 
‘leaf-like’ growth (100%, 5/5). No stromal overgrowth, necrosis or heterologous elements were present in the 
borderline tumors (0/5).  All tumors were excised to negative margins. Of the borderline tumors, there was neither 
recurrence nor metastases recorded. Follow-up data for borderline PT ranged from 1.5-180 months. 
In contrast, malignant PT resulted in 4/15 locoregional recurrences (26.6%) and 3/15 metastases (20.0%), overall 
46.7%. No tumors were re-classified as benign. 
 
 
 
 
129 
Figure 1 - 112 
 
Conclusions: The recent PT consensus guidelines are useful in the distinction between borderline and malignant 
PT1. Application of these guidelines allowed for re-classification into biologically relevant disease categories. None 
of the re-classified borderline PT resulted in locoregional recurrence or metastatic disease.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented oncologists with considerable challenges in providing 
effective care to patients with invasive breast cancer (IBC), while minimizing risk of exposure to this vulnerable 
high-risk population and assuring efficient utilization of resources. Per COVID 19 Pandemic Breast Cancer 
Consortium guidelines, patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and HER2 negative early IBC (T1N0, T2 or 
N1 disease) could be safely placed on neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) and surgery delayed for 6 to 12 
months. Traditionally, these patients have been treated with upfront surgery and the current literature on the effect 
of delaying surgery in this cohort is limited. We aim to evaluate whether NET can be offered as a viable therapeutic 
alternative in this population. 
Design: Retrospective chart and pathology slides review was done for patients with ER+ IBC treated with NET 
followed by definitive surgery between 04/01/2020 and 09/30/2020. Tumor dimensions by ultrasonography (USG) 
at the time of biopsy were taken as pretreatment size and dimensions on pathological analysis of definitive surgical 
specimen were taken as posttreatment size. Statistical analysis was done using paired t-test and Pearson 
correlation in Microsoft excel version 16.42. 
Results: Thirty-three patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Patient characteristics and treatment details are given in 
attached table 1 and waterfall plot for change in the tumor size for invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in figure 1. 
Given the significant known and observed discordance in radiological and pathological size in invasive lobular 
carcinoma (ILC), we excluded these patients from our analysis and got no statistically significant change in tumor 
size (p = 0.44). There was no correlation of treatment response with age, ethnicity, pretreatment size of tumor, 
histologic grade, ER status or duration of treatment. Comparing morphology of biopsy vs surgical resection, there 
were minimal histological changes of NET such as reduced cellularity, foamy histiocytes, necrosis, and fibrosis.

Conclusions: NET can be safely offered to patients with ER+ early breast carcinoma for 6 to 9 months to defer 
surgery in this small cohort. However, this needs to be confirmed by larger prospective studies. No significant post-
NET morphologic changes were noted in the tumor. ILC infiltrates as single cords with less conspicuous mass 
lesion, underestimating the tumor size on USG as highlighted by a significant discordance between USG and 
pathological size in our data set.

Validation of Three Surrogate Models

Disclosures: Anas Mohamed: None; Aisha Kousar: None; Takeda Kotaro: None 
Background: The Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS) is widely used by clinicians to predict recurrence and 
benefit from chemotherapy in ER-positive, N0 and N1 breast cancer patients. Cost and unavailability are two major 
disadvantages of the test. Multiple surrogate models have been developed to predict RS at no extra cost using 
different histologic and immunohistochemical parameters. This study aims to estimate the correlation of three 
surrogate models with the Oncotype DX RS, and to predict Oncotype DX risk category based on histologic type, 
tumor grade, and biomarker profile. 
Design: A retrospective study of four hundred breast cancer cases received between 2005 and 2020 with available 
Oncotype DX RS was performed at our institution. Tumor size, histologic type, combined tumor grade, tubular 
grade, nuclear grade, mitotic grade, and biomarker profile were reviewed. RS was calculated by three surrogate 
models that do not include Ki67: Breast Cancer Prognostic Score (BCPS) (Geradts et al 2010), Magee 0 (Flanagan 
et al 2008), and Magee 2 (Klein et al 2013). The categorical concordance (Fig.1) and correlation (Fig.2) of each 
surrogate model with the Oncotype DX RS were calculated. 
Results: Out of 400 cases, 322 cases (81%) were invasive ductal carcinoma, and 32 cases (8%) were invasive 
lobular carcinoma. 133 cases (33%) were low grade, 213 cases (53%) were intermediate grade, and 54 cases 
(14%) were high grade. All cases were ER-positive, 91% were PR-positive, and 97% were Her2-negative. BCPS 
showed the best categorical concordance (73%) with conventional cutoffs, and 54% concordance with TAILORx 
cutoffs. Both Magee models yielded similar and a slightly better categorical concordance (58%) than BCPS with 
TAILORx cutoffs. Only 4% of low grade tumors had a RS>25, compared to 12% of intermediate grade, and 35% of 
high grade tumors. About 14% of invasive ductal carcinomas had a RS>25, compared to only 1 of 32 cases of 
invasive lobular carcinoma (Table1). Among tumors with high PR expression, only 6% had a RS>25.

Conclusions: The three surrogate models demonstrated comparable correlation with the Oncotype DX RS. 
Categorical concordance of the three models was better when conventional cutoffs were used. A high Oncotype DX 
RS was observed only in a small percentage of invasive lobular carcinomas, low grade carcinomas, and tumors 
with high PR, suggesting that these types of tumors may not require Oncotype testing.

Lesions of the Breast?

Stuart Schnitt: None 
Background: Diagnosis of breast intraductal proliferations is based primarily on qualitative assessment of 
cytological and architectural features. However, interobserver variability in classification as usual ductal hyperplasia 
(UDH), atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has been repeatedly 
documented.  In this study, we assessed the accuracy of automated histomorphometric evaluation of H&E sections 
using computational approaches for classifying these lesions. 
Design: Representative foci of UDH, ADH, low grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS-L), and intermediate or high 
grade DCIS (DCIS-I/H) from 150 consecutive breast core needle biopsies were photographed at 400x (total: 250 
images). After annotation of the images, the STARDIST algorithm was used to segment the nuclei and extract 
histomorphometric features. Descriptive analysis followed by training of a random forest classifier was performed. 
For this initial analysis, ADH and DCIS-L were analyzed as a single low-grade neoplasia (LGN) group. 
Results: DCIS-I/H had the largest nuclear area size (median: 36.1 μm2) with high variability in size (interquartile 
range (IQR):  20.0 μm2). LGN and UDH had similar median nuclear areas (26.6 μm2 vs 28.4 μm2). However, LGN 
had less nuclear size variation than UDH (IQR:  7.3 μm2 vs 8.9 μm2). UDH nuclei showed higher variability in 
hematoxylin staining intensity than LGN and DCIS-I/H (median hematoxylin SD: 0.06 vs 0.05 and 0.04 
respectively). Conversely, LGN nuclei were darker than nuclei in DCIS-I/H and UDH (median hematoxylin intensity: 
0.35 vs 0.34 and 0.32 respectively). These differences were all statistically significant (ANOVA P <0.001 for all). 
Principal component analysis followed by K-means clustering with silhouette analysis showed that the nuclei are 
best clustered into 3 groups. 
The 250 images were split into test and training groups using stratified randomization with 100 images assigned to 
the test group. A random forest classifier was trained to distinguish between UDH, LGN, and DCIS-I/H. At the 
image-level, the model was 91% accurate; 4/9 discrepancies involved misclassification of UDH as LGN or DCIS-
I/H. The remainder were misclassifications between LGN and DCIS-I/H (Figure). 
Figure 1 - 115 
 
 
 
 
 
134 
Conclusions: Objective, automated histomorphometric measures show significant differences among intraductal 
proliferations of the breast.  These measures can be used to train probabilistic models to potentially serve as 
diagnostic support tools for pathologists. Our model, solely based on nuclear features, achieved an accuracy of 
91% which may potentially be improved by quantifying and incorporating architectural features.

Disclosures: Saleh Najjar: None; Gregor Krings: None; Yunn-Yi Chen: None; Sandra Shin: None; Kimberly Allison: 
None; Gregory Bean: None 
Background: The current WHO classification of breast tumors defines breast neuroendocrine (NE) neoplasms as 
invasive carcinomas characterized by a combination of NE morphology and extensive immunoreactivity to NE 
markers. Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) is an emerging nuclear marker of NE differentiation. Studies on 
INSM1 expression in the breast are very limited. Here, we characterize immunohistochemical expression of INSM1 
in breast carcinomas (BCs) enriched for NE neoplasia, with comparisons to synaptophysin (SYN) and 
chromogranin (CHR). 
Design: A cohort of 115 primary BC (73 whole sections, 42 tissue microarray cores) were evaluated for INSM1, 
SYN and CHR by immunohistochemistry. The series was enriched with cases demonstrating cytologic and 
architectural NE features (n=75), including solid papillary carcinoma (SPC), NE tumor, small cell NE carcinoma and 
large cell NE carcinoma, as well as other BCs (invasive ductal NST, lobular, metaplastic, etc). Cases ranged from 
Nottingham grade 1-3. Expression was assessed by the percentage of cells expressing the marker at any intensity. 
Bivariate correlations and comparison of means were conducted using Spearman’s correlation and paired t-test, 
respectively. 
Results: Overall, 48%, 41% or 25% of the cases was positive for INSM1, SYN and CHR, respectively. INSM1 
expression correlated with SYN and CHR expression (0.53, p <0.01 and 0.39, p <0.01); INSM1 was positive in 
31/42 (73%) SYN-positive cases and in 18/26 (69%) CHR-positive cases. Expression of all three markers was seen 
in 18 cases. SYN was the only positive marker in 4 cases; 1 case was only positive for CHR. INSM1 was the only 
positive marker in 19 cases; this included 13 carcinomas without overt NE morphology (n=36), compared to 0 or 1 
case for SYN and CHR, respectively. Expression was most often focal in this setting. INSM1 also showed focal 
staining in normal epithelium. Among SPCs (n=15), INSM1, SYN or CHR was positive in 66%, 80% and 53% of 
cases, respectively. INSM1 expression correlated with ER and PR expression (0.22, p 0.039 and 0.44, p <0.01), 
similar to SYN and CHR. Among grade 3 BCs with NE morphology (n=31), INSM1, SYN or CHR was positive in 
53%, 60% and 36% of cases, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in INSM1 expression 
between invasive and in situ carcinoma. 
Conclusions: INSM1 is an additional marker in the arsenal to assess NE differentiation. Among BCs, the 
sensitivity of INSM1 appears intermediate between SYN and CHR, but may be less specific.

Are Metaplastic Carcinomas with Osseous Differentiation and Primary Osteosarcomas of 
the Breast One and the Same?

Disclosures: Grace Neville: None; Christopher Fletcher: None; Deborah Dillon: None; Stuart Schnitt: None 
Background: The distinction between metaplastic breast carcinomas with heterologous osseous differentiation 
(MBC) and primary breast osteosarcomas (OS) may be difficult. Histologic evidence of epithelial differentiation, co-
 
 
 
 
135 
existent ductal carcinoma in situ, and/or immunohistochemical (IHC) evidence of epithelial differentiation support a 
diagnosis of MBC. However, some have suggested that virtually all breast lesions with osseous differentiation are 
MBC, even if no histologic or IHC evidence of epithelial differentiation is demonstrable (presuming malignant 
phyllodes tumor is excluded).  In this study, we profiled malignant tumors of the breast with osseous differentiation 
to determine if MBC and OS are genomically distinct entities. 
Design: Ten MBC with osseous differentiation and 5 osseous breast tumors without histologic or 
immunophenotypic evidence of epithelial differentiation or features of phyllodes tumor were identified from our 
institutional and consult files (2013-2020).  All patients were female with a median age of 59 years (range 31-82 
years). Median tumor size was 2.9 cm (range 2-14 cm). Malignant osseous foci were macrodissected and analyzed 
by hybrid-capture next generation sequencing (Oncopanel), interrogating the full coding regions of 447 genes for 
mutations and copy number variations (CNVs). In four cases, separate areas showing epithelial differentiation were 
also sequenced. 
Results: Overall, the most commonly altered genes were TP53 (n= 9), PIK3CA (n= 8), CDKN2A (n=6), CDKN2B 
(n= 6), MTAP (n= 6), TERT (n= 6) and PTEN (n= 4). Thirteen cases showed one of two mutational patterns: TP53 
mutation +/- PTEN inactivation (n=7) or PIK3CA mutation +/- TERT +/- CNKN2A inactivation (n=6). Two cases 
showed both patterns. Cases classified as MBC or OS according to traditional histopathologic and IHC criteria were 
represented equally by both genomic patterns (Table 1). Four cases with separate analysis of osseous and 
epithelial areas showed similar genomic profiles in both areas of the same tumor.

Conclusions: Malignant breast tumors classified as MBC with osseous differentiation and as OS are not distinct at 
the genomic level, suggesting that there is no role for genomic profiling in this differential diagnosis. Since patients 
with MBC and OS may be treated with different chemotherapeutic regimens, this remains an important differential 
diagnosis that should continue to be made according to traditional histopathologic and IHC criteria.

Background: TNBC is biologically diverse with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Molecular profiling 
studies identified 4 major subtypes (Basal-like 1 and 2, mesenchymal and luminal-androgen-receptor); however, in 
most settings these are not clinically available. We studied the expression of biomarkers by immunohistochemistry 
to enhance our understanding of its heterogeneity possibly guiding targeted therapies in TNBC.  
Design: TMAs from 273 TNBCs were stained with p53, p16, RB1, BRCA1 associated protein-1 (BAP1), PD-L1 
(SP142), androgen receptor (AR) and MMRs (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6). P53 was scored as abnormal (A) 
 
 
 
 
136 
based on diffuse nuclear, complete absence or diffuse cytoplasmic staining. P16 was considered overexpressed 
(OE) based on block type strong nuclear/cytoplasmic staining. RB1, BAP1 and MMR were scored as lost (L) or 
retained (R). PD-L1 staining >=1% in inflammatory cells/ tumor area was considered positive. AR was assessed in 
semi quantitative manner (<1, 1-10, 11-25, >25%) and was considered positive when expressed in >10%.   Fisher 
exact test was performed to assess the significance of biomarker expression proportions in different histologic 
subtypes. Unsupervised cluster analysis was performed using the ‘pheat map’ () function in R package 
version1.0.12. 
Results: The results are summarized in Table 1. AR was positive in 33.4% of TNBC, (25.5, 74.4, 22% in NOS, 
apocrine (AC) and metaplastic carcinomas (MC; P<0.001). PD-L1 was positive in 48% of all cases (57.4, 23.8, 
38.9% in NOS, AC and MC types p=0.0002). Among NOS, AC and MC P53 was A in 90.3, 64.3 and 50% 
(p<0.001); P16 was OE in 60.2, 26.2 and 44.4% (p<0.001); RB1 was L in 38.7, 7.1 and 22.2% (p=0.00025); and 
BAP1 was L in 3.6%, 4.9% and 0% (p=0.646).  All the tumors except one NOS case with PMS2-L had intact MMR 
stains. Unsupervised cluster analysis (Figure 1) identified three major molecular clusters (C1-3;  described left to 
right). C1: RB-R, p53-normal, p16- usually normal; these can be further clustered into AR+/PD-L1- and AR-/PD-
L1+/- subclasses; most of the cases were of special type. C2: RB-L, p53-A and almost always p16-OE; the majority 
were NOS, AR negative and PD-L1> 50%. C3: RB-R, p53-A, +/-p16OE, PD-L1 >50% and AR+ between C1 and 
C2. BAP1-L cases were p53-A and PD-L1+.

Conclusions: By IHC three major clusters of TNBC based on p53, p16 and RB can be identified. AR is expressed 
across the major TNBC subtypes. PDL-1 is positive in significantly higher proportion of TNBC-NOS. BAP1 loss is 
rare and MMR abnormalities are exceedingly rare in TNBC. These findings highlight potential predictive markers for 
targeted therapies that could be further tested in clinical trials.

Background: Metastatic breast carcinoma to mucosal sites is not a common clinical manifestation, but it can be 
confused clinically, radiographically and pathologically with a primary neoplasm. We undertook a retrospective 
study to assess mucosal site metastasis and evaluated these according to age, histopathologic subtypes, 
prognostic markers, time to metastasis and survival 
Design: We performed a retrospective search of our pathology records from 1993-2020 looking for any metastatic 
breast carcinoma to mucosal sites. With these cases identified, we then performed a search of medical records for 
data on age, subtype, prognostic markers, time from primary diagnosis to mucosal metastases, survival and 
presence of other metastases. 
Results: 56 total cases were identified, all female. The mean age at metastatic diagnosis was 57.2 years, (31 to 93 
years). The distribution by histologic subtype showed 28 (50%) cases of ductal carcinoma, 26 (46%) of lobular 
carcinoma and 2 mixed (4%).  The most common location for metastasis was gastrointestinal (GI) tract with 19 
cases, followed by respiratory with 15, gynecologic with 14, genitourinary with 5 and eye with 3. Lobular carcinoma 
was more common in gastrointestinal (72%) and gynecological (85%), while ductal carcinoma was more common 
in respiratory (100%), eye (100%) and genitourinary (60%) sites.  Regarding prognostic markers, 64% of cases 
were ER positive, 37.5% were PR positive and 12.5% were HER2 positive by immunohistochemistry. The average 
time to mucosal metastasis was 5.6 years (1-35 years). Five patients had mucosal metastases diagnosed 
concurrently with breast primary, and two cases were diagnosed before a primary breast carcinoma was identified. 
Survival data was available for 28 patients, with an average survival after diagnosis of 1.9 years (6 months-7 
years). Data on other metastases was available for 23 patients, with 15 presenting with previous metastases to 
other sites, most commonly body fluids (8 cases), bone (7 cases), other mucosal sites (4 cases) and central 
nervous system and liver (3 cases each). 
Conclusions: Metastatic breast carcinoma can uncommonly metastasize to most mucosal sites, and should be 
considered for any patient who presents with carcinoma of these sites. On our study, lobular carcinoma showed a 
predilection for the GI and gynecological tracts, while ductal carcinoma exhibited preference for respiratory and 
genitourinary sites, as well as the eye. Attention must be brought to any history of breast malignancy even if 
remote, since several cases can be diagnosed even 30 years after the original diagnosis. Metastatic breast 
carcinoma should also be considered in cases where no breast primary has been diagnosed, as it can be a rare 
first manifestation of already metastatic disease. Metastasis to mucosal sites tends to portend a bad prognosis, 
owing to co-existence with more widespread metastatic disease and short survival.

Background: Evaluation of the tumor bed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for breast cancer is imperative 
to accurately determine response to treatment, guide further therapy, and assess prognosis. Whether tumor bed 
features differ based on the presence or absence of residual carcinoma or by tumor subtype has not been 
previously studied in detail.   
Design: We reviewed H&E-stained sections of the post-treatment surgical specimens for 665 patients with stage I-
III breast cancer treated with NAC followed by surgery from 2004-2014 blinded to pre-treatment characteristics. The 
tumor bed in each case was evaluated for minimal changes, mild edema, fibrosis/scarring, elastosis, mucin, myxoid 
change, hemosiderin deposition, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, and foamy macrophages. The frequency of 
each feature was compared for cases with and without a pathologic complete response (pCR; ypT0/is ypN0) and 
between tumor subtypes. 
Results: Among the 665 cases, there were 278 lumpectomy and 387 mastectomy specimens. Breast cancer 
subtypes included 242 hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-) tumors (36.4%), 216 (32.5%) 
HER2+ cancers, and 207 (31.1%) HR-HER2- tumors (TNBC). pCR was seen in 7.9%, 37.0%, and 37.7%, of 
HR+/HER2-, HER2+ cancers, and TNBC respectively (p<0.001). As shown in the Table, for all tumor subtypes, 
elastosis, mucin, and myxoid change were all significantly more frequent in the tumor bed of cases without a pCR 
(all p<0.02). Conversely, foamy and hemosiderin-laden macrophages were significantly more common in those with 
a pCR (both p≤0.001). Most of these differences were also seen for each tumor subtype; however, among HER2+ 
tumors, there were no significant differences in tumor bed macrophages in cases with and without a pCR.

Conclusions: Among breast cancer patients treated with NAC, the frequency of several tumor bed changes 
differed significantly according to presence of residual disease. In particular, stromal alterations were significantly 
more common in the tumor bed of patients with residual carcinoma, while macrophage infiltration was more 
frequent in those with a pCR. Whether or not histologic features of the tumor bed are associated with outcome 
following NAC requires further study.

Background: Ki67 immunohistochemical evaluation is subject to high intra- and inter-observer variability. 
Therefore, digital counting (DC) methods have been designed and compared to conventional counting (CC) in 
attempt to homogenize and improve its usefulness. 
It is conceivable that Ki67 expression and Oncotype DX recurrence score (ORS) should be positively correlated, 
given that Ki67 is one of the major contributors to the multigene panel. In a time in which digital pathology is gaining 
adepts, conventional and digital Ki67 quantification methods seem to correlate well with each other. The aim of this 
study is to confirm this high correlation in our daily practice, and also determine which of these methods correlates 
better with the prognostic capacity of Oncotype DX. 
Design: A total of 89 cases of luminal Her-2 negative breast cancers were analyzed. At least three randomly 
selected high-power fields were evaluated with a Ki67 digital algorithm (Ventana). A minimum of 100 cells/field for 
CC and 500 cells for DC were counted in each field in all cases. A Ki67 cutoff of 25% positive cells (institutional 
mean) was used for surrogate molecular subtype classification (luminal A-like vs luminal B-like). 
The ORS was obtained in 55 cases that were subsequently correlated with CC and DC methods using the Pearson 
correlation coefficient (r). 
Results: Ki67 quantification by CC and DC methods showed an excellent intraclass coefficient correlation of 0.81 
(95%CI: 0.73-0.89). We found a higher correlation of conventional Ki67 quantification with ORS (r=0.45, p<0.001), 
than with digital method(r=0.39, p=0.003), even then both were significantly correlated. 
Conclusions: In conclusion, we have shown that CC and DC methods correlate well enough to consider stopping 
manual counting. We have also shown that both methods correlate positively with Oncotype DX recurrence score, 
and this correlation is higher with the conventional method.

Disclosures: Michael Rathbone: None; Soha El Sheikh: None 
Background: Diagnostic breast biopsies in the UK are assigned a B code to guide further treatment. The most 
complex and heterogeneous group of abnormalities, with the most interobserver variability is the B3 “lesion of 
uncertain malignant potential” category. The proportion of B3 lesions varies across institutions nationally and 
internationally with a 5% rate in the UK (1999-2006), 4.5% in Germany, 11.9% in Italy, 17% in Switzerland, and 8% 
in the US (Shaaban et al). Our aim is to assess the outcome of B3 lesions at our centre, in comparison with 
national and international data. 
Design: We identified all breast biopsies received in 2019 and divided the cases using B category. We then further 
subclassified the B3 lesions into: lesions with ductal atypia (atypical intraductal epithelial proliferation 
AIDEP/ADH/FEA, atypia in papillary lesion or radial scar), in situ lobular neoplasia, papillary lesion without atypia, 
radial scar, fibroepithelial lesion and other. Using our records and the NHS Breast Screening Programme 
(NHSBSP), we obtained the final excision histology, and calculated the malignant upgrade rate or positive 
predictive value (PPV) to comply with the NHSBSP H5 classification:  invasive carcinoma, DCIS and confirmed 
LCIS. 
Results: Of a total the 4168 B coded breast biopsies received in 2019, 375 were B3 (9.0%) and 296 (79%) had 
available outcome data. There were 84 cases of AIDEP with a PPV of 14%; 77 papillary lesions without atypia with 
a PPV of 1.3%; 57 cases of in situ lobular neoplasia with a PPV of 22.8% and radial scars without atypia with a 
9.8% PPV. Figure 1 compares the PPV of total B3 cases, B3 with atypia and B3 without atypia, with the results 
from large recent studies. 
   
Conclusions: The data show that our institution has a high rate of classifying biopsies as B3 (9%) compared with 
large studies (range 4.5 to 6.7%). Whereas our PPV rate for B3 lesions without atypia was within expected limits, 
the PPV for B3 lesions with atypia was significantly lower at 19.1%. The increased B3 rate combined with the lower 
PPV suggests overuse of the B3 category in diagnostic biopsies, which has management implications. 
Our possible overuse of B3 is under investigation through a blinded, multi-consultant review of the B3 cases with 
atypia, to measure the degree of interobserver variability, and explore whether changes to our routine practice need 
to be considered.

Comprehensive Analysis of Immunohistochemical Estrogen Receptor Expression in 
Mammary Normal Epithelial Elements: Generating Contemporary Data on “Internal 
Positive Control”

None; Kamaljeet Singh: None 
Background: The 2020 CAP/ASCO guidelines on Estrogen receptor (ER) immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing of 
breast cancer recommend routine evaluation of "internal normal epithelial elements (INEE)” on each tested slide. 
The expert panel recommends reporting internal control status with 0% to 10% ER (low ER +) staining in 
carcinoma. Contemporary data on ER IHC in mammary INEE is lacking, as most studies investigating this are from 
the last century. Our aim was to investigate the distribution and intensity of ER IHC expression in breast INEE. 
Design: The ER IHC slides on consecutive breast carcinomas during 2011 from a single institution were reviewed. 
Dako’s ER PharmDx™ Kit (Cat # SK310) was used on Dako Autostainer Link 48 instrument. Dewaxing (60°C in 
oven x 1 hour), rehydration, antigen retrieval (pH=6.1) & peroxidase blocking (x5 minutes) was followed by 
incubation with primary antibody (Dako, clone ER-2-123+1D5), secondary antibody, and DAB chromogen-substrate 
system. The ER extent (0-100%) and intensity (score of 0, 1+ to 3+) was recorded in carcinoma, and INEE and an 
Allred score was computed. 
Results: Total 283 ER slides comprising of 250(88%) needle biopsies, 25(9%) excisions, and 8(3%) skin biopsies 
with 60(21%) DCIS, 135(48%) invasive, and 87(31%) invasive and in-situ carcinomas and 1 benign biopsy were 
reviewed. Figure 1A shows the typical ER staining pattern of INEE. The INEE were absent in 48(17%) cases. 
Completely ER- lobules and ducts were identified in 1(0.6%) and 9(4.2%) samples, respectively. Focal ER- INEE 
(Figure 1B) were present in 74/235(31%) samples, most of which were ER- ducts (71/74). The mean Allred score 
for ducts was significantly lower than lobules (5.73 versus 5.33; p=0.023). The INEE were either absent or ER- in 9 
of 45 (20%) ER-/ER low+ carcinomas. The ER- INEE did not correlate with age or ER- status of carcinoma. Stromal 
cell ER nuclear staining (Figure 1C) was present in 104(37%) cases and dermal fibroblasts nuclei were ER+ in 
4(50%) skin biopsies. Aberrant cytoplasmic ER staining (Figure 1C) was noted in carcinomas, INEE 
and histiocytes in 19(6.7%), 29(10.2%) and 5(1.8%) cases, respectively. ER positive secretions (Figure 1D) were 
found in 31(11%) cases. 
Figure 1 - 123 
 
 
 
 
 
142 
Conclusions: We report absent INEE and ER- INEE in 17% and 4.8% breast samples, respectively. Benign breast 
lobules show most consistent ER staining when compared to ducts, and should therefore be treated as the most 
reliable INEE while evaluating ER IHC.

positive (ER+). The visual guides (in 10% increments) published with the College of American Pathologists ER 
guidelines show intermix of ER+ and ER- nuclei (Fig1A, 20% nuclei staining). There is no data on heterogeneity in 
ER expression in breast cancer. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence and describe patterns of 
ER heterogeneity in BC. 
Design: The ER IHC slides on consecutive BC during 2011 from a single institution were reviewed. Dako’s ER 
PharmDx™ Kit (Cat # SK310) was used on Dako Autostainer Link 48 instrument. Dewaxing (60°C in oven x 1 
hour), rehydration, antigen retrieval (pH=6.1) & peroxidase blocking (x5 minutes) was followed by incubation with 
primary antibody (Dako, clone ER-2-123+1D5), secondary antibody, and DAB chromogen-substrate system. The 
extent (0-100%) and intensity (score of 0, 1 to 3+) of ER staining was recorded in BC (invasive and in-situ), lobules, 
and ducts. Allred scores for each epithelial element was computed. A BC with 0-10% staining was classified as low 
ER+. The ER heterogeneity was defined as differentially ER staining tumor cell sub-populations that displayed 
abrupt change in ER staining intensity (eg. Fig1B, ER- & ER+ DCIS, 20% nuclei staining). 
Results: Total 282 ER IHC slides from 262 patients comprising of 249 (88%) needle biopsies, 25(9) excisions and 
8(3%) skin biopsies with 60(21%) DCIS, 135(48%) invasive, and 87(31%) invasive and in-situ BCs were reviewed. 
Heterogeneity of ER IHC expression was found in 11(3.9%) BCs (Table 1). All 11 cases were grade 2 or 3 and 
contained ER- or low ER+ carcinoma components. Ten of 11 BC (except 1 LCIS) were originally classified as ER+. 
Three patterns of heterogeneity were identified in in-situ BC (8 DCIS, 1 LCIS): type I (n=4) with low ER+ and ER+ 
DCIS (Fig 2A), type II (2 DCIS, 1 LCIS) with ER- and ER+ in-situ BC populations (Fig 2B), and type III (n=2) with 
ER- and ER low+ staining (Fig 2C). One case of invasive ductal carcinoma showed distinct ER- and ER+ 
components and 1 case showed discordant ER staining in in-situ (ER- DCIS) and invasive (ER+) components (Fig 
2D). Aberrant cytoplasmic ER staining was noted in 19 carcinomas (6.7%), 29 internal normal epithelial elements 
(10.2%), and histiocytes 5(1.8%). Aberrant ER staining in luminal secretions was identified in 31 slides (11%).

Conclusions: We report ER heterogeneity in 6% DCIS and ER discordance between in-situ and invasive 
carcinoma in 1.1% BC. All ER heterogeneous BC contain ER- or low ER+ component, but in routine practice they 
are classified as ER positive. Further studies are needed to refine the BC ER heterogeneity criteria and investigate 
its clinical relevance. Retesting of ER on excisional specimens may be considered for DCIS that are ER negative 
on core biopsy.

Background: Multiple studies have shown increased PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in triple 
negative breast cancers (TNBC). Atezolizumab is currently the only FDA-approved checkpoint inhibitor being used 
to treat TNBC, and treatment requires PD-L1 (Ventana sp142) immune cell (IC) staining ≥1%. However, 
Pembrolizumab has also shown promising results in clinical trials. Qualification for Pembrolizumab therapy requires 
PD-L1 (Dako 22c3) Combined Positive Score (CPS), currently being investigated at cutoff values of ≥1 and ≥10. 
Breast pathologists must be familiar with these cutoffs and be able to accurately assess tumor PD-L1 positivity with 
these different antibodies. This goal of this study was to assess the interobserver agreement in calculating PD-L1 
(Dako 22c3) CPS amongst breast pathologists at our institution in preparation for clinical use. 
Design: 45 cases of TNBC from a three year period (2017-2019) were reviewed. Each case was stained for PD-L1 
(Dako 22c3). The cases were independently evaluated by four breast pathologists (two senior pathologists and two 
junior pathologists), and the CPS were recorded. 
The data were analyzed in terms of percent concordance between pathologists at CPS ≥1 and ≥10 as well as 
actual numerical values.  Interrater agreement between pathologists was assessed for every pathologist duo and 
for the agreement of all pathologists. For each outcome, the observed percentage agreement/concordance and the 
Cohen’s kappa statistic (κ) were reported. In addition, the Shrout-Fleiss intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 
reported as a measure of the interrater reliability. Statistical analysis was performed in SAS 9.4. 
Results: At CPS ≥1, there was fair agreement amongst all four pathologists (48.9%, κ= 0.328), moderate 
agreement between the two junior pathologists (86.7%, κ=0.444), and moderate agreement between the two senior 
pathologists (80%, κ=0.601).  Similar results were noted at CPS ≥10, with fair concordance amongst all four raters 
 
 
 
 
144 
(44.4%, κ=0.321), moderate agreement between the two junior pathologists (73.3%, κ=0.481), and moderate 
agreement between the two senior pathologists (82.2%, κ=0.530). 
When the data were analyzed for interrater reliability at actual CPS value, there was moderate correlation between 
all four pathologists (ICC=0.534), moderate-to-good correlation between the two junior pathologists (ICC=0.738), 
and moderate correlation between the two senior pathologists (ICC=0.666). 
Conclusions: There was overall fair-to-moderate agreement between breast pathologists in calculating PD-L1 
CPS. As the PD-L1 CPS will be used to define the population of breast cancer patients which will receive treatment 
with Pembrolizumab, agreement amongst breast pathologists is critical. The data suggest that group training, 
consensus scoring, or digital image analysis for PD-L1 IHC could be helpful at our institution.

Background: The 2018 ASCO/CAP Guidelines for HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer emphasizes concurrent IHC 
and ISH evaluation to determine HER2 status in cases classified as equivocal with intratumoral heterogeneity. 
Furthermore, recent studies show that HER2 genetic and non-genetic heterogeneity may predict resistance to 
neoadjuvant HER2-targeted therapy, showing the importance of HER2 heterogeneity analysis for patient treatment 
planning. Our objective was to develop a 2nd generation HER2 gene protein assay (GPA) to simultaneously assess 
both HER2 protein expression and HER2 gene status on a single slide, and then to compare the performance of 
our HER2 GPA with individual immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) assays. 
Design: We designed a fully-automated HER2 GPA that combined IHC using the 4B5 rabbit monoclonal antibody 
with an oligo-based ISH assay for use on an automated staining system. To assess performance of the GPA, we 
compared the staining of the HER2 GPA to that of the individual 4B5 IHC assay and to two CE IVD approved on-
market bright-field ISH assays across 101 clinically HER2-positive, procured breast cancer samples. 
Results: The technical performance of the GPA was equivalent to that of the individual IHC and superior to that of 
the individual ISH assays. Overall pass rates were higher for the HER2 ISH component of the GPA (100%) 
compared to the two CE IVD approved ISH assays (88.1% and 93.1%, respectively). When scored according to the 
2018 ASCO/CAP Guidelines, the IHC portion of the GPA and individual 4B5 IHC had a 95.1% concordance rate 
when binned into the three categories of negative, equivocal, and positive. In cases with an IHC vs. ISH scoring 
discrepancy, ISH results were concordant with the GPA IHC score over the standard IHC score 60% of the time. 
The ISH portion of the GPA and an on-market ISH assay had a 98.9% concordance rate, with the 4B5 IHC alone 
agreeing with the GPA ISH score in the lone discrepant case. Analysis of the GPA results found heterogeneity in 
26.7% of cases, with non-genetic heterogeneity found in 19.8% of cases and genetic heterogeneity in 6.9% of 
cases. 
 
 
 
 
145 
Figure 1 - 126 
Conclusions: We have demonstrated that the GPA is technically robust and has high concordance to individual 
HER2 IHC and ISH assays. Because it allows for simultaneous evaluation of HER2 protein expression and gene 
amplification at the cellular level, the GPA is a powerful tool for identifying patients with HER2 intratumoral 
heterogeneity and HER2 protein and gene dissociation.

Background: Technical advancements in the field of digital pathology has yielded new opportunities for a digital 
and remote work environment. We sought to evaluate the utility of the digital review of breast cancer markers using 
whole slide images (WSI) from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cytology cell blocks (CBs) using 3 different 
scanners. 
Design: Breast cancer CBs sampled from 20 patients (1 breast, 8 lymph nodes, 9 pleural fluid, 2 chest wall) with 
available immunohistochemical prognostic markers (IHC) and reported using conventional microscopy were 
included. All glass slides were scanned (20 H&E, 20 ER, 20 PR, 16 AR and 20 HER2) on 3 different scanners 
(Leica GT450, Phillips Ultrafast Scanner, and 3DHistech P1000) at 40x equivalent resolution (0.25 um/pixel). Four 
breast pathologists with cytology experience reviewed the IHC digital images and recorded the semi-quantitative 
scoring for each marker blinded for the reported results. Discrepancies between reads were adjudicated and 
determined to be clinically relevant if a change in reporting was identified (i.e. positive vs negative) between paired 
microscopic/digital interpretations. 
Results: The overall concordance between microscopic/digital pairs was 99.6% with excellent agreement between 
Leica vs 3DHistech, moderate agreement between Leica vs Philips and good agreement between Philips vs 
3DHistech scores, all significant (P <0.001),see Figure1. 
 
 
 
 
146 
In total we had 228 IHC reads (60 each for ER, PR, HER2 and 48 for AR) with 3 discrepancies seen in the same 
case using the 3 different scanners and corresponding to 1.3% of paired reads. Clinical significance of these 
discrepancies is questionable as the difference was from 1% to 0% nuclear staining for PR. 
Quality assurance review of WSI prior to digital readings showed that, of the 96 glass slides scanned on the 3 
scanners (total=288 scanned images), 23%(n=65) required rescanning due to label barcode detection failures, 
14%(n=39) due tissue detection failures, and 2%(n=5) due to out of focus scans. The first-time successful scan rate 
and average number of rescans to successfully scan each slide are shown in Table 1. After remediation of the slide 
labels and manual software scanner adjustments, failures decreased to total of 3 images (1%).

Background: Background: Estrogen Receptor Positive (ER+) breast cancer (BCa) makes up nearly two-thirds of 
all BCa diagnoses in the United States. Nearly all ER+ Lymph Node (LN) positive BCa patients will receive 
chemotherapy, but not all patients will benefit from it. For LN- patients, the criteria for chemotherapy varies widely 
between different clinics. The ability to prognosticate  risk of recurrence and mortality with respect to LN status 
would enable physicians to develop more appropriate treatment plans for their patients. This study involves the use 
of machine learning approach called  Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to identify the prognostic ability of computer 
extracted feature of cancer nuclei on H&E images for predicting short-term (<10 years) recurrence-free survival 
(RFS) in LN- and LN+ breast cancer patients. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches which examine the 
tumor appearance on average,  the MIL approach aims to identify the specific regions on whole slide images most 
reflective of cancer prognosis. 
Design: Digitized H&E slides of ER+ BCa tissue from the Cancer Genome Atlas were divided into an LN+ group 
(n=315) and an LN- group (n=344). The LN+ and LN- groups were further separated into training sets (LN+ = 252, 
LN- =275) and testing sets (LN+=63, LN- =69). Ten 2000 X 2000 pixel patches were randomly selected from the 
tumor region of each slide, and 4663 features relating to nuclear morphology were extracted from each patch. For 
each training set, first the feature list was narrowed down to the 12 most informative features according to ReliefF-
MI feature ranking. The top identified features were used to train the MIL classifier in conjunction with the Earth 
Mover’s Distance Kernel (EMD-Kernel) to predict short-term recurrence and mortality. Classifiers specific to  LN+ 
(+), and LN- (-) patients were constructed.  Performance of M+ and M- were respectively evaluated on the LN+ and 
LN- test sets by Kaplan-Meier Survival analysis and Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) analysis controlling for age, 
progesterone receptor status, HER2 status, and TNM-stage. 
Results: The 12 top features measured various aspects of nuclear shape, haralick nuclear texture, cell cluster 
graphs, cell run length, and delaunay triangulation.  
LN+ patients identified as high-risk by M+ had significantly worse outcomes compared to those with predicted RFS 
(Hazard Ratio (HR)=3.85, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)=1.61 - 9.2, p=0.002). M- demonstrated significant risk 
stratification of LN- patients (HR=5.10, CI=1.93 - 13.5, p=0.001). CPH showed both S- (HR=4.6, CI=1.3-16.3, 
p=0.017) and S+ (HR=3.24, CI=1.0-10.4, p=0.048) are prognostic of RFS, independent of leading clinical variables 
(age, progesterone receptor status, HER2 status, TNM-stage).

Background: Metastatic breast carcinomas (BCs) with phenotypes of either triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) or low 
hormonal receptor levels (ER and/or PR less than 10% and HER2-) are mainly treated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. A subset of these tumors eventually develop resistance urgently requiring novel therapeutic options. 
Targeting androgen receptor (AR) pathway may represent a potential new therapeutic strategy in breast cancer. In 
this report, we evaluated the prognostic value of AR expression and the molecular alterations in this subgroup of 
metastatic BCs. 
Design: The cohort consisted of 114 metastatic BCs with phenotypes of either triple negative or low hormonal 
receptor levels diagnosed from 2014 to 2019 at our institution. Patient demographics, tumor pathologic 
characteristics (histologic type, size, lymph node status, and metastatic sites), and tumor marker profile (ER, PR 
and HER2) were evaluated. Assessments of AR expression by immunohistochemistry and molecular studies were 
performed on whole tissue sections. AR was graded as positive when at least 1% of tumor cells had nuclear 
immunoreactivity. Figure 1 shows representative images of AR expression in metastatic BCs. 
Results: Of the 114 metastatic BCs, 37 (32.5%) cases showed AR expression and 77 (67.5%) were lack of AR 
expression. Statistical analysis revealed that AR expression was associated with older age, lobular carcinoma, 
positive ER and positive PR in primary tumors, and positive lymph nodes, but not with HER2 status in primary 
tumors, ER/PR/HER2 status in metastatic tumors, neoadjuvant therapy, residual tumor, and mismatch repair 
(MMR) proteins. In addition, patients with AR expression metastatic tumors had significantly lower rates of brain 
metastasis (p = 0.025), longer metastatic intervals (p = 0.001), and lower rates of death (p =0.036).  Moreover, 
compared to tumors without AR expression, tumors with AR expression had significantly higher rate of PI3CA 
mutation (p < 0.001). 
Figure 1 - 129 
 
 
 
 
 
150 
Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that AR expression has prognostic value in this subgroup of metastatic 
BCs and tumors with AR expression had different molecular alterations compared to those without AR expression. 
Our findings add to the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that drive the different BCs and raise the 
interesting possibility that new treatment strategies such as targeting the AR therapy may show benefit against a 
subgroup of metastatic BCs.

Background: Intraoperative consultation of breast sentinel lymph nodes (BSN) is an invaluable tool to reduce 
morbidity associated with unnecessary axillary dissection. However, these specimens can be a diagnostic 
challenge, particularly in the setting of neoadjuvant treatment. Our aim was to evaluate reduction of discordance 
rates between frozen section diagnosis and final diagnosis of BSN at our institution via standardization of 
intraoperative consultation protocol. 
Design: We implemented an intraoperative BSN evaluation protocol consisting of a standardized grossing protocol 
(serial sectioning at 2 mm with frozen evaluation of all sections) and a required second consult, preferentially from a 
pathologist with breast expertise. Comparison of discordance rate and etiology of discordant cases was performed 
to nonstandardized cases that were retrospectively identified from the two-years prior. Additional comparison within 
the protocol group was performed on specimens that were evaluated with and without a second pathologist. 
Results: The non-protocol group consisted of 57 patients and 127 specimens retrospectively collected from 2017-
2019. The protocol group contained 52 patients and 173 specimens prospectively collected from 2019-2020. 
Discordance rate significantly decreased to 5% from 12% following implementation of the standard protocol (p-
value = 0.037, chi-square). The rate of review by a second pathologist increased from 8% to 57%. Four causes of 
discordance were identified: gross sampling, block sampling, micro-metastasis/isolated tumor cells (ITCs) and 
cognitive error (misdiagnosis) (TABLE). All specimens in the protocol group were grossed via standardized protocol 
however 99 (57%) were seconded of which 6 (16.5%) were discordant and 74 (43%) were not seconded of which 3 
(12.5%) were discordant.

Conclusions: The implementation of a standardized BSN grossing protocol significantly decreased the rate of 
discordance between frozen section and final diagnosis, attributed to a decrease in error in gross sampling and 
block sampling. In contrast, review by a second pathologist had little impact on rate of discordance. The majority of 
specimens in both groups received neoadjuvant therapy and therefore the impact on discrepancy rate could not be 
evaluated.

Background: Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) are the most aggressive type of breast cancers with high 
tumor cell proliferation. Most TNBCs show Ki-67 proliferation index of over 50%. When treated with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy (NACT), pathologic complete response (pCR) is observed in 30-40% of cases. Although patients 
with pCR are often considered “cured”, morbidity and mortality remains high due to recurrence in cases with 
residual disease (triple negative paradox). In contrast, the incidence of TNBC with lower cell proliferation index, 
their clinical features, particularly response to NACT remains unknown. 
Design: We queried our institutional database (10 year) for TNBC with Ki-67 proliferation index of 30% or lower 
(TNlowKi). The search yielded 137 cases. The clinical features of these 137 cases are reported. Although we 
suspect special subtype breast cancers, basal luminal AR type, etc. to be represented in this cohort, a formal 
Pathology slide review is currently pending. Of the 137 cases, 31 (excludes stage IV patients) were treated with 
NACT. Analysis of response to NACT is also reported. 
Results: TNlowKi tumors represent <2% of all breast cancers and ~10% of TNBC. Please see Table 1 for patient 
and tumor characteristics. In contrast to what is expected with usual TNBC, the patients with TNlowKi are slightly 
older, have smaller tumor size, and lower tumor grade. With average follow up of 67 months, the distant recurrence 
free survival was 85%, overall survival of 77% and breast cancer specific survival of 86%. Tumor stage was 
prognostic (see Figure 1). Overall, 57% of the patients received chemotherapy with increasing chemotherapy use in 
higher stage patients. Among 68 stage I patients, only 26 (38%) received chemotherapy, but this did not impact 
distant recurrence free and overall survival (see Figure 1). Of the 31 stage I-III patients treated with NACT, 3 (10%) 
showed pCR, 1 (3%) residual cancer burden (RCB) class I, 17 (55%) RCB-II, and 10 (32%) RCB-III. Three pCR 
and one RCB-1 patients were pre-therapy clinical stage II, had Ki-67 index of 20% or lower, did not recur, and were 
alive at last follow up.

Conclusions: Despite low Ki-67 proliferation index, some patients do respond completely to NACT and have 
excellent prognosis. Due to overall good prognosis of stage I patients and lack of clear benefit in early stage 
disease, chemotherapy can be safely withheld in select stage I triple negative tumors with low Ki-67 proliferation 
index.

Background: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is rare, comprising 0.1-1% of breast carcinomas, which are ER, PR, 
HER2 negative. The solid variant with striking basaloid features is difficult to distinguish morphologically from some 
triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) with basaloid features. This distinction is critical because, in contrast to 
other TNBCs with worse prognosis and outcome, ACC is a low-grade malignant tumor cured by simple mastectomy 
and most cases have excellent survival. Similar to salivary gland ACC, breast ACC exhibit recurrent translocation t 
(6:9) (q22-23; p23-24), resulting in MYB and NFIB gene fusion. MYB protein overexpression can be detected by 
immunohistochemistry and is useful adjunct to the diagnosis of ACC. We aimed at comparing the expression of 
MYB in ACC with that of other TNBCs with special reference to those with solid/ basaloid morphology. 
Design: On paraffin fixed formalin embedded tissues, Immunohistochemical staining for MYB was performed on 
157 cases, including ACC (n=17), TNBC (n= 140) in automated Leica system, utilizing Anti-c-Myb antibody (clone 
EP769Y) from Abcam. Evaluation for MYB expression by assessment of nuclear staining intensity (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) 
was performed, by two independent pathologists. Categorization of cases was done as follows: with strong staining 
(3+) as Positive; with moderate (2+) or weak staining (1+) (either focal or diffuse), as Low Positive; and those with 
no staining (0) as Negative. 
Results: Of the 17 ACC cases (15 were of solid/ basaloid and 2 had mixed cribriform/ solid morphology), all 17 
ACC cases (100%) were positive for MYB expression and exhibited strong nuclear staining. Out of 140 TNBC 
cases (11 had solid/ basaloid morphology and rest 129 had varied morphology), none of the TNBC were positive 
for MYB (0%), 37 cases exhibited low positivity (26.4%) and 103 cases were negative (73.6%). Out of 11 cases of 
TNBC with solid/basaloid morphology, only one (9.1%) had low positive expression and 10 cases (90.9%) were 
negative for MYB expression. 
Figure 1 - 132 
 
 
 
 
 
154 
Conclusions: Our study revealed strong nuclear staining for MYB in all ACC cases and in none of other TNBC 
cases, indicating that strong MYB staining by immunohistochemistry is a sensitive and specific marker for diagnosis 
of Adenoid cystic carcinoma of breast. Thus, we recommend routine staining for MYB antibody in all TNBCs with a 
solid/ basaloid morphology, to diagnose cases of ACC.

Background: SNAIL1 is a zinc finger transcription factor that regulates epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
of tumor cells and has been associated with poor prognosis. The expression pattern of SNAIL1 across molecular 
subtypes of Breast carcinoma has been studied in patients reporting to a South Indian multispecialty tertiary care 
hospital. 
Design: SNAIL 1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemical studies on 200 breast carcinoma tissue 
samples of different molecular subtypes including Luminal A, Luminal B, Her2Neu and triple negative breast 
cancer. Nuclear staining of SNAIL1 in more than 5 % of tumor cells was considered positive (Figure1). Cytoplasmic 
staining of SNAIL 1 was considered negative (Figure2). A correlation was drawn with detailed clinicopathological 
annotation and outcome to analyze influence of SNAIL 1 on clinicopathological parameters.  
Results: SNAIL 1 expression varied significantly in the different intrinsic subtypes of breast carcinoma. We 
observed strong SNAIL1 expression in Triple Negative and Her2 subtypes of Breast Cancer among other 
subtypes.  In the 200 breast carcinoma tissue samples analyzed triple negatives and Her2Neu were found to show 
increased expression of SNAIL1 than the subtypes luminal A and B (p=0.000). Differential expression was also 
established with different grades of breast carcinoma. A significant association of SNAIL1 expression with 
increasing grade was observed in the study (p=0.000). Higher tumour grade (II and III) was significantly associated 
with increased SNAIL1 expression. A strong and significant association of SNAIL1 expression was seen with pTNM 
stage of breast cancer, T (p=0.030), N (p=0.000) and M (p = 0.001) (Table 1). Parameters like age and family 
history of the subjects did not show any direct relation with SNAIL1 expression.

Background: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) pose a significant diagnostic challenge in breast pathology as histological 
criteria and cutoffs for grading are complex and arbitrary. Nevertheless, the clinical behavior of PTs varies widely 
and correlates, in part, with the histological grade. Methylation signatures have gained interest as diagnostic and 
prognostic tools in a variety of neoplasms. In particular, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) has been found to be a 
useful biomarker. Herein, we examine 5-hmC levels in PTs by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in relation to the 
clinicopathologic characteristics. Since cellular fibroadenoma (cFA) is a differential diagnosis of benign Phyllodes, it 
is also included in the study.     
Design: A representative section of 30 benign, 11 borderline, and 10 malignant PTs, and 15 cFA was 
immunostained with anti-5-hmC antibody (Active Motif, Inc., Carlsbad, CA ). The intensity and percent positivity of 
stromal cell nuclei were assessed by three pathologists blinded to the diagnosis. A final score was calculated by 
multiplying the intensity (1=weak, 2=moderate, 3=strong) and proportion (1=0-25%, 2=26-50%, 3=51-75%, 4=76-
100%) scores. Linear regression, Fisher’s exact test, and ROC curve were used for statistical analysis (Microsoft 
Inc, Redmond, CA).  
Results: Mean nuclear expression of 5-hmC did not differ significantly between cFA and benign PT stroma, 
whereas it showed a gradual reduction as PT grade increased (p<0.001, Table 1, Figure 1).  In addition, 5-hmC 
levels significantly decreased with adverse histologic features, including large tumor size, infiltrative margin, marked 
stromal cellularity, marked stromal cell atypia, increased stromal mitoses, as well as the presence of stromal 
overgrowth and heterologous elements. Defining borderline PT by an IHC score of ≥9 (170), 5hmc showed a 
sensitivity of 90.5% and specificity of 91.1%; for malignant PT defined as score ≥3 (70), 5-hmC IHC achieved a 
sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 96.4%.  
  
Figure 1 - 134 
 
 
 
 
 
157 
Figure 2 - 134 
 
Conclusions: In PTs, the stromal expression of 5-hmC decreases with increasing histologic grade and correlates 
with morphologic predictors of adverse behavior. Benign PT and cFA show comparably high levels of 5-hmC, 
supporting previous studies on similarities between the two neoplasms. The reduced nuclear 5-hmC expression 
shows promise as a sensitive and specific marker for borderline and malignant PT, especially in distinguishing 
these tumors from benign fibroepithelial lesions.

Background: Management of intraductal papilloma (IDP) diagnosed on core needle biopsy is controversial.  It has 
been recommended that all IDPs, especially when symptomatic, to be excised. We sought to examine the rate of 
upgrade to carcinoma of cases diagnosed as IDP without atypia on core needle biopsy (CNB) and compare it to 
cases with diagnosis of IDP with atypia. 
Design: The study was approved by our institution review board (IRB). All consecutive cases with the biopsy 
diagnosis of intraductal papilloma between January 2010- December 2015 were included (n=437).  Patients who 
did not undergo resection (256, 58.6%) and those with simultaneous biopsy diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ 
(DCIS) or invasive carcinoma (IC) with IDP (30, 6.9%) were excluded.  Clinical features were reviewed and 
pathological findings were collected from the pathology reports. Pathology upgrade is defined as the presence of 
DCIS or IC in the subsequent resection specimen. 
 
 
 
 
158 
Results: Of the 151 IDP cases, 110 (77.8%) had biopsy diagnosis of IDP with no atypia, two of which (1.8%) had 
diagnosis upgrade to malignancy on subsequent resection (IC, 1; DCIS, 1). The remainder 41 cases of IDP with 
atypia (31 within papilloma, 9 outside papilloma, and one case with atypia within and outside the IDP), of which 14 
(41.1%) demonstrated pathology upgrade to carcinoma on resection (DCIS, 12; IC, 2). Features associated with 
upgrade to malignancy diagnosis on subsequent resection include patient age (P= 0.0009) and presence of atypia 
in association with IDP (P< 0.0001).  Table summarizes the relation between patient's demographic, clinical and 
pathology data (atypia versus no atypia) and the upgrade rate.

Conclusions: The findings of our study support the recommendation of resecting all IDPs with atypia. While the 
risk of immediate upgrade is low in IDPs without atypia, further studies are needed to address short- and long-term 
progression risk in this group to tailor treatment accordingly.

Background: Mammaprint (MP) is an FDA cleared multi-gene assay indicated for prognostic use in early stage 
breast cancer, regardless of ER status. However, similar to other multigene assays, it is often used for making 
chemotherapy decisions (predictive use) in ER+ breast cancers in routine practice. The various test results are not 
interchangeable and there is a considerable difference in risk assignment between different tests at the individual 
tumor level. Alternatively, multivariable models such as Magee Equations (MEs) can also be used either definitively 
or in triage for selecting cases for molecular testing. ME3 score has been shown to have chemo-predictive value - 
rare pathologic complete response (pCR) to chemotherapy with score 25 or below, up to 14% pCR rate with scores 
>25 to <31 and 40% pCR rate in patients with score 31 or higher (Farrugia DJ et al. Mod Pathol. 2017. PMID: 
28548119 and Bhargava R et al. Mod Pathol. 2020. PMID: 32661297). 
Design: The current study analyzed the clinical requests for MP testing at our institution from the last 4 years. MP 
testing was performed on 367 cases in the adjuvant setting. Additional 18 treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
[NACT] were assessed for response with respect to MP result and ME3 scores. All Magee equations were 
calculated on 365 of 367 non-neoadjuvant cases but only ME3 was calculated on neoadjuvant cases. The 
associations between MP results with average ME scores and other variables are described. Responses to NACT 
on 18 cases were compared between MP results and ME3 scores. 
Results: Associations between MP results and pathological variables is shown in Table 1. All 18 cases except one 
treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed high MP result, but none achieved pCR, only one showed residual 
cancer burden (RCB)-1, 11 RCB-II, and 6 RCB-III. In contrast, only one case showed ME3 score >31 and this case 
showed RCB-1. The ME3 scores ranged from 13.8 to 32.7 with mean and median ME3 scores of 23.4 and 21.9 
respectively. None of the 9 neoadjuvant cases with positive pre-therapy lymph node core biopsy had negative node 
on resection.

Background: While PTEN loss in HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancers (BC) is associated with worse disease 
free survival and overall survival, it is not well studied in ER+ BC, even though there is known association with 
tamoxifen resistance. One of the major limitations is that PTEN assessment lacks consistency and reproducibility. 
Concordance between immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next generation sequencing (NGS) is not well 
established. This study is to compare PTEN expression by IHC and PTEN gene alteration by NGS in ER+ BC.  
Design: We reviewed 372 ER+ advanced BC tested by NGS Oncomine v3 (Thermo Fisher) from 2018 to 2020 to 
assess PTEN mutation and copy number aberration. 48 cases were selected to perform IHC with a monoclonal 
antibody to human PTEN (6H2.1, Dako). PTEN IHC interpreted as retained (>5% cytoplasmic and/or nuclear stain 
in tumor cells), loss (<1%, with retained stain in adjacent benign cells), and equivocal (focal/weak stain or 
heterogeneous stain). Consensus was reached between 4 pathologists. 
Results: In 372 ER+ BC cases tested by NGS, 23 (6.2%) had PTEN mutations, 10 (2.7%) had deletion. In the 48 
cases wherein both NGS and IHC were tested, IHC showed loss in 7 (15%), equivocal in 5, and retained in 36 
tumors (Table 1). NGS showed PTEN alteration in 15 (31%) including deletion in 8, point mutation in 4, in-frame 
indel in 1, nonsense in 1, and splice-site mutation in 1 tumor. All tumors with PTEN loss had either PTEN deletion 
or splice-site and nonsense mutations. 89% (32/26) tumors with retained PTEN had no PTEN alteration detected 
by NGS. 4 equivocal cases showed  focal/weak stain, with 1 deletion, 1 in-frame indel, 1 point mutation, and 1 no 
detected altheration. The other equivocal case showed heterogeneous PTEN staining and partial PTEN deletion.

Conclusions: PTEN gene alterations are present in 8.9% of advanced ER+ BC by NGS. PTEN loss by IHC 
correlates with PTEN deletion, splice-site or nonsense mutations. Equivocal PTEN expression warrants further 
reflex test by alternative assay.  Our data support complementary testing by IHC and NGS to accurately 
assess PTEN status in ER+ BC.

Background: HER2, a routine breast cancer marker, is associated with worse prognosis but increased sensitivity 
to targeted chemotherapeutics such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab that are frequently used in the neoadjuvant 
setting. The purpose of this study was to compare pathological outcomes in HER2-positive patients treated with 
HER2-targeted neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) following guideline updates set by CAP/ASCO in 2018.  
Design: 99 HER2-positive patients, as defined by the 2018 CAP/ASCO updated guidelines, from three institutions 
were identified. All institutions used primary immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reflexed fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) if IHC (2+) equivocal. Clinicopathologic features, HER2 positivity method (IHC or FISH), and 
post-NAC tumor response were reviewed. Biomarker status was dichotomized as HER2 if estrogen receptor (ER) 
and/or progesterone receptor (PR) were negative or low positive (1-10%) and luminal-HER2 (LUMHER2) if ER/PR 
positive (>10%). Response was measured by three prognostic markers— pathologic complete response (pCR), 
Residual Cancer Burden (RCB), and downstaging. 
Results: Most (97%) were female with mean age of 54 yrs. 54 were LUMHER2 and 45 HER2. 71 were IHC 
positive and 28 FISH positive. Of those that were FISH positive, mean HER2/CEP17 ratio was 3.28 (range 1.57-
8.1) and mean average HER2 signals/cell was 7.47 (range 3.55-14.4), with 25 group 1 (HER2/CEP17≥2 and 
average HER2/cell≥4), 1 group 2 (HER2/CEP17≥2 but average HER2/cell<4) and 1 group 3 (HER2/CEP17<2 but 
average HER2/cell≥6). Most (94%) underwent NAC plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab, with the remainder 
receiving NAC plus trastuzumab. 
On univariate analysis, pCR was associated with HER2 (vs LUMHER2) biomarker status and HER2 positivity 
detection method of IHC (vs FISH), with features of higher biopsy grade (p=.06) and clinical stage (p=.07) 
approaching significance. Multivariate analysis showed pCR and RCB to be associated with HER2 biomarker 
status and IHC detection method. Downstaging also showed variable significant associations with HER2 biomarker 
status and IHC method (Table 1).

None; Minghao Zhong: None 
Background: There has been considerable progress in our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, which 
account for approximately 5% of all breast cancers (BC). BRCA1 mutation is associated with high histologic grade, 
ER/PR/HER2 triple negative breast cancer and BRCA2 mutation is usually high-grade, ER+/HER2-. While the 
characteristics of BRCA-mutant BC have been well established, the features of BC with other pathogenic germline 
variants (PGV) are less well studied. We aimed to characterize the clinical, pathological and molecular features of 
BC with PGV other than BRCA1/2. 
Design: Breast cancer patients’ samples as well as germline control specimens were submitted for molecular 
profiling using Oncomine Comprehensive Assay panel (OCP; Thermo Fisher Scientific) to identify alterations in up 
to 143 cancer related genes by targeted next generation sequencing (NGS). We searched our data base for BC 
with non-BRCA1/2 PGV and analyzed their clinical, pathological and molecular features. 
Results: 8 breast carcinoma patients with PGV other than BRCA1/2 were identified. 3 patients (37.5%) 
carried ATM mutations; each of the others harbored a mutation in one of the following genes: CHEK2, TP53, 
NBN, ERCC2 and BAP1.  Besides the germline mutations, tumors also had somatic variants in genes such 
as ESR1, PI3KCA, TP53, and a few gene amplifications including MYC and MDM2. The average onset age was 
48.3 years old (+/-4.7 years) and no patient had a personal history of other malignancy. 7 patients had significant 
family histories of cancer, and 1 reported Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Carcinomas from patients with PGV other 
than BRCA1/2 were associated with intermediate to high grade (at least grade 2) histology. 7 patients had 
infiltrative ductal carcinoma and 1 patient (with a TP53 PGV) had infiltrative lobular carcinoma. The biomarker 
tumor profile by IHC revealed 7 (87.5%) ER+/PR+/HER2- and only 1 (12.5%) ER-/PR-/HER2-.

Conclusions: Most of the non-BRCA PGV in our study are DNA damage response (DDR) genes including ATM, 
CHEK2, ERCC2 and NBN. The patients with those PGV in DDR genes may be eligible for certain clinical trials, 
such as PARP inhibitor.  Patients with PGV other than BRCA1/2 presented with breast cancer at young age, had at 
least grade 2 infiltrative carcinoma and were strongly associated with ER+/PR+/HER2- immunophenotype. 
Although a small series, our data suggests the distinct characteristics of non-BRCA mutations in breast cancer 
patients and highlights the value of multi-gene panel testing.

Cancer Center

Disclosures: Serena Wong: None; Emily Reisenbichler: None 
Background: Triple negative (TN) breast cancer, defined as hormone receptor and HER2 negative, is an 
aggressive tumor subtype with poor clinical outcome. The IMpassion130 trial showed that patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic TN carcinoma demonstrating at least 1% immune cell (IC) staining with the PD-L1 assay 
SP142 had improved survival with the addition of Atezolizumab to Nab-Paclitaxel. As a result, in March 2019, the 
FDA approved the SP142 PD-L1 assay as a companion diagnostic test to determine eligibility for immunotherapy in 
these patients. Due to the availability of numerous PD-L1 assays and the complexity of various scoring methods 
required for tumors of different organ systems, many institutions are choosing to use commercial labs for the 
performance and interpretation of this assay. We review the utilization and results of commercial PD-L1 testing at 
our institution. 
Design: Retrospective review of send out SP142 testing was collected from 3/2019 to 8/2020. Clinical and 
pathologic information was collected from pathology reports and medical record review, including receptor profile of 
primary and metastatic tumors (if present). PD-L1 results were obtained from commercial lab reports with 
percentage (%) and intensity of IC staining. Cases with low or negative hormone receptor and negative HER2 were 
classified as TN. Cases with hormone receptor and/or HER2 positivity in both primary and metastatic tumors were 
classified as non-TN. PD-L1 results were defined as negative (IC<1% staining) or positive (IC³ 1% staining). 
Results: 118 samples (50 non-TN tumors, 60 TN tumors, and 8 non-TN breast primaries with TN metastases) from 
111 patients were tested for PD-L1 SP142. 36 samples were from breast primaries and 82 were from metastases. 
7 samples were deemed quantity not sufficient (QNS) or indeterminant for PD-L1 assessment. More than one 
sample was sent for testing in 5 patients, 3 of which were repeats for initial QNS results. 2 patients had testing from 
multiple metastatic sites, all of which were PD-L1 positive. Of the 111 total cases with results, 40 were PD-L1 
negative and 71 were PD-L1 positive. All PD-L1 negative cases were reported with 0% staining (none with <1%IC). 
PD-L1 was positive in a significantly higher percentage of TN cases than non-TN cases (Table 1 and Figure 1). 
Staining in all positive cases ranged from 1-80% (mean 3.9) with only 10 cases (8%) showing >5% IC staining. 
Although higher % IC staining was seen in TN than non-TN tumors, it was not statistically significant.

Conclusions: Most PD-L1 testing from our center was performed in TN tumors on metastases and showed a 
higher rate of positivity than in the IMpassion130 trial. Although not currently FDA approved in this tumor type, non-
TN breast tumors showed a significantly lower rate of PD-L1 positive cases.

Background: Mucinous production can be found in different types of invasive breast carcinoma. Mucinous 
carcinoma is defined as invasive carcinoma with >90% mucinous component, but not all invasive carcinomas with 
>90% mucinous component can be diagnosed as mucinous carcinoma. This study aimed to investigate the 
characteristics of immunohistochemical WT1 expression in invasive breast carcinoma with >90% 
mucinous components and the clinicopathological significance. 
Design: One hundred specimens of invasive breast carcinoma with >90% mucinous component were collected. 
All haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides were reviewed, and the clinicopathological data, including sex, 
age, tumour size, nuclear grade, histological grade, growth pattern, and lymph node (LN) status, were collected. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of WT1 (Wilm’s tumour 1), oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and Ki-67 was performed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH) was used to verify the amplification of the HER2 gene in cases with an IHC score of 2+. The relationship 
between WT1 expression and clinicopathological features was analysed statistically. 
Results: WT1 expression was detected in 67% (67/100) of invasive carcinomas with >90% mucinous components, 
and most (93%) of the positive staining was diffuse and strong. WT1 expression was significantly associated with 
low-intermediate nuclear grade/histological grade, ER and/or PR positivity, negative HER2 status, Ki-67 
proliferation index <30% and no lymph node metastasis (all P<0.001). Micropapillary architecture was observed in 
80% of cases. WT1 expression was not significantly correlated with different percentages of 
micropapillary components (P=0.422). None of the histological grade 3 tumours, tumours with HER2 
overexpression/amplification and triple-negative specimens showed WT1 expression. 
 
 
 
 
166 
Conclusions: WT1 expression was significantly correlated with low-intermediate nuclear/histological grade, ER 
positivity, HER2 negativity, a lower Ki-67 proliferation index and no lymph node metastasis in invasive breast 
carcinoma with >90% mucinous component. The micropapillary growth pattern in this type of tumour did 
not show a specific relationship with WT1 expression.

Background: Breast angiosarcoma (AS) is a rare malignancy which can either be primary or secondary to breast 
cancer treatment. Pathologically, breast AS has a wide spectrum of morphologic presentations, and its diagnosis 
can be challenging based on morphologic evaluation. 
Design: We identified 7 patients with radiation-associated AS (RA-AS) and 3 patients with primary AS (P-AS). Four 
cases of atypical vascular proliferation (AVP), the most common differential diagnosis for AS, were also collected. 
All cases were reviewed by experienced breast pathologists. Relevant clinical information and patient’s 
prognosis were collected from electrical medical records according to institutional review board guidelines. c-MYC 
immunostains were performed for all cases. D2-40 immunostains were also performed for a subset of cases to 
determine their lymphatic differentiation. 
Results: The latency between radiotherapy and AS was 8.1 years. RA-AS mostly occurred in breast dermis, while 
all primary AS involved breast parenchyma. All the 10 AS cases were high grade, and local recurrence or distant 
metastasis were only seen in 4 cases with epithelioid morphology. High-grade P-AS showed a mixture of both low- 
and high-grade lesions (Figure 1A, 1B). Identification of hemorrhage, necrosis or confluent growth classified them 
as high-grade lesions (Figure 1B), though such findings may be present focally. Besides, P-AS did not show 
prominent vesicular nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli (Figure 1C) as seen in RA-AS (Figure 1D). Epithelioid AS 
showed great morphologic overlap with breast carcinoma (Figure 2A). Two epithelioid AS cases showed distinct 
morphology of discohesive cells sloughing off at periphery of vascular cores (Figure 2B), and both of which showed 
lymphatic differentiation by D2-40 positivity. P-AS was either negative for c-MYC or showed rare weak positivity in 
high-grade areas. In comparison, RA-AS were consistently positive for c-MYC (Figure 2C). Besides, epithelioid AS, 
especially cases with lymphatic differentiation, tended to show stronger or more diffuse c-MYC positivity than other 
AS cases (Figure 2D). Morphologically, AVP could show atypical nuclear features with prominent nucleoli, making it 
important to differentiate from low grade AS. However, all cases of AVP were either negative for c-MYC or showed 
only rare weak positivity.

involvement, presence of vesicular nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli, and c-MYC immunoreactivity. Breast AS with 
epithelioid morphology was associated with worse prognosis, and cases with lymphatic differentiation showed 
distinct histologic morphology and tend to have strong or diffuse c-MYC immunoreactivity. c-MYC immunostain is 
helpful in differentiating RA-AS from AVP.

biotherapy treatments require predictive criteria for disease response. In this study we provide additional evidence 
that suggests that primary (PBAS) and secondary (radiation induced) (SBAS) angiosarcomas of breast are distinct 
diseases with different clinicopathologic characteristics, genomic alterations, responses to therapy, and patient 
outcomes. 
Design: The pathology databases of the participating institutions were searched for angiosarcoma of breast from 
2004 - 2020. Only cases for which histological materials and follow-up information were available were included in 
the study. Clinicopathological information was obtained from the medical records.  Statistical analysis was 
performed using Chi-square or t-tests. NGS CARIS was used for genomic analysis. 
Results: 12 cases of PBAS and 12 cases of SBAS fulfilled the study criteria. Clinical, pathologic, and genetic 
features of PBAS and SBAS are summarized in Table 1. Genetic information was available in 4 PBAS and 4 SBAS. 
Important findings include: PBAS and SBAS have statistically significant differences in age at presentation, 
ethnicity, histological grade, hormonal status, response to biotherapy, and outcomes. PBAS and SBAS have 
different mutation profiles.

Conclusions: PBAS and SBAS have different important characteristics indicating that they are biologically distinct 
diseases requiring different forms of therapy. PBAS occur in younger women, often associated with changes in 
hormonal status, are histologically lower grade, but, paradoxically have worse outcomes; mutations 
in PIK3CA and KDR are common.  In contrast, SBCA develop in older women who are status post breast cancer 
and radiation, are histologically high grade, respond to biotherapeutics, have amplification of c-MYC and mutations 
in BRCA1, and have better outcomes.  Additional forms of therapy are needed for patients with breast 
angiosarcoma. Given the distinct clinicopathologic differences between PBAS and SBAS, management strategies 
will need to be specifically tailored for these distinct entities.

Background: Cystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis (CNGM) is a rare cause of mastitis characterized by 
neutrophilic and granulomatous inflammation surrounding cystic spaces, occasionally filled by clusters of gram-
positive Corynebacterium spp. It has been associated with breastfeeding in which the bacterium is postulated to 
gain entry via lactiferous ducts during lactation. CNGM is resistant to medical treatments and can recur even after 
breast resection. We set out to review the clinicopathologic features of CNGM in our institution. 
Design: A retrospective search of breast specimens with a diagnosis of granulomatous inflammation identified 82 
cases from 2010-2020. 77 cases with available H&E slides were reviewed by one resident and two staff breast 
pathologists to reach consensus on the histologically-diagnosed CNGM cohort. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 
(FFPE) tissue blocks were used for PCR-based identification of Corynebacterium by 16S ribosomal RNA (16S 
rRNA) gene sequencing. Clinical and radiological features, and microbiology workup results were retrieved from the 
electronic patient records. 
Results: 34 CNGM cases were identified, all in female patients. The median age was 38.5 years. Most patients 
were multiparous (82%) and had breastfeeding history (65%). Most presented with a unilateral breast mass (97%) 
with size ranging from 1.6 – 8 cm, associated with pain (82%), spontaneous discharge (56%), and skin irritation 
(85%). Culture of tissue aspirate were done on 22 (64.7%) cases and PCR of FFPE tissue were done on all 
cases.  5 (14.7%) CNGM cases demonstrated positive microbiology studies (see Table 1), with 3 cases positive 
for Corynebacterium, 1 case positive for Mycobacterium abscessus and 1 case positive for Staphylococcus 
lugdunensis. On histological examination, 7 cases (21%) demonstrated gram-positive organisms, including all 
cases positive for Corynebacterium. 24 patients (71%) received antibiotic treatment, and 6 patients (18%) also 
received concurrent corticosteroid treatment. Therapeutic drainage was performed in 6 cases (18%), while 1 case 
(3%) underwent resection. Complete resolution was achieved in 21 cases (62%), taking on average 4.6 months. 
However, 3 patients had recurrence in ipsilateral or contralateral breast, with a mean time-to-recurrence of 13 
months. Cases positive for Corynebacterium were more likely to persist and to recur than cases negative 
for Corynebacterium (p=0.062). 
Conclusions: CNGM presents as a painful unilateral breast mass in women of reproductive age

Breast Cancer Harboring KRAS Mutations: A Data Analysis Of 7283 Patients From 
cBioPortal 
Qiqi Ye1, Minghao Zhong2

Disclosures: Qiqi Ye: None; Minghao Zhong: None 
Background: KRAS mutations are highly recurrent in specific common cancers, such as lung and colon, where 
they have important therapeutic implications. The frequency and clinical significance of KRAS mutations in breast 
cancer are still largely unknown. Here we sought to explore the frequency of KRAS mutations and co-occurrence of 
other alterations in invasive breast cancers in cBioportal database. 
Design: All data analysis was performed using https://www.cbioportal.org, which includes 7,283 breast cancers 
from 14 studies.  Breast cancers with KRAS mutations were identified and classified into hotspots or non-hotspot 
mutations. Additional clinico-pathologic information, including hormone receptor and HER2 status and other 
concurrent genetic alterations, was retrieved for each individual case.  
Results: KRAS hotspot mutations were identified in 42 breast cancers (<1%) from 7,283 patients. Of these, 28% 
samples contains G12V mutation while 17% with G12A, 11% with G12D, 9% with G12C, 9% with G12S, 4% with 
G12R, 4% with G13D (4%), and 2% with Q61H (2%). 34 (81%) were estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and HER2-
negative, 6 (14%) were ER/HER2-negative, 2 (5%) were ER /HER2-positive.  A statistically significant co-
occurrence of PIK3CA and KRAS mutations was observed, with 34 (81%) of KRAS-mutant tumors 
harboring PIK3CA mutations.    
Conclusions: Less than 1% of invasive breast cancers harbor KRAS hotspot mutations. The majority (81%) 
of KRAS-mutant breast cancers also harbor PIK3CA mutations, which can be targeted with an FDA-approved PI3K 
inhibitor (alpelisib). Further studies to assess the effect of the presence of KRAS hotspot mutations on PI3K 
pathway activation and response to alpelisib in PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer are warranted.

Background: Although mucinous carcinoma (MC) is considered to be a favorable histologic subtype of invasive 
breast cancer (BC) a subset of MC (high stage, HER2+) is managed with neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). The clinical 
and pathologic features of MC following NAT are not well known. The aim of this study is to characterize pathologic 
response in MC treated with NAT, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and neoadjuvant endocrine therapy 
(NET). 
Design: Our multi-institutional study included 28 MC treated with NAT followed by resection between 2010 and 
2020.  We conducted a pathologic review of the post NAT resection specimens including tumor grading, staging, 
tumor size, residual tumor cellularity, estrogen receptor (ER),and HER2 status. Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) was 
calculated in all cases. Clinical data including age, specific neoadjuvant therapy, and imaging findings were 
reviewed.  
Results: All 28 MC were estrogen receptor (ER)+ ductal carcinoma, of which 11 were HER2+. Nine (32%) 
ER+/HER2- MC received NET, 8(29%) ER+/HER2- MC were treated with NAC only, and 11(39%) HER2+ MC 
received HER2-targeted NAC (H-NAC). The HER2+ MC patients were younger (45 vs. 64 years; p=0.006). The 
HER2+ MC were of higher grade (p=.03) and more likely to be multifocal (p=0.008). Only 2 of 28(7%) MC (both 
HER2+) showed complete pathologic response with residual acellular mucin pools (Figure 1A). Persistent mass-
forming mucin pools were present in 26(93%) cases. The residual tumor cellularity was markedly reduced (≤ 5%) 
in H-NAC treated MC (11/11, 100%), followed by NET group (6/9, 67%) (Figure 1B) and NAC only group 
(4/8, 50%)(p=0.011). Similarly, a higher rate of pathologic response (pCR/RCB-I) was observed in H-NAC (7/11, 
64%), followed by NET group (5/9, 56%), and NAC only group (1/7, 13%) (p=0.053). Post-therapy, all HER2+ MC 
were smaller than 2 cm and ypT size was significantly smaller in H-NAC group (11/11, 100%) versus combined 
NET (5/9, 55%) and NAC only groups (4/8, 50%) (p=0.029).

Conclusions: Mucinous carcinomas of the breast show variable response to neoadjuvant therapy. Best  response 
is noted to HER2 targeted therapy (in HER2+ MC), followed by NET only, with least response to non-HER2 
targeted NAC. We also report that MC after NET demonstrate marked reduction in cellularity, which is in contrast to 
the therapy response to NET in non-mucinous tumors. These findings need to be confirmed in a larger cohort study 
of mucinous and non-mucinous carcinomas of the breast.

Background: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a subtype of metaplastic breast carcinoma. Its clinicopathological 
features and prognostic factors are not well recognized due to its rarity. There is no unified histological grading 
system of SCC and the response of neoadjuvant treatment is still unclear. To improve the understanding of this 
group of tumors, 39 cases were analyzed. 
Design: 25 pure SCC and 14 mixed SCC from 2007–2020 in our center were analyzed. In mixed cases, the 
proportion of SCC was more than 50%. A three-tied grading system for esophageal SCC was applied for 
histological grading. Seven patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the histological response was 
assessed according to Miller-Payne grading (MPG) system. Ten pure cases were sequenced by DIAN (Hangzhou 
Lab) using a 324-gene platform (Foundation One CDx) with licensed technologies. Survival analysis was performed 
using SPSS version 16.0 software.   
Results: All cases were female ranging from 33 to 83 years (median 53 years). The mean diameter of tumor was 
32.5 (10-70) mm and the median disease-free survival (DFS) was 22 (2-139) months. At the time of diagnosis, half 
of the patients (18/39, 46.2%) reached stage IIA and ten patients (10/39, 25.6%) had lymph node metastasis. 
Recurrence and/or distant metastasis occurred in eight patients (8/39, 20.5%) after 4-46 months’ (median 18.5 
months) follow-up. The most common site of recurrence was chest wall and the most common metastatic site was 
lung and bone respectively. According to our assessment，most of cases (30/39, 76.9%) were grade 2 (moderately 
differentiated) and nine cases (9/39, 23.1%) were classified as grade 3 (poorly differentiated). In both univariate 
and multivariate analysis, poor differentiation was associated significantly with reduced DFS (P = 0.008, P = 
0.017<0.05). Age, laterality, tumor size, axillary lymph node metastasis, stage and treatment had no significant 
effect in our analysis (P>0.05). None of the seven patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy achieved 
pathological complete remission and all of them underwent modified radical mastectomy. According to the MPG 
system, two cases achieved grade 1, four cases achieved grade 2 and one case achieved grade 3. Most SCC were 
triple negative, but four (4/39, 10.3%) in our series showed HER2 amplification, the significance of HER2-targeted 
treatment in HER2-positive SCC was still unclear due to the limitation of cases and follow-up time. High frequency 
pathogenic mutations of TP53 (8/10, 80%) and PIK3CA (7/10, 70%) in SCC were observed which might have 
potential implication for targeted therapy.

Conclusions: According to our research, the degree of differentiation is an independent prognostic factor of SCC. 
Neoadjuvant therapy should not be given priority in initial treatment decisions. The high frequency 
of PIK3CA mutation suggests the role of PIK3CA inhibitors in SCC.
