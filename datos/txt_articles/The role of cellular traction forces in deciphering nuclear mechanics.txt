The role of cellular traction forces 
in deciphering nuclear mechanics

Abstract 
Cellular forces exerted on the extracellular matrix (ECM) during adhesion and migration under physiological and path‑
ological conditions regulate not only the overall cell morphology but also nuclear deformation. Nuclear deformation 
can alter gene expression, integrity of the nuclear envelope, nucleus-cytoskeletal connection, chromatin architecture, 
and, in some cases, DNA damage responses. Although nuclear deformation is caused by the transfer of forces from 
the ECM to the nucleus, the role of intracellular organelles in force transfer remains unclear and a challenging area of 
study. To elucidate nuclear mechanics, various factors such as appropriate biomaterial properties, processing route, 
cellular force measurement technique, and micromanipulation of nuclear forces must be understood. In the initial 
phase of this review, we focused on various engineered biomaterials (natural and synthetic extracellular matrices) and 
their manufacturing routes along with the properties required to mimic the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, 
we discussed the principle of tools used to measure the cellular traction force generated during cell adhesion and 
migration, followed by recently developed techniques to gauge nuclear mechanics. In the last phase of this review, 
we outlined the principle of traction force microscopy (TFM), challenges in the remodeling of traction forces, micro‑
bead displacement tracking algorithm, data transformation from bead movement, and extension of 2-dimensional 
TFM to multiscale TFM.

Background
The transfer of mechanical forces from the extracellu-
lar matrix (ECM) to the cell not only affects the nuclear 
shape and cytoskeletal reorganization but also gene 
expression and remodeling of nuclear chromatins [1–6]. 
During cellular mechanosensation, cells respond to 
mechanical stimuli in their environment that in turn 
regulates important processes in normal as well as dis-
eased states [7–10]. Cells in the body are subjected to 
different mechanical stresses, such as compression (in 
the bones and other tissues), shear stress (by blood flow), 
and tensile stresses (due to muscle stretching), and can 
be interpreted in the context of mechanobiology [11–14]. 
Under physiological and pathological conditions, these 
mechanical forces are involved in inter- and intracellular 
functions [15]. Forces transferred from the cytoskeleton 
to the nucleus and correct positioning of the nucleus 
during cell migration are highly orchestrated because of 
the nuclear dimension and its resistance to deformation. 
These forces are generated by cellular organelles, such as 
filament polymerization, actomyosin contraction, and 
microtubule motors, which apply shearing, pulling, and 
compression forces on the nucleus; occasionally, these 
forces can rupture nuclear membranes [16, 17].
Nuclear forces are quantified by measuring the 
mechanical properties of subnuclear structures, includ-
ing nuclear lamina, chromatin, nuclear matrix, and 
nuclear bodies [18]. To understand and measure cell and 
nuclear mechanics, a rheological approach that deals

with how materials deform or flow in response to an 
applied mechanical force has been applied. The physical 
changes in nuclear properties, shape, and viscoelastic-
ity are due to the combined effect of cytoskeletal forces, 
composition of the nuclear envelope, and chromatin 
structure. Recently, chromatin has emerged as a key con-
tributor to overall nuclear stiffness in cancer cells [19].
Determining cell adhesion, migration, and invasion 
phenotypes of the cell, along with understanding the 
fundamental molecular mechanisms in the diagnosis, 
treatment, and drug development, depends largely upon 
ECM modeling and their fabrication route, techniques 
used, experimental design, and the errors associated with 
them. Numerous experimental methods, including sim-
ple washing assays, spinning discs, and flow chambers, 
have been used to study cell adhesion and migration. 
Atomic force microscopy (AFM), micropipettes, parti-
cle tracking, magnetic bead microrheology, and cellular 
deformation by optical force and fluidic shear stress have 
been applied to the single cells [20].
The aim of this review is to explore the various types 
of ECM used in mechanobiology and the challenges 
faced in achieving these approaches. Subsequently, we 
reviewed the various forces transferred from the ECM 
that are experienced by cells and the practical techniques 
used to measure them during cell adhesion and migra-
tion. We also reviewed the principles, advances, chal-
lenges, and various errors associated with traction force 
microscopy (TFM) in single-cell systems.
The role of ECM in subcellular mechanics
Engineered ECM
The ECM is a 3-dimensional (D) matrix network that 
provides structural support and stability to organs and 
generates and transfers signals from one part of the 
body to another. Treating certain diseases requires ECM 
remodeling as it plays a crucial role in cellular activities 
and can be targeted as a therapeutic strategy [21]. The 
signal generated from the interaction of cells with the 
ECM is fundamentally dependent on molecular func-
tions and cellular phenotypes [22]. Thus, for the selec-
tion of suitable biomaterials that adequately reproduce 
in vivo tissue conditions, it is important to consider their 
biocompatibility to determine whether the biomate-
rial generates an adverse reaction in the body as well as 
physiological aspects of materials such as degradation 
kinetics and mechanical properties, e.g., elasticity, tensile 
strength, elongation, and hardness [23–27].
Previous studies have revealed that the mechanical 
properties of the ECM directly affect the regulation of 
cell function [28]. The available natural ECM matrices, 
such as collagen, chitosan, fibrin, gelatin, alginate, and 
hyaluronic acid, have a sophisticated system composed of 
water, proteins, and polysaccharides with unique topol-
ogy and composition that together provide the correct 
chemical, biological, and mechanical environment for 
cells [29–31]. Primary cells and tissues are the two pri-
mary sources of natural ECM. Human and animal tissues 
are widely used to manufacture natural ECM products 
[32, 33]. The fibers and large number of pores in the ECM 
generate a low-concentration stiff matrix that allows the 
migration of cells, whereas the complex stiffness of the 
ECM causes stress or strain stiffening [34].
Engineered biomaterial-based ECM can induce desir-
able cell-specific responses to mimic tumors and their 
microenvironment [35]. Many researchers have used the 
ECM to study cell behavior during stem cell prolifera-
tion and differentiation [36, 37] and disease progression 
[38]. The ECM is highly heterogeneous and composed 
of fiber-forming and non-fiber-forming proteins, such as 
collagens and elastic fibers, proteoglycans, glycosamino-
glycans, and soluble factors [39–41]. Organ-specific cells 
bind to the ECM via surface receptors to activate cell 
responses including growth, migration, proliferation, and 
differentiation [42].
While designing an ECM to mimic tumors and their 
microenvironment, ECM protein coating, electrospin-
ning, hydrogels, and 3D bioprinting techniques are often 
applied [41]. 3D printing techniques usually use organic 
solvents, high temperatures, or crosslinking agents, 
which are harsh for the biological ECMs. Therefore, an 
appropriate printing material with superior biocompat-
ibility, printability, desired degradation, and mechanical 
properties should be selected [43]. Natural ECM shows 
excellent biocompatibility but weak mechanical proper-
ties despite its crosslinking characteristics. On the other 
hand, the properties of synthetic materials such as poly-
etheretherketone (PEEK), polycaprolactone (PCL), poly-
ethylene glycol (PEG), and polylactic acid (PLA) can 
be easily manipulated to suit experimental needs [44]; 
however, their poor biocompatibility, lack of bioactive 
ligands, and toxic degradation render 3D printing more 
complex [45].
Synthetic hydrogels have proved useful to culture 
primary cells in 2D and 3D microenvironments and to 
test the role of ECM in the regulation of cell function. 
Water-soluble polymers such as PEG, poly(2- hydroxy-
ethyl methacrylate), and polyvinyl alcohol are synthetic 
crosslinkers forming elastic materials that can be used 
to mimic ECM mechanics with cells [46]. Various types 
of synthetic ECM and their properties have been exten-
sively reported [47–51] (Fig.  1). Characteristics such 
as elasticity, morphology, wettability, and viscosity of 
the substrate and surface materials need to be consid-
ered when designing materials to study cell behavior 
[52]. Morphology, spreading, and cellular forces mainly

depend on the elasticity of the hydrogel [53]. Report-
edly, PEG hydrogel viscosity affects the morphology, 
migration, proliferation, etc. of human mesenchy-
mal stem cells (hMSC), during tissue engineering and 
regenerative applications [54].
According to a study conducted in the late 1990s using 
polyacrylamide hydrogels with varying elastic moduli, 
cell-ECM adhesion, spreading, and cell migration over a 
cell-cultured substrate are greatly affected by substrate 
stiffness [55]. The mesh size of the hydrogel also affects 
its behavior. Cell migration efficiency is improved by 
employing hydrogels with smaller mesh sizes, owing 
to the increased migration speed [56]. In addition, the 
nanotopography of the ECM substrate is an important 
characteristic that affects cell behavior. Recently, to fur-
ther determine how topography affects cell behavior, var-
ious geometric combinations, including vertical fillers, 
island/pits, pillars/wells, and groves, have been fabricated 
on rigid substrates using etching and cutting operations 
[57–59].
Biophysical assessment of cell mechanics
The common mechanical modes of forces are stretching, 
compressive, and shear forces as well as forces derived 
from surface tension continuously experienced by cells 
in vivo [60, 61]. The stress and strain experienced by 
cells on hydrogel surfaces are important for studying cell 
dynamics. The magnitude of the force experienced by the 
cell depends on the type of deformation experienced by 
the hydrogel when subjected to external stress. In gen-
eral, tension, compression, torsion, and shear stresses 
are experienced by cells owing to the deformation of 
the hydrogel (ECM) during pulling, pushing, twisting, 
and shearing. There are two types of strain deformation 
based on different loading modes and the amount of 
force produced: plastic and elastic. Elastic deformation 
is recoverable compared with plastic deformation, and 
these deformations of the hydrogel depend on the char-
acteristics (stiffness, viscosity, etc.) and properties (bio-
compatibility, toxicity, etc.) of the ECM (Fig. 2) [62]. In 
this section, we summarize various methods to study the 
Fig. 1  Available synthetic extracellular matrix (ECM). Various types of synthetic extracellular matrix biomaterials and their properties that mimic

mechanical properties of cells embedded in deformable 
hydrogels.
The micropipette aspiration (MA) system uses micro-
injection to create suction pressure in a capillary, where 
the cell is directly contacted by a microneedle or a micro-
capillary under a microscope. MA measures cellular 
viscosity by measuring the negative pressure needed to 
maintain the suction length and is capable of measuring 
forces in the range of 10 pN–1 nN [63]. This technique 
is useful for measuring changes in the cell shape and vis-
cosity of single cells [64]. Magnetic tweezer-based meas-
urement involves non-invasive manipulation of magnetic

particles, e.g., a superparamagnetic ­Fe2O3 nanoparticle-
embedded polymer matrix attached to a biological entity 
via an external magnetic field. The magnetic particle posi-
tions were tracked in a magnetic field using a microscope. 
Magnetic tweezers can measure forces of up to 100 pN 
[65]. The optical tweezer method relies on the concept 
that light changes its path when it passes through two 
different mediums with different refractive indices. Dur-
ing the experimentation process, the small particles are 
attached to the cell membrane and pulled away from the 
cell, creating a tethered membrane; light passing through 
a pulled cell changes direction (i.e., refraction) and alters 
momentum [66]. The intercellular forces measured with 
optical tweezers have been reported to be in the range 
of 50–300 pN [67]. Owing to their ability to control the 
cellular microenvironment, microfluidic and organ-
on-a-chip systems have become powerful tools for cell 
biologists. For instance, a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-
based transparent microfluidic compression device was 
designed by employing a self-adhesive to evaluate the 
cellular deformation of cells using optical microscopy 
[68], which was applied to control the magnitude of the 
applied pressure to inflict compressive strain and evalu-
ate Young’s modulus in the range of 3.5–4.2 kPa.
Among various cellular force measurement techniques, 
AFM has been the most conventionally utilized tech-
nique because it can characterize mechanical properties, 
including the elasticity and viscoelasticity of multiple cell 
types [69–73]. The accuracy of AFM results depends on 
the type of tip; generally, AFM using a spherical probe is 
utilized to measure whole-cell properties, owing to the 
low elastic modulus of cells. AFM has also been used to 
measure cell-substrate adhesion by modifying the AFM 
cantilever. However, this technique is tedious and some-
times very difficult to estimate whether the cell-substrate 
interaction is stronger than that of the cell cantilever.
Recently, fluidic force microscopy was applied to study 
single-cell mechanics and cell-to-material adhesion 
using a fluidic force fluid tip positioned with an AFM tip 
holder [61]. Subsequently, negative pressure was applied 
to attach the cell to the cantilever, and by applying force 
to the cell on the cantilever, the force was sensed using 
a standard feedback sensor, i.e., an AFM laser detection 
system. Another group also combined the AFM with 
optical tracking to study viscosity and elastic compo-
nents using 3T3 fibroblast cells [74]. For this experiment, 
the authors used micrometer beads attached to an AFM 
tip and indented it on the cell surface ranging from 0.2–
1.2 μm in depth. The cellular response corresponding to a 
lower force range (10–30 pN), measured using the opti-
cal track technique, showed a reversible elastic response 
owing to the conversion of the viscous effect into the 
apparent elastic modulus.
Researchers have also used the finite element modeling 
(FEM) to estimate the elasticity of a cell by comparing 
it with the results obtained using AFM, comparing the 
force-indentation depth response of the cell, and predict-
ing the intercellular force transduction and distribution 
[75]. Nanoindentation is another AFM method. While 
the modulus map obtained from conventional AFM is 
higher than that obtained from nanoindentation [76], the 
latter enables depth sensing that recodes load (P), depth 
(d), and time (t). This apparatus allows for controlled 
indentation force and displacement and is particularly 
useful for live cells and subcellular components [69].
In addition to the abovementioned techniques, micro-
pillar-based devices and TFM-based techniques have 
been utilized. In micropillar-based techniques, differ-
ent grades (e.g., sparse and dense zones) of micropillar-
coated substrates have been developed [77], in which 
cells in the sparse zone are more aligned along the direc-
tion of the micropillar spacing gradient. In another study, 
a poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) polymeric micro-
pillar array with an appropriate dimension was used to 
study the changes in the shape of mesenchymal stem cells 
over time [78]. In a recent study, magneto-active micro-
pillar arrays (poly(n-butylacrylate)) were fabricated by 
mixing prepolymers with magnetic iron oxide nanopar-
ticles [79], where the pillar surface was designed in such 
a way that its top faces attracted the cells, and the other 
side of the pillar wall along with the area between the 
pillars was covered with a cell-repelling hydrogel layer. 
Accordingly, pillar deflection owing to magnetic stimula-
tion generates traction forces on the adherent cells.
Another technique for measuring the cell-generated 
force exerted by a cell lying on a soft surface is the 3D 
TFM, an important force measurement technique that 
works on the knowledge of the displacement-force, elas-
tic modulus, and mechanical properties of the substrate 
[80]. These cell-generated traction forces deform the soft 
substrate and lead to the formation of a deformation field. 
In the TFM experiments, cells were cultivated on fluores-
cent microsphere bead-embedded ECM-mimicking sub-
strates to investigate the cell-generating traction forces 
by measuring the change in bead displacement (refer to 
the details of TFM in Sect. 3).
Recently, image-based mechanical analysis techniques, 
such as coherent optical methods of stress analysis and 
electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) have 
been used by many researchers [81]. According to Harris 
and colleagues, when cells are cultured on a soft elastic 
substrate like a thin sheet of silicon, they exert a trac-
tion force responsible for elastic distortion and wrinkling 
of the substrate [82]. Individual wrinkles change during 
cell migration owing to changes in cellular forces and 
can be detected using a machine learning approach [83].

They constructed a machine learning system by obtain-
ing TFM images and comparing them with cell-generated 
wrinkle images using a convolution neural network. They 
reported that the trained model was able to predict the 
cellular force using microscopy images alone.
Deciphering nuclear mechanics
Understanding nuclear mechanics is crucial for many 
diseases such as cancer and premature aging syndrome 
[19]. During cell division, migration, and differentiation 
in eukaryotic cells, the nucleus is actively positioned at 
specific locations within the cytoplasm [84]. During cell 
migration in confinement, the nucleus deforms when the 
cell passes through a small constriction. The estimation of 
the force required to deform the nucleus is an important 
question to be addressed [85]. The direction of cell migra-
tion is specified by the position of the nucleus within the 
cell, which is usually positioned towards the rear. There-
fore, it is also important to comprehensively understand 
the complex roles of focal adhesion, the cytoskeleton, and 
their connection to the nucleus for proper cell migration. 
During cell migration in vivo, cells need to pass through 
the 3D ECM system, where all intracellular components, 
including the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and intra-
cellular structures, deform the nucleus, which is a gigan-
tic organelle generally larger than the pore size.
The transfer of force from the ECM through the 
cytoskeleton can deform the nucleus. The external forces 
applied to the ECM were transmitted to the nucleus via 
the cytoplasm and analyzed mechanically using the Kel-
vin–Voigt model (K–V). In the K–V mechanical model, 
the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus are con-
nected in series and each represents a spring (elasticity) 
and damper (viscosity) (Fig.  2A) [86]. The viscoelastic 
and elastic nature of the nucleus protects genetic mate-
rial from applied forces [87] and improves the flexibility 
of cell motility through the constricted region [88]. The 
amount of force transferred from the ECM to the nucleus 
(causing nuclear deformation) depends on the magnitude 
of elasticity and viscosity of the cell and ECM. Cellular 
and nuclear elasticity and viscosity play important roles 
in cellular mechanics [86]. The large magnitude of these 
forces can generate large deformations in the nucleus 
and cause uncontrolled nucleus–cytoplasm content 
exchange, loss of nuclear envelope content, DNA dam-
age, and sometimes cell death [88].
The ECM microenvironment propagates forces into 
the nucleus through the LINC (linker of nucleoskeleton 
and cytoskeleton) complex, which connects the nucleus 
to cytoskeleton [89]. Unwanted extracellular forces and 
defective forces disrupt the LINC complex, which later 
disrupts micro-sensitive gene expression. This transfer 
of force from the cytoskeleton regulates nuclear shape 
and orientation. Recent studies have revealed that the 
accumulation of aberrant actin fibers around the nucleus 
could induce actin-dependent nuclear deformation, caus-
ing nuclear tension and leading to herniation, blebbing, 
and sometimes nuclear envelope rupture [90]. Actin 
fibers play an important role not only in coordinating 
intricate architecture but also in protecting genetic infor-
mation [91]. Because the nucleus is generally considered 
to be 5–10 times stiffer than the cytoskeleton, the struc-
tural change in the nucleus envelope and chromatin due 
to external mechanical loading depends on the stiffness 
of the nucleus and surrounding cytoskeleton [92]. In 
addition to structural changes in the nuclear envelope, 
chromatin- and cytoskeleton-mediated changes can also 
be induced by tailoring the mechanical properties of the 
nuclear envelope.
Recently, the relationship between the expression of 
nuclear lamin A scaled with tissue stiffness and matrix 
rigidity-dependent cell differentiation showed that 
increasing substrate stiffness increases lamin A and C 
levels in MSCs and myosin II contractility [93]. Moreo-
ver, alterations in nuclear morphology, lamin A/C expres-
sion, and epigenetic modifications were induced by 
changes in the tensile force arising from the cultivation of 
fibroblast cells on fibronectin-coated micropatterns [94].
The structure of the nucleus and its mechanics change 
in various human diseases, and there is a functional 
relationship between cellular dysfunction and nuclear 
morphology. Cell nuclei are the largest organelles and 
are subjected to continuous mechanical loading, such 
as tensile, shear, and compressive stress, which regulate 
signaling pathways, cytoskeleton remodeling, and mus-
culoskeletal function within multicellular organisms [95]. 
To understand the external force transmission mecha-
nism from the ECM, understanding the connection 
between each component from the nucleus to the ECM 
is an important aspect to study. Transmembrane protein 
integrin is a bi-directional signaling receptor that forms 
a link between the interior of the cell and its extracel-
lular environment as well as forms an adhesion site (by 
anchoring the cell with ECM) [96, 97]. The other side of 
integrin is attached to the cytoskeleton tensile member 
(actin filaments) through the focal adhesion complex. 
The actin filament structure inside the cytoplasm holds 
the nucleus and is responsible for maintaining the shape 
of the cell (when cells are spread over the ECM). Sub-
sequently, these forces from the cytoskeleton propagate 
to the nuclear surface from integrin receptors with the 
help of F-actin. External forces are transferred from the 
ECM to the plasma membrane and stimulate the force-
sensitive opening of ion channels. The transfer of forces 
from the cell surface to the nucleus by applying tensile 
forces to the endothelial cell surface was confirmed by 
Page 7 of 17

observing the nuclear envelope distortion [98]. Accord-
ing to a study conducted on MSCs, when external ten-
sile forces are applied to the ECM, changes in chromatin 
organization condensation stiffen the MSC nucleus and 
reduce its deformability against externally applied tensile 
stretch [99]. We previously reported that 1 h of uniaxial 
cyclic stretch alters the 3D shape of the nucleus (Fig. 2B) 
[100], whereas nuclear flattening stretches the pores of 
the nucleus and decreases the mechanical passages for 
molecular transport, resulting in the accumulation of 
the mechanosensitive transcription factor YAP in the 
nucleus [101].
During cancer metastasis, cells migrate through nar-
row constricted channels, which causes nuclear dis-
tortion. The compression forces transferred from the 
ECM significantly decrease nuclear height, and increase 
nucleus area. These dimensional changes due to external 
ECM forces produce a volumetric strain in the nucleus. 
(Fig. 2C).
In the case of ECM subjected to shearing force, cells in 
the body (generated from blood flow or interstitial flow) 
sense shear stress via a series of receptors and play a criti-
cal role in modulating cell function [102]. These receptors 
transmit mechanical signals through mechanosensitive 
pathways and regulate the cell morphology. Under shear 
stress, endothelial cells are elongated, and their stress 
fibers are aligned along the direction of fluid flow. In an 
experimental study on the measurement of shear defor-
mation of fibroblast cells using an on-chip TFM, various 
stages of deformation were studied. In the first stage of 
deformation, the flowing fluid applied stress over the top 
layer of the cell surface (plasma membrane), spread the 
cell, and was responsible for the cell and nucleus defor-
mation. In the second stage of deformation, these fluid 
dynamic forces provided rotation from the leading side of 
the cells and started peeling off the rear side of the cell 
(Fig. 2D). In the third stage of deformation, cells detached 
from the ECM. These fluid shear stress (FSS) (unit N/m2 
or dynes/cm2) is expressed as the product of the shear 
rate and viscosity of the fluid [103]. Cells in laminar fluid 
shear are responsible for cell elongation, suppression of 
proliferation, cytoskeleton organization, and redistribu-
tion of focal adhesions. The nucleus inside the cell expe-
riences forces transferred from the ECM during external 
loading conditions, causing deformation of the nucleus 
[104, 105]. In an experimental study in which Madin-
Darby canine kidney cells were subjected to FSS (1.1 
dynes/cm2) in a microfluid channel, an approximately 
50% reduction of nuclear area was reported [106].
The transmission of forces from the ECM to the 
nucleus depends on the magnitude of forces applied to 
the ECM. The viscosity and elasticity of the ECM and 
cytoplasm absorb the transfer of forces from the ECM 
to the nucleus. In an experimental study conducted by 
researchers to characterize the anisotropic deforma-
tion of NIH 3T3 cell nuclei in response to extracellular 
forces by quantitative measurement of nuclear strains, 
it was reported that nuclear anisotropy properties 
may provide a direct mechanism to transfer force via 
the ECM to the genome [16]. The deformation mode 
depends on the type of loading experienced by the cell. 
In one study, the authors measured the extreme defor-
mation of the nucleus during cell migration in the con-
finement space (Fig. 2C). When cells pass through this 
confinement region, the nucleus has to deform, and the 
deformed shape of the nucleus can be easily explained 
using experimental images. The degree of deformation 
in the nucleus inversely depends on the confinement 
size. However, direct experimental measurement of 
the minimum forces required to deform the nucleus is 
extremely difficult [85]. The use of hybrid microfluidic 
and TFM techniques can be a better solution for meas-
uring the forces that cause nuclear deformation.
The externally applied forces induce a response 
within the cell to the nucleus and are responsible for 
the change in cell behavior and cell fate [107]. In an 
experimental study on mammary carcinoma cells under 
compression stress, compression stress accumulation 
during tumor growth prevented the migration of cancer 
cells by enhancing cell-substrate adhesion [108]. When 
cells undergo sharing forces by applying fluid flow, 
they impinge on human MSCs and regulate cell fate by 
regulating stem cell differentiation via the contractil-
ity of the stem cells [109]. Neural stem and progenitor 
cells subjected to 10% static equiaxial stretch specifi-
cally affect differentiation, and this effect is dependent 
on ECM integrin linkage [110]. A study on embryonic 
stem cells (ESC) investigated the relationship between 
shape mechanics and cell fate. They found that shape 
change is regulated by a catenin-mediated decrease in 
RhoA activity, which decreases plasma membrane ten-
sion and results in early differentiation defects in ESC 
[111].
Nuclear mechanics can be studied either within cells 
or by isolating the nucleus from cells. Nucleus isolation 
studies allow stress to be applied directly to the nucleus 
rather than to the cytoplasm [112]. Experimental meth-
ods for measuring nuclear properties by isolating cells 
increase uncertainty regarding the effects of the chemi-
cal environment. MA, AFM, substrate strain testing, 
and particle tracking microrheology techniques have 
also been used by many researchers (Fig. 3) [113–116].
Therefore, accumulating evidence supports that 
externally applied tensile forces propagate along the 
cytoplasmic filament and are transmitted to the nuclear

mately regulating the nuclear forces.

ECM is known as cell adhesion that plays a fundamen-
tal role in the maintenance and development of tissues 
[95]. The mechanical force experienced by cell–cell and 
cell-ECM junctions stretches, aligns, bends, and repo-
sitions tissues and regulates cell functions, including 
signaling, differentiation, proliferation, pattern forma-
tion, and migration [117]. Changes in cell adhesion are 
responsible for a wide range of diseases, including oste-
oporosis [118], atherosclerosis [119], arthritis [120], 
and cancer [121]. For example, adhesion between blood 
cells and platelets leads to heart failure owing to the 
formation of blood clots, restricting the blood supply to 
the heart muscles [122].
Mechanotransduction, the conversion of mechanical 
signals into biochemical responses, requires integrins, 
myosin motors, cytoskeletal filaments, nuclei, and ECM 
to generate forces during cell migration [123, 124]. Cells 
continuously apply various forces such as pushing, pull-
ing, and shearing on the ECM, which determine cell 
migration and tissue morphogenesis. These forces not 
only trigger signaling pathways but also guide mechanical 
and structural events under both physiological and path-
ological conditions [125]. According to recent studies on 
the force-motion relationship [126], there are four differ-
ent types of forces: internal forces, inertial forces, forces 
from fluid, and forces from the ECM. Many research-
ers have reported techniques for studying cell adhesion 
such as 1) simple washing, 2) spinning disks, and 3) flow 
chambers (Fig. 4).

A simple washing technique was used to measure weak 
cell adhesion, whereas a minimal shear force was applied 
to the fluid to remove nonadherent cells. This technique 
is easy to perform by applying a defined amount of shear 
force to the fluid to measure cell adhesion on different 
ECM substrates [127]. The cells were cultured on differ-
ent ECM substrates using the spinning disk technique for 
cell adhesion measurements. The culture dish was then

mounted over a spinning disk and rotated at a defined 
revolution per minute (RPM), and cell adhesion with dif-
ferent substrates was quantified before and after rotation 
using optical microscopy [128]. In another study, PDMS 
was used to construct a flow channel device with dimen-
sions of 20 × 1000 × 160 mm, and inlet and outlet tubing 
were attached to the two extreme ends of the rectangular 
channel [129]. Cells were then seeded inside the cham-
ber and exposed to different experimental conditions: no 
flow for 60 min and 330 mL/s for 30 min, and the cells 
were counted under different conditions using an optical 
microscope.
The abovementioned techniques cannot measure sin-
gle-cell specific adhesion, and quantification of the exact 
shear stress force is difficult; therefore, their applications 
are limited only to weakly adherent cells. Single-cell force 
spectroscopy and biomembrane force probes have been 
developed to overcome these issues.
An AFM probe is used to physically detach the individ-
ual cell from an open medium, and the detachment force 
is quantified by measuring the deflection of the probe 
used to detach the cell divided by the cell area [130]; in 
single-cell force spectroscopy, image-based cell adhesion 
is quantified at the single-cell level. This technique uses a 
microscope to capture the cell and its structure, mechan-
ics of isolated biomolecules, subcellular cytoskeleton, and 
components of the nucleus in assistance with nano- and 
micro-manipulators to determine the mechanical prop-
erties of various cell types [131–133]. The biomembrane 
force probe is a sensitive and feasible experimental tech-
nique that allows quantification of single-molecule bonds 
and is used to measure force in the range of 0.1 pN to 1 
nN with a loading rate of 1–106 pN/s [134].
Other experimental techniques, such as micropillar- 
and embedded sensor-based techniques, have been used 
by many researchers [60, 135]. Of these techniques, how-
ever, TFM remains the most widely used technique for 
measuring cell traction forces for its versatile applications 
[136, 137].
Working principle of traction force microscopy
Adherent cells must attach to a suitable substrate or ECM 
for their growth and survival. During cell adhesion, cells 
apply traction forces generated by actomyosin contractil-
ity to the ECM owing to the mechanical balance between 
internal forces and adhesion structures, which is neces-
sary for a variety of biological processes [138–140]. TFM 
is a well-established technique used by biophysicists to 
measure the traction force generated by adherent cells in 
the ECM microenvironment [141]. In this technique, we 
directly measured the spatially resolved interfacial force 
of a cell cultured on a soft gel-like ECM by quantifying 
and analyzing soft gel deformation.
Harris et al. [82] first reported the experimental TFM 
concept. They demonstrated the wrinkling and elastic 
deformation of a thin polymeric silicon substrate when 
cells migrated on it. The conversion of the wrinkle pattern 
into traction force is not simple; additionally, this method 
is considered qualitative and is not currently used. Recent 
TFMs use optical microscopy to capture cell images, fol-
lowed by image processing and force modeling. Nonethe-
less, the TFM is used to measure the forces exerted by 
cells on a soft deformable ECM. To quantify cell-gener-
ated forces, tiny fluorescent beads are embedded inside 
the soft ECM substrate. When a cell exerts force on the 
ECM, these beads deform and act as displacement mark-
ers. The positions of these markers were recorded using 
a microscope during cell attachment and detachment 
[142]. The differential deformation of these tiny fluores-
cent beads in the two states provides the displacement 
field determined using a tracking algorithm such as parti-
cle image velocimetry (PIV), particle tracking technique, 
image J plugin, and MATLAB combined software pack-
age. Later, these displacement data were used to model 
the traction stresses and strain experienced by the ECM 
owing to cellular force by applying a set of mechanical 
property data and constraint boundary conditions [143] 
(Fig.  5). Despite their advantages, TFM techniques are 
affected by many factors, such as the selection of fluo-
rescent microbead size and type, insertion of beads into 
the hydrogel, volume of microbeads in the hydrogel, and 
quality of microscopy images [143]. As these are directly 
related to the TFM results, it is important to determine 
the sources of errors associated with the different steps of 
the TFM (Fig. 5).
Recently, 
many 
fundamental 
and 
technological 
advancements in TFM have been made to control bio-
chemical responses and mechanotransduction at the 
cell–matrix interface as well as the mechanobiology 
behind the results. Therefore, a new artificial intelligence 
algorithm using machine learning to calculate the cellular 
force distribution from microscopy images has also been 
utilized [83]. In the first phase of their study, cells were 
cultured on an elastic substrate, and the cellular traction 
corresponding to the substrate wrinkle was measured, 
followed by the measurement of the traction force using 
TFM. Subsequently, the wrinkle position was captured 
using a microscope, and the machine learning algorithm 
was trained using a set of two images: extracted wrin-
kle images and raw microscopy images as training data 
for the generative adversarial network. The network was 
subsequently used to predict the cellular force from the 
input images after sufficient training. Moreover, con-
focal TFM has been developed [144], which involves 
the electrohydrodynamic nano-drip printing of quan-
tum dots over spin-coated highly deformable silicone in 
Page 11 of 17

the form of an array. As adherent cells generated forces 
and deformed the fibronectin-coated substrate, causing 
distortion of the nano-printed quantum dots, changes 
in the microscopic image of the deformable substance 
before and after deformation were measured using image 
processing.
Traction forces were remodeled using a standard TFM 
process. Another research group developed a high-reso-
lution TFM technique based on an optical flow-tracking 
algorithm that directly measured bead deformation with 
an improved TFM accuracy of > 35% [145]. Two-dimen-
sional total internal reflection fluorescence structured 
illumination microscopy (TIRF-SIM) and 2D TIRF-SIM-
TFM were also developed by combining the TFM with 
a fast, super-resolution high numerical aperture [146]. 
They used a particle imaging velocimetry (PIV)-based 
simulation technique combined with live-cell experi-
ments. The combination of magnetic tweezers with TFM 
further improved the TFM accuracy [147]. They used a 
magnetic tweezer to apply controlled force or displace-
ment to a fibronectin-coated superparamagnetic bead 
attached to a collagen gel containing red fluorescent 
microspheres. Time-lapse imaging was used to cap-
ture the displacement of magnetic beads and micro-
spheres. Finally, they illustrated how the control-mode 
bead on the hydrogel would be useful for calculating 
the Young’s modulus of the substrate. These approaches 
demonstrated that the TFM could measure the force 
experienced by cancer cells [148], where they used a 
nanometer-scale resolution for particle marker displace-
ment using holographic tracking microscopy.

taken in after (relaxed) and before (stresses) states using trypsin. In microbead tracking, the difference in microbead positions in stressed and 
relaxed states was measured by employing image processing using MATLAB algorithm. The difference in microbead coordinates in stressed and 
relaxed images are marked with green and pink color, respectively. The microbead displacement data from MATLAB were used to compute stresses 
and strain during computational modeling. The cell morphology (orange) and nodes (white) along with constraint boundary condition are marked 
with pink arrows. The traction stress due to bead displacement and constraint boundary condition are marked with red and yellow contours in the

TFM modeling and analysis
Accurate geometric modeling of cell morphology is a key 
step in TFM that involves (1) creation of a basic object 
from point lines and curves, (2) transformation (scaling, 
rotation, and translation), and (3) integration of elements 
to create the final model. Removing unwanted edges, cor-
ners, curvatures, and unwanted bumps and smoothen-
ing the model during the computer-aided design (CAD) 
process are crucial and directly affect the accuracy of 
the TFM [149]. Surface modeling, e.g., analytical surface 
and free-form, curved and sculptured surface, and solid 
modeling, e.g., constructive solid geometry, boundary 
representation, feature-based modeling, and paramet-
ric modeling, are the available techniques for geometric 
modeling, and the selection of the appropriate modeling 
techniques depends on the complexity of the model 
[150].
Processing experimental data and extracting infor-
mation from the TFM depends largely on the selec-
tion of an appropriate computational technique (Fig. 6). 
Recently, Fourier transform traction cytometry, the FEM, 
TFM in image J, TFM in MATLAB, and other software 
tools have been reported to be used [151]. The trans-
fer mapping of microscopy image data points to natu-
ral coordinate data points for computing requires a set 
of conversion algorithms to convert MATLAB image 
data into computational modeling. In addition, various 
computation techniques such as the FEM, finite differ-
ence method (FDM), and finite volume method (FVM) 
are used to solve the computational modeling problem. 
Among the aforementioned computation techniques, 
FEM methods are widely used to solve the TFM prob-
lems. The FEM is a systematic technique that specifically 
solves partial differential equations for continuum elastic 
theory problems using a set of boundary conditions. This 
approach subdivides the larger model into a smaller form 
of a finite element, and these elements are compiled into 
a larger system using integration with a set of boundary 
conditions and constraints. Thus, the accuracy of the 
results depends on the selection of the element shape.
The FDM is the most direct approach for discretizing 
partial differential equations and is a highly efficient solu-
tion, especially for a regular grid. However, this method 
is not recommended for complex CAD geometries. The 
fundamental conversation properties of the FVM make 
it preferable to FDM and FEM. The FVM is a two-step 
process that transforms a set of complex partial differ-
ential equations into a linear algebraic equation, which 
affects the output results. The selection of an appropriate 
solver model depends not only on the level of complexity 
but also on the computation time required to solve the 
problem.

Multiscale TFM
Most of the literature related to 2D TFM reports that 
cells exert only shear (parallel to the plane of the sub-
strate) and normal traction forces (perpendicular to the 
substrate). How normal and shear stresses are integrated 
and how the magnitude of the net force is transferred to 
the focal adhesion and cytoskeleton are the key ques-
tions that motivate researchers to consider 3D TFM tech-
niques [152, 153]. The recently developed 2.5D TFM over 
a 2D substrate precisely measured the nature of the cellu-
lar force experienced by ECM using 3D super-resolution 
imaging [154], which could measure multi-dimensional 
traction stress associated with focal adhesion and the 
actin cytoskeleton. In 3D TFM, by combining 3D-SIM 
and TFM [155], 3D-SIM was used to capture fast and 
spatial-resolution 3D images with minimal photobleach-
ing and phototoxicity. Subsequently, the reference fluo-
rescent bead embedded within the top surface of the 
hydrogel was captured, and the 3D traction stresses were 
calculated using FEM modeling. A novel technique for 
computing 3D displacements and traction stresses, both 
in-plane and out-of-plane, using epifluorescence micros-
copy was also studied [155]. After microscopy imag-
ing, topology-based single-particle tracking was used 
to reconstruct 3D motion fields from the single-particle 
layer images.
The transformation of 2D TFM to 3D TFM and fur-
ther multiscaling of TFMs require a complex algorithm 
that can guarantee critical accuracy. For instance, to 
determine the forces exerted by cells in multiscale TFM, 
researchers designed a 4D TFM technique [156], where 
spatial 3D system was combined with temporal 1D incor-
porating an ‘all in one’ toolbox to perform the necessary 
computation steps required for TFM. Using this tech-
nique, raw input images can be computed using a graphi-
cal user interface. The built-in free-form deformation 
algorithm and physical-based nonlinear inverse method 
render this technique suitable for computing cellular 
traction force in 2D, 3D, and time-lapse 4D in single- and 
multiple-cell systems [157–160].
Conclusion and perspectives
Previous studies on cells and their migration have 
answered many but not all questions regarding the 
behavior of migrating cells. Cells experience mechani-
cal stimuli from their microenvironment, which might 
induce growth, motion, and differentiation; this is gen-
erally termed as mechanosensation. Forces from the 
ECM microenvironment are transferred to the nucleus 
through the cytoskeleton and affect the DNA and activ-
ity of other organelles. The amount of force transferred 
from the ECM to the nucleus is not only related to cell 
morphology but also depends on ECM properties such 
as viscosity, stiffness, and pore size. The selection and 
fabrication of synthetic ECM materials with appropri-
ate properties remain challenging. Literature from the 
past 10 years has revealed that there are many tools and 
techniques available for understanding and studying 
cell mechanical properties. However, the mechanism 
of action of these forces, particularly nuclear mecha-
nosensation, remains unknown.
For nuclear mechanosensing mechanisms, the visuali-
zation and estimation of any changes in the cell nucleus 
owing to external forces have become an active area of 
research for biologists, chemists, and physicists; these 
changes also play an important role in cancer progres-
sion. Different TFM methods and modified TFM tech-
niques have been used to analyze the force experienced 
by cells in the microenvironment. The integration of 
computational tools, such as FEM modeling, machine 
learning, microscopic imaging, and image analysis, 
has resulted in advanced techniques for studying the 
cellular forces generated by the external environment 
and estimating the nuclear forces transferred from the 
cytoskeleton.
The implementation of TFM in cell migration and 
adhesion becomes more complex when TFM is calcu-
lated in 3D compared to that in 2D. In the modeling of 
3D cell morphology, the tracking of beads in one plane 
also remains challenging. Although the 3D traction 
technique is conceptually similar to 2D microscopy, the 
implementation of this process, selection of appropri-
ate biomaterials, and precise spatiotemporal monitor-
ing of bead movements in a 3D matrix complicate this 
process. Therefore, the standardization of bead-track-
ing algorithms to estimate bead displacement directly 
from microscopic image data can be a future research 
direction for the advancement of multi-dimensional 
and multiscale TFM applications.
