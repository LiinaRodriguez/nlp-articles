Abstract
Background  Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is regulated through complex molecular mechanisms. Cyclin B1 (CCNB1) was 
previously determined as being associated with LVI using large cohorts of breast cancer (BC) and artificial neural network 
(ANN) technique. In this study, we aimed to assess the association between CCNB1 and LVI, other clinicopathological and 
other LVI-related biomarkers at the molecular (RNA transcriptomic) and proteomic levels in BC.
Methods  Two transcriptomic BC cohorts (n = 2834) were used to assess the association between the expression of CCNB1 
at the mRNA level and clinicopathological characteristics and patient outcome. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from a well-
characterised BC cohort (n = 2480) with long-term outcome were also used to assess the clinical significance of CCNB1 
protein expression using immunohistochemistry.
Results  High CCNB1 mRNA expression was associated with aggressive tumour behaviour, including LVI, larger size, 
higher tumour grade, high lymph nodal stage, hormonal receptor negativity, HER2 positivity and poor clinical outcome (all 
p < 0.0001). Similarly, high CCNB1 protein expression was associated with higher tumour grade, hormonal receptor negativ-
ity and HER2 positivity (all p < 0.0001). Additionally, there was a significant association between CCNB1- and LVI-related 
biomarkers including N-cadherin, P-cadherin and TWIST2 at the transcriptomic and proteomic level. Multivariate analysis 
revealed that CCNB1 was an independent predictor of shorter BC-specific survival (HR = 1.3; 95% CI 1.2–1.5; p = 0.010).
Conclusion  CCNB1 is a key gene associated with LVI in BC and has prognostic value. More functional studies are warranted 
to unravel the mechanistic role of CCNB1 in the development of LVI.

Introduction
The rate of breast cancer (BC)-associated mortalities 
has significantly increased over the past two decades [1], 
which is mainly related to metastasising disease to the 
other vital organs. Between 12 and 20% of early-stage 
BC patients will develop metastasis [2, 3]. The metastatic 
cascade consists of a complex stepwise manner and fail-
ure to complete any of these steps can stop the process 
[4]. Lymphovascular invasion (LVI), which refers to the 
presence of tumour emboli within the lymphatic and/or 
vascular spaces in the peritumoural invasive area, is con-
sidered as the initial and cornerstone step in the metastatic 
process. Despite the propensity of invasive BC cells to 
invade surrounding stroma, only those that can interact 
with endothelial cells and invade the vascular wall will 
develop LVI and complete metastatic spread [5, 6]. These

LVI tumour emboli can migrate to distant organs, infiltrate 
and grow at the metastatic sites resulting in nodal or dis-
tance metastasis.
LVI is an important prognostic factor in cancers, includ-
ing BC [7]. At the molecular level, upregulation of certain 
genes and downregulation of others can increase tumour 
invasiveness, migration and the ability to penetrate vascu-
lar walls and survive in the new environment [8–11]. As 
the molecular mechanisms underlying LVI are complex and 
overlap with many other related biological phenomena of 
carcinogenesis and progress, the primary steps of LVI can 
be explored via differential expression between LVI-negative 
and LVI-positive BC, mainly by virtue of pathways that pro-
mote LVI and the associated critical genes. The advances 
and development in bioinformatic techniques and high-
throughput molecular methods allowed identification of key 
genes on a large scale, such as those linked with LVI [12].
Several studies have indicated that the presence of LVI in 
a primary tumour can determine appropriate treatment plans 
for BC [13–15]. Therefore, it is imperative to recognise the 
unique challenges presented by BC and find biomarkers to 
help with better management of cancer and optimise clinical 
outcomes for those patients.
Cyclins are proteins that activate certain cyclin-dependent 
kinases (CDKs) necessary for cell cycle progression [16]. 
Cyclin B1 (CCNB1) is a member of the cyclin family and 
a critical initiator and with quality control function in cel-
lular division [17]. CCNB1 plays a key role in regulating 
and complexing with CDK1 to promote transition from the 
G2 to the mitotic phase of the cell cycle [18]. Increasing 
evidence indicates that CCNB1 is overexpressed in a vari-
ety of human malignancies, including colorectal, BC and 
prostate cancer [18–20]. Inhibition of CCNB1 causes cell 
cycle arrest in various cell lines by altering the expression 
of G2/M cell cycle regulators [18]. CCNB1 is also involved 
in the proliferation, migration, apoptosis, chemoresistance 
and metastasis of tumours [21–23]. We previously identi-
fied CCNB1 as an overexpressed gene in BC with positive 
LVI using two large transcriptomic cohorts of BC, includ-
ing the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International 
Consortium (METABRIC) [24] and The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) [25], using artificial neural network (ANN) 
methodology [26]. However, the exact role of CCNB1 in 
the development of LVI, including protein expression levels 
and its association with LVI, the effect of other clinical and 
pathological confounders and the crosstalk with the other 
proliferation and LVI-related biomarkers, is still unknown. 
As such, it was necessary to gain insight into the role it 
plays in the development of LVI and BC outcomes in clini-
cal settings by assessing its association with LVI at protein 
level. This study aimed to evaluate the association between 
CCNB1 at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels and LVI 
status, LVI-related biomarkers and other clinicopathological 
parameters using large well-annotated BC cohorts with long-
term follow-up.
Materials and methods
Transcriptomic analysis study cohort
Using the METABRIC (n = 1980) and TCGA (n = 854) 
cohorts [24, 25], an assessment of the association between 
CCNB1 mRNA expression and different variables, including 
tumour grade, tumour size, molecular subtypes, LVI-related 
biomarkers, and patient outcomes, was performed. The Illu-
mina Human HT-12 v3 platforms (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, 
USA) were used to examine the extracted mRNA from pri-
mary tumour samples in the METABRIC. For TCGA data, 
the required information about clinicopathological param-
eters and RNASeqV2 data was obtained from cBioPortal 
[27, 28]. A subset (n = 288) of the METABRIC cohort was 
utilised to assess the correlation between mRNA and pro-
tein expression where data on the expression level of both 
parameters was available.
The METABRIC and the TCGA cohorts that were used 
in our previous study were used to evaluate the mRNA 
expression and its association with LVI status. Most patient 
demographics were similar in the TCGA and METABRIC 
cohorts. However, in the METABRIC cohort, LVI status has 
previously been evaluated for 1565 patients, including the 
Nottingham subset from the METABRIC cohort, using his-
tological investigation of H&E-stained paraffin-embedded 
tissues. LVI status in Nottingham subset was determined by 
endothelial markers through IHC staining for CD31, CD34, 
and D2-40 [29]. However, the LVI was evaluated in the 
TCGA by assessing histological slides stained with H&E 
as no vascular IHC biomarkers were carried out for these 
samples. The clinical characteristics for the METABRIC 
and TCGA cohorts are shown in Supplementary Table 1. In 
regard to the patients’ cohort used in this study, LVI status 
was evaluated using both H&E-stained slides and IHC stain-
ing markers.
In addition, whilst in the METABRIC cohort, the over-
all distribution of intrinsic BC subtypes was assessed via 
prediction analysis of 50 genes using the PAM50 method, a 
technique based on RT-qPCR, the BC subtypes of the Not-
tingham cohort were identified using IHC profiling and the 
Elston–Ellis mitotic score [30]. Details of the clinicopatho-
logical factors of Nottingham cohorts are shown in Sup-
plementary Table 2.
CCNB1 protein expression
Sample tissues were obtained from well-characterised BC 
cohorts. This cohort contained 2480 primary invasive BC 
425

patients presented at the Nottingham City Hospital. Every 
patient’s clinicopathological profile was available, includ-
ing age at diagnosis, size and nodal stage of the primary 
tumour, histological grade, LVI status and the Nottingham 
Prognostic Index (NPI). Oestrogen receptor (ER), proges-
terone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor 2 
(HER2) data were available for this cohort [31–34]. The BC 
molecular subtypes, luminal A ­(ER+ /HER2−; Ki67 < 10%), 
luminal B ­(ER+ /HER2−; Ki67⩾10%), ­HER2− enriched 
­(HER2+ regardless of ER status) and triple-negative BC 
(ER-, ­PR− and ­HER2−), were characterised according to 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) profiles. Outcome data in 
terms of BC-specific survival (BCSS), in months, were 
available, defined as the time when the patient underwent 
surgery to when they died from BC. Patient treatment was 
based on the tumour features, NPI and the status of hormone 
receptors. Patients with ­ER+ tumour and high NPI scores 
(> 3.4) were given endocrine therapy. Those with the “good” 
NPI scores (≤ 3.4) were not given adjuvant therapy. Chemo-
therapy was given to premenopausal patients with moder-
ate and poor NPI scores, whilst only hormonal therapy was 
given to postmenopausal patients with “moderate” or “poor” 
NPI scores. The classical treatments for patients without ER 
expression were cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, and metho-
trexate. None of the patients in the study cohort received 
neoadjuvant therapy.
To gain more insight into the CCNB1 molecular interac-
tions, the correlation with epithelial–mesenchymal transition 
(EMT)-related markers, such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, 
P-cadherin, TGFβ1, and TWIST2 [35, 36] was investigated. 
Supplementary Table 3 lists the cut-offs used to determine 
the expression levels of all these biomarkers.
Tissue microarrays and CCNB1 antibody validation 
and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining
The primary mouse monoclonal anti-CCNB1 antibody 
(ab72, Abcam, UK)’s specificity was validated using western 
blot (WB) prior to staining with the IHC. MCF-7, SK-BR-3, 
and MB-MDA-231 (obtained from the American Type Cul-
ture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) BC cell line lysates 
were used. In brief, 1:1000 and 1:15,000 primary antibody 
ratio and secondary antibody (IRDye 700CW Donkey anti-
mouse) ratio were applied, respectively. The visualisation of 
the endogenous control marker was aided by the rabbit mon-
oclonal anti-GAPDH primary antibody (1:5000) (ab181602, 
Abcam, UK) with IRDye 800CW Donkey anti-rabbit fluo-
rescent secondary antibody (LI-COR Biosciences). The 
Odyssey Fc with Image Studio 4.0 (LI-COR Biosciences) 
was used to visualise the CCNB1 band, which showed a 
specific band at the expected molecular weight of 40 kDa 
(Supplementary Fig. 1).
The Grand Master® (3D HISTECH®, Budapest, Hun-
gary) was used to prepare tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 
invasive BC tissues [35]. Using the Novocastra Novolink™ 
Polymer Detection Systems kit (Code: RE7280-K, Leica 
Biosystems, Newcastle, UK), the process of staining the 
TMAs by IHC was done on 4-μm TMA-thick sections. Anti-
gen retrieval was performed (citrate buffer pH 6 at 1000 W 
for 20 min using microwave energy) following the manufac-
turers’ recommendations for this antibody. The dilution of 
the mouse monoclonal CCNB1 was done at 1:5000 ration in 
the Leica antibody diluent (RE AR9352, Leica Biosystems, 
UK), which was followed by a 15-min incubation at room 
temperature. Normal liver and tonsil tissues were used as 
negative and positive controls, respectively (Fig. 1A, B).
CCNB1 protein expression assessment
TMA-stained sections were scanned into high-quality digital 
images, and this was carried out using a NanoZoomer scan-
ner (NanoZoomer; Hamamatsu Photonics, Welwyn Garden 
City, UK) at × 20 magnification. The evaluation of CCNB1 
cytoplasm expression was based on a semi-quantitative scor-
ing by the modified histochemical score (H-score). During 
this evaluation, the staining intensity was multiplied by the 
positive cell percentage for every tissue. As such, a score 
ranging from 0 to 300 was produced [37]. The negative, 
weak, moderate and strong scores, which corresponded to a 
score index of 0–3, respectively, were used to assess inten-
sity. The percentage of positive cells for every intensity went 
through a subjective assessment. The non-representative 
cores, such as cores in invasive tumour less than 15% of the 
core surface area and folded tissue during staining and pro-
cessing, were not included in the scoring. IHC TMA slides 
were scored blindly and individually performed by a trained 
pathologist alongside the main researcher for at least 20% of 
the whole cohort under investigation. In the occurrence of 
a lower scoring concordance, the slides were re-scored and 
the differences between the scores discussed by the main 
researcher and a consultant pathologist. Excellent concord-
ance of CCNB1 immunoscoring was observed between the 
two scorers (ICC = 0.9). CCNB1 protein expression data 
were not normally distributed and the cut-off for CCNB1 
positivity was set using the median (100 H-score).
Statistical analysis
IBM-SPSS statistical software 24.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, 
USA) was used for statistical analysis. CCNB1 mRNA and 
CCNB1 protein expression continuous data were used to 
evaluate the correlation with clinicopathological param-
eters. The one-way analysis of variations (ANOVA) with 
post hoc Turkey multiple comparison tests was used to study 
the differences between three or more groups for parametric 
426

data. For non-parametric distribution, the ANOVA with 
Kruskal–Wallis test was used. In the METABRIC cohort, 
data about CCNB1 mRNA expression were normally dis-
tributed and were categorised into low and high expres-
sion using cut-off generated from the mean. In the TCGA 
cohort, data about CCNB1 mRNA expression were right 
skewed and were categorised using cut-off generated from 
the median. The difference between the two groups was 
evaluated using the Mann–Whitney test for non-parametric 
distribution and the Student T test for parametric data. The 
calculation of Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used to 
evaluate the association between continuous variables. The 
Kaplan–Meier curves were used to visualise the univariate 
analysis with the log-rank test. Cox’s proportional hazard 
regression model was developed to analyse multivariate 
survival. A p value below 0.05 was considered as statisti-
cally significant for all tests. The study was conducted fol-
lowing REMARK criteria [38] (Supplementary Table 4).
Results
CCNB1 mRNA expression in BC
In METABRIC cohort, high CCNB1 mRNA expression was 
observed in 922/1980 (47%), whilst in TCGA cohort it was 
427/854 (50%). In both cohorts, a significant association 
was observed between high CCNB1 mRNA expression and 
the presence of LVI (all; p < 0.0001) and other features char-
acteristic of aggressive tumour behaviour, including large

tumour size, high histological grade, hormonal receptor 
negativity (all; p < 0.0001) and HER2 positivity (p < 0.0001 
in METABRIC and p = 0.006 in TCGA). In the META-
BRIC cohort, high expression of CCNB1 mRNA was sig-
nificantly associated with poor NPI and high LN stage (all; 
p < 0.0001).
Assessment of CCNB1 mRNA in the intrinsic (PAM50) 
subtypes showed that high expression of CCNB1 was 
correlated with luminal B, basal like, HER2 enriched, 
luminal A and normal-like subtypes in descending order 
(p < 0.0001) (Table 1). There was a weak correlation 
between CCNB1 mRNA expression and CCNB1 protein 
expression (r = 0.136) when tested in the sub-cohort of 
METABRIC cases (n = 288).

CCNB1 protein expression in BC
CCNB1 protein expression was observed mainly in the 
cytoplasm of invasive BC cells, with occasional cases 
showing minimal to weak nuclear expression, which were 
not sufficient to perform meaningful statistical analysis. 
The cytoplasmic expression levels varied from absent to 
strong (Fig. 1C, D). A high CCNB1 protein level (> 100 
H-score) was observed in 1141/2480 (46%) of BC cases. A 
high CCNB1 protein level was significantly correlated with 
high tumour grade (including high pleomorphism scores, 
high mitotic count scores), poor NPI, hormonal receptor 
negativity (ER/PR) (all p < 0.0001) and HER2 positivity 
(p = 0.011). In the IHC subtypes, high expression of CCNB1 
was associated with ­ER−/HER2−, ­HER2+, ­ER+/HER2− high 
proliferation subtype, followed by ­ER+/HER2− low prolif-
eration subtype (p < 0.0001) (Table 2).
The association between CCNB1 expression 
and LVI‑related biomarkers
To further evaluate the role of CCNB1 in BC and their 
interactions with other biomarkers related to the various 
LVI-related cascades, the METABRIC and TCGA datasets 
were interrogated for the correlation between CCNB1 and 
other genes involved in invasion, EMT and adhesion. Based 
on previous publications, E-cadherin, P-cadherin, N-cad-
herin, TWIST2 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were 
selected [5, 35, 36, 39, 40].
Both transcriptomic cohorts (METABRIC and TCGA) 
showed a significant positive linear correlation between 
CCNB1 mRNA expression and the expression of EMT-
related genes, including N-cadherin, GSK3B, TWIST1, 
TWIST2, ZEB1, ZEB2, NFKB1 and CTNNB1, whilst a nega-
tive linear correlation was observed with E-cadherin. In the 
TCGA cohort, a similar correlation was observed between 
CCNB1 mRNA expression and the expression of P-cadherin 
and TGFB1. In addition, in both cohorts, CCNB1 mRNA 
expression was positively correlated with the expression of 
MMP-related genes expression, including MMP1, MMP7, 
MMP9, MMP12, MMP15 and MMP20. In the Nottingham 
cohort, high CCNB1 protein level showed a negative cor-
relation with E-cadherin and a positive correlation with 
N-cadherin, P-cadherin and TWIST2 (Table 3).
The association of CCNB1 expression and patient’s 
outcome
In the METABRIC cohort, survival analyses of CCNB1 
mRNA showed that CCNB1 overexpression was signifi-
cantly associated with shorter BCSS (p < 0.0001, Fig. 2A). 
Similarly, in the TCGA cohort, high CCNB1 mRNA 
expression was associated with shorter outcome (p = 0.010,

Fig. 2B). At the protein level, there was no significant asso-
ciation between cytoplasmic CCNB1 expression and patient 
outcome in the univariate analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2). 
However, when the overall expression was considered (cyto-
plasmic and nuclear), high protein expression was associ-
ated with shorter disease-specific survival (HR = 1.3, 95%CI 
1.1–1.5, p = 0.002) which is consistent with the mRNA level.
In the METABRIC cohort, multivariate Cox regression 
analysis showed that CCNB1 mRNA predicted poor BCSS 
survival independent of tumour size, LN stage, tumour grade 
and LVI (HR 1.5; 95% CI 1.2–1.8; p < 0.0001). In the Not-
tingham cohort, Cox regression analysis showed that high 
expression of CCNB1 was a significant predictor of shorter 
BCSS regardless of LVI status, tumour size, LN stage 
and tumour grade (HR = 1.3; 95% CI 1.1–1.5; p = 0.010) 
(Table 4).
Discussion
One of the hallmarks of human cancer is abnormal cell cycle 
regulation [41]. Uncontrolled cell division is a necessary 
step in the progression of cancer. Several studies have found 
that cyclins, which orchestrate normal cell cycle, have abnor-
mally increased expression in a variety of human malignan-
cies [42, 43]. Cyclins are required to activate distinct CDKs 
at different stages of the cell cycle. Amongst the several 
cyclin/CDK complexes involved in cell cycle regulation, 
CCNB1/cdc2 is a well-studied complex that regulates G2/M 
phase checkpoint surveillance and is required for mitotic ini-
tiation [44, 45]. CCNB1 is essential in checkpoint regulation, 
as its dysregulation is an early event in carcinogenesis [46]. 
CCNB1 has been extensively studied in many solid tumours, 
such as lung [47], hepatic [48], and pancreatic cancers [20]. 
We previously identified CCNB1 as a gene associated with 
LVI status using two large transcriptomic cohorts of BC and 
ANN methodology [26]. Briefly, the identification of the

differentially expressed gene(s) between LVI positive and 
negative in the METABRIC [24] and the TCGA [25] BC 
cohorts was achieved using ANNs. To identify the enriched 
concordant biomarker set that is related to LVI, it was rec-
ommended to perform ANN-based neutral data mining 
on the genomic expression information obtained from the 
datasets identified early. Therefore, this followed the execu-
tion of the machine learning (ML) strategy grounded on the 
ANN and incorporated with concordance analysis executed 
in many Monte Carlo data splits [49]. This methodology 
efficiently eliminated over-fitting and false discovery whilst 
improving the identified biomarker generalisation. The con-
cordant transcripts that have the least test error available 
in many loops for every group were identified by filtering 
the results. One of the top-ranked identified genes related 
to LVI positivity in both TCGA and METABRIC cohorts 
was CCNB1 [26]. However, this is the first study, to the best 
of our knowledge investigating the association between 
CCNB1, LVI and LVI-related biomarkers in invasive BC.
From G0/G1 through the mid-S phase, CCNB1 is rela-
tively undetectable in cells; it becomes apparent in the cyto-
plasm in the late S phase. CCNB1 levels rapidly increased in 
the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm as cells progressed 
through the G2 phase and it then appears in the nucleus 
during the mitotic phase [50, 51]. In this study, CCNB1 
expression was observed in the cytoplasm in a large num-
ber of cases, whilst only a small number of cases showed 
nuclear staining. CCNB1 cytoplasmic localisation has been 
previously identified in some types of cancer, including BC 
[52]. During the late S/G2 phase of normal human cells, 
CCNB1/cdc2 complexes accumulate in the cytoplasm and 
must be translocated into the nucleus to initiate mitosis [53]. 
However, when DNA is damaged, CCNB1/cdc2 complexes 
are preserved in the cytoplasm, most likely to avoid prema-
ture mitosis [54]. On the other hand, cytoplasmic CCNB1 
accumulation has been demonstrated to initiate mitosis by 
passing a p53-mediated G2/M checkpoint [55]. Cytoplasmic 
CCNB1 expression causes abnormal cell cycle progression 
at the G2/M checkpoint, enhancing genomic instability and 
malignant transformation [56]. This supports the potential 
role of the cytoplasmic expression of CCNB1 in BC.
Tumour metastasis is a multistep process that begins 
with the separation of cancer cells from the initial tumour 
mass and proceeds with intravasation, extravasation and 
the formation of new foci in a distant organ [57, 58]. The 
siRNA knockdown approach showed significantly reduced 
cell proliferation, colony formation and invasion when an 
endogenous CCNB1 was disrupted in oesophageal squa-
mous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells. Furthermore, the find-
ings from animal models suggest that high expression of 
CCNB1 enhances invasive tumour growth in vivo and 
most likely leads to lung metastasis [21]. A study found 
that CCNB1 overexpression provided cells with a greater 
capacity for transmigration through oesophageal carcinoma 
endothelium cells and human lung endothelium cells, which 
may have altered the cytoskeletal structure and promoted 
extravasation [21]. High expression of CCNB1 resulted in 
decreased E-cadherin expression and increased N-cadherin 
expression, which induced EMT, an important mechanism 
in the metastatic cascade [21, 59]. High CCNB1 levels are 
associated with TWIST2 in ESCC, suggesting that TWIST2 
might play a role in CCNB1-induced EMT [21]. This study 
showed that LVI-related biomarkers, such as E-cadherin, 
N-cadherin, P-cadherin and TWIST2, were significantly 
associated with CCNB1 at both mRNA and protein levels, 
which is consistent with the abovementioned findings. Fur-
thermore, CCNB1 was correlated with MMPs biomarkers, 
such as MMP1, MMP7 and MMP9. The production of MMP 
extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading enzymes increases 
cell escape from the main tumour tissue and subsequent 
invasion into tumour-adjacent tissues, such as epithelial cell 
strata and eventually lymphatic vessels [60]. Although the 
association between CCNB1 and other proliferation, migra-
tion and invasion biomarkers ranged from weak to moderate 
correlation, it was statistically significant which indicates 
that these markers are contributing to the same oncogenic 
pathway in the context of the LVI process. High expression 
of CCNB1 results in the continuous cell cycle and division 
of cancer cells, promoting their migration and metastasis to 
distant sites [61, 62]. Uncontrolled cell division promoted by 
CCNB1 could lead to gaining genetic instability and muta-
tions that could affect other key genes for cellular migration 
and invasion that ultimately lead to LVI. Thus blocking this 
cascade from the early proliferative phase can stop these 
processes. These findings demonstrate that overexpression 
of CCNB1 may control one of the mechanisms driving LVI.
High expression of CCNB1 mRNA in both the META-
BRIC and TCGA cohorts showed an association with large 
tumour size, high tumour grade, poor NPI, LN stage, LVI 
positivity, ­ER−, ­PR− and ­HER2+. Similar findings were 
observed at the protein level; however, high expression 
of CCNB1 was not associated with presence of LVI at the 
protein level in contrast to the mRNA level. Such a dispar-
ity between mRNA and protein levels can be explained by 
various mechanisms. Because mRNA levels primarily deter-
mine protein levels, there will be variation between cellular 
mRNA and protein levels if the cell is undergoing long-term 
dynamic activities, such as continuous proliferation, which 
refers to the steady state of the cell [63]. CCNB1 has been 
identified as a critical target gene for promoting tumour pro-
liferation [64]. As a result of the proliferation induced by 
tumour cells, when CCNB1 is highly expressed in a malig-
nant cell, the cell may not be stable in the long term, lead-
ing to variation between mRNA and protein levels. Another 
factor that could contribute to the difference in the signifi-
cance between LVI and CCNB1 at the mRNA and protein

level is the methodologies that are used for quantifying and 
statistically analysing gene expression in the METABRIC 
and TCGA cohorts, as well as the ways for determining LVI 
in the transcriptomic and proteomic cohorts. For example, 
in the Nottingham cases, LVI status was determined using 
morphology and immunohistochemistry staining for D2-40 
[29]. However, cBioPortal H&E-stained slides were utilised 
to determine LVI status in the TCGA cohort. Although H&E 
slides can be used to evaluate LVI, it might be difficult to 
distinguish LVI-negative cases [65]. The weak correlation 
between mRNA and protein levels could also explain the 
contradictory results in LVI between protein and mRNA.
Cross-talk between proliferation and its related markers 
and LVI and tumour invasion has been investigated. A pub-
lished study [66] that investigated the mRNA and protein 
expression of other proliferation markers including Raf, 
MEK, p-MEK, ERK, and p-ERK in BC patients found that 
their levels were higher in the lymph node positive than in 
the node-negative group. The lowest levels of expression 
were noticed in normal breast tissue. The clinicopathologi-
cal parameters, including tumour size, stage, and positive 
lymph node number, were found to be strongly associated 
with higher expression of Raf, MEK, p-MEK, ERK, and 
p-ERK. Additionally, these biomarkers were associated with 
poor outcomes [66]. Other studies which investigated prolif-
eration-related markers in BC, including CCNB2 and Ki67, 
demonstrated that high expression of these biomarkers was 
associated with the features of aggressive tumour behaviour, 
such as LVI, large tumour size, and shorter survival [26, 
67]. These studies provided further evidence to support the 
link between the expression of proliferation-related markers, 
such as CCNB1 and LVI and metastasis.
In transcriptomic cohorts, high expression of CCNB1 was 
associated with worse outcomes which was also obvious at 
the protein level independent on other prognostic factors, 
including LVI status, tumour size, LN stage and tumour 
grade. Additionally, at the protein level, survival analysis 
with consideration of the overall CCNB1 protein expression 
(nuclear and cytoplasmic) revealed that high overall protein 
expression is associated with poor outcome which reflects 
the actual mRNA expression. This highlights the potential 
role of combined cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of 
CCNB1 in driving LVI and poor prognosis in BC. This was 
supported by the independent association of CCNB1 expres-
sion with poor BCSS in multivariate analysis. These find-
ings were consistent with numerous reports that have shown 
inconsistent findings of the association between CCNB1 
expression and prognosis in solid cancers [45, 47, 68]. Sev-
eral studies using RT-PCR to analyse gene expression at 
the RNA level discovered that CCNB1 was highly associ-
ated with poor outcomes in solid tumours. However, the link 
between increased CCNB1 expression at the protein level 
and clinical prognosis in solid tumours remains unclear [45, 
68]. These disparities indicate that more research is war-
ranted to elucidate the underlying mechanism and function 
of CCNB1 in tumour development and prognosis in various 
tumour types.
Our findings suggest that CCNB1 is a potential therapeu-
tic target for inhibiting LVI in BC and reducing the occur-
rence of metastatic disease. The results also suggest that 
CCNB1 might be a useful diagnostic tool to identify patients 
with positive LVI status in BC. The diagnostic utility of 
CCNB1 was previously described in other malignancies, 
including non-invasive bladder cancer and rhabdomyosar-
coma [69, 70].
Conclusion
Evidence from this study demonstrated that CCNB1 is 
important biomarker for invasive BC progression and has 
a potential role in LVI development. The exact functional 
and mechanistic effects of CCNB1 in LVI process require 
further investigations including in vitro and in vivo models 
to substantiate our findings.
