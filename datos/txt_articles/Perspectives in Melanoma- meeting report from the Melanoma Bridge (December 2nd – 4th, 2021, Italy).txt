Abstract 
Advances in immune checkpoint and combination therapy have led to improvement in overall survival for patients 
with advanced melanoma. Improved understanding of the tumor, tumor microenvironment and tumor immune-eva‑
sion mechanisms has resulted in new approaches to targeting and harnessing the host immune response. Combina‑
tion modalities with other immunotherapy agents, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, electrochemotherapy are also being 
explored to overcome resistance and to potentiate the immune response. In addition, novel approaches such as 
adoptive cell therapy, oncogenic viruses, vaccines and different strategies of drug administration including sequential, 
or combination treatment are being tested. Despite the progress in diagnosis of melanocytic lesions, correct classifi‑
cation of patients, selection of appropriate adjuvant and systemic theràapies, and prediction of response to therapy 
remain real challenges in melanoma. Improved understanding of the tumor microenvironment, tumor immunity and 
response to therapy has prompted extensive translational and clinical research in melanoma. There is a growing evi‑
dence that genomic and immune features of pre-treatment tumor biopsies may correlate with response in patients 
with melanoma and other cancers, but they have yet to be fully characterized and implemented clinically. Develop‑
ment of novel biomarker platforms may help to improve diagnostics and predictive accuracy for selection of patients 
for specific treatment. Overall, the future research efforts in melanoma therapeutics and translational research should 
focus on several aspects including: (a) developing robust biomarkers to predict efficacy of therapeutic modalities to 
guide clinical decision-making and optimize treatment regimens, (b) identifying mechanisms of therapeutic resist‑
ance to immune checkpoint inhibitors that are potentially actionable, (c) identifying biomarkers to predict therapy-
induced adverse events, and (d) studying mechanism of actions of therapeutic agents and developing algorithms 
to optimize combination treatments. During the Melanoma Bridge meeting (December 2nd-4th, 2021, Naples, Italy) 
discussions focused on the currently approved systemic and local therapies for advanced melanoma and discussed 
novel biomarker strategies and advances in precision medicine as well as the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on man‑
agement of melanoma patients.

Introduction
Major advances have been made in the treatment of 
metastatic melanoma using immune checkpoint block-
ade, with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approval of numerous therapeutic regimens within the 
past several years and many more being studied in clini-
cal trials. Immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors 
(cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen [CTLA]-4 
and programmed death [PD]-1/PD-ligand (L)-1 path-
way) and targeted therapies have emerged as promising 
options. Furthermore, combination therapies including 
chemotherapy, immunotherapy (e.g., other immuno-
therapy agents targeting additional checkpoints such as 
lymphocyte-activation gene (LAG)-3, V-domain immu-
noglobulin suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA), T cell 
immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing (TIM)-
3, cytokines, vaccines, and oncogenic viruses), targeted 
therapy (e.g., BRAF, MEK) and radiotherapy have shown 
promising outcomes in efficacy and safety due to their 
multiple targets that may have synergistic effects on 
outcomes. Combinations of immunogenicity-inducing 
agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors are an espe-
cially promising modality of enhancing the endogenous 
antitumoral responses. These may help overcome pri-
mary resistance to anti-checkpoint monoclonal antibod-
ies by recruiting T-cells to the tumor microenvironment 
(TME). Further advances in adoptive cell therapy such as 
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells and combina-
tions of anti-PD-1 therapies may also provide a successful 
treatment modality in patients with solid tumors.
Genomic and RNA-based studies exploring predictors 
of outcome to immune checkpoint blockade in mela-
noma suggest that tumor-specific mutational load and 
neoantigen signature as well as cytolytic activity are sig-
nificantly associated with clinical benefit and increased 
overall survival (OS). For example, tumor mutational bur-
den (TMB) demonstrates predictive value for response to 
immunotherapy that is based on enhanced neoantigen 
load and presentation to T cells. Although PD-L1 has 
been identified as a predictive marker in many tumors, 
its association with clinical efficacy in melanoma is yet 
to be proven. Other biomarkers based on transcriptomic 
profiles that reflect inflammation stratus, including tis-
sue inflammation score, interferon (IFN)-α signature or 
CD8 T cell count, correlate with treatment response. Fur-
thermore, biomarkers to predict immune-related adverse 
events (irAEs) are also of high interest, particularly those 
irAEs with life-threatening consequences. In addition 
to identifying predictors of response to immune check-
point blockade, there is growing interest in understand-
ing the mechanistic differences between different forms 
of immune checkpoint blockade. These advances should 
have important clinical implications and may help guide 
rational therapeutic combinations of distinct immune 
checkpoint inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents 
depending on the desired treatment effect.
How COVID‑19 impacted on our daily practice 
both clinical and research
Clinical outcomes in cancer patients with COVID‑19
Immunocompromised status secondary to malignancy 
and the use of immunosuppressive treatments may imply 
that patients with cancer are more vulnerable to infec-
tion with community-acquired respiratory viruses such 
as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS‐CoV‐2), and more prone to developing complica-
tions (e.g., lower respiratory tract illness and hypoxemic 
respiratory failure).
Several reports have suggested that patients with can-
cer are at increased risk of contracting SARS‐CoV‐2 and 
that they also experience worse outcomes. However, 
other data have indicated that patients hospitalized with 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) with or without 
cancer have similar outcomes when matched by age and 
number of comorbidities. The relationship between can-
cer status and survival outcome was assessed in hospital-
ized patients at NYU Langone Health who tested positive 
for COVID-19 during the height of the pandemic in 
New York [1]. A total of 6274 hospitalized patients were 
included, of whom 580 had either active cancer (n = 221; 
defined as treatment within 6 months of COVID-19 diag-
nosis or measurable disease at time of hospitalization) or 
a history of cancer (n = 359). Patients with history of can-
cer were significantly older than those with active malig-
nancy and more likely to have comorbidities known to 
correspond with worse outcomes in COVID-19 (hyper-
tension, atherosclerotic disease, and chronic kidney dis-
ease), as well as higher median body mass index.
However, COVID-19 associated morbidity was gen-
erally similar between the active cancer and history of 
cancer groups, with no significant differences in propor-
tions with severe COVID‐19, admitted to intensive care, 
median length of hospital stay, or occurrence of throm-
boembolic events. There was a trend toward increased 
intubation in patients with a history of cancer, but this 
was not statistically significant. The two groups also

received similar pharmacologic treatments and total 
number of medications for COVID‐19.
Despite similar morbidity, patients with active cancer 
had higher all‐cause mortality than those with a history 
of cancer (41% vs 32%; p = 0.035). This was even though 
patients with a history of cancer were significantly older 
and more often had a known risk factor for poor prog-
nosis in COVID-19. Both active cancer patients and 
patients with a history of cancer had worse survival than 
the general population hospitalized with COVID-19 in 
New York City around the same time period.
These data highlight the importance of continuing can-
cer care with minimal interruptions during a pandemic 
to bring about response and remission as soon as pos-
sible. Routine management and monitoring should be 
complemented by encouraging the vaccination of active 
cancer patients and patients with a history of cancer.
The experience at the melanoma unit of the istituto 
nazionale tumori—IRCCS “Fondazione G. Pascale” 
in Naples, Italy
The first rule during the COVID-19 pandemic is to pro-
tect patients and healthcare workers. Potential expo-
sure to the virus must be minimized with the priority 
on the patient’s well-being. European Society for Medi-
cal Oncology (ESMO) guidance for the prioritization 
of cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has 
been a tiered approach, with patients categorized as 
those requiring high, medium, or low priority interven-
tion. One key recommendation has been that the treat-
ment with targeted therapies or immunotherapies for 
patients with unresectable stage III or IV metastatic 
melanoma should be no stopped or delayed.
An ESMO multidisciplinary expert consensus on 
managing cancer patients during the COVID-19 pan-
demic concluded that treatment with immune check-
point inhibitors should not be withheld or delayed in 
the absence of COVID-19 infection for the approved 
(neo)adjuvant treatment indications with demonstrated 
survival benefit [2]. However, in patients who have 
tested positive for COVID-19, immune checkpoint 
blockade should be postponed until recovery. One of 
the main concerns has been the possible increased risk 
of pneumonia in patients with cancer receiving immu-
notherapy. Interstitial pneumonia occurs in 2.5–5% of 
patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor mono-
therapy and 7–10% of patients receiving combination 
immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and the risk of 
overlapping syndromes with similar pathogenesis in 
patients with COVID-19 is hypothetical but cannot be 
excluded.
In the study of 69 patients with lung cancer patients 
infected with COVID-19, PD-1 blockade was not 
associated with increased risk of severity of COVID-19 
[3]. Similarly, an international, registry-based, cohort 
study of COVID-19 in 200 patients with thoracic malig-
nancies reported no increased risk of hospitalization 
with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, either alone 
or combined with chemotherapy [4]. Moreover, preclini-
cal data suggest that anti-PD-1 therapy can increase virus 
clearance. High pathological infection with influenza A is 
associated with increased PD-1 expression on influenza 
virus-specific CD8 + T cells in a mouse model, which is 
likely caused by the more inflamed airway microenviron-
ment during the early days of infection [5]. PD-L1 inhi-
bition in  vivo led to reduced virus titers and increased 
CD8 + T cell numbers in high- but not low-pathological 
infection.
Few cases of infections secondary to the treatment of 
immune checkpoint inhibitor-related side effects have 
been reported and there are limited data describing viral 
infections or reactivations as a complication of immune 
checkpoint inhibitor use, even with the use of immuno-
suppressive treatment for irAEs [6]. Reports also show 
a decrease in virus replication in patients infected by 
hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus or human immuno-
deficiency virus who were on treatment with immune 
checkpoint inhibitors [7].
These data support the hypothesis that immune check-
point blockade may be protective against SARS-CoV-2 
infection. Data from the Istituto Nazionale Tumori—
IRCCS "Fondazione G. Pascale" in Naples reported that 
immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment was a significant 
protective factor against the onset of COVID-19 infec-
tion as SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig)M and/or IgG 
titers were significantly lower among immune-check-
point inhibitor treated patients than patients treated 
with chemotherapy [8]. However, ESMO guidance is 
that patients receiving immunotherapy showing signs of 
pneumonitis on computed tomography (CT) scan should 
be tested for COVID-19 before administrating steroids.
Treatment with high-dose steroids is the first-line 
treatment of irAEs with infliximab, mycophenolate 
mofetil, and tocilizumab options for steroid-refractory 
patients. Coronavirus infection activates pathways that 
result in increased systemic cytokine production, which 
contributes to the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 
infection. A potential therapeutic strategy is to target 
hyperinflammation, for example with interleukin (IL)-6 
receptor antagonists such as tocilizumab, sarilumab or 
siltixumab. IL-6 is a cytokine with pleiotropic activity that 
plays an important role in acquired immune response by 
stimulation of antibody production and of effector T-cell 
development. Elevated IL-6 is a hallmark inflammatory 
signature seen in patients with severe COVID-19 respira-
tory distress. Early experience on the use of tocilizumab

Ascierto et al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2022) 20:391 
reported rapid improvement in both intubated and non-
intubated COVID-19 patients. In the multicenter, single-
arm TOCIVID-19 trial, tocilizumab reduced the lethality 
rate at 30 days without significant toxicity [9]. In a ret-
rospective case series, clinical improvement after sari-
lumab treatment was associated with rapid decreases in 
C-reactive protein levels, as well as lower baseline IL-6 
and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [10]. In addition to 
IL-6 inhibitors, several other therapies could potentially 
target hyperinflammation, including tumor necrosis fac-
tor (TNF) inhibitors, and inhibitors of IL-17, IL-23, IL-1, 
and Janus kinase (JAK). Further investigation of these as 
treatment options for COVID-19 is required.
Impact of COVID‑19 on oncology practice
The COVID-19 pandemic and non-communicable disease 
(NCD) epidemic, of which cancer is a significant part, have 
together brought about a deadly interplay. For example, 
120 countries reported that NCD services were disrupted 
by COVID-19 and, in a more recent survey, several coun-
tries (US, Japan and Europe) all reported caseloads being 
reduced by between 25 and 51%. Fewer diagnosis, delays to 
surgery and chemotherapy, and switching treatment from 
intravenous to oral administration all occurred across the 
surveyed countries. Oncologists reported that patients 
were impacted on several levels, including financial hard-
ship, logistical challenges due to new ways of working, 
appointment cancellations and delays, inadequate support 
and engagement, and reduced time with families.
COVID-19 has also had a major detrimental impact 
on cancer screening, with screening and accompanying 
diagnostic procedures significantly reduced. In the USA, 
an estimated 41,500 patients with breast cancer, 2000 
patients with cervical cancer, and 24,000 patients with 
colorectal cancer had delayed diagnosis due to COVID-
19. The impact of this is already being seen, with more 
patients having metastatic disease when first presenting 
to community oncologists in 2020 compared with pre-
COVID. Decreases have also been seen in numbers of 
biopsies and surgeries, as well as in numbers of patients 
receiving systemic therapies.
Cancer is also a recognized risk factor for increased 
risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Across several 
surveys in Europe and North America, estimates of early 
mortality due to COVID-19 among cancer patients were 
11–33%, with hematological and lung cancers associated 
with the highest risk. In a systematic review of 52 stud-
ies which included 18,650 patients with both COVID-19 
and cancer, 4243 deaths were recorded giving a mortality 
probability of 25.6% [11]. COVID-19 fatality rate has also 
been shown to be higher in cancer patients than matched 
control groups of non-cancer patients.
COVID-19 has further highlighted major disparities 
in cancer care, with minority ethnic groups being more 
severely impacted in terms of access to diagnosis and 
treatments across countries with a disproportionate bur-
den of cancer care disruptions.
Finally, COVID-19 had had a detrimental impact on 
oncologists, with high numbers reporting an adverse 
impact on their professional career and increased num-
bers considering leaving the profession. This impact has 
been experienced more by women than men, with a sig-
nificantly higher proportion of women than men spend-
ing less time on science during lockdowns [12].
VISTA as a target for immunotherapy
VISTA is an immune checkpoint regulatory molecule 
that is constitutively expressed on multiple immune cell 
types such as CD11b + myeloid cells, naïve CD4 + and 
CD8 + T cells, Foxp3 + CD4 + regulatory T cells (Tregs), 
and T cell receptor (TCR)γδ T cells. In murine models, 
treatment with VISTA antibodies increases the number 
of CD4 + and CD8 + tumor specific T cells in the TME 
and converts non-functional/exhausted CD8 + T cells to 
functional T cells [13, 14]. The CD8 + or CD4 + to Treg 
ratio was not increased in oral squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC) but Tregs were decreased in melanoma. Myeloid-
derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were reduced in some 
but not all models. Heterozygous depletion of VISTA 
resulted in dermatitis, otitis, uveitis, and seizures.
In humans, high VISTA and low CD8 + expression 
predicted worse prognosis in primary oral SCC [15]. 
Increased CD4 + and CD8 + VISTA expression has been 
reported after ipilimumab therapy in patients with pros-
tate cancer, with increased PD-L1 and VISTA inhibi-
tory molecules on independent subsets of macrophages 
[16]. In breast cancer, CD4 + and CD8 + expressed 
VISTA [17] whereas in esophageal adenocarcinoma 
only CD4 + expressed VISTA; VISTA correlated with 
improved overall survival (OS) [18]. In non-small-cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC), VISTA was frequently expressed 
and was higher in T-lymphocytes than in macrophages. 
VISTA expression in the tumor predicted longer sur-
vival [19]. VISTA expression on MDSCs in patients with 
acute myeloid leukemia mediated the inhibition of T cell 
response [20].
In melanoma, increased expression of VISTA can indi-
cate a poor prognosis. In an analysis of 85 primary mela-
noma specimens, VISTA was associated with myeloid 
infiltrate and the density of PD-1 + inflammatory cells 
[21]. The presence of VISTA was also associated with a 
significantly worse disease-specific survival in univariate 
and multivariate analysis.
Several clinical trials of anti-VISTA inhibitors have 
been conducted or are planned. The first trial of an 
Page 5 of 21
Ascierto et al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2022) 20:391 
	
anti-VISTA antibody, JNJ-61610588, in patients with 
advanced cancer was stopped early due to a dose limit-
ing toxicity related to cytokine release syndrome. Studies 
of the small molecule VISTA/PD-L1 antagonist, CA-170, 
are ongoing, but single-agent therapy has shown lim-
ited efficacy. Phase I/II trials of anti-VISTA antibodies, 
including a fully human single-chain fragment variable 
(ScFv) anti-VISTA IgG1 monoclonal antibody designed 
to bind to VISTA through a unique epitope (KV12.1) and 
an IgG4 isotype anti-VISTA (HMBD-002), are planned. 
These trials will include anti-VISTA as monotherapy and 
in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy.
In conclusion, blocking VISTA antibody effects may 
depend on isotype and single-agent small molecule 
blockade has to date shown limited activity. The timing 
of anti-VISTA use is not yet established, and it is likely 
that combination immune checkpoint blockade will be 
needed.
Melanoma is model for cancer research
Microbiota‑centered interventions for the next generation 
immuno‑oncology
Primary resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition can 
be attributed to abnormal gut microbiome composition. 
Among patients with renal or lung cancer, metagenom-
ics of fecal samples at diagnosis revealed enrichment of 
Akkermansia muciniphila taxa in patients responding 
to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [22]. In mice, 
oral supplementation with A. muciniphila after fecal 
microbial transplantation (FMT) from non-responders 
restored the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in an interleukin-
12-dependent manner by increasing the recruitment of 
­CCR9+CXCR3+CD4+ T lymphocytes into mouse tumor 
beds.
In the phase II randomized NEOSTAR trial of neoadju-
vant nivolumab or nivolumab plus ipilimumab followed 
by surgery in 44 patients with operable stage III NSCLC, 
increased abundance of gut Ruminococcus and Akker-
mansia spp. that was associated with pathologic response 
to combination therapy [23].
HLA class I defects in melanoma cells. molecular 
mechanisms and clinical relevance
Abnormalities in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class 
I antigen-processing machinery (APM) have been iden-
tified in many types of cancer, with a frequency ranging 
between 36% in renal cancer and 88% in thyroid can-
cer for HLA class I heavy chains and between 17% in 
bone and soft tissue cancer and 73% in uveal melanoma 
for β-2 microglobulin [24] Multiple molecular mecha-
nisms have been shown to result in defective HLA class 
I APM components expression and/or function in malig-
nant cells (> 75%). Structural mutations are rarely the 
underlying mechanisms resulting in HLA class I APM 
defects which are frequently caused by epigenetic and 
dysregulatory mechanisms including dysregulated signal-
ing, gene silencing by methylation, modification of chro-
matin structure by histone deacetylation, and inhibition 
by activated MAPK signaling pathway. Therefore, defects 
in HLA class I APM component expression can be cor-
rected in most cases by strategies which counteract the 
underlying mechanisms.
Evaluating the cancer surfaceome: a possible strategy 
to identify targets and monitor immunity
Both B cell and T cells are relevant in the immune 
response. B cell responses reveal antigens recognized by 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes and B cell immunity can have 
an anti-cancer effect. In a murine lung cancer model, 
neoantigen-driven B cell and CD4 T follicular helper 
cells promoted anti-tumor immunity by enhancing 
CD8 T cell effector functions [25]. Enrichment of T fol-
licular helper cell and germinal center B cells correlated 
with favorable clinical outcomes. B cell-recognized anti-
gens drive tumor-specific B cell and T follicular helper 
cell responses; tumor specific T follicular helper cells 
produce IL-21, which is critical for tumor control and 
tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cell effector function.
Mice vaccinated with a novel combination of an 
autophagosome-enriched vaccine derived from 4T1 
mammary carcinoma and poly-I:C adjuvant demonstrate 
increases in antigen-specific CD8 + T cell recognition of 
4T1 tumor cells and peptides. For proteins confirmed in 
4T1 cells and vaccine by mass spectrometry, there is a 
correlation between increased CD8 + T cell IFN-γ release 
and vaccine-induced IgG, with both recognizing compo-
nents of the same long peptide and recognition of both 
wild-type peptide and the neoantigen variant [26].
There is general agreement that cancer vaccines are 
ineffective as monotherapy. However, triple therapy in 
combination with a glucocorticoid-induced tumour 
necrosis factor receptor-related protein (GITR) agonist 
and PD-1 blockade can achieve sustained tumor effec-
tor T-cell responses in mice [27]. A clinical trial of triplet 
immunotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carci-
noma (HNSCC) with vaccine (DPV-001) plus anti-PD-1 
with or without anti-GITR has been initiated, with one of 
the primary aims being to assess T cell response to anti-
gens relevant to HNSCC.
Proteogenomic analysis of major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) class I-associated immunopeptidome 
of 19 primary acute myeloid leukemia samples identified 
58 tumor-specific shared non-mutated non-canonical 
protein antigens [28]. These mainly resulted from epige-
netic changes and intron retention and were coded by 
transcripts expressed in leukemic blasts and stem cells. 
Page 6 of 21
Ascierto et al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2022) 20:391 
As these genes were shown not to be expressed in the 
thymus, the host should lack central tolerance to these 
antigens, explaining the observation that these antigens 
elicited CD8 T cell responses in vitro and in vivo to these 
shared non-mutated cancer antigens. In another study, 
a proteogenomic method integrating ribosome profiling 
and mass spectrometry found that 2503 of 14,498 pro-
teins identified in three human B cell lymphomas were 
non-canonical; 28% were new isoforms and 72% cryptic 
proteins [29]. Cryptic proteins are more disordered and 
unstable than classical proteins and are especially effi-
cient at generating MHC-I peptides. It is possible that 
many of these proteins will not be available for cross-
presentation when whole tumor cells are used as vac-
cines. Peptides originating from non-canonical proteins 
detected by ribosome profiling of malignant and healthy 
samples can be displayed on MHC-I of cancer cells, act-
ing as additional sources of cancer antigens. Non-canon-
ical proteins contributed 16% of all the detected proteins 
presented by the HLA complex in one study [30].
In summary, identification of novel non-canonical/
unannotated proteins presented by HLA of human can-
cer cells generate many previously unrecognized cancer 
antigens. Many appear to be shared, lack central toler-
ance, and provide new opportunities for cancer vaccines 
and other immunotherapies. Better understanding of the 
function of these short-lived, rapidly degraded proteins 
provides new areas for research and potential novel ther-
apeutic targets.
Translational research (TR) for precision immuno‑oncology 
in melanoma
Translational research can be used to guide precision 
immuno-oncology. Precision medicine involves integrat-
ing multiple data streams, including clinical data, genom-
ics, and patient-reported outcomes, as well as newer 
techniques such as digital pathology and radiomics, into 
a clinical decision-making support tool. However, how 
to optimize output from this data collection remains a 
challenge.
Interrogating tissue at baseline may help allow identi-
fication of patients for the most appropriate treatment. 
Data can be derived from fresh tumor material and liq-
uid biopsies. Fresh tumor processing techniques include 
single-cell RNA sequencing, fast analytical screening 
technique fine-needle aspiration (FAST-FNA), spatial 
transcriptomics, organoids, xenographs, and mechanis-
tic studies. If there is no access to fresh source material, 
fixed tumor samples can be processed by immunohisto-
chemistry, immunofluorescence, spatial transcriptomics, 
and digital pathology. Imaging techniques such as CT, 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emis-
sion tomography (PET) molecular imaging can also be 
employed by means of radiomics approaches. It is impor-
tant that biomarkers can be identified using fixed tumor 
material because these can be more widely deployed in 
the clinic. These data can be used by a molecular tumor 
board to drive precision immuno-oncology in mela-
noma. Protocols aiming at maximizing the output from 
each translational sample are now available, with differ-
ent strategies being adopted dependent on the volume of 
material available.
An example of translational research for preci-
sion immuno-oncology is provided by single-cell RNA 
sequencing. PEMSYS is an observational phase II trial 
designed to analyze modulation of the TME by pembroli-
zumab as first-line therapy in melanoma using a systems 
biology approach. Three single-cell tumor biopsies are 
taken per patient; at baseline, after 2 cycles of treatment, 
and at disease progression. Single-cell RNA sequencing 
is used to profile all tumor and microenvironment cells, 
with the current focus on cancer-associated fibroblasts 
(CAF). Clustering of CAFs reveals several subpopula-
tions: myoCAFs and inflammatory/immune CAFs, which 
include immune-regulatory CAFs, antigen-presenting 
CAFs, and secretory (APOE +) CAFs. Plasticity has been 
observed between subpopulations. The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) data deconvolution using CIBERSORTx, a 
machine learning method to infer cell-type-specific gene 
expression profile (GEP) without physical cell isolation, 
reveals an inverse correlation between immune-regula-
tory and antigen-presenting CAFs. Other CAF subtypes 
do not show a particular pattern. These data has been 
generated by Dr. Krisztian Homicsko from the Lausanne 
University Hospital.
On a larger scale, standardization of data is needed 
but sharing of -omics data has proven to be challeng-
ing. However, new opportunities are on the horizon. One 
example is ProjecTILs, an algorithm that aims to provide 
a common reference atlas for various single-cell RNA 
sequencing datasets [31]. ProjecTILs identifies gene pro-
grams that are altered in different conditions and tissues 
and the use of such strategies should help us share multi-
omics data.
As fresh material management is quite complex, it 
is desirable to find correlated features in easily acces-
sible data sources, i.e., fixed material and/or clinical 
images. Biomarkers based on digital pathology or radi-
omics would be highly desirable in the clinic. Interpret-
able machine learning algorithms for digital pathology 
show promise and could be used to select patient with 
increased benefit for a given immunotherapy.
In conclusion, translational research in cancer is fast 
evolving. New -omics strategies are providing unprec-
edented opportunities for biomarker development. 
Mechanistic studies remain a key to develop the causal

relationships between tumor evolution, different cell sub-
types, differentiation states of immune cells and response 
to treatment via multi-markers integration. Such studies 
represent powerful approaches to identify new targets 
and mechanisms of action of experimental immuno-
therapies to guide novel therapeutic interventions in 
cancer (Fig. 1).
Gene expression profiling assays in the risk assessment 
of primary melanoma
GEP-based assays for melanoma are designed to predict 
recurrence or metastatic risk. There are currently three 
major GEP tests that have reported data in melanoma. 
The DecisionDX assay includes 31 genes with the end-
point of relapse-free survival (RFS) and prediction of sen-
tinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) metastases, the 8-GEP 
MelaGenix assay, which focused on melanoma-specific 
survival (MSS) in the adjuvant indication, and the 8-GEP 
CP-GEP test, which is prognostic for SLNB metastases 
combined with other clinic-pathological factors [32].
The three stages of GEP assay development are discov-
ery, validation, and evaluation of clinical utility. The first 
step of discovery involves identifying genes, developing 
a training set, and establishing a formula with cut-off 
thresholds. Clinical validation involves evaluating perfor-
mance for its intended use and its ability to discriminate 
between high and low-risk patients. Finally, the potential 
benefit for patient management needs to be evaluated, 
e.g., the selection of high-risk patients for adjuvant 
treatment.
In development of the MelaGenix assay, expression of 
11 fresh frozen melanoma signature genes was quanti-
fied by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
in a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) melanoma 
training cohort [33]. A prognostic 8-gene signature in 
the tumor area (tumor and adjacent tissue) of stage I-III 
melanoma was identified. A signature based GEP score 
was calculated as the sum of the coded expression data 
of the genes and correlated with MSS. In a clinical valida-
tion cohort, the dichotomized GEP score discriminated 
significantly between short-term and long-term survi-
vors and remained significant in a multivariate analysis 
that accounted for American Joint Committee on Cancer 
(AJCC) stage, age, and sex.
Utility of the 11-gene signature assay was tested in 245 
patients with stage II melanoma using prospectively col-
lected FFPE samples. Statistically significant survival dif-
ferences were observed between patients with high and 
low GEP score for 10-year MSS, distant metastases-free 
survival (DMFS) and RFS [34]. Based on these data, the 
GEP assay is being used in an ongoing phase II adjuvant 
trial in patients with stage II melanoma who are SLN-
negative within 12 weeks of SLNB. Patients with a high-
risk GEP score are randomized to adjuvant nivolumab or 
Fig. 1  Possible melanoma TR strategy

observation, while low-risk GEP score patients undergo 
observation. The 11-gene GEP has also been assessed in 
291 patients with stage I-III melanoma, with significant 
differences in 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and MSS 
between patients with high and low-risk GEP scores [35].
In 2020, the US Melanoma Prevention Working Group 
concluded that, although every GEP test has prognostic 
power, their routine use is not supported at the current 
time. In the future, their use may help support identifi-
cation of patients for SLNB and adjuvant therapy [32]. 
In particular, GEP may become important in identifying 
stage I-II patients suitable for adjuvant therapy and stage 
III patients in whom adjuvant therapy might be avoided.
New insights into immunotherapy resistance revealed 
by Wilms tumor
The efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy is greatest in T cell-
inflamed tumors, characterized by a proinflammatory 
chemokine expression, infiltration of T cells, a type I 
IFN signature and immune escape via immune system-
suppressive pathways. In comparison, immune resistance 
in non-T cell inflamed tumors is involves the exclusion 
of T cells, suppression of TME and disfunction of MHC 
among others [36]. Pediatric Wilms tumor displays 
the lowest tumor immune gene signature score of all 
human cancers. Investigation of Wilms tumor revealed 
an immune gene signature lower than matched normal 
kidney samples, other pediatric tumor samples, and adult 
kidney tumor samples, which reflects minimal CD8 + T 
cell presence [37]. Non-synonymous mutation frequency 
does not correlate with T cell gene signature in any can-
cers among TCGA, suggesting that mutation load and 
immune cell infiltration are independent events and 
that the absence of mutational neoepitopes is unlikely to 
explain the lack of a T-cell-inflamed TME in ‘cold tumor’ 
cancer types [38]. In Wilms tumors, a high DNA repair 
score inversely correlated with immune gene signature. A 
high DNA repair score also inversely correlated with the 
immune gene signature in most adult tumors in TCGA. 
In melanoma, DNA repair score inversely correlated with 
immune gene signature, and can be represented by DNA 
mismatch repair protein MSH2. Immunofluorescence 
staining for MSH2 inversely correlated with CD8 + T 
cells. High MSH2 expression was associated with poor 
CD8 + T cell infiltration and resistance to anti-PD-1 in 
metastatic melanoma.
Thus, investigating Wilms tumor revealed high expres-
sion of DNA repair enzyme genes linked to poor immune 
cell infiltration and activation. High MSH2 protein 
expression in melanoma is associated with anti-PD-1 
resistance, which suggests the paradigm of inhibiting 
DNA repair in cold tumors to promote immunogenicity.
Novel humanized mouse model to study mechanisms 
of immune‑related toxicities
There is a causal relationship between pre-treatment 
auto-antibodies  and irAEs. For example, baseline sera 
auto-antibodies from melanoma patients induced colitis 
in humanized Fcγ receptor (FcγR) mice treated with anti-
PD-1. Melanoma patient IgG deposits were observed in 
colon and kidney tissues of humanized FcγR mice.
A novel humanized FcγR mouse model was devel-
oped for pre-clinical evaluation and prediction of irAEs 
to determine the effect of pre-existing autoantibodies. 
Purified IgG from melanoma patients  with or without 
grade III-IV toxicity, as well as healthy subjects as con-
trol, were injected into humanized FcγR mice treated 
with anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4 or both anti-PD-1 and anti-
CTLA-4. A colitis phenotype of humanized FcγR mice 
treated  with immune checkpoint inhibitors was iden-
tified, which involved infiltration of the colonic tissue 
by CD8 + T cells, F4/80 + macrophage and Ly6 + neu-
trophils. GeoMx  analysis confirmed the infiltration of 
colon in mice that developed colitis after transfer of toxic 
IgG and identified a colitis-specific gene signature with 
upregulation of immune cells expressing immune check-
point inhibitors, such as LAG3, TIM-3, PD-1(PD-L1), 
and CTLA-4. Expression of VISTA and CD276 (B7-H3) 
as well as high levels of the T cell activation marker gran-
zyme B were also observed. Distinct clusters of colitis-
associated immune cells  in  mouse  lamina propria were 
identified by single-cell RNA sequencing after anti-PD-1 
treatment. Two distinct cell subsets were enriched in the 
colon of anti-PD-1-treated mice that developed a coli-
tis phenotype: terminal effector CD8 cells (T-Ikzf2) and 
innate lymphoid cells group 3. T-Ikzf2 cells are a novel 
subpopulation not described previously in colitis. Some 
investigators have characterized cells with high levels 
of Ikzf2 and low expression of IL7 receptors as terminal 
effector CD8 + T cells, which fits a profile of the T-Ikzf2 
identified in colons of mice developing colitis. Innate 
lymphoid cells have previously been linked to inflam-
mation and are expected to be found in the inflamed 
colon. Microbial genomic profiling by 16sRNA sequenc-
ing showed that anti-PD-1 treatment causes a shift in 
the microbial composition, but this was not signifi-
cantly different between experimental groups. Increased 
microbiome diversity with increased prevalence of Verru-
comicrobia was observed in mice treated with anti-PD-1/
anti-CTLA-4 combination; this creates disproportion in 
the microbiome and may be a prognostic factor for intes-
tinal inflammation.

Lymphatic transport and the intersection of melanoma 
immunity and metastasis
Melanoma tumor cells enter the lymphatic vessels and 
then the lymph nodes, which serve as a gateway in most 
early cancers. However, the lymphatic vasculature is not 
simply a conduit for metastases but is also the route for 
antigen presentation and dendritic cell (DC) transport 
and an active player in immune surveillance [39]. Lym-
phatic vessels regulate changes in intrinsic pumping and 
capillary remodeling and express a dynamic repertoire of 
inflammatory chemokines and adhesion molecules that 
facilitates leukocyte egress out of inflamed tissue. On 
arrival in lymph nodes, lymph orchestrates the rapid acti-
vation of adaptive immune responses.
The lymphatic system contributes to immune homeo-
stasis and developing of melanoma through several over-
lapping and context-dependent mechanisms. Increased 
interstitial fluid load and inflammatory mediators influ-
ence intrinsic lymphatic pumping activity that contrib-
utes to local inflammation and anti-tumor responses.
Local inflammatory mediators act in coordination 
with lymphatic transport to affect tissue physiology and 
the kinetics of antigen presentation in lymph nodes. The 
lymphatic vasculature also regulates the migration of 
leukocytes, including DCs, to lymph nodes. DC migra-
tion is facilitated through chemokines and inflammatory 
cytokines, such as CCL21 and TNF-ɑ. The endothelial 
cells of the lymphatic vasculature also have their own 
intrinsic immunological properties, including the ability 
to cross-present antigen and the constitutive expression 
of checkpoint molecules, such as PD-L1 [40, 41]].
A predictive model of analysis in real world data 
related to metastatic melanoma patients treated 
with immunotherapy
Outcomes with the real-world use of immune checkpoint 
inhibitors may differ from those observed in clinical tri-
als. Because of this, there is a need to identify patients 
most likely to benefit from real-world treatment. The 
predictive and prognostic ability of several clinical vari-
ables were retrospectively investigated in 578 patients 
with metastatic melanoma treated with ipilimumab, 
nivolumab or pembrolizumab monotherapies at the Isti-
tuto Nazionale Tumori IRCCS Fondazione “G. Pascale”, 
Naples, Italy [42].
linical variables used to define patients’ risk of death or 
relapse and a weight given to each category was applied 
to create a e clinical categorization algorithm (CLICAL).. 
The weight of each variable and the number of the vari-
ables selected resulted in a predictive score which allows 
to determine the level of benefit to checkpoint therapy 
for melanoma patients.
The scores were grouped into predictive signatures 
from the worst benefit (signature I) to the best ben-
efit (signature V). Included variables were age (younger 
vs. older), BRAF status (mutation vs. wild type), pre-
treatment with targeted therapy (yes vs. no), lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) (very high vs. high vs. normal), 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (abnormal vs. normal), 
and eosinophil percentage (abnormal vs. normal). Sig-
nature V comprises a higher percentage of responder 
patients and a lower percentage of non-responder 
patients compared to signature I. Of interest, non-
responders with higher signatures (IV-V) had better 
survival compared with non-responders with signatures 
I-III.
The algorithm was validated in an external cohort of 
117 patients at Karolinska University Hospital, Stock-
holm, Sweden, The CLICAL algorithm identifies ied dif-
ferent groups of patients that differ in clinical outcome 
with the same benefit as in the l Italian cohort. The CLI-
CAL was defined using a machine learning algorithm-
survival random forest analysis topredict the response 
to checkpoint inhibitors therapy groups of melanoma 
patients..
The use of a predictive algorithm has potential to iden-
tify patients likely to benefit from immunotherapy and 
so may support decision-making for patients referred for 
immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. It is also being 
extended to cover more cancer types and datasets and 
has already been applied in colon cancer. A stand-alone 
web application is being developed (Fig. 2).
The state of microbiome/fecal transplant
Numerous studies support a link between the gut micro-
biome and response to immunotherapy, so an important 
question is whether altering the microbiome in PD-1 
refractory patients can result in antitumor responses.
Baseline gut microbiota affect the response to anti-
PD-1 therapy; however, the species involved can differ. 
In a study in patents with melanoma treated with PD-1 
checkpoint inhibitors, responders had increased Firmi-
cutes phyla and increased bacterial diversity [43]. Other 
studies have reported increased Bifidobacterium spp, or 
Akkermansia spp. in responders [22, 44]. In patients with 
PD-1-refractory melanoma, Fecal Microbiota Trans-
plant (FMT) from responders induced rapid and durable 
changes in the microbiota, with engraftment of bacteria 
belonging to Firmicutes and Actinobacteria phyla [45]. 
A single responder FMT resulted in engraftment in all 
responder recipient patients (n = 6/6) and some non-
responders (n = 4/9). Recipient metagenomic changes 
were rapid, with the rate of compositional change slightly 
greater in responders. Profound induction of anti-com-
mensal IgG was also seen in the serum of recipients, with 
Page 10 of 21
Ascierto et al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2022) 20:391 
the magnitude of change significantly greater in respond-
ers compared with non-responders.
Single responder FMT administration re-sensitized 
refractory 
melanoma 
patients 
to 
pembrolizumab. 
Responses included Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) responses and durable sta-
ble disease (> 12  months). Transplantation outcomes 
were similar whether donors were complete or partial 
responders; however, complete response donors had sig-
nificantly greater bacterial diversity compared to partial 
response donors. In responders to FMT and pembroli-
zumab. adaptive T cell and memory immune responses 
were detectable peripherally; unbiased multiparam-
eter flow cytometry from peripheral blood revealed that 
responders had greater CD8 + T cells which expressed 
high levels of activation markers and lower levels of 
CD27 CD56 + 8 + T cells which expressed high levels of 
activation markers, as well as increased T EMRA and 
mucosal-associated invariant T cells. FMT also reduced 
suppressive 
intratumorally 
IL-8-producing 
myeloid 
cells, with single cell RNA sequencing revealing that 
non-responders had higher frequency of myeloid cells 
which expressed CXCL8 (IL-8) following treatment. 
FMT produced dramatic shifts in the metabolome, with 
increased serum bile acids and more efficient transfor-
mation of primary to secondary bile acids in responders. 
Bacterial catabolism products of benzoate degradation 
pathways, associated with greater microbiome diversity, 
were higher in responders. In clinical trial in patients 
who relapsed following the checkpoint therapy FMT 
resulted in favorable changes in the TME and clinical 
responses.[46].
An 
oral 
rationally-defined 
bacterial 
consortium 
(VE800) of 11 clonal human commensal bacteria strains 
in combination with nivolumab is evaluated in a first-
in-patient clinical trial in patients with selected types of 
metastatic cancer [47].
Composition of the gut microbiome arm may 
also influence the development of irAEs. In patients 
with metastatic melanoma treated with ipilimumab, 
increased Bacteroidetes phylum was correlated with less 
checkpoint-blockade-induced colitis, whereas Rumi-
nococcus presence was associated with colitis [48]. A sig-
nificantly higher abundance of Bacteroides intestinalis 
has also been observed in patients with a high rate of any

grade ≥ 3 irAE, with upregulation of mucosal IL-1β in 
patient samples of colitis and in pre-clinical models [49].
Perspectives in uveal melanoma
Systemic treatments commonly used to treat advanced 
cutaneous melanoma rarely achieve durable responses in 
patients with uveal melanoma, which is molecularly dis-
tinct from cutaneous and mucosal melanoma. Metastatic 
disease develops in approximately 50% of patients and 
is associated with poor survival due to the lack of effec-
tive treatment options. Thus, novel effective therapies are 
needed.
Uveal melanoma is characterized by mutations in 
GNAQ and GNA11, resulting in Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK 
pathway activation. Treatment with the MEK1/2 inhibi-
tor, selumetinib, had limited efficacy either alone or 
with chemotherapy [50, 51]. However, combination 
approaches remain of interest, with another MEK1/2 
inhibitor, binimetinib, demonstrating promising early 
activity in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma in 
combination with darovasertib, a protein kinase C inhibi-
tor, according to preliminary data from an ongoing phase 
1/2 trial [52]. Combined checkpoint blockade has also 
shown some degree of activity in uveal melanoma, with 
outcomes numerically superior to those seen with single 
agent therapy and should be prioritized outside of trial 
options for eligible patients [53].
Tebentafusp is a novel bispecific immune mobilizing T 
cell receptor-based agent with increased affinity for the 
glycoprotein (gp)100 peptide presented by HLA-A02 on 
tumor cells. In a phase III trial of 378 patients with pre-
viously untreated HLA-A*02:01-positive metastatic uveal 
melanoma, tebentafusp was well tolerated, with the most 
frequent adverse events consistent with its proposed 
mechanism of action [54]. The primary endpoint of OS 
was reached in the intention-to-treat population, with 
1 year OS of 73% in the tebentafusp group compared to 
59% in the control group (investigator’s choice of therapy 
with single-agent pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, or dacar-
bazine) (HR for death, 0.51; p < 0.001).
The use of tebentafusp has now been approved by the 
FDA for the treatment of adults with HLA-A*02:01-posi-
tive metastatic uveal melanoma.
PFS was also significantly improved although not to 
the same extent as OS benefit. Tebentafusp-treated 
patients with any RECIST response, including best over-
all response of progressive disease, had survival curves 
trending above the control arm [55]. That an OS ben-
efit with tebentafusp is observed even in patients with 
progressive disease suggests that RECIST-based radio-
graphic assessments do not capture the complete benefit 
from tebentafusp.
Data from the phase II IMCgp100-102 trial in HLA-
A0201-positive previously treated patients revealed 92% 
of patients had detectable ctDNA with almost all patients 
having mutations in known uveal melanoma oncogenes. 
Almost 70% of evaluable patients had a reduction in cir-
culating tumor (ct) DNA on tebentafusp, and there was a 
linear relationship between magnitude of ctDNA reduc-
tion and improvement in OS. Reduction in ctDNA iden-
tified patients with OS benefit, regardless of best RECIST 
response, reinforcing the hypothesis that RECIST may 
under-estimate the OS benefit from tebentafusp.
HLA typing should be performed at time of metastasis 
for all patients and considered for patients with high-risk 
primary disease and tebentafusp should be offered to all 
eligible patients, whether previously treated or untreated. 
More research is needed to understand the disconnect 
between RECIST progressive disease and long OS with 
implied tumor burden decrease. Adjuvant and combi-
natorial strategies with tebentafusp are also areas that 
require urgent investigation. Unmet needs include HLA-
A0201-negative 
patients 
and 
tebentafusp-resistant/
refractory patients.
Electrochemotherapy
Electrochemotherapy (ECT) involves the application of 
high intensity electric pulses to tissues to increase cell 
membrane permeability, allowing the direct diffusion 
of cytotoxic agents. In addition to its use in skin can-
cers, ECT can be employed for the treatment of deep-
seated lesions, including liver, pancreatic, and prostate 
cancers, head and neck tumors, bone metastases, and 
gastrointestinal cancer. This has required new techno-
logical developments, such as deployable, expandable 
electrodes designed to access deep-seated target tissues. 
Targeting deep tumors also requires significant preopera-
tive planning, with software being used to automatically 
generate the geometric configuration needed to guide 
electrode insertion and minimize the number of elec-
trodes required while ensuring complete coverage of the 
target area.
Use of ECT should be integrated with other modali-
ties, with indications including early cutaneous relapse 
after previous surgical treatment, complete or partial 
responses after previous ECT, palliation of hemostatic or 
painful lesions, and as neoadjuvant treatment of exten-
sive lesions or to reduce surgical approach.
ECT can promote durable responses. In 60 patients 
with relapsed and refractory cutaneous melanoma 
metastases or in-transit disease, the objective response 
rate (ORR) of all treated lesions was 87% [56]. Thirteen 
patients (45% of complete responders) experienced a 
long-lasting response after one ECT session and were 
disease-free after a mean follow-up of 27.5  months. 
Page 12 of 21
Ascierto et al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2022) 20:391 
In analysis of prospective data from 28 centers across 
Europe collected over an 11-year period, including 987 
patients with 2482 tumor lesions, the ORR was 85% [57]. 
ECT was effective across several cancer types, including 
malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, breast can-
cer metastases, squamous cell carcinoma, and Kaposi’s 
sarcoma. A higher complete response rate was observed 
for lesions < 3 cm in size, with linear array electrodes pro-
viding better tumor control than hexagonal electrodes in 
smaller lesions. In tumors > 2  cm, intravenous adminis-
tration was superior to intratumoral administration.
ECT can produce an abscopal effect to enhance the 
benefit of combination with immunotherapy due to its 
immunogenic effect. In 127 patients treated with ipili-
mumab, the use of local irradiation, ECT, or selective 
internal radiotherapy of liver metastases prolonged 
OS [58]. Similarly, local ORR and PFS were higher with 
pembrolizumab plus ECT than with pembrolizumab 
alone (78% vs. 39%; p < 0.001, and 86% vs, 51%; p < 0.001, 
respectively) in a retrospective matched cohort analysis 
of patients with stage IIIC-IV melanoma [59]. Systemic 
disease control and survival were also increased with the 
addition of ECT.
Emergent strategies
Neoadjuvant in melanoma
Without systemic therapy, stage III melanoma patients 
have a poor prognosis, with a 5-year OS of only 30–60%. 
Even with adjuvant therapy, the RFS remains poor. 
However, neoadjuvant ipilimumab plus nivolumab was 
associated with better 4-year RFS and OS than an adju-
vant ipilimumab plus nivolumab approach in the OpA-
CIN study, with none of the patients with a pathologic 
response having relapsed [60]. In the OpACIN-neo trial 
which assessed dosing regimens of neoadjuvant ipili-
mumab plus nivolumab, the 2-year estimated RFS was 
84% without adjuvant treatment. In an analysis of data 
pooled from six clinical trials of anti-PD-1-based immu-
notherapy or BRAF/MEK targeted therapy, pathologic 
response was shown to a better surrogate marker for 
immunotherapy than for targeted therapy [61].
In patients with clinical stage III or oligometastatic 
stage IV melanoma with RECIST v1.1 measurable, sur-
gically resectable disease, neoadjuvant followed by adju-
vant nivolumab plus the LAG-3 inhibitor relatlimab 
resulted in a pathological complete response (pCR) rate 
of 59% and near pCR rate (< 10% viable tumor) resulting 
in an overall major pathological response (MPR) rate of 
66% [62]. All patients with a MPR were alive at one-year, 
versus 80% of patients without a MPR. The combination 
was well tolerated, with no treatment-related grade ≥ 3 
in the neoadjuvant setting and no surgical delays due to 
treatment-related toxicity.
Previous studies have indicated that baseline IFN-γ 
signature high patients were more likely to respond to 
ipilimumab plus nivolumab. The DONIMI study will 
assess the combination of ipilimumab plus nivolumab 
combined with a class 1 histone deacetylase inhibitor, 
domatinostat, in 40 stage III melanoma patients with 
macroscopic de novo or recurrent disease according to 
IFN-γ signature [63]. Pathologic response rates were 
higher in in IFN-γ signature-high patients. At a median 
follow-up of 8.9  months, estimated 6-month RFS rate 
was 100% in IFN-γ signature-high patients and 79% in 
IFN-γ signature-low patients. Treatment was well toler-
ated. Several other neoadjuvant immunotherapy combi-
nations in melanoma are being assessed in clinical trials. 
In conclusion, neoadjuvant therapy has the potential to 
reduce tumor burden and to provide prognostic informa-
tion. Pathological response should be considered an early 
surrogate endpoint for clinical trials and a new bench-
mark for drug development and approval in melanoma.
Exploring the activity of BRAF‑/MEK‑inhibition 
beyond currently approved indications
Plasma derived cell free (ctDNA) levels can be predic-
tive of and improved clinical outcomes in patients with 
metastatic melanoma treated with PD-1 inhibitors. BRAF 
V600 mutant ctDNA could be useful as a biomarker and 
early predictor of acquired resistance in patients with 
BRAF V600 mutant melanoma.
In a phase II study a(cf)DNA test was used for the 
detection of BRAFV600 mutations. The of BRAF muta-
tions in64.8%) of patients correlated with the results of 
the tissue test that had a positive BRAFV600 mutation 
with the cfDNA test [64]. In addition, 5.9% of patients 
with a wild-type BRAF status had a positive BRAF V600 
mutant cfDNA test; retesting tissue confirmed BRAF 
V600 mutant status positivity in 5/7 patients.
. This indicates that cfDNA analysis may be used to 
confirm BRAF mutations status as an alternative to 
tumor biopsy. However, it should be noted that thesensi-
tivity of cfDNA testing in this study was.
only 64.8%.
Resistance to BRAF-selective inhibitors can be revers-
ible following treatment interruption, with responses 
shown in patients who progressed on BRAF V600 
inhibitor therapy and who were rechallenged with dab-
rafenib and vemurafenib after treatment-free intervals 
of 4–8 months. [65]. In a phase II trial in patients with 
BRAF V600-mutant melanoma who had previously 
progressed on BRAF inhibitors (with or without MEK 
inhibitors) and were off-treatment for at least 12 weeks, 
dabrafenib plus trametinib rechallenge resulted in antitu-
mor activity. with [66].

The mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK-
pathway) is frequently activated in melanoma by proto-
oncogene driver mutations. MEK inhibitor monotherapy 
has activity in BRAF V600 wild-type, NRAS Q61R/K/L 
mutant melanoma and BRAF V600 wild-type/NRAS 
Q61R/K/L wild-type melanoma but is associated with 
considerable treatment-limiting skin toxicity. This can be 
mitigated by combining with BRAF inhibition. In a study 
of patients with advanced NRAS Q61R/K/L mutant mel-
anoma pretreated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, 
trametinib plus low-dose dabrafenib mitigated MEK-
inhibitor-related skin toxicity but clinical activity was 
insufficient [67]. However, promising antitumor activity, 
with an ORR of 43% in 14 evaluable patients and accepta-
ble toxicity were observed in an interim analysis of NRAS 
Q61R/K/L wild-type patients [68].
Future possibilities include the use of pan-RAF inhibi-
tors and BRAF paradox breakers. Also, a class II BRAF 
inhibitor regorafenib, can seemingly reverse resistance 
to immunotherapy in colorectal cancer. A rapid clinical 
response was observed with off-label treatment with 
regorafenib plus low-dose trametinib in a heavily pre-
treated stage IV NRAS Q61R-mutant melanoma patient. 
This approach is being investigated in a phase II 2-stage 
design trial investigating regorafenib in pretreated mela-
noma (RegoMel) (Fig. 3).
Developing a new antibody targeting regulatory T cells 
in cancer
CD25 is the high affinity subunit of the IL-2 receptor-α 
that is highly expressed on Tregs and upregulated on 
activated T effector (Teff) cells in  vitro. Scientific and 
pre-clinical study of CD25 have mostly focused on two 
main aspects of the receptor blocking that might be use-
ful in treating autoimmunity and regulatory T cell deple-
tion. In murine tumors, CD25 is primarily restricted to 
Tregs and not Teff cells while in humans it is preferen-
tially expressed on tumor infiltrating Foxp3 + Tregs. 
Based on these data, CD25 was considered as a potential 
target for immunotherapy; however, lack of therapeutic

activity of the anti-CD25 antibody PC61 in mice and 
humans limited further development. Lack of Treg deple-
tion at the tumor site correlates with lack of protection 
and upregulation of the inhibitory FcγR IIb at the tumor 
site prevented intratumoral Treg cell depletion. Use of 
an Fc engineered anti-CD25 antibody with enhanced 
binding to activating FcγRs led to effective depletion of 
tumor-infiltrating Treg cells, increased Teff-to-Treg cell 
ratios, and improved control of established tumors [69]. 
This Fc optimized anti-CD25 antibody synergized with 
anti PD-1 to reject established tumors in mice.
Anti-CD25 antibodies (daclizumab, basiliximab) devel-
oped to prevent acute organ rejection and/or to treat 
multiple sclerosis block the IL-2/IL-2 receptor interac-
tion, as does the anti-CD25 PC61 clone that is widely 
used for depletion of Treg cells in vivo.. However, In vivo 
activity of these Treg-depleting anti-CD25 antibodies is 
likely limited by their IL-2 blocking activity on the effec-
tor compartment. Increased effector response and anti-
tumor activity may be induced by an anti-CD25 depleting 
antibody that does not affect IL-2 signaling.
An anti-CD25 antibody optimized to deplete Tregs 
whilst preserving IL-2-STAT5 signaling on effector T 
cells showed potent single dose, single agent antitumor 
activity across various mouse models [70]. This potent 
activity of non-IL-2 blocking anti-CD25 is reliant on the 
ability of effector cells to sense endogenous IL-2. In a 
poorly immunogenic melanoma mouse model, combina-
tion of non-IL-2 blocking anti-CD25 with Gvax vaccine 
induced tumor regression, delayed tumor progression 
and improved OS. The vaccine plus non-IL-2 blocking 
anti-CD25 drives Treg depletion/CD4PD1 high depletion, 
effector infiltration, and innate cell activation.
These data led to the development of the first human 
non-IL-2 blocking anti-CD25 (RG6292), which has 
been shown to preferentially deplete Tregs in PBMCs 
and human tumor samples. In a phase I dose escalation 
study, RG6292 monotherapy in patients with advanced 
solid tumors resulted in dose dependent peripheral Treg 
depletion [71]. A clinical trial of RG6292 in combination 
with atezolizumab is underway.
Stability of melanoma cell‑surface PD‑L1 as rate‑limiting 
to therapeutic resistance development
Various therapeutic strategies have been investigated 
to overcome MAPK inhibitor resistance. These include 
combining a type II RAF inhibitor with an allosteric MEK 
inhibitor and triplet combination of BRAF inhibitor plus 
MEK inhibitor plus anti-PD-1.
Type II RAF inhibitor plus MEK inhibitor combination 
prevents and overcomes acquired MEK inhibitor resist-
ance [72]. Switching from type I to type II RAF inhibi-
tor overcame the growth of resistant sub-lines, but only 
when an allosteric MEK inhibitor was present. This may 
be due to the superior ability of a type II RAF inhibitor 
plus MEK inhibitor to physically stabilize RAF/MEK and 
uncouple MEK/ERK. Type II RAF inhibitor plus MEK 
inhibitor may also have a favorable T-cell impact that 
supports combination with anti-PD-1/L1 therapy.
An anti-PD-1/L1 lead-in period before MAPK inhibi-
tor combination optimizes response duration through 
the 
promotion 
of 
pro-inflammatory 
macrophage 
polarization and clonal expansion of IFN-γ high and 
CD8 + cytotoxic and proliferative T cells in murine mod-
els of melanoma driven by BRAF V600, NRAS, or Nf1 
mutations, as well as colorectal and pancreatic carcinoma 
driven by KRAS G12C [73]. SequencingAnti-PD-1/
L1 monotherapy before being combined with a MAPK 
inhibitor also reduces melanoma brain metastases and 
improves survival with robust T cell clonal expansion in 
both intracranial and extracranial metastases.
In recent years, there has been increasing rationales for 
immune strategies to overcome MAPK resistance. Clini-
cal melanoma that acquires MAPK inhibitor resistance 
have reduced cytolytic T cells and antigen presentation 
[74]. Signatures of MAPK inhibitor-treated melanoma 
are associated with innate anti-PD-1 resistance [75]. 
Early on during MAPK inhibitor treatment, melanomas 
undergo dedifferentiation/quasi-mesenchymal transition 
and upregulate tumor cell surface PD-L1/L2 [76 Cancer 
stemness or quasi-mesenchymal phenotype is associated 
with abundant PD-L1, immunosuppression, metastases, 
and therapy resistance in general. In murine melanoma 
models of BRAF and NRAS mutant melanoma, high 
TMB increases MAPK inhibitor response durability in a 
CD8 + T cell dependent manner [72, 73]. Investigation 
of the effect of MAPK inhibitor-elicited melanoma cell 
surface accumulation of PD-L1/L2 on MAPK inhibitor 
resistance is underway. An ideal MAPK co-target would 
be a negative regulator of PD-L1 tumor cell surface accu-
mulation during MAPK inhibitor therapy. Activating this 
negative regulator of PD-L1 should in principle suppress 
acquired MAPK inhibitor resistance.
Strategies to overcome adaptive resistance 
to MAPK‑directed therapies in melanoma
MAPK-directed therapies are often limited by adaptive 
resistance, frequently mediated by activation of RTK 
signaling and rebound of ERK activity. Combinatorial 
targeting of ERK signaling and SHP2, a phosphatase that 
mediates RAS activation downstream of multiple recep-
tor tyrosine kinases, prevents adaptive resistance in 
defined subsets of ERK-dependent tumors. SHP2 inhi-
bition overcomes feedback MAPK reactivation in BRAF 
V600E tumors. RAS and ERK activity are suppressed by 
SHP2 inhibitor in RAS G12X cells, but not in RAS G13D

or RAS Q61X-expressing cells [77 SHP2 inhibition is 
unable to overcome MAPK rebound when RAS Q61X 
is expressed. RAS Q61X mutation or low p(Y542)SHP2 
are negative biomarkers of response in overcoming adap-
tive resistance to MAPK inhibitors by co-targeting SHP2. 
RAS Q61X is probably the most challenging of the RAS 
mutants against which to direct targeted therapy and 
so a parallel focus on targeting effectors and adaptive 
response is needed.
One potential strategy to overcome adaptive drug 
resistance is to exploit the allosteric properties of RAF 
inhibitors [76]. Current RAF inhibitors preferentially 
bind and inhibit monomeric over dimeric RAF, meaning 
they selectively inhibit BRAF V600E in tumors, which 
can signal as a monomer, but not BRAF wild type which 
signals as an obligatory dimer. The inability of these RAF 
inhibitors to inhibit dimeric BRAF is the basis of their 
broad therapeutic window but is also responsible for 
adaptive drug resistance in which relief of negative feed-
back upon MAPK pathway inhibition results in rapid for-
mation of RAF dimers. Negative allostery caused by the 
‘OUT’ position of the αC-helix is the structural basis of 
inhibitor failure to suppress RAF dimers; vemurafenib, 
dabrafenib and encorafenib are all αC-OUT RAF inhibi-
tors. RAF dimer (or ‘pan-RAF’) inhibitors suppress sign-
aling and growth in BRAF wild-type cells but have a low 
therapeutic index. A third group of RAF inhibitors are 
selective for dimeric BRAF V600E; these include the 
FDA-approved multi-kinase inhibitor regorafenib, as 
well as LHX254 and belvarafenib (GDC-5773) that are in 
clinical development. These RAF inhibitors have higher 
inhibitor stability in the dimer specificity pocket due to 
stabilization of the αC helix upon RAF dimerization.
The triple combination of a RAF dimer-selective, a RAF 
monomer-selective, and a MEK inhibitor (regorafenib 
plus dabrafenib plus trametinib) was highly effective and 
well tolerated in multiple BRAF V600E tumor models 
in vivo. This triple combination was also less toxic than 
dimer RAF inhibitor plus MEK inhibitor. In a patient 
with stage IV BRAF V600E colorectal cancer that pro-
gressed on standard therapies, off-label use of this triple 
combination was well tolerated and effective, achieving 
tumor control for almost 8 months.
Moving forward in melanoma, adding a feedback 
inhibitor, such as SHP2, may improve outcomes in BRAF 
V600E-mutant patients, as may the combination of a 
RAF dimer inhibitor plus MEK inhibitor in RAS Q61X-
mutant melanoma. The addition of SHP2 in BRAF 
wild-type/NRAS wild-type should also be investigated. 
Optimal sequencing of MAPK-targeted therapy with 
immunotherapy is also needed.
Tumor metabolism in an age of cancer immunology: 
deconvoluting diverse metabolic programs
A founding observation in cancer metabolism was that 
tumors consume glucose to produce lactate in the pres-
ence of oxygen, a process known as Warburg metabolism. 
Tumor-infiltrating immune cells Teffs and inflamma-
tory myeloid cells all use glycolysis; however, it is unclear 
which cell subsets uptake more glucose in the TME.
Glucose uptake was measured among specific cell sub-
sets in the TME using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-
PET imaging [77]. The most capacity for intra-tumoral 
glucose uptake was observed in myeloid cells, with equiv-
alent levels of glucose uptake in tumor-infiltrating T cells 
and cancer cells across a range of cancer models. High 
glucose uptake was seen in CD11b + cells, including in 
B- and T cell-deficient models. This indicates that high 
glucose uptake in myeloid cells is independent of adap-
tive immunity. In addition, these data show that glucose 
is available in the TME and preferentially partitions into 
infiltrating immune cells versus cancer cells.
In contrast, cancer cells, demonstrated the highest glu-
tamine uptake. This nutrient partitioning was cell-intrin-
sically programmed through mTORC1 signaling and 
glucose and glutamine-related gene expression. Glucose-
related gene sets are enriched in myeloid cells, while fatty 
acid and amino acid-related pathways are enriched in 
cancer cells. Inhibiting glutamine uptake enhanced glu-
cose uptake across tumor resident cell types, demonstrat-
ing that glutamine metabolism suppresses glucose uptake 
without glucose being limiting in the TME. Thus, cell-
intrinsic processes drive the preferential immune and 
cancer cell uptake of glucose and glutamine, respectively.
In cancer, glucose uptake and the production of lactate 
increased even in an aerobic state and the presence of 
functioning mitochondria. This metabolic change pro-
vides substrates required for cancer cell proliferation and 
division, which is involved in tumor growth, metastatic 
progression, and long-term survival. Despite extensive 
research on cancer metabolism with promising results 
generated in the last decades, questions are still aris-
ing. Increased understanding of cancer metabolism sug-
gests that patient FDG-PET scans need re-interpretation 
and new 18F-nutrient tracers could be implemented for 
early detection/therapeutic response. Intrinsic cell-pro-
grammed nutrient partitioning is an alternative model to 
nutrient competition in tumors, where diverse cell popu-
lations preferentially acquire distinct metabolites from 
a common pool of metabolites available in the TME. 
In this model, glycolytic tumors are immunoinhibitory 
because of large-scale microenvironmental changes that 
alter intrinsic cellular programming rather than directly 
due to nutrient deficiencies. Targeting of cell selective 
partitioning of these nutrients may lead to therapies that 
Page 16 of 21
Ascierto et al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2022) 20:391 
improve immune cell function in the TME while impair-
ing the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. The 
metabolic switch in tumor cells and interaction with the 
immune system should be considered in the development 
of tumor-specific tracers and drugs, which should block 
specific pathway(s) in tumors but not normal tissues.
Shall we continue to fight the dragon or try to kill its eggs?
Metaphorically, overt metastatic disease (nodal or dis-
tant) can be considered the ‘dragon’, whereas possible 
undetectable dormant disease, e.g., after surgery or after 
apparent complete response after therapy, represent the 
‘eggs’. Treating eggs and dragons is conceptually very dif-
ferent. Eggs only exist as a probability after surgery and 
adjuvant therapy is based on perceived risk with a pre-
defined completely hypothetical ideal duration, usually 
of one-year, and no way to evaluate its efficacy. Dragons 
are a reality that involves treating a detectable disease in 
adjuvant or metastatic settings, with duration of treat-
ment defined by a direct reading of the effect.
Adjuvant trials suggest we can have an impact on the 
eggs, with delayed RFS in AJCC stage II-III and even 
monolesional stage IV patients. However, it is unknown 
whether eggs are destroyed or just ‘frozen’. The key ques-
tion is whether it is easier to kill eggs than dragons or, 
in other words, is treatment more active in the adjuvant 
setting than in metastatic disease. Cross-over trials, such 
as the KEYNOTE-054 pembrolizumab trial, in which 
patients receive early adjuvant therapy or crossover to 
therapy at relapse should answer this question; however, 
this is not really the case since, at relapse, patients will 
receive the best treatment available at that time, and not 
necessarily the cross-over treatment.
Adjuvant ipilimumab has shown an OS benefit com-
pared with placebo [78]. However, to date neither adju-
vant PD-1 inhibition nor targeted therapy have shown 
a significant OS benefit, [79]. One explanation maybe 
that adjuvant therapy only increases RFS in less aggres-
sive disease, which contributes little and later to survival. 
Thus, does adjuvant treatment perhaps only  freeze  the 
eggs of ‘good dragons’, which might respond to later 
treatment anyway, while unable to freeze the eggs of ‘bad 
dragons’?
Increased RFS and DMFS with adjuvant therapy is rel-
evant even if OS is unchanged, since avoidance of relapse 
is very important for patient wellbeing, with relapse hav-
ing a worse impact than adverse events on patients’ qual-
ity-of-life. In addition, disease evolution is unpredictable 
and so adjuvant therapy is an advisable strategy, even in 
the absence of evidence that the most aggressive eggs are 
the ones sensitive to adjuvant treatment and that such 
an evolution will be delayed or avoided. Finally, adju-
vant therapy increased the likelihood that the patient will 
have better status if and when new metastatic treatments 
become available, a reasonable expectation in the context 
of dramatic progress in melanoma.
Whether treatment can be more active in the adjuvant 
setting than in metastatic disease may differ for targeted 
therapy and checkpoint inhibition. With BRAF/MEK 
inhibition, it may be easier to kill eggs than dragons, 
given that genomic resistance and cell plasticity leading 
to progressive cell reprogramming may have developed 
before later intervention at time of distant metastases. 
In contrast, response to anti-PD-1 therapy depends on 
the presence or absence of a good microenvironment 
and favorable cofactors which are less likely to change; 
thus, PD-1 immunosensitive eggs will probably give birth 
to PD-1 immunosensitive dragons. BRAF/MEK inhibi-
tion and PD-1 blockade may have a similar effect in the 
adjuvant but not the metastatic setting, where immuno-
therapy may be preferable. As such, BRAF/MEK inhibi-
tor therapy may not be the best option as first-line in the 
metastatic setting but should be considered in the adju-
vant setting for BRAF-mutated IIIA-B melanoma.
An important question is whether BRAF/MEK inhibi-
tion and anti-PD-1 therapy are active against the same 
or different eggs. In BRAF-mutant patients, the hazard 
ratios of adjuvant treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibition 
and anti-PD-1 are very similar but it is unclear whether 
treatments are active against different eggs with a simi-
lar outcome by chance, whether they are controlling the 
same eggs by the same mechanism, or whether some 
“good eggs” are easier to control irrespective of the treat-
ment. It may be that the adjuvant effects limited to eggs 
that are easy to treat because of molecular characteristics 
and host response. The proportion of these responsive 
eggs may be the same whatever the AJCC stage, and it is 
only the respective proportion of bad eggs and patients 
free of eggs that is changing with AJCC stage. Interest-
ingly, the same prognostic biomarkers (IFN-γ GEP) are 
playing in the same direction in adjuvant, metastatic and 
even neoadjuvant settings, for PD-1 and BRAF/MEK 
inhibition, suggesting that treatment efficacy may depend 
on disease aggressiveness and immune environment 
rather than on whether applied early or late (adjuvant or 
metastatic). Current adjuvant treatments may then not 
be in the situation to reduce the proportion of “aggressive 
dragons” (i.e., high lactate dehydrogenase, high kinetics, 
monoresistance) and improve OS, since they are prob-
ably unable to kill or control ‘bad eggs’.
In the metastatic setting, results are generally better in 
patients with low tumor load, i.e., ‘small dragons’. This is 
often considered an argument to treat melanoma as early 
as possible; however, it could also mean that low aggres-
siveness tumors are overrepresented in low tumor load, 
Page 17 of 21
Ascierto et al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2022) 20:391 
	
meaning better efficacy in low aggressiveness tumors, 
and not in earlier treatment.
Clearly, there are no eggs and dragons, just undetect-
able disease, and detectable metastatic disease, which 
represent two phases of the same disease, which itself 
may be aggressive or non-aggressive. Treating early is 
beneficial since it can improve RFS. However, the disease 
process may not be fundamentally altered, and it is likely 
that current adjuvant treatments do not prevent the most 
aggressive disease but instead only control less aggressive 
disease in patients who would have non-aggressive met-
astatic disease and who would respond to later therapy 
anyway. The next challenges are to find better biomarkers 
for detecting biological aggressiveness early on, before 
aggressiveness become obvious at the metastatic stage, 
and to develop adjuvant therapies able to overcome most 
of these early aggressive diseases, which may not yet be 
the case with PD1 and BRAF/MEK inhibition.
What will we do in the clinic next?
Question 1: If I choose immunotherapy for metastatic 
melanoma, will it be as monotherapy or combination?
In the phase III CheckMate 067 trial, median OS at a 
minimum follow-up of 6.5  years was 72  months with 
combination nivolumab plus ipilimumab, 37  months 
with nivolumab and 20  months with ipilimumab alone 
[80]. No new safety signals were observed, and no addi-
tional treatment-related deaths were reported since the 
36-month follow-up. Median treatment-free interval (the 
time from the last dose of study drug to initiation of sub-
sequent systemic therapy or the last known date alive) 
was 28  months with the combination and two months 
in both monotherapy arms, and 77%, 69%, and 43% of 
patients who were still alive were treatment-free in the 
three groups, respectively. Thus, combination therapy 
with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 will be the preferred 
first choice first-line immunotherapy for most patients.
Question 2: For a metastatic melanoma patient 
with a BRAF mutation, what will I choose first?
Three targeted BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations are 
now available (dabrafenib plus trametinib, vemurafenib 
plus cobimetinib, and encorafenib plus binimetinib), and 
all appear fairly similar in efficacy. PD-1 blockade is also 
effective in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma; 6.5-
year OS rates in CheckMate 067 were 57%, 43%, and 25% 
in patients with BRAF-mutant tumors and 46%, 42%, and 
22% in those with BRAF-wild-type tumors in the combi-
nation, nivolumab, and ipilimumab groups, respectively. 
There is also the potential of combining targeted therapy 
and immunotherapy, although results with trials of triplet 
regimens have not been convincing. Sequencing of treat-
ment is also important, with nivolumab plus ipilimumab 
first achieving superior 2-year OS compared with ini-
tial treatment with the BRAF/MEK inhibitor regimen 
of dabrafenib plus trametinib (72% vs 52%; p = 0.0095) 
in the phase III DREAMseq trial [81]. Data from the 
phase II SECOMBIT trial also suggest immunotherapy 
with ipilimumab plus nivolumab before encorafenib plus 
binimetinib is associated with better outcomes than vice 
versa [82]. A ‘sandwich strategy consisting of encorafenib 
plus binimetinib for 8 weeks followed by ipilimumab plus 
nivolumab for 8  weeks also proved more effective than 
starting with targeted therapy and switching to immu-
notherapy at disease progression. Thus, in BRAF-mutant 
patients, combination immunotherapy appears to be a 
better first-choice option than targeted therapy, with 
sandwich therapy an interesting approach for sympto-
matic patients.
Question 3: What will I use as adjuvant therapy 
for high‑risk patients?
Both the KEYNOTE-054 trial of pembrolizumab ver-
sus placebo in resected stage III melanoma and the 
CheckMate-238 trial of nivolumab versus ipilimumab 
in resected stage IIIB–IV melanoma, have shown a RFS 
benefit of anti-PD-1 therapy [83, 84]. The COMBI-AD 
trial also reported a similar RFS benefit with dabrafenib 
plus trametinib versus placebo in patients with BRAF-
mutant melanoma [79]. There is no clear first choice 
based on efficacy, but side effects tend to favor immuno-
therapy. Thus, the choice between anti-PD-1 or BRAF/
MEK combination for a BRAF-mutant patient is largely 
a clinical decision. However, possibly the results of the 
DREAM-Seq trial favor adjuvant immunotherapy.
To help address these questions, mature data from 
SECOMBIT are required. Options for patients after fail-
ure of immunotherapy and targeted therapy need to be 
further investigated, and more clarity on relatlimib plus 
nivolumab versus combination immunotherapy as a first-
line option is needed.
Conclusion
The use of immunotherapy and targeted BRAF and 
MEK inhibitors therapy to treat advanced melanoma 
has improved clinical outcomes for many patients. 
Increased understanding of the TME and immune 
response together with increasing real-world experi-
ence with these agents is leading to greater awareness 
of their strengths but also existing unmet clinical needs. 
Primary and acquired resistance to treatment remains 
a major challenge. Emerging strategies are needed for 
these patients, including new agents, new combinations 
and new adjuvant or neoadjuvant approaches. There is 
also a critical need to develop clinically actionable bio-
markers, as results from such studies may help develop

a new paradigm for immune monitoring in the setting of 
immune checkpoint blockade with emphasis placed on 
assessment of an adaptive immune response in an early 
on treatment using liquid biopsy in addition to pretreat-
ment markers.
